In offering this book to the pubhc, I am aware 
that there are already many good cook books in 
the market. But I trust that this will supply a 
want which has always been felt by young house- 
keepers. The great trouble with most of the cook 
books which I have known (and I am constantly 
hearing the same complaint) is, that they are too 
expensive, that they use weight instead of measure, 
and also that they take for granted that the young 
housekeeper knows many things which she really 
does not. These wants I have endeavored to sup- 
ply in this volume. There is not one receipt in 
the book which has not been proved to be good. 
There are very few which I have not used myself, 
and of the value of those I am fully assured, hav- 
ing seen nearly all of them tried. 



PREFACE TO LAST EDITION. 



Several years have elapsed since the first 
edition of "The Appledore Cook Book" was given 
to the public ; and, in that time, the author has 
been adding to her store of tried receipts, and 
now feels it a duty and a pleasure to give them 
to the public. 

The additional matter has been written on the 
original plan of the book ; that is, that nothing is 
inserted which has not been tried and found prac- 
tical. 

Boston, 1877.

Soup Stock. 



If you buy fresh meat for a soup stock, the shank is the 
most economical. Have it cut into several pieces, and the 
bone cracked, at the butcher's. Wash and put on to boil in 
two gallons of cold water, and one spoonful of salt (the salt 
helps the scum to rise). When it comes to a boil, take off 
the scum and set the kettle where the soup will just simmer

for ten hours. Then strain into a nice tin, which is kept for 
this purpose, or a stone pot ; set where it will be cold, and 
in the morning skim off all the fat, then turn gently into the 
soup-kettle, being careful not to turn in the sediment. It 
is now ready to make any kind of soup. If you wish to have 
a jelly in the morning, boil it in six quarts of water. You 
can then, after taking off the fat, turn the jelly over, and 
scrape off the sediment. Use the meat for hash. Another 
way to make soup stock, is to cover the bones of roast meats 
with cold water and treat in the same manner. This should 
always be done in boarding-houses and hotels ; but in pri- 
vate families (unless very large), there is not meat enough 
consumed to do this. When making a stock, however, if 
there are any cold bones, they should be used. Professor 
Blot does not recommend boiling ; but I have been more 
successful in obtaining clear soup in this manner than when 
I did not let it boil. I would always boil my stock the 
day before it is used, as by this means only can fat be 
avoided, unless you buy all lean beef, which is very expen- 
sive. Do not boil vegetables with the stock, as they cause 
it to sour quickly. 

Bro-wn Soup. 

Crack the bone of a shank of beef ; take out the marrow and 
lay in the bottom of the soup-kettle ; cut the meat from the 
bones and lay it in the kettle ; set the kettle on the fire and 
brown the meat on all sides, being careful not to burn it. 
When well browned, put in the bones and two quarts of cold 
water, cover tight, and let it simmer one hour ; then put in 



SOUPS. 19 

a stick of cinnamon, eight whole cloves, a few pieces of 
mace, one onion, one carrot, half a turnip and six quarts of 
water. Boil this six hours very gently, strain and set away. 
In the morning skim off the fat and turn the soup into the 
kettle J let it come to a boil ; season to taste with pepper 
and salt ; cut in thin slices one fresh lemon and put into the 
soup and then turn into the tureen. Send to table toasted 
bread, cut into small squares, in a separate dish. Some 
think that half a wine-glass of brandy is an improvement. 

Bro^wn Soup, No. 2. 

Lay the bones from a roast of beef and a roast of mutton 
in the soup-kettle. Cut up one onion, one small turnip, one 
carrot, one parsnip, and lay in the kettle ; then a blade of 
mace, a stick of cinnamon, ten whole cloves, a sprig of pars- 
ley, a sprig of sage, if you have them green, if not, a tea- 
spoonful of each ; now dredge in a cup of flour, a tablespoon- 
ful of salt, half of pepper ; then pour on eight quarts of cold 
water, and boil five hours (skim carefully when it first boils) ; 
then strain through a sieve, and put back into the kettle with 
one cup of sago, and boil one hour and a half Serve with 
toasted bread. Any kind of bones will make this, but beef 
is the best. 

BroTvn Soup, No. 3. 

Take two quarts of stock and boil with one onion, one 
carrot, one turnip, six whole cloves, one blade of mace, one 
stick of cinnamon, for one hour ; then strain into the tureen, 
and serve with toasted bread. 



20 MISS PARLOA S APPLEDORE COOK BOOK. 

Vegetable Soup. 

Cut into strips two inches long and one fourth of an inch 
wide, two carrots, two parsnips, one turnip, and a very small 
piece of cabbage. Cover these with water and boil one 
hour ; then strain them and put in the soup-kettle with three 
quarts of stock ; let this boil up once. Season with pepper 
and salt, and serve. 

Julienne Soup. 

This is made the same as vegetable soup, putting in every 
kind of a green vegetable. It is made in June, July, and 
the first of August. The stock should be very clear. (Omit 
beets.) 

Barley Soup. 

Wash half a cup of pearl barley, and boil it slowly in one 
quart of water three hours ; then turn into the soup-kettle, 
with three quarts of stock ; let this boil up, and season with 
pepper and salt. Serve. 

Sago Soup. 

Make the same as barley, using sago. Two hours will 
cook it. 

Macaroni Soup. 

Made in the same way. 

Vermicelli Soup. 

Made in the same way. 



SOUPS. 21 

Ox-Tail Soup. 

Separate at the joints two ox-tails, put tlioiii on to boil 
with one onion, one carrot (have them whole), a few cloves, 
a blade of mace, and a stick of cinnamon. Boil two hours ; 
then strain the liquor into the soup-kettle, separate the tails 
from the vegetables, and spice, and put them into the kettle ; 
to this add two quarts of stock ; season with pepper and 
salt ; boil up once, and serve. 

Tomato Soup, 

Peel and slice tomatoes enough to fill a two-quart basin ; 

put them into the soup-kettle with six quarts of water and 

two pounds of beef; boil three hours; season with pepper, 

salt, and a spoonful of butter. Strain, and serve with toasted 

bread. 

Giblet Soup. 

Boil the giblets of six fowls in three quarts of water with 
one onion, one carrot, one small turnip, one parsnip, a few 
cloves, a blade of mace, a stick of cinnamon, and two heap- 
ing spoonfuls of flour, for two hours ; then strain into the 
soup-kettle. Add to this two quarts of stock, and let it boil. 
Braid up the livers, chop the hearts and gizzards, and put 
them in the soup. Season with salt and pepper, and serve. 

Turkey Soup. 

Save the liquor in which the turkey was cooked ; the fol- 
lowing morning skim off all the fat ; cut all the meat from 
the part of the turkey which has been left from the dinner 
of the day previous. Put the bones and liquor on to boil 



22 MISS PARLOA S APPLEDORE COOK BOOK. 

with one onion, two parsnips, one small turnip. Boil three 
hours ; then strain, and put back with half a cup of tapioca, 
and some pieces of the cold turkey. Season with pepper 
and salt. Boil two hours longer, stirring often to prevent 
the tapioca from burning. 

Chicken Soup. 

Set the liquor, in which two or three fowls have been 
boiled, away to cool. Skim off the fat, and then put it into 
the soup-kettle with one whole onion and half a cup of rice ; 
boil two hours. Just before dishing take out the onion, and 
put in some pieces of cold chicken. 

White Soup, 

Take any part of veal (the shin is the best), and allow 
one quart of cold water to one pound of veal, and to eight 
pounds allow one onion, three parsnips, one turnip, a stick 
of cinnamon, and a blade of mace. Boil five hours, and 
season with salt and white pepper. When it has boiled four 
hours, thicken with two cups of flour. Boil one hour 
longer ; strain, and serve. 

Beef Soup. 

Boil six pounds of beef in seven quarts of water, with one 
onion, one carrot, one turnip, and eight whole cloves, for 
six hours ; strain, and thicken with half a cup of flour, and 
boil one hour longer, then stir in some of the beef cut into 
small pieces, and serve. 

N. B. Use celery in all kinds of soup when you can 
obtain it. 



SOUPS. 23 

Beef Soup, No. 2. 

Every family should have a soup once a week at least. 
Always save the bones of roast meat for a soup. Take the 
bones of a roast of beef, break them up so that they will go 
into a soup-pot. Lay them in the pot, dredge with salt, 
pepper, and flour. Cut into this one small onion ; add 
three quarts of cold water. Set on the fire, and when it 
comes to a boil, skim it. Let it boil gently three hours, 
then add eight sliced potatoes, and boil twenty minutes. 
Have ready dumplings ; put them in and cover tight, and 
boil ten minutes longer, then dish. First take out the 
dumplings and place in a small platter, then turn the soup 
into a tureen, being careful to take out the bones, and 
serve. 

Mutton Broth. 

Take a shoulder or neck of mutton, cut into small pieces, 
wash, and put into the soup-pot. When it comes to a boil, 
skim it carefully ; then boil gently two hours. To four 
pounds of meat add four quarts of water, and half a cup of 
rice. Do not put in the rice until the meat has boiled two 
hours, then add rice, and season with pepper, salt, and half 
an onion j boil two hours longer, and serve. I will give 
another method, which is better if the soup is the only dish 
for dinner. 

Mutton Broth, No. 2. 

Prepare the meat as for No. i, and to the same quantity 
of meat and water add half an onion, one small white tur- 
nip ; boil two hours, then add one third of a cup of rice ; 



24 MISS PARLOA S APPLEDORE COOK BOOK. 

boil one hour and a half longer, then add six sKced pota- 
toes. Season to taste with pepper and salt. Boil twenty 
minutes, then add the dumplings ; cover tight and boil ten 
minutes, then dish and serve as you would beef soup. 
When preparing the meat for all these kinds of soups, cut 
off all the fat, and fry out for dripping; thus your soup 
will not be greasy, and you will have the fat free from the 
taste of vegetables. 

Dumplings for Soup. 

Take one pint of flour (measured before it is sifted), 
' turn into a sieve, and measure into it one teaspoonful of 
cream of tartar, one half of saleratus, one half of salt, and 
one of sugar. Run this through the sieve, and wet with 
milk ; have the dough stiff enough to roll. Cut into very 
small cakes, and cook ten minutes. But be sure that your 
soup- boils fast enough to get up a good steam, and keep 
boiling while the dumplings are in the pot ; if you do not, 
they will be heavy. Some persons like them for a dessert. 
When used for that purpose, they should be eaten with 
sirup. 

Veal Soup. 

Take four pounds of the neck of veal, cut up small and 
wash clean ; put into the soup-pot and cover with six quarts 
of water ; let this come to a boil, then skim off all the scum ; 
boil two hours, add half a cup of rice, and boil one hour 
longer ; then add one third of a cup of flour mixed with 
water, salt, and pepper. Boil gently one and a half hours, 



SOUPS. 25 

stirring often to prevent burning ; then add a teaspoonful of 
butter, and dumplings made as directed for beef and mut- 
ton soup. Potatoes and onions can be used as for mutton 
broth, No. 2, and some use a little pork to flavor it. 



Pea Soup. 

Pick the peas over, that there may be no blemished ones 
among them. Wash and soak over night. In the morning 
turn off the water and put them in the soup-pot. For one 
quart of peas allow eight quarts of cold water and one pound 
of lean salt pork, a small piece of celery, a little pepper, 
and half an onion ; boil gently eight hours, being very care- 
ful that it does not burn. Have a large wooden spoon to 
stir it with. When done, it should be thin enough to pour. 
In boiling, it may become too thick ; if so, add boiling 
water. When cooked, it is smooth and rather mealy. If 
not cooked enough, after standing a few minutes the thick 
part will settle, and the top look watery. Have ready six 
slices of bread toasted brown, and cut into pieces an inch 
square ; throw about a dozen of these pieces into a tureen, 
and the remainder send to the table dry. Strain the soup 
through a sieve, and serve. If the pork does not salt it 
enough, use salt. This soup is even better warmed over 
than at first. Some persons use soup stock and butter, but 
it seems to me that it is rich enough made in this way, and 
much healthier. 

The bones left from roast lamb, mutton, and veal can all 
be used to make soups the same as those of roast beef.

Mock Turtle Soup. 

Take the brains from a calf s head, and put them in a 
bowl of cold water ; wash the head, and let it stand in a pan 
of cold water two hours ; then put it in the soup-kettle with 
eight quarts of cold water and a shin of veal ; let this boil 
three hours, and then set away to cool over night. In the 
morning cut up the veal and put into the soup-kettle, with a 
stalk of celery, one onion, one carrot, one turnip, two pars- 
nips, three blades of mace, one stick of cinnamon, ten 
cloves, salt, pepper, and two heads of parsley. Cover this 
with three pints of cold water, and boil two hours. Strain 
this, and wash the soup-kettle, then turn the soup back. 
Now skim the fat from stock, and put that into the kettle 
also. Put into the frying-pan two spoonfuls of butter, and 
when it boils up stir in four of dry flour ; stir until a dark 
brown (but not burned), and when the soup boils up stir 
this in. Now braid half of the brains (which you tied in a 
mushn cloth, and boiled with the head), and stir them in. 
Stir in also a spoonful of walnut catsup, one of- mushroom 
catsup, and one of tomato catsup. Boil two hours, and then 
put in the face cut in very small strips, one glass of port 
wine, and one lemon cut into thin slices, and let it boil up 
once, and dish. When in the tureen, put in the egg balls. 
To make the egg balls, boil four eggs ten minutes, drop them 
in cold water, and take out the yolks and pound them in 
the mortar until they are reduced to a paste, then beat them 
with one teaspoonful of salt, a htde pepper, and the white 
of one egg. Make them into round balls the size of a wal- 



SOUPS. 27 

nut, roll them in flour, and fry them brown in butter, being 
careful not to burn them. They are now ready for the soup. 

Oyster Soup. 

Wash one quart of oysters, if they are soHd, in one quart 
of cold water ; if not, one pint of water ; drain the water 
through a cullender into the soup-kettle ; set the kettle on 
the fire, and when the liquor comes to a boil, skim it ; then 
add one quart of rich new milk ; just before it comes to a 
boil, turn in the oysters, and thicken with two spoonfuls of 
corn starch wet with milk ; then stir in half a cup of butter, 
and season with pepper and salt. Let this boil up once, 
and serve immediately. Be very careful that they do not 
burn. A safe way is to boil the milk in a basin, which is 
set into another of water, and then turn it on the oysters 
just before removing it from the fire. 

Mock Bisque Soup, — Very nice. 

Stew one can of tomatoes (one quart can). While the 
tomatoes are stewing, put three pints of milk on to boil, 
setting the basin in which the milk is into another of hot 
water. When the milk comes to a boil, stir in a tablespoon- 
ful of flour which has been thoroughly mixed with a little 
cold milk. Let this boil ten minutes, and then add buttei 
the size of an egg, salt and pepper to taste. The tomatoes 
which were put on at the same time with the milk, are nov 
ready to strain into the mixture. Just before straining, stir 
a pinch of saleratus into the tomatoes to remove the acidity. 
Serve immediately. 




Chov<rder. 



Take either a cod or haddock ; skin it, loosen the skin 
about the head, and draw it down towards the tail, when it 
will peel ofif easily. Then run your knife down the back 
close to the bone, which you take out. Cut your fish in 
small pieces, and wash in cold water. Put the head on to 
boil in about two quarts of water, and boil twenty minutes. 
For a fish weighing six pounds, pare and slice thin five good- 
sized potatoes and one onion. Place a layer of potatoes 
and onion in the pot, then a layer of fish, dredge in a little 
salt, pepper, and flour. Keep putting in alternate layers of 
potatoes and fish until all is used. Use about one table- 
spoonful of salt, one teaspoonful of pepper, one teacup of 
flour, in all. 

Have ready half a pound of salt pork fried brown. Pour 

28 



FISH. 29 

this over the mixture ; add about two quarts of cold water, 
then strain on the water in which the head has been boiled. 
If this is not water enough to cover, add more, cold. Cover 
tight, and boil gently thirty minutes. If not seasoned 
enough, add what you please. When it has boiled twenty 
minutes, put in six crackers which have been soaked three 
minutes in cold water. If you wish to add milk and butter, 
you can do so about five minutes before taking it up ; but 
for my taste, it is much nicer and more natural without 
either. 

Pish Cho-wder. 

Four pounds of fish, half cod and half haddock, if you 
can get the two kinds, two onions, six potatoes, eight white 
browns, one quarter of a pound of salt pork, salt, pepper. 
Prepare the chowder as directed in the preceding rule ; split 
the crackers and lay on the top, pour over the whole hot 
water enough to cover, and boil fifteen minutes ; then wet 
two tablespoonfuls of flour with one third of a cup of cream. 
Stir this into the boihng chowder, let it boil up once, and 
serve. When you cannot get the white browns, pilot bread 
will answer. When a very strong flavor of onion is desired, 
use four onions. 

Clam ChoTvder. 

When intending to have clams in any form, get them in 
the shell if possible, the day before. Place them in a tub, 
and cover with clean water, and throw into this about a 
quart of Indian meal. This fattens them. When ready to 
use the clams, wash them thoroughly, then cover them with 



30 MISS PARLOA S APPLEDORE COOK BOOK. 

boiling water, and let them stand ten minutes and they will 
open easily. Take them from the shell, cut off the black 
heads, and put the bodies of the clams in a clean dish. 
Strain the water in which they were scalded into the kettle 
in which you intend to cook your chowder. To one peck 
of clams allow three quarts of water. Let the water come to 
a boil, then thicken with half a cup of flour which has been 
mixed with cold water, season with pepper and salt. Add 
the clams and a tablespoonful of butter; let it boil ten 
minutes. A few minutes before dishing, drop in three or 
four broken crackers. 

Clam Chowder, No. 2, 

For one peck of clams take six good-sized potatoes, pared 
and sliced thin, half an onion cut into pieces an inch square. 
Fry quarter of a pound of pork to a nice brown ; place the 
pork and gravy, the potatoes and onions, in your kettle. 
Shake over the whole one tablespoonful of salt, two tea- 
spoonfuls of pepper, and half a cup of flour. Strain over 
this four quarts of the water with which you scalded the 
clams. Place on the fire, and boil fifteen minutes, then add 
the clams and four split crackers ; boil ten minutes longer, 

and serve. 

Boiled Cod. 

Take the head and shoulders of a good-sized cod. Scrape 
and wash clean ; rub a handful of salt into it ; flour a cloth 
and pin the fish in it. Put into boiling water, and boil half 
an hour. Take the fish carefully from the cloth, and serve 
with egg sauce. Potato is the only vegetable that is nice 
with boiled cod. 



FISH. 31 

Fried Cod. 

Cut the fish into squares, wash, and wipe dry. Take half 
a cup of flour, half a cup of sifted Indian meal, and a table- 
spoonful of salt. Mix all these thoroughly. Dip the fish 
into the mixture. Have ready a frying-pan with boiling fat, 
half lard and half pork fat, and drop in your fish. Fry a 
dark brown on one side, then turn and fry the same on the 
other side, but be very careful not to let the fish or fat burn. 
Have your dish hot, and lay your fish on it. Garnish the 
sides with the fried pork. 

Broiled Cod, or Scrod. 

Split, wash, and wipe dry a small cod. Rub the gridiron 
with a piece of fat pork, and lay the fish upon it, being 
careful to have the inside downward. If the fish is very 
thick, cook thirty minutes ; but for an ordinary one, twenty 
minutes will be sufficient. Have the dish, in which you in- 
tend serving it, warm ; place it upon the fish, and turn the 
dish and gridiron over simultaneously. If the fish sticks to 
the gridiron, loosen it gently with a knife. Have some 
butter warm, but not melted, with which to season it. Shake 
on a little pepper and salt and send to the table. 

Baked Cod. 

Scrape and wash clean a cod weighing four or five 
pounds. Rub into it a heaping spoonful of salt. Make 
a dressing of three pounded crackers, a httle chopped salt 
pork, about one teaspoonful of parsley, a httle salt and 
pepper, and two tablespoonfuls of cold water. Stuff the 



32 MISS PARLOA S APPLEDORE COOK BOOK. 

belly wth this, and fasten together with a skewer. Lay 
thin slices of pork on the fish, which should be placed on 
a tin sheet that will fit loosely into the baking-pan ; dredge 
with flour. Pour into the pan about half a pint of cold 
water. Baste the fish often while cooking with the water 
which is in the pan. If the water cooks away, add more, but 
do not have too much to begin with, or the fish will be 
boiled instead of being baked. Bake one hour. When 
the fish is cooked, turn the gravy into a bowl, then lift 
out the fish upon the tin sheet (from which you can easily 
slide it into the dish upon which you serve it); now turn 
your gravy into your baking-pan again, and place it on the 
fire ; when it comes to a boil, thicken with a tablespoonful 
of flour, season with pepper and salt. 

N. B. Always use a tin sheet in the baking-pan when 
cooking fish, as you then can preserve the shape. 

Tongues and. Sounds. 

Soak the tongues and sounds in cold water over night. 
Put them in cold water and place on the fire. Let them 
boil thirty minutes, and serve with drawn butter. 

Salt Cod Fish. 

Soak a whole fish in cold water over night ; in the morn- 
ing wash clean, and cut off the tail and fins. If you have 
not a fish-kettle, place it in a large milk pan, which nearly 
fill with water ; cover, and set over a kettle of warm water. 
Let it cook in this way five or six hours. Serve with egg 



• FISH. 33 

sauce and pork scraps. Potatoes, beets, and carrots are the 
vegetables to be served with salt fish. There are but few 
cooks who know how, or, if they do know, who take the 
pains, to get up a nice salt fish dinner ; but those famiHes 
who are so fortunate as to have this dish well served con- 
sider it equal to a turkey dinner ; therefore I shall give 
minute directions for the preparations of it. One of the 
most essential things is to have everything hot. Have all 
your dishes warm, and dish quickly, that all may go to the 
table at once. Serve the fish whole ; garnish the dish with 
a few pieces of beet and carrot. Cut your pork, and fry a 
nice brown. Boil an egg ten minutes, dip it into cold 
water, and peel off the shell. Cut it up with a silver spoon, 
as a knife blackens it, and put into the dish in which you 
intend serving the sauce. To a piece of butter the size of 
an egg, add a tablespoonful of flour. Blend these together 
well, and when the dinner is ready to serve, pour on a 
little less than half a pint of boiling water. Let this come 
to a boil, and pour it upon the egg. Never let drawn but- 
ter boil, as it becomes oily and unpalatable. The fish which 
is left from the dinner will be very nice for hash and fish 
balls. 

Broiled Salt Tish. 

Cut a square the size you desire, from the thickest part 
of the fish. Take off the skin, and wash clean ; broil over 
clear coals ten minutes, then dip in boiling water, butter 
and serve. This is a nice rehsh for breakfast or tea, and 
with boiled potatoes makes an excellent dinner. 



34 MISS parloa's appledcJre cook book. 

Salt Fish in Cream. 

Tear a piece of fish into small strips, wash clean, and 
place it in a basin with about a quart of water ; let it sim- 
mer half an hour. Then pour off the water, and add one 
pint of new milk. When this comes to a boil, thicken with 
one spoonful of flour ; let it boil five minutes, then add 
butter the size of a walnut, and a little pepper, and serve. 

Fish Balls. 

Take the fish left from the dinner, put it in your chop- 
ping tray, being careful that there are no bones in it ; chop 
fine. Pare and boil potatoes enough to have twice the 
quantity of potatoes that you have of fish. When cooked, 
turn them into the tray with the fish ; mash fine, and make 
into balls about the size of an egg. Flour the outside 
lightly ; have the fat boiling hot, and fry a light brown. 
The fat should be half lard and half salt pork. Have 
the slices of pork a nice brown, and serve with the fish 
balls. 

Another Mode. 

Prepare as above; and to a quantity that will make a 
dozen balls add an egg, butter half the size of an egg, salt 
and pepper. Shape and fry as before directed. 

A Third Mode. 

Chop fine one good-sized beet, and mix well with one 
pint bcfwlful of fish and two of potato. Add to this the 



FISH. 35 

pork scraps left from dinner, or, if none have been left, fry 
a few slices of salt pork, and mix the fat with the fish and 
potato. Shape and fry as directed above. 

Fish Hash. 

Prepare the fish as for fish balls ; chop fine cold potatoes, 
and mix with the fish. Fry brown six good slices of salt 
pork ; take out the pork and turn the hash into the frying- 
pan ; add half a cup of boiling water; let this heat slowly, 
stirring often ; then spread smoothly, and brown, being care- 
ful not to let it burn. When brown, fold it as you would an 
omelet, dish, and garnish the dish with the slices of pork. 
Where pork is objected to, butter can be used instead. 

Salt fish, when cooked and chopped, will keep for a week, 
if nothing else is mixed with it. When intending to have 
hash or fish balls for breakfast, the fish should be chopped 
the night before, and the potatoes should be pared and put 
in cold water. Put the potatoes on the fire as soon as it 
begins to burn ; they will then be ready for use when you 
are ready for them. 

Boiled Halibut. 

Pour into a pan about half an inch deep of boiling water ; 
into this lay the side of the halibut on which is the black 
skin ; let this stand a few minutes ; then scrape with a 
knife, when the black will be found to peel off readily. Wash 
clean in cold water, then pin it in your fish-cloth, and drop 
it into boiling water. For a piece weighing four pounds allow 
twenty-five minutes to boil. Serve with drawn butter. 



36 MISS parloa's appledoke cook book. 

Fried Halibut. 

Take a slice of halibut, sprinkle with salt, and dredge 
with flour. Fry four slices of salt pork, add to the pork 
fat one spoonful of lard. When boiling hot put in the 
halibut. Fry a light brown on one side, then turn and fiy 
the same on the other. Serve the pork with it. 

Broiled Halibut. 

Grease the gridiron with a little butter, place the halibut 
upon it, sprinkle a little salt over it, and place over clear 
coals. Cook one side ten minutes, then turn and cook 
upon the other side ten more. Have the dish warm ; put 
the fish upon it, season with pepper and butter, and send to 
the table. 

Smoked Halibut. 

Broiled the same as the fish, omitting the pepper and 
salt. Smoked salmon cooked in the same way. 

Boiled Salmon. 

Salmon is boiled the same as halibut ; served with egg 

sauce. 

Fried Salmon.

FISH. 37 

Baked Cod and Salmon. 

Take a fish weighing eight or nine pounds, wash and dry 
it ; then lay in the pan, and skewer to keep the head and 
tail together. Stufif the belly and eyes with a stuffing made 
of chopped pork, pounded biscuit, sweet herbs, pepper, salt, 
onions, and butter. Sew up the belly, and bake two hours. 
Flour well and baste often. Make the gravy in the following 
manner : stir into one pint of boiling water two spoonfuls of 
flour wet with cold water, one spoonful catsup, a pinch of 
ground mace, half a teaspoon of ground parsley, and a glass 
of red wine ; salt and pepper. Let this boil, and when the 
fish is dished, stir the gravy that is in the pan into the made 
gravy. Add the wine the last thing. Garnish the fish with 
sliced lemon and the yolks of hard boiled eggs. 



Scalloped Fish. 

Skin and cut into small pieces a cod or haddock, and lay 
in a deep earthen dish. Dredge in about half a cup of flour, 
one spoonful of salt, one teaspoonful of pepper. Cut about 
two spoonfuls of butter into small pieces and strew in ; cover 
the whole with new milk and bake forty minutes. 

Salmon Trout. 

When large enough, split down the back, clean, and broil. 
Season with butter and salt. When small, open far enough 
to take out the insides ; wash clean, and wipe dry. Fry the 
same as cod fish. 



38 MISS parloa's appledore cook book. 

Shad and Haddock. 

Shad and haddock can be cooked the same as cod. 

Fresh Mackerel Boiled. ' 

If not cleaned, open them at the gills, take out the insides, 
wash clean, and pin in a fish-cloth. (Do not use the cloth 
that you use to boil mackerel in for any other fish.) Drop 
into boiling water, and boil fifteen minutes. Serve with 
drawn butter. 

Broiled Mackerel. 

Split down the back and clean. Be careful to scrape all 
the thin black skin from the inside. Wipe dry and lay on 
the gridiron ; broil on one side a nice brown, then turn and 
brown the other side ; it will not take so long to brown the 
side on which the skin is. (All fish should have the side on 
which the skin is, turned to the fire last, as the skin burns 
easily, and coals are not so hot after you have used them ten 
minutes.) Season with butter, pepper, and salt. 

Fried Mackerel. 

Fry brown six good-sized slices of pork. Prepare your 
mackerel as for broiling. Take out your pork, sprinkle a 
little salt over the mackerel, then fry a nice brown. Serve 
the fried pork with it. . 

Baked Mackerel. 

Prepare as for boiling. Make a dressing as for baked cod. 
Stuff with this, dredge with salt and flour. Bake thirty min- 



FISH. 39 

utes, basting often with water, butter, and flour. Make a 
gravy with the water in the pan in which the fish is baked. 
Always make the gravy quite salt. The best way to cook 
mackerel is to broil it. 

To Broil and Fry Salt Mackerel. 

Soak over night, and cook the same as fresh. 

Salt Mackerel ill Cream. 

Freshen as for broiled mackerel, then lay into a baking- 
pan, and to one mackerel add half a pint of new milk, put 
into the oven, and bake twenty-five minutes. About five 
minutes before it is dished, add a small piece of butter. 
This is a nice dish for breakfast and dinner. 

To Boil Salt Mackerel. 

Wash the mackerel, and soak over night in clear cold 
water. Put them on to boil in cold water, and boil gently 
thirty minutes. Serve -with drawn butter. 

Smelts. 

The only true way to cook smelts is to fry them, although 
they are sometimes baked. Open them at the gills. Draw 
each smelt separately between your finger and thumb, begin- 
ning at the tail ; this will press the insides out. (Some per- 
sons never take out the insides, but it should be done as 
much as in any other fish.) Wash them clean, and let them 
drain in a cullender; then salt and roll in a mixture half 



40 MISS parloa's appledore cook book. 

flour and half Indian meal. Have about two inches deep 
of boiling fat in the frying-pan (drippings if you have them : 
if not, lard) ; into this drop the smelts, and fry brown. Do 
not put so many in that they will be crowded ; if you do, 
they will not be crisp and brown. 

Brook Trout. 

Brook trout are cooked the same as smelts : or you can 
cook them as the angler does. They must be spht nearly 
to the tail to clean. Wash and drain. For a dozen good- 
sized trout, fry six slices of salt pork ; when brown, take out 
the pork, and put in the trout. Fry a nice brown on all 
sides. Serve the pork with them. 

Oyster Ste^v. 

Drain all the liquor from the oysters ; put it into a porcelain 
kettle and let it come to a boil ; then skim off all the scum. 
Now turn in the milk, which you have let come to a boil in 
hot water. (Allow one quart of milk to one pint of oysters.) 
Stir in also one spoonful of butter or more,, salt and pepper 
to taste. Now put in the oysters, let them boil up once, 
and serve with a dish of oyster crackers. 

To Boil Lobster. 

There are comparatively few who ever have anything to 
do with a lobster until after it has been boiled ; but for the 
benefit of the few I insert this. Be sure that the lobster is 
living ; if not, it is not fit for use. Have a kettle of boiling 



FISH. 41 

water; into this drop the lobster, and boil until the shell 
turns red. This takes about an hour. Take up, and when 
cold it is fit to eat. 



Stewed Lobster. 

Take out all the meat from the shell. Chop it, but not 
fine. Put into a basin with a little salt, pepper, butter, and 
half a cup of water to a small lobster. Stew about ten min- 
utes. 

Curried Lobster. 

Prepare the lobster as for stew ; when it comes to a boil, 
add a mixture of a heaping teaspoonful of flour, and half a 
teaspoonful of Indian curry mixed with cold water. Let 
this boil eight minutes, then serve. 

Eels Fried. 

Skin them ; then turn on boiling water, and let them 
stand in it a few moments ; then cut them into pieces about 
three inches long. Fry a nice brown, and serve. 

Baked Eels. 

Prepare as for frying ; then put into a baking-pan, with a 
little water, flour, pepper, and salt. Bake twenty minutes. 
Make a gravy of the liquor in which they were baked, add- 
ing a little butter. 



42 MISS PARLOA S APPLEDORE COOK BOOK. 

Remarks in Regard to Fish. 

Fish should never stand in water, as it spoils the flavor. 
Fish should' never be fried in butter. It should always be 
used while fresh. Plain boiled or mashed potatoes should 
always be served with it. Squash and green peas go very 
well with fish also. Always save all that remains after a 
meal, and warm up, to help out another dish. The remains 
of boiled fresh fish can be warmed up in a little butter, 
pepper, salt, and water, as you would stew lobster. Cold 
fried and broiled fish can be placed in a tin pan, and set 
into the oven ten minutes, when it will be found to be hot 
enough. Fish balls can be steamed for ten or fifteen min- 
utes, and then set into the oven to get crisp. If you have 
a large piece of boiled fish, which you wish to serve whole, 
place it on a plate, and set into the steamer, and steam 
twenty minutes. If you have drawn butter to warm up, do 
not set it on the fire, but put it into a bowl, and set the bowl 
into hot water. Cook butter as little as possible, as by cook- 
ing it becomes oily. When you do use it, always add it 
three or five minutes before taking the dish from the fire. 




Boiled Corned Beef. 



Wash a piece of beef weighing ten pounds ; put it into two 
gallons of cold water ; when it comes to a boil, skim care- 
fully and boil very slowly six hours. Some boil all kinds of 
vegetables in the same pot ; but there is this objection to 
this method ; you lose the distinctive flavor of each vegeta- 
ble, and the beef is flavored with the vegetables, which is 
very unpleasant when it is cold. The vegetables to serve 
with corned beef are potatoes, cabbage, beets, turnips, 
parsnips, carrots. When the beef is simply for one hot din- 
ner, the part of the beef is not of so much consequence ; 
but when it is to be pressed, there should be care taken in 
the selection of the piece to boil. The brisket, the flank, 

43 



44 MISS parloa's appledore cook book. 

and the thin part of the ribs are the best parts to press. 
Boil as before directed, and take out the bones, lay the meat 
on a large platter, and place a tin sheet upon it ; on the 
sheet place a weight, and set in a cool place. When ready 
to use it, trim the edges and use the trimmings for meat 
hash. This makes a nice dinner with baked potatoes, 
squash, turnip, and macaroni. 

Boiled Salt Tongue. 

Soak the tongue over night ; in the morning put on to 
boil in six quarts of cold water, and boil slowly six hours if 
the tongue is large ; if not, five will answer. Take it from 
the boiling water and throw it into cold water, and peel the 
skin off. Set away to cool. For dinner use the same vege- 
tables as for cold corned beef. The roots will make a nice 
hash. 

Boiled Fresh Tongue. 

Wash, and put into four quarts of boiUng water, with a 
large handful of salt. Boil slowly six hours, if large. When 
done, throw into cold water, and skin the same as the salt 
tongue. The water in which all meats are boiled should be 
saved until cold, and the fat should be taken off and clari- 
fied. The liquor should never stand in iron kettles, as it 
rusts them. 

Boiled Flank of Beef. 

This is a part of the beef that many persons think almost 
useless ; but by being properly prepared it makes an elegant 
dish. Wash the flank, and make a dressing as for turkey. 



MEATS. 45 

and spread over it, first having salted and peppered it well, 
then roll up and tie. Wind the twine round it several 
times to keep it in' place ; then sew in a cloth kept for that 
purpose. Put a small plate in the pot, and put in the meat ; 
then pour on about six quarts of boiling water, and boil 
gently six hours. When done, remove the cloth, but not the 
twine until stone cold ; then cut into thin slices, and you 
will have alternate layers of meat and dressing. This is a 
very nice dish for breakfast or tea. 

Boiled Ham. 

Have a coarse hair brush for cleaning hams, as it is 
impossible to get them clean by simply washing them. If 
the ham will not fit in the pot, cut off the knuckles, which 
will cook in two hours. Cover with cold water, and boil. 
A ham weighing twelve pounds will require five hours. 
When cooked, take up and put into a baking-pan, to skin. 
Have a basin of cold water, into which dip the hands ; then 
take the skin between the fingers, and peel as you would an 
orange. Roll a cracker and sift it over the ham, then set in 
the oven thirty minutes. Save the liquor in which it has 
been boiled, and skim the fat for soap grease. 

Roast Ham. 

Prepare the ham as for boiling, and if good-sized (say ten 
pounds), boil three hours. Take off the skin and place in 
a baking-pan. Let it cook in a moderate oven two hours, 
and serve with champagne sauce. 



46 MISS parloa's appledore cook book. 

With one tablespoonful of butter mix thoroughly one 
tablespoonful of flour. Set the sauce-pan on the fire and 
stir constantly until it is a dark brown ; then pour into it half 
a pint of boiling gravy (the liquor in which pieces of green 
meat have been boiling until it is very rich). Pour the 
gravy in slowly, and stir slowly and constantly. Let it boil 
up once, season well with pepper and salt, and strain. Add 
half a cup of champagne and serve. 

Boiled Leg of Mutton. 

Take a leg weighing eight pounds, and put into six quarts 
of boiling water ; throw into this half a cup of rice. In a 
few minutes a scum will rise, which must be skimmed off 
carefully. Boil one hour and a quarter ; allow five minutes 
more for every pound over eight. This time will allow the 
blood to run, which should always be the case with mutton. 
Serve with caper sauce. The rice gives it a white look. 
Serve with this plain boiled potatoes, turnips, and onions. 
Save the liquor in which the meat was boiled, for soup. 

Boiled Shoulder of Mutton. 

Cooked and served the same as the leg. 

Boiled Leg or Shoulder of Lamb. 

For a leg or shoulder weighing six pounds, allow an hour 
and twenty minutes, and for every pound over that allow 
ten minutes. Serve with drawn butter or mint sauce. Serve 
with it green peas, potatoes, white turnips.. If asparagus or 



MEATS. 47 

spinach is in season, substitute for turnips. Save the liquor 
for soup. Lamb, however, is always nicer roasted. 

Boiled Veal. 

Take out the bone from a shoulder of veal, and fill the 
cavity with a dressing made as for poultry; then fasten 
together with a skewer; wind twine around it, and tie 
tight. Put this into a ketde with about a pound of lean salt 
pork, and cover with boiling water. Boil slowly four hours, 
if it weighs ten pounds. Serve with celery sauce, or M'ith a 
gravy made with one pint of the liquor in which it has been 
boiled, thickening with one heaping spoonful of flour, salt, 
pepper, and a little butter. Serve with boiled potatoes, 
macaroni and cheese, and horseradish. Save the Uquor in 
which it has been boiled, to use next day in making a pie 
with what remains from the dinner. 

Boiled Turkey. 

Singe and wash the turkey, then rub into it a handful of 
salt ; stuff it with a dressing made by directions given under 
"Dressing for Poultry." Sew up and put into boiling water, 
enough to cover it. For one weighing ten pounds allow two 
hours' boiling, and fifteen minutes for every added pound. 
Serve with oyster or celery sauce, mashed potatoes, mashed 
turnips, boiled parsnips, plain boiled macaroni. Save the 
liquor for a soup. Sometimes a turkey will be very old and 
tough, in which case it will require a longer time to boil ; 
but a little practice and observation will help every house- 
keeper to understand when to allow more or less time for 
boiling. Truss the same as for roasting. 



48 MISS parloa's appledore cook book. 

Boiled Fowl and Pork. 

Singe, draw out the inwards, being careful to take out the 
hghts and crop. Cut open the gizzard and clean. Wash 
the fowls and put them, with the hearts, livers, and gizzards, 
into boiling water, in which about one pound of pork has 
been boiling three hours. If they are young and tender, 
one hour and a quarter will cook one weighing three pounds. 
If old and tough, they sometimes take three hours. Truss 
the same as turkey. Serve with drawn butter. Dish the 
pork with the fowls. A little rice boiled in the water gives 
them a white appearance. Serve with them mashed turnip, 
mashed potatoes, boiled parsnips or green peas, corn or 
spinach when in season. Save the liquor for soup. 

Roast Beef. 

Meats roasted in a tin kitchen require a longer time to 
cook than in an oven, but they are very much nicer cooked 
in the former. Wring a clean towel out of cold water, and 
wipe the meat with it (if possible, never wash beef, as by 
this means a great deal of juice is lost) ; then rub into it a 
handful of salt, and dredge with flour. If cooked in a tin 
oven, run the spit through it. See that the spit is as near 
through the middle as possible ; if not it will be difficult to 
turn it. Dredge flour into the kitchen, and when brown 
put in a pint of hot water. Cook a piece of beef-Weighing 
eight pounds an hour and twenty minutes, if you wish it 
rare ; if not, cook twenty minutes longer. Baste often with 
pepper, salt, flour, and the water in the bottom of the 



MEATS. 49 

kitchen, and turn often. Ten minutes before dishing the 
dinner, turn the gravy into a basin, and skim off all the 
fat; let it come to a boil, and thicken with one large table- 
spoonful of flour mixed with cold water ; season with salt 
and pepper. Serve with mashed potatoes, squash, boiled 
rice, and pickled beets. When baked in the oven, one hour 
will be sufficient for a piece weighing eight pounds. Place 
a grate in the baking-pan, and upon the grate lay the meat. 
Into the pan pour a pint of warm water ; watch carefully 
that the water does not boil away and the gravy become 
burned. Add but little water at a time, for if there is too 
much, the meat will be steamed instead of roasted, and also 
the gravy will not become brown. Baste as when roasted 
in a tin oven. Make the gravy as before directed. 

Roast Mutton. 

Take out the first joint from a leg of mutton ; ask the 
butcher to do it when you order it. Wash, and rub into it 
a handful of salt. Cut it around the bone, so as to make the 
cavities as large as possible, and fill with a dressing made in 
the following manner : Soak in cold water about two quarts 
of pieces of stale bread. When soft, drain in a cullender; 
then mix with this half an onion which has been chopped 
very fine, one teaspoonful of pepper, one tablespoonful of 
salt, one egg, butter the size of an egg, and one tablespoon- 
ful of summer savory. Fasten together with a skewer, then 
dredge with salt and flour, and roast the same as beef For 
a piece weighing ten pounds allow one hour and a half, and 



so MISS PARLOA S APPLEDORE COOK BOOK. 

ten minutes for every pound over or under that. Skim all 
the fat from the gravy ; for half a pint allow one tablespoon- 
ful of flour to thicken with ; season with pepper and salt. 
Put one tablespoonful of currant jelly into the gravy tureen, 
and strain the gravy upon it. Serve vs^ith mashed potatoes, 
boiled onions, boiled rice or macaroni, mashed turnip, cur- 
rant jelly. 

AVhen the tin kitchen is used, it will require half an hour 
longer to roast. The shoulder and saddle are cooked in the 
same way. Always make a dressing for mutton ; it spends 
much better, and the trouble is not much. Omit the egg if , 
you please. When you do not stuff it, cook it in twenty 
minutes' less time. 

Roast Lamb. 

Take a leg of lamb weighing six pounds, wash, and dredge 
with salt and flour. Cook one hour if in an oven, one and 
a quarter if in a tin kitchen. Baste often. Make the gravy 
the same as for mutton, omitting the jelly. Serve with 
mashed potatoes, green peas, fried parsnips, or green corn, 
string beans, summer squash, mint sauce. Never omit the 
gravy because you have mint sauce. All other parts of the 
lamb can be roasted in the same way. 

Roast Veal. 

The loin, breast, and fillet are the best parts for roasting ; 
the neck also is good to roast. Wash the veal, and rub into 
it a good handful of salt. Make a dressing in the following 
manner, and stuff it : Soak about two quarts of stale bread 



MEATS. 5 1 

in cold water, chop fine half a pound of clear fat pork. Mix 
this with the bread and one teaspoonful of pepper, one of 
salt, one tablespoonful of sweet marjoram, one of sage, one 
egg or two rolled crackers. Take out all the bones possible, 
and cut sKts to make cavities for the dressing ; then stuff 
and skewer securely ; dredge with salt, pepper, and flour. 
Have thin slices of salt pork, which lay on the top of the 
veal. Cook a piece weighing twelve pounds five hours, 
and baste veiy often. I should always roast veal in the 
oven. Make the gravy as for roast beef, but do not strain. 
If possible, always cook a large piece of veal, because so 
many nice dishes can be made from cold roast veal. Serve 
mashed potatoes, spinach, asparagus, fried parsnips, horse- 
radish. 

Roast Pork. 

Wash and dredge a spare-rib with salt, pepper, sage, and 
flour ; and roast the same as beef. Cook a spare-rib weigh- 
ing ten pounds three hours, if cooked in a tin kitchen ; if in 
the oven two hours and a half. Have the oven moderately 
hot. The chine to be cooked in the same way, allowing one 
hour longer for a piece weighing the same as a spare-rib. 
Make the gravy as directed for roast beef. Serve potatoes, 
squash, fried or boiled onions, boiled rice, mashed turnips, 
apple-sauce. 

Broiled Beefsteak. 

Cut the steak about three quarters of an inch thick. 
Have a clear fire and lay the steak on the gridiron, and 
dredge lightly with flour. If you desire the steak rare. 



' 52 MISS parloa's appledore cook book. 

cook ten minutes ; if well done, fifteen. Dish and season 
with butter, pepper, and salt. Serve immediately. Never 
set steak into the oven to keep warm or to melt the butter. 
The dish must be hot, the butter stand in a warm room 
long enough to soften but do not melt. If for dinner, serve 
potatoes, either baked or boiled, and any other vegetable 
which you choose. Many persons pound tough steak 
before cooking, but I would not recommend it, as by this 
means it looses much of its juiciness. 

There are some families in the country who have no 
means of broiling. The next best thing such persons can 
do is to heat the frying-pan very hot, and grease with just 
enough butter to prevent the steak from sticking ; then lay 
the steak in, and cook, and serve as before directed. 

Fried Beefsteak. 

For two pounds of steak fry brown four slices of salt 
pork, then take up the pork and fry the steak in the fat ; 
salt and pepper it. When you dish add a little butter. To 
the fat remaining in the frying-pan, after the steak has been 
cooked, add one tablespoonful oi dry flour (be sure to have 
the fat boiling) , and stir until it is brown and there are no 
lumps, then pour in about half a cup of boiling water. 
Season well with pepper and salt. Serve in a gravy tureen. 
This is a more economical, but not so healthful a method 
as broiling. 

Beefsteak Smothered iu Onions. 

Fry brown four slices of salt pork; when brown take 
out the pork, and put in six onions sliced thin. Fry about 



MEATS. 53 

ten minutes, stirring all the while ; then take out all except 
a thin layer, and upon this lay a slice of steak, then a layer of 
onions, then steak, and cover thick with onions. Dredge 
each layer with pepper, salt, and flour. Pour over this one 
cupful of boiling water, and cover tight. Simmer half an 
hour. When you dish, place the steak in the centre of the 
dish, and heap the onions around it. Serve the same vege- 
tables as for broiled steak. 

Italianed Beef. 

Broil the steak as before directed ; place in the dish and 
cover with onions prepared in the following manner : Slice 
very thin four good-sized onions, and fry in pork fat thirty 
minutes, then add half a cup of boiling water, cover tight, 
and simmer thirty minutes longer. While frying, season 
with pepper, salt, and a little butter. Vegetables the same 
as for broiled steak. 

StevB-ed Beef. 

Take a piece of beef that is rather tough, or pieces of 
tough beefsteak ; rub into it a handful of salt, some pepper 
and flour; lay in a kettle that you can cover tight, and 
that has a flat bottom. Cut up an onion, a potato, a small 
turnip, a carrot and a parsnip ; lay these on the top of the 
meat and then sprinkle in half a teaspoonful of cinnamon, 
half of mace, one fourth of clove, and add cold water 
enough to cover it. Let it come to a boil, skim off all the 
scum, then cover tight, and simmer five hours. After it 
has been boiling four hours, mix half a cup of flour with 



54 MISS parloa's appledore cook book. 

cold water and add to it. You can then taste it, and add 
more seasoning if necessary. The spice may be omitted il 
you choose. Serve the meat in a little of the gravy, and 
send the remainder of the gravy to the table in the gravy 
tureen. Serve plain boiled potatoes, boiled rice, and 
pickled beets. 

Fricassee of Beef. 

Put one pint of water into a frying-pan, and when it 
comes to a boil, thicken with one heaping spoonful of flour ; 
season with salt, pepper, and a Httle butter. Cut cold roast 
beef into slices, and put into this gravy, and let them boil 
five minutes. If there be any cold beef gravy, add it to the 
other, in which case you will not need quite so much but- 
ter. Serve boiled potatoes, tomatoes, boiled rice or maca- 
roni, and squash. 

Mutton Chops. 

Cut the chops from the loin or the neck ; broil as you do 
beefsteak, and serve in hot dishes. Serve mashed potatoes, 
stewed tomatoes, boiled onions, and boiled rice. 

Mutton Pie with Tomatoes. 

Pare and slice six tomatoes ; put a layer into a deep 
pudding dish, then put in a layer of slices of cold mutton, 
and dredge in flour, salt, and pepper. Have the last 
layer tomatoes, over which sprinkle two rolled crackers. 
Bake one hour. Serve boiled potatoes, boiled rice, green 
corn, shelled beans. 



MEATS. 55 

Mutton Pie, Plain. 

Take the cold mutton that has remained from a former 
dinner, cut into thin shces, put into a pudding dish, and 
season with pepper and salt. Mix two tablespoonfuls of 
flour with cold water, then pour on to this one pint of 
boiling water, and season with pepper and salt, then pour 
this over the meat. Make a paste by rule for plain pie- 
crust, and cover it. Bake one hour. Vegetables the same 
as for pie with tomatoes, with the addition of stewed 
tomatoes. 

Mutton Fricassee. 

Mutton fricassee is made the same as beef. Heap the 
meat in the centre of the dish, and garnish the sides with 
boiled rice. Send to the table very hot. Serve mashed 
potatoes, mashed turnips, baked tomatoes, and shelled 
beans. 

Haricot of Mutton. 

Take cold mutton (either boiled or roasted), cut into 
shces, and lay in a deep sauce-pan, and then put in one 
fourth of an onion, the same of turnip, and two potatoes and 
one carrot, all cut into small pieces. Dredge with flour, salt, 
and pepper. Cover with cold water, and boil slowly one 
hour j then add two spoonfuls of flour mixed with cold water, 
and boil one hour longer. Have a dish ready with an edg- 
ing of mashed potatoes (brown them or not, as you please), 
and into the centre of the dish turn the haricot. Serve 
mashed potatoes, boiled rice, mashed turnips and carrots. 



S6 MISS parloa's appledore cook book. 

Minced Mutton. 

Take all the fat from cold mutton, and then put it into 
the chopping-tray ; dredge well with salt, pepper, and flour, 
and then chop (do not chop it very fine) ; then put into 
a sauce-pan, and to two pounds of meat allow one cup of 
boiling water and a spoonful of butter. Let it boil gently 
fifteen minutes, and dish on toast. This is a nice dish for 
breakfast or dinner. 

Lamb Chops. 

Broil fifteen minutes over clear coals. Season with butter, 
pepper, and salt. 

Broiled Veal.- 

Cut veal into thin slices and broil twenty minutes. Sea- 
son with butter, pepper, and salt. This is the most unsavory 
method of cooking veal, and I would not recommend it. 

Fricassee of Veal. 

Fry eight slices of salt pork brown. Take out the pork 
and put in thin slices of vea] which have been cut from the 
leg. Sprinkle with salt and pepper, and fry brown. When 
all the veal is fried, mix with the boihng fat two tablespoon- 
fuls of dry flour ; stir until there are no lumps, and the flour 
is brown ; then add two cups of boiling water, and season with 
salt and pepper. Lay the veal in this gravy, and simmer fif- 
teen minutes. Dish, and pour the gravy over the meat. If 
for dinner, garnish with boiled rice, and serve plain boiled 
potatoes, spinach, and horseradish. 



MEATS. 57 

Veal Cutlets. 

Fry brown eight slices of salt pork. Take them up, and 
add to the fat two large spoonfuls of lard or drippings. Have 
ready thin slices of veal (they are best cut from the leg), dip 
them in an egg which has been well beaten, then into cracker 
crumbs, and fry a nice brown. Season them, before dipping 
in the egg and cracker, with pepper and salt. Serve with 
the salt pork. If for dinner, serve mashed potatoes, boiled 
or stewed parsnips, and horseradish. 

Veal Loaf. 

Take three and a half pounds of veal from the leg and chop 
it very fine ; add six powdered crackers, half a pound of salt 
pork chopped fine, and two eggs well-beaten. Season with 
tablespoonful of salt, one teaspoonful black pepper, half a 
teaspoonful of allspice, one half of ground clove, half a small 
onion chopped fine ; sage or sweet marjoram may be used 
instead of onion, if preferred. Knead all this together and 
make it into a loaf, and place it on a tin sheet. Beat one egg 
and pour it over the loaf; put bits of butter on the top, and 
sift over it half a pound of crackers. Take half a teacup of 
hot water, add a piece of butter the size of a nutmeg, and 
with this baste the loaf three or four times while baking. 
Bake two hours. When cold cut in thin slices, and serve for 
either breakfast or tea. 

Veal on Toast. 

Chop the veal as for mutton. Mince and season in the 
same manner. Use a httle more water, and boil fifteen

minutes ; dish on toast, and garnisli with thin slices of 
lemon. This is a nice dish for either dinner or breakfast. 

Veal Croquettes. 

Chop cold veal fine (boiled is the nicest), season with 
pepper and salt, and to a quart of veal, after it is chopped, 
add half a cup of warm water (when chopping the veal, 
dredge in flour as for veal on toast) . Form this into egg 
shapes about the size of an egg, and dip into a well-beaten 
egg, then roll in cracker crumbs, and fry, as you would 
doughnuts, in hot lard. 

Pork Steak. 

Cut pork steak quite thin, and sprinkle with salt, pepper, 
and a little powdered sage. Put a spoonful of drippings or 
lard in the pan, and lay the pork in it ; fry slowly fifteen min- 
utes. Always be sure that the meat is cooked until white at 
the centre ; if it has a pink appearance, it is not done. If 
for dinner, serve boiled potatoes, squash, boiled onions, and 
apple-sauce. 

Fried Salt Pork. 

Cut salt pork into slices a quarter of an inch thick, cut off 
the rind, and then pour over them boiling water, in which 
let them stand ten minutes ; then turn off" the water, and fry 
until they are brown on both sides. 

Broiled Salt Pork. 

Prepare as for fried, and broil ten minutes over clear 
coals. 



MEATS. 59 

Salt Pork Fried in Batter. 

Fry the pork as before directed ; dip in batter, and fry in 
the pork fat, to which should be added two spoonfuls of 
drippings or lard. Make the batter in the following man- 
ner : Mix gradually with one cup of flour, one cup of milk, 
and then add one well-beaten egg and a little salt. This 
makes a pleasant change in the country, where it is so difficult 
to get fresh meat. Serve potatoes and any other vegetable 
that you please. 

Fried Sausages. 

Cut the sausages apart and wash them ; then lay them in 
the pan and pour boiling water over them ; let them boil 
two minutes, then turn off the water and prick the sausages 
with a fork, or they will burst open when they begin to fry. 
Put a little drippings in the pan with them, and fry twenty 
minutes. Turn them often that they may be brown on all 
sides. Cut stale bread into fanciful shapes, fry in the sau- 
sage fat, and garnish the dish with it. Brown bread is de- 
hcious fried in this way. Serve plain boiled potatoes, squash, 
mashed turnips, and apple-sauce. 

Broiled Sausages. 

Scald as for fried, and broil as you would any other kind 
of meat. Sausages that are kept a long time become dry 
and hard ; they are very much improved by covering them 
with boiling water in which half a teaspoonful of saleratus 
has been dissolved, and boiling twenty minutes before frying 
them.

Pigs' Feet Soused. 

Scrape and wash the pigs' feet. Clean them, cover them 
with salt and water, and let them stand two days ; then turn 
this water off, and cover again with fresh salt and water ; let 
them stand two days longer, then boil about two hours. 
When cold, split them, and pour over them boiling vinegar, 
in which there have been thrown a few whole cloves, a piece 
of stick cinnamon, and a handful of salt. They will be ready 
for use in twenty-four hours. 

Fried Pig-s' Feet. 

Put into the frying-pan four spoonfuls of drippings or lard, 
and when this boils, lay in the feet, first having dredged them 
with flour, and fry brown. Serve on hot dishes. They can 
be fried before or after being soused. Never season them 
with butter. 

Pigs' Feet Fried in Batter. 

Take the feet from the vinegar and drain them, then dip 
them in a batter made as for pork, and fry in either drip- 
pings or lard. 

Pig's Head Cheese. 

Boil a pig's head until the bones will drop out. When 
cold, chop fine and season highly with pepper, salt, and 
sage ; then put it into a kettle, and to every quart of meat 
add one half pint of the liquor in which it was boiled. Sim- 
mer this slowly for half an hour, and turn it into deep 
earthen dishes, and on top place a plate with a weight upon

it. Set in a cool place, and when cold cut in slices. If 
there is any danger of its not keeping, scald it over. Many 
persons put spice in it, but it is more natural without. 

Pried Ham. 

Cut the ham in very thin slices, and cut off the rind. 
Have half a spoonful of boiling drippings in the frying-pan, 
lay the ham in this, and fry quickly eight minutes ; it will 
then be brown and crisp. Where the ham is for dinner, 
have the slices larger and thicker, and if you do not have 
eggs with it, fry bread, as directed for sausages. 

Broiled Ham. 

Cut the ham in thin slices ; cut off the rind, and broil 
over clear coals ten minutes. Butter or not, as you please. 
When the ham is very salt or hard, slice, and let stand in 
boiling water ten minutes before frying or broiling. 

Ham and Sggs. 

Fry the ham as before directed, and when the ham is all 
fried, turn the fat into a basin, and scrape the salt from the 
frying-pan ; turn back the fat, and add to it half a cup of 
lard. When this comes to a boil, break in your eggs, leav- 
ing room to turn them, if you prefer them turned ; they look 
much nicer, however, when they are not turned. If they are 
not turned, dip up the boiHng fat while they are cooking and 
pour over them ; they will cook rare in three minutes, well 
done in four. Lay them on the slices of ham, and serve.

Fried Liver. 

Cut either beef or pork liver into slices about half an inch 
thick, and pour boiling water over them, in which let them 
stand twenty minutes ; then drain, and dredge with flour, 
salt, and pepper. Fry six slices of pork brown ; take them 
up, and in the fat fry the liver fifteen minutes. Serve the 
pork with it. 

Broiled Liver. 

Prepare as for frying, and broil fifteen minutes over clear 
coals. Season with butter, salt, and pepper. When for din- 
ner, serve boiled or baked potatoes, squash, and macaroni. 

Boiled Tripe. 

Wash a tripe clean (it must be washed in several waters), 
and boil ten hours. Turn it often, as it is apt to stick to the 
bottom. After it has boiled seven hours, throw a cupful of 
salt into the boiler with it. When eaten plain boiled, cut 
up in squares, and serve with seasoning of salt, pepper, and 
butter. 

Broiled Tripe. 

Cut the tripe after it has become cold into handsome 

squares ; grease the gridiron, and broil ten minutes. Season 

with salt, pepper, and butter. Serve on very hot dishes. If 

you buy tripe, get the honeycomb, as that is the nicest part 

of it. 

Fried Tripe. 

Cut into handsome squares, and dredge with salt, pepper^ 
and flour, and fry a light brown, in either drippings or lard. 



MEATS. 63 

Soused Tripe. 

Cut the tripe into squares, and lay them in an earthen 
pot, and pour over them boiling vinegar enough to cover, in 
which a blade of mace, a dozen whole cloves, and a stick of 
cinnamon have been boiled. It will be ready for use in 
twelve hours, and will keep several weeks. Soused tripe 
may be either broiled, or fried plain or in batter. 

Tripe Fried in Batter. 

Drain the tripe, and make a batter as for pigs' feet ; dip 
the tripe in this, and fry in hot drippings or lard. Tripe is 
nice cooked in this manner, either before or after it has been 
soused. 

Calf's Head aud Pluck. 

Take out the brains, and lay them in a dish of cold water. 
Scrape the head and wash, then lay in a tub of cold water 
two hours ; then put into a pot with two gallons of cold 
water. Tie the brains in a cloth, and boil with the head. 
When it comes to a boil, skim carefully. When it has boiled 
two hours, put in the heart, liver, and feet, and boil two 
hours longer. When you dish, take the bones from the 
head, and place it in the centre of the dish. Cut some 
slices from the heart and liver, and place around the head. 
Split the feet, and lay on the edge of the dish. Serve with 
brain sauce. To make the brain sauce, braid together the 
brains, half a teacup of flour, one teaspoonful of pepper, 
two of salt, one of parsley, one of summer savory. Pour 
on this one pint and a half of boiling water, and let it boil 



64 MISS parloa's appledore cook book. 

twenty minutes, then add one cup of butter and the juice of 
two lemons, and boil five minutes longer. You may omit 
the herbs if you choose. A piece of salt pork boiled with 
the head and pluck is an improvement, but it is not neces- 
sary. The tongue is nice cut in thin sUces and served cold. 
The heart, liver, and head make a nice hash. Save the 
liquor to make soup, which may be made plain or mock 
turtle. 

Hash Made from Calf's Head and Pluck. 

Chop together parts of the head, liver, and heart, in the 
proportion of one third each. Season with pepper, salt, a 
little fresh lemon or a little vinegar. Warm in just enough 
of the liquor in which it was boiled to moisten it. Just 
before dishing stir in a little butter. Serve on toast. 

Meat Hash. 

Chop fine any kind of cold meat (before choppmg dredge 
with salt and pepper. This is always the best manner of 
seasoning hash, as by this means all parts will be seasoned 
alike). If you have cold potatoes, chop fine and mix with 
the meat ; if they are hot, mash. Allow one third meat to 
two thirds potato. Put this mixture in the frying-pan with 
a little water to moisten it, and stir in a spoonful of butter, 
or, if you have nice beef drippings, use that instead of but- 
ter. Heat slowly, stirring often, and when warmed through, 
cover and let it stand on a moderately hot part of the stove 
or range twenty minutes. When ready to dish, fold as you 
would an omelet, and dish. 

Save all the trimmings and pieces that are left of all 



MEATS. 65 

kinds of meat, and have a hash once or twice a week. 
It does not hurt a hash to have different kinds of meat 
in it. Avoid having a hash (or indeed any other part of 
your cooking) greasy. It is a great mistake to think that 
seasoning anything highly with butter improves it ; on the 
contrary, it often ruins it by disguising the natural flavor, 
and giving you an unhealthy dish. I have nothing to 
say against a moderate use of butter in cooking, but I 
do strongly protest against the immoderate use of it in 
soups, gravies, hashes, stews, and on meats and fish of all 
kinds. I do not know of one kind of soup that is improved 
by the addition of butter. 

When you let steak stand in the oven or on the hearth 
a few minutes after buttering, you will find that the butter 
has become oily, and you have the true flavor of neither 
the meat nor butter, but an unpleasant oily flavor. I have 
given only the simplest modes of cooking meats in this 
department, and many may think, perhaps, that I have been 
too minute ; but I have not forgotten the time when these 
little hints, as how to put things together, as well as the 
quantities and kinds to take, would have been of untold 
value to me ; and I know that every day there are young 
housekeepers, and young girls who have to work in young 
housekeepers' kitchens, who need just these hints to make 
the simplest dishes what they should be. 

To Sweeten Tainted Meat. 
Cover the meat with sweet milk, and let it stand an hour 
or two, and, unless the meat is very bad, it will make it 
perfectly sweet. Soaking in saleratus water is also good. 




To Clean Poultry. 

First singe over blazing paper or alcohol; then cut off 
the feet and tips of the wings, and the neck as far as it looks 
dark ; then, with the blade of a knife, take out all the pin- 
feathers ; now turn the skin of the neck back, and with the 
fore-finger and thumb draw out the crop and wind-pipe j cut 
a slit in the lower part of the fowl, and draw out the intestines, 
being careful not to break the gall-bag, as it will spoil the 
flavor of the meat. It will be found near the upper part 
of the breast-bone and attached to the liver. Now wash 
thoroughly in several waters, and drain. If the poultry is at 
all strong, let it stand in water several hours, with either 
charcoal or saleratus. Split the gizzard, and take out the 
inside and inner lining; wash and put on to boil in two 
quarts of cold water (this is for the gravy) .

POULTRY. 67 

Roast Turkey. 

Prepare as directed ; make a dressing with six pounded 
crackers, one teaspoonful of pepper, one tablespoonful of 
salt, one of sage, one of summer savory, one of parsley, two 
eggs, butter the size of an egg, and cold water to moisten ; 
stuff the turkey with this ; stuff the breast first, and the 
remainder put in the body. Now cross and tie the legs 
down tight ; run a skewer through the wings, fastening them 
to the body ; fasten the neck under the body with a skewer, 
and tie all with a twine. Rub the turkey with salt, and spit 
it ; baste often with the drippings and flour, and occasionally 
with butter. About fifteen minutes before dishing baste with 
butter, and dredge on a little flour ; this will give it a frothy 
appearance. For eight pounds, allow one hour and three 
quarters, if roasted in the tin kitchen ; if in the oven, one 
hour and a half, and fifteen minutes for every pound more 
or less. Serve with giblet gravy and cranberry sauce. 

To make the gravy : Boil the heart, gizzard, liver, and 
neck in two quarts of water two hours ; then take them up 
and chop the gizzard and heart ; braid the liver and put 
them back again; thicken with one spoonful of flour wet 
with cold water; season with salt and pepper. Let this 
simmer one hour longer, and when you dish the turkey turn 
the drippings into this gravy ; boil up once, and send to the 
table. Make all the gravy for poultry in this manner, 
omitting the chopped gizzards in chicken gravy. 



68 MISS parloa's appledore cook book. 

Roast Chicken. 

Prepare, stuff, and truss the same as turkey. A pair of 
chickens, weighing each two and a half pounds, will require 
an hour and a quarter to roast if in the tin kitchen ; one 
hour if in the oven. 

Roast G-oose. 

Prepare, as directed for poultry, and stuff the body with 
a dressing made in the following manner : Pare and boil 
potatoes ; mash them and mix with one fourth of an onion 
chopped fine, one spoonful of sage, one of salt, one tea- 
spoonful of pepper, a small piece of butter. Truss, and 
roast (if it weighs ten pounds) one hour and three quarters 
if in the tin kitchen, but if in the oven one hour and a half. 
Make the gravy as for turkey, and serve with apple-sauce. 

Skim off all the fat before putting the drippings in the 
gravy. 

Roast Duck. 

Prepare the dressing as for goose, and roast before a hot 
fire forty minutes, or if in the oven have it very hot and 
roast thirty minutes. Serve with either apple-sauce or cur- 
rant jelly. Make gravy the same as for turkey. 

This time cooks the goose and ducks rare. 

Roast Partridges. 

Clean and truss ; then lard and roast fifty minutes. Serve 
with currant jelly. To make the gravy : Put one spoonful 
of butter into a basin, and when it boils up stir in one spoon- 



POULTRY. 69 

ful of dry flour ; stir until a dark brown ; then pour on half 
a pint of boihng water. Season with salt, pepper, the par- 
tridge drippings, and a spoonful of currant jelly. Or serve 
with bread sauce, the rule for which you will find under 
sauces. 

To lard a bird : Cut fat salt pork into thin, narrow shces, 
and put one end of the slice through the eye of a larding 
needle. (You can obtain one at any kitchen furnishing 
store.) Now run the needle under the skin of the bird, and 
draw the pork half way through, having the pieces about an 
inch apart. 

Roast Grouse. 

If you stuff them, make the dressing the same as for 
turkey ; but they are not often stuffed. Roast thirty min- 
utes, and serve with currant jelly. The gravy made the 
same as before directed. 

Roast Pigeons. 

Lard and roast the same as partridges. Make the gravy 
the same, with the addition of one teaspoonful of clove and 
half a wine-glass of claret. The pigeons must be young, or 
they will not be nice roasted. 

Small Birds. 

Woodcock, quail, snipe, and plover may be cooked in the 
same manner as partridges, allowing fifteen minutes to roast, 
and serve on toast. 




Roast Venison. 

If in winter keep the venison three weeks after being 
killed ; but if in summer, ten or twelve days will be suffi- 
cient. Draw the dry skin from a leg of venison, and cut off 
the shank ; roast half an hour, and then baste with salt, 
water, butter, and flour ; when it has roasted one hour and 
a half, baste with claret wine. If it is to be served on 
blazers, two hours will cook a leg weighing fifteen pounds, 
but if not, roast four hours. A saddle of venison is cooked 
in the same way, but will require only half as much time to 
roast. To make the gravy, put the shank in a basin with 
three quarts of cold water, a few cloves, one onion, half a 
pound of beef, salt, and pepper ; boil until there is about a 
quart of liquor, then strain, and thicken with two spoonfuls 
of flour. When the venison is dished add the drippings and 
one glass of claret wine. Boil up once and serve. Have 
the dishes on which the venison is served and the plates 
very hot. 

Venison steak and pie are cooked the same as beef.

Ste'vred Beef 'with Mushrooms. 

Take five pounds of beef (with as much tenderloin 
as possible), put in a pan, and set in the oven fifteen 
minutes ; then take the meat and put it in a small por- 
celain kettle, and dredge with salt, pepper, a teaspoonful 
of mace, half of clove, half of allspice, and two spoonfuls of 
flour j now put in cold water enough to cover the meat, and 
stew slowly, keeping the steam in, three hours. Then put 
in half a tumbler of mushroom catsup and a glass of claret 
wine, and simmer half an hour longer. Serve with plenty of 
gravy. 

Fillet of Beef ■with Mushrooms. 

Cut the fillet into slices about half an inch thick, and lay 
them an hour in melted butter, having first sprinkled them 
with salt and pepper. At the end of that time place them

72 MISS PARLOA S APPLEDORE COOK BOOK. 

over a brisk fire, and when well browned on one side turn 
them and brown on the other. Then lay them in a hot 
dish, and into the butter that remains in the pan put one 
spoonful of dry flour, and brown ; when brown, add half a 
cup of boiling water, and half a wineglass of mushroom 
catsup or Madeira wine. Pour the gravy over the fillet, and 
serve. 

Alamode Beef. 

Take six pounds of the round of beef, cut deep gashes in 
it, and rub into it a handful of salt, a spoonful of cinnamon, 
half of clove, half of allspice, one of mace, one of pepper, 
and half a cup of flour. Fill the gashes vrith dressing made 
as for turkey, with the addition of a little chopped onion. 
Sew the gashes together, and bind the beef with strips of 
cotton cloth. Lay the beef in a small kettle that can be 
covered tight ; put in a whole onion and cold water enough 
to cover the beef. Simmer three hours, and then make a 
thickening with four spoonfuls of flour, and stir in, and at 
the same time stir in two spoonfuls of either mushroom or 
walnut catsup and simmer one hour longer. Some persons 
think that the addition of a glass of claret or Madeira is an 
improvement ; but it is very nice without. 

Bouilli Beef. 

Take six pounds of lean beef and rub into it two spoon- 
fuls of salt, one half of pepper, one cup of flour ; then lay 
in a small kettle which you can cover tight. Cut into this 
one carrot, one small turnip, one onion, two parsnips, and 



ENTREMETS. 73 

cover with cold water. When it comes to a boil skim, then 
set back where it will simmer three hours ; at the end of 
this time thicken with three spoonfuls of flour, and cut in 
three potatoes ; cover and simmer again one hour. If not 
seasoned enough add more salt and pepper. 

Bouilli Tongue. 

Boil and skin the tongue the day before, and prepare in 
the same way as bouilli beef, allowing it two hours to 
simmer. 

SteTved Partridges. 

Place two partridges in a small kettle, and dredge with 
salt, pepper, flour, half a teaspoonful of mace, half of cloves, 
and cover with cold water. Cover tight and simmer two 
hours. Thicken with three spoonfuls of flour, and stir in 
two spoonfuls of catsup ; simmer one hour longer and serve. 
Grouse and pigeons are stewed in the same manner. Gar- 
nish all the foregoing dishes with paste cakes. 

BroTwri Fricassee of Chicken. 

Cut two chickens or old fowl into handsome pieces, and 
parboil them in just water enough to cover them ; when 
they are tender, take them up and drain them dry. Cut a 
pound of salt pork into slices, and fry them brown ; take up 
the pork, dredge the chicken with salt, pepper, and flour, 
and fry a dark brown in the pork fat. When the chicken 
is all fried, stir into the remaining pork fat half a cup of dry 
flour ; stir this until a dark brown, then pour on it one quart

of the liquor in which the chicken was boiled. (This liquor 
must be boiling.) Season with pepper and salt to taste. 
Lay the chicken in this gravy, and simmer twenty minutes. 
Garnish the dish with boiled rice. 

■White Fricassee of Chicken. 

Boil the chicken until tender, then cut it into small pieces. 
With the water in which it was boiled make a gravy, allow- 
ing half a cup of flour and two spoonfuls of butter to every 
quart of water. Season with pepper and salt ; turn in the 
chicken, and let it boil five minutes, and serve. Garnish 
the dish with boiled rice. 

Chicken Curry. 

Make the same as white fricassee, with the addition of one 
teaspoonful of Indian curry to one pint of gravy, if it is Hked 
strong, if not, half a teaspoonful. Dissolve the curry in a 
little water, and stir in. Garnish the dish with rice. Veal 
and mutton can be curried in the same manner. 

Chicken Fie. 

Prepare the chicken as for white fricassee ; turn into a 
deep earthen dish and cover with a paste, and bake one 
hour. 

Chicken Fillau, — A Southern Dish. 

Cut a chicken into pieces the size you wish to serve at 
table, then wash clean and put into the stew-pan with about 
one eighth of a pound of salt pork, which has been cut up 



ENTREMETS. 75 

into small pieces. Cover this with cold water, and boil 
gently until the chicken begins to grow tender, which will 
be in about one hour, unless the chicken is old. Now 
season the liquor and chicken with salt and pepper, rather 
highly, and add three teacups of rice, which has been picked 
and washed, and let it boil thirty or forty minutes longer. 

There should be a good quart of liquor in the stew-pan 
when the rice is added. Care must be taken that it does 
not burn. Pork or any other kind of meat can be used. 

Broiled Chicken. 

Split down the back, wash and wipe dry, and broil over 
clear coals twenty-five minutes. Season with pepper, salt, 
and butter. 

Chicken Patties. 

Make the shell as for tarts, only larger, and prepare the 
chicken as for white fricassee, but cutting it smaller, and tak- 
ing out all the bones. Fill the shells, and send to the table 
immediately. 

Devilled Turkey. 

Take the legs (the first and second joints) of a roast turkey 
(if underdone they are still better), and cut deep gashes in 
them, and into these gashes put a little mixed mustard, a 
little salt and cayenne pepper ; lay on the gridiron until 
heated through ; then place on a very hot dish, and spread 
with butter. Serve immediately. Any kind of fowl may be 
served in the same way.

Potted Pigeon. 

Clean, then stuff the pigeons with a dressing made as for 
turkey. Sew them up and truss ; put them in a kettle with 
water enough to cover them, and boil half an hour, then 
take up and drain them. Roll them in flour, and fry 
brown in pork fat. Thicken the liquor in which they were 
boiled with flour, pepper, salt, cloves, mace, and catsup. 
Put the pigeons in this gravy, and simmer two hours. Serve 
in the gravy. Add half a glass of claret if you choose. 

Pigeon Pie. 

Prepare as for stewed pigeons, then turn into a deep 
earthen dish, and cover with paste. Bake forty- five min-

pepper, salt, and a little butter; then dredge in flour. 
Nearly cover with cold water; cover with a paste, and 
bake one hour. 

Snipe Pie. 

Made the same as quail pie. 

Oyster Pie. 

Line a tin plate with plain paste, and then put in two 
dozen oysters, sprinkle with a little pepper, salt, and grate 
on a little nutmeg. Strew in a little butter, and cover with 
a rich paste. Bake twenty minutes, and serve immediately.

heaping spoonful of butter ; fill the shells with this, and 
send to the table immediately. 

Oyster Roast. 
Cook the same as for patties, but serve on buttered toast. 

Scalloped Oysters. 

Put a layer of oysters in an oval dish, and dredge in a 
little salt, pepper, and butter ; then a layer of rolled cracker, 
and another of oysters ; dredge the oysters as before, and 
cover with cracker ; over the cracker grate a little nutmeg, 
and lay on small pieces of butter. Bake twenty minutes in 
a quick oven ; add a glass of Madeira wine if you choose. 
Allow four crackers, two spoonfuls of butter, and one tea- 
spoonful of pepper to one quart of oysters. Fill the dish to 
within an inch of the top. 

Fried Oysters. 

Drain the oysters on a sieve ; roll them in cracker crumbs, 
and fry in boiling lard a light brown. Serve on brown-bread 
toast. When you desire them fried in batter, make one as 
for apple fritters, and fry in boiling lard. Have the dishes 
very hot. ^

Broiled Oysters. 

Prepare in crumbs as for frying, and broil a light brown. 
Examine oysters carefully to see that there are not pieces 
of shell among them. Some oysters need more salt than 
others. 

Veal Croquettes. 

ChoTp Jine two pounds of cold veal; season with one tea- 
spoonful of pepper, one tablespoonful of salt, one of butter. 
Mix with this two eggs and one fourth of a cup of water. 
Mix this thoroughly, and make into pear shapes about the 
size of an egg. Have two well-beaten eggs ; dip the cro- 
quettes into them, and fry a light brown in boiling lard. 

Rice Croquettes. 

Boil one cup of rice, as for a vegetable, and when cool, 
mix with four well-beaten eggs, one grated nutmeg, half a

Queen Fritters. 

Into half a pint of boiling water stir half a cup of butter, 
and when this boils up, stir in one pint of flour; let this 
cook about five minutes, beating well all the time ; then 
take off, and turn into an earthen dish. When this is cool, 
break five eggs into a dish, but do not beat them ; turn one 
third of the eggs into the dish with the paste, and beat all 
together with the hand. When this is well mixed, turn in 
half of the remainder ; beat as before, and then add the 
remainder of the egg, and beat twenty minutes. Drop this 
paste in teaspoonfuls into boiling lard, and fry until they 
crack open (this will be in about fifteen or twenty minutes) . 
Serve with or without sugar and wine.

Beat to a froth two eggs, and stir into this half a pint of 
milk, one teaspoonful of salt, two cups of flour ; beat this 
lightly, and drop by teaspoonfuls into boiling lard, and fry a 
light brown. 

Apple Fritters. 

Make the batter as for plain fritters. Pare and core nice 
tart apples ; cut them in thin slices, dip them in the batter, 
and fry brown. 

Pancakes. 

Beat to a froth three eggs ; stir into this half a pint of 
milk, one teaspoonful of salt, and three tablespoonfuls of 
flour. Heat the frying-pan, and grease well with butter ; 
turn one third of the batter into it, and fry a light brown on

one side, shaking the pan frequently to prevent burning. 
When brown on one side, turn and brown the other. When 
done, spread with jelly, fold, and serve immediately. You 
' can omit the jelly, and spread with sugar, if you choose. 

Salad Dressing. 

One tablespoonful of mustard, one of sugar, one teaspoon- 
ful of salt, one tenth of cayenne pepper, and the yolks of 
three uncooked eggs. Put this mixture in an earthen dish 
and set on ice ; stir with a wooden or silver spoon until it is 
all well mixed, then add, very gradually, one bottle of table 
oil. Stir until very light ; then stir in half a cup of vinegar. 
One cup of whipped cream is a great addition to it ; stir in 
the last thing. Be sure that you stir evenly, and one way all 
the time. This is enough for four quarts of salad. 

Chicken Salad. 

Boil tender four good-sized chickens ; when cold, cut off 
the white meat, and chop rather coarse. Cut off the white 
part of the celery and chop in the same manner. To two 
quarts and a pint of the chicken allow one quart and a pint 
of the celery and a spoonful of salt. Mix well together, and 
then stir in part of the dressing. Shape the salad in a flat 
dish, and pour over the remainder of the dressing. Garnish 
with hard boiled eggs, beets, and the tops of the celery. 

Lobster Salad. 

Lobster salad is made the same as chicken, using lobster 
instead of chicken, and lettuce instead of celery. 




Boiled Potatoes. 

If the potatoes are new, wash clean and put into boiling 
water ; boil thirty minutes, and serve immediately. As 
they grow older, scrape the skin off before boiling. For old 
potatoes, have a sharp knife with a thin blade, and pare the 
potatoes, having the skin as thin as possible. They are very 
much better if they stand in cold water a few hours before 
boiling ; then put them in boiling water and boil thirty 
minutes. When they have boiled fifteen minutes, throw in 
a handful of salt. When done, turn off the water and let 
them stand on the back part of the range three minutes, 
then shake them up once and turn into the dish, and send 
to the table. 

Mashed Potatoes. 

Prepare and boil as for plain, and then mash. To two 
dozen potatoes add one cup of boiling milk and one spoon- 
Si

ful of butter. If they are not salt enough, add a little more. 
They should be dished as soon as mashed. Heap them in 
the dish in an oval form, smooth and indent with the knife. 

Bro-wned Potatoes. 

Prepare and mash as for plain mashed potatoes ; then 
heap them in an oval form on a buttered tin sheet. Smooth 
with a knife, and then dip the knife in milk and smooth 
over again, wetting every part with the milk, and place in 
the oven to brown ; they will brown in twenty minutes in a 
hot oven. I would not recommend browning potatoes, as 
the moisture, being baked in, spoils the flavor and renders 
them clammy. They look handsome made into pear shapes 
and browned. 

Baked Potatoes. 

Be very particular to wash every part of the potato clean, 
as many persons eat the skin. Put them in a pan (have an 
old one for this purpose), and bake in a moderate oven 
fifty minutes. There is such a difference in ovens that each 
one must learn for herself what the time will be for each; 
for some will bake in less time, and some will take much 
longer than the time designated. 

Fried Potatoes. 

Pare and slice thin raw potatoes, and let them stand in 
cold water several hours ; if in summer, put a piece of ice 
in the water. Cut the slices lengthwise of the potato. Have 
ready a basin with boiling drippings or lard, drain the pota-

toes a minute in the cullender, and drop them into the boil- 
ing fat, and fry a light brown ; take them out with a skimmer, 
and lay them in a dry cullender, which should be placed in 
a tin pan and set in an open oven. There should be as 
much fat as for frying doughnuts, and there should not be 
any more potatoes put in at a time than will fry brown and 
not stick together. Have the basin in which you fry quite 
deep, as there is danger of the fat boiling over when the 
potatoes are put in. When you take the potatoes up, dredge 
a little salt over them. When potatoes are cooked in this 
manner, they will be light and crisp. If they do not get 
cooked enough at first, they are very much improved by 
dropping them into the fat for one minute, after they have 
been standing in the oven a while. 

Fried Boiled Potatoes. 

Cut the potatoes into slices, and fry in either pork fat or 
nice drippings. Have just fat enough in the pan to prevent 
their sticking, and sprinkle with salt while cooking. When 
these are brown, take them up and put in a little more fat, 
and fry as before. 

Potatoes Warmed -with Pork. 

Cut about eight slices of pork into pieces about half an 
inch square, and fry a nice brown. Have ready one dozen 
cold potatoes cut into slices, and turn them into the pan 
with the fried pork, and dredge in a little salt and pepper, 
then stir and cut them into small pieces with the knife. 
When a light brown, serve. 



84 MISS parloa's appledore cook book. 

Potatoes Warmed in Gravy. 

Slice cold potatoes as for frying, and turn them into the 
frying-pan, and to a dozen potatoes add a pint of cold gravy. 
Season with pepper and salt, and stir, and cut with a knife, 
until they are hot and in small pieces. 

Fricassee of Potatoes. 

Cut cold boiled potatoes into small squares, and put them 
in a basin with milk, pepper, and salt, allowing half a pint 
of milk to a dozen potatoes. Set the basin into another of 
hot water, and when it comes to a boil, add a tablespoonful 
of butter, and set on the stove, and let it boil up once, then 
serve. 

Boiled Sweet Potatoes. 

Wash and boil, with the skins on, forty-five minutes. 
They are much better baked than boiled, and I would cook 
them so generally. 

Baked Sweet Potatoes. 

Wash and wipe dry, and bake one hour. Do not cook 
squash when you have sweet potatoes. 

Boiled Onions. 

When new and tender, they will boil in one hour ; but 
after the month of October, they will require two hours. Put 
them into water. before peeling them, and they will not af- 
fect the eyes. Peel off all the dark skin, and put them in hot 



VEGETABLES. 85 

water, and boil as directed. If you have milk plenty, half 
an hour before they are done, turn a quart ictj the water in 
which they are boiling. This makes them white, and is said 
to prevent, in a measure, the disagreeable odor which always 
follows their being eaten. Boil them in a porcelain kettle. 
Dish them whole, and season with a little pepper, salt, and 
butter. 

Fried Onions. 

Peel and slice thin ten good-sized onions, and put them 
in a frying-pan with two spoonfuls of drippings. Fry thirty 
minutes, turning often. 

Boiled Squash. 

Cut the squash in strips, and cut out the soft, stringy 
part ; pare, wash, and cover with boiling water; boil twenty- 
five minutes, then turn into a cullender for a few minutes, 
and when all the water is drained off, put it back in the basin 
with a httle salt, pepper, and butter, and mash. Dish the 
same as mashed potatoes. 

Baked Squash. 

Cut the squash in two, take out all of the soft, stringy 
part ; if you need the whole squash for dinner, lay the halves 
together, and put in a baking-pan (the old one you use for 
baking potatoes in), and bake forty-five minutes. When 
done, scrape the squash from the shell, and season, and 
serve as boiled squash. When you cook but half a squash, 
lay it with the inside downward. This is a nice way to cook 



86 MISS parloa's appledore cook book. 

watery squash. Squash is also good steamed. It will take 
forty-five minutes to steam. 

Beets. 

Wash clean, but do not scrape ; if you do they will look 
white when cooked. When young they will cook in two 
hours ; but old ones will require four or five hours. When 
done, plunge them into cold water, and the skin will peel off 
easily. Cut in thin slices, and lay in a flat dish. 

Pickled Beets. 

Cut the beets that are left from dinner into thin slices, 
and lay them in an earthen vessel, and cover with cold vine- 
gar and a few whole cloves. Keep in a cold place. 

Shelled Beans. 

Wash in several watets, and pour them in a basin with 
boiling water. Boil one hour. Do not drain them very dry. 
Season with butter and salt. 

Baked Beans. 

Examine and wash one quart of dry beans (the pea bean 
is the best), and put them in a pan with six quarts of cold 
water ; let them soak in this over night. In the morning 
wash them in another water, and place them on the fire with 
six quarts of cold water and a pound of mixed salt pork. If they 
are the present year's beans, they will cook enough in half an 
hour ; if older, one hour. Drain them and put half in the 



VEGETABLES. 8/ 

bean-pot ; then gash the pork, and put in the remainder of 
the beans, one tablespoonful of molasses, and one of salt, 
and cover with boiling water. Bake ten hours. Watch them 
carefully, and do not let them cook dry. 

String Beans. 

String and cut into pieces about an inch long ; then wash 
and put into boiling water, and boil two hours. Season with 
salt and butter. 

Stewed Beans. 

Wash and soak overnight one quart of beans. (Scarlet run- 
ners are the best.) In the morning set them on the fire with 
six quarts of cold water and one and a half pounds of mixed 
salt pork. They will cook in four hours, but are better cooked 
five. Stir them often to prevent burning. Season with pep- 
per before dishing, and if the pork does not season it enough, 
add a little salt. 

Green Peas. 

Put them into boiling water, and when very young they 
will cook in twenty minutes ; but generally they require 
thirty. Season with salt and butter. 

Green Corn. 

Boil twenty-five minutes, if very young and tender. As it 
grows older it requires a longer time. Send to the table in 
a napkin.

Boiled Turnips. 

Peel and cut into slices. If they are to be served in slices, 
boil with a small piece of pork. Boil the pork three hours, 
and put in the turnips ; if they are the white turnip, they 
will cook in forty-five minutes ; but if the yellow, they will 
require two hours. Serve in slices without any seasoning 
except what they get by being boiled with the pork. 
For mashed, cook in the same way, omitting the pork, and 
season with salt, pepper, and butter. When the white turnip 
is very watery, it is improved by mashing a few mealy pota- 
toes with it. Dish as directed for mashed potato. 



Boiled Parsnips. 

Scrape very clean, and cut lengthwise into slices. Put 
them into a stew-pan, and cover with water, and boil one 
hour. Serve with a little drawn butter. 



Fried Parsnips. 

Prepare as before directed, and boil half an hour. Let 
them grow' cold, and fry a light brown in pork fat. (Never 
use butter to fry.) They are very nice cooked whole with 
a piece of pork, as you cook turnips. The time to eat pars- 
nips is in April and May, and they should be dug fresh when 
used. Dig a large box full in the fall, and cover them with 
earth. Use these for soups ; they are one of the nicest 
vegetables that there are for flavoring soups. 



VEGETABLES. 89 

Boiled Carrots. 

Prepsjre, boil, and serve the same as parsnips. 

Boiled Rice. 

Wash and pick all the specks from a cup of rice. Let 
it stand in cold water two hours, and then put it in a deep 
kettle, with two quarts of water, and boil /a j/ thirty minutes. 
When it has boiled twenty minutes, throw in a great spoonful 
of salt. When done, turn into a cullender, and set in the oven 
a few minutes. When ready to dish, shake lightly, and turn 
into the vegetable dish. Never use a spoon. If these direc- 
tions are followed, you will have a handsome and healthy veg- 
etable, and every kernel will be separate. The water in which 
the rice has been boiled makes a nice starch for colored 
clothes. 

The southern rice cooks much quicker and is nicer than 
the Indian rice. If possible, always purchase the former. 

Another Mode. 

Wash one cupful of rice and put into a tin basin or pail, 
with three cupfuls of cold water, and a teaspoonful of salt, 
cover and set in another basin, with hot water, place on the 
fire, and boil thirty minutes. Rice is very healthy, and 
should be a common dish on the table. 

Stewed Tomatoes. 

Pour boihng water over half a peck of ripe tomatoes. 
Let them stand in it five minutes, and then peel off the

skins ; cut them into slices, and put in a stew-pan with a 
Httle salt, pepper, and a spoonful of sugar. Simmer two 
hours, stirring often to prevent burning. Two minutes 
before dishing stir in one tablespoonful of butter. Canned 
tomatoes are cooked in the same manner, but do not refl^uire 
more than half an hour to stew. 



Sliced Tomatoes. 

Pour boiling water over them, and then peel and slice 
thin ; lay them on small platters, and serve. Let each 
person season to his own taste. 



Baked Tomatoes. 

Scald and peel as directed ; have ready an earthen dish, 
int6 which lay a layer of tomatoes (whole), then sprinkle 
with salt, pepper, and cracker crumbs ; then another layer 
of tomatoes, and sprinkle again with salt and pepper. Cut 
a spoonful of butter into small pieces and lay on the toma- 
toes, and then cover with cracker crumbs. Bake thirty 
minutes. 

Asparagus. 

Cut off the white part, wash and tie in small bunches, and 
put into a sauce-pan with boiling water enough to cover it, 
and a handful of salt. When young it will boil in twenty 
minutes ; if not tender, boil thirty. Dish on toast, and 
season with a little butter. 



VEGETABLES. 9 1 

Spinach. 

Pick carefully and see that there are no weeds or grass in 
it ; then wash in several waters. Put on to boil in boiling 
water, and boil half an hour. When about half done, throw 
into the water a spoonful of salt. When done, drain and 
put in a dish with a little butter, and cut it several times 
with a knife. Dish and garnish with slices of hard boiled 
egg. You can boil it with a piece of salt pork, and then 
you will not require the butter and eggs. 

Cabbage. 

Cut the stalk and all the loose leaves from the cabbage ; 
then cut the cabbage into four parts, and wash clean. 
Examine it carefully, as there are worms in it sometimes. 
Put it in a deep pan, and pour salt and cold water over it, 
and let it stand half an hour. Boil rapidly in plenty of 
water (with the cover off the stew-pan) for forty-five min- 
utes. Season with salt and butter, or a piece of salt pork or 
corned beef may be cooked with the cabbage. When cold, 
it is nice warmed with a little of the drippings of corned 
beef. 

Cauliflo'wer. 

Cut off the loose leaves and the stalk ; wash clean, and 
let it stand in cold water one hour ; then put on to boil in 
boiling water, and if very large, boil half an hour. When 
nearly done, stir in a spoonful of salt and half a pint of milk. 
Serve whole in a deep dish, and spread over it a little 
butter. The milk can be omitted, as its only use is to 
whiten the cauliflower. 



92 MISS PARLOA S APPLEDORE COOK BOOK. 

Dandelions. 

Pick over carefully, and wash in several waters ; cut ofi 
all the roots, then put into boiling water, and boil one hour ; 
then drain off this water, and again put them into boiling 
water, and boil two hours longer. Put a spoonful of salt 
into the second water. When done, turn into a cullender 
and drain ; then season with butter and more salt if neces- 
sary, and cut them with a knife. Serve in a deep vegetable 
dish. They may be boiled with a piece of salt pork, but in 
that case omit the butter. 

Beet Greens. 

Scrape the roots and wash in several waters ; then let 
them stand in cold water a few hours. Boil a small piece 
of salt pork three hours, then put the beet greens into the 
kettle with it, and boil one hour longer. 

Boiled Macaroni. 

Break up and wash, a pint bowl full of macaroni, and put 
in a stew-pan, cover with boiling water, and place on the 
fire ; after fifteen minutes, add a pint of milk and a tea- 
spoonful of salt ; let it cook ten minutes longer, then add a 
spoonful of butter, and cook five minutes more, and dish. 
Be careful not to break the macaroni in dishing. The 
boiled macaroni which remains from one dinner can be used 
for the next, by preparing it in the following manner : But- 
ter a shallow dish, and turn the macaroni into it ; then grate 
over it old cheese, and brown. 




Always purchase the best flour ; it is much cheaper than 
the low priced. Keep a large tin pan or wooden bowl full 
of sifted flour, and always keep the flour covered. Have 
two quarts, one for dry, and the other for liquid measuring. 
The old beer measure is the kind to get. If you buy milk, 
it will not do to consider the milkman's quart for any rule 
in this book. You must always measure with the beer meas- 
ure. Good bread is the most important branch of cooking. 
Therefore I hope every housekeeper, who cannot already 
make good bread, will give particular attention to this branch 
before attending to cake or pastry of any kind. It seems as 
if enough had been written and said, in regard to this sub- 
ject, to awaken every young woman to the importance of it; 
but it is not so. If a young lady learns to do any kind of 
cooking, it is cake and pastry, and if she learns to make 
bread, it is the last thing, instead of the first, to be learned.

94 MISS PARLOA S APPLEDORE COOK BOOK. 

Now I certainly think that no girl should pass her eighteenth 
year without a practical knowledge of bread-making, cook- 
ing vegetables and plain meats. I have no objections to all 
the nice fancy cooking which any one may learn afterwards ; 
but have bread, vegetables, and meats first. When reading 
a rule for doing anything, it seems as if the process were 
longer and harder than when the rule is very short. But I 
hope none will feel so because I have gone into all the de- 
tails, for I feel that it is because of the neglect of the small 
things that so many fail in cooking, as in everything else. 

Hop Yeast. 
Pare and boil one dozen mealy potatoes (they will boil in 
thirty minutes) ; as soon as you put the potatoes on to boil, 
put a handful of hops into another kettle with three quarts 
of cold water, cover and boil (watch it that it may not boil 
over) . When the potatoes are boiled, drain and mash fine ; 
then strain the hops through a fine sieve on the potatoes 
(be sure that the hops are boiling when they are strained on 
the potatoes), and stir well; then add one half a cup of 
sugar, one fourth of salt, and one pint of flour ; mix this 
well and strain through a cullender ; let it stand until it is 
milk-warm, then stir in one cup of good yeast, and set it to 
rise where it will be warm. It will rise in five hours if the 
yeast is good. You can tell when it is risen by the white 
foam, which will rise to the top. When risen, put it in a stone 
jug, and stop tight. It is a good plan to tie the cork down, 
as it sometimes flies out. Set in the ice chest or on the 
cellar bottom. Make one third this quantity in summer if 
your family be small. 



BREAD. 95 

Hop Yeast, No. 2. 

In the spring and the first of the summer, when potatoes 
are poor, it is better to make yeast without them. Boil one 
fourth of a cup of hops in one quart of water, and strain it 
upon half a pint of flour ; stir this well, and add two spoon- 
fuls of sugar and one of salt, then strain through a cullender, 
and let it become milk-warm, when add one cup of good 
yeast. You need just as much yeast for one third the quan- 
<;ity made without potatoes, as you would for the whole made 
with potatoes. Rise and bottle the same as the preceding. 

Hop Yeast, No. 3. 

Into one quart of water in which potatoes have been 
boiled put a pinch of hops, and boil a few minutes ; strain, 
and then stir in one spoonful of sugar and one of salt. 
Let this cool, and when blood-warm add half a cup of 
good yeast. It soon foams up like beer, and will keep in 
all temperatures. Put nothing in the yeast but the potato 
water, hops, sugar, salt, and the rising. 

Potato Yeast. 

Pare and boil six good-sized potatoes ; when done, mash, 
and pour on them three pints of boiling water ; run this 
through the cullender, and then stir in one spoonful of sugar 
and one of salt. When milk-warm, stir in half a cup of 
yeast. In summer time this will rise in three or four hours. 
It will not keep as long as hop yeast.

Yeast Bread. 

Take four good-sized potatoes, peel, boil, and mash, and 
pour on to them one quart of boiling water ; strain the whole 
through a sieve ; let this get blood-warm, and then stir into 
it one cup of yeast, one spoonful of white sugar, one spoon- 
ful of salt, and three quarts and a pint of flour. Beat well 
with a spoon and s^t in a warm place to rise. (In the sum- 
mer it will rise in four hours, in winter it will take five.) 
When well risen, take a pint of flour and put part of it on 
the kneading-board ; then turn the dough upon the board, 
and put one spoonful of lard on it ; then knead twenty min- 
utes, using the pint of flour ; now put the dough in the pan 
again, and let it rise one hour, and then form into loaves. 
(Do not have over a pint bowl full of dough in a loaf) Let 
the loaves rise forty minutes, and bake forty-five minutes. 
Bread made in this way cannot be excelled ; the only objec- 
tion to it is that you have to bake in the afternoon ; but 
when good bread is wanted, a little extra work should not 
prevent it being made. 

Yeast Bread, No. 2. 

Make a hole in the middle of four quarts of flour, into 
which turn one spoonful of sugar, one of salt, and one cup 
of yeast ; then mix with one pint of cold milk, which has 
been warmed by the addition of one pint of boiling water, 
and add one spoonful of lard ; knead well, and let it rise 
over night. In winter, let it begin to rise near the fire the 
first of the evening, unless your kitchen is very warm. But 



BREAD. 97 

in summer do not mix until nine, unless you intend baking 
before breakfast. In the morning knead again, and make 
into loaves ; let them rise one hour, and bake fifty min- 
utes. If you have not plenty of milk, mix with water, and use 
one spoonful more of lard. There is a great deal in know- 
ing how to knead ; strength is not all, as many suppose. 
When you put the bread on the board, mix it Ughtly, and 
when you begin to knead it, do not press down, but let all 
your motions be as elastic as possible ; knead with the palm 
of the hand until the dough is a flat cake, then fold, and 
keep doing this until the dough is smooth and elastic ; twenty 
minutes is the time I have given, but many persons can 
knead the bread in less time, while others will require longer. 
But practice will teach each one. 

Bread Made ■with Yeast-cakes. 

For two quarts of flour take one good-sized yeast-cake, 
and break up in one pint of blood-warm water ; stir until it 
is thoroughly softened, then from your two quarts of flour 
take enough to make a thin batter, and set where it will 
keep warm'for about two hours. If the yeast is good, it will 
be a sponge in that time. Now, take the remainder of your 
flour, and proceed as for "Bread No. 2," of course omitting 
the flour and water, and using only half as much salt and 
sugar. 

Milk Yeast Bread. 

Put into a two-quarts-and-a-pint pail one pint of new 
milk, and one pint of boiling water ; mix with this one table- 



98 MISS parloa's appledore cook book. 

spoonful of white sugar, one of salt, and three pints of 
flour. 

Beat this well together, and cover tight (have a spoon 
that is so short that you can put the cover on the pail while 
it is in it, and yet it must be long enough to come nearly to 
the top). Set this pail into another pail, or kettle, with 
water enough to come nearly to the top of it. To get this 
water the right temperature, take one half cold and one half 
boiling water ; set it where it will keep about the same tem- 
perature until risen ; watch carefully, and beat the batter as 
often as once in every half hour until the last hour, when it 
must not be disturbed. This will rise in about five hours ; 
when it is risen the pail will be full. Do not let it stand one 
minute after that, as it spoils very quickly. Have in a pan 
two quarts of flour, make a hole in the middle of it. Dissolve 
a teaspoonful of saleratus in a little hot water, and when the 
batter is risen turn it into the middle of the flour, and turn 
the saleratus in with it ; then knead well, and make into 
loaves. Set them where they will be warm, and let them 
rise forty-five minutes. Bake in a quick oven. It will take 
nearly a pint of flour to knead the dough on the board. Be 
as particular to measure your flour as you are to measure the 
milk and water. This bread is not so healthful as hop yeast 
bread, and is more difficult to make ; but it makes the nicest 
dry toast and delicious sandwiches. 

Graham Bread. 

Take two quarts of Graham {never sift it) and one of 
flour, half a cup of yeast, one scant spoonful of salt, half a 



BREAD. 99 

cup of brown sugar, and warm water enough to make a stiff 
batter, and let it rise. If you rise it over night, be sure 
to set it in a cool place, as it sours much quicker than fine 
flour. It will rise in a warm place in four hours. When 
risen, mix with it a teaspoonful of saleratus dissolved in 
warm water, and flour enough to shape it into loaves ; put 
it in the pans, and let it rise thirty-five minutes, and bake 
slowly an hour and a quarter. Make the loaves very small. 
Use molasses instead of sugar if the bread is eaten for 
constipation. 

Graham Bread, No. 2. 

Where the bread is liked light like the baker's, this is a 
good rule ; but if the bread be eaten for medicinal purposes 
rule the first is the best. 

Half a cup of yeast, one pint of warm milk or water, and 
flour enough to make a thin batter. Let this rise over night 
and in the morning stir in half a cup of sugar, a little salt, one 
teaspoonful of saleratus dissolved in water, and Graham 
enough to make a very stiff batter. All the other ingredients 
should be thoroughly beaten into the sponge before adding 
the Graham, then stir in the Graham a little at a time, and 
beat well. Much depends upon the beating. Shape into 
loaves with the hands, and place in the baking-pans. If the 
weather is warm and the sponge is light the loaves will be 
ready to bake in an hour and a half; but if not warm it will 
take longer. The oven should not be so hot as for white 
bread. Bake one hour and a half.

Third Bread. 

Take one quart of flour, one of Indian meal, one of rye, 
one cup of yeast, one spoonful of salt, half a cup of brown 
sugar, and nearly a quart of warm water ; mix well together, 
and let it rise over night. In the morning use flour enough 
to shape it into loaves, and let it rise in the baking-pans 
forty-five minutes. Bake one hour and a quarter. 

Brown Bread. 

Take one heaping pint bowlful of rye meal, two of 
Indian, one cup of yeast, one of molasses, one spoonful of 
salt, one teaspoonful saleratus. Mix with warm water, 
as thick as hasty-pudding. Lard the dish in which it is to 
be baked, and then turn in the mixture ; let it rise two 
hours, and bake in a slow oven four hours. 

Brovrn Bread, No, 2. 

Three cups of Indian meal, three of rye, one half of 
molasses, one spoonful of salt, one teaspoonful of saler- 
atus ; wet with one quart and a fourth of milk. Steam five 
or six hours. This will make enough to fill a two-quart pan. 

Brown Bread, No. 3. 

One pint of sour milk, half a cup of molasses, one 
teaspoonful saleratus, one tablespoonful salt, half Indian 
and half rye meal enough to make a stiff batter ; lard the 
baking-tin well, and turn in the mixture. Steam five hours. 
I will say here that you cannot steam brown bread too 
much ; but do not steam it less than five hours. 



BREAD. 101 

Togus Bread. 

Three cups of sweet milk and one of sour, three cups of 
Indian meal and one of flour, one half cup of molasses, one 
teaspoonful of saleratus, salt. Steam three hours. 

Raised Biscuit. 

If the biscuit are for breakfast, take part of the dough 
of yeast bread No. 2, and mould with the hands very small 
cakes, place them in a shallow pan, and rise one hour. 
Bake in a quick oven thirty minutes. Never cut raised 
biscuit with a cutter ; they are enough nicer for being 
moulded by the hand to pay for the extra labor. When 
the biscuit are for tea, take part of the dough of No. i, and 
proceed as directed for breakfast biscuit. When the sup- 
per hour is six, do not set your bread until ten, if in sum- 
mer, but if in winter, half past eight. Begin to make the 
biscuit two hours before supper-time ; by this means you 
will have plenty of time to rise them. Shape the loaves at 
the same time, and they can be baked while you are getting 
supper. 

Raised Biscuit, No. 2. 

Take three quarts of flour and one cup of butter, one of 
yeast, one spoonful of salt, one of sugar. Melt the butter 
and mix. with a scant quart of warm milk; wet the flour 
with this, and set in a warm place to rise. When it cracks 
open it is risen enough. When it is risen, work into it two 
teaspoonfuls of saleratus which have been dissolved in half 
a cup of hot water. You must work it very thoroughly, or 



102 MISS PARLOA S APPLEDORE COOK BOOK. 

the saleratus will not be mixed with every part. Now put 
the dough into large tin pans or pails (do not have the ves- 
sels more than half full, as the dough will rise again), and 
set them on the ice. This dough will not be fit to use 
under twelve hours, as it must be chilled through. When 
you wish to make biscuit, take part of this dough and lay on 
the paste board, and roll about an inch thick ; cut in small 
cakes, and bake fifteen minutes in a quick oven. Handle 
the dough as little as possible, and keep very cold until you 
put it in the oven. This is a very nice way to make biscuit 
where the family have hot bread twi:ce a day, as it will keep 
five days ; but there must be a good ice chest, and plenty 
of ice to have it work well. 

'White Mountain Rolls. 

For breakfast. Sixteen cups of flour, one half a cup 
of white sugar, one cup of butter, one of yeast, the whites 
of four eggs beaten to a stiff froth, and four cups of boiled 
milk. Melt the butter, have the milk blood-warm, and mix 
the bread ; set in a warm place, and rise over night ; in the 
morning shape into long rolls, rise one hour, and bake half 
an hour. 

Parker House Rolls. 

Take two quarts of flour, and rub into it a tablespoonful 
of lard and a little salt ; put in a deep bread-pan, and make 
, a hole in the flour, into which pour one pint of cold boiled 
milk and half a cup of yeast. Cover the pan, and let it 
stand all night ; in the morning stir it up and knead well. 



BREAD. 103 

and set in a warm place to rise ; let it rise to a light sponge 
(it will rise in an hour and a half), then roll it out on the 
board about half an inch thick ; cut with an oval cutter, 
and fold about two thirds of it ; lay them on tin sheets ; 
let them rise an hour, and then bake in a quick oven fifteen 
minutes. If you have breakfast at seven, you must be 
up at four to have them ready. 

Coffee Rolls. 

Take twelve cups of flour, one of white sugar, one half 
of butter or lard, one of yeast, one grated nutmeg, and 
three eggs. Mix with three large cups of warm milk, and 
let it rise over night ; if well risen in the morning, knead 
and set in a cool place until three o'clock in the afternoon, 
then shape into long rolls, as you do White Mountain rolls, 
and let them rise one hour and a half Bake half an hour 
in a moderate oven. When done, glaze them with a Httle 
milk in which a little brown sugar has been dissolved, and 
set them back in the oven for two minutes. These are for 
tea. They are nice, sliced thin, when cold. 

Bunns. 

Bunns are made the same as coffee rolls, with the addition 
of two cups of English currants. They are shaped like bis- 
cuit, only a little smaller. 

Soda Biscuit. 

Take one quart of flour, before it is sifted, and put into 
the sieve, and with it one teaspoonful of saleratus, two of 



104 MISS PARLOA S APPLEDORE COOK BOOK. 

cream of tartar, one of salt, and one tablespoonful of white 
sugar. Mix all these thoroughly with the flour ; then run 
through the sieve, and then rub in one spoonful of lard or 
butter. Wet with a little over half a pint of milk. Roll on 
the board about an inch thick ; cut with a biscuit cutter, and 
bake in a quick oven fifteen minutes. If you have not milk, 
use a little more butter, and wet with water. Handle as 
little and make as rapidly as possible. 

Cream of Tartar Rolls. 

Take one pint of flour, before it is sifted, put into the 
sieve with one teaspoonful of cream of tartar, one half of 
saleratus, one half of salt, one of sugar, and mix them 
together, then run them through the sieve ; wet with half a 
pint- of milk. Heat and grease the French roll pan, and 
put a large spoonful into every compartment ; set into a hot 
oven, and bake fifteen minutes. This quantity will make 
just one roll pan full. 

Sour Milk Biscuit. 

Rub half a spoonful of butter or lard into one quart of 
flour, and wet it with one quart of sour milk, into which you 
have previously stirred one teaspoonful of saleratus, which had 
been dissolved in a little hot water. Use as much more flour 
as you find necessary to make the dough stiff enough to roll 
out. Roll on the board about an inch thick and cut with a 
biscuit cutter. Bake in a quick oven. If you use lard for 
shortening, add one teaspoonful of salt. 



BREAD. lOS 

Buttermilk Rolls. 

Take two coffee cups of buttermilk, and stir into it one 
teaspoonful of saleratus dissolved in a little hot water, and 
stir into this about five cups of flour ; beat this up lightly, 
and bake in French roll pans, the same as cream of tartm- 
rolls. These are very nice. This will make two roll pans 
full. 

Graham Rolls. 

Take two coffee cups of sour milk, and stir into it one 
teaspoonful of saleratus, one of salt, half a cup of sugar, two 
eggs, one cup of flour, and Graham enough to make a stiff 
batter. Bake the same as cre^m of tartar rolls, allowing ten 
minutes longer. 

Grraham Rolls, No. 2. 

Take one cup of ice water, half a teaspoonful of salt, and 
Graham enough to make a thick batter ; beat this lightly, 
and bake in French roll pans in a quick oven. This makes 
one pan full. 

Corn Rolls. 

Corn rolls are made the same as Graham, using Indian 
meal instead of Graham. 

Corn Cake. 

Three teacups of Indian meal, one teaspoonful of salt, one 
tablespoonful of sugar, one of butter ; wet this with boiling 
water, and then beat in one egg ; spread half an inch deep 
on buttered tin sheets, and bake brown in a quick oven. 
This is delicious.

Corn Cake, ITo. 2. 

Three cupfuls of Indian meal, one of flour, one teaspoon- 
ful of salt, one tablespoonful of sugar, and one of yeast. 
Mix this with cold water enough to make a thin batter ; let 
it rise over night, and in the morning add one teaspoonful of 
saleratus and one tablespoonful of melted butter. Bake in 
round tin plates in a quick oven. 

Corn Cake, No. 3. 
One pint of new milk, one pint of Indian meal, one pint 
of flour, half a cup of sugar, three eggs, one teaspoonful of 
saleratus, two of cream of tartar, salt. Measure the meal 
and flour after they have been sifted, and put into the sieve 
with the saleratus, cream of tartar, sugar, and salt. Mix well 
together and sift. Break the eggs into the pan in which you 
intend mixing the corn cake, and beat light ; then turn in 
the milk and stir in the meal. Bake in tin plates in a quick 
oven. 

Corn Cake, No. 4. 

One pint of Indian meal, one handful of flour, half a cup 
of rice (measured before it is boiled) boiled soft, one quart 
of new milk, and a spoonful of salt. Boil the rice as directed 
for a vegetable, and drain dry (it may be boiled the night 
previous if you choqse), and turn it into the milk; set the 
milk on in hot water, and let it boil, and when boiling, pour 
it on the meal and flour. Beat the eggs well and stir into 
the mixture. Turn it an inch deep into buttered pans, and 
bake thirty-five minutes. This can be made with or without 
the rice. 



BREAD. 107 

Rye Drop Cakes. 

Three well-beaten eggs, one pint of new milk, one cup of 
flour, one teaspoonful of salt, one tablespoonful of sugar, 
one cupful and a half of rye meal ; half fill earthen cups, 
put them in an old pan (the one you use for baking pota- 
toes), set in the oven, and bake one hour. 

Flour Drop Cakes. 

Flour drop cakes are made the same as rye, using one 
pint of milk and one pint of flour. 

Graham MufiSns. 

Into a bowl put one and a half pints of Graham, half a 
cup of sugar, and a little salt. Now into the sieve put- half 
a pint of flour, one teaspoonful of saleratus and two of cream 
tartar. Mix thoroughly with the flour, and then sift on to 
the material in the bowl. Mix all the ingredients thoroughly 
while dry, and then add two well-beaten eggs and milk 
enough to make a batter that will drop from the spoon 
readily. Fill the muffin-cups about two thirds full, and bake 
in a quick oven. 

Rye MufBns. 

Made the same as Graham. 

Corn Dodgers.

inch thick, and fry in boiling fat until brown. They will fry 
in fifteen or twenty minutes. To be eaten very hot. 

■Waffles. 

One pint of sifted flour, milk enough to make a thin batter, 
which will be about two thirds of a pint, a small piece of 
butter melted (about a tablespoonful after being melted), 
two eggs beaten very light, a little salt. Mix the milk with 
the flour gradually until it is a smooth paste, then the salt 
and melted butter, and last the well-beaten eggs. Have the 
waffle-irons about as hot as a griddle for cakes, and butter 
them well. Pour in enough of the batter to cover the iron, 
and put the other side down gently on it. Let it stand over 
the fire about thirty seconds, and then turn over and let the 
other side remain to the fire the same time, then remove and 
place where they will keep warm . until there are enough 
cooked to serve. 

Many persons butter the waffles as they place them on the 
dish, and others add sugar. It is very well to do so if that 
is known to be the taste of all the family ; but it is always 
safe to let people do those things at the table. 

Waffles can be made with batters — given under the rules 
for bread, rice, and Indian griddle-cakes ; also hominy. 

riour Drop Cakes, No. 2. 

One pint of new milk, four eggs, two tablespoonfuls of 
sugar, half a cup of butter, and four and a half of flour.

Grraham Drop Cakes. 

Graham drop cakes are made the same as rye, with the 
addition of half a cup of sugar. 



Muffins. 

One quart of milk, one cup of yeast, nine cups of flour, 
butter the size of a walnut, and four eggs. Make a batter 
with the milk, butter, yeast, and flour ; beat the eggs and 
stir in ; set in a warm place, and let it rise four hours, and 
then bake in buttered muffin-rings, or fry on the griddle in 
rings.

together, and then add the eggs well beaten ; with this mix 
the milk, and then beat in the flour in which the saleratus 
and cream of tartar have been mixed. Bake in buttered 
muffin-rings in a quick oven. 

Sour Milk or Buttermilk Cakes. 

Two coffee cups of sour milk or buttermilk, one teaspoon- 
ful of saleratus dissolved in a little hot water, and flour 
enough to pour. Grease the griddle with a piece of fat salt 
pork, and fry the cakes a light brown.

Rice Cakes. 

Make with sour milk, as directed above, and add two 
well-beaten eggs, one cup of boiled rice, and one teaspoon- 
ful of salt. They require a longer time to fry than the plain 
do, but are very nice. 

Hominy Griddle-cakes. 

To one pint of warm, boiled hominy add a pint of rhilk 
or water, and flour enough to make a thin batter ; beat up 
two or three eggs, and stir them into the batter with a little 
salt. Fry as any other griddle-cake. They are delicious.

Indian Cakes. 

Make as the first, using half flour and half Indian meal, 
and one teaspoonful of salt. These require a longer time to 
fry than when made with all flour. 

Bread Cakes. 

Take stale bread and soak it in milk ; when soft, run it 
through a cullender. To one quart of this add one tea- 
spoonful of saleratus, two eggs, one cup of flour, one tea- 
spoonful of salt, two tablespoonfuls of sugar, and half a nut- 
meg. These also take some time to cook. The eggs may 
be omitted if you choose, but you must then use half a cup 
more of flour.

Buck-wheat Cakes. 



One pint of warm water, half a cup of yeast, one tea- 
spoonful of salt, half a cup of Indian meal, two tablespoon- 
fuls of molasses, and buckwheat enough to make a thin 
batter ; let this rise over night ; in the morning sift in one 
teaspoonful of saleratus, and fry. If you have them every 
morning, save a little of the batter to rise them with, instead 
of using fresh yeast every time. The Indian meal may be 
omitted if you prefer them without ; in this case use a little 
more buckwheat. They may be made with sour milk, as 
the flour are made, by substituting buckwheat for flour ; but 
they are not so good as when raised. Buckwheat is so fine 
that care must be taken to stir and beat well from the bot- 
tom, or there will be lumps of dry buckwheat there. 

Baked Buck-wheat Cake. 

Mix and rise the buckwheat over night, as for griddle- 
cakes, only a little stifier ; in the morning heat French roll 
pans very hot in the oven ; grease them, turn in the batter, 
and bake. 

Fried Mush. 

Into one quart of boiling water stir one tablespoonful of 
salt, and one cup of flour mixed with one quart of Indian 
meal (it may take a little more than a quart of meal to make 
it stiff enough) ; beat it well, or it will be lumpy. Boil gen- 
tly two hours, and then turn into dishes which have been 
dipped in cold water, and set away to cool. Pans in which 



112 MISS PARLOA S APPLEDORE COOK BOOK. 

you bake loaves of bread are the best to cool it in, as it 
then makes handsome slices. In the morning cut into 
slices an inch thick, and fry brown in pork fat. Serve slices 
of fried pork with it. You can cook enough at one time for 
several breakfasts. If you do not wish to fry the mush, do 
not use the flour, and do not make quite so stiif. 

Bro'wn Bread Brewis. 

If you bake brown bread there will be a great deal of 
hard crust. Take this crust and put in a basin with a little 
salt, and cold water enough to cover it ; cover tight, and set 
on the fire to boil ; boil fifteen or twenty minutes, and serve 
in a deep dish. It must be dry and soft. This is very nice 
eaten with cold corned beef or cold tongue 5 it can also be 
eaten with milk or sirup. 

Oatmeal. 

Oatmeal, Indian meal, and hominy all require two things 
to make them perfect : that is, plenty of water when first 
put on to boil, and a long time to boil. 

Have about two quarts of boiling water in a large stew- 
pan, and into it stir one cup of oatmeal, which you have 
already wet with cold water ; boil this an hour, stirring often, 
and then add half a spoonful of salt and boil an hour longer. 
If it should get too stiff add more boiling water ; or, if too 
thin, boil a little longer : you cannot boil it too much. 

The only trouble there is in cooking oatmeal is that it 
takes a long time, and surely no one will let that stand in

the way when it is so much better for having the extra time. 
It is also very necessary that there be an abundance of water 
to begin with ; if not, it will never be as good, no matter 
how much may be added after it has been cooking any time. 

Hominy. 

Wash in two waters one cup of hominy, then stir it into 
one quart of boiling water with a little salt, and boil from 
thirty to sixty minutes : it is better boiled sixty than thirty. 
Be careful that it does not burn. Hominy can be used more 
than oatmeal, as it can be eaten with any kind of meat, and 
should be cooked once a day. It is nice and appropriate for 
any meal. It is also good eaten warm or cold with milk. 

Buttered Toast. 

Beat to a froth one cup of butter and three tablespoonfuls 
of flour ; pour over this one pint and a half of boiling water ; 
set this over a kettle of boiling water for ten minutes. Cut 
bread in slices half an inch thick ; toast brown and dip into 
this. Serve very hot. 

Milk Toast. 

Put one quart of milk in a tin pail or basin, and set into a 
kettle of boiling water. When it comes to a boil stir in two 
spoonfuls of flour, mixed with half a cup of milk, one spoon- 
ful of butter, and salt to taste ; let this boil ten minutes, and 
then put in the bread, which must be toasted brown. Cook 
five minutes longer and serve. 



I 14 MISS PARLOA S APPLEDORE COOK BOOK. 

French Toast. 

Soak bakers' bread, as for Italian fritters ; toast brown, 
butter, and serve hot. 

Sandwiches. 

Take the pieces of ham which are left on the bone after 
all the slices are cut off and chop rather fine. Cut bread 
into thin sKces (the milk yeast is the best for this) and but- 
ter. Now spread with the ham, and lay another buttered 
slice over this. Trim the edges. This is a very nice dish 
for evening parties or picnics. Fold them in a damp towel 
until they are sent to the table. They may be made by 
putting slices of cold ham, tongue, beef, or chicken between 
the slices of buttered bread. 




Remarks. 

While making pies and cakes, the first thing to be done is 
to build your fire and get your oven just right. Now sift 
your flour, and measure it ; count and break your eggs ; 
measure everything you are going to put in the cake ; lard 
your pans and line them with paper. Here is a formula, 
which it will be well to follow in making all kinds of cake in 
which you put butter. 

Beat the butter to a cream, and then ^idd the sugar gradu- 
ally ; then spice and any kind of liquor which you use, then 
the milk, then the eggs well beaten, then the flour, in which 
always mix thoroughly, while dry, the saleratus and cream 
of tartar, and if fruit, let that always be the last thing to be 
added. 

Tea Cake. 

One spoonful of butter, one cup of sugar, one of milk, one 
teaspoonful of saleratus, two of cream of tartar, and one pint

of flour. Beat the sugar and butter together, and then the 
two eggs ; next stir the milk with them, and then stir in the 
flour in which the saleratus and cream of tartar have been 
thoroughly mixed. Turn it, about an inch deep, into shal- 
low pans, and bake in a quick oven. To be eaten warm. 

Berry Cake. 

Make the same as tea cake, only measure the pint of flour 
before it is sifted, and stir in one pint of blueberries. 

Plain Cup Cake. 

Half a cup of butter, one of sugar, three of flour, one of 
milk, three eggs, one teaspoonful of saleratus, two of cream 
of tartar, and lemon or nutmeg to taste. Beat the butter 
light then add the sugar gradually, beating all the time until 
it is a cream, and then add the eggs, which have been 
beaten light, and the milk ; mix all these well together, and 
then stir in the flour, in which the saleratus and cream of 
tartar have been mixed. Flavor and bake either in loaves 
or sheets ; when done, the place on top where it has cracked 
open will look well done. If baked in loaves, it will take 
forty minutes ; in sheets, twenty. This quantity will make 
two small loaves. 

Rich Cup Cake. 

One cup of butter, two of sugar, one of milk, four of flour,

in the sieve the flour and .cream of tartar, and sift again. 
Beat the eggs to a stiff froth, beat the sugar into the eggs, 
and then add the seasoning ; add the flour, stirring it in 
quickly and lightly ; beat until you are ready to put it into 
the oven ; put it in a new pan, or a pan that has been used

Beat to a froth the white of one egg, and then beat in 
gradually one teacup of powdered sugar, which is mixed 
with a quarter of a pound of grated chocolate. Flavor with 
one teaspoonful of vanilla. Split any kind of light cake and 
spread with jelly ; then put on the icing, and set in a warm 
oven a few minutes to harden. 

Cake without Eggs. 

Four cups of flour, two of sugar, one and a half of boiled 
milk, one of butter (melted in the milk while boiling), one

White Mountain Cake. 

Make like Concord cake, and bake in sheets about one 
inch thick ; have all the cakes the same size. Have three 
cakes in a loaf; lay one cake on a board and spread with 
frosting ; then lay another on top of that, and spread this with 
frosting ; then lay on the third, and frost the whole, and set 
where it will dry. This is very handsome, and will keep a 
long time.

water a small pinch of sparkling gelatine. When ready 
to frost the cake, dissolve this in about one fourth of a 
wine-glass of boiling water, and then thicken with powdered 
sugar ; flavor with lemon, and spread on the cake. This 
will harden in fifteen or twenty minutes, and cuts nicely the 
first day, but is not so good to keep as that made with the 
white of egg.

sifted flour, six pounds of fruit, one pint of wine, one pint of 
yeast, eight nutmegs, mace, twelve eggs, one quart of milk.

add milk and yeast and flour enough to make a thick batter. 
Let it stand in a warm place until it is light, then add* flour 
enough to make as thick as for biscuit, and then shape and 
put in the pan in which it is to be baked, and let it stand 
two or three hours (three hours unless it is very warm 
weather), and bake in a moderate oven about forty minutes. 

It is always best to set the sponge at night, and then it 
will be ready to bake in the forenoon. If you want them 
warm for tea, of course you must set you*' sponge early in 
the morning.

One and a half cups of butter, one and a half of sugar,

eggs, nine cups of flour, two tablespoonfuls of ginger, two 
teaspoonfuls of cinnamon, two of saleratus, one nutmeg. 
This will make three large loaves.

Half a cup of butter, one of sugar, half of milk, two of 
flour, three eggs, the whites beaten separately, one teaspoon- 
ful of cream of tartar, one half of saleratus. Flavor with

Loaf Cake. 

Two cups of butter, five of sugar, two of sour milk, eight

Two thirds of a cup of butter, one and a half of sugar, 
two thirds of milk, three of flour, one of chopped raisins, 
three eggs, one teaspoonful of cream of tartar, one half of 
saleratus. Bake in sheets in a quick oven. 

Tnmbler Cake. 

One tumbler of butter, one of sugar, one of molasses, one 
of milk, five of flour, four eggs, one teaspoonful of saleratus, 
two of cream of tartar, spice to taste ; one pound of raisins, 
one of currants, half a pound of citron. Bake in a moder- 
ate oven two hours. 

Marble Cake. 

The White Part. — One half of a cup of butter, one and

pints of flour, one ounce of soda, one half of alum, one heap- 



CAKE. 133 

ing cup of butter, six eggs, one ounce of cinnamon, one 
pound of raisins. Boil the alum in part of the pint of water 
and let cool before mixing it with the other ingredients. 

Instead of the alum, one ounce of cream of tartar may be 
used. 

Rich Molasses G-ingerbread, 

Two cups of molasses, two of milk, one of melted butter, 
two and a half teaspoonfuls of saleratus, three eggs, one 
tablespoonful of ginger and one nutmeg, one cup of sugar, 
and eight cups of flour. Beat molasses, butter, sugar, and 
eggs together ; then dissolve the saleratus in the milk, and 
add it, with flour, ginger, and nutmeg ; beat up well, and 
pour about two inches deep into pans, and bake half an 
hour. This will keep well, but being nearly as expensive as 
cup cake, I would rather make it plainer and oftener. 

Soft Molasses Gingerbread, No. 2. 

One cup of molasses, one teaspoonful of saleratus, one of 
ginger, one tablespoonful of butter or lard, a pinch of salt, 
if you use lard. Stir this together, and then pour on one 
half a cup of boiling water, one pint of flour. Bake about 
one inch deep in a sheet. This is very nice if pains are 
taken to have the water boiling, and to beat it well when 
the flour is added. 

Soft Gingerbread, No. 3. 

One cup of molasses, one of sugar, one of sour milk, one 
tablespoonful of ginger, half of saleratus, one egg, and flour 



134 MISS PARLOA S APPLEDORE COOK BOOK. 

enough to make a thick batter. Bake about one inch deep 
in a tin sheet. 

Soft Gingerbread, No. 4. 

Six teacups of flour, three of molasses, one of cream, one 
of lard or butter, two eggs, one teaspoonful of saleratus, 
ginger. 

Hard Molasses G-ingerbread. 

One pint of molasses, half a cup of lard or butter (half a 
tablespoonful of salt when you use lard), one tablespoonful 
of ginger, one of saleratus ; beat all this together, and when 
well mixed add half a pint of cold water, and flour enough 
to roll. Roll this very thin, and cut in strips about three 
inches wide and six long, with a jagging-iron, and bake in 
a quick oven until brown. When you take them from the 
oven, lay them on a sieve to cool, and when cold, put them 
in a tin box that can be covered tight ; keep this in a dry 
closet, and they will keep nice and crispy for a month. 

Hard Gingerbread. 

One cup of sugar, one of butter, one third of molasses, 
one half of sour milk or cream, one teaspoonful of saler- 
atus, one tablespoonful of ginger, flour enough to roll. 
Roll thin, and cut in oblong pieces, and bake quickly. 
Care must be taken that there is not too much flour mixed 
in with the dough. All kinds of cakes that are rolled should 
have no more flour than is absolutely necessary to work it. 



CAKE. 135 

Hard Sugar Gingerbread. 

One cup of butter, two of sugar, one of sour milk, two 
eggs, one tablespoonful of ginger, one teaspoonful of salera- 
tus, and flour enough to roll. Beat the sugar and butter to 
a cream, then beat in the eggs ; add the ginger and sour 
milk in which the saleratus is dissolved, and then the flour. 
Roll about half an inch thick ; cut, bake, and keep the 
same as directed for hard molasses gingerbread. 

Ginger Snaps. 
One cup of molasses, one of butter, one of sugar, one 
tablespoonful of ginger, and two eggs. Put the molasses 
and butter in a tin pan, and set on the fire ; when it boils 
up, take off, and add the sugar and ginger. When they are 
well mixed, add the eggs, which have been well beaten, and 
then flour enough to roll. Put a small piece at a time on 
the board, and roll as thin as the blade of a knife ; cut into 
round cakes, and bake in a quick oven until they are a 
dark brown. Cool, and keep in a tin box, the same as hard 
gingerbread. 

Molasses Cookies. 

One cup of molasses, one of brown sugar, one of lard, one 
half of boiling water, one tablespoonful of ginger, one of sal- 
eratus, one of salt, and flour enough to roll. Beat sugar, lard, 
molasses, saleratus, and ginger together ; then pour on the 
boiling water, and mix in the flour. Roll about three 
quarters of an inch thick, and cut with a round cutter. 
Bake in a quick oven. 



136 MISS parloa's appledore cook book. 

Vinegar Cookies. 

Two cups of molasses, one of butter or lard, two eggs, 
two tablespoonfuls of vinegar, one of ginger, one of sal- 
eratus, and flour enough to roll. .Roll about half an inch 
thick, cut into round cakes, and bake in a quick oven. 

Sugar Cookies. 

One cup of sugar, half a cup of butter, one cup of milk, 
two eggs, half a nutmeg, one teaspoonful saleratus, and flour 
enough to roll. Beat sugar and butter to a cream, then add 
the eggs, well beaten ; dissolve the saleratus in the milk, and 
stir that in, then the flour. 

Sugar Cookies, No. 2. 

One cup of butter, two of sugar, five of flour, one tea- 
spoonful of saleratus dissolved m four of milk, one egg, 
flavor to taste. Roll and bake as seed cakes. 

Jumbles. 

Three cups of sugar, two of butter, three eggs, one tea- 
spoonful of saleratus, four tablespoonfuls of sour cream, 
and flour enough to roll. Beat sugar and butter to a cream, 
then add the eggs, which are well beaten, then the sour 
cream in which the saleratus is dissolved. Flavor with any- 
thing you please. Cut with an oval cutter. If you have a 
cutter that takes a piece out of the centre, use that. When^. 
you roll them, sift over the dough, before you cut it, granu- 
lated sugar, and then roll the pin lightly over it. This is a 



CAKE. 137 

much better way than to sift the sugar on after the cakes are 
put in the pan, for when sifted in the pan it burns on it, and 
spoils the looks of the pan and cakes. Great care must be 
taken in baking all kinds of cakes which you roll on the 
board, as they burn very quickly;' and again, if they are not 
baked enough, they will not be nice, keep well, nor be health- 
ful. AVhere there are children, this is the most economical 
way to make cake, but takes more time ; and also in fam- 
ilies where they do not care for cake, they are nice to keep 
in case of unexpected company. 

Jumbles, No. 2. 

Three cups of sugar, two of butter, five of flour, one egg, 
half a teaspoonful of soda, flavor to taste. Roll thin, sprinkle 
with sugar, and cut with a cutter that will take a piece from 
the centre. Bake in a quick oven. 

Vanilla Jumbles. 

One cup of butter, two of sugar, three eggs, one wine- 
glass of wine, one spoonful of vanilla, and flour enough to 
roJL out. Roll as thin as the blade of a knife, and cut with 
an oval cutter. Bake on tin sheets, in a quick oven, until a 
dark brown. These will keep a year, if kept in a tin box 
and in a dry place. 

Seed Cakes. 

Three fourths of a pint of sugar, one cup of butter, one 
quart and half a pint of flour, one teaspoonful of saleratus, 



138 MISS parloa's appledore cook book. 

two eggs, seeds. Roll thin, cut into round cakes, and bake 
quickly. 

Seed Cakes, No. 2. 

Butter the size of an egg, two cups of sugar, and four of 
flour, half a teaspoonful of saleratus, and milk to wet it so 
that it will roll easily ; seeds to taste. Roll about half an 
inch thick, and bake in a quick oven. 

Shrevrsbury Cakes. 

Two cups of butter, one pint of sugar, three pints of flour, 
four eggs, one half a tablespoonful of mace. Roll thin, cut 
into small cakes, and bake in a quick oven. There must 
not be a grain more flour used than what is given in the rule. 
The room that they are made in must be rather cool, and 
they cannot be made in very warm weather. They will keep 
a long time, and are perfectly delicious. 

Plain Doughnuts. 

One pint of flour, half a cup of sugar, one spoonful of 
butter, one teaspoonful of cream of tartar, one half of salera- 
tus, half a nutmeg, and milk enough to wet and roll. Soften 
the butter and mix with the milk (about one cupful) ; mix the 
sugar, saleratus, cream of tartar, and the nutmeg with 
the flour, and stir into the butter and milk. After beating 
well with the spoon, put on the board, roll about an inch 
thick, and cut in any shape you please. Have ready boiling 
lard or drippings, and fry until done, which will be in about 
eight minutes. The addition of two eggs is an improvement, 



CAKE. 139 

but not necessary. A\'hen you have finished frying, cut a. po- 
tato in slices and put in the fat to clarify it, then set the kettle 
one side until it settles, then strain into an earthen pot (keep 
one on purpose for this), and set in a cool place. The sedi- 
ment which remains in the bottom put in the soap grease. 
Many persons fry doughnuts in the common frying-pan, but 
there is not depth enough to it. It is much better, if you 
have not an iron kettle that is deep enough, to use a granite- 
ware basin. 

Raised Doughnuts. 

One cup of sweet milk, one spoonful of butter, four of 
yeast, four of sugar, half a nutmeg, and flour to make a stiff 
batter ; let this rise over night. In the morning roll out, cut 
in strips, with a jagging-iron, about four inches long and two 
wide, and fry. Common raised dough makes very nice 
ones to be eaten as soon as fried, either for breakfast or tea. 

Doughnuts should not be eaten before November or after 
April ; indeed, they are not very healthful to eat at any time. 
Keep covered in a stone pot in the cellar. 

Crullers. 

A piece of butter the size of an egg, one cup of sugar, 
one nutmeg, three eggs. Make stiff with flour, and cut in 
fanciful shapes. Fry in boiling lard. 

Cream Cakes. 
Turn on one cup of butter one pint of boiling water. 
Stir two good-sized cups of flour into this, then take off and 



I40 MISS PARLOA S APPLEDORE COOK BOOK. 

cool. When cool, stir in five well-beaten eggs. Drop on 
tins and bake. 

Filling. — Make the filling as for cream pies. It will 
take twice the quantity. 

Strawberry Short Cake. 

Two cups of flour, one cup of sour milk, butter the size of 
a walnut, one third of a teaspoonful of soda, one fourth of a 
teaspoonful of salt ; mix lightly, and bake in a quick oven. 
While baking take one pint and a half of strawberries, and 
mash fine. When the cake is baked, cut in two, and butter 
each part ; then put on the lower portion a layer of sugar, 
and then strawberries, then a layer of sugar, then lay on the 
other part, and serve immediately. 

Frosting. 

Beat to a froth the white of one egg. Beat into it, very 
gradually, one teacup of powdered sugar, and one scant 
tablespoonful of corn starch, and the juice of one lemon. 
Spread this over the cake, then wet a clean knife in cold 
water and smooth the frosting with it. Set in a warm, dry 
place to harden. 

Frosting, No. 2. 

Take about one sixteenth part of an ounce of gelatine and 
put in a bowl ; just moisten with cold water, and let it stand 
half an hour ; then pour on it boiling w^ter enough to dis- 
solve ; now stir in powdered sugar enough to thicken. Season 
with lemon, and spread on the cake. This is not so hand- 



CAKE. 141 

some as that made with the white of an egg, but is made 
quickly, and will harden in half an hour. Frost the cake 
while it is warm, as it dries more quickly and adheres better. 

Caramel Frosting. 

One cup of brown sugar, and one square of Baker's 
chocolate scraped fine, one tablespoonful of water. Sim- 
mer gently, being careful not to let it burn, twenty minutes. 
Sprea4 on the cake while hot. 

Golden Frosting. 

Into the yolks of two eggs stir powdered sugar enough to 
thicken, and flavor strong with lemon. This does not have 
as good a flavor as the other kinds, but it makes a change. 

Marking Cakes in Gold. 

Bake small round cakes for the children, and, when the 
frosting is hard on them, dip a small brush in the yolk of an 
egg, and write the child's name on the cake. It pleases 
the httle ones very much to see their names in this way.

Boiled Rice. 

Pick and wash clean one cupful of rice, and put into a 
basin with a pint and a half of cold water ; set on the stove 
where it will cook slowly ; or, better still, set into another 
basin of water, and cook slowly. When the rice has ab- 
sorbed all the water, turn on it one quart of new milk, and 
stir in one tablespoonful of salt ; let this cook two hours, stir- 
ring often. Serve with sugar and cream. 



Boiled Rice, No. 2. 

Pick and wash one cup of rice, and boil in one quart of 
boiling water fifteen minutes, and then drain dry. Wring a 
pudding-cloth out of boiling water, and spread in a deep 
dish, and turn the rice into it, and sprinkle in one cup of 
raisins and a tablespoonful of salt ; tie the cloth loosely that

PUDDINGS. 143 

the rice may have room to swell, and boil two hours. Serve 
with lemon sauce, or sugar and cream. 

Baked Rice. 

Boil half a cup of rice in one pint of water thirty minutes, 
and then add one quart of new milk, and boil thirty minutes 
longer ; then beat together one cup of sugar, three eggs, two 
teaspoonfuls of salt, and a little lemon or nutmeg ; stir this 
into the rice and turn the mixture into a buttered pudding- 
dish, and bake thirty minutes. To be eaten without sauce. 

Baked Rice, No. 2. 

Pick and wash one cup of rice ; put it in a dish that will 
hold two quarts and a pint, and cover with fresh milk'; stir 
into this two teaspoonfuls of salt, one tablespoonful of cinna- 
mon, and four of sugar. Set this in the oven, and stir once 
in every half hour ; after it has been baking two hours stir 
in milk enough to fill the dish, and bake one hour longer 
(the dish should be nearly full of milk at first). Serve with 
sugar and milk. 

Minute Pudding. 

One pint of milk, one of water, nine tablespoonfuls of 
flour, one teaspoonful of salt, two eggs. Set the milk into a 
basin of hot water, and when it comes to a boil add to it 
one pint of boiling water. Have ready the flour, made into 
a smooth paste with one cup of milk, and mix with this 
paste, after they are well beaten, the two eggs. Now take 
the basin in which the milk and water are, and set upon the

fire ; let it boil up once, and then stir in the thickening ; 
beat it well, that it may be smooth, and cook three minutes 
longer. Serve with vinegar sauce.

pound of stale grated bread, one pound of raisins, two of 
currants, one glass of brandy, two teaspoonfuls of ginger, 
two nutmegs, half a pint of milk, a little salt. Beat well and 
steam five hours. Serve with rich sauce. 

Princess Pudding. 

One box of sparkling gelatine. Soak one hour in one 
pint of cold water, and then add one pint of boiling water, 
and one pint of wine, the juice of four lemons, and three 
large cups of sugar. Beat the whites of four eggs to a 
stiff froth, and stir in the jelly when it begins to thicken ; 
pour into a large mould, set in ice-water in a cool place, and, 
when ready to serve, turn out as you would jelly, only that 
you have the pudding in a deep dish. 

Make a sauce as for snow pudding, and pour around the 
pudding, or, if you prefer, serve in a separate dish. This 
makes a large pudding : half of it is enough for a small 
family. 

Dovirn-East Pudding. 

One pint of molasses, one quart of flour, one tablespoon- 
ful of salt, one teaspoonful of soda, three pints of blackber-

ries. Boil three hours, and serve with sauce made in the 
following manner : — 

One teacup of powdered sugar, one half of butter, one 
egg, two teaspoonfuls of boiling water, and one of brandy. 
Beat the butter to a cream, and then add very gradually the 
sugar beat in the yolk of the egg, and, when perfectly creamy, 
add the white, which has been beaten to a froth ; then add 
the water and stir it very carefully. The brandy should be 
beaten with the butter and sugar. 

Boiled Indian Pudding. 

Four cups of Indian meal, one cup of beef suet chopped 
fine, one cup of molasses, a little salt. Pour on boiling water 
enough to make a thick batter. Boil in a cloth, tied very 
loosely, two hours or more. Put in the pot before the water 
quite boils. Serve with butter and sirup.

Corn Starch Pudding. 

One quart of milk, six tablespoonfuls of corn starch, 
three eggs, one teaspoonful of salt. Put the milk in a basin, 
and set the basin into a kettle with boiling water, and when 
it comes to a boil stir in the corn starch and eggs, which 
prepare in the following manner : Wet the corn starch with 
one cup of cold milk, and then stir into it the eggs which 
are well beaten. After the starch is added to the boiUng 
milk it will cook in three minutes : beat well to make smooth. 
Serve with sugar and cream, or wine sauce. Never add the 
eggs after the starch has been stirred into the boiling milk ; if 
you do the egg will be in spots in it. 



Quaking Pudding. 

Take as much stale bread as will fill a quart basin after it 
is cut ; now butter well a tin mould or pail that will cover 
tight, and put in a layer of bread ; then strew in a few 
raisins, and then bread, and so on until the bread is all used 
(the bread must be cut very thin). Make a custard of three 
pints of milk and six eggs, and season with salt and nut- 
meg ; turn this on the bread, and -set away in a cool place 
two hours, and then set in a steamer and steam three. Serve 
with wine sauce. This may be boiled in a pudding-cloth. 
When boiled, prepare the same as for steaming, omitting 
the buttering of the dish, and let it soak two hours and a 
half, then turn into the pudding-cloth, tie tight, and boil two 
hours and a half.

Bride's Pudding. 

Make the same as plain corn starch pudding, using the 
yolks of six eggs. Butter a pudding-dish, and turn the 
pudding into it (do not fill within three inches of the top 
of the dish), and bake thirty minutes; then take from the 
oven, and let it stand in a cool place twenty minutes ; then 
cover with a meringue. Set in the oven ten minutes, and 
serve with cold sauce. To make the meringue, beat the 
whites of the eggs to a stiff froth, and then beat into them 
gradually one cup of sugar. This pudding is quite nice 
made with four eggs, but will not look so handsome. 

Bread Pudding. 

Take a quart basinful of stale bread, and soak in two 
quarts of sweet milk two hours (keep in a cool place while 
soaking) ; then mash well with a spoon, and take out all 
the hard pieces. Beat light four eggs and stir into this, 
then add two teaspoonfuls of salt, a little nutmeg, and one 
fourth of a cup of sugar, if you serve it with sauce ; if not, 
one and a half cupfuls. Bake three quarters of an hour, 
and serve with lemon sauce. Some put raisins in, but it 
must be much stiffer if you have them, and the delicacy of 
the pudding is thereby lost. 

Eve's Pudding. 

Six eggs, six apples, six ounces of bread, six ounces of 
sugar, six ounces of currants ; salt and nutmeg. Boil three 
hours or steam four. Serve with wine sauce. 



148 MISS parloa's appledore cook book.

sugar, four eggs, five tablespoonfuls strained apple, grated 
peel and juice of one lemon, nutmeg and rose-water, if you 
like. Bake in a shallow pudding-dish which has been lined 
with rich paste rolled very thin. Let it become partly 
cooled before it is served. 

Rachel Pudding. 

One quart of bread crumbs, one of apples, cut up very fine, 
half a cup of suet, which has been chopped very fine, one 
cup of English currants, rind and juice of two lemons, four 
eggs well beaten. Mix thoroughly, grease a pudding-mould, 
and put in the mixture. Steam three hours. Serve with 
rich wine sauce. 

Whortleberry Pudding. 

One cup of butter, two of sugar, one of sour milk, four of 
flour, five eggs, one teaspoonful of saleratus, and one quart 
of berries. Beat the sugar and butter to a cream, and add 
the eggs well beaten; then the sour milk, in which the sal- 
eratus is dissolved, and then the flour, and lastly the berries. 
Wring the pudding-cloth out of boiling water and spread it 
in a deep dish ; then turn the batter in and tie. Have 
ready a kettle of boiling water, and drop the pudding into 
it ; turn the pudding often, and boil three hours. Serve 
with vinegar or wine sauce. This can be steamed also. 
Allow half an hour longer to cook, when steamed.

Plain ^R^hortleberry Pudding. 

One pint of flour, one egg, half a pint of sweet milk, one 
teaspoonful of cream of tartar, half of saleratus, and a quart 
of berries. Beat the egg to a froth and mix with the milk ; 
then stir in the flour, in which the saleratus and cream of 
tartar are thoroughly mixed ; then the berries. Boil and 
serve as directed above. 

Baked Whortleberry Pudding.

milk, five eggs, one teaspoonful of saleratus, four cups of 
berries. Beat the sugar and butter to a cream ; then add 
the eggs, which have been well beaten, then the milk in 
which the saleratus is dissolved, and lastly, the berries. 
Bake one hour, and serve with a rich wine sauce. 

Boiled Apple Pudding. 

Pare, boil, and mash six good-sized mealy potatoes, and 
turn on them half a pint of boiling milk, then stir in a 
teaspoonful of salt and a tablespoonful of butter ; set in a 
cool place, and stir until about blood-warm ; then stir in 
flour enough to roll, and roll about an inch thick. Have a 
two-quart basinful of apples which are pared, cored, and 
quartered; spread these on the paste and grate a little nut- 
meg over them ; then roll up the paste, and boil as directed 
for berry pudding, and serve with either maple sirup, wine, 
or vinegar sauce. This can be steamed, allowing four hours 
for it to cook. 



150 MISS parloa's appledore cook book. 

Boiled Batter Pudding. 

Take one cup of flour, and add to it gradually one quart 
of sweet milk ; then stir in one teaspoonful of salt and six 
well-beaten eggs. Turn this into the pudding-cloth, and tie 
tight, leaving room for it to swell one third. Boil two hours. 
Serve with wine sauce. Great care must be taken in boiling 
puddings to have the water boiling when you put the pudding 
in, and to keep it boiling all the time. Steaming is the safer 
way, and I would always steam rather than boil, if I had the 
convenience. When boihng, always keep a kettle of boiling 
water to fill up, as it boils away from the pudding. For a 
pudding-cloth get three quarters of a yard of drilhng. Keep 
an old saucer to put in the bottom of the kettle, in which 
you boil the pudding, to prevent its being burned. When 
you are ready to dish the pudding, have a pan of cold water, 
into which plunge it immediately upon taking it from the 
kettle (but do not let it stand in cold water one second) ; 
then put it in a deep dish, and untie the string ; open the 
cloth and turn the pudding-dish on it ; then lift the pudding 
up by means of the cloth, and turn over. You will thus 
preserve the shape of the pudding. Batter puddings are 
very difficult to make, and I would not advise a young cook 
to try them at first. 

Baked Apple Pudding. 

Make a paste as directed for plain pie-crust, and line a 
dish with it, and fill the dish with sliced apples. To a dish 
holding three quarts, allow one cup of sugar, one half of 



PUDDINGS. 151 

molasses, one of water, one nutmeg, and half a teaspoon of 
cinnamon : cover this with the paste, and bake slowly three 
hours. Serve with sugar and cream, or with cold sauce. 



Pan Do'wdy. 

Pare and slice tart apples enough to fill, about two inches 
deep, a flat earthen or tin pan. To three quarts of apple 
add one cup of sugar, one grated nutmeg, one cup of cold 
water, and butter the size of a walnut. Cover this with 
plain pie-crust (have the crust about an inch thick), and 
bake slowly two hours and a half; then cover and set where 
it will keep hot one hour. Serve with sugar and cream. 
AVhen done the apple will look red. Do not break the 
crust into the apple after baking, as by this means you spoil 
the pastry. If you wish to have it richer, cover with puff 
paste. 

Apple DoTwdy. 

Pare and quarter about one dozen good tart apples, put 
them in a kettle with one cup of molasses, a small piece of 
butter, and one pint of hot water. Set this on the fire, and 
let it come to a boil, and while it is heating make a paste 
with one pint of flour, one teaspoon of cream of tartar, one 
half of saleratus, and a little milk ; roll this large enough to 
fit into the kettle, and when the mixture begins to boil, put 
the paste in, cover tight, and boil gently twenty minutes. 
To be eaten without sauce. This is very nice when the 
apples are tart and it is made well.

Apple Charlotte. 

Butter a brown earthen dish, and place around the sides 
slices of bread which have been cut about an inch thick, 
soaked in cold water, and buttered ; fill the dish with 
sliced apples, and grate over them one nutmeg ; strew on 
one cup of sugar, and then pour on one cup of water ; 
this will carry the sugar through the apple. Cover the 
apple with slices of soaked and buttered bread, then cover 
the whole with a large plate, and bake in a very moderate 
oven four hours. Remove from the oven half an hour 
before time to dish, and set where iY will be cooling. 
When ready to dish, loosen gently round the edges with a 
knife, lay the dish in which you intend serving it on the 
one in which it was baked, turn the dishes over, and lift 
the pudding-dish off. This is a very handsome dish. Serve 
with sugar and cream or plain.

after it has been well buttered, put as many pared and 
cored apples as will stand in the dish ; turn over them the 
sago, and bake one hour in a moderate oven. Serve with 
sugar and cream.

and cream. (Use in all one cup of sugar.) Bread may be 
used instead of cake. 

Omelette Souffle. 

Beat together the yolks of four eggs and two spoonfuls of 
sugar ; then beat to a froth the whites of eight eggs and stir 
into the yolks and sugar. Flavor with half a teaspoonful of 
bitter almond. Turn into a buttered dish and bake twelve 
minutes. Serve instantly.

Rich Wine Sauce. 

Beat to a cream half a cup of butter, and very gradually 
beat in one cup of sugar, one spoonful of corn starch, one 
wine-glass of wine, and the white of one egg. When this is a 
perfect froth stir in one third of a cup of boiling water ; set 
this in warm water for two minutes, stirring all the while, and 
then serve. 

Plain Wine Sauce. 

Put into a sauce-pan one cup of sugar and one cup of 
water ; grate into this half a nutmeg, and put on the fire to 
simmer ; let it simmer half an hour, and then add one glass 
of wine ; simmer ten minutes longer, and serve. 



Lemon Sauce. 

Beat to a froth one spoonful of butter, one cup of sugar, 
one spoonful of corn starch, and two eggs. When very

smooth and light, add one cup of boiling water. Set the 
basin into boiling water, and stir five minutes. Season with 
lemon and serve. 

Vinegar Sauce. 

One cup of boiling water, one of sugar, one tablespoonful 
of flour, one of vinegar, and a little nutmeg. Mix the flour 
with a little cold water, and stir into the boiling sugar and 
water ; then stir in the vinegar and nutmeg, and boil twenty 
minutes. Wine sauce is very good made in this manner, 
using wine instead of vinegar. Season with a little salt. 

Cream Pudding Sauce. 

One cup of powdered sugar, one egg, one third of a cup 
of cream or milk. Beat the white of the egg to a stiff froth, 
then add the yolk and sugar, and beat well. Flavor with 
vanilla, lemon, or wine, and add the cream the last thing. 
This sauce is nice for a light pudding. 




Plain Pie Crust. 

Into one quart of flour rub a large spoonful of salt and 
half a cup of lard, and then wet with ice-water enough to 
make a soft paste ; roll this on the board until it is about 
half an inch thick, then spread on half a cup of washed 
butter, dredge with flour, and fold into a small square. Pound 
lightly with the rolling-pin, then roll out again ; roll it up, 
and set on the ice to harden ; it will be ready to use in two 
hours. In winter it can be used immediately. To make 
the bottom crust, rub three quarters of a cup of lard into one 
quart of flour and one spoonful of salt, and wet with cold 
water to make a soft paste. Do not roll, as it makes it 
tough. Butter is more healthful than lard ; therefore, if you 
can afford it, use it. 

Puff Paste. 

Two cups of butter, one quart of flour, one tablespoonful 
of salt, one of powdered sugar. Wash the butter in cold 
1 66 



PIES. 167 

water until it is light and waxy ; divide into two parts and 

set in the ice-chest one hour. Mix the sugar and salt with 

the dry flour, and then wet with ice-water enough to make a 

soft paste (mix with a knife, and use the hands as little as 

possible) ; roll this on the board with the rolling-pin, about 

half an inch thick ; now cut one of the cakes of washed 

butter into thin slices, and spread on the paste ; dredge with 

flour and fold up ; then pound lightly with the pin, and 

roll out as before, and spread the second cake of butter the 

same as the first ; dredge and fold again ; now roll thin as 

before, and then roll up and place on a plate, and set in the 

ice-chest one or two hours. When ready to cover the pie, 

cut just enough from the end of the roll to cover the pie ; 

sprinkle the board with a little flour, place the paste upon 

it, and flour the rolling-pin with the hand ; now roll from 

you, and towards your left hand ; roll very lightly until the 

right size ; then cover and bake immediately. Quickness 

and elasticity are very important ; also the washing of the 

butter. Use as little flour as possible in rolling the paste ; 

always make it in a cool room. It is a mistake to think the 

paste must be hard to be good ; always have it soft enough 

to roll easily. 

Cream Paste. 

To one quart of flour add one spoonful of salt, and mix 
to a soft paste with sweet cream ; roll thin and spread with 
cream and dredge with flour, fold, and roll again ; repeat this 
operation three times, then make the pies. Pies made with 
this paste taste nice, and are not hurtful, but do not look as 
handsome as when made with butter and lard.

Berry Pies. 

Line the plates, and fill as full as you can with berries, 
and dredge on about half a spoonful of flour, and two spoon- 
fuls of sugar, and two of water ; cover as directed for sliced 
apple pies, and bake forty minutes in a moderate oven. All 
berry pies are made in this manner, if they are very sour 
using more sugar. Cherries and currants do not require any 
water, but more sugar, and they must not be heaped in the 
plate as blueberries, blackberries, raspberries, and straw- 
berries are. 

Rhubarb Fiea. 

Cut the rhubarb in the morning, or if you buy it, always 
keep in a cool place until ready to cook it. Strip off the 
skin and cut it into pieces about an inch long ; stew in just 
enough water to prevent its burning ; when cold sweeten to 
taste. Cover the pie-plates, and roll the upper crust about 
half an inch thick ; cut into strips an inch wide, and after 
filling the plate with the rhubarb, put on four cross-pieces 
and the rim. Bake half an hour. 

Squash Pies. 

Pare, boil, and sift a good dry squash. To one quart of 
the squash pour on two of boiling milk, and then stir in two 
cups of sugar, two spoonfuls of salt, one of cinnamon, one 
grated nutmeg, and five well-beaten eggs. Line deep plates 
with plain paste, fill with the mixture, and bake one hour in 
a moderate oven. The pies look nice to boil a stick of cin- 
namon in the milk instead of using the ground. 



PIES. 169 

Cranberry Pies. 

Stew the cranberries according to directions on page 44, 
and make the same as rhubarb pies. 

Gooseberry Pies. 

Stew the gooseberries in as Uttle water as possible, sweeten 
to taste, and make the same as rhubarb pies. 

Pumpkin Pies. 

Pare and cut the pumpkin into small pieces ; wash and 
put into the kettle with one quart of water ; boil six hours, 
stirring often to prevent burning ; then run it through a sieve. 
Make the same as squash, adding a teaspoonful of ginger. 
They may be made without eggs by using five pounded 
crackers. Cook enough of the pumpkin at a time to last 
two weeks ; after you have kept it one week, set in the oven 
and scald, then set away in a cool place. 

Custard Pies. 

Line a deep plate with paste ; make the custard the same 
as for custard pudding ; fill the plate, and bake until firm in 
the centre. 

Mince Pies. 

Boil a shank of beef six hours ; then take up and set 
away to cool. (Save the Hquor for soup.) When cold, 
free from bones and cut off all the fat and gristle ; then 
chop fine. To one quart of the chopped meat add three 



I/O MISS PARLOA S APPLEDORE COOK BOOK. 

of chopped apple, one pint of chopped suet, one quart of 
chopped raisins, one quart of sugar, one of molasses, half a 
cup of cinnamon, one quarter of a cup of clove, one quar- 
ter of a cup of allspice, one quarter of a cup of ground 
mace, six grated nutmegs, half a cup of salt. Mix this 
thoroughly with the hands, then turn on the mixture three 
quarts of good cider, and let the mixture stand over night. 
In the morning scald, in a porcelain kettle, one hour ; then 
put in stone pots ; cover tight and keep in a cool, dry place. 
This will keep three months. To tell the exact amount of 
spice and sweetening is almost impossible, as tastes vary ; 
but with a little judgment, and the rule I have given, I think 
there cannot be any very serious trouble. Prepare the paste 
and plates as for stewed apple pies, and put ' in the meat ; 
then grate a little nutmeg over it, and strew a few whole 
raisins in ; cover and bake one hour in a moderate oven. 

Mince Pies, No. 2. 

Two pounds of tender, lean beef; chop it while raw very 
fine ; take one cupful of chopped suet, two pint bowlfuls of 
chopped apple, one of stoned raisins, half a bowlful of cur- 
rants, half a pound of citron, one bowlful of sugar, one half 
of molasses, two tablespoonfuls of mace, two of cinnamon, 
one of allspice, one of cloves, four grated nutmegs, three 
tablespoonfuls of salt. Mix all this thoroughly with the 
hands, and then add one quart of cider. Put the mixture in 
a large earthen pan, and place over a kettle of boiling water 
and scald ; if there is not sugar and spice enough, season to 
taste. When scalded, stir in one pint of wine and half a 



PIES. 171 

pint of brandy. Do not let any one kind of spice predomi- 
nate. If not moist enough, use more cider. Prepare the 
plates as for apple pies, and spread in a cupful of the mince 
meat and cover with a rich puff paste. Bake one hour. 

Mock Mince Pies. 
Two pounded crackers, one cup of molasses, one of cider, 
one of chopped raisins, two eggs, one teaspoonful of salt, 
one of clove, two of cinnamon, one of mace, one nutmeg. 
Bake forty minutes. This quantity makes two pies. 

Sliced Apple Pies. 
Line the plates with bottom crust, and fill the plate with 
quartered apples. To a common-sized plate allow two 
spoonfuls of sugar, a little nutmeg, and two spoonfuls of 
water. Cut the upper crust a little larger than the plate, 
and raise the under crust with the blade of the knife, and 
lay it under it. Bake in a moderate oven one hour. When 
molasses is preferred, use three spoonfuls, and a little cinna- 
mon instead of nutmeg. 

Stewed Apple Pies. 

Pare, core, and stew the apples with just water enough to 
prevent their burning. To a quart of stewed apple allow one 
cup of sugar. Bottom the plates and roll a piece of the top 
crust out (making it long enough to go around the plate), 
cut into strips an inch wide, and lay around the plate, then 
put in the apple. (Do not make the pie too thick.) Grate 
over it a little nutmeg, cover, and bake in a rather quick oven 
forty minutes. 



172 MISS parloa's appledore cook book. 

Green Apple Fies. 
Pare, quarter, core, and stew nice tart apples in water enough 
to prevent them from burning. When tender, sweeten very 
sweet with white sugar, fill the pie-plate, "which has been lined 
and edged with paste, grate on a little nutmeg, cover, and 
bake forty-five minutes. 

Cried Apple Pies. 
Cook the apple according to the directions given for dried 
apple sauce, and make the same as stewed apple pie. 

Dried Apple Fies, No. 2. 

Pick and wash one quart of dried apples, and put in a por- 
celain kettle with two quarts of water and two of cider ; let 
this stand over night, and in the morning place on the fire 
and simmer three hours ; then lay in (but do not stir) two 
' quarts of sugar, and simmer two hours longer ; then turn into 
a stone pot, and put away for use. Make the pies the same 
as green apple. 

Peach Fies. 

Line the plate with plain paste, and lay in the plate five 
peaches, which just press between the fingers, but do not 
take out the stones, as they flavor the pie ; now fill the plate 
with peaches which have been cut in two and the stones 
taken out. Sift over this a small cup of sugar, and then add 
two spoonfuls of water. Cover and bake in a moderate oven 
one hour. Do not peel the peaches ; they are very much 
better not to be. 



PIES. 173 

Plum Pies. 

Make the same as peach. 

Marlborough Pies. 

Steam until tender six good-sized tart apples, and then run 
them through the cullender ; stir in, while they are hot, one 
spoonful of butter ; when cool, stir in the yolks of three eggs, 
the rind and juice of one lemon, and one teacup of sugar, 
which have been beaten together. Bake in a moderate oven 
forty minutes, in a deep plate, as squash pies. Cut and bake 
little cakes of puff paste, and when the pie is cold, garnish it 
with them. 

Lemon Pies. 

Line a medium-sized plate with plain paste, and rim with 
three thicknesses of puff paste ; set the plate in a cool place 
until the filling is ready. Beat to a froth one teacup of 
sugar, the rind and juice of one lemon, and the yolks of two 
eggs ; then beat the whites of two eggs to a stiff froth, and 
stir in with one spoonful of milk ; turn this into the plate 
which you have prepared, and bake in a moderate oven 
forty-five minutes. Or you may line a deep plate with plain 
paste, as for squash pies, and turn the mixture into it, and 
bake forty minutes. This is very nice if the directions are 
exactly followed. 

Lemon Pies, No. 2. 
The juice of two and the rind of three lemons, one cup 
of butter, one and a half of sugar, eight eggs. Beat the 
sugar, butter, lemons, and the yolks of the eggs together ; 



174 MISS PARLOA S APPLEDORE COOK BOOK. 

then add the whites beaten to a stiff froth. Bake in deep 
plates, lined with plain paste, fifty minutes in a moderate 
oven. 

Lemon Pies, No. 3. 

Soak a pounded cracker in one pint of new milk ; stir into 
this the yolks of three and the whites of two eggs, which " 
have been beaten with half a cup of sugar and the rind and 
juice of one lemon. Bake in a deep plate, which has been 
lined with plain paste, half an hour. When cooked, beat 
the white of one egg to a froth, and stir in one spoonful of 
sugar ; set in the oven until a light brown. 

Lemon Pies, No. 4. 

Take two lemons and grate away the outside, and not use 
it. Chop the rest very fine ; into two teacups of hot water, 
stir two spoonfuls of corn starch, and boil ; add two teacups 
of sugar ; when cool, add the beaten yolks of four eggs and 
the chopped lemon; stir well together. Line two plates, 
and pour in the mixture and bake. Beat the whites of the 
eggs to a froth with six tablespoonfuls of sugar. Spread this 
over the pies ; set in the oven again and bake a light brown. 

SvT-eet-Potato Pie. 

When the potatoes are dry and mealy, one quart of the 
potato after it has been pared, boiled, and mashed, one 
quart of milk, four eggs, salt, nutmeg, cinnamon, and sugar 
to sweeten to taste. Bake the same as squash pies. If the 
potatoes are very moist, use less milk.

Graham Pies. 

Into a pint of Graham flour, stir one teaspoonful of salt ; 
wet with boiling water enough to make a stiff paste. Roll 
this very thin, and cut into cakes about three inches in 
diameter ; put into these a spoonful of apple sauce and fold 
them. Bake on tin sheets. These can be eaten by any 
dyspeptic. Mrs. Celia Thaxter. 

Cream Pies. 

Three eggs beaten with one and a half cups of sugar, half 
a cup of cold water, two cups of flour in which are mixed 
one half teaspoonful of saleratus, one of cream of tartar. 
Flavor with lemon. Bake in deep tin plates such as you 
use for squash pies, and when cool split with a sharp knife 
and fill. This will make four pies. 

Filling for Cream Pies. 

One pint of new milk, one cup of sugar, half a cup of 
flour, two eggs. Put the basin, in which the milk is, into 
another of hot water. Beat the sugar, flour, and eggs to- 
gether until they are light and smooth, and when the milk 
boils, stir in with one teaspoonful of salt. Cook twenty 
minutes, stirring often. Flavor with lemon. This will fill 
four pies. 

Washington Pies. 

Make the outside the same as for cream pies, and fill with 
any kind of jelly or jam you choose. 



176 MISS parloa's appledore cook book. 

Filling for Chocolate Pies. 

One square of Baker's chocolate, one cup of sugar, the 
yolks of two eggs, and one third of a cup of boihng milk. 
Mix scraped chocolate and sugar together, then add, very 
slowly, the boiling milk, then the eggs, and simmer about 
ten minutes, taking care not to burn the mixture. Flavor 
with vanilla. Have perfectly cold before using. The cake 
must always be fresh. 




Charlotte Russe. 



Cut stale sponge cake into slices about half an inch thick, 
and line three moulds with it, having a space of half an inch 
between each slice ; set the moulds where they will not be 
disturbed until the fiUing is ready. Now take a deep tin pan 
and fill about one third full of either snow or pounded ice, 
and into this set another pan that will hold at least four 
quarts. Into a deep bowl or pail put one pint and a half 
of cream (if the cream is thick, take one pint of cream and 
half a pint of milk), whip the cream to a froth, and when the 
bowl is full, skim the froth into the pan which is setting on 
the ice ; keep on doing this until the cream is all froth ; now 
with the spoon draw the froth to one side, and you shall find 
that there is some of the cream which has gone back to

milk ; turn this into the bowl again, and whip as before ; 
when the cream is all whipped, stir into it two thirds of a cup 
of powdered sugar, one teaspoonful of vanilla, and half a box 
of gelatine, which has been soaked in cold water, enough to 
cover it, one hour, and then dissolved in boiling water 
enough to dissolve it, which will be nearly half a cupful ; 
stir all this from the bottom of the pan until it begins to 
grow stiff; then fill the moulds, and set them on the ice in 
the pan for one hour, or until they are sent to the table. 
When ready to dish them, just loosen them at the sides, and 
turn out on a flat dish. Have the cream ice-cold when you 
begin to whip it ; it is a good plan to put a lump of ice into 
the cream while you are whipping it. 

The directions being so long, may make it appear to be a 
long and hard process ; but it is not so, for it is easily and 
quickly made. The whip-churn you can get made at your 
tinman's for a trifle, and as it will be 
found necessary to have one to make 
many of these dishes I give below di- 
rections for making it. 

A, is a hollow cylinder of tin, perforated in 
the bottom and upon the sides, as repre- 
sented. 

B, handle. 

C, dash of tin, and perforated like the bottom 
of the cylinder. 

D, cover, fitting close upon the upper end of 
the cylinder. Have the cylinder three 
inches in diameter and ten inches in 
height : the dash two and three quarters 

Inches in diameter, and the handle thirteen inches long. To be made 
of block tin. With care this will last in a private family fifty years.

Holland Cream. 

Make the same as Charlotte Russe, omitting the cake and 
vanilla. Flavor with half a wine-glass of Holland gin. Shape 
in blanc-mange moulds. 

Iietnon Cream. 

The grated rind of one and the juice of two lemons, a 
pint of water, one pint of sugar, six eggs. Beat the whites 
of the eggs and the lemon together, then add the water ; 
let this stand one hour ; then stir in the pint of sugar and 
the- yolks of the six eggs, and place over a gentle fire 
until it thickens. Stir continually. When it is thick, set 
one side until it is cool enough to turn into glasses ; then 
fill the glasses, and set where they will get very cold.

Chocolate Cream. 

Soak one box of gelatine in half a pint of cold water for 
one hour. Put one quart of rich milk into a tin pail, 
and set in a kettle with hot water to boil. Scrape two 
ounces of Baker's chocolate, and mix with eight spoonfuls 
of sugar ; wet this with two spoonfuls of the boiling milk, 
and rub with the bowl of the spoon until . a smooth paste, 
then stir into the boiling milk; now stir in the gelatine, 
and then stir in the yolks of ten well-beaten eggs ; stir 
three minutes, take off and strain ; set in a pan of ice- 
water ; stir for ten minutes, then add two spoonfuls of 
vanilla, and put into blanc-mange moulds ; set away on the 
ice for three hours. Serve with sugar and cream. 

Blanc-mange made with Gelatine. 

Soak a box of gelatine in cold water enough to cover 
it one hour. Put three pints of milk in a tin pail, and 
set in a kettle with hot water ; when the milk comes to a 
boil, stir in the gelatine and two spoonfuls of sugar. Flavor 
with vanilla or lemon, strain into blanc-mange moulds, 
and when cool, set on ice to harden. Make this, if possi- 
ble, the day before it is to be used. Serve with sugar and 
cream. 

Moss Blanc-mange. 

Free from pebbles and seaweed, and wash in several 
waters, one cup of Irish moss (get that that is not pressed) ; 
let it soak in cold water one hour, then tie up in a muslin 
bag, and put in a tin pail with three quarts of new milk. 



DESSERTS. 10 1 

Set the pail in a kettle with hot water, and boil thirty min- 
utes ; after it comes to a boil, stirring occasionally. Press 
the bag between the side of the pail and the spoon, to get 
out all the gluten ; stir in a teaspoonful of salt, half a cup 
of sugar, and flavor with anything you please. Turn into 
blanc-mange moulds, and set away to cool. Serve with 
sugar and cream. This is the best kind of blanc-mange. 

Royal Cream. 

One quart of milk, one third of a box of gelatine, four 
tablespoonfuls of sugar, three eggs, vanilla. Put the gela- 
tine into the milk, and let it stand half an hour. Beat the 
yolks well with the sugar, and stir into the milk. Set 
the kettle into a pan of hot water, and stir until it begins 
to thicken like soft custard. 

Have ready the whites of the eggs beaten to a stiff froth ; 
and the moment you take the kettle from the fire stir them 
in quickly, and turn into the moulds. Set away in a cold 
place to harden. ' 

When you cannot get cream to make Charlotte Russe 
with, this makes a good filUng, if you omit the whites 
and fill your moulds when the cream is perfectly cold 
but not yet hardened. 

Tapioca Cream. 

Four large spoonfuls of tapioca, just cover with cold 
water, and soak over night. Set one quart of milk on the 
fire to warm. Beat the yolks of four eggs and one cup 



1 82 MISS parloa's appledore cook book. 

of sugar together. Stir into the boiling milk, with a pinch 
of salt, and then stir in the tapioca. Beat the whites to 
a stiff froth and stir into the custard, then turn into a 
dish. Flavor with lemon or vanilla. Cook like a soft cus- 
tard before adding the whites. 

Ked Grout. 

Take currant juice, and add an equal quantity of water. 
Put it over the fire, and, when boihng, add four tablespoon- 
fuls of ground rice, which has been mixed with half a cup 
of cold water, to one quart of the liquid. Stir carefully 
until it thickens, then add sugar pnough to give it a good 
flavor. Pour into moulds, -and set away to cool. To be 
eaten with sugar and creani the same as b lane-mange. If 

you have not the ground rice, corn starch will do.

Blanc-mange in Wine Sauce. 

Put one quart of new milk into a basin, and set the basin 
in another with hot water. When the milk conies to a boil, 
stir in four spoonfuls of corn starch, mixed with half a cup 
of milk and one teaspoon of salt ; stir and boil for ten 
minutes, and then turn into a blanc-mange mould. Set 
away to cool. When time to serve, turn into a deep des- 
sert-dish, and pour over it the following sauce : Beat to 
a cream the yolks of two eggs, one heaping cup of sugar, 
and a wine-glass of wine ; then stir in the whites of two eggs, 
beaten to a stiff froth. Serve immediately. Always dip the 
moulds in cold water before filling them with blanc-mange 
or cream.

Wine Jelly. 

Soak one box of gelatine in half a pint of cold water two 
hours ; then pour on a pint and a half of boiling water, and 
stir until the gelatine is all dissolved, but do not set near 
the fire ; now add the juice of two lemons, and sweeten to 
your taste. Wring a piece of thin muslin out of hot water, 
and lay in a fine strainer ; strain the jelly through this (after 
adding one pint of wine to it) . Make the day before using. 

Lemon 'Jelly. 

Make the same as wine jelly, using the juice of eight 
lemons, and one pint more water instead of the wine. This 
is very handsome when you make half of each kind, and cut 
it up in small squares, and fill wine-glasses with it. Put half 
of each kind on a plate. Wine jelly may be colored a bright 
pink by using cochineal ; yellow, by using tincture of saffron, 
and green, by using the juice of spinach ; but I would not 
recommend the use of any coloring. 

Soft Custard. 

Put one quart of new milk into a tin pail, and set the 
pail into a kettle with boiling water, and sweeten with one 
cup of sugar. Beat well the yolks of ten, and the whites of 
four eggs, and mix with them half a cup of cold milk. When 
the milk comes to a boil, strain the eggs into it and stir two 
minutes ; then take off and turn into a pitcher ; set the 
pitcher in ice-water, and stir until cool. Flavor with vanilla. 
Serve in glasses.

Almond Custard. 

Almond custard made in the same way, using the yolks 
of fourteen eggs, and no whites, and flavor with one tea- 
spoonful of bitter almond. 

Suoivball Custard. 

Snowball custards are made the same as soft. Beat the 
whites of six eggs to a stiff froth, and drop into clear boihng 
water ; boil two minutes, and skim out ; let it drain, and 
when the custard is put in glasses, heap this on top. They 
make the dish look very handsome. 

Chocolate Custard. 

Set one quart of milk on to boil as before directed. 
Scrape with a knife one ounce of nice chocolate, and mix 
with one heaping cup of sugar ; wet this with two spoonfuls 
of boiling milk ; work this into a paste with the back of the 
spoon, and stir into the boihng milk, and then stir in six 
well-beaten eggs ; stir three minutes, and then strain. Set 
in cold water and stir occasionally, until cold, then stir in 
two teaspoons of vanilla. Serve in glasses. 

Coffee Custard. 

Tie one cup of ground coffee in a piece of muslin, and

custards are improved by a very tittle salt. 

Steamed Custard. 
Make the same as for baked, and steam until they are 
firm in the centre. 

Baked Custard. 

One quart of milk, five eggs, two thirds of a cup of sugar, 
one teaspoonful of salt. Fill the cups, and grate over them a 
little nutmeg : then place in a deep pan, with warm water. 
Bake in a moderate oven until they are firm in the centre.

glass dish, with the whites of the eggs heaped in the centre. 

Apple Snow. . 

Pare, slice, and quarter ten good-sized tart apples ; steam 
them until tender, and then run them through the cullender,

almonds, and then lay it in a deep glass dish ; pour over 
it a tumbler of sherry, and when the wine has all soaked into 
the cake, fill the dish half full of soft custard.

Apple Float. 

Fill a deep glass dish half full of soft custard, and then 
heap up with apple snow. (Make the custard with the 
yolks of the eggs.) 

Trifle. 

Cut stale cake into slices, and spread preserves between 
them ; lay in a deep glass dish, and heap the dish full of 
whipped cream. 

Wine Whips. 
Into a pint of cream stir half a cup of sugar, half a glass 
of wine, and a lump of ice ; whip to a froth, and fill the 
glasses. 

Fruit "Whips. 

Fill the glasses one third full of any kind of preserved 
berries or jelly, and then fill up with whipped cream. 

Mock Sherbet. 

Fill a six-quart pan with new-fallen snow ; grate the rind 
and squeeze the juice of six lemons into it, and then stir in 
four cups of sugar. Serve immediately. This can also be 
made with currant jelly. 

Cream Cakes. 

One pint of boiling water, one cup of butter, one quart of 
flour, and the yolks of eight and the whites of ten eggs. 
Put the water and butter in a flat sauce-pan, and when it 
boils up, stir in all the flour at once ; keep over the fire, and 
beat well for five minutes ; then when cold, break the eggs

into a bowl, but do not beat ; turn about three at a time on 
the paste, and beat all together half an hour. When light, 
drop on tin sheets. Have half a spoonful in a cake, and 
drop about two inches apart. Bake forty minutes in a 
rather quick oven. When baked, cut open at the sides with 
a small sharp-pointed knife, and fill with a cream made as for 
cream pies. These are very nice glazed with chocolate and 
filled with raspberry or strawberry preserves. 

Sponge Drops. 
Beat to a froth three eggs and one teacup of sugar ; stir 
into this one heaping coffee cup of flour, in which one tea- 
spoonful of cream of tartar and half of saleratus are thor- 
oughly mixed. Flavor with lemon. Butter tin sheets with 
washed butter (lard or salt butter will make them taste bad), 
and drop in teaspoonfuls about three inches apart. Bake 
instantly in a very quick oven. ^Vatch very closely, as they 
will burn easily. Serve with ice cream. 

Kisses. 

Beat to a stiff froth the whites of two eggs, and beat into 
them, very gradually, two teacups of powdered sugar and 
two tablespoonfuls of corn starch. Flavor with lemon. 
Butter tin sheets with washed butter, and then cover with 
letter paper ; drop on this the mixture in teaspoonfuls, and 
about two inches apart. Bake fifteen minutes in a warm 
oven, but be sure that it is not warm enough to brown them. 
After they are taken out let them stand until cold before 
removing them from the paper.

Cocoanut Drops. 

Beat the whites of four eggs with half a pint of powdered 
sugar, stir with these ingredients one grated cocoanut ; bake 
in small cakes in a moderate oven. 

Prepare the pan for them as for kisses. 

Cocoanut Drops. 

Beat to a froth the whites of two eggs, and add gradually 
one small cup of sugar, and one cup of prepared cocoanut, 
and one spoonful of flour. Prepare the tin sheets as for 
kisses, and bake five minutes in a quick oven. 

Cheese Cakes. 
Roll puff paste about a quarter of an inch thick, and cut 
into two equal parts ; on one part grate cheese about half 
an inch thick ; sprinkle with water, and lay the other part 
over it ; roll the pin lightly over this and cut into strips 
about two inches wide and four long ; lay on tin sheets, and 
bake in a quick oven fifteen or twenty minutes. 

Tarts. 

Roll puff paste about an inch and a half thick ; cut with a 
large cutter, and then with a smaller cutter ; cut out the cen- 
tre, leaving the rim about an inch wide. When you have 
cut out all you want, take the pieces which you cut from the 
centre, and roll about one quarter of an inch thick ; cut this 
out with a large cutter, and wet with cold water ; lay the 
rims on these, and bake in a quick oven about twenty-five 
minutes. When cold, fill with any kind of jam or jelly. 



DIRECTIONS FOR FREEZING. 



Set the freezer in the centre of the tub ; be sure that 
everything is in place, or it will not work when you get it 
packed. Have the ice chopped fine, and put in a layer 
about three inches deep, then layers of coarse salt about an 
inch deep, and then the ice, and so on, until the tub is full, 
having the ice last. Use about one third salt and two thirds 
ice. It must be packed very soHd. After the cream has 
been put in, and you have turned it ten minutes, pack again, 
and be sure to get it solid. When the water is troublesome, 
let off some, but not all. Stop the hole immediately, and 
pack to fill the space that was occupied by the water, as the 
mixture will not freeze until all air is excluded. Beat one 
way until you can no longer turn the beater. Now carefully 
brush the ice and salt from the cover and take out the 
beater ; cover again and put a cork in the cover. Now 
pack again with ice and salt. Cover the whole with a piece 
of old carpet, and let it stand a few hours. Or if you wish 
to put it in moulds, fill them as soon as you take out the 
beater ; pack them down well, or they will not look smooth 
when taken out. If you use an old-fashioned freezer, you 
must have a long iron spoon to beat it with, and a long

knife to cut it from the sides with. Turn the freezer with 
the hands ; take off the cover every fifteen minutes. Scrape 
the cream from the sides, and then beat, as you would cake, 
for ten minutes. When hard, Hght, and smooth, cover as 
before directed, or put in moulds. Lay the moulds in ice 
and salt for three hours, and when ready to dish, dip them 
in warm water for an instant. Wipe and turn the mould on 
an ice-cream dish ; remove very gently. Serve immedi- 
ately. 

Ice Cream made with Cream. 
Take four quarts of cream and sweeten with one heaping 
quart of sugar. Flavor with anything you please, but very 
strong. 

Lemon Ice Cream. 

Put two quarts of rich milk into a tin pail, and set into 
a kettle with hot water ; when this comes to a boil, stir in 
four spoonfuls of com starch wet with one cup of milk. 
Cook this twenty minutes, and then add the yolks of twelve 
eggs, well beaten, stir a few minutes, and then take off and 
cool ; before cooling, stir in one heaping quart of sugar. 
When ice-cold, add two quarts of cream, or fich milk will 
answer, and two tablespoonfuls of lemon extract ; then freeze. 

Vanilla, pineapple, and all other kinds of cream may be 
made in the same way, but use eight whites and yolks in- 
stead of twelve yolks of eggs. For strawberry and raspberry 
cream, allow the juice of one quart of berries to one gallon- 
of cream. Some persons object to corn starch, but it makes 
a very much smoother and handsomer cream than when it

is all made of eggs. Where all eggs are used, make the 
same as soft custard, and allow one quart of cream or milk 
to one quart of custard. 

Chocolate Ice Cream. 

Made the same as the others, with the addition of one 
cake of chocolate, and one pint more of sugar. Prepare the 
chocolate as for chocolate custard. 

Coffee Ice Cream. 

Made the same as chocolate, but using coffee instead of 
chocolate. Tie one pint of ground coffee in a piece of 
muslin, and boil in the milk half an hour before ; then take 
it out, and make as before directed. 

Lemon Sherbet. 

One gallon of ice-water, the juice of twenty lemons, and 
three pints of sugar ; strain into the freezer, and freeze as 
you would cream. 

Currant, strawberry, raspberry, and orange sherbets may 
be made in the same manner. 

To flavor ice creams, use the extract. 

Roman Pimch. 

Two quarts of cold water, one of Madeira wine, half a 
pint of brandy, the juice of six lemons, and two quarts of 
sugar. This is very hard to freeze. In winter use snow 
instead of ice. 




In making preserves, use a porcelain kettle which should 
be used for nothing else. Have also a large wooden spoon, 
which keep expressly for this use. Be very careful not to 
let the sirup burn or boil over, and always skim carefully. 
Look at your preserves once a month at least, and if they 
are beginning to ferment, scald and skim. If they mould 
on top that will not injure them, but will keep the air from 
them and thus protect them. Be very careful when remov- 
ing it not to get any of it in the sirup. Preserves should be 
kept in a cool, dry place. Always seal them while hot, as 
by this means you do not seal air in ; but if they are allowed 
to grow cold before seahng they will not keep so well. Heat 
the jars before putting the preserves in, by setting them in a 
pan of warm water, and let it heat gradually until it comes 
192 . 



PRESERVES. 193 

to a boiling point. Cut note-paper in round pieces about 
two inches deeper than the mouth of the jar ; make a paste 
with the white of an egg and a little flour ; wet the edges 
with it and paste on. 

Brandied Peaches. 

Weigh your peaches, then throw them a few at a time 
into boiling lye. As soon as the skin begins to curl up, 
drain them and rub the skin smoothly off with a cloth, then 
throw them into cold water. After you have finished put 
them over the fire in boiling water, but do not let them 
boil. When they are soft enough to make a dent in them, 
take them out to cool. Cover them with white brandy, and 
let them stand twenty-four hours, then make a sirup of a 
pound of sugar to a pound of peaches, and mix them. 
Cover them close, and in a few days they will be ready for use. 

Sour-Orange Preserve. 

Grate off the rind and cut the orange into two parts ; take 
out all the pulp. Weigh them and place in a large stone 
pot and cover with a brine made from three gallons of 
water and one quart of salt. Let them stand in this twenty- 
four hours and then drain off the brine. Cover again with a 
brine made with the same amount of water and half as 
much salt as in the first. Let them stand twenty-four hours 
again. Now drain igain, and cover with clear cold water, 
and let them stand in this twenty-four hours. Drain again 
and put into a boiler and cover with cold water ; let them 
come to a boil and then boil fifteen minutes ; take them out 



194 MISS PARLOA S APPLEDORE COOK BOOK. 

and drain. Make a sirup of sugar (pound for pound), and 

water enough to dissolve. When the sirup is clear, drop in 

the oranges and boil until they are clear and tender, which 

will be in about four hours of slow boiling. Great care 

must be taken that they do not scorch. They must be 

stirred every ten or fifteen minutes. The sugar may be 

either white or brown. The orange used is not the 

common market orange, but the wild, sour orange found in 

Florida. 

Preserved Peaches. 

Pare and cut in two peaches that have not begun to mel- 
low, but they must be ripe. Take out the stones and then 
put the fruit in a large earthen dish, cover with coffee 
crushed sugar. For every pound of fruit allow one pound 
of sugar. Let this stand over night, and in the morning turn 
the sirup into the preserving kettle, and clarify ; then put in 
the peaches and cook until tender, which will be in about 
thirty minutes. Lay them in a stone pot, and pour the boil- 
ing sirup over them. When cool, put in small jars, and 
paste note-paper over the top. Keep in a cool, dry place. 

Preserved Pears. 

Pare, but do not cut them up. Weigh them, and then 
boil until tender in just water enough to cover them. When 
tender, take them out and make a sirup of the water in 
which they were boiled, and the sugar ; allow one pint of 
water and one pound of sugar to every pound of fruit. Boil 
this one hour, and then put in the pears and one sliced 
lemon to every pound ; boil gently for forty minutes, then 



PRESERVES. 195 

take up, and when cool put in jars. Boil the sirup until 
thick, and if the jars are stone, pour over the pears while hot. 

Crab Apple Preserves. 

Wash the apples and drain; leave the stems on them. 
Make a sirup with the same weight of sugar that you have 
apples, and half a pint of water to a pound of sugar ; simmer 
the apples in this forty-five minutes, and then take out and 
lay in a stone jar. Let the sirup simmer one hour longer, 
and turn boiling on the apples. Seal while hot, with note- 
paper. 

Preserved Pineapple. 

Pare and cut the pineapple in slices about an inch thick. 
Cover with an equal weight of sugar, and let it stand over 
night. In the morning proceed as with peach preserves. 



Preserved Citron Melon. 

Pare and cut the melon into handsome pieces about an inch 
thick. Boil gently until tender, in just water enough to cover 
it ; as soon as it is tender, take out and lay in a platter, and 
put more on to boil. Do this until all is cooked. Now make 
a sirup of the weight of the melon in sugar (which weigh be- 
fore cooking) and the water in which it was boiled. Let this 
boil one hour ; then put in the melon, and one lemon sliced to 
each pound of melon ; a few cloves. Simmer fifty minutes, 
then take up and boil the sirup half an hour longer, then pour 
over the melon while hot. 



igS MISS parloa's appledore cook book. 

Preserved Apples. 

Pare and quarter good tart apples ; preserve them the 
same as melon, omitting the cloves. They are nice to use 
late in the spring and early in the summer for green apple 
pies j but as a preserve, they are too insipid. 

Preserved Plums. 

Take the weight of the plums in sugar, and to two pounds 
of sugar allow half a pint of water. Make a sirup of this, 
and when clear, boil the plums in it for forty-five minutes. 
Do not put many in it at a time. When they are all done, 
let the sirup boil an hour, and pour over them while hot. Seal 
with note-paper. This rule will answer for all kinds of plums. 

Preserved Cherries. 

Cherries are preserved the same as plums. 

Preserved Quinces. 

Pare, quarter, and cut out the cores. Save the parings 
and cores for jelly. Preserve the same as pears, omitting 
the lemon. 

Raspberry Jam. 

Take equal weights of raspberries and sugar ; put the ber- 
ries in a dish and cover with the sugar, and let them stand 
over night. In the morning put in the kettle and boil two 
hours (skimming carefully), and put up in jars; seal with 
note-paper. Strawberries and blackberries are cooked in 
the same manner. 



PRESERVES. 197 

Barberries Preserved with Pears. 

Weigh the barberries, and make a sirup of an equal weight 
of sugar, allowing half a pint of water to a pound of sugar. 
When the sirup is clear, put in the barberries (which must 
be free from stems), and boil fifty minutes. When the bar- 
berries are all cooked, put as many pears, pared and quar- 
tered, as you have barberries into the sirup and boil until 
tender ; then take up and put with the barberries. Boil the 
sirup thirty minutes, and then pour boiling over the fruit. 

Barberries Preserved in Molasses. 

One peck of barberries, six quarts of molasses. Pick the 
barberries free from stems and imperfect ones. Let the 
molasses come to a boil, then put in the barberries, and boil 
about fifty minutes. They will be clear and full when done. 
Skim them out and put in the jars. Save two quarts of the 
sirup for drinks, and turn the remainder over the barberries. 
Be very careful that the molasses shall not burn. Sweet 
apples may be cooked with these in the same manner that 
pears are cooked with those done in sugar. 

Grape Marmalade. 

Put the grapes in a stone pot, and set the pot into a kettle 
with cold water; set this on the fire and boil until the grapes 
will mash easily ; stir them often, and jam with the bowl of 
the spoon. Take them up and strain through a sieve. To 
a quart of the pulp allow a pint of sugar, and boil forty 
minutes. 



IQo MISS PARLOA S APPLEDORE COOK BOOK. 

Currant Jelly. 

To be nice the currants must be just ripe, and neither 
more nor less. Put them, stems and all, into a stone pot, 
and cover to keep the steam in. Set the pot into a kettle 
with cold water, and place on the fire. Boil until they will 
all jam easily. Jam them with the bowl of the spoon. Lay 
a piece of thin muslin in a sieve, and turn the currants into 
it ; squeeze the juice through. If you are careful to have it 
clear now, you will not have to strain it after the sugar is 
added. To a pint of juice add a pint of sugar, and boil fifty 
minutes. Take it off the fire, and let it stand until so cool 
that it will not break the glasses, but no longer, and then fill 
the glasses ; let them stand in the sun a few days, and then 
seal with note-paper. 

Currant Shrub. 

Make the same as jelly, but boil only ten minutes. When 
cool, bottle. Raspberry, strawberry, and blackberry shrubs 
made in the same way. 

Apple Jelly. 

Make the same as quince, with the addition of a stick of 
cinnamon and one lemon to a quart of juice, after the sugar 
is added. It will take longer to cook than quince. 

Quince Jelly. 

Put the cores and parings in the preserving kettle, and 
cover with cold water. Boil gently two hours ; then squeeze 
through a thick piece of cloth, and to a pint of juice allow a 



PRESERVES. 199 

pint of sugar. Boil until it will jelly when a little is put in a 
saucer, then treat as currant jelly. Where water is put with 
fruit you cannot limit the time of boiling. 

To Can Berries. 

Put the berries in a nice tin pan, and set over a boiler of 
boiling water, and to a gallon of berries allow one cup of 
boiling water ; heat the berries to a boiling point. (Cover 
them and stir occasionally, and they will heat much sooner.) 
Heat self-sealing jars by putting them in a pan of cold 
water. Set on the stove, and let the water boil ; now fill the 
jars to the top, and put on the covers, and set up ; as the 
glass is expanded by the heat, they cannot be set tight now ; 
but after they become cool get a man to set them up very 
tight. Set away in a cool, dry place. Always use the fruit 
as soon as opened. If these directions are followed, you 
may put up any kind of fruit, and keep it nice for years. 




Pickled Cucumbers. 

Pick the cucumbers before they get very large ; lay them 
in a tub, and cover with a boiling brine of one gill of salt to 
one gallon of water ; let this stand until cold, and then turn 
the brine back into the kettle and boil again, and pour over 
the cucumbers ; do this five times, and then turn off and 
cover with boihng alum water (allow one heaping spoonful 
of alum to one gallon of water) . When cold, turn off, and 
boil again, and turn on the cucumbers a second time. When 
this is cold turn off, and drain the cucumbers. Now put on 
a few quarts of good cider vinegar in a porcelain kettle, and 
when it boils, drop a few cucumbers in at a time, and let 
them boil about eight minutes ; then skim out and drain. 
Do this until they are all scalded. Lay them in a stone pot 



PICKLES. 20I 

and cover with good cider vinegar. You may use bell pep- 
pers and spice if you choose. You cannot fail to have good 
pickles if you follow this rule. 

Tomato Pickles. 

Cut green tomatoes into slices about an inch thick, and 
sprinkle with salt (allow half a cup of salt to a peck of toma- 
toes), and let them stand over night. In the morning turn 
off all the liquor and scald them in boiling vinegar ; then lay 
them in the stone pots and sprinkle between them half a 
spoonful of white mustard seed and a handful of whole 
cloves. Cover with cold vinegar. 

Tomato Pickles, No. 2. 

Cut a peck of green tomatoes in slices, and lay in a stone 
jar ; cover with one pint of molasses. Skim when it fer- 
ments, and your pickles are made. This is good. 

Piccalilli. 

Slice one peck of tomatoes and sprinkle with one handful 
of salt ; let them stand over night, and in the morning turn 
off the liquor. Chop the tomatoes, one cabbage-head, seven 
onions, and four green peppers. Mix with this half a pint 
of whole mustard, half a teacup of sugar, half a teacupful of 
horseradish, and vinegar enough to cover the whole. Stew 
until soft. 

Tomato Catsup. 

Cut up one gallon of ripe tomatoes, and put on in a por- 
celain kettle and boil. Prepare half a pint of sugar, half a 



202 MISS PARLOA S APPLEDORE COOK BOOK. 

pint of Strong cider vinegar, or more if not strong, one 
tablespoonful of salt, one teaspoonful of cloves, one of all- 
spice, one quarter of a teaspoonful of cayenne pepper. 
Boil the tomatoes half an hour and then run them through 
a sieve. Now put them on with the spice, vinegar, and 
sugar, and boil until there is about two quarts and a pint. 
Cool and bottle. 

Spiced Currants. 

Five pounds of currants, four pounds of sugar, one pint 
of vinegar, two tablespoonfuls of cloves, two of cinnamon. 
Stew half an hour. To eat with roast meat. 

Pickled Blueberries. 

Nearly fill a jar with ripe berries, and then fill up with 
good molasses, cover, and set away, and in a few weeks they 
will be ready for use. 

ChUi Sauce. 

Take nine large or eighteen small tomatoes, scald, peel, 
and chop, with two peppers and one large onion. Add one 
tablespoonful of salt, two of sugar, one teaspoonful each of 
ginger, cloves, allspice, cinnamon, one nutmeg, and two 
small cups of vinegar. Stew half an hour ; bottle while hot. 

To Pickle Oysters. 

Two hundred large oysters, one half pint of vinegar, one 
half pint of white wine, four spoonfuls of salt, six spoonfuls 
of whole black pepper, and a little mace. Strain the liquor, 



PICKLES. 203 

and add the above-named ingredients, then put on the fire 
and boil up, and pour while boiling hot over the oysters, and 
let them stand ten minutes ; then pour the liquor ofif them 
and let both oysters and liquor get cold ; then put the 
oysters in a jar with the liquor, and cover tight. They will 
keep some time. 




Drawn Butter. 

Beat one cup of butter and two spoonfuls of flour to a 
cream, and pour over this one pint of boiling water. Set on 
the fire and let it come to a boil, but do not boil. Serve 
immediately. 

Egg Sauce.

fuls of flour ; let this come to a boil, and serve. 
204 



SAUCES. 205 

Celery Sauce. 

Chop fine two heads of celery, and boil one hour ; at the 
end of that time, have about a pint and a half of water with 
it, and stir in two spoonfuls of flour wet with cold water.

out the onion and stir in two spoonfuls of butter, and salt 
and pepper. Boil up once, and serve. 

Coddled Apples. 

Pare and core with an apple-corer, cook the same as for 
apple-sauce ; but allow one pint of sugar to one quart of water. 

Cranberry Sauce. 

Pick and wash the cranberries, and put in the preserving 
kettle with half a pint of water to one quart of berries ; now 
put the sugar on top of the berries, allowing a pint of sugar 



2o6 MISS parloa's appledore cook book. 

to a quart of berries. Set on the fire and stew about half 
an hour. Stir often to prevent burning. They will not need 
straining, and will preserve their rich color cooked in this 
way. Never cook cranberries before putting in the sugar. 
Less sugar may be used if you do not wish them very rich. 

Apple Sauce. 

Pare, quarter, and core nice tart apples. Make a sirup 
of two quarts of water and one cup of sugar ; simmer the 
apples in this until tender, but do not break them ; then lay 
in an earthen dish ; do this until they are all cooked (do 
not put many in the sirup at a time), and then let the sirup 
get cool, and turn on the apples. 

Baked Pears. 

Put the pears in a deep earthen dish or a baking-pan, and 
to a dozen good-sized pears allow half a cup of sugar and 
a pint and a half of water. Bake in a moderate oven two 
hours and a half or three. They will not keep many days 
cooked in this manner, but they are nice. Sweet apples are 
cooked in the same manner. 

Stewed Prunes. 

> 

Wash the prunes in warm water and rub them well 
between the hands. Put them in a kettle that you can 
cover tight, with two quarts of water to one of prunes. 
Stew them gently two hours. These will not keep more 
than two days in warm weather, but cooked in this way 
they do not require any sugar, and are very nice. 



SAUCES. 207 

Dried Apple Sauce. 

Pick and wash the apples carefully, then place in a pre- 
serving kettle. For one pint of dried apple cut the thin yellow 
skin off a lemon, and then pare and cut up the inside. Put 
the yellow skin (be careful not to get any of the white) and 
the inside into the kettle with the apple, and three pints of 
cold water. Cover tight, and simmer three hours, then put 
in one pint of sugar, but do not stir the apple, and simmer 
two hours longer. Never stir dried apple sauce. 

Vinaigrette Sauce.

Tea. 

Scald the teapot and put in the tea, allowing one tea- 
spoonful to each person ; pour over this half a cup of boiling 
water (soft water is the best) , and steep in a hot place, but 
1 not where it will boil, one minute ; then turn in all the boil- 
ing water you wish, and serve. 



Coffee. 

Put one cup of ground coffee and one pint of cold water 
into the coffee-pot ; set the pot on the fire, and boil ten min- 
utes after it comes to a boil ; then turn in a pint of boiUng 
water and a piece of salt fish skin about an inch square. 
Boil ten minutes longer, then turn in half a cup of cold water

and set one side one minute ; turn into another pot and send 
to the table. Always serve boiled milk with coffee. 

Cocoa Shells. 

Put one quart of cold water and half a cup of shells into 
the pot, and boil gently four or five hours ; add boiling water 
occasionally. About twenty minutes before serving, add one 
pint of new milk and boiling water enough to make three 
pints in all ; let this boil a few minutes, strain and serve. 

Cbocolate. 

With four spoonfuls of grated chocolate mix one of sugar, 
and wet with one of boiling water. Rub this smooth with 
the bowl of the spoon, and then stir into one pint of boiling 
water ; let this boil up once, and then add one pint of good 
milk ; let this boil up once, and serve. 

Breakfast Cocoa. 

Prepared cocoa is made the same as chocolate, omitting 
the sugar. All milk may be used if preferred. Never boil 
chocolate or prepared cocoa more than one minute. Boil- 
ing makes it oily. The quicker it is used after making the 
better. 

To Make Mead. 

One pint and a half of brown sugar, half a pint of molasses. 
Pour this on three pints of boiling water. Let this stand 
until blood-warm, then add two ounces of tartaric acid and 
one of essence of sassafras. When cold, bottle. 



210 MISS PARLOA S APPLEDORE COOK BOOK. 

To Use Mead. 

Put one tablespoonful of the mead in the bottom of a 
glass, then fill two thirds full of cold water, then stir in one 
fourth of a teaspoonful of soda, and drink while foaming. 



EGGS. 



Boiled Eggs. 

Pitt the eggs in a tin basin and pour boiling water over 
them ; let them stand on a part of the stove where they will 
keep hot, but not boil, for ten minutes, or boil in boiling 
water three minutes and a half. The first method is the 
best. This is for rare-done eggs. 

Pried Eggs.^ 

Have boiling lard in the frying-pan ; break the eggs into 
a saucer one at a time, and slide them gently into the pan ; 
now, with a large spoon, dip the boiling lard and pour it over 
the eggs ; do this until they are set, then dish. 

Dropped Eggs. 

Turn a quart of boiHng water into a basin with one spoon- 
ful of salt. Break the eggs, one at a time, into a saucer ; 
dip one side of the saucer into the water and let the eggs 
slide gently into it. Boil gently until set, which will be in 
about two minutes, and serve on toast. 



212 MISS PARLOA S APPLEDORE COOK BOOK. 

Poached Eggs. 

Break and beat up two eggs, and stir into them two table- 
spoonfuls of milk and half a teaspoonful of salt ; put them 
into a basin, with half a spoonful of butter, and set over the 
fire. Stir until it thickens, and then serve. 

Scrambled Eggs. 

Beat together four eggs, and then turn into a pan with 
one spoonful of melted butter. Stir quickly over a hot fire 
one minute, and serve. 

Omelets. 

Beat lightly two eggs, and stir in one spoonful of milk and 
a pinch of salt. Heat the omelet pan hot, and then put in 
a little bit of butter, and when melted turn in the beaten 
eggs ; set on the fire,, shake the pan, cook until a light brown ; 
then fold the omelet and serve on a hot dish. Ham, mush- 
room, lobster, chicken, and all kinds of omelets are made 
by chopping up the meat, and laying it between the folds 
before dishing. 



CANDIES. 



Molasses Candy. 

Two cups of molasses, one of white sugar, one tablespoon- 
ful of vinegar, a small piece of butter. Boil from twenty 
minutes to half an hour. Try it by dropping a little into 
cold water ; if it hardens, it is ready to cool. Pour into a 
flat, buttered dish, and, when cool, work it with the hands. 

Molasses Candy, No. 2. 

Two cups of molasses, one of sugar, butter the size of an 
egg, one tablespoonful of checkerberry. Pull when done. 

Molasses Candy, No. 3. 
Two cups of sugar, one of molasses, one half of butter, 
one fourth of vinegar, vanilla, and peanuts. Boil until it will 
candy, then stir in vanilla and peanuts, and pour into a paa 
Score the same as caramel. 

Chocolate Candy. 

One cup of molasses, two of sugar, one of milk, one half 
of chocolate, a piece of butter half the size of an egg. 

Boil the milk and molasses together, scrape the chocolate

214 MISS PARLOA S APPLEDORE COOK BOOK. 

fine, and mix with just enough of the boiling milk and mo- 
lasses to moisten ; rub it perfectly smooth then, with the 
sugar, stir into the boiling liquid, add the butter, and boil 
twenty minutes. Try as molasses candy ; and, if it hardens, 
pour into a buttered dish. Cut the same as nut candy. 

Vinegar Candy. 

One cup of vinegar, two of white sugar. Boil until it will 
break brittle when dropped in cold water. Pour into a 
buttered dish, and cut before it gets hard. 

This is nice with nuts for a change. Any kind will answer. 

Vinegar Cand^. 

Two cups of molasses, two tablespoonfuls of sugar, two of 
vinegar. 

Peanut Candy. 

Prepare the same as the above : let boil ten minutes 
longer ; and, just before taking off the fire, add a pint of 
nuts, which have been shelled and broken. 

Pour into the dish ; and, before it becomes perfectly cold, 
cut into pieces. 

Chocolate Caramel. 

Three pounds brown sugar, coarse, one half pound of 
butter, one half pound of chocolate scraped fine, one pint 
cream or milk. Melt all these together with care, and boil 
twenty minutes or half an hour, stirring all the time. Just 
before taking it off the fire, pour in vanilla to flavor, and stir 



CANDIES. 2 1 5 

in half or a whole cup of granulated sugar. Pour it in a pan, 
and, when half cool, score it. It should be half an inch 
thick, and be cut up into pieces about an inch square. 

Chocolate Creams. 

Two cups of powdered sugar, nearly a cup of water. 
Boil about five minutes, then beat until it turns to a cream, 
after which make into drops, and dip them into the melted 
chocolate. Melt three fourths of a cake of chocolate by 
scraping into a bowl, and then placing the bowl either over 
the teakettle or into a pan of hot water. 



DISHES FOR THE SICK. 



Beef Tea. 

Cut half a pound of lean beef into very small pieces : 
do not have a grain of fat on it, and put into a bottle that 
has a large opening (an olive or horseradish bottle will be 
nice) ; put in half a cup of cold water, and cork tight ; set 
this in a basin of cold water, and place on the fire where it 
will come to a boiling point, but not boil; keep it at this 
temperature for two hours, then strain, and season with salt. 

Another Beef Tea. 

Cut a pound of lean beef (the round is the best) into 
dice. Put into a sauce-pan, with a teaspoonful of salt, 
one of flour, one fourth of pepper. Pour on this a large 
pint of cold water. Let it stand an hour or two, then put 
on the fire ; bring slowly to a boil, and boil slowly an hour. 
If it has boiled away too much, add a little hot water ; but 
this rather hurts it. Skim off carefully every particle of fat. 
This tea is more palatable than the other, and can be taken 
by those not extremely sick. 
216 



DISHES FOR THE SICK. 21/ 

Chicken Broth. 

Put the bones and about one pound of the lean meat of 
chicken into a sauce-pan with three pints of water. When 
it comes to a boil, skim well. Simmer three hours, and 
strain and salt. If the patient can bear it, a little rice or 
tapioca boiled with it is an improvement. 

Oatmeal Gruel. 

Into one quart of boiling water sprinkle two tablespoon- 
fills of oatmeal; let this boil forty minutes ; season with salt, 
strain, and serve. If sugar, milk, or cream is wished, it may 
be added. 

Indian Meal Gruel. 

One quart of boiling water ; stir into this one spoonful of 
flour and two of Indian meal, mixed with a little cold water. 
Boil thirty minutes. Season with salt, and strain. Use sugar 
and cream if you choose. If flour is not liked, xise another 
spoonful of meal instead. 

Plum Porridge. 

Into one quart of boiling milk stir two spoonfuls of flour 
mixed with cold milk ; put in a handful of raisins and a lit- 
tle grated nutmeg. Boil twenty minutes. Season with salt, 
and strain. 

Com Tea. 

Brown and pound in a mortar one cup of sweet dry corn ; 
pour on this two cups of boiling water, and steep fifteen 
minutes. This is very light and nutritious, and can be taken 
where the patient is very weak. 



2i8 MISS parloa's appledore cook book. 

Cream Toast. 

Heat half a cup of cream, and season with salt. Toast 
two slices of bread a light brown, and pour the cream over 
it. Serve immediately. 

Wine WTiey. 

Let one cup of new milk come to a boil, and then stir in 
half a wine-glass of cherry wine. Boil a moment and strain. 

Vinegar Whey. 
Boil one cup of milk, and stir in one spoonful of vinegar ; 
if this does not make it whey, stir in a Kttle more ; when it 
curdles, strain. 

Sour Milk Whey. 
To one cup of boiling sweet milk, add one cup of sour 
milk, and strain. 

A Good Drink for the Lungs. 

Wash clean a few pieces of Irish moss ; put it in a pitcher, 
and pour over it two cups of boiling water. Set where it 
will keep at the boiling point, but not boil, for two hours. 
Strain, and squeeze into it the juice of one lemon. Sweeten 
to taste. If the patient cannot take lemon, flavor with wine, 
vanilla, or nutmeg. 

Another Drink. 

Beat lightly one egg and one spoonful of sugar. Stir into 
this one cup of new milk, half a wine-glass of wine, and a lit- 
tle nutmeg. This is nice without the wine. 



DISHES FOR THE SICK. 219 

Another Drink. 

Upon one teaspoonful of slippery elm pour one cup of 
boiling water, strain and season as Irish moss. 

Lemonade. 

The juice of one lemon and one spoonful of sugar. Pour 
on this one cup of boiUng water, and set away to cool. 

Sack Posset. 

Pound one Boston cracker, or one soda biscuit. Put it in 
a pint of cold milk; set on the fire, and simmer fifteen 
minutes. Beat together one egg, one wine-glass of wine, a 
little sugar, salt, and nutmeg. Turn this into the simmering 
milk, stirring constantly ; boil up once, and take from the 
fire immediately. 



REMARKS ON DIGESTION. 



In the stomach is produced a liquid secretion called the 
gastric juice. This does not act upon starch or fat of any 
kind. The only thing it dissolves is the albuminous matter. 
Now, when this albuminous matter is not saturated with 
fat, the gastric juice acts upon it readily ; but, as in the 
case of pastry, doughnuts, fried meats, etc., where the 
whole mass is saturated with a fatty substance, it takes a 
long time before the gastric juice can get at the albuminous 
matter to act upon it ; hence the distress by the overwork- 
ing of the stomach ; and, if this kind of food is partaken of 
frequently, the stomach force will be weakened, and refuse 
to do its work. This will disarrange every other member 
of the digestive organs ; and, in a short time, you have a 
first-class dyspeptic. All food, therefore, should be as light, 
porous, and free from fat as possible. 

When fat is used, it should be in such a manner that 
it will separate readily from the other substances on enter- 
ing the stomach. Alcohol retards digestion, and renders it 
incomplete, by coagulating the gastric juice. Food, when 
taken into the stomach either very hot or very cold, does 

220 



REMARKS ON DIGESTION. 221 

not digest readily. Food taken when the body or mind is 
very tired does not digest readily. Digestion goes on very 
slowly during sleep ; but it is more complete, and repairs the 
waste of the body more thoroughly than the rapid digestion 
of the waking hours. Children digest food more rapidly than 
adults, and should therefore be given a light lunch, when more 
than four hours intervene between the regular meals. 

It is a great mistake to think that hght breakfasts are 
better than substantial ones. The breakfast supplies the 
fuel for the great waste which goes on during the busiest 
part of the day, and therefore should be of a simple, nutri- 
tious character, and an abundant supply of it. Another 
mistake made by many persons is the taking of a number 
of hours of exercise before breakfast. 

The stomach, while empty, is in a condition to receive 
disease. In a high, dry atmosphere, there is less danger 
from this habit ; but in a country which is at all malarious, 
it is one of the most dangerous things which can be 
done. 

Regularity as to the time of eating is also one of the 
necessary things to be observed, that the digestion may be 
perfect. Pastry should be used very sparingly, puddings, 
fruit, and light desserts taking the place of pies. 

The preparation of food should be made more a matter 
of conscience, with the housekeeper and cook, than it is at 
present. In planning the preparation of a dish, the ques- 
tion should not be. Is it convenient, and will it please? 
but. Will it be healthful, mentally, morally, and physically? 
for the food we eat affects all three natures. 



222 MISS PARLOA S APPLEDORE COOK BOOK. 

Then food, to do its highest and best work, must be of 
the best quahty, prepared carefully (but always to retain its 
simplest form), partaken of regularly in a cheerful room and 
in cheerful company. 



GENERAL REMARKS. 



ALWAi's measure flour after it has been sifted, unless told 
to measure before. Always sift Indian and rye meal, and 
never sift Graham or oat meal. Always set milk into boil- 
ing water to boil, as it boils quicker in this way, and there 
will be no danger of burning. Save all the fat from soups, 
boiled and roast meats. The fat from beef, pork, and poul- 
try, keep for shortening or frying ; and from ham, mutton, 
and soups, in which vegetables were boiled, for the soap 
grease. To clarify drippings, boil them a few minutes, and 
then cut in a raw potato, and let it cook for five minutes ; 
then drop in a pinch of saleratus, and strain. If all the 
drippings are taken care of, it will be a great saving in a 
family. In many of the rules given here it has been very 
difficult to say just how much spice to use, as there is such 
a difference in tastes, so that each one must use her own 
judgment ; but be careful that one spice predominates. 
Always use twice as much cinnamon and nutmeg as you do 
clove. In making frosting, pudding sauce, and all kinds of 
delicate cake, use the powdered sugar, if possible. For 
rich cake, the coffee crushed, powdered and sifted, is the 
best. For dark cake, the brown sugar will be found the 

223 



224 MISS PARLOA S APPLEDORE COOK BOOK. 

nicest. It makes it richer. Save all the pieces of bread 
for dressing, puddings, and griddle cakes. Tin is not very 
good to mix cake in, and earthen dishes are always being 
broken. The stone china wash bowls are very good for this 
purpose. You can often find odd ones at the crockery stores, 
and they will last a lifetime for this purpose. In baking 
and frying cook everything brown. Bread and pastry are 
more healthful overdone than underdone. 

One even quart of sifted flour is one pound, one pint of 
granulated sugar is one pound, two good- sized cups of but- 
ter are one pound. Do not buy large quantities of Indian 
and rye meal at a time, as they sour quickly. Keep all kinds 
of meal, flour, and meats in a cool, dry place. Keep tea, 
coffee, and extracts from the air. Never set anything into 
the ice-chest while warm, as it will heat the chest and 
absorb an unpleasant flavor from the chest. This is true of 
the cellar also. Keep a note-book for tried receipts, and 
for any changes which you wish to make in the receipts 
which you are constantly using. By thought and observa- 
tion one can learn something new in regard to cooking every 
day, and at the time it will seem so important that you can- 
not forget it ; but you will if you do not have it written. 



MEDICINAL. 



Unfailing Cure for Constipation. 

Three teacupfuls of coarse, clean wheat-bran, three of 
sifted flour, one heaping teaspoonful of cream of tartar, one 
half of soda, one of salt, seven of sweet butter. Mix with 
cold milk, and roll into thin biscuit ; and bake thoroughly 
in a moderately hot oven. They should be from one fourth 
to one third of an inch thick, and be cut with a small biscuit- 
cutter. 

Great care must be taken that they do not burn, and at 
the same time that they get thoroughly baked. They will 
keep a long time if kept in a tight tin box ; and they should 
be eaten at each meal. 

Cure No. 2. 

A little while before retiring, mix a tablespoonful of flax- 
seed in cold water enough to make it pour readily, and, on 
going to bed, drink this. It is not nauseating at all, and 
will act on the bowels without deranging them as drugs 
always do. 

Drinking a glass of cold water at night and in the morning 
helps many persons. EaJng fruit is also good. Persons 

225 



226 MISS parloa's appledore cook book. 

having this trouble should eat vegetables, meats, hominy, 
oatmeal, and coarse breads. They should also take a great 
deal of exercise. 

Diarrhoea. 

Brown rice as you would the coffee bean, and then either 
grind or mash in the mortar ; take half a cup of the ground 
rice, and pour about a quart of boiling water over it and let 
stand about ten or fifteen minutes ; then strain and sweeten 
with loaf sugar and season with boiled milk. Drink of this 
freely. This is particularly nice for children. 

Cure No. 2. — Flour Gruel. 

Let one quart of fresh milk come to a boil, and then stir 
in one tablespoonful of flour, which has been mixed with 
milk enough to make a smooth paste ; boil this mixture 
thirty minutes, being careful not to let it bum. Season with 
salt, and strain. The patient should be kept warm and 
quiet. 

Inflammation of the BoTvels. 

Cover the bowels with thin slices of fresh beef, and, when 
they begin to grow dark, remove them and put on more 
fresh beef; continue this until the inflammation is all drawn 
out. 

Burns. 

Wet saleratus and spread on a cloth ; bind this around the 
burnt part, and, in few hours, it will be nearly well, unless 
the burn is very deep, in which case the saleratus should be 



MEDICINAL. 227 

removed ; and after being removed the burn should be 
covered with a piece of old linen on which has been rubbed 
a little mutton tallow or sweet oil. 

Neuralgia. 

One of the causes of neuralgia is constipation ; and there- 
fore one of the first things to do is to get the bowels in a 
healthy condition. 

A poultice made from the common white bean is a great 
relief Boil the beans in water enough to make a thick 
paste ; mash them, and spread the paste thickly on a cloth ; 
then cover the paste with a thin piece of muslin, and bind 
on the painful parts. The bean poultice will retain heat 
longer than one made of anything else ; and, as heat and 
moisture open the pores, it thus relieves the pain. Hot 
oatmeal gruel heats the system quickly and thoroughly, for 
which reason it should be taken freely in all cases of colds, 
neuralgia, and rheumatism. 

G-rO'WJng-in Nails. 

When the nails are trimmed cut a deep place in the centre 
of any that have a tendency to grow into the flesh. The 
inclination of the parts of the nail to grow together will keep 
it out of the flesh. 

Nosebleed. 
Roll a piece of soft paper quite hard, and pack hard 
between the upper lip and gum, and in a few minutes the 
bleeding will stop. 



228 MISS parloa's appledore cook book. 

Cure for Hoarseness. 

Bake a lemon or sour orange for twenty minutes in a 
moderate oven ; then open it at one end, and dig out the 
inside, which sweeten with sugar or molasses, and eat. This 
will cure hoarseness and remove pressure from the lungs. 

Under the heading of " Medicinal " I do not give any 
rules that will take the place of a physician in cases of 
severe sickness ; but I give simple remedies which have 
been thoroughly tested, and which I hope may relieve many 
others by being thus made public. 



MISCELLANEOUS RECEIPTS. 



To Cleanse Ne'w Stove Furniture. 

Boil skim-milk in the pots, kettles, pans, etc., and then 
wash in good soap-suds. 

To Make Good Soap. 

Ten pounds of potash, eleven of fat, three or four pails of 
boiling water. Pour on and stir until it is dissolved. After 
a few days add boiling water until a proper thickness. 

To Blanch Almonds. 

Shell the nuts and pour boiling water over them, let them 
stand in the boiling water a minute, and then throw them 
into cold water. Rub between the hands, and the dark skin 
will come oif readily. 

To Restore Color to Furniture, etc. 

When anything that is painted has had its color taken 
out by alcohol, rub the place briskly with a piece of 
flannel cloth and kerosene, and in a few minutes it will 
turn dark again. 

229 



230 MISS PARLOA S APPLEDORE COOK BOOK. 

Black Walnut Stain. 

One fourth of a pound of asphaltum, one half of beeswax, 
one gallon of turpentine. If too thin add beeswax ; if 
too light, asphaltum. Soft pine is the wood that stains most 
readily and prettily.
