COMPILER'S PREFACE. 



" The People's Home Library " is a set of very practical books, the aim 
bemg to give the purchaser a complete library of practical information and thus 
save his buying these different books. The compiler was raised in the country 
but for nine years he has been engaged in selling various receipt books and in 
training others to do the same. This has given him an excellent opportunity, 
not only to know the needs of the People in these lines but to study the defects 
and the good points of most books of this nature that are being offered the 
public. We have tried to avoid the mistakes of others, incorporate their good 
points and at the same time add many new features. For nearly nine years 
we have bieen gathering valuable receipts and planning this set of books. It 
has been our constant aim to make this the most practical set of books of this 
nature ever published. We have been exceedingly fortunate in securing authors, 
not only of the highest professional standing and of national reputation, but of 
the highest personal standing in their own communities. They are authors whose 
characters command the respect and confidence of all who know them and this 
is of the utmost importance in books of this kind which are to become house- 
hold guides in a million homes. 

" The People's Home Library " is essentially the People's book. It was 
not only intended for the People but the People themselves helped compile it 
by contributing the " People's Home Remedies " which they have used m their 
hoines for years and which they know to be good. These remedies and receipts 
have been gathered from the whole world over and much credit is due the 
authors for their great care and patience in correcting these receipts and adding 
many helpful suggestions. Every receipt m this book has been thoroughly^ 
tested and tried and found to be good. The authors have most heartily joined 
with the compiler in an earnest effort to make this in truth a most practical book 
for the People and we trust it will prove a real money-saver in the home. We 
believe we have succeeded in our undertaking and we therefore take jpleasure 
in commending this book to the " People," who have so generously contributed 
their favorite receipts and thus made it possible to compile such a work as " The 
People's Home Labrary." 

Sincerely, 

R. C. Barnum.

AUTHOR'S PREFACE. 



Many so-called "home medical books" have been published. While, 
many of them have done much good the fault with most of them has been 
either that they were too technical and thus not a home book at all or, that 
many of the remedies given were unreliable or perhaps even dangerous. 

The aim has been to make this work thoroughly scientific and authentic 
and yet so simple and practical that it can be used in the humblest home.'. 
In' its preparation the very, best medical authorities of this and foreign 
countries have been freely read arid consulted. In giving the description 
and symptoms of diseases such men as the following are our authorities: 
Professor Osier, formerly of Johns Hopkins and now of Oxford; Professor 
Anders of the University of Pennsylvania and Professor Hare of Jefferson 
Medical College, Philadelphia. ' , 

' In the preparation of the parts of the work relating to surgery we have 
consulted such as W. W. Keen, Professor of Surgery in Jefferson Medical 
College and also J. William White, Professor of Clinical Surger)r of_ the Uni- 
versity of Pennsylvania. Both of these men are editors of the American Text 
Book of Surgery. - , v 

In treating of the diseases of women we are especially indebted to the 
wotk of Professor Charles B, Penrose of the University of Pennsylvania. 

In the treatment of the diseases of children and in writing the chapter 
entitled "All About the Mother and Her Baby" the best children's spec- 
ialists in the country have been read and consulted. This list of specialists 
includes both Koplikand Holt of New York, Douglas of Detroit and Tooker 
of Chicago. i^ • 

In preparing the* Herb Departrrient the works most consulted were 
those of Dr. Shoernaker and Dr. Wood, both of Philadelphia and Dr. King, 
who was compiler of " King's Eclectic Dispensatory," 

These men are all specialists in ' their particular line? and are recog- 
nized as authorities by physicians all over the world. Besides the men 
named many other authorities have freely been brought into use. 

A special feature' of the work is " The People's Home Remedies.". 
These follow the physician's treatment of the disease- and will be found the 
most valuable collection of simple home remedies ever published. These 
have bepn gathered from all parts of the world and are universally in use 
among the people. These are not merely what someone " thought " would 
cure, they are the " Mother's Remedies " that actually do cure. Th^y have 
all been carefully gone over by myself a number of times and among them 
I have recognized hundreds of home remedies that I have myself used in 
my many years of fnedical practice and often I have seen fit to add incidents 
and remarks citing cases where these home remedies have cured and ex- 
plaining why they cured. Only the very best have been saved for this work 
and after having had over thirty years of experience as a practicing physi- 
cian I can pronounce them absolutely safe and reliable. Truly this is The 



ii PREFACE. 

People's Book for it was not only written for the people but the people them- 
selves helped get it up. 

Realizing that not all diseases can be treated at home we have endeav- 
ored to make it clear when a physician is necessary and have advised send- 
ing for him in- such cases. That the book may be practical we have seen 
fit to give first place to " Nursing '' and have given both general and special 
instructions as to " Nursiiig and Diet " together with full directions as to 
the use of home-aids and auxiliary treatments. We not only tell " What To 
Do " but, what is often of equal importance, we tell " What Not To Do." 
_^Special attention has also, been given to Preventive Treatments for is it 
' not better to prevent a disease than to wait until you get it and then try to 
cure it? j 

Mj-^ connection with the state University of Michigan as Assistant to 
the Chair of the Theory and Practice of Medicine is perhaps a sufiicient guar- 
antee of the reliability of this book^ and my experience in the hospital together 
with over thirty years of actual medical practice have perhaps rendered me 
competent to make the work thoroughly practical. 

It has been my aim to make this work so reliable, that it will be recom- 
mended by every physician in the land and yet so practical that it will be 
used in every home throughout the country.

QUALITIES OF A GOOD NURSE. , 

The nurse is now an important factor in the treatment of diseases. 
Nurses are born, not made. Some people can never become nurses. A 
good nurse is a combination of, many qualities. She needs to be healthy, 
clean, strong, pleasant, tactful, obedient, cheerful, and in love with her work. 
She should not be given to 'gossip and should have a great big heart filled 
with good things. She needs to know enough to follow the doctor's direc- 
tions and, also, to be able to meet emergencies when the 'doctor is not 
present and cannot be reached. She should know something of the symp- 
toms of diseases and to aid in this we herewithi give a table of symptoms 
that we believe will be found valuable in every home.

thus means the liquid form of the medicine and according to strength it is 
called first (1st) dilution, 3nd dilution, 3rd dilution, etc. The medicine may be 
bought in these strengths. The higher the dilution the weaker the medicine. 

"Trituration " means the powdered" form of the medicine and it is called 
first (1st) trituration or Ix, 2nd trituration ot 3x, 3d trituration or 3x. These 
triturations are generally compressed into tablets as they are handier to use 
in tablet form. The higher the trituration, the weaker the medicine. 

If you are not referring to either the liquid or powder form of the medi- 
cine you can call either 3l dilution or a trituration an "attenuation." It is 
better to specify either the dilution or the trituration. 

In using these medicines in the liquid or dilution form you usually put 
ten to fifteen drops of the dilution (say 1st, 2nd or 3d dilution) into a glass 
otie-half full of water and of this you give two teaspoonfuls every half hour, 
hour, two hours or three hours according to the case. By this you will know 
the dose of any homeopathic medicine used in this book if it is not given. 
We have endeavored, howejver,. to~give the dose in each case. 

When you use the medicine in tablet form you give one or two tablets 
dry on the tongue or dissolve them in a little w^ter. They are given every 
half hour to three hours according to the case so you will know tlie. dose 
should it not be given with any homeopathic remedy in the book.

THE PEOPLE'S HOME MEDICAL BOOK. 



Some medicines are best used in dilution and some in tablet form. We 
will give the kind to use and the strength of the same in naming the remedies. 

You can buy the homeopathic medicines in some drug stores or you, 
can get them from a good homeopathic physician. The Boericke and Tafel 
preparations, are the dearest but it pays to buy them if you can. 

You can use the dilutions to saturate disks. Buy a pound of No. 6 
homeopathic disks. Fill a four-dram bottle with these and then pour it one- 
fourth full of the dilution wanted, that is, enot:gh to saturate all the disks. 
They should look wet. Shake the bottle. This is a nice way of using the 
dilutions. The medicines. keep well if in a dark cool place away from cam- 
phor, ammonia, coflfee, chloroform and liniments. They must be kept, away 
from the allopathic medicine chest. 

The following medicines and strengths are recommended for the homeo-; 
pathic chest. Buy only the homeopathic preparations. Remember "dilu- 
tions" are the liquid forms and "triturations" are tablets or powders, 
.Where triturations are mentioned we advise tablets instead of powders.

DOSES OF MEDICINE FOR VARIOUS AGES. 

Wherever doses are mentioned without giving the age they are intended 
for adults. There are several ways of determining the proportion for a 
cliild. One way, and an easy one to remember, is to add the number 13 to 
the age of the child and use the sum as a denominator, then place the age of 
the child above the line for a numerator and the resulting fraction will be 
the proportion of the adult dose to use- Say the child is 2 years of age, add : 
13 to 3 which makes 14 for the denominator ; then use 3 as the numerator 
and you have 3/14, or 1/7 of the adult dose. This rule will need to be varied 
according to the size and physical condition of the child. If it is a stroilg ' 
robust child the dose may be made a little larger than for the age indicated. 
Then, again, the rule must be varied according to thte kind of medicine given. 
If you are giving opiates or narcotics to a child you Should give but one half 
the dose indicated for the age. Thus, for a child of 3 years instead of giving 
1/7 of a dose as we figured above you should give but half that or 1/14 of 
the adult dose.. If you are giving laixatives you can give two or three times 
the normal child dose. Thus, for the child 3 years old you would' give either 
3/7 or 3/7 of the adult dose. If a child be less than a year old, first find the 
dose for 1 year, then take the proportion of that indicated by the fige. For 
ekample : if the child is six months old, or % year, you would give half the 
dose indicated for a child a year old.

HOW TO MAKE THE PATIENT COMFORTABLE IN BED. 

Changing Night Gown. 

M Remove one sleeve of the gown and immediately put on same sleeve 
of the clean gown by passing your hand through the sleeve from the hand 
end andgrasping the hand of the patient and drawing his arm through, or 
pushing the sleeve up his arm. Slip the gown across the chest under the 



10 THE PEOPLE'S HOME MEDICAL BOOK. 

soiled one and put the second sleeve on the same as the first. Turn to the 
side to button. This is for a gown that opens in the back. When the 
gown is a closed one or opens in the front and is long, have the patient lie 
on bis back with his knees bent. Have him slightly raise his thighs or raise 
him yourself by placing one of your hands under his buttocks (seat) and 
theii draw the gown up with the other hand after it has been put over his 
feet and knees. Then slip one arm under his shoulder and support his head 
with that arm. Draw the gown well up around his neck. Slip one of your 
hands through the upper armhole of one of the sleeves, grasp his arm 
above the elbow and bend it while you draw the sleeve of soiled gown off 
with the other hand. Place the sleeves of clean gown on as directed above 
and button. 

To Change Under Sheet 

If the patient can move turn him on his side and roll soiled sheet over as 
far as possible. Roll the clean sheet half width and put against the soiled 
one. Then gently turn the patient on his back and other side and pull out 
the soiled sheet and at the same time pull or unroll the clean one. When 
rolling the sheets, roll in widths of say four inches and then when the sick 
one is rolled on his back and side he will not feel the roll. When the patient 
cannot be moved you can work the soiled sheet from the top down and 
roll the clean one and work it down slowly and gently at the same time 
with very little lifting of the patient. • 

How to Move the Patient from One Bed to Another. 

Place beds tojjether. If of the same height draw the patient to the 
new bed by pulling on the sheet. It is best to roll the sheet up to the 
patient for it is thus made stronger and gives a better hold. When it is 
necessary to c'.rry the patient roll him in the upper sheet and blanket. 
It usually takes two for this. One puts his hands under the patient's 
shoulders ana buttocks and the other under his thighs and back. Draw 
him gently to the edge of the bed and carry carefully to the bed which has 
been prepared. 

To Lift and Carry the Patient When Sitting, 

Place your arm over his shoulder and take a firm hold under the opposite 
artn. Have the patient clasp his arms on your far shoulder and then place 
your free arm under his knees. 

To Draw a Patient Up in Bed. 

Bend the patient's knees so that his feet will rest firmly on the bed; 
grasp him under his far arm, bending your arm so that his head will rest 
in your elbow joint; put your other arm under his thighs, bend your knees 
slightly to avoid bending your back, and move the patient gently upward. If 
two are required, do as follows: One grasps i the patient under the arm as 
though he were to move him alone and then places the other arm under the 
small of the back. The other person also places one arm under the small 
of the back and the other arm under his thighs. 



NURSING DEPARTMENT. 11 

How to Sit a Patient Up in Bed. 
You can have a back-rest or pad a chair. Put a cane or wooden seated 
chair up-side-down on the bed with front oart against the bed or bedstead. 
Then put pillo\/s between the patient and chair and arrange to his comfort. 

To Place a Patient in a Chair, 

Place the chair with the front to the bed ; jnake it soft with pillows on 
the seat and at the back with open end of pillow case down. Place one arm 
around the patient's shoulder with the hand under his opposite arm. Place 
your other arm under his thighs. If too heavy for one, put one of your arms 
around shoulder as before and the other under his buttocks. The second 
person then puts one arm around small of back and the other under the 
thighs near the knees. 

The Bed Pan and How to Use It. 

You should always use a bed pan as the old-fashioned chamber neces- 
sitates sitting the patient up and cannot be used in many diseases. The 
old kind should never be used in typhoid fever, appendicitis or any bowel 
trouble. Get the metal bed pan. It should be kept clean and sweet. Wash 
daily with hot water and soap suds and scald. Copperas solution is a good 
thing to use in them as a disinfectant for bowel contents and urine. To use 
the bed pan, bend the knees of the patient so that his feet will rest firmly 
on the bed. Then pass one hand under the lower part of the batk and 
raise him a little as you gently push the pan up with the other hand. Raise 
him the same way before attempting to remove the pan. Have the pan 
warm and cover it immediately after it is removed. To cleanse the parts 
thoroughly it is well to place a clean pan and then cleanse. 

How to Cleanse the Mouth and Teeth. 
This is very needful in disease and especially in typhoid fever. Wrap 
a piece of gauze or absorbent cotton or a piece of clean linen around your 
index finger or around a small piece of whale bone or stick. Wet this in 
the mouth wash and clean every part thoroughly. Carefully clean the tongue 
but do not use the same piece twice. Listerine, half strength, or any other like 
antiseptic is good. The boric acid solution is especially good. 

Prevention and Care of Bed Sores. 
These are often due to old age, fevers, some spinal disease, paralysis or 
gerieral dropsy but the exciting causes are wrinkles in the bed clothes, 
moisture from the bowels and urine, bread crumbs, dirt, and remaining in 
one position too long. The preventive treatment is cleanliness and change 
of position. The active treatment is to bathe the red spot with alcohol and 
dust with the following powder from two to four times in twenty-four 
hours. Mix % ounce of powder of boric acid with 1 ounce of powder of oxide 
of zinc. Rubber rings are also good. If the skin is in danger of breaking 
wash gently with warm alcohol every six hours and rub with alcohol and 
powder every three hours. When the sores have formed observe cleanliness 
and use an ointment of castor oil and alcohol thickened with zinc oxide pow- 
der. Another good powder is boric acid, % dram; oxide of zinc, 1 dram; 
lanoline, 6 ounces; alboline, % ounce. 



13 THE PEOPLE'S HOME MEDICAL BOOK. 

DISINFECTANTS AND ANTISEPTICS. 

Where we use disinfectants they are intended for use in the sick room, 
for vessels, etc., but are generally too strong for use on the body. The 
antiseptics are intended for use on the body such as for sores, mouth 
washes, etc. 

Carbolic Acid Disinfectant. — Use 6% ounces of carbolic acid to a gallon of 
water. This is suitable for clothing, dishes, metals and the hands of nurses. 
Soak clothes in it and boil. 

It can also be used on curtains and sheets and placed at doors and win- 
dows to prevent the spread of the contagion. 

Carbolic Acid Aptiseptic Solution. — Use 1 part of carbolic acid to 125 
parts of water, or 1 teaspoonful of acid to a pint of water. This may be used as 
a vaginal douche or when there is a foul smelling discharge from sores, etc., 
but for wounds and sores I would advise the use of some of the milder anti- 
septics such as glyco-thymoline, listerine, borolyptal or boric acid solution. 
Carbolic acid in any form should be marked " Poison," and should be kept 
out of reach of children. 

Corrosive Sublimate (Bichloride of Mercury) Disinfectant and Anti- 
septic. — This can be bought in tablets of any strength desired so that when 
dissolved in water it will make from one one-thousandth to a one ten- 
thousandth solution. Dissolve one tablet, strength one to four-thousand 
in a pint of boiling water. Keep in a bottle marked " Poison." Good for 
bed pan and as' a cleansing wash for old sores. It is better to use this as 
a disinfectant only and use something else as an antiseptic. 

Boric Acid Antiseptic Wash for Mouth. — Dissolve % ounce of boric acid 
in a pint of water. 

Copperas Disinfectant. — Put a lump as large as a walnut in the chamber 
with half a pint of water to receive discharges of all kinds such as urine, 
sputum, feces and vomited matter from contagious and infectious patients. 

Chloride of Lime. — ^Use 6 ounces of lime to a gallon of soft water. It 
should be kept' in the vessel to receive the discharges from contagious pa- 
tients. Let it stand for several hours before emptying. 

Disinfecting Vapor. — ^This is useful in the room of a diphtheria patient 
or patient of foul odors. Use pure carbolic acid, 1 ounce ; oil of eucalyptus. 
1 ounce ; spirits of turpentine, 4 ounces. Put one or two tablespoonfuls into 
hot water and keep it simmering constantly. Avoid going near the fire with 
this mixture. 

Dry Disinfectants. — Chloride of lime and copperas may be used freely in 
closets and cesspools. 

Disinfecting a Room After a Contagious Disease. — Take the paper from 
the walls and wash the walls and the woodwork with a one to one-thousand 
solution of corrosive sublimate then stop up all the cracks and burn sulphur 
in the room. Wash the hands carefully after having them in the above 
solution. Formaldehyde is a more effective disinfectant to burn in the room 
but it is dangerous and it is best to leave its use to the health officers. 

BATHS. 

Bathing is essential to health. Some people can enjoy it daily; some 
want it cold and others warm. Morning is usually the best time. The water 



NURSING DEPARTMENT. 13 

should not be too warm as one is then likely to take cold. When taking 
a cold bath put water on the back of the neck first and then step into the 
bath. This lessens the chilly feeling. If you bathe frequently do not bathe 
longer than ten minutes. Rub briskly during and after a cold bath. 

Bed Bath. — Close the windows, be sure there is no draught and that 
the' room is warm and comfortable. Place a folded blanket over the chest 
and tuck a corner of it under the mattress on both sides to keep it from 
slipping down; turn down the bed clothing, unfolding the blanket at the 
same time; slip second blanket or half of large one under the patient and 
take off the night gown. Then proceed first with the face, neck, arms, chest, 
etc., and dry as you go. Rub the patient afterward with alcohol. Never 
expose the patient but always keep him covered. Do not hurry and on the 
other hand do not take so long as \o exhaust the patient. Wash cloths should 
be well wrung out before using. Unless specially directed the temperature 
of the water is to be comfortable for the patient. 

To Wash the Hair of the Patient. — Do not do this in a case of diphtheria. 
It is generally prohibited in acute diseases. In chronic diseases it is generally 
necessary. You need a pitcher, soap, plenty of hot and cold water and a 
jar into which to empty the water. You will also need some soft towels and a 
rubber to protect the pillows. Bring the patient to the side of the bed; pin 
one end of the rubber around the neck and with the rest make a trough ex- 
tending to a foot bath or, basin a few inches lower than the head to receive the 
dripping. First use soap water, rubbing hair and scalp well, and follow with 
clear water. Dry the hair with warm towels and by fanning. Wait until 
dry before braiding. 

Tub Bath. — This is for a high fever. Use a portable tub if possible. 

Sponge Baths. — Must be given by an experienced hand. An easy way 
to give a sponge or towel bath is to put one thick flannel sheet under and 
one over the patient after the night robe has been taken off. The blankets 
will absorb all the water you spill. Use water which is comfortable for the 
patient, unless there is a high fever, when it should be as cold as can be 
borne without badly affecting the patient. Wring cloth or sponge pretty 
dry and commence with the face and go down. Rub dry after washing a 
foot or two of space. In this way a bath can be given very easily. After 
a corrl sweat a patient can be washed off in the same way only you need 
not use any new sheets. The old ones will do for you must change them 
anyv/ay. All sheets should be thoroughly dried and aired before being used. 
Do not take them out of their packing place and put directly upon the sick 
bed. Put them in the sunlight by a closed window or on a radiator or in 
any other place where they will air and dry. 

Sitz Bath. — This is good for inflammations of the pelvic organs and rec- 
tum and also in labor. You should have a specially prepared tub. Fasten 
a blanket around both the patient and the tub and wrap a second blanket 
around patient's feet and hips. The temperature of the water should be from 
110 to 112 degrees. The bath should last five minutes and perhaps ten 
minutes in some cases. 

In labor you can use a common tub and sit in it or sit over a large pail 
of hot water. This frequently increases the pain and relaxes the perineum. 

Foot Baths. — Fold the bed clothes up from the foot of the bed to above 
the patient's knees. Cover the feet and limbs with a double blanket and 
turn the blanket over the' feet and back under the hips. Bend the patient's 



14 THE PEOPLE'S HOME MEDICAL BOOK. 

knees and place foot tub half filled with water, 112 to 115 degrees, length^ 
wise in the bed between the folds of the blanket. Lift the feet with one 
hand and with the other draw the tub under them. Put them into the 
water slowly so as to accustom them to the heated water. Fold the blanket- 
around the tub and knees and bring down the bed clothes. In ten minutes 
carefully pour in some more hot water but do not pour it directly on the 
patient's feet for fear of burning. The bath may last twenty minutes. 
Take it away in the same manner as you placed it there. Dry the feet well 
and place a hot water bag against them. 

Sulphur Baths. — Add 30 grains of sulphate of potassium to each gallon 
of water which should be of the temperature of about 95 degrees. Remember 
that sulphur discolors metal. 

Bran Baths. — Boil one pound of bran in a bag for twenty minutes ; drain 
ofif the fluid and add it to the bath water at the temperature of about 95 
degrees. Fill tub half full of water. 

Soda Baths. — These are for itching of the skin. Use 8 ounces of soda to 
each gallon of watei. Remain quiet in these baths for from five to twenty 
minutes. Envelop the patient in a hot sheet and dry gently. 

Salt Baths. — Use 15 pounds of salt to a tub half full of water. The tem- 
perature should be from 65 to 70 degrees. Rub well both during and after ■ 
the bath. 

Mustard Foot Baths. — These are good for colds and whenever you wish 
to draw the blood from the head to the extremities. Use two tablespoonful^ 
of mustard to a gallon of hot water. 

Internal Baths. — Douches and injections are for the vagina, womb, nose 
and ear. The water may be either clear or medicated and either warm or 
hot — sometimes very hot. The ordinary temperature is from 110 to 115 
degrees. Various antiseptics and medicines are used, such as carbolic acid, 
listerine, glyco-thymoline, witch hazel, calendula, hydrastis, tannin,, etc. 

Enemas are injections into the rectum. These are used to destroy worms 
and germs and also for bleeding, diarrhoea, gas, soothing purposes and to 
produce a movement of the bowels. They are sometimes given for nourish- 
ment when the patient is unable to eat and are then called enematas. Yotr 
need a bed pan and either a fountain or a bulb syringe. A hard rubber one 
holding from one-half ounce to an ounce should be used for babies. The 
solutions used are warm water, soap and water or oil for the bowels- 
Medicated water may be used as directed for other troubles. 



VENTILATION AND TEMPERATURE OF SICK ROOM. 

Fresh air and sunlight are necessary in the sick room. They are anti- 
septic and health giving. Any room can easily be ventilated. If the patient 
cannot stand to have the window open continually it can be opened fre- 
quently. The draught should not be over the patient. Cover the sick one 
and keep the cover up from the head so that he may breathe. If the bed is 
near the window place a screen or quilt on a high chair to keep the draught 
from the patient. Keep the arms and body under the cover and cover the 
head with a big handkerchief or cover up entirely as before directed while 
the room is being thoroughly ventilated with the windows open. The air 
in a room should never smell bad. Ventilate often or have continuous ven- 



NURSING DEPARTMENT. 15 

tilation if possible. For continuous ventilation raise the lower sash of a 
window a few inches and put a board in the opening. The air then enters 
the room at the bottom of the upper sash or between the two sashes and no 
draught is created. The temperature should vary for different diseases and 
different persons. Usually it should be from 68 to 72 degrees. 



THE TEMPERATURE, PULSE AND RESPIRATION OF THE 

PATIENT. 

The normal temperature is 98 6/10 degrees Fahrenheit. In infants it 
is higher. The temperature should be taken in the mouth under the tongue 
and with the lips closed. It may also be taken in the arm pit with the arm 
close to the side but this is not as true a way. It may also be taken in, the 
rectum. When taken in the mouth the patient must not have recently had 
anything either hot or cold in the mouth. Before taking the temperature 
shake the thermometer down to 95 or 96 degrees. It should remain in the 
mouth from one to ten minutes. The thermometer will need to be kept in 
the rectum longer than in the mouth. If taken in the arm pit the temperature 
will be from 3/10 to % a degree lower. Keep the thermometer clean but do 
not put it into hot water. 

The normal pulse is 70 to 74 per minute. It varies it, different persons. 

The respiration is usually about 18 times a minute; children, 20 to 24; 
babes, 24 to 30. 



INFECTIOUS AND CONTAGIOUS DISEASES. 

Care to be Taken. — A contagious disease is one which can be communi- 
cated by coming in contact with or near to the patient, his clothing, etc. 
Scarlet fever, measles, small-pox and diphtheria are examples. An in- 
fectous disease is one caused by the entrance into the body of disease-bearing 
(pathogenic) organisms. Typhoid fever is such a disease. In infectious and 
contagious diseases the feces, urine and sputum should always be received 
in disinfecting material which is placed in the vessels. Linen and utensils 
used by the patient and the nurse should be disinfected. Articles taken from 
the bed of such a patient should be immediately put into a pail or vessel 
containing a disinfecting water and should then be carried to a disinfecting 
room. The attendants should be very careful. I once had a nurse attending 
a typhoid case who was very careless and finally took the disease and came 
near dying. It pays to be careful. 

The nurse should never leave the room without washing her face and 
hands in a 5 pet. carbolic acid solution and she should put on a disinfected 
sheet and hood. When attending to the patient she should be careful not 
to get any of the discharges upon her hands or face or in the eyes or mouth 
or on any other part of her person. Frequently in diphtheria the patient 
coughs and if care is -not taken some of the discharge may get into her 
eyes and mouth. When irrigating such a patient's throat glasses should 
be used to protect the eyes of the nurse and gauze should be tied over the 
mouth. Do not put your hands to your mouth, face or eyes. Similar care 
must be exercised in scarlet fever and small-pox and the doctor's directions 
thoroughly carried out. 



16 THE PEOPLE'S HOME MEDICAL BOOK. 

Disinfection is done by the legal authorities after the patient has com-- 
pletely recovered. Any one having a contagious disease in the house and not 
having a doctor must notify the health officer of the fact in ©rder to comply 
with the requirements of the law. The house is then quarantined, a card 
placed in plain sight and orders given as to the extent of the quarantine. 
These must be obeyed. The nurse is of great help in case of a contagious 
disease but she can dp even more in case of infectious diseases such as typhoid 
fever. 

Isolation and Disinfection in Contagious Diseases. — As soon as any one 
in a family has a contagious disease like diphtheria, scarlet fever or small-pox, 
that person should immediately be placed in a pleasant, sunny room with all 
clothing, rugs, carpets, upholstered chairs and unnecessary furniture removed, 
keeping only such furniture and bedding as may be needed. It is well 
to do this even before the disease has been pronounced contagious. In this 
way other members of the family may be saved from the disease. The 
nurse should not mingle with the family. Of course nothing must be re- 
moved from the patient's room without being thoroughly disinfected. 

Dishes. — Place dishes used by the patient in a metallic vessel containing 
disinfecting water. Cover this vessel with a sheet wrung out of a disinfectant 
and place outside the door of the isolated room. The vessel should be removed 
by an outside party once in twenty-four hours to the kitchen stove and its con- 
tents boiled for thirty minutes in the same vessel. Unused food should be 
put into a covered pail and burned. All this is to be done by one outside 
of the sick room. 

Bed Linen, Towels, Etc. — These should be removed to the kitchen and 
boiled in the disinfecting water in which they were carried there or they 
should be carried to the kitchen in a sheet wet with a disinfectant fluid and 
put into a boiler and boiled for one-half hour. 

Urine and Feces. — These should be received in a vessel containing a 
disinfectant such as carbolic acid or copperas, 1 part to 30 parts water. 
After the vessel has been used add a quantity of the disinfecting fluid equal 
to the discharges, mix the two thoroughly, cover and set aside for one-half 
hour and then empty into the closet. Also keep a copperas disinfectant in 
the bed pan when not in use. Rinse in hot water before using and then 
put in necessary solution. 

Spitting Cups and Gauze Handkerchiefs. — In these diseases spitting cups 
should be used. Nose discharges should be caught in gauze and burned 
immediately in diphtheria cases or they should be thrown into a covered 
cup containing a disinfectant and soon burned. 

GENERAL DIRECTIONS FOR NURSING VARIOUS DISEASES. 

The Giving of Medicines. — Medicines should always be given regularly 
unless the patient is in a refreshing sleep. Use clean glasses and spoons. 
Cover the glasses and keep in a cool place away from patient. Never cover 
w^th newspaper and never use the same spoonfor two different medicines. 

Feeding. — This is an important part in the treatment of disease. 
Usually the best food is milk and white of eggs or foods made with them. 
In diseases of the stomach, liver, bowels, kidneys and bladder the food is 
of supreme importance. No case of typhoid fever can be treated intelligently 
without paying particular attention to the diet. Better eat too little than too

much. Good pure milk is usually safe when given often and in small quan- 
tities. Then there are the food formulas, soups, gruels, teas, etc., some of 
which may be used. 

Inflammations. — There is inflammation in injuries and in inflammatory 
diseases like sore throat, appendicitis, inflammatory rheumatism, pneumonia, 
etc. Hot water bags are helpful when applied to the afflicted parts for ear 
and throat troubles, pleurisy, cramps, etc. They are also frequently good 
in neuritis and sciatica. Hot water applications are sometimes good for 
appendicitis but in this disease ice is generally better. Poultices are of many 
kinds and are often used. The hot water bag frequently takes their place. 
Bread and milk, mustard and flaxseed are used mostly. Rubber ice bags 
are frequently used in appendicitis and brain troubles such as congestion and 
sunstroke. 

Antiphlogistine and other preparations of this kind are now frequently 
used in inflammatory troubles such as pneumonia, rheumatism, etc. They 
are frequently of value. 

How and When to Make a Person Sweat. — The first thing to do in colds, 
inflammation, sore throat, quinsy, tonsilitis, bronchitis, laryngitis, pleurisy, 
pneumonia, grip, congestion of the lungs, lumbago or sciatica, is to cause 
sweating either with medicines, teas or external means. In promoting sweat- 
ing you equalize the circulation and relieve the congestion. Internally, teas 
such as ginger, boneset, horehound, crawleyroot, Virginia snake-root, sage, 
elder blossom, dwarf elder, blessed thistle, spruce pine, flaxseed, catnip or slip- 
pery elm are good. Hot lemonade will also cause one to sweat freely. While 
taking hot drinks a hot mustard foot bath will help. Directions for making 
these teas will be found elsewhere in tlje book. Externally, apply heat and 
moisture from bottles of hot water or a hot water bag. Hot fomentations are 
also good. 

Corn Sweat. — One of the best ways of causing profuse sweating is by 
the aid of ears of corn and is known as the " corn sweat." Put 20 ears of 
corn into a boiler of hot water, boil thoroughly for half an hour or until the 
boiled-corn smell is noticed ; then take them out and wrap in five large towels 
using four ears for each towel. Put an ear in the end of a towel, give one or 
two wraps to cover it then put in another ear in the same way till you have 
a pack of four ears. Make the other four packs in the same way. Put one 
pack at the feet, two at the hips (one on each side) and one under each arm 
and then cover the patient up to the neck and stay by the bed and hold the 
covers there if necessary. In a short time the patient will feel uncomfortable 
from the heat but soon there will be moisture and comfort. This sweat is not 
especially debilitating. The patient will sweat for a few hours and then the 
sweating will gradually decrease when you should quickly give a warm 
sponge bath over the entire body. Be careful not to let the patient take cold. 
Put a new night dress on the patient and well-aired bedding on the bed. 
If given in time the corn sweat will break up many diseases. It is also good 
in diseases where the system has become clogged. It must then be given 
carefully or it will weaken the patient. In such cases give stimulants. 

In giving the full sweat the packs of corn are not to be taken away 

while they are still hot but are to be allowed to cool gradually and then they 

may be t-aken away without stopping the sweating too suddenly. Should 

the full sweat not be desired you can first take the packs from under the 

a

arms and after awhile from the 'hips and then later from the feet. In this 
way the sweating is not checked suddenly. 

Bronchitis or Croup Tent. — This is made by throwing over the bed a 
large sheet which is held several feet above the patient by means of four 
broomsticks or poles which are tied, one to each corner of the bed. You 
can decorate this tent and make it attractive for the child if you wish. 
Into this tent, at the foot of the bed, may be discharged a small quantity 
of steam such as is given off from an ordinary kettle of water which is 
kept constantly boiling. This is very good for sore throat, quinsy, croup, 
bronchitis, asthma, whooping cough, etc. 

Appendicitis, Peritonitis and Other Pains in the Abdomen. — The ice bag 
is frequently used for appendicitis. Sometimes hot cloths relieve the pain. 
The covers should not rest upon the patient with inflammations in this re- 
gion. Have barrel hoops sawed in two and make a frame to support the bed- 
ding. Especially in peritonitis does the bedding hurt the patient. Patients 
must be kept quiet and must pass urine and feces in a bed pan. The food 
must be liquid and small in quantity. Water is generally allowed. Pain 
in the bowels when not caused by disease is frequently relieved by rubbing 
and massaging. Rub on sweet oil or apply cloths wrung out of hot water 
with a little turpentine in it. Gas colic is frequently relieved in this way. 
Gas in the stomach is relieved by simple remedies such as soda, ginger, 
peppermint, hot water, catnip tea and hot, brandy or whisky. Enemas are 
also good. 

Bronchitis, Pleurisy and Pneumonia. — The temperature and ventilation of 
the room should be carefully looked after. Do not cover too thickly; just 
enough to keep the patient warm. If poultices are used see that they are warm 
and moist. Do not wet the patient with them. They can be kept in place with 
adhesive plaster. Do little talking in such cases as it is usually hard enough 
for the patient to breathe. Keep visitors, especially gloomy ones, out of the 
room. Aid in raising the patient when he coug^hs and wipe the mucus from 
his lips. Give the food as regularly as the medicine. Tell the doctor all the 
bad and all the good symptoms occurring between his visits but do not tell 
the bad .symptoms to or before the patient. Keep a cheerful countenance and 
do not scold if patients are troublesome and cross. Remember they are 
suffering. Have the patient pass urine at least four times a day, and use 
the bed pan at such times. 

Camphor and lard are frequently rubbed on the chest of children with 
lung and bronchial troubles and a cotton jacket is often worn. When poul- 
tices are taken off cover the parts with warm dry flannels. Ice bags must 
be carefully used as some people cannot stand them. In these diseases you 
cannot work by set rules but must meet the emergencies as they arise. 

Sore Throat. — Apply cold applications to the throat or tonsils at the be- 
ginning and perhaps^ hot ones later. The application of fat salted pork is 
also good. Make a gargle of some simple remedy like salt, sage, vinegar, 
pepper or hot water. Always keep the mouth and teeth clean. Take plenty 
of good cold water ; a little at a time but frequently. 

Lumbago, Sciatica and Inflammatory Rheumatism. — In these diseases 
quiet is necessary. Applications oE moist heat are frequently helpful. Mus- 
tard plasters or a fly blister along the region of the sciatic nerve are good 
in some cases. A person with inflammatory rheumatism needs lots of pare 
tor the pain is very great. Sometimes the pain in the joints is eased by bath- 



NURSING DEPARTMENT. 19 

ing with hot applications and in other cases the joints need to be covered 
wi^h cotton. The arrangement of pillows to the comfort of a rheumatic 
patient is an art that should and with practice and patience can be learned 
by all. If you have no patience you had better not nurse such a case. 

Nervous Prostration and Hysteria. — What has been said above regardin^f 
patience applies also in case of nervous prostration. Very few nurses are of 
much good in these cases because they do not sympathize with the patient 
who is in terrible distress. Things which are unreal to a person in health 
are real to the patient and such a patient needs lots of encouragement con- 
stantly and in ever increasing doses. Encouragement and rest with a little 
medicine and proper food will effect a cure. Nurses must also remember 
that hysteria is a disease and not a whim to be sneezed at. No nurse should 
make fun of a patient. 

Dysentery and Diarrhea. — In these cases it is a good thing to give some- 
thing at the beginning to move the bowels. Castor oil, salts or spiced syrup 
of rhubarb are good. In these diseases there is generally irritating material 
in the bowels and by giving a laxative you will get rid of it and frequently 
stop the bowel trouble. A 14 grain tablet of calomel every hour until the 
bowels move freely is also good but either castor oil or salts is almost always 
at hand. 

Measles. — Special care should be taken of the eyes for they are weak and 
reading or too much light will ruin them. The patient should remain in a 
darkened room and should not use the eyes much until sometime after he 
has recovered from the disease. Do not take cold. Sweating can be pro- 
duced by drinking hot teas or hot water and even by drinking cold water 
frequently and in small quantities. 

Scarlet Fever. — Always keep the patient warm and comfortable and put 
even the lightest case to bed. Be careful not to let the patient take cold or the 
kidneys will become diseased. Deafness is often the result of scarlet fever. 
Above all things do not let the patient take cold. 

Typhoid Fever. — In this disease any good nurse can do much good. It is a 
long continued disease. There should be regular feeding and attention paid 
to the cleanliness of the patient, to the stools, urine and sputum. The body 
must be sponged when necessary. The patient must be kept quiet in bed; 
the arranging and re-arranging of the bed clothes and pillows must be care- 
fully attended to. In typhoid the patient must never get up to stool or for 
any other purpose. The intestines are very thin, ulcerated and sore and 
may easily be ruptured or perforated. 

Headache and Neuralgia. — For these a sensible nurse can do a great deal 
of good. A mustard plaster on the back of the neck relieves a great many 
headaches and neuralgias. Hot or cold cloths, dry or wet, are good in many 
cases. The hot water bottle may be applied to the back of the neck for 
congestive headaches. The ice bag on top of the head is good for conges- 
tive headaches and for brain diseases. Rubbing the head, forehead, temples 
and the back of the neck often helps and produces sleep. Rubbing with 
camphor or ammonia water is good in some cases. All should be done very 
gently, quietly and sympathetically and usually in a shaded quiet room. 

Earache. — Hot dry applications such as a hot salt bag, or hot moist 
applications such as hops and vinegar are excellent. Use a bread and milk 
poultice with a little laudanum in it for adults. The hot water bottle is 
good and hot bran will be found effective when applied either dry or moist.

CARE OF BODY AFTER DEATH. 

As soon as the patient has stopped breathing and death is certain, 
straighten the limbs and place the arms by the side or across the chest as de- 
sired. Close the eyelids and keep them closed either with your fingers or by 
placing something upon them. If false teeth have been worn they should 
be placed in the mouth soon after death before the jaws have set. Then 
close the mouth and tie a handkerchief under the jaw after first putting 
a pad under the jaw. Tie the handkerchief on top of the head, tight 
enough to make the mouth close and look natural. Comb and, if a 
woman, braid the hair; also wash and dress the body if so desired and 
at the same time change the bed linen. Tie knees and ankles together with 
a broad bandage. You can also bind the hands in place if necessary. Make 
the body look natural and comfortable and cover with a sheet. If the bodj 
is dean I never could see the use of washing it after death. It seems a 
needless exposure and an unnecessary annoyance to the relatives. Call an 
undertaker but do not let him use an injection until death is an absolute 
certainty. If you are not certain of dea-th keep the body until signs of 
decay are seen before you allow any injection or preparation to be used. 
Not many people have been buried alive but some have been, so keep your 
friends till death is certain. Displacement of the body or extremities some- 
times occurs after burial. This is generally due to a sudden contraction of 
the muscles. It does not 6ften occur but such cases are on record. That, 
person was dead but simply had an "after death " contraction. I always 
advise the undertaker to delay as long as possible before preparing the body 
and in cold weather I can see no necessity for using any preparation on the 
body. 



ACCIDENTS AND EMERGENCIES. 
" What to Do " and "What Not to Do." 

APOPLEXY. — (See General Treatment.) Place patient in lying position 
with head higher than body, loosen clothing and apply cold water to head. 
Put feet in hot mustard water. If tongue draws back put towel or hand- 
kerchief over it and keep it forward. Keep bowels open and draw urine if 
necessary. Patient must remain quiet. 

ASPHYXIA OR SUFFOCATION.— Use artificial respiration as for 
drowning. (See " Drowning.") 

BANDAGING.— (See Chapter Following.) 

BITES OF SNAKES. — If on a limb tie a rope or handkerchief around the 
limb just above the wound. Cleanse the wound at once. Suck the wound ; if 
the poison is swallowed accidentally it is not very dangerous. Cut the wound 
open so the blood will flow freely then fill it with salt ; or, if you have it, use 
permanganate of potash. Give full doses of this drug hypodermically about 
the wound. It should be diluted three-fourths with water and should be fol- 
lowed with full doses of brandy or whisky. Tie tight above wound with 
ligature and open wound thoroughly. 
PEOPLE'S HOME REMEDIES.— 

1. Plantain Leaves. — Suck out the poison and after cutting the wound 



NURSING DEPARTMENT. 31 

open apply bruised plantain leaves and give a teaspoonful of the juice from 
the bruised leaves every hour. 

2. Baking Soda. — Cut open the wound, suck out the poison and apply 
moistened baking soda. Keep the parts wet for several hours. 

3. Lime. — Mix two tablespoonfuls of chloride of lime with one-half pint 
of water. Bathe the wound promptly and freely. 

4. Turpentine. — Turn a bottle of turpentine upside down over the 
snake bite and hold it there until relief is obtained. 

5. Chicken Entrails. — Kill a chicken and while warm cut open and lay 
upon wound, entrails and all, and it will draw out the poison. 

Physician's Remark. — This draws well. It had better be applied after 
the wound has been sucked and cauterized. 

6. Tobacco and Salt. — Moisten some tobacco and salt and tie on wound 
as a poultice. 

7. Onions and Salt. — Apply a poultice of onions and salt. 

8. Salt and Lamp Oil.^-Apply table salt and lamp oil. 
Note. — Use the above after sucking and cauterizing. 

9. Sucking. — Suck the wound. 

BITES OF RATTLE-SNAKES.— Cleanse and suck the wound and use 
permanganate of potash as directed imder " Snake Bites " above. Cauterize 
by applying a red hot iron. 

PEOPLE'S HOME REMEDIES.— 

1. Salt. — Apply salt at once. 

2. Soda and Salt. — Bandage above the wound, rub the swelling down- 
ward, poultice with soda and alternately keep the wound in fresh soda and 
salt water, changing frequently. This receipt is from a person who has had 
experience. 

BITES AND STINGS OF INSECTS.— For stings of hornets or bees pull 
out the sting and apply peroxide of hydrogen. Vinegar either pure or di- 
luted is good. Apply a mud poultice made of clay. For mosquito bites apply 
phenol, one part, mixed with water from 50 to 100 parts. 
PEOPLE'S HOME REMEDIES.— 

1. Witch Hazel. — Freely applied this gives quick relief in cases of 
bites or stings of mosquitoes, spiders, snakes, bees or wasps. 

3. Ammonia or Salt. — For bites and stings of insects bathe the parts 
frequently with either ammonia water or salt and water. 

Physician's Note. — Ammonia destroys the local poison by blistering the 
part, thus drawing out the fluid poison. 

3. Olive Oil. — Apply olive oil to the parts. 

4. Clay. — Wet clay earth or black mud applied to bites and stings is 
one of the best remedies and one that is easily obtained. 

Physician's Remark. — I know this to be good. There is sometimes dan- 
ger of infection but often other remedies are not at hand. 

5. Arnica. — Tincture of arnica is an old and tried remedy. 

6. Plantain Leaves. — In case of a bad bite or sting of an insect or a 
snake apply a poultice made of common plantain leaves. This is one of the 
very best remedies and one does not generally have to look far to find plan- 
tain as all are aware who have tried to keep it out of the lawns and gardens. 

Physician's Remarks. — Plantain has quite an^ action on the skin. It is 



22 PEOPLE'S HOME MEDICAL BOOK. 

also good for ivy poisoning, burns, scalds and bruises. Pound the fresh 
leaves to a paste and apply. 

7. Catnip and Plantain. — Another lady writes that for bites and stings 
of all kinds of insects she applies bruised catnip and plantain leaves to the 
parts and gives a teaspoonful of the juice of the plantain every hour. 

8. Salt and Soda. — Table salt and baking soda, in equal parts, applied 
to spider bites will relieve the pain and stop the swelling. 

' Physician's Remark. — Salt draws and soda soothes. 

9. Onion. — For bites and stings apply a piece of raw onion to the 
woitnd. Change the piece of onion every ten minutes and relief will soon 
be obtained. One physician says he uses no other remedy. 

Physician's Remark. — Raw onion is irritating and stimulating to the 
skin and causes the skin to discharge a fluid thus ridding the part of the 
local poison. Keep on for three or four hours. . 

10. Baking Soda. — Apply baking soda to the afifected parts for stings. 

11. Clay. — For stings apply a poultice of clay. 

13. Coal Oil. — In case of stings apply coal oil freely. 

BITES OF DOGS.— See article on "Hydrophobia" in general depart- 
ment. 

BITES FROM CATS.— See " Hydrophobia." 

PEOPLE'S HOME REMEDIES.— 

1. For bites from cats bathe the parts bitten with extract of witch hazel * 
or if badly bitten wet cotton cloth in the same and bind on and keep parts 
wet. I have found witch hazel will kill all such poison. 

Physician's Remark. — Better kill the cat. 

BLEEDING OR HEMORRHAGE.— (For Bleeding from Nose see 
" Nose Bleed.") Apply alum locally. Eat cinnamon for uterine hemorrhage 
of the oozing kind or use tannic acid diluted or white oak bark +ca. locally as a 
douche. Common salt is good for light bleeding. If the bleeding is from an 
artery and comes in spurts tie a rope or handkerchief around the limb between 
the wound and heart. Put a stick under the rope or handkerchief and twist 
tight. If the bleeding is from veins put the rope or handkerchief on the 
side of the wound farthest from the heart. If a finger is cut tie a cord about 
it tightly above the wound and press on the artery with the fingers. In 
severe bleeding place the patient flat on the ground and have him smell of 
camphor or ammonia. If the hemorrhage is from the lungs the blood will be 
a bright red and be mixed with air and consequently frothy. If the blood is 
from the stomach it is more likely to be of a dark color. In either case have 
the patient lie flat and remain quiet. Give strong salt water and give the 
patient ice in the mouth. If the bleeding is from the stomach apply cloths 
wrung out of cold water to the stomach. 

PEOPLE'S HOME REMEDIES.— 

1. Vinegar. — For bleeding from the stomach give two teaspoonfuls of 
vinegar or a little cold water every half hour. 

Physician's Remark. — Vinegar is slightly astringent. 

2. Lemon Juice. — To stop bleeding from the stomach an excellent 
remedy is two teaspoonfuls of lemon juice in some cold water. Repeat this 
every half hour until the bleeding stops. 



NURSING DEPARTMENT. 2^ 

3. Ice. — Give the patient a little cracked ice until the bleeding from 
the stomach is controlled. 

4 Sage and Honey. — To stop vomiting of . blood give three teaspoon- 
fuls of sage juice mixed with a little honey. Repeat in fifteen minutes if 
necessary. 

5. Salt. — Small quantities of salt will stop bleeding from the stomach 
or lungs. A teaspoonful or two is generally sufficient. 

6. Alum. — Pulverized alum dissolved in water is good for bleeding 
-from the stomach. 

7. Cranesbill. — Powdered cranesbill applied to the parts and covered 
with a compress of cotton is good for bleeding and for ulcers. 

8. Flour and Salt.-7A mixture of fiOur and salt in equal parts bound 
upon the cut will stop bleeding. 

Physician's Remarks. — Salt is an astringent and therefore contracts the 
blood vessels thus keeping the pj^rt from being congested or over crowded 
with blood. In this way it stops bleeding and also helps to cure inflamed 
«yes. 

9. Black Tea. — Finely powdered black tea bound upon the cut is one of 
the very best remedies used by many surgeons. Where a doctor is not at 
hand many lives would be saved if this remedy were more generally known. 

Physician's Remark. — Tea is an astringent and also has a soothing effect. 

10. Rosin. — Bind some finely powdered rosin upon the cut. This is a 
very effective remedy. 

11. Charcoal. — Take some charcoal made by burning ratjs, put it in the 
wound and the bleeding will stop. If a person be away from home with no 
aid at hand and the cut is severe he should not hesitate t6 burn a handker- 
chief or even a part of his clothing. This treatment should be more gener- 
ally known especially by those who are alone in the woods using axes. 

12. Alum Water. — If the bleeding is from the cavity of an extracted 
tooth pack the part with cotton wet in alum water. 

Physician's Remarks. — Alum is an astringent and contracts the blood 
vessels so that less blood goes to that part. 

13. Cobwebs or Puff Balls. — Either cobwebs or puff balls v/ill stop 
bleeding and should be used if nothing else is at hand though care should be 
taken that they be not mixed with filth of any kind or poisoning might be 
the result. 

14. Wood Ashes. — Wood ashes bound upon the cut will stop bleeding. 
It is also effective for a horse that has been cut in a barbed wire fence. 

15. Brown Sugar. — If the cut is slight bind some brown sugar upon the 
parts or apply wet brown paper. 

16. Sole Leather. — Shave the flesh side of sole leather and bind upon 
the cut. 

17. Gunpowder. — Put some gunpowder on a piece of cotton batting and 
bind upon the cut. 

18. Copperas and Alum. — Styptic powder is composed of one ounce of 
copperas and one ounce of alum. Each article should be pulverized and 
mixed. Put on a shovel, burn to a red heat and then dry to a red mixture. 
Pulverize finely and bottle for use. Sprinkle on the wound in the dry form. 
There is nothing better. 

19. Lamp Oil, — Pour some lamp oil upon the wound.

BONES, BROKEN AND FRACTURED.— (See Chapter on " Bandag- 
ing " which follov/s.) 

BLISTERS AND BLOOD BLISTERS.— 

PEOPLE'S HOME REMEDIES.— 

1. Warm Water. — Bathe the bhstered parts frequently in warm water. 
This is much better than drawing a thread through them as many do. 

2. Tallow. — Make a salve by dropping the tallow from a lighted candle 
into a little gin. Apply this at night before going to bed if the blisters are on 
the hands or feet. 

3. Drilling Nail. — If the finger is bruised causing blood blister under 
the nail it should at once be drilled with some sharp pointed instrument so as 
to let the blood escape. This will give immediate relief while otherwise it 
might become quite painful. 

4. Sweet Oil, Beeswax and Turpentine. — To prevent the forming of a 
blister apply immediately the following salve to the bruised parts. Take 
equal parts of sweet oil, beeswax and turpentine; melt the wax and oil to- 
gether and when pretty cool add the turpentine and stir until cold. Spread 
on a cloth and apply. This is excellent for bruises or scalds. 

5. Poultice of Cabbage Leaves. — An old remedy in use among the 
Romans far blisters was a poultice of cabbage leaves. Put them into warm 
water to soften and apply while warm. This remedy is still used by many 
nurses in our large hospitals. 

Physician's Remark. — Cabbage leaves have a soothing effect somewhat 
like lettuce. 

BRUISES AND SLIGHT CUTS.— Apply arnica freely. Lead water di- 
luted with four parts of water may be applied locally if the skin is not broken. 
Another good application is laudanum, 1 part ; lead water, 4 parts and water, 
16 parts. For severe bruises I always give arnica internally, in 5-drop doses 
every three hours. 

PEOPLE'S HOME REMEDIES.— 

1. Witch Hazel. — Bathe the parts freely with witch hazel. 

2. Arnica. — Take one part tincture of arnica and six parts water. Wet 
a cloth with the liquid and apply over the bruise. 

3. Mullein Leaves. — Fomentations of mullein leaves are excellent for 
bruises and swellings on either man or beast. (Fomentations are explained 
at beginning of Herb Department.) 

4. Cranesbill. — ^An excellent thing for cuts or wounds where the skin 
is rubbed off is cranesbill leaves bruised and applied to the parts. 

5. Rosin.^You will find nothing better for a cut than powdered rosin. 
Put a little on the injured part, wrap with a soft cloth and keep it wet with 
water. 

6. Alum Water. — " Cuts or bruises will quickly heal if bound up with 
a cloth wet with alum, water," writes a lady from Minnesota. 

7. Salt Pork. — If you have stepped on a nail bind a piece of the rind 
of salt pork on the part and keep quiet till it heals. 

Physician's Remark. — First put on a hot bread and milk poultice, change 
frequently and keep on until the wound bleeds well then put on the salt pork. 

8. Hot Water, — A treatment used extensively in hospitals is to dip 



NURSING DEPARTMENT, 25 

pieces of cotton batting into very hot water and apply to cuts, bruises and 
sprains. 

9. Cold Water. — Bathe the bruised parts thoroughly with cold water. 

10. Chloroform Liniment for Bruises. — Mix one ounce of chloroform, 
one ounce of ammonia, one ounce of laudanum and one ounce of sweet oil. 
Bathe the parts well. To be shaken well before using. A lady in Bjethany, 
W. Va. says she has used this chloroform liniment for years and always 
with good results. 

11. Smoking. — Take live coals, burn woolen cloths upon them with a 
small pinch of sugar, hold bruised parts over the smoke. Will take all sore- 
ness away. A lady living at Garrettsville, Ohio, says she has used this many 
times with excellent results. 

13. Sugar and Camphor. — Brown sugar and spirits of camphor tied on, 
or a poultice of comfrey roots, will remove the blueness of a bruise. 

13. Smartweed Poultice. — Steep some smartweed, thicken with wheat 
flour and make into a poultice. A lady living at Independence, Iowa, says 
her husband was very badly bruised in a run-away and that the application 
of this smartweed tea made a new man of him. 

14. Hot Water. — Another lady who speaks from experience says that 
hot water is the best thing that can be used to heal a sprain or bruise. The 
woimded part should be placed in water as hot as can be borne for 15 min- 
utes and in all probability the pain will disappear. Hot water applied by 
means of cloths is a sovereign remedy for neuralgia or pleurisy pains. 

BURNS AND SCALDS.— Lime water with equal parts of either linseed 
oil or olive oil is very good. For small burns washing soda is .good. The ap- 
plication of either cold cream, vaseline or pineoline is also very good. If the 
skin is not broken very much dust on some boric acid powder and then apply 
either vaseline or pineoline. Pineoline is preferable. To make bees-wax oint- 
ment take 6 ounces of benzoated lard, 1 ounce of yellow bees-wax and 20 grains 
of salicylic acid. Melt the wax in a tin cup then add the lard. When all is 
melted remove from the fire and stir till cold. Then add the salicylic acid 
and continue stirring until cold. It makes a varnish over the burned parts 
that excludes the air and sheds moisture. 

PEOPLE'S HOME REMEDIES.— 

i. Wood Soot and Lard. — Apply wood-soot ointment which is made by 
mixing an ounce of finely powdered wood-soot with four ounces of lard. It 
should be spread on cotton batting and applied to burns, scald-head or other 
diseases of the skin. 

Physician's Remark. — ^This acts as a local sedative and quiets pain. 

2. Lime Water and Linseed Oil. — Apply equal parts of lime water and 
linseed oil to the burns or scalded parts and cover with raw cotton. If de- 
sired, one part of carbolic acid may be added to fifty parts of the liquid. 
Lime water alone is good. 

Physician's Remark. — This forms a covering thus keeping the air from 
the burn. 

3. Castile Soap. — A nice application for burns or scalds is castile soap 
scraped and mixed with water till it makes a thick lather. Spread this thickly 
on a piece of lihen or cotton cloth and apply to the burned surface. 



26 ' PEOPLE'S HOME MEDICAL BOOK. 

4. Flour. — Flour sprinkled on the burn or raw cotton spread out thin 
are good applications. 

5. Baking Soda. — A fine thing for burns and scalds is two tablespoon- 
fuls of baking soda dissolved in a pint of water. Wet cotton cloths in this 
solution and apply to the parts. Keep wet and well wrapped up. 

6. Alum Water. — Dissolve two ounces of alum in a pint of water. Sat- 
urate cotton cloths in this alum water and apply to the burn. Keep well 
wrapped up and the pain will soon be relieved and healing commenced. 

?'. Cosmoline. — Dress the burned or scalded parts with cosmoline and 
cover with one thickness of cotton cloth; then, to keep out the air, wrap 
the whole with absorbent cotton. A number of persons write telling of the 
excellent results obtained from the use of this remedy. 

8. White of Egg. — Perhaps the most soothing application for burns or 
scalds is the white of an egg It thoroughly excludes the air and stops the 
smarting pain and is always at hand for immediate use. 

Physician's Remark. — This will be found to be an excellent application 
for burns and scalds. 

9. Alum, Lard and Eggs. — Add a dram of finely powdered alum to a 
teacupful of lard or vaseline and mix thoroughly with the whites of two 
eggs. Spread on a cloth and apply. This is especially valuable where the 
skin has been burned from a large surface. It prevents inflammation and 
gives almost instant relief. 

10. Charcoal. — Finely powdered charcoal is excellent when applied to 
burns. 

11. Scraped Potato. — A poultice of scraped raw potatoes is a fine appli- 
cation for burns or scalds. Powdered charcoal may be mixed with the potato 
with excellent results. 

12. Glycerine or Sweet Oil. — Apply either glycerine or sweet oil. 

13. Alcohol. — For burns from carbolic acid apply alcohol. If apojied 
immediately the acid will not even make the flesh red. 

14. Olive Oil and Camphor Gum. — Take some olive, oil and put in all 
the camphor gum it will cut. Pour a generous quantity upon the affected 
parts and bind up in clean linen. Apply fresh every day. 

15. White of Eggs and Lard. — Beat the white of eggs to a froth and 
then beat in some fresh lard. Apply and bind up with clean linen. 

Physician's Remark. — ^This forms a coating and keeps the air out. 

16. Vaseline and Carbolic Acid. — Apply vaseline plentifully, cover with 
absorbent cotton and then wrap with a cloth. For serious burns bathe twicf 
a day by dipping a clean cloth into warm water with a little carbolic acid in 
it but do not let the cloth touch the bum. Only let the water drip on the 
wound and then apply the vaseline fresh, immediately after the bathing each 
time, until well. It is a sure cure. 

17. Gum Arabic and Carbolic Acid. — Take 1% ounces of gum arable, 4 
or 5 drops of carbolic acid and 1 pint of rain water. Boil the water and put 
the gum arable into it to dissolve and when cold add the carbolic acid. Apply 
to burns and scalds. 

Physician's Remark. — This forms a good coating. The intent in treating 
burns and scalds is to apply something soft to the part to exclude the air. 
Oily, greasy substances are generally good and are generally at hand. Cream, 
vaseline and lard are good. 



NURSING DEPARTMENT. 27 

18. Boracic Acid. — Apply powdered boracic acid dry to the parts. Keep 
the parts dry with it all the time. Just for a small place on the hands 
apply the white of an egg. It will hot- blister and keeps the air away. A 
lady writes that her little girl fell on a stove and burned her face and hands 
terribly. She applied the boracic acid as above and not even a scar was left. 

19. Lard. — Spread lard on a clean cloth and bind on the affected parts. 
The lard must not be salted. This is a simple and good remedy. The lard 
should be spread on quite thick. 

20. Flour and Sweet Oil. — Cover immediately with flour and then put 
on sweet oil and bandage quickly. 

Physician's Remark. — This is a good sensible remedy and is practical 
for you nearly always have it at hand. 

CHOKING. — For choking from a foreign body, such a^ food, slap hard on 
the person's back between the shoulders. If it be a small child and cannot 
otherwise be relieved take hold of the heels and turn it upside down and 
shake a little. Put your finger in the throat, tickle and cause vomiting. Or 
you can take the rubber tube from a syringe after the hard rubber part has 
been taken ofif and put this tube down the throat. This will cause vomiting 
or will push the object down the gullet and allow the person to breathe. Of 
course if the object is in the windpipe you must not push it down. 

PEOPLE'S HOME REMEDIES.— 

1. How to Treat for Choking. — Seize the patient by the heels, hold 
him head downwards and strike sudden blows between tjie shoulders. This 
treatment has saved many a child's life and every mother and nurse should 
remember it in case of emergency where a doctor is not at hand. 

2. Raw Egg. — Break an egg into a cup and let the patient swallow it 
at a gulp. 

3. Blowing into Ear.^A naval surgeon writes that any foreign body 
which is lodged in the throat can be removed by blowing forcibly into the ear. 

4. Pressing on Tongue. — Put the finger far back in the mouth and 
press upon the back part of the tongue to cause vomiting. 

5. Potato or Bread. — Have the patient swallow a large piece of potato 
or bread. 

6. Mustard Water. — Give an emetic such as mustard water. 

CONVULSIONS OR SPASMS.— Keep the child perfectly quiet and put 
ice or cold v/ater cloths on the head. Put feet in hot mustard water and wrap 
entire body in towels which have been dipped in warm mustard water. Use 
two heaping tablespoonfuls of mustard to a quart of warm water. If there 
is undigested food in the child's stomach produce vomiting by tickling the 
throat. Put the handle of a knife or fork in the child's mouth to prevent its 
biting your finger or its own tongue. If there is anything in the bowels give 
a large injection. If the convulsions continue till the face is very pale, the 
pulse weak, the feet and hands cold and the nails and lips blue — then the 
hot bath must be resorted to. Have the water at about 106 degrees or put 
your arm in the water to the elbow. The water should then feel warm but 
not uncomfortable. It is well to add half a cup of mustard to the bath. 
Excepting the head put the child's entire body in the water. To prevent the 
return of the convulsions give the following internally: one-half dram of 
bromide of potash, 15 grains of chloral hydrate and 2 ounces of simple 



28 PEOPLE'S HOME MEDICAL BOOK. 

syrup. Mix and shake thoroughly and give a teaspoonful every hour While 
the child is nervous or feverish. This dose is for a child a year old. 

PEOPLE'S HOME REMEDIES.— 

1. Warm Mustard Water. — If the convulsions are caused by over load- 
ing the stomach, vomiting should be induced by giving warm water or 
tickling the throat. If the convulsions axe slight perhaps all that will be 
found necessary is to put the feet in warm mustard water. In case of severe 
convulsions the following general treatment has saved hundreds of lives. 
First put the child in a warm bath as soon as possible and while in the bath, 
pour a steady stream of cold water upon its head but not from a great height. 
Continue to pour while the head is hot or until the fit has passed. Keep 
the child in the warm bath until the convulsions are over which is generally 
from ten to twenty minutes. When taken from the bath wrap the child 
immediately in a warm woolen blanket without even stopping to wipe him 
off. Sometimes it will be found necessary to inject the bowels with warm 
water to which has been added a tablespoonful- of sweet oil and a little of 
the suds from castile soap. Repeat this till the bowels move. This treat- 
ment is probably the very one your doctor would use were he called and in 
an emergency can be used equally well by the parent. Therefore let this 
treatment be adopted by every mother who values the life of her child. 

Physician's Remark. — This treatment is used by many physicians and 
can be depended vipon. It draws the blood from the head to the extremities 
and establishes a good general circulation. 

2. Salt and Water. — Give a teaspoonful of salt and water and put the 
feet and legs in hot water. 

Physician's Remark. — The salt is to cause vomiting. 

3. Mustard Water. — As soon as the fit comes on dip some cloths into 
hot mustard water and wrap the child's feet and the lower part of the limbs, 
leaving the cloths on until the skin is quite red. 

4. Hot Water and Salt. — The simplest way to bring a child out of a 
spasm is to put its feet into Lot water and force a little salt water into its 
mouth. 

5. General Treatment. — Ice water to head and throat, hot water to 
feet and wrists and as soon as possible put a mustard plaster or poultice to 
the wrists and soles of the feet. Give an injection of warm soap suds and 
also a mild laxative. 

Physician's Remark. — When the head is too hot cold water will contract 
the blood vessels and cause less blood to be carried there. Hot water to 
feet and wrists causes the blood to flow better in the extremities. Mustard 
aids by increasing the circulation of the skin. When the head and face are 
red and congested the aim is to get the blood away from the head and 
increase the circulation in other parts of the body. 

6. Hot Bath.— As quickly as possible put the patient into as hot a 
bath as he can stand. 

7. Salt and Mustard Water. — Teaspoonful of salt put into bath of 
warm mustard water. 

CUTS. — (See " Bruises and Slight Cuts." For severe cuts see " Bleed- 
ing.") 



NURSING DEPARTMENT. 29 

CRAMPS. — Externally apply belladonna liniment. Ginger tea is very 
good for menstrual cramp. 

PEOPLE'S HOME REMEDIES.— 

1. Banda|;ing. — If the cramp occurs in the leg it can frequently be 
relieved by tying a cord around the leg above the cramp. 

2. Drawing up Foot. — To obtain relief from cramps in the calf of the 
'eg draw^ the top of the foot up as closely as possible to the shin and hold 
it there until the cramping has ceased. 

.3. Red Pepper and Whisky. — Apply red pepper and whisky for cramps 
in the neck or leg. 

4. Tansy, Hops or Mustard. — ^Warm fomentations of tansy, hops, or 
mustard will relieve cramps in the stomach. 

5. Various Remedies. — For cramps in the limbs wear eel skin garters. 
For cramps in stomach make a tea of merwine root and drink the same or 
take 30 drops of Jamaica ginger diluted with water. 

6. Rhubarb, Cayenne, Etc. — Take tincture of rhubarb, tincture of cay- 
enne pepper, tincture of opium, spirits of camphor and essence of pepper- 
mint; of each equal parts. For an adult give a teaspoonful at a dose every 
half hour until four doses have been taken. 

7. Hot Applications. — Apply hot applications. 

8. Mustard Poultices. — Apply hot cloths. A mustard poultice is very 
good in some cases. 

DISLOCATIONS.— (See chapter on " Bandaging " following.) 

DIZZINESS OR VERTIGO.— This is often due to stomach, liver or 
bowel troubles and rarely to brain disease. Heart troubles, general weakness 
and poorly fitting glasses are other causes. Vertigo frequently comes from 
biliousness and constipation and is sometimes due to fermenting food in 
the stomach and bowels. It is always a good plan to keep the bowels mov- 
ing regularly one or twice a day. Eat less and do not eat food that disagrees 
with you. Rich, greasy food is not good for persons suffering with vertigo. 
(See " Fainting.") 

DROWNING. — Remove all dirt, saliva, etc., from the mouth and, pulling 
the tongue well forward, hold it there with forceps or by means of a cloth 
passed around it and held by the hand. 

Remove clothing, especially from the upper part of the body. 

Place the patient on his stomach, stand straddle of him and lift him up 
by putting your arms around the middle of his body and let his head hang 
down so the water can run from the lungs out of the mouth. 

Turn the patient on his back and place a roll of clothing under the small 
of his back. Also place something under his shoulders and head. 

Use artificial respiration. Stand or kneel above or at the head of the 
patient, grasp the arms at the elbow and draw them steadily and slowly 
upward above the head and keep them stretched for a couple of seconds. 
Then bring the arms down to the sides again and press them firmly for 
a couple of seconds against the sides of the chest. Repeat these movements 
regularly from fifteen to twenty times a minute and persevere in them for an 
hour or even two hours if necessary. An assistant should press on the lower 
border of the ribs and pit of stomach while the arms are pressed against the 
sides. Rub the limbs while this is being done. Dash hot and cold water alter- 



3d PEOPLE'S HOME MEDICAL BOOK. 

nately upon the chest. If necessary, put in warm bath while artificial respira- 
tion is still continued. 

The clothes must be taken off, the tongue drawn out and the mouth 
cleaned quickly and artificial respiration commenced as soon as possible. 
After breathing has been established put the patient into a warm bed in a 
room which is kept well ventilated. For nourishment and as a stimulant 
inject the bowels with brandy and beef tea. Do not let bystanders crowd 
about the patient and keep the air from him. 

EAR, THINGS IN. — Insects sometimes get into the ear. Pour water as 
hot as it can be borne into the ear and hold it there for a few minutes. 
Then turn the head and let the water run into a basin so that you can see 
whether or not the insect comes out. If foreign bodies are in the ear you 
can use an ear spoon but it must be used gently. A crochet hook or a small 
hair pin properly bent may also be used. Do not use force for the ear is 
very easily injured. If you cannot get the body out easily you should see 
a doctor. 

EPILEPSY.— (See " Fits.") 

EYE, THINGS IN.— If under the lower lid pull the lid down and wipe the 
object off with a smooth cloth. If under the upper lid put the first finger 
of your left hand in the center of the lid about half an inch from the edge 
and take hold of the eye winkers with two fingers of the other hand. Pull 
down and then up over the finger of the left hand thus exposing the inner 
surface of the lid so that the object may be wiped off. The patient should 
look at the end of hia nose while this is being done. A flaxseed placed in the 
eye will frequently push the object from under the lid. Another way is te 
pull the lid down with the fingers and then blow the nose violently. If 
some foreign object like a piece of steel is lodged in the ball of the eye a 
doctor will be required to remove it. 

PEOPLE'S HOME REMEDIES.— 

1. Removing with Pencil. — Roll the lid upward over a lead pencil then 
draw the pencil backward and forward several times. This seldom fails 
to remove the foreign body. 

2. Blowing Nose. — With the thumb and finger keep the eye op^n 
while blowing the nose vigorously. 

3. Flaxseed. — One grain of flaxseed put in the eye. 

4. Treatment For. — Shut the eye and take hold of the upper lid by the 
lashes, roll the eye around and pull the upper lid down over the lower one 
and let go. 

5. Immersing in Water, — To remove dirt from the eye immerse it in 
cold water and while thus immersed roll and wink the eye till the dirt is 
worked out. 

6. Olive Oil. — ^A celebrated eye specialist of Holland says there is 
nothing better to remove specks, dirt or lime from the eyes than to pour 
olive oil into them till all hurtful substances ^re washed out. This, he says, 
is painless and seldom fails. 

7. Camel's Hair Brush. — Cinders and dust may be removed by wetting 
a small camel's hair brush in water then raising the lid and passing the brush 
over the eyeball. 

FAINTING.— Do not get rattled. Place the patient flat on the back; 
loosen clothing; give plenty of air; sprinkle water on the face; put camphor^ 



NURSING DEPARTMENT. 31 

ammonia or smelling salts to the nose ; rub the hands and feet and give 
brandy or whiskey. Generally the head should be placed low. Do not allow 
a crowd to gather and shut oflf the air from the patient. The head and face 
may be bathed with camphor or cool water. Have the patient remain lying 
down until the faint feeling is entirely gone. If the fainting is caused by 
some disease stimulants should be given. 

PEOPLE'S HOME REMEDIES.— 

1. Aromatic Spirits of Ammonia. — Give half a teaspoonful of aromatic 
spirits of ammonia in a wineglassful of water and you will revive the patient. 

2. General Treatment. — Lay the patient upon his back and admit plenty 
of fresh air. The face should be sprinkled with cold water and the arms and 
legs should be rubbed. Hold spirits of ammonia, camphor or vinegar to the 
nostrils. As soon as the patient can swallow give a teaspoonful of compound 
spirits of lavender. 

FALLS. — Immediately after a bad fall do not allow the patient to lie down 
and sleep as there is danger of the blood clotting in the brain and causing 
death. Keep the patient awake. 

PEOPLE'S HOME REMEDIES.— 

1. Salt Water. — To' revive a person who seems stupid from a fall give 
him salt water to drink. Use a teaspoonful of salt to a pint of water. 

FIRE. — (See " Burns and Scalds.") If your clothing is on fire do not 
run, as this will but fan the fire. Throw a garment such as a shawl, rug, over- 
coat or piece of carpet around the body and then lie down and roll. This 
smothers out the flames. Always keep your mouth closed or you will be 
burned internally. Tut soda and sweet oil, linseed oil or some kind of grease 
on the wounds until care can be given them. 

FITS, FALLING FITS OR EPILEPSY.— (For symptoms see General 
Diseases.) Bromide of potassium is the remedy to be used and should be con- 
tinued for months and years and should be kept up for three years after the 
patient is seemingly cured. This should be administered under the super- 
vision of a doctor. 

PEOPLE'S HOME REM:EDIES.— 

1. Oxide of Zinc.: — A physician who has been very successful in cur- 
ing epilepsy uses oxide of zinc. It should be taken three times a day. The 
first eight days the dose is % grain. Then take 1 grain doses for the next 
eight days. Then use 1% grains till cured. The dose seldom has to be in- 
creased over 1% grains. It is well while under this treatment to rub the 
spine twice a day with stramonium ointment. 

FRACTURES.— (See chapter on " Bandaging " which follows.) 
FREEZING, FROST BITES.— 

PEOPLE'S HOME REMEDIES.— 

1. Rubbing with Snow, Witch Hazel, Etc. — If one has been frozen keep 
him away from the fire and thaw out the parts slowly. First rub them with 
snow, then flannel and lastly with the hands, then bathe the parts frequently 
with witch hazel. 

2. Alum Water. — Immerse the frozen parts for ten or fifteen minutes 
in alum water. Use from one-fourth to one-half pound of alum to a gallon 
of water. (See " Chilblains," under " Skin Diseases.") 



33 PEOPLE'S HOME MEDICAL BOOK. 

HEART TROUBLES.— 

Palpitation. — If a person has palpitation after too hearty eating and 
the stomach seems full, it is difficult to breathe, heart goes too hard and fast 
and the patient feels almost suffocated but has no valvular heart disease; 
give a teaspoonful of soda in hot water or peppermint water or hot whiskey 
or brandy. These will relieve the person by causing the gas to come up. 
iThe last two can be used in heart trouble. 

Fast Heart. — If any one afflicted with heart trouble has palpitation, the 
heart beats fast, full and hard and throbs terribly causing hard and labored 
breathing on account of the lungs being pumped so full of blood, do not smell 
o^ camphor, ammonia or nitrite of amyl because they would make the heart 
beat faster still. Such patients are usually sitting or lying propped vtp in 
bed. Give tincture of digitalis, five drops in a little water in a spoon. Put 
this carefully and slowly into the mouth. Give another dose in ten minutes 
and another in half an hour, if necessary, then every three to four hours for 
twelve hours. 

Weak Heart. — If there is a slow heart from overdoing or in asthma, 
grip, etc., have the patient inhale nitrite of amyl, camphor or ammonia and 
give whiskey or brandy and then if you have them give digitalis or strychnia. 
In this condition the patient is unable to sit up ; perhaps lies partly uncon- 
scious ; is faint, weak and collapsed ; perhaps has a cold sweat and the pulse, 
which may be fast or slow, is weak and hardly perceptible. If you have 
nitrite of amyl capsules break one containing three to five minims on a cloth, 
and have the patient inhale it for a few minutes. Or have him inhale camphor 
or ammonia. At the same time give whiskey or brandy and watch the 
effects. Do not over-stimulate. The best, surest and most lasting in its 
effects is the digitalis or strychnia. If the strychnia is used give one dose, 
1/60 of a grain, and in half an hour give another dose but never more 
than two doses. This can be given at the same time with the whiskey, 
brandy or digitalis. Digitalis, with or without one dose of strychnia, in 
such a condition and from the causes mentioned, gives the best and most per- 
manent relief. Give five drops at a dose. If nothing else has been given re- 
peat the dose in ten minutes. If something else like the above or strychnia 
has been given do not repeat the dose in less than an hour and stop the others. 
Repeat again, if necessary, in an hour or two. (See " Diseases of the Heart " 
in regular department.) 

HEAT STROKE OR SUNSTROKE.— (For symptoms, etc., see regular 
department.) The treatment must be bold and vigorous. If the temperature 
is too high it may be reduced by applying ice or cold water. Strip the patient, 
lay him on a canvas cot if one is handy and then direct a stream of cold water 
upon his body. Rub actively and vigorously at the same time. This brings 
the blood to the surface and relieves the internal organs and the head. Rub 
thoroughly and at the same time constantly apply ice or cold water to 
the head. In other cases the patient may be put in a tub and the above di- 
rections followed. When the temperature falls see that it does not fall 
too rapidly. Bleed the patient if he is robust and there is evidence of 
venous engorgement or too much blood in the veins. Then follow with 
normal salt injection. If constipated give citrate of magnesia in 4 dram 
doses. If the patient is unconscious give a hypodermic of 1/6 grain of eJater- 
ium for the bowels. Give strychnine if necessary to stimulate. Give no al- 
cohol and have patient remain in bed several days. 



NURSING DEPARTMENT, 33 

PEOPLE'S HOME REMEDIES.— 

1. Essence of Ginger. — Put the patient in a sitting position* and pour 
cold water freely upon the head. Into half a tumbler of water pour two 
or three teaspoonfuls of essence of ginger and have the patient drink it 
quickly. 

HEMORRHAGE.— (See Bleeding.) 

HICCOUGH. — This is caused by a spasmodic contraction of the dia- 
phragm by which the air is suddenly drawn in. Give a 1 dram dose of tincture 
of musk or give ten drops of chloroform internally. Another remedy is com- 
posed of spirits of camphor, 1 teaspoonful; tincture of capsicum, 3 to 3 
drops; oil of amber, 5 to 10 drops; tincture of valerian, 1 teaspoonful. The 
whole is to be taken at a dose and repeated if necessary. 

PEOPLE'S HOME REMEDIES.— 

1. Nitre. — Drink from 3 to 5 grains of nitre dissolved in half a tumbler 
of water. 

2. Chewing. — Press the fingers tightly into the ears and chew as though 
you were eating food. This is an old and tried remedy. 

3. Vinegar and Sugar. — Drink several swallows of well-sweetened vine- 
gar or eat a lump of sugar that has been thoroughly saturated with vinegar. 

4. Lemon Juice and Sugar. — Drink freely of lemon juice mixed with 
sugar. 

5. Mustard, Ginger or Soda. — Drink frequently of hot water containing 
mustard, ginger or soda. 

6. Drinking Through Towel. — Put a clean towel over a glass of water 
and drink water through the towel. This takes the mind from the hic- 
coughing. 

7. Drinking Water. — Drink nine or ten small swallows of water with- 
out breathing. 

8. Placing Fingers Together. — Without leaning on anything, see how 
nearly together you can keep the ends of the small fingers, being very careful 
never to allow them to touch. This concentrates the mind and seldom fails 
to effect a cure. 

9. Swallowing. — Take a drink of cold water or eat a piece of dry bread 
or something to cause swallowing. 

10. Baking Soda. — Give a half teaspoonful of common baking soda dis- 
solved in a little water. 

11. Startling. — Scare or surprise a person with hiccoughs. Speaking 
suddenly to them often startles them and cures the hiccoughs. Do not 
adopt this method with a person who has heart trouble. 

Physician's Remark. — A number of the above remedies perhaps have 
no real medical value but they concentrate the mind of the patient upon 
something besides the hiccough and thus effect a cure. 

HYDROPHOBIA.— (See this subject under Infectious Diseases.) 
NOSE, BLEEDING FROM.— (Epistaxis.) Usually, bleeding from the 
nose will stop itself. Hold the arms above the head. Apply ice or cold water 
to the nose and to the back of the neck. Inject either hot or cold water 
into the nostrils. Either alum or tannic acid is good when dissolved in 
water or snuffed up the nostrils or applied with a clotli. Hold the nostril 
shut with the finger and apply something cold to the head and neck. Snuff 
salt water. If the bleeding continues the doctor will plug the opening be

tween the nose and the throat or will plug the nostrils with cotton saturated 
with a solution of adrenalin, 1 part to 2000 of water, or with a strong solu- 
tion of cranesbill. 

PEOPLE'S HOME REMEDIES.— 

1. Pressing on Lip. — Press hard on the upper lip near the nose or 
press hard on the under part of jaw near the angle of the jaw bone. 

Physician's Remark. — There is a large artery in the upper lip near the 
nose and another runs up over the jaw bone near the angle. Pressure on 
these parts checks the bleeding from the nose by. shutting off the supply of 
blood. 

2. Pressing on Nose. — Nose bleed can sometimes be stopped by pressure 
on the upper part of the nose as this closes some of the blood vessels. 

3. Dried Beef. — Insert grated dried beef up the nostrils. 
Physician's Remark. — This not only acts as a plug but the salt in the 

dried beef aids in contracting the blood vessels. 

4. Cold Packs. — Apply cold packs to the nose, forehead and to the back 
part of the head and neck. 

Physician's Remark. — Cold contracts the blood vessels in this region 
and lessens the flow of blood to these parts. 

■ 5. Raising Hands. — Hold the hands above the head. 

6. Alum or Salt Water. — Saturate some lint or cotton in alum or salt 
water and insert up the nostrils as far as possible or snuff up some powdered 
alum. 

Physician's Remark. — Salt and alum are astringents and help close the 
blood vessels. 

t. Witch Hazel. — ^Witch hazel bark inserted in the nostrils will stop 
bleeding. 

8. Powdered Borax.' — Snuff some powdered borax up the nose and at 
the same time pour cold water over the wrists and back of the neck. 

9. Nettle Juice. — ^Juice from the common nettle has stopped nose bleed 
when everything else failed. Wet some lint in the juice and put up the 
nostril. 

10. Ice Water or Vinegar. — Snuff either ice water or vinegar. Apply ice 
or cold water to the back of the neck or bridge of the nose. 

Physician's Remark. — The cold contracts the blood vessels and less 
blood is carried to these parts. Vinegar also contracts the blood vessels 
by its astringent or binding action and lessens the flow of blood, allowing it to 
clot by becoming coagulated or thickened. 

11. Closing Nostril. — Press the nostril shut for several minutes and 
allow the blood to clot. 

12. Fat Bacon. — Insert in the nostril a narrow strip of salty fat bacon 
about three inches long. Also hold ice in the mouth. 

Physician's Remark. — The salt is astringent and aids in closing the blood 
vessels. The ice contracts the blood vessels in this region. 

13. Holding Nose. — Hold the nose between the thumb and finger until 
the blood clots then expel the breath easily through the nose. 

14. Paper. — Chew some paper to a wad and press it firmly under the 
upper lip or use the index finger instead. 

Physician's Remark. — This presses on the artery in the upper lip and 
lessens the flow of blood. ^ 

NOSE, THINGS IN. — If a bean, grain of corn or wheat or any other for- 



NURSING DEPARTMENT. 35 

eign body gets into the nostril take a crochet hook and gently run it back be- 
hind the object and slowly and carefully draw it out. A hair pin properly bent 
may be used if preferred. Some times the object may be expelled by blow- 
ing the nose. Do everything gently. Seait the patient in a good light, open 
wide the nostril and put your instrument in or behind the object and draw 
forward. Do not be alarmed for if you cannot get it out any doctor can do 
so and in the meantime there is no danger. 

POISONING.— (See chapter on " Poisons.") 

SORES. — Apply camphor and cream either alone or together. White 
vaseline is good. For old and foul smelling sores apply finely powdered char- 
coal. Charcoal is a disinfectant. A good wash is madp by putting a teaspoon- 
ful (60 grains) of potassium permanganate into a pint of water. Zinc oxide 
ointment is another good application. For freely running sores use powdered 
white oak bark as a poultice. 

PEOPLE'S HOME REMEDIES.— ' 

1. Hot Water. — Dip pieces of cotton into very hot water and apply to 
old sores. This is an effective remedy used in many hospitals. 

2. Scraped Potato and Charcoal. — For old ill-conditioned sores apply 
equal parts of scraped raw potato and powdered charcoal. This is a very 
fine application for sores of this kind. 

SPASMS.— (See " Convulsions.") 

SPRAINS OR STRAINS, SPRAINED BACK, ETC.— Apply cloths . 
wrung out of hot salt water or use wormwood or smartweed tea either with or 
without arnica. Soap liniment, a soap plaster or soft soap are good applica- 
tions. Apply opodildoc liniment. Canada pitch plaster is another good rem- 
edy. Later paint the parts over with balsam of fir and bind with eel skin. 
Turpentine liniment is excellent but you must not use it too long for it is hard 
on the kidneys. See some of the good liniments given in another part. 

For a sprained ankle or arm bathe for a long time with either cold or 
hot water as it feels best. Between the bathings dress the parts with lead 
water and laudanum, using 16 parts of water, 4 parts of undiluted lead water 
and 1 part of laudanum; then rub with ichthyol ointment or camphor lini- 
ment and laudanum. 

PEOPLE'S HOME REMEDIES.— 

1. Egg, Salt and Honey. — Take the white of an egg, a large spoonful 
of salt and the same amount of honeys beat them together continually for 
two hours ; let stand an hour and then anoint the sprained parts with the oil 
which comes from the mixture. A man from Montana writes that he had 
a very badly sprained ankle but within twenty-four hours after using this 
application he walked without the least sign of pain. 

2. Clay and Vinegar. — In case of a sprain or bruise tnake a paste of 
one part of blue clay and two parts of vinegar and bind on with a wet towel 
at night. 

3. Rosin and Butter. — Make a paste with some powdered rosin and 
fresh butter and bind on the parts. 

4. Hot Water. — Pour hot water from a height of three feet upon the 
sprained parts. A man writes that a strained ankle was cured by continuing 
this treatment for an hour. 

5. Alum and Egg. — Powder a piece of alum the size of a hickory nut

and stir into the white of an egg until it forms a curd. Wet a piece of cloth 
in this and apply to the sprained parts. 

SUNSTROKE.— (See "Heat Stroke.") 

SMOTHERING.— (See "Asphyxia.") 

STINGS.— (See " Bites and Stings.") 

SHOCK.— (See " Apoplexy.") 

WOUNDS.— (Also see " Bleeding.")— Use hot, clean, boiled water to 
thoroughly cleanse the wound. If any large blood vessels are torn they must 
be tied with something until the doctor comes. One can generally stop 
bleeding by the application of very hot or cold water or by twisting the blood 
vessels or by tying something tight about the limb. Wash the wound clean 
from dirt and all other foreign matter then dress it with gauze or linen. An 
antiseptic like listerine or glycothymoline should be used if possible to 
thoroughly cleanse the wound and some of it should be put upon the dressing. 
Nail wounds are treated under "Blood Poisoning." 
PEOPLE'S HOME REMEDIES.— 

1. White Oah Bark Tea. — Cleanse the wound thoroughly with a tea 
made from white oak bark. 

2. Salt Water. — Bathe the wound with weak salt water made with 
boiled water. 

3. Peach Leaves. — Peach leaves pounded to a pulp and applied to a 
bruise or wound from a rusty nail will give immediate relief. 



BANDAGING. 
For Fractures, Broken Bones, Dislocations, etc. 

Splints. — ^These may be made of pasteboard, shingles or light boards. 
They are used to help hold the parts in place and the 'bandages are wrapped 
about them. 

Padding. — Cotton batting, soft linen or anything clean and soft may be 
used. Some places, like hollows and where there is likely to be pressure, 
must be padded more than others but the padding must be done evenly. 

Bandages. — Bandages may be bought or made from old sheets. They 
should be from 3 to 10 yards long and from 1 to 5 inches wide. For fingers 
and toes they should be an inch wide ; for jaw, 4 inches ; for head, 2 inches : 
for collar bone, leg or arm, from 2 to 3% inches. Wrap them tightly in a 
roll and keep for emergencies. Bandages and padding should be perfectly 
clean. 

General Instructions as to Bandaging. — After the broken parts have been 
replaced the intent of bandaging is to keep the parts in place so as to give 
nature a chance to form new bone tissue and re-unite the bone. For this 
purpose, splints, padding and bandages are used. Bind tight enough to keep 
the bones in place but not so tight as to shut off the circulation or you may 
produce gangrene. Use enough padding to relieve the pressure from the 
splints. The parts should be padded so as to make them even. The result 
will not depend entirely upon the setting of the bone. The patient must do 
nothing either by working or moving that will displace the bone. A great 
many people are left deformed because fractures have been improperly set 








HOSPITAL METHODS OF BANDAGING. 
(See Chapter on "Bandaging.") 



NURSING DEPARTMENT. 37 

Very few laymen can set them properly. Never set a bone permanently unless 
it is impossible to get a physician. We will give both temporary and perma- 
nent treatment. If, after setting the bone, the part swells much and the 
patient complains of much pain, especially in a simple fracture, partly take 
off the bandage until the patient feels easier and then apply again. For in- 
stance, if the patient has a broken elbow and wrist, when you loosen the 
bandage have one person hold the hand and another the elbow to keep the 
parts in place. 

Do not bandage too tightly. You must allow for swelling. A common 
simple break should not pain much after it has been dressed half an hour. 
Put the bandage on just tight enough to keep the parts from slipping. 

Wounds. — If the bone comes through the flesh, the flesh and bone must 
be thoroughly cleansed and the part must be bandaged so that you can get 
at it easily afterwards to dress it. You can miss the wound with the bandage 
and cover with gauze or linen that can be removed. Never put the splint 
on the wound. If the bone is badly crushed it must not be put in a splint. 
Place it in a comfortable position and treat for a time like you would treat 
a wound. 

Fractures. — A fracture is a breaking of the bone either partly or entirely 
in two. In children whose bones are soft we sometimes find the bones bent 
instead of broken. This is called " green stick' fracture." Put on pasteboard 
or light shingle splints, pad well with cotton and bandage. By gradually 
tightening the bandages you can straighten the bone. 

Fractures are simple, compound, comminuted and impacted. Simple frac- 
ture means that the bone is broken partly or entirely off with no tearing of 
the flesh. A compound fracture is where the bone is broken and sticks 
through the flesh. A comminuted fracture is where the bone is broken into 
pieces or crushed. An impacted fracture is where one end of the bone is 
driven into the other. This often happens where there is a fracture of the 
hip or neck of the thigh bone. For practical purposes these are all the kinds 
of fractures it is necessary to mention. 

Fracture of the Arm Bone (Humerus) Between the Elbow and Shoulder. 
— While one holds the shoulder another holds the elbow and pulls on it to 
get the bone into place. When in place the arm will feel even with no de- 
formity and there will be very little pain. With cotton batting pad the arm 
from the elbow to the shoulder. Do this evenly and thoroughly, having the 
cotton about an inch thick. To the back side of the arm apply a strip of 
thick pasteboard and allow it to extend a little below the elbow. In front 
apply another piece beginning a little above the elbow, to allow movement, 
and extending to the shoulder. The two pieces of pasteboard should be wide 
enough to meet on the sides of the arm. Take a bandage five yards long 
and two and a half inches wide and begin at the elbow and wrap upward 
allowing the bandage to lap from % to % of an inch each time. When you 
bring the bandage in front, and again when you bring it behind the arm twist or 
turn it inside out so that it will neither slip up nor down. Do this each time you 
bring the bandage in front and behind the arm. Wrap comfortably tight but 
not too tight. It should be loose enough so that the patient can move the 
arm with little pain by taking hold of the forearm with the other hand. While 
the bandage is being put on, the shoulder, elbow and hand must be held by 
two or three parties. After the arm is bandaged the bandage at both ends 
may be cut lengthwise far enough to permit tying. 



38 PEOPLE'S HOME MEDICAL BOOK. 

Fracture of Bones of Forearm. — As to the use of splints use the same 
method as for the bone from the elbow to the shoulder for temporary use. 
If the bones are broken near the wrist it is called " colles fracture." This 
kind of a fracture is very hard to treat for there is likely to be a dislocation 
of the outer bone at the wrist. One person should take hold of the elbow 
while another pulls at the hand until the bones slip into place. Then a third 
person pads the arm well with cotton while the two are still pulling. Put on 
pasteboard or light shingle spliiits. The lower one should extend from the 
elbow to beyond the ends of the fingers and should be well padded. The 
upper one should extend from below the elbow to the back of the hand and 
should also be well padded. Then when placed in position and held by other 
parties, bandage from the hand to the elbow just tight enough to hold the 
splints in place. Bandage the same as directed for the fracture of the arm 
above the elbow. The arm swells rapidly and if it pains much or the fingers 
become numb and blue it is generally because the bandage is too tight. 
Loosen the bandage a little and this will ease the patient until you can get 
proper help. 

Fracture of the Collar Bone. (Clavicle.) — When the collar bone is broken 
there is pain at the injured place or shoulder, the shoulder hangs down and 
the patient leans to the injured side. For temporary treatment put a pad 
under the injured arm and put the hand and arm to the elbow in a sling tied 
about the neck. If you are where you cannot get a sling hold the injure4 
arm and shoulder up and back until a sling is obtained or go to bed and 
arrange the shoulder and arm in a comfortable position until help can be 
obtained. For permanent treatment replace the parts by lifting the shoulder 
upward, backward and outward. Do this after you have your bandage and 
pads ready. The collar bone will look and feel even when in place. 

Velpeau Method of Bandaging. — We will first give the Velpeau method 
of bandaging. Place the palm of the hand of the injured arm on the opposite 
shoulder with the forearm lying across the chest. Place padding between 
the chest and arm and hand and also in the arm pit on the injured side. This 
is to prevent chafing. Use a bandage ten yards long and 2% inches wide. 
Place the end of the bandage in the arm pit of the sound arm ; pass it up across 
the back over the shoulder and broken collar bone, down the front of the 
arm on the injured side then across the arm and under the outside of the 
elbow; then pass it up across the chest to the place of beginning under 
the sound arm. Repeat the same way but when you get to the sound arm pit 
the second time pass the bandage across the back, but instead of going over the 
shoulder as before, pass it around the injured arm at the elbow and then 
across the chest to the sound arm pit again. Then go across the back and 
up over the shoulder and broken collar bone as the first two times and when 
you get to the sound arm pit go around the body as the third time, lapping 
from one half to one inch; then alternate each time you pass it around the 
body until you have used all the bandage. Use safety pins where necessary. 

Desault Method of Bandaging. — In usin^ the Desault method you use 
the same kind of bandage. Place the arm in the same position as when 
bandaging by the Velpeau method and pad in the same way. Start from the 
arm pit on the sound side; pass the bandage across the chest and up over 
the injured collar bone and shoulder and down the back of the arm to the 
elbow; then pass it across the arm and chest to the point of beginning 
under the arm on the sound side; then across the back and up over the 



NURSING DEPARTMENT. 39 

shoulder and injured collar bone and down the front of the bent arm to the 
elbow ; and from this point across the back -to the point of beginning. Repeat 
these operations, alternating each time, until' the bandage is all used. Pin 
the bandage where necessary and place the hand in a sling. 

Fracture of the Hip. — Place the patient in bed and put bags of salt, sand 
or bran both on the inner and outer side of the thigh, knee and ankle and 
keep there until a doctor arrives. The leg may be short and turn either in 
or out and the bags will help keep it in place and ease the pain. If a doctor 
cannot be obtained, pad the leg well from the hip to the foot and bind on 
with strings or strips of cloth. Turn the foot out as it naturally belongs then 
take a bed slat or strip of board and put on the outer side of the leg. Pad 
the leg well where it touches this splint. The slat should extend from the 
waist to one or two inches below the foot and there should be a notch cut 
in the upper end to keep the bandage from slipping off. Wrap pieces of 
bandage about the limb and slat just above the ankle and the knee and tie 
there. Also bandage the vtpper end of the splint well around the body. The 
splint will now stay in place. Take a bandage 3 or 3 inches wide and begin 
to bandage at the ankle and proceed as directed in bandaging the arm above 
the elbow giving the bandage a twist or turning it inside out occasionally 
both behind and in front to prevent its slipping. Bandage the entire length 
of the limb then put a weight of from five to ten pounds on the lower part 
of the leg so as to prevent shortening. Fasten a rope to the lower part of 
the leg by bandaging or by use of adhesive plaster. Let the rope run through 
a pulley fastened to the foot of the bed and then tie the rope to the weight. 

Fracture of the Thigh Bone. — Be sure the parts are put in place and then 
bandage the same as for a fractured hip. You must also use the weight and 
even then the limb is likely to shorten from half an inch to two inches. 

The temporary treatment, of course, is to put the patient to bed and 
place the leg in a comfortable position. If the patient must be moved, place 
him in a wagon and let him lie down on something soft. Get two shingles 
or boards, pad the leg well and place one splint on the inner and the other 
on the outer side of the thigh or whole leg and then bandage from below 
upward. This will also do for fracture of either one or both bones of the 
leg from the knee to the foot. > 

Fracture of the Ribs. — Apply adhesive plaster from the backbone to the 
breastbone. Apply the plaster wide enough to extend two inches above and 
two inches below the fracture. First measure the length from the backbone 
to the breastbone. Cut enough pieces of plaster to make the right length and 
width. Then place one length on the table and apply another over the side 
of the first one, lapping from % to % an inch, and so continue until you have 
the barid wide enough. It is best to shave off all the hair where the plaster 
is applied. While the patient stands up with his arms down and gets all 
the breath out of his lungs, place one end of the bandage on the backbone, 
then go forward quickly across the .chest to the breastbone with the plaster 
drawn tight and even. Place a strip at each end of the band to prevent 
its slipping. This band, if properly applied, will ease the pain and should 
be worn for at least four weeks. 

Fracture of the Lower Jaw. — ^Use the four-tailed bandage which is made 
by taking a piece of muslin a yard long and four inches wide and cutting it 
through the middle from both ends to within 5 or 6 inches of the center. 
After the broken jaw is in position put the uncut part of the bandage under 



40 PEOPLE'S HOME MEDICAL BOOK. 

the chin so as to cover it. Take hold of the two upper pieces and tie comfort- 
ably tight at the back of the neck. Turn the two lower pieces up along the 
face in front of the ears and tie tightly on the top of the head. Then tie the 
ends on the nape of the neck and the top of the head together. Keep the 
bandage on for a week and for nourishment take milk through a tube or 
straw. Remain quiet and do not talk. 

Another way to bandage a fractured jaw is by the use of a bandage 2^ 
inches wide and 5 yards long. Start at the base of the skull and go up around 
the head on the right side to the top of the head, down in front of the left ear, 
through under the chin, up the right side of the face in front of the ear and over 
the head to the starting point and fasten with a small safety pin. Then go on 
around the right side of the neck, under the right ear to the jaw and chin, 
over the front of the chin and back under the left ear to the starting place 
and again use a small safety pin. Make the first round again and then the 
second, alternating until the bandage is all used. Always pin behind and 
when you are through pin on the top of the head. 

Fracture of the Fingers- — ^Use a rolled bandage of suitable size and close 
the fingers over it and then bind them with strips of adhesive plaster run- 
ning across the fingers or you can use a rolled bandage to bind about the 
fingers and hand. Another way is to put a well padded splint in the palm 
allowing it to extend beyond the ends of the fingers. Bind the fingers over 
this splint just tight enough to hold them to it. Do not bandage too tightly. 

Fracture of the Nose. — You can tell the nose is broken by the deformity 
and by feeling of it. Mold the parts into place with your fingers and fasten 
with adhesive plaster. If you are careful you can pad a goose quill at the- 
end, insert it into the nostril, mold the break into place over the quill, apply 
the adhesive plaster and then remove the quill. The nose mends quickly so 
it had better be attended to as soon as possible after breaking or you may 
have a crooked nose. It is generally safe to put the parts into place with 
the fingers and put adhesive plaster over the break to keep it in place. Unless 
the skin is broken you need no other dressing. The broken nose usually re- 
tains its position well after being set and adhesive plaster applied. 

Dislocation of the Shoulder. — When dislocated the shoulder is deformed 
and the outside looks hollow. Grasp the arm below the elbow with one 
hand and gently carry it well out from the side. Place the other hand on 
the shoulder and press with the thumb upon the head of the dislocated bdne 
which has usually slipped into the arm pit. Next, firmly extend the arm and 
at the same time make it describe a half circle towards the breastbone and 
while doing this press the head of the dislocated bone toward the socket. 
Then bring the arm to the side. Do not use much force. Sometimes yoii 
will need to give something to put the patient to sleep. 

Dislocation of the Jaw.— Put something such as corks far back between 
the teeth on both sides of the jaw. Place your thumbs on the teeth of each 
side with your fingers under the jaw. Press downward and backward and 
with your fingers lift up on the chin. Instead of using corks you can wrap 
your thumbs thickly with a towel to protect them from being bitten when the 
jaws snap together. Press the thumbs hard on the back teeth and lift the 
chin up at the same time. 

Dislocation of the Fingers and Toes,— If dislocated, grasp the fingers oi 
toes in front with one hand and pull forward and downward while at the same 
time pressing upon the dislocated part with the other hand. If it is a back- 



NURSING DEPARTMENT. 41 

ward dislocation, pull forward and upward with one hand while pressing 
upon the dislocated part with the other. 



FOODS FOR THE SICK AND HOW TO PREPARE THEM. 

" Dishes for invalids should be served in your daintiest china and only a 
small quantity should be served at a time." 

Beef Tea by the Cold Process. — Take a pound of finely chopped round 
steak, a coffee cup full of cold water and a pinch of salt. Place in a covered 
jar and set in a cold place for 5 or 6 hours ot over night. It is well to shake 
occasionally. Strain and squeeze out all the juice by placing the meat in a 
coarse muslin cloth and twisting very hard. This beef juice is very nutri- 
tious and better than the extracts of beef which are sold in the stores. 

Beef Juice from Broiled Steak. — Take a pound of round steak with no fat 
on it, cut thick, broil slightly and press the juice out with a lemon squeezer 
or a meat press. You generally get from two to four ounces of juice from 
a pound of beef. This, seasoned with salt, may be given cold or it may be 
warmed by placing the cup which holds it into warm water. It should not 
be heated enough to coagulate the albumen which is in solution and which 
then appears as flakes of meat floating in the fluid. 

Mutton Broth. — Take a pound of finely chopped lean mutton, including 
some of the bone, one pint of water and a pinch of salt. Cook for three hours 
over a slow fire adding water if necessary to make half a pint; then strain 
through a muslin cloth. When cold, carefully remove the fat adding more 
salt if necessary. A very nutritious and delicious broth is made from this 
by adding corn starch or arrowroot, cooking for ten minutes, and then add- 
ing three ounces of milk or lYz ounces of cream to each half pint of broth. 

Chicken, Veal and Beef Broths. — These are made in the same manner as 
mutton broth and used in the same way. 

Meat Pulp. — A rare piece of round or sirloin steak, the outer part having 
been cut away, is scraped or shredded with a knife and is then well salted. 
From a teaspoonful to a tablespoonful may be given to a child 18 months old. 

Junkets or Curds and Whey. — ^Take a pint of fresh cow's milk, warmed, 
a pinch of salt and a teaspoonful of granulated sugar; add two teaspoonfuls 
of essence of pepsin,, or liquid rennet, or one junkfet tablet dissolved in water ; 
stir for a moment and then allow it to stand at the temperature of the room 
for twenty minutes, or until firmly coagulated; set in the ice box or a cool 
place until thoroughly cold. For older children this may be seasoned with 
grated nutmeg. 

Whey. — The coagulated milk, prepared as above, is broken up with a fork 
and the whey strained off through muslin. It is best given cold. If some 
stimulant is desired, sherry wine in the proportion of one part to twelve, or 
brandy one part to twenty-four, may be added. This whey is useful in many 
cases of indigestion. 

Barley Jelly from the Grains. — Take three tablespoonfuls of pearl barley, 
soak over night and then place this in one quart of fresh water; add a pinch 
of salt and boil in a double boiler steadily for four hours or down to one 
pint, adding water from time to time ; strain through muslin. When cold this 



42 PEOPLE'S HOME MEDICAL BOOK. 

makes a rather thick jelly. If a thinner gruel or barley water is wanted one 
half the quantity of barley should be used. 

Oat, Wheat or Rice Jelly. — These are prepared from oatmeal, wheaten 
grits or rice grains in the same manner as the barley jelly. 

Barley Jelly from the Flour. — Either Robinson's patent barky or pre- 
pared barley flour of the Health Food Company may be used. One rounded 
tablespoonful of the flour, thoroughly blended with a little cold water, is 
added, while stirring, to one pint of boiling water containing a pinch of salt. 
Cook for twenty minutes in a double boiler and strain. This makesa jelly 
of about the consistency of that above which is made from the grains. A 
thinner gruel or barley water is made by using half the quantity of flour. It 
is much less trouble to prepare this and it is essentially the same as that 
above. When this is to be mixed with milk it is well to add the milk to 
the barley gruel before removing from the fire and stir two or three minutes 
or until the milk has nearly reached the boiling point. It should then be 
removed and bottled. 

Oat or Wheat Jelly from the Flour. — These are made from the prepared 
oat flour of the Health Food Company or Hubbell's prepared wheat flour. 
They are made and used like barley. 

Imperial Granum. — This is prepared and used in precisely the same way 
as the barley flour above; the gruel being mixed with milk before it is re- 
moved from the fire. 

Albumen Water. — Put the white of one egg into half a glass of water J 
stir slowly for about five minutes without getting it frothy and strain through 
cheese cloth. If necessary, sweeten and flavor to suit the child. Another 
way is to take the white of one fresh egg, one half pint of cold water, a pinch 
of salt and a teaspoonful of brandy. Shake thoroughly and feed cold either 
with a spoon or from a bottle. This is useful in cases of vomiting and can 
sometimes be retained by a very irritable stomach. 

Dried Bread. — This may be used either fresh or stale. Cut into thin 
slices and place in the oven with the door open and quickly dry until it is 
crisp but not browned. For children this is better than crackers. 

Coddled Egg. — A fresh egg with the shell on is placed in boiling water 
which is immediately afterwards removed from the fire. The egg should 
cook slowly in the water for seven or eight minutes when the white should 
be about the consistency of jelly. Add salt and for a delicate stomach give 
the white only. 

Lime Water. — Take a heaping teaspoonful of slaked lime and a quart of 
bottled or distilled water; place in a corked bottle and shake thoroughly two 
or three times during the first hour ; then allow the lime to settle for twenty^ 
four hours. Carefully pour off and use the clear fluid. From a teaspoonfuJ 
to a tablespoonful may be given at a feeding. 

Gluten Water. — Gluten water is made from any grain, preferably barley 
or rice, by boiling from four to six tablespoonfuls of the whole grain in a 
quart of water for an hour. It should then measure one pint and be strained. 
This is very easily digested and very strengthening. 

Oatmeal Water. — ^Take a tablespoonful of oatmeal or two tablespoonfuls 
of rolled oats and boil for three hours in a quart of water, adding boiling- 
water to have a pint when done. For feeding to infants this should be 
strained and added to the milk. 

Barley Water. — Add a tablespoonful of pearl barley to a quart of water 



NURSING DEPARTMENT. 43 

like the oatmeal water above. Strain and use as a substitute for oatmeal 
water when the bowels are loose. 

Rice Water. — Add a tablespoonful of rice to a quart of water and cook 
for three hours as directed for oatmeal water. When strained this is a good 
substitute for milk in cholera infantum or it may be added to the milk for 
feeding infants. 

Arrowroot Water. — Pour a little cold water on a teaspoonful of arrow- 
root and rub until pasty; add a pint of boiling water and boil from five to 
ten minutes, stirring constantly. This is often added to milk mixtures to 
break the rolled curd forming in a child's stomach. It should be strained. 

Toast Water.-^Two slices of dark brown toast should be added to a 
quart of boiling water. When cool use it for sick stomach or as a drink 
when thirsty. 

Egg and Barley Water. — To the white of one egg add eight ounces of 
barley water and one and one-half teaspoonfuls of white sugar. This is 
good for a child recovering from a sickness when milk is not successful. 
Rice water may be substituted for the barley water if preferred. 

Flaxseed Tea. — Add a tablespoonful of flaxseed to a pint of boiling 
water; let simmer for an hour; then strain, sweeten and flavor with lemon 
juice to suit the taste. 

Cream and Rice Mixture. — ^Take cream, 3 tablespoonfuls ; rice water, 4 
tablespoonfuls ; boiled lime water, 2 tablespoonfuls and sugar, 1 tablespoon- 
ful. Give every two hours but do not feed enough to cause vomiting. If 
the bowels are loose or show curds in the stools, decrease the amount of 
cream. Increase the cream when constipated. Increase the proportion of rice 
water as long as there are regular daily stools. Rice produces constipation 
when fed too freely. 

Hard Boiled Eggs. — Eggs boiled for a few minutes only are generally 
tough and not very easily disgested but if they be boiled for an hour they 
become tender and mealy and are easily digested. If the stomach is in very 
bad condition give only the whites at first then later the yolks also may be 
given. 

THE PREVENTION OF DISEASE. 

We are a very careless people in many ways. We travel at a furious gait 
and we are reckless of the certain results. A great many ills and diseases 
can be avoided. Suppose one is very warm, thirsty and sweating. How 
many in such a condition will pour ice water into their stomachs and produce 
gastritis which is inflammation of the stomach! Or, perhaps a severe chill 
is the result. How many in this condition sit down in a draught and check 
the perspiration and thus take cold and get sore throat, pneumonia, bron- 
chitis, catarrh, neuralgia or rheumatism ! How many will get their clothes or 
' their shoes and stockings wet and never change them and dry the wet parts ! 
How many girls get wet stockings and skirts and sit in them at school for 
hours even when they are " unwell " and then wonder why they have painful 
menstruations! How many will dance themselves into a perspiration and 
then sit in a cool place and cool off suddenly and wonder why they have 
coughs, headaches, neuralgia and are sickly in general. Nasal catarrh, chronic 
sore throat, laryngitis and consumption flourish on such errors. 

How many people will drink the strongest kinds of teas and coffees, live 



44 PEOPLE'S HOME MEDICAL BOOK.' 

on them for breakfast, and then wonder why their stomach and nerves are 
bad, their bowels constipated and livers torpid ! How many will continually 
eat ham, pork, sausage, rich pies and cakes, greasy gravies, warm pancakes 
and perhaps top off with tea or coffee or wines and liquors and then continue 
living a sedentary life and wonder why their stomachs give out and they 
have indigestion and dyspepsia! You cannot disobey the laws of health and 
remain well. I have frequently seen mothers give a ten months old baby 
rich cookies, candies and maple syrup and even peanuts. I once attended a 
year old child for convulsions. I found it had eaten peanuts for its evening 
meal. When I " got up " the peanuts the convulsions ceased. I have seen 
children eat green apples and die within a short time with dysentery or 
cholera infantum. The minister and parents mourned over the mysterious 
dispensation of Providence in taking their dearly beloved little ones. It was 
not Providence — it was Green Apples. I once knew a two year old child who 
died from eating a blackish, over-ripe banana. We reap what we sow 
whether we sow intentionally or otherwise. 

How can you escape rheumatism if you live in a cold, damp, musty house 
which is closed against sunlight! Man made houses but God made the out- 
doors with the air and the sunlight. 

And then as regards venereal diseases. These cannot be contracted with- 
out giving full payment. They are very difficult to cure. in the chronic state. 
A few years ago in this city I saw a young man of good family who was then 
dying with inflammation of the kidneys caused by a venereal disease which 
had gone to the bladder and then affected the kidneys. And the man is not 
the only one to suffer. Years afterwards, when he thinks he is cured he may 
find that such is not the case and that he has infected his wife. The major- 
ity of cases of diseased ovaries and tubes that come to our public hospitals 
is caused by a latent venereal disease in the husband. 

All these diseases could be prevented and preventive treatment is the 
only sure treatment. Teach your children how to live if you wish them to be

DISEASES. 
CAUSES, SYMPTOMS AND TREATMENTS. 



INFECTIOUS AND CONTAGIOUS DISEASES. 

DIPHTHERIA. 

DESCRIPTION. — This is. an acute infectious 'disease usually affecting 
children under fifteen years of age or before puberty. It is an acute inflam- 
mation sometimes affecting the mucous membrane of the entire throat 
including the nostrils, pharynx or back part of the throat, larynx, palate and 
even the nasal or nose passages. The disease is attended with a false mem- 
brane which develops in the mouth, throat, nose and larynx. 

CAUSES. — It is caused by a germ called the Klebs-LoefHer bacillus be- 
cause these men first discovered these germs. The disease is taken by coming 
in contact with or near those having it. 

SYMPTOMS. — Diphtheria is from two to seven days in coming on. The 
patient has a sense of weariness, chilliness and fever. The severity of these 
symptoms varies greatly in different cases. Sometimes they are so mild 
that the child does not seem to be ailing at all and the parent is much sur- 
prised upon looking into the mouth on the second day to find a grayish spot 
or membrane on the tonsils, soft palate, uvula or in the throat. In other 
cases the disease comes on suddenly from the start. In nearly every case 
there is some complaint of sore throat or of difficulty in swallowing. The 
back part of the throat is red or inflamed and upon one or both tonsils is seen 
a tiny grayish patch which is the beginning of the membrane of either 
tonsilitis or diphtheria. If it is tonsilitis it will appear on the tonsils only 
and when the membrane is removed a smooth glistening surface remains 
while if it be diphtheria the membrane will quickly spread to other parts of 
the throat and perhaps to the nose passages. In diphtheria the membrane is 
of a grayish or light mouse color and in many cases becomes shaggy and 
dirty looking. In attempting to remove it you find that it sticks closely to 
the lining of the throat. It can be removed only by tearing it loose so that 
a raw bleeding surface is left over which another membrane quickly forms. 
In this way you may distinguish between tonsilitis and diphtheria. There 
is nearly always some enlargement of the glands or kernels under the jaws. 
Frequently the membrane extends into the nostrils and there is then an 
acrid or burning discharge from the nose. This kind of diphtheria is very 
dangerous and most frequently affects infants or very young children. 

Laryngeal Diphtheria or Diphtheria of the Larynx ; Also Formerly Called 
Membranous or True Croup. — A membrane forms which causes very difficult 
breathing which is attended by hoarseness when speaking or crying and a 
harsh cough with a metallic sound. Following these symptoms it is noted 
that there is a light whistling sound when the breath is drawn in and this 
whistling is increased at times by what seems to be a spasm of the larynx or 

46

upper part of the windpipe., This is followed by constant whistling, harsh 
breathing, much restlessness and anxious breathing. The child may grasp 
the throat with its hands and as it becomes bluish it often grinds its teeth 
and looks piteously from side to side for relief. Its pallid face may be covered 
with sweat and altogether it is a painful sight to witness. As the disease 
advances the child becomes more and more limp and struggles less and less 
for breath and unless relief is quickly obtained suffocation will be the result. 
Sometimes in the older children some of the false membrane is thrown out 
and in some instances they throw out large pieces showing the entire form 
of the larynx or upper part of windpipe. 
TREATMENT.— 

Preventive, — As soon as a white or grayish spot shows in the throat or 
on the tonsils of one having sore throat that person should immediately be 
placed in a room by himself and others kept away. If it proves to be diph- 
theria other children who have been with the patient should at once be given 
preventive doses, of antitoxin by a physician. The furniture of the sick room, 
such as carpets and curtains, should be removed and only necessary articles 
such as bedding and clothing should be retained. After removing the carpets, 
curtains, etc., they should be put into a solution of corrosive sublimate of 
the strength of from 1 to 1,000 to 1 to 5,000. This can be bought in tablet 
form of any desired strength at any drug store ; or, use 5 pet. carbolic solution. 

After being disinfected these things should be boiled and dried in the__ 
sun. The room should be well ventilated. The nurse should not mingle with" 
ahy other members of the family. All articles of clothing or bedding used by 
the patient should be dipped into an ,. antiseptic solution, such as corrosive 
sublimate of the strength 1 to 3,000, before removal from the sick room. The 
physician, before entering the sick room, should cover his head with a linen 
cap and wear a rubber coat or wrap a sheet about him. These should be dis- 
infected both before and after using and when not in use should be hung out- 
side the sick room. If it is necessary for members of the family to enter the 
room they should observe the same precautions and on leaving the room 
they should gargle or rinse the mouth with some mild cleansing wash such 
as boric acid solution. After the recovery of the patient the articles in the 
room should be washed in an antiseptic solution and the room thoroughly 
disinfected. Directions for this are given in the Nursing Department. 

Emergency Remedy or " What To Do." — While you are waiting for the 
physician have the patient gargle his throat frequently with hot water and 
if you wish you may add a little vinegar and pepper to it or you can gargle 
with pure lemon juice, listerine or any other mild antiseptic. In some cases a 
little sulphur blown into the throat through a goose quill is an excellent 
remedy. Gargle with buttermilk. 

Caution or " What Not To Do,"— Do not use utensils or garments used 
by the patient until they have been thoroughly disinfected. Do not get any of 
the sputum or other discharges upon any part of your person and if you do 
you should wash and disinfect the parts immediately with a 1 to 5,000 solution 
of corrosive sublimate. Do not forget to look out for difficult breathing, 
hoarseness or coughing and if any of these are noticed send for the attending 
physician at once. Do not let the patient mingle with others until he has 
been pronounced cured and safe. Do not wash the patient's head or hair until 
two weeks after cured as there is great danger of taking cold. Do not under 
any circumstances allow the patient to take cold during or for some time 



INFECTIOUS AND CONTAGIOUS DISEASES. 47 

after sickness or serious after effects are likely to be the result. Do not let 
the patient get out of bed until well and strong and do not allow him to exert 
himself for some time after recovery as the heart is left weak and many 
persons have died of paralysis of the heart after they were pronounced cured. 

Allopathic Treatment. — Antitoxin is now the chief remedy and used by 
all schools of physicians but this must be administered by a doctor. Some 
give bichloride of mercury in doses of from 1/100 to 1/60 of a grain every 
hour. 

Homeopathic Treatment. — Belladonna, 3rd dilution; mercurius protoi- 
odide, 2nd trituration; kali bichromicum, 3nd trituration; lachesis, 6th dilu- 
tion. As to direction and doses see " Homeopathic Medicines " in the Nursing 
Department. 

Nursing and Diet. — See that the room is well ventilated but do not allow 
the patient to take cold. Be careful to disinfect every article that comes 
in contact with or near the patient and carefully follow all instructions of the 
dofctor. The diet should be mostly of milk or milk preparations. If other 
foods are given they should be such as are easily digested such as broths or 
barley or rice gruel. For preparing these see " Foods for the Sick " in the 
Nursing Department. 

After Effects. — Diphtheria leaves the heart in a weak condition and 
paralysis of the heart, causing death, is often the result especially where the 
patient over exerts himself too soon. Sometimes there is general paralysis and 
very frequently the muscles of the tongue and the swallowing muscles of the 
throat are affected and this is first shown by the food, which has been swal- 
lowed, coming up. Sometimes the vocal cords are paraly2;ed causing tempor- 
ary loss of speech. Other results are broncho-pneumonia, pleurisy, inflamma- 
tion of the stomach and bowels and inflammation of the kidneys. The parents 
and nurse should take great care that none of these serious after effects are 
caused by their carelessness. Follow carefully the instructions of the doctor 
and be exceedingly careful not to let the patient catch cold. 
PEOPLE'S HOME REMEDIES.— 

1. Salt Water and Fat Bacon. — Gargle with salt and water and apply 

bandages wet with salt and water to the throat and bind on slices of fat bacon. 

3. Linseed Meal Poultice. — To reduce the swelling of the neck apply 

a poultice of linseed meal. At the beginning of the disease have the patient 

inhale the steam from hot water and vinegar. 

3. Glycerine and Creosote, — Gargle with a mixture of glycerine, 2 
ounces; and creosote, 7 to 8 drops. 

4. Steam from Lime Water. — Have the patient inhale the steam from 
lime water. 

5. Alum. — Blow finely powdered alum into the throat or use alum 
water as a wash. 

6. Vinegar and Honey. — A gargle composed of vinegar, honey and 
warm water is an excellent remedy. For adults add red pepper. 

7. Salt and Ashes. — Fill a flannel bag with salt and ashes and apply 
hot to the neck. This has proven very effective in many cases. 

8. Lemon Juice. — A French physician says he has cured many cases 
of diphtheria in the first stages by giving lemon juice as a gargle. To half 
a glass of water add the juice of one lemon and when gargling a little swal- 
lowed will be all the better. 

Physician's Remark. — Lemon juice contains citric acid. 
Do not depend upon this alone but get a physician. 



48 PEOPLE'S HOME MEDICAL BOOK. 

9. Pitch Tar. — Insert a funnel over some pitch tar on a hot iron and Jet 
the patient breathe the smoke five or six times a day. Also let the patient 
hold small piecjes of ice in the mouth. This treatment has eased the distress 
in a great many cases. 

10. Sulphur. — Gargle with sulphur and water. 

11. Sulphur and Lemon Juice. — Mix sulphur with lemon juice and take 
a little in the mouth every half hour. 

SCARLET FEVER, 
Scarlet Rash — Scarlatina. 

DESCRIPTION. — Scarlet fever is an acute infectious disease with an 
eruption or rash peculiar to itself. It most frequently aflfects children under 15 
years of age. The rash is scarlet tinted and made up of very many small 
or minute points. It shows on the second day of illness and is attended with 
fever. It is most likely to occur during the fall and winter months. The 
fatality tables of our cities show that on an average death occurs in from 10 
to 14 per cent, of the cases but in children under five years of age between 
20 and 30 per cent, of the cases are fatal. These percentages are probably too 
high because many of the milder cases are not reported at all. 

CAUSES. — Scarlet fever is taken by coming in contact with a person ef- 
fected or with the scales which come from his body. A person may also be 
infected through the discharges from the nose or ear of the patient and by 
coming in contact with articles of clothing worn by the patient or furniture 
which has been in the sick room. Books and letters may retain the infection 
for a long time and the disease is frequently spread by pets such as cats and 
dogs. The author once attended a family where four of the children had 
taken scarlet fever by playing with a dog coming from the home of a neigh- 
bor where they had the disease. No other acute disease renders the surround- 
ings of the patient a source of danger for so long a time. Clothing and 
upholstered furniture have transmitted the disease to healthy children two 
years after the recovery of the patient. 

Nursing babies do not take the disease so readily as children from 3 to 
5 years old at which age it most frequently occurs. A scarlet fever patient 
cannot transmit the disease until the rash develops. At about the fourth or 
fifth day the patient can easily give the disease to others and he can then do 
so as long as he continues to " scale off," which is often for six weeks. Ar- 
ticles of food may convey the disease and it is very frequently spread through 
milk coming from dairies where there are persons employed who have scarlet 
fever or in whose family it exists. 

SYMPTOMS. — Not all persons who are exposed take the disease but if 
they do it is usually from 3 to 10 days after exposure. One seldom has it the 
second time. 

How It Begins.— It usually begins with a sore throat, a moderately high 
fever, headache and backache and frequently is attended with sickness at 
the stomach and vomiting. The disease generally begins suddenly and the 
suddenness and severity of these symptoms generally show how hard one is 
to have the disease. 

The Rash. — ^The scarlet rash is made up of many fine points which are so 
close together as to give the skin a flushed appearance like a continuous 
or solid rash. It looks a great deal like a severe case of heat rash. It appears 
on the second day and is seen first on the chest but may spread over the entire 



INFECTIOUS AND CONTAGIOUS DISEASES. 49 

body in 4 or 5 hours. In mild cases the rash continues only for a day or two 
but in severe cases it may last for 5 or 6 days. The rash ends with " scaling." 

The Sore Throat — The rash is generally attended with a very severe 
sore throat which causes much difficulty in swallowing. The back part of 
the throcft is red and angry looking and sometimes so sore as to obscure or 
hide all the other symptoms of the disease. Frequently the tongue first 
looks like an unripe and later like a ripe strawberry. 

The Scaling. — When the rash ends the outer skin begins to come off in 
scales of varying sizes. The skin may " peel " off of the hands and feet. 
The amount of scaling and how long it will last depends upon how hard one 
has the disease. It usually lasts 3 or 4 weeks but in bad cases it may last 
as long as 6 or even 8 weeks. 

The Fever. — The fever reaches its height within a few hours from the 
beginning of the attack and often runs up to 105 degrees within 13 hours but 
usually falls to 103 degrees after 24 hours and then gradually decreases. 

Diseases Coming With Scarlet Fever. — A stopping of the urine, or water, 
may be one of the first symptoms or albumen in the urine may be the only 
evidence of kidney trouble. Swelling under the eyes is also a symptom of 
kidney trouble and dropsy is likely to set in before you realize it. There is 
also likely to be inflammation of the ears. 

Distinguishing Features or " How to Tell it from Other Diseases." — To 
distinguish scarlet fever from other diseases you should consult the " Table 
of Symptoms " and " The Comparison of Diseases " given in the Nursing 
Department of this book. Rose rash looks a great deal like scarlet fever but 
in that disease there is no sore throat and the tongue does not have the 
peculiar strawberry look. Both of these symptoms are generally found in 
scarlet fever and will aid you in distinguishing it from other diseases. 
TREATMENT.— 

Preventive Treatment. — Separate the sick one from the rest of the family 
and if more than one is sick it is best for them to be put into different rooms. 
Remove from the room all curtains, carpets, etc., leaving only necessary 
articles. As to disinfection use the same care as in diphtheria and other in- 
fectious diseases. The clothes worn just before illness should be boiled or 
sterilized in steam and then aired in the sun. During and after the illness, 
the bed clothes and linen when removed should be put into a 1 to 5,000 solu- 
tion of corrosive sublimate and then boiled, dried and aired in the sun. After 
the patient is well the sick room should be disinfected. Directions for doing 
this are given in the Nursing Department. To prevent spreading the disease 
do not allow any of the children to go to school or mingle with other chil- 
dren while you have scarlet fever in the house. Do not allow the children 
to play with cats or dogs coming from homes where they have the disease. 
Spray the throats of the children, who have not yet taken the disease, every 
morning with listerine or some other mild antiseptic. If the patient is 
greased from head to foot it will prevent the scales flying so much and spread- 
ing the disease. 

Emergency Remedy or "What To Do."— Separate the child from the 
rest of the family as soon as the symptoms are suspicious. Put even the 
mildest case to bed and it is well to grease the child from head to foot with 
unsalted lard or a piece of fat bacon. If the child is old enough it is well to 
have it gargle its throat frequently with a weak solution of chlorate of pot- 
ash. Use from 3 to 5 grains to an ounce of water. Keep the child warm

r>nd comfortable. Watch carefully for symptoms of dropsy or kidney trouble 
and save the urine that the doctor may note the condition of the kidneys and 
perhaps avoid serious after' effects. Watch for pains in the ears as inflam- 
mation of the ears and deafness are often the results of scarlet fever. 

Caution or " What Not to Do." — Above all else do not allow the patient 
to take cold and especially during scaling; as kidney trouble, deafness, or 
blindness may be the result. Do not throw away the urine as the physician 
may need to examine it daily as to quantity, color and consistency. Do not 
allow those attending the patient to mingle with others and do not allow the 
patient to do so until the doctor or health officer gives permission. If in the 
city, or country districts where they have health boards, do not disobey 
their laws and do not fail to report even the mildest case. When there 
is scarlet fever in the neighborhood do not go near it or allow the children 
to mingle with any of the family or play with their cats or dogs. Do not 
forget to disinfect. 

For the Intense Itching. — Grease the patient with fresh unsalted butter 
or a piece of bacon or rub with .sweet oil containing from ^^ per cent, to 1 
per cent, of carbolic acid. Or, the patient may be rubbed with weak carbol- 
ized vaseline. This is vaseline containing a very small amount of carbolic 
acid. 

For the Pain in the Ear. — Syringe the ear 3 or 3 times a day, or oftener 
if necessary, with a normal salt solution as hot as can be borne. The normal 
salt solution contains four parts of salt, three parts of sodium carbonate and 
one thousand parts of water. ^ 

For the Dropsy. — If the patient has dropsy and does not pass enough 
urine, and usually he does not, give pumpkin seed tea freely. Meanwhile 
sweat the patient either with the corn sweat as described in the Nursing 
Department or in the following way. Put the patient in a warm room and 
have him sit on a cane seated chair with a blanket pinned tightly about the 
neck and hanging to the floor on all sides. Put a pail of water under the 
chair and into it put a hot brick. This will create steam and cause the patient 
to sweat. Instead of the water and brick you can attach a hose to a steam- 
ing teakettle and then put the other end under the blanket ; or,' if the patient 
is in bed, it can be put under the bed clothes which have been raised above the 
patient. Care should be taken not to scald the patient. Or, the croup tent 
may be used as described in the Nursing Department. 

Allopathic Treatment. — For a child eight years old give 5 grains of citrate 
of potash and 20 drops of sweet spirits of nitre in a little water 3 or 4 times 
a day. Or, for the bowels and kidneys, mix 2 ounces of epsom salts with 2 
ounces of cream of tartar and give two teaspoonfuls dissolved in a little water 
every 3 hours until the bowels move freely. The bowels should move once or 
twice daily. This dose of salts and cream of tartar is for a child a year old. 

Homeopathic Treatment.— Put 10 or 15 drops of the third dilution of 
Belladonna into half a glass of water and give two teaspoonfuls every 1 to 
3 hours. For the kidneys when there is passing of but little water give the 
third trituration of Apis. Mel. Give 1 tablet every 1 to 3 hours. (See "Homeo- 
pathic Medicines" in Nursing Department.) 

Nursing and Diet.— The nurse should see that the patient stays in bed 
even if it is a mild case for there is great danger of taking cold and leaving 
bad after'-effects. If the rash is driven in it should be brought out with hot 
teas and by sweating. The sick room should have good ventilation and 



INFECTIOUS AND CONTAGIOUS DISEASES. 51 

plenty of' sunshine. The temperature should be about 68 degrees or com-" 
fortable for the patient. It is well to have the child, if old enough, gargle 
its throat frequently with chlorate of potash as directed above. This may be 
kept up from the beginning to the end of the attack. When the child is 
getting well it should be bathed every day with warm soapy water to aid 
in the scaling and to lessen the tendency to kidney trouble and dropsy. After 
the first two or three days, when the child is no longer sick at the stomach, 
cold water should be given frequently as a drink. Where the child refuses 
milk as a diet and is continually wanting water, the water and milk may be 
mixed. Do not give milk during the vomiting stage of the disease. 

If the fever remains persistently above 103 degress or if it occasionally 
rises to 105 degrees, the child must be bathed well in water which at the 
beginning is about 90 degrees but is allowed to drop to 80 or 85 degrees 
during the bath which should, last from 5 to 15 minutes. The child should 
be rubbed all over during the bath. Applications of cold water at 50 degrees 
should be made to the head as long as the fever is at 104 degrees or higher. 
Where there is no bath tub to be used, frequent washing with water at 60 
to 70 degrees must be adopted without drying the child afterwards. The 
cooling baths must be repeated often to control the fever. 

After Effects. — Dropsy, chronic kidney trouble or Bright's disease are 
very likely to follow scarlet fever and there may be a discharge from one or 
both ears caused by inflammation of the ear which may result in deafness, i 
Weak eyes, sometimes resulting in partial or total blindness, and endocarditis, 
or heart disease, are other bad after effects. Many cases of chronic tonsil- 
itis follow and sometimes the glands under the jaw are permanently en- 
larged. Of these after effects kidney and ear troubles probably occur most 
frequently. The; parents or nurse should constantly keep a look-out for pains 
in the ears and attention must be paid to the urine and the patient must not 
be allowed to take cold if you would guard against the serious after effects 
of scarlet fever. 

PEOPLE'S HOME REMEDIES.— 

1. Fat Bacon — Sulphur— Cold Water.— Rub the patient morning and 
evening from head to foot with a piece of fat bacon. Should the throat be 
very sore apply cloths wet in cold water. Should the eruption suddenly dis- 
appear bathe all over with cold water and without drying cover imme- 
diately with woolen blankets and give cold water to drink. When the skin 
begins to peel give an occasional dose of sulphur. 

Physician's Remarks. — Greasing the patient relieves the itching and aids 
in keeping the scales from flying and spreading the disease. In using cold 
water be careful not to chill the patient. 

2. Hot Teas. — If the case is not severe little medicine is needed. Give 
pennyroyal, catnip, saffron or sage tea. To relieve vomiting give water with 
a little soda in it. 

3. Chipped Ice. — For the vomiting give the patient small chips of ice in 
the mouth. 

4. Bacon. — Give the patient a warm sponge bath every night, then 
grease the entire body with a piece of uncooked bacon. If the case is severe 
bind slices of bacon upon the breast, neck, and soles of the feet. This treat- 
ment will not interfere with anything the physician may see fit to give inter- 
nally if he is called later. 



53 PEOPLE'S HOME MEDICAL BOOK. 

Physician's Remarks. — The bathing establishes a good circulation in the 
skin and thus keeps the eruption out; it keeps the pores open and helps the 
skin to throw off its proper secretions and rid the body of poisons and it 
also induces sleep. 

6. Onion and Saffron. — Cut an onion in halves; take out the heart; 
put a spoonful of saffron into the cavity ; put the pieces tpgether again ; wrap 
in a cloth; and bake in an oven. When the onion is cooked so that the juice 
will run freely, squeeze out all the juice and give a teaspoonful to the patient. 
Rub goose grease or a piece of bacon on the chest and throat. Keep the 
patient warm and seldom any other treatment will be required. 

Physician's Remarks. — The saffron keeps the bowels open and the onion 
is soothing to the sore and congested throat. This remedy comes from a 
mother living in California who successfully treated her five children who all 
had the scarlet fever at the same time. 

6. Pepper, Salt and Vinegar. — ^Take cayenne pepper, 1 teaspoonful; 
common salt, 2 teaspoonfuls and a teacupful of water with enough vinegar 
added to make of the desired strength. Bring these to the boiling point, let 
stand, until cool and then strain. Use as a gargle for sore throat either in 
colds or scarlet fever. 

7. Warm Lemonade. — An eminent physician of Boston robs scarlet 
fever of many of its terrors by prescribing warm lemonade with a little mu- 
cilage or gum arabic dissolved in it. This he gives as often as the patient 
desires. He also applies warmth to the stomach and directs that a cloth be 
wrung out of hot water and laid upon the stomach and changed as rapidly 
as it cools. Nothing but the lemonade is given internally. 

8. Cleaver's Root Tea. — Give a tea made of cleaver's root. The dose 
is' from 1 to 4 ounces. Or, equal parts of cleaver's root, maiden hair and 
elder blows, steeped in warm water for 3 hours and drank freely when cold, 
is good for scarlet fever and other eruptive diseases. 

MEASLES. 
Rubeola — Morbilli. 
DESCRIPTION.— Measles is an acute infectious disease. It is 
usually epidemic, that is, it runs through a neighborhood. Il; usually at- 
tacks children and a person over 30 years of age seldom has it. 

■ .CAUSES. — The disease is contagious and taken by coming in contact 
with or near those who have it. It is carried in clothing, etc. 

SYMPTOMS.— It usually comes on rather gradually aiid is much like 
'an ordinary cold in the head in that there is coughing, sneezing and watery 
eyes and nose. The eruption generally appears on the third or fourth day 
Upon close inspection it is first seen in the mouth but is usually first noticed 
on the face and neck as small red spots and from these places it spreads 
slowly over the body. The spots are like blotches. The cough is caused by 
the eruption in the windpipe and for this reason cough medicines generally 
do but little good until ,the eruption disappears. The eruption is also in the 
eyes causing them to be inflamed and very weak. The disease spreads 
rapidly through the air and you do not need to come in contact with the 
patient or his garments in order, to take it. A very short exposure to the 
infected air is all that is necessary for one to take the measles The patient 
rarely gives the disease, though, after three weeks have expired from the

INFECTIOUS AND CONTAGIOUS DISEASES. 53 

beginning of the attack. One usually comes down with the measles in from 
8 to 30 days after exposure. It seldom occurs more than once in the same 
person. 
TREATMENT.— 

Preventive. — Keep away from those having the disease and do not allow 
the children to play with pets coming from homes where the disease exists. 
Disinfect the clothing, furniture and sick room. Prevent the broncho-pneu- 
monia, which sometimes follows it, by not taking cold and prevent trouble 
with the eyes by not using them or exposing them to light. 

Emergency Remedy or " What To Do." — Put the patient in a darkened 
room where no strong light can strike the eyes; see that he does not take 
cold and keep the eruption out, if necessary, by giving hot drinks. 

Caution or " What Not To Do." — Do not let the patient take cold or the 
cough will be made worse and the lungs and bronchial tubes will be affected 
and sometimes a severe attack of bronchitis or pneumonia will be the result. 
Do not let the patient read or expose the eyes to a strong light or the sight 
may be ruined for life. Do not overload the stomach or diarrhea will be 
the result. 

Allopathic Treatment. — For the cough, which is hard to control, give 1/30 
of a grain of codein from 1 to 3 times in 24 hours. This is the dose for a 
child two years old. If there is diarrhea give blackberry wine or a tea made 
from blackberry root. , 

Homeopathic. — At the beginning, for the fever, give the 3nd dilution of 
Aconite. Put 10 to 15 drops in a glass half full of water and give 2 tea- 
spoonfuls every 1 to 3 hours. For the tight cough, throbbing headache and 
sore eyes give the 3rd dilution of Belladonna. It is prepared and given the 
same as the Aconite. If it hurts to cough give the 2nd dilution of Bryonia 
in the same way. 

Nursing and Diet. — Put the patient into a darkened room where no sun- 
light enters and do not allow him to use the eyes or they will be weakened. 
See that he does not take cold or serious consequences will follow. Keep him 
warm but not uncomfortably hot. To bring out the rash give warm teas 
such as elder blossom, ginger or horehound. If there is no room which can 
be kept at an even temperature the patient should remain in bed during the 
entire attack. Watch the cough and if there is pain in the chest it should be 
attended to at once or bronchitis or pneumonia will be the result. 

Cold drinks are refreshing and beneficial if not given too freely. To 
children, give milk after the fever from the eruption has passed. To adults, 
as there is generally some trouble with the stomach and bowels, give food 
frequently and it should consist of the various broths, milk, eggs boiled for 
only one minute and similar substances. 

After Effects. — Weakened eyes and impaired eyesight are the results of 
reading or exposing the eyes to the light during or soon after the disease. 
Bronchitis and pneumonia are the results of taking cold. 

PEOPLE'S HOME REMEDIES.— 

1. Weak Lye Water. — To relieve the itching frequently bathe the pa- 
tient with warm, weak lye water. 

2. Blackberry Root Tea. — If there is any diarrhea give blackberry root 
tea. 



54 PEOPLE'S HOME MEDICAL BOOK. 

Physician's Remark. — This is good because of its slightly astringent 
qualities. 

3. Poultices of Mustard, Hops and Lobelia. — If there is inflammation of 
the lungs apply a mustard poultice to the chest and follow with a poultice of 
hops and lobelia. Change every half hour. 

, Physician's Remark. — This poultice is good for all kinds of inflammations. 

4. Saffron Tea or Hot Lemonade. — Give plenty of warm saffron tea or 
hot lemonade and if possible keep up a gentle sweat. Sponge the patient 
every few hours with warm vinegar and water. 

5. Elder Flower Tea. — To bring the rash out give warm elder flower tea. 

GERMAN MEASLES. 
Rubella, Rotheln. 

Description. — This is a distinct disease and not a form of the regular 
measles or scarlet fever. It is usually mild and rarely afifects adults. 

Causes. — It is contagious and is taken by coming in contact with or near 
those who have it. It is carried in clothing, etc. 

Symptoms. — The person usually comes down in from te'n to twelve days 
after exposure. There is chilliness, general weakness, some running of the 
nose and eyes and there is generally headache. The rash sometimes appears 
as early as the first day but sometimes not until the third day. The rash 
appears as red spots but is not scarlet. It is first seen on the face and then 
the chest, lasts about three days and then gradually fades away. There 
is generally an enlargement of the lymph glands below the ears and under 
the jaw and this is characteristic of the disease. The symptoms of a cold 
are not so severe as in measles. There is not the coughing that goes with 
measles but the glands swell in German measles while they do not in measles. 
The fever is low and there is no sore throat like there is in scarlet fever. 
TREATMENT.— 

" What to Do." — Rest in bed and for the kidneys give a teaspoonful of 
sweet spirits of nitre every three or four hours. 

" What Not to Do." — Do not take cold. Do not expose others. 

MUMPS. 
Epidemic Parotitis. 

Description. — Mumps is an inflammation of the salivary glands. It 
is an acute disease of childhood and is infectious and contagious. It 
is also contracted by adults. The disease afifects the parotid glands back 
of the jaw and below the ear and is accompanied by mild symptoms which, 
unfortunately, are often not severe enough to be noticed until the person has 
taken cold and serious results follow. It occurs oftenest between the fourth 
and fifteenth years or before puberty. One attack protects a person from the 
second. 

Causes. — Mumps is usually conveyed from one person to another and is 
contagious from beginning to end of the attack. 

Symptoms. — The glands back of the jaw are swollen which gives the 
patient a broad appearance at and under the ears and prevents his chewing 
anything solid. The pain lasts for some days, usually about a week. The 
attack comes on from three to twenty-five days after exposure and the average 
is fifteen days. The pain is greatly increased by moving the jaws or by 
taking sour things like pickles and vinegar into the mouth. 



INFECTIOUS AND CONTAGIOUS DISEASES. 55 

TREATMENT.— 

Caution or " What Not to Do." — Above all things do not take cold. 

Allopathic Treatment.— Anoint the parotid glands back of the jaws twice 
daily with warm oil of henbane and cover with cotton. Keep the bowels 
open. If the swelling goes to the breasts, ovaries or scrotum give aconite 
in full doses of from 1 to 5 drops every 1 to 3 hours and citrate 6i potash in 
full doses, 10 to 30 grains every three hours, for the kidneys. Rest is a neces- 
sity. Put a bandage on the scrotum to hold it up. Apply hot boiled beans 
to the scrotum as a poultice. This is very good and I have often used it for 
this trouble. 

Homeopathic Treatment. — Mercurius Sol., 3rd trituration. Give one 
tablet every 1 to 3 hours. If the swelling goes to the scrotum give the 3rd 
dilution of Pulsatilla, two teaspoonfuls of the prepared solution, every 1 to 3 
hours. (See " Homeopathic Medicines " in Nursing Department.) 

Nursing and Diet. — ^Usually the only danger in this disease is from the 
complications. Do not take cold. Remain in the house. Drink milk and 
live on liquid foods. In women, if the swelling goes to the breasts or ovaries, 
apply hot fomentations of hops. Renew them often and keep them hot. If 
the pain is great you can put from % to 1 teaspoonful of laudanum in the 
steaming cloth. You need not use the laudanum every time but about once 
every 2 or 3 hours. Generally the heat and moisture will ease the pain. 
In men, if the swelling goes down to the testicles or scrotum, boil some 
beans thoroughly, apply as a poultice and keep on for days. Of course 
it is to be applied hot. The beans hold the heat and moisture longer than 
hops and are thus particularly good for this purpose. 

After Effects. — If one takes cold during an attack of mumps the swell- 
ing will go to the testicles or scrotum in men and to the breasts or ovaries in 
women. This is a very serious and painful result and sometimes is never 
fully recovered from. Every precaution should be taken that the patient 
does not take cold and especially if the patient be an adult. The author was 
once called to treat a man sixty years of age who had been very careless 
and taken cold so that the swelling " went down " on him. As a result a clot 
of blood lodged in the brain causing partial paralysis and entire loss of 
speech. As he gradually got better his speech came back slowly. He would 
say " he " meaning " she " and though his wife's name was " Alice " he per- 
sisted in calling her " Cora." Even after recovery, on damp days and at cer- 
tain tim.es when a little excited, he would partially lose his speech again. 
One cannot be too careful about taking cold during an attack of mumps. 

PEOPLE'S HOME REMEDIES.— 

1. Hot Herb Teas. — If the swelling is painful produce sweating by plac- 
ing the feet in hot water and drinking teas of catnip, spearmint, balm or 
pennyroyal. The bowels should be kept open with epsom salts or castor oil. 

Physician's Remark. — The above is a good treatment as the sweating 
relieves some of the congestion. 

2. Liniment. — An excellent application is a liniment made by mixing 
two ounces of alcohol with an ounce each of gum camphor, oil of sassafras, 
spirits of hartshorn, castile soap sind spirits of turpentine. 

3. Poultices. — If the swelling goes to the testicles or breasts, produce 
sweating and apply to the affected parts poultices of equal parts of hops 



56 PEOPLE'S HOME MEDICAL BOOK. 

and stramonium leaves made with hot water. Chamomile flowers also make 
a good poultice for this purpose. 

CHICKEN-POX. 

Description. — This is an acute infectious disease usually occurring in 
children under ten years of age and seldom after puberty. 

Cause. — It is caused by infection or taking the germs into the system. 

Symptoms. — Fever usually lasts from twenty-four to forty-eight hours 
and during this time the pimples appear first upon the exposed parts of the 
body such as the forehead, face, and hands and then upon the chest and 
back. There may be only a few. or there may be hundreds. These pimples 
are first red, then a clear liquid forms and this later usually turns to a yel- 
lowish color and then they break and dry up leaving no scars unless the}' 
are very large or have been irritated by scratching. The patient is usually 
well in a week but red spots where the pimples have been remain much longer. 
TREATMENT.— 

"What to Do." — After the liquid has formed in the pimples the large ones 
on the face should be pricked and washed twice daily with boric acid solution, 
using half an ounce of boric acid to a pint of boiled water. 

" What Not to Do." — Do not let the patient scratch the sores. 

PEOPLE'S HOME REMEDIES.— 

1. Hot Teas. — Keep the patient in the house and but little medicine is 
required. Give salifron, pennyroyal, sage or catnip tea and open the bowels 
with a seidlitz powder. -• 

Physician's Remarks. — Saffron acts on the bowels, pennyroyal causes 
sweating and sage is a tonic. These teas bring out the eruption. 

2. Talcxun Powder. — Apply talcum powder to relieve the itching. 

SMALL-POX. 
Variola. 

Description. — This is an acute infectious disease affecting the entire 
body but showing itself chiefly upon the skin and more particularly upon 
the face and forearms as an eruptive skin disease which first appears as 
spots which turn to pimples, then to watery pimples, then to pus pimples 
and finally to a hollowed out place in the skin. The disease existed many 
centuries before the time of Christ. 

Cause. — It is taken by coming in contact with or near those who have 
it and is caused by the infection entering the system. 

SYMPTOMS. — The disease usually comes on from five to twenty days 
after exposure, as a rule about twelve days, then the symptoms develop as 
in many other acute diseases. Headache and backache are the most promi- 
nent symptoms and they are peculiar and very severe. This peculiar head- 
ache and backache are characteristic of this disease and their intensity is 
very significant. There may also be chills and pain in the region of the 
stomach. 

The Fever. — The fever is usually high from the beginning and it may 
reach 104 degrees in twenty-four hours and in forty-eight hours it may be 
at 105 or 106 degrees and remain about this high until the eruption appears. 
Then it speedily falls to 99 degrees in moderate cases and to 100 degrees in 



7,»?!^P|rw»!Wl|IBJ!WWlJ!pWS.»

INFECTIOUS AND CONTAGIOUS DISEASES. 57 

running cases. It then runs at about this temperature until the pus begins to 
form when the secondary fever develops which rises to 103 or even 104 degrees 
but falls back and again rises one or two degrees many times and gradually 
ends so that by the end of about twelve days there is no fever. It is some- 
times difficult to distinguish between small-pox and other diseases. Chicken- 
pox and measles are sometimes mistaken for it and sometimes small-pox 
is mistaken for these diseases. It is also sometimes mistaken for a mild case 
of typhoid fever. A person seldom takes the small-pox more than once. 
The pulse is rapid and often as high as 120. 

The Eruption. — In the majority of cases the true small-pox eruption ap- 
pears on the third day. At first the eruption may be very scanty and perhaps 
there are but one or two spots on the face, hand or forearm. It usually 
appears first on the exposed parts. In other instances the spots are very 
numerous on the face, the front surfaces of the forearms and on the trunk. 
These are the parts that are particularly likely to show the first signs of the 
eruption. In still other cases the surface of the body is sound and the 
mucous membrane in the mouth and back part of the throat is affected. 
The parts that are affected the least are the chest and the back surfaces of 
the legs and arms. 

The eruption then proceeds very rapidly through five stages. For the 
first few hours very small, bright red spots are present which disappear upon 
pressvire. They soon become hard and raise up and form pimples. About 
twenty-four hours after the appearance of the eruption the pimple begins to 
show a tiny red watery point on its top and this rapidly develops so that 
by the fourth or fifth day of the rash the pimple contains a fluid. On about 
the fifth or sixth day the center of the pimple is slightly sunken. The 
fluid now becomes cloudy and " mattery " and the surface of the pimple or 
pock gradually loses its sunken form and by the seventh or eighth day aftei 
eruption the pimple has become a pus-pimple and by the tenth day is raised 
or dome-like and- surrounded by redness. In from twenty-four to forty-eighi 
hours the matter escapes, dries, and forms a dirty looking scab from which 
there comes a distinct odor. Sometimes the pus-pimple does not break but 
simply dries up and when the scab falls off it leaves a red or pink hollow in 
the skin which is afterwards called a pock mark. In small-pox when you 
draw your hand over the pimples, and particularly on the forehead, they 
feel hardened as though there was gun-shot under the skin. This is one way 
to distinguish small-pox from other diseases. The rash does not all dis- 
appear at once. On some parts of the body there may be watery pimples 
while on other parts there are pus-pimples. 

TREATMENT.^-The treatment is good nursing and nourishing food. 

Preventive Treatment. — Vaccination. (See this subject following.) 

Nursing and Diet. — For the intense itching apply carron oil and, if nec- 
essary, add to it one per cent, of carbolic acid. Carron oil is made by taking 
equal parts of lime water and sweet oil. 

For the great pain in the hands and feet and other thick parts hot poultices 
may be applied or prolonged hand and foot baths of lukewarm water may 
be employed. Also an ointment of one dram of aristol and one ounce of vase- 
line may be used. 

Dressing for the Face. — Use a mask with holes cut in it for the nose 
and mouth. On the inner side of this mask should be placed a thin linseed 



58 PEOPLE'S HOME MEDICAL BOOK. 

meal poultice and over this should be smeared vaseline containing iodoform. 
This should be changed every two hours. The vaseline aids greatly in sepa- 
rating the crusts and leaves the skin free for the application of the dressing 
which tends to prevent ulceration and the formation of scars. 

Mouth.— jRinse the mouth with boric acid solution using one teaspoonful 
of boric acid to four ounces of water. When the mouth is very dry use 
flaxseed tea sweetened with a little white sugar and made a little tart with 
lemon juice. 

Pocks. — Do not open the pocks with a needle or knife. Use the above 
application. 

PEOPLE'S HOME REMEDIES.— 

1. Cream of Tartar. — As a preventive, when small-pox is in a neighbor- 
hood, frequently take a little cream of tartar dissolved in water. Use an ounce 
to a half a glass of water. Some remarkable testimonials have been received 
regarding cream of tartar as a preventive of small-pox, some even claiming it 
to be also a cure. 

Physician's Remark. — As a physician I cannot see how cream of tartar 
can cure this disease. It is a mild laxative and affects the blood and kidneys 
and by keeping the bowels open, the blood in good condition and the kid- 
neys in good working order a person will be more healthy and more able to 
resist the attacks of any disease. 

VARIOLOID. 

There are several very mild forms of small-pox and of these varioloid 
is the most frequent. By varioloid we usually mean small-pox occurring 
in a person who has been successfully vaccinated but it may also occur 
in a person who is not naturally susceptible to small-pox. Hence, varioloid 
and small-pox are one and the same disease, the former being merely a milder 
form than the latter. 

VACCINATION. 

Method. — ^Wash th? skin on the arm or leg with soap and water and 
alcohol. Take off the outer skin (epidermis) from a small place but do not 
cause much bleeding. Upon this spot put the vaccine point and gently 
rub it into the part and let dry before putting the clothing on again. Mica 
shields are now generally placed over the vaccination, to protect it from dirt 
and clothing. Glycerinated vaccine lymph is very good and is put up in 
srriall glass tubes. Vaccine is taken from the belly of the cow. 

Symptoms. — Three or four days after vaccination the part looks red and 
this redness increases and there is developed a red pimple which turns to a 
vesicle or contains a fluid. This increases in size and by the eighth day is 
fully developed. The redness may extend on all sides for a considerable 
distance. The spot is painful and the neighboring glands may be swollen 
and tender, particularly the gland or kernel under the arm if it is thp arm 
that has been vaccinated. About the tenth day the patient may have a 
slight rise in temperature and suffer some from chills and a tired feeling. 
Sometimes red spots develop over the body. On about the eleventh or

INFECTIOUS AND CONTAGIOUS DISEASES. 59 

twelfth day these symptoms begin to lessen and the pimple or vesicle begins 
to dry up and is completely dried up by about the end of the fifteenth day. 
The crust is dark red in color and thin at its edges and in the center. A 
pink spot is left after the scab falls off and this gradually fades and leaves 
a pitted mark. Some cases are very mild but some are quite severe. 

Secondary Vaccination. — Vaccination the second time does not generally 
take so well or is not so severe. If one trial fails it should be tried three 
times. Children should always be vaccinated during the first year of life; 
or, if exposed to small-pox, they should be vaccinated immediately after 
birth. 

Should We Vaccinate. — Vaccination is certainly a preventive of small- 
pox. If a person has been exposed to small-pox that person should imme- 
diately be vaccinated. It may be too late then to prevent the small-pox 
but the case will be much lighter. Personally, I believe in vaccination and 
have been vaccinated a number of times myself. However, I must say that 
it has a bad effect upon some people. When small-pox is in the neighborhood, 
if vaccination is ordered for the school children by the authorities, I would 
advise you to see a good, conscientious physician and have him examine your 
child to see that it is in condition to stand vaccination. Almost any one can 
undergo vaccination without serious trouble if he is in good condition and 
the vaccination is done in a clean manner and with pure material. Everything 
must be done in a thoroughly clean manner and you must use pure vaccine. 
Do not get the cheap material but buy it from a reliable firm. I like the 
lymph the better because it is more likely to be pure. Take care of yourself 
after vaccination and do not take cold. In most cases where there are bad 
results I believe it is due either to uncleanliness in vaccination or to taking cold 
afterwards. A doctor should not come into your home from tying his horse 
or even from walking and begin to scrape or cut for vaccination without first 
thoroughly washing his hands and boiling his instruments in water. Great 
attention should be paid to cleanliness if you would avoid serious results. 



GRIP. 
La Grippe, Influenza. 
Description. — The " grip " is produced by a germ and is highly infec- 
tious. Epidemics of it occurred in 1830-33, 1836-37, 1847-48 and 1889-90. 

Causes. — The germs are usually taken into the system either directly 
from one who has the disease or through the air. At certain times the 
atmosphere seems more favorable for the growth and spreading of the germs 
than at other times. 

Sjrmptoms. — The grip develops in from twenty-four to seventy-two hours 
after exposure and it usually begins suddenly and with chilliness or severe 
chills followed by severe aching pains in the back and in the legs. The 
nostrils are inflamed and the fever generally is from 103 to 105 degrees. 
The patient looks and feels very sick. About this time symptoms appear 
showing that other parts are affected. Most frequently the respiratory, or 
breathing, system is affected and in addition to more or less inflammation 
of the membrane of the nose an acute bronchitis or cold on the lungs 
develops with a great deal of coughing and sore chest or lungs. The patient 
is very much depressed or in low spirits and sometimes pneumonia, pleurisy, 



60 PEOPLE'S HOME MEDICAL BOOK. 

or heart trouble develops. The stomach and bowels and whole nervous 
system are often affected. 

TREATMENT.— 

Preventive. — Do not take cold or expose yourself to those who have it. 

Go to bed and stay there if you can. Even a robust man who fails to 
rest almost always suffers from a severe attack of grip or from its results 
and he may be made an invalid for weeks. 

What to Do." — Go to bed. take hot drinks and sweat freely. 

" What Not to Do." — Do not take cold after sweating and do not get out 
of bed too soon or some of the serious after effects may be the result. 

Allopathic Treatment. — Little medicine is needed. 

For the Aching. — Salicin is a very useful drug for the aching back and 
limbs. Give five grains in a capsule every five hours. It may be com- 
bined with two grains of quinine at a dose. Dovers powders are also good 
for the aching. Give from two to ten grains twice a day. 

For the Bowels, — Keep the bowels and kidneys open. Take seidlitz 
powders for the bowels or citrate of magnesium if there is bad constipation. 

For the Kidneys. — If the urine is acid give five grains of citrate of potash 
ever)' four hours in plenty of water. If the urine is alkaline, give a five- 
grain capsule of benzoate of ammonia in the same way. 

For the Bronchitis or Coughing. — If the mucus is tough and thick give 
five grains of chloride of ammonia four times a day with % grain of codeme 
or 1/24 grain of heroin. This is for coughing in an adult. For persistent 
cough give five-drop doses of oil of sandal wood four times a day. 

Homeopathic Treatment. — Put ten or fifteen drops of the second dilu- 
tion of Aconite into a glass half full of water and give two teaspoonfuls every 
hour. This is for the first stages when there is a sore throat and a hot and 
dry skin. Gelsemium ; first dilution. Put ten or fifteen drops into half a 
glass of water and give two teaspoonfuls every half hour or every hour. This 
is used more frequently for grip than the Aconite. It is for the tired and 
languid feeling and for the aching. Sometimes the third dilution of 
Belladonna is used. It is to be prepared the same as the Aconite or Gel- 
semium. For painful coughing use the second dilution of Byronia prepared 
and used the same way. For a tight cough use the third dilution of Phos- 
phorus in the same way. 

Nursing and Diet — Give the corn sweat, hot drinks and lots of water. 
The corn sweat is described in the Nursing Department. The diet should 
consist of nourishing foods. A good thing to do when you feel the grip 
coming on is to go to bed and stay there for a few days. First take a good 
hot foot bath and at the same time drink a lot of hot drinks such as hot 
teas or hot lemonade. Take a good sweat, either the corn swe^t or by putting 
hot water bottles or hot bricks about you in the bed. After you are about 
through sweating have some one bathe you with warm watei- using either 
a sponge or cloth. This can be done under the bed clothes so that you do 
not take cold. After the sweat change^ the bed covers and night clothes. 
You can have all the cold water you wish if you drink it often and but a 
little at a time. The hot drinks are better used while taking the sweat. 
Open the bowels with salts or castor oil. If necessary, use sweet spirits 
of nitre for the kidneys. A teaspoonful may be given every three or four 
hours. Buchu tea or pumpkin seed tea is also good for the kidneys. If 



INFECTIOUS AlSfD CONTAGIOUS DISEASES. 61 

you sweat very much you "are not likely to pass much urine for a few hours. 
Be careful to keep covered after the sweat and remain in bed or, if this is 
impossible, you should at least remain in a warm room all the next day. 
If the throat is sore gargle with some of the simple remedies found in this 
book. Salt, pepper and vinegar make a good gargle and sage tea with a little 
honey in it is also good. 

I was hurriedly called to see a farmer friend one night. He had a hard 
chill with pain in his lungs and hard and difficult breathing. He had an 
attack of " grip " and I was afraid it would run into pneumonia and so I 
directed that he be given a " Corn Sweat " as I have described in the Nurs- 
ing Department. The patient agreed with me that this saved him many 
diays of sickness. This is a splendid aid in such inflammatory diseases and 
I freely recommend it in all such cases in the early stage when sweating is 
necessary. ' • 

After Effects. — Sometimes pneumonia and pleurisy go with grip and it 
is often followed by lung, heart and kidney disorders. So take care of your- 
self during an attack of grip. Do not take a cold and do not get out of bed 
too soon. One should not over-exert himself until fully recovered. 

PEOPLE'S HOME REMEDIES.— 

1 Quinine and Capsicum. — Mix twelve grains of sulphate of quinine and 
three grains of powdered capsicum, divide into twelve pills or capsules and 
take one every three hours. 

2. Sweating Remedy. — Put the patient to bed and surround him with 
hot bricks or irons until the sweat pours from him. Keep the patient in 
bed until all moisture is gone and stay in a warm room until well. Allow 
plenty of fresh air but avoid sitting 'where the breeze will strike you. 

3. Corn Sweat. — Take a corn sweat. (The corn sweat has been de- 
scribed in the Nursing Department, so will not be repeated here.) 

4. Mustard Water, Lemonade and Rochelle Salts. — At night bathe the 
feet in warm mustard water and drink freely of lemonade. If there is fever 
take the lemonade cold. In the morning take a dose of rochelle salts. 

5. Hot Teas. — If the case is severe the patient should go to bed and 
hot water bottles should be placed at the sides and feet. Also drink penny- 
royal, peppermint or sage tea. 

6. Vinegar, Honey and Cayenne Pepper. — For the sore throat and 
cough use the following : vinegar, 1 teacupful ; honey, % teacupful ; cayenne, 
1 teaspoonful; simmer together for a few minutes and when cool give a 
teaspoonful whenever the cough is troublesome. 

7. Mullein, Flaxseed and Slippery Elm Teas. — Produce sweating by 
bathing the fe^t in hot water and drinking warm lemonade or a tea made 
of mullein, flaxseed or slippery elm. Take a mild cathartic. 

Physician's Remark. — These sweating remedies aid by helping to throw 
off the poison from the system. 

CEREBRO-SPINAL MENINGITIS— CEREBRO-SPINAL FEVER- 
SPOTTED FEVER. 

Description. — ^This is an acute infectious disease, often malignant, but 
not contagious. It runs a rapid course and it is characterized by the muscles

of the back being drawn tight and rigid and a sort of ' inflammation of 
the membrane which covers the brain and spinal cord, causing a liquid de- 
posit. It affects children and young people most frequently. It is doubtful 
if it is taken by one patient from another. \ 

Cause. — Caused by a germ. 

SYMPTOMS.— 

Moderate Form. — There is a sudden chill which may be preceded 
by headache and dizziness. The headache rapidly becomes severe and 
there is also severe pain in the back and down the back of the thighs, the 
muscles of which are often drawn and fixed. The fever which follows 
the chill is usually moderate, generally about 102 degrees. As the disease 
develops the muscles of the back also become tense and hard and likewise 
those of the neck and arms and finally they become almost rigid and drawn 
so tightly that the patient may bend backwards. 

Malignant Form. — This comes on very suddenly. The chill is followed 
by headache, unconsciousness, convulsions and death. The patient is over- 
whelmed by the poison. 

TREATMENT. — The treatment is very unsatisfactory. The injection of 
a certain serum is now being used with good results in a number of cases. 

Allopathic Treatment. — Chloral hydrate may be given in doses for adults 
of 20 grains by the mouth or* 60 grains as an injection, in starch water. 
The excessive pain may be relieved by giving from l^ to % grain of mor- 
phine by the mouth. Apply an ice bag or anything cold to the neck and back. 
Relief from the severe pain may be had in some cases by putting the pafient 
for a long time in a hot bath. Either plain or salt water may be used and 
it should be at the temperature of about 99 or 100 degrees. 

Homeopathic. — Put ten or 15 drops of the second dilution of Aconite 
into half a glass of water and give two teaspoonfuls every hour. This is to 
be used at the beginning of the attack and later use the second dilution of 
Bryonia in the same way. 



ERYSIPELAS. 

Description. — ^This is an acute infectious disease. It is an inflammation 
of the skin and tissue beneath. 

Causes. — It is caused by a specific agent and may be carried to another 
by the poison coming in contact with a sore or break in the skin. Some 
people take the disease very easily. 

Symptoms. — ^The skin is bright red and swollen and the disease may 
last from one to two weeks. In the majority of cases it affects the skin of the 
face, the cheek, near the ear or about the corners of the nose. A tingling is 
first felt which speedily becomes an intense burning and is made worse 
by rubbing and scratching. At the beginning of the attack, people who have 
not had it before may think they have been stung by some insect or perhaps 
they may think they have been scratched by something. If it keeps on spread- 
ing ariy one should know what it is. It is a disease that will bear close 
watching especially when it is around the face. It spreads very rapidly and 
by the end of twenty-four hours, or even before, there is a sharp Mne mark- 



INFECTIOUS AND CONTAGIOUS DISEASES. C3 

ing the boundary of the affected parts so that you can tell distinctly where it 
begins and leaves off. This is characteristic of the disease. The face, and 
especially the ears, when affected become very much swollen. Sometimes 
blisters form. There is little or much chilliness according to how severe 
the case is. There is sometimes high fever, a rapid pulse, great weakness 
and delirium. The severity of these symptoms varies a great deal in different 
cases. Erysipelas is a dangerous disease when it occurs in people suffering 
with some chronic disease like liver trouble or Bright's disease. It should 
always be watched carefully when it gets near the ears. 

TREATMENT.— 

Preventive. — A person who has once had erysipelas is very likely to 
take it again and should not come near a person who has it. 

To prevent its spreading I have often painted the healthy skin half an 
inch away with tincture of iodine. Of course iodine discolors the skin and 
when used on the face often leaves marks. 

Allopathic Treatment. — If the bowels are not active they should be 
moved freely with a two grain dose of calomel followed in twelve hours with 
a seidlitz powder or half an ounce of rochelle salts. Then give ten drops 
of the tincture of chloride of iron every three hours. This should be well 
diluted with water and should be given through a tube as it will injure 
the teeth if it comes in contact with them. As a local treatment an oint- 
ment made of equal parts of ichthyol and either lard or lanolin may be 
smeared over the inflamed parts and the healthy skin nearby. Also 
smear this ointment on a mask made of giauze or lint and apply to the parts 
so that the effect will continue longer. A good quality of either brandy or 
whiskey may be used internally if necessary. 

Homeopathic Treatment. — For the bright redness and throbbing head- 
ache give the third dilution of Belladonna. Put ten to fifteen drops into 
half a glass of water and give two teaspoonfuls every one to two hours. If 
there are many watery pimples and much swelling prepare and give the 
sixth dilution of Rhus. Tox. in the same way. If the urine burns give the 
third dilution of Cantharis in same manner. If there is a swollen, puffed 
skin, pain in passing urine and trouble with the kidneys give the third tri- 
turation of Apis. Mel. Give one tablet every hour. A cranberry poultice is 
good when applied locally. 

As illustrating the result of carelessness in treating erysipelas I will 
relate an incident that occurred in my early practice. I was called to see 
an Irishman by the name of " Murphy." Mr. Murphy, in his peculiar dialect- 
which I shall not attempt to imitate said, " Doctor, I have a bad cough." 
" So I see/' I replied. " And I feel real sick and feverish." " Yes," I said, 
"but what are those scales on your face and ears?" "Oh, I had erysipelas 
but a ' pow wow ' person cured that. The erysipelas is all right since the pow 
wowing drove it away but my cough bothers me. Give me something for- 
that." I gave him soriie medicine and on my visit next day the cough was 
gone. Mr. Murphy said, " My cough is gone, doctor, but look at my bloom- 
ing face and ears." It was as I had suspected. The erysipelas had "gone in " 
and that was what caused the cough. The medicine I had given him was to 
bring out the eruption again and this cured the cough. Mr. Murphy then 
depended upon the doctor to cure the erysipelas which the "pow wow" 
person had merely driven in.

PEOPLE'S HOME REMEDIES.— 

1. Chalk, Magnesia, Soda; also Catnip, Boneset and Tansy Tea. — For 

the sour stomach give chalk, magnesia or soda. The vapor bath will give 
relief when the eruption appears. If on the face or head steam the parts 
over a decoction of catnip, boneset or tansy, several times daily. 

3. Cranberry Poultice. — Boil a quart of cranberries until soft, mix with 
flour and apply to the parts. 

Physician's Remark. — This relieves the pain and burning and is one of 
the best local remedies known. 

3. For the Burning and Itching. — To relieve the burning and itching 
add a little vinegar to equal parts of blood root and tincture of lobelia and 
apply three times a day; or, a decoction of mayweed and smartweed may be 
applied cold; or, apply rye meal, powdered starch or a tea made of buck- 
wheat meal. 

4. Weak Lye Water. — Bathe the parts once a day in weak lye water. 

5. Blue Flag, Yellow Dock, Bittersweet, Burdock, Sassafras and Elder 
Flowers. — Take one ounce each of coarsely powdered blue flag root, yellow 
dock root, bittersweet root, burdock root and sassafras bark and add two 
ounces of elder flowers and three quarts of boiling water* Cover and let 
steep for twenty-four hours; then press and strain and take a wineglassful 
three times a day. 

Physician's Remark. — This is good for the blood, especially for chrome 
troubles. 

6. Mustard. — If the disease should be driven in rub the affected parts 
with mustard and immerse the whole body in hot water. 

I. Tallow, Lard, Cold Cream, Flaxseed, Slippery Elm Bark. — Remedy 
the burning by applying tallow, lard or cold cream. A mucilage made of 
either flaxseed or slippery elm bark will do as well. 

8. Tea made from Bark of Burr Oak. — With a tea made from the inner 
bark of the burr oak tree make a bread poultice and apply to the parts. 

9. Lemon Juice and Brandy.-r-Add the juice of two lemons to a gill 
of brandy apd keep the affected parts well moistened. If this is too strong 
a gill of water may be added. Sometimes drinking lemonade is beneficial. 

10. Hot Milk. — Apply hot milk or hot buttermilk to the parts. Gly- 
cerine applied several times a day is also good. 

II. Flour. — Flour dusted upon the parts sometimes gives relief. 

13. Poke Berry Poultice. — Mash a handful of poke berry roots in a pint 
of sweet milk and apply to the inflamed parts. A lady in Indiana says she 
has never known this remedy to fail and she has tried it several times. 

13. Starch and Flour. — Keep the parts covered with powdered starch 
or scorched flour. This is to shield it from the air and light. 

14. Cleaver's Root Tea. — For internal use make a tea of cleaver's root 
and take from two to four ounces three or four times a day. This tea is 
made by steeping 1% ounces of the herb in a pint of boiling water. 

15. Herb Tea.— At the beginning of the disease make a tea by steeping 
equal parts of cleaver's root, maiden hair and elder blows in warm water for 
two or three hours. When cold it may be drank freely . 

16. Buttermilk.— Dip a cloth into buttermilk and apply to the parts. 

17. Salt and Vinegar.-" Bathe the parts frequently with salt and vine- 
gar," writes a lady from Columbus, Ohio. 



INFECTIOUS AND CONTAGIOUS DISEASES. 65 

ACUTE INFLAMMATORY RHEUMATISM— ACUTE ARTICULAR 
RHEUMATISM— ACUTE RHEUMATIC FEVER. 

Description. — This disease occurs most frequently in the cool, damp 
months. It most often occurs between the ages of twenty and thirty-five 
years and seldom after the forty-fifth year. It does not often occur in children. 
Males are affected more than females. It was formerly thought that the 
disease was due to too much uric acid in the blood but this belief is now los- 
ing ground and it is thought the infection gets into the general system 
through the tonsils. 

Symptoms. — The disease usually comes on suddenly. The patient may 
awake to find one or more of his larger joints very much inflamed and that 
any movement causes great pain. The part may be so sensitive to the touch 
as to prevent any examination by touching or handling. The skin over the 
parts is dusky and quite piiffy and hotter than other parts. There is fever, 
the tongue is coated, the bowels constipated and the skin hot and dry or 
bathed with a sticky sweat with a bad odor. This sweating does not relieve 
the patient. There is not much water passed and what there is looks like 
coffee. The inflammation quickly spreads to other joints and may go 
through the joints of the whole body one or more times. The joints that 
were first affected are generally a little easier when the inflammation goes 
to other joints. After a person has had an attack of inflammatory rheuma- 
tism he is more subject to it than before. The disease may last only a week 
and it may last for months. It is terribly painful and requires more than 
the patience of Job to bear the suffering without the use of words that 
would not look well in print. 

TREATMENT.— 

Preventive. — Do not catch cold in any way. A person should not 
come in from work or exercise all heated and sit down in a draught to cocvl 
off. Do not get the feet and limbs wet and then neglect to change your cloth- 
ing. Some people go around all day at work or sit in school all day with 
wet shoes and stockings and then wonder why they have rheumatism. One 
who has once had the disease should be especially careful about these things 
for he will be more subject to it than before. Do not sleep in a " spare bed " 
without first thoroughly airing and drying the bed clothes. One who is 
subject to rheumatism should always sleep upstairs as it is not so likely to 
be damp as are the rooms which are on the first floor. All these things should 
be carefully looked after for rheumatism is more easily prevented than cured, 

" What to Do." — Drink large quantities of water. Give nutritious foods 
and good nursing. 

" What Not to Do." — Do not be cross with the patient. 

Allopathic Treatment. — Give salicylate of soda in five to ten-grain doses 
from 3 to 6 times daily. Larger doses may sometimes be used or smaller 
doses may be given more often. This medicine is very effective but fre- 
quently the stomach will not stand it. Give it in capsules and follow with 
large quantities of water or milk to prevent its irritating the stomach. To 
prevent heart trouble, from four to six small fly blisters may be placed 
<^ver the heart. While giving the salicylate of soda give forty grains of 
common baking soda in each twenty-four hours. If the salicylate of soda 
does not begin to help in four or five days you should stop using it and 

6 



66 PEOPLE'S HOME MEDICAL BOOK. 

give ten drops of wine of colchicum root and fifteen grains of iodide of 
potassium three times daily. 

Homeopathic Treatment. — During the whole course of the disease use the 
second dilution of Aconite. Put ten to fifteen drops into h^lf a glass of water 
and take two teaspoonfuls at -a dose. Alternate this every hour with one 
of the following medicines according to the symptoms. These medicines 
should be prepared the same as the Aconite. If there is a throbbing pain 
in head and the parts are red use the third dilution of Belladonna with the 
Aconite. If any motion makes the person worse use the second dilution of 
Bryonia. If the patient is better after moving a little but restless when 
quiet use the sixth dilution of Rhus. Tox. If the patient is very restless 
and thirsty use the third trituration of Arsenicum. As before stated, one of 
these, according to the symptoms, is to be alternated with the Aconite: 

Nursing and Diet. — Nursing is an important factor in this disease but 
there are few nurses who have the required patience. Remember that the 
patient is suffering intense pain. Sometimes moist applications to the joints 
aid in easing the pain. Again, binding the exposed parts with cotton batting 
is good. The feet and hands may be covered with this. Even the iar of 
your walking on the floor hurts the patient, so when you try to lift him 
be very careful about it and do not lose patience if he gets angry. I have 
had inflammatory rheumatism myself and know that the pain is agonizing. 
You need plenty of pillows to put under and around the patient. Arrange 
and rearrange them to suit the patient and do not be angry if you do not 
suit him the first time. There is only one that can and must have patience 
and that is the nurse. The sick one is suffering too much to think about 
patience. Keep visitors out and the patient will rest and sleep better. See 
that the bowels move every day and that the kidneys work well. Give 
plenty of water. Watch the heart and if you see the bed clothes shaking 
from its hard beating it is then time to give heart remedies. I never like 
to give opiates during this disease for sometimes they affect the heart so 
as to hide the symptoms that show its condition. 

In the first year of my practice I was taken with inflammatory rheu- . 
matism in January. In April we moved into a large brick house with closed 
blinds and surrounded by shade trees. I had no time to recover entirely 
from the rheumatism. In the summer I would come into the house sweat- 
ing and sit down and of course became stififer and stiffer with the rheumatism. 
The house was cool, damp and musty but very pleasant after being out in 
the hot sun. We finally decided I could not get better in this place and so 
left it. It was a damp house but the admittance of sunshine through 
open windows and care on my part would have made me well. I was a 
victim of my own carelessness. A damp, musty, cold house with the sun- 
shine and air shut out will help along any case of rheumatism. This disease 
flourishes on such treatment. Get into the air and sunshine and sleep up- 
stairs in a warm room, you rheumatic people. Most of our ills are of our 
own making and yet we wonder how such things can be. If we will, we 
can generally find the cause of our ailments in our own carelessness. 

After Effects.— The cause of death in this disease is generally the heart 
trouble which it brings on. Disease of the valves and muscles of the heart 
and of the membrane surrounding it (pericardium) is often the result of this 
disease. The heart should be carefully watched both during and after an 
attack of inflammatory rheumatism. 



INFECTIOUS AND CONTAGIOUS DISEASES. 6V 

DYSENTERY. 
Bloody Flux. 

Description. — The disease is characterized by diarrhea, pain in the ab- 
domen and the presence of mucus in the stools. 

Causes. — Getting wet and taking cold, improper food and poor drinking 
water. 

Symptoms. — Sometimes it comes on suddenly and sometimes it develops 
gradually from diarrhoea. One feels wretched and in the first stages often 
has griping pains in the abdomen. After a time the stools become scanty 
and are mostly liquid or mucus and often there is passing of blood. The 
griping pains become more severe and there is intense straining at stool which 
causes the patient to break out in a profuse sweat. There is a constant de- 
sire to have the bowels move and there is also difiiculty and pain in passing 
urine. The tongue is foul and dry. 

TREATMENT.— 

Preventive. — Use boiled water in hot weather and eat properly cooked 
foods. Avoid cold and wet and see that there is proper drainage. 

" What to Do." — Find out the cause if possible and remove that. Look to 
the diet and the drinking water. Give a laxative to remove irritating ma- 
terial from the bowels. Remain quiet during the attack. 

" What Not to Do." — Do not eat anything during the attack if you can 
avoid it. Do not drink unboiled water. Do not strain at stool. Do not 
get wet or take cold. 

Allopathic Treatment. — Give intestinal antiseptics. Salol is good when 
given in five-grain doses three times a day. Subnitrate of bismuth may be 
given in from five to ten-grain doses every three hours. A good combina- 
tion is powdered ipecac and opium, % dram ; subnitrate of bismuth, % ounce ; 
and salol, % dram. Mix all thoroughly and make twelve powders and give 
one every two hours. Give injections high up in the bowels. Sometimes 
an injection of sulphocarbolate of zinc is good. Use twenty grains in a pint 
of water. A fountain syringe should be used. Oil of fireweed every three 
hours is also good. Give five drops on a lump of sugar. 

Homeopathic Treatment. — For the griping and straining give the third 
trituration of Mercurius Sol. The dose is one tablet every two to three 
hours. If the griping and straining are severe give the third trituration 
of Mercurius Cor., in the same way. If there is great thirst and restlessness 
and watery, bloody and burning stools give the third trituration of Arseni- 
cum in the same way. The Mercurius Sol. is generally the one to be given 
in the first stages. 

Nursing and Diet. — First find out what the patient has been eating to 
cause the attack and avoid it. I first like to give something to get rid of 
all putrid food in the bowels. Give half an ounce of castor oil to an adult 
or a teaspoonful to a baby. It will push out all irritating matter from 
the bowels and will frequently stop the worst attack and you can then give 
your medicines. Spiced syrup of rhubarb is a pleasant medicine for those 
who cannot take the castor oil. Oil of fireweed in five-drop doses on a little 
sugar, for an adult, is" very good when given four hours after the castor oil 
or the rhubarb is taken. You can give this every three hours if necessary. 



«S8 PEOPLE'S HOME MEDICAL BOOK. 

Do not feed any solid foods and give nothing at all if possible. If something 
is necessary give hot water or egg albumen or hot diluted milk. Barley 
water,, oatmeal water or rice water is good. Directions for making these 
will be found in the Nursing Department. Lime water mixed with the 
milk is good. Sometimes blackberry wine does good. It is a little astringent 
and is also a food. 

PEOPLE'S HOME REMEDIES.— 

1. Castor Oil and Paregoric — Flaxseed or Slippery Elm Tea. — If the 
case is not severe give a teaspoonful of castor oil and two teaspoonfuls o> 
paregoric once a day. Flaxseed or slippery elm tea may be drank. It is 
also well to inject the bowels with starch water with half a teaspoonful ol 
laudanum in it. 

2. Golden Seal. — A tea made of golden seal is an excellent injection 
ior chronic dysentery. 

Physician's Remark. — In large doses golden seal is constipating and it is 
a tonic to the membranes of the intestines. 

3. Blackberries. — Take two quarts of ripe blackberries, a pint of loaf 
sugar and one-half ounce each of cinnamon, cayenne, cloves and allspice. 
Boil these together; strain when cold and add a pint of fourth proof brandy. 
According to the age take from a tablespoonful to a wineglassful at a dose. 

Physician's Remark. — All these are stimulating and somewhat binding 
in their action. , 

4. Rhubarb. — If the case is not severe, burned rhubarb is good. (This 
as given under " Diarrhea.") 

Physician's Remark. — The rhubarb removes the irritating material from 
the bowels. 

6. Flaxseed or Slippery Elm Tea. — Watch the diet and after each 
movement of the bowels give an injection of flaxseed tea or slippery elm 
tea made from the water taken off of oatmeal. 

Physician's Remark. — This not only washes out the irritating material 
but* it is also soothing to the bowels. 

6. Golden Seal, Saleratus, Charcoal and Rhubarb. — For obstinate cases 
take half a teaspoonful of golden seal, a piece of saleratus the size of a hazel- 
nut and a tablespoonful each of powdered willow charcoal and turkey rhu- 
barb. Put these into a tumblerful of water and let stand for twelve hours. 
Stir and take a teaspoonful every four hours during the day. 

Physician's Remark. — Golden seal is a, little binding, charcoal is an anti- 
septic and rhubarb is laxative and rids the bowels of irritating material that 
is so often the cause of dysentery. 

7. Eggs.— Beat up an egg, with or without sugar, and take it at a single 
^Ip. It seems to form a coating on the stomach and intestines, lessen 
mflammation and effect a speedy cure. Two or three taken during the 
Any is generally all that is necessary. 

Physician's Remark. — This is easily digested and is not likely to irritate. 

B. Elm Bark, Rhubarb, Charcoal, Salt and Yolk of Egg. — Take pow- 
dered elm bark, rhubarb and charcoal, of each half an ounce; add a table- 
spoonful of common salt and the yolk of an egg and rub the whole together 
in a mortar until dry and reduced to a well-mixed powder. iSose A tea- 
spoonful three to six times a day, according to circumstances, in a little water 



INFECTIOUS AND CONTAGIOUS DISEASES. 6» 

or molasses. Valuable in dysentery or flux and in diarrhea. It seldom 
fails to cure. 

Physician's Remark. — The elm bark is soothing, the rhubarb is laxa- 
tive, the charcoal is antiseptic, the salt is astringent or binding and the egg 
is food. 

9. Camphor, Peppermint, Red Pepper, Etc.— Take one ounce each of 
laudanum, rhubarb, tincture of camphor, peppermint and red pepper. Give- 
twenty to thirty drops every half hour until relieved. 
Physician's Remark. — This is for adults only. 
. 10. Chickweed Tea. — Steep chickweed and drink of the tea. 
' 11. Hot Fomentations, Etc. — Much relief is generally obtained from, 
hot fomentations applied to the bowels by means of cloths wrung out of hot 
water and, when the bearing down is very severe and produces much suf- 
fering, make use of an occasional injection of twenty drops of laudanum to 
one or two tablespoonfuls of starch water or rice water. 

13. Oil of Fireweed. — Put five drops of oil of fireweed on sugar and 
take every one to three hours. 

Physician's Remark. — This is very good and you will notice that I have 
given it as one of the remedies used by myself and other doctors. 

13. Mountain Clove. — Use a root called " Mountain Clove." Chew the 
root or steep it and drink the tea. 

14. Hot Herb Tea. — Take a weed called " horse tail " which has a longr 
straight stalk with a feathery leaf and a slightly hot taste. Make a tea of 
this and drink a teacupful while hot. 

15. Pathweed Tea. — Make a tea of pathweed, using four ounces of the 
plant to a pint of water, and take two ounces at a dose tl.ree or four times a 
day. This is the dose for adults. 

SYPHILIS— POX— LUES.— (See Chapter for Men.) 

TUBERCULOSIS. 

Description. — ^This is an infectious disease in which there is local in» 
flammation followed by the development of dead tissue. Small nodules, 
called tubercles, develop and these have the appearance of gray, white or 
sometimes yellowish bodies. It is because of these tubercles that the name 
" tuberculosis " is given to this disease. 

Causes. — The disease is caused by the tuberculosis germs. These germs 
are always at hand and are constantly being taken into the system but the 
tissues of the body are not always in the right condition for them to take 
hold and develop. These germs are taken into the body in the air we 
breathe and in the food we eat. Milk from cows having tuberculosis is 
dangerous. A person may also accidentally become infected by the germs 
getting in through a sore or scratch on the body and the germs also gain 
admittance through the tonsils and back part of the throat. As before 
stated these germs are constantly being taken into our bodies, most com- 
monly by breathing, but when we are in health we are generally able to 
throw them off or at least the conditions are not favorable for their growth 
and development. It is like sowing seeds in the ground. They will not 
grow unless the conditions, such as heat and moisture, are right. The germs 



?0 PEOPLE'S HOME MEDICAL BOOK, 

will not grow in our systems unless we are in a weakened condition in some 
way or in some part of the body. 

Anything which weakens our vitality or impairs our health makes us 
more likely to take tuberculosis. All diseases which leave us in a weakened 
condition produce favorable conditions for these germs because our system 
is not then able to throw them off as they enter the body. Pneumonia, 
catarrh, grip, measles and whooping cough are particularly likely to leave 
the parts affected in a weak condition and render them more subject to 
tuberculosis. Breathing bad air, and particularly the air from a poorly 
ventilated room where many people are crowded together or the dusty, air 
of a city, is a source of great danger. The lack of proper exercise allows 
the lungs to become weakened, hence the blood is not purified and our 
health is weakened so that we are more likely to take this disease. Con- 
tinued heat also weakens the system and particularly if we are compelled 
at the same time to breathe impure air. Some people inherit a weak con- 
stitution and are thus more subject to the disease than one who is naturally 
robust. 

Age also has something to do with it. Children under ten years of age 
frequently have tuberculosis of the glands and bones and also of the mem- 
branes of the brain. After the age of puberty the lungs are the most fre- 
quently affected. Tuberculosis can affect almost any part of the body. It 
generally affects the weakest parts. After the age of thirty-five we are not 
so likely to take the disease and after the age of fifty a person seldom has 
it unless he had it before that time. It affects both sexes equally. Certain 
occupations such as stone cutting, knife grinding, mining, weaving and all 
pursuits which cause large quantities of dust to enter the lungs are par- 
ticularly dangerous. , 

We will first take up the symptoms of the different kinds of tuberculosis 
with something of the treatment of each and then discuss the prevention 
and general treatment of the disease together with the diet to be allowed 
the patient. 

Acute Miliary Tuberculosis. 

Description. — This consists of innumerable small tubercles in the lungs 
or other organs affected. 

Cause. — The tuberculosis bacilli or germs are the cause. They infect the 
organs and cause the tubercles. 

Symptoms. — The symptoms are like the symptoms of typhoid fever. 
The poison in the blood causes great wretchedness and the fever runs from 
103 to 103 degrees every morning. The pulse is rapid and there is often a 
great deal of sweating. These symptoms appear before there is illness in 
any particular part of the body to explain the sickness. The fever is irregular 
and can be lowered by sponging with cold water. In both of these respects 
it is unlike typhoid fever. Also, the rose spots are absent. A careful exam- 
ination of the lungs shows diseased spots. In some cases it comes on more 
suddenly. The patient is seized with a chill, which is followed by high fever 
or a rapid pulse. There is much sweating and great weakness. The patient 
is fearfully thin. The tongue is dry and cheeks flushed. When it is 
miliary tuberculosis of the lungs, the lung tissues are affected and there are 



INFECTIOUS AND CONTAGIOUS DISEASES. 71 

symptoms of acute bronchitis. The patients usually die in from one to 
three months. The disease is almost, if not always, fatal. 

Treatment. — Give nourishing food and stimulants. Chloral hydrate and 
the bromides are given to relieve the restlessness. 

Scrofula — Tuberculosis of the Lymph Glands. 

Description. — This is often a very mild form of tuberculosis and but a 
small percentage of the patients die with it. In exceptional cases we find 
nearly all the lymph glands of the body affected while other parts of the 
body' are affected but little, if any. We will treat of several forms of this 
disease. 

Local Tuberculosis — Adenitis (Glands). 

1. Cervical or Neck Glands. — This is the most common form met with 
In children. It is particularly frequent among those who are in poor circum- 
stances and have poor surroundings. The enlarged glands are commonly 
called " kernels." Sometimes they run together and form large lumps. 
Matter forms and runs from them and they later heal up and leave a scar. 

3. Trachea-Bronchial. — The glands of the windpipe and bronchial 
tubes sometimes become large and press very much upon the blood vessels 
of the chest and also upon the nerves. Sometimes they burst into other 
organs like the gullet or they may infect the lungs and pleura. They also 
frequently cause pericarditis by coming in contact with or breaking into the 
membrane which surrounds the heart. They become very dangerous when 
they infect the whole system through the blood vessels. 

3. Mesenteric, or "Tabes Mesenterica." — The mesentery is the struc- 
ture which is intertwined among the intestines. This disease was called 
" abdominal scrofula " by the old writers. The glands in the membrane 
between and around the bowels become enlarged and cheesy and occasionally 
they form matter and become hard. Upon examination after death a slight 
form of this disease is often found in children who have died of other 
diseases. The disease is very common in children and seriously interferes 
with nutrition so that the little ones become puny, wasted and bloodless. 
The abdomen is enlarged and bloated, there is constant diarrhea and the 
stools are thin and have a bad odor. General wasting away and weakness are 
the most characteristic features. Children with this disease are improperly 
said to have consumption of the bowels. In adults it may occur alone or in 
connection with lung disease. 

Water on the Brain — Tubercular Meningitis — Basilar Meningitis. 

Description. — This is also known as acute hydrocephalus. It is really 
an acute tuberculosis in which the membranes of the brain and sometimes 
the spinal cord are mostly affected. It is much more common in children 
than in adults. It rarely occurs during the first year but is more frequent 
between the second and fifth years. In a majority of cases old tuberculous 
trouble in the bronchial and mesenteric glands is found. 

Symptoms. — There has been failing health for several weeks or the child 
may be getting over measles or whooping cough. Sometimes it has prev- 
iously had a bad fall. The child is listless, peevish, irritable and has lost its 



?2 PEOPLE'S HOME MEDICAL BOOK 

appetite. The symptoms pointing to the disease may then set in suddenly 
with convulsions, or more commonly with headache, vomiting and fever. The 
pain may be intense and agonizing. The child puts its hand to its head and 
gives a sharp sudden cry and sometimes screams. It is usually constipated 
and there is slight fever which gradually rises to 103 or 103 degrees. The pulse 
is rapid at first but later becomes irregular and slow. During sleep the child 
is restless and disturbed with twitching of the muscles and sudden start- 
ings, or it may wake up in great terror. In the early stages the pupils of 
the eyes are contracted. The first stage is the stage of irritation. 

During the second stage of the disease these symptoms disappear. The 
abdomen (or belly) is drawn in, the bowels are constipated, the child is dull, 
and when aroused is more or less delirious. The head is often drawn back 
or to the side and the child utters an occasional cry. The pupils are en- 
larged or irregular and a squint may develop. Convulsions may come on or 
the muscles of one side or limb may become rigid. During the last period 
or stage of paralysis the stupor, or deep drowsiness, increases and the child 
cannot be aroused. Convulsions are rather frequent and there is a sudden 
drawiiig up of the muscles of the back and neck or the spasms may occur 
on one side only. The pupils are enlarged, the eyelids partly closed and there 
is rolling of the eyeballs. There may be diarrhea, the pulse is rapid and the 
child sinks gradually away. The disease lasts from 3 to 4 weeks. It is 
fatal in most cases. 

Tuberculosis of the Pleura — Acute Tuberculosis of the Pleura. 

The acute kinds are rarely fatal. The secondary kind is very common 
and frequently occurs when there is tuberculosis of the lungs. 

Tuberculosis of the Pericardium. 

This may be primary or it may be secondary from other affected parts. 
It is not so common as tuberculosis of the pleura and peritoneum. 

Tuberculosis of the Peritoneum. 

It frequently occurs in connection with miliary and chronic tuberculosis 
of the lungs but may occur in itself apart from other organs. People of all 
ages are subject to it and it is common in children with bowel and mesen- 
teric disease. 

Symptoms. — It is very difficult to distinguish this disease. When it 
comes on slowly the symptoms resemble typhoid fever. There is frequently 
some bloating or dropsy of the abdomen or belly. Wind-dropsy, or tym- 
panites, may also be present. Sometimes the fever is slight but in acute 
cases it is often 103 to 104 degrees. The physician may use the tuberculosis 
test in this disease. 

Galloping Consumption— Acute Pneumonic Tuberculosis of the Lungs. 

This is met with both in children and adults. There are two types — 
Pneumonic and Broncho-Pneumonic. 

Symptoms of Pneumonic Form.— The symptoms are somewhat like pneu- 
monia but between the 8th and 10th days instead of getting better they be- 



INFECTIOUS AND CONTAGIOUS DISEASES. 73 

come worse. The fever is irregular, the pulse more rapid, there is spitting: 
of mucus and pus and there may be sweating. Signs occur indicating soften- 
ing of the lungs and death may occur even in the second or third weelc and 
before softening of the lungs. In other cases the upper part of the lungs 
is destroyed and tlie case may drag along for two or three months or it 
may become a case of common consumption. 

Symptoms of Broncho-Pneumonic Form or Capillary Bronchitis. — This 
is more common in children and forms the majority of the cases of gallop- 
ing consumption. The symptoms vary greatly in different cases. In chil- 
dren the disease is most likely to follow some infectious disease like measles 
or whooping cough. The child may be taken suddenly ill while teething 
or when recovering from the attack of some fever. The fever rises rapidly, 
the cough is severe and a rattling breathing is noticed at one or both points 
of the lungs. Or the child may be taken ill when getting better from some 
other infectious disease. There will be fever, coughing and shortness of 
breath. These symptoms lessen within two weeks. There is loss of flesh 
and the general condition is bad. The child has sweats, the fever becomes 
hectic, that is, a hectic, or red spot appears on the cheeks and the child has 
the usual consumptive look. 

Chronic Ulcerative Tuberculosis of the Lungs. 

Physical examination sTiows the parts that are affected. There is a 
hardness of the lungs and they contain cavities. 

Symptoms. — There may be a troublesome pain early in the disease or this 
may be absent. The cough is one of the earliest symptoms and is present 
in the majority of cases from the beginning to the end of the disease. The 
sputum, or spit, varies greatly but it contains the bacilli or germs. There is 
often hemorrhage or spitting of blood from the lungs. This is called " Hemop- 
tysis. "^ There is fever and difficult breathing. The sweating is distressing 
and weakening. 

Tuberculosis of the Liver. 

This does not occur alone but as a part of a general miliary tuberculosis. 

Tuberculosis of the Joints and Spine. 
These will be treated in another place. 

THE TREATMENT OF TUBERCULOSIS. 

Preventive Treatment. — A person with tuberculosis should expectorate 
(spit) into cloths or into paper spitting cups and then before the sputum or 
spit dries these should be burned. The sputum or spit can only spread the 
disease when it is dry. Sunlight, nourishing food and outdoor life, are the 
best preventives. Breathe plenty of fresh air and especially should the 
sleeping room be well ventilated. A boy or girl who is weak and sicklv 
looking should be in the open air most of the time. Girls, at the time their 
menses are beginning,- should take all the care possible to keep themselves 
strong and healthy and especially if there has been any tuberculosis in the 



74 PEOPLE'S HOME MEDICAL BOOK 

family. Sunshine and air make people strong:. In the tenement districts 
of our cities many people are crowded into a few rooms that often are dirty 
and unventilated and oftentimes eight or ten or more sleep in one small 
room with scarcely any ventilation. Their food is unwholesome and often 
small in quantity and yet many of thqm have to work all day and part of 
the night for even such a living as this. Such conditions are particularly 
favorable for the development of tuberculosis or consumption. To crowd 
too many children into a school building is poor policy and to overwork them 

lis just as bad and especially when it is considered that many of them are 
improperly nourished. I once knew of a young man who was ambitious 
for an education but the only way to get it was to earn it himself. He was 
apparently the picture of health and was much stronger than the average 
college student. He loaded himself down with studies and after school hours 
and on Saturdays he worked at hard manual labor to earn money for him- 
self and for his people at home whom he had to help support. His lessons were 
read at night and in some way he also managed to take music lessons as 
he was naturally a fine singer. He seldom got more than five or six hours 
sleep and often not that while doing the hardest kind of mental and physical 
labor. Often but a sandwich or a few crackers made up his meal and some- 
times he would skip a meal. Within one year from this time his school 
mates and teachers were very much surprised and pained to learn that he 
had been sent home to die v/ith consumption. Learning is worth getting but 
we can pay too high a price for even an education. 

Then, if you would prevent consumption, live in the open air and sun- 
shine as much as possible, take at least enough exercise to keep healthy, have 
plenty of ventilation in your houses and especially in the sleeping rooms, eat 
plenty of nourishing food and do not break down your health with work, 
worry or bad habits. 

General Treatment. — With nourishing foods and proper conditions make 
the patient grow fat and the local disease will take care of itself. Place the 
patient where he will get plenty of nourishing food and where the surround- 
ings will be as pleasant and cheerful as possible. Give proper open air 
treatment. Live out door in the fresh air and sunshine and sleep in a tent 
or with the windows open so as to allow plenty of fresh air. Go to a tuber- 
culosis sanitarium if you can or go to a climate where the temperature is 

• even and the atmospherf' pure. Have plenty of fresh air, sunshine and a 
nourishing diet. Milk, eggs, cereals, beef, etc., are good foods if they agree 
with the patient. 

We herewith give a nourishing diet for tuberculosis patients. It may 
be varied to suit the individual case. 



DIET FOR TUBERCULOSIS PATIENT. 

Breakfast. — Sip a cupful of hot milk in the morning before rising; rest 
in bed for 15 to 20 minutes ; then bathe or be bathed and clothed by another. 
For breakfast eat wheaten grits, oatmeal or some other cereal. If the appe- 
tite is good a tender chop or small piece of steak may be eaten. Tea or 
coffee may be drank unless they make the patient nervous. An orail^'e or 
some other fruit may be eaten if desired. The patient should not eat so 
much as to make the meal lay heavy on the stomach. 



INFECTIOUS AND CONTAGIOUS DISEASES. 75 

Half way between breakfast and the mid-day meal he should eat a light 
luncheon consisting of a cup of broth, a piece of toast, a glass of koumyss 
or a sandwich made with scraped beef or, if he tires of this, a sandwich made 
with toast and either anchovy or caviar may be substituted. Often an egg, 
either raw or cooked, may be taken between meals with advantage. If 
desired, a glass of sherry or some red wine may also be taken at this time 
or, in its place, some Scotch or rye whisky may be given. 

Dinner. — This should be the heaviest meal and should be eaten between 
13 and 2 o'clock. Some imtritious and somewhat stimulating soup that is 
easily digested may be eaten first. This may be followed with a small piece 
of fresh fish and then by a hearty course of any one of the roasts or broiled 
meats accompanied by two or three wholesome vegetables such as potatoes, 
string beans, asparagus, spinach, carrots, etc., and also macaroni or similar 
foods. Particularly if the patient is accustomed to stimulants with his meals, 
a little sherry wine or whiskey and water may be taken. Cornstarch or rice 
pudding or some similar dessert may also be eaten. 

During the afternoon a light luncheon similar to the forenoon lunch 
may be taken two or three hours after dinner. 

Evening Meal, — This should be a light meal consisting of arrowroot, or 
an egg cooked in some simple way, or a few stewed oysters or milk toast. 

Again, before going to bed at night, a cup of broth, a glass of koumyss, 
a cup of hot milk or some curds and whey may be taken. 

This diet is intended for a person with good^digestion. 

MEDICINES FOR TUBERCULOSIS. 

For the Blood. — Arsenic may be given in small doses in the form of 
Fowler's solution of arsenic. Give 5 drops, four times a day. 

For the Heart. — If necessary, give tincture of digitalis in 3 or 3 drop 
doses, 3 times a day. 

For the Night Sweats. — Give from 15 to 30 grains of camphoric acid 3 
or 3 hours before the time for the sweat. Or, in its place, give 1/120 of a 
grain of atropine. 

For the Fever. — Sponge with tepid or warm water and alcohol. 

For the Cough. — If necessary, give fron. 1/24 to 1/16 of a grain of 
heroin 3 or 4 times in 34 hours. If the cough is dry and irritable use the 
steam kettle. Put from 1/2 to 1 dram each of creosote, oil of pine and oil 
of eucalyptus into a teakettle of hot water and let the patient inhale the- 
steam. One end of a roll of paper may be put over the spout of the kettle 
and the patient may breathe through the nose and mouth from the other end. 

For the Vomiting. — If the stomach is irritated give from 3 to 5 grains 
of subnitrate of bismuth and 1 to 3 grains of oxalate of cerium an hour before 
meals. If the stomach is depressed give 1 to 2 drops of Fowler's solution 
of arsenic before meals. 

For the Bleeding from the Lungs. (Hasmoptysis.) — If the patient is 
much frightened give a hypodermic injection of % of a grain of morphine. 

Treatment of the Cervical Glands. — Surgeons advise cutting them out 
but in many cases this is not necessar)^ The homeopathic treatment is by 
use of the 6th trituration of Calcarea Carb. Give 3 tablets four times a 
day. I know this to be good for I have often used it with success.

PEOPLE'S HOME REMEDIES FOR CONSUMPTION AND ITS AT- 
TENDING AILMENTS.— 

1. Blood Root, Wild Cherry, Etc. — Take tincture of blood root and 
muriate of ammonia, of each 1 dram ; fluid extract of wild cherry, 3 drams ; 
and infusion of licorice, % pint. Mix and give a tablespoonful every two 
hours. 

2. For the Bleeding from the Lungs. — Give a little salt water or a 
tea made of equal parts of bugle weed and beth root. 

3. For the Cough. — An excellent remedy is a tea made from the leaves 
of white horehonnd and sweetened with honey. 

4. For the Cough. — Teas made from flaxseed, quince seed, slippery 
elm or marshmallow will prove excellent for the cough. 

5. Cod Liver Oil. — A tablespoonful or more three times a day, is a 
treatment used a great deal by physicians. 

6. For Scrofula. — Take one ounce of the dried or two ounces of fresh 
yellow dock root and boil in a pint of water. This may be taken in 2 ounce 
doses as often as the stomach will bear. The skin may also be bathed with 
this tea. This is a very effective remedy for scrofula. 

Physician's Remark. — Yellow dock root is very good for the blood. 

7. For Scrofula. — Take one part of finely powdered saltpeter, and two 
parts each pf licorice root, sulphur and cream of tartar ; mix with honey until it 
is like mud. Take a teaspoonful before each meal for three days, then leave 
C& for three days, and so continue until cured. If the bowels are too loose 
after taking the first three days, then reduce the dose one half. This treat- 
ment has effected some remarkable cures after other remedies had failed. 

8. For White Swelling and Scrofula. — Boil in a little water a good 
sized handful each of the bruised roots and twigs of bitter sweet, the inner 
bark of sweet elder, and mullein leaves ; add half a handful of golden seal root, 
two rounded teaspoonfuls of mutton tallow and the same quantity of fresh 
unsalted butter. Stew these together until dry, being careful not to burn. 
Strain, put back on the stove and add a tablespoonful of beeswax and half 
a tablespoonful of pine pitch. Spread on a cloth and apply to white swelling 
or put on cotton and apply to the sores of scrofula. 

Physician's Remark. — White swelling is tuberculosis of the knee joint. 



TYPHOID FEVER, 
Enteric Fever. 

Description. — This is an acute infectious disease formerly called ." En- 
teric Fever " because the bowels are so much involved. 

Causes. — It is caused by the entrance into the body of a certain germ 
known to doctors as the bacillus typhosus. These germs gain entrance 
through the mouth, stomach and intestines. They are frequently taken into 
the system by drinking infected milk or milk that has been " watered " with 
impure water or cooled with infected ice. The freezing of the water in which 
the germs are found does not kill the germs. Water which comes from 
wells near cess pools or from shallow wells or wells that have not been 
cleaned for a long time o'- water which comes from rivers where the garbage 



INFECTIOUS AND CONTAGIOUS DISEASES. 77 

of a city is emptied is very likely to be contaminated and cause typhoid fever 
if a person is in the right condition to take it. Partially decayed vegetables, 
meats, oysters or clams are also likely to be swarming with the gernis. Flies 
lighting upon the discharges from a typhoid fever patient, if the discharges 
have not been disinfected, very frequently carry the germs to pure food and 
thus spread the disease. Another source of typhoid fever is in decaying 
vegetables in cellars or cellars where the drains are stopped up and water 
is allowed to stand. 

SYMPTOMS. — This disease affects males more than females and is most 
frequent in August, September and October. The germs may be found in 
every organ of the body. The small bowels and their glands are generally 
the organs most affected. The disease is generally from 1 to 3 weeks in 
coming on. It usually begins with a feeling or sense of general wretchedness 
and general illness with no particular symptoms being well marked unless 
it be the aching of the forehead and of the back and limbs. The expression 
of the face shows sickness very early in the disease. The patient becomes 
listless and later heavy and stupid and often a little deaf. Frequently there 
is considerable coughing without spitting up anything. The tongue is coated 
in the center but clean and red at the edges. There is headache, thirst, sleep- 
lessness, and a mild fever develops and nose bleed may occur repeatedly.. 
There is quite a bit of gurgling in the lower right part of the abdomen^ 
There is usually constipation during the first week but on the other hand 
there may be looseness of the bowels instead. 

Fev'er. — The temperature rises step by step ; each morning it is higher 
than the morning before and each evening higher than the evening before. 
For example, the first morning it may be 99 and in the evening 100; the 
second morning it may be 99% and in the evening 101%; the third morning 
it may be 100% and in the evening lOS^/^, etc. Usually by the end of the first 
week the fever reaches 103 or 103 in the mornings and 103 or 104 in 
the evenings and remains at this level until the 14th or 21st day. At this. 
time the pulse is more rapid and varies from 90 to 100 and may go up to 
110 or higher. 

Rose Spots. — These develop about the Tth to the 9th day and appear on 
the skin of the abdomen and chest. 

Later Symptoms. — The tongue becomes dry and cracked, the stupor or 
drowsiness is more marked, the bowels become looser and the bloating of the 
abdomen, or belly, is more noticeable. Usually, at the end of the second week 
the disease is at its height. If the patient has had little attention or if it 
is a severe case it will continue another week or longer. During the third 
week there is more diarrhea and bloating and a deeper drowsiness. There 
is shaking of the muscles and jerking' of the tendons. The skin is dry and 
harsh and the patient is very thin. If the disease is not so severe these 
symptoms may decrease at any time between the 14th and 28th days. The 
fever and pulse then gradually go down and there are general symptoms of 
getting better. This is a typical case. 

In some cases the diarrhea is very bad. In others there is greater bloat- 
ing and soreness of the bowels. Sometimes the tongue and mouth look very 
bad. The blood poisoning is very severe in some cases as shown by the 
symptoms. Sometimes the tongue is very much swollen, coated and cracked 
and sticks to the mouth or turns down on the lips so that it is very difficult 
for the pati«nt to put out his tongue and sometimes when it is out the patient 



^a PEOPLE'S HOME MEDICAL BOOK 

is too stupid to draw it in again. The delirium is either mild or active accord- 
ing 'to the case. The patient is said to be delirious or "out of his head." 
Bleeding- from the bowels is a dangerous symptom. The bowels are very 
thin and ulcerated and may be easily torn or ruptured. 

TREATMENT.— 

Preventive. — Disinfect all discharges from the patient. The vessels which 
receive the discharges from the bowels and urine should contain a carbolic 
acid solution, 1 part of acid to 30 parts of w^ter; or, a solution of corrosive 
sublimate, 1 part corrosive sublimate to 2,000 parts of water. A heaping tea- 
spoonful of chloride of lime may also be used to a pint of water. Disinfect 
everything that has been in contact with the patient. The hands of the 
nurse should frequently be disinfected. See that all drinking water is boiled. 
To prevent taking the disease, read up on the causes and avoid them. 

" What to Do." — Disinfect, all discharges and everything that comes in 
contact with the patient. Always use a bed pan when the patient stools or 
passes water as getting up may rupture the bowels which are very thin at this 
time. Give the very best of nursing, be very careful, of the diet, boil all drink' 
ing water and follow all instructions of the doctor very carefully. 

" What Not to Do." — Do not let the patient take cold or some of the 
serious after effects like bronchitis or pneumonia may be the result. Do 
not allow the patient to get up for any purpose or the bowels may be rup- 
tured. Do not give solid foods until two or three weeks after the patient 
has recovered. Do riot allow your sympathies or the pleadings of the pa- 
tient to persuade you to depart from this rule or death may be the result. 

Avoid too much strong medicine. Stimulants may be given if the pulse 
is very weak and the first heart sound distant and feeble. Half an ounce of 
whiskey or brandy may be given in a little water or milk every 3 to 6 hours 
if needed. 

Constipation. — Relieve this with injections of soap and water. In obsti- 
nate cases add to this from 1 to 3 teaspoonfuls of glycerine. 

Diarrhea. — If this is excessive, that is, if there is more than 3 or 4 stools 
a day, give from 5 to 10 drop doses of aromatic sulphuric acid in simple 
elixir or in boiled water. 

Bloating.--To the abdomen, or belly, apply cloths wrung out of water 
containing a little turpentine. If possible, apply these before much gas has 
accumulated and if the bloating continues give an injection of emulsion of 
asafoetida either with or without a dram of turpentine added. 

Bleeding from the Bowels. — Apply hot water bottles to keep up the heat 
of the body and give a pint of normal salt solution under the skin. This may 
be given once, twice or three times during the next 24 hours if needed. 

Bed Sores. — Keep the parts clean and dry and bathe with alcohol. 

Curds in Stools. — When curds appear in the stools, lessen the quantity 
of milk; or, it should be peptonized or its digestion aided by the use of 
pancreatin after it is taken. 

Allopathic Treatment. — Unless the bowels have moved give 5/4 grain 
doses of calomel every hour until 1 to 2 grains have been taken. If the 
bowels arenot moved in 13 hours give a large injection of soap and water 
and a seidlitz powder if needed. Twelve houjs later give from 5 to 10 drops 
of dilute hydrochloric acid with a teaspoonful of essence of pepsin and repeat 
this every six hours, after giving food, throughout the disease. 



INFECTIOUS AND CONTAGIOUS DISEASES. 79 

Nursing. — A typhoid fever case must be watched carefully from begin- 
ning to end. Bleeding fro,m the bowels is an alarming symptom. It shows 
that the disease has eaten through the lining of the bowels to the small blood 
vessels. It is not necessarily fatal but it needs close attention. A fall of 
several degrees" in the fever should arouse suspicion that the bowels are 
much ulcerated and are bleeding. This fall in the fever is often the first 
symptom. Either during or after an attack of typhoid the patient may have 
hemorrhage or bleeding from the bowels; or, he may have heart, stomach 
or liver troubles or bronchitis or pneumonia and symptoms of these should be 
carefully watched for. 

A doctor, a friend of mine, was attending a case of typhoid fever. He 
warned the woman not to get out of bed for any purpose as it might cause 
bleeding from the bowels. His orders were disobeyed and the woman got 
up to use the vessel. A hemorrhage of the bowels was the result and the 
patient was dead before the doctor could arrive. No comment is needed. 

If the fever rises to 103^ degrees the patient is to be rubbed with 
either tepid, cool, cold, or ice water. Or even a piece of ice may be used. 
Give a brisk rub-oflf if the poisoning is very great, not so much to reduce the 
fever as to cause reaction and arouse the vitality of the patient. With this 
application of cold, in different degrees according to the needs of the case, 
rub the skin actively as the cold comes in contact with it because friction 
increases the loss of heat by one half and aids in causing reaction and a 
more equal circulation of the skin and also prevents the patient from being 
chilled. There are other ways of bathing. Some put the patient in a 
bath tub. 

Nursing and Diet. — The diet is very important in this disease. It should 
be a milk diet for the first week and often for most of the second week. From 
a quart to a quart and a half a day may be given. Give a little every three 
or fours hours and follow with the acid and pepsin before mentioned unless 
the stomach is irritable when a little lime water may be given instead, or a 
little ceiestin vichy may be used. When the milk is digested with difficulty, 
add to it some hot water or dilute it with carbonated water or water con- 
taining a little baking soda. If the taste is unpleasant to the patient it may 
be flavored with vanilla or nutmeg. Coffee, tea or cocoa in very small 
amounts may sometimes be given. Well boiled rice strained through a fine 
sieve, and even cornstarch or strained barley gruel, if well cooked, may be 
given at this time with advantage, particularly, if at the same time a little 
taka-diastase is used to aid their digestion. Broths and meat soups are not 
advisable as they often tend to increase the bloating. 

A typhoid fever patient is going to be sick for several weeks and you 
need to keep up his strength by the use of food and bathing. Milk is gener- 
ally the best food when given as directed above. Keep visitors out of the 
sick room, do not talk much and never whisper when near the patient. It is 
better to talk in a low tone than to whisper. Keep the teeth and mouth 
clean. You may need to clean them several times a day. Wrap a soft 
cloth around your finger, dip into water arid gently clean the teeth and 
mouth. The patient's mouth and tongue are always dry and especially when 
the mouth is kept open and should then be frequently cleaned with a wet 



80 PEOPLE'S HOME MEDICAL BOOK. 

cloth or a little water should often be given him. You can bathe him under 
the bedding and with cool water if he can stand it. Wring out the cloth or 
sponge so it will not drip water and bathe part of his body at a time and then 
dry. Keep the patient quiet and never let him get up to use the bed pan. If 
there is bleeding send for the doctor at once. 

Follow the directions given as to food and when the patient is getting 
better never yield to his pleadings for more food. Follow the doctor's ad- 
vice and give no solid food for some weeks after the fever is all gone. I never 
shall forget a minister who died of typhoid fever in my old home town. He 
was about well and one day while yet in bed he told the doctor that he 
wanted an old fashioned " boiled dinner." The doctor refused to give his 
consent to this, saying it would kill him. But the home people listened to the 
pleadings of the minister after the doctor had left and finally yielded to his 
persuasions. The minister got his " boiled dinner " and in a few days he was 
a dead minister. I was very young then and could not understand for many 
years why God should have taken that good man. The case was simitar to 
the one I have previously related of the child that ate green apples and 
died of cholera infantum. It was not God but the " boiled dinner "' that killed 
the minister. 

I had carried a very bad case of typhoid fever in a young lady through 
five long weary weeks and the patient was recovering nicely so that I was 
then visiting her every second or third day only. One Sunday evening I was 
hastil}' called to her home and found that she was " flighty." She imagined 
that she saw flies and all sorts of creatures on the walls and ceiling. I ask'ed 
for the cause of this but the family could not account for it and said they 
bad disobeyed none of my instructions. I knew, however, that it is a cus- 
tom of many farmers to have a great deal of company on Sundays and 
asked if this was not the case here. I found that my suspicions were true 
and that a number of persons had been admitted to the sick room, thus excit- 
ing and tiring the patient. This was what caused the relapse and flighti- 
ness of the patient. Thereafter they were more careful about admitting 
visitors to the sick room until the patient had more fully recovered. Too 
much care cannot be exercised in tjie treatment of this disease. 

In typhoid fever, careful feeding is of the utmost importance. I once had 
a typhoid patient, a girl, who could take scarcely any food. In four weeks 
sickness she did not take and retain more than two quarts of liquid nourish- 
ment. I finally stopped trying to force her to take food and gave plenty of 
good water. She was very thin when the fever left her but she recovered 
nicely. 

After Effects.— During or after typhoid the patient is likely to have 
hemorrhage or bleeding from the bowels; heart, stomach or liver trowble: 
bronchitis or pneumonia. To avoid these do not allow the patient to get up 
out of bed for any purpose, do not give too strong medicine and do not let 
the patient take cold. 

TYPHUS FEVER. 

Typhus' fever is an acute infectious disease. 

Cause. — Unsanitary conditions. 

Symptoms. — The disease comes on quife suddenly. There is a chill 
headache, backache, weakness and a high fever. The fever usually runs 
from 103 to 107 degrees. The pulse is full and rapid and not so feeble as in 



INFECTIOUS AND CONTAGIOUS DISEASES. 81 

typhoid fever. The face is deeply flushed and there is an eruption on the 
abdomen, or belly, in from 3 to 5 days. If the patient survives, the fever 
usually ends in from 12 to 14 days. It decreases rapidly at this time. 
TREATMENT.— 

The treatment should be similar to that of typhoid fever. 

Preventive. — Fresh air and sunshine. 

BLOOD POISONING. 
Toxemia — Septicemia and Pyemia. 

Description. — Septicemia means putrid material in the blood. Pyemia 
means pus in the blood. These are old names and toxemia is the better 
term. 

Cause. — It generally is caused by tjoisoninof from diseases such as ab- 
scesses, carbuncles, boils, appendicitis r mastoid disease or from an injury 
like a splinter in the finger or a nail in le foot. 

Symptoms. — Chills are more or less severe. There is fever, sweats, 
stupor, prostration, a general " all in " feeling, unconsciousness and death- 
Some cases are slower and may be called sub-acute or chronic. 
TREATMENT.— 

Preventive. — Suppose you have stejjped on a nail and run it into your 
foot, or opened a can and cut yourself. The hand or foot gets sore. Open 
the wound thoroughly with an instrument that has been placed in boiling 
water for at least five minutes so as to kill all germs. Wash th.e sore with 
gauze or clean lineo and an antiseptic solution or if you have no antiseptics 
use hot boiled water. If a nail has been run into the foot put on a hot bread 
and milk poultice,, change it often and keep it on till it bleeds freely. Then 
put on salt pork. If tlie nail went into the fore part of the foot look out for 
trouble on top of the foot in a few days. If it becomes sore it must be opened, 
cleansed and drainedi. Keep it open so that it can drain and do not try to 
heal it u,p outside too soon. By such care at the beginning many cases of 
blood poisoning can be prevented. If you have an abscess it should be opened 
thoroughly, drained and kept drained. Cleanliness of instrument, person, 
and coverings is essential. Externally it should be kept clean with hot water. 
, Treatment after Poisoning. — Remove the foreign body and give free 
drainage and do not try to close the sore. After the parts have been washed 
out thoroughly with an antiseptic and cleaned with clean tools, put on steri- 
lized absorbent cotton. Use plenty of gauze over the cotton and then apply 
adhesive plaster to hold it on. Keep the wound open so that it can dis- 
charge. If it throbs it should be opened and dressed again. Be sure that the 
splinter, bee sting or other foreign body has been removed. 

CHOLERA. 

t Asiatic Cholera. 

Description. — This term is used to designate a disease characterized by 
watery purging, cramps, vomiting and extreme prostration. 

Cause. — ^This disease is due to infection of the bowels by specific micro- 
organisms or germs called " Spirillum Cholerse Asiatic." 

Symptoms. — The symptoms come on in from a few hours to 10 days 
after infection. The first symptom is a watery diarrhea. The patient suffers 
from weakness and depression and if the passages from the bowels are very 

« 



83 PEOPLE'S HOME MEDICAL BOOK. 

great he suffers from great feebleness and even collapse with but little or no 
symptoms of the coming on of the disease. The patient is taken suddenly 
with active vomiting and purging, severe cramps and collapse. Some cases 
are more m.ild. If the case is severe it is always very serious. 

TREATMENT.— Keep up the strength and treat according to the 
symptoms.. 

Homeopathic Treatment. — Third trituration of Arsenicum ; second dilu- 
ton of Veratrum Alb.; Camphor Tincture. (For preparation and doses see 
" Homeopathic Medicines " in Nursing Department.) 

PEOPLE'S HOME REMEDIES.— 

1. Tincture of Camphor. — At the first appearance of the symptonjs 
put the patient to bed and keep him quiet. Every two to five minutes give 
one drop of tincture of camphor on a small piece of sugar and every 15 or 20 
minutes give some brandy and water if the patient can retain it. When the 
patient is in a perspiration begin to give the medicine less frequently.. Allow 
him to sweat eight or ten hours. 

2. Preventive. — Tincture of camphor internally in one-drop doses twice 
a day is a preventive of this disease. Another preventive is to put half a 
teaspoonful of flowers of sulphur into each stocking. To stop the vomiting 
in the second stage give a teaspoonful of the following mixture every five to 
fifteen minute^ — salt and black pepper, of each 1 dram; vinegar, 5 drams 
and hot water, 4 ounces. For the cramps rub the limbs vigorously with the 
hands or warm flannels. Rub tincture of capsicum (red pepper) along thS 
spine and follow with a mustard poultice. During the third stage wrap the 
patient in wet hot blankets and give a mixture of one part of tincture of 
camphor and three parts of prickly ash berries. Give from a teaspoonful 
to a tablespoonful in water every ten to twenty minutes. Brandy may also 
be given. _ , 

3. Cayenne Pepper and Camphor Gum. — Into a teacup two-thirds full 
of hot water stir 20 grains of cayenne pepper and 10 grains of powdered 
camphor gum. The dose is a teaspoonful ?very hour or oftener if necessary. 

BUBONIC PLAGUE. 
The Plague— Black Death. 

Description. — This is a specific contagious disease occurring chiefly in 
(insanitary surroundings. It is attended with high fever and skirt troubles 
such as carbuncles, boils or buboes. It occurs in epidemics or sweeps over 
a country and runs a rapid and severe course. 

History. — The plague is an oriental or eastern disease and has long ex- 
isted in certain portions of India. Most European countries have at some 
time been visited by epidemics of this dreadful malady. Probably the most 
famous epidemic of the Black Death was in Europe in the 14th century. More 
than 70,000 died in 1665 during another outbreak in London. Another severe 
epidemic visited Hong Kong and Canton, China in 1894. The disease was 
brought to these cities from Northern India. One hundred and eighty thou- 
sand people died in Canton. In September of 1896 the disease appeared in 
Bombay and the plague statistics for the Bombay district from Sept. 1896 
to Jan. 13, 1899 are 169,240 deaths out of 214,197 cases. According to Koch 
there are three great central plague locations. One is in Mesopotamia, one 
in Assir and one in Thibet. There is also a plague district in German East

s 



Africa. San Francisco has had some cases in recent years but by sanitary 
measures it was readily stamped out. 

Cause. — The disease is caused by special organisms or germs called 
" bacilli pestis bubonica;." Inside the body the germs have been found in 
the lungs, enlarged glands, pus from the buboes, the blood and other internal 
organs. Outside the body they are found in dust, excreta, food, soil, and in 
infected rats and flies. According to Koch the germs get into the body 
through the digestive tract by being taken in food, through the respiratory 
tract or by breathing, and by inoculation. The plague is spread by the two 
principal agents, men and rats. In almost all outbreaks affecting man, rats 
had the disease before and during the epidemic. The rat carries the disease 
from house to house and of course man carries it longer distances. Flies, 
fleas, ants and other insects also carry the disease and especially from rats 
to men. Mice, dogs, cats, horses and pigs also become infected and die of 
the disease. These, both before and after death, transmit the disease to 
healthy animals and to man. The disease is frequently carried by ships 
and by merchandise, clothing, etc. 

Symptoms. — It is from 3 to 7 days coming on. There is pallor, head- 
ache and dizziness. The person walks as though intoxicated. The disease 
may come on abruptly with bilious vomiting, chills and recurring shiverings. 
The fever rises rapidly to 103 or 104 degrees or even to 106 degrees. The pulse 
becomes rapid and thread-like. There is stupor and the patient may be delir- 
ious. The patient may now become very weak and maj- die during the first 
period of the disease. More commonly the patient survives this threatened 
collapse and then ffom the second to the fifth day appear the buboes or inflam- 
mation of the lymph glands. These glands may enlarge gradually or rapidly 
and are usually quite painful. These enlarged glands may disappear or they 
may remain unchanged, particularly in fatal cases. Pus jnay form and some- 
times, but rarely, gangrene may occur, forming the so-called carbuncle. The 
latter may also appear as gangrenous patches over the trunk and legs. In 
the worst cases there is bleeding from the lungs, stomach and intestines. 
There are two forms of the plague that affect man. One affects the lym- 
phatic glands and the other affects the lungs. Plague-pneumonia is common 
in certain epidemics. The duration of the disease in fatal cases is from 3 
to 5 days. On the other hand cases that tend to recovery may be prolonged, 
on account of the forming of pus in the buboes, to a few weeks or even 
months. The percentage of deaths is from 40 to 90 per cent. The forma- 
tion of pus in the buboes or enlarged glands is a favorable symptom. A 
rapid disappearance of a group of enlarged glands or the appearance of car- 
buncles and bleeding are bad signs. Intense poisoning features and purple 
spots are signs of plague-pneumonia. 

TREATMENT.— 

Preventive. — Abandon all unsanitary habits. Isolate the sick. Avoid 
coming in contact with infected persons or entering infected dwellings. Dis- 
infect the sick room, the bed, bed clothes, the vomit and stools. Steam the 
bed at 213 degrees for one hour and expose to the sunlight for a few hours. 
Burn all infected articles that you do not disinfect. After recovery the pa- 
tient should not mingle with others for at least a month. 

Treatment of Attacks. — Medicines seem to do no good but only combat 
the symptoms as they arise. For the delirium and pain, morphine or hyos-

cin is given. According to some authors the serum treatment gives good 
results both as a preventive and curative agent. 

Nursing and Diet. — For the high fever give tepid or cold sponging. The 
diet should be liquid, concentrated and nourishing and stimulation is de- 
manded from the start. 

YELLOW FEVfiR. 

Description. — This is an infectious disease occurring chiefly in warm 
climates and is attended with fever, a yellowish skin, in some cases a black 
vomit,, and a tendency to oozing bleeding from the raucous membrane. A 
commission was appointed by the United States Government to investigate 
yellow fever cases and here is what they report. 
Report of Commission. — 

1. The mosquito (stegomyia fasciata) serves as intermediate host for 
the parasite of yellow fever. 

3. Yellow fever is transmitted to the non-immune individual by the 
means of the bite of the mosquito that has previously fed on the blood of 
those sick with the disease. 

3. An interval of about 13 days or more after contamination seems to 
be necessary before the mosquito is capable of conveying the infection. 

4. The bite of the mosquito at an earlier period after contamination 
does not appear to confer any immunity against a subsequent attack. 

5. Yellow fever can also be experimentally produced by the sub- 
cutaneous injection of blood taken from the general circulation during the 
first and second days of this disease. 

6. An attack of yellow fever produced by the bite of the mosquito 
confers immunity against a subsequent attack of the non-experimental form 
of this disease, 

7. The period of incubation in 13 cases of experimental yellow fever 
has varied from 41 hours to 5 days and 17 hours. 

8. Yellow fever is not conveyed by fomities (infected goods) and 
hence disinfection of clothing, bedding or merchandise, supposedly contam- 
inated by contact with those who are sick with this disease, is not necessary. 

9. A house may be said to be infected with yellow fever only when 
there are present within its walls, contaminated mosquitoes capable of con- 
veying the parasite of this disease. 

10. The spread of yellow fever can be most effectually controlled by 
measures directed to the destruction of mosquitoes and the protection of 
the sick against the bites of these insects. 

11. While the mode of propagation of yellow fever has now been defin- 
itely determined, the specific cause of this disease remains to be discovered. 

Symptoms. — The disease comes on very suddenly with tiredness, head- 
ache, eyeache, dizziness, chills, paleness, stomach distress and severe back 
and muscular pains. The fever runs from 103 to 107 degrees. The breathing 
and pulse are at first increased. On the second or third day the pulse rate 
falls even while the fever is rising. The tongue is red and covered with a 
white fur. The bowels are constipated and the urine scanty and containing 
albumen. On the third day the symptoms become greatly modified, or less- 
ened. This is the critical period. If the patient gets worse there is heart and 
stomach distress and persistent vomiting of a brown, reddish looking ma- 



INFECTIOUS AND CONTAGIOUS DISEASES. -85 

terial. The urine is more scanty and contains albumen. The grave symp- 
toms increase. 
TREATMENT.— 

Plenty of fresh air and sunshine. Give medicine according to the symp- 
toms. 

MALARIAL FEVERS. 

Description. — By malarial fever we mean or refer to a condition pro- 
duced by the entrance into and development in the blood of certain germs 
known as " plasomodium malarise." There are four forms of this disease^ — 
intermittent, remittent^ relapsing and pernicious. 

Intermittent Fever — Fever and Ague or Chills and Fever. — There are 
chills, fever and sweating. These may occur daily, or alternate days or 
every third day. 

Remittent Fever. — ^This is continued fever with remissions. Symptoms 
are a great deal like intermittent fever. 

Relapsing Fever. — This is the sub-acute or chronic form. 

Pernicious Fever. — This is a malignant form where the symptoms are 
very active. 
TREATMENT.— 

Quinine is usually the treatment. Must also treat the symptoms as 
they arise. If the fever and chills occur daily the quinine is to be given each 
•day. If it does not occur every day then give the quinine on the days it is 
expected. For the milder forms give from 10 to 15 grains. For the more 
severe cases from 30 to 60 grains may be given in powder. If it is the per- 
nicious form give in soft capsules as quickly as possible. 

Herb Remedies for Ague and Intermittent and Remittent Fever. — Where 
<juinine cannot be given 'use dogwood bark. Put the dried bark into water 
and boil it down to the proper consistency. The dose of this is from 20 to 
60 grains. The dose of the extract is from 1 to 6 grains. Another remedy is 
to give hot boneset tea to produce vomiting. • During the intermission give 
the tea cold. It is to be given every hour as a tonic and anti-periodic. A 
decoction made by boiling ironwood in water is still another remedy. The 
dose is from 1 to 2 ounces 3 or 4 times a day. 

For Ague, Malarial Fever, Etc. — I give 2 grains of quinine every 1 to 2 
hours in acute cases, until the patient hears his ears " singing." Then I give 
him just enough to keep him in this condition, say a dose every 2 to 5 hours. 
Give to children in proportion to their age. In chronic cases quinine is not 
so good, The bowels and kidneys must be kept working well by laxatives 
and diuretics if necessary. Give tonics in the interval if the patient is run 
down. For chronic cases Fowler's solution of arsenic, 5 drops four times a 
day, is good. 

Homeopathic Treatment. — Arsenicum Alb., third trituration, every three 
hours is good. Natrum Mur. is good in some cases. (For preparation and 
dose see " Homeopathic Medicines " in Nursing Department.) 
PEOPLE'S HOME REMEDIES.— 

1. Salt — ^The Great South American Remedy. — Roast some salt in the 
oven until it is the color of roasted coffee. Dissolve a soupspoonful in a 
glass of water and take at one dose. Be careful of the diet. 

Physician's Remark. — South Americans claim that burnt salt is an ex- 
cellent remedy for this disease. 



86 PEOPLE'S HOME MEDICAL BOOK, 

2. Remittent Fever. — During the fever the mother should wrap the 
child in wet cloths until it sweats, then wash in warm water. Put cloths 
wrung out of cold water to the head if it is hot and change frequently. This 
is for remittent fever. 

3. Onions, Garlics, Mustard, Vinegar. — Give a cathartic and place 
either onion, garlic or mustard poultices to the feet and apply equal parts 
of vinegar and water to the head. 

Physician's Remark. — If garlic poultices are used it is hardly necessary 
to add that it might be a good plan for the nurse to hold her breath while 
attending to the patient. 

4. Herb Teas. — Mothers will find the following remedy valuable for 
remittent fever of children. When the fever is on, let the patient drink freely 
of warm balm, catnip or elder flower tea. When the fever is oflf, take a quart 
of boiling water and add a tablespoonful of each of the following in powder 
form: dogwood bark, black cohosh root, chamomile flowers and Solomon's 
seal root. Steep for four hours in a covered vessel and, when cold, strain and 
sweeten. Give a teaspoonful every hour. 

5. Catnip, Boneset, Pennyroyal, Red Pepper and Lemonade. — During 
the chills of ague let the patient drink either catnip, boneset, pennyroyal or 
red pepper tea and during the fever allow cold lemonade. 

Physician's Remark. — The first three of these teas cause sweating, red 
pepper stimulates the stomach and lemonade quenches the thirst and supplies 
citric acid. * 

6. Ginger and Hot Milk. — Add a large tablespoonful of ground ginger 
to a pint of milk, heat and drink when the chills come on. Repeat before 
each chill if necessary. 

Physician's Remark. — Ginger is stimulating and warming. 

7. Lemon Juice. — Drink the juice of three lemons every other day if 
you have chills and fever. 

Physician's Remarks. — Each lemon yields from 2 to 8 drams of juice con' 
taining from 7 to 9 per cent, of citric acid besides phosphoric and malic acids 
in combination with potassa and other bases. The juice is good as a sweater 
for colds and has many other uses both internal and external. 

8: Coffee and Citric Acid. — ^Just before a chill comes on drink a cup of 
hot coffee in which has been dissolved fifteen grains of citric acid. A woman 
in Mississippi where this disease is common tells of several instances where 
this treatitient has cured some very bad cases. 

9. Cotton Seed Tea. — ^A southern lady gives the following: "To two 
pints of water add 1 pint of cotton seed and boil to a pint. Strain and take 
while warm about an hour before the chill is expected." 

10. Dandelion and Quinine. — Put two ounces of elixir of dandelion into 
an 8 ounce bottle. Add 40 grains of quinine and fill the bottle with simple 
syrup. Shake well and take a tablespoonful three or four times a day. For 
children, give in proportion to their ages. This is claimed to be a sure remedy., 

Physician's Remark, — Dandelion acts upon the bowels and thus causes 
them to do better work during ague. 

11. Mandrake Root, Molasses and Boxwood Tea. — Squeeze out 1^/^ 
tablespoonfuls of juice from freshly dug mandrake root and mix with the 
same quantity of molasses. This will make three doses of a tablespoonful 
each. Take two hours apart. Then drink boxwood tea which is made from 
the bark. Drink this freely for a couple of weeks. 



INFECTIOUS AND CONTAGIOUS DISEASES. 87 

13. Quinine and Red Pepper. — Mix 10 grains of quinine and 4 grains 
of red pepper, divide into 3 doses and take four hours, two hours and one 
hour before the chill is expected. 

Physician's Remark. — I think that larger doses of the quinine could be 
used to bet(ir advantage. 

13. Soot Tea. — Take a tablespoonful of wood soot scraped from the 
chimney and steep in a pint of water. Settle with an egg and add sugar and 
cream and drink wiai each meal the same as coffee. 

14. Wormwood Tea. — ^This is very good for the chills. 

15. Lemon and Salt. — Eat one raw lemon with a little salt three times 
a day and take some good laxative. 

Physician's Remark. — This keeps the stomach, liver and bowels in good 
condition. 

ANTHRAX. 

Description. — Thi,s is an infectious disease common in Europe and 
South America. 

Cause. — It is due to the presence of germs called the bacillus anthracis. 
It comes largely frorn handling infected animals or their raw hides. 
TREATMENT.— 

The treatment is preventive. Forbid handling the raw hides and infected 
animals if they have any superficial wounds. 

LOCK JAW. 
Tetanus. 

Cause. — This is produced by germs or the bacillus of tetanus. It can 
be caused by poisoning from a very small and insignificant wound such 
as a pin prick, a rusty nail or a cut from a tin can. Fourth of July produces 
many cases because of the injuries happening on this day. 

Symptoms. — The muscles become rigid and set so that the limbs are fixed 
and the jaw locked. 

Treatment. — Tetanus antitoxin is the remedy, but it must be used early. 
Should be given immediately after the wound if possible. Give chloral hy- 
drate and the bromides in full doses for the spasms. Give nourishing and 
easily digested foods and feed through a tube inserted in the nostrils if 
necessary. All wounds should be cleaned and dressed as directed under 
" Blood Poisoning." 

PEOPLE'S HOME REMEDIES.— 

1. Wood Ashes, Vinegar, Cayenne Pepper, Etc. — Put hot wood ashes 
into hot water, wet thick cloths in the water and apply to the jaws as quickly 
as possible and at the same time bathe the entire backbone with hot vinegar 
with either cayenne pepper or mustard added. If vinegar is not at hand 
use hot water in its place. Persist in this treatment and the jaws will "relax. 

2. Turpentine. — Some spirits of turpentine poured upon almost any 
kind of a wound will often give relief. 

3. Tobacco. — JMoisten some tobacco thoroughly and lay upon the pa- 
tient's stomach. This will cause sickness and relaxing of the muscles as there 
are many nerves in this region. Do not leave it on longer than is neces- 
sary to produce the desired effect or it may cause deathly sickness. 

4. Nicotine. — Give nicotine in one-drop doses in a little wine often

enough to control the convulsions. In some cases two drops will be re- 
<iuired. This remedy comes from Scotland and is claimed to be very effective. 
Nicotine is a poison contained in tobacc©. 

Physician's Remark. — This drug should be used very carefully. 

GONORRHCEA. 
(See Men's Department.) 

DENGUE. 
Breakbone Fever — Three-Day Fever. 

This is also called " Dandy Fever," " Bouquet Fever " and " Bucket 
Fever." It is an acute infectious disease and is usually epidemic There is 
severe pain in the muscles and joints and the patient has a peculiar walk. 

MALTA FEVER. 

This is commonly found on the Island of Malta. 

MASHA FEVER. 
This is a disease found in certain sections of India. 

BERIBERL 

This is epidemic multiple-neuritis found in tropical and sub-tropical 
countries. 

FUNGUS FOOT. 
Mycetoma. 

This is the maderia foot or fungus foot of India. It is characterized 
by an enlargement of the feet or hands. So far as is known it is limited to 
the natives of India and Europeans who go there do not seem to take it. 

LUMP JAW. 
Actinomycosis — Wooden Tongue. 

This is a chronic infectious disorder produced by germs. It is some- 
times called the ray fungus. It is far more common in cattle. When the 
tongue is affected it is called wooden tongue. 

TICK FEVER. 

This is usually seen in western Montana. 
Cause. — It is caused by the bite of the " tick." 

Treatment. — Give fifteen grains of quinine hypodermically every six 
hours. Stimulate the heart. Drink large quantities of water. 

GLANDERS. 
Farcy. 

This disease is generally met with in the horse but it is sometimes taken 
by man. Nodules or masses appear in the nostrils of the horse. When they 
appear on the skin the disease is called farcy. 

Cause. — It is caught by taking care of a horse with glanders. 

Symptoms. — The disease develops about four days after infection. The 
patient feels wretched, has fever and there is circumscribed swelling at the 
place of infection. This is followed in a few days by ulceration of the mem- 



INFECTIOUS AND CONTAGIOUS DISEASES. 89 

brane lining the nose passages and there is a discharge of muco-pus. There 
is cough and difficult swallowing. The disease is very dangerous. 

Treatment, — Open the swellings and give free drainage. Give a nour- 
ishing diet and stimulants. 

LEPROSY. 

" A chronic infectious disease caused by bacilli leprae, characterized by 
the presence of tubercular nodules (lumps) in the skin and mucous mem^ 
branes (tubercular leprosy), or by changes in the nerves (anaesthetic leprosy). 
At first these forms may be separate but ultimately both are combined and 
in the characteristic tubercular form there are disturbances of sensation." 
(Dr. Osier.) 

History. — ^It seems that the disease prevailed in Egypt even as early 
as three or four thousand years before Christ, and both in China and India 
the disease was known many centuries before the Christian era. All the 
cases that now ?xist in Great Britain are imported. In Europe the disease 
is prevalent in Sweden and Norway, parts of Russia and particularly the 
districts about Dorpat, Riga and the Caucasus, and in some parts of Spain 
and Portugal. In the United States there are three important regions where 
the disease is found. In Louisiana the disease has existed since 1785 and has 
increased of late. It is estimated that there are between 300 and 500 cases in 
Louisiana. The disease has been brought into California by the Chinese 
and cases are not infrequent. It is known that about 170 lepers settled in 
Minnesota with the Norwegian colonists but the disease has steadily de- 
creased. The disease is also found in Canada and Mexico and is more 
common in the West Indies. 

Modes o£ Infection. — (a) Inoculation — A person may be infected bv ac- 
cidental inocalation. (b) Heredity — It may be transmitted from parent to 
child, but this is doubtful. In this respect it is similar to tuberculosis. The 
youngest cases are rarely under three or four years. 

It may be spread through infected clothing, merchandise, etc., but the 
closest and most intimate contact is necessary. Doctors, nurses and sisters 
of charity seldom take the disease. 

The tubercles of leprosy consist of tissue which is made up of various 
sized cells in a connective tissue matrix. The germs lie in great numbers 
partly between and partly in the cells. The skin is gradually aflfected and 
tuberous outgrowths appear with intervening- spaces of ulceration which 
in the face may gradually produce the so-called facies leotina or lion face. 
The mucous membrane may also be affected and particularly about the eyes 
and the back part of the throat. Deep ulcers form in many cases and the 
<-esult is often the loss of toes, fingers and other parts of the body. In an- 
aesthetic leprosy the development of the germs in the fibers of the nerves 
produces peripheral neuritis. This involvement of the nerves is the cause 
of many of the important features, and particularly the changes and de- 
struction of the tissues of the skin and the disturbances of sensation. 

Treatment. — There are no specific remedies for this disease. Segrega- 
tion, or the placing of the patients by themselves, should be compulsory in 
all cases unless the friends have ample provision in their homes for their 
isolation and care.

HYDROPHOBIA. 

In the preparation of this article we have consulted some of the best 
authorities in the country on the subject of the treatment of hydrophobia 
by the Pasteur method. Institutes for the treatment of this disease by this 
method are located at Ann Arbor, Michigan ; Chicago, Illinois ; Austin, Texas ; 
Baltimore, Maryland; Minneapolis, Minnesota; and New York City. Doubt- 
less they will be established in many other cities before many years. 

Hydrophobia is an infectious disease transmitted to man by the bite 
of a dog or some other animal suffering from " madness " or rabies. The 
disease is communicated by the bite of the mad animal and by means of the 
saliva. This poison is naturally located in the nervous system and does not 
seem to keep its poisonous power when introduced into any other system of 
organs. So hydrophobia is a nervous disease. In order to have a poisonous 
effect this poison must touch a broken nerve trunk. When the poison comes 
in contact with the end of a broken nerve trunk it slowly spreads to the higher 
nerve centers and in time causes hydrophobia. 

The term " rabies " applies more particularly to animals suffering with 
this disease than to man. The term means " to become mad " or " to rage." 
" Hydrophobia " comes from a Greek word which means " water-fear." In 
man, when suffering from this disease, we sometimes find a dread of water and 
that is why we apply the one term to man and the other to animals. The dog 
and other lower animals will try again and again to drink even though the 
attempt h"ngs on a spasm of the muscles used in swallowing. It seems 
that the animal is more excitable and at the same time its sensitiveness to 
outside impressions is deadened and so the animal will try to drink even 
when it causes great pain. 

After a person hap been bitten it is generally from three to six months 
before the disease develops. The disease is seldom over six months in de- 
veloping but one case is reported where it developed thirteen days after the 
person was bitten. 

During the first stage of the disease or the stage of excitement the pa- 
tient-has an expression of great anxiety. One of the marked features of the 
disease is that quite early the patient dreads the sight of water. The patient 
is very nervous or excitable and is very sensitive to feeling or pain and an 
unexpected noise or a draft of air may cause great nervous disturbance and 
a violent contraction of the muscles of the upper part of the windpipe. These 
contractions, or spasms, may be so violent as to make it very hard for the 
patient to breathe and may cause him to make curious sounds. He may 
also make snapping noises with the mouth. This is caused by the contrac- 
tions or spasms of the muscles of the mouth. The patient may froth at 
the mouth and he frequently rolls his head from one side to the other and 
is very restless and nervous. The attacks come on by spells or occur in 
paroxysms and between these attacks the patient is free from excitement. 
The pulse is somewhat faster than normal and generally the fever, is between 
100 and 103 degrees though sometimes there is no fever at all. Spasms of 
the breathing apparatus develop spontaneously toward the latter part of the 
first stage of the disease. Oftentimes the patient is so attacked with melan- 
cholia that he commits suicide. 

The disease lasts from one to three days. The paralytic stage follows 
the stage of excitement and lasts from twelve to eighteen hours. The pa-

tient is conscious of his intense pain until death releases him from his great 
sufifering. 

The three marked features or symptoms that usually characterize this 
disease are fear, excitement and spasms of the swallowing muscles. These 
terminate in general paralysis. 

Mad dogs cause about nine out of every ten cases of hydrophobia in 
men and animals. The cat causes about six per cent, of the cases and the 
remaining cases are caused by mad horses, wolves, foxes and other animals. 
Many animals are subject to the disease when bitten by an animal sufifering 
from it. 

In making demonstrations in the laboratory the rabbit and the guinea 
pig are used. In diagnosing, the guinea pig is generally used for the disease 
develops in it quicker than in other animals. Because of their convenient 
size and because they are easily operated on rabbits are generally used to 
produce the material for treating hydrophobia patients. 

Patients are treated by injecting them with a serum prepared for the 
purpose. The brain of a mad dog is taken and from this an emulsion is 
made. Some of this emulsion or poison is then injected into the brain of 
a live rabbit and after the rabbit dies of hydrophobia its spinal cord is 
taken out and put into a fluid in a glass case. Fourteen of these cords are 
kept for use and each of the rabbits from which they were taken died at a 
different time so that the cords are of different ages. A serum is made from 
each of the cords with which to inject the patient who has been bitten. 
This treatment must be given, however, before the disease has developed 
in the patient. The fourteenth spinal cord is the oldest and hence the weakest, 
or the least poisonous, and the serum made from this one is the one first in- 
jected into the patient, then later the serum from the thirteenth cord is 
injected into the patient and next from the twelfth and so on until he has 
been injected with a serum made from each of the cords. The strength of 
the serum used is thus increased at each injection until he has taken enough 
and of the proper strength to make him immune to the disease. It takes 
an expert to give the proper quantity and strength and make the treatment 
effective. The serum is not injected directly from a mad dog for that would 
be too strong but it is weakened by passing through the rabbit. 

To tell whether a dog which has bitten a person was really mad or 
not an emulsion can be made from the brain of the dog and injected into a 
rabbit or guinea pig and if the animal develops hydrophobia you are then 
sure the dog had it. This method takes too long, however, for if the dog 
was mad the patient ought to begin treatment at once. A quicker way of 
determining whether the animal had rabies is to examine the brain. If it 
had the disease peculiar little bodies will be found in the brain. This is 
why it is necessary to send the head of the dog to the institute if you have 
been bitten and are suspicious that it was mad. 

A person may get hydrophobia not only by being bitten by a dog with 
rabies but he may get it by having the animal lick a wound on the hand or 
face. He is just as likely to take it this way as by being bitten for it is the 
saliva that transmits the disease. Of course most cases are caused by being 
bitten. The lacerated or torn wounds on the hands and face are considered the 
most dangerous. , The two things that render the wound most dangerous are 
its locality or closeness to the brain and the large amount of infection trans- 
mitted. These two conditions make immediate treatment necessary and

yet an insignificant wound should also have prompt and thorough treatment 
for death may be caused by a very small wound. If the wound is but a 
small one the disease probably will not develop so quickly but it can be 
just as fatal as a larger wound and this should be considered in deciding 
whether to begin the Pasteur treatment or not. 

It is very commonly believed that a dog goes mad because of the lack 
of water, because of being confined or because of hot weather and yet these 
conditions alone cannot cause rabies. As far as is known a dog or any other 
animal never took the disease spontaneously but it was always the result 
of infection from some other animal. Up to a few years ago it was believed 
that rabies was a hot weather disease but the great number of cases occur- 
ring during the winter months has proven this belief to be unfounded. 

It is believed by many that the disease is sure to follow if bitten by a 
mad animal but the truth is that only about forty per cent, of the animals 
bitten by rabid animals take the disease. And when we speak of man alone,' 
the statistics show that only about twenty per cent, of the persons bitten 
by rabid animals develop the disease. And ySt when one is considering pre- 
ventive treatment it is wise to consider each case dangerous and to take 
treatment the same as though you were sure the disease would develop ii 
you did not. The danger is too great to take any chances. 

Bites on the exposed parts of the body like the head, neck and hands are 
most likely to result in hydrophobia because there is no clothing to par- 
tially protect these parts. Bites on the face and head are especially dangerous 
because they are so close to the brain. It is claimed that bites on the head 
give a mortality of eighty per cent, and they cause death more quickly than 
bites on other parts of the body. 

Pasteur did the original work in treating hydrophobia by this method 
and the work now done by the Pasteur Institutes is the practical applica- 
tion of his methods. Pasteur was an eminent French chemist and began his 
search for the cause and cure of this disease in 1880 and in 1886 he considered 
that the inoculation of people as a preventive of this disease was a justifiable 
experiment. During the years between 1880 and 1886 he proved by experi- 
ments that the lower animals coul(I be protected in this way from the disease. 
As a result of these experiments on animals he concluded that he was justi- 
fied in trying the treatment on people and on July 6th, 1886 the first human 
patient took the first of these treatments. Between 1878 and 1883, seventeen 
per cent, of the cases of hydrophobia proved fatal. This was before the time 
of the Pasteur treatment. The records of the Pasteur Institute in Paris 
for the years 1886, 1887 and the first half of 1888 show that during this 
time 5374 persons took this treatment under the supervision of Pasteur. Each 
of these persons had been bitten by an animal either proven or suspected 
of being mad. The death rate for all in 1886 was one, and thirty-four one- 
hundredths per cent., for 1887 it was one and twelve one-hundredths per 
cent, and in 1888 it was seventy-seven one-hundredths of one per cent. With 
later changes that have been made in the methods of treatment the death 
rate of all treated has been reduced to three-tenths of one per cent. 

The Pasteur treatment must be taken before the development of the dis- 
ease. After the first symptoms of the disease appear the treatment is of 
'no value. If the disease developed at once after being bitten it would be im- 
possible to carry out the Pasteur treatment. But, as has been previously 
said, the disease is generally from three to six months in developing and the 



INFECTIOUS AND CONTAGIOUS DISEASES. 93 

patient takes advantage of this time to be treated. This disease develops 
only in the nerve tissue and is carried along the nerve trunks to the brain. 

If a dog which is not naturally vicious suddenly bites, and without ap- 
parent cause, it should be tied up securely and watched for several days to 
see if the disease develops in the dog. Sometimes the only symptom no- 
ticed at first is a tendency to bite without sufficient cause but if watched for 
several days the stage of excitement and then of paralysis will come on. If 
the dog shows symptoms of madness during these days of confinement the 
wound should be considered dangerous. 

Cauterizing or burning the wound is a wise preventive measure for the 
time. This is generally recognized as the first and most important preven- 
tive treatment. There seems to be some misunderstanding, however, as to 
the proper method of doing this and as to how long a time may elapse after 
the bite before the burniiig will be of no value. This misunderstanding 
seems to extend even to the physicians. 

This cauterizing should not be neglected because several hours have 
passed since the bite. Of course the sooner it is done the better but it >vill 
sometimes be of value even after two or three days have passed since the in- 
fliction of the wound. If it has been some time since the bite the parts should 
be thoroughly laid open and scrubbed as well as cauterized, The poison is in 
the broken nerve trunks and does not travel very rapidly, hence the value of 
cauterizing even at a late date. 

The liberal use of fuming nitric acid is much the best method of cau- 
terizing. Nitric acid is very penetrating but even with the use of this acid 
ten per cent, of the animals experimented on die. Ninety-five per cent, 
carbolic acid should be used if there is no nitric acid at hand but the nitric 
acid is better. Whichever is used, the parts should afterwards be washed 
well with sterile or boiled water. And if the carbolic acid has been used 
the part should first be washed with absolute alcohol, then with sterile water 
and then a one to seven thousand bichloride dressing should be applied. If 
the carbolic acid is thoroughly washed out there will not be the danger of 
ulceration which frequently occurs after the use of this acid. 

With the application of either of these methods an occasional life may 
be saved and this is especially true where the wounds are large and a large 
quantity of poison has been transmitted. If a part of the virus is destroyed 
by burning, the Pasteur treatment will be made more certain for the Pasteur 
treatment alone might not be enough to save some cases where much poison 
has been inoculated. 

If ther^ are good grounds for believing that the animal was mad the 
patient should be sent to a Pasteur institute at once. It is of great importance 
that the treatment begin as soon after iiioculation as possible. It is not 
best to wait until the animal dies or until experiments have been made upon 
animals. Of course, if there is a great deal of doubt as to whether the animal 
was mad one might sometimes be justified in waiting until the result of the 
test has been made known. 

The entire head of the animal supposed to be mad should be sent at 
once bj' express to the laboratory of the Pasteur Institute in one of the 
previously mentioned cities. Or, it is best to have a health officer take it 
personally. The brain will then be examined and if the test shows that the 
animal was mad the patient can begin treatment at once. _ 

In one of the Ann Arbor cases the brain was examined and the dog

pronounced mad within twenty minutes after the head was received and 
\yithin the next hour and a half the patient had begun her course of preven- 
tive treatment. 

SUMMARY, OR WHAT TO DO IF YOU ARE BITTEN BY A 

' MAD DOG. 

From this article, then, we would gather that if a person is bitten by a 
dog which he has reason to believe is mad, he should at once open the wound 
and cauterize, or burn, it with nitric acid; or, if this is not at hand he should 
use carbolic acid. (Use a red hot iron if no acid can be obtained.) This 
ishould be done immediately but will be of some good even after three days. 
The patient should then immediately go to one of these institutes in one 
of the cities mentioned at the beginning of the article; or, at least he should 
send the head of the dog by express or by person to the same place and 
then if the test shows that the animal had hydrophobia he himSelf should go 
to the institute without delay. 

If a person is bitten by a dog and it is very doubtful about its being 
mad, the dog should at once be fastened up and watched for at least seven 
days unless symptoms of hydrophobia develop earlier. If the dog shows 
symptom.s within this time the person bitten should lose no time in going to 
one of these Pasteur Institutes for treatment. Do not forget to save the head 
of the dog so that it may be examined and thus make certain whether or not 
it was mad. ' 

' The first symptom of this disease is a difficulty in swallowing. 

Remember that if you are bitten by a mad dog it is too late to do any- 
thing after the first symptoms appear. The treatment is purely preventive 
so it is best to lose no time. 



DISEASES OF THE LUNGS, BRONCHIAL 
TUBES AND AIR PASSAGES. 



(Diseases of Respiration.) 

Description of Organs. — In order to locate correctly the organs of res- 
piration, or the organs used in breathing, it will be necessary and con- 
venient to also locate two or three organs th^t do not belong to this system, 
like the gullet and tonsils, for instance. 

In front, the roof of the mouth is called the hard palate and behind it 
is called the soft palate. The hard palate is continuous with the soft palate. 
The soft palate is a movable fold of flesh hanging or suspended from the 
back border of the hard palate. Hanging from the middle of the lower border 
of the soft palate above the root of the tongue is a soft, fleshy mass called 
the pendulum of the palate or the uvula. This is plainly seen upon looking 
into the mouth. Arching downward and outward from the base of the uvula 
on each side are two curved folds of mucous membrane called the " arches " 
or ■' pillars " of the soft palate or pillars of the fauces. The space left 
between these arches or pillars is called the isthmus of the fauces. The 
" fauces " is the opening which is between the mouth in front and the pharynx 
behind. The arches or pillars are on both sides of the fauces and the uvula 
or pendulum hangs down into it. As before stated there are two arches 
or pillars on each side and between the two are the tonsils, one on each 
side of the fauces. The surface of the tonsils toward the pharynx has from 
twelve to fifteen openings each leading into a small opening or crypt. From 
these crypts or openings there are numerous follicles branching out into 
the substance of the tonsils by very irregular channels. The pharynx is the 
opening or box which lies behind the fauces. It is a part of the alimentary 
canal and from it are passages leading to the mouth, nose, ears and oesophagus 
or gullet. The larynx also opens into the pharynx. 

The oesophagus or gullet extends from the pharynx to the stomach and 
enters or connects with the stomach at a point opposite the tenth dorsal 
vertebra. It is from nine to ten inches long. It is a part of the alimentary 
canal and of course belongs to the digestive apparatus instead of the breath- 
ing apparatus. It is the tube down which the food goes from the throat to 
the stomach. 

The larynx is the voice box where sounds are made. It is four and a 
half inches long and is situated between the base of the tongue and the 
trachea or windpipe. It forms a projection in front called the " Adam's 
apple " and this moves distinctly when we swallow. The larynx is really 
an enlargement at the upper end of the windpipe. Across it are stretched 
the vocal cords which produce the voice. 

The trachea, or windpipe, extends from the lower part of the larynx, on 
a lei-el with the sixth cervical vertebra, to opposite the fourth or fifth dorsal 
vertebra. Here it divides into two bronchi, or tubes, called bronchial tubes, 

95 



96 PEOPLE'S HOME MEDICAL BOOK. 

One goes to each lung. The right one is^ larger but shorter than the left one 
and is about an inch in length. It enters the right lung opposite the fifth 
dorsal vertebra. The left tube is smaller but longer than the right one, 
being nearly two inches long. It enters the root of the left lung about an 
inch lower than the right tube enters the right lung or opposite the sixth 
dorsal vertebra. 

The pleura covers each lung upon its outer surface as far as its root 
and is then reflected upon the inner surface of the chest. Between these 
two layers is the cavity of the pleura and it contains a very little clear fluid. 
Each pleura is a separate and a closed sac. In a healthy condition the two 
layers of each pleura are in contact. Pleurisy is a disease or inflammation 
of the pleura. 

The lungs are the organs of respiration and are two in number. They 
are placed one on each side of the chest. The right lung has three lobes 
and the left but two. The bronchial tubes divide and sub-divide into many 
small air passages in the lungs and these finally end in the air cells. The tissue 
between these cells contains many small blood vessels where the blood cir- 
culates and is purified by giving off its poisons to the air and taking in oxygen 
from the air. 

WHOOPING COUGH. 
Pertussis. 

Description. — ^This is an acute, specific, infectious disease. It is also 
contagious. It occurs most frequently between the first and second years 
and next most frequently between the sixth and twelfth months. It is par- 
ticularly a disease of childhood but may attack persons of any age. A per- 
son very seldom has the disease more than once. The death rate is great- 
est during the first year, being about twenty per cent. Between the first and 
fifth years the death rate is about five per cent. The occurrence of pneu- 
monia in children under two years of age adds to the death rate. 

SYMPTOMS — First or Beginning Stages. — ^It begins with what seems 
to be a cold with a cough which is worse at night. This cough becomes 
more and more troublesome no matter what treatment is used. After four 
or five days there may be vomiting and especially after eating. As time 
goes on the coughing lasts longer each time and the patient becomes red in 
the face and spits up a large amount of mucus. This period without whoop- 
ing may last ten or twelve days. Some cases have but very little of the 
whooping. There is some fever during the first few days. 

Second or Spasmodic Stage. — The whoop now appears and this is a 
distinguishing feature of the disease. The cough is very spasmodic and 
occurs in paroxysms beginning with the drawing in of ' the breath and is 
marked by a loud crowing sound- called the whoop. The number of these 
spells of coughing generally increases and the patient may have from 30 
to 100 in 34 hours. This second stage of the disease may last two or three 
weeks. 

Third Stage or Stage of Decline. — ^The number of fits of coughing de- 
creases and the cough is less severe. The spells of coughing may stop grad- 
ually or suddenly after from four to twelve weeks. The whoop may re- 
appear at times afterwards. After the whoop has disappeared the cough 
may continue for some time, especially if the disease occurs during the fall 
months. In young persons the lungs may become afifected so that the child 



DISEASES OF THE LUNGS. 97 

gets pneumonia or bronchitis. Whooping cough generally lasts for two 

months, more or less. 

TREATMENT.— 

" What To Do," — Give good nursing, keep the bowels open and be on 
the watch for symptoms of pneumonia or bronchitis. Immediately attend 
to any fever that appears or continues going higher. 

"_What Not to Do." — Do not over feed. Do not let the bowels become 
'constipated. Do not let the child take cold or serious consequences may 
follow. 

Medical Treatment. — As a general thing the medical treatment is un- 
satisfactory unless daiigeroUs medicihes are used. Antipyrin is used in large 
doses and so is quinine but the doses are so large that I consider them in- 
jurious. Belladonna is also used in doses large enough to produce a rash on 
the skin. I cannot advise this in such doses. I consider Vapo-Cresoline one 
of the best remedies and the directions for its use will be given under " Nurs- 
ing." Teas made from clover blossoms and from green chestnut leaves are 
also very good. 

Homeopathic Ti-eatmeflt. — The third dilutibn of Belladonna, the third 
trituration of Cuprum and also Drosera are much used by Homeopaths. For 
•■his disease 1 cannot say that I have found the homeopathic medicines as 
beneficial as in many other diseases. 

Nursing and Diet. — The patient should be dressed warrtily and comfort- 
ably. Children should be fed frequently and in small amounts and the food 
should be liquid. When the disease is attended with much fever it should 
receive prompt attehtion as this indicates bronchitis or pneumonia. Medi- 
cine will help the complications or accompanying diseases more than it will 
the whooping cough. In summer it is best iot the children to be out of doors. 
In winter they should be kept in a warm and well ventilated room with the 
temperature at about '^0 degrees. The air should be moistened by liberating 
in the room small quantities of steam from a kettle of boiling water or from 
a croup kettle or by dropping pieces of unslacked lime into a bucket of water. 
When it is not possible to keep the child in an evenly heated room, a most 
excellent method, particularly in those cases where the attacks are frequent 
at night, is to place the child in a bronchitis or croup tent as described in the 
Nursing Department. 

Vapo-Cresoline. — This is the best remedy I have ever used. It can be 
bought at any drug store and the directions are on a circular which comes 
wrapped around the bottle. Vapo-Cresoline is to be burned in the closed 
sleeping room at night when the patient goes to bed. This allows the patient 
to sleep well and it is not dangeiroUs. I hive Used it many times during the I4st 
15 years and it has never failed me. If you wish, you can buy the lamp that 
goes with it or you can use a common lamp and make a wire holder for the 
granite cup and place it on top of the chimney high enough so that the lamp 
does not smoke. Put the vapo-cresoline in the cup to the depth of about one- 
fourth an inch. If more is needed it can be added later. Lieht the lamp in the 
closed sleeping room about 10 minutes before the patient goes to bed. Leave 
no windows open or the vapor will all escape. Remove all clothes from the 
room or they will retain the odor fOr a long time. This treatment is good for 
either childreft or grown people who are siiffering with whooping coU'gh. 

After Effects. — Bronchitis and pneumonia often comq during or after 
whooping cough and the patient should be very careful not to take cbM or 
7 



98 PEOPLE'S HOME MEDICAL BOOK. 

one of these diseases may be the result. If not properly cared for, the 
patient may be left in a weakened condition and thus be more subject to 
consumption. Indigestion and diarrhea are other after effects and attention 
should be paid to the diet. Sometimes there are convulsions and paralysis. 
PEOPLE'S HOME REMEDIES.— 

1. Chestnut Leaf Tea. — This is probably the best remedy known for 
whooping cough. To a pint of boiling water add a handful of the green 
leaves, steep, sweeten, and when cool let the child drink of the tea five or 
six times a day. 

2. Clover Blossom Tea. — Gather red clover blossoms, make a tea of 
them and drink it freely. This is both a preventive and a cure. 

Physician's Remark. — Dr. Hartshorn in his book advocates the use of 
clover tea and especially a tea made from green chestnut leaves. These are 
claimed to be very good and a good feature of them is that they cannot injure 
the child as is sometimes done with strong drugs. 

3. Licorice, Butter, Sulphur, Etc. — Mix equal parts of licorice, sulphur, 
fresh butter and spermaceti. This may be taken freely. 

4. Pine Boughs, Wintergreeil and Sweet Oil. — Boil some pine boughs, 
wintergreen and sweet oil and use the solution. 

5. Ammonia. — One of the best remedies is to boil some strong ammonia 
in the room and let the child inhale the fumes. 

6. Turpentine. — A physician of Vienna recommends the placing of 
twenty drops of oil of turpentine on a handkerchief and holding it before the 
child's face while it takes ,30 or 40 deep breaths. 

7. Peach Leaves. — Make a tea of peach leaves by adding an ounce of 
the leaves to a pint of cold water and allowing to stand until the water ha= 
taken part of their strength. Give a tablespoonful every hour or two. 

8. Skunk Cabbage. — The tincture made of the fresh root of skunk cab- 
bage is good for whooping cough. The dose is from 1 to 3 drams. 

9. Maiden Hair Tea. — A tea made of maiden hair will be found an ex- 
cellent remedy for whooping csugh. 

COLDS, COUGHS AND HOARSENESS. 
(Acute Coryza) 

The symtoms are too well known to need description. 
TREATMENT.— 

Preventive. — Keep the children well clothed and out of doors as much as 
possible. Have ventilation in the sleeping rooms so that plenty of fresh air 
can enter. The temperature of the house should be from 68 to 70 degrees. 
Begin out door treatment in the summer and sleep with plenty of !resh air 
during the whole year. Use cold sponging upon rising in the morning an-l 
especially upon the chest, throat and spine. Wear flannel underclothing on 
the chest all year and on the limbs in winter. This applies particularly to 
children. The underwear should be medium weight in winter and lighter 
in summer. Give cod liver oil to weak children to build them up so they will 
not take cold easily. Do not use chest protectors, cotton pads or extremely 
thick clothing on children. If a child is subject to frequent colds, see if 
theft; are adenoids in the pharynx, or throat. To avoid taking cold alway.= 
change wet clothing; immediately. t>& not get to sweating and theft sit 
down to cool oE and do not stay in a poorly ventilated room and breathe the 
same air over and over. 



DISEASES OR THE LUNGS. 99 

"What t« Do." — Grease the nese, throat, faee and cliest with sweet oil, 
lard, camphor or camphorated oil twice daily. Keep the bowels open aftd if 
necessary sweat the patient. 

" What Not to Do." — Do net wear chest protectors or cotton pads. Do 
not do anything that will mak^ you take more cold as serious diseases some- 
times follow when the system is run down from a bad cold. 

Allopathic Treatment. — Foi an adult, at the beginning if there is fever, 
give from % to 1 drop of aconite every two to four hours. Stop when the 
throat feels dry and contracted. At night give hot lemonade and 10 grains 
of Dover's powder. You can also give 1/100 of a grain of biniodide of mercury 
with the aconite. Give ev^y 1 to 3 hours according to the age. 

Homeopathic Treatment. — At first give the second dilution of Aconite. 
Put 10 to 15 drops in a glass half full of water and give 2 teaspoonfuls every 
half hour to three hours according to the age of the patient. 

Give tincture of camphor, 1 drop every 1 to 3 hours, where there is much 
sneezing and water keeps dropping from the nose. 

When the nose is stopped up and there is sneezing and hot burning 
water coming from the nose give the third trituration of Arsenicum. Give 
one tablet every 1 to 3 hours. 

If there is a thick discharge give the third trituration of Mercurius Sol. 
Give 1 tablet every 1 to 3 hours. 

Also frequently rub on the outside a salve made with camphor and cream. 
PEOPLE'S HOME REMEDIES.— 

1. Onion Poultices, Etc., for Cold on the Lungs. — Make a poultice of 
onions fried in lard and lay on the chest. Soak the feet in as hot water as 
can be borne and drink a glass of hot lemonade and, if you have it, a little 
senna tea before going to bed. 

Physician's Remark. — Lemonade will cause sweating, senna will move 
the bowels and the onions will loosen the cold by drawing the congestion 
from the lungs. 

2. Camphor and Sugar for Cold in Head. — One of the very best reme- 
dies for a cold in the head is to put one or two drops of spirits of camphor 
on a lump of sugar, dissolve the sugar in half a glass of water and take a 
teaspoonful every two hours. 

Raysician's Remark. — Camphor will frequently stop a cold if taken at the 
beginning. 

3. Castor Oil, Molasses, Etc., for Snuffles or Cold in Head. — Keep the 
bowels open with castor oil and molasses and grease the nostrils with mutton 
suet, sweet oil or lard. v 

4. Sage, Pennyroyal or Balm Tea. — Keep the bowels open and give 
a dose of sage, pennyroyal or balm tea. 

5. Camphorated Olive Oil. — Relief is often obtained by rubbing the 
nose with camphorated olive oil. 

6. Onion Syrup. — Give onion syrup made as follows. — Slice an onion 
into a granite basin and add 1 tablespoonful of sugar and a small lump of 
butter and simmer on the stove until thoroughly cooked and give a tea- 
spoonful or two of the juice every little while. Sometimes it is necessary to 
add a little water. 

7. Skunk's Oil. — Applied to the throat and lungs this is a good remedy 
for a cold on the lungs. Sometimes it is given internally in small doses. 

0. Peppermint «md Suet. — Two or three drops of peppermint mixed 



100 PEOPLE'S HOME MEDICAL BOOK. 

with an equal amount of suet and rubbed over the baby's chegt gives quick 
relief in case of a cough or cold on the lungs. 

9. Elder Flowers and Honey. — A remedy which comes from Russia pre- 
scribes a tea made from elder flowers and sweetened with honey. Either fresh , 
or dried flowers may be used. Cover up warmly in bed and drink freely of the 
tea to induce sweating. 

10. Camphor, Turpentine, Kerosene and Lard for Colds, Coughs and 
Croup. — The following is excellent for these ailments. Saturate a flannel in a 
mixture of one part each of spirits of camphor and turpentine and two parts 
each of kerosene and lard. Apply warm to the throat and chest. 

11. Balm of Gilead Buds, Honey and Lemon Juice. — To a quart of 
water add two ounces of balm of Gilead buds, simmer down to a pint, strain 
and add a pound of comb honey and the juice of three lemons. Boil together 
until the wax in the honey is dissolved. This will cure coughs of long stand' 
ing. 

13. Borax ?nd Sugar. — For a cold in the head nothing is better than 
powdered borax snufifed up the nose. Some add a little pulverized sugar. 
Some also dissolve a tablespoonful of borax in a pint of water and snufif this 
borax water two or three times a day. 

13. Hot Lemonade.— Take just before going to bed. This is an old and 
tried remedy for a cold. 

14. Camphor. — A little camphor snuffed up the nose relieves a cold in 
the head almost instantly. 

Physician's Remark.— The camphor tends to dry up the secretion and is 
a very good remedy. 

15. Hot Roasted Onion.— Eat a hot roasted onion or onion syrup before 
going to bed. The onion is a fine thing for colds. 

Physician's Remark.— The onion syrup is better for a cough. 

16. Hot Foot Bath and Hot Lem0nade.-r-B9.the the feet in hot water 
and drink a teacupful of hot lemonade before going to bed. 

17. Salt, Sugar and Water.— In the first stage a cold may be cured by 
eating a mixture of ^/^ salt and % sugar and then drinking all the water that 
the salt and sugar cause you to want, as both cause thirst. 

18. Lard, Camphor, Turpentine, Kerosene, Etc. — For children give a 
warm bath, being careful to let no cold air strike the child. Rub the chest, 
arm pits and soles of the feet with a preparation of tallow or lard, a small 
piece of camphor gum, 1 teaspoonful of kerosene, % spoonful of turpentine 
and V^i spoonful of quinine, melted together slowly. If the cold is severe wet 
a flannel cloth with the preparation and place over the chest then pyt the 
child to bed and cover closely. Morning should find the child much better. 

19. Turpentine, Ammonia, Etc. — Cold in Throat and Lungs. — Add to a 
small lump of lard a little of each of the following : camphor, turpentine, coal 
oil and ammonia. Heat these together and apply to the surface hot and thep 
cover with a flannel cloth. 

20. Sulphur for the Throat and Bronchial Tubes. — For a tickling in the 
throat or a chronic affection of the bronchial tubes take 5 or 10 grains of 
dry sulphur into the mouth on the back part of the tongue and retain it there 
for a long time swallowing but a little at a time. 

21. Diet for a Cold. — When you discover you have a cold do not eat 
any supper and. upon retiring early in the evening, drink at least a pint of 
cold water. Keep comfortably warm for »t least three days if possible. Eat 



DISEASES OP THE LUNGS. 101 

raw apples as your principal diet. Do not over eat and abstain from meat and 
pastry entirely. A cold should be starved. 

Physician's Remark. — Water and apples are laxative and cleansing. 

22. Sweating for Severe Cold and Congestion. — Have the patient sit in 
a tub of water as warm as he can bear. (A sitz bath is best but any tub 
will do.) Place the feet in a large pail of hot water and pin heavy woolen 
blankets or other bed clothing around the neck. Place a towel wet in cold 
water on the nead. frequently give the patient cold water to drink. Keep 
a,dding hot water to the tub and keep the patient in the bath until he sweats and 
feels relaxed, ttave plenty of towels ready. When you take him out, while 
he stands in the tub, sponge him off very quickly with water with the chill 
taken off and rub briskly with towels and immediately put to bed in a warm 
room. There should be one or more attendants if possible. The bed should 
not be cold and the patient should be covered warmly and allowed to rest. 

Physician's Remark. — This is a very fine treatment for colds. 

23. Horehound Candy. — Dissolve about two sticks of horehound candy 
in half a cup of boiling water and drink while hot before going to bed. 

Physician's Remark. — Horehound is an expectorant and is good for a 
cold on the chest. 

24. Wild Cherry Bark and Loaf Sugar. — Put ten cents worth of wild 
cherry bark into a quart of water and boil down to a pint; add a pound of 
loaf sugar, strain and take a teaspoonful every half hour. This is fine. 

Physician's Remark. — Wild cherry is a sedative and reduces the cough 
and is an expectorant, and diminishes nervous irritability. 

25. Quinine and Grease.— For babies, rub with quinine and grease. 

26. Hot Lemonade and Flaxseed. — Hot lemonade with flaxseed sim- 
mered in it for half an hour, then strained and sweetened, is an excellent rem- 
edy. Take just before going to bed as it produces sweating.

is to be used when you have a hard, tight and distressing cough and must 
cough for some minutes before relief is obtained. Take chloride of am- 
monia, 2% drams; paregoric, 1 ounce; hive syrup, 6 drams; and to this 
add either syrup of wild cherry or fluid extract of licorice, enough to make 
4 ounces in all. Shake thoroughly and take a teaspoonful every 3 or 4

CHRONIC NASAL CATARRH. 
Chronic Rhinitis. 

This disease is too well known to need description. 

Causes. — Colds of long standing and adenoids in the throat, polypi in 
the nose and perhaps foreign bodies like buttons, etc., in the nasal passages. 
A person who is in a " run down " condition is most likely to have catarrh. 
TREATMENT.— 

Preventive. — Regulate the diet and the bowels and tone up the system 
with iron or arsenic if necessary. Give a tablespoonful of cod liver oil four 
times a day and from five to twenty drops of syrup of iodide of iron four 
times a day. Avoid taking cold as much as possible and keep the passages 
of the head clean. Spray the throat and nose passages with Dobell's or 
Seller's solution diluted with an equal amount of water. As a preventive 
of catarrh it is often necessary to remove adenoids and polypi from the 
throat and nose. 
General Treatment. — 

As a spray use 1 ounce of listerine, % dram of sodium bicarbonate or 
common baking soda, and 4 ounces of sterilized water. If used with a syringe 
add twice as much water. Ordinarily this is to be used twice a day. 

Once a day after cleansing you can use sulpho-carbolate of zinc. Use 
five grains to 1 ounce of water. Drop some of this solution into the nose 
with a medicine dropper while the head is thrown back. 

If possible move to some dry, unchangeable climate. Beware of quacks 
who are after your money. Keep the nasal passages thoroughly clean with 
some simple douche. The Birmingham Nasal Douche is a simple and very 
satisfactory one. Fill it with the following solution : soda, 1% drams and 
listerine 6 drams. Use every night and morning. Take a teaspoonful of 
tincture of skunk cabbage four times daily. 

Thoroughly mix 14 grains of camphor with 16 grains of menthol and 
then mix this thoroughly with enough white vaseline to make, an ounce in all. 
When you have this ointment prepared have the druggist give j'^ou a small 
glass tube about a quarter of an inch in diameter and four or five inches 
long. The medicine and tube will probably cost you about a quarter and the 
ointment will last a long time. Dip the tube into the ointment and t.ikc 
up a little of it and then insert the tube in the nostril and press the nostril 
around the tube so that it fits tightly, then close the other nostril and give 
a quick snuff which will draw the ointment well up into the head. Do" the 



DISEASES OF THE LUNGS. 107 

same with the ©<Aier no&<3ril. Use this two or three times a day. It will 
tboj-ouglily clear out the passages and help the worst case ©f catarrh. Also 
us© this for a fresh cold. This is a Very valuable prescription that will save 
yOM money and help your catarrh. 
PEOPLE'S HOME REMEDIES.— 

1. Salt Water. — .Uissolve half a teaspoonful of table salt in a quart of 
, water and snuff some oi this solution up the nose several times a day. This 
remedy, though simple, is one of the most elective in use. 

Physician's Remark. — Salt is an astringent and is also somewhat anti- 
septic. 

3. Borax Water. — A solution of borax in the proportion of from 5 to 20 
grains to an ounce of water is excellent when snuffed up the nose. It thor- 
oughly cleaases the passages of the head and allows nature to do the healing. 

3t Carbolic Acid Water.— One of the best remedies is from 1 to 7 
grains of carbolic acid to an ounce of water. Snuff up the nose or use in a 
douche or a/tomizer. This is especially good when there is a bad odor from 
the nose. 

4. Salt, Borax and Soda. — To half a pint of rain water add an ounce 
each of common table salt, powdered borax and baking soda. When dis- 
solved take 1 tablespoonful of the solution to 2 or 3 tablespoonfuls of warm 
water and snuff up the nostrils at bed time. This is one of the finest remedies 
used. The salt stimulates, the soda soothes, and the borax cleanses and heals. 
What more could any remedy do even if you paid a dollar a bottle for it at 
the drug store? 

5. Cubeb Berries. — Smoke cubeb berries in a clay pipe and inhale the 
smoke. These berries may be purchased at any drug store at a triffing cost 
and are used quite extensively. 

Physician's Remark. — Powdered cubebs have a fine action on the nasal 
mucous membrane and are of value in the treatment of catarrh. 

6. Burnt Alum. — Burnt "alum pulverized and snuffed up the nose has 
cured many cases of catarrh. 

7. Sulphur and Whiskey. — Add two ounces of sulphur to a pint of 
whiskey, shake and take a tablespoonful three mornings, then miss three morn- 
ings, and so continue until the whole is taken. 

Physician's Remark.— This is good for the blood. 

8. Borax and Loaf Sugar. — An excelleat catarrh snuff is made by mixing 
a dram of powdered loaf sugar with 2 ounces of pulverized borax. This rem- 
edy will cost five or ten cents at the drag store if yoo do not have it already in 
the house. It can be put into a small pill box and carried in the pocket. Use 
it as a snuff 8 or 10 times daily. This will last for a long time and save a 
dollar or two that would otherwise be paid for a patent medicine. 

Physician's Remark. — This cleanses and soothes the passages of the head. 

9. Castile Soap and Water.— A very effective remedy for catarrh is cas- 
tile soap and water snuffed up the nostrils. 

10. Sulphur, Elecampane, Licorice and Honey. — T^ke equal quantities 
of powdered sulphur, elecampane and licorice and mix with strained honey 
to make a thick heavy paste. Take a piece about the size of a walnut every 
moraing and evening. 

Semaric. — A lady living in Massachusetts writes : " My father iiad catarrh 
for years and was cured b}- this remedy and I have since used it myself 
v/ith beneficial results." 



108 THE PEOPLE'S HOME MEDICAL BOOK. 

11, Camphorated OU.'-Snuff the oil up the nostrils and the nose will 
clear immediately. Use two or three times a day. A lady living in Columbus, 
Ohio, says that this is good for any nasal trouble as she has found by ex- 
perience. 

HAY FEVER. 
Autumnal Catarrh. 

Hay fever is an affectioii of the upper ajr passages. It generally comes 
on about the middle of August and continues until a good frost. 
TREATMENT.— 

Change of clin^ate. Pry mountain air is the best. Sometimes a visit 
to the seaside is gpod. But we cannot all take this treatment so I will give 
some local treatments also- Cocaine applied to the nostrils is good but is 
rather dangerous for any one but a doctor to use. Spray the air passages with 
a 1 to 5,000 solution of adrenalin chloride and, after using this, use some milcj 
alkaline spray like Dobell's solution. 

As a spray for the nose and throat the following is a good mixture 
borax, 3 drams ; goda, ? drams ; carbolic acid, 34 grains ; and water, 1 pint. 

Another good treatment is menthol, 6 grains; camphor. 6 grains alpd 
liquid albolene, J ounce, Usp as a spray. 

Look for enlarged tonsils, adenoids, spurs and diseased turbinates. 

MEMBRANOUS CROUP OR TRUE CROUP. 

(See Laryngeal Diphtheria.) 

SPASMODIC CROUP. 
False Croup, Psseudo Croup, Catarrhal Croup, Spasniodic Laryngitis, 

Description. — This is a disease of the larynx that is most common between 
the 8nd and 5th years but it also occurs in very young infants. One attack 
leaves a person more subject to another. 

Causes. — Exposure to cold and wet very often bring on an attack of 
croup. Like the majority of catarrhal inflammations of the air passages this 
disease is due to the invasion of bacteria or germs. 

Symptoms.— Spasmodic croup causes much anxiety to mothers when the 
first attack develops without warning. During the day the chiM may have a 
slight cold- Toward evening a harsh or " croupy " cough, accompanied by 
heavy or Spasmodic breathing and a husky vpiee, suddenly develops. In some 
cases the symptqms remain mJld and only the cough disturbs the child and 
its breathing is not much affected. In other cases the child goes to sleep 
apparently, well but .during the night it suddenly awakens with a harsh, shrill, 
barking cough which is repeatca at intervals and rapidly gets worse. The 
breathing is noisy and may be heard in an adjoining room. The cough is 
especially terrifymg. The child is restless and may cry during a spell of 
coughing. It sits up for it cannot breathts easily when lying down. The face 
is of a pale bluish color and wet with a cold swtat. The child can speak only 
in a hoarse whisper and sometimes the voice is nearly or entirely lost. Toward 
morning the cough and difficult breathing get better and the child falls' asleep 
worn out by the night's suffering. Next day the child acts apparently well 
but there is a slight cough, running from the nose, swollen tonsils aqd a red 
throat. But these attacks may be repeated for two or three successive nights. 
TREATMENT.— 

Preventiv& Treatnient.-"Keeg the feet dry and do not take cold. 



DISEASES OF THE LUNGS. 109 

Emergency Remedy or " What to Do." — Give an emet!c of something to 
make the child vomit and clear the throat of the phlegm. For this purpose 
you can give a tablespoonful of goose grease Or a teaspoonful of powdered 
alum mixed with molasses Or, if nothing else is at hand, mix a little lard with 
three times as much pulverized sugar and give a teaspoohful eVery fifteen 
minutes till the child vomits. From % to 1 teaspoonful of dissolved white 
vaseline is also good. Also apply cloths wrung out of cold water to the throat. 
These should be changed frequently to keep them cold. Keep the child in bed 
and keep the bowels open. 

Caution or " What Not to Do.*'— In a.pp\y'mg cold or hot cloths do not 
allow the water to drip or run upon other parts of t/ie body. Do not allow 
the child to go from a warm to a cold room or to take cold in any way. 

Allopathic Treatment. — Wine of ipecac is godd. Give 10 drops at a dose. 
This is especially good to produce vomiting if thfe stomach is filled with food. 
From 1 to 2 dl-ops of fluid extract of ipecac is good and may be repeated in 
half an hour if necessary. 

Dr. Douglas, of Detroit, is a specialist on children's diseases and the 
following is taken from his book. It is a good Croup mixture to keep on hand 
if the children are subject to attacks of croup. Take syrup of ipecac, 3 fluid 
drams; Hive syrup, 4 fluid drams and water, 1% ounces^ Mix thoroughly 
and shake before using. Give half a teaspoonful every half hour until the 
child vomits and then repeat the dose eVefy 3 to 3 hours as needed. 

Homeopathic Treatment. — Give the third trituration of Hepar Sulphur. 
Give ,one tablet in hot water every 15 minutes Until relieved^ This is better 
for light haired people and when the cough is a little loose. It is a strange 
thing but it is true that some medicines affect light and dark complexioned 
people differently. 

Give the third trituration of Spongia. Give one tablet in hot water every 
15 minutes until relieved. This is better for children with a dark Complexion 
and when the CoUgh is very harsh and tight. 

If there is much fever give the second dilution of Aconite. Put 10 drops 
into half a glass of water and give 3 teaspoonfuls at a dosci Alternate this 
with the Hepar Sulphur or the Spongia above. 

Simple Treatment and NufSing.--"Apply cold cloths or an ice bag to the 
throat. Hot cloths are sometimes used. In applying cloths of either cold 
or hot water they should be covered with a dry flannel cloth bo that none of 
the water drips or runs upon other parts of the body. The application of an 
onion poultice is an old and tried remedy. Fry some onions in lard, not too 
dry, and apply to the throat and chest. Change often so as to keep the poul- 
tice moist and hot. This is good for the cough and tight breathihg and re- 
lieves the pain. 
PEOPLE'S HOME REMEDIES.— 

1. Cold Water Cloths.---CIoths wrung out of cold water should be ap- 
plied to the throat and changed frequently. These wet cloths should be 
covered with a dry flannel cloth. More than one child owes its life to its 
mother's knowledge of this effective treatment. 

Physician's Remark.— This is a splendid remedy but be careful not to 
allow the water to run upon other parts of the body. 

3. Mustard and Bran Poultices-— Apply either a mustard or a hot bran 
poultice to the neck. 



m THE PEOPCE'S HOME MEDICAL BOOK. 

Physician's Remark. — This produces counter^irritation and thus relieves 
the congestion. 

3. Hot Water. — One mother applies a sponge wet in water to the 
child's neck as hot as can be borne. This is highly recommended for croup. It 
should be renewed as frequently as it becomes cool until the skin' is quite red 
or until the child is better. 

4. Alum and Honey or Molasses. — The favorite remedy oi many 
mothers is to give a teaspoonful of powdered alum in a little honey or mo- 
lasses every ten minutes until the child vomits. 

5. Lobelia. — The first thing to do is to clear the throat of phlegm by 
giving an emetic. Tincture of lobelia is one of the best things for this pur- 
pose. Fifteen drops should be given every 10 minutes until the child vomits. 

Phjrsician's Remark. — This is a depressing remedy and should not be 
used unless other remedies fail. 

6. Roasted Onions.— Applied to the throat, chest, feet and hands these 
have saved the lives of many children. This remedy is a simple and effective 
one that every mother should know abdut in case of an emergency. 

7. Apples and Cranberries. — Roasted apples and cranberries are both 
recommended as applications for the throat. 

8. Snuff and Lard. — Many consider a plaster made of snuff and lard the 
best application for croup. A teaspoonful of snuff should be mixed with a 
little lard, spread upon a cloth, and applied to- the throat and chest. 

9. Camphor and Vinegar. — When croup is first noticed apply to the 
throat some cotton wet in equal parts of camphor, and vinegar. Warm whiskey 
applied in the same way is also good. 

10. Poultice of Slippery Elm, Lobelia and Red Pepper. — If other reme- 
dies fail, try a poultice made of slippery elm, lobelia, red pepper and hot 
water. It should be applied to the throat and chest and changed as rapidly 
as it cools. 

11. Hops, Vinegar and Horseradish. — If the child is very yotmg apply a 
poultice of hops boiled in water. During the day when it seems better give 
a tea made of horseradish and vinegar. 

12. Baking Soda and Molasses. — Mix equal parts of baking soda and 
molasses and for a child two years old give a teaspoonful at a dose. Repeat 
at short intervals until the phlegm is all thrown up. 

13. Castor Oil and Onion Juicc-^-Grate a raw onion, squeeze out the 
juice and add half as much castor oil as you have of the juice. Keep in a 
bottle well corked, shake before using, and give a teaspoonful every two or 
three hours. 

14. Lard and Sugar. — To one part of sweet lard add three parts of 
pulverized sugar, mix thoroughly and give a teaspoonftil every 15 minutes 
until vomiting is produced. 

15. Hot Water Cloths. — Wring a flannel out of hot water and apply to 
the neck of the child. This will usually give relief in a few minutes. 

16. Turpentine. — Wet a flannel with turpentine and place on the throat 
and chest and if the case is severe give from S to 5 drops on a piece of sugar. 

Physician's Remark. — Turpentine does the work by drawing the blood' 
away from the parts and thus relieving the congestion. 

17. ^A/■arm Butter. — Give some warm melted butter. About a table- 
spoonful may be given. 



DISEASES OF THE LUNGS. Ill 

18. Goose Grease. — Give a tablespooniEul of goose grease as often as is 
necessary to cause vomiting. 

1&. Sulphur Water. — Put a teaspoonful of sulphur into a cup of water 
and allow it to stand for two hours, then strain and use the water. Give a 
teaspoonful every two hours. A lady in Maine says she has found this a 
fine remedy for croup. This is for use the day after the attack. 

30. Lard and Snuff. — Take a piece of muslin large enough to cover the 
upper part of the chest and tie it about the neck with strings. Spread some 
lard over the musliil and sprinkle with Scotch snuff. Put a flannel over all 
this. If applied early it will always give relief. 

31. Hive Syrup, Cosmolioe and Nutmeg. — Give Hive Syrup according 
to the directions on the bottle. Spread some flannel with cosmoline, sprinkle 
thickly with grated nutmeg and keep on the chest, well up towards the throat, 
until the patient is better. 

33. Kerosene and Sugar. — Give 5 or 6 drops of lamp oil on a lump of 
sugar. Repeat if necessary. Also apply hot or cold applications externally. 

ACUTE CATARRHAL LARYNGITIS. 
Inflammation of the Larynx. 

Causes. — The causes are — catching cold, over using the voice, breathing 
irritating gases, injuries and hot liquids and corrosive poisons accidentally 
going into the larynx (Sunday throat) instead of the gullet. 

Symptoms. — There is tickling in the larynx or near the Adam's apple. 
Cold air is irritating. There is a dry cough and dry husky voice and the 
voice may even be lost altogether for a time. In adults the breathing is not 
much affected. Children may have hard spasmodic breathing. 
TREATMENT. 

Allopathic Treatment. — Allow the larynx to have rest, keep in bed if the 
case is severe and have an even temperature. Early in the attadc give aconite. 
The dose is from % to 1 drop and is to be given every 1 to 3 hours according 
to the age. Also give citrate of potash. The dose is from 10 to 40 grains. For 
the irritating cough give 10 grains of Dover's powder at night for an adult. 

Homeopathic Treatment. — Give the second dilution of Aconite. Put 10 
or 15 drops into a glass half full of water and give 3 teaspoonfuls every 
% to 3 hours according to age. After 34 hours give the second dilution of 
Belladonna instead of the Aconite. It should be prepared and given in the 
same way. For the loose cough give the third trituration of Hepar Sulphur. 
Give 1 tablet every 1 to 3 hours. 

Nursing and Diet. — Apply cold cloths or an ice bag to the throat. Hot 
cloths are sometimes used. In applying cloths of either cold or hot water 
they should be covered with a dry flannel cloth so that none of the water 
drips or runs upon other parts of the body. The application of an onion poul- 
tice is good. Fry some onions in lard, not too dry, and apply to the throat. 
Change often so as to keep the poultice moist and hot. This is good for the 
cough and tight breathing and relieves the pain. 

Hot bland drinks, hot milk, hot lemonade or hot teas are good. Fold 
a handkerchief, wring out of cold water and lay upon the larynx or Adam's 
apple and immediately cover with a piece of cloth or flannel bound around the 
neck. Make the room moist by steam from a kettle or by adding pieces of 
unslacked lime to a tub of water or use the croup or bronchitis tent as de- 
scribed in the " Nursing Department." Keep the patient in a room with 



112 [THE PEOPLE'S HOME MEDICAL BOOK. 

the temperature from 70 tq 73 degrees. Give a hbt tpustard loot hath and hot 
lemonade with a teaspoonful of sweet spirits of nitr^ in it at bed time to pro- 
duce sweating. For an adult yovj can give 10 grains of Dover's powder in- 
stead if you wish. If the trouble affects the glQittis a tube may need to be 
placfed in the throat to allow breathing. In inflammation of the larynx the 
patient should be kept in bed and the bowels should be kept open. 

SWELLING OF GLOTTIS. 
Oedema Glottis— Oedeniatous Laryngitis. 

This is a very serious affliction but fortunately it does not occur very 
often. 

Causes. — Sometimes follows acute laryngitis or glandular throat trouble. 
Caused by swelling pressing on the glottis. 

Symptoms. — There is short breath and hard breathing and in an hour or 
two the condition is very serious. The breathing is noisy and hissing and is 
attended with a choking sensation. 

Treatment. — Apply au ice bag to the throat .and if the symptoms are ur- 
gent an operation may be necessary. This disease is not frequent unless the 
patient has tuberculosis or syphilis of the larynx. It sometimes follows laryn- 
gitis and dipbtheria; 

SPASM OF GLOTTIS. 
Spasmodic Laryngitis — Child Crowing. 

Description. — This is a nervous affection and no inflammation exists. It 
occurs in children between the ages of six months and three years and is 
commonly in connection with rickets. Mothers sometimes call the attacks, 
" holding the breath " or " passion fits." 

Symptoms.'-^The attacks may come on at any time ; often just as the 
child awakens. There is no cough bwt the breathing is checked, the child 
struggles for breath, gets red in the face and then suddenly the air is drawn 
into the lungs with a high pitched, crowing sound palled " child crowing." 
The attack may occur frequently during the day. Death rarely occurs. 

Treatment— Examine the gums carefully and if swollen and hot they 
should be lanced. Also examine the tonsils and back part of the throat for 
adenoids and if found they should be removed. 

When the attack comes on carry the child to the window where it will 
have plenty of air and where you can see better. Throw a few drops of 
cold water in the face and put your finger far back in the child's throat- Unless 
it frightens the child you may sponge the breast with cold water. In severe 
cases the child should be placed in a warm bath two or three times a day and 
the back and chest thoroughly sponged with cold water. This may be em^ 
ployed when the child is having an attack unless it frightens the child. If 
the attack is very severe and the child is blue in the face it is much better 
to dash cold water in the face. Give easily digested foods and keep the 
children out doors a great deal. Besides the kinds of laryngitis here treated 
there is tuberculous laryngitis and syphilitic laryngitis, 

ACUTE BRONCHITIS. 
Description.^-This is an acute inflammation of the bronchial tubes. 
It is a very common disease and rarely serious in healthy adults but very 
fatal in the old and young. It affects both the larger and medium-sized 



DISEASES OF THE LUNGS. 113 

breathing tubes and when jt affects the small air passages it is known as 
capillary bronchitis or broncho-pnennionia- Capillary bronchitis and also 
chronic bronchitis will be treated later. As before said, the simple acute 
bronchitis is an inflammation of the larger and medium-sized air passages. 

Causes. — Bronchitis is the result of taking cold and often is nothing 
more than an ordinary cold which extends down into the air passages and is 
known as a cold on the chest. Changeable weather of early spring and late 
autumn is a cause. It may prevail as an epidemic. It freqiiently occurs 
at the beginning of typhoid and malarial fevers. It is present in asthma and 
whooping cough and persons with spinal curvature are especially liable to 
it. Also, those who lead an indoor life, and especially men, are subject to it. 

Symptoms. — In the beginning there are the symptoms of an ordinary cold 
and the hoarseness in some cases is marked. Sometimes the patient has a 
chill, feels languid, and has heavy pains in the bones and back. There is 
a feeling of tightness and rawness beneath the breast bone and a pressing 
on the chest. In mild cases there is not much fever. The cough is rough 
at first and comes in paroxysms which rack and distress the patient. During 
the severe spells the pain may be very severe beneath the breast bone and 
along the attachment of the diaphragm. At first the cough is dry with scanty 
and sticky expectoration or spit, but soon it becomes abundant and full 
3f matter. Great relief is felt when the coug-h is loosened. In this form of 
bronchitis the breathing is not much increased unless there is high fever but 
when the smaller tubes are affected it is more rapid and difficult. When the 
cough is loose there is much rattling under the breast bone. By the end 
of a week in strong adults the fever subsides and the cough loosens. The 
patient is generally fully recovered in from a week to ten days. In young 
children the chief danger is that the bronchitis will extend downward. In 
measles and whooping cough the ordinary bronchitis is very likely to descend 
to the smaller tubes or passages and they then have broncho-pneumonia. 

TREATMENT.— 

Preventive.— Avoid taking cold and especially during measles, scarlet 
fever, typhoid fever, whooping cough and similar diseases, 

Emergency Reniedy or " What to Do,"^In mild cases household remedies 
and treatments answer the purpose. Apply hot fomentations of hops and 
vinegar, a jacket poultice or a mustard plaster. Give a hot foot bath. Take 
a warm bath and drink hot lemonade or hot teas. If there is a feeling of 
much rawness keep the air saturated with moisture such as steam from a 
teakettle. If the cough is dry and irritating give ^Va grains of Dover's pow- 
ders every 3 or 4 hours until 10 grains have been taken. This is the dose 
for adults. 

Caution or " What Not to Do.'* — Do not let the patient take more cold and 
see that the disease does not go down into the smaller air passages and 
result in broncho-pne;imonJa. Do not let the bowels become constipated. 

Allopathic Treatment. — In the early stages give a combination of y-2 teas^ 
spoonful of syrup of ipecac and 1 to 8 teaspoonfuls of solution of citrate 
of potash, every 3 or 4 hours. For the cough in children from 1 to 3 years 
old give the following mixture : paregoric, 1 dram ; syrup of ipecac, 30 drops 
and syrup of tolu, 3 ounces. Take a teaspoonful of this mixture every 3 
hours. In 'acute bronchitis of children, if there is difficult breathing and the 
color becomes dusky from inability to raise the mucus, give 1 tablespoonful 

8 



114 iTHE PEOPLE'S HOME MEDICAL BOOK. 

of ipecac wine as an emetic. For an adult, if the cough is excessive give ^ 
grain of codein or 20 drops of paregoric at a dose. 

Homeopathic Treatment. — ^^Put 10 to 15 drops of the second dilution 
of Aconite into half a glass of water and give two teaspoonfuls every y^ 
to 3 hours according to the condition and age. This is good at the begin- 
ning of the attack when there is fever. 

Put 10 or 15 drops of the third dilution of Belladonna into a glass half 
full of water and give 2 teaspoonfuls every i/^ to 3 hours. This is to follow 
Aconite and is for the tight, tickling and dry cough. 

Prepare the second dilution of Bryonia in the same way as the Aconite 
and give 2 teaspoonfuls every 1 to 3 hours. This is for a tight cough that 
hurts and causes the child to cry wheh it coughs and when it is moved. 

Prepare the third dilution of Phosphorus the same as the Aconite and 
give 2 teaspoonfuls every 1 to 3 hours. This is for a tight cough with a 
great feeling of pressing and tightness under the breast bone ; also when the 
cough is worse from speaking. 

Give 1 tablet of the third trituration of Hepar Sulphur every 1 to 3 
hours. This is to be used when there is a loose rattling cough. 

Nursing. — A mustard plaster may be applied to the chest and back or 
they may be rubbed with ammonia or chloroform liniment. For children 
apply to the chest a mixture of 1 ounce of oil of amber and 2 tablespoonfuls 
of sweet oil. Steam the room by the aid of a teakettle which is kept con- 
stantly boiling or put unslaked lime in a tub of water. Or, you may use the 
croup or bronchitis tent as described in the " Nursing Department." If nec- 
essary, add to the hot water from 1 to 2 grains of menthol every 2 or 3 hours. 
In other cases the irritation will be greatly soothed by pouring into the 
boiling kettle a tablespoonful of a mixture composed of equal parts of com- 
pound tincture of benzoin, oil of eucalyptus, and oil of pine. After the 
cough is looser administer the following: chloride of ammonia, 1% to 3 
drams; and fluid extract of licorice and water, each 2 ounces. For an adult 
give a teaspoon ful every 4 to 5 hours. 

If it is simple bronchitis or cold on the chest the thing to do first is to 
get the patient into a sweat. This will reduce whatever fever there may 
be and also loosen the cough. Sweating can be produced by giving a hot 
foot bath just before going to bed and by placing hot water bottles in the 
bed far enough from the patient not to burn him. Drink plenty of hot 
drinks such as hot lemonade, hot ginger or hop tea and in fact almos^ 
any kind of hot tea will do. At the same time you can apply to the chest 
cloths wfung out of hot water in which hops and vinegar have been boiled. 
Of course this must be dope in a warm room and the water from the ap- 
plications must not be allowed tQ drip or run upon other parts of the body. 
A good bath under the bed clothes will do much good after the sweating. 
After this change the sheets and put on a clean night dress. 

PEOPLE'S HOME REMEDIES.— (Also see Home Remedies for colds, 
pleurisy, pneumonia and asthma.) 

1. Pleurisy Root. — For bronchitis, pleurisy and pneumonia in the first 
stages warm tea made of pleurisy root will produce sweating. Give a tea- 
cupful every hour or two. 

2. Skunk Cabbage. — Give a teaspoonful of the tincture of skunk cab- 
bage 4 times a day for bronchitis and asthma. 

3. Colt's Foot. — For coughs, asthma and bronchitis boil an ounce of 



DISEASES OF THE LUNGS. 115 

the leaves of colt's foot in a pint of water. The dose is frem 1 to 2 ounces 
3 or 4 times a day. 

4. Crawley Root or Beech Drops. — Crawley rdot or beech drops is 
splendid to cause sweating. The dose is from 30 to 30 grains of the pow- 
dered root given in hot water and repeated every hour or two. 

5. , Herb Tea. — Make a tea with white snake root, blood root and pleurisy 
root. The dose is from % to 3 ounces. 

6. Herb Teas, Sugar and Lemon Juice.-^Give some mild cathartic and 
for the cough give boneset or pennyroyal tea and some sugar and lemon 
juice. 

Physician's Remark. — Boneset and pennyroyal produce sweating and 
sugar and lemon juice loosen the cough and lessen irritation. 

7. Lemon Juice, Sweet Spirits of Nitre, Olive Oil and Honey. — For 
the cough of bronchitis give an adult a teaspoonful of the following mixture 
3 or 4 times a day. Mix 1 ounce each of lemon juice, sweet spirits of nitre, 
olive oil and honey. 

Physician's Remark. — Lemon juice and honefy are good for the cough. 
The nitre works on the kidneys and the castor oil on the bowels and casts 
oS waste material. 

8. Catnip or Horehou»d Tea. — Let the patient breathe the steam from 
hot catnip or horehound tea. 

Physician's Remark. — Steam is soothing to the inflamed surfaces and 
so also are the fumes of catnip and horehound and the horehound is also an 
expectorant. 

9. Petroleum.^-For either simple or chronic bronchitis take a teas- 
poonful of petroleum before each meal. 

10. Antiphlogistine. — Apply an antiphlogistine poultice. 

CHRONIC BRONCHITIS. 

Description. — This is a chronic inflammation of the bronchial tubes. It 
may follow repeated attacks of acute bronchitis but generally comes in 
chronic lung troubles, gout or kidney disease. It comes frequently in old age. 

Symptoms in Old Age. — There is shortness of the breath and the cough 
is changeable with the seasons. A person may remain free from it during 
the summer, but each winter it comes on severely and persistently. There 
may be only a coughing spell in the morning or the chief distress may be at 
night. Sometimes the expectoration or matter spit up is large in quantity 
and sometimes small and is not very thick. In many cases it is incurable 
and the patient improves in the summer but the cough disappears only to 
return again during the winter months. 

TREATMENT. — Often a change of climate is good. Southern France, 
Southern Florida or Southern California are recommended. For the morn- 
ing or general cough you can take the following in the morning. Add 15 
grains of soda, 5 grains of salt and 5 drops of chloroform to an equal quan- 
tity of warm water. For the cough drink freely of balm of Gilead buds 
tinctured in spirits. Three times a day you can take from 1 to 2 ounces 
of a tea made of seneca snake root. A tea made of elecampane can be used in 
the same way. Or, take 1 pound of spikenard, 1 pound of elecampane, 1 pound 
of comfrey, 1 pound of leaves and flowers of horehound, 1 pound of wild 
cherry bark and 4 ounces of blood root. Grind, mix and make a tea. Dose ; 
1 to 2 ounces 3 times a day. 



116 THE PEOPLE'S HOME MEDICAL BOOK. 

Homeopathic Treatment. — Put 10 to 15 drops of the third dilution of 
Phosphorus into half a glass of water and give 2 teaspoonfuls every 4 holifs. 
This is to be taken when there is a tight cotlgh. 

Give a tablet of the third ' trituration of Tartar Emetic 4 times a day. 
This is for a loose cough where the mtlcus is hard to raise. 

CAPILLARY BRONCHITIS, 
Broncho-PtteUmonla. 

Description. — This is the usual type of brdnchitis or pneumonia be 
fore the fifth year. It comes mostly during the winter months when thert 
are epidemics of influenza, etc. It is an inflammation of the smdll air passages. 

Symptoms. — There is a coUgh and short bfeathirigf. The disease sets 
in suddenly with a chill or k Convulsion followed by fever. This is when it 
does not follow other diseases. The fever; rises rapidly ahd continues. This 
kind is not so severe as when it follows anothet disease sUch as measles or 
whooping cough. In these diseases if the fever gets high, with cough, rapid 
pulse and rapid breathing and a rattling solihd is heard, we are likely to 
have capillary bronchitis. The onset is riot sudden. Usually the child after 
a day or so gets feverish and begins to cough and has shortness of breath. 
The fever is from 102 to 104 degrees and variable; the skin is dry; the cough 
is hard and distressing and may be painful and the breathing is hard. The 
number of respirations or breaths may run from 60 to 80 per minute. In the 
acute simple form or where the disease does not follow another the outlook 
is good but in cases weakened by constitutional disease and prolonged feve* 
it is terribly fatal. In connection with riieasles or whooping Cough recovery 
may take plice in the most desperate cases. Brdncho-pHeumonia is not so 
dangerous in children as in very old people. 
TREATMENT.— 

Emergency Remedy or " What to Do."— Cause sweating in one of the 
many ways described. 

Caution or " What Not to Do."— Do .not let the child take cold. Do 
not use a poultice or cotton jacket. 

Internal Medicines. — For a child 1 to 2 years old give 3 or 3 grains of 
carbonate of ammonia in syrUp of acacia and water. Use this every 3 to 4 
hours if a short stimulant is required. For a. constant stimulant give 5-year- 
old brandy well diluted with water. A child a year old may take 30 drops 
every 8 or 3 hours. 

External Medicines.-^Rub the child's back, sides, chest and abdomen 
with a teaspoonful of turpentine added to 3 teaspoonfuls of sweet oil. Do 
not use a poultice or cotton jacket. If the fever is very high, so as to be 
dangerous, control it with cool or tepid spohgtngs with gentle rubbing. If 
symptoms of brain trouble develop put cool cloths to the forehead or an ice 
bag to the head. This is a Very dangerous disease with old people. 

Nursing. — It is always well in any disease in which there is inflamma- 
tion to get the patient to sweating at the begintilng of the attack. This 
draws the blood from the Internal organs thtls relievmg the congestion. It 
makes the skin red,' warm and moist thus getting rid of , the chill or chilly 
feeling. It is well to do this in laryngitis, acute bronchitis, acute pleurisy, 
pneumonia and la grippe. If there is a decided chill or much chilliness use 
the " Corn Sweat "as described in the " Nursing Department." A rubber hot' 
water bottle is good when placed at the parts that ate paittful. Hot teas are 



PISEASES OF THE LUNGS. 117 

good, for an adult. Another way tq cause sweating is to put hot water into 
fruit cans and place at the feet, knees, hips and sides. 

Put the child into a well-ventilated and sunshiny room with the tem- 
perature at about 70 degrees. Heat if possible by a stove or open fire. U 
the house is heated with a furnace and is too dry have the air from the 
furnace flue pass over a pan of water and if the air is very hot and thor- 
oughly dry it is better to set free in the air of the room a certain amount 
of steam firom a tea kettle, a pan of boiling water or by occasionally drop- 
ping a piece of quicklime into a bucket of water. Dusty, dry and impure 
air is very injurious to the bronchial mucous membrane in cases of this dis- 
ease. In many cases it is better to place the patient in a bronchitis or croup 
tent as described in the " Nursing Department." 

Give nourishing but easily digested food in small quantities every two 
hours. Give no medicine in the food or near the time of feeding. Give 
milk, broths or albumen. (For " People's Home Remedies " see some of those 
given under Acute Bronchitis,, etc.) 

PNEUMONIA. 
Inflammation of the Lungs — Lung Fever. 

Description. — This is an inflammatioil of the air cells of the lungs. 
Often there is also inflammation of the small air tubes (capillary bronchitis) 
and there may also be inflammation of the pleura. 

Causes.— The frequency of the disease is marked before the sixth year, 
then diminishes until the fifteenth year and then increases again. It is 
more frequent in males than in females. Weakness and alcoholism render 
" a person more liable to it. The disease can follow an injury (traumatic pneu- 
monia) or it can come from lying long in one position (hypostatic pneumonia). 
It comes more in the winter and springf months. ^ 

Symptoms.— Cough, short breathing, dilated nostrils and pain are char- 
acteristic of the disease. Much moving of the nostrils when breathing and 
accompanied with a single red cheek indicate pneumonia. The onset is short 
and sudden. It generally sets in with. a chill lasting- from fifteen to thirty 
minutes and perhaps longer. It is constant and severe and one may be 
taken in the sleep or at work. Fever has then already begfun and there is 
headache and general pains. Within a few hours pain, often of an agoniz- 
ing character, develops in the side. A short, dry painful cough begins and 
the breathing is more rapid. When seen on the second or third day the 
patient lies flat in bed, often on the affected side, and the face is flushed and 
particularly on one or both cheeks. The breathing is hurried and often accom- 
panied with a grunt. The nostrils dilate with each drawing in of the breath. 
There are often sores on the lips and nose. The eyes are bright, the ex- 
pression anxious, and the cough short and frequent and the coughing makes 
the patient wince and hold his sides. The expectoration, or matter spit up, 
is sticky and tinged with blood. The temperature is 104 or 105 degrees and 
the pulse is full and bounding. These symptoms run on for from seven to 
ten days and then the crisis comes. The temperature falls and the patient is 
comparatively comfortable. This time of crisis is variable and comes sud- 
denly. The temperature may go below the normal (98-6/10). With the 
crisi$ there is much sweating and the patient falls into a comfortable sleep. 
This is the record for favorable cases. Pneumonia is the most fatal of- all 
acute diseases, more so than diphtheria and consumption. Under one year 



118 THE PEOPLE'S HOME MEDICAL BOOK. 

it is Bsere fetal than between two and five. At aboHt the age ®f sixty years 
tlie death rate amounts ie sixty or eighty per cent. It is more fatal in the 
negro than in the white man. 

In an unfavorable ease ei course all the synsptems became more severe. 
There is then more lung surface involved, sometimes the whole lung, and it 
sometimes extends to both lungs and is t,hen called double pneumonia. Breath- 
ing becomes more difficult, the mucus is hard to raise and sonjetimes the 
patient is unable to raise it at all. There is a rattling sound made by 
breathing, the face is dark, there is a cold sweat and the patient is anxious 
lodsing and finally gets drowsy. If the disease lasts a long time pus some- 
times forms on the lung and it must then be taken away before there will 
be any improvement. 

TREATMENT. — Some give veratrum viride. The dose of the tincture is 
from 3 to 5 drops for an adult. It should be given every 2 hours for the first 
34 hours. 

For the Heart. — For adults give 5 drops or more of digitalis. To older 
children give 2 drops and younger children rarely need more than % drop 
every 2 to 3 hours. Give this to children when the pulse is as high as 150 
or 160. If the pulse rate is reduced after giving" tincture of digitalis its use 
should be discontinued before the pulse drops below 100 per minute. 

For the patn. — 'In adults the stitch in the side is best relieved by a hypa- 
dermic injection of i?4 grain of morphine. After the disease has fairly set in 
the pain is not as a rule very distressing except when the patient coughs 
and for this Dover's powder may be used in 5-grain doses according to the 
patient's needs, say every 4 or 6 hours. Hot poultices are better for children. 
Never use morphine for children. Use paregoric. Four drops every 3 to 3 
hours for children under 2 years will be sufficient for the pain and cough. 
For older children and adults codeine may be used. For adults give % grain. 
For children give 1/34 to 1/30 of a grain several times daily. 

Empty the bowels daily with an injection or with salts. For children 
use a cotton or woolen jacket. In the early stages when the pain is present 
very hot poultices with mustard dressing and repeated every hour give 
more relief than the cotton jacket but when the first acute stage is over the 
jacket maintains an equal temperature. 

At the beginaing of the disease a tea made of horehound and boneset 
and sweetened with honey is good. Slippery elm tea is also good. It should 
be strained and may be drank freely. 

Mix 1 dram of quinine and 3 ounces of lard and rub well into the skin. 
Regular rubbing twice a day is very good to reduce fever and is prefer- 
able even to a jacket. Can use it without jacket dressing. 

Allopathic Treatmeat. — Dr. Osier claims that pneumonia is a salf-limited 
disease and that you cannot shorten it; l^ence, give waiting treatment. 

Horraeopatbic Treatment. — Put 10 to 15 drops of the second dilution of 
Aconite into half a !-);'ss of water and give 3 teaspoonfuls every 1 to 3 hours. 
Tlii'^ ^s p'oorl rli-ring the first 24 hours when the skim is hot and dry. 

G'v;' Vhf' ^■^;cond dilr.tion of Rryoni,2. Prepare and give in the same 
w:iy i:s tl'.e yVconite. This is f;ood for sharp, stitching and shooting pains 
and when it hurts tq breathe. This can be alternated with the Aconite every 
hour. 



DISEASES OF THE LUNGS. 119 

Give the third dilution of Phosphorus. Pre,pare and give the same as 
the y\.conite. This is for a tight cough with bloody, rUsty sputum. 

Give the third trituration of Tarter Emetic. Give 1 tablet every 1 to 
3 hours. Tlijs is to be used v^rhen there is a loose cough, a loose rattling 
breathing and the patient is unable to raise the mucus. 

Nursing and Diet. — If one is very chilly or has a chill and the lungs 
feel full and sore and if it is hard to breathe and move and there is a sense 
«f oppressioa over one side of the chest and perhaps some pain, you can then 
do nothing better than to take a good sweat. Hqt fomentations may be 
used or hot water bottles may be placed around the body aad especially to 
the feet and hips. At tlie same time drink large quantities of hot lemonade 
or hot teas such as horehound, ginger, hop or catnip. If the chill is very 
severe take the " Corn Sweat " as described in the " Nursing Department." 

A married lady living in town was taken sick with " grip " and pneumonia 
followed. The patient improved steadily and was doing nicely. The hus- 
band was a good-natured soul but was careless and allowed the fire to go 
out. The patient had a terrible chill as a consequence. They sent for me 
but I was in the country at the time (it was Sunday forenoon, I remem- 
ber). My wife went over to see if she could be of help and saw at once 
that a sweat was what was needed and so she applied the " Com Sweat " as 
I have described in the " Nursing Department," When I reached home in the 
afternoon I immediately went to see the patient and found her doing nicely. 
I said a few plain things to the husband about carelessness and then I went 
home to dinner. Husband and wife both gave my wife credit for saving 
the patient's life. She at least saved her days ®f distress and pain by the 
ptompt application of this effective remedy to produce sweating which was 
necessary in this case and this is just the means I would have taken had I 
been there myself. 

Rubbing the chest with camphioffated oil or camphor and lard is good. 
A mustard plaster is good but is likely to make the parts sore. A flaxseed 
poultice is good when put on and kept hot. Hops may be steeped, put into 
a bag a«d applied hot as can be b®rne. Put a dry flannel over stich appli- 
cations so that the surrounding parts do not get wet and chilled. Some people 
cannot bear moist heat. For them place sticks of stov« wood in the oven 
until very hot, wrap each piece with a clbth an-d place several of these sticks 
about the pastient. This will cause sweating and stop the chill or chilly 
feeling and the aching of the bones. At the same time you are using this 
treatna'ent apply a hot salt-bag to the sore lung er otJier sore parts. An 
onion poultice is g.o€>d but is better for br6nchitrs and laryngitis. 

Do not put much clothing on the patient. Let him wear a light flannel 
jacket open in front. Have the room bright, sunshiny and well aired. Have 
only one or two persons in the room. Carefully sponge the patient each 
day with warm water even when the temperature is not too high. This is 
to "be done carefully and gently. Keep the teeth, mouth and gums clean. 
Plain water or lemonade should be given freely. This also applies to bron- 
chitis, pleurisy and laryngitis. When the patient is delirious give water at 
fixed times, every fifteen minutes or longer. Watch the tongue and lips to 
see if the patient is thirsty. 

The iboS. sMould be tiquid, cl*ie% nfilk, dtfKr alone or, b'etter, mixed 
with food prepared f'rom some one of the cereals. Eggs, either soft boiled 
or raw, may also be given.

PEOPLE'S HOME REMEDIES.— (AlSO see some of the home remedies 
under colds, bronchitis, pleurisy, etc.) 

1. Herb Teas, Etc. — Have the patient sit for perhaps half an hour with 
his feet and legs in warm water and drink sage or pennyroyal tea. Put 
some bitter herbs such as tansy, horehound, bdneset, hops, smartweed and 
peach leaves into a vessel and boil. A handful of each herb may be used. Strip 
the patient, throw a blanket over his shoulders so that it comes to tlie floor 
about him and place the vessel under him, thus steaming the whole body. 
To keep the water steaming occasionally put in a hot brick. Continue this 
for half an hoilr, wipe the patieht off quickly and put him to bed. Then 
give warm teas such as sage, pertnyroyal or boneset and surround him with 
hot bricks. Keep him well covered atld let him sweat for several hours. 
Then wipe him dry, put on dry clothes and allow him to sleep. If there is 
pain in the chest, after giving a purgative place a pdultice of tahsy, hops 
and wormwood over the chest as hot as can be borhe. Change .this evehy 
hour or two. 

^. dnions. Rye Meal and Vinegar. — According to their size, take from 
6 to 10 onions, chop fine and put into a lai^ge spider or skillet over a hot 
fire and add the same quantity of tye meal, and vinegar enough to form a 
thick paste. Stir it thoroughly and let simmer 5 or 10 minutes. Put into a 
cotton bag large enough to cover the lungs and apply to the chest of the 
patient as hot as can be borne. When 'this gets cool apply another. Con- 
tinue re-heating the poultice as 3 or 4 applications may be necessary. The 
remedy should be applied until sweat starts freely from the chest. A lady 
in Akron, Ohio, says she can recommend this as being a most excelknt treat- 
ment for this too often fatal malady. 

3. Cotton Seed Meal, Tobacco, Etc. — Stir cotton seed meal into boiling 
water until thick enough to spread, stir a little tobacco in, or, in severe cases 
steep hops or smartweed before thickening. Apply the poultice over the 
lungs qitite warm. When wishing to replace it with a fresh one let the fresh 
one follow by rolling it pn as the old one is rolled off never letting the cold 
air strike the patient. When the poultice is removed cover with flannel or 
absorbent cotton. 

BLEEtJlNG FROM THE LUNGS. 
Haetnoptysis. 

Cause. — Bleeding from the luttgis is caused by the rupture of a blood 
vessel of the lungs. 

Symptoms. — The patieht spits blood or perhaps the blood runs from 
the mouth in a stream. Blood from the lungs is likely to be frothy because 
it is mixed with the air and it is generally of a bright red color while blood 
coming from the stomach is generally of a darker color. 

Treatment. — Have the patient lie down and remain quiet. Place ice, 
or cloths wrung out of cold water, to the chest artd to the back of the neck. 
To quiet him, if much frightened, give a hypodermic injection of Vs grain 
of morphine. Another remedy is to give 10 grains of bromide of potash. 
This may be repeated, 15 minutes between doses> until 3 doses have beeh 
taken. 

PEOPLE'S HOME REMEDIES.— 

1. Table Salt.- -Place the patient on a bed keeplttg the head alid shodl- 



DISEASES OF THE LUNGS. 121 

ders raised. Keep him quiet, allow plenty of fresh air and giye a teaspoonful 
or two of common table salt. 

Physician's Remark. — Salt acts as an astringent and contracts the blood ' 
vessels apd thus aids in stopping the bleeding. This is a simple home remedy 
one always has on hand and should be remembered in case of emergency. 

2. Ice and Alum. — Hold pieces of ice in the mouth swallowing it slowly 
as it melts. AJum used in the same way is also an effective remedy. 

Physician's Remark. — Alum is an astringent and aids in stopping bleed- 
ing in the same way as the Salt does. 

3. Witch Hazel. — Give some diluted witch hazel every 15 minutes until 
the bleeding stops. 

Physician's Remark. — This is better to stop bleeding after a tooth has 
been extracted or to stop bleeding from small wounds. 

4. Salt and Vinegar. — Raise the shoulders by the use of pillows, if the 
patient breathes easier that way, and keep him quiet. Sponge the chest with 
cold water and vinegar and give half a teaspoonful of dry salt. Continue 
giving small doses of salt if necessary as we have known it alone to save 
a number of lives where a doctor was not within reach. 

Physician's Remark. — This is a sensible treatment as it combines the 
instructions for keeping quiet, sponging with cold water and giving salt. 
Any of these are good alone and the three together are better. 

5. Tying with Cord. — Tie a cord about each thigh and about each arm 
above the felbow and bleeding from the lungs will stop almost instantly. 

Physician's Remark. — This is also a good treatment for a person who 
has fainted. 

PLEURISY. 
Inflammation of the Pleura. 

Description. — This is an inflammation of the serous membrane lining 
the cavity in which the lung's are situated and covering the lungs them- 
selves, As this membrane lines the chest and also covers the lungs, there 
are two serous surfaces touching each other and when one surface is in- 
flarned the other is likely to he also. Pleurisy is very painful. The pleura 
is likely to be inflamed in pneumonia and then we aie said to have pleuro- 
pneumonia- 

Symptoms. — There is a sharp, stitching pain and short, catchy breath- 
ing. The disease may set in with a chill, followed by fever and a severe 
.stitching pain in the side. This pain is terribly distressing and is usually 
referred to the nipples or toward the arm pit. It can be felt low down in 
the back. It is a sharp, stitching pain and is made worse by breathing and 
coughing. The fever is not very high but is higher on the affected side 
than on the sound side. The temperature may drop to normal at the end 
of a week or ten days. The coughing is an early symptom but is not so 
distressmg as in pneumonia. There is not much expectoration (spitting). 
In some cases there is left what is called " water in the chest " (hydro- 
thorax). Sometimes the chest must be tapped and this water drawn off. 
There is soinetimes pus in the chest after an acute attack of pleurisy and 
this is called purulent pleurisy. This sometimes follows other diseases and 
especially scarlet fever. This purulent pleurisy or empyema is met with 
under the following conditions : 

(a) As a result of sero-fibrinous pleurisy. 



123 THE PEOPLE'S HOME MEDICAL BOOK. 

(b) It is common as a secondary inflammation in various infectious 
diseases, among which scarlet fever takes first place. 

(c) It may result from local causes like fracture of the ribs, pene- 
trating wounds, malignant disease of the lungs and gullet, and perhaps most 
frequently of all, the perforation of the pleura by pus from tuberculous cav- 
ities. This pus may break through into the gullet, peritoneum, pericardium, 
or the stomach or even go down farther into the lower abdomen, or belly. 
This should always be looked for and especially if the original lung dis- 
ease continues for a long time. 

TREATMENT. — For purulent pleurisy there must be an operation fo; 
the removal of the pus so that the treatment here given applies more par- 
ticularly to the dry or acute pleurisy. 

Allopathic Treatment. — Small doses of either tincture of aconite or 
veratrum viride are good in the early stages. Of either of these medicines the 
dose for adults is 1 drop every half hour until the patient is slightly sick 
at the stomach or until the skin becomes moist. Then stop. At first you 
may give calomel oi epsom salts. One fourth grain of calomel is usually 
given every half hour until the bowels move. This is then followed with 
epsom salts if it is thought best to have the bowels move more freely. 

Allow rest and a liquid diet and for adults give Dover's powder at night. 

If necessary for the pain a hypodermic injection of ^ grain of morphine 
may be given to adults. A mustard plaster may be applied locally. For 
the pain in children small doses of codeine may be given. The dose is 1/85 
of a grain. 

Homeopathic Treatment.T-^Put 15 drops of the second dilution of Aconite 
into half a glass of water and into another half glass of water put 15 drops 
of the second dilution of Byronia. Alternate these two medicines giving two 
teaspoonfuls every half hour or every hour until the pain is relieved. 

Nursing and Diet. — Either leeches or adhesive plaster may be applied. 
Of course if the adhesive plaster is applied you cannot apply the leeches. 
In case you sweat the patient the plaster should be applied afterward for 
the plaster will be loosened if applied before sweating. Take strips of ad- 
hesive plaster 2 inches wide and when applied they should bp 'apped an inch 
each time. Begin at the backbone and bring the plaster around horizontally 
to the sternum or breastbone. Do not follow the ribs but bring the plaster 
around straight from the backbone to the breastbone. Apply from below 
upward and with enough pressure to prevent almost any movement of the 
wall of the chest on that side. Do not do this to children as their ribs 
are softer and bend too much. This treatment is also fine for broken or 
cracked ribs. 

Keep the patient warm and at rest. Hot drinks are good as they 
cause sweating and bring the blood to the surface, thus relieving the con- 
gested pleura. Cover the affected side with cotton sprinkled over with cam- 
phorated oil or camphor and lard. Or, you can put on a jacket poultice. Of 
course you qannot do these things if you have applied the adhesive plaster. 

If there is pus in the chest it must be removed by a surgeon and this 
also applies when there is water in the chest, if the water is not absorbed by 
treatment. 

Warm fomentations of hops or oats are good. Teas made of either 
Indian turnip or pleurisy root are also good. Give % ounce of the tea every 
1 to 2 hours. To promote expectoration (spitting) you may give a tea 



DISEASES OF THE LUNGS, 133 

made from comfrey, marshmallow or skunk cabbage. These teas should be 
sweetened with honey and sharpened with vinegar. 

In the first stages of pleurisy the treatment given for the first stages of 
pneumonia will apply. Gefthe patient warrn and in a good sweat. For this 
purpose you may use hot teas, a hot foot bath, hot fomentations or the appli- 
cation of dry heat. To apply dry heat you can use small pieces of stove wood 
heated in the oven and wrapped in cloth or a hot salt or sand bag or perhaps 
hot flatirons. Every one has bottles about the house. These may be filled 
with hot water, wrapped and placed near the patient. These will soon remove 
the chill. Get the patient to feeling warm and afterwards moist and sweaty. 
It is always a good plan after a sweat to bathe the patient under the clothes, 
using a sponge or cloth and tepid or warm water. Bathe but a small space 
and then dry before bathing more. After the bath, dry bed clothes and a 
clean dry night dress should be put on. 

A lady whom I was attending had a severe attack of pleurisy. After 
making two or three visits and finding that she was not getting along as I 
wished, I made an examination and found she was very " bilious " and in 
copsequence the skin was very yellow. I decided that this was the reason 
the medicines did not act well for the organs were dormant and not active as 
they should be. 

I told the nurse (an old experienced lady) to give the patient the " Corn 
Sweat " as I have described it in the " Nursing Department." The nurse told 
me that to cause sweating she frequently baked sticks of stove wood and 
placed them about the patient but I told her that in this case I wanted moist 
heat and so the patient was given the " Corn Sweat." 

I saw the nurse early the next morning and asked about the patient and 
if she had had a good sweat. The nurse replied that the patient had sweated 
very freely and was better and then added : " but you ought to have seen her 
night dress. It was all green caused by the throwing ofif of the bile and 
poisons." The patient improved rapidly and this was but one instance out 
of many where the " Corn Sweat " has saved several trips of the doctor to say 
nothing of the pain and suffering. The " Com Sweat " if used in time will 
save many doctor bills. ' 

PEOPLE'S HOME REMEDIES.— (Also see " People's Home Remedies " 
for pneumonia, bronchitis, etc.) 

1. Pleurisy Root. — Make a tea of pleurisy root and give half a teacup- 
ful every hour or two. This will promote sweating. 

2. Snake Root, Pleurisy Root and Blood Root. — A tea made of white 
snake root in combination with pleurisy root and blood root is good for lung 
troubles. Give from % an ounce to 4 ounces of the tea at a dose very 3 or 
4 hours. 

3. Boneset Tea. — At the beginning of pleurisy give boneset tea. Give 
from 1 to 4 ounces of the warm tea several times a day. 

4. Crawley Root'. — This is splendid for sweating purposes. Give from 
20 to 30 grains of the powdered root in hot water and repeat every hour 
or two. 

5. Pleurisy Root and Crawley Root. — Mix equal parts of powdered 
pleurisy root and powdered crawley root and give 30 grains in water as hot 
as the patient can drink. Repeat every hour or two. This will produce 
sweating. . 

6. Snake Root, Etc.— Keep the patient sweatmg gently by giving half 



124 THE PEOPLE'S MOME MEDICAL BOOK. 

a teaspoottful of compound tincture of Virginia snake root every two or three 
hours. If there is a bad cough frequently give a small dose of tea made from 
two parts each of pleurisy root arid wild chetry root and one part of blood 
root. 

7. Poke Root, Blood Robt, May Appld Root, Etc.— If the pleurisy is 
chronic apply a plaster to the chest made in the following way. Add a little 
wine to equal parts of beeswax and burgundy pitch. Melt these together and 
stir in a little poke t-oot, blood root and may apple root. Spread some of this 
on a piece of cotton and apply warm. Leave it on the chest iot a week 
or loftger. 

8. Compound SyfUp of Horseradish. — For coughs and Colds the C&m- 
pound Syrup of Horseradish will be found excellettt arid may be Used for the 
coughing in pleurisy, pneumonia and grip. Take 4 tablespoorifuls df grated 
fresh horseradish, 2 tablespoorifuls of boneSet leaves and tops, 1 tableSpooH- 
ful of Canada snake root, 2 pounds of sugar and a sUfficieut quaritlty of boil- 
ing water arid weak vinegar. Steep the boneset and snake root ih % pint 
of boiling water and press well, adding boiling water to it until i/^ P^ttt of 
tea is obtained; then add the sugar arid dissolve by slow heat. Add the 
horseradish to 14 P'nt of diluted vittegar; let stand for 2 days and theH press, 
adding more dihited vinegar to the mass until % pint of solution is obtained. 
Add this to the synip and shake until all the sugar is dissolved. Give from 
1 to 4 teaspoonfuls every 2 or 3 hours. 

ASTHMA, \ 
Bronchial Asthma. 

Causes. — This disease sottletimes runs in fattlilies and especially in 
families having irritable riervoiis systems. It may also follow other diseasfeS. 
It is more frequent with men thah with WOmett. Change of locatioti Causes 
it to come and go. Odo)-s may btirig on an attack as also tliay the bteathiflg 
of air filled with dust. 

Symptoms. — The attack Usually comes on at night. The patient struggles 
to breathe and has a sense of tightness across the chest and a whee^y cough 
which is hard at first and then softer and followed by raising a little mUCUs, 
causing the patient to feel easier. The patient is Compelled to sit Up in bed 
or go to the window to breathe and wheeze. It may run for several hours and 
it may last for days. It gets better gradually and the patient Speaks and 
coughs more easily. There may be the same train of symptoms for sevetal 
evenings. He may not sUflFer again for some time but the attacks are 
likely to return unless a cure is effected. 
TREATMENT.— 

Preventive. — The old saying that " an ounce of prevention is worth a 
pound of cUte " applies in the treatment of asthma, so I' will first give a pre- 
ventive for this disease. It is ais6 a cUre for individual attacks. 

Asthma Tincture. — Take 1/2 pound of quick lime and " slack " it by 
turning on 2 quarts of hot water and while it is " slacking " and boiling stir 
in 2 teaspoonfuls of tar, mix well and let settle. Take 1/2 pound of Wild or 
Indian turnip, V2 pound of fresh inilkweed, and a small handful of lobelia leaves, 
and bruise and steep these in 2 quarts of wine at a Sand heat for 24 hours; then 
press and strain and add the lime water arid bdttle at once. Dose — a wine- 
glassful 3 times a day for asthma. This asthma tincture is also good for 
coughs, hysterics, spasrtis atid consumption. 



DISEASES OF THE LUNGS. 125 

For use in the intervals between the attacks of asthma I will give 
another prescription. Take ^4 pound of liverwort, 14 pound of Solomon's 
seal, % pound of skunk cabbage, 1/4 pound of horehound and 2 ounces of 
blood root. Bruise these together, add water, boil until the strength is ex- 
tracted, strain and then boil down to 4 quarts and strain again. To this add 
5 pounds of honey and 1/2 pint of brandy and allow it to settle. Take a wine- 
glassful 3 01 4 times a day. Put a strengthening plaster on the chest. 

If there is difficult breathing take % ounce each of blood root, lobelia 
and pleurisy root ; bruise all and add 1 quart of wine. - Take a tablespoon- 
ful occasionally. 

Allopathic Treatment— For relief when threatened with asthma inhale 
nitrite of amyl for a few minutes. Smoke some of the powders used for this 
disease. A person with a strong heart can take tincture of lobelia. Give from 
1/2 to 1 teaspoonful at one dose and then repeat in 10-drop doses every % 
hour to 1 hour until circulation is depressed and the skin is moist and perspir- 
ing. This may make the patient sick at the stomach and cause him to vomit 
but to do any good this medicine must be used in these doses. 

Fluid extract of ipecac is also good. Give from 1 to 5 drops every 10 or 
15 minutes until sick at the stomach. Tincture of skunk cabbage may be 
taken in teaspoonful doses 3 tipies a day. Another remedy is the powdered 
root of the Indian turnip. Take 10 grains 3 times a day. 

Homeopathic Treatment.-— Give 1/100 of a grain of Tartar Emetic every 
y<2, hour until' the patient feels a little sick at the stomach. For a child use 
the third trituration of the same medicine. Give 1 tablet every half hour 
until relieved. 

Nursing and Diet. — Be careful of the diet and also about taking cold. Be 
on the outlook for other diseases. Examine the rectum and other openings 
and also the tonsils to see if they are all right. Also examine for heart disease. 
A patient who is subject to asthma should always have on hand some nitrite 
of amyl. When an attack comes on break one of the capsules into a handker- 
chief and inhale the odor for a few minutes. 

When the patient lives in a dry furnace-heated house it is well to put 
him into a bronchitis tent as described in the " Nursing Department." Steam 
kettles which are manufactured for the treatment of this disease are also 
good. You can put cotton saturated with the medicine into the receptacle for 
it and the steam from the water will go through the cotton and relieve the 
patient. The steam coming from the spout of this little kettle is not very 
hot and you can generally put your open mouth over the spout. If it is too 
hot you can make a roll with some writing paper and put one end over the 
spout while you inhale the steam from the other end. You must get the 
steam into the bronchial tubes. Here is a good soothing medicine to put 
upon the absorbent cotton. Take equal pa-rts of tincture of benzoin, oil of 
eucalyptus and oil of tar ; put a tablespoonful of this mixture upon the cotton 
and put into the receptacle prepared for it. Then light the alcohol lamp, 
fill the water basin half full of water and the saturated steam will soon 
appear. This little kettle can be purchased for ^bout $1.50. 

[PEOPLE'S HOME REMEDIES.— 

1. General Treatment. — Protect the chest with warm clothing. Do 
not sleep on, or handle, beds or pillows made either of feathers or straw but 
use a corn husk mattress and a husk or air pillow. Do not use straw mat- 
ting in the house or straw under the carpets. There seems to be small par- 



126 THE PEOPLE'S HOME MEBICAL BOOK. 

tides flying from matting and straw that irritate the air passages. Use 
every precaation against taking cold. Discard GOBsets and do not wear low 
necked dresses. Never sit down or lie down with damp feet. Keep the feet 
warm ^nd the nerves quiet. Some relief may be obtained by burning or 
smokinFf a Uttle saltpeter paper in the room. Prepare the paper in the follow- 
ing v/av and keep it on hand for use. Dissolve a tablespoonful of saltpeter 
in a teacupful of water. Pour this over some strips of brown paper placed in 
a plate and let it stand for a few hours, then dry the papers in the sun and 
save for use. When needed burn one of these papers in the room and breathe 
the smoke. 

Physician's Remark. — The lady sending the above must have had experi- 
ence with asthma for she gives some good practical advice. 

2. Alum and Molasses. — An excellent remedy is to take a teaspoonful 
of powdered alum mixed with a little molasses every 15 minutes until it 
causes vomiting. 

3. Mustard Poultice. — Relief is often obtained by applying a strong 
mustard poultice over the stomach and chest. 

Physician's Remark. — Mustard irritates, causing the tubes to dilate and 
thus aids the breathing. 

4. Tobacco or Stramonium Leaves. — In some cases the smoking of 
either tobacco or stramonium leaves gives a great dea,l of relief. 

Physician's Remark. — The fumes enter the bronchial tubes and act di- 
rectly upon them and smoking these herbs is therefore better than taking 
them as medicine. 

5. Saltpeter. — For spvasmodic asthma soak a sheet of unglazed paper 
in a solution of saltpeter for 15 or 20 minutes, then fold and dry it in an 
oven. When an attack comes on light one end of the paper allowing it to 
burn so that the patient may inhale the fumes. 

Physician's Remark. — A few drops of tincture of benzoin sprinkled upon 
the paper makes it more effective. Saltpeter paper and stramonium leaves 
when smoked and the fumes inhaled often relieve attacks of asthma. 

6. Lobelia Tea. — Steep an ounce of dry lobelia leaves in a pint of 
water and give a tablespoonful every 15 minutes until it produces vomiting. 
The tincture of lobelia is also used. The doje is from 15 to 60 drops. 

7. Mullein Leaves and Saltpeter. — Soak some dried mullein leaves in 
a solution of saltpeter and water, dry and put aside till needed. When re- 
quired, burn one of these leaves and inhale the smoke. 

Physician's Remark. — The smoking of mullein leaves alOne is considered 
by many to be a good remedy for asthma and others have found the salt- 
peter to be good. Then why should not the two together be a good combi- 
nation ? 

8. Vinegar, Turpentine and Egg. — Take a cupful of vinegar; add a 
wineglassful of turpentine and 1 egg; beat together and use as a liniment 
on the chest. 

Physician's Remark. — This produces counter irritation. 

9. Poplar Bark Tea. — Take a tea made by steeping white poplar bark 
in water. The dose is half a wineglassful. 



DISEASES OF THE HEART, ARTERIES 
AND VEINS. 



(Diseases of the Organs of Circulation.) 

Description of the Heart and Valves. — The heart is a hollow muscular 
organ somewhat the shape of a cone and it is located between the right 
and left lungs. It is placed obliquely in the chest, with the broad end or 
base directed upward, backward and to the right, and lies between points on a 
line with the 5th and 8th dorsal vertebrae. The point, or apex, of the heart 
is downward, forward and to the left and corresponds to the space between 
the cartilages of the 5th and 6th ribs, % of an inch to the inner side and 1% 
inches below the left nipple or about 3% inches from the middle line of the 
breast bone (sternum). The base or large end of the heart is placed behind 
the breast bone and extends farther into the left than into the right half of the 
cavity of the chest. About one-third of the heart lies to the right and % to the 
left of the middle of the breast bone. It lies behind the middle portion of both 
breast bone and the costal cartilages of the 3rd, 4th, 5th and 6th ribs of both 
sides. In a grown person the heart measures about 5 inches in length, 3% 
inches in breadth at its broadest part and 2% inches thick. 

The heart is divided into right and left sides by a muscular wall (septum) 
which runs lengthwise of the heart. The right side is called the right or 
pulmonary heart and the left side is called the left or systemic heart. The 
right side is called the pulmonary heart because it sends the blood to the lungs 
and the left side is called the systemic heart because it sends the blood 
all through the system. Another wall or constriction in the heart divides 
each half into an upper and lower cavity. The two upper cavities are 
called auricles and the two lower cavities are called ventricles. We thus have 
a right and a left auricle and a right and a left ventricle. The auricles occupy 
the base or large end of the heart. The right side of the heart contains ' 
venous or impure blood and the left side contains arterial or pure blood. 

Plan of Circulation. — From the general system the venous or impure 
blood enters the right auricle and from there it goes down into the right 
ventricle through an opening guarded by the tricuspid valves and it leaves the 
right ventricle through an opening guarded by the pulmonary semilunar valves. 
From the heart the impure blood is carried by the pulmonary artery to the 
lungs to be purified. It circulates through the lungs and gives off its impuri- 
ties and takes in fresh oxygen from the air. The pulmonary vein brings the 
blood from the lungs, after being purified, back to the heart. It iirst enters 
the left auricle and then goes through an opening, guarded by the mitral 
valve, down into the left ventricle. The blood is forced from the left 
ventricle through an opening guarded by the aortic semilunar valves. It is 
carried from the heart by tihe aorta artery and this divides and subdivides 
into many srtialler arteries so that the blood reaches every part of the body 
and gives up its oxygen to the various parts and takes in the impurities. It

is then collected by the veins and carried back to the heart and thus it con- 
tinues making its tour of the body as long as we live. 

We have spoken of a number of valves in the heart. If these valves 
become weakened or diseased they cannot entirely close the openings of the 
heart and part of the blood flows back each time with a gurgling sound 
called regurgitation. 

EMERGENCY REMEDIES OR WHAT TO DO IN CASE OF HEART 

FAILURE. 

Persons having heart disease should always keep Certain remedies on 
hand to be used in case of emergency. We will mention several of these 
remedies and tell how they should be used and the members of the house- 
hold should become familiar with them and their uses. 

Nitrite of amyl perles should always be at hand and one who has heart 
trouble should always carry some of these cajpsules with him. Break one 
into a handkerchief and inhale the fumes for a few minutes when you feel a 
fainting attack corning on. 

Buy some tablets containing 1/60 of a grain of strychnine and when 
an attack comes on give one of tnese tablets and if necessary repeat in from 
Yz hour to 1 hour if no other medicine like digitalis has beeii giveh. N'eVer 
give more ,than the two doses and never give but one dose if other heart 
medicines have been given. Strychnine is good when there is a weak and 
faint feeling caused by over exertion, anger, etc. * 

Also keep a one or two-ounce bottle of digitalis within teach. You can 
give 5 drops and repeat the dose in 10 minutes and again in half ian hour if 
necessary. If it works well the patient can breathe easiei" and if necessary 
it may then be taken 4 times a day for the next two days. Digitalis may be 
given also when but one of the strychnine tablets abovfe have been given. 
Do not give more than one dose of the strychnine if you Use digitalis, brandy 
or whiskey. 

Besides these remedies there should also be at hand some spirits of 
camphor or ammonia to smell of and some brandy or whiskey for a stimulant 
and for palpitation caused by stomach trouble. For gas on the stomach 
which distresses the heart it is well to keep Some baking soda, gihger or 
peppermint at hand. 

In case of emergency you can then give the patient the amyl, camphor 
or ammonia to smell of and also give either strychnine or the digitalis or if 
these are not at hand you can give either the whiskey, brandy, ginger, piepper- 
mint or soda according to the case. If the patient can breathe easily he 
should be laid flat but if the breathing is difficult he should be propped Up in 
bed with plenty of pillows to support him. See that the amis and legs have 
proper support. Remember that the patient must have plenty of fresh air 
but that it should be .warm as patients suflfering from an attack of heart 
trouble feel the cold intensely. Avoid all sudden movements and noises that 
would startle the patient. 

Nursing and Diet. — A person with heart trouble should be kept in a com- 
fortable position. This is sometimes difficult to do owing to dropsy and 
difficult breathing which causes bodily distress and restlessness. If it is diffi- 
cult for the patient to breathe he should be kept pro)3ped up in bed or in an 
easy chair with plenty of pillows to provide rest for the arms. Avoid move- 
ments and noises that will startle the patient. Admit plenty oi warm fresh a^r. 



DISEASES OF THE HEART. 139 

The diet must be carefully regulated. There is always a tendency toward 
flatulence, or wind in the stomach and bowels, in heart disease. Foods such 
as starch and sugar tend to increase this gas and should be avoided. But 
little liquid should be given when there is dropsy. A milk diet is best during 
any heart disease and is often improved by giving the whites of eggs, etc., 
in it. Be careful to keep the bowels regular and the kidneys working freely. 
The stomach should not be overloaded and the patient should not eat any 
food that disagrees with him or that produces gas. The gas will press upon 
the heart by distending the stomach and cause much distress. The patient 
should not take stimulants and especially alcohol. The bowels must be kept 
open by laxatives if necessary. If the kidneys do not act freely make a tea 
of digitalis which is commonly known as foxglove and give from 1 to 4 tea- 
spoonfuls every 3 or 4 hours for a few days. The tincture of digitalis should 
not be given without directions from the doctor unless it is an emergency 
case. 

A person who is affected with disease of the heart should lead a life 
free from excitement, worry, grief and trouble. He should never hurry and 
should never run or over-do in any way. The heart must not be overworked. 

When one having heart trouble has a bad spell or suffers from an attack 
of shortness of breath with difficult and distressing breathing and the pulse 
is irregular and either weak or fast, you can give 5 drops of digitalis in a 
little water. This may be repeated in 10 minutes and again in half an hour 
if necessary. Two hours later you can give another dose and for the next 
two days it may be given four times a day if necessary but shoujd not be 
continued longer. 

If a person with heart disease is taken with a weak faint attack and is 
unable to sit up and must lie down, a tablet containing 1/60 of a grain of 
strychnine would be a good thing to give. The patient should also smell 
of camphor or ammonia or amyl. Hot brandy or whiskey is good in such cases 
and especially if the spell is caused by a bad stomach. The liquor causes the 
gas to come up and this relieves the patient. Remember that any one who 
feels faint should lie down with his head low if he can breathe in that position. 
The clothes round the neck and waist should be loosened and fresh air must 
be admitted to the room. 

Ginger, peppermint and soda are also good for the gas on the stomach, 
but soda must be used with caution when there is organic heart trouble. It 
will relieve the gas in a few moments but right at first it is likely to distend 
the stomach and if the heart is in a very bad condition it might be dangerous by 
causing more pressure on the heart. 
PEOPLE'S HOME REMEDIES FOR PALPITATION OF THE HEART. 

1. Tincture of Ginger. — Take half a teaspoonful of tincture of ginger 
every hour. 

2. Baking Soda. — Drink half a glass of water with a teaspoonful of soda 
dissolved in it. 

3. Table Salt. — If it is caused by the stomach and comes on upon 
lying down at night, eat a little table salt. The lady sending this recipe 
advises that the patient lie on the back or right side and says that a very 
small lump of salt has given her many a night's sleep. 

4. Magnesia, Charcoal, Brandy and Cayenne Pepper. — If there is a sour 
stQmach take magnesia or prepared charcoal. Also put a little cayenne 
jpepper into some brandy sad give that. 





130 THE PEOPLE'S HOME MEDICAL BOOK. 

Physician's Remark. — If stomach trouble is the cause this treatment will 
help that and consequently relieve the heart trouble. 

5. Breathing. — Persons who are subject to palpitation should abstain 
from coffee, tea, tobacco and liquors. When an attack comes on the patient 
should lie upon the back and draw in full breaths of air to fill the lungs. 

Physician's Remark. — This is good advice to follow in this trouble. 

COMPENSATION AND FAILURE OF COMPENSATION. 

The heart has a certain reserve force by which it can for a time do more 
work than it is usually called upon to perform, and which, when any part 
of the heart becomes diseased, often allows of its adjusting itself to the new 
conditions thus warding off the ill effects of the disease. This reserve force 
is called " compensation." A person may have heart disease for years with- 
out knowing it or being inconvenienced by it beyond an occasional shortness 
of breath when climbing or walking quickly. If, for any reason, the heart 
ceases to adjust itself to the conditions forced upon it by disease, there is 
said to be " failure of compensation." 

ENLARGEMENT OF THE HEART— DILATATION. 

Dilatation of the heart means enlargement of the cavities of the heart, 
Dilatation is frequently one of the means by which the heart adjusts itseli 
to the extra work forced upon it by disease. Hypertrophy is an enlargement 
of the heart due to an increased thickness, total or partial, in the muscular 
walls of the heart. It is the principal factor in compensation. It sometimes 
causes headache, roaring in the ears, flushing of the face and " heart pain." 
Dilatation is an increase in size of one or more chambers or cavities of 
the heart either with or without thickening of the muscular walls. Generally 
enlargement of the cavities and of the walls of the heart go together. The en- 
largement may affect the entire heart, one side, or only one chamber. As 
the ventricles do the chief work in forcing the blood through the arteries it 
is natural that the change or enlargement is most frequently found in them. 

Symptoms. — There is a sense of fullness and discomfort, rarely amount- 
ing to pain, about the heart. This may be very noticeable when the patient 
is lying on his left side. There may be palpitation, headaches, flushes in the 
face, noises in the ears and there may be flashes. A physical examination 
shows a weak and enlarged heart. The heart sounds are not normal. The 
pulse is small, weak, quick and often irregular. 

TREATMENT.— 

You must treat the disease that causes it. Look after the kidneys and 
toxic (poison) diseases such as typhoid fever, scarlet fever, etc. 

NEUROSIS. 

Description. — This is a nervous affection of the heart in which there is 
no real heart disease. 

Causes. — It occurs most frequently in connection with hysteria, dis- 
tention of the stomach and anemia and as the result of the over use of to- 
bacco or stimulants. 

Symptoms. — The symptoms occur only in paroxysms. There is violent, 
rapid and often irregular heart action, heart pain, difficulty in breathing and 
a feeling' of suffocation. 



DISEASES OF THE HEART. 131 

TREATMENT.— 

Stop the use of tobacco and alcohol if that be the cause. Treat the 
anemia, hysteria or other disease that causes it. 

FATTY HEART. 

This is often caused by over-eating, a lazy inactive life, lack of exercise 
and too much drinking of liquors. 

REGURGITATION. 

This is flowing back of the blood due to improper or insufficient closing 
of the valves of the heart. It is most commonly the result of endocarditis. 
Treat the cause. 

STENOSIS. 

This is due to the thickening of the valve and the obstruction of the 
blood flow. If the mitral valve is affected it is called mitral stenosis and if 
the aortic valve is affected it is called aortic stenosis. 

BREAST PANG— ANGINA PECTORIS. 

The real angina pectoris is a rare disease. It is really but a symptom 
going with hardening of the root of the aorta and changes in the coronary 
arteries and with other diseased conditions of the heart. 

Symptoms. — It is marked by paroxysms of agonizing pain in the region 
of the heart and extending into the neck and arms. In violent attacks there 
is a sensation of impending death. 

Treatment. — A doctor must always be called for violent heart pain. 
The patient should lead a quiet life. During the attack inhale nitrite of 
amyl. Break one of the perles or capsules containing from 2 to 5 drops 
upon the handkerchief and inhale. If this fails to give relief in a few min- 
utes the patient should take a few breaths of chloroform. If the pain con- 
tinues take a hypodermic injection of % grain of morphine. ' Smell of cam- 
phor or ammonia. Always keep the feet warm. Do not over exercise when 
affected with any heart trouble. Let the bicycle alone, do not run for cars or 
trains and do not hurry in any way. 

PERICARDITIS. 

Description. — The pericardium is a membrane or sac surrounding the 
heart. Pericarditis is inflammation of this membrane. 

Causes. — It usually develops from other diseases such as rheumatism, 
Bright's disease, diphtheria, etc. 

Symptoms. — There is fever, distress, tenderness and sometimes pain at 
the heart and radiating from it. There is a rapid, feeble and irregular pulse. 
There is anxiety, sickness at the stomach and vomiting and in some cases 
there is a short hacking cough. Toward the end there is pallor, coldness, a 
livid face and swelling of the • face and extremities. The sac sometimes 
fills with water. 

Treatment. — Apply the ice bag and observe absolute quiet. Aconite and 
digitalis may do some good but it is doubtful. The diet should be light, 
dry and nutritious for there is often an accumulation of water before the 
disease has lasted long. Use blisters for the water. Treat symtoms as they 
arise. 



132 THE PEOPLE'S HOME MEDICAL BOOK. 

ENDOCARDITIS. 
(Acute, Malignant and Chronic.) 

This is an inflammation of the membrane lining the inside of the heart, 
It is usually confined to the valves and it occurs in two or three forms. The 
simple or acute kind is characterized by growths on the valves or membrane 
and with loss of substance in the valve tissues. The chronic kind is a slow 
hardening change resulting in thickening, puckering and deformity. The 
simple or acute kind is usually found with some other affection. It is 
frequently associated with acute articular (joint) rheumatism, and tonsilitis 
may be complicated with it. It is not uncommon in scarlet fever but is rare 
in measles, chicken-pox, diphtheria, small-pox and typhoid fever. In pneu- 
monia all kinds are common. The acute simple kind is very frequent in 
fatal cases of St. Vitus's dance or chorea. Endocarditis is met with also in 
cancer, gout, diabetes and simple acute Bright's disease. 

Symptoms of Acute Kind. — The symptoms are not very characteristic. 
In acute rheumatism the heart beats faster and is slightly irregular and the 
fever increases without more joint trouble. There is sometimes difficulty 
in breathing. You must always watch the heart in acute rheumatism. 

Malignant endocarditis is usually secondary to some other disease and 
is really an intensified acute endocarditis. 

Acute endocarditis frequently runs into chronic endocarditis. The hard- 
ening (sclerosis) may be primary but is often secondary to acute endocar- 
ditis. The hardening leads to deformity of the valves and is the foundatioij. 
for chronic valvular heart disease. Alcohol, syphilis and gout appear to be 
capable of causing this hardening. Another cause is the strain of prolonged 
and heavy muscular exertion like heavy lifting. This disease may cause 
hardening of the aortic valves in young people and middle aged men. 

CHRONIC VALVULAR HEART DISEASE. 
Description. — This is due to a diseased condition of the valves. The 
hardening causes weak valves or stenosis. This weakness of the valves and 
stenosis (narrowing) may exist alone or together. This narrowing parti- 
ally hinders the normal outflow of blood and the weakness of the valves* 
■ permits the blood current to take a wrong course and part of the blood 
flows backward. In either narrowing or weakness the effect is dilatation or 
enlargement of a cavity of the heart. In stenosis, or narrowing, the result is 
an increase in the difficulty which the chamber has in expelling the blood 
through the narrow opening. If there is insufficiency or weakness of the valve 
the result is the over filling of a chamber of the heart by blood coming into 
it from an improper source, for instance, in mitral insufficiency or weakness, 
of the mitral valve between the left ventricle and left auricle, the blood flows 
into the left auricle from the pulmonary vein as it should do but the blood 
also flows into it from the left ventricle and stretches the walls of the auricle, 
causing dilatation and finally enlargement. This flowing back of the blood 
is most commonly caused by weakness in the valves but may be caused by an 
abnormally large orifice or opening so that the valve does not entirely close 
it. This trouble is more frequent in males and affects chiefly able bodied 
vigorous men of middle age. 

Symptoms. — Headache, dizziness, flashes of light and a feeling of faint- 
ness on rising quickly are among the earliest symptoms. Palpitation and 
heart distress are common on slight exertion. The pain may be dull, aching 



■'•'',

DISEASES OF THE HEART. 133 

and confined to the heart region but more frequently it is sharp and radiating 
and is felt up the neck and down the arms and particularly the inside of the 
left arm. Attacks of true breast pang are more frequent in this than in 
any other valvular disease. As the disease progresses there is shortness of 
breath and swelling of the feet. The patient must sit up in a chair to sleep. 
The attacks are likely to come on at night. 

AORTIC STENOSIS. 

Aoftic stenosis, or narrowing, is not nearly as common as insufficiency 
or weakness. 

Symptoms. — The early symptoms are due to a defective blood supply to 
the brain causing dizziness and fainting. There is palpitation and pain 
about the heart and also breast pain. These symptoms are not so marked 
as when there is weakness or insufficiency. 

MITRAL VALVE INCOMPETENCY. 

This weakness or insufficiency of the mitral valve ensues: 

(a) From changes in the valve segments whereby they are contracted 
and shortened, usually combined with changes in the tendinous cords inside 
the ventricle or with more or less narrowing of the orifice or opening. 

(b) As a result of changes in the muscular walls of the ventricle ; either 
dilatation, so that the valve segments fa'il to close an enlarged opening, or 
changes in the muscular substance so that the segments are imperfectly con- 
tracted during the systole or contraction of the heart. The common causes 
producing insufficiency are endocarditis which causes a gradual thickening 
at the edges of the valves, contraction of the tendinous cords, and union of 
the edges of the segments. These segments are parts that make up the valve. 
In the majority of cases there is not only weakness or insufficiency but some 
narrowing, or stenosis, as well. 

Symptoms. — These may come on gradually and the patient may not be 
aware that he has heart trouble on account of perfect compensation or ad- 
justment of the heart to the conditions. He may perhaps experience a little 
shortness of breath on exertion or on going up stairs. It is only when the heart 
has not adjusted itself to the changed conditions or fails to continue to do so 
that the patient begins to be troubled. 

While the compensation is still good, and before the appearance of any 
marked symptoms, patients with extreme incompetency often have a con- 
gested appearance of the face and the lips and ears have a bluish tint. In 
long standing cases, particularly in children, the ends of the fingers may be 
larger and there is shortness of breath on exertion. The patients have a 
tendency toward attacks of bronchitis or bleeding from the lungs because of 
the congested condition. 

Sooner or later comes a period of disturbed or broken compensation in 
which the most intense symptoms are those of venous engorgements (con- 
gestion in the veins). There is palpitation, a weak irregular heart and signs 
of dilatation. Hard difficult breathing is a prominent feature and there may 
be coughing. A distressing symptom is the heart " sleep start," in which, 
just as the patient falls asleep, he wakes gasping and feeling as if his heart 
was stopping. There is usually a slight blueness and even a yellow tint to 
the skin. There may be coughing with bloody or watery expectoration 



134 THE PEOPLE'S HOME MEDICAL BOOK. 

(spitting). There may also be dropsy beginning in the feet. On putting 
the ear over the heart there is heard a blowing sound which ife loudest at 
the point of the heart. 

MITRAL STENOSIS. 

Description. — This is a narrowing of the mitral opening. 

Causes. — This is usually the result of valvular endocarditis occurring in 
the earlier years of life and very rarely one is born with it. It is very much 
more common in men than in women. Rheumatism is more common with 
boys than with girls and it is well known that endocarditis c^f the mitral 
valve is more common in rhetimatism. Anemia and chlorosis occur oftener 
in girls, however, and these sometimes produce endocarditis. 

Symptoms. — In children the lower part of the breast bone and 5th and 
6th left costal cartilages are often pron;iinent owing to enlargement of the 
right ventricle. In ausculation (listening with the ear and instrument), 
at the inner side of the point of the heart there is usually heard a rough or 
purring sound. This is characteristic only when compensation is maintained. 
Finally, upon failure of compensation, other sharp sounds are heard. Fol- 
lowing the failure of compensation are rapid and irregular action of the 
heart, shortness of breath, coughing and signs of lung engorgement, etc. 
Perhaps a majority of cases of mitral stenosis are not attended with dropsy. 

TRICUSPID VALVE DISEASE. 

Occasionally this results from acute or chronic endocarditis with puck- 
ering. More commonly the condition is one of relative insufficiency or weak- 
ness and is secondary to lesions of the valves on the left side and particularly 
of the mitral valve. It is also met with in all Conditions of the lungs which 
cause obstructed circulation, such as hardening and emphysema and partic- 
ularly in combination with chronic bronchitis. 

TRICUSPID STENOSIS. 

Stenosis means " narrowing." This may be congenital or acquired. 
Symptoms. — Blueness of the lips and face is a very common symptom 
and in the late stages, when dropsy comes on, it is likely to be intense. 

PULMONARY VALVE DISEASE. 

Murmurs in this region are extremely common but lesions of the 
valves are exceedingly rare. Pulmonary stenosis is almost invariably con- 
genital, that is, the patient is born with it. The signs are very uncertain. 

PULMONARY INSUFFICIENCY. 

This is very rare. 

GENERAL TREATMENT OF HEART DISEASE. 

The treatment must be directed to the conditions and symptoms such 
as dropsy, etc. The patient should live an equable life and maintain an 
even temper and in the dangerous conditions should observe absolute rest. 
Anger, excitement, rush, hurry and overdoing are very dangerous. Avoid 
going up and down stairs and doing any work that requires placing or 



DISEASES OF THE HEART. 135 

holding the arms higher than the head. Persons afflicted with heart trouble 
should always keep proper medicines on hand both for regular taking and 
for emergencies. (See Emergency Treatment.) 

ARTERIO SCLEROSIS. 

In this disease the blood vessels become weaker, crooked and more 
likely to break or rupture. 

Causes. — It is caused by age and intemperance in eating and drinking. 
Mental and physical over exertion, syphilis and gout are other causes. 

Treatment. — There is very little you can do for it except to keep the 
patient in good condition. Do not over exert. 

ANEURISM. 

This is a local dilatation of an artery and is due to the weakening of the 
wall or coat of the artery so that it is unable to stand the pressure of the 
blood. The coats of the blood vessel are thinned and one of the coats may 
be worn through. There is a lump in the artery and a purring sound may be 
heard upon putting the ear to it. 

Treatment. — Rest and a quiet life and an operation if possible. 

VARICOSE VEINS. 
Varix. 

Description. — By this is meant an enlarged, crooked and knotty condi- 
tion of the veins. In general use this term is usually applied to the veins 
of the extremities and particularly to those of the legs. The disease begins 
by a slow dilatation or enlargement of the vein which gradually becomes 
thickened and crooked. It generally affects only the veins near the surface. 

Causes. — (a) It occurs more frequently in females than in males and 
often follows enlargement of the womb from any cause, (b) The tendency 
toward varicose veins increases with advanced age. (c) It may be caused 
by obstructing the flow of the blood in the veins. Tight garters or other 
tight clothing may thus cause it. (d) Occupations which require much 
standing may be the cause, (e) It is also due to tumors of the pelvis, preg- 
nancy and diseases of the heart and lungs. 

Treatment. — Apply a local elastic bandage or a perfectly fitting silk 
elastic stocking. Sometimes an operation is necessary and part of the vein 
is removed. Remove the causes and attend to the bowels, liver, heart and 
lung conditions. Observe quiet and keep off the feet as much as possible. 
PEOPLE'S HOME REMEDIES.— 

1. Alum Water, Lead Water or White Oak Tea. — For varicose veins 
bathe the affected parts with alum water, lead water or a tea made from 
white oak bark. 

2. Plantain and Burdock Leaves. — Bruise some plantain and burdock 
leaves and bind upon the affected parts. 

Physician's Remarks. — All the ingredients containe4 in the two remedies 
ajjove are good because of their astringent qualities. 

3. Alcohol. — For varicose veins, bathing the parts freely with cold 
water or dilute alcohol will be found beneficial at the commencement of 
the trouble. After they have become knotted or painful a laced stocking 
should be worn. 



DISEASES OF THE BLOOD. 

(Including diseases of the ductless glands.) 



ANEMIA. 



In anemia the blood lacks the normal quantity of red cells or of hemo- 
globin in the cells. 

Following we will treat Chlorosis or Primary Anemia, Seconaary Anemia 
and Pernicious Anemia. 

GREEN SICKNESS— CHLOROSIS. 
Primary or Essential Anemia. 

This is a condition of the blood usually met with in young girls. It is 
characterized by the small quantity of hemoglobin and red cells in the blood. 

Symptoms. — There is a peculiar pallor of the skin which often has a 
greenish hue. This is why it is called " green sickness." The patient is 
nearly, if not always, plump and possessed of a good quantity of fat. The 
patient may be ruddy looking and the disease is then called " Chlorosis 
Florida." Difficult breathing, palpitation of the heart, dizziness and perhaps 
attacks of partial fainting are some of the symptoms. There is always con- 
stipation. The patient is gloomy and dull. 

Treatment. — The treatment is somewhat similar to the treatment of the 
secondary form of anemia. Pay particular attention to the bowels and keep 
them open. Larger doses of iron are needed than for the secondary form but 
the iron is likely to be constipating. 

SECONDARY ANEMIA. 

Causes. — Most cases of anemia belong to this class and are due to loss 
of blood or one of the infectious diseases. Sometimes it comes from breath- 
ing foul air and factory girls and stenographers frequently are affected. Over- 
work and insufficient and improper food are also causes. 

Symptoms. — There is marked paleness and the cheeks may have no color ; 

or, they may have color and even then the patient may suffer from palpitation 

,,of the heart. Headache, neuralgia, loss of appetite, constipation and attacks of 

fainting are sometimes due to anemia and in women to amenorrhea or no 

monthly flow. 

Treatment. — Remove the causes. Eat a proper diet and live a hygienic 
life with plenty of fresh air, sunshine and outdoor exercise. Iron and arsenic 
and sometimes bitter tonics are used. For the constipation give cascara sag- 
rada and especially if iron is given for iron is constipating. Stimulate the 
appetite with drugs like nux vomica, quinine or other bitter tonics like carda- 
mon or gentian. The following is a good prescription for this trouble. Take 
5 grains of reduced iron, Ys grain of arsenious acid and 5 grains of extract of 
nux vomica. Make this into 20 pills and take one after each meal. In some 
cases you can use 2 grains of quinine in place of the nux vomica. If the 
stomach is in poor condition dilute hydrochloric acid in 5-drop doses and 
pepsin in 5-grain doses or pancreatin and soda or taka-diastase in 3 or 3-grain 

136 



DISEASES OF THE BLOOD. 13? 

'doses with the meals are advisable. Or, you can take the elixir taka-diastase in 
1 to 2 teaspoonful doses. 

PERNICIOUS ANEMIA. 

This is very often a fatal malady. 

Symptoms. — The symptoms are those of severe anemia. There is a 
lemon colored skin and thin blood which coagulates slowly. There is a 
tendency to bleeding into the skin and mucous membrane. In severe cases 
pus may form around the edges of the teeth. 

LEUKEMIA. 
(The Blood Sufferers.) 
There are an extraordinary number of the white cells of the blood with 
alterations in the bone marrow. 

Cause. — The cause is as yet unknown. 

Treatment. — The treatment is not very satisfactory. Large doses of 
arsenic will delay the advance of the disease and may do some good. Give 
5 drops of Fowler's solution of arsenic 3 times a day. 

HEMOPHYLIA. 

This is when the blood does not clot normally. The treatment is to 
build up the system with tonics. 

PURPURA. 

This is the escaping of small quantities of the blood into the skin. 

Treatment. — Eat easily digested and nutritious food and remain in the 
sunshine all day. Give tonics such as iron, arsenic, gentian, quinine or co- 
lumbo. 

PEOP];.E'S HOME REMEDIES FOR THE BLOOD.— Including Syrups, 
Herbs Remedies and Blood Purifiers. 

1. Cider, Yellow Dock and Horseradish. — To 1 quart of hard cider 
add 1 ounce of yellow dock root and % ounce of horseradish. Take a wine- 
glassful 4 times a day. This is one of the best blood purifiers known and 
saves you the dollar you would otherwise pay the druggist for a patent medi- 
cine as it can be made at home. 

Physician's Remark. — Both the yellow dock and the horseradish are alter- 
atives. 

3, Onions. — Raw onions eaten either with or without vinegar are the 
best blood purifiers known. Then why pay a dollar a bottle for some patent 
mcuicine that does not have half the virtue of the onions. 

3. The Great German Blood Purifier. — Take a double handful each of 
wild cherry bark and the roots of burdock, yellow dock and dandelion; put 
these into 3 quarts of water and boil down to a quart; strain, and sweeten 
with sugar if preferred. The dose is a tablespoonful before each meal. This 
is excellent to cleanse the blood when one has either boils or carbuncles. An 
equal quantity of nearly any good blood purifier would cost you two or three 
dollars at the drug store. Take these common herbs and make them up 
yourself and you will have a quart of the best blood medicine in the world 
and at no cost whatever save the time spent in preparing it. 

Physician's Remark. — Burdock and yellow dock are alteratives; the 
former acts more on the kidneys and bowels and the latter on the blood. 
Wild cherry is more of a tonic and sedative.

DISEASES OF THE SPLEEN. 
Diseases of the spleen do not generally exist independently but come 
from other diseases. The spleen is swollen in typhoid fever, malaria, hard- 
ened liver, etc. 

PEOPLE'S HOME REMEDIES.— 

1. Salt and Yolk of Egg. — For chronic inflammation of the spleen 
apply over that organ a plaster made of salt and the yellow of an egg. 

2. Table Salt. — For chronic inflammation of the spleen take I dram of 
common table salt 3 times a day. 

3. Wine and White Oak Bark. — For " ague cake," which is enla'-re- 
ment of the spleen, boil the inner bark of white ash in some white wine and 
take a wineglassful 3 times a day. 

HODGKIN'S DISEASE. 

Description. — In this disease there is a marked swelling and over-growth 
of the lymphatic glands, both internal and external. 

Symptoms; — ^There is shortness of breath and palpitation. There are 
enlarged glands and a bronze skin. Enlarged masses of the glands in the 
neck and the groin are associated with puffiness of the face. 

Treatment. — Give 5 drops of Fowler's solution of arsenic 3 times daily 
for a week. 

GOITRE. 
Bronchocele — Thyrocele. 

The thyroid gland is on the. front part of the neck. All enlargements 
of this gland are called goitres. 

Treatment. — Apply compound tincture of iodine externally and internally 
give iodide of potash, 5 grains 4 times a day. Also give blood purifiers. 

Personally I prescribe the compound tincture of iodine both externally 
and internally. Externally you must use enough to make the skin a little 
sore. Take 1 drop internally 4 times a day. It must sometimes be continued 
a long time both externally and internally. 
PEOPLE'S HOME REMEDIES.— 

1. Iodine and Sweet Oil. — A lady writes : " I removed a goitre by apply- 
ing each night before retiring a mixture of two parts iodine and 1 part 
sweet oil. When the skin became tender I ceased application for a night or 
two then used as before. I know others who have used this remedy with 
equal success." 

2. Iodine, Carbolic Acid and Glycerine. — Put 4 ounces of the compound 
tincture of iodine into a large mouthed bottle and add % dram of pure liquid 
carbolic acid and % ounce of glycerine. Mix thoroughly and apply with a 
feather or a cloth once or twice a day as can be borne. A lady writes that 
two members of her family completely removed goitres with this remedy and 
that they never returned. This is a standard treatment recommended and 
used by many of our best physicians. 

3. Nettle Seed. — Grind 15 or 16 of the seeds of common nettle into a 
powder and take daily. This will cure a goitre and not injure the health. 

4. Alum, Borax and Salt. — Take equal parts of alum, borax and salt 
and water. Dissolve the other ingredients in the water and apply to the 
enlarged neck 3 times a day for 3 weeks. 

5. White Iodine. — As soon as noticed rub with white iodine. Don't 



DISEASES OF THE BLOOD. 141 

stop in a week or a month but wash your neck as often as you wish and put 
it on. if the neck gets sore rest for a few days and then try again. 

EXOPTHALMIC GOITRE. 
Basedow's Disease — Grave's Disease— Parry's Disease. 

Symptoms. — There is bulging of the eyeballs and palpitation of the 
heart with a very rapid pulse. There are fine treniors of the hands, arms 
and head and there is an enlarged neck. 

Treatment. — The treatment is not very satisfactory. Treat the symptoms 
and make the patient comfortable. Give good nourishing food. Operation on 
the goitre is often helpful. 

MYXEDEMA. 

Extraordinary nutritional changes take place in the body as the result 
of the absence, atrophy (wasting), removal, or inactivity of the thyroid gland. 
Peculiar swelling of the subcutaneous tissue, falling of the hair, mental fail- 
ure and feebleness of the circulation characterize it. 

Treatment. — Give 3-grain capsules of the dried thyroid gland of the sheep. 
Give these 3 or 3 times daily and gradually increase until 10 or 15 grains are 
taken daily, if possible. If the extract of the thyroid gland is used, the 
ddse is % grain 3 times daily at first. Watch for weakness of the heart. 
Continue this for some time, but under the care of a good physician, and it 
may help. 

CRETINISM. 

The causes are nearly the same as those of myxedema. 

Symptoms. — The symptoms rarely develop before the end of the second 
year. It may be noticeable when the child is 13 months old. The child is 
backward and mentally dull. The head, hands and feet may seem unduly 
large in proportion to the rest of the body. The face is stupid and heavy, the 
eyes dull, the lips coarse and the nose broad and flat. The lips are likely 
to protrude with considerable dribbling of saliva. The tongue is swollen, 
the legs are short and bent, the skin is sallow and greasy and the temperature 
is below normal. 

Treatment: — Administer thyroid extract. Begin with %, grain 3 times 
a day and gradually increase. It must be carefully given and great change 
and good will result. This thyroid extract is from the thyroid gland of the 
sheep. 

ADDISON'S DISEASE. 
Disease of Supra-Renal Glands. 
Symptoms. — There is general asthenia (weakness), the patient easily 
tires and there is a constant sense of fatigue. The patient does not get any 
good from rest and sleep. The heart sounds are lacking in tone, the pulse 
is soft, the extremities cold and the temperature below normal. There is a 
dark color or pigmentation of the skin. The skin is of a bronze color. It 
may be over the whole body but usually affects only the skin of the face and 
neck and the back surfaces of the hands and forearms. If the mucous mem- 
brane of the mouth is examined you will find the inner side of the lips are 
darkened and also the edges of the tongue, particularly below. It looks as 
though ink had been taken into the mouth. 



142 THE PEOPLE'S HOME MEDICAL BOOK. 

U! 

Treatment. — This is very unsatisfactory. Treatment simply relieves it. 
Gayebgood diet and strengthening remedies like iron and arsenic tonics. 

SCURVY. 

Scorbutus. 
Causes. — This is due to the too long continued use of the same kind of 
£l?gdi;^cj unwholesome food. Sailors on long voyages are likely to get it. 
amii^yaiPPtoms. — The gums are swollen and spongy, the teeth become 
loosened, the mouth becomes foul and there is swelling of the salivary 



no noHS^tment. — Give good and varied food with plenty of oranges or lemons 
and green vegetables. Stay in the sunshine and fresh air. Arsenic and iron 
are given as medicines. Lime juice and pepsin are good for the indigestion. 
For the mouth use chlorate of potash and myrrh as given in treating stoma- 

H^Qf IbE'S HOME REMEDIES.— 

-I'lvA Qtih Lemon Juice, Etc. — An old sailor says .that sweetened lemon juice 

taken freely will cure the worst case of scurvy. Lemon syrup and syrup of 

C^TJffaflsid are also good. Take freely of a decoction made from sarsaparilla 

and safegafras with lemon juice added. To 3 quarts of water add 2 ounces each 

©flfiejfisdaisies and dandelion roots. Boil to a quart and take a teacupful every 

nil^tiand morning. 

li brig., Sage Tea and Alum. — For the gums apply strong sage tea with a 

little alum in it.

INFLAMMATION OF THE STOMACH. ,moH ' 

Acute Gastritis — Acute Gastric Catarrh. JM 

1 E 3 A* 

Causes. — Cold and the eating of too many sweets are the causes i^ chil- 
dren. In older persons the cause is too much indigestible food or ovefjMQi&f 
the stomach. Drinking ice water or other cold drinks when perspiring, is 
another cause and it may be produced by poisons. , sg^v 

Symptoms. — There is discomfort in the stomach and the fever is bexwi^^ 
100 and 103 degrees. The bowels may be constipated or they may be a^iule 
loose. A thin white fur dotted by many tiny red spots covers the J:oi{gue. 
There is some pain and tenderness upon pressure around the stomach, ^Sick- 
ness at the stomach and vomiting may occur. ' j ' 
TREATMENT.— "' . , 

Allopathic Treatment. — Give % grain of calomel every % houp|or^8 
doses and follow in 5 hours with a seidlitz powder. After this give slgriins 
each of subnitrate of bismuth and oxalate of cerium. Give this every jjdur 
for 5 or 6 doses. For a child give 2 grains of the bismuth and 1 grairr di ffie 
oxalate of cerium. . ^^ . 

Homeopathic Treatment.— At the first when there is fever givej?^ 
second dilution of Aconite. Put 10 or 15 drops into half a glass of wa^efjj^d 
take 2 teaspoonfuls every hour to 3 hours. For the indigestion take th^thjrd 
trituration of Nux Vomica. Take 1 tablet every hour. If there isVjmm^li 
vomiting and thirst give the third trituration of Arsenicum. Take l-^.ffib%t 
every hour or two. When the tongue is coated, thick, yellow and sf^f^^^ 
you can give Mercurius Vivus, third trituration. Give one tablet ^^j^ 
three hours. This n-ay be alternated with the Arsenicum. ,g 

Nursing and Diet. — In acute gastritis the feeding is of importai^^j i,It 
is best to go as long as possible without eating a thing. The stomach..}^ ^U^p 
sore to digest food. Soups and broths which are thin and not too ric|ijj^t^ 
diluted with milk are good. Plenty of hot water is generally good, al^^,|^|d 
a mustard plaster over the region of the stomach helps. 7

ach and Bowel Difficulties. rntlw 

INDIGESTION AND DYSPEPSIA. ^^ sH 

Chronic Gastritis — Chronic Catarrh of the Stomach. '//oirD 

Symptoms. — ^There is loss of appetite, an impaired sense of taste, rialiaca 
and perhaps vomiting in the morning. The food may be vomited up oraftbe 
vomited material may be partly digested. There is belching of gas an'dtfehe 
tongue is coated. The- bowels are usually constipated and the digestionljs 
slow and impaired. 

143 



144 THE PEOPLE'S HOME MEDICAL BOOK. ' 

TREATMENT.— Attention must be paid to the <liet both as to food and 
drinks. Washing out the stomach is good. For the loss of appetite various 
simple bitters may be given. 

Allopathic Treatment. — Cinchona, quassia and cardamon may be given. 
Once or twice a day with the meals you may give y^ dram of compound tinc- 
ture of cardamon. 

Five drops of dilute hydrochloric acid combined with essence of pepsin 
may be given with each meal. 

Homeopathic Treatment. — Third trituration of Nux Vomica, the third 
trituration of Pulsatilla, the third trituration of Carbo. Veg., the twelfth trit- 
uration of Lycopodium and the second dilution of Bryonia. (For doses see 
" Homeopathic Medicines " in Nursing Department.) 

Nursing and Diet. — Eat often but small meals of easily digested foods. 
As a rule grease of every kind must be forbidden. Eat no fried foods. Eat 
slowly, chew the food well and do not eat too much. If there are water 
brashes and much gas, then starchy foods such as potatoes and the coarser 
vegetables should not be eaten. Hot bread, cakes, pancakes and pies are not 
good. Keep away from the soda fountain and do not eat sweets. Sweet 
milk and buttermilk are both good and so are broths and gruels if not too 
rich. Relieve the constipation. Taka-diastase relieves troubles arising from 
the eating of too much starchy food* Take a teaspoonful of the elixir of taka- 
diastase after each meal. 

In indigestion what you eat is of prime importance. You cannot get rid 
of indigestion if you keep putting into the stomach the food or the drink that 
causes it. Whatever food disagrees with you, stop eating. Pies are generally 
harmful as well as most cakes. Milk disagrees with some people. Skimmed 
milk iand buttermilk are good for some. Eggs should be either soft boiled 
or cooked for an hour with the shells on. If an egg is boiled for an hour it 
becomes tender and mealy. Meats are hard to digest. Potatoes are more 
healthful when baked or boiled but some cannot eat potatoes on account of 
their containing so much starch which forms gas on the stomach. Eat as little 
as possible and it will not hurt you to occasionally fast for a day.' The bowels 
must move freely at least once a day. Many cases of indigestion are helped 
by free movements of the bowels. Remember, also, that it sometimes takes 
months to cure indigestion and it may return without much provocation. It 
is best to be careful of the diet for some time after you are cured. 

Some good herb remedies for the stomach may be had by making teas 
of the following herbs. Put from 2 to 4 ounces of the herb into a pint of 
water and steep and then take 2 or 3 ounces of the tea 3 or 4 times a day. 
You can use golden seal, sweet flag, gentian, columbo, comfrey, poplar bark, 
balmony, bitter root, prickly ash bark, wild cherry bark or ginger root. 

I was doctoring a rich jolly farmer for dyspepsia. He told me : " As 
long as the medicine lasts I feel good but the stomach trouble comes back 
when I stop the medicine." I asked him, " You are careful what you eat?" 
He replied, " Oh, yes, I am very careful." I was then very busy and did not 
inquire particularly as . to what he ate but took his word as to his being 
careful. One day in the spring he came in for more medicine. We sat down 
and had a talk. I said, "You are still careful about what you eat?" "Oh 
yes," he replied, " I am careful about that." " Well tell me just what you 
eat," I said. He hesitated a moment and then said, " Why I guess I eat 
about everything that is put on the table." I found that he ate sausage and 



DISEASES OF THE STOMACH AND INTESTINES. 145 

sausage gravy, pancakes, pork and gravy, fried potatoes, fried eggs, cakes 
and mince pies as well as drinking two or three cups of coffee at a meal. 
We had a good laugh, for this was certa,inly " being careful." How can 
anyone who eats such rich foods be cured of dyspepsia! These foods were 
just the cause of his stomach trouble and to cure a disease you must first 
remove the cause. It is the doctor's duty to tell people what to do and what 
not to do if they would prevent or cure disease. It is the patient's duty to 
follow instructions and all the medicine in the world won't keep us well if we 
are continually disobeying the laws of nature. ^ 

I remember, when I was still a boy at home on the old farm, a man who 
helped us butcher. I remember him particularly on account of the quanti- 
ties of food which he ate. He was especially fond of sausage and would eat 
a piece of fresh sausage at least eighteen inches long at one meal and other 
food in about this proportion. In a few years he had a genuine case of 
dyspepsia and wondered how it was possible for him to have stomach 
trouble. I, myself, in those days, frequently went to bed after eating heartily 
of rich ijiince pie. Of course dyspepsia followed. I then knew no better but 
experience is an effective teacher. 

PEOPLE'S HOME REMEDIES.— 

(Also see Stomach and Bowel Difficulties.) 

1. Hard Boiled Eggs. — Dyspepsia may be completely cured by living 
for several weeks upon nothing but hard boiled eggs. The eggs should be 
boiled not less than 30 minutes and an hour is better. If boiled this long they 
are not tough but are soft and mealy. At first the patient should 'eat the 
whites only and later the yolks may also be eaten. Eat absolutely nothing 
^. Milk and Lime Water. — Milk and lime water is a very effective 
remedy used by physicians. Put a few lumps of unslacked lime into a pint 
can and add water until it looks like thin cream. Let the lime settle^ and 
use the clear water at the top, being careful not to use any of the settlings. 
Six or eight teaspoonfuls of lime water may be added to a glass of milk. 

3. Soda and Ginger.-^Mix some soda and ginger in the proportion of 1 
teaspoonful of soda to % teaspoonful of ginger. Keep this in a tight box 
and take % teaspoonful in a little water before eating if digestion is bad. 

Physician's Remark. — Soda is good for the gas and relieves the distress 
while the ginger is stimulating. 

4. Chicken Gizzard Skin. — Remove the inner lining of the gizzard; 
thoroughly clean and dry; then pulverize and mix with granulated sugar in 
the proportion of 1 teaspoonful of gizzard skin to l^ cup of sugar. Dose — % 
teaspoonful after meals or when needed. " This remedy was recommended 
to me about 10 years ago and I was so well satisfied with it that I always 
keep it in the house and whenever one of the family notices the first symp- 
toms of indigestion he takes a dose or two as needed." 

Remark.— This remedv comes from the family of one of the professors 
at Albion, Mich. The pepsin is the curative agent in the chicken gizzard. 

5. Hot Water.— A lady writes that after suffering for years she was 
cured of indigestion by leaving off all other treatments and drinkmg a cup- 
ful of hot water immediately before retiring at night and upon nsmg in the 
morning. 

10 



146 THE PEOPLE'S HOME MEDICAL BOOK. 

Physician's Remark. — The water aids in the cure of dyspepsia by wash- 
ing out the stomach. 

6. Pepsin. — Take pepsin and leave off coffee, tea, tobacco and whiskey, 

7. Rhubarb, Baking Soda, Etc. — Take powdered turkey rhubarb, 2 
drams; baking soda, 48 grains; simple syrup, 1 ounce; and_ mint water, % 
pint. The ^ose is a tablespoonful three times a day before meals. 

Physician's Remark. — The soda is good for the gas on the stomach and 
the rhubarb is laxative. 

GASTRIC ULCER. 

in the milder form this may exist for years without its presence being 
suspected. 

Symptoms. — There is discomfort and pain after eating with constant 
gnawing when the stomach is empty. It is sometimes relieved by food and 
afterward the pain may increase. The pain radiates ^ack to the shoulder 
blade and the spine. The stomach is sometimes very sore. Constipation is 
usually marked and the urine scanty. In bad cases there is hemorrhage or 
bleeding from the stomkch. 

TREATMENT. — Restrict the diet. Milk which has been predigested 
with peptonizing powder is good. The diet must be watched carefully for a 
long time. ^ 

When there is too much acidity mix an ounce each of baking soda, 
magnesia ponderosae and calcii carbonatii and 10 drops of ol. menth piperita. 
Take a large teaspoonful in half a glass of water when needed. 

Homeopathic Treatment. — Third trituration of Arsenicum, third tritura^

CANCER OF THE STOMACH. 

This is one of the rnost common forms of malignant growth. It is most 
often sitiiated at the lower (pyloric) end of the stomach. 

Symptoms. — Pallor is well marked and there is loss 6f weight and strength. 
Stomach distress, dyspepsia, sickness at the stomach, vomiting, gnawing pain, 
and a pallid hue, when the patient is over 40 years of age, are symptoms. 
Other symptoms such as a lump in the stomach and tenderness, soreness, 
and pain should make one suspicious of a cancer in the stomach. Vomiting 
of blood looking like coffee grounds is another symptom. When a test meal 
is given and the contents of the stomach analyzed there is found to be almost 
or a total absence of hydrochloric acid and there is an abnormal amount of 
lactic acid. The duration is variable, sometimes lasting for months and 
longer. 

Treatment. — Relieve the pain. If an operation is performed it should be 
done early. Operations sometimes prolong life comfortably for years. 

NEURALGIA OF THE STOMACH. 
Gastralgia. 
Symptoms. — The paroxysm of pain is very violent and is felt not only in 
the region of the stomach but also along the edges of the ribs. 
TREATMENT.— 

Allopathic Treatment. — It can be relieved with 1 dram of spirits of 
chloroform mixed with 1 dram of compound spirits of lavender. From ^ 
to 1 grain of menthol is also good. 



DISEASES OF THE STOMACH AND INTESTINES. Wi 

% 
Homeopathic Treatment — Take the third trituration of Atropine. Take 
2 tablets every 15 minutes for 3 doses. If the pairt is caused by gas give the 
third trituration of Carbo. Veg. The twelfth trituration of Lycopodium is 
also good. 
PEOPLE'S HOME REMEDIES.— 

1. Fomentations of Tansy, Boneset and Hops — Mustard Poultice — Es- 
sence of Ginger. — Empty the bowels with an injection of warm water. Place 
warm fomentations of tansy, boneset and hops over the stomach and follow 
with a mustard poultice. Give essence of ginger internally. 

2. Rhubarb and Baking Soda. — Take 4 ounces of tincture of rhubarb 
and 2 drams of common baking soda; mix, and give from 2 teaspoonfuls to 
a tablespoonful as often as necessary. This mixture is improved by adding a 
few drops of tincture of cayenne. 

3. Brandy, Peppermint and Ginger. — If caused by gas give hot brandy or 
strong peppermint or ginger water. 

BLEEDING FROM STOMACH. 
Hemorrhage. 

(See " Accidents and Emergencies.") Salt is good. 

VOMITING. 
Nausea — Sickness at Stomach. 

This is only a symptom of disease. , 

Causes. — Vomiting is due to a variety of causes. It may be caused by 
improper food. If it is not caused by some acute disease it may be due to 
dyspepsia, torpid liver or constipation. Pregnancy .s also a cause. 
TREATMENT.— 

Allopathic Treatment. — Make some pills of oxalate of cerium, and give 
one of these every 4 or 5 hours. This is good for vomiting during pregnancy. 
Arsenic is good to check vomiting when it is given in very small doses. 
One-tenth of a drop of ipecac is very good when there is much nausea or 
sickness of the stomach with the vomiting. Or, you can use the wine of 
ipecac in 1-drop doses every 15 minutes until relieved. In measuring the ipecac 
to get 1/10 of a drop you can put one drop into ten teaspoonfuls of water and 
then give one teaspoonful of the liquid and thus you get just 1/10 of a drop 
at a dose. 

Homeopathic Treatment. — When there is a burning, watery vomiting give 
the third trituration of Arsenicum. Give 1 tablet every 15 minutes or half 
hour until the vomiting is checked. 
PEOPLE'S HOME REMEDIES.— 

1. Peppermint, Ginger, Etc. — A tea made of peppermint, spearmmt or 
ginger will generally relieve vomiting. Brandy or tincture of ginger are 
other remedies that are much used. 

2. Mustard or Spice Poultice.— A mustard or a spice poultice applied 
to the stomach is an excellent remedy for this trouble. , 

3. Turpentine and Cayenne.— Moisten flannels with oil of turpentine 
and apply to the stomach ; or, a decoction made by adding cayenne pepper to 
spirits will do in place of the turpentine. 

4. Creosote. — Creosote may be given in one-drop doses to relieve 

vomiting. ... 

Physician's Remark.— Wood soot taken from the chimney contains creo-

f 



sote so you can make a tea by pouring boiling water on a little wood soot 
and let the patient drink of it freely. This will be found to be a good remedy. 

5. Ginger and Cloves. — Make a strong tea of cloves or of ginger and 
cloves and give the patient a little every 5 or 10 minutes. 

6. Parched Corn. — One of the very best remedies for nausea or vomit- 
ing is a tea made of parched corn. 

7. Oatmeal. — Make some oatmeal into a cake with water and brown 
it like coffee. Make a tea of this and when drank it will check vomiting. 

8. Milk and Egg. — To a pint each of fresh milk and water, which are 
sweetened to taste, add an egg which has been beaten for 20 minutes. Boil 
and drink of this when it is cold. Do not use it should it happen to curdle. 

9. Baking Soda. — " An excellent remedy for sickness at the stomach," 
writes an Illinois woman, " is to drink half a teaspoonful of baking soda 
dissolved in half a glassful of hot water." 

10. Chickweed. — Steep some chickweed and drink of it to stop vomiting. 

11. Lemon Juice and Salt. — Give the juice of a lemon and a little salt in 
hot water. One teaspoonful is a dose. 

12. Corn. — Shell some yellow field corn and brown it in a frying pan 
over the coajs until it is nearly black, then pour on hot water and, after 
standing awhile, give the water in small quantities. 

Remarks. — This is nearly the same as number six above but it is so good 
that it will bear repeating. 

13. Peach Leaves. — Put a handful of peach leaves into a quart of cold 
water and let it stand for 24 hours, then pour off the water and take a tea- 
spoonful of this peach water about 4 times a day to prevent vomiting. 

14. Fresh Air, Etc. — A lady living at Grant, Ontario says : " Go out of 
doors and get fresh air. If this fails to help, wash the hands up to the elbows 
and the face in ice cold water. I saved one of my children that way when 
doctors could not help her. She was then two years old." 

PEOPLE'S HOME REMEDIES FOR SEASICKNESS. 

1. Chloroform and Bromide of Sodium. — Take 10 or 12 drops of chloro- 
form and three times a day take 10 grains of bromide of sodium. 

2. Diet, Etc. — A person affected with seasickness should lie down in the 
open air if possible. Raw salt oysters are generally easily digested and lemons 
are generally relished by the patient. The wearing of a tight girdle to com- 
press the stomach is advised by sailors. 

DIARRHEA AND SUMMER COMPLAINTS. 

Symptoms. — These are too well known to need description. 

Treatment. — The treatment depends upon the cause. If the diarrhea is 
due to bad food give from ^/^ to 1 ounce of castor oil and with it a dessert 
spoonful of paregoric to prevent griping. This is for an adult. Or, give some 
spiced syrup of rhubarb. Give no foods until the diarrhea is checked and then 
give predigested milk, arrowroot and broths. 

In diarrhea or dysentery in either children or adults I first give either 
castor oil or aromatic or spiced syrup of rhubarb. This is how I first came 
to use the spiced syrup of rhubarb. Over twenty years ago I was attending 
a bright young man who had a severe attack of dysentery that he had taken 
while going from Detroit to Chicago on the boat. He was in a serious con- 
dition. I could check the dysentery but in a few hours it would return in 
full force. His mother suggested the rhubarb to me. I consented to its use 



DISEASES OF THE STOMACH AND INTESTINES. 149 

and then watched the result. The patient passed a great amount of a thick 
liver-colored, jelly-like mass and improvement followed. In a few days I 
advised another dose. Again he passed the same kind of material and he 
was soon well. In diarrhea and dysentery the bowels often havte irritating 
material in them that must be removed before an attempt is made to check 
the trouble. Either castor oil or rhubarb will remove this material and a 
cure is begun. Serious results sometimes follow the too sudden checking of 
these bowel troubles. It is generally a good thing to first move the bowels. 
Do you not remember how mother used to give us castor oil and laudanum or 
rhubarb alone? We doctors own much to the mothers of the land for the 
practical home remedies we have secured from them. Though in many cases 
the services of the physician are absolutely necessary yet, on the other hand, 
the practical physician will not fail to adopt any good home remedy no matter 
from what source it may come. 
PEOPLE'S HOME REMEDIES.— 

1. Hot Milk. — Drink freely of hot milk. The milk should not be boiled 
but should be heated as hot as it can be drank. 

2. Onion Poultices and Turpentine. — Apply an onion poultice to the 
bowels or s, cloth wrung out of turpentine. 

3. White Oak Bark, Blackberry Root, Etc.— Take a handful each of 
white oak bark and blackberry root and % ounce each of allspice, cloves and 
cinnamon. Make a decoction, sweeten with rock candy or loaf sugar and 
give a tablespoonful 3 times a day. 

Physician's Remark. — These are all astringents and thus check the 
diarrhea. 

4. Oatmeal Tea, Etc. — Mix some oatmeal with water, bake or brown 
it and then powder it and make a tea. If there is vomiting or sickness at the 
stomach apply a mustard plaster to the stomach. If there is griping the 
following injection should be given. Mix % pint of molasses, 1 giU of castor 
oil, 20 drops of laudanum and i/^ pint of warm water. This is for an adult. 

5. Rice. — Take half a pound of rice and pound it till iine. ,Boil it and 
eat slowly. This is good as a food in some kinds of diarrhea. 

6. Bacon and Onions. — Slice some smoked fat bacon and fry it until 
you have half a pint of grease. While it is frying slice several large onions 
into the grease and when it is done pour off the mixture. The dose is a tea- 
spoonful once a day. This remedy has cured many of tjje very worst cases of 
chronic diarrhea and should be tried. ^ 

7. Rhubarb. — Burn some pulverized rhubarb to black ashes in an iron 
dish, then powder it and give half a teaspoonful three times a day in a 
little water. 

Physician's Remark. — Rhubarb will discharge all irritating material and 
burning it makes it somewhat antiseptic. 

8. Gum Arabic. — Eating gum arable has cured many cases of chronic 
diarrhea. Drinking freely of the mucilage of gum arable is also good. 

9. Logwood. — An excellent remedy for tuberculous diarrhea is a decoc- 
tion of logwood. The dose is half a teacupful 2 or 3 times a day. 

10. Milk and Lime Water, Brandy, Etc.— In treating chronic diarrhea 
take little nourishment except milk and lime water and give a teaspoonful of 
brandy in a little sweetened water several times a day. 

11. Blackberry Cordial. — From a teaspoonful to a wineglassful of blacks 
berry cordial at a dose is excellent for diarrhea. The following is a good 



150 THE PEOPLE'S HOME MEDICAL BOOK. 

recipe for the cordial. To 2 quarts of blackberry juice and a pound of white 
sugar add half an ounce each of nutmeg, pulverized cinnamon and pulverized 
cloves. Boil together a short time and when cold add 1 pint of brandy. 

Physician's Remark. — This is slightly astringent. Before using the cor- 
dial the bowels should first be made to move freely with castor oil. 

13. Corn Meal or Parched Corn. — Brown some corn meal on the stove, 
then boil it in water like coffee and let the patient drink a teacupful 3 or 3 
times a day. Parched corn ground and a tea made in the same way will do 
as well. This is one of the finest things that can be used for summer com- 
plaints. ' 

13. Baking Soda. — A strong solution of common baking soda is an ex- 
cellent remedy for diarrhea. 

14. Mutton Tallow. — Melted sheep's tallow is fine for this trouble. Give 
2 tablespoonfuls every 2 hours. 

15. Raspberry and Dewberry Roots. — Diarrhea and summer complaints 
may often be checked by drinking tea made of raspberry or dewberry leaves 
or roots. 

16. Opium, Ginger, Peppermint, Etc. — Take a 4-ounce vial and put into 
it 2 drams of denarc®tized opium tincture (laudanum will do), 1 ounce of 
tincture of ginger and % ounce of oil of peppermint and then fill the vial up 
with simple syrup. For adults the dose is 1 teaspoonful 3 times a day. This 
is great. 

1'?. Rhubarbj Camphor, Peppermint, Etc. — Take equal parts of tint- 
ture of opium, tincture of rhubarb, capsicum, spirits of camphor and essence 
of peppermint and add a little chloroform. Take from 15 to 20 drops at a dose. 

Physician's Remarks. — This recipe comes from Cameron, Texas. The 
lady sending it says, " We have used it with the best success. The facts are 
it can't be beat." This is for adults only as it is dangerous to give opium 
to children even in small quantities. 

18. Flour and Camphor. — Stir together 1 tablespoonful of flour and I/2 
teaspoonful of camphor diluted with water. The dose is 1 tablespoonful 3 
times a day and oftener if necessary. 

Remarks. — A lady living in Centerburg, Ohio, says she has used this 
for 25 years and that it is a never failing remedy. 

19 Blackberry Root Syrup.— Take 1/2 pound of the small roots of the 
blackberry, % ounce each of allspice, cinnamon and cloves, % pound of white 
sugar, % pint of rye whiskey and 2 quarts of water. Boil the other ingredients 
down to a pint and add the spirits when cold. Dose — 1 or 2 teaspoonfuls 
according to age every 2 hours. 

Remarks. — " This is an old and tried remedy for summer complaints," 
writes one mother. 

20. " Sun Cholera Cure."— The celebrated " Sun Cholera Cure " consists 
of equal parts of tincture of opium, tincture of capsicum (red pepper), rhubarb, 
camphor and peppermint. Take from 15 to 20 drops in 4 tablespoonfuls of 
water every half hour until relieved. After the patient is relieved it should 
be used twice only every 24 hours. This is for adults. 

COLIC. 

(Also see Baby Department.) 
For Children. — Give % grain of asafetida. Or, you can make a decoc- 
tion of chamomile by putting 1 or 2 ounces of the plant into a pint of water 



DISEASES OF THE STOMACH AND INTESTINES. 151 

and boiling it down. Give in % teaspoonful doses. Peppermint water or 
peppermint oil are also good. The dose of peppermint water is from % to 
1 teaspoonful and the dose of the peppermint oil is 1 drop. 

For Adults. — Give 1 drop of tincture of colocynth in a little water every 
half hour until relieved. This is especially good where the patient is bent 
double with the colic. 

Some years ago, at three o'clock on a Sunday morning, I was called 
eight miles into the country to see a bad case of peritop'tis, so-called. The 
patient had been sick almost a week and two doctors thought the nine year 
old boy could not live. I took the case and after two weeks of hard work by 
all concerned the boy got well. Two weeks, to a day, after I had dismissed 
the case as cured, the father awoke me at midnight and told me the boy was 
again sick. I was worried for I was afraid it was another attack of periton- 
itis. I reached the home in about an hour and found him suffering with terri- 
ble pains at intervals of a few minutes but between the intervals he was free 
from pain and seemingly well. He had no fever and from the symptoms I 
decided he was suffering with neuralgia or colic in the stomach and bowels 
and, notwithstanding they told me that the boy had eaten nothing to bring 
on this attack, I gave him some quieting medicine and advised a large dose 
of castor oil and then went home disgusted at their carelessness in feeding, 
for I felt sure this was the cause of the trouble. When I returned next 
day they showed me the proceeds of the castor oil — a ball as big as a walnut. 
In the center of this ball was a raisin and around it was bread, thus forming 
a hard mass that caused the colic. Then the family remembered that the 
boy had eaten " mince pie " the previous day and that was the cause of this 
case of " Raisin and Bread Colic." 
PEOPLE'S HOME REMEDIES.— 

1. Mustard or Salt. — For flatulent or common wind colic give, as an 
emetic, either a teaspoonful of mustard or salt to a teacupful of water. This 
may be repeated in 10 or 13 minutes if necessary. 

Physician's Remark. — ^This is for colic caused by food in the stomach. 
3. Ginger. — Hot water and ginger are especially good for common or 
wind colic. 

3. Peppermint or Spearmint. — Give a little essence of peppermint or 
spearmint in hot water for colic. This is particularly good where the patient 
is sick at the stomach. 

Physician's Remark. — In its action either of these is an anodyne, anaes- 
thetic and antiseptic. 

4. Mustard Plaster, Salt and Molasses, Castor Oil, Etc. — Put a mustard 
plaster over the pain and if the bowels are constipated give an injection of 
salt and molasses, castor oil, or soap and warm water. 

Physician's Remark. — The injection removes the cause by taking the irri- 
tating matter from the bowels. The mustard causes counter-irritation. 

5. Herb Tea. — For bilious colic give at one injection a strong decoction 
made of the following herbs. Take 1 ounce of senna, 1 ounce of thoroughwort, 
10 grains of cayenne, % dram of lobelia and 1 pint of boiling water. To this 
decoction should biC added % pint of molasses and a teaspoonful of epsom 
salts. 

6. Turpentine, Etc. — Another remedy for bilious colic i$ to give an in- 
jection of 1 ounce each of spirits of turpentine, wine of ipecac and castor oil 
and Yz pint each of molasses and warm water. 



152 THE PEOPLE'S HOME MEDICAL BOOK. 

Physician's Remark. — This moves the bowels and the turpentine rids 
them of the gas. 

7. Vinegar. — Vinegar weakened with water and taken as a drink is 
a good remedy for many cases of colic. 

8. Essence of Ginger. — Essence of Jamaica ginger is excellent for pains 
in the stomach and is a fine tonic for indigestion. It gently stimulates the 
stomach and warms the whole system. The dose for an adult is a teaspoon- 
ful in a wineglassful of sweetened water. For a child under 13 years give 
half a teaspoonful. It may also be used externally. 

9. Mustard Poultice, Castor Oil, Peppermint and Ginger. — For wind 
colic bathe the feet and legs in hot water and apply hot salt or mustard poul- 
tices over the stomach and bowels. Open the bowels with castor oil and 
drink freely of peppermint or ginger tea. 

10. Laudanum, Camphor and Peppermint. — For severe cases of flatulent 
or wind colic in adults give in teaspoonful doses a mixture of equal parts of 
laudanum, tincture of camphor and essence of peppermint. Give every three 
hours for four doses if necessary, 

11. Hot Fomentations. — Apply warm fomentations of boneset, worm- 
wood, stramonium leaves or hops over the stomach and bowels for colic. 

13. Peppermint, Sugar, Etc. — Either peppermint or spearmint tea with 
a, little saleratus and sugar added will generally give relief. 

13. Salt and Water. — A mother writes that injections of salt and water 
will almost always give instant relief from colic. ' 

14. Paregoric. — For wind colic give a few drops of paregoric in one- 
third of a teaspoonful of warm water. This is the dose for a child. 

15. Rhubarb, Anise, Etc. — Take % ounce of tincture of rhubarb, % ounce 
of anise, ^ ounce of laudanum, %, ounce of magnesia, 1 quart of boiling water 
and 1 cupful of granulated sugar. Put the sugar in the boiling water, let it 
get cold and then add the other. ingredients. Keep covered tightly and in a 
cool place. The dose is % teaspoonful every half hour and this dose may 
be increased as the child grows older. 

Physician's Remarks. — I never like to give laudanum to a child for it 
is sometimes dangerous to children even in small quantities. It may be 
taken in proper doses by grown people but for children I would prefer some 
other remedy. 

16. Oil of Peppermint. — Give two drops of oil of peppermint in a cup 
of hot water without sugar. 

17. Glycerine. — Give Yz teaspoonful of glycerine. This is very good., 

18. Baking Soda. — For wind colic caused by gas in the stomach give 
half a teaspoonful of baking soda in half a glass of water. 

19. Warm Water. — Give babies plenty of warm water that has been 
boiled and always use a bottle with a nipple. 

30. Caraway Seed. — Put 1 teaspoonful of caraway seeds into half a cup 
of hot water and give a teaspoonful every half hour. There is nothing better. 
A lady writes from Chicago saying, " I am a mother of six children and have 
always found this an excellent remedy for colic." 

Physician's Remarks. — Caraway contains a volatile oil which is gooa as 
a cure for colic. Here is a combination you will find excellent Icr flatulence 
or colic. To 3 ounces of caraway tea add 1 ounce of peppermint water, 1 
dram of baking soda and 3 ounces of syrup of rhubarb. The dose is from 1 
to 3 teaspoonfuls every 3 or 4 hours. Each of these ingredients is good when 
used alone and all of them together form an excellent combination for colic. 



DISEASES OF THE STOMACH AND INTESTINES. 153 

31. Castor Oil and Paregoric. — Half a teaspoonful each of castor oil and 
paregoric, mixed, will be found good. This is for an adult. 

Physician's Remark. — Castor oil rids the bowels of irritating material 
and paregoric relieves the pain. 

22. Ginger Tea, Etc. — Put hot flannel cloths on the stomach and a bottle 
of hot water to the feet and give either ginger or anise tea. 

23. Peppermint and Castor Oil. — If there is constipation with the colic 
give an injection of an ounce of warm peppermint tea with a teaspoonful of 
castor oil in it. Spearmint tea will do in place of peppermint. 

24. Salt Water. — Put a teaspoonful of salt into a pint of water and have 
the patient drink it and then go to bed. This is a very quick and effective 
remedy. 

25. Bread. — Break a hot loaf of bread in two pieces and place the halves 
opposite each other ; one upon the bowels and one upon the back. " This 
treatment will relieve any kind of colic," writes a mother from Texas. 

26. Soot Tea. — One mother writes that she has never found anything to 
cure the colic so quickly as soot tea. Pour hot water upon a little soot from 
the chimney and have the child drink it. It seems to absorb all the gas. 

27. Calamus. — Give from 20 grains to 1 dram of calamus. For infants, 
you can combine it with calcined magnesia. 

28. Pills for Colic. — The following pills are good for flatulent colic. 
Each pill should contain 1 grain each of dioscorein and asclepidin and 3 
grains of ginger. Instead of the asclepidin you can use the same quantity 
of unicorn root if preferred. Give one pill every 2 or 3 hours. 

29. Chamomile. — For colic in adults use oil of chamomile. The doSe 
is from 5 to 15 drops on sugar. • 

30. Wild Yam.^-In ordinary cases of colic give from 3 to 4 ounces of .a 
decoction of wild yam root every half hour until relieved. In bilious colic 
the dose is half a pint every half hour. 

31. Catnip Tea. — Warm catnip tea is one of the old fashioned remedies 
our grandmothers used to give the children for colic and it is just as good 
today as it was then. Put an ounce of the dried herb into a pint of boiling 
water, cover and let stand for an hour. Drink of it freely.

bark and 2 drams each of common salt, powdered lobelia seed and powdered 
capsicum. This is to be used as an injection. Give half this quantity at a 
time as hot as possible and repeat if necessary in 15 miriutes. A decoction 
of wild yam may be drank at the same time. 

33. Pink Blows, Etc. — To 2 ounces each of common pink blows, smell- 
age root and pleurisy root add a sufficient quantity of boiling water and boil 
down to a quart ; strain and add a quart of proof brandy and a pound of sugar 
The dose for an infant is a teaspoonful and may be repeated if necessary. 
This is good for colic, fits and green stools in children. 

DYSENTERY. 

This disease is treated under Contagious and Infectious Diseases. 

CONSTIPATION. 
Causes. —People of a nervous and bilious temperarnent and of a dark type 
are much troubled with constipation. A sedentary life conduces to consti- 



154 THE PEOPLE'S HOME MEDICAL BOOK. 

pation. A lazy life in which the calls of nature are irregularly attended to 
or are habitually neglected leads to over distention of the rectum or paralysis 
of it. This is a common cause of constipation. 

Another cause is the constant use of concentrated articles of food such 
as meats in which little residual matter is left to stimulate the worm-like 
motion of the bowels. A very coarse diet may also tend toward constipation 
because there is so much residual matter left that it stops up the bo^vels or 
causes fecal impaction. 

A change of drinking water or water from a chalky region may aid in 
causing constipation. Other causes are bodily weakness and diseases such as 
neurasthenia, hysteria, acute fevers and liver disorders. The habitual use 
of purgatives may also weaken the bowels and cause constipation. 

The local causes are: (a) Atony or weakness of the muscles of the ab- 
domen caused by fat or in females often by being pregnant, (b) Atony or 
weakness of the large bowel from chronic inflammation, (c) Pressure by 
tumors, (d) A narrowing of the intestihe either from external or internal con- 
striction or pressure, (e) Tightness of the sphincter ani or muscle of the 
anus. 
TREATMENT.— 

Remove the causes if possible. There should be a regular time for 
the movement of the bowels each day. This will help a great deal. Habit has 
much to do with constipation, especially when one is not born with it. Make 
the bowels move at a certain time each day and remain at stool withouj 
straining until they do. Exercise is good and especially such exercises as act 
upon the muscles of the abdomen. Horseback riding and gymnasium work 
are good. Massaging the bowels is very efifective. Special attention, though, 
to the calls of nature should be esteemed a duty and proper time and heed 
must always be given to the complete emptying of the bowel. Take time 
and have a regular hour each day. Young girls should be specially instructed 
for they are very likely to neglect the call of nature. 

Attention to the diet often avails much. Foods that are easily digested 
but leave a moderate amount of residual matter .after digestion are to be 
recommended. Such foods as bread made from unbolted flour, plenty of 
vegetables and fruits, butter and such loosening articles as figs, honey and 
molasses and a glass of cold water taken regularly at bed time and in the 
morning on arising, are all good. Bread should be well baked. The old style 
stone mill flour is the best. Graham flour and corn meal made in different 
ways are both good. Eat fruits of all kinds and especially apples. Do not 
drink strong tea or coffee as they are binding as are also meats and especially 
beef. Avoid rich cakes and pies. Eat good healthful food and do not over eat. 
Oatmeal and corn and wheat flakes are of great benefit. The less you work 
or exercise, the less you should eat and especially of hearty and substantia) 
foods. Milk is constipating for some people. Eat slowly and thoroughly 
chew your food; it will then digest better and you will not need to eat so 
much. Get up from the table a little hungry. 

As before stated, you ought to have a regular time for your bowels to 
move. Go to the closet every day at a certain time and if necessary wait 
and determine that you will have a movement. Habit has a great deal to do 
with constipation. Do not. strain at stool. 

If the anus or outlet is too small have it stretched or dilated but have 
this done gradually. In drug stores you will find dilator* for this purpose in 



DISEASES OF THE STOMACH AND INTESTINES. ISS 

sets of three or four. These are not only good for constipation but also for 
piles and dyspepsia as well as nervous trouble. 

When at stool do not sit down and read and put ofif attending to the 
call of nature. Make attention to this call your first duty after breakfast. 

There are laxatives and cathartics and tablets and pills of many kinds. 
Of course if you can't have regular passages without these you must resort 
to their use. It is better to take " physics " than to have constipated bowels 
with all the troubles that go with constipation. Sometimes, eating dandelion 
root will prove beneficial. Senna tea, in from 1 to 5-ounce doses, is also good 
but it causes griping. Dandelion, yellow dock, burdock, culver's root and 
wahoo, made into a tea and drank freely, is good. You can also use this com- 
bination in the fluid extract form. These fluid extracts can be bought at 
any drug store and should be mixed in equal parts. The dose of the combi- 
nation is from % to 1 teaspoonful from 2 to 4 times a day as needed. This 
will be found very good and it is not especially harmful. 

Aromatic cascara, fluid extract of cascara and cascara evacuans are all 
good as are rochelle and epsom salts. Seidlitz powders and Hunyadi and 
other waters give temporary relief. 

Spiced syrup of rhubarb is very good for infants and children in from 
% to 1 teaspoonful doses. The aromatic syrup of rhubarb is very good where 
there is irritating material in the bowels causing diarrhea. This is good for 
both infants and adults. 

The compound infusion of senna is good. The dose is from 1 to 3% 
ounces ever}' 4 hours until it operates. Sulphur and molasses, mixed, is a 
good laxative at times. Much benefit will be derived from regular massaging 
of the abdomen. 

Remember that by constant care in diet and habits you can overcome 
many cases of constipation. Never allow one day to pass without a good 
passage from the bowels. Injections, or enemas, are good as a temporary 
measure but they are likely to irritate the bowel. If you feel dizzy, irritable, 
cross and lazy, and your bowels have not moved recently, you should cause 
a movement by giving an enema or by using some of the other means 
mentioned. Do not take anything to act upon your liver or bowels when 
they are acting well simply because it is a certain season of the year. If 
your bowels are regular and you think your liver is torpid, drink lots of good 
water and eat very little or nothing for a day or two. Most of us eat too 
much. Many of our ailments are caused by over eating and among these 
aliments are sluggish kidneys, torpid liver and bowels, dizziness, neuralgias 
and headaches. Eat less food and drink more water. 

In closing this subject I want to give a prescription gotten up and fre- 
quently prescribed by myself. 

For Constipation. — Take 1/4 grain of aloin, ^4 grain of nux vomica, % 
grain of podophyllin and 3 grains or more of powdered gentian ;_ mix » thor- 
oughly. This quantity will make one capsule or it can be rolled into a pill. 
Of course you are to have as many made as is deemed necessary. One of 
these pills or capsules may be taken every night if necessary. This is not a 
cathartic but a light tonic-laxative and I know it is excellent where a tonic- 
laxative is needed. 
PEOPLE'S HOME REMEDIES.— 

1. Castile Soap and Rhubarb. — Make some pills of castile soap and 
rhubarb, using half a grain of each. Take two pills before retiring. 



156 THE PEOPLE'S HOME MEDICAL BOOK. 

Physician's Remark. — The rhubarb is laxative and the soap is oily and 
slightly laxative also. 

2. Diet, Etc. — If you are constipated drink freely of cold water and also 
use warm water as an injection. Eat fruits, vegetables and soups. Cracked 
wheat is a fine remedy. Attend regularly and promptly to the calls of nature. 

3. Senna and Boneset. — An occasional dose of senna tea is good for 
constipation, also an injection of boneset tea with a little molasses is effective. 

4. Charcoal and Molasses. — Mix charcoal with a little molasses and 
take from a teaspoonful to a tablespoonful as often as required to produce the 
desired effects. At the same time it will be well to bathe the bowels occa- 
sionally with vinegar to which a little pepper has been added. 

Physician's Remark. — The molasses is loosening and the charcoal is an 
antiseptic. 

5. Hot Water. — Hot water drank freely half an hour before bed time 
is soothing to the bowels and one of the very best laxatives in cases of consti- 
pation. 

6. Baking Soda. — A very little baking soda will often give relief. 

7. Figs. — For constipation in children give them a fig each morning. 

8. Bean Biscuit for Constipation. — Take 1 pint of beans, % pint of 
flour, 4 teaspoonfuls of molasses or srfgar, sour milk with soda to sweeten, 
and a piece of butter the size of an egg. Make quite a thick batter and bake 
in gem pans. Eat two biscuits at each meal until relieved. 

Physician's Remark. — These biscuits leave a large residuum and the butter 
and molasses are loosening. 

9. Olive Oil. — This is also good for gall stones. 

10. Lemon Juice and Sugar. — Squeeze the juice from half a lemon and 
add about 3 tablespoonfuls of water and a teaspoonful of sugar and drink 
before breakfast every morning for a week or ten days. This is very good. 

11. Figs and Dates. — Eat figs and dates. 
13. Dandelion. — Eat dandelion greens. 

13. Rhubarb. — Eat plenty of rhubarb. 

14. Senna Tea. — Use a tea made of senna. The dose is from 3 to 4 
ounces. By adding 1 teaspoonful of cream of tartar to a teacupful of the in- 
fu'sion, you will take away the unpleasant taste. It is not to be used when 
there is inflammation of the intestines, piles or falling of the bowels. 

15. Wahoo. — The bark of the root of wahoo is good for a torpid liver and 
for constipation. The dose of the tincture is 1 dram and of the powder from 
20 to 30 grains. This is also good in combination with blood remedies. 

16. Flaxseed. — A decoction of flaxseed is good as an injection. 

17. Confection of Senna. — Confection of Senna is a splendid mild laxa- 
tive for constipation. It can be bought at any drug store but here is the 
formula for those desiring to make it themselves. Take 8 ounces of senna, 4 
ounces of coriander seeds, 3 ounces of licorice root (bruised), 1 pound of figs, 
% pound of pulp of prunes, % pound of pulp of tamarinds, % pound of pulp 
of cassia, 3% pounds of refined sugar and 4 pints of water. Give one to two 
teaspoonfuls at night. 

18. Cathartic Pills.^-Take 6 ounces of mandrake root, 4 ounces of cul- 
ver's root or black root, 4 ounces of blood root, 8 ounces of blue flag, 4 ounces 
of lobelia seeds and Yz ounce of cayenne pepper. These should be finely 
pulverized, sifted and mixed well. To form into pills make a thick mucilage 
of gum arabic, peach tree gum or slippery elm bark by dissolving in either 



DISEASES OF THE STOMACH AND INTESTINES. 157 

water or molasses and moisten the powders just enough to make them adhere. 
Form in pills the size of a pea and roll them in fine slippery elm, bayberry or 
flour. Lay them in a dry place exposed to the air to dry and put into boxes 
with fine elm powder. Take from 3 to 6 at bed time. 

CfiOLERA INFANTUM. 

(See Baby Department for Physician's Treatment of this Disease.) 
PEOPLES' HOME REMEDIES.— 

1. Spiced Syrup of Rhubarb, Etc. — For the severe vomiting of cholera 
infantum apply a mustard poultice to the stomach and spinal column; or, a 
spice plaster laid over the stomach often gives relief. For the diarrhea give 
a teaspoonful of the spiced syrup of rhubarb every half hour until it acts on 
the bowels, then it may be given every 3 or 4 hours. In a day or two this 
should be followed with a tea made of the bark of blackberry root, cherry tree 
bark and strawberry root and some of the leaves of each added. To this add 
a little cinnamon and cloves and sweeten with white sugar. The child should 
have plenty of fresh air even if it has to be carried in the yard, street, or 
park. If it is too sick to be taken out of doors it may be carried on a large 
pillow in a well ventilated room. 

Physician's Remarks. — These remedies are slightly astringent ; the cloyes 
are a stimulant and antiseptic and the cinnamon contains tannin which is 
astringent. The volatile oil of the cloves makes it a hemostatic which means 
that it is good to stop bleeding. The mustard or spice plaster is a counter- 
irritant. 

2. Whites of Eggs, Etc. — Beat the whites of two eggs thoroughly, mix 
with water and add a little sugar and a teaspoonful of orange flower water. 
Give a teaspoonful every hour. It seems to form a coating for the bowels. 

3. Rhubarb, Baking Soda, White Sugar and Peppermint. — Into a tea- 
cup put half a teaspoonful of baking soda, a teaspoonful of powdered rhubarb 
and two tablespoonfuls of white sugar. Mix these and add % teaspoonful 
of essence of peppermint and stir while pouring the cup two-thirds full of 
boiling water. Let this settle and from the top give a child a year old half a 
teaspoonful every hour. 

Physician's Remark. — The soda corrects the stomach, the rhubarb is a 
slight laxative and gets rid of the irritating material in the bowels and the 
peppermint is an anodynei, anaesthetic and antiseptic. 

4. Castor Oil and Blackberry Cordial. — Give half a teaspoonful of castor 
oil and 12 drops or more of blackberry cordial every hour for 4 hours. " This 
has been used with success many times when other remedies seemed to do 
no good," writes a mother living at Garrettsville, Ohio. 

Physician's Remarks. — Castor oil drives all the irritating material from 
the bowels and when this is all removed you should stop its use. A good 
way to make the blackberry cordial is to take equal parts of cinnamon, cloves 
and nutmeg and pour enough dilute alcohol over them to make a tincture. 
Take 31 parts of this tincture and add 3 parts of fresh blackberry juice and 
3 parts of simple syrup. Mix, and take a dram or more at a dose according 
to age. 

5. Cinnamon Bark. — Fr^equently give small doses of a strong tea made 
from cinnamon bark. Giving castor oil regularly every day is also a good 
remedy. 

Physician's Remark. — The castor oil casts out the irritating material 
and the cinnamon tea checks the looseness of the bowels. 



158 THE PEOPLE'S HOME MEDICAL BOOK. 

6. Flour and Milk. — Put some white flour into a cloth bag, boil for 
three hours and when cool take off the outer part or skin and scrape fine. 
Mix this with boiled milk until it is of the consistency of cream and let the 
child drink of this. 

CHOLERA MORBUS. 
Sporadic Cholera — Cholera Nostras. 

Description. — This is a self limiting disease characterized by vomiting 
and purging, colicky pains, and often muscular cramps. 

Causes. — Age and season have much to do with it. It usually occurs in 
the summer time. Warm, damp and sultry weather and improper food such 
as unripe fruit, cucumbers and egg plant are common causes. 

Symptoms. — It comes on suddenly with pain in the abdomen (belly), 
vomiting and diarrhea. It is often attended with cramps in the calves of the 
legs. 
TREATMENT.— 

Place a large mustard plaster or poultice over the stomach and abdomen 
and follow with flaxseed poultices if necessary. 

If there has been indigestion or if the patient has been eating indigestible 
food, give laxatives. A good treatment is to drink lots of water to wash the 
food and mucus from the stomach. This will cause more vomiting for the 
time being but the vomiting will stop as soon as the food and mucus are 
washed from the stomach. For the excesssive thirst give in the mouth small 
pieces of ice over which a little brandy has been sprinkled. 

Allopathic Treatment. — After giving the laxatives or washing out the 
stom.ach as above give 15 drops of essence of wintergreen mixed with an 
equal quantity of laudanum. Give this in a little water. Sometimes a few 
drops of camphor mixed in a little water and dropped on the tongue will 
stop the vomiting. Give a hypodermic injection of i/4 grain of morphine. 

Homeopathic Treatment. — Give the second dilution of Veratrum Alb. 
Put 10 or 15 drops into half a glass of water and give from % to 1 teaspoonful 
every 15 minutes. 

It is always well to keep quiet the next day for the stomach and bowels 
will be sore and you might cause inflammation of these parts if you move 
much. If very sore you can use fomentations of hops, etc. 
PEOPLE'S HOME REMEDIES.— 

1. Spice Poultice. — A spice poultice made of a teaspoonful each of 
cinnamon and cloves and a tablespoonful of flour wet with brandy may be 
applied to the stomach. Wash the stomach out by giving freely of warm 
water and flaxseed tea. 

2. Salt, Pepper, Vinegar, Etc. — Take 1 tablespoonful each of table salt 
and ground black pepper and Vs teacupful each of warm water and cider 
vinegar. Of this take a tablespoonful every few minutes until the whole is 
taken. Stir each time before using. This mixture will stop the purging and 
settle the stomach. 

3. Cloves, Cinnamon, Blackberry Root, Etc. — Apply warm fomentations 
of hops and vinegar to the bowels and bathe the feet in warm saleratus water. 
After the severest part of the attack is over give two or three times a day a 
teacupful of a strong decoction of cloves, cinnamon and blackberry root. A 
strong decoction of burnt corn is also an excellent remedy. 



DISEASES OF THE STOMACH AND INTESTINES. 159 

4. The Celebrated " Sun Cholera Cure," — This consists of equal parts, 
mixed, of tincture of opium, tincture of capsicum (red pepper), rhubarb, 
camphor and peppermint. Take from 15 to SO drops in four tablespoonfuls of 
water every half hour until relieved. This dose, when used twice only every 
34 hours, is excellent for summer complaint. 

Physician's Remark. — Because of the opium this should bp given to adults 
only. 

5. Mustard Plaster, Etc. — Keep the patient warm and the feet wrapped 
in warm blankets. Use hot water bottles to the feet and limbs and put a 
mustard plaster over the stomach. Internally use the following tried remedy.

tumblerful each of hot water and cider vinegar ; mix, and give a tablespoonful 
every few minutes until the whole has been taken. 

6. Poppies, Chamomile Flowers, Etc. — Make a decoction of poppies and 
chamomile flowers. Wring flannels out of the hot liquid and apply over the 
stomach. At the same time the following mixture may be given: 1 dram of 
magnesia and 4 ounces of peppermint water. If there is much diarrhea and 
the case has run for some time add two drams of paregoric to the above. 
Shake the mixture thoroughly before taking. The dose is a teaspoonful every 
20 minutes. 

7. Rum, Molasses and Ginger. — Take a glassful each of West India 
rum, molasses and spring water; add 3 tablespoonfuls of ginger; mix, and 
drink. This is a sure cure for cholera morbus. 

Physician's Remarks. — The rum is stimulating, the molasses is a little 
loosening and the ginger stimulates the stomach and bowels. 

8. Asafetida and Whiskey. — Put some asafetida gum into whiskey and 
let stand for some time. Shake well and give a small dose of the liquid and 
it will often give instant relief. It is also good for wind colic in small children. 

9. Cayenne Pepper, Camphor, Etc. — Take equal parts of cayenne pepper, 
tincture of opium, tincture of rhubarb, essence of peppermint and spirits of 
camphor; mix well. The dose is from 15 to 30 drops in sweetened water 
according to age and the violence of the symptoms. Repeat every 15 or 30 
minutes until relieved. 

Physician's Remark. — This is good for adults. Because of the opium it is 
better not to give it to children. 

PEOPLE'S HOME REMEDIES FOR STOMACH AND BOWEL 

TROUBLES. 

1. Milk and Lime Water. — Give a little lime water in milk. This is

a good food for the patient with stomach or bowel trouble. 

14. Teinnin, Golden Seal, Etc. — For falling of the bowel, any good pile 
ointment with a dram of tannin added will be found beneficial. As an injection 
use a strong decoction of white oak bark or a decoction of equal parts of

18. Treatment. — When there is gas in the stomach (chronic) causing 
colic, etc., refrain from drinking tea, coffee or any other drink while eating 
and for 21/2 hours afterward. If constipated use some cathartic and perhaps a 
tonic may also be needed under the advice of a physician, but the refraining

INFLAMMATION OF THE GULLET, 

This is usually caused by poison. Dilate the stricture with instruments 

SPASM OF GULLET. 

This is rarely met with except in insane or hysterical persons. 

INFLAMMATION OF THE SMALL INTESTINES. 
Catarrhal Enteritis. 

Symptoms. — There is pain and griping in the bowels, diarrhea and loss of 
appetite. 
TREATMENT.— 

Rest in bed and after the bowels have been moved freely with castor oil 
give bismuth in from 5 to 10-grain doses. 

The first time I ever saw the " Corn Sweat " used was in the cas^ of a 
married lady about forty years of age who was suffering from inflammation 
of the bowels. The patient did not get along as wpll as she might and her 
husband asked me if I would object to the use of the " Corn Sweat." He 
explained the method as I have described it in the Nursing Department. The 
husband had learned this from his mother who was one of the old pioneers of 
Michigan and a woman of vast experience with herb remeflies and home aids. 

I at once saw the possibilities of this " Corn Sweat " and consented to 
its use. The result was a great benefit to the patient about whom I was so 
worried. The explanation is very simple. The sweating opened the pores 
of the skin thoroughly so that it could perform its functions and throw off the 
poison from the system. The capillary or skin circulation was fully restored, 
thereby taking some of the blood from the bowels and relieving the congestion 
of these organs. I understand that Dr. Nancrede, Prof, of Surgery, in the 
University of Michigan recommends this " Corn Sweat " when sweating is 
needed. 
PEOPLE'S HOME REMEDIES.— 

1. Lye Water, Mustard Poultices, Etc. — For inflammation of the bowels 
put the feet into warm lye water which is not very strong and apply mustard 
poultices to the abdomen, along the backbone and to the feet. After consider- 



DISEASES OF THE STOMACH AND INTESTINES. 163 

able redness has been produced remove the poultices and apply hot fomenta- 
tions of hops and stramonium leaves or hops and tansy. Change them accord- 
ing to the pain. 

2. Hot Water Cloths. — Apply cloths wrung out of hot water to the 
affected parts. 

3. Cold Water Cloths. — Wring cloths out of very cold water, place on the 
affected parts, cover with a dry towel and change often. 

4. Lard and Turpentine. — Warm and mix well four parts of lard with 

1 part of turpentine and grease the patient thoroughly over the bowels ; then 
cover the bowels with a warm woolen cloth. A lady living in Rockford, Ohio 
says that she saved a child with this treatment that had been given up to die. 

5. Bran, Meal or Flaxseed Poultices. — Apply poultices of bran or meal, 
changing as often as they cool. Flaxseed is also good. A dose of castor oil 
should be given if the bowels are not loose enough. 

INFLAMMATION OF THE ILEUM-COLON. 
Ileo-Colitis of Childhood. 

Symptoms. — This manifests itself by purging, vomiting and abdominal 
distress. In the mild form there is a slight fever from 1 to 2 degrees 
above normal. Daily there are several loose movements of the bowels. If 
the case is more severe there is pain in the bowels, vomiting, high fever and 
frequent passages of yellow or greenish stools containing mucus and undi- 
gested food. There may be straining and the stools may be streaked with 
blood. The tongue is coated, the bowels tender to the touch and the child 
rapidly loses strength as it does with cholera infantum. 

The disease is far more dangerous for childrert under 4 years than v/hen 
they are older. High fever, many stools, much vomiting, much mucus, 
marked nervous symptoms and signs of poisoned blood are all bad symptoms. 
TREATMENT.— 

Herb Remedies. — Cranesbill steeped in milk is very good for diarrhea 
and dysentery. Oil of fireweed is good for dysentery. The dose is 5 drops 
for adulls and should be given from 1 to 3 times every hour. A tea made of 
path weed is also fine for dysentery. Use from 3 to 4 ounces to a pint of 
water and give from 1 to 3 ounces every 3 or 3 hours. 

Allopathic Treatment. — If there are evidences of an inactive liver give 
very small doses of calomel every third or fourth day. If there is much 
mucus in the stools give from 1 to 3 teaspoonful doses of castor oil. 

Homeopathic Treatment — During the first 24 hours give the second 
dilution of Aconite. Put 10 or 15 drops into half a glass of water and give 

2 teaspoonfuls every 2 or 3 hours. 

Give 1 tablet of the third dilution of Arsenicum every hour. This is to 
be used when the patient is tliirsty, restless and vomits water or watery fluid 
and when there is a watery, burning diarrhea that makes the anus sore. 

Give the third trituration of Mercurius Sol. Give 1 tablet every hour 
or two. This is to be used when the patient is bilious looking and passes 
mucus and blood and has pain at stool which is not relieved by passing of 
the stool. 

Use the third trituration of Nux Vomica, 1 tablet every hour or two, 
when there is much pain before the stool but is relieved by the passage of 
the stool. 

When there is a throbbing headache give the third dilution of Bella-

fuls every 1 to 3 hours.

spice poultice over the abdomen is very good. The spice poultice consists of 
equal parts of powdered nutmeg, allspice, cloves and cinnamon. These are to 
be moistened with warm water or vinegar. A mustard plaster is also good. 
Use one or two parts of mustard to 3 or 3 parts of wheat flour. This produces 
continuous but not severe counter irritation. 

For a diet the patient may have milk if it does not curdle. Beef juice 
or beef or chicken broth may be given but not to a very young infant. If the 
child is older you can add strained barley or wheat gruel. The digestion of 
these can be aided by the use of liquid pancreatin or liquid taka-diastase. 

APPENDICITIS. 

Description and Location of Appendix. — The appendix is a small tube a 
little larger than a goose quill and from 3 to 4 inches long. It is situated 
in the right side of the abdomen and rather low down. It can be located about 
midway between the navel and the point of the hip bone. One end is closed 
and the other opens into the caecum or beginning of the large bowel. In- 
flammation of the appendix is called appendicitis. 

SYMPTOMS. — ^The most constant symptom is pain in the right side of 
the abdomen. The patient may not be able to locate the pain exactly but pres- 
sure with the hand will usually show the right location. The pain is usually 
severe and sharp and in some cases is agonizing. Usually it comes on ' 
suddenly and for this and other reasons it may be confused with kidney or 
gall stone colic. If the pain of appendicitis stops suddenly it is not a good 
sign for it indicates the formation of pus in or near the appendix. 

Next to the pain the most important symptom in appendicitis is a tight- 
ness or hardness of the muscle on the right side of the abdomen. The fever 
is very high and there is often vomiting. After a time a swelling may appear 
in the lower side of the abdomen. 

How to Tell Appendicitis from Renal and Gall Stone Colic. — In renal 
or kidney colic the pain runs down into the scrotum or groin. In hepatic or 
gall stone colic the patient has generally had previous trouble with gall stones. 
TREATMENT.— 

Preventive Treatment. — Keep the bowels open. 

Allopathic Treatment. — Absolute rest in bed. Apply an ice bag over the 
appendix. Give no food or drink by the mouth, give no purgatives and no 
morphine unless absolutely necessary. Use a bed pan if the bowels move 
for the patient must not get out of bed. If the pulse is excitable a little 
aconite may be given. 

Homeopathic Treatment. — Absolute rest in bed. The medicines used are 
the second dilution of Aconite, the third dilution of Belladonna, the second 
dilution of Bryonia, the third trituration of Arsenicum and the third tritura- 
tion of Mercurius. Directions for the preparation and doses of these medi- 
cines will be found under " Homeopathic Medicines " in the Nursing Depart- 
ment. 

Operations. — Great difference of opinion exists as to this (See article on 
Operations). Dennis says, "The plan of allowing the simple catarrhal cases 
which are doing well after 36 hours to recover without immediate operation 
and relegating them subsequently to the group known as interval cases, and 



DISEASES OF THE STOMACH AND INTESTINES.. 165 

the prompt operation after 36 hours when the cases are not doing well, seems 
to hold out the best prospect of recovery. The pendulum has swung too far 
toward indiscriminate operation. But now the introduction of the interval 
operationhas brought the pendulum back to swing within the proper limits. 
Nursing and Diet. — As a rule the patient would vomit any food taken 
the first few days. Liquid food can be given with a syringe and injected into 
the bowel. When food can be taken it must be liquid like milk, broths, etc. 
See that the patient remains quiet and use the bed pan as he must not get up 
for any reason. 

TELESCOPING OF THE BOWELS. 
Intestinal Obstruction — Intussusception. 

Description. — Intussusception is a telescoping of one section of the bowel 
into_ another. A section of the bowel seems to slip back into the adjoining 
section and thus closes it and prevents the passing of the contents of the 
bowels. 

Causes. — Obstruction of the bowels is caused by the packing of the con- 
tents of the bowels, by adhesions, or by tumors. 

Symptoms. — There is pain in the abdomen, vomiting in the first stages 
and absolute constipation. The pain soon becomes constant and agonizing 
and the vomiting is more severe and constant after several hours. The first 
material vomited is gastric and mucus ; the next material contains bile and 
then there is vomiting of the contents of the bowels. This is probably due to 
the putrid decomposition of the stagnated contents of the bowels above the 
obstruction. 

Treatment. — Stop all food and wash out the stomach every six hours 
by giving large quantities of water. Give high rectal injections with a foun- 
tain syringe. Use a warm saline solution of olive oil and the injection should 
be copious, steady and regularly repeated. An operation will be necessary if 
other means fail. 

ACUTE PERITONITIS. 
Inflammation of the Peritoneum. 

Description. — The peritoneum is a membrane lining the walls of the 
abdomen and covering or enclosing the intestines. Peritonitis is inflammation 
of the peritoneum. 

Causes. — Most cases are due to infection. The two great causes are 
appendicitis and disease of the fallopian tubes. 

Symptoms. — There is severe pain in the abdomen and the wall of muscles 
of the abdomen is rigid and sensitive to touch. The patient has a very 
anxious face. The pulse is rapid and there is frequently vomiting. The abdo- 
men soon becomes extremely tender and the patient cannot bear the weight of 
the bed clothes upon him. He usually lies upon his back with his knees drawn 
up and supports the bed clothes over the abdomen with his hands. He is 
afraid lest the bed be jarred. The thirst is fearful. As the disease progresses 
the abdomen becomes full and hard. The face is anxious, pinched and peaked ; 
the eyes sunken ; the nostrils thin and drawn ; the skin livid and pale and the 
tongue dry and parched. The patient breaks into a cold sweat and has 
watery diarrhea. As the end approaches the pulse is exceedingly wiry. In 
septic cases the pain is absent in the majority pi cases. It runs a rapid 
course. As a rule in well developed cases the patient does not live long. 



166 THE PEOPLE'S HOME MEDICAL BOOK. 

TREATMENT.— 

Allopathic Treatment — Find the cause and treat accordingly. Hypo- 
dermic injections of morphine may be necessary to relieve the pain but enough 
morphine should not be given to mask the symptoms. An operation may be 
resorted to in some cases. Apply a counter irritant over the abdomen. In 
some cases leeches are used and in others a light mustard plaster. The thirst 
is relieved by small pieces of ice; or, better still, by rinsing the mouth with 
glycerine, 1 part; and vjrater, to which has been added a few drops of lemon 
juice, 3 parts. Liquids increase the vomiting. Fomentations are good in 
some cases. Keep the kidneys working well. 

Homeopathic Treatment. — The second dilution of Aconite is used in the 
first stages and the second dilution of Bryonia is used afterward. When the 
patient is very thirsty, restless, vomits, and has a watery burning diarrhea, 
the third trituration of Arsenicum is used. When there is miich sticky and 
bad smelling sweat and painful diarrhea, then the third trituration of Mer- 
curius is the medicine to use. 

DROPSY OF THE ABDOMEN. 
Ascites. 

Description. — This is a serous or watery fluid in the abdomen. 

Causes.— The causes are diseases of the liver (cirrhosis), tuberculous 
peritonitis, growths of the ovaries and malignant growths obstructing the 
circulation. v 

Symptoms. — There is first an enlargement of the lower part of the ab- 
domen and the sides. 

Treatment. — If it is due to cirrhosis of the liver little can be done for it. 
Tapping may be resorted to. If it is caused by heart disease treat with 
rest, digitalis, and saline purges. If caused by a tumor of the ovary or other 
malignant growth an operation should be performed early. 

FALLEN BOWEL. 
Prolapsus Ani. 

Description. — This is when a part of the bowel hangs out. 
TREATMENT. 

Manual Treatment. — Place the patient on his side, oil the tumor well, 
and then press it back gently with a soft towel. If this fails, cover the 
finger and introduce it gently within the bowel, gently pressing the tumor up. 

General Treatment. — Remove the cause if possible. Give iron tonics 
and cod liver oil. This will regulate the bowels. Stools should be passed 
with the child lying on its side and when the bowels come out, push them 
gently back and keep them in place with a bandage. Keep the buttocks to- 
gether with a strong strip of adhesive plaster, in children. 

FISSURE. 

Causes. — This is an ulceration of the anus which is sometimes caused 
by piles and by constipation. 

Symptoms. — The pain after evacuating the bowels continues for several 
hours instead of for a short time as in piles. 

Treatment. — Open the bowels daily with a mild laxative like castor oil. 
Afterwards wash the parts with soap and water and apply the following 
ointment. Take 4 grains of calomel, 2 grains of powdered opium, 2 grains of 



DISEASES OF THE STOMACH AND INTESTINES. 167 

extract of belladonna and 1 dram of simple ointment. Mix these thoroughly, 
spread the ointment on a piece of lint and put on the fissure. Also, you can 
touch the ulcer and fissure with a sharp pointed stick of nitrate of silver once 
a day or once every other day. 

ISCHIO-RECTAL ABSCESS. 

This causes severe pain. It is felt on one side of the anus, or opening of 
the lower bowel, as a hard brawny mass, having, as it softens, a red surface. 
It may burst externally or it may burst into the bowel. 

Treatment. — Apply a poultice and open the abscess. Introduce the finger 
or curette and scrape it out. Afterwards wash it out thoroughly with some 
antiseptic solution and stuff it full with gauze and keep washing it out and 
packing with gauze until it is thoroughly healed. Early and free opening 
will prevent a fistula in the bowel. 

FISTULA OF THE BOWEL. 

Usually this has one opening in the bowel (rectum) and one in the skin 
as the result of the abscess. The more severe forms are outside the sphincter, 
the inner opening being from % to l^/a inches from the edge of the anus. 
Operation is the treatment jf it bothers much, but it is surprising how many 
of them do not bother much. Keep the bowels open with mild laxatives. 

TUMORS OF THE RECTUM. 

Cancer is generally of the epithelial form. The only treatment is opera- 
tion. Sometimes there are warty growths and they may be of large size. 
They may not bother but if they do they should be taken off. 

EXTERNAL PILES. 

These are situated about the anus and outside the bowel. 

Causes. — They are due to a varicose or congested condition of the veins 
near the surface and about the anus. They are bluish, soft, round lumps out- 
side the anus. Sometimes they are large, full and inflamed and when the 
bowels move they cause great pain. They generally subside in a few days. 

Treatment. — Overcome the constipation with senna and sulphur, com- 
pound licorice powder, cascara, etc. For the pain use equal parts of chloro- 
form and sweet oil. Apply with a cloth. (See " People's Home Remedies for 
Piles.") 

INTERNAL OR BLEEDING PILES. 

Description. — These are situated within the bowel and are more serious 
and troublesome than the external ones. 

Symptoms. — There is constant bleeding from the rectum and this bleeding 
is increased by movements of the bowels. Sometimes the piles protrude and 
drag the bowel with them, thus causing falling of. the bowel. Sometimes 
when they protrude they are held by the sphincter muscle and do not go back 
and then they cause great pain. They may then slough and produce a natural 
cure. This is quite painful. 

Treatment. — Overcome the constipation but do not cause diarrhea. Use 
compound licorice powder, pills, or an enema if the patient can stand it. 
Wash and grease the protruding piles after a bowel movement and then care- 
fully return them. 

Sometimes an operation is necessary. Suppositories are good. Pine- 



168 THE PEOPLE'S HOME MEDICAL BOOK. 

oline salve put on the pile internally and externally is good. Chopped raisins 
and tobacco mixed with lard is also a good remedy. Touch internal piles 
with tincture of iodine. 

Take the inner bark of white oak, boil in water until it is quite strong, 
mix with vaseline, and apply to the piles both externally and internally. (See 
" People's Home Remedies for Piles.") 

ITCHING PILES. 

Causes and Symptoms. — The itching may be caused by pin worms, small 
external piles or eczema. In some cases it is a nerve trouble and there is 
no local inflammation to be made out, the skin about the anus having a dead, 
white, parchment-like look. These cases are difficult to cure. The irritation 
is worse at night and the itching is almost unbearable. 
TREATMENT.— 

Get rid of the causes such as thread worms, etc. If the part is too moist, 
use soothing applications such as a solution of lead. If the parts are too dry, 
use oil of cadi. Keep' the buttocks apart and this may be done with a pledget 
of fine oakum. 

Eqtial parts of pineoline and Webb's ointment is also good for some cases. ' 
Another good remedy is a mixture of % ounce of unguentum hydrargyri 
ammoniat, 2 drams diachylon, 1 dram anthrasol, 6 grains carbolic acid and 
1 dram of unguent aqua rosse. 

For neurotic cases, or those caused by nervous trouble, keep the bowels 
regular, stop liquors and tobacco and live^plainly. Fine oakum may be applied» 
with citrine ointment, oleate of mercury, or carbolized vaseline. (See "Peo- 
ple's Home Remedies for Piles.") 

HEMORRHOIDS. 

For painful piles use the following prescription. Take % dram of 
extract of opium, 5 to 8 grains of cocaine hydrochlorate, 15 grains of menthol, 
and 1 ounce of ungt. zinc oxide. Mix and apply to the piles occasionally. 
This is also good for fissure and eczema. (See " People's Home Remedies 
for Piles.") 

PEOPLE'S HOME REMEDIES FOR PILES. 

1. Horse Chestnuts and Lard. — Remove the shells from 6 horse chest- 
nuts, or buckeyes; chop them fine, add enottgh lard to just cover the 
nuts ; and let them stand for an hour near the fire. Strain, and when cool 
apply the lard or ointment to the parts twice a day. This is a very valuable 
remedy for piles. 

2. Butter, Turpentine and Salt. — Make an ointment by taking 1 table- 
spoonful of fresh butter and 2 teaspoonfuls of turpentine, adding a little salt. 
Several times a day apply this ointment either outside or inside the rectum. 
This is a very fine remedy for piles and is well worth trying. 

3. Tar and Lard. — Wash the parts twice a day with castile soap and 
water and apply an ointment made of two tablespoonfuls of tar and eight 
rounded teaspoonfuls of lard. 

4. Alum and Lard. — Make an ointment of 1% ounces of lard and a 
dram of finely powdered alum. This is a very fine pile remedy. 

5. Tannic Acid, Carbolic Acid, Borax and Vaseline. — Apply the fol- 
lowing ointment to the bowel twice a day. Take tannic acid, 15 grains; 
carbolic acid, 30 drops ; pulverized borax, 10 grains and vaseline, 3 ounces. 



DISEASES OF THE STOMACH AND INTESTINES. 169 

Apply to the parts two or three times daily and take cream of tartar or some 
other mild laxative. 

6. Indian Pile Ointment. — Take, say a teacupful of hog's lard, more 
or less; put into a flat tin or dish and take two bars of lead, flattened a little, 
and rub the lard with the flat ends and between them until it becomes black 
or of a dark lead color. Then burn equal parts of cavendish tobacco and old 
shoe leather, in an iron vessel, to a charred powder and mix into the lard 
until it becomes a thick ointment. Use once or twice a day as an ointment 
for the piles. It is a never failing cure. 

7. Sulphur and Lard. — For blind or bleeding piles apply an ointment 
made by taking 1 dram of sulphur and 2 ounces of lard. Rub this mixture 
between two flat pieces of lead until the ointment is blackened. 

8. Tobacco. — Tobacco ointment is a great pile remedy. 

9. Raisins, Tobacco and Lard. — Equal parts of chopped raisins, tobacco 
and lard makes one of the best remedies known for piles. 

10. Witch Hazel, Apple Tree Bark, White Oak Bark and Lard.— Make 
a decoction of witch hazel, apple tree bark, and white oak bark, and mix 
with lard to make a salve. This is very good for piles. 

11. Solomon's Seal. — Bruise some Solomon's seal root and apply to the 
piles. 

13. Cranesbill. — Make a strong decoction of cranesbill and use as an 
injection. It should be retained in the bowel for some time. 

13. Cream of Tartar, Sulphur, Etc. — Take 1 ounce each of cream of tartar 
and sulphur and 3 ounces of confection of senna. Add enough syrup of 
ginger to ma;ke a paste. Of this take a piece the size of a small hickory nut 
often enough to cause a natural movement of the bowels once a day. Apply 
cold cream, tallow or lard locally to relieve the irritation. 

14. Cold Water and Witch Hazel. — It is sometimes beneficial to wash 
with cold water or take cool sitting baths. If there is much bleeding give 
injections of cold water or witch hazel. 

15. Poultice. — If there is much inflammation apply a poultice made of 
sulphur, stramonium leaves and slippery elm bark. 

16. Cream of Tartar and Molasses. — A teaspoonful of cream of tartar 
taken in a little molasses is an excellent remedy. It keeps the bowels regular. 

17. Sulphur and Cream of Tartar. — Take sulphur and cream of tartar in 
equal parts. A teaspoonful once a day is very effective. While using this 
remedy it is also well for the patient to drink a tea made of mullein and elder. 

18. Hops, Tansy, Poke Leaves, Etc.— In blind piles a cure is often 
effected by sitting over a hot decoction of hops, tansy, poke leaves or other 
bitter herbs until the parts are well steamed. A poultice of equal parts of 
lobelia leaves and elm bark is also good as is also a poultice of poke leaves. 

19. Witch Hazel.— Take a teaspoonful of witch hazel every 3 or 4 hours 
and at the same time bathe the external parts freely with the same remedy. 
This is very effectual in many cases. 



DISEASES OF THE LIVER. 

Including Disease of the Bile Passages, Gall Bladder and Pancreas. 

Description and Location of Liver. — The liver is situated high up on the 
right side and its lower border corresponds to the lower edge of the ribs 
on the right side. It is of a dark red color. It measures 6 or 7 inches from 
front to back and about 13 inches from side to side and is about 4^/^ inches 
thick in the thickest part. It is divided into two lobes, the right lobe being 
much the larger. The liver weighs between 3 and 4 pounds and is the largest 
gland in the body. 

Description and Location of Gall Bladder. — The gall bladder is on the 
right side. It is a pear shaped sac about an inch in breadth, four inches long, 
and holding a little more than an ounce. It is a storage place for the bile. 
The ducts or tubes leading from it join those leading from the liver and 
enter the bowel about 3i^ inches below the stomach. 

Description and Location of Pancreas. — The pancreas lies behind and 
below the stomach and belongs to the digestive system. It furnishes pan» 
creatin which aids in digestion. The pancreas is 6 or 8 inches long, about 
1^4 inches wide and weighs between 3 and 6 ounces. 

INFLAMMATION OF THE LIVER. 
Liver Abscess. 

Causes. — This may be due to injuries such as knife wounds, etc. ; to 
dysentery; or to inflammation of the portal vein or bile ducts. Tropical ab- 
scess is a disease found in India. 

Ssrmptoms. — There is enlarged liver, fever, and pain. The dyspeptic 
symptoms are marked. The fever runs high and the patient is yellow and 
generally sweats. 

TREATMENT. — Keep up the strength with good foods and with iron- 
and arsenic and if it is a single abscess it should be opened and drained. 
PEOPLE'S HOME REMEDIES.— 

1. Warm Bath and Hot Drinks. — For mild cases of inflammation of 
the liver have the patient take a warm bath, go to bed and take warm drinks 
until he perspires freely. 

2. Dandelion. — Take extract of dandelion in 5-grain doses 4 times a 
day. It can be made into pill form and is an excellent tonic for the liver. 

Physician's Remark. — Dandelion is an alterative and also a laxative. 

3. Buttermilk. — Liver complaint may be remedied by drinking a cup- 
ful of buttermilk every day. 

4. Decoction of Dandelion. — Make a strong decoction of dandelion and 
take a teaspoonful twice a day. Dandelion is one of the best liver remedies 
known and is much used by physicians. 

5. Salt Water and Lard. — If the complaint is attended with a costive 
condition of thfe bowels give an injection of 1 pint of warm water, 1 table- 
spoonful of salt and 1 teaspoonful of hog's lard. 

170 



DISEASES OF THE LIVER. 171 

Physician's Remark. — This relieves the congestion of the liver by remov- 
ing the constipation. 

CIRRHOSIS OF THE LIVER. 

Description. — This consists of an overgrowth of connective tissue in th6 
liver. Sometimes it finally shrinks and in other cases it becomes enlarged. 
This tissue presses upon the liver tissue and interferes with the proper action 
of the liver. 

Causes. — The shrinking kind is caused by chronic alcoholism and lead 
poisoning. 

Symptoms — There is stomach trouble and dropsy. 

Treatment. — If it is caused by alcohol the patient should quit drinking 
alcoholic liquors. Each morning the bowels should be moved with Hunyadi 
or Carlsbad water and a few drops of Fowler's solution should be taken for 
the nausea and lack of appetite. During meals the patient should take the 
following. With each meal take 2 grains each of pancreatin, taka-diastase, 
and baking soda. Tapping is the best thing for the dropsy. 

ENLARGEMENT AND HARDENING OF THE LIVER. 
Hypertrophic Cirrhosis. 
Symptoms. — The liver is enlarged and frequently extends below the 
navel. Jaundice is generally present. 
Treatment. — ^There is no cure for it. 

CIRRHOSIS OR HARDENING OF THE CAPSULE. 

This capsule is the connective tissue surrounding the artery, vein and 
duct, of the liver. The disease is very rare. It frequently results from other 
diseases. 

AMYLOID LIVER. 

This is caused by a starch-like deposit in the liver. It generally comes 
from other diseases. 

TUMORS OF THE LIVER. 
Cancer of the Liver. 
Cancers of the liver are very rare and generally come from cancers of 
other parts. They are fatal. 

ACUTE YELLOW ATROPHY OF THE LIVER. 

Description. — In this disease there is fatty degeneration of the liver and 
the patient has violent headache and delirium. Atrophy means " dwindling." 
The disease is very rare. 

Causes. — The cause is not known. The disease is more frequent in 
women than in men. 

Symptoms. — There is jaundice, severe headache, vomiting and finally 
delirium, muscular tremors, convulsions, and death. Death is nearly always 
the result. I know of one case where the disease followed an operation in 
another part of the body. 

JAUNDICE. 
Catarrh or Inflammation of the Bile Ducts. 

Inflammation sometimes entirely closes the bile ducts and then we have 
jaundice. 



173 THE PEOPLE'S HOME MEDICAL BOOK. 

Causes. — ^The disease nearly always arises from inflammation of the 
duodenum, or first part of the intestine ; from cold ; heavy eatingf and drink- 
ing.; or, froni a malignant growth. Gall stones, fright, anger and pneumonia 
are other causes. 

Symptoms. — These vary greatly. They are well marked in some persons 
and in others so slight that they are not noticed. Sometimes the patient is 
wretchedly ill, has headache, and is Very weak. The stools are like putty and 
the urine like porter. The pulse and respiration are remarkably slow and the 
temperature may be below normal or it may be up to 103 degrees or more. 
In older persons and particularly if the jaundice develops slowly there is a 
possibility of a malignant growth being present. If there is a distinct en- 
largement of the gall bladder it is probably cancer. In other cases, when 
jaundice comes on suddenly, the cause may be gall stones and in such cases 
the patient has generally been previously troubled with gall stone colic. 
TREATMENT.— 

Allopathic Treatment. — Keep the kidneys acting freely by giving largely 
of vichy water and 5 grains of carbonate of potash may be added if necessary. 
For constipation give from 30 grains to a dram of sodium phosphate in half 
a glass of water every hour or two until the bowels are thoroughly moved. 

Homeopathic Treatment — Give the third trituration of Mercurius Sol. 
Take a tablet every 1 to 3 hours. Tincture of Myrica Cerifera (bayberry) 
is also a splendid remedy. Give 8 drops every 3 or 3 hours. 

A few years ago I had a case of jaundice that did not yield to the , 
regular treatment. I was in the hospital at the time and spoke of the case 
to Dr. Hinsdale, Dean of the Department, to whom I was then an assistant. 
He advised me to use the tincture of Myrica Cerifera in 1 to 3-drop doses 
every few hours. I tried the remedy and the patient was helped immediately. 
Dr. Hinsdale had found this remedy useful in his previous practice though it 
is not mentioned in the books for this trouble. The tincture of Myrica Cerifera 
is made from the bark of bayberry. If desired a. tea may be made of this 
bark and used in the place of the tincture. 

Nursing and Diet. — The patient should have rest. Apply hot water 
cloths over the liver and renew as rapidly as they cool. Keep the kidneys 
in good working order. Avoid all fat foods and rich milk is not very good. 
Eat nutritious broths, thickened with barley or rice, with a little salt added. 
These should be partly digested with pancreatin. 
PEOPLE'S HOME REMEDIES.— 

1. Thoroughwort Tea and Baking Soda. — ^In case of jaundice, drink 
freely every day of thoroughwort tea. Baking soda taken before meals is 
also a good remedy. 

3. Barberry and Cider. — A valuable remedy for jaundice is the inner 
bark of barberry steeped in cider. 

3 Wild Cherry Bark, Sheep Laurel Leaves, Etc. — Take 1 ounce of 
coarse powder of wild cherry bark, sheep laurel leaves, barberry bark, and 
bitter root; put into 3 quarts of pure cider; mix, and let stand for several 
hours. Give a teaspoonful 3 or 4 times a day. 

Physician's Remark. — ^The wild cherry assists in digestion, the laurel and 
barberry are alteratives and act upon the liver, and the bitter root is a cathar- 
tic and diuretic, 

4. Peach Leaves. — Make a strong tea of peach leaves and drink half 
a pint daily. 



DISEASES OF THE^ LIVER. 173 

5. Wild Cherry and Peach Tree Bark.— With gin make some bitters 
of wild cherry bark and the bark of the root of the peach tree and drink freely 
several times a day. 

CHRONIC JAUNDICE. 

Causes. — This is commonly due to obstruction in the ducts by gall stones, 
growths, or stricture. 

Symptoms. — The patient has fever, sweats, and persistent jaundice. 
TREATMENT.— 

_ Remove the cause if possible and relieve the constipation. Apply tincture 
of iodine over the liver. This must be kept up for a long time. Fever indi- 
cates pus. An operation may be necessary to remove the obstruction. Milk 
and fatty foods are hard for a patient with this disease to digest. 

SUPPURATION OF THE BILE DUCTS. 

Symptoms. — There is fever, jaundice and an enlarged and very tender 
liver. The patient sweats profusely and loses flesh rapidly because of the 
pus. There is not much severe pain. 

Treatment. — An operation is necessary to let the pus out. 

ACUTE INFLAMMATION OF THE GALL BLADDER. 
Acute Cholecystitis. 

Cause. — Gall stones. 

S3miptoms. — The symptoms vary in severity from a slight discomfort 
and soreness to violent and alarming pain and collapse. There is tenderness 
on the right side about the region of the gall bladder. The pain is felt under 
the ribs. Fever is often ushered in by a chill. When it develops suddenly, 
as it frequently does, the patient may be seized with, sickness at the stomach 
and vomiting. There is threatened collapse and a rapid pulse. The abdomen 
is distended and its walls tight and hard. Gall stones may be mistaken for 
appendicitis. When the patient has gall stone colic he has generally been 
troubled with gall stones before. 

Treatment. — An operation will probably be required; or, if temporary 
measures are used, the patient should rest in bed and there should be counter- 
irritation over the region of the gall bladder. Give salts. Morphine is not 
often used but it may be necessary for the terrible pain. 

GALL STONES— CHOLELITHIASIS. 

This is when there are gall stones in the gall bladder or bile passages. 

Symptoms. — Many never know they have this disease. It is commonly 
met with after the 40th year and more than three-fourths of the cases occur 
in women. Only about five per cent, suffer from distinct symptoms due to 
this cause. Symptoms of biliary colic usually consist of severe pain which 
amounts to agony in some cases. Occasionally the pains are very moderate. 
The patient vomits and sweats profusely and often after an attack a slight 
jaundice may appear. As a rule the attacks last but a few hours. 

Treatment. — Give a hypodermic injection of % grain of morphine with 
1/130 of a grain of atropine. If the first injection does not give relief it may 
be repeated without the atropine in 15 or 20 minutes. Use olive oil regularly 
in large doses for a long time. 
PEOPLE'S HOME REMEDIES FOR GALL STONES.— 

1, Bark of Sweet Apple Tree. — Perhaps the best remedy known for 



174 THE, PEOPLE*S HOME MEDlCAL SOOlt. 

gall stones is made from the bark of the root of the sweet apple tree. The 
bark should be taken early in the spring or late in the fall when there is no 
sap rising in the tree. Put half a pound of the bark into a large bottle con- 
taining a pint of alcohol and let it stand for two or three weeks, occasionally 
shaking it so that all the strength is drawn out. Of this take a teaspoonful 
3 or 4 times a day in a little sweetened water. 

2. Olive Oil. — ^Take large doses of olive oil. Continue until cured. 

3. Dover's Powder. — Give full doses of Dover's powder to relieve the 
spasm caused by gall stones. 

MALIGNANT GROWTHS IN GALL BLADDER. 

There are sometimes malignant growths in the gall bladder as there are 
in other organs. It will not be necessary to treat of them. 

JAUNDICE OF NEW BORN INFANT. 
Icterus Neonatorum. 
This usually appears the third or fourth day. 

Homeopathic Treatment. — Give the third trituration of Mercurius. Give 
1 tablet every three hours. 

INFLAMMATION OF THE PANCREAS. 
Pancreatitis. 
This disease is hard to diagnose. The acute disease is a very serious 
thing. Malignant growths also occur in the pancreas. 

BILIOUSNESS. 
Congestion of the Liver. 

Symptoms. — There is some headache, a yellow coated tongue, a bitter 
taste in the mouth, and the whites of the eyes may be ot a yellowish color. 
There may be sickness at the stomach, vomiting and constipation. The liver 
may be slightly swollen and a little tender to the touch. 
TREATMENT.— 

Preventive Treatment — ^To keep off biliousness mix 15 grains of extract 
chiratse, 4 grains podophyllin, 8 grains euonymin and 8 grains leptandrin; 
make into 20 pills and take one at night. 

Herb Remedies. — A tea made of golden seal is good for a torpid liver. 
Also a tea made of culver's root is good for the same thing. Use the dried root 
in making the tea and take a teaspoonful every two hours. 

Take equal parts of blue flag root, mandrake, and prickly ash bark. 
Grind all together and give 5 to 10 grains every 3 or 3 hours. Do not take 
enough to physic. 

Allopathic Treatment — If the stools are light, give 1/6 grain of calomel 
in powder every 15 minutes until 6 doses have been taken. Follow in 4 
hours with salts. Give podophyllin if the stools are dark. The dose is 1/6 of 
a grain. If the attack is sudden give salts so as to sweep out poisonous food, 
etc. If the face is flushed apply a mustard plaster to the nape of the neck. 

Or, you may give phosphate of sodium in from 30 to 60 grain doses every 
hour or two until the bowels move freely. 

Homeopathic Treatment. — You can alternate the third trituration of 
Nux Vomica and the third trituration of Mercurius every hour for one day. 



DISEASES OF THE LIVER. 175 

This often cures without moving the bowels. Use an enema if you do not 
wish to take medicine to move the bowels. 

Nursing and Diet. — When one is bilious the best plan is to go a day, 
if possible, without eating anything. Drink plenty of water either hot or cold. 
You will not feel like eating. Biliousness is frequently caused by over eating 
or eating or drinking improper things. Stimulating foods and drinks some- 
times produce it. The bowels should move freely and when one has a torpid 
liver attention must be given to the bowels. One can not feel well when the 
bowels are constipated and especially if they have generally been regular. 
PEOPLE'S HOME REMEDIES.— 

1. Fasting. — You will avoid biliousness by fasting two or three meals 
whenever the taste is bad or the tongue coated. This treatment would 
save many doctor bills. 

Physician's Remark. — This allows the stomach and liver to rest and thus 
the congestion is relieved. This is very good advice. 

2. Lemon Juice- — Drink lemon juice in a glass of water once or twice 
a day. Do not sweeten. 

3. Hot Water and Lemons. — Drink a cup of hot water before breakfast 
every morning and eat lemons frequently. 

Physician's Remark. — The hot water washes out the stomach. 

4. Tomatoes. — For some people plenty of tomatoes either raw or canned 
are good. 

5. Licorice. — Take a teaspoonful of licorice powder in a little cold 
water before going to bed. 

Physician's Remark. — Licorice is laxative and regulates the bowels of 
constipated people and in this way it is good for biliousness. 

6. Lemon Peel, Cream of "Tartar, Loaf Sugar, Etc. — For bilious fever 
sponge the patient two or three times daily with either warm or cold water 
as he desires and give the following drink. Take 3 ounces of bruised lemon 
peel, 1/4 ounce of cream of tartar, 2 ounces of loaf sugar, and 1% pints of 
boiling water. Vomiting may be stopped with equal parts of milk and lime 
water. 

Physician's Remark. — Lemon acts upon the liver and cream of tartar on 
the bowels and kidneys. 

7. Diet. — A plain diet of bread, milk, oatmeal, vegetables and fruit 
with lean meat and fresh fish, is best. Exercise in the open air. The victim 
of an acute attack will be righted by — first, abstinence; second, porridge 
and milk; third, toast, a little meat, fish and ripe fruit; thus coming to 
solid food gradually. 

Physician's Remark. — This is good advice to follow as to diet. 



DISEASES OF THE KIDNEYS AND BLADDER. 



DROPSY. 

Edema. 

This was once thought to be a disease but it is only a symptom of 
many diseases of the kidneys, of other organs and of the circulation. It may 
be either general or local. General dropsy is called " anasarca." When there 
is liquid in the abdominal cavity it is called " ascites ;" in the chest, " hydro- 
thorax ;" and in the brain cavity, " hydro-cephalus." 

Treatment. — When it comes from disease of the heart you must treat 
that organ. An infusion of digitalis is then generally good. Ascites, or liquid 
in the abdomen, may be due to diseases of the ovaries, liver, malignant 
growth, etc. The malignant growth should be removed if possible. Dropsy 
may be due to the kidneys, scarlet fever and heart disease. So the disease 
instead of the dropsy must be treated. 

PEOPLE'S HOME REMEDIES.— 

1. Broom Tea and Cream of Tartar. — Pour a pint of boiling water on 
a handful of the common herb called broom. The green tops of the broom 
should be used and the whole should be placed near the fire for several hours. 
Give a teaspoonful of cream of tartar to keep the bowels open. 

Physician's Remark. — The broom increases the flow of urine and does 
good in this way. 

3. Milk Weed, Horseradish, Elder Bark, Etc. — Here is an excellent pre- 
scription which was taken from an old medical work and it will be found very 
effective in dropsy of the chest. Take 1 ounce each of milk weed root, horse- 
radish, mandrake root, black elder bark, juniper berries, root or bark of the 
dwarf elder, and bark from the root of bitter sweet. Add y^ ounce of mustard ; 
press all together and pour on 1 gallon of hard cider. Take a wineglassful 
on an empty stom.ach three times a day. 

Physician's Remarks. — This is quite an active diuretic (acts on the kid- 
neys) and causes an increased flow of urine. Some of the ingredients also 
act on the liver and bowels. 

3. Parsley Root. — A tea made of fresh parsley root is often used to 
advantage for dropsy of the abdomen. 

Physician's Remarks. — This is slightly laxative but it does the work by 
its greater action on the kidneys. 

4. Mustard Seed, Juniper Berries, Ginger, Etc. — Take half an ounce each 
of mustard seed, bruised juniper berries and ginger and an ounce each of 
parsley root and horseradish. Steep in a quart of old cider and take a wine- 
glassful 3 times a day. 

5. Corn Silk, Dandelion, Etc. — ^The following is good in dropsy of the 
lower extremities from heart disease. Fluid extract of corn silk, 1% ounces ; 
fluid extract of dandelion, 3 ounces ; infusion of digitalis, 3 ounces ; mix, and 
take 2 teaspoonfuls in water every 3 to 4 hours. 

6. Corn Silk, Cream of Tartar and Sweet Spirits of Nitre. — This pre- 
scription is for dropsy of the lower extremities caused by heart disease. Tak^ 

J76 



DISEASES OF THE KIDNEYS AND BLADDER. 177 

3 ounces of fluid extract of com silk, 3 drams of cream of tartar, '4, ounces of 
Bweet spirits of nitre ; mix, and take 2 teaspoonfuls every 3 to 3 hours. 

7. Dandelion Tea. — ^Wash and cut up a large double handful of dande- 
lion roots and let them stand for a couple of hours in boiling water. During 
the day the patient should take 3 or 3 cupfuls of the decoction. 

CONGESTION OF THE KIDNEYS. 
Acute Hyperemieu 
Causes. — It is caused by medicines like cant^harides, turpentine, copaiba, 
cubebs, anaesthetics and especially ether. Injuries to the back and the chill- 
ing of the skin also cause it. 

Symptoms. — There is a tired feeling, pain in the back and a slight fever. 
The urine is scanty, dark in color, and of a high specific gravity. The patient 
generally improves before long. 

TREATMENT.— 

Allopathic Treatment. — Absolute rest in bed. Give 2 teaspoonfuls of 
solution of acetate of potash with 1 teaspoonful of sweet spirits of nitre at 
each dose. Give every two hours. 

Homeopathic Treatment — Give the second dilution of Aconite at the 
beginning. Put 10 or 15 drops into a glass half full of water and give 1 or 3 
teaspoonfuls every 1 to 3 hours. 

Common Remedies. — Poland water, watermelon seed tea, pumpkin seed 
tea and flaxseed tea are all good. 

CHRONIC CONGESTION OF THE KIDNEYS. 

This frequently comes with diseases of the heart, lungs, and liver and 
sometimes follpws the acute form and is usually more common. 

Symptoms! — Albumin found in the urine is a prominent symptom. The 
amount of urine passed may be scanty. 

TREATMENT.— Treat the conditions that cause it. The patient should 
have absolute rest in bed. Apply hot compresses over the kidneys. Cupping 
is another treatmefit. 

Cupping. — Cupping is either wet or dry. Dry cupping can be done with 
a small tumbler or a wine glass. Moisten the inside with a little alcohol or 
whiskey, light this, and at once apply, holding it firmly over the part. As the 
air in the glass cools it will " suck " owing to the contraction of the air. This 
draws blood to the parts. Remove the glass by tilting it while pressing the 
skin down on one side. For wet cupping the skin should first be congested 
with dry cupping, then parallel incisions, or cuts, should be made in the skin 
with a lancet point and at once the cup should be applied as before. When 
the cup has ceased to fill with blood, remove it and empty it and apply again" 
until enough blood has been drawn. Then wash the parts with some mijd 
antiseptic solution and cover with dry clean cloths. 

Allopathic Treatment. — Give the fluid extract of apocynum cannabinum 
in from 5 to 10-drop doses two or three times a day. 

Homeopathic Treatment. — Give the third trituration of Apis Mel. when 
there is scanty and Straw colored urine. 

Give the third trituration of Arsenicum if there is much thirst and rest- 

lcSStl6SS 

Give the third trituration of Terebinth if bloody urine is passed.

178 THE PEOPLE'S HOME MEDICAL BOOK. 

ACUTE BRIGHT'S DISEASE. 
Acute Nephritis — Inflammation of the KJidneys; — Diffuse Inflammation. 

Causes. — Exposure to wet and cold, extensive burns, scarlet fever, diph- 
theria, pneumonia, pregnancy, and arsenic and corrosive sublimate poisoning. 

Sj^m'ptoms.^ — Chills, and frequently convulsions, mark the onset. , The 
fever is from 101 to 103 degrees. Dropsy may soon he a prominent feature. 
The urine contains albumin. The face is puffed and the ankles are swollen, 
especially when it comes from scarlet fever and, perhaps, from pregnancy. 
The result is usually favorable but is worse in young children. 

Treatment. — The patient should rest and take salts for the bowels. He 
should drink milk and lots of water if there is no dropsy. He should live upon 
a liquid diet with no spices like pepper or mustard iU the food. Avoid the 
cold and damp, and sweat the patient if necessary. Place him on a chair in 
a warm room with a blanket pinned about the neck and hanging to the floor 
on all sides. Put a hot brick in a pail, of water underneath the patient. Or, 
you can admit steam from a kettle under a raised cover at the foot of the bed. 
Do not burn the patient. If the patient is not too weak you can use the corn 
sweat as described in the Nursing Department. 

CHRONIC BRIGHT'S DISEASE. 
Chronic Nephritis. 

Description. — ^There are two kinds of this disease. In the parenchymatous 
kind' there is inflammation of the kidney surface proper and the kidney is 
enlarged. In the interstitial kind the connective tissue of the kidney is. in- 
flamed and the kidney is contracted. 

S3miptoms of First Kind. — It may follow the acute Bright's disease and 
the symptoms abate a little. There is anemia, drops}^ and albumin in the urine 
and these persist and gradually become more marked. Yet it may come on 
stealthily with headache and stomach and bowel disturbance. There is less 
urine and it is of a darker color. It has a heavy sediment and contains al- 
bumin and casts. There are eye troubles and more or less dropsy. The face 
fs pallid, the skin of a greasy yellow color, and the breathing difficult. The 
parts pit on pressure, the heart acts bad, the pulse is rapid, and the patient is 
sleepy during the day and restless at night. The urine is scanty and its 
specific gravity high or about 1025. 

Symptoms of the Second Kind. — This is found in busy men who say they 
are all right. The symptoms show late. The urine is increased in quantity 
and the amount of albumin is not great. There is frequently dimness or dis- 
turbance^of sight but not so much general dropsy as in the first kind. Acute 
attacks of uremia and heart palpitation are not infrequent.' Finally there is 
more albumin and the heart is weak. Thte specific gravity of the urine is low ; 
1005 to 1013. 

TREATMENT.— The treatment is largely hygienic. 

Diet. — Drink skimmed milk but not too much. Unskimmed milk is the 
best if it can be taken. Drugs are of little value. Build up your patient with 
proper food and care. Watch the stomach and bowels. Use very little beef. 
Vegetables, starchy and fresh soups, boiled or broiled fish, raw oysters, clams, 
chicken, fat bacon, cereals, stewed and raw fruits and weak tea and coffee 
are good- 



DISEASES Of "titE KIDNEYS. AND BLADDER. It9 

General Treatment for all ICinds of Bright's Disease. 

Diagnosis. — There is albumin in the urine with casts of the urine-bearing; 
tubules. The blood vessels are somewhat thickened. There is a greater 
second sound of the heart in association with the symptoms mentioned. 

Bright's disease is a very serioiis disease but not necessarily .'atal. The 
treatment of the conditions depends upon the variety of Bright's disease which 
has caused them and the peculiarities of the person suffering from the attack. 
When uremia comes on in acute Bright's disease from scarlet fever, put hot 
compresses across the small of the back and if there is no diarrhea give enough 
epsom salts to produce several watery passages from the bowels. 

After this has been accomplished give 5 to 10 grains of citrate of potassium 
dissolved in Poland water, 3 or 4 times daily. If this does not stop the bad 
symptoms place the patient in a pack. TheiX are two forms of this. If it 
comes, say from scarlet fever, and the rash has partly disappeared, the skin 
is hot and dry and the fever high, it is well to wrap the patient in a sheet 
wrung out of water at 70 or 80 degrees and then immediately surround him 
with a blanket. 

If no fever is present and the rash has faded, or if it is not advisable to 
use cold first, the hot pack may be given, the patient being quickly wrapped 
up in a blanket which has been wrung out of water as hot as the skin can bear. 
Place outside of this a dry blanket and on the head an ice bag or cold applica- 
tions to prevent congestion of the brain. Give a few sips pi cold water every 
few moments to drive the blood from the inner organs to the skin circula- 
tion so as to cause sweating. The same treatment is to be Used in chronic 
Bright's disease if these bad symptoms are present. Give drugs to meet 
the indications. 

• If the uremia is from the second form of Bright's disease (contracted 
kidney) the same measures may be used. Glonin is especially good for high 
arteriar tension. Give 1/200 of a grain. If the heart is strong give a hypo- 
dermic injection of % grain of pilocarpin. Produce sweating. Watch the 
lUijigs and heart. In a mild case of Bright's disease the patient does not know 
he has kidney disease. He refers all his bad feelings to his stomach and 
bowels and sometimes to his heart and, unfortunately, some doctors fail to 
recognize the true condition. The person suffers from what he thinks is in- 
digestion. If a person is sick for some time with what he thinks is stomach, 
bowel or heart trouble he should have his urine examined and it will fre- 
quently be found that the trouble is with the kidneys. The only time to do 
anything of value with Bright's disease is at its start. The urine should 
always be examined and especially in a chronic case of disease. 

PEOPLE'S HOME REMEDIES-— 

1. White Bean Soup. — Boil a double handful of the pods of the com- 
mon white soup bean or corn bean in three quarts of water until it is reduced 
to half the quantity. Let this be the only thing the patient drinks and he 
should drink freely of it. ' , 

2. Milk, — A New York physician has cured many cases of Bright's 
disease by putting his patients upon a milk diet alone. Care should be taken 
to get the purest of milk and the patient should gradually leave off other food 
and increase the daily amount of milk taken to 5 pints. , 

3. Bread and Milk.— Put the patient on a strict diet of stale bread and 
skimmed milk. 



180 THE PEOPLE'S HOME MEDICAL BOOK. 

UREMIA. 

This term relates to a group of acute and chronic manifestations result- 
ing from poison in the blood due to the retention in the body of certain pro- 
ducts of urinary or kidney origin. 

Symptoms of Acute Form. — Very severe nervous symptoms come on 
suddenly. They last a very short time and may soon terminate fatally with 
convulsions, coma, difficult breathing, feeble heart action, feeble pulse, fever 
and lung cedema. Sometimes these symptoms are preceded by mild uremic 
forerunners such as headache, drowsiness, tired feeling, uneasiness and slight 
difficulty in breathing. 

Sjmiptoms of Chronic Form. — There is an absence of the above marked 
symptoms and milder manifestations appear. In this form the general pros- 
tration, feeble heart, arterial conditions, occasional stupor and delirium, fleet- 
ing dimness of sight, loathing of food, sickness at the stomach, irregular and 
hurried breathings and twitching of the muscles indicate the grave condition 
of the patient. The skin of the face is usually pale in uremic co^ma. 

Treatment. — The treatment is given under Bright's disease. Sweating 
by placing in a warm pack is necessary so as to relieve the kidneys. Cathar- 
tics shpuld also be given. 

STONE IN THE KIDNEY. 
Nephro-Lithiasis — Renal Calculus. 

Description. — The stones are formed in the kidneys from solids derived 
from the urine. They may be present for years without causing any dis- 
turbance. Sometimes they suddenly cause trouble if the patient suffers from 
a fall, which causes the stone to damage the lining membrane of the pelvis 
(part of kidney) and as a result there may be blood in the urine. Or, the 
stone may be started from its nest and proceed to travel down the small 
channel from the kidney to the bladder and thus cause an attack of renal colic. 
The result depends upon the condition of the kidney around the stone. 

Symptoms. — As stated the stones may be in the kidneys for years with- 
out causing trouble. When they escape into the ureter they cause kidney, or 
renal, colic. The pain is sometipjes agony and extends into the pelvis and 
inner side of the thighi and even into the groin or testicle and penis. The 
bladder may be irritable and there may be blood in the urine. Sometimes 
there is total suppression (no passing) of urine if both ureters are closed. 
Then it is very dangerous and an operation must be performed. 

TREATMENT. — Relieve the pain at once by a hypodermic injection of 
Yi grain of morphine. Between the attacks drink large quantities of pure 
water like Poland water or one of the Lithia waters, unless the urine is alka- 
line. If that is the condition drink large quantities of water and take uritone 
or urotropin or benzoat of ammonia for the purpose of making the urine acid. 
The dose is from 5 to 10 grains. 

If the urine is extremely acid drink water very freely. It is best also to 
take from 15 to SO grains of bicarbonate of potassium, 3 or 4 times a day. 
In other cases give citrate of potassium in 10-grain dosfes. Drink no sweet 
wines or beer, but a little rye or Scotch whiskey may be taken, but it is better 
to do without these drinks altogether. Sedentary people should take some 
exercise. 

Herb Treatment. — Queen of the Meadow made into a tea and drank freely 



DISEASES OF THE KIDNEYS AND BLADDER. 181 

is very good. My wife has a cousin who for years was troubled with kidney 
colic and " gravel " passing. One time, many years ago, my wife was visiting 
this cousin when he was taken with this colic. He suffered very much pain. 
From the description I think it must have been caused by gravel. At the 
time he was suffering so much, an Indian whom they well knew, happened 
to stop in and when he saw the distress of the patient and was told the cause 
he went out into the fields and gathered some Queen of the Meadow (Eupa- 
torium Furpureum). He made a strong tea of this and had the patient drink 
freely of it and the result was that he was soon relieved of the pain. He con- 
tinued taking this remedy for some time and was cured. This was over 30 
years ago and he is -still living. 

Homeopathic Treatment. — For the bloody urine take the third trituration 
of Terebinth. Take a tablet every two hours. 

If there is red sand in the urine take the twelfth trituration of Lycopodium 
in the same way. 

Berberis Vulgaris is a good remedy. Use 2 drops of the tincture every 
2 hours. 

ABSCESS OF THE KIDNEY, 

Causes. — Blows and infectious fevers. 

Symptoms. — It may develop suddenly but it usually develops gradually. 
There is constant pain over the kidney and the usual symptoms of blood 
poisoning. 

Treatment. — ^The treatment is an operation. 

PYELO-NEPHRITIS AND PYELITIS. 

Description. — Pyelo-Nephritis is an inflammation affecting both the 
pelvis, or sac, of the kidney and the kidney itself. There is usually a pus 
condition. Pyelitis is an inflammation of the pelvis, or sac, of the kidney only. 

Causes.— Generally due to infection from the bladder or urethra. 
* Symptoms. — Cystitis, or inflammation of the bladder, may either precede 
or follow this condition and mask the disease. There is pain and tenderness, 
in the back over the kidneys and this is perhaps attended with frequent pass- 
ing of the urine. The urine is acid, contains pus cells and blood cells and 
epithelium and is usually scanty in the acute form but profuse in chronic 
pyelitis. 

The result depends upon the cause. In simple pyelitis, occurring during 
one of the infectious diseases, the outlook is not bad. If the formation of pus 
is marked the outlook is not good. 

TREATMENT. — For the milder forms use diuretics, apply counter-irrita- 
tion by cups or heat over the loins, and rest in bed. No highly seasoned food 
should be allowed. If the urine is acid give alkaline diuretics and salol. If 
the urine is alkaline give 5 grains of uritone or urotropin 3 or 4 times daily 
in a glass of good water. Other good remedies are acetate of potash in 5- 
grain doses, citrate of potash in 10-grain doses and sweet spirits of nitre in 
1-dram doses. 

Homeopathic Treatment. — Use the second dilution of Aconite. Put 10 
or 15 drops into half a glass of water and give Lor 2 teaspoonfuls every hour 
to 3 hours. Prepare the third dilution of Belladonna in the same way and it 
should follow the use of the Aconite. If there, is scanty and painful urination 



182 , THE PEOPLE'S HOME MEDICAL BOOK. 

use the third dilution of Cantharis. Prepare the same as the Aconite. These 
are very good when used alternately every hour. 

PEOPLE'S HOME REMEDIES FOR DISEASES OF THE KIDNEYS 

AND BLADDER. . 

1. Fomentations of Hops and Tobacco. — If inflammation of the kidneys 
is caused by the passage of stone, apply warm fomentations of hops and to- 
bacco leaves over the pain. This may be used in connection with other 
remedies. 

3. Cider, Horseradish, Etc. — To a quart of sour cider add ati ounce each 
of bruised horseradish and bruised parsley root and % ounce each of bruised 
juniper berries, mustard seed, and ginger. Let them stand and steep for 
several days and take a wineglassful 3 times a day. A man in Pennsylvania 
who had kidney trouble for years and who had tried several specialists was 
finally cured with this simple remedy. It will be found excellent for many 
kinds of kidney ti;ouble. * 

3. Mustard, Hops, Etc. — For inflammation of the kidneys place the feet 
in hot mustard water and apply a mustard poultice to the small of the back 
and follow with hot fomentations of hops and stramonium leaves. 

4. Parsley. — This is very good for dropsy and especially dropsy follow-' 
ing scarlet fever. It is also good for retention of the urine or painful urination. 
The seeds and leaves povvdered and sprinkled on the head will destroy lice. 
The dose of the tea is from 3 to 4 ounces 4 times a day and the dose of the 
oil is from 3 to 5 drops. The tea is made by using from % to 2 ounces of the 
plant to a pint of boiling water. 

5. Pumpkin Seed Tea. — For congestion of the kidneys and scanty urin- 
ation a tea made from pumpkin seeds will be found wonderfully beneficial 
and is used by many doctors., A tea made from water melon seeds is also good. 

6. Wild Carrot. — Make a tea of the roots and seeds and take from 2 to 
4 ounces 3 times a day. This is one of the best remedies known, for dropsy, 
gravel and urinary troubles generally. 

7. Common Broom. — Take from 2 to 4 ounces of the fresh tops and 
seeds and make a tea with a pint of boiling water. The dose is 4 ounces every 
hour or two until the effect is produced. This relieves dropsy.of the chest 
by increasing the flow of urine. 

8. Scouring Rush. — The tea drank freely is good for dropsy and sup- 
pressed or bloody urine. 

9. . For Dropsy. — Take 6 quarts- of good cider which is medium hard; 4

ounce each of juniper berries, squills, white mustard sfeed, mandrake and the 
root of queen of the meadow. Put all in an un^lazed earthen vessel and cover 
and allow to infuse for 34 hours. The dose is a wineglassful 3 or 4 times a 
day. This will be found to be an excellent combination for dropsy. 

10. Queen of the Meadow. — This is an excellent kidney and bladder 
remedy and is especially good for gravel and bloody and painful urination. 
It is also good to increase the flow of urine. Th dose of the tea is from 
2 to 4 ouHceSj 4 times a day. 

Physician's Remark. — I know this to be good and hav? recommended it 
for stone in the kidneys. Read the Indian ^tory related in treating that dis- 
ease. ' 

11. Corn Silk. — Make a tea of corn silks and it will be found to be a 
fine remedy for all kinds of bladder troubles. Use the green silks if possible 



DISEASES OF THE KIDNEYS AND BLADDER. 183 

but the dry silks are also good, Drink freely of the tea. The doctors use 
this frequently. 

13. Trailing Arbutus. — A, tea made of the leaves may be drank freely. 
It is good foF gravel and all urinary diseases. 

13. Cleavers. — This is good for suppressed urine and inflammation of the 
kidneys and bladder. Use 1% ounces of the herb to a pint of warm water 
and steep for two hours. Take from 1 to 4 ounces, 4 times a day. 

14. Arbutus, Queen of the Meadow, Etc. — Coarsely bruise i/^ ounce each 
of trailing arbutus, queen of the meadow and marshmallow root ; pour boiHng

16. Juniper Berries and Sweet Spirits of Nitre. — Use 5 drops of oil of' 
juniper berries and 1 teaspoonful of sweet spirits of nitre. This is one, dose 
and should be given every 3 to 5 hours. This is very good for kidney and 
bladder troubles when there is not enough urine. 

17. Buchu Leaves. — Use 1 ounce of the leaves to a pint of boiling water 
and steep from 1 to 3 hours., This, taken freely, is very good for suppressed 
and painful urination or inflammation of the bladder. 

SUPPRESSION OR RETENTION OF URINE. 
Anuria. 

This is when no urine is passed. 

Treatment. — The treatment depends upon the cause. If it comes from 
stones an operation will be necessary to remove them. 

■ Allopathic Treatment. — If from other causes than stones give hypodermic 
injections every 3 or 4 hours of full doses of nitroglycerin. Give nitrate of 
potash in 10-grain doses. If the kidneys are much congested apply hot 
poultices or compresses across the small of the back or resort to oupping as 
described in treating chronic congestion of the kidneys. 

Homeopathic Treatment.^If there is scanty or light-colored urine give 
the third trituration of Apis. Mel. every half hour or every hour. Give one 
tablet at a dose. If there is thirst and restlessness give the third trituration 
of Arsenicum in the same way. 

Physician's' Remarks. — Some years ago a gentleman \yho did not at that 
time doctor with me met me on the street. He told me his doctor was away 
and that his baby was troubled in passing water and passed but little. As he 
was a farmer I asked him if he had any pumpkin seeds. He replied that he had 
and I told him to make a tea of them and give it to the child. He gave me a 
queer look as though he thought I was not in earnest. " Oh, oi course," 1 said, 
" you can come up to the oiiSce and I can give you a prescription and charge 
you for it but there is nothing that will do more good than pumpkin seed tea." 
So he agreed to try it. A few days afterward he again met me and said that 
the child was now all right. He said he had never heard. of that remedy before. 
There is more medicaj virtue in pumpkin seeds than many think. Medicine 
made from them is called " pepo " by the doctors but the simple tea is just

as effiective. By eating enough of the seeds at night you can stupefy a tape- 
worm and a cathartic given three or four hours afterwards will generally 
expel the worm. You would be surprised to know the medical properties 
of many of these so-called mild remedies. They only need to be' used properly 
to bring out their unsuspected powers. 

A friend in Pennsylvania wrote me some time ago that he did not pass 
enough urine and that urination was very painful. I wrote and told him 
I could send him a prescription but -I advised him to go to the drug store 
and get a simple remedy — a five-cent package of buchu leaves. Many of 
these herbs are now put up in this way and are cheap and handy to use. I 
told him to make a tea of these leaves and drink of it freely. He wrote to me 
soon afterwards saying he was surprised at the quick and splendid efifect of 
a remedy apparently so simple. Buchu leaves contain a number of medical 
constituents. Many simple remedies are just as effective as the more power- 
ful drugs. 

PEOPLE'S HOME REMEDIES.— 

1. Pumpkin Seed Tea. — ^When used freely this is especially good for 
children. Cut the seeds and steep for 1 or 2 hours. Give from 1 to 4 tea- 
spoonfuls at a dose where the urine does not pass freely. This is a very good 
remedy. 

2. Pumpkin, Watermelon or Cucumber Seeds.-^An excellent remedy is 
a tea made from either pumpkin, watermelon or cucumber seeds. 

3. Spearmint Tea.^Have the patient drink a pint of spearmint tea to 
which has been added half a gill of Holland gin and an ounce of spirits of 
nitre. The Whole of this should be drank within an hour at different times. 
If one dose is not enough it may be repeated within two hours. 

Physician's Remark. — This will be found to be an excellent remedy. 

4. Hops and Lobelia. — If inflammation of the neck of the bladder is the 
cause of the retention of the urine, remain in a warm foot bath for 'twenty 
minutes and then apply between the legs a fomentation of equal parts of 
hops anjd lobelia leaves. 

Physician's Remarks. — Here is another good remedy. Still others will 
be found under the home remedies for the diseases of the kidneys and bladder. 

5. Baths and Drinks. — Baths of either cold or warm water are good. 
Also drink freely of cold water or gum arable water. 

BLOODY URINE. 
Haematuria. 
Causes. — Stone, acute fevers, blows, injuries, etc. 

TREATMENT. — The patient should have rest. Counter irritants like 
mustard, turpentine and cantharides should not be advised and especially in 
large doses. 

, Homeopathic Treatment. — For weakness from loss of much blood give 
the second dilution of Chma. 
PEOPLFS HOME REMEDIES.— 

1. Drinks.— ^Give mild drinks such as slippery elm tea. 

LITHURIA. 

This is an excess of uric acid in the urine. 

Treatment. — Give plenty of water and a proper diet. Not too much meat. 



DISEASES OF THE KIDNEYS AND BLADDER. 186 

INFLAMMATION OF THE BLADDER. 

Cystitis. 
SYMPTOMS.— 

Acute Form. — There is severe pain in the region of the bladder which 
is worse from pressure or motion. There is frequent and painful urination 
with straining and a feeling of scalding. The urine is passed drop by drop, 
is highly colored, hot and sometimes mixed with blood, mucus and pus. 

Symptoms of Chronic Form. — ^This is not so painful. There is frequent 
urging to pass urine. The urine is cloudy and when poured from one 
vessel to another it looks like a ropy mass. 
TREATMENT.— 

Treatment of Acute Form. — Give mild drinks and lots of water. 

Homeopathic Treatment. — For the first stage use the third dilution of 
Aconite. Put 10 or 15 drops into half a glass of wafer and give 1 or 3 
teaspoonfuls every 1 to 3 hours. 

Use the third attenuation of Cantharis. This may be alternated with 
the Aconite if desired. 

If there is bloody urine give a dose pf the third attenuation' of Tere- 
binth every two hours. 

Allopathic Treatment. — Washing out the bladder with boiled water and 
some antiseptic like boric acid is very good but must be done carefully and 
must never be done by one who has not had experience. Ifermanganate of 
potash is good to put in the water and golden seal is also good and especially 
when the trouble is more acute. 
PEOPLE'S HOME REMEDIES.— 

Physician's Remark. — Whenever injections into the bladder are given 
they should be done ty one who knows how and is clean and careful. 

1» Teas of Buchu, Pumpkin or Watermelon Seeds. — Give mild drinks 
such as teas made from buchu leaves or pumpkin or watermelon seeds. 

2. Corn Silk Tea. — Corn silk tea is largely used by physicians for all 
kinds of bladder trouble. Steep the corn silks' in water and drink freely. The 
green silks are best but they are good either green or dry. 

Physician's Remark. — Yes, this tea will be found very effective. 

3. Flaxseed Tea;-; — Flaxseed tea is good for this and also for kidnev 
troubles. » 

4. Bean Pods. — Drink a tea made of bean pods for chronic inflammation 
of the bladder. 

5. Golden Seal. — One of the finest remedies for chronic inflammation 
of the bladder is a tea made from golden seal roots Carefully inject the 
warm tea into the bladder once a day., A tea made from equal parts of golden 
seal, witch hazel and stramonium is better in some cases. 

6 Arnica, Etc. — Carefully give injections of warm water with a few' 
drops of tincture of arnica, and drink teas of either flaxseed, raarshmallow 
or peach leaves. 

7. Hot Fomentations. — Apply hot fomentations of hops, tansy, worm- 
wood or chamomile flowers; use the hot foot bath and give internally some 
parsley tea with a little spirits of nitre and gin added. 

Physician's Remark. — This is a combination of some good remedies and 
will be found very effective. 

S. Castor Oil. — Take a warm hip bath and a tablespoonful of castor oil. 



186^ , THE PEOPLE'S HOME MEDICAL BOOK. , 

Physician's Remark. — By relieving constipation you frequently relieve 
the trouble. 

Other remedies will be found under the home, remedies for diseases of the 
kidneys and bladder. 

BED WETTING. 
Incontinence of Urine — Enuresis. 

Urine, or water, is passed involuntarily at night, usually during the first 
hours of sleep. ' 

Causes. — It is sometimes caused by stone in the bladder but more fre- 
quently it is caused in children by worms. 
TREATMENT.— ' 

Preventive Treatment. — Remove the causes and raise the foot of the 
bed a little but not too much. Sometimes bed wetting becomes a habit. 
The child shoulcf be taught to pass water during the day as soon as there 
is a call of nature. It should not hold the water for a while, then at night 
it will be aroused and awake when there is a desire to pass water. Do not 
let the child drink- much liquid at night. Have him sleep on his side with as 
little clothing as possible. The bowels should be kept regular and he should 
have a passage every day. See that the private parts are kept clean and 
then there will be no irritation from that cause. 

Allopathic Treatment. — Give the fluid extract of ergot 3 times a day. 
Give from 10 to 30 drops according to age. Thirty drops is the dose for 
a grown person. 

Give from I/2 drop to 5 drops of tincture of belladonna before going to 
bed. Five drops is the dose for an adult. 

Homeopathic Treatment. — Third dilution of Belladonna ; third trituration 
of Nux Vomica; and the second dilution of Equisetum. 
PEOPLE'S HOME REMEDIES.— 

1. Dandelion or Cherry Bark. — Have the child drink freely of tea made 
from either dandelion root or cherry bark. 

2. Isinglass. — The following is an excellent remedy for bed wetting. 
Boil a roll of isinglass (long, staple) in a pint of water until dissolved. Add 
a pint of sweet milk, bring to a boil, and sweeten with loaf sugar. If made 
properly it looks like custard. Grate a little nutmeg upoH it. The dose for 
a grown person is a tumblerful 3 times a day. Give to childreii in proportion 
to age. 



DISEASES OF THE NERVOUS SYSTEM. 



HEADACHES. 



There are diflferent kinds of headaches arising from different causes and 
we will treat each kind .separately. There is the stomach sick headadhe, the 
bilious sick headache, the nervous, the neuralgic and the catarrhal headacjhe. 
Each must be treated from the standpoint of original cause if you expect a 
real cure. Headaches may be caused by disorders of the stonjach, bowels, 
kidneys, liver or nerves and also by catarrh, weak eyes and female troubles. 
First find out the CAUSE of your headache and then treat that. 

SICK HEADACHE. 
Migraine — Hemicrania. 

Causes. — Women and nervous people most frequently suffer with this 
ailment. It may be caused by womb and ovarian diseases and is frequently 
hereditary. It may also arise from disorders of the stomach, bowels, liver 
or kidneys. 

Symptoms. — Every one knows the symptoms of sick headache. It usually 
starts in the morning and lasts all day and sometimes even for three or four 
days. It may start in the back of the head and go to the front and settle 
in or above One eye or even on both sides. It may cause one to see double 
or to become partially blind. There is often a wave of sick feeling that 
goes froin the head to the stomach or from the stomach to the head. Some- 
times, one cannot bear any noise. After a time the person feels sick at the 
stomach and gets worse and then there is vomiting of a sour vomit and finally 
there may be bile present in the vomited material. The vomiting gives re- 
lief if the stomach is full of food but sometimes there is no vomiting. The 
urine may be scanty. 

TREATMENT. — Keep the stomach, liver, bowels and kidneys working 
well. ' 

Stomach, and Bowels. — Have at least one passage from the bowels every 
day because constipation is the cause of a great many sick headaches. Avoid 
rich greasy foods such as gravies, soups, fried eggs, fried potatoes, fried 
meats, pork, sausage, liverwurst, pies and cakes. Puddings, fresh bread, hot 
biscuitSj preserves and too much butter all cause sick headaches. 

Treatment for Kidneys.— If the urine is not right or appears too thin 
give acetate, bitrate or bi-tartrate of potash in 5 or 10-grain doses with con- 
siderable water. Give three or four times daily. The urine generally has no 
color as there are not enough solids cast off. This kind of urine is also seen 
in nervous headache. 

Treatment for the Liver. — If the liver is persistently inactive take calotnel, 
blue mass or podophyllin. Many such cases do well if the patient takes 5 
or 10 grains of blue mass every week or 10 days and follows this with salts 
in 6 or 7 hours dr sooner. 

Secure plenty of rest and sleep and live an outdoor life as much as pos- 

187 



188 THE PEOPLE'S HOME MEDICAL BOOK. 

sible, fbr even with the best care and dieting sick headaches sometimes 
come but, with proper diet and living, they will come less frequently and 
not be so severe. 

Allopathic Treatment. — Hunyadi water taken hot and in sips before 
breakfast will often regulate the bowels and prevent an attack. For the 
terrible pain use phenacetin or acetanilid in 5-grain doses. The second dose 
can be taken an hour after the first. Both of these remedies are hard on 
the heart and care must be exercised in their use. The following prescrip- 
tion is a good one. Citrate of caffeine, % dram; phenacetin, 1 dram; bicar- 
bonate of soda, 1 dram ; and aromatic powder, 12 grains ; mix thoroughly and 
make 13 powders. Take one every 1 to 3 hours. Sometimes it is well to 
produce vomiting, especially if you can do so by taking a little salt water. 

Homeopathic Treatment. — I have been very successful in treating head- 
aches with homeopathic medicines and as this is a very common ailment I 
will give the homeopathic treatment a little more fully than I have for some 
other diseases. 

Put 3 drops of the tincture of blood root into half a glass of water and 
take 3 teaspoonfuls of the solution every 15 minutes until relieved. However, 
I like the homeopathic form of the blood root the better. Put 10 drops of 
the first dilution of Blood Root into half a glass of water and give 3 teaspoon- 
fuls every fifteen minutes until relieved. Blood root is especially good when 
the pain begins on the right side of the neck and passes forward and settles 
above the right eye and you have a sick stomach. 

If there is no sickness at the stomach but the head is bent forward and it 
feels as though the brain would fall out of the forehead, then Bryonia is the 
medicine to use. Put 10 or 15 drops of the second dilution of Bryonia into 
half a glass of water and give 3 teaspoonfuls every 15 minutes until relieved. 

If there is a dull frontal sick headache with persistent and continued 
constipation, so-called " drink headache," then use the third trituration of 
Nux Vomica. If the tincture of Nux Vomica is used, from 1 to 5 drops 
should be given at a dose. 

BILIOUS SICK HEADACHE. 

Cause. — This is caused by fat, greasy foods or by the presence of men- 
struation. 

Homeopathic Treatment. — Iris, or blue flag, is the treatment for this. 
Prepare it the same as the blood root is prepared for stomach sick headache 
and give in the same way. The blood root is for stomach sick headache and 
the blue flag for bilious sick headache. If you are not sure which you have it is 
well to alternate these two medicines every ten minutes. This is a very 
effective treatment. If the headache is due to the presence of menstruation 
the third dilution of Pulsatilla is good, especially for blondes. Put 10 or 15 
drops into half a glass of water and give 3 teaspoonfuls every half hour until 
relieved. 

NEURALGIC HEADACHE. 

While the term " neuralgic headache " is not technically correct we will 
use it as it is best understood in this way. It is not due to other diseases but 
it just seems to " come on." Every one knows the symptoms. The pain 
is sometimes light and again it is quite severe. It is usually one-sided and 



DISEASES OF THE NERVOUS SYSTEM. 189 

is frequently caused by taking cold in a hollow tooth. It is well to tone up 
the system with good tonics. 

Homeopathic Treatment. — Spigelia, or pink root, is a good remedy and 
especially when it is on the left side. Put 10 or 15 drops of the second 
dilution of Spigelia into half a glass of water and give 2 teaspoonfuls every 
15 minutes until relieved. 

When it is periodic and comes on at regular hours ; is more in the face ; 
and the patient is hot, restless and thirsty and a little water satisfies the 
thirst; then the third trituration of Arsenicum is the medicine to use. 

For congestive headache when the head is throbbing and the eyes are 
red and sore and cannot bear the light, use the third dilution of Belladonna. 
Put 10 or 15 drops into half a glass of water and give 2 teaspoonfuls every 
15 minutes until relieved. The Allopathic treatment and Nursing given under 
" Nervous Headache " will also apply here. 

NERVOUS HEADACHE. 

Causes. — Nervous headache is a very common trouble and may be caused 
by over-doing or by excitement. It is common in school children. Weak eyes 
are the cause when glasses are needed or when poorly fitted glasses are 
worn. Poor health, worry, trouble and want of sleep are some of the many 
causes. 

Symptoms. — The. common cry, " I'm so nervous I can't stand it," tells 
the tale. The head feels so big and heavy that you can scarcely hold it up. 
You may be sleepy; or, on the other hand, you may be sleepless. Some- 
times a good restful sleep seems to do a world of good. Some cases are re- 
lieved by the passing of a considerable quantity of light-colored urine. The 
arms and legS are heavy and there is a desire to be quiet. Often the legs 
are so weak that it is painful to walk. 
TREATMENT.— 

Allopathic Treatment. — The Allopathic prescription given in treating sick 
headache is also good for nervous headache. 

Give from 10 to 15 grains of bromide of potash. This may be re- 
peated each half hour until 3 doses have been taken. 

One teaspoonful of tincture of hops is good when given every 3 hours. 

A 5-grain tablet of either acetanilid or antikammia may be taken and 
repeated in 3 hours. These are good remedies but are hard on the heart 
and should be used carefully. 

Homeopathic Treatment — When you are very nervous use the first di- 
lution of Gelsemium. Put 5 to 10 drops into half a glass of water and 
take 2 teaspoonfuls at a dose. Repeat every 15 minutes for 4 doses, then 
every hour. 

The third dilution of Belladonna is especially good when the head beats 
and throbs. Prepare and give the same as the Gelsemium. 

The second dilution of Coffea prepared and given in the same way is 
good when it feels as though a nail had been driven into the side of the head. 

The third trituration of Nux Vomica is good for those living a sedentary 
life and troubled with constipation. 

The sixth trituration of Sepia is good for headache in delicate and sensi-, 
tive women, especially brunettes, when it comes with scanty menstruation. 

For the headache, when the menstruation is very profuse and too fre- ' 
quent, give the first dilution of Platina. Give the same as the Gelsemium. 

Natrum Mur. is used when there are headaches from over study. 



190 THE PEOPLE'S HOME MEDICAL BOOK. 

Nursing and Diet. — Spend all the time possible, out of doors. I have 
had a number of patients tell me that the work of taking care of a hor^se 
has seemed to benefit them most. No doubt this was partly due to the 
exercise. When suffering with either nervous or neuralgic headache, bathing 
the head with warm water and at the same time rubbing the head with the 
hands often quiets the patient. Sometimes, especially when the head beats 
hard, the application of cold cloths to the head will give relief. A warm 
foot bath is then good, also, as it brings the blood to the extremities and re- 
lieves the congestion in the head. Sometimes a mustard plaster applied to 
the back of the neck is good. It is well to add the white of an egg to the 
mustard to prevent blistering. 

It is well to place the patient in a rather dark room where it is quiet 
and then a strong, healthy, sympathetic person should rub the head with 
the hands. In some cases. this does much good. The patient needs quiet, 
rest and sleep during an attack but at other times should have fresh air and 
exercise. The system generally needs building up. Sometimes these head- 
aches are due to womb troubles and then these troubles should be attended to. 
Headache powders and tablets relieve the pain but they are injurious and some- 
times dangerous. They are hard on both the nerves and the heart and in 
time will injure any one. 

CATARRHAL HEADACHE. 

Causes. — This is caused by inflammations due to catarrhal conditions of 
the passages of the head. There are often growths in the nose and throat that 
need attention. 

SYMPTOMS. — The pain and inflammation extends from the nose pas- 
sages to the openings in the skull above the eyes. 

Treatment. — Treat the catarrh. Frequently there are growths in the nose 
and throat that need to be removed. 

PEOPLE'S HOME REMEDIES FOR HEADACHES. 

1. Nervous Headache. — Apply a mustard plaster to the temples or back 
of the neck. 

2. » Sick Headache. — Add a teaspoonful of lemon juice to 3 gills of warm 
water. Repeat this dose every 15 minutes. Hundreds of cases of sick head- 
ache are cured with this simple remedy. Let it become more generally known 
and there will be much less suffering from this sickness. 

3. Congestive Headache. — If the headache is caused by congestion of 
blood in the head, bathe the head with vinegar and cold water and the feet 
with warm water. Bathe the temples and forehead with either warm or col(^ 
water as desired. 

Physician's Remarks. — This relieves the congestion by drawing the 
blood away from the head. 

4. Headache with Rheumatism. — For this use the following liniment. 
Take 3 ounces of saltpeter, 1 quart of brandy, 3 ounces of camphor, and 
3 "gills of spirits of turpentine. Wet a flannel with this liniment and apply 
to the head. ' 

5. Headache from Constipation. — Take 1/2 ounce each of mandrake or 
May apple root, blue flag root, golden seal root, prickly ash bark and yellow 
puccoon and add Yo gill of beef's gall and % pint of whiskey. Let stand for 
two weeks and take a teaspoonful 3 or 3 times a day. 

I 



DISEASES OF THE NERVOUS SYSTEM. 191 

6. Sour Stomach with Sick Headache. — When there is acidity of the 
stomach with sick headache add 2 teaspoonfuls of powdered willow charcoal 
to one-half teacupful of soda water (baking soda) and take at one dose. 

7. Sick Headache. — Have the patient drink sage or pennyroyal tea and 
give some mild cathartic after the patient has been made to vomit. 

8. Gas on Stomach in Sick Headache. — To half a glass of water add 3 
teaspoonfuls of powdered charcoal and drink for sick headache. This corrects 
the stomach which is the seat of the trouble. 

9. Nervous Headache. — This is often instantly relieved by shampooing 
the head with a quart of cold water in which has been dissolved a dessert 
spoonful of soda. 

10. Sick Headache. — Bathe the head with cool water. 

11. Brown Paper and Camphor.- — Saturate brown paper with camphor, 
apply to the head and bind on with a bandage. Repeat every few minutes 
while the patient is lying down. 

12. Sick Headache. — Drink a cup of coffee to which has been added 
the juice of a lemon or 2 tablespoonfuls of vinegar. 

13. Rochelle Salts. — Take a teaspoonful of rochelle salts every other 
night upon retiring. 

14. Hot and Cold Water. — Apply cold water to the head when it 
feels good and warm applications to the feet, particularly when they are cold. 

1-5. Mustard. — Take ^/^ teaspoonful of whole grains of mustard inter- 
nally and use hot applications on the forehead and back of the neck. 

Physician's Remarks. — The mustard is to be taken when vomiting is 
desired. The hot applications are counter-irritants. 

16. Nervous Headache. — Mix 7 ounces of valerian root, 5 ounces of 
licorice root, 1 ounce of oil of anise, 1 dram of camphor gum and 1% pints 
of alcohol. Take from 1 to 3 teaspoonfuls eVery 15 minutes until relieved. 

NEURALGIA. 

Neuralgia is a painful affection of the nerves. Every one who has had 
it will at least testify as to the painful part. We will speak of several types of 
neuralgia. 

Neuralgia of the Face — Tri-Facial Neuralgia — ^Tic-Douloureux — Spas- 
modic Neuralgia of the Face — Prosopalgia. — All the branches of the tri-facial 
nerve are seldom affected at the same time. There are terrible pains in the 
face with jerkings and twitchings. The pain radiates in the region of the ear,, 
along the lower jaw. Pain is also especially noticeable along the upper teeth. 
Eating and speaking may be painful. Sores sometimes occur on the lips 
or eye. Some of the forms of face neuralgia are of frightful intensity and 
the repeated attacks make the patient's life almost unbearable. Chronic 
neuralgia is hard to cure. 

Neuralgia of the Back of Head and Neck — Cervico-occipital Neuralgia. — 
This is neuralgia of the back of the head and neck. The painful point is 
about half way between the ear and the first cervical vertebra. It hurts 
to move the neck. Sometimes cold is the cause of this. 

Neuralgia of Neck and Shoulder — Cervico-brachial Neuralgia. — This is 
neuralgia of the neck and shoulder. The pain is in the deltoid muscle run- 
ning from the shoulder to the elbow. 

Neuralgia Underneath the Ribs — Intercostal Neuralgia. — The pain seems 
to He underneath the ribs. Next to tic-douloureux this is the most important 



192 THE PEOPLE'S HOME MEDICAL BOOK. 

form of neuralgia. It is more common in women than in men and is very- 
common in cases of hysteria. (Home remedies for " Stitch in the Side " will 
be found under " Neuritis.") 

Neuralgia of the Lower Part of the Spine — Coccydynia. — This is pain in 
the coccyx or lower part of the spinal column. It is most common in women 
and is made worse by sitting down. It may be very severe and the bone 
may have to be removed. 

Neuralgia of the Heel and Foot.— There may also be neuralgia in the 
heel and foot. 

TREATMENT. — Build up the system and regulate the mode of life. 
Change of air is sometimes good. A strict vegetable diet is sometimes neces- 
sary. Live an out of door life as much as possible and take plenty of exercise. 

Allopathic Treatment. — Arsenic, quinine, strychnine and cod liver oil 
are good. For the pain give antipyrin or phenacetin. Give strychnine for 
facial neuralgia. 

Homeopathic Treatment. — Belladonna, third dilution; Spigelia, second 
dilution ; Gelsemium, first dilution ; Arsenicum, third trituration ; and China, 
second dilution. For intercostal neuralgia use Ranunculus. These are all 
good. (For preparation and doses see " Homeopathic Medicines " in the 
Nursing Department.) 

PEOPLE'S HOME REMEDIES FOR NEURALGIA AND NERVOUS 
TROUBLES.— 

1. Thistle Tea. — A tea made from the common field or bull thistle is 
considered by the Germans a sure and permanent cure for neuralgia. The 
tea is made by pressing a vessel full of the leaves, filling with water, and 
boiling down one-half. A wineglassful of this may be taken internally 
twice a day. In severe cases a poultice of the bruised leaves may also be 
applied to the affected parts. Many remarkable and lasting cures have been 
effected by this simple remedy. In fact, it has never been known to fail. 

2. Sweating Treatment.— The following will be found almost a sure 
cure for neuralgia. Bathe the feet for half an hour in hot mustard water 
an(J at the same time drink smartweed tea; or, ginger tea will do. Then go 
to bed and take a sweat for from half to three-quarters of an hour. After the 
sweat sponge the body with warm water, dry, and rub briskly with the hands. 

Physician's Remarks. — This is good for neuralgia which comes from 
a cold or from inflammation. 

3. Steaming with Vinegar. — Wrap a cloth wrung out of vinegar around 
a hot brick or flatiron and apply to the face until it is thoroughly steamed. 
This is an effective remedy used by a celebrated French physician for 
neuralgia. 

4. Horse-radish. — Horse-radish is an excellent remedy for neuralgia. 
Grate the horse-radish and mix it with vinegar the same as when it is 
intended for the table. Apply this to the temple when the neuralgia is in 
the face and to the wrist when it is in the arm or shoulder. 

5. Burnt Sugar. — Burn some sugar on a hot stove and inhale the fumes. 

6. Hot Salt and Ashes. — Mix salt and ashes, heat well, put into a salt 
bag and apply to the parts affected with neuralgia. 

Physician's Remarks. — Dry heat is good in some cases of neuralgia. 

7. Salt and Alum. — If the neuralgia is in the jaw, put equal parts of 
pulverized salt and alum on a wet piece of cloth and rub upon the teeth. 



DISEASES OF THE NERVOUS SYSTEM. 193 

8. Lemon Juice.— Squeeze the juice of a lemon into a tumblsrfui of 
Vt'ater and take two or three mouthfuls every hour for neuralgia. 

9. Mustard. — Mustard plasters sometimes help neuralgia. 

10. Hops. — Hot fomentations of hops generally give relief from neu- 
ralgia. 

11. Lobelia and Salt. — Boil a small handful of lobelia in half a pint of 
water, strain, and add half a teaspoonful of salt. Wring cloths out of the 
liquid as hot as possible and apply to the affected parts, i Change as rapidly 
as it cools. This is for neuralgia. 

12. Oil of Peppermint. — " Paint the affected parts with oil of pepper- 
mint," writes a lady who has tried it for neuralgia. 

13. Mustard, Ginger, Cloves, Cinnamon and Vinegar. — Make a poultice 
of a tablespoonful of ground mustard, a little ginger, cloves, and cinnamon ; 
mix these with vinegar. Place between cheese cloth and apply to the parts 
affected with neuralgia. Hold warm cloths on but do not blister. Mustard 
alone is also good. 

14. Liniment for Neuralgia. — Take equal parts of camphor, chloroform 
and olive oil. " I have known this to succeed in many cases," writes a lady 
from Wichita, Kansas. (

taken oftener. Good for cramps of muscles, spasms, hysteria, nervousness and 
asthma, and is especially good during jjregnancy. 

Physician's Remark. — Most cases of neuralgia of the jaw, face and temple 
are produced by bad teeth. 

HYSTERIA. 

Description. — This is a state in which ideas control the body and pro- 
duce morbid changes in its functions. 

Causes. — The disease is more common in women and usually first appears 
about the time of puberty but it may continue for years. Heriedity and the 
training of the child have much to do with it. Uncontrolled children or 
children who are allowed to have their own way too much while growing up 
are especially likely to have hysteria. Over-study may also cause it as may 
disorders of the ovaries and womb. 
SYMPTOMS.— 

Convulsive Form. — It may come on suddenly or it may be preceded by 
alternate laughing and crying or a sense of tightness about the neck or feel- 
ings as of a ball rising in the throat. Sometimes the patient suddenly falls over 
and is unconscious but the fall is rather easy. Unconsciousness may not last 
long. 

Major Forms. — ^The attack is begutf by foolish behavior, excitement, dys- 
peptic symptoms, gas in the bowels, frequent passing of urine, over-sensitive- 
ness of the body, feeling as of a ball in the throat, sensation of oppression, 
attacks like true epilepsy, and emotional twisting. The patient tells with 
great soberness and earnestness about imagined ecstacies, visions, voices, 
and conversations. She imagines things and even makes very serious charges 
against people. The convulsions may follow each other for days at a time. 
After the attack the patient may sink into a trance or lethargy. 

TREATMENT.— 

Preventive Treatment. — Raise your children out of doors and let them 
have lots of exercise. Don't let the girls over-study duririg puberty. Let 
there be less of social and excitable life. Don't push them forward so much 
to " show off." See that they have plenty of sleep, rest, and hearty, but not 
rich, food. Avoid stimulants like strong coffee, teas and wines. See that 
they have good warm dresses and underwear and that they do not lace tightly. 



DISEASES OF THE NERVOUS SYSTEM. 19S 

Keep them out of doors. If need be, send them to a farm where they will 
have outdoor life and sunshine and where they can play in the barns and fields 
and smell the new-mown hay. 

Allopathic Treatment. — Have the patient smell of amyl. Break a capsule 
Into a handkerchief for this purpose. If there is anemia (poor blood) give 
tonics such as iron or arsenic. 

Homeopathic Treatment. — Pulsatilla, third dilution ; Gelsemium, first di- 
lution; Sepia, sixth trituration or Natrum Mur., thirtieth trituration. Pulsa- 
tilla is especially good for blondes and Sepia for brunettes. Gelsemium is 
for nervousness. (For doses and preparation see " Homeopathic Medicines " 
in Nursing Department.) 

PEOPLE'S HOME REMEDIES.— (Also see " Home Remedies for Neural- 
gia and Nervous Troubles.") 

1. Tonics.— For hysteria give tonics of gentian, columbo, cinchona or 
golden seal. 

2. Tonic Cordial for Hysteria. — Take 1 pound of poplar bark and 8 
ounces each of dogwood bark and the bark of the root of bayberry. These 
should all be made fine and a sufficient quantity of water added. Boil down 
to 2 gallons ; strain ; and add 7 pounds of sugar, 8 ounces of pulverized peach 
kernels and 1 gallon of French brandy and then bottle for use. The dose is 
half a wineglassful 3 or 4 times a day. 

NERVOUS EXHAUSTION. 
Neurasthenia. 

Causes.^ — Long continued mental strain, worry, and, in women, excessive 
social duties, are causes of nervous exhaustion. It may also follow weaken- 
ing diseases. 

Symptoms. — The symptoms are varied. In some cases the mental con- 
dition of the patient suffers chiefly and symptoms may vary from mere irritable 
temper to great mental depression and even to mental weakness, melancholia 
and insanity. Sometimes there is persistent sleeplessness. In other cases 
the patient has stomach and bowel troubles. The heart is lacking in nerve 
supply and there is palpitation, vertigo, and sometimes fainting. There are 
signs of hysteria, numbness, tingling and over-sensitiveness in painful parts. 

The degree of the recovery depends upon the ability of the doctor to get 
the patient away from the causes which produced the condition and upon the 
willingness of the patient to follow those methods of life which will re- 
establish his nervous balance and build up reserve energy. The recovery 
also depends partly upon the' age and physical condition of the patient. 

TREATMENT. — There is not much medicine needed. The homeopathic 
treatment is to give the second dilution of Gelsemium regularly for a long 
time. 

Nursing and Diet. — The patient must have absolute mental and physical 
rest and freedom from all worries. Give proper feeding and keep the stomach, 
bowels and kidneys in good working order. Do not over-do in any way. The 
patient should have cheerful rooms with plenty of sunshine and should always 
have pleasant, cheerful faces about him. He should have constant encourage- 
ment. Relatives and friends must remember that this is not a fancy but a 
real disease. I have known people who laughed at neurasthenics, or people 
suffering from nervous exhaustion, and I have later seen these same people 
in the same condition. Rest and encouragement will bring most cases 



196 THE PEOPLE'S HOME MEDICAL BOOK. 

through. Do not over-exert when you are getting better or you may have a 
relapse. Walking and slow driving with a safe horse and good company are 
helpful but do not have company who tire you. Most people are ignorant as 
to what to do or say to persons afflicted with this disease. So many people 
have no patience and should be kept away from those suffering with nervous 
exhaustion. A general change of scene is sometimes beneficial. 

SLEEPLESSNESS. 
Insomnia. 

Causes. — Often caused by nervousness and too much mental work, es- 
pecially at night. 
TREATMENT.— 

" What to Do." — Get away from excitement. Go to the country and be out 
doors doing light work as much as possible. Tone up the system. Drink 
hop tea or get a hop pillow to sleep on. Instead of the hop tea you can take 
the tincture of hops in 15-drop doses. Sleeping in the barn on the hay is 
often conducive to sleep. Some people need big pillows and some need none. 
Change of scene and work is generally of benefit. People who engage in out- 
door work, unless they work too hard, are generally good sleepers. Keep 
the head cool and the feet warm. 

t " What Not to Do." — Do not take opiates. Do not eat much at night 
and, on the other hand, do not go to bed with the stomach entirely empty. 
Do not do any mental work at night. Do not talk politics or religion and do 
not get excited when you can avoid it. 

Allopathic Treatment. — At bed time take 1/100 grain of hyoscine. From 
5 to 15-grain doses of potassium bromide are good for nervousness and over 
work. The tincture of valerian is good for nervousness. Take 1 teaspoonful 
in a glass of warm water or milk before retiring. 

Homeopathic Treatment. — The first or second dilution of Gelsemium is 
good when taken half an hour before bed time. Put 10 or 15 drops' into half a 
glass of water and take 2 teaspoonfuls. Or, you can prepare the third dilution 
of the same medicine in the same way and take two teaspoonfuls regtilarly 
every 3 hours during the day. 

PEOPLE'S HOME REMEDIES.— 

1. Onions. — Three or four small onions eaten just before going, to bed 
have a soothing narcotic effect and induce sleep. 

2- Cold Water Cloths. — Wet a towel in cold water and apply to the 
back of the neck and lower part of the head and cover with a dry towel. This 
is excellent where sleeplessness is the result 'of an overworked and congested 
brain. 

3. Food and Mental Exercises. — Eat a few bites of some light food. 
Recite poetry or the multiplication table. 

Physician's Remarks. — The food draws the blood to the stomach and thus 
relieves the congestion of the brain. 

4. Fresh Air and Sunshine. — Like all other afflictions the patient needs 
quiet, fresh air and clean, freshly aired bedding. Be out doors in the sunshine 
as much as possible. 

5. Hot Water. — Drink hot water three times a day or at any time you 
are thirsty and bathe the feet in hot water before going to bed. 

Physician's Remarks. — The hot water draws the blood to the stomach 



DISEASES OF THE NERVOUS SYSTEM. 197 

and the hot foot bath draws it to the feet, thus the blood is taken away from 
the brain and the congestion is relieved. 

6. For a Nervous Babe. — Place in some resting position and gently rub 
its back with the open hand. See how soon the little one is quiet or asleep. 

FAINTING.— (See" Accidents and Emergencies.") 

HICCOUGH.— (See "Accidents and Emergencies.") 

DIZZINESS OR VERTIGO.— (See "Accidents and Emergencies.") 

SCIATICA. 

Sciatic Rheumatism. 

Description. — The sciatic nerve runs from the hip down the back part of 
the leg find branches in the lower part of the leg and foot. Sciatica is inflam- 
mation of the sciatic nerve. It is frequent in people troubled with rheumatism 
or gout and occurs more frequently in men. 

Causes. — Exposure to cold when wet or sweating is the cause though it 
sometimes seems to come on without any cause. 

Symptoms. — There is pain in the hip and down the back part of the- 
thigh, reaching to the foot and radiating over it. Often the pain is excru- 
ciating and is sometimes accompanied with cramps. 
TREATMENT.— 

■ Rest in bed and if it is bad apply a splint to the leg. Apply fly blisters 
to the painful parts and sometimes morphine must be used. Warm baths and 
mud baths are also good. 

Allopathic Treatment. — Use salicylate of soda in 5 to 10-grain doses 3 
or 4 times a day. Fly blisters for all treatments. Apply leeches. Rest in 
bed. Alternate hot and cold water upon the parts. When the pain is confined 
to a small place apply fomentations of hops and vinegar. 

Homeopathic Treatment. — At the beginning when there is fever give the 
second dilution of Aconite. Rhus Tox., sixth dilution ; Colocynth, second di- 
lution ; Bryonia, second dilution ; and the third trituration of Arsenicum are 
all good. (For preparation and doses see " Homeopathic Medicines in Nurs- 
ing Department.) 

SUNSTROKE. 
Heat Stroke — Isolation or Thermic Fever — Coup de Soleil — Heat Exhaustion. 
, Description. — This is a condition produced by exposure to excessive heat. 
In rare cases the temperature of the patient is below normal and it is then 
called " heat exhaustion." 

Causes. — As stated in the description, it is caused by excessive heat. 

Symptoms. — The patient may be struck down and die within an hour. 
This form occurs chiefly in army life. In the early stage of ordinary cases 
there is a feeling of oppression and dizziness. If no attention is paid to these 
symptoms and the patient does nothing to relieve the heat, sudden un- 
consciousness comes on, sometimes preceded by convulsions. In other 
cases there are no convulsions but there is deep stupor with deep breathing 
and even snoring. The face is at first livid and later dark and the large blood- 
vessels of the neck and arms are swollen with blood. The temperature quickly 
rises very high, the average being between 105 and 107 degrees. The pupils 



198 THE PEOPLE'S HOME MEDICAL ^OOK. 

of the eyes may be smaller than usual or they may be very much enlarged. 
If the fever cannot be reduced and if the blood cannot be drawn away from the 
heart and lungs, death will be the result in from twelve to thirty-six hours. 
When the patient is getting better he sometimes has a relapse, or " set back," 
so that the greatest caution must be observed. The result of sunstroke de- 
pends upon the height and persistency of the fever. Many people die each 
year from sunstroke. 
TREATMENT.— 

Treatment for Heat Exhaustion. — For. heat exhaustion, or when the tem- 
perature is too low, rub the patient in hot water and after the bath apply hot 
applications about the body. Notice that this is the treatment only when 
the temperature is too low. 

Emergency Treatment for Sunstroke or " What to Do." — The treatment 
must be bold and vigorous. First, reduce the temperature by applying ice or 
cold water. Strip the patient, lay him on a canvas cot and then direct a 
stream of cold water upon his body, from a hose if possible. Rub actively 
and vigorously while applying the water. This brings the blood to the 
surface and relieves the internal organs and the head. Rub thoroughly and 
at the same time constantly apply cold watei" to the head. If convenient the 
patient may be put into a bath tub and the above treatment carried out. When 
the temperature begins to fall see that it does not fall too rapidly. If the pa- 
tient is robust and the veins are swollen, bleeding may be of benefit. Then 
follow with a normal salt injection. Have the patient remain in bed for 
several days. 

Caution, or " What Not to Do." — Do not lose time but get to work. Do 
not get excited. Do not give alcohol. 

Allopathic Treatment. — If the patient is constipated give citrate of mag- 
nesia in 4-dram doses to relieve him. If he is unconscious give a hypodermic 
injection of 1/6 grain of elaterium for the bowels. If it is necessary to stimu- 
late give strychnine but do not give alcohol. 

Homeopathic Treatment. — In connection with the above measures you 
may give the third dilution of Glonoin. Put 10 or 15 drops into half a glass 
of water and give 2 teaspoonfuls every half hour. This is for the beating 
arteries and throbbing head. 
PEOPLE'S HOME REMEDIES.— 

1. Essence of Ginger, Cold Water, Etc. — Put the patient in a sitting 
position and pour cold water freely upon the head. Into half a tumbler of 
water pour two or three tablespoonfuls of essence of ginger and have the 
patient drink it quickly. 

FALLING FITS. 
Epilepsy. 

Description. — This is an afifection of the nervous system marked by 
attacks of unconsciousness either with or withou-t convulsions. 

Symptoms. — A peculiar feeling called the " aura " goes over the patient 
just before the attack comes on. Then he utters a peculiar cry or scream. 
At the same time, in a wide spread attack, the muscles of the whole body 
become strongly contracted until they are in a stiff spasm. After the spasms 
relax there are alternate contractions and relaxations which throw the patient 
from side to side. He usually foams at the mouth and sometimes bites his 
tongue. The face changes color rapidly and finally the flush deepens into a 



DISEASES OF THE NERVOUS SYSTEM. 199 

livid purple. The attack lasts about two minutes and is -a terrible thing- to 
see. In the ordinary form there is little danger of death. The patient finally 
becomes dumb in action and speech. 

TREATMENT. — Bromide of potassium can be used under a doctor's di- 
rections. This must be continued for months and years and continued for 
three years after the patient is seemingly cured. 
PEOPLE'S HOME REMEDIES.— 

1. Oxide of Zinc and Stramonium Ointment. — A physician who ha? 
been very successful in curing epilepsy uses oxide of zinc. It should be taken 
three times a day. The first 8 days the dose is 1/2 grain ; then take 1-grain 
doses for the next 8 days and then use 1% grains until cured. It is well 
while under this treatment to rub the spine twice a day with stramonium 
ointment. The dose of oxide of zinc seldom has to be increased above li/^ 
grains. 

ST, VITUS' DANCE. 
Acute Chorea — Sydenhams Chorea. 

Description. — This is a disease chiefly affecting children. It is attended 
with irregular and involuntary contractions or twitchings of the muscles and 
these twitchings are sometimes limited to certain muscles. There is a remark- 
able liability to acute endocarditis, or heart disease. Seventy-nine per cent, 
of the cases are females. It occurs mostly between the ages of 5 and 15 vears. 

Causes. — It is due to a run down condition of the system. 

Symptoms. — In a mild case the speech is not seriously affected but the 
patient is restless, can't sit still, has " fidgets " and crying spells and some- 
times night terror. The patient has stomach trouble, aiemia, a changed 
disposition and is cross and irritable. In a week or more the jerky movements 
begin and the patient is awkward and upsets things at the table, etc. 

In the severe form the movements become general and the patient cannot 
go about or dress himself. The speech is affected and sometimes he cannot 
talk for days. It usually lasts from 8 to 10 weeks and children usually re- 
cover. Chronic chorea sometimes follows the acute kind but it is a rare 
affection. 
TREATMENT.— 

" What to Do." — Allow the patient to have rest and keep him from worry 
and excitement. Keep him home from school. Apply a hot pack to produce 
sleeping. 

" What Not to Do." — Do not allow an exceptionally bright child to over 
study between the ages of 5 and 15 years. 

Allopathic Treatment. — Give iron and arsenic if there is anemia (poor 
blood) and salicylates if the child is rheumatic. Arsenic may be given in the 
form of Fowler's solution of arsenic. For a child of 10 years give 3 drops 3 
times a day and gradually increase, 1 drop every day, until some pufiSness 
appears about the eyes, then stop its use. 

Homeopathic Treatment. — Give one tablet of the third trituration of Ar- 
senicum every 3 hours. 

If the patient is weak from a long sickness give the second dilution of 
China. Put 10 or 15 drops into half a glass of water and take a teaspoonful 
or two every hour to three hours. 

If the patient has menstrual troubles, prepare and give the third dilution 
of Pulsatilla in the same way. 



200 - THE PEOPLE'S HOME MEDICAL BOOK. 

PEOPLE'S HOME REMEDIES.— (Also see " Home Remedies for Neural- 
gia and Nervous Troubles.") 

1. Lady's Slipper. — Make a tea of Lady's slipper and give from 1 to 
2 ounces, 4 times a day. 

2. Blue Cohosh. — Make a tea of blue cohosh and give 3 or 4 times a 
day. This is especially good when the St. Vitus' dance is due to womb or 
menstrual troubles. 

3. Skullcap. — Drink freely of a tea made from skullcap. 

4. St. Johnswort. — Drink a tea made from St. Johnswort. This should 
be drank several times a day. 

5. Lettuce. — Eat plenty of lettuce when afflicted with St. Vitus' dance. 

HEREDITARY CHOREA OR ST. VITUS' DANCE. 
Huntington's Chorea. 
Description. — Fortunately, this affliction is rare. It is characterized bv 
irregular movements, disturbed speech and twitchings of the face, brow and 
scalp. 

First Symptoms. — There are twitchings of the muscles of the face, head 
and arms and there are also gesticulations. 

Treatment. — It is very hard to cure. Live an out-of-door life and take 
tonics and nerve sedatives. 

APOPLEXY. 

Causes. — This is caused by brittle arteries in the brain, which break be- 
cause of their filling- with blood or becoming cong-ested from any cause such 
as excitement, over work, over lifting, over eating or over stimulation. May 
be caused by injuries. 

Symptoms. — There is sudden dizziness, faintness and disturbed speech 
followed by coma or stupor. The face becomes flushed and dusky or, in very 
severe cases, it may be ashy pale. The pulse, which is slow and soft at first, 
becomes full and bounding. The breathing is slow and irregular an 3 is 
accompanied with snoring. The eyes are fixed and staring, the pupils vary^ing 
and generally unequal in size. The patient may have convulsions. He ttiay 
die very soon or he may partially recover. In many cases paralysis is noticed 
when he regains consciousness. 
TREATMENT.— 

Emergency Remedy or " What to Do." — Place the patient in a lying 
position, loosen the clothing, raise the head of the bed and apply ice or cold 
water to the head. Give a hot mustard bath. If the tongue draws back, put a 
towel or handkerchief over it and hold it forward. 

Caution or " What Not to Do." — Do not let the tongue draw back in the 
mouth and in applying water to the head, do not let it drip into the mouth 
or the patient may choke to death. 

Nursing and Diet. — In addition to what has beeh recommended there are 
other things you can do for the patient. As before directed, in applying water 
to the head, do not allow it to drip into the mouth for a few drops can choke a 
person in this condition as he is unable to swallow. Do not let the water 
drip on the neck or other parts of the body. If you have no ice bag you must 
change the cold water cloths often to keep them cold. The tongue gets very 



DISEASES OF THE NERVOUS SYSTEM. 301 

dry, especially when the mouth is open. Moisten it often but be careful about 
getting water into the ttiouth. If necessary the bowels should be kept open 
with injections or with salts. Salts can only be given after he has recovered 
enough to swallow. Usually the urine must be drawn and especially in old 
persons. It may dribble away but that will not be enough. If the patient 
is continually moving his hands over the region of the bladder and acts as 
though he were in pain, you had better draw the urine at once. This applies 
to any disease. 

The patient must have quiet and rest. Improvement is slow in this 
disease. Never talk about the patient's condition in his presence. In many 
cases he is able to partially understand even though seemingly unconscious. 
Bleeding may be useful in some cases. Regulate the diet. Time and nursing 
frequently work wonders even in the most desperate cases. 

ABSCESS OF THE BRAIN. 

Causes. — May come from inflammation of the middle ear, caries (death) 
of the bones of the nose or skull, infected skull wounds, infectious diseases, 
influenza, or erysipelas. 

Symptoms. — In acute cases there is high fever and the symptoms of 
meningitis. 

Treatment. — Operation if possible. 

LOSS OF SPEECH. 
Aphasia. 

The power of speech becomes impaired or arrested as a result of disease 
or injury of that part of the brain which controls speech. The speech may 
return if the disease is not too extensive. Good nursing and dieting are about 
all that can be done. 

LOSS OF VOICE. 
Aphonia. 
Loss of voice may be due to disease of the vocal cords, to diphtheria, 
or to some disease of the nervous system. 

STAMMERING. 

The treatment lies mostly with the patient. Speak slowly and distinctly 
and do not get excited. Go to a school for stammerers if you can. 
PEOPLE'S HOME REMEDIES.— 

1. Closed Teeth and Marking Time. — Practice reading aloud with the 
teeth closed and tap with the finger at every syllable you pronounce. This 
has proven effective in many cases. 

2. Proper Breathing. — A person does not stutter when singing because 
the lungs are full and inflated. Then keep the lungs well filled, take deep 
breaths, speak loudly and when there is a hesitation, stop instantly and take 
in another long breath before trying again. 

3. Speaking Slowly. — Stop when you stammer, wait awhile and then 
try again to say the word more slowly. 

TUMORS OF THE BRAIN AND ITS MEMBRANES. 
There are many kind^ of tumors of the brain. 



302 THE PEOPLE'S HOME MEDICAL BOOK. 

Symptoms. — Headache sometimes produces temporary loss of the mind. 
Next there is projectile vomiting which is a hurling forth of the material with 
force. There is dizziness, slowness of thought, mental failure, loss of speech 
and paralysis. 

Treatment. — Sometimes the tumor can be removed. Make the patient 
as comfortable as possible. 

GENERAL MENINGITIS. 

Description. — This is an inflammation of the membranes covering the 
brain and spinal cord. 

Causes. — May be caused by injury, bone disease or infection. 

Symptoms. — There is headache, a confused mind, delirium and convulsive 
attacks. 

Treatment. — Move the bowels with salts, apply cold to the head, rest in 
bed in a darkened room and have perfect quiet. If symptoms of pressure 
develop an operation will be necessary if it is possible. 

PARANOIA. 
Dementia Paralytica — Paresis — General Paralysis of the Insane. 

Causes. — Syphilis causes 75 per cent, of the cases. It is a sequel of that 
disease. Alcoholism and excessive sexual indulgence also, cause it. It is 
common among " rakes." This is a disease of middle life occurring most fre- 
quently between the ages of 30 and 50 years. Some cases seem to follow 
sunstroke and injury. 

Symptoms. — ^The patient seems to be nervously fatigued or mentally 
fagged. The temper is irritable and at times he takes offense easily. At 
times he is also very forgetful. Even though naturally tidy, he becomes sloven 
and careless. Though formerly kind, he becomes brutal to his family. His 
speech becomes indistinct and the pupils of the eyes act unevenly. He may 
have delusions, extravagant ideas. He may believe he is a great historical 
character or that he is a king or very rich. As brain disease progresses ho 
becomes mentally dull and frequently becomes emotional and laughs and 
cries without cause. He is depressed at times and exalted at other times. 
He may become frenzied with rage and commit a crime. Death usually come? 
in a bad case from the third to the sixth year. '^ 

Treatment. — Treatment can relieve but cannot cure. '■ 

LOCOMOTOR ATAXIA. 
Tabes Dorsalis — Posterior Spinal Sclerosis. 

Description. — This disease is characterized by incoordination of move- 
ment, loss of muscle sense, loss of the deep reflexes and impairment of station 
and gait. The most noteworthy loss of reflex is in the knee joint and iris. 
Males suffer more than females, ten to one. One half of the cases develop 
between the ages of thirty and forty and 80 per cent, occur between thirty and 
fifty years of age. 

Causes. — The most common cause is acquired syphilis. It rarely is the 
result of hereditary syphilis. It is the result of syphilitic diseases. Next to 
syphilis the cause is injury, such as a severe fall or blow on the spine. The 
primary lesion is in the posterior ganglia, posterior roots of the spinal cord, 



DISEASES OF THE NERVOUS SYSTEM. 203 

and in the cranial nerves and not in the posterior coKimns of the spinal cord 
as was once thought. 

SYMPTOMS. — The patient says that his feet feel muffled as if he had on 
a thick pair of socks. In other cases he notices that on arising at night he has 
difficulty in getting a proper purchase on the floor with his feet, or the floor 
may feel to him as though it were different from what it really is. It is hard 
for him to walk in the dark. 

Peculiar Gait. — The foot is raised awkwardly with an uncertain motion. 
The edge of the foot sometimes rests on the floor. If the light is poor the 
patient sometimes staggers and falls. 

Disturbance of Station. — The patient cannot stand steadily. If the eyes 
are closed or blindfolded, he sways so that he is in danger of falling. 

Other Symptoms. — There is total loss of the knee ierk when the tendon 
is tapped. The patient has pains and loss of sensibility. There are '.ightning 
pains in the legs which are darting and burning. There are tickling, pricking, 
creeping, sensations of heat and cold. In 80 per cent, of the cases the eyes 
fail to react to light and there may be other eye troubles. Owing to changes 
in the elbows, shoulders, hips and knees, the landmarks of these parts may be 
completely lost and there is often great swelling. In the secondary stage 
there is perforating ulcer of the foot. Recovery is not possible but it may 
remain stationary. If it comes from syphilis, proper remedies may check it, 
but they cannot cure it. 

TREATMENT. — If the syphilis cause is of recent date, give mercury. 
Iodide of potassium is the usual remedy but it must be usea under proper 
directions. For the twitching in the limbs give the bromides of sodium, pot- 
ash and ammonia in large doses. In some cases certain exercises, baths or 
electricity are good. 

ACUTE ANTERIOR POLIO MYELITIS. 

Description and Symptoms. — In this disease there is sudden loss of power 
in one or more of the limbs. Most commonly it is in the legs. Wasting of 
the muscles takes place immediatel5^ The acute disease is strictly one of 
child life and occurs most frequently during the first three years. 

Treatment. — Give the patient rest in a quiet and darkened room and 
doctor the conditions as they arise. The result is good so far as life is con- 
cerned but it is hard to tell how much the paralysis can be helped. Electricity 
may do some good. 

CHRONIC ANTERIOR POLIO MYELITIS. 

Symptoms. — This closely resembles the acute kind. The muscles are 
paralyzed and waste away. The outlook is grave. The future of the case 
may be determined somewhat by how rapidly it develops. When the disease 
is caused by injury the outlook is better. 

Treatment. — Have good surroundings, nutritious food, and fresh air and 
sunshine. Rub the paralyzed parts gently but not too much. 

BULBAR PARALYSIS. 
Description. — This affects the tongue, lips and larynx. There is shrinking 
of the tongue and lips. 

Causes. — Lesions in the lower back part of the brain. 

Ssmiptoms. — The disease usually begins with difficulty in moving the 



2>04 THE PEOPLE'S HOME MEDICAL feOOK. 

tongue. The patient is hardly able to say the letters " v," " n," " r," " f," and 
" 1." He speaks " through the nose " and chewing and swallowing become 
difficult. All conditions gradually get worse. The disease is usually fatal. 
Treatment. — Give tonics. Medicine does not do much good. 

LATERAL SCLEROSIS. 

Description. — The patient suffers from stiffness of the muscles of the 
Ifegs, with loss of power of motion and with great reflex irritability. 

Causes. — It may be caused by syphilis, injuries, or by suddenly taking 
eold as men do sometimes in washing sheep. 

Symptdms. — There are spasmodic contractions, or jerkings, of the rausples 
of the legs. There is difficulty in bending the knees and ankles and greater 
difficulty in raising the toes. The disease often lasts for 25 years. 

Treatment. — Treatment does not do much good. 

MYELITIS. 
(Transverse Kind.) 

Description. — This is an inflammatory process in the spinal cord. 

Symptoms. — There is pain in the back, numbness, and tingling in the legs. 
There is a terrible twitching or cramp-like contraction of the limbs. Loss 
of the powei of the legs may be the first symptom. There is paralysis of the 
bladdei and holding of the urine or else an inability to hold it. There is 
a band-like feeling around the abdomen. Sometimes the legs jerk terribly. 
A few cases may get well but many linger and finally die of some other trouble. 

Treatment. — The treatment does not do much good. Give good nursing 
and diet and draw the urine with a catheter if necessary. 

SPINAL MENINGITIS. 

Description. — This is an inflammation of the membranes of the spinal 
cord. 

Causes. — It is nearly always secondary to some other disease such as 
typhoid fever or acute articular rheumatism. 

Sjmiptoms. — There is pain, chills, and fever and it is soon noticed that 
the patient is stiff. After the thigh has been fixed at right angles to the 
trunk the patient's legscannot be bent at the knee. The muscles of the back 
and neck are very stiff. There is paralysis of the bladder and the patient 
is either unable to retain or unable to pass urine and feces. These symptoms 
must be watched for. 

Treatment. — Keep up the patient's strength and allow absolute rest on 
a soft bed. 

ACUTE ASCENDING PARALYSIS. 
Landry's Paralysis. 

This begins in the legs and passes rapidly Upward until it affects the 
muscles of the trunk and arms and finally causes death by the patient's 
being unable to breathe. The result depends upon the severity of the attack, 
the parts affected, and upon the condition of the heart and lungs. 

Treatment. — Allow rest and meet the indications. 



DISEASES OF THE NERVOUS SYSTEM. 205 

SHAKING PALSY. 
Paralysis Agitans. 

Description. — This is a chronic affection of the nervous system attended 
with weakness, tremors, and rigidity of the muscles and especially affects the 
hands and foreafms. 

C^use. — This is not known. More men than women are affected. 

Symptoms.— The hands and forearms tremble or shake almost continu- 
ously. As to the attitude, the head is bent forward, the back is bowed and 
the arms are held away from the body and are somewhat bent at the elbow. 

Treatment, — Live an out-door life and have plenty of quiet and rest, 
Give 1/100 grain of hyoscine from 1 to 3 times a day. The disease is incur- 
able but you can make the patient more comfortable and prolong life. 

NEURITIS. 

Description. — This is an inflammation or degeneration of a nerve. Peri- 
neuritis means inflammation around a nerve structure. If the fibres of the 
nerves are primarily aifected it is called parenchymatous neuritis. It is called 
interstitial neuritis when there is inflammation of the tissues surrounding and 
between the nerve fibres. 

Causes. — The causes are injury, diseases, alcohol, metallic poisons or 
gout. 

Syniptoms. — The symptoms vary very much in different cases. When 
there is a very mild attack, only a tingling sensation or a numbness may 
be felt. When it is more severe the tingling and prickling sensations are felt 
not only at the place where the trouble is but also far away from it at the end 
of the nerve. If the "disease is the result of pressure there is some loss of 
motion but not much pain. If it is the result of infection from a wound, pain 
is present and usually severe. If it continues there is a glossy skin and wast- 
ing of the muscle. 
TREATMENT.— 

Allopathic Treatment. — The part affected may be wrapped in lint heavily 
smeared with an ointment made of equal parts of ichthyol and lanolin, otitside 
of which is placed some oil silk to hold the moisture. In some cases hot 
poultices of flaxseed or cloths wrung out of hot water may be applied in the 
earlier stages to relieve the inflammation. If the pain is so. severe you cannot 
sleep you can use 5 grains of phenacetin 4 or 5 times a day. For the same 
purpose acetanilid may be used in the same doses or antipyrin may be used 
in slightly larger doses. If absolutely necessary, morphine may be used hypo- 
dermically for the pain. Place the parts at rest. If it is the arm it should be 
placed in a sling. After the acute stage you can take strychnine in doses 
of from 1/60 to 1/30 of a grain. Or, nux vomica may be used in 5 to 10-drop 
doses. These may be combined with /phosphorus and small quantities of 
quinine. Faradic electricify may be carefully applied but never so as to. pro- 
duce suffering. 

Homeopathic Treatment. — The medicines used are the second dilution 
of Aconite, the third dilution of Belladonna, the second dilution of Bryonia, 
the third trituration of Arsenicum and the sixth dilution of RhusTox. (Foi 
preparation and doses see " Homeopathic Medicines " in Nursing Depart- 
ment.) 
PEOPLE'S HOME REMEDIES FOR STITCH IN THE SIDE.— 

1. Mustard Poultices.-— The application of hot water or mustard poul'- 
tices will usually give relief. 



206 THE PEOPLE'S HOME MEDICAL BOOK. 

3. Laudanum, Sassafras, Etc. — Take an ounce each of laudanum and oil 
of origanum and an ounce-and-a-half each of oil of hemlock and oil of sassa- 
fras. Mix these together and rub thoroughly on the affected parts. 

3. Camphor. — Saturate a flannel cloth with spirits of camphor, place on 
the painful parts and cover with a dry cloth. 

4. Belladonna Plaster. — Apply a belladonna plaster. 

MULTIPLE NEURITIS. 
Polyneuritis — Peripheral Neuritis. 

Description and Causes. — This is a condition in which a large number of 
the peripheral (end) nerves of the body suffer from chronic inflammation as 
a result of the action of some toxic agent. These toxic agents may be derived 
from external or internal sources. The external toxics are alcohol, lead, ar- 
senic, copper, mercury, aniline, carbon monoxide and carbon bisulphide. The' 
internal sources are poisons developed in the various acute infectious fevers, 
as typhoid fever, small-pox, scarlet fever, influenza, pneumonia, diphtheria, 
dysentery, etc. The disease is most frequent between the ages of 20 and 50 
years. 

Symptoms. — The symptoms are fairly constant no matter what the cause. 
Alcoholic neuritis is the type most frequently met with. At the beginning 
there may be slight fever. The patient complains of tingling and numbness 
in the feet and fingers. In other cases there is dull pairi. Following these, 
weakness develops. The patient may be unable to move his hands or feet and 
" foot drop " or " wrist drop " develops. After a little time wasting of these 
parts takes place. Then there may be over sensitiveness of the parts affected. 
The symptoms may even be somewhat like those of locomotor ataxia. Some 
parts of the skin may suffer from excessive sweating and swelling and some- 
times the joints are swollen. The nerves of the head are also affected and 
the patient may squint. Poison from diphtheria is the most common internal 
cause and is called " diphtheria neuritis." It most frequently affects the 
muscles of the palate. This makes speech and swallowing difiScult. Some are 
paralyzed in all their extremities. Sometimes they cannot control the head. 

The chances for recovery are favorable in nearly every case unless the 
patient has been exposed to lead, arsenic or alcbhol for so long a time that 
the nerves cannot undergo regenerative change. Less pain and tenderness 
are the first symptoms of improvement. Recovery may take months. 

TREATMENT.— 

Allopathic Treatment. — Remove the cause such as lead or arsenic. Give 
to these patients from 20 to 30 grains of iodide of potassium 2 or 3 times a 
day. Alcohol must be stopped if taken to excess. Laxatives or purges are 
beneficial. Drink freely of water. Give baths, iron and arsenic for anemia, 
or poor blood. Carefully examine the heart and if necessary keep the patient 
lying down. Give salicylates if needed. 

Homeopathic Treatment. — The homeopathic medicines for this disease 
are the second dilution of Aconite, the third trituration of Arsenicum, the 
second dilution of Bryonia and the sixth dilution of Rhus Tox. (See " Home- 
opathic Medicines " in Nursing Department for preparation and doses.) 

CATALEPSY. 

This is a sudden loss of all voluntary moving power so quickly befalling 
all muscles that the different parts of the body remain in precisely the same 



DISEASES OF THE NERVOUS SYSTEM. 207 

position in which the attack finds them, thus making the patient appear like 
a statue. In itself, it is not fatal. 

Treatment. — Restore the tone of the system with tonics, etc, 

DELIRIUM TREMENS. 
Mania a Potu. 

This is really only an incident in the history of chronic alcoholism and 
results from the long continued action of the poison on the brain. A spree 
in a temperate person, no matter how prolonged, is rarely if ever followed 
by delirium tremens; but in the case of an habitual drinker a temporary 
excess is apt to bring on an attack. It sometimes develops in consequence of 
the sudden withdrawal of the alcohol. 

At the outset of the attack the patient is restless and depressed and sleeps 
badly, which causes him to take alcohol more freely. After a day or two the 
characteristic delirium sets in. The patient talks constantly and incoherently ; 
he is incessantly in motion and desires to go out to attend to some imaginary 
business. Hallucinations of sight and hearing develop. He sees objects in 
the room, such at rats, mice or snakes, and fancies they are crawling over his 
body. The terror inspired by these imaginary objects is great and has given 
the popular name " horrors " to the disease. The patients need to be watched 
constantly, for in their delusions they may jump out of the window or 
escape. 

In private practice recovery ■'takes place in a large proportion of the 
cases. 

Treatment. — Produce sleep and support the strength. In mild cases i/o 
dram of bromide of potassium combined with 10 drops of tincture of capsi- 
cum may be given every 3 hours. Hyoscine, 1/100 grain, can be given hypo- 
dermically. Careful feeding is the most important element in the treatment 
of these cases. Milk and concentrated broths should be given at stated 
intervals. (Extracts from Dr. Osier, one of the greatest physicians of the 
world.) 
PEOPLE'S HOME REMEDIES FOR DRUNKENNESS.— 

1. Thompson's Composition Tea. — It is claimed that Thompson's 
Composition Tea will cure drunkenness. Take hemlock bark, 1 pound; bay- 
berry bark, 2 pounds ; ginger root, 1 pound ; cloves, 3 ounces ; and cayenne 
pepper, 2 ounces; pulverize and mix well. Of this take half a teaspoonful 
with a teaspoonful of sugar and put into half a teacupful of boiling water. 
After it has stood a few minutes fill the cup with milk. Drink half of this 
upon arising in the morning and the rest just before meal time. 

3. Tonic and Stimulant. — A celebrated physician gives the following-: 
magnesia, 10 grains ; sulphate of iron, 5 grains ; peppermint water, 11 drams 
and spirits of nutmeg, 1 dram. This quantity should be taken twice daily. 
It is a great tonic and stimulant and has proven successful in many cases 
for which many are most thankful. 

3. Stramonium Leaves. — Give a tea made of stramonium leaves. It 
may be given in tea or coffee, if desired, without the knowledge of the patient. 
Will relieve the appetite for tobacco as well as liquor. 

4. Ammonia. — A teaspoonful or two of aromatic spirits of ammonia 
in a glass of water will aid in sobering the patient. May be repeated in 45 
minutes if necessary. 



208 THE PEOPLE'S HOME MEDICAL BOOK. 

5. Ginger and Pepper. — For delirium tremens force the patient to 
take strong coflfee or milk and give a tea made with ginger and pepper. 

6. Tincture of Capsicum. — Give the delirium tremen patient tincture 
of capsicum in teaspoonful doses. 

7. Bromo-Seltzer. — For drunkenness take a dose of bromo-seltzer and 
go to bed. 

INSANITY. 

" Insanity is a departure from the normal mental status of the individual 
and this departure is due to some diseased condition of the bfain or flervotts 
system. 

" It has been truly said that man is the product of his antecedents, multi- 
plied by his environments. 

" Mental abnorm_ality is always due to either imperfect or eccentric 
physical development, or to effects of inborn or acquired physical disease, 
or to injurious impressions, either anti-natal or post-natal, upon that delicate 
and intricate physical structure known as the human brain. Some physical 
imperfections more than others give rise to mental derangements. Some 
persons, more than others, when affected by bodily ailment, tend to aberated 
conditions of the mind. Some impressions more than others, are particularly 
unfortunate by reason of their corroding effects upon the brain tablets of a 
sensitive mind. To these natural defects and unnatural tendencies, we apply, 
in a general way, the term " The Insane Diathesis." This is a state of con- 
dition in mental pathology, corresponding to those diatheses so common in 
physical pathology, namely, the scrofulous, the cancerous, the scorbutic, the 
rheumatic, the gouty and the calculous. 

" The insane diathesis is a general term applying to all those conditions 
which tend to the inception and growth of mental unsoundness. This dia- 
thesis may be inherited or acquired. In the former case it may be compared 
to the scrofulous ; and in the latter, to the gouty diathesis. 

" Those who are born to become insane do not necessarily spring from 
insane parents, or from an ancestry having any apparent taint of lunacy in 
the blood but they do receive from their progenitors, oftentimes, certain im- 
pressions upon their mental and moral, as well as upon their physical being, 
which impressions, like iron moulds, fix and shape their subsequent destinies. 
Hysteria in the mother may develop the insane diathesis in the child. Drunk- 
enness in the father may impel epilepsy, or mania, or dementia, in the son. 
Ungovefned passions, from love to hate, from hope to fear, when indulged 
in overmuch by the parents, may unloose the furies of unrestrained madness 
in the minds of the children. Even untempered religious enthusiasm may 
beget a fanaticism that cannot be restrained within the limits of reason. 

" As the development of progress is slow and gradual ; so, likewise, is 
the development of degeneracy. As men attain high moral and intellectual 
achievements only through the effects of succeeding generations, so it seems 
but natural that the insane should oftentimes trace their sad humiliation 
and utter unfitness for the duties of life back through a tedious line of pas- 
sion unrestrained, of prejudice, bigotry, and superstition unbridled, of lust 
unchecked, of intemperance uncontrolled, of avarice unmastered. and of 
nerve resources wasted, exhausted, and made bankrupt before its time. 

" Here are dangers to the human race which potent drugs cannot avert. 
Here are maladies which medicines cannot cure. But the medical man, the 



DISEASES OF THE NERVOUS SYSTEM. 209 

conservator of public health, realizing the dangers which threaten his com- 
munity or state, may help, if he will, to parry those pathological blows 
which the present aims at the future ; and, by timely warnings and appeals 
to his clients of today, may save them for his own treatment, instead of con- 
signing them to an asylum where his own fees cease from doubling and the 
crazed ones are at rest." (Extracts from Seldon H. Talcott.) 

Causes of Insanity. — Insanity is either inherited or acquired. 

Inherited Insanity. — It may be inherited because of the high living, fast 
society and dissipation of the parents. Elbert Hubbard says of those who 
waste their substance upon a certain fashionable hotel air that they are apt 
" to have gout at one end, general paresis at the other and Bright's disease 
in the middle." 

Hereditary influence is also caused by drunkenness, lust, fep,r, mental 
anxiety, or even incompatibility if admitted to participation in the act of 
impregnation, and these will often set the seal of their presence in the shape 
of idiocy, imbecility, eccentricity or absolute insanity. 

Acquired Insanity. — Insanity is acquired by: (a) Imperfect nutrition, 
(b) By slight or almost imperceptible injuries to the brain, blows, and falls. 
(Stop boxing the ears of children.) (c) By those fears that are sometimes 
excited in the minds of young children for the purpose of government. 
(Such as ghost stories, etc.) (d) By overtaxing the undeveloped physical 
powers. (As by the overworking of the young in factories, etc.) (e) By 
unwise forcing of the mind in its immature or undeveloped stage. (Such 
as crowding children too hard at school.) (f) By premature or unnatural 
excitement of the sexual organs of the young. (Masturbation, etc.) (g) By 
suppression of the ambitions and powers, and tastes, and desires, of the en- 
thusiastic adolescent (youth). (h) By solitude. (Such as the life of a 
sheep herder which frequently causes melancholia which is a form of in- 
sanity.) 

History of Insanity. — The earliest reference to insanity is found in the 
bible. Mention of it will be found in Deuteronomy, Samuel, Ecclesiastes 
and Jeremiah. Hippocrates was the first physician who seemed to have any 
true conception of the real nature of insanity. 
Classification of Insanity According to Talcott. — 

1. Melancholia, which includes all forms of mental depression. 

8. Mania, which includes all forms of mental excitement. 

3. Dementia, which includes all forms of mental weakness or failure 
except idiocy and imbecility. 

4. General Paresis, which is a distinct form of mental disease possess- 
ing certain characteristics which demand that it shall be classified seperately. 
In this form you will find conditions of mental depression, mental excite- 
ment and mental weakness ; and in the course of this fatal disease you will find 
that it embodies and embraces some elements of all other forms of insanity. 
Definitions. — 

Delusion. — A delusion is a false belief. 

Hallucination. — This is a sensation without an object. Thus it is said 
that an individual who hears voices when no sound strikes the ear, has 
an hallucination. 

Illusion. — The victim may see a ball rolling on the floor and may fancy 
that it is an animal coming to destroy him. 

Melancholia. — This is characterized by great depression. 
14 



310 THE PEOPLE'S HOME MEDICAL BOOK. 

Causes of Melancholia. — Predisposition, physical disease, dissipation, 
work and worry, shock from sudden loss of friends or fortune, brooding, 
disorders of faith, solitude. 

Forms of Melancholia. — Simple, acute, sub-acute ; chronic ; melancholia 
with stupor, with agitation, with resistance; acute delirious melancholia and 
hypochondrical melancholia. 

Mania. — This means a raving madness. 

Causes of Mania. — Loss of property, mental anxiety, over-work, ill health, 
injury to the brain, sunstroke, insufficient sleep, etc. 

Forms of Mania. — 

1. Several forms; namely, acute, sub-acute (paranoia) and chronic. 

2. Special forms ; acute delirious, recurrent, periodic and circular. 

3. Peculiar forms which are named from supposed causation as from 
blows, masturbation, syphilis, puerperal fever, hysteria, climacteric, tuber- 
cular, etc. 

4. Disputed form.s such as monomania and moral mania. 

. 5. Forms such as dipsomania, cretomania, nymphomania in women, 
satyriasis in men, kleptomania, pyromania, etc. 

Paranoia. — The person affected is called a paranoiac. He has delusions 
of persecution or of ambition, grandeur, etc. 

Dementia.-^This means strictly " out of mind " or without mind. In 
dementia the faculties are simply enfeebled. In idiocy and imbecility they 
are imperfect. 

Idiocy. — This is a congenital absence of both cerebral and mental power. 

Imbecility. — This means a checked or arrested development. 

General Paresis. — This formidable and fatal disease is a cosmopolitan 
type of all modern insanity and represents to the fullest degree the effects of 
toil, worry and intemperance in every shade and form. It is a deep seated, 
far reaching, intractable scourge which fastens its fangs upon the matured 
brains of its victims and rarely, if ever, yields its hold. 

Causes of General Paresis. — There are .comparatively few cases of gen- 
eral paresis where the causes may not be traced to over work in the field of 
worry, wine, and women. This disease usually develops between the ages 
of 25 and 50 years. 
TREATMENT FOR INSANITY.— 

No care or toil ; soft, elastic and comfortable beds and pleasant, cheerfui 
and sunshiny surroundings. 

Preventive Treatment. — Avoid the causes. 

" Bright surroundings, pleasant associations, stimulating encouragements, 
abundant food of the best and plainest quality, fresh air, and active exercise 
in the clear sunlight, together with the simple direction, not forcing, of the 
mental faculties, will, in the course of patient time, produce from even poor 
stock such a robust and cultured race as to be the astonishment of those 
who furnish and mould the material." 



CONSTITUTIONAL DISEASES. 



CHRONIC RHEUMATISM. 

Description and Sjrniptoms. — This is a low grade of inflammation of the 
structures about the larger joints which results in pain, soreness, stiffness and 
disability of the parts and these are the main symptoms. ^ 

TREATMENT.— 

Care and Prevention. — A person with rheumatism needs to be very care- 
ful of his habits. Flannel should be worn 9 months in the year. Care should 
be taken when wet to change the wet clothing as soon as you stop moving. 
Yon should not sweat and then sit down to cool off. You must not check 
the perspiration. When sweating, do not go into a cool room or sit down 
in the shade. One with rheumatism should not sleep on the ground floor 
as the bed is very likely to be damp. It is better to sleep up-stairs. Do 
not sleep in a bed that has not been slept in for weeks or months without 
airing. " Spare beds," such as you get when you go visiting, are not good 
for one with rheumatism or for any one else. All sleeping rooms should be 
well aired and dry. The same applies to the bed coverings. These little 
things count for much if you value your health as you should. 

Local Treatment. — Fifty' per cent, ichthyol ointment should be rubbed 
into the joints twice daily and may be alternated with chloroform liniment. 
Chloroform liniment consists of 4 drams of tincture of Belladonna, 3 drams 
of aconite, and 3 drams of chloroform. In other instances iodine ointment, 
diluted one-half with lanolin, ^may be used. Wear warm flannel next to the 
skin. 

Springs and Baths. — Some of. these do much good for those who can 
afford them. Among others there are good ones at Hot Springs in Arkansas, 
Virginia, South Dakota, Banff in Canada, Bath in England and in Michigan 
at Mt. Clemens, Battle Creek and Alma and in Wisconsin at Waukesha, etc. 
Turkish baths are sometimes beneficial. 

Allopathic Treatment. — Take 5 grains of salicylate of soda 4 times a 
day. Iodide of potash may be taken in the same doses or it may be mixed 
with blood compounds composed of herbs. 

Homeopathic Treatment. — The medicines used are the third dilution of 
Belladonna, the second dilution of Bryonia and the sixth dilution of Rhus 
Fox. (For preparation and dose see " Homeopathic Medicines " in Nursing 
Department.) 

PEOPLE'S HOME REMEDIES FOR VARIOUS KINDS OF RHEU- 
MATISM.— 

1. Celery. — A lady in New York writes that an eminent physician oi 
her state has achieved quite a reputation for his success in treating cases of 
chronic rheumatism. His remedy is nothing more nor less than the com- 
mon garden celery. Boil some celery in water until it is quite soft and 
let the patient drink freely of the liquor three or four times a day. It is 
also beneficial when useid as a food. Those suffering from rheumatism ought 

an 



313 THE PEOPLE'S HOME MEDICAL BOOK. 

not to despair of a cure until they have tried this simple but effective remedy, 
3. Whiskey and Vinegar, — For painful joints apply equal parts of 
whiskey and vinegar. 

3. Cucumbers. — Put some full-grown cucumbers into a pot over a slow 
fire ; add a little salt and leave over the fire for an hour. Press the juice from 
the cucumbers, bottle tightly and place in the cellar for a week. Wet a 
flannel cloth with this liquid and apply to the painful parts. 

4. Eggs, Vinegar and Turpentine. — For external use put 3 eggs into 
a pint of vinegar, shake well, and add Y^ pint of turpentine. 

5. Baking Soda» — Take 1 even teaspoonful of common baking- soda in 
a glass of cold water 3 times a day for 3 months. A lady living in Boston 
writes, " This treatment was ordered for myself by two doctors at the Carney 
Hospital, South Boston, Mass., when my arm was so bad that I could not 
get it to my head, and it cured me." 

6. Cayenne Pepper and Alcohol. — Let a quarter of a pound of cayenne 
pepper stand for 10 days in a pint of alcohol and you will have one of the 
best liniments ever used for rheumatism. , 

7. Sweet Oil and Saltpeter. — In case of inflammatory rheumatism add 
a pint of sweet oil to half an ounce of pulverized saltpeter and bathe the 
affected parts. 

8. Liniment. — To 1 pint of vinegar add % pint oi turpentine and into 
this break an egg, shell and all. Rub on the parts several times a day. A 
lady writes that this cured a friend of inflammatory rheumatism. 

9. Salicylate of Soda. — Have some salicylate of soda put up in 5- 
grain capsules and take one capsule in water 4 times a day. This is much 
used by doctors for chronic rheumatism. Do not take it long enough to 
affect the stomach or heart. 

10. Bathing Drops. — Take 8 teaspoonfuls of cayenne pepper and 1 
ounce each of hemlock oil, gum myrrh and pulverized gum guaiacum. Shake 
well together and bottle for use. This is good for rheumatic pains or pains in 
the head, stomach or elsewhere. B'athe the parts night and morning. 

11. Potatoes.— A lady living in France sends us a treatment which 
she says has cured many cases of sciatica. Boil a good-sized potato in a 
quart of water. Before going to bed bathe the affected parts in this water 
as hot as can be borne. Then mash the potato and bind on as a poultice. 
In the morning again heat the water, which should have been saved, and 
bathe the parts again. This treatment frequently cures in a few days but 
m some cases it may take several weeks. 

12. Blue Flag, Etc. — For sciatica take 15 drops of the fluid extract of 
blue flag twice a day in a little water and three times a day rub thoroughly into 
the back part of the thigh a liniment made of equal parts of iodine and 
aqua ammonia. 

13. Sweating Treatment. — In cases of acute rheumatism the first thing 
Is to produce sweating. The warm vapor bath may be used for this purpose 
or the patient may be placed in a warm bed with bottles of hot water or ears 
of boiled corn around him. He should also drink freely of warm teas such 
as catnip, sage, pennyroyal or flaxseed. 

14. Poultices and Fomentations. — If the Joints are swollen and painful, 
apply either warm or cold fomentations of lobelia and hops. Or hops and 
stramonium leaves; or, poultices of bran or flaxseed or rye meal. After 



CONSTiTUTlONAL DISEASES. 813 

warm poultices are removed the parts should be covered with cotton batting 
or flannel. , 

15. Stramonium Leaves.— Bruise some fresh stramonium leaves, mois- 
ten with a little water and apply to the swollen or painful joints. Renew 
3 or 4 times a day. This is recommended by both physicians and patients. 

16. Sulphur. — Sprinkle some finely pulverized sulphur on a piece of 
flannel and bind on the limb with the sulphur next to the skin, then cover 
with cotton batting to keep the air away. 

17. Hot Water Cloths. — Upon the first symptoms of rheumatism apply, 
thoroughly and persistently, cloths wrung out of hot water. 

18. Camphor, Ammonia, Etc. — Take % ounce of camphor, % ounce of 
ammonia, 1/2 ounce of sulphuric ether and % pint of alcohol and apply ex- 
ternally by rubbing on the parts 3 or 3 times a day. This does not soil 
the clothing. 

19. For Rheumatism, Etc. — Balsam tolu, gum guaiacum, gum hemlock 
and gum myrrh, of each, coarsely powdered, 2 ounces ; oil of hemlock. 3 
ounces ; oil of wintergreen, 2 ounces ; and alcohol, 1 gallon ; mix, and allow 
them to steep for 2 weeks, frequently shaking. The dose is 1 drajn or more 
in half a wineglassful of sweetened water. Besides rheumatism, this is also 
good for flatulent colic, acid stomach and water brash. 

20. Blue Flag. — For rheumatism take blue flag, either alone or in com- 
bination. The dose of the tincture is from 10 to 20 drops and of the powder 
from 5 to 10 grains. 

21. For Chronic Rheumatism. — Take 1 pint of whiskey and 1 dram 
each of cimicifugin, anthroxylin and apocynim. The dose is 1 tablespooriful 
3 times a day. 

22. Black Cohosh. — For acute and chronic rheumatism use from 5 to 
10 drops of tincture of black cohosh every 2 to 4 hours. This is. also a great 
remedy for womb troubles such as dysmenorrhea, leucorfhea, etc. 

23. Blue Cohosh. — Blue cohosh is good for rheumatism of the small 
joints. The dose of the tincture is % dram 3 times a day. 

24. Queen of the Meadow. — A tea made from queen of the meadow is 
good for rheumatism from kidney troubles. The dose is 2 to 4 ounces 4 
times a day. 

25. Prickly Ash Berries and Poke Berries.— Prickly ash berries and 
poke berries, in the form of tincture or fluid extract, are very good for chronic 
rheumatism and tertiary syphilis. The dose is from % to 1 dram. 

26. Lamp Oil,- Skunk's Oil and Red Pepper. — For chronic rheumatism 
take 2 ounces of skunk's oil, the same quantity of cheap lamp oil and 1 tea- 
spoonful of red pepper ; shake well together and bathe with a piece of flannel 
dipped into this mixture 

37. For Chronic Rheumatism. — Mix thoroughly % ounce of the finest 
turkey rhubarb and 1 ounce of carbonate of magnesia. Keep this well corked 
in a glass bottle. The dose for chronic rheumatism is 1 teaspoonful in milk 
and sugar the first thing in the morning. Repeat until cured. A lady in 
Birmingham, Alabama, says she has tried this with success. 

28. Lemon Juice. — The juice of 2 lemons taken in half a glass of 
water before each, meal is a good remedy for rheumatism. 

29. Sun Baths. — Take sun baths for rheumatism.

MUSCULAR RHEUMATISM. 

In this disease the muscles are stiff and sore. 
TREATMENT.— 

Allopathic Treatment. — Have the urine examined and if there is too 
much acid in it give from 10 to 20 grains of bicarbonate of potassium in 
water 3 or 4 times a day. In some cases common baking soda will do. 
Salicylate of soda is also good and may be taken 3 times a day in from 10 
to 15-grain doses. 

Homeopathic Treatment. — The medicines are the third dilution of 
Belladonna, the second dilution of Byronia, or the sixth dilution of Rhus 
Tox. (See " Homeopathic Medicines " in Nursing Department for prepara- 
tion and dose.) 

PEOPLE'S HOME REMEDIES.— (See home remedies under "Chronic 
Rheumatism," also under " Lumbago and Weak Back.") 

1. Blue Flag and Gin.— Buy five cents worth of blue flag root, let it 
stand in 1 pint of gin for 24 hours, and take a tablespoonful 3 times a day. 

Physician's Remarks. — This acts on the disordered liver and the blood. 

2. Smartweed Tea. — Bathe the parts thoroughly with a strong tea 
made of smartweed. 

3. Baking Soda. — Every four hours give half a teaspoonful of common 
baking soda. 

LUMBAGO. 

Description and Symptoms. — This is muscular rheumatism of the back, 
or loins. It is very painful and occurs chiefly in working men. It comes 
on suddenly and in severe cases it " downs " the patient, who may be un- 
able to turn in bed or to rise from the sitting posture. The pain shoots 
through the muscles of the back like lightning. 

TREATMENT. — Allow rest, apply hot fomentations on the painful parts 
and wear warm clothes when well. Morphine may have, to be given for the 
pain in some cases. Keep the bowels open. 

Homeopathic Treatment. — Take the sixth dilution of Rhus Tox., third 
trituration of Tartar Emetic, third dilution of Belladonna or the second 
dilution of Bryonia. (For preparation and dose see " Homeopathic Medi- 
cines " in Nursing Department.) 

PEOPLE'S HOME REMEDIES FOR LUMBAGO AND WEAK BACK.— 

1. Smartweed, Wormwood, and Vinegar. — Apply hot fomentations of 
smartweed, wormwood, or vine[;ar and hops. 

2. Origanum. Wormwood, Camphor and Turpentine. — ^Take an ounce 
each of oil of origanum, wormwood, gum camphor and turpentine. Put 
into a bottle and fill with alcohol. This is a fine liniment for a weak back. 

3. General Liniment. — Take alcohol, spirits of camphor, aqua ammonia, 
tincture of aconite and chloroform, of each 2 ounces and spirits of nitrous 
ether, six ounces ; mix, and keep well corked. This is an excellent liniment 
for backache, also for sprains, pains and bruises. This should not be taken 
internally. 

4. Turpentine and Kerosene. — Rub with turpentine or equal parts of 
turpentine and kerosene. (Also see " Liniments.") 



I 



CONSTITUTIONAL DISEASES. 215 

STIFF NECK. 
Torticollis. 

Treatment. — Allow the parts to rest and apply a belladonna or a mus- 
tard plaster. Chloroform liniment is good and so is equal parts of chloral 
and camphor. 

Homeopathic Treatment — Use the third dilution of Belladonna, the 
second dilution of Byronia, the second dilution of Aconite, or the sixth 
dilution of Rhus Tpx. (For preparation and dose see " Homeopathic Medi- 
cines " in Nursing Department.) 

GOUT. 
Podagra. 

Description. — In this disease there are deposits in the joints and sur- 
rounding tissues. The joint of the big toe is very commonly the most afifected. 

Causes. — The precise cause is unknown. Heredity, mode of life as to 
exercise and mental labor, high living, drinking, and age have much to do 
with it. Commonly, it does not develop until after the thirtieth year of 
age. Abuse of alcohol, over eating, and metal poisoning are among the 
causes. 

Symptoms. — The attack usually consists of a sudden onset of sharp 
pain and inflammation of the ball of the big toe. The pain is very severe 
and stabbing, the part swells rapidly and the skin is red and hot. It usually 
develops after midnight. Though the inflammation is great there is never 
the formation of pus. The acute form is followed by little disability in the 
part after the attack. 

TREATMENT. — Colchicine, iodine and the salicylates may be given in 
proper doses by a doctor. For acute attacks, wine of colchicine root, in 20 
to 40-drop doses may be given every 6 to 13 hours. Unload the bowels first 
with from 10 to 20 grains of compound extract of colocynth. . You can also give 
one dose of extract of hyoscyamus. The dose is from 1 to 2 grains. 

A good lotion is the following: soda, 4 ounces; belladonna liniment, 
4 ounces; tincture of opium, 1% ounces, and water, 8 ounces. Equal parts 
of this and hot water should be used to saturate wool which has been 
rolled around the joint and the dressing should be changed every 4 hours. 

Nursing and Diet. — Drink plenty of water. Exercise in the open air; 
golf is good. Do not use sweet wines, fats or rich foods. 

PEOPLE'S HOME REMEDIES.— 

1. Saleratus and Stramonium Leaves. — After holding the foot in warm 
saleratus water for 15 or 20 minutes, apply a poultice of stramonium leaves. 
This treatment will usually be found beneficial. 

2. Hot Bran Poultices, — A warm poultice made of vinegar and bran 
or weak lye and bran will often give relief. 

3. Vinegar and Salt. — ^Take some vinegar and put in all the salt it 
will dissolve. Apply with a soft flannel, rub with the hand, and dry by the 
fire. Bathe for 15 minutes 4 times a day. As improvement proceeds the 
number of daily applications may be diminished. 

4. Raw Onions. — Eat a raw onion every morning for breakfast. It 
may be eaten with salt and vinegar if preferred. 



ai« THE PEOPLE'S HOME MEDICAL BOOK. 

OBESITY. 
Fatness — Corpulence — Adiposity. 

TREATMENT. — Poke root berries may be given in tablet form but you 
must watch their effect. 

Diet. — Exclude all sugars and sweet articles and all fat and richly 
prepared food. Give lean meat and vegetables which are bulky but contain 
little starch. 

The following may be permitted — starch, lettuce, string beans, spinach, 
cabbage, cauliflower and a limited amount of tomatoes. 

The following should be excluded — potatoes in large amounts, bread, 
peas, beans, and alcoholic drinks. If necessary order a mqre rigid diet. 
Do not allow all the food he desires but let the patient suffer a little from 
hunger. The following may aid in selecting a diet. 

Breakfast. — Three ounces of lean meat, 1 ounce of bread without butter, 
and a cup of tea or coffee sweetened with saccharin. Use no milk or sugar 

Early Luncheon. — Eat a single soft-boiled egg with an ounce of bread. 

Dinner. — Cup of clear soup, 2 ounces of fresh or salt fish and after this 
3 or 3 ounces of lean meat. Also small quantities of the vegetables permit- 
ted may be taken. Dessert — An apple, orange, pear or grape fruit. 

Afternoon Luncheon. — Glass of milk or a cup of tea with a thick water 
cracker. 

Supper. — Three ounces of lean meat, lettuce with oil or vinegar, celery, 
and 2 'ounces of bread, or zweibach, or crackers. 

BED TIME.— Biscuit and glass of milk. 

SUGAR DIABETES. 
Diabetes Mellitus, 

There are large quantities of urine passed and it contains sugar. There 
is thirst, excessive appetite, and nutrition is impaired and in some cases 
the patient steadily becomes emaciated, or thin. The presence of glucose 
in the urine does not necessarily mean that the person is afiflicted with dia- 
betes. The other conditions mentioned must also be present. The disease 
is much more common in Europe than in the United States. 

Causes. — The cause is not yet definitely known. 

Symptonis. — The symptoms vary greatly in different cases. The dis- 
ease may exist for some time before the pa,tient suffers very much. Gen- 
erally, as the disease continues the patient notices that he passes urine more 
frequently and in larger quantities. He develops more or less thirst and 
loses sexual desire and power. Later he begins to feel languid and lazy. 
He is usually constipated and an excessive appetite is developed. The 
thirst, appetite, and loss of strength and flesh are usually in proportion to 
the quantity of the urine passed and the amount of sugar in it. When the 
patient passes much urine the tongue becomes glazed, dry, and raw in ap- 
pearance. Sore throat and thrush may develop. The skin is dry and harsh 
and the hair brittle and without lustre. The pulse is feeble and the tem- 
perature below normal. The first symptoms of the disease may be re- 
peated crops of boils or carbuncles. The stomach troubles are very annoying 
and depend upon the excessive eating and drinking. Extreme constipation is 
also often a troublesome feature. The disease is most fatal in persons under 
twenty-five years of age and may destroy life in a few weeks. 



CONSTITUTIONAL DISEASES. 217 

TREATMENT. — Drugs have a narrow limit in the treatment of this dis- 
ease and especial care should be given to the diet. Keep the bowels open. 
Give vichy water in large quantities and 20 or 30 grains of soda may be 
given every 2 or 3 hours dissolved in vichy water. Opium diminishes the 
quantity of sugar. The deodorized form of opium is generally the best. 
Give 14 grain, one, two or three times a day to begin with and gradually 
increase if necessary. In some instances from % to i/4 grain of morphine is 
good and in other instances from ^ to 1 grain of codeine as a beginning dose 
is good. 

Nursing and Diet. — Much can be done for the control of this disease 
by proper attention to exercise and regulation of the diet. Sugars must 
not be eaten. Both salt and fresh meat (excepting liver), butter, cheese 
and the various oils and fats may be used. Fresh vegetables such as lettuce, 
spinach, dandelion, cabbage, cauliflower, brussels sprouts, string beans, 
celery, water cress, tomatoes, onions, cucumbers, etc., may all be eaten. 
Olives and the various kinds of pickles and particularly all the nuts, except 
chestnuts or nuts containing too much starch, may also be a part of the diet. 
Oatmeal gruel may be eaten for a week or two and then the patient should 
return to other foods for a time. Tea, coiifee and cocoa should not be 
sweetened. 

, The bread should be made in the following manner. Mix 2 ounces of 
dried cocoa powder with a little water containing a small quantity of 
German yeast, make into a sort of paste and put in a warm place for half an 
hour or longer. Add 2 ounces aleuronat, 1 beaten egfr and a small quantity 
of water in which a little saccharin has been dissolved. Mix all until a dough 
is formed. Divide into cakes and bake in a moderate oven for 20 or 30 
minutes. 

Carefully avoid sweet fruits such as melons and grapes and those vege- 
tables which contain a very large amount of starch and sugar. Rice, sweet 
potatoes, beets, beans, peas and carrots contain sugar and starch and should 
not be eaten. Potatoes are the best form of starch which can be eaten by 
the patient with sugar diabetes. ' 
PEOPLE'S HOME REMEDIES.— 

1. Bugleweed and Unicom Root. — Keep the bowels open .with some 
mild cathartic, such as rhubarb, and drink frequently of a tea made of equal 
parts of bugleweed and unicorn root. 

2. Diet. — Eat nothing except beef and bread made from gluten flour. 
3- Ergot.-^A noted French physician used the fluid extract of ergot in 

small teaspoonful doses three times a day. 

DIABETES INSIPIDUS. 

Description. — In this disease the patient passes a large quantity of water 
but with no sugar. The disease is more common in males than in females 
and is more common under the age of thirty years. 

Symptoms. — There is a very excessive flow of urine. Then there is 
constant thirst, a dry mouth, and a very dry and wrinkled looking skin. 
Manv cases recover from this disease. 

Treatment. — Drug treatment is unsatisfactory. Care and attention 
should be given to the stomach, liver, bowels and kidneys so that they can 
do good work. 



SKIN DISEASES. 

(Including Tumors, Cancers, Carbuncles, Boils, Etc.) 



TUMORS AND CANCERS. 
Sarcoma — Carcinoma — Sarcomata — Carcinomata. 

A tumor is a neoplasm, that is, a new growth. It originates from pre- 
existing tissues, except when they are meta-static (moving). Tumors are 
benign and malignant. A benign tumor is usually composed of tissues re- 
sembling those in which it originates. A malignant tumor usually consists 
of tissues widely different from those in which it originates. The kinds of 
tumors are: fibrous, fatty, cartilaginous, osseous or bony, muscular, vas- 
cul' i", vascular or erectile, nerve and lymphatic. 

Cancers and Malignant Growths. — If an operation is to be performed 
it should be performed early. Tumors in the breast should be carefully 
watched. An injury will make them grow faster. Injury causes many of 
them to become malignant. If they are all taken out early the result is 
good. The trouble is that people wait too long. I do not believe in opera- 
tions unless they are absolutely necessary but when they are necessary, the 
sooner they are performed, the better. 

Cancer of the womb or of the lip should be operated on early. Cancci 
of the lip is frequently caused by the pipe and especially by a hot pipe. Can- 
cer in the throat, and oftentimes on the tongue, does not give such good 
results from operation. 

Do not let every physician use the X-Ray on you for tumors or canCers. 
Some are helped but many are terribly injured. Only an expert should 
use this for any growth. 

Technically speaking, medicines do not yet cure cancers though many 
so-called cancers are cured. For these, a number of good home remedies 
are given* 

PEOPLE'S HOME REMEDIES FOR CANCERS, TUMORS AND 
ULCERS.— 

1. Egg, Soot and Arsenic. — Mix the white of an egg with wood soot 
to make a paste; add 10 grains of arsenic and of this make a plaster and 
apply to the cancer. When it breaks or is killed, apply a slippery elm poul- 
tice and keep on until all is removed and the sore is healed. A man living 
near Zanesville, Ohio, has removed a number of cancers from various people 
with this plaster and this receipt was obtained from a relative of the man 
who has been so successful with it. 

Physician's Remarks. — In using arsenic you must watch its effects very 
carefully. 

2. Poke Root Poultice. — Roast some poke root in hot ashes until soft, 
then mash and make a poultice with hot water. This is not only good for 
tumors but is a most excellent application for caked breasts. 

3. Sheep Sorrel. — An old Indian doctor living in Oregon has been 
very successful in treating cancer by bruising sheep sorrel upon brass and 
applying as a poultice as long as the patient tan bear it. He alternates this 

218 



SKIN DISEASES. ' 219 

with a bread and milk poultice but always leaves the sorrel on as long as 
possible. This treatment is continued until the cancer is drawn out by 
the roots. The writer knows of two persons who were cured in this manner 
after their physicians had pronounced a cure impossible. It is also well to 
drink a tea made of the sheep sorrel. 

4. Wild Parsnip. — Take the common wild parsnip roots, simmer on 
the stove till thick like paste, spread on a .piece of chamois skin, and apply 
to the cancer. The man sending us this recipe says the cancer will come 
out by the roots and the sore may then be healed with any good ointment. 

5. Red Clover Blossoms. — The extract of red clover blossoms has been 
used by physicians to cure many cancers. It thoroughly cleanses the blood 
of its impurities and may be used for cancer of the stomach as well as on 
the surface. Instead of using the extract you can make a tea of clover 
blossoms and drink of it freely. 

6. Egg and Salt. — Take the yolk of an egg and stir in salt as long as 
it will receive it. Mix this with the white of the egg to form a salve. 
Twice a day put a part of this on some sticking plaster and apply to the 
cancer. 

7. Beeswax, Lard, Verdigris and SnufF. — Melt 1 ounce of beeswax, 
add 1% pounds of lard, and stir in 1 ounce of verdigris and l^ pound of 
Scotch snuflF and apply as a plaster. Good for cancers, tumors and ulcers. 

8. Poke Root. — Apply a plaster made from the dried juice of the leaves 
of the common poke root. Many cures are reported as the result of the 
application of poke root. 

ABSCESS. 

Description. — An abscess is a circumscribed collection of pus (matter). 

Causes. — Abscesses are usually caused by the presence of pus germs 
in the tissues. 

Symptoms of Acute Abscess. — There is local swelling and pain and 
frequently a chill or a gradual rise of temperature. Finally the parts soften 
and the pus reaches the surface. 

TREATMENT. — Painting with tincture of iodine sometimes helps. Use 
hot fomentations as soon as there is pus. In some places there is great 
danger in delay, especially when the abscess is near a joint. To bring it 
to a head use a bread and milk poultice with a little catnip added ; or, a 
flaxseed, corn meal or slippery elm poultice. For an adult from % to 1 tea- 
spoonful of laudanum may be put into the poultice if there is much pain. 

How to open an Abscess. — Use a knife that has been placed in boil- 
ing water for at least five minutes. Wash the parts thoroughly with a 
linen or gauze cloth dipped into water that has been boiled. Some anti- 
septic should be added to it if you have it. Dp not squeeze the abscess 
muc^i. Syringe it with hot water or an antiseptic and a clean syringe. 
You can put 15 or 20 drops of carbolic acid into a cup of water and syrmge 
with this. Use antiseptics like listerine, etc., if you have them, but boiled 
water will do. After you have thoroughly cleansed the abscess, put some 
absorbent cotton on it, cover it over with a little gauze, and fasten with ad- 
hesive plaster; or, if you do not have these things, use carbolized salve on 
linen, or even salt water will do, and cover up. You must take this care and 
especially when the abscess is located near a joint or on the neck. Most of 
the common abscesses get well after opening, with little treatment, but 



220 THE PEOPLE'S HOME MEDICAL BOOK. 

they often leave a bad scar. An abscess under the jaw must be carefully 
opened because there are so many blood vessels in that region, 
PEOPLE'S HOME REMEDIES.— 

1. Flaxseed and Bread and Milk Poultices. — An abscess may be dravirn 
to a head by poulticing with flaxseed, or bread and hot milk; or, hot water 
compresses may be used. 

Physician's Remarks. — Local applications for an abscess, to draw it 
to a head, if they are to be of any benefit must possess heat, moisture, and 
some drawing power. Something like laudanum or poppy heads is fre- 
quently needed to relieve the pain. The above remedies have heat, mois- 
ture and some drawing power. 

2. Fomentations. — Apply fomentations of marshmallow. chamomile 
flowers, poppji- heads or hemlock leaves. 

Physician's Remarks. — Poppy heads and chamomile flowers relieve the 
pain and marshmallow allays the inflammation. 

3. Iodine. — Paint the affected parts with iodine and repeat once a 
day until a cure is affected. 

Physician's Remarks. — This is a good remedy when applied early. 

4. Tomatoes. — Boil some tomatoes and thicken with meal or bran. 
Apply to the abscess and keep on warm for two days. 

Physician's Remarks. — This poultice has moisture, the corn meal has 
heat and the tomatoes contain an acid which is astringent and helps to draw. 
The word astringent is frequently used in medicine. It means the power 
to check discharges, whether of blood, mucus or any other secretion. As- 
tringents act by contracting the tiny blood vessels and secreting orifices. The 
chief astringents are sugar of lead, nitrate of silver, tannic acid (tannin), 
gallic acid, sulphate of zinc, kino calectin, dilute mineral acids, and alum. 
Tea contains tannin and is therefore an astringent. Oak bark is also an 
astringent. 

5. Diet and General Treatment. — There is no objection to the use of 
poultices such as ground flaxseed, slippery elm, bread and milk and such 
like, during the forming stages of an abscess, but they should never be used 
in case of a fully matured and discharging abscess. Washing with warm 
water and castile soap and the use of simple dressings are best. In many 
cases a nourishing diet is strictly demanded together with such other means 
as will tend to strengthen the system ; but when' an abscess occurs in a 
robust person, with a predisposition to inflammatory diseases, the diet 
should be restricted to the simplest kind. This applies to internal as well 
as external abscesses. 

CARBUNCLES. 
Description and Symptoms. — A carbuncle is a very painful inflamma- 
tion of the lower or true skin. The painful part begins to swell, harden, 
and discolor, generally assuming a purplish color. After 5 or 6 days little 
openings form in the swollen and discolored place, from which there is- 
sues a yellowish, mattery substance. The swelling and hardness continue 
to increase in circumference. Only a little matter comes from each hole but 
these holes gradually widen and run together until by degrees a consider- 
able portion of the skin is entirely destroyed ; or, the outer skin may be raised 
in a greenish blister which finally breaks. We now see the dead tissue 
underneath; the matter discharges more freely and large pieces of the dead 



SKIN DISEASES. 321 

tissue slough off with it. The loss of flesh may amount to several inches. 
Carbuncles are much more destructive and dangerous than are boils. They 
appear most frequently on the back of the neck, along the spine, on the 
forehead and on the buttocks and aged people are chiefly affected with them. 
When they' appear with diabetes they are hard to heal and usually mean 
death. 

Treatment — Open thoroughly and deeply with a sharp, clean knife 
which has been placed in boiling water for at least five minutes before using. 
Make two cuts, crosswise ; then dress twice a day and scrape out all the 
dead tissue. Some advise burning out the dead tissue with carbolic acid 
but this might be dangerous in aged people. All dressing must be done 
cleanly. Have at hand some absorbent cotton, gauze and adhesive plaster. 
After dressing, wet the cotton with some antiseptic solution like listerine 
and place this on the carbuncle and cover with more cotton and gauze and 
fasten in place with the adhesive plaster. The dressing is done by washing 
the part v/ell with cotton, gauze, or clean linen which is dipped into some 
antiseptic solution like listerine. Use some antiseptic, if possible, but if 
there is none within reach, use boiling water. Dig out the dead tissue with 
a clean, boiled instrument, syringing if necessary with an antiseptic solu- 
tion or peroxide of hydrogen, full strength. Clean and re-dress the car- 
buncle frequently. 
PEOPLE'S HOME REMEDIES.— 

1. Salt and Turpentine. — Bind salt upon the carbuncle and keep it wet 
with turpentine. 

3. Flaxseed Poultice. — Poultice with flaxseed meal. 

Physician's Remarks. — This contains heat and moisture and through 
its sedative properties is soothing to the carbuncle. This is also true of 
the slippery elm poultice. 

3. Slippery Elm Poultice.— Apply a poultice of slippery* elm bark to 
the carbuncle. 

4. Egg, Turpentine, Camphor and Flour. — Take the yolk of an egg, 
two tablespoonfuls of turpentine, a teaspoonful of pulverized camphor gum 
and enough flour to form a paste. Bind this on the carbuncle with a piece of 
muslin. 

Physician's Rem^irks. — The yolk of an tgg is right lively in its drawing 
powers. 

5. Tannin. — A man in North Dakota cured some very bad carbuncles 
with tannin. He sprinkled as much into the openings as would dissolve and 
in 34 hours washed them with castile soap; this treatment he continued until 
cured. 

Physician's Remarks. — Tannin is an astringent, lessens the discharge^ and 
allays the odor. 

6. Yolk of Egg. — If you desire something to draw, nothing better will 
be found than the yolk of an egg mixed with salt. 

7. Carbolic Acid. — Crude carbolic acid is sometimes used for carbuncles 
but should be used with great care. 

8. Egg, Sugar and Flour. — Take the yolk of an egg, 1 teaspoonful of 
white sugar, and 1 teaspoonful of flour; mix well together and bind on as 
a poultice. This will not increase the pain. 

Physician's Remarks. — This is good for getting rid of the dead tissue 
of a carbuncle. 



322 THE PEOPLE'S HOME MEDICAL BOOK. 

9. Bread and Milk Poultice. — A bread and milk poultice is both draw- 
ing and soothing. 

10. Wild Cherry, Burdock, Yellow Dock and Dandelion. — Make a strong 
tea of equal parts of wild cherry bark, and the roots of burdock, yellow dock 
and dandelion. Sweeten and take a tablespoonful three times a day. This 
is to get the blood in good condition. 

11. Smartweed. — Poultice the carbuncle with smartweed. 

BOILS. 
Furunculosis. 

Dci^cription. — A boil is an inflammation of a spot in, or under the skin 
and there is the formation of pus as a result of this inflammation. Boils 
frequently appear in persons suffering with sugar diabetes. 

TREATMENT. — Tincture of iodine painted on boils sometimes stops 
them if applied early. You can poultice with flaxseed meal or with a bread and 
milk pouhice to which a little catnip has been added. Have the poultices 
just large enough to thoroughly cover the boils and keep them hot. The 
application of poultices should be stopped when the boil comes to a head 
and it should be opened. Burdock, yellow dock, leptandrin and sarsaparilla 
are all good to take internally for the blood. When they come with diabetes 
they are hard to cure. If you have many boils or carbuncles you should 
have the urine analyzed for sugar. . Keep the kidneys and bowels working well. 

Allopathic Treatment, — Apply two per cent, salicylate ointment twice 
daily. Internally take % grain of calcium sulphide' four times a day. At 
first paint the sore with collodion and renew the coat every hour, until a 
heavy covering is formed. If pus forms it must be opened. The poultices 
should contain sweet oil, and if there is much pain they should contain lau- 
danum. Alc9hol and camphor applied locally are good in the first stages. 
When boils occur in the external ear, syringe the canal frequently with hot 
water and open the boil when it is ripe. The following ointment will be 
found excellent for the pain. To 1 dram of petrolatum add 4 grains of iodo- 
form and 2 grains of menthol. Smear this on some cotton and put into the ear 
two or three times a day. 
PEOPLE'S HOME REMEDIES.— 

1. Chamomile Flowers. — A poultice of chamomile flowers will draw 
a boil to a head so that it may be opened. 

Physician's Remarks. — A chamomile poultice holds heat and moisture 
for a long time and it has a sedative, or quieting and soothing, action on the 
local parts which is due to its oily constituents. 

2. Castor Oil and Lime Water. — " Apply castor oil freely to the boil and 
at the same time take lime water to cleanse the blood of its impurities," writes 
a lady who has tried it. 

Physician's Remarks. — The calciunf in the lime water is what aids in 
purifying the blood.

FELON. 
Run-Around — Whitlow — Paronychia — Panaratium. 

There are two kinds — the superficial and the deep seated. 

Description of Superficial Variety. — This kind is generally seated imme- 
diately around and beneath the finger nail, commencing either at the side, 
the back, or the end of the finger. It is of a dusky red, tender, anc' '^ery pain- 
ful on pressure and throbs violently and continually but is not swollen much. 
Two or three days later matter is seen under the outer skin and sometimes 
it is also under the nail. These are the kind of felons that can be stopped 
with such remedies as the home remedies given below. 

Description of Deep Seated Variety. — In this variety the deeper struc- 
tures are affected and the pain is terrible. The tough covering of the bone is 
affected and pus appears next to the bone and underneath this tough cover- 
ing and the swelling is what causes the terrific pain. There is but one thine 
to do for this kind of felon and that is to open it early and thoroughly. If 
you do not do this you will suffer terribly for days and nights and may 
lose the use of a joint or have a crippled finger or hand. However, if opened 
properly, one openi'ng is all that will be necessary, unless the felon comes 
in the palm of the hand where deep opening is dangerous on account of the 
blood vessels. 

How to Open a Felon. — Have a curved knife with both edges sharp and 
it should be placed in boiling water for at least 5 minutes before usine. 
Place the patient's hand on the table with the felon side up, and this is usually 
the palm. Put the patient's arm away from the body and stand behind the 
elbow. Put the knife carefully on the finger a little ways from the felon 
and on the side nearest the hand. Call the patient's attention to something- 
at the other side of the room and while he is looking away press down hard 
with the knife and as you press down he will ierk and thus make the cut 
long enough. As the table is solid he cannot jerk down away from the 
knife and the cut will go through the covering of the bone as desired and in 
10 minutes there will be very little pain. The knife must go through the 
tough membrane which covers the bone or you will hurt the patient without 
doing him any good. Have a sharp knife, a solid table, and press hard, as it 
will not hurt any more and it will all be over in two seconds. As a genera! 



9U THE PEOPLE'S HOME MEDICAL BOOK. 

thing, I would discharge any doctor who saw a bone felon early and had to 
open it more than once. Placing the hand on the table is essential; the 
sharp knife and pressure will do the rest Remember that you must cut deep 
enough to go through the periostetim, or covering of the bone. The pus 
is between this covering and the bone and you must make an opening for it. 
If you do not, it will, after many days and nights of suFering, burrow through, 
and destroy much flesh. 

PEOPLE'S HOME REMEDIES FOR FELONS.— 

1. Egg and Salt, — To prevent a felon apply the white of an egg with 
y2 teaspoonful of salt added. If applied in time no one need have a felon.

heal with some good salve. 

12. Egg, Turpentine, Soap, Salt and Meal. — Take the yolk of an egg, 
10 drops of spirits of turpentine, a small quantity of hard soap, and a tea- 
spoonful each of burnt salt and Indian meal ; mix, and apply to the felon. 

13. Turpentine and Flour. — Take a little Venice turpentine, thicken it 
with wheat flour and apply as a thin plaster. 

14. Soap and Brown Sugar.— A plaster made of equal parts of soap and 
brown sugar is good when applied to a felon. 

15. Honey and Flour. — Take a little honey and stir in wheat flour to 
make a paste and apply this to the felon as a plaster. 



SKIN DISEASES. 3»S 

WENS. 

Descriptipn. — Wens are encysted tumors varying from the size of a 
small pea to the size of a walnut or even an orange. They are generally 
movable. They very often appear on the head and frequently get sore from 
combing and brushing. 

Treatment. — They are harmless unless they get sore. They may easily 
be taken out with a knife. They may also be eaten out with salve made of 
equal parts of fine salt and the yolk of an egg but it will take some time. 

ULCERS. 
Treatment. — Burnt alum is good for ulcers and for proud flesh. Witch 
hazel is a good aplication for ulcers on the legs. Apply lime to old lazy 
ulcers that need life. Either tannic" acid or strong white oak bark are good 
for some. Apply peroxide of hydrogen when there is much mucus-pus. 
Also apply a hot pack to liven them up. 

PEOPLE'S HOME REMEDIES.— (Also see " Home Remedies for Cancers, 
Tumors and Ulcers.") 

1. Potato and Charcoal. — Apply a poultice of equal parts of scraped 
raw potato and finely powdered charcoal. The lady from whom this recipe 
was obtained says that her son had a foul sore of long standing on his leg 
and that different physicians doctored him without success. She at last 
accidentally ran across this recipe in an old medical book and decided to 
try it with the result that the sore was entirely healed up and has not ap- 
peared again. . 

3. Bread, Flaxseed and Charcoal. — Let an ounce of bread stand in 5 
ounces of hot water near the' fire for 10 minutes and add 5 drams of powdered 
flaxseed and two drams of charcoal, thus forming a soft poultice. This will 
be found excellent for ulcers. 

3. Slippery Elm. — A slippiery elm poultice is a good application for 
ulcers.

following recipe which she says will cure ulcers or old sores. Put into a 
quart bottle six drams of loaf sugar, 4 drams of alum, 2^2 drams of blue- 
stone, 1 dram of sugar of lead and 1 tablespoonful of honey; then pour in 
a pint of vinegar and shake several times a day until it is dissolved. Applv

SWEATING OF FEET. 
Bromidrosis. 
' Apply belladonna ointment at night for adults. Watch for a dry throat 
and enlarged pupils for these indicate the use of too much belladonna. A 
teaspoonful of boric acid to a cup of water is good as a wash. The oin.t-

cracking and chapping ; camphor is very good for chapped or rough hands ; 
the listerine is an antiseptic wash and lemon juice acts as an astringent and 
is a little hardening. 

5. Hog's Lard. — Chapped hands can generally be cured by keeping clean 
and applying hog's lard. Keeping the hands clean is a good preventive and 
especially with children. 

6. Glycerine, Bay Rum and Rose Water. — A mixture of glycerine, bay

2. Bora^, Sugar and Lemon Juice. — Put into a bottle % dram of pow- 
dered borax, 1 dram of sugar and 2 ounces of lemon juice. Let stand for 
several days, then rub the face three times' daily. 

3. Glycerine and Lemon Juice. — " Tan and freckles may generally be

is in the habit of spending her summers at the sea shore where one usually 
gets a good coat of tan. 

4. Buttermilk. — Wash the face every morning in fresh buttermilk, then

ACNE, PIMPLES AND BLACKHEADS. 

Acne is an inflammation of the sebaceous glands. The contents of these 
glands project above the surface, forming blackheads. This frequently 
occurs at the time of puberty and often afterwards. Use green, or castile 
soap on the face night and morning and follow with brisk rubbing. If 
this irritates you can use cerate or emulsion of sweet almonds. From 1/10 
to % grain of sulphurated lime is good taken internally three times a day. 

For inflamed acAe take 30 grains of iodide of sulphur and 1 ounce of 
simple cerate ; mix, and apply to the parts night and morning. 

For monthly acne, occurring at the time of the menses, mix 1 dram of 
sulphur, 1 ounce of glycerine and enough water to make 8 fluid ounces. 
Apply 2 or 3 times daily and avoid all rich foods. You can also take 30 
or 30 grains of sulphur internally 3 times a day as an alterative; or, as a 
laxative, take from 1 to 8 drams in molasses at night. 
PEOPLE'S HOME REMEDIES.— 

1. Sulphur. — ^Take out-door exercise, avoid rich foods, and three times 



SKIN DISEASES. 238 

a week take a thimbleful of sulphur in a glass of milk before bre^fast. Be 
careful not to take cold while taking the sulphur. 

2. Borax Water. — Keep the bowels open and sponge the face every 
night with hot borax water. 

ECZEMA. 
Salt Rheum — Impetigo — Intertrigo. 

This name covers a number of skin diseases. It is a wide-spreading 
inflammation of the outer surface of the skin causing numerous little vesicles 
upon an inflamed and irregular surface. Sometimes these vesicles are inter- 
mingled with pustules, then it is called impetigo. Sometimes the outer skin 
is actually thrown off leaving a raw moist surface, then it is called intertrigo. 

TREATMENT. — Avoid salty foods, salt fish, pork, corned beef and 
greasy foods such as bacon, fried dishes, pastry and cheese. Be in the fresh 
air as much as possible and take plenty of exercise. You should use rubber 
gloves if you have to wash dishes. 

Allopathic Treatment. — If on the head the hair must be cut close. In 
the early stages apply oxide of zinc ointment night and morning. This should 
be used in connection with black wash which is made by adding 1 dram of 
calomel to 1 pint of lime water. This should be applied just before the zinc 
ointment and allowed to dry. Use a swab to apply it with. 

In other cases powdered oxide of zinc is dusted over the part if the 
discharge is very waterj' and profuse; or, the following ointment may be 
used. Mix 1 ounce of bismuth oxidii, 8 ounces of acidi oleici puri, 3 ounces 
of cera alba, 9 ounces of petrolati, and 5 drops of olei rosae. Apply to the 
affected parts. It is best to have just half of the quantity given put up at 
one time. 

Sometimes the crusts must be removed by poultices; or, if on the face, 
anoint with olive oil containing one or two drops of phenol to the ounce. This 
is to soften the crusts which may readily be removed in half an hour with soap 
and water. Do not use soap if the parts are too much inflamed. 

When the acute form has passed use 1 dram of ointment of tar and 6 
drams of zinc oxide ointment. Mix these and apply to the parts to excite 
the skin to action. 

Cider vinegar applied locally is a fine remedy. 

Homeopathic Treatment. — The remedies are Hepar §ulph.. Graphites 
Sulph., Rhus Tox. and Arsenicum. (For preparation and dpses see " Homeo- 
pathic Medicines " in Nursing Department.) 
PEOPLE'S HOME REMEDIES.— 

1. For Eczema. — Apply the following ointment twice daily. Take red 
precipitate, IV2 drams; Venice turpentine, 1/2 ounce and fresh butter 2 ounces. 
Also take blood root, 1 ounce and yellow dock root, 1 ounce; put these to- 
gether in % pint each of alcohol and vinegar and let stand a week. Apply 
this twice a day also. 

2. Milk Crust. — For milk crust give sulphur and cream of tartar inter- 
nally and apply either glycerine or thick cream to the parts externally. 

3. Scald' Head. — Bran water is a good wash for the head. Or. wash 
the parts with warm water containing corn meal or oatmeal; wipe dry and 
apply a mixture of stramonium ointment, 1 ounce; and carbolic acid, 10 
grains. Let this stand over night. 

4. Sulphur, Beef Marrow, Turpentine and Pepper.— Apply an ointment 



S34 THE PEOPLE'S HOME MEDICAL BOOK. 

made by thoroughly mixing equal parts of sulphur, beef marrow, white tur- 
pentine and black pepper. The parts may be cleaned with oatmeal water. 

5. Oatmeal Water, Iodine, Sweet Cream and Carbolic Acid. — A fine 
treatment for skin diseases is to cleanse the parts with oatmeal water, dry, and 
bathe with tincture of iodine. Let this dry of itself and apply sweet cream 
and carbelic acid. One drop of the acid should be added to a teaspoonful of 
the cream. This has cured many obstinate cases. It costs but little to 
prepare and is well worth trying. 

Physician's Remark. — Do not use iodine too freely nor too often. 

6. Sassafras and Lard. — Boil for half an hour a pound of swamp sassa- 
fras bark in enough fresh water to cover it. Take out the bark and use the 
water as a wash. Add some lard to some of the water and simmer until the 
water is evaporated and after each washing anoint the parts wii:h the lard. 
You may expect a cure in 4 or 5 days. 

7. Strawberry Leaves. — Lay the woolly or outer side of strawberry 
leaves upon the parts affected. If laid on thick and occasionally changed 
they will draw out the inflammation and cure tetter. 

8. Sugar of Lead. — Put % teaspoonful of sugar of lead into water and 
apply freely. 

9. Potato Water. — Boil potatoes with the skins on and apply the 
Vi^ater in which they were boiled. Apply 3 or 4 times a day. " I know this 
to be a success," writes a lady from Columbus, Ohio. 

ITCH. 
Scabies. 

This is an eruption produced by a parasite and is very " catching." It 
covers the body in parts but is seen chiefly between the fingers where it often 
makes a raw surface. 

Treatment. — Sulphur ointment is a sure cure. This should be applied 
at night. First soak the parts thoroughly with soap and water, rub with a 
hard rough towel to uncover the parasites, then apply the ointment thoroughly 
and let it remain on all night. The towel used should at once be boiled to kill 
the parasites and prevent the spreading of the disease. ' 

PEOPLE'S HOME REMEDIES.— 

1. Sulphur and Lard. — Apply sulphur ointment which is made by taking 
two parts of lard and one part of milk of sulphur. 

2. Sulphur and Lime.— ^To five parts of water add two parts of sulphur 
and a quart of freshly slaked lime. Boil in a porcelain dish, stirring con- 
stantly, until the mixture is the color of cinnamon. Keep well corked and 
apply to the affected parts about once a day. 

3. Sulphur. — Give sulphur three times a day in the form of powder, 
tincture or pellets and apply sulphur ointment to the affected parts. 

4. Blood Root and Vinegar. — Keep the bowels open. To relieve the 
itching and dryness of the skin take 1 ounce of blood root and l/^ pint of 
vinegar; steep for two hours; strain, and paint the affected parts once or 
twice a day with the liquid. Every night before going to bed apply glycerine 
freely. 

BARBER'S ITCH. 
Tineo Sycosis. 
Carbolic acid may be applied locally but it is likely to leave a scar. Mix 
1 dram of iodine crystals and 1 ounce of goose grease and apply night and 
morning until some redness appears. 



SKIN DISEASES. 335 

PEOPLE'S HOME REMEDIES.— 

1. Barber's Prescription. — The following treatment is from a barber 
at Kiram, Ohio, and is said to be excellent for this disease. 

Fluid. — Take 1 ounce of resorsin, 1 ounce of glycerine, 1 ounce of water, 
1% ounces of lac sulphur, % ounce of cologne .and 4 ounces of alcohol. To 
make the preparation more pleasant dissolve the sulphur in ^^ ounce of ether 
before adding to the mixture. 

Ointment. — Take 15 grains of tannic acid, y^. dram of precipitated sul- 
phur and 5 drams of petrolatum. 

Directions. — Apply the liquid several times a day with a soft sponge and 
bathe the parts every morning with hot water. The ointment is not to be 
used until the scabs have formed. It is then to be applied immediately after 
each application of the liquid. The purpose of the ointment is to keep the 
parts soft. 

2. Lard, Gunpowder, Sulphur and Alum. — Cleanse the parts ^vith 
castile soap suds and apply the following ointment. Put into an earthen dish 
% pint of unsalted lard or fresh unsalted butter and add 1 tablespoonfuls each 
of gunpowder, sulphur and alum, each powdered. Stew slowly for 24 hours, 
strain, and it is ready for use. 

3. Carbolic Acid. — Take a tooth pick, put the end into clear carbolic 
acid and apply to each pimple. When the burning stops keep the sores well 
greased with some good healing salve. A lady writes from Independence, 
Iowa — •" About seven years ago my son had this disease in the worst form 
and after six weeks' treatment with one of our best docxors, my son cured it 
himself with this treatment." 

4. Lard and Sulphur. — Apply equal parts of lard and sulphur. 
Physician's Remarks. — I believe this treatment will be found better for 

the common itch than for barber's itch. 

SHINGLES. 
Herpes-Zoster. 

Description and Symptoms. — This disease spreads along the tracks of 
certain nerves of the skin. It comr ences at the spine and runs around the 
ribs to the breast bone. It also app irs on the neck, face and temples. The 
disease is nearly always preceded y rheumatic pains or neuralgia in the 
parts affected, fever, and weakness. There is burning in the parts, then red- 
ness, then the cluster of vesicles appears. Crusts form in 4 or 5 days and 
this ends the attack unless a new crop appears. 

TREATMENT. — I am always a little afraid of the use of strong local ap- 
plications in this disease. Keep the bowels open with salts, eat a light diet 
and meet the indications. 

Homeopathic Treatment. — The second dilution of Aconite, the first dilu- 
tion of Gelsemium, and the third trituration of Hepar Sulph. are the medicines. 
(See " Homeopathic Medicines " in Nursing OcpartmeuJ for preparation and 
doses.) 

PEOPLE'S HOME REMEDIES.— 

1. Sassafras, Burdock and Yellow Dock. — ^Regulate the bowels with a 
mild cathartic and take freely of a decoction of sassafras, burdock and yellow 
Hock root. At night bathe with warm saleratus water. 

Physician's Remarks. — The above herbs are good for the blood and liver 
3. Warm Lard — Bathe the affected parts with warm lard.. 



286 THE PEOPLE'S HOME MEDICAL BOOK. 

3. Elder Flower Ointment and Oxide of Zinc. — Use an ointment made 
by adding 1 dram of oxide of zinc to 1 ounce of elder flower ointment. 
Physician's Remarks. — This is a good soothing ointment. 

RINGWORM. 
Tinea Circinata — Also Ringworm of Neck and Head. 

TREATMENT.^Apply locally a strong solution of borax. This is also 
good for ringworm on the neck and head. 

Another good treatment is to mix 1 dram of iodine crystals with one 
ounce of goose grease. " Apply this night and morning until some redness 
of the skin appears when it is to be used but once a day. You may have to 
use it tor weeks. Turpentine applied with a brush is also very good. A 
bichloride of mercury tablet dissolved and applied is very good. Use 1 part 
of mercury to 500 parts of water. It is poisonous and irritates quickly. Can 
generally use it twice a day. Stop when it makes the parts sore. Equal parts 
of tar and suet are good but tar stains badly. Citrine ointment, 1 part and 
vaseline 7 parts, is also good. 

Ringworm on the Head — Tinea Capitis. — Apply lime water locally. 

Ringworm on the Neck. — Apply the iodine or the borax as directed above. 
Pure oil of cajeput applied locally is another good remedy. 

PEOPLE'S HOME REMEDIES.— 

1. Tobacco, Lye and Vinegar, — Boil tobacco leaves ; add strong lye ancj, 
vinegar to the liquid and apply locally. This is an excellent remedy. 

2. Alcohol and Walnut- Hulls. — To half a pint of alcohol add a handful 
of green walnut hulls and let it stand five or six days. Apply tys tincture 
externally to either ringworm or tetter. Also put a teaspoonful of this 
tincture into half a tumblerful of water, stir it well and take a teaspoonful 
internally every hour. Make this fresh every morning and take for 3 or 4 
days. ' 

3. Alum and White of Egg. — Make a curd by mixing alum with the 
white of an, egg in a vessel over the fire. One or two applications of this 
will cure ringworm. 

4. Indian Corn. — Sprinkle grains oi Indian corn on a red hot shovel 
and press them with a cold flatiron. Tl corn will burn and leave an oil on 
the flatiron. Rub the ringworm with th i oil. 

Remarks^ — In the collection of these home recipes, out of the hundreds 
received, it is but natural that a few of a superstitious nature should be 
received. For instance, here is a recipe for ringworm. " Have a pregnant 
woman wash the affected parts with her saliva before breakfast with her 
left-hand little finger and this will make it disappear." We might add that 
this is to be mixed with an equal part of good strong faith and even then 
we believe some of the other remedies given will prove more satisfactory. 
All recipes of this character we have carefully eliminated. We have thus 
discarded many of the recipes received, some of which may be good in many 
cases, but there were so many good ones that we have kept none but the 
very best and they will be found of real practical value. 

GANGRENE. 
Mortification. 

This is death of a part of the body in a mass. In surgery, when referring 



SKIN DISEASES. 337 

to the death of bone the term " necrosis " is generally used. There is the 
dry and the moist gangrene. 

Dry Gangrene. — Dry gangrene, or mummification, is a condition pro- 
duced by a loss of water from the tissues. The skin becomes black and 
wrinkled and is often of a leather-like hardness. The most typical form is 
senile gangrene, or gangrene of old age. This occurs in the lower extremities, 
feet and toes and is generally due to hardening of the arteries. 

Moist Gangrene. — This is caused by a checking of the blood supply pr 
by obstruction of the return of the blood through the veins. This is frequently 
caused by wounds, fractures, etc. 

TREATMENT. — For dry gangrene, keep up thcv strength of the system 
and ease the pain if possible. 

For moist gangrene, have a physician keep the parts thoroughly cleansed 
with disinfectants. 

Home Remedy. — Dissolve some saltpeter in strong vinegar, dip a cloth 
in it and lay on the afSEected parts. / 

PEMPHIGUS. 

This comes in the form of blebs, or watery blisters. The acute form 
is attended, with pretty high fever and the patient feels quite sick. It lasts 
about two weeks and is sometimes fatal. This disease does not occur often. 
TREATMENT.— 

Allopathic Treatment. — Give 5 drops of Fowler's solution of arsenic at 
meal times. 

Homeopathic Treatment. — The sixth dilution of Rhus Tox. and the third 
dilution of Cantharis given every hour are the remedies. (See " Homeopathic 
Medicines " in the Nursing Department for preparation and doses.) 

PSORIASIS. 

This is a chronic inflammation of the skin. It causes a mere redness and 
the outer skin seems to get sickly and drops off in scales. Use an ointment 
made of equal parts of ammoniate of mercury (hydrargyri ammon) and lard. 
Apply once a day. Also, to soften the scales use the following after taking a 
bath. Take 1 dram of chrysarobin, 1 ounce of collodium and enough ether 
and alcohol to make a solution. Apply to the affected parts with a brush. 
Do not apply it to the face apd do not use it if there is a raw su^-face. 

Take 5 drops of Fowler's solution of arsenic 3 times a day. 

INGROWING TOE NAILS. 

, Apply solution of potassa hydroxide to soften the nail. Then soak a 
pledget of absorbent cotton in strong alum water and place this under the 
nail. If. it pains much to do this, apply pure phenol with a brush a few 
minutes before placing the cotton under the nail. This will ease the pain 
caused by turning up the nail. 
PEOPLE'S HOME REMEDIES.— 

1. Scraping Nail. — Scrape the top of the nail until it is very thin and 
press a small piece of cotton batting under it. 

2. Lard or Tallow. — Hot lard or tallow poured under the side of the 
nail is an execellent remedy for this trouble. 

3. Care of Nails. — Trim the nails straight across ; do not cut the corners

down in and do not cut the cuticle from the side of the nail. Scrape the top 
of the nail'thin and cut a notch in the center. This, growing together pulls 
the nail away from the sides where it is painful. 

LIVER SPOTS. 

Apply oxide of zinc ointment once a day. 

PEOPLE'S HOME REMEDIES FOR HIVES OR NETTLE RASH.

7. Wheat Flour and Saffron or Sage Tea, Etc. — Whenever the eruption 
appears rub the body with wheat flour and let the patient drink freely of 
saffron tea or sage and sassafras teas. When getting better give the follow- 
ing physic. To three parts of cream of tartar add one part of sulphur; mix 
with molasses and give a teaspoonful three times a day for several days. 
Or, give a dose of salts or senna. 

8. Diet, Etc. — Warm saleratus water is a good application for the skin. 
Drink water but no heating drinks. Eat gruels, dry toast, baked apples and 
stale bread but no meat. 

9. Magnesia, Cream of Tartar and Milk. — Mix half a teaspoonful each 
of magnesia and cream of tartar in half a teacupful of milk and take every 
morning before breakfast until cured. 

Physician's Remarks. — This acts on both the kidneys and the bowels.

DISEASES DUE TO ANIMAL PARASITES. 



PIN WORMS— THREAD WORMS— SEAT WORMS. 

(For symptoms see " Round Worms.") 

TREATMENT. — Inject soap and water into the bowel and after it hao 
passed, inject a pint of warm water in which there has been boiled from 
1/^ to 1 ounce of quassia chips. I think, thoug^h, that the following: will be 
found better. Put 1 ounce of quassia chips and % ounce of salt into a 
pint of water and let it stand over night. Inject very slowly all that the 
bowels will hold. Repeat once a week until all are removed. 

Another remedy is to inject an infusion of garlic for two or three 
nights in succession. Put a small bunch of garlic into a pint of water and 
steep down to % pint. ' 

Cina and How to Use It. — For worms, and especially pin, or seat, worms, 
get the homeopathic tincture of cina and give 1 drop four times a day until 
the child is better. Begin again whenever necessary. This is also good for 
worms in puppies. You can give them 3 or 3 drops at a time. Cina will 
also destroy round worms in people. For these you should give about 3 
drops 4 times a day. It seems to cut the worms into small pieces. It is 
well to give a physic about every third day when this medicine is beinsf 
used. The homeopathic tincture should be bought of a homeopathic doctor 
or at a drug store where they keep homeopathic medicines. 
PEOPLE'S HOME REMEDIES.— 

1. Salt Water. — Drink salt water in the morning, using a tablespoonful 
of salt to half a pint of water. Also use salt water as an injection. 

2. Sulphur. — Take a tablespoonful of sulphur, or enough for a laxative, 
and it will bring them away. A lady at Garrettsville, Ohio says, " I have 
tried this and so have my friends." 

3. Turpentine and Sugar. — A drop of turpentine on a teaspoonful of 
sugar is good when troubled with worms. 

4. Egg Shells and Molasses. — Take a quantity of egfr shells, dry them, 
pound to a fine powder, add New Orleans molasses to make a thick paste 
and take V2 teaspoonful three times a day. The lady sending this receipt 
says, " I have used this for my daughter and for myself and the results 
were entirely satisfactory." 

5. Wormseed and Molasses. — Mix molasses and wormseed and give to 
children in teaspoonful doses. A grown person may take II/2 teaspoonfuls. 

6. Spearmint Tea. — Pin worms may be removed by using spearmint 
tea both as a drink and «.s, an injection. 

7. Boneset, Etc. — Take 2 scruples of aloes, 15 grains of carbonate of 
potassa, 3 fluid drams tincture of asafetida and % pint of infusion of bone- 
set; mix, and use as an injection for pin worms.

239 



340 THE PEOPLE'S HOME MEDICAL BOOK. 

9. Wormseed. — ^Use wormseed. The oil of wormseed is best. Giv^ 
from 4 to 8 drops with sugar morning and evening for 4 days in succession, 
and follow with a cathartic. Or, you can use the tincture of wormseed, 
giving 1 drop 4 times a day. 

10. Quassia. — Make a tea by steeping quassia chips in water for 13 
hours and use this as an injection. 

ROUND WORMS. 

Symptoms. — Disturbed sleep, grinding the teeth in thei sleep, irritable 
disposition, changeable appetite, picking the liose, red cheeks but white 
around the mouth. If they are seat worms the child frequently scratches 
the rectum. 

Treatment. — Cina is a good remedy and you will find the form and dose 
explained in the treatment of pin, or thread, worms. 

For removing round worms I generally use pills made of equal parts 
of santonine and calomel. Each pill should contain 1/10 grain of each of 
these. Give three pills a day for 3 days; leave off for 3 days; give again 
for 3 days and repeat in this way until the worms are all eradicated. After- 
wards I always give the second trituration of china in sugar discs. Take 
from 1 to 4 times a day for a month. 
PEOPLE'S HOME REMEDIES.— 

1. Tansy aiid Boneset. — A tea made with either tansy or boneset is 
an excellent remed3^ for worms.

dram of savin and 2 drams of manna ; mix, and steep in a pint of boiling 
water and strain. The dose is from y2 to 3 fluid ounces. 

5. Garlic. — Give % dram of garlic juice ; of, you can make a syrup from 
garlics and use that. If used too freely it will produce flatulence, headache 
and fever. 

TAPE WORM. 

Treatment. — Eat no food for 18 hours before giving the remedy and for 
the 34 hours before this the diet should be very light. After giving a tape 
worm remedy the bowels should be moved with salts. 

One of the best remedies is to bruise 3 or 4 ounces of pumpkin seeds 
and then allow them to stand in water for 13 or 14 hours. Take the entire 
quantity and follow' with a cathartic. 

A good remedy is the mixture of the following infusion and emulsion. 
To make the infusion take i/^ ounce of pomegranate root, 1 ounce of pumpkin 
seeds, 1 dram of powdered ergot, and 10 ounce's of boiling water. For the 
emulsion take a drachm of the etherial extract of male fern made with 
acacia powder and add 3 drops of croton oil. Mix the infusion and the 
emulsion and take at 9 o'clock in the morning while fasting. The previous 
day you should have eaten very little and you should have taken a dose 
of salts in the evening. 

Or, take from % to 1 drachm of oleoresin of aspidium. This may be

given to an adult in emulsion or capsulp form and followed in 4 or 5 hours 
with epsom or rochelle salts. 

Another remedy is pelletierine. From 3 to 5 grains may be gfiven under 
the same conditions. Castor oil can be given for this but not after oleoresin 
of aspidiura has been given. Castor oil aids in the absorption of the drug 
into the body and this might cause poisoning. 

Another remedy is to make a tea of the bark of the pomegranate root. 
Take 3 ounces of the bark, macerate in 10 ounces of water and then reduce 
this one-half by evaporation. Give the entire quantity in divided doses,, 
Follow in an hour with a purge. 
PEOPLE'S HOME REMEDIES.— 

1. Blue Flag. — The juice of blue flag is good for expelling tape worm. 

2. Garlic. — Eat garlic and salt freely and every other day give a pur- 
gative of mandrake root and the worm will vacate the premises. 

3. Pumpkin Seeds.— The following treatment has expelled many tape 
worms and is almost certain. Eat four ounces of pumpkin seeds at night on 
an empty stomach. The next morning steep the same quantity of seeds 
in hot water and drink the tea. Eat nothing until noon. The treatment 
may be repeated the next night but it is seldom necessary. Follow this 
with a laxative. 

Remarks. — A woman in Berea, Ohio, says her sister had a tape worm 
that none of the doctors seemed to be able to expel. It was so ravenous 
that it would wake her several times a night. To allay the gnawing she 
would have to feed the tape worm by eating lumps of sugar. She tried the 
pumpkin seeds and expelled many yards of the worm. Pumpkin seeds are 
probably the best remedy known for expelling tape worms. By the doctors 
they are called " pepo." 

FLEAS. 

Nicotine solution is good and can be bought in any drug store. This 
is also good for insects on plants and flowers. Nicotine solution is made 
from nicotine which is a poison contained in tobacco. 

LICE. 

Kerosene will kill the pests. Rub it over the parts thoroughly. Equal 
parts of kerosene and lard is also good. 

CRABS OR BODY LICE. 

These are lice on the hair of the private parts. Use either mercurial 
or blue ointment. It must be rubbed in thoroughly.

read and consulted.) 



DISEASES OF THE EYE. 



INFLAMMATION OF THE EYELIDS. 
Conjunctivitis. 

Description and Symptoms. — Conjunctivitis is inflammation of the con- 
junctiva, or under covering of the eyelid. In the simple catarrhal kind there 
is a watery discharge and in the purulent kind there is a pus discharge. 
Granular conjunctivitis, or granular lids, will be treated separately. 

Treatment. — Cleanse the eye thoroughly and drop in the solution. The 
following is a good one for simple conjunctivitis. Take 4 grains of boric 
acid, 1 to 3 grains of zinc sulphate, 1 grain of morphine sulphate, and 1 
ounce of rose water; mix, and drop a few drops into the outer corner of 
the eyes twice a day- » 

Hot steeped tea leaves applied to the lids is also good, as is a tea made 
from white oak bark. 

For purulent inflammation of the lids when there is pus, the eyes shauld 
be kept clean and the solution given above should be applied. (Also, see 
the solution given in the Baby Department.) This kind of inflammation 
is dangerous and needs good careful treatment or other structures of the 
eye will become diseased. ' 

PEOPLE'S HOME REMEDIES FOR WEAK AND INFLAMED EYES. 

1. Salt Water. — One of the very best remedies for weak or sore eyes 
is to bathe them 3. or 4 times a day in weak salt water; This is nature's 
own remedy for the tears are salty as we all know. Many eye troubles would 
be avoided if mothers would see that the children used this simple remedy 
upon the first appearance of weak eyes. 

3. Chamomile Flowers and Poppy Heads. — For inflammation of the 
lids, once or twice a day use warm applications of either chamomile or 
poppy heads. 

Physician's Remarks. — These are soothing and quieting, thus doing 
away with the inflammation. 

3. Basswood Bark. — Scrape very fine some of the inner bark of the 
root of linwood or basswood and fill a tumbler one-third full. Then fill the 
tumbler with rain water and the mixture will soon thicken like jelly. Place 
some of this mucilage between two thin pieces of cloth and bind upon the 
eyes. 

4. Elder Flower Tea and Laudanum.— To a pint of soft water in an 
earthen dish add two ounces of elder flowers ; steep, strain, and add a tea- 
spoonful of laudanum. Bathe the eyes; or, if they are very painful, wet

DISEASES OF THE EYE, EAR, NOSE, THROAT AND MOUTH. 343 

cloths and bind on at night. If the blood is bad make some elder flower 
/tea for the patient to drink. 

Physician's Remarks. — These are quite soothing and healing in their 
action and elder flower tea is cleansing to the blood. 

5. Butter and Milk. — For inflammation of the edges of the eyes use 
this treatment. Melt a little fresh butter in a teaspoonful of milk and wash 
the eyes when they are glued together in the morning. Afterwards apply 
a wet sponge to them for several minutes and the lids may be opened 
without pain. 

6. Bread Poultice. — Make a poultice of bread and water with a little 
butter added, put into a small bag and lay over the eyes. 

7. Hops, Poppies and Stramonium Leaves. — For inflammation of the 
eyeball apply a poultice of either hops, poppy leaves or stramonium leaves. 

8. Golden Seal and Witch Hazel. — Add a dram each of powdered 
golden seal and witch hazel leaves to a gill of boiling water. Leave the 
herbs in the water for a quarter of an hour, then strain and bathe the 
eyes with the liquid. 

9. Scraped Potatoes. — Make a poultice of some finely scraped raw 
potato and apply to the eyes every night upon going to bed. Although they 
are unable to fully explain it, physicians have to admit that there is much 
of value in the raw potato. It is also excellent for inflamed sores of long 
standing. 

10. Cold Water Cloths. — Often all that will be found necessary to cure 
inflamed eyes is the application of cold water cloths. 

11. Belladonna. — Keep a hot compress on the eye wet in a solution 
made by putting 10 drops of the third dilution of Belladonna into a tea- 
cupful of hot water. The compress is to be. kept wet with this solution. 
Use no eye washes. " Used with good results by direction of Dr. J. H. 
Carmichael of Springfield, Mass." This is from a lady living in that city. 

13. Golden Seal. — Make a tea with half an ounce of golden seal and half 
a pint of boiling water. Bathe the eyes with this each night before going 
to bed and you will be surprised at the results. 

Physician's Remarks. — Hydrastis, or golden seal, is astringent and con- 
tracts the blood vessels, thus lessening the flow of blood to the eye and 
relieving the inflammation. 

13. Pith of Sassafras. — Cut out the pith of sassafras and put into a little 
water, causing it to curdle. This is an excellent eye wash and especially 
valuable for the sticky condition caused by inflammation. This remedy 
comes from one of the instructors at Denison University which is located at 
Granville, Ohio. The remedy can be relied upon. 

Physician's Remarks. — This makes a mild, oily and soothing application. 

14. Eye Wash. — Boil three eggs in water and when at the boiling 
point add % ounce of sulphate of zinc and allow it to settle. Use the 
water for inflammation of the eye of horse, cattle or man. For the human 
eye it should be reduced by adding ten parts of water. 

15. Poultice of Hops and Poppies. — Mash -ome hops and poppy heads; 
boil in water and make a poultice for the eyes. The water from them may 
be used for an eye wash. 

16. Garden Rhubarb. — Squeeze out the juice ^rom the root of the 
common garden rhubarb. This makes an excellent wash for weak and in- 
flamed eyes and has cured many cases. 



344 THE PEOPLE'S HOME MEDICAL BOOK. 

17. Aliun and White of Egg. — Mix some powdered alum with the 
white of an egg, place between two cloths and bind on the eyes. This is 
a very effective remedy "for badly inflamed eyes. It is well to cleanse the 
blood at the same time by taking equal parts of salt and cream of tartar. 

18. Tea Leaves and Salt Water. — Bind some steeped tea leaves on the 
eyes. Also bathe the eyes in weak salt water. 

Physician's Remarks. — Tea leaves contain tannin which is astringent 
in its action. This causes the blood vessels to contract, less blood comes to 
the eyes and the inflammation is reduced. 

19. Sulphur Water. — Put sulphur the size of the yolk of an egg in a 
clean cloth, tie well, put into a cup of warm water and bathe your eyes with 
this water, taking care that a little of it gets into the eyes. 

20. Quince Seeds. — Make a strong decoction of quince seeds and wash 
the eyes twice a day. 

31. Cranesbill. — Wash the eyes twice a day with a strong decoction 
of cranesbill. 

33. Golden Seal, Witch Hazel and Lobelia. — Make a strongf tea by boil- 
ing equal parts of golden seal and witch hazel bark in water and to this add 
an equal amount of tea made from lobelia leaves; cover, and when cold, 
strain and use on the eyes. 

GRANULAR EYELIDS. 

This is stubborn and needs application direct to the inside of the lids. 
Turn the inside of the lid out and apply a stick of alum to the granulated 
parts. A stick of nitrate of silver is also good to touch them with but is 
rather dangerous to use unless you are very careful. 

IRITIS. 
Inflammation of the Iris or Dark Part of Eye. 

This may be caused by the spreading of other diseases and especially 
by pus inflammation of children. It may also be caused by injury to the 
eye. Iritis may cause loss of sight and should receive careful attention. 

Symptoms. — The pain in the ball of the eye is hard to bear. The pain 
runs from the eye back into the head. Light hurts the eye and it feels better 
when the patient is in a dark room. The sight seems blurred and the eye 
runs water but no pus. 

TREATMENT. — If you have the above syrnptoms you should see a doc- 
tor and in the meantime you should keep in a dai-k room. Do not use the af- 
fected eye at all Bind some hot steeped tea leaves over it or apply cloths 
wrung out of hot tea or white oak bark tea. Any mild rernedy which is moist 
and hot will keep down the inflammation. If you can't get a eood doctor 
you must keep the pupil dilated, or open, so that adhesions will not form. 
This will also ease the pain. For this purpose apply the solution given 
below with an eye dropper. Open the lids and drop a few drops between 
them. Do this once or twice a day or once in two or three days. It should 
be done often enough to keep the pupils comfortably dilated. If you use 
too much the throat will become dry and contract. The' solution is made 
by adding from 1/4 to 4 grains of atropine to an ounce of water. The amount 
of the atropine to be used depends upon the severity of the attack and 
the age of the patient. Use salts to keep the bowels open. 

Homeopathic Treatment. — At the beginning give the second dilution of 



DISEASES OF THE EYE, EAR, NOSE, THROAT AND MOUTH. 345 

Aconite and this should be followed by the third dilution of Belladonna. 
(For preparation and doses see " Homeopathic Medicines " in Nursing De- 
partment.) 

STYE. 
Hordeolum. 

This generally gets well of itself but hot moist applications help. Paint 
It with strong oak bark tea, strong black tea, or a weak solution of tincture 
of iodine and water. Be careful pot to get any into the eye. 

Homeopathic Treatment. — Give the third dilution of Pulsatilla inter- 
nally. Put 10 or 15 drops into half a glass of water and give 1 or 3 teaspoon- 
fuls every 2 hours for a wqek. This is especially good when the stye keeps 
returning. Keep the bowels open with salts. 
PEOPLE'S HOME REMEDIES.— 

1. Tea, — Put a teaspoonful of tea into a small bag, moisten with hot 
water and bind on the eye before going to bed. 

2. Ice-:-Bread and Milk Poultice. — Ice will check it if applied upon 
first appearance. Apply bread and milk poultice to bring it to a head. 

3. White of Egg. — Wet the edges of the lid with the white of an eggf. 

4. Lean Beef. — Bind on a piece of lean beef. 

5. Salty Grease. — When soreness is first felt, touch the surface with 
a little salty grease. (Settlings of meat fryings is best.) Two or three ap- 
plications are necessary. It will smart a little but will not injure the eye. 

FILM ON SIGHT. 
Pterygium. 
Rub over it a stick of smooth alum or blue stick. Be careful not to 
touch any part of the eye. If it grows over the pupil it must be taken 
off. This is very easily done by an eye surgeon. It needs only the use of 
cocaine to deaden the sensibility. Alum or blue stick will often stop their 
growing. Of course the rubbing must be carefully done. Keep the eye- 
lids open a few minutes after the application so as not to get any upon other 
parts of the eye. Nitrate of silver stick is quite good but it is severe and 
needs an expert to apply. 

CATARACT. 

This occurs when the leris of the eye becomes opaque. Foreign ma- 
teria! grows in it so that the light cannot get through. 

Treatment. — The only thing to do is to let it get " ripe " and then have 
it taken out. The operation is very successful. Glasses are needed after- 
wards and the patient is a new person. The operation is usually performed 
in a very few minutes. Cocaine is usually dropped into the eye and this 
makes the operation almost free from pain. When the cataract is the result 
of injury to the eye the outlook is not so good. 

THINGS IN THE EYE. 
(See " Accidents and Emergencies.") 

CROSS EYES. 

These should always be attended to when the child is young. Go to 
a competent eye specialist. No parent has a right to let a child grow up 
with cross eyes. 



M6 THE PEOPLE'S HOME MEDICAL BOOK. 

EYE STRAIN AND GLASSES. 

Whenever any one complains of pain in the eyes and head, or back of 
the eyes, or squints after reading, or complains of the eyes hurting or 
tiring easily after reading; or, if the eyes are- continually watering; then 
the chances are that that person needs glasses. If glasses are not properly 
fitted they will injure. If they fit well they will do a world of good. 

The health of children is often injured because they have no glasses 
or because their glasses do not fit properly. They become nervous and irritable 
and are often troubled with neuralgia or headaches. The fitting of glasses 
is .an art in itself and you should go to none but a competent man. Never 
read when there is a poor light or when the light keeps flickering. Too 
bright a light is also injurious and especially a light that shines directly 
into the eyes from in front. Let the light shine over the shoulder ; or, if you 
sit facing it be sure to have a green shade over it. Do not sit stooped over 
when reading or studying or the eyes will become filled with blood and 
congested. People seldom appreciate good sight until they begin to have 
trouble with their eyes. 



DISEASES OF THE EAR. 



EARACHE. 

Children are afflicted with this painful disease oftener than adults. " 
It frequently o.ccurs with infectious diseases like scarlet fever and grip. 

Causes. — Besides coming with infectious diseases it , frequently comes 
from a cold and the ear becomes terribly inflamed and painful. Some people 
are very much subject to ear troubles. 

Treatment. — Simple earache in adults can generally be relieved by hot 
applications. Hot salt bags are good and so are flaxseed, hop, or bread and 
milk poultices. A little laudanum may be added to a bread and milk poultice 
with good results. Hot water dropped into the ear, or a few drops of 
laudanum, often gives relief. Mullein oil is also very good. Or, you can 
roast an onion in the coals, take out the heart and insert in the ear and 
bind the rest of the onion on the outside. 
PEOPLE'S HOME REMEDIES.— 

1. Onions and Tobacco. — Chop up onions and strong tobacco, using 
half as mttch tobacco as onions; wrap in a wet cloth and roast in the ashes. 
Squeeze out the juice and put 3 or 4 drops into the ear and it will give almost 
instant relief. 

Physician's Remarks. — Onions alone are good and tobacco is quietins; 
to the nerves so these two will be found a good combination. 

2. Bitter Herbs and Hop Poultice. — Steam the ear and side of the head 
over bitter herbs or apply a hop poultice. 

Physician's Remarks. — Hops are quieting and the heat and moisture 
are soothing and relieve the congestion. 

3. Garlic, Honey, Sweet Oil and Laudanum. — Roast two garlics, mash 
them while hot and add half a tablespoonful each of honey, sweet oil, and 
laudanum. Squeeze out the juice and occasionally drop a little into the ear. 
This will be found to be a valuable remedy. 

4. Sweet Oil, Glycerine and Laudanum. — Wrap a hot brick or stone 



DISEASES OF THE EYE, EAR, NOSE, THROAT AND MOUTH. 247 

with a damp cloth and place it to the ear, thus steaming it freely. To a tea- 
spoonful each of sweet oil and glycerine add 10 drops of laudanum ; warm 
the mixture, and put three or four drops into the ear. 

5. Warm Water. — Pour a teaspoonful of warm water into the ear and 
soon afterward let it run out. 

6. Laudanurii and Sweet Oil. — Use equal parts of laudanum and sweet 
oil; have it slightly warm and put two drops into the ear. 

7. Laudanum, Glycerine and Olive Oil. — Mix equal parts of laudanum, 
glycerine and olive oil; warm, put two or three drops into the ear and fill 
with cotton. 

8. Garlic and Salad Oil. — Steep a small piece of garlic in some salad oil, 
roll up in a thin cloth and insert in the ear. When taken aut, fill the ear 
with cotton so it will not get cold. 

9. Onion Poultice. — Place an onion in the fire completely buried in 
hot ashes. When it can be pierced with a fork, remove the peel and open and 
remove the heart and place it in the ear as hot as can be borne. Spread the 
rest of the onion on a cloth and bind on the outside of the ear. A mother 
writes, " I have used this many times and it never fails to bring relief to the 
little one suffering with earache." 

Physician's Remarks. — The moisture and heat are soothing and this 
makes a good poultice to relieve the congestion. You will notice I have 
recommended this above as one of my own treatments. 

10. Mullein Oil. — Two or three drops of mullein oil will be found 
effective. 

11. Laudanum, Sweet Oil, Honey and Cayenne. — To equal parts of 
laudanum, sweet oil and honey add a little tincture of cayenne; mix, and 
from a warm teaspoon drop into the ear 5 or 6 drops of the mixture and stop 
the ear tight with cotton. Repeat every hour or two. If the pain is very 
grieat, steam the ear and side of the head over bitter herbs and apply a hot 
fomentation of hops or a poultice made of roasted onions. Bathe the feet 
in hot water and take an active cathartic. 

12. Paregoric. — Soak a cracker in warm water, pour on a little paregoric 
and apply as hot as can be borne. 

13. Peach Seeds, Glycerine and Sweet Oil. — Take the kernels from 9 
peach seeds, pound them up fine, put into a small vessel and add one table- 
spoonful of glycerine or sweet oil and cook until the kernels are of a dark 
brown color; then strain and it is ready for use. The dose is one or two 
drops in the ear. Repeat every hour, if necessary, until relieved. The 
person sending this. recipe adds: "This is a sure and tried remedy as we 
have used it in our family for sixteen years and have never had to use it over 
three times in any case. When you haven't the sweet oil or the glycerine 
as called for you can use castor oil." 

14. Hot Applications. — The application of warmth by the means of 
dry heat or poultices or fomentations will generally tend to relieve the 
severity of the pain. 

Physician's Remarks. — Heat and moisture do this by relieving the con- 
gestion and inflammation. 

15. Black Pepper and Sweet Oil. — Put a little black pepper into a small 
piece of cotton, add a drop of sweet oil, roll up tight so that the pepper can- 
not get out and insert this in the ear. 

16. Steaming Ear. — Put the patient's feet in water as hot as can be 



348 THE PEOPLE'S HOME MEDICAL BOOK, 

borne and keep them there for 15 minutes. Put a drop of slightly warmed 
sweet oil into the ear and put the patient to bed. Take a hot flatiron, wrap 
a wet cloth around it and then a dry one and place it to the ear. This 
treatment will bring relief almost instantly. 

17. Olive Oil, Peppermint, Pennyroyal, Etc. — Take equal parts of olive 
oil, peppermint oil, pennyroyal, wintergreen oil, rosemary oil and laudanum 
and apply sparingly. 

INFLAMMATION OF THE EAR. 
(Also Mastoid Disease.) 

Symptoms. — There is fever, pain, sweating and swelling in front and be- 
hind the ears. When pus forms, and especially in the mastoid cells, there 
is very great danger and there may be unconsciousness. In some cases 
the symptoms are masked and this makes all the more care necessary. By 
examining the drum you will see it bulging if the middle ear is diseased. 
If this is the case the drum must be punctured to let out the pus. This will 
relieve the patient wonderfully. 

TREATMENT. — Inflammation of the ear from any cause needs careful 
watching and treatment for fear that mastoid disease will develop. If bad 
symptoms come on you must have the mastoid opened and it should be done 
early. If, from the beginning, there are symptoms of the blood being poisoned, 
patient is dull, stupid, and but partially conscious, then you should have a 
surgeon see the case at once. The mastoid cells are very near the brain and 
trouble in this region is dangerous. Ex-Senator Conklin, of New York, died 
of mastoid disease. 

Apply hot applications and poultices but no laudanum as you do not 
want to cover up the pain and bad symptoms. A patient with inflammation 
of the ear must be very carefully watched. The homeopathic treatment is 
excellent. Use hot applications and also the homeopathic treatment. 

Homeopathic Treatment. — Use the second dilution of Aconite everv half 
hour at the beginning. After 24 hours use the third dilution of Belladonna 
in the same way. Use the third trituration of Hepar Sulph. in alternation 
with the Belladonna. If you fear pus, use the third trituration of Mercurius 
Sol. in place of the Hepar Sulph. These having 'done splendid work for me. 
(For preparation and doses see " Homeopathic Medicines " in the Nursing 
Department.) 

CHRONIC DISCHARGE FROM THE EAR. 

This should have attention. Remember that the ear that constantly dis- 
charges is a danger to any one for the trouble will go back to the mastoid 
cells. 

Frequently, using warm water with a syringe will do good. If the dis- 
charge has a bad odor, use a few drops of carbolic acid in a teacupful of 
water and syringe the ears twice a day. After syringing you should dry 
the ear thoroughly with cotton or wear cotton in the ear. If the discharee 
continues it must have special attention or the pei;son will become deaf. The 
drum may be eaten so that it will not heal. The patient who has continual 
' discharges from the ears is frequently run down in health. Give tonics and 
in pleasant weather keep the patient out doors in the air and sunshine. 

Homeopathic Treatment. — Four times a day take a tablet of the third 
trituration of Mercuriiis. 



DISEASES OF THE EYE, EAR, NOSE, THROAT AND MOUTH. 349 

DEAFNESS. 

Deafness and hardness of hearing frequently come from the catarrhal 
condition produced by growths in the nose and throat. Have these growth's 
removed and you will be a new person. Also have the ears syringed to 
remove the wax. 
PEOPLE'S HOME REMEDIES.— 

1. Olive Oil, Etc. — Where there is wax to be removed, put a few drops 
of the following mixture into the ear once or twice a day. Mix I/2 ounce of 
olive oil, 1% drams of glycerine and 15 drops of sassafras. If the ear is too 
dry use the following : oil of turpentine, % dram ; glycerine, 1 dram and 
linseed oil, ^2 ounce. Or, if you have the ear syringed the wax will come out. 

2. Bay Salt. — Put a large tablespoonful of bay salt into half a pint of 
cold spring water. Let it stand 24 hours, occasionally shaking the bottle. 
£ach night after going to bed pour a small teaspoonful into the ear and re- 
peat for 6 or 8 nights. 

3. Sweet Clover and Hen's Oil.-^Put a handful of the sweet clover which 
is raised in gardens into a gill of hen's oil and stew Until the strength is out 
of the clover, then' strain and bottle. Syringe the ears twice a day with soap 
suds and then put in 3 or 4 drops of the oil. ': 

4. Syringing. — Deafness is frequently caused by hardened ear wax. 
Have the ears syringed out. 

5. Goose Grease. — Put one or two drops of goose grease into the ear 
twice a day. 

6. Mullein Oil. — Put a drop or two of mullein oil into the ear. This is 
also good for earache.

DISEASES OF THE NOSE. 

Nasal catarrh and hay fever both affect the lining membrane of the nose 
passages. ,These will be found thoroughly treated under " Diseases of ReS' 
piration."

GROWTHS IN THE NOSE. , , 

(Polypi, etc.) 

Many people have growths in the nose which should be removed. Of 
course cancers may come in the nose the same as anywhere else in the body 
and the only treatment is removal but the growths we refer particularly to 
are far more common than cancers. A polypus is a fleshy growth in the nose. 
The septum, or division between the nasal passages, is often diseased and 
enlarged as are the turbinated and other bones of the nose. The nasal pass- 
ages become partially, or almost completely, closed by these growths and it 
becomes difficult for the patient to breathe through the nose so he goes, around 



350 THE PEOPLE'S HOME MEDICAL BOOK. 

with his mouth open and breathing through it and is thus more subject to 
disease than one who breathes through the nose. These growths cause 
catarrh which in turn causes headaches, sore throat, and hardness of hearing. 
Many children grow dull and stupid because of these growths. Have them 
removed and see what a change it will make in the patient. 



DISEASES OF THE THROAT. 



TONSILITIS. 
(Including Quinsy.) 

Description. — Acute tonsilitis is an inflammation of the tonsils. It is 
accompanied with great swelling of their tissues and associated with pharyn- 
gitis. There is the follicular and the diffuse form of tonsilitis. The follicular 
form is distinctly infectious, that is, you can take it from another. This kind 
is rare in young children but more common between the ages of 5 and 20 
years. Some suffer from frequent attacks until they are 85 or 30 years old. 
The follicular kind is not common in adults but the diffuse, or suppurating, 
form (quinsy) is frequently met with in adults. People who breathe through 
the mouth are very much subject to it and one attack makes a person more 
liable to another. 

SYMPTOMS. — The throat is sore with a sense of swelling or tightening. 
The patient has a chilly feeling and frequently has aching and pain in the limbs. 
There is a violent headache and the fever rises to between 103 and 105 in a 
few hours. The patient rarely vomits or is sick at the stomach. (See " Scarlet 
Fever.") On examining the throat the tonsils are found to be swollen and the 
swelling frequently extends as far across the fauces as the uvula, or part of the 
soft palate which hangs down in the throat. Frequently the tonsils are so 
swollen as to press against each other. They look very red and are covered 
with a whitish-yellow or grayish covering and they are often very foul looking. 
In diphtheria, if this membrane or covering is removed, a raw or bleeding 
surface is left but in tonsilitis the surface is left smooth and glistening. (See 
the table showing the comparison of diseases.) 

In tonsilitis the breath is very foul and the odor may iill the room. The 
swelling of the glands of the neck and the stiffness of the muscles make exami- 
nation of the throat very painful. 

Symptoms of Quinsy. — In quinsy, or the suppurating form of tonsilitis, 
the general indications are often less severe but the local pain is often very 
severe. Opening the mouth may be very painful and is sometimes impossible. 
The tonsil is sometimes enormously enlarged but is rarely dotted with spots. 
It may be smooth and glistening instead. The swelling often extends to the 
uvula which may be so swollen and lengthened as to cause great distress. 
TREATMENT.— 

The treatment is largely the same for both kinds of tonsilitis. 

Preventive Treatment. — Keep ffom taking cold and if necessary have the 
tonsils or adenoids removed. 

Emergency Remedy or " What to Do." — Gargle the throat frequently with 
hot water or steam the patient's throat as described later. Sweat the patient 
and give him a cathartic. Salts are the best cathartic in this disease. Follow 
instructions given for nursing. 



DISEASES OF THE EYE, EAR, NOSE, THROAT AND MOUTH. 251 

Caution or " What Not to Do." — Do not take cold. In gargling the throat 
do not swallow the liquid or much of the mucus or secretion will also be 
swallowed. Do not eat solid foods. 

Allopathic Treatment. — In the early stages give 1/500 of a grain of 
biniodide of mercury every half hour until 10 doses have been taken. , After 
the first stage, for an adult, give from 10 to 20 drops of tincture of iron chloride 
every three to four hours. This should be well diluted with water and should 
be taken through a tube so as not to injure the teeth. Also take with it 10 
grain;; of citrate of potash. Another good remedy to take from the beginning 
is Parke-Davis & Co.'s tonsilitis tablet, triturate No. 645. Give one tablet 
every ^'to 3 hours according to age. This is an excellent remedy. Chloral 
hydrate is good for this disease. Put 1% drams into 1 oz. of water and apply 
frequently with a camel's-hair brush. Do not swallow this medicine or it will 
make you sleepy. 

Homeopathic Treatment. — I have found the homeopathic treatment very 
effective in the treatment of tonsilitis. 

For the first 24 hours give the second dilution of Aconite. Put 10 or 15 
drops into half a glass of water and take 2 teaspoonfuls every % to 3 hours. 
About the second or third day when the patient is sweating give the third 
dilution of Belladonna in the same dose and prepared in the same way as 
the Aconite. When the fever has gone down somewhat and the tonsil is 
large and red you may alternate the third trituration of Hepar Sulphur with 
the Belladonna. If the tonsils seem soft, the jaw stiff, and the patient is 
hardly able to open the mouth, use the third trituration of Mercurius Sol. 
alternately with the Belladonna instead of the Hepar Sulph. If there is 
much saliva and the above symptoms use the Mercurius Sol. alone. 

Nursing and Diet. — A very good thing to do in tonsilitis from the be- 
ginning is to gargle frequently with water as hot as it can be borne. This not 
only reduces the swelling but it is thought it aids somewhat in getting rid of the 
germs. Do not swallow anything you are gargling the throat with as it con- 
tains mucus and germs. After gargling thoroughly with the hot water you 
can use Dobell's solution with much benefit. This may be used as a- spray 
for the throat and nose or it may be diluted three times with water and used 
as a gargle. Here is the formula for this solution. To a pint of water add 1 
dram of borax, 2 drams of common baking soda and 24 grains of carbolic acid. 

As an aid in the treatment of tonsilitis and sore throat with much swell- 
ing, and especially when it seems as though the tonsil were going to break, it 
is well to steam the patient's throat in the following manner. It will be better 
than poultices and less bother. Attach a piece of hose to the spout of a tea- 
kettle of boiling water. If you have no hose, take a tube or roll of paper, put 
one end over the spout and the other end of the tube or hose in the mouth 
of the patient and have him inhale the steam. Make the tube as short as 
possible so that the steam will be as hot as the patient can bear it. The hot 
steam enters the mouth and relieves the painful and swollen parts. You will 
be surprised to learn how hot the patient can take the steam. I once saved 
a man's life with this treatment. He could neither swallow nor talk when I 
first saw him and was in a critical condition. I advised this treatment but was 
very anxious and worried about him so returned in an hour to find him sit- 
ting with the spout itself in his mouth and not using the hose or tube as 
I had directed. I was alarmed lest he should scald himself but he only 
smiled with joy for he was greatly relieved and was already able to both

swallow and talk. So steam the throat and keep it up for several hours should 
it be necessary. 

Give hot drinks like lemonade and teas, to produce sweating.., Eat no 
solid foods but liquids only. Keep the bowels open. Externally, apply an ice 
bag and keep it on all the time for several days. You can also apply a piece 
of well salted pork externally to the tonsils. Bind it on with a cloth which 
is tied under the jaw and over the head. It needs to draw well. Dip your 
moistened finger into baking soda and apply to the tonsils every hour. Or, 
you can apply pure guaiacol to the tonsils. It is painful for a little while 
but will do much good. 

The tonsils will feel soft if there is much pus in them. Should pus form 
the tonsils should be opened and it will save much pain. If you are troubled 
much with the tonsils they should be removed. 

After Effects. — It is now a pretty well settled fact with physicians that 
rheumatism enters the system through the tonsils or is caused by diseased 
tonsils. It is best to have them removed if they give you trouble. 
PEOPLE'S HOME REMEDIES.— For Tonsilitis and Quinsy. 

1. Steaming Throat. — Into a kettle containing 8 quarts of boiling water 
put either 5 drops of carbolic acid or % of a teaspoonful of turpentine and 
steam the patient's throat. 

Remarks. — Directions for steaming the throat have been given above so 
will not be repeated here. Either listerine or glyco-thymoline are also good 
to add to the water. 

2. Flaxseed and Hop Poultices. — Put hot flaxseed or hop poultices to 
the throat; change every few minutes and relief will soon follow. 

3. Honey, Vinegar and Sage Tea. — ^Take 1 tablespoonful of honey, 2 
tablespoonfuls of vinegar and enough sage tea to make half a pint. Use as a^ 
gargle. ' * 

4. Alum Water. — Gargle with weak alum water. 

5. Iodine. — Touching the 'tonsils with tincture of iodine has often cured 
quinsy. 

6. Steaming with Bitter Herbs. — Take a handful each of sage, hops, 
boneset, horehound and catnip, or any three of them if they are not all at 
hand. Place these herbs in a teakettle and steam the patient's throat. Also 
bathe the throat with the tea made from these herbs. 

7. Sumach, Sage, Borax, Alum, Saltpeter and Honey. — ^Take a small 
handful of sumach berries or bark and the same quantity of sage; put into 
three pints of water and boil down to a pint; add a teaspoonful each of pul- 
verized borax, alum and saltpeter and sweeten with honey. This is an excel- 
lent remedy when used frequently as a gargle. 

8. ' Honey and Lemon Juice.-^In the place of a gargle you can give 
freely of honey and lemon juice mixed together. 

9. Poke Root Poultice. — Roast some freshly dug poke root in the ashes 
until soft, tlien wash and apply warm as a poultice. 

Physicians Remarks. — This is a good treatment. I believe that poke 
weed is called " garget " in some sections of the country and " pigeon berry " 
in other sections. It is said that the pigeons tat these berries to reduce their 
flesh before they start on their trip south in the fall. It is because of this 
power of reducing flesh that this plant is used in so many different anti-fat 
remedies. I don't know how the plant got the name of " garget " unless it 
*« because it is given to cows to cure garget. A poultice of this root is also 



DISEASES OF THE EYE, EAR, NOSE, THROAT AND MOUTH. 353 

excellent when applied to caked udders in cows or to caked breasts in women. 
Some call it " ink berry." Don't you remember how you made ink of the 
berries when you were a child? 

10. Baking Soda. — When the first symptoms of tonsilitis appear, fre- 
quently touch the tonsils with a little baking soda and you will stop the 
progress of the disease. 

11. Homeopathic Remedy, Etc. — Procure some tablets of tfie third trit- 
uration of Mercurius Biniodide at a homeopathic pharmacy and give 2 tablets 
every hour until relieved. Also gargle the throat with a solution of water 
and peroxide of hydrogen and bind a steaming poultice of flaxseed meal on 
the throat in such a way as to cover the ears as the passage from the ear 
to the throat will be affected. This is a proved remedy. 

' 13. Vinegar, Salt and Cayenne. — To a pint of water and vinegar add a 
tablespoonfUl of salt and a teaspoonful of cayenne and simmer together. Cool, 
strain/ and use as a gargle. 

13. Blackberry Root, Elm Bark, Sumach, White Oak and Alum.— Take 
V/z ounces each of blackberry root and red elm bark and 1 ounce each of su- 
mach berries and white oak bark. Use enough water to make a tea ; strain, 
and when cool add a piece of alum as big as a walnut for each pint of the de- 
coction and use as a gargle. 

14. Vinegar and Red Pepper. — Gargle the throat with a mixture of vine- 
gar, red pepper and water. 

PEOPLE'S HOME REMEDIES FOR SWELLING OR ELONGATION 

OF THE PALATE. 

1. Alum and White Oak Bark. — Dissolve a little alum in a decoction 
of white oak bark and gargle the throat. 

2. Salt, Pepper and Mustard. — Salt, pepper, or mustard are good when 
mixed with water and used as a gargle. 

ENLARGED TONSILS AND ADENOIDS. 

The tonsils should be removed when they are continually enlarged and 
when the patient is subject to repeated attacks of tonsilitis. They should be 
removed when they are so large as to interfere with speaking and when they 
continually contain pus. They are then a danger to the system and render 
a person more subject to disease. It is thought that diseased tonsils have 
much to do with attacks of rheumatism. 

This advice as to removal also applies to adenoids and tumors. Ade- 
noids are enlarged glands in the throat. These enlargements, through the 
catarrhal condition they cause, affect the hearing and the sense of smell and 
they also affect a person's speech and obstruct the breathing. If you see a 
child that always keeps its mouth open so as to breathe more easily, you may 
be pretty certain that there is some obstruction to breathing either in the 
throat or in the nostrils. These enlargements not only make a child appear 
dull but they really cause dullness. Many a child that is punished for being 
dull and stupid would not be so if his adenoids or diseased tonsils were re- 
moved. These tumors must be removed and then the child will breathe the 
air through the nostrils as nature ifitended and it will be far healthier. The 
removal of these growths will also do much toward curing the catarrh. I am 
not in favor of indiscriminate operations but I unhesitatingly advise the re- 
moval of adenoids, diseased tonsils and foreign growths in the nose.

THINGS IN THE THROAT— CHOKING. 
(See " Accidents and Emergencies.") 

SORE THROAT. 

Pharyngitis. 

Pharyngitis is inflammation of the pharynx or back part of the throat. 

Causes. — The causes of sore throat are colds and infectious dust. 

Symptoms. — The mucous membrane is swollen and sore and there is 
some pain in swallowing. Sometimes it feels as though there were a tight- 
ening in the throat. At first the throat looks red and angry and the tongue 
is coated. 
TREATMENT.— 

Preventive Treatment. — Avoid taking cold. Do not get wet feet and 
then go around all day without drying them and putting on dry clothing. 

" What to Do." — Give a cathartic and use one of the good gargles given. 
Gargling with hot water or tea is good. Sweat the patient if necessar}^. 
Follow instructions as to nursing. 

Caution, or " What Not to Do." — When you are warm do not sit down 
to cool off. Do not take more cold. Do not allow the bowels to become con- 
stipated. Do not neglect a cold or sore throat or something more serious 
may develop. 

Allopathic Treatment. — If the patient is an adult you can give from % 
of a drop to 3 drops of tincture of aconite with 1 teaspoonful of sweet spirits^ 
of nitre in a glassful of hot lemonade every 1 to 3 hours. Watch carefully for 
dryness in the throat and stop the use of these medicines when that symptom 
appears. 

,To one ounce of liquid albolene add 3 drops each of oil of sassafras and 
oil of sandal wood and use as a spray for the throat. 

Homeopathic Treatment. — For the first 24 hours give the second dilution 
of Aconite. Put 10 or 15 drops into, half a glass of water and give 2 teaspoon- 
fuls every % to 3 hours. Follow the aconite with the third trituration of 
Mercurius Biniodide. Give one tablet every % to 3 hours. 

Nursing. — Apply a cold compress to the neck below the angle of the jaw. 
This is done by dipping cloths into cold water or ice water, wringing them 
out and binding against the part. They should not. be allowed to become 
warm or they will produce the relaxing effect of a poultice. It is well to put 
the patient to bed. Give a cathartic to move the bowels. 

An adult should gargle with water as hot as can be borne. To the water 
used you can add an equal quantity of distilled extract of witch hazel ; or, you 
can add a pinch of red pepper and some cider vinegar. A good gargle is 
made by adding a little pepper and salt to some tea made from white oak bark. 
Gargling with vinegar is good. Another good gargle is made by adding 
pepper and honey to some sage tea. Blowing sulphur through a goose quill 
upon the sore parts of the throat is often effective ; or, you can make a salve 
of 1 part of sulphur and 2 parts of cream and apply that to the throat. 

Hot teas and hot lemonade are good and if necessary you can give the 
patient a sweat. The " Corn Sweat " described in the Nursing Department is 
very effective. The teas may be made of boneset, white root, sage or hore- 
hound. They produce sweating and relieve the congestion and inflammation. 
Teas made of cranesbill, witch hazel or golden seal make good gargles. A 
hot foot bath will help.

much thickened' so that the patient must continually attempt to clear the 

throat which feels dry and harsh. The cough is spasmodic and made worse 

by exposure to cold and dust. 

Treatment. — Gargle at night with either clear hot water or hot salt water. 
Several times a day take 10 grains of benzoate of ammonia internally. 



DISEASES OF' THE MOUTH. 



SORE MOUTH— CANKERS AND ULCERS. 
Stomatitis. 

Stomatitis is an inflammation of the mouth. We will treat of the Ca- 
tarrhal, Aphthous and Ulcerative forms. 

Symptoms of Catarrhal Form. — There is an intense redness of the mucous 
membrane lining the mouth and there is some swelling which is particularly 



DISEASES OF" THE EYE, EAR, NOSE, THROAT AND MOUTH. 35? 

noticed on the gums. There is increased heat in the mouth and the child 
suffers pain. The saliva flows freely and constantly dribbles on the chin. 
There is some diarrhea or stomach and bowel trouble. 

Symptoms of Aphthous Form. — This is the catarrhal form more fully 
developed. There are cankers which are very sensitive. Every mother knows 
what cankers are and this form will not need further description. 

Symptoms of Ulcerative Forjn. — The ulcerative or putrid kind is more 
serious. The ulcers may be large and cause great pain and suffering. They 
are mostly situated along the edges of the gums which recede from the teeth ; 
or, they may be on the margins of the tongue and even on the lips. The 
breath is very foul and the mouth is made sore by the flow of saliva., 
TREATMENT.— 

More has been said concerning this disease in the Baby Department. 

Cleanse the mouth and regulate the bowels and the diet. The following 
is a good mouth wash. Mix 30 grains of chlorate of potash, 10 drops of 
tincture of myrrh and 3 fluid ounces of elixir-calisaya and use freely in the 
mouth. 

In the ulcerative form touch the ulcers with a piece of alum or a stick 
of nitrate of silver. 

The diet should be of nutritious food, such as cold consomme and cold 
chicken jelly and ordinary foods if they can be taken. 

In scurvy cases give fresh vegetables, fruits, and beef juice. These are 
absolutely needful. 

A strong decoction of cranesbill is very good for sore mouth; or, you 
can take 1 part of cranesbill and 2 parts of golden seal and make a strong 
decoction and apply to the sore mouth. 

Another good remedy is to take equal parts of the decoctions of strong 
green tea, golden seal and sage. Use this as a gargle for sore mouth and 
throat.

GANGRENOUS SORE MOUTH. 
Noma — Cancrum Oris. 

These terms are applied to all severe forms of ulceration. It is very 
serious on account of its following other debilitating diseases. It frequently 
follows measles and sometimes follows or comes with scarlet fever, typhoid 
fever and whooping cough. This must be treated by a physician. 



DISEASES OF THE EYE, EAR, NOSE, THROAT AND MOUTH. 359 

NURSING SORE MOUTH. 

This is treated in the Baby Department. 
PEOPLE'S HOME REMEDIES.— 

1. Borax and Honey. — Mix a little borax and honey and apply to the 
sore mouth. 

2. Alum, Salt, Yellow Dock and Lemon Juice. — While burning an 
ounce of alum sprinkle the same quantity of salt over it. When cold, add to

weakened with sugar and water. Apply to the gums with a cotton cloth two 
or three times a day for nursing sore mouth. 

THRUSH. 

This is described and treated in the Baby Department. Avoid 
sweets and syrups and pay attention to cleanliness and good feeding. For 
a mouth wash use 10 grains of borax to an ounce of water or 1 grain of 
permanganate of potash to 8 ounces of water ; or, use 1 part of dilute peroxide 
of hydrogen to 5 parts of water. 
PEOPLE'S HOME REMEDIES.— 

1. Borax and Loaf Sugar. — Mix pulverized borax with pulverized loaf 
sugar and apply to the mouth every 2 or 3 hours. 

3. Borax Water. — For thrush gargle with a solution made by adding a

and use as a wash for thrush. 

TOOTHACHE. 

No one needs to be told when he has the toothache so no symptoms 
need be given. 

Treatment. — Apply a hot salt bag or a hot poultice to the face. A fig or 
a raisin poultice will be found an excellent remedy for this painful affliction. 
Take a small fig or a large raisin and boil it in milk until it swells to a good 
size and then place it between the gum and cheek. You had better have two 
or three prepared so as to keep the poultice hot. This is a splendid remedy and 
will stop a great many toothaches.

insert in the cavity. If the tooth has been pulled and the bleeding from the 
gums bothers, you can apply a little cranesbill on a piece of cotton. 
PEOPLE'S HOME REMEDIES.— 

1. Field Thistle. — The worst case of toothache can be cured by chewing 
a piece of the root of the large field thistle which is commonly known as the 
" bull " thistle ; and, by drinking a tea and applying a poultice made from its 
leaves you can permanently cure the worst case of neuralgia that ever existed. 
Give it a trial and be convinced. 

2. Salt and Alum. — Press equal parts of salt and pulverized alum into 
the cavity of the tooth. 

3. Magic Tooth Drops. — Take 2 ounces of alcohol; 1% ounces of sul- 
phuric ether ; 1 ounce each of chloroform and camphor gum ; Yz ounce each of 
laudanum, oil of sassafras and oil of cloves and 1 dram of lavender. The 
person sending this recipe says he puts it up in small bottles, calls it " Magic 
Tooth Drops " and sells it for 35c. per bottle, 'i'o one suffering with toothache 
it is worth many times this price. Rub on gums frequently or insert in tooth. 

4. Creosote and Oil of Cloves. — ^Wet a piece of cotton with a drop of 
either creosote or the oil of cloves and insert in the cavity of the tooth. Be 
careful not to let the creosote touch the mouth. 

5. Rum, Brandy, Whiskey, Etc. — If the toothache comes from decayed 
teeth it may be relieved by holding rum, brandy, whiskey or diluted tincture 
of cayenne in the mouth. It will also help to apply laudanum or a mustard 
plaster externally. 

6. Chloroform, Cinnamon, Cloves and Creosote. — ^To half an ounce of 
chloroform add half a dram each of oil of cinnamon, oil of cloves and creosote 
and with a little piece of cotton bathe the gums on both sides of the tooth 
and if there is a cavity insert some of the cotton which has been wet with the 
mixture. 

7. Raisin and Mustard. — Split a raisin, put a little mustard on the sticky 
side and apply to the aching tooth or gum. It will draw out all the soreness. 

8. Raising and Figs. — Boil either a raisin or a small fig in milk and 
apply to the tooth while hot. 

PEOPLE'S HOME REMEDIES FOR TEETHING. 

(Also see Baby Department.) 

1. Ice. — ^The pain of teething will be greatly relieved by allowing the 
child to hold small splinters of ice in its mouth. The child's health will also 
be benefited. A mother living in Kentucky writes that after hours of fret- 
fulness her baby would become quiet immediately after giving ice in this 
manner. 

2. Rubbing. — Rub the gums freely with the finger or a piece of rubber. 

PEOPLE'S HOME REMEDIES FOR BAD BREATH. 

1. Tooth Brush. — Bad breath often comes from unclean teeth and can 
be cured by the use of the brush. 

2. Charcoal. — Take a teaspoonful of powdered charcoal in a glass of 
water every other morning before breakfast. 



DISEASES OF THE EYE, EAR, NOSE, THROAT AND MOUTH. 261 

3. Roasted Coffee and Corn. — Chew either roasted coffee or roasted 
corn for a bad breath. 

4. Catarrh Treatment. — Treat the catarrh which causes it. 



TOOTH POWDER AND PASTE. 

Mix very finely powdered charcoal with castile soap and apply with a 
brush. Some mix the charcoal with honey. Be sure the charcoal is very 
finely powdered. 



DEFORMITIES, MALIGNANT GROWTHS 
AND OPERATIONS. 



Operations. — Almost every paper we read contains an account of some 
operation. The opinion is gaining ground that there are too many operations. 
Is it necessary to operate so often? There is no doubt that there are both 
good and harm done. Conservatism as to operations is gaining ground and 
the best physicians now believe that they should be performed only as a 
last resort after other means have failed. Unfortunately, however, there are 
some few things in which it is known that all other means of treatment will 
fail and then an operation is demanded and, of course, if it is absolutely 
necessary to operate, the earlier the operation is performed the better will be 
the results. 

Appendicitis. — In the past too many' operations have been performed 
for appendicitis. Every case does not need an operation. The pendulum has 
swung too far toward indiscriminate operations but by the best physicians it 
is now being brought back within proper limits. The best plan is to wait, 
say 36 hours, and then operate, if necessary, but if the patient is then getting 
better the chances are that no operation will be necessary. Lives have been 
saved by operations for appendicitis, but, on the other hand, many healthy 
appendices have been removed. That little organ may be good for something; 
else why did nature put it there? Watch temperature and test blood often. 

Malignant Growths. — Many growths may be removed without the knife 
and it is not wise to resort to an operation unless it be absolutely necessary; 
yet, if the growth be a genuine cancer then an operation will be demanded 
and the sooner it be performed, the better. If you have a suspicious lump or 
sore, go early to a doctor in whom you have confidence and one who is not 
only a capable physician but is honest and can be trusted. Tell him freely 
and fully your exact condition and conceal nothing. Do not go to quacks who 
make preposterous claims in the papers or who offer to perform a cure for 
so much money. I have cured " so called cancers " with a salve but I never 
cured a genuine cancer with medicine, and in thirty years of practice I have 
never seen one cured that way. Medicines and salves are helpful for many 
bad looking sores and ulcers that are commonly called cancers but for a real 
cancer the knife is the only cure and the sooner it is applied the better it will 
be. The X-Ray may be brought into use but it should be carefully used by a 
reliable man or much harm may be the result. 

Cancers of Lip, Tongue, Face, Etc. — The medical profession has called a 
halt upon indiscriminate operating and conservatism is rapidly gaining ground 
and yet conservatism must not be carried too far. For instance, if you have 
a cancer on the Up or tongue or on almost any part of the body for that 
matter, it should be operated on early ; there is no time to lose. The tobacco 
pipe, by its constant irritation, is frequently the cause of cancer of the lip. I 
believe smoking was the cause of General Grant's death. As much as I am op- 
posed to unnecessary operations, I cannot advise too strongly in favor of an 
early operation for malignant growths of this character.

DEFORMITIES, MALIGNANT GROWTHS AND OPERATIONS. 263 

Cancer of the Womb and Stomach. — Cancers of the stomach are hard to 
get at and yet some wonderful operations have recently been performed upon 
this organ. What I have said in regard to early operations for the removal 
of cancers from the lips and tongue also applies to cancers of the womb. Sus- 
picious looking ulcers of the womb should always be carefully watched and 
their exact nature should be made certain by examination. Many a woman's 
life has been saved by an early operation in cases of this kind and untold 
pain and misery have been prevented. The trouble in these cases is that 
people wait too long. 

Tiunors and Cancers of the Breast. — Tumors of the breast in women are 
always suspicious and safety demands their removal. If done early the result 
is good. What has previously been said regarding the early removal of 
cancers applies also to cancers of the breast. 

Tumors of the Ovaries and Tubes. — Operations on these organs have done 
much good and they have also done much harm. There is now more descrimi- 
nation in operating on the ovaries and the results show that conservatism 
pays. Of course when the tumors attain much size and the woman begins to 
fail in health and strength, an operation should be performed, if possible, for 
such tumors will not fade away. One summer, not long ago, my wife and I 
made a visit to my old home in Pennsylvania. A neighbor woman there had 
a tumor of the right ovary and was fearfully dropsical. I urged her to have 
an operation as I believed she could not get well without it. After delaying 
as long as she could she submitted to an operation and is now well and happy. 
Years ago tapping would have been resorted to and would have been done 
again and again with no permanent relief. 

Eight years ago I saw a young woman whose right ovary was enlarged 
but only to about the size of a small walnut. Her womb was also tipped 
back. Although an operation had been advised in this case also, I did not 
deem it necessary, as in the case above. I restored the womb and put in a 
support and have given her medicine quite regularly since then. Her ovary 
is reduced in size and she is in comfortable health. Whether an operation is 
necessary or not depends upon the nature of the case and, as I have said before, 
it will pay to go to a capable and honest physician and tell him fully about 
your exact condition. 

Growths in the Mouth and Nose. — Whenever a child has growths in the 
nose like polypi or enlarged turbinated bones or growths in the throat like 
adenoids or enlarged tonsils, and these growths cause catarrh, headaches, af- 
fections of the ear, and are obstructions to breathing, causing the child to 
breathe through the mouth, then these growths should be removed early and 
a new child will be the result. Oftentimes a child which is stupid and back- 
ward in' its school work would be as bright and keen as the rest were these 
foreign growths removed. Under "Diseases of the Eye, Ear, Nose, Throat 
and Mouth" you will find more regarding adenoids and enlarged tonsils. The 
removal of these growths will not only make the child brighter but it will en- 
joy .better health as well. 

Birthmarks, Hare Lip, Cleft Palate, Tongue Tie and Cross Eyes. — These 
deformities should all be attended to when the child is young. Some of the 
operations for the correction of these deformities are very simple and it is a 
shame to let a child go through life with these disfigurements if it is possible 
to correct them. You have no right to let a child go through life with 'cross 
eyes or a hare lip. 



364 THE PEOPLE'S HOME MEDICAL BOOK. 

Cataract and Film on the Eye,— .The latter is very easily removed an.d 
without much pain. The only thing to do for cataracts is to let them 
mature, or get " ripe," and then have them removed. Unless the cataract was 
caused by an injury to the eye the results of an operation are generally good 
and though you will have to wear glasses after the operation you will be a 
new person. 

Mastoid Disease and Inflammation of the Middle Ear. — These troubles 
must be carefully watched. Any person with a constant discharge from his 
ear may at any time have serious trouble. The operation on the mastoid 
bone for mastoiditis has saved many lives. Persons of a tuberculous tendency 
who have ear trouble need constant watching and especially when the trouble 
becomes quite painful or when there are symptoms of brain disease. 

Piles, Tuberculous Glands and Diseased Bones. — Operations for these 
should be performed only when other means have failed. The operation for 
piles is sometimes quite successful but often other treatments will make this 
operation unnecessary. This also applies to operations for diseased bones. 

Varicose Veins. — This has been treated in another place. Sometimes, 
when other treatments fail and the enlarged veins give much trouble, benefit 
will be derived from the removal of one or more of the veins. 

Hip Joint Disease — Tuberculosis of Hip Joint — Morbus Coxarius. — ^This 
is much more common in children than in adults. 

Symptoms. — There is slight lameness at first and pain is complained 
of in the hip, the thigh, or more frequently, at the knee. There is a dwindHpg, 
or shrinking of the muscles of the thigh and the child does not care to play 
much. The leg is apparently lengthened and by this time the parents can see 
that there is something terribly wrong. Don't wait, but do something. 

Treatment. — The sooner treatment is begun the better it will be for 
the patient. Attend to the disease at once and you may save a crippled child. 
Give the child absolute rest and employ a good physician. 

White Swelling — Tuberculosis of the Knee Joint — Other Joint Diseases. 
— Next to the hip, the knee is the joint most frequently affected. The disease 
is of tuberculous origin the same as the disease of the elbow or hip joint. 

Treatment. — Apply a splint or a plaster of Paris cast. Walk only 
with crutches and do not touch the ground with the foot of the diseased leg. 
White swelling is frequently cured in this way. Give strengthening medicines 
and build up the constitution. Give blood remedies and allow the patient to 
rest. These instructions apply, also, to other joint diseases. 

Crooked Feet — Club Feet — Talipes.^These should be attended to while 
young. A great many can be straightened without an operation though the 
operation is very successful. The parents of a child with crooked feet are 
guilty of absolute cruelty if they will not have them straightened while the 
child is young. 

Knock Knees and Bowlfegs — Genu Valgum and Genu Varimi. — ^These 
should also, be attended to in early childhood. They are generally dye to 
rickets. 

Treatment. — ^The child needs strengthening medicines and good food 
and plenty of out-door exercise. These deformities are very successfully 
treated but they should be treated early. Don't force the babies to walk too 
soon for their bones are soft ajid wiU bend and at least cause a slight bowing of 
the legs. 



DEFORMITIES, MALIGNANT GROWTHS AND OPERATIONS. 265 

Hammer Finger and Toe,-^The treatment is to take off the joint which 
ts bent down for it is annoying, painful and a great deformity. 

Rupture — Hernia. — 

Causes. — Ruptures are caused by heavy lifting or straining, by falls, and 
even by severe coughing, such as is common with whooping cough. 

Description and Symptoms. — A rupture or hernia is the coming out of 
part of the intestines and their covering through one of the natural openings 
in the wall of the abdomen near the groin or the navel. They occur oftener 
in males than in females and babies sometimes have them. Ruptures are 
reducible, irreducible or strangulated. 

Reducible Hernia. — This is one that can be forced back into place. To 
do this you should lie on your back and sometimes it will go down itself. If 
it does not you should bend the leg and lift it up and at the same time gently 
force the bowels back with your fingers, moving your leg up and in slowly. 
You will feel the hernia slowly going back. It may take half an hour to 
get it all in place. 

Irreducible Hernia. — This is one that cannot be put back in place. It 
cannot be put back because it is so large and the opening has become con- 
stricted. 

Strangulated Hernia. — ^This is an irreducible hernia where the constric- 
tion is so great that the circulation is shut off and it becomes inflamed. This 
will cause nausea and vomiting and an operation should be performed as 
early as possible. 

Treatment for Hernia. — Wear a perfect fitting support or truss. A truss 
will cure many cases. The injection treatment is simply a temporary help. 
It produces inflammation around the opening and partly closes it, but in six 
months or a year the rupture will be as bad as ever. The same treatment 
applies to either hernia near the groin or rupture at the navel. The operation 
is very successful for ruptures and should be performed where the truss fails 
to effect a cure. 

Gall Stones. — The operation for gall stones is very successful. The gall 
bladder is opened and the stone.« taken out. 

Circumcision and Operation on Clitoris. — Circumcision is the removal of 
a part of the foreskin of a male. Sometimes the hood of the clitoris of the female 
needs to be cut or drawn back. Sometimes the foreskin or the hood of the 
clitoris is so tight as to cause irritation and keep the passions excited and per- 
haps they are a cause of masturbation. When such is the case these operations 
should be performed. Parents should carefully look after these conditions 
as they, instead of a depraved mind, are the causes of many immoral practices. 



POISONS. 

Symptoms, Antidotes and Emergency Remedies 



What to Do in Case of Poisoning. — Give the antidote at once and then 
give the emetic if one is needed. If for any reason the emetic cannot be 
given until some time after the poison has been taken, it should not be given 
at all for the poison will then have had time to be absorbed into the system 
and the emetic would then do no good but, on the other hand, would do injury 
by weakening the patient. In case of poisoning act quickly for there is 
no time to lose. 

" What Not to Do " in Case of Poisoning. — Do not get excited. Do not 
lose time. Do not cause vomiting or use the stomach pump if the poisoning 
is due to some corrosive acid. 

Acid or Corrosive Poisoning. — The mineral acids destroy the walls of the 
gullet and stomach. They do not cause death as a result of their being ab-* 
sorbed into the system but as a result of their destruction of the structures 
with which they come iij contact. Some of them, however, produce mapy 
dangerous changes in the general system. Some, like carbolic acid, destroy 
life by paralyzing the nervous system and particularly the nerves of the heart. 

The first drink to give in corrosive poisoning like poisoning from car- 
bolic acid, corrosive sublimate or any of the mineral acids, is something muci- 
laginous or of a soothing nature. Whites of eggs, milk, flaxseed tea, slippery 
elm water, etc., are mucilaginous drinks. The stomach pump is dangerous 
when the poisoning is due to a corrosive poison as forcing the tube into the 
stomach might increase the local danger by puncturing the gullet or stomach. 
This refers to poisoning from carbolic acid, nitric acid, hydrochloric or muri- 
atic acid, sulphuric acid, acetic acid, corrosive sublimate, etc. 

Neither should the pump be used after poisoning by strong alkalies as 
they also injure the mucous membrane of the gullet and stomach and the tube 
might do further injury. Emetics would also increase the damage done. 
Acid poisons are neutralized, or overcome somewhat, by alkalies. Soda, mag- 
nesia, chalk, and soap are alkalies. Poisoning by alkalies can be somewhat 
overcome by giving vegetable acids. Lemon juice and vinegar are vegetable 
acids. Water is also useful when given in large quantities. 

Antidotes You Should Always Keep on Hand. — Antidotes are medicines 
given to counteract, or overcome, the effects of poisons. Besides soda, mag- 
nesia, chalk, eggs, flaxseed, milk, soap, lard, alum, mustard, tea, lemons and" 
vinegar, every family should keep on hand some sulphate of copper in two- 
grain doses put up in ppwders. This is especially good for poisoning by 
matches or phosphorus. Tannin, or tannic acid, is another good thing to al- 
ways have handy. It is usually given in one-third teaspoonful doses. Jeau- 
nel's Solution is another good thing to keep handy for emergencies as it is 
good for a number of poisons. It is composed of 2 ounces of calcined mag- 
nesia, 1 ounce of animal charcoal and 30 ounces of water. 

Emetics and Other Ways of Producing Vomiting. — Emetics are things 

366 



POISONS AND ANTIDOTES. 267 

used to produce vomiting. Mustard, alum, lard, salt and fat drippings are 
emetics because they produce vomiting. The dose of mustard is a table- 
spoonful in half a cup of lukewarm water. This is to he repeated in from 
10 to 15 minutes if necessary. Give alum in from ^^ to 1 teaspoonful doses 
dissolved in a little warm water. Enough goose grease, lard or fat should be 
given to cause sickness and vomiting. A tablespoonful or a little more will 
generally give results. Two teaspoonfuls of common salt dissolved in a 
wineglassful of lukewarm water will often produce vomiting. In most 
cases of poisoning an emetic is needed unless the poisoning is caused by 
corrosive or burning acids. If you have an antidote handy, give it first and 
then quickly get your mustard, salt, alum, lard or other emetic and give it 
in the doses mentioned to produce vomiting. Syrup of ipecac is a good emetic 
and if you have it in the house you can give it in teaspoonful doses and 
repeat every 10 or 15 minutes until the desired effect is produced. ■ 

If you use goose grease, lard or drippings you should first heat them 
until they become liquid. Of course more than a tablespoonful of these may 
be given if necessary as they are not poispnous. Give them without putting 
them into water but give lukewarm water afterwards. Use these as men- 
tioned until the doctor comes and in most cases you will have done a good 
thing and the doctor, when he arrives, can give the medicines needed. 

If you are far from a house, or if for any reason there is no emetic handy, 
you can produce vomiting very quickly by tickling the back of the throat with 
a feather or with the finger. 

Another good way to produce vomiting is to put a rubber tube down the 
throat. This is to be used only in cases where the poisoning is not caused 
by corrosive poisons. Take the hard nozzle off of the rubber tube of a foun- 
tain or bulb syringe. Some nozzles screw on and if it is one of that kind, 
the part into which the nozzle screws must also be taken off so that nothing 
but the soft rubber tube is used. A soft rubber catheter is also good but 
the wire must be taken out before using. Put the patient in a chair if 
possible or lift him up in bed. Oil the rubber tube, then have the patient 
open his mouth or open it yourself by force and put a tooth brush or knife 
handle in to keep it open. Turn the head a little back and up and slip the 
tube into the mouth and gently push it down the gullet. The tickling will 
produce gagging but keep on and the patient will soon vomit. If you use 
a catheter, tie a strong string to it as it may be short and the string will keep 
it from going too far. If you cannot get the mouth open, and sometimes the 
patient will not let you, insert the tube in the nostril and gently push it and 
when it reaches the back part of the throat it will turn down. Of course this is 
not pleasant for the patient but this will not be a time to consider tastes. When 
the tube tickles the gullet it will cause forceful vomiting, throwing out the 
tube as well as the contents of the stomach. For this reason, it is well when 
using the tube not to stand directly in front of the patient. 

ACETIC, NITRIC, SULPHURIC AND HYDROCHLORIC OR 
MURIATIC ACIDS. 

Symptoms. — All these acids act somewhat alike. There is intense burning 
in the throat, gullet and stomach. The patient finds it hard to swallow and 
he sometimes vomits the contents of the stomach which look like coffee 
grounds mixed with shreds of mucus and blood. The pulse is quick, weak 
and generally thready. 



268 THE PEOPLE'S HOME MEDICAL BOOK. 

What to Do. — Emetics are dangerous so do not use them. Give soda, 
chalk, magnesia or soap. These should be dissolved in water and should be 
followed with flaxseed tea, slippery elm tea, sassafras tea, milk, or whites of 
eggs and whichever of these you use it should be followed freely with castor 
oil. 

ACONITE— MONKSHOOD— WOLFSBANE. 

Symptoms. — ^The skin and fingers tingle and feel numb. The throat feels 
contracted and that makes it difficult to either swallow or speak. The patient 
looks anxious and worried. The skin is dry at first and in the later stages 
it may be moist. 

What to Do. — First, give a third of a teaspoonful of tannic acid dissolved 
in half a glass of water. Then put the patient flat on his back with his head 
lower than his feet. Then inject digitalis hypodermically ; or, if you do not 
have digitalis, inject alcohol. Put hot bricks or hot water bottles around him. 
Whiskey or brandy may also be given. Use artificial respiration if necessary. 
Directions for doing this are given under " Drowning." 

ALCOHOL. 

Symptoms. — These are too well known to need description. 

What to Do. — Produce vomiting by giving lukewarm mustard water, 
using from 1 to 4 teaspoonfuls of mustard ; or, give one or two teaspoonfuls 
of alum dissolved in lukewarm water ; or, give lard or salt or produce vomit- 
ing by tickling the throat. You may also give strong coffee. Apply cold to 
the head and warmth to the arms and legs. Use artificial respiration if neces- 
sary. This is described under " Drowning." 

AMMONIA WATER OR SPIRITS OF HARTSHORN^LYE— 
CAUSTIC POTASH. 

Ssrmptoms. — There is great distress and burning pain along the gullet and

ACID— ROUGH ON RATS— PARIS GREEN— ARSENATE OF 

COPPER. 

S3niiptoms. — There is a red, dry, raw and thirsty-looking tongue. There 
is terrible thirst and a burning feeling in the stomach and bowels. The pa- 
tSfent is very restless and uneasy. There is vomiting of a watery, burning 
liquid and there are burning stools. The patient is very weak- 



POISONS AND Antidotes. , 269 

What to Do.— rGive Jeaunel's Solution as an antidote if you have it, then 
give some emetic suqIi as mustard, lard, alum or goose grease; or, produce

scattering tumors, stimulating, checking mortification, lessening inflammation, 
hastening the formation of pus or drawing poison from wounds. 

1. Soothing Poultices. — Poultices of bread ancl milk, flaxseed, corn 
meal or slippery elm are used where a soothing effect is desired as they re- 
tain heat and moisture a long time. The bread and milk and flaxseed poul- 
tices are best for boils, felons and abscesses when they are forming. After 
the matter begins to discharge the slippery elm poultice should be used. 
Slippery elm is also best for deep ulcers and carbuncles. 

3. Stimulating Poultices. — Mustard poultices are stimulating as also

soft poultice and then add 2 drams of powdered charcoal and when the poul- 
tice is prepared sprinkle another dram of powdered charcoal over the surface 
of it before applying. 

13. Flaxseed Poultice. — While water is boiling add flaxseed to it very 
slowly until it becomes as thick as porridge. Continue the heat with con- 
stant stirring for 10 minutes, then spread on cotton and cover with gauze or 
cheese cloth which makes the covering next to the skin. Cover the whole 
with silk or flannel to retain the heat and if necessary, bandage snugly to 
keep it from slipping. Renew when cool. 

14. Bran Poultice. — When a light but thick poultice is required, bran 
should be boiled in water and placed in a bag and tied tightly. Press out the 
surplus water and apply to the parts. Cover well as it cools quickly. 

15. Hop Poultice. — ^Use hops instead of bran and make and apply in the 
same way. 

16. Spice Poultice. — Mix equal parts of ground cinnamon, cloves, all- 
spice and ginger and if you wish to have it very strong you can add i/4 part 
of cayenne pepper. Place this in a flannel bag and spread evenly and wet 
with alcohol or whiskey before applying. This will last for a long time by re- 
wetting. It is fine for pains in the abdomen.

are used either warm or cold. Some medicine is added to water or some 
herb is steeped in water and cloths are then wrung out of it and applied. Or, 
herbs are steeped, put into a bag, and applied hdt. Cloths wrung out of hot 
or cold water either clear or medicated are sometimes called compresses.

ture is usually added to half a pint of water. Compresses or fomentations 



LINIMENTS, OILS, SALVES, ETC. 385 

should be changed frequently to keep them either hot or cold as desired.

or lobelia and stramonium leaves to the hops and applying in the same way. 

5. Mullein. — Fomentations of mullein leaves are excellent for bruises 
and swellings. 

6. Turpentine Stupe. — Sprinkle a few drops of turpentine on a flannel 
cloth which has first been wrung out of hot water. Apply this as hot as pos- 
sible and cover well with oiled silk and dry flannels. Change often to keep 
it warm. Turpentine should not be applied after the skin is reddened. 

POWDERS. 

When a single ingredient is pulverized it is called a simple powder and 
when two or more ingredients are pulverized and mixed together it is called 
a compound powder. Powders should be kept in air tight bottles or cans 
and some of them need to be protected from the light. This can be done by 
painting the bottle black. There are many different kinds of powders and 
you will find many of them described in the treatment of various diseases 
and in the preparation of the herbs. 

1. Compound Powder of Rhubarb. — Mix thoroughly 3 ounces of pow- 
dered rhubarb, a pound of magnesia and an ounce of pulverized ginger. Keep 
in air tight bottles. This is a standard remedy used by physicians for bowel

the bowels and the ginger stimulates the membrane to action.

VALUABLE PRESCRIPTIONS FOR MAKING SECRET 
PREPARATIONS. 



In the preparation of this department we are indebted to the Secretary 
of tlie American Medical Association for references to the Leading Medical 
Journals of the world who have had these medicines chemically analyzed. 
Patent medicine manufacturers sometimes change their formulas slightly 
so as to avoid having them become public, so all we can claim is that these 
prescriptions will make preparations which are similar to the originals in 
their action and uses. We have tried to give only the most valuable ones 
and though Dr. Ritter did not compile this department we have employed 
one of the best analytical chemists in the country to carefully go over the 
prescriptions with the view of eliminating the harmful ones and adding the 
uses and doses of each as otherwise the prescriptions would be of little value.

this is true in adding more water, which should be quite warm, until the full pint is made. 
If the oils do not emulsify readily, it is necessary to begin over again, as either too 
much oil was added at first, or the water was not warm enough. Strict attention must 
t>e paid to both of these considerations in order to insure success.

HERB DEPARTMENT. 



Gathering and Drying Herbs. — Roots ought to be dug in the fall after the 
roots and leaves are dead or have come to maturity; or, they should be dug 
before they start in the spring. They ought to be washed immediately after 
they are dug, or not washed at all. Some roots are injured by being put into 
water, especially those of an aromatic nature. All roots, when cleaned, ought 
to be put in a place where they will dry soon. They should not be placed in 
the sun but in a dry apartment where they will be placed under the influetice 
of fire heat, as on an upper floor while fire is kept below. As soon as they 
are perfectly dry they ought to be packed away and kept from the air as much 
as possible. 

HOW HERBS ARE MADE INTO MEDICINES. 

Teas or Infusions. — These are made by pouring boiling water on the plant 
or bark and allowing it to steep for a short time until the water cools, after 
which the liquid is strained. Sometimes cold water is used. Infusions are 
made by steeping like tea. The infusion is generally better than the decoction 
as boiling destroys the virtue of some herbs. Usually, from 1 to 4 ounces of 
the herb should be used to a pint of boiling water. 

Decoctions. — A decoction is a solution made by boiling the herb in water 
and straining while hot. Decoctions are made by boiling like coffee. 

Cerates. — Cerates are ointments containing 30 parts of beeswax to 70 parts 
of lanolin or some other substance to make them harder for use. They are 
used for piles, etc. Cerates are used where you do not desire a quick dis- 
solving of the lanolin or other base. 

Ointments. — Ointments are made without beeswax and are softer than 
cerates and are good for local application. The base is vaseline or cosmoline, 
They are made with some kind of fatty substance like vaseline or lanolin 
(sheep's oil). The medicine is rubbed into the base. Ointments dissolve 
readily. 

Extracts. — Extracts are made by taking the soluble parts from 1he plant. 
This is done by allowing them to stand in water or alcohol. Extracts consist 
of the soluble parts of plants reduced to a semi-solid condition by evaporation. 

Fluid Extracts. — These are made in the same way as solid extracts 
except that they are not so completely evaporated. 

Syrups. — These are solutions of sugar in water or sometimes in gummy 
substances. To make a syrup of plants, add simple syrup to the infusion when 
hot and somewhat evaporated and then bottle while hot. In other words, first 
make a tea of the plant and then add sugar. 

Powders. — Barks or dried herbs are finely broken up or ipulverized to 
make powders. 

Tinctures. — Tinctures are solutions of the medical properties of herbs in 
alcohol or in mixtures of alcohol and water. Take the fresh or dried herb, 
chop and pound, and to I ounce of the herb add 2 ounces of water and 3 ounces 

304 



HERB DEPARTMENT. 305 

of alcohol. Allow the mixture to stand in a bottle from 8 to 14 days in a cool 
place. Then turn off the liquid carefully and bottle for use. 

Fomentations. — These are plants applied locally in infusion or decoction. 
Put the herbs into a bag and steep and then wring the bag out of theMiquid 
and apply hot. This will hold heat longer than cloths. Fomentations are 
bags oi herbs wrung out of hot herb teas and applied to the affected parts. 

Liniments. — ^These are made with oily substances often mixed with power- 
ful drugs. 

Suppositories. — These are small masses made into a cone shape. The 
medicine is usually mixed with cocoa butter and they are designed for use 
in the rectum or vagina.

amenorrhea, and flatulent colic. For the tea use 1 ounce of the herb to a 
pint of water. The dose is from 4 to 6 ounces 3 or 4 times a day. The dose 
of the oil is from 10 to 20 drops.

fresh root, bruised in cream, lard or fresh butter, forms an excellent oint- 
ment for scrofulous ulcers, itch and indolent glandular swellings. 



A CHAPTER FOR MEN. 



It does not pay for a young man to " sow his wild oats." The transient 
pleasure of a moment may mean the suffering of a lifetime. Though a young 
man may sow his wild oats for some time and apparently escape retribution, 
or he may contract a disease and be apparently cured, yet, on the other hand, 
one indiscretion may mean the ruining of his health and perhaps later the 
health of his wife also. 

Preventive treatment is the best kind of treatment for the diseases of 
men. Gonorrhea and syphilis are the results of immorality and uncleanli- 
ness. Do not expose yourself to these loathsome diseases. However, if you 
have been exposed, at least observe the laws of cleanliness and immediately 
wash the exposed parts thoroughly with some good antiseptic solution like 
carbolic acid, corrosive sublimate or permanganate of potash. Do not' wait 
an hour, or even ten minutes, but use one of these solutions at once and even 
then you are taking great chances of disease. Abstinence and cleanliness are 
the preventives of these diseases. 

GONORRHEA. 
(Including Chordee, Bubo, Clap, Gleet and Stricture.) 

This disease is commonly known as the " clap." 

CAUSES. — The cause is generally intercourse with one afflicted with 
this disease. It may sometimes be caught from towels, etc., used by one 
having the disease. It is then likely to make itself manifest in the eyes, etc. 
Though many cases of gonorrhea are apparently recovered from yet the 
disease is often improperly treated and, though apparently cured, it still 
exists and a man who has once had the disease may, a long time afterward, 
infect his wife and this is a much more serious disease in women than in men. 
In women, this disease is often the cause of diseases of the ovaries, tubes 
and womb. 

SYMPTOMS. — The first symptoms of this disease are usually noticed 
between the second and seventh day after exposure. At first there is noticed 
a tickling or uneasiness at the opening of the urethra or at the end of the 
penis. The organ is found to be somewhat reddened and the mucous dis- 
charge is more viscid than usual and increased in quantity. This discharge 
becomes yellowish or greenish in color and is thick. The heat, redness, 
swelling and pain increase. The passing of water becomes frequent and 
is attended with a great deal of pain. 

Chordee is often a marked characteristic of this disease. The erections 
become frequent and are very painful .and the organ is bent downward. 

Bubo, or swelling' of the glands in the groin, is sometimes a feature but 
these glands seldom suppurate, or result in abscess. 

Orchitis, or inflammation of the testicles, is frequently observed as a fea- 
ture of this disease. 

Gleet is the chronic form of Gonorrhea and is obstinate to treat. 

Stricture, or closing of the passage, is often caused by inflammation or 
the use of medicines, It is attended with painful urination. 

359 



360 THE PEOPLE'S HOME MEDICAL BOOK. . 

Under good treatment the disease is likely to last from a month to six 
weeks and if improperly treated it often lasts for months. 
TREATMENT.— 

Preventive treatment is the best and consists in observing cleanliness and 
not exposing yourself. However, in case you have contracted the disease 
it is extremely necessary that you begin treatment at once and without delay. 
Do not get a quack to treat you but get a good physician. Stay in bed for a 
week and take mild drinks in large quantities. Teas made from slippery elm, 
pumpkin seed, flaxseed or buchu leaves are excellent. Drink plenty of water. 
Eat no meats or rich and highly seasoned foods and drink no alcohol in any 
form but live on milk alone. Keep the bowels open freely. Follow this treat- 
ment and yen will soon be well. 

Wash the organ frequently with warm water. If you have much pain or 
chordee use suppositories in the rectum. The following is good for this pur- 
pose. Take 6 grains of pulverized opium, 18 grains of pulverized camphor 
and enough oil of cacao to mix well. Mix these ingredients and make into 
6 suppositories and use one at bed time. Remember that this constipates so 
move the bowels with an injection before going to bed. 

For the pain while passing urine put the penis into hot water. Keep the 
glans penis wrapped in absorbent cotton and be sure to burn this cotton and 
use every care not to get the dischai^ges into the eyes or upon other mucous 
surfaces. 

If you wish to use an injection get a blunt pointed, hard rubber, urethra]^ 
syringe holding 3 fluid drams. Nitrate of silver, zinc chloride, permanganate 
of potash, salicylic acid and creosote are very irritating and may do harm. 
The following is a good injection. Take 1/10 grain of hydrargyri chloridi cor- 
rosivi, 18 grains of zinc sulpho-carbolat., 2 ounces of glyceriti boroglycernii 
(31 per cent, boric acid) and 4 ounces of aquae rosse. Mix, shake thoroughly 
and use from 1 to 8 drams as an injection once a day. If the urethra is very 
irritable you can use from 18 to 24 grains of the watery extract of opium 
added to the above prescription. 

Later the following injection may be used in place of the one above. Use 
an ounce or two a day. Take 1 dram of zinc acetate, 1 dram of tannic acid, 3 
drams of boric acid and 6 ounces of aqua hydrogen dioxid. 

For early use when the penis is too sensitive to stand a stronger injection 
the following will be found good. Take 2 drams of boric acid, 18 grains of 
aqpeous extract of opium, and 6 ounces of the dilute solution of subacetate 
of lead. Mix and use 1 dram once or twice a day. If there is any sensitive- 
ness left the following may be used. Take 1 grain of morph. sulph., 20 grains 
of zinc sulpho carbolate and 4 ounces of rose water. Use a syringeful at a 
time as an injection twice a day. Or, the following may be used as an injec- 
tion in the same way. Take 20 grains of zinc sulph. carbolat, 12 drops of acid 
hydrocyanic dil. and 4 ounces of aquse rosse. Or, this is a good one. Mix 
1 dram of R. ext. hydrastis with 1 ounce of aquse rosa;. Use a teaspoonful of 
this solution at each injection. It will stain the clothing if it comes in con- 
tact with it. It may be used twice a day and is also good for gleet. If in- 
jections do not help gleet the best treatment is the regular passing of sounds 
by a competent physician. 

During the first 10 days the following is a good injection for gonorrhea. 
Take 5 grains of hydrastinae hydrochloride, 5 grains of protargol, lYz drams 
of glycerine and 1 ounce of aquae distillat qs. ad. f. Precede with a hot water 



A CHAPTER FOR MEN. 361 

injection and use from 4 to 6 times a day. Retain the injection from 5 to 10 
mmutes each time. 

After the first 10 days or after the first stage has passed use 5 grains of 
the commercial hydrastine to an ounce of water. Use from 1 to 3 drams of 
this as an injection once or twice a day. 
PEOPLE'S HOME REMEDIES.— 

1. Parsley. — For painful urination and gonorrhea. Dose of infusion — 
from 2 to 4 ounces 3 or 4 times a day. 

2. Quince Seeds. — Drinis freely of a decoction of quince seeds. 

3. Cranesbiir and Blood Root. — Make a decoction by using 3 parts of 
cranesbill to 1 part of blood root and use as an injection for gonorrhea. A 
good remedy. 

SYPHILIS. 
Pox — ^Lues — (Including Chancre and Chancroid). 

Syphilis is a contagious disease and is either acquired or hereditary. The 
acquired form is divided into 3 stages — primary, secondary and tertiary. The 
virus of the disease is active in the transmission of the malady throughout 
the primary atid secondary stages, and during all this time all secretions from 
the sores are capable of producing the disease in another person provided 
they be brought in contact with a tear or sore in the skin or mucous mem- 
brane. Infection does not take place through healthy skin or mucous mem- 
brane but the break may be so slight as to escape notice. The acquired form 
is not conveyed by the discharges from syphilitic sores or by the blood of 
a syphilitic if five years have elapsed since the date of the first infection. In 
other words, the disease is contagious during the first two stages but not 
during the tertiary stage. 

Hereditary syphilis may come to a child from one or both parents. A 
syphilitic father or mother may be the parent of a syphilitic or a non-syphilitic 
child. If both parents are syphilitic the probability of the child's being af- 
fected is twice as great as if one parent alone is affected. 

The primary sore or lesion of syphilis is called the chancre and develops 
at the point of infection and an ulcer is the result. The secondary stage 
soon develops. The lymph nodes or glands all over the body, notably those 
nearest the chancre, become enlarged and inflamed. Following this is the 
tertiary stage in which the bone covering and internal organs suffer from 
peculiar growths. These growths are usually in circumscribed nodes. They 
(the gummata) may grow to a considerable size. Syphilis causes grave 
changes in the blood vessels, liver, lungs and brain and, in fact, in about all 
the organs of the body. 
SYMPTOMS.— 

First Stage. — ^The patient develops, at the site of the original contact with 
the virus, a small pimple which has an area of hard tissue about its base. This 
is the hard chancre and usually makes its appearance in from 13 to 21 days 
after exposure. The inguinal glands are slightly enlarged. This period lasts 
from 3 days to two weeks and is followed by the secondary stage. The 
chancre is but a local manifestation of the disease. The disease is constitu- 
tional at the very beginning and is not confined to the chancre. The chancre 
is a small hard swelling and disappears with the secondary symptoms whether 
it is treated or not. No pus comes from the chancre^ but if there are false 
chancres, or chancroids, pus may form. Chancroid is a local disease and 



363 IHE PEOPLE'S HOME MEDICAL BOOK. 

these false chancres are soft. Chancroids appear in from 3 to 9 days after 
exposure and there are usually more than one. If more than one true 
chancres appear they all appear at once. 

Secondary Stage. — Fever is an early symptom and sometimes goes to 
104 or 105 degrees but is usually at about 101 degrees. The skin eruptions 
may occur in limited areas or they may be widely distributed over the whole 
body and even involve the face. As this stage advances the eruption may be 
papular and finally pustular. At the angles of the mouth or at the anus there 
come the mucous patches or ulcers. Also warty growths called syphilitic 
condylomata. Falling of the hair sometimes occurs and the finger nails may 
become loosened and drop oS. 

Tertiary Stage. — The skin lesions are more severe than in the secondary 
stage. Gummata come in different parts of the body, developing in the skin 
and internal organs. Lesions of the nervous system usually occur late but 
.may appear in 6 months. They usually come within the first 10 years and 
seldom as late as 20 years. The cases may be mild or very severe. The 
nerve lesions assume many forms of disease. 

TREATMENT. — During the primary and secondary stages, Hare recom- 
mends full doses of protoiodide of mercury in compressed tablet form. The 
dose is ^ grain 3 times a day, increased by 1 or 3 quarters each day until the 
patient shows distinct evidence of the full systemic effect of the drug, as 
shown by loose bowels or tender teeth and slight salivation. (Use tablet 
triturate.) After the effects of the drug are manifest the dose should be dimin- 
ished one-half and kept at this point. If necessary, increase the dose the 
second time if the symptoms of syphilis increase. If necessary, use blue oint- 
ment rubbed into the skin once a day, using 1 dram. Choose a different spot 
each time and rub for a long time. Continue the treatment in other ways 
if necessary. 

For the tertiary stage administer iodide of potash, sodium or strontium. 
It usually requires 100 grains a day. Use a saturated solution (1 grain to 1 
minim of water, dissolved) and give 10 minims in a dessert spoonful of the 
compound syrup of sarsaparilla 3 times a day. Give this dose an hour after 
meals' and increase each day from 1 to 5 drops at a dose. 

A good remedy is to put from % to 1 ounce of iodide of potash into a pint 
of simple syrup and add 3 ounces of each of the following herbs in fluid 
extract form — stillingia, corydalis, yellow dock, burdock, poke root and sarsa- 
parilla. Take a teaspoonful 3 times a day. 

GONORRHEAL RHEUMATISM. 
(Arthritis.) 

Put a splint on the Joint to keep it at rest and apply a 50% ichthyol oint- 
ment on the joint. Give iodide of potash internally. 

NOCTURNAL EMISSIONS. 

After a certain age these emissions are very likely to occur with any man. 
There is no need to be alarmed when they are not too frequent. Quacks make 
money from poor scared creatures wTio are fearful of terrible consequences, 
Once or twice a week will not injure. 

TREATMENT. — Don't worry about them. Don't sleep with too much 
covering. Keep your thoughts from such matters. Sleep on a hard mattress 



A CHAPTER FOR MEN. 363 

At bed time, if you do not sleep well and are nervous and restless, take 20 
grains of bromide of sodium or potassium. Sometimes 1/100 of a grain of 
hyoscine at bed time is good. Avoid stimulating foods and drinks. Bathe 
the scrotum with cold water before retiring. Hop tea is very good when taken 
regularly. 

The homeopathic treatment is to take the second dilution of China and 
the third dilution of phosphoric acid 3 times a day. 

Doctor the mind by not worrying. 

ENLARGED OR INFLAMED PROSTATE GLAND. 

This is a gland in the urethra near the bladder. The gland enlarges some 
in later life and in some cases it enlarges a great deal. In such cases it is 
difficult and sometimes impossible to pass water and a catheter must then be 
used. Gonorrhea sometimes causes prostatitis or inflammation of this gland. 

TREATMENT.— Rest in bed and regulate the bowels. Apply leeches 
to the perineum or apply fomentations of hops. Give mild drinks to render 
the urine mild. An operation may be necessary. 

Homeopathic Treatment. — Give the third trituration of Conium 4 times 
a day. 



WOMAN'S DEPARTMENT. 

DISEASES OF WOMEN. 



DISORDERS OF MENSTRUATION. 



ABSENCE OF MENSES— (AMENORRHEA). 

DESCRIPTION. — This term is applied to those cases in which menstru- 
ation has never appeared. Secondary amenorrhea or suppressed menses is 
applied to those cases in which menstruation has ceased after once having 
been established. 

CAUSES.-- 

1. Defective development of the organs of generation. 

2. Premature atrophy or dwindling of those organs. 

3. Injury and local disease. 

4. Acute and chronic general diseases. 

5. Mental disturbances. 

Menstruation is often absent in typhoid fever. It is commonly absent 
in anemia, chlorosis, consumption and malaria. It frequently results from a, 
change of climate and surroundings and the absence continues until the per- 
son becomes adapted to the new environment. It is seen in immigrants and 
in persons who move from the country into large cities. It is often caused 
by over-work, either physical or mental, and also by an insufficient amount 
and poor quality of food. It is quite common in school girls. 

It is sometimes due to the excessive general development of fat, even 
in young women who are apparently in good general health. It is frequently 
associated with insanity. The fear of pregnancy after illicit intercourse some- 
times produces it. Fright, grief, anxiety, anger and getting wet often cause it. 
In some cases it is hard to discover any cause. Persons subject to it may 
have a general periodical disturbance that marks the times at which the 
flow should occur. 

SYMPTOMS. — There may be headache, flashes of heat, nervousness, 
tiausea and vomiting and a feeling of fullness and pain in the lower bowel. 
Varioits skin eruptions may occur as the result of amenorrhea, as in other 
diseases of the female generative organs. The poor health, both mental and 
physical, that usually accompanies amenorrhea is often thought by the pa- 
tient and her friends to be the result, rather than the cause as it really is, of 
the arrested menses. 

TREATMENT. — This, necessarily, must depeiid upon the cause of the 
condition. If it is due to defective development of the womb and the ovaries, 
little can be done. For this a doctor must be called. Most cases demand 
general toning treatment. Regulate the mode of life. Fresh air, exercise, sun- 
shine, baths and pelvic massage continued for a long time will help. There 
should be less of study and more of active outdoor life. Change of air and 
surroundings is sometimes helpful. 

Allopathic Treatment. — Improve the general condition by giving a prep- 
aration composed of arsenic, iron and nux vomica. Take four tablets a day. 

364 



DISEASES OF WOMEN. 365 

You can buy these, tablets in any drug store. Or, Blaud's piils are also 
very good. Take four pills a day. Fat should be decreased by diet and 
exercise. The bowels should be kept regular. 

Homeopathic Treatment. — Put 15 drops of the second dilution of China , 
into half a glass of water and give 3 teaspoonfuls every 3 hours for weak- 
ness resulting from an acute illness. ■" 

To blonde girls and women give the sixth trituration of Pulsatilla. Give 
3 tablets 4 times a day. 

To brunettes give the sixth trituration of .Sepia. Give 2 tablets 4 times 
a day. 
PEOPLE'S HOME REMEDIES.— 

1. Bitter Tonic. — The following bitter tonic formula is a good one. Take 
1 pound each of poplar bark, golden seal, columbo root and the bark of the root 
or bayberry ; 6 ounces each of capsicum and cloves and 4 pounds of loaf sugar. 
Pulverize all, sift, and mix. The dose is from a teaspoonful to a tablespoonful 
3 times a day. Or, you can put 1 ounce of this mixture into a quart of wine 
and take a wine-glassful 3 times a day. 

2. Baths, Etc. — In case of delayed or obstructed menstruation the patient 
should take a warm foot or hip bath twice a day a few days before the period. 
Upon retiring at night apply warm wet cloths to the lower part of the abdomen. 

ACUTE SUPPRESSION OF MENSES DURING A MENSTRUAL 

PERIOD. 
Causes and Preventive Treatment. — 

The causes are getting wet and chilled. Excitement, grief and anger 
also cause it. Taking cold is another cause of suppression of the menses and 
the flow is sometimes checked by taking vinegar. 

In the chapter for girls special attention is called to the care of girls 
just entering puberty. It might be well, even at the expense of repetition 
to emphasize what is there written. When a girl becomes " unwell " the 
first time she must give special care to herself, in addition to what has been 
taken before this time, in preparing herself physically to enter this period of 
her life. 

She should not do anything that will cause much anxiety, worry, fatigue 
or sleeplessness. She must not study much. Girls frequently over st.udy 
at this time and many are fearfully pale and run down and suffer much 
from headaches. Such girls should be kept out of school. Good health is of 
even more importance than a book education. 

When the flow comes she should be quieter than usual and be careful not 
to take cold. She should not get her feet wet. If her shoes are wet thev must 
be changed immediately. Taking cold is a common cause of the stopping of 
the flow. Some girls and women seem to be able to do almost anything at 
this time but such is not the case with many and even those who do not. suffer 
at the time are likely to reap the effects in later life. 

The idea of a girl's going to school when she is first unwell or at any 
time when she is unwell and sitting for hours with wet shoes, stockings and 
skirts is monstrous and yet this is frequently done. How many girls and 
women go to a dance when they are unwell and dance themselves into a per- 
spiration, then go to a cooler part of the building and sit down without any 
extra wraps ! The result is a cold and the stopping of the flow for that time. 



366 THE PEOPLE'S HOME MEDICAL BOOK. 

The next time the menses are likely to be painful and the flow clotted and 
watery and the girl is in luck if she is able to be up and around. If she 
escapes inflammation of the womb and congestion and inflammation of the 
ovaries she is very fortunate. Girls and women cannot take too good care 
of themselves during the menstrual period. 
TREATMENT.— 

Rest in bed and take good hot foot baths or sitz baths. A sitz bath is 
taken by_ sitting over steam arising from a pail of hot water. Take hot drinks 
or herb teas made from hops,. tansy or pennyroyal. These should be taken 
until they cause free sweating. Apply warm fomentations of hops or other 
herbs to the lower part of the abdomen. The object is to produce sweating and 
if this is done soon after the suppression the flow is very likely to be started 
again. 

Aconite taken in V^-drop doses every hour for 6 hours will also aid. 
Take special care of yourself during the succeeding interval and when it is 
time for the next period. A bitter herb tonic, such as that given for amen- 
orrhea, is good to be taken during the interval if you need upbuilding. Uni- 
corn root, beth root or blessed thistle is also good in the tea form. 

Some years ago a friend called my attention to the virtue of the bark 
of boxwood when made inti*) a tea for girls with disordered menses. My 
friend learned of this through his mother who had a great knowledge of herb 
remedies. Since then I have frequently had occasion to prescribe this tea and 
have found it of great value in such cases. Make the tea by using 2 ounces of. 
the bark of boxwood to a pint of water and drink an ounce of this tea three 
times a day. 

If you are married and the menstruation is very slight when you have 
usually been regular and had a free flow, then it may be that you are preg- 
nant. In ^uch a case, of course, you are not to use anything to bring on the 
flow. The above treatment is only for suppression from the causes above 
given. 
PEOPLE'S HOME REMEDIES.— 

1. Tansy, Hops, Pennyroyal, Ginger, Etc. — For suppression of the menses 
apply hot poultices of tansy and hops to the abdomen and drink freely of 
tansy, pennyroyal, ginger or motherwort tea. These are all good. 

2. Verwine Tea. — For suppressed menses a tea made of verwine root 
IS highly recommended. Take half a teacupful 3 times a day for a few days 
before time for the menses. 

SCANTY MENSTRUATION. 
Causes and Treatment. — 

The causes and treatment are somewhat similar to those given for amen- 
orrhea. Attend to any womb trouble that may be the cause. 

Before leaving the subject of suppressed menstruation from getting wet 
or cold and like cattses I want to impress upon mothers the necessity of 
attending to this trouble immediately. By so doing you will save your 
daughters from much trouble, pain and suflFering. 

EXCESSIVE MENSTRUAL FLOW— (MENORRHAGIA). 
Causes. — The causes are inflammation of the womb, ovaries or tubes; 
fibroids or tumors of the womb ; and debility or a general run down condition. 



DISEASES OF WOMEN. 367 

TREATMENT.— 

Remove the causes by attending to the diseases and build up the system 
with tonics. 

Allopathic Treatment. — Take pills or tablets made of arsenic, iron 
and nux vomica. Take 4 tablets a day. These may be bought at any 
drug store. The compound tincture of cinchona and gentian used together 
as a bitter tonic is also good. Use equal parts of each and take a teaspoonful 
every 4 hours. 

Homeopathic Treatment. — Every 3 hours alternate the second dilution 
li China with the third dilution of Phosphoric Acid. Prepare by putting 
10 or 15 drops of each of these medicines into separate glasses half full 
of water. Give two teaspoonfuls of either at a dose. 

Herb Remedies and Combinations. — The bitter tonic given under amenor- 
rhea is good for this trouble. 

Another good remedy is to take 1 ounce of prickly ash bark, 3 ounces of 
ginger root, 3 ounces of wild cherry bark, 5 ounces of balmony, 5 ounces of 
golden seal, 7 ounces of poplar bark and 2% pounds of good sugar. All are 
to be made fine, sifted, and well mixed. The dose is a heaping teaspoonful 
in a little boiling water 3 times a day. 

Columbo root, orange peel, unicorn, prince's feather and Solomon's seal 
are all good. 

Five drops of oil of fireweed every 1 to 3 hours is very good when the 
bleeding must be stopped quickly. Put this on sugar and take internally. 
This remedy is also very good for dysentery. 

When a girl or woman has menorrhagia from debility, these bitter tonics 
and restorative medicines will do much good. If the trouble is due to fibroid 
tumors of the womb, or to inflammation of the womb, ovaries or tubes, of 
course such conditions must be treated. 
PEOPLE'S HOME REMEDIES.— 

1. General Instructions. — In case of profuse menstruation the patient 
should lie down upon the bed and eat and drink nothing of a stimulating 
nature. Keep the room cool and the patient lightly covered. The feet should 
be put into warm water. If the flow is excessive the hips should be elevated 
higher than the head and cloths wrung out of vinegar and water should be 
applied to the lower part of the abdomen. 

2. Charcoal, Geranium and Alum. — For profuse menstruation take equal 
parts of powdered charcoal, geranium and alum. Mix these and give 15 
grains every 10 or 20 minutes. 

3. Cinnamon and Red Raspberry Leaves. — For profuse menstruation 
drink freely of a tea made of red raspberry leaves and cinnamon bark or cinna- 
mon bark alone. This remedy will be found very effective. 

4. Alum and Nutmeg. — For profuse menstruation a Philadelphia phy- 
sician recommends the following simple but effective prescription. Take 5 
to 20 grains of powdered alum and 2 grains of grated nutmeg. Mix this into 
a powder and give every hour in syrup made of white sugar. 

PAINFUL AND DIFFICULT MENSTRUATION— 
(DYSMENORRHEA). 
CAUSES. — This trouble is very common among girls and women. Tak- 
mg cold at or just before the menstrual period and thus causing suppression 



368 THE PEOPLE'S HOME MEDICAL BOOK. 

or partial suppression of the flow at the time, is one of the causes of this 
trouble and especially is this true if this carelessness is repeated or continued. 
Women should be very careful not to do anything to cause either an entire 
or partial suppression of the menstrual flow. The main causes of this diseasq 
are womb troubles ; laceration or tearing of the neck of the womb, generally 
caused by childbirth ; displacements, backwards and forwards, partially clos- 
ing the cervical canal ; and stenosis which is the almost entire closing of the 
mouth of the womb and consequent narrowing of the cervical canal. In un- 
married women stenosis is the most frequent cause. In married women the 
causes are disease, displacement, inflammation and stenosis. 

SYMPTOMS. — Pain is the main symptom and it is very severe. 
TREATMENT.— 

The treatment is to give hot teas and drinks and hot foot baths or sitz 
baths. Apply the hot water bag over the womb or hot fomentations of hops. 
During the interval the bitter tonic given under " Amenorrhea " is good. For 
the spasms and pain, motherwort, ginger or valerian may be united with other 
herb remedies. The " Mother's Cordial " given under " Leucorrhea " is also 
good to build up the system. First use the means mentioned but if the womb 
is displaced or the canal is too small the doctor must attend the case. It may 
be necessary to dilate the cervical canal or curette the womb. 

Homeopathic Treatment. — Put 10 drops of the first dilution of Cocculus 
into a glass % full of water and give 2 teaspoonfuls every 10 minutes until 
relieved. 

During the intervals 'give one tablet 4 times a day of the third tritura- 
tion of Pulsatilla or use the sixth trituration of Sepia in the same way. 
PEOPLE'S HOME REMEDIES.— 

1. Unicom Root. — It is best in powder or tincture form. Take from 5 
to 10 grains of the powder 3 times a day. The dose of the tincture is 5 drops 
in water 3 times a day and the dose of the fluid extract is from 15 to 20 drops. 
This may be combined with other remedies. 

2. Cramp Bark. — Cramp bark or high cranberry bark is good for pain- 
ful menses. The dose of the decoction is 2 ounces 3 or 3 times a day. The 
dose of the fluid extract is from 15 to 30 drops. This may also be combined 
with other remedies. 

3. Blue Cohosh. — A tea made by boiling an ounce of blue cohosh in a 
pint of water is good for dysmenorrhea. The dose is from 1 to 4 ounces 3 or 
4 times a day. This is a womb tonic and may be combined with black cohosh 
and unicorn root. You can then use the fluid extract, the dose of which is 
from 15 to 20 drops. These remedies work best in combination. 

METRORRHAGIA. 

This usually means an excessive flow between the menstrual periods. 

CAUSES. — The causes are chronic inflammation of the lining of the 
womb, polypus, cancer, or fibroid tumors in the womb. 
TREATMENT.— 

Remove the causes. Treat the inflammation and remove the polypi and 
fibroids. Keep up the health by tonics such as tablets containing arsenic, iron 
and nux vomica. These tablets can be bought at any drug store. Use bitter 
herbs such as columbo, gentian and cinchona. 

Homeopathic Treatment. — ^Put 10 drops of the second dilution of China 
into half a glass of water and take 2 teaspoonfuls every 3 or 3 hours.

DISEASES OF THE VULVA. 
Description of the Parts. — The vulva is the outside fleshy part that 
protects the opening to the vagina. About half an inch above this opening is 
the opening of the urethra and above this is the clitoris. The fleshy part is 
made up largely of the labia majora and labia minora, or the large and small 
lips. Between the opening of the vagina and the anus, or opening of the bowel, 
is a muscular part called the " perineum." This has a great deal to do in labor 
and is generally torn to a greater or less degree ; sometimes back to and into 
the bowel. This is caused by a difficult labor and carelessness. The perineum 
makes up part of what is called the pelvic floor. This floor supports the 
structure above (vagina, womb, etc.) and when this gives way the supports 
or ligaments have too much to hold and hence sag, causing falling of the 
organs. 

INFLAMMATION OF THE VULVA— (VULVITIS). 

This is not a common disease. 

CAUSES. — Gonorrhea is a frequent cause of vulvitis. The disease is 
also caused by irritating discharges from the vagina and also by sweat, 
smegma, urine, thread worms, and uncleanliness and especially in hot weather. 

SYMPTOMS. — ^The mucous membrane is swollen and red and an abun- 
dant discharge covers the parts. There is local pain. Sometimes one of the 
lips only is affected and an abscess forms. 
TREATMENT.— 

If an abscess forms' it should be opened early and scraped. Rest in a 
lying position and observe cleanliness. Separate the lips and bathe and clean 
frequently with warm water. After bathing and cleansing the parts a local 
wash of boracic acid will be found good. Use a dram of boracic acid to a 
pint of water. If it comes from gonorrhea use a 2 per cent, solution of nitrate 
of silver locally after the parts have been thoroughly cleansed. All parts must 
be thoroughly treated. If of gonorrheal origin the disease may remain at the 
mouth of the urethra, in the ducts of the glands, etc. All traces of the disease 
must be eradicated before the patient is discharged for the septic material may 
be carried from the diseased organs to the vagina, womb, tubes and ovaries 
with terrible results. Any inflammation of the urethra must also be properly 
treated. 

INFLAMMATION OF THE VULVO-VAGINAL GLANDS. 
These glands are two in number, about the size of a bean and are situated 
deep in the inner part of the large lips or labia majora. The duct of the gland 
is about an inch long. This duct usually becomes inflamed in vulvitis and the 
inflammation may extend, producing an abscess of this gland. Inflammation 
may also occur separately from septic or gonorrheal infection. When the duct 
alone is inflamed it should be laid open with scissors and knife and cauterized 
with nitrate of silver stick or pure carbolic acid. Of course a physician will 
be required for this operation. 

SUPPURATION OF THE VULVO-VAGINAL GLANDS. 

Symptoms. — This is accompanied with marked swelling which may ex- 
tend to the anus, or opening of the bowel. Pain is always severe. Suppura- 
tion is first apparent on the inner surface of the large labia or lips. If not 

£4 



370 THE PEOPLE'S HOME MEDICAL BOOK. 

treated openings appear and it becomes chronic. A thin, milky or greenish, 
matter-like fluid may be pressed out of the duct or the fistulous openings. In- 
fection from this discharge may be communicated to man, or may ascend the 
genital tract producing inflammation of the womb or of the fallopian tubes. 
TREATMENT.— 

Make a free cut immediately into the lip at the junction of the skin and 
mucous tnembrane, wipe out the interior with carbolic acid and pack the 
cavity with gauze. If chronic, the hardened gland, duct and fistulous tracts 
miast be cut out and the wound packed with gauze. Sometimes the wound is 
closed immediately with catgut sutures. This condition is quite frequent. It 
is sometimes caused by injuries and it sometimes comes during pregnancy 
when it must be immediately attended to for the reasons given above. 

ITCHING OF THE VULVA— (PRURITUS VULVA) . - 

CAUSES. — Itching of the vulva is a very annoying trouble. The causes 
are many. Eruptions of the vulva, such as eczema ; irritating discharges from 
the vagina and womb ; cancer of the womb ; thread worms and irritation from 
diabetic urine are among the causes. Diseases of the womb, tubes and ovaries 
are also causes and sometimes it is impossible to find the cause. It is sometimes 
very severe during pregnancy. 

SYMPTOMS. — The itching may be so severe that the woman cannot 
refrain from scratching and rubbing the parts on all occasions. She becomes ' 
debarred from the society of her friends and seeks relief in anodynes and 
hypnotics. The itching may extend into the vagina, to the skin of the abt 
domen, to the inner part of the thighs and to the anus. 

TREATMENT. — You must find the cause if possible. Examine any va- 
ginal or uterine discharge. Discharges from the womb may be absorbed by 
placing a pledget of cotton against the womb and removing frequently so , 
that the discharge does not touch the vulva ; or, the parts may be l<«pt clean 
by frequent douches. In children, examine the stools for pin worms. Ex- 
amine the urine for diabetes. Treat diseases of the uterus, tubes and ovaries. 
When no local cause .can be found treat the general nutrition of the patient. 
A gouty condition or alcoholic drinks, rich food, fish and shell fish may cause 
it. In case of diabetes keep the parts clean of the urine by drying after each 
urination and dusting with a powder consisting of equal parts of subnitrate 
o^ bismuth and prepared chalk. The following applications are also good but 
they are poison and should be used with care. Mix 1/2 grain of bichloride of 
mercury with an ounce of emulsion of bitter almonds and apply twice a day ; 
or, twice a day apply a powder consisting of 1 grain of morphine and 2 grains 
of prepared chalk. Another good preparation is made by mixing 1 dram of 
carbolic acid with 5 drams each of tincture of opium, tincture of iodine and 
tincture of aconite. Appy once or twice in 24 hours. 
PEOPLE'S HOME REMEDIES.— 

1. Borax Water, — As an application for itching of the private parts use 
a solution made by dissolving an ounce of borax in a pint of rain water. 

2. Green Tea. — Green tea, when not too strong, is a good application 
for itching of the privates. 

3. Alum Water. — Weak alum water is a good wash for this troublesome 
disease. 



DISEASES OF WOMEN. 371 

WARTS OF THE VULVA— (PAPILLOMA). 

Causes. — These are usually the result of gonorrhea or syphilis but they 
may be caused by irritation from filth or by the leucorrbea of pregnancy. 
TREATMENT.— 

Small ones should be picked up with forceps and clipped off with curved 
scissors. Large ones should be cut off and the wounds closed with stitches. 

ADHESIONS OF THE CLITORIS. 

This organ is somewhat similar to the male organ and is situated above 
the urethral opening and is partly covered by the folds of the vulva. Ad- 
hesions, between the glans clitoris proper and the hood which covers it, are 
exceedingly common. No trouble may come from this unless an accumulation 
of smegma or thick secretion takes place or irritation is produced by the pres- 
ence of any hard substance. This should always be looked after in a child 
who has any irritation or redness around the vulva. Little girls frequently 
put their hands there and rub. In such a case the parts must be examined. 
You will then be very likely to find the parts adherent or dirty the same as 
is often the case with the penis in a boy. The irritation causes rubbing of 
the parts and often the child becomes an involuntary masturbator. 
TREATMENT.— 

The adherent parts should be loosened. This is easily done and the raw 
surface should then be covered with clean vaseline and the patient should 
keep from walking as long as there is pain. The hood should be drawn back 
and the vaseline applied every day for two weeks to prevent adhesions. 

I once treated a little child a few months old who had slight convulsions. 
After freeing the clitoris of the hood the convulsions ceased. If you see 
children of either sex frequently putting their hands to their private partSi 
those parts are either dirty or adherent and need attention. Bad habits can be 
prevented by timely attention to this trouble and the operation is very easily 
performed. 

DISEASES OF THE VAGINA. 
Description of Parts. — The vagina lies back of the bladder and in front 
of the rectum and extends from the vulva to the womb. The vagina ex- 
tends upward and backward as a transverse slit in the pelvic floor. It is the 
canal leading from the vulva to the womb. The front wall is 3% inches long 
and the back wall is SYz inches long. The walls are triangular in shape, being 
broader above than below. At the upper end the cervical portion, or neck, of 
the womb can be seen. This cavity is lined with mucous membrane and this 
is subject to disease. 

LEUCORRHEA— WHITES. 

Causes. — This is a very common and a very annoying trouble. It is 
caused by diseases of the ovaries, tubes, vagina and womb._ It is also caused 
by a tear of the cervix, ulceration, debility, anemia, chlorosis, etc. A relaxed 
condition of the vagina and surrounding parts and suppressed and irregular 
menses also cause it. Frequently it comes before and after the menstrual 
period. It is a symptom in many diseases. 

Symptoms. — There is a constant oozing of a thin white matter from 
the vagina. Sometimes this matter is yellow or brown. There is pain in the 



Sn THE PEOPLE'S HOME MEDICAL BOOK. 

back and loins and this pain is increased by exercise. There is a wasting away 
of the flesh and a weary and dejected look. Sometimes the discharge is irri- 
tating atid offensive. 
TREATMENT.— 

If the disease is caused by systemic trouble, such as chlorosis, the system 
should be built up with tonics. If it comes from diseases of the womb, etc., 
these diseases should be treated. There are many ways of treating it locally — 
by douches, vaginal cones, etc. Injections are certainly good for leucorrhea. 
Before using medical injections it is well to wash out the vagina with warm 
water and some antiseptic solution like carbolic acid (1 teaspoonful to a pint 
of water), listerine, glyco-thymoline, etc. Then, when the vagina is cleansed, 
use some healing medicine like a tea or decoction made from golden seal, witch 
hazel, tannic acid or white oak bark. Golden seal is good but it stains the 
clothing. Lloyd's hydrastis, or golden seal, is colorless but you must use more 
of it. Use 4 teaspoonfuls of it to a pint of water as an injection. These in- 
jections and hot water injections are good cleansers and healers. Boric acid, 
beth root or pinus canadensis also make good injections. The following is a 
good injection. Take cranesbill, witch hazel, black cohosh and golden seal, 
half an ounce of each, coarsely bruised, and boiling water 1 quart; mix the 
articles thoroughly and steep with gentle heat in a closed vessel for two'hours ; 
remove from the fire and strain. This is a fine injection for leucorrhea, and 
falling of the womb and bowel. 

From 10 to 30 drops of tincture of myrrh three times a day is good for • 
leucorrhea. The following is a good tonic for leucorrhea and falling of the 
womb. Mix 1/4 ounce of comfrey root, 2 ounces of elecampane root and 1 
ounce of horehound and add 3 quarts of water. Boil from 3 quarts down to 
3 pints ; strain, and add while warm, % ounce of powdered beth root, 1 pint of 
brandy and 1 pound of loaf sugar. The dose is from % to % of a wine-glass- 
ful 3 or 4 times a day. 

Attend to the diseases that produce leucorrhea ; take tonics and strength- 
ening remedies and take plenty of exercise. Some good home remedies are 
given and the " Mother's Cordial " will be found especially good. 

PEOPLE'S HOME REMEDIES.— 

1. " Mother's Cordial " or Compound Syrup of Partridge Berry. — This is 
a uterine tonic and is a good remedy for leucorrhea, amenorrhea, dysmenor- 
rhea, menorrhagia, spasms, cramps, and to overcome a ^fendency to miscar- 
riage. The dose is from 3 to 4 ounces 3 times a day. One or two doses daily 
for several weeks before confinement is good. Take 1 pound of partridge 
berry, 4 ounces of helonias root, 4 ounces of high cranberry bark and 4 ounces 
of blue cohosh root. Grind and mix the articles together ; place in a convenient 
vessel ; cover with fourth proof brandy and steep for 3 days. Then transfer 
all to a filtering apparatus and gradually add brandy until 3 pints of the spirit- 
uous tincture have been obtained, which reserve. Then continue the filtering 
with hot water until the liquid passes tasteless. Add to this 3 pounds of 
granulated sugar and evaporate with gentle heat to 5 pints ; remove from the 
fire ; add the reserved 3 pints and flavor with essence of sassafras. 

2. Restorative Bitters. — The roots and flowers used should all be bruised. 
Take 1 ounce each of comfrey root, Solomon's seal root and spikenard root; 
y2 ounce each of chamomile flowers, columbo root and gentian root; 4 pints 
of sherry wine and a sufficient quantity of boiling water. Place the herbs in 



a:^ 



DISEASES OF WOMEN. 373 

a vessel, cover with boiling vi^ater and allow the compound to steep for 24 
hours, keeping it closely covered ; then add the sherry wine, steep -for 14 
days, press and filter. The dose is from I/2 to 3 fluid ounces 3 or 4 times a 
day. This is a very good tonic for all diseases peculiar to females and it is 
especially good for leucorrhea, menorrhagia, amenorrhea, weak back, etc. 

3. Solomon's Seal, Spikenard, Wild Cherry, Peach Root, Etc. — Take 1 
ounce each of bruised spikenard root, Solomon's seal root, gentian, wild 
cherry bark and peach root ; add 4 pints of boiling water ; simmer slowly to 1 
pint and then add 4 pints of native wine. Steep for 4 days, press, filter and 
add 2 ounces of loaf sugar. The dose is from % to 2 fluid ounces 3 or 4 times 
a <lay. This is good for leucorrhea and other female troubles. 

4. Pulverized Egg Shells. — Burnt and pulverized egg shells are a good 
remedy for leucorrhea. The dose is 10 grains in sweetened milk. 

5. Alum Water. — If the leucorrhea is from the womb take 1 dram of 
tannic acid, % ounce of pulverized alum, and 1 quart of water and use half 
this quantity night and morning as an injection. 

6. Alum and Honey of Roses. — Mix 1 dram of alum with 1 ounce of 
honey of roses and 3 ounces of water. Put a tablespoonful of this into a cup 
of water and use as an injection twice a day. 

7. Green Tea. — For leucorrhea take a sitting bath every day and use in- 
jections of tepid water 3 or 4 times a day. Injections of weak gredn tea are 
excellent for many cases. 

8. Cider and Alum. — Injections of sweet cider or a weak solution of 
alum are excellent in many cases of leucorrhea. 

9. Borax and Poppy Heads. — Add IV2 ounces of pulverized borax to a 
pint of tea made from poppy heads and use this as an injection. This is fine 
for whites, or leiicorrhea. 

10. Tannic Acid and Alum, — Keep the bowels open and use ,injections 
made by dissolving an ounce of alum and 3 drams of tannic acid in a quart of 
water. One-third of this quantity should be used as an injection 3 times a 
day for leucorrhea. 

11. Black Cohosh and Tannic Acid. — An excellent injection for leucor- 
rhea is a decoction of black cohosh root with from 1 to 3 drams of tannic acid 
added. 

12. Golden Seal and Cranesbill. — A strong decoction made by using 2 
parts of golden seal to 1 part of cranesbill is a very valuable injectioti for leu- 
corrhea. 

13. Beth Root. — From 2 to 4 ounces of a tea made of beth root is good 
for leucorrhea when taken internally 3 times a day. It is also good as an 
injection. 

14. Witch Hazel. — After the vagina has been thoroughly syringed and 
cleansed use witch hazel as an injection. Half an ounce in water is usually 
used at each injection but in severe cases it may be used half strength. 

15. Golden Seal. — Injections of golden seal tea are fine for leucorrhea. 

16. Hemlock Spruce. — A strong decoction of hemlock spruce is good for 
leucorrhea when taken internally and is especially good when used as an injec- 
tion. It is also good for falling of the womb. 

INFLAMMATION OF THE VAGINA— (VAGINITIS). 
In simple vaginitis the membrane remains smooth. Granular vaginitis is 



374 THE PEOPLE'S HOME MEDICAL BOOK. 

the kind usually seen and in this the papillae ^are infiltrated with small ones 
and are much enlarged so that the inflamed part has a granular appearance. 

SYMPTOMS OF THE ACUTE FORMS.— There is a dull pain and a 
sense of fulness in the pelvis which is increased by walking, standing, and 
emptying of either the bowels or bladder. There is also a free discharge of 
serum or pus which may be mixed with blood. The character of the dis- 
charge depends upon the kind and period of the disease. If the acute form is 
neglected it may pass into the chronic form. It usually lingers in the upper 
parts of the vagina in the corners and especially is this true if the vaginitis is 
of gonorrheal origin. By careful inspection we find here one or more granular 
patches of inflammation which cause a vaginal discharge from which man 
may be infected and from which infection of the upper portion of the genital 
tract, the uterus, and fallopian tubes may be derived. 
TREATMENT.— 

Vaginitis, especially that of gonorrheal origin, should be treated vigor- 
ously and thoroughly until all traces of it are go,ne. Keep as quiet as pos- 
sible and move the bowels with epsom or rochelle salts. Take, 3 times in 2.4 
hours while lying upon the back, a vaginal douche of boracic acid solution, 
using 1 dram of boracic acid to a pint of water. The temperature of the 
solution should be 100 degrees. If the" disease comes from gonorrhea a warn? 
bichloride of mercury solution should be used in the same way, using 1 part 
of the medicine to 5,000 parts of water. After the acute symptoms have dis- 
appeared local application can also be made in addition to the douches. Clean ' 
the vaginal surfaces gently with warm water and cotton. If there is much 
pain apply a 4 per cent, solution of cocaine to the surfaces ; then the entire 
vaginal surface should be painted with a solution of bichloride of mercury 
(1 to 1,000). Apply daily until cured, continuing the douches. Tablets of 
bichloride of mercury, or corrosive sublimate as it is also called, can be bought 
at any drug store and of any strength. 

In simple vaginitis you can use douches of boracic acid, 1 dram to a pint 
of water, and afterward inject a solution of golden seal, witch hazel or white 
oak bark. These last are to be used after the acute symptoms are past and no 
doctor can be obtained. Warm salt water is also good. 

Homeopathic Treatment. — In the first stages use the second dilution oi 
Aconite and after the first 24 hours use the third dilutidn of Belladonna. When 
there is a mucous discharge use the third trituration of Mercurius. 

DISEASES OF THE WOMB. 



FALLING OF THE WOMB— (PROLAPSUS UTERI). 

Complete prolapsus or falling is when the womb protrudes outside the 
vagina. This is very unusual. • 

CAUSES.— One cause is injury to the pelvic floor caused by tearing the 
perineum during childbirth. Other causes are relaxation of the womb liga- 
ments from too frequent labor, old age, weakness, heavy lifting and falls or 
anything that tends to weaken the supports or ligaments. Getting up too soon 
after labor by those whose labor is very hard is also a cause. 

SYMPTOMS. — The symptoms are backache, weakness of the legs, a 
bearing down feeling like the parts would come out and crossing of the legs. 
The pain in the back frequently disappears when lying doivn. Headache 



DISEASES OF WOMEN. 375 

situated in the back part of the head, pain extending down the back part of 
the thighs and irritation of the bladder and bowels are other symptoms. You 
can feel the opening of the womb low down in the vagina. This disease is 
readily diagnosed by examination of the vagina. 
TREATMENT.— 

First of all restore the perineum by operating. Rest in bed and assume 
the chest position 3 or 4 times a day for from 5 to 15 minutes at a time. Put 
the chest on the bed, draw the knees up and rest on them and the chest. This 
position throws the womb up and forward. Keep the bowels open. Use one 
or two hot vaginal douches each day of a 1 to 4,000 bichloride solution or use 
home remedies as injections. Witch hazel is very good or beth root or white 
oak bark tea. These injections should be continued for a long time. Make a 
strong infusion of witch hazel and inject twice a day. If the womb has com- 
pletely protruded it must be put back carefully with the hands if it cannot 
be put back by assuming the knee-chest position. In this trouble the womb 
often comes out after a stool. You should then use the bichloride douche as 
it is cleansing and thoroughly antiseptic. Or, if you do not have this solution 
you should wash the womb with warm witch hazel tea ; then anoint the fingers 
with vaseline and gently push the organ back into the vagina. Then inject 
£ool witch hazel and remain in bed for several days. Continue using the witch 
hazel as an injection. Use the bed pan for the bowels and the urine so as to 
avoid getting up. Frequently assume the knee-chest position. 

If the perineum is in good condition, pessaries or supports ire found use- 
ful in many cases. Some women make tampons and put them into the vagina. 
If these are used they should be changed frequently. Stem pessaries or sup- 
ports are good but are unpleasant to wear and in time the hard rubber may 
irritate the womb. I have found Farr's Prolapse Uterine Supporter, of the 
stem kind, to be very good. This pessary is made of rubber that gives enough 
to be worn very comfortably and successfully. The medium size is usually 
the one to order. These pessaries are made in Boston. I placed one in a lady 
about 60 years old who was suffering with almost complete prolapsus or fall- 
ing of the womb. She wore it for years with comfort and success and ordered 
another when the first was worn out. 
PEOPLE'S HOME REMEDIES.— 

1. Alum, Geranium and White Oak Bark. — For falling of the womb use 
as an injection a tea made with a pint of water and 1 ounce of either geranium 
or white oak bark. A solution of an ounce of alum in a pint of water is also 
a fine remedy. 

Physician's Remarks. — These are all good for they are astringents. 

3. Hops, Solomon's Seal and Peach Leaves.— For falling of the womb 
make a tea of equal parts of hops, Solomon's seal and peach leaves, and use, 
this as an injection. If there is heat and difficulty in passing water drink a 
tea made of spearmint and marshmallow. 

Physician's Remarks. — Solomon's seal is astringent, peach leaves are 
slightly so, and the hops are quieting. 

BENDING FORWARD OF THE WOMB— (ANTEFLEXION). 

Anteflexion is an unnatural bending forward of the womb. The womb 
is naturally bent forward a little and especially when the bladder is empty. 



376 THE PEOPLE'S HOME MEDICAL BOOK. 

This bending forward becomes a disease when the bend in the cervical canal 
is sufficient to impede the escape of the menstrual and other uterine discharges. 

SYMPTOMS. — The most prominent symptom is dysmenorrhea or pain- 
ful menstruation. Violent pains in the center of the abdomen, extending down 
the thighs, occur several hours before the flow begins. In the later years of 
,the disease the pain extends to the whole of the pelvis and the back. Nausea 
and vomiting may be present during the height of the pain. When the flow 
has started the pain is relieved and may be absent during the remainder of the 
menstrual period. The blood is clotted during the first part of the flow. Unless 
relieved by pregnancy or by proper treatment the trouble will continue. The 
suffering increases with time. Inflammation of the womb, tubes, and ovaries 
follow old cases of anteflexion. Sterility usually accompanies well marked 
cases. 
TREATMENT.— 

If pregnancy occurs and runs a normal course the disease will be cured. 
Miscarriage, ^owever, is very likely to occur during the early months of preg- 
nancy and especially in cases of long standing. The object of the treatment 
is to straighten the cervical canal. The use of the stem pessary is dangerous. 
The best method is rapid forcible dilation by a competent operator. This 
should be done one week after the menstrual period. Anteflexion is usually 
a disease of the unmarried or sterile woman. 

RETROVERSION AND RETROFLEXION OF THE WOMB. 

Retroversion means a turning back of the womb and retroflexion means 
a bending backward of the uterine or womb axis. Usually both retroversion 
and retroflexion exist together. 

CAUSES. — They may be congenital. Falls, blows, twisting of the body, 
or sudden efforts of lifting may be the cause. Labor is probably the most 
frequent cause. If a woman leaves her bed or goes to work too^soon after 
miscarriage or labor many conditions are present that favor these troubles. 
The womb is then larger and heavier than usual ; the uterine ligaments, 
vagina, and vaginal opening are relaxed and the support of the pelvic floor 
is consequently deficient; the abdominal walls are relaxed and the holding 
power of the abdomen is lessened. These causes also favor falling of the 
womb. Retroflexion is a disease of women who have been pregnant and have 
borne children. 

SYMPTOMS. — In these cases there is serious disarrangement of the 
circulation and this results in enlargement of the womb and chronic conges- 
tion or inflammation of its lining. There is also an irritable bladder with pain- 
ful and frequent urination in many cases. Pressure of the body of the womb 
upon the rectum may also cause constipation and nervous trouble. The 
rectum often feels obstructed and piles may occur. Backache situated in the 
upper part of the sacrum and headache on either the top or at the back of the 
head and a feeling of weight and dragging in the pelvis and extending down 
the thighs are symptoms of these troubles. Physical weakness or inatility 
to stand or walk more than a short time is often very marked. Congestion 
of the ovaries may result and then there is pain in the ovarian region. Menor-- 
rhagia and leucorrhea occur and menstruation is usually painful. At the 
menstrual period the backache headache, ovarian pain and bladder disturb- 
ance are increased. 



DISEASES OF WOMEN. 377 

TREATMENT.— 

Vaginal pessaries of proper shape and size should be worn. These must 
be of such shape and size that they may be worn without feeling them. They 
must not cause pain. The womb should be replaced before the support is 
introduced. The woman who wears a support should be under a doctor's ob- 
servation that he may see how it acts and if the displacement is cured. The 
womb is sometimes operated on for these troubles. Ventro-fixation or ventro- 
suspension of the womb and shortening of the round ligaments are the treat- 
ments. Of course these operations are to be performed only as a last resort 
and by a competent man. 

LACERATION OF THE NECK OF THE WOMB— (LACERATION 
OF THE CERVIX UTERI). 

Laceration or tearing of the neck of the womb is of very frequent occur- 
rence. In almost every case of labor there is tearing of this part to a greater 
or less extent. The majority of cases heal without causing any trouble. 
These lacerations may be large or small. 

SYMPTOMS. — Leucorrhea is usually present; menstruation may be ir- 
regular and increased in duration; and backache and headache may be pres- 
ent. If the tear is extensive, pelvic pain may be experienced. Sometimes 
very marked nervous disturbances are caused by laceration and especially 
if there is very much scar tissue. Neuralgia may occur and is usually sit- 
uated in the pelvis. 
TREATMENT.— 

All forms of laceration of the cervix in which there exist erosion, eyer- 
sion (turning out), cystic degeneration, and sclerosis (hard tissue) should be 
operated on. In women approaching middle life or the age of forty all lacera- 
tions of the cervix should be closed whether or not they produce symptoms. 
Cancer of the neck of the womb is most likely to begin in an old lacera- 
tion and the woman should be protected against this danger. The operation 
is called " frachelorraphy " and consists of freshening or excising the tissues 
of the torn surfaces and bringing the freshened edges together with futures. 
This operation is very successful and is not especially severe or dangerous 

CERVICAL CATARRH— (ACUTE AND CHRONIC). 

This is an inflammation of the cervical mucous membrane. The cervix, 
or neck, of the womb is the lower part of the womb and looks like the small 
end of a large pear. Through the center runs a channel called the cervical 
canal and this continues to the inner opening and into the womb cavity. At 
the outer or lower end of this canal the opening is called the external os 
(mouth) ; at the inner end the opening is called the internal os. Between 
these openings is the so-called cervical canal which is widest in the center.. 
Cervical catarrh is an inflammation of the walls of this canal. 

Acute Cervical Catarrh. — This occurs generally as a part of a general 
acute process aflfecting the whole inner lining of the womb and is com- 
monly the result of gonorrheal or septic infection. It will be considered 
under " General Endometritis." 

Chronic Cervical Catarrh. — This is a chronic inflammation of the mucous 
membrane of the cervical canal. It is an exceedingly common affection. 



378 THE PEOPLE'S HOME MEDICAL BOOK. 

Unless it is caused by gonorrhea it is nearly always secondary to some 
local or general condition. The discharge is a thick tenacious mucus and 
differs decidedly from the vaginal mucus. It is often opaque, rarely pus, 
and seldom streaked with blood. The mucous membrane becomes swollen and 
may project or prolapse beyond the limits of the external opening so that the 
opening has a ring around it of red and congested mucous membrane like 
the eyelids in conjunctivitis. This inflammation may extend, to the vaginal 
part of the cervix. The most usual secondary cause of this trouble is lacer- 
ation of the cervix. Also, the various displacements of the womb are often 
accompanied by this trouble. Frequent douches of cold water to prevent 
conception are said to be a cause. Gonorrhea seems in many cases to be com- 
municated directly and primarily from the male to the cervical mucous mem- 
brane and this results in a most obstinate form of chronic inflammation and 
if not properly treated may cause terrible disaster by causing disease of the 
organs beyond. 

SYMPTOMS. — The most conspicuous symptom is the leucorrhea with 
thick, tenacious, opaque mucus. The quantity is often so great that the clothes 
of the woman are soiled and she is obliged to wear a napkin. There may bfe 
slight backache and a feeling of vague discomfort or pain in the pelvis. 
TREATMENT.— 

Find the cause and treat it. Attend to the laceration or displacement. 
If caused by scrofula, syphilis or tuberculosis, treat these conditions. Local 
treatment by douches aids the cure. Give some general, tonic treatment such 
as Blaud's pills, the prescription for which is here given. Take 3 drams each 
of pulv. ferri sulph. exsic and potass, carb. puree ; make into a mass ; divide into 
48 pills and take 3 or 4 a day. Bitter tonics and tonic herb remedies are good. 
Local treatment must be administered carefully. A great deal of harm is 
done and especially by the application of harsh remedies and by the unclean 
way in which they are so often applied. Injections of golden seal and witch 
hazel often do good. Warm water is also a good injection. The gonorrheal 
kind will be treated later. , 

CANCER OF THE CERVIX OR NECK OF THE WOMB. 

This is a very common disease. About one-third of all cases of cancer 
in women affect the womb. It appears at almost every period of life except 
infancy but it occurs most frequently between the ages of thirty and fifty. 
Cancer of the cervix is a disease of the child-bearing woman. It is very 
rare in women who have never been pregnant. The stout and well nourished 
mother of a large family is very likely to have cancer of the cervix. 

CAUSES. — The chief predisposing cause of cancer of the cervix is a 
laceration or tear caused by miscarriage or labor. Cancer of the vaginal 
cervix very often begins in the mild erosion of an old laceration. True ulcer- 
ation, as a mild condition, is very rare in the cervix ; so, when an erosion turns 
into an ulceration it should always excite the gravest suspicion. It may ex- 
tend to the vagina, to the body of the womb, to the broaJ ligamehts, the 
bladder, rectum, and to the peritoneum and may be carried by the Ij'-mphatic 
vessels to the pelvic and inguinal glands. 

SYMPTOMS. — A study of the early symptoms of cancer of the cervix is 
of greatest importance. In the early stages the disease may be eradicated 
with every probability of permanent cure. The great majority of women 
with cancer of the cervix come to the operator when the disease has extended 



DISEASES OF WOMEN. 379 

too far to permit of any radical treatment. The usual symptoms are bleeding:, 
pain and discharge. The bleeding often appears ifirst as a menorrhagia which 
is an increase in the amount of blood lost at the normal menstrual period. 
The loss may be greater and the period longer. In other cases slight bleed- 
ing appears between the menses and a spot of blood may be noticed upon 
the clothing. The leucorrheal discharge may occasionally be streaked with 
blood. The patient usually discharges blood after long walking or stand- 
ing, or physical work, or after straining at stool or very often after sexual 
intercourse. If the " change of life " has been passed the bleeding may appear 
as a re-establishment of menstruation. It may occur with more or less regular- 
ity every month or every 3 or 4 months or it may appear as an occasional loss of 
blood after unwonted effort. Such flow in a women over 30 years of age 
demands immediate and careful physical examination. Any bleeding from 
the vagina in a woman who has passed the " change of life " should arouse 
the gravest suspicion. Pain is not a constant accompaniment of this disease in 
the early stages nor is it in any way characteristic. In some cases it is 
absent entirely. The pain, when present, may be dull or it may be sharp and 
piercing. 

The discharge may be present in cancer of the cervix before there are 
any symptoms of bleeding or pain. It may first appear as an ordinary cervical 
leucorrhea in a woman previously free from such a discharge; or, it may ap- 
pear as an increase of the accustomed leucorrhea. Later the leucorrhea be- 
comes pus-like in character and streaked with blood. It becomes thinner, 
constant and brownish. The pus and debris from the breaking down cancer- 
ous mass increase and a horrible odor characteristic of the later stages of 
cancer of the cervix appears. This odor is not peculiar to cancer but is caused 
by the sloughing tissue and is observed when such a process occurs in other 
conditions, as in sloughing fibroids. The discharge is irritating in character. 
TREATMENT.— 

The treatment is a complete removal of the uterus or womb. To be a 
cure it must be done early so be on the lookout and discover the cause of all 
discharges from the vagina. They may be due to an eroded, ulcerated, lacer- 
ated cervix and need early attention. Many lives and much suffering can 
be saved if such symptoms are not neglected. 

ACUTE INFLAMMATION OF THE WOMB— ACUTE CORPOREAL 

ENDOMETRITIS. 

DESCRIPTION AND CAUSES.— Acute inflammation of the mucous 
membrane of the body of the uterus or womb is called acute corporeal en- 
dometritis. The disease is usually the result of septic infection occurring at 
a labor or miscarriage. Occasionally acute gonorrheal endometritis is seen 
bat this disease usually produces an inflammation of the mucous membrane 
flf the cervix and the body of the womb that is half-acute or chronic from 
the beginning. The acute variety can be caused by the use of the uterine 
sound. It is also sometimes seen in eruptive diseases. 

SYMPTOMS. — Dull pain is usually present in the region of the womb 
and is referred to the supra-pelvic region and the sacrum. There is frequent 
and painful urination. The temperature in puerperal cases is very high. The 
discharge from the womb is very much increased, pus-like in character, and 
occasionally streaked with blood. 



380 THE PEOPLE'S HOME MEDICAL BOOK. 

TREATMENT.— 

In non-puerperal cases the patient should have rest in bed. Give vaginal 
douches of hot boric acid solution, using 1 dram of boric acid to a pint oi 
water. Douches of , a 1 to 4,000 solution of bichloride of merciiry are also 
good. These douches should be taken at a temperature of 100 or 110 degrees. 
Continue the use of saline purgatives like epsom or rochelle salts. The home- 
opathic treatment is by the use of Aconite, Belladonna, Mercurius and Arseni- 
cum. When, however, the disease occurs, as it often does, from septic infec- 
tion at a miscarriage or labor more radical treatment must be used. This treat- 
ment comprises frequiently repeated uterine douches and thorough curetting of 
the uterus which can only be done by a physician aided by an experienced 
nurse, It is now simply the so-called severe child-bed fever. Every case of 
acute inflammation of the body of the womb should be carefully watched and 
treated until the disease is cured. Acute inflammation of the womb, es- 
pecially if gonorrhea is the cause, is very' likely to become chronic and to 
extend to the mucous membranp of the fallopian tubes and to the ovaries. 

CHRONIC INFLAMMATION OF THE WOMB. 
Chronic Corporeal Endometritis. 

In practice this form is seen much more frequently than the acute form. 
It may occur as a primary disease but it very often occurs as a result of 
some other disease of the womb. , 

CAUSES. — The causes are various. It follows diseases of the womb an4 
may result as a later stage of the acute form, or it may exist from the begin- 
ning in the chronic form. This is especially true when it is caused by gonor- 
rhea. Here the invasion of the disease is slow and insiduous and in the 
majority of cases is preceded by no determinable acute stage. 

SYMPTOMS.— The menstrual function is usually affected. The period 
lasts longer, the loss of blood is greater and the periods are more frequent. 
The secretion is also increased and is thin and purulent in character and 
often streaked with blood. Pain is a general symptorn and is referred to the 
lower portion of the abdomen and the back. There is headache in the top 
or at the back part of the head. Pain is worse when the patient is on the feet 
and is greater before and during the menses. There is great weakness and 
debility and the patient is nervous and hysterical with mental depression ,and 
melancholia. 
TREATMENT.— ^ 

As this disease is usually secondary to some disease of the cervix or body 
of the womb, the treatment should be directed toward the cure of this first 
condition. Many mild cases can be relieved or cured by attention to the 
hygiene and habits and by applications to the vaginal aspect of the womb. 
Wear dresses which are loose around the waist and supported from the 
shoulders. Do less standing and walking. Take mild laxatives. Repeated 
exercise and massage are good. Use a vaginal douche and glycerine tampon. 
More radical ti'eatment may be necessary and curetting of the womb may 
have to be resorted to. 

FIBROID TUMORS OF THE WOMB. 
These originate in the muscular walls of the womb. When they are 
situated in the muscular wall they are called " interstitial." When they grow 
out so that they, project into the womb they are called " sub-mucous." The; 



DISEASES OF WOMEN. 381 

whole woipb becomes very much enlarged and the cavity is increased in 
length. We also have the " sub-peritoneal " variety of the fibroid tumor. 

SYMPTOMS.— Bleeding is the chief symptom and is present in the 
great majority of fibroids. 
TREATMENT.— 

Operative treatment is usually demanded. These cannot be cured with 
medicine. Some women put off the operation until a terrific bleeding de- 
stroys their life. If the tumor is small and there are no serious symptoms, 
the case may be watched but must be watched closely. 

DISEASES OF THE FALLOPIAN TUBES. 

DESCRIPTION OF FALLOPIAN TUBES.— The average length of 
the normal tube • is ten inches. The narrow end of the tube is called the 
isthmus and the outer end, which is trumpet shaped, is called the ampula. 
The canal of the tube is small. At the uterine, or womb end (ostium inter- 
num) it will barely admit a bristle. Beyond the middle of the tube the canal 
gradually widens to the outer opening (ostium abdominale). This is sur- 
rounded by peculiar luxuriant folds of mucous membrane called fimbrae and 
these are formed by the outward bulging of the exuberant mucous membrane. 
These tubes extend laterally from the upper part of the body of the wo,mb. 
The fimbrae gather the ovum from the ovary and it is conveyed through the 
tube to the body of the womb. These tubes are subject to disease. If they 
are inflamed this inflammation is called " salpingitis." 

INFLAMMATION OF THE FALLOPIAN TUBES— SALPINGITIS. 

This is usually secondary to endometritis, the mucous membrane of the 
tubes becoming inflamed by its spreading from the mucous membrane of the 
womb. Any form may extend to the tubes but the septic and gonorrheal 
forms of endometritis are especially virulent and it is the rule in these that 
the tubes are infected. It is usually seen in the chronic form. When the tube 
distends with pus it is called " pyosalpinx ;" when distended with a watery 
fluid it is called " hydrosalpinx ;" and when distended with blood it is called 
" hsematosalpinx." 

SYMPTOMS OF CHRONIC SALPINGITIS.— Pain is the most prom- 
inent and is a continuous symptom. It may be on both sides and if such is 
the case it may be relieved by lying down and remaining quiet. The pain is 
sometimes very great. It is dull and aching or sharp and piercing and is very 
much worse at the menstrual period. The dysmenorrhea in this disease is 
usually very characteristic. It begins several days, sometimes a week, before 
the flow appears. It starts in the region of both ovaries and radiates thence 
throughout the pelvis and down the thighs and it Usually lasts throughout 
the whole period. The pain of salpingitis persists throughout the whole 
course of the disease. The patient walks with the body slightly bent forward ; 
sits down gently upon a chair and protects herself, by support with the hand, 
from the jolting of a carriage or car. 
TREATMENT.— 

In the early stages of acute salpingitis watch and be ready to rneet 
emergencies. Observe absolute rest by lying down. Two or three times a 
day give vaginal douches of hot distilled or boiledi water at the temperature 
of about 100 or 110 degrees. Give small doses of rochelle or epsom salts, l^ 
to 1 dram, every 1 to 3 |iours until mild movements of the bowels are pro- 



880 THE PEOPLE'S HOME MEDICAL BOOK. 

duced. Continue these measures as required. Apply hot fomentations of 
hops over the lower part of the abdomen. In all these diseases much relief 
is given by the application of fomentations or cloths wrung out of hot watei 
or hot water and hops. Hot teas may be 1;aken freely at the same time. 
These produce perspiration and thus relieve the congestion and inflammation 
and relax the muscles' of the pai'ts. The application of fomentations shouk' 
be continued for hours and they should always be kept as hot as can be 
borne. In the gonorrheal and septic forms there is great danger of its spread 
ing to the peritoneum or of the formation of some form of pelvic abscess thai 
will imperil the life of the woman and so the case must be watched carefully 
and continuously. If there are well marked symptoms of pelvic peritonitis or 
if a distinct tumor can be felt, then an operation must be performed. Fatal 
peritonitis sometimes results within 3 or 4 days after the onset of acute 
salpingitis. The chronic form should be carefully watched as an operation 
may be necessary. 

Homeopathic Treatment. — Aconite, Belladonna and Mercurius are good 
for either the acute or chronic form. (For preparation and use see " Homeo' 
pathic Medicines " in Nursing Department.) 

DISEASES OF THE OVARIES. 

DESCRIPTION OF OVARIES.— The general shape of the ovary ia 
oval. They are two in number. After the change of life the ovaries shrink- 
a great deal in size and weight ; sometimes from 100 down to 15 grains. The 
long axis of the ovary is from about 1% to 2 inches ; its breadth about % to 
1% inches and its thickness about % to ^^ inch. A healthy ovary is pinkish 
in color. On its surface are seen small bluish areas that mark the position 
of unruptured or recently ruptured ovarian follicles. 

INFLAMMATION OF THE OVARIES. 
Ovaritis. 

CAUSES. — Inflammation of the ovaries may extend from the fallopian 
tubes and this is the usual cause of the acute form. Acute suppression of 
menstruation is also said to cause it as is acute rheumatism and the eruptive 
fevers. 

SYMPTOMS. — ^There is pain in the ovarian region which increases dur- 
ing the menses and is most intense immediately before and at the beginning 
of the flow. If the flow is profuse the pain is often relieved. The symptoms 
may be masked by other diseases such as salpingitis and puerperal sepsis. 
TREATMENT.— 

This disease sometimes requires an operation but I believe a great deal 
can be done with medicines and especially when it is not gonorrheal in origin. 
The homeopathic treatment is by the use of Aconite and Belladonna at the 
beginning and Mercurius later. Apis Mellifica, taken for a long time, is a 
good remedy for chronic inflamed ovaries. (For the preparation and use of 
these medicines see " Homeopathic Medicines " in the Nursing Department.) 
PEOPLE'S HOME REMEDIES.— 

1. Hot Cloths and Laudanum, — For acute inflammation of the ovaries 
apply hot cloths to the abdomen and. take 10 drops of laudanum internally 
every 3 or 4 hours according to the pain. 

Reraarks. — One of the best physicians in Ohio prescribes this treatment. 



OUR BOYS AND GIRLS. 383 

OVARIAN CYSTS. 

These grow to immense size and the only cure is an operation. Tapping 
was once the universal method of treatment but it is not a permanent cure. 
The results of operations for this trouble are very good and I have no hesi- 
tation in recommending an operation in these cases. A short time ago, during 
my vacation in the East, I recommended an operation for a lady who had an 
ovarian cyst and expected to die. She had the operation performed and is 
today a well woman, At the time she was so filled up with the fluid that 
breathing was very difficult and the action of the heart was bad. This opera- 
tion is quite quickly performed and generally with little danger to the patient 
unless there are complications or she has waited too long. Many of the in- 
flammatory diseases of the womb and ovaries can be cured by medicine. If 
the cause is gonorrhea the result is not so good. I have been treating an en- 
larged ovary, one without dangerous symptoms, for the last eight years. In 
this case an operation had been advised by others. The patient is better today 
than eight years ago. A great many menstrual troubles can be cured or relieved 
by medicine. Operations should only be performed in such cases when other 
means have failed. However, when there is pus there is always danger and 
such cases require constant watching. 

OUR BOYS AND GIRLS. 

How to properly bring up our boys and girls is a great question. A great 
deal of time and thought has been given to this question not only by parents 
but by officials who have to do with making and enforcing the laws. The 
training the child receives has much to do with its permanent moral character 
in after life. Curfew laws are passed in some towns and cities. If parents 
kept their boys in at night such laws would be unnecessary. In almost anv 
group of boys there are some who have knowledge of things that they impart 
to others in an improper way. Vulgar and immoral language is used and 
evil practices are taught to others. Many parents would be much surprised 
to know how much masturbation is practiced among both boys and girls. As 
they grow older the promiscuous mingling of the sexes gives opportunity for 
sexual relations and all physicians know that this often occurs even before 
puberty. I know of one case where a boy of but seven years of age contracted 
a loathsome venereal disease from a girl of seventeen. Parents should know 
these things. There is much harm done by concealing the truth about these 
matters. 

In many cases our schools are at fault for here our boys and girls mingle 
promiscuously with children coming from all kinds of homes. This is perhaps 
as it should be but they should be watched over carefully or they will learn 
habits that are unnatural and immoral. Juvenile courts are being established 
and the judges state that these immoral practices are not confined^ to the 
poorer classes. Judge Lindsay, of Denver, has made a great fight against im- . 
purity and there are other judges who are now working zealously in the same 
direction. It is time for parents to wake -up to the danger that threatens 
their boys and girls. Parents are not blameless. Business and society cause 
them to neglect their children and they are often entirely brought up by 
servants. No one will do for your children what you fail to do yourself. 
Too many children, and especially boys, grow up making light of virtue. Not 
only this, but masturbation is practiced to an extent almost beyond belief. 



384 THE PEOPLE'S HOME MEDICAL BOOK. 

This is an unnatural practice and children should be instructed as to its awful 
effects upon both the mind and body. This- habit is taught them by older 
boys and girls but they are not instructed as to its ruining effects. Parents 
should not only warn their children against these practices but they should 
instruct them as to their effects and why they are harmful. Children are 
sure to learn about these things but they only learn a part of the truth and it 
is well known that, " a little learnihg is a dangerous thing." Is it not better 
for the children to learn these things at home and in the proper way? 

Children often learn to masturbate involuntarily. The habit is some- 
times formed by rubbing the itching privates: Often they are not kept 
clean and the filth produces intense itchii^g. See that the private parts of 
the children of both sexes aire kept as clean as other parts of the body. Some- 
times this practice is caused by the foreskin of the boy b^ing too tight and 
thus irritating the parts. Tn such cases circumcision is necessary. In girls 
the hood of the clitoris often causes irritation and needs to be cut free. These 
operations are simple and are often necessary. Every parent should see to 
it that these operations are performed, if it is necessary, and it very frequently 
is. How often we see the little ones rttbbing their private parts. Whenever 
a child is seen doing this the chances are that they are either unclean or 
need one of the above operations. Do not let the child become an involuntary 
masturbator through your neglect. 

Parents should teach their children about themselves. Do not let them 
grow up in ignorance of what their re-productive organs are intended for and 
of the evil effects of their misuse. Before the first change comes to a girl 
and she begins to change in form, tell her what she may expect and what it 
means. Tell her about the " flow " and what the sexual relation means and 
how babies come. They will find it out in some way and often to their lasting 
disgrace. Do not let your children go astray through lack of instruction that 
-you might have given them. Parents should treat their boys and girls in 
such a way that they will take them into their confidence in all things. Tell 
the little ones why they should not associate with immoral boys and girls 
and when the crisis comes that changes them into men and women tell them 
what it means and what care they should take of themselves. To my mind 
it rs criminal for parents to bring up their children without some knowledge 
of themselves, 

A CHAPTER FOR YOUNG WOMEN. 

The First Crisis. — When a girl shows the " change " the mother puts 
longer dresses on her. Tell her why. A girl should not grow up so ignorant 
that when the " flow " comes she will try to stop it. I once heard of a girl 
who sat in the snow to stop the first menses. She was very much scared. 
Fortunately an older girl was at hand to tell her what it meant. At 
this time of life a girl needs to give special attention to her dress, amuse- 
ments, habits and work. A girl should never get wet feet when she is " un- 
well ;" she should be protected from the wet and cold. She should not go to 
school during this time unless she can have dry clothing and dry feet. The 
care taken by the girl at this time has much to do with the regularity, pain- 
lessness and efficiency of her "monthly flow." A well girl should not be 
made sick by the appearance of her monthlies. I think the first time it appears 
it would be well for her to remain very quiet and be very careful not to take 



A CHAPTER FOR YOUNG WOMEN 385 

cold. It will not hurt her to lose a few days schooling. At this time of life 
it is well not to study too hard but to pay attention to the health. A girl 
that " comes around " right thS first few years is almost sure to remain that 
Way and especially if she enters this period healthy. The flow Usually begins 
at the age of fourteen or fifteen in this climate. At this time the girl is gener- 
ally very busy with her school work and is often pushed to the limit. This is 
a great mistake and headaches are often frequent. Our school system then 
pulls down the girl's health instead of building it up and many girls enter 
this period totally unprepared for it From the ages of 13 to 17, girls should 
not study too hard. They should have plenty of outdoor life and exercise ; 
they should be free from excitement of every kind and proper attention should 
be given to their health. If such attention is given the menstruation is likely 
to come on gradually and properly and with little pain. Of course there will 
be uneasiness and perhaps some headache. The menses come earlier in warm 
climates and in girls who lead indolent and luxuriant lives; and later in work- 
ing girls. Race also makes a difference. 

The menstrual flow consists of blood, mucous secretion from the womb 
and vagina and epithelial cells from the lining of the womb. It usually lasts 
from two days to a week. The first flow may be short and small in quantity ; 
usually two to nine ounces. Again, it may be very free. In such a case 
quiet is necessary. Nothing need be done unless the flow is so excessive as 
to seriously weaken the girl, when a physician should be called. A good 
household remedy is stick cinnamon. Pour a pint of bqjling water over a 
handful of stick cinnamon and drink freely. Even if a girl does not feel 
bad she should at this time, at least at first, avoid active exercise and amuse- 
ments. No girl, at any time when she is unWel!, should attend dances or 
indulge in undue exercise or get wet. 

Parents need not worry if a weakly girl does not menstruate until she 
is sixteen or seventeen provided she shows no bad symptoms. After 
having menstruated once, a girl frequently misses one or more months. This 
is not unusual and it frequently takes a year or more before she becomes reg- 
tilar. A woman usually menstruates every twenty-eight days but the time 
varies in different persons. The menses sometimes occur regularly every 
two, three or five weeks. When they occur every two weeks the alternate 
flows are usually small in amount. The occurrence of, or the attempt at, 
menstruation every two weeks in a woman who had previously menstruated 
monthly is sometimes a symptom of the beginning of womb disease. Many 
girls menstruate every three or five weeks. For them this is normal. If a 
girl is Unwell every three weeks it usually does not last so long and the flow 
is not so great. Let me repeat that a girl should take the best care of herself 
before and during her first menstrual periods and she will then be very likely 
to be free from painful menstruation unless it is a family inheritance. The 
following is a description which I have taken from an old but reliable writer. 
' " Females usually begin to menstruate about the age of fourteen and 
leave off at about the age of forty-five, which renders these two periods the 
most critical periods of their lives. About the time of the_ first appearance 
of this discharge the constitution undergoes a very considerable change; 
generally, indeed, for the better though sometimes for the worse. The great- 
est care is now necessary as the future health and happiness of the girl de- 
pend in a great measure upon her conduct at this period. 

" If a girl about this period or time of life be confined to the home^ kept 

25 



386 THE PEOPLE'S HOME MEDICAL BOQK. 

constantly sitting, and neither allowed to romp about nor to be employed ni 
any active business which gives exercise to the whole body, she becomes weak, 
relaxed and puny. Her blood not being duly prepared, she looks pale and 
wan ; her health, spirits and vigor decline and she sinks into the invalid state. 
Such is the case with numbers of these unhappy girls, who, either from over 
indulgence or their own narrow circumstances, are at this critical period 
denied the benefit of exercise and fresh air. A lazy indolent disposition proves 
likewise very hurtful to girls at this period.. One seldom meets with com- 
plaints of menstrual tro;ibIe among the properly active and industrious part 
of the sex ; whereas, the indolent and lazy are seldom free from them. These 
are in a manner eaten up by green sickness (chlorosis) and other diseases of 
thi.v nature. We would therefore recommend to all who wish to escape these 
calamities to avoid indolence and inactivity as their greatest enemies and to 
be as much in the open air as possible. Unwholesome food is also very harm- 
ful. Girls often indulge in all manner of trash until their whole system is 
vitiated. Hence ensue indigestion, loss of appetite and a numerous train of 
evils. If the fluids be not duly prepared it is utterly impossible that the secre- 
tions should go on properly. Accordingly we find that such girls as lead an 
indolent life and eat great quantities of trash are not only subject to an ol- 
struction of the menses, but likewise to glandular obstructions, scrofula, eti:. 
A dull dispostion is also very hurtful to girls who do not enjoy good healtl; ; 
while the grave, moping, melancholy creature moves the very prey of vapois 
and hysterics. Youth is the season for mirth and cheerfulness; let it, there- 
fore, be indulged in; it is an absolute duty. To lay in a stock of health in 
time of youth is as necessary a piece of prudence as to make provision against 
decays of old age. While, therefore, wise nature prompts the happy youth 
to join in sprightly amusement, let not the severe dictates of hoary age forbid 
the useful impulse nor damp with serious gloom the season destined to mirth 
and innocent festivity. 

" After a girl has arrived at that period of life when the menses usually 
begin, and they do not appear, but on the contrary her health and spirits begin 
to decline, we would advise, instead of shutting the poor girl up in the house 
and dosing her with medicines, to place her in a situation where she can enjoy 
the benefit of fresh air and agreeable, sensible company. There, let her eat 
wholesome food, take sufficient exercise, bathe daily with cold water, if pos- 
sible, and amuse herself in the most agreeable manner; and we have little 
reason to fear nature, thus assisted, will not do her proper work. Indeed, she 
"seldom fails unless the fault is on our side." 

The flow in the beginning is seldom so instantaneous as to take girls 
unawares if they have been properly instructed. The flow is generally pre- 
ceded by symptoms that foretell its approach, as a sense of heat, weight and 
dull pain in the loins, hardness of the breasts, headache, loss of appetite, 
lassitude, paleness of the countenance and sometimes a little fever. When 
these symptoms appear about the age at which the menstrual flow generally 
begins, everything should be carefully avoided which may obstruct that neces- 
sary and salutary evacuation and all means should be used to promote it if 
necessary. If necessary, a sitz bath can be used but I would not advise teas' 
for the first periods. After the menses have begun the greatest care should be 
taken to avoid everything that may tend to obstruct them. Girls ought to 
be exceedingly cautious of what they eat and drink at this time. Every- 
thing that is cold or likely to disorder the stomach ought to be avoided. 



A CHAPTER FOR YOUNG WOMEN. 387 

Avoid all cold drinks and articles that are hard to digest. As it is impossible to 
mention everything that may disagree with girls at this time, it is well for 
every girl to be very attentive to what disagrees with her and to carefully 
avoid it. Much meat should not be eaten; vinegar, pickles and sour fruits 
should be avoided; also, strong tea and coffee should be avoided at this and 
indeed at all times. Cold is very harmful at this particular time. More of 
the female sex date their diseases from colds caught during the menstrual 
period than from all other causes. This ought surely to put them on their 
guard and to make them very circumspect in their conduct at this time. A 
degree of cold that will not in the least hurt them at other times, will at this 
time be sufificient to entirely ruin their health and constitution. Violent 
passions or affections of the mind, as anger, grief, fear, etc., often occasion 
obstructions and should therefore be avoided if possible. From whatever 
cause the flow is obstructed, except in a state of pregnancy, proper means 
should be used to restore it. For this purpose we would recommend sufficient 
exercise in a dry open air, wholesome diet, cheerful company and innocent, 
harmless amusement. If these fail recourse must be had to medicines. When 
the stoppage of the flow is due to a weak and relaxed state, such medicines as 
tend to promote digestion, brace up the system, and assist in making better 
blood ought to be used, but a discharge should never be forced. Under " Dis- 
orders of Menstruation " will be found much of value in the treatment of these 
troubles. 

Now that the menstrual function has become properly established and 
you have become a young woman, you will need to pay a great deal of atten- 
tion to other matters. I refer to your diet, the bowels, bath, exercise, sleep, 
dress and social functions and later to the company of young men, courtship, 
marriage, etc. Upon all of these subjects the mother should be freely con- 
sulted and thus needs to be well informed. 

The Baths. — A cool sponge bath with quick brisk rubbing every mornirg 
is a splendid tonic. There should also be a general bath once oi twice a week. 
The temperature of the water should not be hot but as cool as you can comfort- 
ably stand it. Put cold water on the back of your neck before you get into the 
bath and that will enable you to use a cooler bath without noticing it so much. 
Or, the water may be cooled after you get into it. Hot water weakens while 
the cool bath stimulates and you are not so likely to take cold as when hot 
water is used and the pores opened. Never go out of doors immediately after 
taking a tub bath. Do not bathe immediately before or after a hearty meal 
nor when you are over heated nor at the time of the menses. 

Diet. — Eat good, hearty, simple food. Avoid pies, cakes, puddings, 
hot biscuits and hot breads. Neither is grease good for you. Do not eat much 
pork unless you' are a very hard worker. The rich foods cause pimples, head- 
aches, constipation, dyspepsia and a bad complexion. Do not drink strong 
tea or coffee as they are stimulating and constipating and are nerve and 
complexion destroyers. Eat slowly. Drink plenty of warm water between 
meals. Milk is gopd if it agrees with you. The less liquid you drink at 
meal times, the quicker and better your food will digest. 

The Bowels. — You should have at least one passage each day and it is 
best to have it after breakfast. Make it a habit to go to the closet at a regular 
hour every day. The movement of the bowels is often a matter of habit. Do 
not let anything interfere with the regular evacuation of the bowels. You 
must be regular in this to be well and to look well. Headaches, poor health 



388 THE PEOPLE'S HOME MEDICAL POOK. 

and bad complexions frequently go with ponstipation. Massage your bosv^ls 
frequently if they are incHned to be constipated. Different exercises and 
rnovemgnts of your body are helpful. Drinking freely of cold vy^ater when 
you get Vfp in the rnorning ts often helpful. It should be drank from half an 
hour to an hour before breakfast. Proper dieting and exprcise are better tjjan 
medicines. If inclined to constipation, eat foods that leave a residnwm. like 
well pooked oatmeal or other cergal. Tea and coffee are constipating. Byt- 
tef and pream are a little loosening. 

Exercise. — Outdoor exercise is the best. Walking is good if you will 
swing your whole body. Tennis is good and so is golf if not indulged in to 
excess. Horse back riding is good and also the taking care of a horse, clean- 
ing, feeding him, etc. This is very good and a valuable aid in curing girls 
who have chlorosis. The exercise should not be too violent and should be 
taken regularly. Carriage and auto riding are good if you do not go so fast 
as to be on a strain. 

Sleep. — You need plenty of sleep and as a rule should be in bed by ten 
o'clock. Young people need a great deal of sleep. If you do not sleep well 
it shows you are not well or that you are living wrong. Never take drugs to 
cause sleep. \ 

Dress. — Another very harmful thing to girls and young women is their 
dress. They are fond of a fine shape and foolishly imagine that this can be ae-^ 
quired by lacing. Hence, by squeezing their body they confine the lungs, choke 
the stomach, and press the liver and bowels out of place, causing incurable 
maladies. There are many women who will go throttgh life sufifering from the 
dreadful effects of this wretched custom of squeezing every girl into as small 
a size at the waist as possible, Human invention could not possibly have 
devised a practice more destructive to health. 

The dress should always be comfortable. The skirts should be fastened 
so as not to drag at the hips. A corset is all right if it is not tight but who 
ever saw a woman who would admit that it was ever tight. A tight corset 
|>resses upon and injures the lower part of the lungs causing difficult breath- 
ing 5 it compresses the heart in the chest cavity ; presses the stomach, liver and 
bowels out of place often causing indigestion and it also causes dxsplaoer 
ment of the womb and ovaries with their attendant evils„ 

A good quality of flannel ought to be worn seven or eight months of 
the year and it would be better if it were worn throughout the year. Of 
course it should be of light texture in the summer and the underclothing 
may then be sleeveless if desired. Shoes, stockings, skirts and other clothing 
should never be worn while wet unless you can keep moving. When you 
cease moving, wet clothing should be changed for dry. Before putting on the 
dry clothing the whole body should be rubbed briskly with a coarse towej 
as a prevention against taking cold. 

Going into Society.-r-You should not go into society too young. Yau 
are not then fully grown up and matured and you cannot stand the pace and 
if you do apparently stand it you will sacrifice your red cheeks and wrinkle? 
will furrow your face. Your mother and father are your best advisers still 
and will continue to be for some years, and you will need their advice in seek- 
ing your companions of both sexes. Your parents have been through it all 
and know boys and girls, young men and young women, better than you do. 
They are better readers of character for they have the knowledge that comes 
only with experience.

good character and pure in heart and life. It is so much better to remain 
Single than to make an unfortunate marriage. 

A CHAPTER FOR MARRIED WOMEN. 

Who Should Not Marry. — Not all women should marry because all women 
ought not to be mothers. A, woman with poor physical or mental health 
should not marry, for such a woman as a rule will not bear healthy children. 
No woman with consumption should marry, neither should she marry if she 
has any specific disease. This applies to men as well as to women. The 
time will come when the state for its own protection will be compelled to 
make laws governing marriage. Any mental disease on either or both sides 
should be a sufficient cause for prohibiting marriage, for the offspring of such 
B marriage are likely to be endowed with a fearful heritage. Women who 
intend never to bear and rear children have no right to marry for this means 
the taking of measures to prevent conception or the getting rid of the product 
of conception and the latter is, in plain English, abortion. 

Abortion and the Prevention of Conception. — There is a great deal of 
abortion being produced in all classes of society. Abortion is not only danger- 
ous to the woman's life (and of course it destroys the life of the child) but 
it injures the generative organs. The womb may never get over the ill efifects 
of abortion and many women are thus doomed to poor health for the rest 
of their lives. Then, if at any time afterward, children are desired, the womart 
is likely to miscarry and may never be able to bear a child. I say nothing 
of the sin. I leave that to those who ought to teach these things to the young 
while they are yet in the formative period of life. Abortion is frequently 
caused by women themselves either by the aid of medicines or mechanical 
means and, to the shame of my profession, it must be said that there are 
medical men who do it for the sake of financial gain. Whenever abortfon is 
performed, not only the health but the life of the woman is at stake. 

As to the prevention of conception, most of the means used are very in- 
jurious and especially so to the woman. During my thirty" years of, the prac- 
tice of medicine I have seen a great deal of trouble and sorrow caused by the 
production of abortion and by many of the means used for the prevention of 
conception. 



390 THE PEOPLE'S HOME MEDICAL BOOK 

How to Conceive and Bear Healthy Children. — ^The one main reason for 
the establishment of marriage was for the bearing and rearing of children. 
Nature has provided for man and woman the orga 'or this purpose and they 
are wonderfully constructed. The woman who enters the marriage state with 
the intention of not bearing and raising children has a mistaken idea of its 
intent and will make both herself and her husband unhappy and miserable 
and when it is too late she will bitterly repent of her folly. Children make a 
home happier and the woman who bears them will be healthier and happier 
for it. If trained properly, children bring happiness to their parents and are 
a solace and comfort in their old age. 

To the woman who marries with the intention of filling the place for 
which she was made, I offer a few suggestions as to how to conceive and bear 
healthy, happy children. If the parents are moderately healthy themselves it 
is true to a great extent that they can have the kind of children they wish. 
Very m.uch depends upon the physical and mental condition of the parents 
at the time of conception. If parents are drunk at the time the child is con- 
ceived they cannot expect healthy offspring, either physically or mentally. 
If the parents dislike each other they will transmit something of that disposi- 
tion to their offspring. If either one or both of the parents are much worried 
at the time of conception the child will be the sufferer. Let me instance a true 
case that not only cast a life-long stigma upon the child begotten at that time, 
but brought never-ending regret to the parents. " A father had the pleasure 
of seeing two of his sons grow up strong and vigorous, mentally and phys» 
ically, while a third was weak, irresolute, fretful, suspicio'js, and half demented. 
He confessed to his physician the cause of this family mishap in these words. 
' In the summer of IS — I failed, owing to my rogue of a partner's running off 
with all our money. No man, perhaps, ever felt such a misfortune more keenly 
than I did, and it seemed to me I should never get over the shock. I was com- 
pletely unmanned and feared I should go crazy. Well, during this state 
of things my wife conceived and there is the result, poor S — . He inherits 
just the state of mind I was then in.* " " The sins of the parents are visited 
upon the children to the third and fourth generations." 

Therefore, to beget healthy and happy children the parents must be in 
the best physical and mental condition. This may sound strange to some of 
my readers but it is true. A cross and unhealthy child is so by inheritance or 
training. 

Pregnancy. — After you become pregnant, you owe it to yourself, your 
husband and especially to your unborn little one, to see that it comes into 
this world endowed with' everything that a true, good and devoted mother 
can possibly give it both physically and mentally. To this end keep yourself 
well and happy. Eat only such foods as are easily digested and that will keep 
your bowels regular. Read only such books as will tend to make you happier 
and better. Choose the company of those whom you feel will lift you up. 
Gossips will not do this so do not listen to croakers who are so ready to 
converse with you at this time. You should get all the sleep you can so do 
not have company in the evening that will worry you. In short, eat only 
such food as agrees with you, make your bowels move every day, keep the 
kidneys in good working order and keep cheerful and you will get through 
your labor in good shape and be a proud mother. Pregnancy is a natural 
condition and you can make it comfortable by the care you take of yourself. 
Most women, fortunately,vgo through labor all right and by taking proper care 



A CHAPTER FOR MARRIED WOMEN. 391 

of yourself you will do the same and be made happy in the possession of a 
little likeness of yourself and husband. 

God made woipan in such a way that she can have babies. It is not an 
abnormal condition but is a natural physiological act and if, at and before the 
time of labor, proper care and attention are given, the woman will be healthier 
and far happier if she bears children. Prevention of conception in any way 
is injurious. Getting rid of the product of conception is not only dangerous 
but sinful and is injurious to the health of the woman. If a woman finds 
herself pregnant she should immediately determine that she will have the 
healthiest baby possible. With this in view she should take the best care of 
herself in every way. She should keep herself not only in good physical but 
also in good mental health. The clothing should be comfortable in every 
way. The food should be healthful, sufficient and nourishing. She should 
eliminate trash and greasy food. She should not stimulate herself with drinks, 
tea, coffee, etc. Her bowels should be kept regular through diet or by thv 
aid of medicine. Her mind should be kept healthy with pleasant thoughts, 
agreeable company, and enjoyable reading. A mother can have a good baby 
if she has pleasant and healthy surroundings. Given such conditions and if 
she is healthy herself she can have a good and healthy baby. So she should 
keep herself healthy and sweet tempered and then when her baby is born it 
will have a goodly heritage whether it be born in a palace or in a hovel. 

SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS OF PREGNANCY. 

Cessation or Stopping of Menses. — If the menstrual periods stop without 
any other apparent cause and the woman misses one period, she may be 
pregnant. Especially is this the case if the woman has previously been reg- 
ular. If she has been irregular, of course missing one period may not mean 
much. A single menstrual period may be missed by women who fear the 
probability of pregnancy. Usually, however, missing a period, especially 
with married women, is an important sign of pregnancy. 

Changes in the Breasts. — The changes in a woman's breasts in the first 
pregnancy are quite characteristic. The woman in the early weeks complains 
most frequently of a soreness, tenderness arid prickling in these regions. 
After the second month the breasts begin to increase in size as they be- 
cbme larger a delicate tracery of bluish veins appears just beneath the skin. 
The nipples soon become considerably larger and more erectile and, after the 
first few months, a thin yellowish fluid (colostrum) may be pressed from them 
by gentle massage. The coloring darkens around the nipples and becomes 
broader and. much more deeply pigmented. This depends upon the complexion 
of the individual. In blondes the areolae and nipples assume a pinkish appear- 
ance, while in brunettes they become dark brown and occasionally almost 
black. 

The Kidneys, Bladder and Urine. — ^The kidneys act more frequently and 
the urine is considerably increased in quantity. The urine should be examined 
frequently by a physician during pregnancy. As the womb enlarges it rises 
up into the abdominal cavity and carries the bladder with it. Before this, 
pregnancy often causes trouble with the bladder and there is more frequent 
passing of the urine. Sometimes the passing of urine is painful and some- 
times there is an inability to hold the urine. 

Nausea and Vomiting or " Morning Sickness." — The establishment of 
pregnancy is often marked by sickness at the stomach and vomiting. This 



398 THE PEOPLE'S HOME MEDICAL BOOK. 

occurs in a large per cent, of the cases. It is frequently called the rtjorijiijg 
sickness and, as the name implies, it usually comes in the earlier part of the 
day. This symptom usually appears about the end of the first month and 
lasts for from six to eight weeks although some patients suffer longer. In 
treating morning sickness be careful about the diet. Eat nourishing, easily 
digested foods and foods if possible that leave a residuum so that the bowels 
may be regulated by the diet. Constipation frequently accompanies this 
nausea and vomiting. The patient should eat as much fruit as possible if it 
does not disorder the stomach. Stay out of doors as much as possible. The 
bowels should always be kept open and if this cannot be done by dieting it 
must be done with medicines. Sick stomachs and headaches in pregnant 
women are frequently caused by constipated bowels., Salts may be used be^ 
fore breakfast; just enough to cause one or at most two passages daily. All 
articles of food that sicken should be avoided. Milk often disagrees and is 
frequently constipating. Buttermilk sometimes agrees with the patient. 
Keep the kidneys working freely by drinking plenty of water. Bathe fre^ 
quently with cold or cool water. Gently rub the abdomen, back, hips and 
thighs. If other means fail to give relief, oxalate of cerium, in 5-grain doses, 
after meals will be found a good remedy. 

People's Home Remedies for Morning Sickness. — 

1. Wild Yam and Swamp Dogwood. — Make a decoction of the root of 
wild j'^am and the bark of swamp dogwood and take from J to 4 ounces every 
^4 to 2 hours until relieved. s 

3. Coffee, Toast, Lemonade, Etc. — Morning sickness during pregnancy 
may often be avoided by taking a little coffee and toast in bed each morning 
before arising. Lemonade, smoked herring and sardines are good in some 
cases. 

S. Teas. — To prevent morning sickness the patient should drink a eup of 
peppermint or chamomile tea about an hour before rising each morning. A tea 
made from red rose willow bark is also good. 
People's Home Remedy for Piles in Pregnant Women. — 

Cream of Tartar and Molasses. — For piles in pregnant women, prevent 
icostiveness by taking cream of tartar in teaspoorJul doses mixed with 
molasses or water. If the tumors are painful apply a poultice of slippery elm 
bark, and milk or water. At the same time apply two or three times a day 
an ointment made of four teaspoonfuls of spirits of turpentine apd two table- 
spoonfuls of fresh unsalted butter. These should be well mixed. 
People's Home Remedy for Sour Stomach, Heartburn or Dyspepsia of Preg- 
nant Woroen. — 

1. Lemon. — A slice of sugared lemon held in the mouth will often give 
relief. 

Quickening. — This occurs about the 18th or 20th week, the woman being 
conscious of slight fluttering movements in her abdomen which gradually 
increase in intensity. These are usually due to the movements of the child 
(foetus) and their appearance is designated as " quickening " or the " percep- 
tion of life." In rare instances it has occurred as early as the 10th week, 

Cravings.-^Occasionally the appetite becomes very capricious and the 
woman evinces an unconquerable desire for peculiar and sometimes revoltinK 
articles of food. 

Enlargement pf Abdomen.^There is a gradual enlargement of the womb 



A CHAPTER FOR MARRIED WOMEN. 393 

This causes an enlargemeht of the abdotnen which becomes quite noticeable 
at about the fourth month when the top of the woihb is above the pelvic bone. 
It is midway to the navel at the fifth month. The abdomen increases in size 
up to the time of labor. 

Cervix or Neck of the Womb. — Beginning ".'ith the second month of preg- 
nancy the cervix or neck of the womb becomes considerably softened and in 
the first pregnancy the outer opening of the wOmb (os externum) offers to 
the finger a sensation or feeling similar to that obtained by pressing upon 
the more yielding lips of the mouth instead of the harder cartilage of the nose. 

The Foetal or Baby Heart. — This can usually be heard about the 18th or 
20th week. Ordinarily it beats from 120 to 140 per minute. 

. Later Symptoms. — Several weeks before the onset of labor, the abdomen, 
or belly, undergoes a marked change in shape, its lower portion becoming 
more pendulous (hanging down) whereas in the costal (rib) region it looks 
decidedly flat. The woman feels as if her waist line had become lower. 
The breathing is easier but walking becomes more difficult and the Woman 
may suffer from severe cramp-like pains in the lower limbs and there maiy be 
a more frequent desire to urinate. During the last few weeks of pregnancy 
the vaginal secretion is increased in amount, the lips of the vagina become 
more swollen and open more or less widely. Not infrequently the patient may 
experience a few transient pains for a number of days before confinement and 
especially is this likely to be true if the bowels are constipated. The duration 
of pregnancy is usually about forty weeks. 

In the Baby Department more will be found concerning pregnancy and 
labor. 

LABOR. 
Preparations for Labor. — You should have on hand the following articles. 

5 basins, 

1 two-quart fountain syringe, 
15 yards unsterilized gauze, 

6 sanitary bed pads ; or, 

2 pounds cotton batting for making same, 
1 piece rubber sheeting, size 1 by 2 yds., 
1 piece rubber sheeting, size % by 1 yd., 
4 ounces permanganate of potash, 

8 aunces oxalic acid, 
4 ounces boric acid, 
1 tube green soap, 

1 tube vaseline, 

100 Bernay's bichloride tablets, 
8 ounces alcohol, 

2 drams ergotc.j, 

1 nail brush, 

2 pounds absorbent cotton, 
Squibb's chloroform. 

The nurse should prepare enough bed and perineal pads. Sterilize them 
a week before, together with towels or diapers, 1 sheet, % pound absorbent 
cotton and some cotton pledgets or gauze sponges. At commencement of 
labor she should prepare two large pitchers of boiled water, keeping one hot. 



394 THE PEOPLE'S HOME MEDICAL BOOK. 

and cover them carefully v/ith a sterile towel. The above is a good list oi 
articles to have on hand but in some cases it may not be possible to have all 
these things. 

Care and cleanliness upon the part of the attendants are essential. A 
great many cases of childbed fever are produced by carelessness. This is 
putting it mildly. Some attendants want to do too much and some have dirty 
hands. Also, some parts of the after-birth are sometimes left in the womb 
and produce trouble. The doctor or midwife who attends a woman during 
confinement assumes a serious responsibility The troubles occurring at this 
time are mostly due to the carelessness of the doctor, midwife, nurse, or lastly, 
of the patient herself. Labor is a physiological process and with proper care 
a healthy woman will come through it well. Septic troubles are usually due 
to carelessness. 

Presentation (Part to Come First). — Presentation refers to the position 
of the child. According to Schroeder the head comes first in 90 per cent, of 
the cases. So, fortunately, nature has done good work and if the woman's 
pelvis is normal the labor comes off r^giilarly and safely. Comparatively, 
very few women die in labor. 

Breech Presentation. — This does not often occur. It simply means that 
the breech or buttocks come first instead of the head. The labor is then longer 
and more dangerous to the child and especially when the head of the child is 
engaged by the bones of the mother. The cord is then pressed upon and the 
circulation of the child is stopped, so that the head must be born quickly or, 
the child will suffocate. In breech cases I always have warm and cold watei 
ready in two separate tubs. I quickly cut the cord and if the child does not 
breathe, I do not tie the cord until I have started the breathing by the fol- 
lowing measures. First cleanse the child's mouth with your finger and remove 
all the mucus. Then with your hand dash the cold and hot water alternately 
upon the child's breast and at the same time slap it lightly upon the seat with 
your hand. If this does not cause breathing, alternately put the child into the 
tub of cold and warm water, keeping its head above water. If necessary, 
use artificial respiration. As soon as breathing has started tie the cord as 
directed elsewhere. 

Sometimes, in breech cases, you find one foot down. Treat in the same 
way as for breech. If in the labor you find a hand and arm, and in feeling up 
along the arm you reach the womb and find the child's body, you are very 
likely to have a shoulder presentation. This does not often occur but when it 
does it means you must turn the child in the womb and you must get busy 
at once and do it. Fortunately, nature generally presents the head first and if 
the woman is well and the parts are large enough everything is likely to go 
well. 

Labor Pains. — The pain usually begins in the sacral (back) region and 
slowly passes to the abdomen and down the thighs. The pain is different in 
different individuals. In some it is very severe. At the onset of labor the 
pains usually come on at intervals of from 15 to 30 minutes and as labor ad- 
vances they become more frequent and eventually occur every 3 or 3 minytes. 
Their average duration is one minute. 

Duration, of Labor. — The time varies greatly in different cases. It usu- 
ally lasts about six hours. In the first labor it is usually longer. 

The First Stage of Labor. — About the end of the tenth lunar month (380 
days) the woman begins to experience cramp-like pains in the lower portion 



A CHAPTER FOR MARRIED WOMEN. 395 

of the abdomen. These she frequently mistakes for colic. At first they come 
at long intervals. They are most marked in the region of the back and grad- 
ually extend towards the abdomen and down the thighs. As they become 
more frequent their severity increases. Then the " show "appears. The pa- 
tient is quite corhfortable between the pains. After a time there is a sudden 
gush of clear fluid from the vagina, which, in the majority of cases, indicates 
that the cervix or neck of the womb has become dilated and that the mem- 
branes have ruptured. Sometimes this rupture of the membranes occurs be- 
fore complete dilation of the cervix and occasionally it occurs even before the 
onset of labor. In such cases labor proceeds more slowly. These are called 
" dry " labors. 

The Second Stage of Labor. — For a time after this watery discharge there 
is a lull in the labor pains after which they recur more frequently and vigor- 
ously and compel the patient to take to her bed. The child at this time de- 
scends to the pelvis and after a time the patient experiences a marked desire 
to go to stool, which indicates that the head has passed into the pelvic cavity 
and is pressing upon the lower bowel (rectum). In a short time the pelvic 
floor begins to bulge with each pain and a little later the scalp of the baby 
may be seen at the opening. With each pain the perineum bulges more and 
more and the vulva becomes more and more dilated and distended by the head. 
The head advances a little with each pain and recedes in the intervals between 
them. This continues until the temple bones become engaged in the vulva 
(opening) when further going back is impossible and soon the head is born. 
In the majority of cases the perineum (flesh between the vulva and anus) is 
torn, but usually this is only to a slight extent. 

Immediately after its birth the head falls backward so that the face 
touches the anus or opening of the bowel. Soon the back of the head turns 
toward one of the thighs (the head should be supported by your hand) and 
eventually the head assumes a sidewise positidn. The perineum is now 
quite tightly drawn around the neck of the infant whose face in consequence 
becomes marked and dark and the inexperienced attendant often has an al- 
most uncontrollable desire to seize and extract the head by pulling upon it. 
This, however, is usually unnecessary for the next pain forces the upper 
shoulder down under the pelvic bone where it becomes fixed ; while the lower 
or back shoulder passes over the anterior margin of the perineum after which 
the body of the child is rapidly expelled. 

The Third Stage of Labor. — The pains cease and the patient feels more 
comfortable. Now the womb has become much smaller and forms a solid 
lump, barely reaching the navel. After a time the contractions of the womb 
and the pains commence once more and the woman begins to bear down. 
A few minutes later the body of the womb may be seen to rise up a little 
and a slight swelling appears immediately above the symphysis pubis. This 
shows that the placenta (afterbirth) has become separated from the inside 
of the womb and is now in the lower part of the womb or the upper part of 
the vagina. From this position it is expelled by the action of the abdominal 
muscles. In some women the entire placental period may be stopped almost 
instantly within a few minutes after the birth of the child, while in others 
the placenta may remain for hours unless forced out by, proper manipulation. 
In this stage there is always some bleeding and not infrequently the patient 
has a chill during this period or immediately after its completion. This, in 



396 THE PEOPLE'S HOME MEDICAL BOOK. 

itself, although it may appear somewhat alarming, has no significance as it is 
merely because of the nervous condition of the patient. 

Delivery of the Child. — Before labor the patient should be bathed and 
given an injection to move the bowels. The bed should be properly pre- 
pared but the patient need not yet go to bed. Wash the vulva and inner 
surfaces of the thighs as everything must be clean for the attendant- The 
physician or midwife should be thoroughly clean (aseptic). Gloves are now 
often worn and they must be sterile. Too frequent examinations should be 
avoided. Watch the case carefully after you have found out the presenta- 
tion and handle the genital parts as little as possible. If everything is all 
right you can do nothing at first. When the head presses on the perineum 
and that is h^rd, keep the head back until the perineum is softened and in 
better shape, While the head is being born keep it from pressing on the 
perineum as much as possible. As soon as the head is born, clean the mouth 
and at the same time see if the cord is around the neck of the child. If it is, 
it should be removed. Hold the head in your hand and simply assist when 
things are going right. When the child is born, if it is all right, hand it to 
the nurse and attend to the mother. If the child does not act as it should 
and the mother is all right, then you should attend to the child. If necessary, 
warm and cold water may be used to start breathing as directed under 
" Breech Presentation." Artificial respiration may have to be resorted to 
and should be kept up for half an hour or longer if necessary. 

Dressing and Tying the Cord. — Tie the cord with a stout clean thread . 
tight enough to prevent bleeding. It should be tied from II/2 to 2 inches 
from the body. Then put sterilized absorbent cotton around the cord ^nd 
close to the body. Turn the cord up over the cotton, put a similar layer of 
cotton over the cord and then put on the bandage. If you do not have the 
Sterilized cotton you can use an old but clean linen handkerchief. Cut a 
block three inches square and vise two thicknesses. In the center cut an 
opening ; grease the cord and then put it .through the opening being certain 
that the cloth is close to the body of the child. Turn the cord up over the 
cloth and put over this two thicknesses of linen the size of the first pieces 
and then apply the bandage. The cord is usually tied before being cut, the 
exception being when the child is nearly dead and does not breathe properly. 
In such a case it is best to leave the cord untied so that it may bleed a little 
and aid in establishing respiration. 

Delivery of the Afterbirth (plgcenta). — After the child is born see whether 
the womb of the mother is contracted or soft. You must look out for bleed- 
ing. If the afterbirth is not delivered and the woman flows much, then it 
must be delivered. Press on the top side of the womb and keep pressing 
gently while the placenta is being expelled. In this way you can keep hojd 
of the womb and produce the contraction after the placenta is expelled, With 
the other hand you should take hold of the cord and simply assist but do npt 
pull. When the placenta comes it should be twisted so as to twist the mem- 
branes. If the womb is large after the placenta is expelled you are very 
likely to have clots in the womb from the bleeding and it may be necessary 
for you to put your hand into the womb and release the clots. Be sure that 
the hand is perfectly clean, At the same time keep the other hand on the 
abdomen and hold the womb; and if it is not contracted the hand or finger 
in the womb and the hand orl the wotjib outside will stpp bkeding and soon 
produce contraction, 



A CHAPTER FOR M^VRRIED WOMEN. 397 

If there is but little bleeding but the womb is hard and soft by turns, 
gently rub the abdomen over the womb with the hand. The Womb should 
be low down and not much larger than the fist. Never leave the patient until 
an hour after the placenta has been delivered and not then unless the Wofflb 
has been thoroughly contracted and remains so. 

Hemorrhage or Bleeding.— If the bleeding is very severe you should put 
one hand into the womb (being sure the hand is perfectly clean) and at the 
same time keep the other hand on the belly or abdomen and hold the womb< 
With one hand in the womb and the other outside and over it they may be 
p,ressed together and the flow of blood checked. Ergot is often given for 
bleeding. You can give a teaspoonful at once and half a teaspoonful again 
in half an hour if necessary. If no ergot is at hand, put a teaspoOriful of 
boiled vinegar into a glass one-third full of water and give two teaspoOnfuls 
frequently. Or, you can give two teaspoonfuls of a tea made by putting a 
handful of stick cinnamon into a pint of boiling water. GaUze Cloths may be 
wrung out of vinegar water and put into the womb but this treatment needs 
an experienced hand. Raising the foot of the bed and keeping the head Idw 
will aid m.uch. The fluid extract of cranesbill is also good wherl cloths are 
wet in it and put into the womb. A tea made from cranesbill will do as well 
as the fluid extract. 

Caution. — In case the attendants discover birthmarks or any deformity 
of the child, they should use every precaution to prevent the mother's know- 
ing or suspecting them as it may grieve her to the extent of causing convul- 
sions and consequent injury. 

DISEASES ATTENDING AND FOLLOWING PREGNANCY AND 

LABOR. 



Dropsy. 

A pregnant woman should attend to this immediately. It may amount 
to nothing or it may mean much. It may appear under the eyes or in the 
lower extremities or it may be genera! and involve any portion of the body. 
It may be due to pressure if the kidneys are working well. A physiciatl 
should be called. 

Eclampsy— (Convulsions). 

This is an acute disease which may occur in pregnant women, before, 
during, or after confinement. Eclampsy is characterized by convulsions. 
The treatment should be preventive. This is very important. Frequent 
examination of the urine should be made during pregnancy, once a month 
at least for the first six months and oftener thereafter. If the woman has 
headaches, disturbance of vision or dropsy the doctor must be nofified. 
Be on the lookout for albumen in the urine. See if there is a normal amount 
6f urea in the Urine. If this falls considerably below normal and a con- 
siderable amount of albumen is present, the patient is in danger and must 
be watched closely. Examine the urine daily. In such cases treatment must 
be given by a doctor. In this way many cases of eclampsy will be avoided. 
Rest in bed, live on a milk diet and keep the bowels open and the skin func- 
tions good. Proper treatment is often followed by better symptoms — an 
increased flow of urine, less albumen and an excretion of more urea. If the 
disease continues labor must be induced. 



398 THE PEOPLE'S HOME MEDICAL BOOK. 

Child-Bed Fever — Puerperal Fever — Puerperal Infection. 

CAUSES. — The most usual cause of this disease is the dirty hands 
of the doctor or midwife. Unclean hands, instruments, syringes and clothes 
are the causes. Cleanliness of person and clothing is necessary in the at- 
tendants. Disease of the attendants or poisons from diseases they carelessly 
carry with them also cause child-bed fever. 

SYMPTOMS. — The patient feels tired and has headache and some chilli- 
ness. After everything has gone smoothly for the first three or four days 
there is a rising temperature, 103 degrees or higher. At the same time there 
is some tenderness in the lower abdomen. The womb is larger and is sensi- 
tive to pressure. The discharge is increased in quantity and is pactly bloody 
and partly purulent in character and in the purely septic forms it is prac- 
tically devoid of odor. If the temperature is very high the secretion is often 
diminished and occasionally disappears entirely. In reality, in the most 
virulent cases and especially in those due to pure streptococcus infection 
there is very little if any odor to be noticed in the discharge. 
TREATMENT.— 

The treatment should be of a preventive nature. The most scrupulous 
cleanliness immediately before and during labor is the means upon which 
we have mainly to rely in limiting the disease. This cleanliness applies not 
only to the doctor and midwife but also to the nurse or to any one who comes 
in contact with the patient. If a douche is necessary after labor it must be 
cleanly given. Everything that comes in contact with the mother's gener-. 
ative organs must be thoroughly aseptic; then it is simply impossible to 
poison her with germs. 

Curative treatment must be given by one thoroughly aseptic and who 
understands the case. Curetting of the womb may be necessary though 
any debris may generally, be removed from the womb with the fingers and 
this is the safer way. After the womb has been cleaned out a douche of sterile 
salt solution should be given. 
PEOPLE'S HOME REMEDIES.— 

1. Hot Fomentations, Etc. — Hot fomentations of tansy and hops are 
excellent when applied to the abdomen and should be renewed often. Stra- 
monium leaves are also valuable when bruised and applied to the abdomen 
as a warm fomentation. If the fever still continues and the tongue is 
coated, give, in 15-grain doses every three hours, equal parts of powdered 
blue flag root, blood root and nitre. Also apply a mustard plaster to the 
feet, back of the neck and the inside of the thighs. 

Physician's Remarks. — A doctor should always be called for the treat- 
ment of this disease. 

Milk Leg. 
(Phlegmasia Alba Dolens.) 

This disease is rare, though when it does appear it is generally during 
the second week after labor or later. 

SYMPTOMS. — The first symptom is pain along the vessels of the inner 
part of the thigh. In thin individuals these vessels may be felt as hard 
sensitive cords. At the same time swelling appears in the feet and soon 
extends upwards. This swelling is associated with severe pain and usu- 
ally lasts for a considerable time. Months may elapse before the patient 
can walk with comfort. 



A CHAPTER FOR MARRIED WOMEN. 399 

TREATMENT.— 

Relieve the painful symptoms and attend to the general health. Open 
the bowels with salts. Aconite and belladonna are good in small doses. Give 
witch hazel locally and internally. Apply hot applications. 
PEOPLE'S HOME REMEDIES.— 

1. Vinegar and Salt — Tansy, Hops, Boneset, Etc. — In case of milk leg 
the bowels should be thoroughly purged every two or three days and the 
leg frequently bathed with a mixture of vinegar, salt and water. Also, occa- 
sionally bathe the leg with a tea of bitter herbs such as tansy, hops and 
boneset. 

2. Mayweed, Smartweed, Etc. — To induce sweating the patient should 
drink freely of a tea made of mayweed and smartweed. Should the disease 
become chronic, one of the best things to do is to steam the leg daily over 
a hot decoction of tansy, boneset and hops and apply twice daily the follow- 
ing liniment. The liniment is made by mixing 3 ounces of spirits of cam- 
phor, 3 ounces of sweet oil, ly^ ounces of laudanum and 1^ ounces of 
creosote. 

Sore Nipples. 
(See Baby^ Department.) 
PEOf'LE'S HOME REMEDIES.— 

1. Partridge Berry. — Take two bunces of the fresh herb and make a 
strong decoction in a pint of boiling water; strain and add as much cream 
as there is liquid. Boil the whole down to the consistency of a soft salve 
and when cool anoint the nipples each time after the child has nursed. 

Caked and Broken Breasts. 

(See Baby Department.) 
PEOPLE'S HOME REMEDIES.— 

1. Catalpa Leaves. — Leaves of the catalpa tree wilted and applied are 
good for caked breasts. 

2. Ginger and Honey. — For sore and caked breasts spread some strained 
honey on a cloth and sprinkle thick with ginger and lay on the breast as 
warm as can be borne. 

3. Brandy. — Ring flannels out of hot brandy and apply to broken 
i)reasts. 

4. Poke Root Poultice. — Roast some freshly dug poke root in ashes 
until soft and then mix with hot water and apply to caked breasts. 

Physician's Remarks. — Poke root poultices thus prepared are excellent 
applications for troubles of this kind. 

5. Beeswax and Sweet Oil. — When lumps or cakes remain after the in- 
flammation has subsided apply a plaster made of beeswax and sweet oil to 
the breasts. 

6. Vinegar and Hop Poultices. — For broken breasts apply warm vinegar 
or hop poultices. 

7. Camphor, Etc. — Bathe the breasts three times a day the first three 
or four days with a liniment made of equal parts of camphor, oil of cajeput 
and oil of sassafras. Follow each application with an ointment made by 
taking % ounce of yellow beeswax, 1^4 ounces of finely cut castile soap 
and 1 ounce of lard. Melt these slowly and before cool add 8 drams of 
Jamaica spirits in which there have been dis-solved 30 grains of camphor. 



400 THE PEOPLE'S HOME MEDICAL BOOK. 

This may be applied to the breasts by cutting a hole for the nipple in the 
center of a piece of linen the size of the breast and spreading the ointment on 
the cloth. It should be applied as warm as can be borne and removed and 
heated every five or six hours to keep it soft. Bathe with the liniment each 
time before applying the ointment. If matter forms apply either bread and 
milk or a slippery elm poultice. ' 

PhysiciaJl's Remarks. — Camphor will stop the secretion of milk but in 
case of a broken breast this will probably not be of importance. 

Abortion. 

Among medical men it is customary to speak of all cases occurring be- 
fore the 38th week as abortions. Generally it is called a miscarriage. Some 
call it an abortion only when it occurs before the 16th week and it is then 
called a miscarriage if it occurs between the 16th and 38th weeks and after 
that time, if occurring before the natural time, it is called premature labor. 
Abortion, miscarriage or premature labor is an "Expulsion of the foetus or 
child before its natural time. 

CAUSES. — It is difficult to tell the percentage of accidental cases. Be- 
sides being a criminal offense and destroying the life of the child the pur- 
posely causing of abortion is very dangerous to the woman's life and health. 
Syphilis, displftcenients of the womb, diseases of the womb, diseases of the 
heart and kidneys, sugar diabetes, and fright and grief sometimes cause an 
abortion. During the first four months diseases and displacements of the 
womb cause many of the cases while after that time syphilis and Bright's 
disease play a very important part. 
TREATMENT.— 

Threatened miscarriage or abortion calls for the services of a doctor. 
The woman should immediately take to her bed at the first sign of flowing 
or pain. For the pain the patient should be put to bed and given a hypoder- 
mic of 1/4 grain of morphine at once. This should be followed by 1 grain 
rectal suppositories of extract of opium which should be repeated every 
'4 to 6 hours. The Indiart women used herbs for threatened abortion. Black 
Haw was one of the remedies and is good for threatened miscarriage and as 
a preventive in cases of habitual miscarriage. It should be taken one or two 
weeks previous to the time of the former miscarriage and should be con- 
tinued to the end of pregnancy. The dose of the tea is half an otince several 
times a day and the dose of the tincture is a teaspoonfuj 4 or 5 times a day. 
This is also very good for after-pains. 
TREATMENT.— 

Preventive Treatment. — It is best to prevent abortion if poGsible. 
Doctor the diseases which cause it. A woman who has once had this 
misfortune is very likely to have it again, and perhaps more liable to it 
at the same month of pregnancy that it first occurred. Special care should 
be taken to prevent this. The woman should not be subjected to fright, 
anger or grief and should not lift heavy articles and should not ride on the 
cars, train or automobile or after a fractious horse. She should also keep 
away from the water. She should lead a very quiet life for a month before 
and a month after the time she first miscarried. Miscarriage is very bad 
in its effects on the health of a woman. It is likely to leave a long train of 
ills behind it. There may be flowing or a foul discharge for some time. If 
this is the case it may be that part of the afterbirth has been left in the 



A CHAPTER FOR WOMEN OF FORTY-FIVE. 401 

womb and there may be inflammation. Leucorrhea, due to disease or a torn 
cervix, may be one of the after effects of abortion. 

A CHAPTER FOR WOMEN OF FORTY-FIVE. 

The " change of life " or " menopause " is the final stopping or " cessa- 
tion " of menstruation and occurs between the fortieth and fiftieth years. 
There are cases that occur earlier and some that occur later. The flow may 
gradually diminish in amount until it disappears entirely or it may stop ab- 
ruptly or there may occur one or more intervals of one, two or three months 
or more duration and be followed by one or more normal flows. Profuse 
bleeding at this time and slight bleeding occurring more often than monthly 
are, unfortunately, thought by most women to be of little account and as a 
part of the normal phenomena of the change through which they are pasg- 
mg. The same may be said of the apparent reappearance of menstruation 
or of irregular bleedings occurring after the menopause has been established , 
and menstruation has been absent for many months. Such appearances are 
not normal. They should always excite the alarm of the woman for they 
demand immediate attention. As a rule the flooding is caused by some dis- 
eased condition of the. womb, as inflammation, polypi, fibroid tumors, or 
cancer. The mild lesions may disappear with the progressive dwindling of 
the womb and the flow may cease. Many women undoubtedly recover with- 
out treatment and are thus confirmed in their belief that such irregular 
bleedings are a normal part of the change of life and the unfortunate women 
with cancers are thus encouraged to delay seeking advice and treatment 
until it is too late. 

The normal changes that occur in the genital organs at the menopause 
are wasting or atrophic in character. If the woman is in good health and 
has no disease of the womb, tubes or ovaries the menopause may become 
established without any marked general disturbance. In many cases, how- 
ever, very annoying general symptoms appear and last for one or two years 
before the woman becomes adapted to the altered conditions. There may be 
headaches, flashes of heat, nervous depression, derange lent of the digestive 
apparatus and other functional disturbances. The woman often becomes 
very fat at this period. The nervous derangement may be so severe as to* 
result in insanity. The flashes consist of a feeling of heat over a part or the 
whole of the body, followed by sweating and the sensation of cold or a slight 
chill. They may occur frequently during the day and sometimes several 
times during an hour. They usually do not occur as often during the night. 

The treatment of the menopause should be directed toward the main- 
tenance of the general health of the body and mind. The diet should be 
carefully regulated. Too much rich food should be forbidden. The bowels 
should be kept open and regular. The woman should have plenty of fresh 
air and the proper amount of exercise. The first dilution of Gelsemium in 
small doses is good for the nervous disturbances. Put 10 drops in a glass 
half full of water and take two teaspoonfuls every 2 to 4 hours. The sixth 
trituration of Sepia is also good at this time. Take one tablet every 3 hours. 
The above are Homeopathic medicines. Quieting and soothing medicines 
like bromide of potash may be used to produce rest and sleep. You can 
use the elixir brortlide of potash, taking from 2 to 4 tablespoonfuls a day. Give 
a tonic like nux vomica in from 1 to 5-drop doses 4 times a day. Or, gentian 
compound may be taken in teaspoonful doses 4 times a day.

403 THE PEOPLE'S HOME MEDICAL BOOK. 

Mental depression and nervousness demand a change of locality and 
surroundings. Above all they demand cheerful, pleasant and sensible com- 
pany and a good, honest, practical physician. Constant talk, advice and en- 
couragement do much good at this time. A practical physician can carry 
many women, who would otherwise become insane, safely through this 
period by proper encouragement and treatment. 

A woman at this time should sleep well and have a good healthy appe- 
tite and eat proper food. If necessary the bowels should be kept open with 
mild laxatives such as salts, etc. Baths should be taken frequently. Be out 
of doors as much as possible. Have good cheerful company. Many women 
during the " change of life " have very little trouble ; others need to be under 
the care of the family doctor. Go to him when you feel bad and he can 
frequently aid you without giving any medicine. Others have passed through 
this time safely and so will you if you do not worry. Keep control of your- 
self and hope for the best and that will aid you wonderfully. Make light 
of your worries at this time and they will decrease. If you have any real 
disease go to your doctor and tell him plainly all about it. Remember that 
you will get better even though slowly. 



ALL ABOUT THE MOTHER AND HER BABY. 



NURSING AND FEEDING. 

Why Should a Mother Nurse Her Baby? 

Because it is the law of nature and nature has -provided for it. The 
■mother's milk is the only ideal health food. Babies that are nursed resist 
disease better and are healthier in every respect. Nursing will also be an 
aid to the mother; it will reduce the womb to normal size, keep it so and 
render her less liable to pelvic congestion and diseases of the womb. 
Should a Nursing Mother Drink Tea or Coffee? 

Not as a rule; if she does it should be in moderation. Tea and cofifee 
are constipating and also very likely to make the mother nervous. The 
mother should remember that anything that injures her will injure her baby. 
Cross, colicky, restless, sleepless children generally have mothers whose di- 
gestion is poor, whose bowels do not act properly and who are nervous and 
restless themselves. 
Are there Any Diseases that Prohibit the Mother's Nursing? 

Yes ; cancer, inflammatory rheumatism, scarlet fever, puerperal (child- 
bed) fever, typhoid fever. Also any disease which causes a serious infection 
of the blood prohibits nursing. 
Does Nursing Necessarily Drain a Mother's System? 

Not if she is reasonably well and her surroundings are favorable. 
Should a Nursing Mother Eat Fruit and Vegetables? 

She may eat freely of such articles as do not disturb her digestion. Even 
this rule has its exceptions. Some infants have very feeble digestive powers 
and a healthy mother must be very careful with such babies. Mothers whose 
babies are cross and colicky should avoid everything that is raw and sour and 
large quantities of cold drinks. This includes sour fruits, raw or cooked ; 
also pickles, tomatoes and cabbage. Mothers will also find that free indul- 
gence in animal foods, as meat, milk and eggs, is likely to make an infant 
colicky. 
How Soon After " Labor " Should the Baby be Put to the Breast? 

It depends upon the condition of the mother and the child. If the 
mother has had a hard labor she should have a good rest, especially if she 
is exhausted. She should nurse it as soon as possible for nursing aids in 
contracting and keeping the womb contracted, lessens danger of bleeding 
from the womb and promotes the secretion of milk. If the baby sleeps well 
and only awakens when the diaper is changed and then falls asleep again it 
is not necessary for it to nurse. If, however, the baby cries, is uneasy and 
refuses to be quieted, we may, six hours after delivery, put it to the breast. 
If anything is needed before six hours, give the baby a little weak, warm, 
sugar water. 
What Secretion First Appears in the Breast and What is Its Use? 

Colostrum. It tends to regulate the bowels and puts the stomach in 
order for the digestion of the mother's milk. i 

How Soon Do the Breasts Secrete Good Milk? 

Usually on the third day good milk fills the breasts. 



404 THE PEOPLE'S HOME MEDICAL BOOK. 

If there is then no Milk Secreted What Should be Done? 

If the baby is fretful and cross give it some cream; one part cream and 
five parts warm water. 
If "there is Little or no Milk After Waiting a Few Days What Should Be 

Done? 

If there is some milk the baby should nurse and if the food agrees with 
the baby supply the deficiency by artificial feeding until the mother has 
enough milk and of proper quality. If the child is well nursed it will sleep 
well and its stools, one or two a day, will be of light yellow color and odor- 
less. 
What Should YoU Feed if a Mother Canriot Nurse a New-Born Babe? 

Four to five teaspoonfuls of weak ^Ugat water every six to eight hours, 
with a teaspoonful of very thick cream ; same on third day every one and 
one-half to two hours unless mother is then able to tiurse. 
Suppdsitig that This Kiild of Feeding is Insufficient, What Must^ be Done? 

A " wet nurse " trlust be procured, of baby must be hand fed. 
Are there Reasons for the Baby's Being Unable to Nurse, Even When the 

Mother has Plenty bf Milk? 

Yes; poorly developed nipples, nipples so retracted that the baby can-' 
not nurse. Such nipples must be " drawn upon " until they stand out 'prop- 
erly. The treatment should begin during the last four months of pregnancy. 
Suppose the Nipples are so Sore that Nursing is Very Painful? 

After each nursing wash the nipples clean with alcohol, one part and 
water, four parts. Dry them thoroughly^ then apply solution of tincture 
benzoin compound with camel's-hair pencil. You need not wash this off 
before next nui-sihg as it will not hurt the child. Or, use one teaspoonful 
of boric acid to a cup of warm water. Bathe nipples very gently after each 
nursing. After they have been washed with boric acid solution apply the 
following ointment. 

Bismuth Nipple Ointment. — Subgallate of bismuth, 1 drani (teaspoon- 
ful) ; betizodted lard, i ounce. Mix and apply to sore nipples after each nurs- 
ing. This is good and not injurious to the baby. Also good for baby's sore 
mouth. The following is very ^ood — glycerine or tannin, 1 fluid ounce ; 
boiled 'watef, iy^ ounces. This is to be painted on nipples after using the 
boric acid solution mentioned above. Sore nipples should not be used so 
frequently — partly feed the infant. Do not let the infant nurse too long. 
Mow May Sore Nipples Be Prevented? 

' Use nipple protectors or shield, and during the last few months of 
pregliancy rub and massage the skin thoroughly over the nipples. When 
they are not in a wet condition, apply mother's own saliva or cow's milk so 
that the nipples are moist and then massage and rub them thoroughly. 
What Can You do for Nipples that Crack or Discharge Pus ? 

For cracked nipples use tincture benzoin compound as for sore nipples, 
or J'Ou may use boric acid solution or oxide of zinc ointment. (Should be 
washed off before nursing.) You may also use glass or hard rubber shield for 
a few days until the nipple gets well. This is very good. If pus is discharged 
from both nipples the baby must be weaned. 
What Can You do to Prevent a " Broken *' Breast? 

Keep the breasts thoroughly emptied, with a breast pump if necessary, 
and keep them well protected at all times from pressure and irritation from 
the clothing. If the breasts are so full they keep the clothing constantly 



ALL ABOUT THE MOTHER AND HER BABY. 405 

wet, use the breast pump. Such mothers ghoqjcj drinjf but jittle fluid ^nc} eat 
mainly solid foods, unless the child js injvjred by thp solid foods. This will 
be shown by the condition of its stools^QOse and of bad color apd odor. 
If the Mother has pot Enough IVIilk Should She Wean the Baby or Partly 

Nurse It? 

Partly nurse it and feed the baby. The mother's ipi}l< assists the 
stomach to digest the other foods, hut if the mother's milk tjiep prodtfces 
colic, and green mucus and slimy stopj^ follow nurging, the mother's milk 
is not of good quality and the nursing must be discontinued. Greep stools, 
when accompanied by mucug and sliliie, are usually indicfitive of the unsuit- 
able quality of food (milk) which causes colic and crossness, 
iitow Can You Increase the Supply of Milk? 

By regular habits, proper food, and proper amount of exercise and rest. 
Milk, if taken, should not be used too freely for it has a tendency to produce 
indigestion and biliousness in the mother, and the baby will then have colic 
with mucous and yellowish green stools. Weak tea or thin gruels, well boilad 
(with only enough cream or milk to make them palatable), are good when it 
is necessary to take drinks in large quantities. A gruel should be made so as 
to be only a drink, not a meal ; for if it is made richer than a drink it may 
cause indigestion and thus reduce the amount of milk secreted. Beer and 
extracts of malt are also used for thig purpose but are not equal to the 
gruels in furnishing a nourishing quality of milk. Plenty of outdoor exer- 
cise should be taken, but refrain from overwork, worry and excitement. 
Good cocoa is also beneficial. 
Should a Nursing Mother Use Any Alcoholic Liquors? 

This depends largely upon her previous habits. She should avoid spices, 
highly seasoned foods and everything which heats the blood or tends to dis- 
turb the stomach, liver, bowels and kidneys. Her diet should be plain, 
simple and strengthening. 
What Things in the Habits or Diet of a Mother are Likely to Cause Colic or 

Indigestion in the Baby? 

Shock, fright, fatigue, worry, grief, passion and sudden anger are very 
common causes ; also the food previously mentioned. 
Is there any Benefit Derived from Chpcplate or Cocoa? 

Yes. It is a great milk maker; it increases the quantity and improves 
the quality. 
How Can You Tell When a Baby is Well Nourished? 

When the weight constantly increases ; when the baby has a good color 
and sleeps well after each nursing; yvhen awake, is not fretful and peevish 
and when it -has one or two yellowish stools (Jaily- 
What Symptoms Show that a Baby is Poorly l^qqrishe^? 

Such a baby is crpss, fretful, peevish, irritable and restless ; has irregular 
sleep; sleep is broken up in short naps; nurses often and long or nursps 
breast a short time then relinquishes it and cries; has cojic _^nd its gtfipls 
contain undigested particles; its weight either remains stationary or de- 
creases. 
Does a Healthy Baby Ever Vpipit After JJursing? 

Yes. It is generally dne to overfeeding or to milk tjiat is too rjplj. If 
the milk vomited is sweet and is not curdled and the child remains welj, the 
vomiting is harmless. 



406 THE PEOPLE'S HOME MEDICAL BOOK. 

How Long at a Time Should a Mother Nurse Her Baby? 

. Usually from five to fifteen minutes. If a healthy baby nurses longer 
it is generally due to a deficiency in the milk secretion. 
How Often is it Necessary for the Baby to Nurse the First Few Days After 

Birth? 

Four or five times daily. 
How Often Should The Baby Nurse During the Succeeding Months? 

Every hour and a half to two hours during the first month and twice at 
night — nine p. m. and two a. m. ; every two hours during the second and 
third, months ; then the time can be extended to three and one-half hours. 
What Should Be Done if Baby Wants to Nurse Oftener? 

Give it distilled or boiled water as warm as the milk. 
When Should You Stop Night Feeding? 

If a baby is healthy and growing and sleeps well, you can begin at from 
the sixth to the ninth month. 
What Can You Do for a Hard, Inflamed or Caked Breast? 

Relieve it with a breast pump. This may prevent caking, but if caking 
does occur the breasts should be rubbed and massaged three times daily for 
five or ten minutes after the hands have been thoroughly washed and 
anointed with some sterilized oil. The breast is grasped in the palms of both 
hands, one above and one beneath, and the breast then subjected to firm 
pressure with a worm-like motion. A suspensory bandage folded bias re- 
lieves the pain. Take a soft towel or large handkerchief, fold it bias, pass . 
it underneath the arm and tie it behind the neck. 

Applications. — (See Women's Department.) 

1. Cloths wrung dry out of hot water and applied hot on the breast is a 
good treatment in some cases. 

2. Cloths saturated with a tea made from poke root is a good remedy. 
Put this on the sore breast continuously. 

3. A poultice made from poke root is excellent, or a poultice of fluid 
extract of poke root. The fluid extract can be bought very cheaply. Use 
half poke root and half water. Wring cloths out of it and apply warm. 

4. Fluid extract of poke root may be used internally. Put one teaspoon- 
ful of the fluid extract into a glass one-half full of water. Give two teaspoon- 
fuls every one to three hours regularly. It will not hurt the baby in this 
dose. 

Homeopathic Treatment. — 1. Belladonna, 2nd dilution. Put ten drops 
into half a glass of water and give one to two teaspoonfuls every one to three 
hours. This is very good when the breast is very red and throbs and beats. 

2. Bryonia, 2nd dilution. Same dose and given in same way as Bella- 
donna. This is good, especially after Belladonna, when there is much severe 
aching all over and it hurts to move. 

Allopathic Treatment. — Keep the bowels open with epsom salts, 1 table' 
spoonful in half a glass of water taken in the morning. Ointment of oxide of 
zinc is very good for sore and cracked nipples. It must be washed oflf before 
nursing. 
Should You Give the Nipples any Attention if they are not Sore? 

They should be kept clean and dry. Immediately after nursing, dry 
the nipples with a soft cloth and rub olive oil over them. Continue for a 
week or two. 



ALL ABOUT THE MOTHER AND HER BABY. 407 

Should a Baby Nurse from a Breast that is " Broken " or Contains Pus? 

No; for it may contract a very dangerous diarrhea. 
If a Mother can only Partly Nurse the Baby, What Other Food May be Used? 

Fresh cow's milk or some one of the many good baby foods. The method 
of preparing cow's milk is described later. 
When Should You Begin to Wean the Baby? 

Weaning should be begun gradually when baby is eight months old, 
unless weather conditions (summer) or circumstances, such as teething, make 
it advisable to postpone or hasten it. 
Do You Advise Sudden or Gradual Weaning? 

Gradual, unless conditions and circumstances demand sudden weaning. 
What Conditions or Circumstances Demand Sudden Weaning? 

1. When the mother is in poor health and needs constant and con- 
tinuous medical treatment and this treatment seriously impairs the baby's 
digestion, then it may be necessary to wean the baby suddenly. 

2. When both breasts contain pus (matter). 

3. When the stools (contents discharged from the bowels) are always 
green, foul and strong, and are not changed by nursing in four or five days. 
What Diseases Make Sudden Weaning Necessary? 

Puerperal fever, scarlet fever, typhoid fever, pneumonia, pyemia, sep- 
ticemia. 
Should a Mother Nurse Her Baby if Her " Monthlies" Return? 

Yes, unless the nursing disagrees with her baby. This is shown by the 
stomach and bowels of the child becoming disordered. 
Can You Give Crackers, Bread, Butter, Etc., to Weaned Babies? 

Crackers very thoroughly baked, almost charred, and stale bread may be 
given to weaned babies but bread should be stale and with no butter, as 
butter is very likely to upset the stomach. None of these should be given 
to babies under nine months to a year old. 
What Causes Sore Mouth in the Nursing Mother? 

A too restricted diet, lack of exercise and fresh air. 
What Should be Done for Such a Condition? 

If the baby is not nourished it must be weaned. The mother should 
drink freely of acid drinks, such as lemonade, lime juice, etc., and should eat 
freely of vegetables and seasonable fruits. Baked apples, prunes and other 
dried and preserved fruits may be eaten if fresh fruit cannot be procured. 
Wash the mouth frequently with boric acid, 10 grains dissolved in 1 ounce 
of water, or tincture of hydrastis (golden seal) diluted one-half with water. 

Internally — Homeopathic Treatment — Mercurius Sol., 3rd trituration. 
Give one tablet every 3 hours. Keep bowels open if necessary with salts. 
What is the Best Food for the Baby if the Mother Cannot Nurse It? 

Cow's milk modified to resemble human milk as much as possible. 
How Does Cow's Milk Differ from Human Milk? 

Cow's milk contains almost three times as much curd and about one- 
half as much sugar. The curd is not easily digested. 
What Ingredients Compose the Human Milk? 

Out of 100 parts there are 871/2 parts of water and 121/2 parts of food. 
The 12% parts of food are made up of fat, 4 parts ; sugar, ? parts and proteids 
casein and albumin, 1% parts. 



408 THE PEOPLE G HOME MEDICAL BOOK. 

What do You Call the Fat and Proteids in Milk? 

The fat is the cream. The proteids are the cufd which is very similar 
to albumen (or white of egg). They make muscle. 
What is the Top Milk? 

The upper third or half of milk that has stood six or eight hours, which 
then contains three times as much cream as ordinary milk. 
How Can Yoti Obtain the Top Milk? 

Take it off with a spoon or siphonj 
How is it Usually Treated or Diluted to Make Babies' Milk? 

Take 1 part of top milk and add 2 parts of warm water; then add 1 heap- 
ing teaspoonful of milk sugar to 4 ounces of this mixture or diluted food. 
If cane sugar be used, one teaspoonful is enough for six ounces of the mixture. 

Following is a very good combination ; 2 tablespoonfuls granulated sugar, 
% cup boiling water, 1 tablespoonful lime water, 1 cup (% pint) cream, V/^ 
cup of milk. Steam 20 minutes. This recipe comes from Dr. Hinsdale, df 
the University of Michigan, and is very good. Increase or decrease the 
amount of sugar, cream and milk according to the way they agree with the 
child. 
Should You Boil the Milk for Babies in the Summer? 

No. It makes it hard to digest. Curd and albumin (white of an egg) 
are identical. You would not boil the white of an egg and give it to the baby. 
When is Milk Said to be Pasteurized? 

When it is heated to a temperature of 154° to 170° (Fahrenheit) and 
retained at that point from twenty to thirty minutes. 
How do You Pasteurize Milk? 

Place milk in a bottle (fruit jar will do), cover the top with absorbent 
cotton and set it in a tin pail of cold water deep enough to surround the 
milk. This water should be boiled for 30 minutes. A plate or dish must be 
put Underneath the bottle to prevent breaking. 
Should the Milk Always be Pasteurized? 

Always in the summer. Better at all times in the cities. Cfeam does 
not rise from pasteurized milk so the cream should be taken off before the 
milk is pasteurized. The cream should also be pasteurized. 
Is Partially Boiled Milk Harder to Digest? 

Very little and this is more than counter-balanced by killing of the germs. 
How Can You Sterilize Milk? 

By bringing it to the boiling point (213 degrees Fahr.) and keeping it 
there for 20 to 30 minutes. 
Which is Preferable, Pasteurized or Sterilized Milk? 

Pasteurised is easier to digest on account of stetilized milk being boiled, 
and it is pleasinter to the taste, but it will not keep as long as sterilized milk. 
It keeps fot only one or two days. Sterilized milk keeps longer. 
What is a Simple Way of Sterilizing Milk? 

Same way as the one described for pasteurizing; keep up the process 
only long enough to make the milk boil, which is shown by the bubbles 
coming to the surface. 
When and Why Should Lime Water be Used in Milk? 

The use of lime water neutralizes the excessive acidity (overcomes the 
sourness) of the milk both before and after it is taken into the stomach. If 
the baby's stomach is sour, lime water corrects this. Add one to three tea- 



ALL ABOUT THE MOTHER AND HER BABY. 409 

spoonfuls of lime water to each feeding. Usually, give 1 ounce or part of 
lime water to twenty ounces or parts of food. 
How Do You Make Lime Water? 

By mixing building lime and boiled water together. It does not matter 
about the amount of lime for only so much will dissolve in the water and it 
cannot become too strong. Water can be poured off after standing three or 
four days and more water added to the lime. Lime water is very cheap 
and it can be procured fresh at any drug store as needed- The following 
is another way to prepare lime water. 

Take one heaping teaspoonful of slaked lime and one quart of boiled or 
di.stilled water; place in a corked bottle and shake thoroughly two or three 
times during the first hour. Allow the lime to settle and after 24 hours the 
upper, clear fluid may be carefully poured or siphoned off for use. 
Is there Anything We can Use in Place of Lime Water for the Same Trouble? 

Yes ; common baking soda. Two to four grains of this may be added 
to each bottle of food or 20 grains to 20 ounces of food. Twenty grains is 
equal to % of a small teaspoonful. 
When is the Soda and Lime to be Added to the Milk? 

Soda may be added at any time to the milk. Lime water must only be 
added after the milk has been heated. 
Peptonized Milk— What is It? 

Milk which has been pastiiilj or completely digested, so far as the 
casein is concerned, by the addition of a digestive ferment. You can buy 
these digestive tablets at the drug store. Dr. Douglas of Detroit gives the 
following good formula : 

Pajicreatin '. , . . . 1 drachm. 

Salicylate of soda , 5 grains. 

Bicarbonate of soda 80 grains. 

Simple syrup ■ • r • 4 ounces. 

Ten to twelve drops of this solution will peptonize an ounce of milk and 
enough of it should be put into each bottle before warming the food to pep- 
tonize or predigest the amount of milk which each meal contains. More of 
the mixtufe may be used if this amount does not predigest the milk. When 
a pancreatin mixture as above given smells very strong and disagreeable it 
shows there is some decomposition in it and some other pancreatin should he 
used. 
Is Peptonized Mijk a Oood Milk to Use? 

In some cases of acute indigestion when the stomach is very weak and 
there is no pepgin secreted. 
Would You Advise the Use of Only One Cow's Milk? 

Yes; if you are sure the cow is healthy; otherwise, it is better to use 
milk from the whole herd. 
Do You Prefer Milk from Either a Jersey or Alderney Cow? 

The milk from these cows is very rich in cream but deficient in casein. 
The Holstein and Aryshire and common grade cows are usually vigorous, 
healthy and strong and secrete a milk better suited to infant feeding. 
Should Milk Be Diluted During Whole Babyhood? 

Yes, but reduce the amount of water after the fourth month, since the 
food should be made stronger after the baby is three or four months old. 
How Should Cow's Milk Be Diluted at First? 

The upper third or half of milk that has stood for six or eight hours should 



4:10 THE PEOPLE'S HOME MEDICAL BOOK. , 

be taken off. Add to this twice as much boiled water and then add one 
heaping teaspoonful of good milk sugar (Sugar of Milk is the same thing) 
to every four ounces of the above food; or, if cane sugar is used, add one 
teaspoonful to every six ounces of food. If this is too rich you can add 
more water. 
How Can I Tell if the Milk I Buy is of Good Quality? 

The specific gravity of milk is 1039. Its reaction is slightly acid. To 
determine the specific gravity, get a lactometer from a druggist, fill a 
beaker so that it will float the lactometer and read the figures on the scale. 
If it is above or below 1029 it is watered or reinforced by some foreign ele- 
ment. For acidity (sourness), secure from your druggist, for a few cents, 
some blue litmus paper. Put a small piece in the milk and if there is too much 
acidity it will change to red. 
Ho^ Can I Determine If the Cream is of the Right Amount? 

Take a long thin bottle and paste a narrow strip of paper on the out- 
side. Mark the paper into sixteen equal parts before you paste it on the 
bottle. The lower edge of the paper should come just to the bottom of the 
bottle, while the milk should come to the top of the paper. Set the bottle 
filled with milk aside for twelve to twenty-four hours. The layer of cream 
rises to the top and should be one-sixteenth of the whole amoLint. If there 
is less than one-sixteenth of cream the milk is either very poor or has been 
skimmed. 
What is Condensed Milk? 

Condensed Milk is milk from which the greater part of the water has been 
evaporated. It is valuable when you cannot obtain pure cow's milk and when 
you have little ice to keep cow's milk fresh. 
What Kind of Bottles Should be Used for Giving Artificial Foods? 

A straight cylindrical bottle holding eight ounces, on which are figures 
dividing it into ounces and half ounces. You should have two or more bottles 
for emergencies. See that the marking is correct so as to be sure the baby 
receives the proper amount of food. All bottles should be rinsed immediately 
after being used. Black rubber nipples should be procured as all rubber is 
naturally of that color. The nipples should be scrubbed and cleaned thor- 
oughly and kept in a soda or boric acid water till used again. Rinse them 
thoroughly before using again. This care prevents much trouble in the way 
of sickness. 
Summary of Feeding Rules for Children. — - 

' 1. Avoid night feeding after the first six months. It causes wakeful 
habits and a cross, irritable and unsuccessful child. 

2. Hot weather always requires pasteurized or sterilized foods, smaller 
meals, and lime water in or with the food. A reduced milk diet and lime 
water are essential in summer. 
Is Vomiting in Nursing Infants a Bad Sign? 

The child that vomits much and is healthy merely casts out the super- 
abundance of mother's milk swallowed. ^This is very different from vomit- 
ing accompanied with coldness of the skin and cold sweating and sick stomach. 
What are the Causes of Vomiting? 

Unhealthy food and diseases — scarlet fever and meningitis. 
How Does Unhealthy Food Affect a Baby and What May be Done For It? 

Babies suffering in this "way are cross, pale and restless, very often 
having green, slimy and foul stools. 



ALL ABOUT THE MOTHER AND HER BABY. 411 

Treatment.— ^Regulate diet when that is at fault. Temporary relief may ' 
be obtained by a dose of castor oil or by giving the following to move the 
bowels : 

Laxative Alkaline Mixture. — (For child one year old.) 

Bicarbonate of soda 40 grains. 

Aromatic syrup of rhubarb 4 fluid drams. 

Syrup of senna 5 fluid drams. 

Syrup of orange 1 fluid dram. 

Give one teaspoonful two or three times a day as needed for sour 
stomach with constipation or foul smelling stools. Or, to strengthen stomach 
digestion give the following digestive assistant: 

Essence of pepsin 1 ounce. 

Essence of pancreatin 1 ounce. 

Give 10 to 20 drops after each meal for a child one year old. Increase 
the dose gradually if necessary. 
Do Green Stools Always Indicate Unsuitable Food? 

No: Many infants have imperfectly developed digestive glands when 
born and cannot properly digest even good human milk. 
What Food Usually Causes Green Stools in the Healthy Infant? 

Usually it is caused by too much of proteids (curd) in the mother's milk 
or too much skimmed milk in the diet of the hand-fed infant. 
What Foods Would You Give when Weaning is Demanded at Six or Seven. 

Days Old? 

A very light cream froin bottled milk 16 to 34 hours old, diluted with four 
times as much boiled water and sweetened with 1 ounce of good milk sugar 
or % ounce of granulated sugar to every 15 ounces of the mixture. One 
ounce of lime water may be added to every 7 ounces of this and 1 to 2 table- 
spoonfuls of this mixture fed to the infant every two hours or when it shows 
hunger. If the whole mixture is sterilized or pasteurized it may be fed with- 
out adding the lime water. 
Can the Infant Continue to Thrive on this Strength of Food? 

There must be the proper increase of one or more of the constituents 
of food (fat, sugar and proteids). If there is too much sugar it will cause 
gas, colic, loose splashy stools and a scalding redness in the bowel around the 
rectum, extending all around the hips, due to the fermentation of the sugar. 
Seven per cent, of sugar is about all an infant can stand. The usual strength 
of milk sugar required for infants over one month is 1 ounce to every 20 
ounces of food mixture. Increase 1 to 18 if necessary; or, if it causes irri- 
tation, change to cane or grape sugar; or, the milk sugar may be reduced to 
1 ounce to 25 or 30 ounces of food. Granulated sugar does not ferment as 
quickly in hot weather as milk sugar and about half the amount of gran- 
ulated sugar is needed. Milk sugar, however, should be preferred during the 
first 6 months if it agrees with tlie baby. 

Fat should form from 1 to 4 per cent, of the food. That is from 1 ounce 
to 3 or 4 ounces daily. The new born infant may consume two to four tea- 
spoonfuls of cream (fat) daily. The infant two months old may consume 
twenty-five teaspoonfuls daily, thus leaving about eighteen to twenty tea- 
spoonfuls of cream to be added to the infant's diet any time during the first 
eight weeks, or an average of 2i/^ teaspoonfuls added each week during the 
first two months. It may not be able to digest more than this amount any 



412 



tHE t>£OPLE'S HOME MEDICAL BOOK. 



month afterward. If too much fat is given the appetite of the baby lessens; 
it vomits an hour or more aftet meals; it Cries and has gas in the bowels; 
sleep is disturbed; or, the bowels are loose with foul-smelling, greasy Or 
rancid stools. 
How Much Can the Proteids (they are found in skimmed milk and some also 

in cream) Be Increased? 

Infants of one month may consume % ounce daily and the large healthy 
infant of 10 months about 25 ounces daily. The 24 (we take 24 for compari- 
son) ounces represent 192 teaspoonfuls (1 ounce equals 8 tcclspoonftils) and 
thus shows art increase of only about 4% teaspoonfuls weekly or % teaSpoon- 
ful daily of skimmed milk. This amount is for a large he&lthy infant. If too 
much skimmed milk (proteids) is given the infant becomes cross and colicky, 
sleeps poorly, wakens very often and cries out with pain. The stools become 
green, show much mucus and often curds; in some cases part of the stools 
will be formed, the rest. soft ahd splashy. In other caSes stools will be formed 
and well digested but carry a few curds also. 
What Does Skimmed Milk Contain? 

Four and one-half per cent, of stigar ahd 1/4% of fat in addition to the 
proteids. Hence by too great increase of skimmed milk yott get tod miich 
sugar and fat.

Feeding Rules for the Third to the Seventh Year. 

ARTICLES OF FOOD.— 

Milk. — This should be the basis of the diet; most children require about 
one quart a day. This usually needs no modification but if the curd is some- 
what difficult of digestion, as shown by changed character of stools and colic, 
it may be prepared by adding to 6 ounces of milk 1 ounce of cream and 3 
ounces of water. The milk to be given warm. 

Cream. — This is of great value, especially when there is a tendency to 
constipation. From 3 to 4 ounces may be given daily, but it is essential that 
it be given fresh. It may be used upon cereals, upon potatoes, in broths, and 
mixed with milk. In many cases it is better to stop feeding milk and give only 
cream. 

Cream should be omitted if its use is followed by coating of the tongue, , 
foul breath, looseness of the bowels and other signs of indigestion. 

Eggs. — They should be fresh, soft boiled, poached or coddlexl, but never 
fried. Some children tire readily of eggs even though the manner of cooking 
is varied. Others will take an egg twice a day for an indefinite period with 
relish and benefit. 

Meats. — Some form of meat which has been properly cooked should be 
given once a day. The best forms are beefsteak, mutton chop, and roast beef 
or lamb ; next to these the white meat of chicken or fresh fish, which should 
be boiled or broiled ; fish may be used once a week instead of meat ; beef and 
mutton should be given rare. Do not give meat and eggs at the same meal. 

Vegetables. — Potatoes may be given once a day, preferably baked, with 
the addition of cream or beef juice, rather than butter. Of green vegetables, 
the best are asparagus tops, spinach, stewed celery, small carrots, string 
beans, fresh peas and squash ; young beets may be used, if thoroughly cooked. 
One of these vegetables may be given daily, always well cooked and mashed. 

Cereals. — Nearly all of these may be used : oatmeal, wheaten grits, hominy, 
farina and arrowroot. Thorough cooking is necessary. 

If grains are used the cereals must be cooked at least three hours, after 
having been previously soaked for several hours. If the prepared oats or 
wheat are used they should be cooked at least l^A hours ; the prepared flours 
at least 30 minutes. They should always be well salted and given with milk 
or cream, but with little or no sugar. 

Broths and Soups. — The meat soups or broths are preferable to the vege- 
table broths. Nearly all varieties may be given. Plain broths are very nutri- 
tious and when thickened with arrowroot or corn starch with cream or milk 
added they are very palatable, and at the same time are a valuable addition 
to the diet. Beef juice may be used as directed for the second year. 

Bread and Crackers. — In some forms these may be given with nearly 



ALL ABOUT THE MOTHER AND HER BABY. 415 

every meal, with very little butter until the third year. Cream is usually a 
better form of fat. AH varieties of bread may be allowed when stale; also, 
dried bread, zweibach, and oatmeal, graham or gluten crackers, or Huntley 
Palmer breakfast biscuits. 

Desserts. — The only ones that should be allowed up to the sixth year 
are junket, plain custard, rice pudding without raisins and, not oftener than 
once a week, ice cream. Of the last three the quantity should be very mod- 
erate. 

Fruits. — They are an important part of a child's diet and should be 
given in some form every day. Oranges, baked apples and stewed prunes 
are most to be depended upon. Raw apples in most cases should not be given. 
Peaches, pears and grapes (seeds removed) may be given when thoroughly 
ripe and fresh but only in moderate quantity. 

Special care should be exercised in the use of fruits in very hot weather 
and in cities where they may not always be fresh. 

Berries and cherries are best deferred until children are five or six years 
old, and .even then should be given sparingly. 

Beware of unripe or over-ripe bananas. 

Potatoes. — May be used during the second year but not during the first 
year. Never feed them to young infants during the summer season as they 
cause indigestion and diarrhea. They must be boiled or mashed and may be 
dressed with cream, gravy (not much) or beef juice and a little salt. 
FORBIDDEN ARTICLES.— 

Meats. — Pork, ham, sausage, dried and corn beef, salt fish, li.ver, bacon, 
kidney, meat dressings, duck and goose and also meat stews, are all difificult 
to digest. 

Bread and Cakes. — Avoid hot bread, rolls and biscuits, griddle cakes and 
much sweet cakes, particularly those with fruit or frosting. 

Vegetables. — Avoid potatoes in all forms during hot weather, and fried 
or scalloped at all seasons, cabbage, onions, cucumbers, tomatoes, be^ts, rad- 
ishes, green corn, baked beans and fried egg plant. 

Desserts. — Avoid candies, dried, canned and preserved fruits, nuts, pies, 
tarts, pastry, and much ice cream. 

Drinks. — Do not give wine, beer, cider, tea or coffee. 

Fruits.-^Avoid bananas, stale fruits and those out of season, all hard 
kinds, and those that are very sour. Avoid grapes unless the seeds and skins 
are removed. 

MAKING PREPARATION FOR THE BABY. 

Baby's Wardrobe. — This may be as extensive as the mother wishes and 
can afford. 

The belly band should be of soft, thin, white shaker flannel, five inches 
wide and sufficiently long to pass two or three times around the body. It is 
secured with strings, not with pins. 

The binder is discarded usually about the seventh month when the infant 
begins trying to stand. There is much difference of opinion about this. Some 
say the flannel band can be discarded when the baby is four months of agfe, 
others earlier. To prevent rupture, a bandage is used to hold navel and 
dressing in place imtil healing and separation have taken place. 

Clothing. — ^This, should consist of a chemise of wool next to the skin, and 
over this should be a loose garment, also of wool or flannel, reaching from the 



416 THE PEOPLE'S HOME MEDICAL BOOK. 

shoulders to below the feet and sufficiently long, say 26 inches, to allow it to be 
folded upward. Garments should not be tight across the chest. 

The chemise, which should be of gaute weight, is worn both winter and 
summer. Wool irritates sopie children. For these, place a fine linen chemise 
next to the skin and over this the gauze wool garment. No sleeves or opening 
in front for chemise. Woolen socks to reach to the knees. 

Diapersj— Lot of them ; 4 dozen of birdseye cotton. Needs to be just 
twice its width in length, say 18 inches wide and one yard in length. 

Per The First Half Year the Following is Recomtnended in Clothing. 

1. Diapers of birdseye cotton — a goodly number. 

2. An undershirt, of the softest flannel, without sleeves and dpening in 
front, as many as you may need, say three. 

3. A fine flannel prmcess dress about 37 inches loiig, opening in front, 
and with high neck and long sleeves. 

4. Muslin slips of similar style, many as you need, say six. 

5. Woolen socks to reach to the knees. 

Or the Following: 

Six dresses. , 

Six slips ; a little more simple than the dresses, to be worn altogether the 
first month or six weeks. 

Six white petticoats (Butterick pattern the best). 

Four flannel shirts. 

Four day skirts. 

Six muslin night dresses. 

Four flannel wrappers for night wear in cool or cold weather. 

Four or six pinning blankets. 

Four dozen diapers. 

A flannel apron for baby's bath, to be worn by the nursS or whoever bathes 
the baby. 

Four soft flannel bands, unhemmed, 5 by 25 inches^ and socks. Some 
mothers prefer the little cfddheted bootees. 

BATHING. 
At What Age May a Child be Given a Full Tub Bath? 

Usually when two weeks old. It should not be givert before the cord 
comes off. 
How and When Should the Bath be Given? 

It is generally considered best to give the bath in the morning and rot 
sooner than orte hour after feeding. The room should be warm; if possible 
there should be an open fire. The head and face should first be washed and 
dried; then the body should be soaped and the infant placed in the tub with 
the body well supported by the hattd of the nurse. Bath should -be given 
quickly, body dried (not tubbed) rapidly with a soft towel. 
At What Temperature Should the Bath be Given? 

For the first few weeks at 100 degrees; later, during early infancy, at 98 
degrees ; after six months at 95 degrees. During the second year from S5 
to 90 degrees. (Fahrenheit.) 



ALL ABOUT THE MOTHER AND HER BABY. 417 

What Do You Regard as the Best Soap for an Infant? 

There are many good ones. Do not use irritating soaps. (Ivory soap 
is good.) 
Is It Necessary to Use a Baby Powder After a Bath^ and If So, What is Best? 

Not necessary. Remove all moisture and if anything is needed, ordinary 
talcum powder or pulverized or sifted oatmeal will do. 
Would You Continue the Daily Bath with a Sick Baby? 

No ; only bathe enough to keep it clean. Baths in some kinds of sickness 
are injurious. 
Do You Give any Special Attention to the Scalp? 

It should be thoroughly wa:hed and dried. In infancy the sebaceous or 
oil glands are Very active and the head must be kept clean or a skin disease 
will develop. (Scald-head, milk crust, etc.) Dry the hair with a soft towel 
and brush with a fine hair brush. Do not use a comb. No preparation of 
any kind need be used on the head. 
If there is any Chafing Must You Modify the Bath? 

Instead of soap, one tablespoonful of powdered borax may be added to 
the bath if necessary. 

Apply the following if necessary : 

Boracic acid : . 1 dram or 1 teaspoonful. 

Glycerine 1 dram or 1 teaspoonful. 

Balsam Peru 1 dram or 1 teaspoonful. 

' Vaseline, white '. . 1 ounce. 

Mix, make into an ointment and apply to sore parts. 

CARE OF THE BABY. 
Oft Which Side Should a Baby Lie? 

On the right side mostly. The liver is a very large and heavy organ and 
will press upon the stomach and make, the baby uncomfortable if you place 
it on its left side. 
What are the Normal Respirations of an Infant? 

Immediately after birth, 44 per minute ; first to sixth month, 24 to 36 per 
minute; second to fifth year, 20 to 32 per minute; sixth to tenth year, 20 to 
28 per minute. 
What is the Normal Pulse Rate? 

At birth, 130 to 135 per minute. 

First year falls to 110. 

Second years falls to 100. 

Fifth to 8th year falls to 98. 

At puberty (15 years), 72. 
What is the Normal Temperature at Birth? 

99I/0 to 100 degrees Fahrenheit. 
Where Should Temperature Be Taken? 

In the rectum, thermometer half buried for three minutes. If taken in 
the armpit leave five minutes. 
What is Included in the " Period of Infancy? " 

This depends upon the authority ; some say from birth to the end of the 
first year ; others say until all the first teeth come. 
What is Included in the " Period of Childhood? " 

From completion of first teething to ten, twelve or fifteen years, differing 
According to authors.

418 THE PEOPLE'S PIOME MEDICAL BOOK. 

How Many Hours a Day Should a Baby Sleep? 

It should sleep most of the time. 
Do You Approve of Rocking or Walking With the Baby to Make It Sleep? 

Keep it as quiet as possible. Take it in your arms if it is restless and 
sing it to sleep. Keep it from excitement. Do not let anyone awaken it out 
of a good natural sleep simply to see it. Causes a bad habit. Remember the 
line from Pope — " Just as the twig is bent the tree is inclined." 
Suppose the Baby Will not Sleep? 

Regular habits in feeding both in mother and child and good healthy 
stomach and bowels in both will aid and correct anything that is not very 
much wrong. 
Are there any Causes Other than Sickness that Will Make a Baby Restless and 

Sleepless? 

Teething causes nervousness and it is very likely to have indigestion, 
poor nutrition and brain excitement, which will cause sleeplessness. Hunger, 
due to insufficiei:': and poor quality of food, irregularity i^ feeding or nursing, 
irregular habits and improper diet in mother may cause sleeplessness. Re- 
member sleeplessness is frequently due to worms. 

Should Either Quieting Medicines or Soothing Syrup Ever be Used? 

When you have done everything and the baby does not sleep, some quiet- 
ing medicine must be given for the child will be more injured by the crying 
and loss of sleep than by the quieting medicine. 

Do not use soothing syrups for so many of them have morphine or opium 
in them and they are dangerous for a child. Paregoric will do, 1 to 3 to 5 
drops for pain and sleeplessness, given every hour, if needed, until the child 
is quiet. 

If the child takes too much of a quieting medicine it must be kept awake 
and be given strong coffee and an enema (injection) to move the bowels freely. 

Mothers must remember that even a few drops of paregoric have caused 
death, and paregoric must be handled carefully. 

Do not forget the soothing influence of soft lullabies. How many chil- 
dren have been lulled to sleep by the old nursery rhyme — " Hush-a-bye- 
Baby ! " 

The best plan is to begin at first and give the baby its meals at regulat 
hours and only nurse or feed twice at night, say at 9 and 1 to 3 a. m. You 
will form a h^bit and the baby will soon be satisfied and generally sleep well. 

When a child is wakeful and restless, lay it first on its right side; then, 
in an hour, or whenever it appears uneasy, turn it upon its left side. Some- 
times lying on one side too long makes a child restless and a change of posi- 
tion rests it. 
What are Some of the General Signs of Sickness in a Baby? 

Unusual paleness or a general flushed face, dull looking eyes, no desire to 
eat or to play, listlessness, disturbed sleep, uncommon wakefulness, sudden 
starting or jumping while asleep with apparent fright, unusual drowsiness, 
vomiting accompanied by paleness or paleness alternating with a flush of 
redness more or less deep, hands and feet hotter, unusual and persistent cold- 
ness of the feet, unaccustomed fretfulness, frequent or prolonged fits of cry- 
ing or a marked change in the character of the cry, frequent or constant 
vvrinkling of the brow, twitching of the muscles of the face, rejection of food, 
unusual movements of the head and limbs, crying or moaning whenever the 
body is moved and a material rise of temperature all indicate illness in the 
baby. 



ALL ABOUT THE MOTHER AND HER BABY. 419 

What Should be Done if a Child Shows the First Symptoms of a Serious Ill- 
ness? 

Put tlfe child to bed. If it is an infant, the food should be diluted one- 
half the usual strength. If an older child, only fluid food should*be given. If 
the child seems feverish take the temperature. If the bowels are constipated 
give a teaspoonful of castor oil. Better exclude other children from the room, 
especially if it has been exposed to a contagious disease, or if there are con- 
tagious diseases in the neighborhood. 

The diapers of sick children, as well as of healthy ones, should be 
changed as soon as wet and washed soon. The child must have clean clothes 
or it will become sore and chafed. 
Does a Baby Sweat About the Head? 

Not generally. 
What Does Sweating About the Head Indicate? 

It indicates weakness and is one of the first signs of rickets. 
What Cry Indicates Sickness? 

Too long or too frequent crying, a moaning or fretful cry and often- 
times a whine and feeble, worrying cry indicate sickness. Temper cry is 
boisterous. 
What Cry Indicates Pain? 

A pain cry is a strong, sharp, sudden cry and is accompanied by con- 
traction of the features and drawing up of the limbs. 
What Does Frequent Jerking and Twitching of the Muscles Mean? 

Irritation somewhere and is common in indigestion, diarrhea and in 
brain troubles ; it also frequently indicates convulsions. 
What Does it Mean When it Hurts a Child to Be Handled? 

Rheumatism or acute rickets. With pleurisy the child cries when the 
chest is pressed upon. It may also mean inflammation of some organ in the 
abdomen (belly). 
What Indicates Chronic Illness? 

Loss of weight accompanied by other disturbances. 
Sleeping With Eyes Half Open Means What? 

Simple colic or pain anywhere causing unsound sleep. It is also a 
common symptom in all serious acute and chronic diseases. 
Hov/ Much Does the Stomach of a New-Born Infant Hold? 

Six to seven teaspoonfuls. 
What Causes a Child to Cry When It Passes Urine (watej-) ? 

Inflammation of the urethra or a too acid urine. Animal foods form an 
excess of urea in the blood which the kidneys cannot eliminate. Then uric 
acid crystals form, causing pain in passing urine. Meat diet should be les- 
sened and farinaceous (starchy) foods substituted, not entirely, but mostly. 
Fortunately, such a condition rarely occurs in a baby under two years of age 
but is most often found in older children who have been living on some form 
of meat juice or beef tea. 
What Causes Bleeding From the Navel? 

Cord improperly tied or blood vessels were very large. Remdve clothing 
and dressing and re-tie carefully near the body with strong linen thread. 
How Can I Tell if the Baby is Tongue-Tied? 

Bridle beneath the tongue is too short, or is attached so near the tip of 
the tongue as to interfere with its motion in sucking. If baby can protrude 



iSO THE PEOPLE'S HOME MEDICAL BOOK. 

the tongue beyond the lips or if it can draw on the nipple enough to nurse, 

you need have no fear of a tongue tie. 

What; Can he Done if the Baby is Tongue-Tied ? 

The bridie may be nicked with a pair of blunt scissors. There is an artery 
here so a doctor must do it. 

"DONT'S" FOR THE BABY, 

Don't let the baby have milk in the bottle to suck all night. Its presence 
an its mputh keeps the baby half awake and it will not rest well and will 
awaken Often. 

Don't give it an empty bottle to suck at any time for it will not only 
keep it y\rakeful, but the baby will suck air and get wind colic. 

Don't take the baby out evenings and break up its regular habit. It will 
make the baby restless and wakeful. 

Don't keep it up when callers are present evenings and disarrange its 
habit of going to sleep at its regular time. 

Don't give it a " comfort " at night. Do not commence the habit as 
it ma,y tend to keep the baby from sleeping soundly. If it awakens often at 
night give it warm water instead of milk. 

Don't rub or massage the baby at night as it will tend to cause more 
blood to circulate in the brain. Massage or rub the feet gently if you wish; 
algo the spinal column gently. 

CHILDREN'S. DISEASES. 



SORE EYES. 

What Causes Sore Eyes in a New-Born Babe? 

Error in management after birth. The secretions from mothers some- 
times cause it. Too much light. Careless use of towels. Dust. It is called 
" ophthalmia neonatorium " and js very dangerous to the sight. Over 70fo of 
all babies going blind during the first year become blind from this disease, and 
for this reason a doctor should be called at once. It is frequently caused 
by gonorrhea in the mother. 
What Should Be Dgne for Sore Eyes? 

Cleanse the eyes with a soft piece of linen, hold the baby on your lap 
with head bent backward and light toward the diseased eye. Gently separate 
the lids and clean them with a solution of boric acid, % °^ ^n ^^en teaspoon- 
ful to a pint of warm water. Use a soft cloth or a little absorbent cotton. If 
there is much inflammation and pus, you must get a doctor. In the 
meantime, wash the pus (matter) away with a solution of boric acid, 10 
grains to 8 teaspoonfuls of water. If the lids stick together a little vaseline 
from a tube should be rubbed upon them at night. If the trouble is slight 
this will cure it. Also exclude light from the room — live in a dark rooni. 

Be careful of the discharge. Do not get it into your eyes or you will 
contract the. disease. Never use the same towels or qloths for yourself. 
Further Treatment. — 

Aconite — third dilution. Put 15 drops into Vg cup of water and give two 
teaspoonfuls every 1 to 3 hours. 

Mercurius SqI, 3d tritwration—l tablet every three hourg when there is 
much matter. 



ALL ABOUt THE MOTHER AND rfER BABY. 431 

(Local) Silver nitrate, 3 to 5 grains; water, 1 ounce. Turn lids down 
and apply gently with a camel's-haif pencil after eyes are cleaned. 

To dilate pupil, use atropine, 1 grain and water, 1 ounce. Drop a few 
drops into eye to make pupil dilate so there will be ng adhesion. Must be care- 
fully used or you will set up atropine poisoning. 

EARACHE. 
How May I Know When the Baby has Earache and What Can be Done for it? 

Very comihon in babies. Symptoms— 'Child cries suddenly and violently 
and continues persistently to cry in loud, sharp scream-cries. Puts hand to 
the affected member and cries when the ear is touched. Turns the head with 
the sore eat down. When very young it is restless, moans constantly and 
refuses to be comforted ; cries almost every moment. The inconsolable infant 
should be at once suspected of having earache. 

Treatment. — Irrigate ear with a solution of boric acid. Use 20 grains 
boric acid to 1 ounce of water. Twenty grains is % teaspoonful and 1 ounce 
is equal to 8 teaspoonfuls. Use as hot as can be borne. 

Apply dry heat. First cover the ear with cotton then with a bandage ; 
bind on a small hot water bag or a bag filled with hot salt or bran. 

When the pain cannot be controlled by heat externally, give internally 
from one-fourth to one drop of laudanum (1 drop for a one-year-old baby)_. 
You can put it in water in order to get the right proportion. For instance, 
put 1 drop into 4 teaspoonfuls of water and give one teaspoonful ; that makes 
1^ of a drop at a dose. I would not give laudanum more than twice with an, 
interval of % hour after first dose. Laudanum dropped on cotton and placed 
in the ear is good. The application of steamed hops is also good. Paregoric 
may be given every hour for 3 or 4 doses, but some children cannot take it at 
all. Apply, if necessary, a hot onion poultice. 

Earache often terminates in a discharge which generally stops after a 
week or two. If it does not cease, pour into the ear and empty out after 15 
minutes the following: 

Sulphate of zinc 20 grains. 

Carbolic acid • 10 drops. 

Tincture iodine % dram (% teaspoonful). 

Glycerine 3 ounces. 

Mix thoroughly, and fill ear each day while child lies down and after 15 
minutes let it run out (always syringing' out the eat first with warm water). 
Keep this lotion warm. Thin it with water if it is too thick. 
Homeopathic Remedies. — 

Pulsatilla, 3rd trituration. — 1 tablet every ^^ hour to hour until better ; for 
pain, neuralgic in character, intermittent, no fever. 

Mercurius, 3d trituration. — 1 tablet every hour when suppuration (pus) 
is impending or has already begun. 

Belladonna, 3rd dilution. — Put 15 drops into a glass % full of water and 
give two teaspoonfuls every % to 3 hours for beating, throbbing arteries, very 
red face, fever. 

Aconite, 2nd dilution. — Prepare same way and give same dose for ear- 
ache caused by cold. 

Mullein oil dropped into ear or cotton saturated and put into ear. Keep 
bowels open. 



423 THE PEOPLE'S HOME MEDICAL BOOK. 

HEADACHE. 

What are the Symptoms of Headache and What Can be Done for it? 

A hot, restless, wakeful baby tells by its wrinkled brow, rolling head, 
avoidance of light, moaning, and general heavy appearance that it has head- 
ache. Many of these cases are not recognized and the fever and pain pass on 
to brain trouble. 

Causes. — Fever, cold, hot sun, indigestion, constipation, weakness, fatigue, 
eye strain and diseases of heart and kidneys. 
Treatment. — 

Bathe the head gently and freely with cool water and soon the little one 
is quiet and lets you continue bathing. Remove cause. Begin general treat- 
ment by moving the bowels. 

Take sulphate of magnesium (epsom salts), 2 ounces and cream of tartar, 
2 ounces. Mix, and for a child one year old give % teaspoonful in water 
every three hours till the bowels move freely ; younger babies in proportion. 

COLIC. 

What Causes Colic in Babies? 

The baby is improperly fed, for colic is always due to imperfect diges- 
tion. In nursing babies it is generally due to irregularity in the health or 
habits of the mother, or to change in her diet. Too frequent nursing is often 
the cause. 
Is Colic Ever Dangerous? 

Yes ; the crji^ng may cause a rupture. 
How Does a Baby With the Colic Act? 

The baby cries violently until it is blue in the face, its belly or abdomen is 
swollen, hard, and tense. The child doubles up, clinches its fists and then 
straightens them out with violent jerks. These symptoms last a variable 
time, then cease, often after a passage of wind from the mouth and bowels. 
How Can Attacks of Colic Be Prevented? 

Keep the feet and legs warm, in fact the whole body; regulate the diet 
propdrly and the habits of the mother. These are the best preventives. 
If Nursing Gives Relief, Should the Baby Nurse During an Attack of Colic? 

No; for nursing only gives temporary relief and furnishes more fuel for 
the colic, since in most cases it is due to fermented food. Give the colicky 
baby some hot water if it is thirsty. 
What is the Proper Treatment for Colic? 

The nursing mother must carefully watch her own diet. Regular and 
longer intervals for nursing, and less quantity. Give more water. 

In bottle fed infants the proteids are at fault. Reduce them, that is, the 
skimmed milk. If necessary, reduce the cream and sugar and starch. Colic is 
usually accompanied by green or mucous stools when too much proteids are 
given. 

General Treatment. — First, see that the feet are warm. Apply flannels 
to the abdomen (belly) or let the baby lie upon its stomach across a hot water 
bag. 

If colic continues inject into the bowels % teacupful of warm water con- 
taining 10 drops of turpentine, and at the same time gently rub the belly so 
as to start the gas (wind). If gas is in the stomach, give % soda mint tablet 
in 1 tablespoonful of hot water. 



. -W'l 



ALL ABOUT THE MOTHER AND HER BABY. 433 

If stomach is filled with food, give % to 1 teaspoonful of syrup of ipecac 
every 15 minutes until the child vomits, or one tablespoonful of goose grease 
or any drippings kept in the kitchen for cooking, or % teaspoonful of alum 
in a wine-glassful of water or syrup. Tickle the throat with a feather or finger 
or spoon handle. If vomiting does not quickly follow any of these remedies, 
try y^ teaspoonful of mustard in % glass of warm water ; this succeeds often 
vyhen all others fail to ca^use vomiting. Give two teaspoonfuls of common 
salt in a wine-glassful of water, or a cathartic to get rid of irritating material. 

Here is a remedy from Dr. Douglas of Detroit, who is a great specialist 
in children's diseases. — ■ 

Bicarbonate of soda 40 grains. 

Aromatic syrup of rhubarb 4 fluid drams. 

Syrup of senna 5 fluid drams. 

Syrup of orange 1 fluid dram. 

Give one teaspoonful two or three times a day as needed, for sour, gassy 
stomach with constipation or foul smelling stools. ^ 

Home Remedies. — 

Soda Mint Solution. — 
One-half teaspoonful of baking soda. 
One-half teaspoonful of aromatic spirits of amvnonia. 

For a one year old child give one teaspoonful spearmint or peppermint 
water in a cup of hot water, and repeat if necessary. 

Frequently, relief can quickly be obtained by givin^^ some drink such as 
peppermint, anise seed tea, catnip tea, etc. Gin and wkiskey are also good; 
mix them well with soda mint solution above, if you have it. 

The above home teas are very good. Make them as )^ou would any tea. 
The longer they are steeped the stronger they become. 

Chamomilla, 3rd trituration; one tablet every % hour. Give this when 
the belly is terribly distended because of no relief from gas. Chamomilla tea 
is also good. Teas may be used freely. 

Make peppermint, anise seed and catnip teas the same way you make 
the infusion from store teas. You can buy these drugs cheap at drug stores 
with directions on each package. They are much more harmless than store 
tea. Usually take two ounces of the medicine to a pint of boilins; water and 
give one to two ounces of this solution every % to 1 to 3 hours, as needed. 
This dose is for an adult ; give only one-twelfth of this amount to a baby. 

TEETHING. 
V^hen and in What Manner Does Teething Come in a Healthy Infant? 

There are 30 teeth in the first set, The two central lower incivsors are 
usually cut first, from the fifth to ninth month. The four upper central teeth 
next, from the eighth to twelfth month. The other two lower central teefh and 
the four front double teeth come from the twelfth to the eighteenth rr.ionth. 
Then follow the four canine teeth, the two upper ones being known as the eye 
teeth and the two lower as the stomach teeth. They generally corrie between 
the twenty-fourth and the thirtieth months. 

At one year a child usually has six teeth ; at one and one-half years, usuaJly 
twelve teeth ; at two and one-half years, usually twenty teeth. 

Permanent teeth, which number thirty-two, usu^tlly appear in the fol- 
lowing order and time: first molars at 6 years; inci::f3rs, 7 to 8 years; bicuS- 



424 THE PEOPLE'S HOME MEDICAL BOOK. 

oids, 9 to H years ; canines, 11 to 14 years ; second molars, 13 to 15 years ; 

third molars (wisdom teeth) 18 to 25 yeai^s. 

Does Teething Necessarily Cause Convulsions and Other Sicl?ness in Babies? 

Not necessarily. A healthy baby, unless it has a peculiar constitution 
seldom has convulsions from this cause alone. A nervous, irritable baby that 
is poorly nourished and whose system is already deranged by previous ill 
health is very likely to have trouble when teething. 

Children very robust and apparently healthy sometimes have convulsions 
when teething. When they do it is often due to the fact that the gums are 
sore, hard and tough, which holds them down so hard on the tooth that the 
nerve is irritated and convulsions follow. 
Do Convulsions During Teething Call for Lancing? 

Such a condition calls for proper lancing, especially when accompanied 
by the child's being fretful, restless, or sleepless. The child may start and 
jump when sleeping. It is sometimes necessary to lance several times. 
Lancing is not very painful and the relief is soon seen by the change in the 
child. 
What are the Early Sigr^s of Teething? 

Several weeks before, there is usually an increased flow of saliva (drool- 
ing). The child chews upon everything it can get its hands on. 
Do You Approve of Giving the Baby Anything to Bite Upon? 

I A soft rubber ring may be used; hot the nipple, for the baby will then 
get the colic from sucking wind. Nothing hard should be used. 
What Causes the Mother to Dread the Second Summer During Teething? 

It is then that the first molars and also the canines usually come. These 
two groups of teeth may cause trouble if the teething comes when it is very 
warm, damp and muggy, especially in improperly fed and poorly nourished 
children. Bad weather and improper feeding cause more convulsions and 
diarrhea (looseness of the bowels) than teething. 
What is the Cause of Early Decay in Infant's Teeth? 

This is generally due to improper food and a neglect to keep the mouth 
clean. Sour stomach will also cause it. Take a piece of absorbent cotton, 
dip it into boiled water and gently clean the baby's mouth after it has nursed 
from the bottle. The mouth of a breast infant usually needs no attention. 
Usually before the teeth come the mouth needs no attention. 

Keep the bottle and nipple thoroughly clean. They should be boiled once 
a day for 15 to 20 minutes and cleaned thoroughly after every nursing with 
hot water, etc. 
What are the Disorders Resulting From Teething? 

There is sometimes considerable constitutional disturbance, more or less 
pain and discomfort, fever, vomiting, diarrhea or convulsions resulting from 
teething. 
Can You Aid Teething With Medicine? 

Calcareaphos (Homeopathic), 3rd trituration. — 1 tablet four times a day 
and continued for weeks. In cases where mothers find that their children do 
not teethe readily, this, given during the last four months of pregnancy, will 
helrp. 
Is It Well to Check the Loose Bowels Coming During Teething? 

Never directly with binding remedies for nature is trying to carry off 
poisonous materials in the bowels. It is generally best to give a mild laxative 
to g^t rid of the content:, of the bowels in severe cases and this frequently 
stops the trouble. 



ALL ABOUT THE MOTHER AND HER BABY. 485 

la Change of Air Beneficial to Teething Children? 

Yes, go to a dry Gooler climate, but you must dress the child th6roughly 
to protect it from the climatic change. Loose bowels frequently come from 
the child's getting chilled. 

SORE MOUTH. 
Is Sore Mouth, Stomatitis, Thnlsh or Canker Common in Children and What 
are the Causes? 

This is very common, especially in hand fed babies. It may be due to 
dirty nipples, but is usually due to improper feeding and too much food, 
causing indigestion. 
How Soon Does Sore Mouth Appear? 

Any time after the first week. 
What are the Symptoms of Sore Mouth? 

Nursing is painful ; the child will drop the nipple and cry; drools and has 
foul breath. The mouth is red and on examination yOu will find one or more 
sores inside of the lips or Cheeks and on the tongue or under it. These may 
be like a pin head or as large as a pea and are usually white at first and ash 
gray later. There may be from one to fifty of them and they may form ulcers 
with red edges, sometimes covering the entire inside of the mouth. 
What is the Treatment for Sore Mouth? 

Treatment. — Reduce the food afld drink, and have regular tim«s for giv- 
ing them. For foul mouth use stomach powders. — 

Calomel : . . . i 1 grain. 

Baking soda w 10 grains. 

Mix, and divide into 10 powders and give one every one to two hours 
until the bowels move and carry off the fermented food. The stools must 
return to the healthy, yellow, inodorous, mustard consistency before the 
baby is well. 
Local Treatment. — Sore Mouth Powder.— 

Powdered borax 1 dfam (teispoonful). 

Powdered sugar 4 drams (4 teaspoonfuis).

of borax and water ; 1 part borax to 4 parts of water. 

Borax 1 part, sage tea 3 parts, honey 3 parts. Make a salve and apply 
gently. 

Or, Golden Seal (fluid extract of hydrastis) 1 part to 5 parts of water.

hoUfs, as needed. This is very gfood. 

DIARRHEA.

especially, the amount of cream. Feed less and not so often. In severe at- 
tacks with vomiting and frequent foul stools, stop all food at least 18 hours 



426 THE PEOPLE'S HOME MEDICAL BOOK. 

and all milk for a longer time and move the bowels freely with a cathartic, say 
castor oil. Broth (thin) and barley water may be given. Rest is very essen- 
tial; cooling drinks may be given. The following is good. 

Subnitrate of bismuth 2 drams. 

Chalk mixture 2 fluid ounces. 

Paregoric 2 fluid ounces. 

Mix and give one-half to one teaspoonful every two to four hours as 
needed for loose bowels in a child six months to two years old ; give after 
the bowelsi have first been cleared with castor oil or bne of the other prescrip- 
tions given. You may vise injections (enemas). 
Homeopathic Treatment for Diarrhea. — 

Chamomilla, '3nd dilution; Nux Vomica, 3rd trituration; Arsenicum, 3rd 
attenuation; Mercurius Sol. Homeopathic remedies, if given in tablet form, 
should be given every 1 to 2 to 3 hours and generally one tablet. If given in 
liquid form, 1 to 2 teaspoonfuls usually every 1 to 2 to 3 hours. If you use 
the 2nd or 3rd dilution put 10 to 20 drops in % glass of water and give as 
directed. 
How Many Stools a Day Should a Baby Have During the First Month? 

Two to three a day for the first week and then one to two a day. 
How Many Stools a Day Should a Baby Have After the First Month? 

One to two or more, but more depends upon the character of the stools 
than on the number. They should be light yellow and inodorous (without 
special odor). Meat juices cause dark brown stools. 
Does Diarrhea in Children Always Indicate Disease? 

It is only a symptom. Green, slimy, foul, watery stools are always dan- 
gerous and need attention. Diarrhea may be a safety valve in the beginning, 
but if it continues it may cause serious trouble and needs attention lest serious 
loss of strength occur. 

CHOLERA INFANTUM. 
What are the Symptoms of Cholera Infantum? 

The onset is sometimes sudden and without any premonitory symptoms 
but this is exceptional for there is generally a premonitory diarrhea which 
is so rnild it attracts no attention. When, however, a weak baby has a per- 
sistent, foul smelling diarrhea, accompanied by marked loss of flesh and a 
dull mind, it should cause anxiety. If the features become suddenly pinched 
and the skin about, the neck, face and hands becomes wrinkled, the case is 
alarming. Sometimes it starts suddenly with thirst, vomiting and loose 
bowels and the child is very, ill from the start, with increasing thirst, vomit- 
ing, diarrhea and restlessness. The two main symptoms are vomiting and 
purging. Vomiting is often persistent and is first food, then some mucus and 
bile. The thirst is terrible but water, etc., when taken, are instantly thrown 
up in severe cases. Stools are frequent, watery and large, often painless and 
involuntary, sometimes looking like dirty water, sometimes without smell, 
while again the odor is terrible. Prostration is rapid, the fontanelles (soft 
places in the head) are depressed, the face is pale and pinched and the eyes 
are sunken. 
When is Cholera Infantum Most Prevalent? 

During heated time, in hot muggy weather. It occurs often in babies 
under 18 months old but more frequently in those under one year of age. 



ALL ABOUT THE MOTHER AND HER BABY. 427 

Are Bottle Fed Babies More Likely to Have Cholera Infantum? 

Yes. '/ 
What is the Treatment for Cholera Infantum? 

Homeopathic Treatment. — Veratrum Alb., 3rd trituration, 1 tablet every 
hour, dry on the tongue for cases with much pain, violent thirst, great weak- 
ness, cramps in extremities, cold hands, feet and forehead. 

Arsenic Alb., 3rd trituration. The same dose for the following symptoms, 
etc., — watery burning stools, unquenchable burning thirst, great weakness 
and exhaustion, emaciation, thirst with great restlessness and vomiting. It 
will frequently control vomiting. 
Allopathic Treatment for Cholera Infantum. — 

For strong stools. — 

Bismuth sub^allate 1 dram. 

Common soda % dram. 

Mix, divide into 30 powders and give one every 1 to 3 hours. Lessen the

Common soda V2 dram. 

Dover's powder 10 grains. 

Mix, and divide into 30 powders and give one every two hours as needed, 
for a child 9 to 13 months old. 
Allopathic Treatment. — (Hare.) 

Give 1/50 grain of podophyllin, dissolved in a few drops of brandy and 
mixed with a little water, every hour until three or four doses have been used ; 
or, instead, use 1/500 grain of bichloride of mercury. This may be given and I 
think is better than the former. If there is much vomiting, drop medicine into 
mouth with a medicine dropper, a few drops at a time. When symptoms 
of collapse occur, surround the child with hot water bottles. Apply over 
abdomen (belly) the following spice poultice. 

One tablespoonful each of allspice, cloves, nutmeg, and cinnamon. 
Moisten it with warm brandy or vinegar and renew as frequently as it be- 
comes hard or dry. This is a very good remedy. 
What Food and Care Must be Given a Baby with Cholera Infantum? 

Discontinue milk. Give raw meat juice, a few drops at a time to a baby ; 
if much pro.strated a drop or two of brandy may be added. If nursing excites 
vomiting, stop for a time. To satisfy thirst, wrap a small piece of ice in 
a linen rag and let the baby suck this. Albumin water, given cold. 

To prepare albumin water, take the white of 1 egg in V^ glass of water 
and stir slowly for five minutes ; don't make it frothy ; strain through a cheese 
clpth, sweeten and flavor if necessary and feed four teaspoonfuls every 14 
hour. Enemas, if carefully given- 

CONSTIPATION. 

What Shall I Do for a Constipated Baby? 

If the mother is constipated, regulate her diet so as to produce regular 
stools. If necessary, she must use enemas for she must have one good 
passage daily or the baby will be affected. 
How Should Constipation be Treated in Bottle Fed Infants? 

Should skimmed milk (the proteids) produce it, as shown by curds or a

very gassy condition, it calls for more cream, sometimes more milk sugar or or- 
dinary brown sugar in half the quantity, or some of the prepared foocfi. In in- 
fants over 9 months old orange juice may be tried. Sugar produces soft stools 
and if used too much the baby will have sore bowels and buttocks. Too 
much cream produces vomiting, Juices should be given y^ hour or more he- 
fore morning feeding. In older children reduce amount of white bread, toast 
and potatoes. Give graham bread, green vegetables, oatmeal and fruit. Raw 
scraped apples are very good. 

Is Castoria a Good Remedy for Constipation? ; 

It may be in some cases. 

What Temporary Treatment May be Tried for Constipation? 

Enemas of warm water, using from one tablespoonful upward according 
to age. Enemas of warm soapsuds, using same amount. Enemas of warm 
water and glycerine, one part of glycerine to three parts of water. Glycerine 
is irritating — look out for this. 

These injections may be given with the soft rubber ear syringe in very 
young babies and with the soft rubber and hard nozzle syringe in older ones, 
or a hard rubber syringe with a smooth nozzle which has a capacity of six 
ounces. 

Where injections are not convenient, a soap stick suppository may be 
used or a glycerine svippository when soap one does not act satisfactorily. 

In obstinate cases not relieved by above means, use y^ to 1 teaspoonful of 
sulphate of magnesia dissolved in 1 to 2 tablespoonfuls of warm water and 
inject into bowel and retain for an hour or two to soften stool. Press upon 
the anus at first so as to retain the liquid. 

In some cases, as an enema, 1 to 4 ounces of warm sweet oil. A large 
piston syringe with large nozzle must be used. 

The best suppositor)' for continual use is the gluten suppository of the 
Health Food Company. Give them the first thing in the morning-. They act 
slowly, usually taking about two hours. In obstinate cases one may be used 
at bedtime also. Great care should always be taken not to injure the baby. 
Cover well all objects entering the bowels with oil or vaseline. 

Where none of these means succeed, the mother is driven to use some laxa- 
tive such as castor oil, aromatic cascara, syrup of rhubarb, syrup of senna, 
fete,, doses of which are always given on the bottle. The followmg is very 
good : — 

Bicarbotiate of soda 40 grains. 

AfQinatic syrup of rhubarb 4 fluid drams. 

Syrup of senna 5 fluid drams. 

Syrwp of orange , 1 fluid dram. 

Give one teaspoonful two or three times daily, as needpd. Give medicines 
in the morning and only enough to cause one stool. A teaspoonful of olive 
oil or a teaspoonful of black molasses is also good, 

COLDS. 
What is the Treatment for Cold in the Head? 

Local Treatment.— Clean nostrils carefully with warm water as often 
as they are obstructed and grease the nose, lips and throat twice daily 
with one of these :— Kiamphorated oil, sweet oil, olive oil, white vaseline, lard or 
gfoose grease. Put a v^ry little into the OQstril with a Qamel's-hair pencil, or soft

Allopathic Treatment. — 

Where there is much fever and distress, give the following remedy. 
Put five drops of tincture of aconite into % Cup of water and give one tea- 
spoonful every thirty minutes until the child perspires, then stop. This dose 
is for a child one year old ; a smaller dose for one younger, say ya teaspoonful. 
This can be given with the following : 

BiHiodide of ttiercufy 1 grain. 

Milk sugar ; , >,.. 100 gf aifts. 

You can *et this medicine in tablet form, 1/100 of a grain to the tablet. 
Mix thoroughly and give a small pinch of the powder evefy two to thfee hours 
to a baby one year old. If there is no fever you need not give the first liquid 
as this alone is all that is necessary. 

Homeopathic Treatment.""Aconite, 3rd dilution. Put 15 drops into a 
glass % full of water and give two teaspoonfuls every one to three hours. 

Arsenicum Alb., 3rd trituration — when S3^mptomS are : — nose Stopped Up, 
difficult to breathe, sneezing, burning, watery discharge. Give one tablet the 
same as Aconite. 

Nux Vomica is given in the same way for the same Symptoms as Arseni- 
cum, with these additional— constipation, indigestion or much gas in the 
bowels. Then it should be given instead of Arsenicum. 

SORE THROAT.

Pain in swallowing, cries whenever it takes the breast or bottle and makes 
a forcible attempt to SWallOw. Generally there is fever and the child looks 
and acts sick.

When sweating appears, give Belladonna instead, the same way and prepared 
the same. 

Mercur. BiniOdide, 3rd trituration. — 1 tablet every two to four hours when 
there is muCh saliva in the mouth. This follows well after Belladonna. Apply 
cold compress on neck and give warm or cold drinks internally.

year old. This may be given alternately with the above powder. 

If the bowels are constipated they should be opened with enemas or 



430 THE PEOPLE'S HOME MEDICAL BOOK. 

some laxative before mentioned, such as castor oil, etc. The following: is 
very good ; 

Calomel 1 grain. 

Milk sugar 10 grains. 

Mix thoroughly, and make 10 powders. Give one powder every hour until 
bowels move. 
How can You Examine a Child's Throat? 

Place the child on your lap or table, half reclining, hold its hands and 
head. Take a smooth handled spoon, insert gently between teeth; child will 
then cry and open mouth; push spoon to back of tongue and press down 
gently. Look for the tonsils (two lumps on the side) and look in back of 
throat. If the tonsils are swollen and very red the child may have tonsilitis. 
If they have white spots on them the child may have diphtheria. 

SPASMODIC CROUP. 
When Does Spasmodic Croup Usually Come On? 

Usually at night. 
Is Simple Croup Dangerous? 

The ordinary croup of infants is spasmodic croup and is very rarely dan- 
gerous, although the symptoms are very alarming. 
What are the Prominent Symptoms of Croup? 

In a mild attack there is simply a noisy breathing, especially on draw- 
ing the breath, with a tight, barking, croupy cough. In severe attacks the 
child's breathing is more noisy and becomes difficult. There is a hollow, dry, 
barking cough. 

Treatment for Croup. — Warm atmosphere ; apply cold cloths externally 
to the front of the throat until feverish symptoms subside. You may also 
use hot cloths or poultices on the throat. You should have steam from a 
croup kettle or common tea kettle. This is made more effective if the child 
is put into a tent made by a raised umbrella or four connected posts with 
a sheet or thick covering thrown over them and the steam introduced beneath 
this tent. This is very good. A little lime in the kettle would aid much. 
Homeopathic Treatment. — 

If there is fever, alternate Aconite, 3rd dilution, with either Hepar Sul- 
phur, 3rd trituration or Spongia, 3rd trituration ; give one tablet every fifteen 
minutes, dissolved in water. Hepar is better when the cough is a little loose 
and child is light haired. Spongia, when cough is very hoarse- tight and 
barking. You do not need aconite unless there is fever. 
Allopathic Treatment. — 

Syrup of Ipecac. If symptoms are severe, give 10 drops every fifteen 
minutes until child vomits. To allay cough afterward, use — 

Syrup of Dover's powder 1 fluid dram (% teaspoonful). 

Enough simple syrup to make 2 ounces (16 teaspoonfuls). 

Mix, and give % teaspoonful every two hours for a one-year-old child. 
Or, fluid extract ipecac, % to 1 drop every 15 to 30 minutes, until vomiting 
occurs. Or, give % to 1 teaspoonful (according to age) of powdered alum 
misled with honey, syrup, goose grease, or water. It produces vomiting and 
sweating and loosens the cough. 



ALL ABOUT THE MOTHER AND HER BABY. 431 

Another Croup Remedy is — 

Syrup of ipecac 3 teaspoonfuls. 

Hive syrup 4 teaspoonfuls. 

Water 1% ounces. 

Dose — % teaspoonful every % hour until the child vomits and then repeat 
every two to three hours, if needed. 

You may also put 1 teaspoonful of turpentine in the tea kettle and steam 
the child as above described for lime water. 

Give enough onion syrup to make the child vomit. Onions fried half 
done in lard and applied to throat are also excellent. 

MEMBRANOUS CROUP. 
How Does Membranous Croup or Laryngeal Diphtheria Develop? 

Verv gradually. 
What Should Be Done? 

The room should be very warn# Hot cloths or poultices should be ap- 
plied over the throat and either a croup kettle or tea kettle kept boiling in 
the room. To make this more effective, raise an open umbrella over the 
child or put it in a crib with a sheet raised on posts over it and introduce 
the steam beneath this tent. If the symptoms are urgent, 10 drops of syrup 
of ipecac should be given every 15 minutes until vomiting occurs freely. 
What are the Symptoms? 

The cough has a dry, brassy, croupy sound; it comes on slowly for 
days, becoming gradually worse. (Other croup is sudden and usually at 
night.) Breathing is difficult, becomes gradually harder and noisier. Day 
by day all symptoms increase and finally the child chokes unless relieved. 
What is the Treatment? 

Generally considered identical with diphtheria and so general treatment 
is the same. Antitoxin, intubation, tracheotomy; used early. 

BIRTHMARKS AND MOLES. 
Should Birthmarks Be Removed? 

These grow rapidly the first two years — called "Nevi." Should always be 
removed by a surgeon when infant is small. 
What Can be Done for Moles? 

Should be removed by a skilled physician or let entirely alone. 

PRICKLY HEAT. 
What is Prickly Heat? 

This is a fine red rash appearing over any or all parts of the body. It 
appears, too, in adults and generally in very hot weather and is due to too 
much heat and perspiration and shows mostly upon the neck and upper part 
of the body. There is a light itching and tingling feeling. Resembles scarlet 
fever but there is no fever or sore throat and careful examination shows the 
rash thickest under the parts of the clothing where perspiration is profuse. 
What is the Treatment for Prickly Heat? 

Cooler clothing is always needed. 

Citrate of Magnesia. — ^You may give a large dose if medicine is necessary, 
say one-half to one teaspoonful for a child one to two years old. Give fre- 
quent cool baths and anoint afterward with olive oil. For the itching, bathe 
parts with saleratus water, 1 teaspoonful to a pint of water; or, parts may 



433 THE PEOPLE'S HOME MEDICAL BOOK. 

be dusted with starch powder. Cocoa butter is excellent. Rub the affected 
parts well with it. 

ECZEMA. 
Is Tbis Very CotniUQn? 

Most' common of all skin diseases and also the ruost obstinate!. 
At What Age Does Eczema Occur? 

It occurs at any age. Some of the WQrst cases are in infants one to sjjt 
months old. 
Where Does Eczema Occur? 

Most frequently on the head, face, hands, crotch, groins and the joint 
folds. 
What are the Marked Characteristics of Eczema? , 

Obstinacy in healing, tendency to return, moisture or wfepiug^ from the 
diseased surface. 
What are the SymptQips of Ecjsema? 

Skin is bright and in patches and is covered with minute vesicles 
(pimples) the size of a pin head. These soon rupture and discharge a sticky 
watery fluid which forms a crust of variable thickness with moist raw flesh 
underneath. 

In other cases the skin is dry, red, thickened and somewhat scaly. In 
this form (salt rheum) the skin cracks readily and often bleeds. It may crack 
in other forms also. 
What are the Causes of Eczema? 

Sometimes hereditary. Frequently due to improper food. General weak- 
ness, bad hygiene, teething and any local irritations are also causes. 
How About the Itching of Elczema? 

This is almost unbearable and it is difRcult to keep the child from scratch- 
ing. Often prevents sleep. It is sometimes necessary to cover the hands 
and fasten them down to the side when sleeping. Take a piece of cotton two 
to three inches wide, pass under the back and fasten it to each wrist. Make 
it long enough to allow a little motion, but not sufficient to reach the neck 
or face. 
What is the Treatment for Eczema? 

In young infants all cleaning must be done with olive oil or disinfecting 
starch water. The irritated surfaces must be kept dry and excluded from the 
air by light cool dressings as heat always increases the itching. Under these 
dressings an ointment must be kept constantly applied and this ointment 
should be covered with paraffine paper.

Thi? makes an excellent varnish for the face and hands -vyhen cha,fed as 
it is not readily noticed and is also very good for wet qr raw surfaces on in- 
fants or adults, as it does not dry on. It js excellent for burns or scalds and 
will cure mild eczema. Where the surfaces ^f^' moist and keep wetting the 
dressing, a powder should be dusted oi\ until this moisture stops, then the 
zinc ointment applied. 

Perspiring Powder. — 

Tannin ^ ounce. 

OjEide of zinc Va ounce. 

Rub into flue powder and use as above directed. "VVhere pruats form, 
us^ sweet oil liberally on the crusts and it will soon soften and remove them. 
Mothers must remember that eczema will always continue, if not completely 
excluded from air and moisture, also that no soap or water can be used. Use 
oil, as above directed. Any of the ointments given above are very good. It 
is well to have enough, for ezcema is very slow to cure. 

In general eczema, recourse must be had to the mask to give protection 
frorrj the intense itching and scratching. Disinfect the skin with horic acid 
solution; boric acid % ounce to boiled water 1 pint, and apply the zinc oint- 
ment (above) freely and cover with pieces of gauze, leaving openings for eyes, 
nose and mouth. Apply to all diseased surfaces and hold fast with thin cool 
bandages applied for days without removal. When removed, all unhealed 
parts can again he covered until cure ia effected. 

Allopathic Medicines. — Keep bowels open with epsom salts, 2 oz. and 
cream of tartar, 2 ounces. Mix and give one-half to one teaspoonful everj'- 
two to four hours to child one year old, vntil bowels move. 

Homeopathic Treatment. — Arsenicum, 3x; Graphites, 6ix; Sulphur, 6x; 
Rhus Tox., 3x. 
When is Kczema Most Likely to Return? 

In the fall. 

MILK CRUST. 
What is Milk Crust and What Can Be Done For It? 

Due generally to neglect in removing the free sebaceous or oil secretion 
on the scalp, which, when allowed to remain, forms this crust. Keep thor- 
oughly clean and if it occurs use treatment described for eczema, both local 
and general. 

CHAFING. 

What are the Causes of Chafing? 

1. Want of cleanliness in changing and using diapers, 

2. Acrid diarrhea. 

What is the Treatment for Chafing? 

1, Not too much or too strong soap. 

2. Careful rinsing of the body. 

3. Not too vigorous rubbing, 

4, Free use of a dusting powder in all folds of the skin — starch powder 
or oatnjeal powder, If necessary use the following : 

Bpracic acid ..,.., l dram (i teaspopnfiil), 

Glycerine 1 dram (l teaspoonful). 

Balsam Peru , 1 dram (1 teaspQonful). 

Vaseline 1 ounce. 

Mix, and make an ointment and apply. 
28 



434 THE PEOPLE'S HOME MEDICAL BOOK. 

The beeswax and lard ointment given for eczema is also good. 

Too much attention cannot be given to the diapers. They should be 
changed as soon as the child passes urine (water) or has a passage from the 
bowels. Diapers should be boiled in water to which soda has been added 
and before being again used should be aired and dried thoroughly by slow 
heat. Such care in addition to rules before mentioned will do away with 
chafing. 

Another ointment for chafing and one which will not stain is : 

Boracic acid 1 teaspoonful. 

Glycerine 1 teaspoonful. 

White vaseline 1 ounce. 

Mix, and make ointment and apply to sore parts. The chafed parts may 
be cleaned with sweet oil and a little absorbent cotton, and the skin kept cov- 
ered with a dusting powder composed of powdered starch, 2 parts and boric 
acid, 1 part. You may use this instead of starch or oatmeal. It is more heal- 
ing for severe chafing. 

But absolute cleanliness in taking care of discharges from the bowels and 
in changing diapers as soon as soiled by the urine (water) is necessary. 

HIVES— NETTLE RASH— URTICARIA. 
What Can be Done for Hives? 

Be careful of the diet and give castor oil or salts. Not frequent in infants. 

STOMACH RASH -TOOTH RASH. 

What is the Treatment for Stomach Rash or Tooth Rash? 

Baking soda 40 grains. 

Aromatic syrup of rhubarb 4 fluid drams. 

Syrup of senna 5 fluid drams. 

Syrup of orange 1 fluid dram. 

Mix, and give one teaspoonful two or three times a day to move the 

bowels. 

CONVULSIONS. 
What is the First Thing to be Done in Case of Convulsions? 

Keep the child perfectly quiet with ice on the head, or cold water cloths if 
ice is not handy. Put the feet into a hot mustard bath and roll the entire body 
in large towels which have been dipped in mustard water, two heaping table- 
spoonfuls of mustard to one quart of warm water. Have plenty of hot water 
and a bath tub at hand in case a hot bath is necessary. If the child has some- 
thing in its stomach that is injuring it, produce vomiting by tickling inside 
of throat. Be careful for it may bite your fingers. Put the handle of a tooth- 
brush, fork or knife in its mouth. Keep it. there during the spasm, then it 
cannot bite your finger or its own tongue. If there is anything in the bowels, 
give an injection (large one). 
When is a Hot Bath Useful for Convulsions ? 

If the convulsions have continued until the pulse is weak, the face very 
pale, the nails and lips blue, and the feet and hands cold, then the hot bath will 
be useful to bring the blood to the surface and relieve the heart, lungs and 
brain. 
How is the Bath Given for Convulsions? 

Water should not be over 106° (Fahrenheit). Apply test with a ther" 



ALL ABOUT THE MOTHER AND HER BABY. 435 

mometer if possible, otherwise you may burn or scald infants. If no ther- 
mometer is handy, plunge your naked arm into the water up to the elbow. It 
should feel warm but not uncomfortable. One-half teacupful of powdered 
mustard added to the bath is a good aid. 
When is Another Convulsion Likely to Occur? 

When a phild does not become soft and natural after the convulsion, 
but remains stiff with the thumbs drawn into the palm and does not recog- 
nize the voice of its mother or attendant it will, usually, have the convulsion 
repeated indefinitely for hours. 

Internal Medicine to Prevent Convulsions.^ — 

Bromide of potash « % dram. 

Chloral hydrate 15 grains. 

Simple syrup 3 ounces. 

Mix, and shake bottle, then give one teaspoonful every hour, while the 
child is nervous or feverish, to prevent convulsions. This dose is for a one- 
year-old child.

Sometimes suddenly but usually very gradually with sore throat and 
often swelling of the glands around the throat and under the jaw ; with white 
patches upon the tonsils or soft palate or a very free discharge from the nose, 
which may be bloody. A very bad smell comes from the mouth. The largest 
number of cases occur from the second to the sixth year. (See General Dis-

MEASLES. 

What are the First Symptoms of Measles?

after exposure, with a cough, sneezing, watery eyes and nose, much like an 
ordinary cold. The eruption spreads slowly over the body. (See General 
Diseases.) 
Is Measles a Serious Disease? 

In infants and during the winter season it is likely to be very serious, 
because pneumonia (lung fever) and bronchitis may accompany it. 
When and How are Measles Contagious? 

In the early stage from the beginning of the catarrhal (cold) symptoms, 
two or three days before any eruption is present; less contagious after the 
eruption fades. It is not often carried by healthy persons and the infection 
does not cling long to a sick room.

ALL ABOUT THE MOTHER AND HER BABY. 437 

RICKETS. 

What are the Causes of Rickets? 

Generally insufficient and badly chosen food. Nursing babies are. sel- 
dom troubled unless the mother is herself ill or continues nursing too long, 
that is, into the second year. They may look plump and fat but they are weak 
and do not walk early. The teeth are more or less delayed and decay early. 

What are the Symptoms of Rickets? 

It is always suspicious if the child has no teeth at the end of the first 
year. It is very suspicious if the anterior fontanelle (soft spot on front of 
head) is as open as it was some months previously. It should be closed in 
a well nourished infant by the 15th to 20th month. If, in addition to these 
symptoms, it has sweating about the head whenever it sleeps, if it crie§ when- 
ever it is handled and dislikes play and sports which other children of like 
age delight in, it is pretty conclusive evidence that the child has rickets. 
There is generally an enlargement of the wrists and ankles and the head be- 
comes square or box-shaped. 

At What Age is Rickets Most Common? 

Between six months and two and a half years. 

What is the Treatment? 

The child should have plenty of fresh air and sunshine. Look carefully 
after the urine (water) as soon as it becomes smoky, has a strong odor, is 
irritating to the skin and stains the clothes. It is due to unsuitable food. 
Reduce the amount, or change the food. Look carefully to the stools and take 
alarm as soon as they become foul, bad colored, pasty or of variable con- 
sistency. Select the proper food. This is essential. When a child shows 
any signs of rickets some iron tonic should be given with a perfect diet. 
The following is good : 

Allopathic Treatment for Rickets. — Buy an ounce of syrup of iodide of 
iron or gyrup of iron phosphate and give three to ten drops three times a day 
for a one-year-old child. Continue this for one to tfiree months or longer. 

Homeopathic Treatment for Rickets.^-Calcarea Phos., 3rd trituration — 
one tablet three to four times daily for months. The idea is to get proper 
food. They generally recover but are sometimes left deformed if treatment is 
not commenced soon enough.

bination partly with potash and other bases. Should one be surprised then 
that the lemon is valuable in the treatment of so many diseases. A solu- 
tion of citric acid in water (34 grains to an ounce) corresponds in acidity to 
fresh lemon juice but is not so good for medical purposes on account of the 
absence of the other constituents.

sore throat and is also effective in the first stages of diphtheria. If desired, 
a little sulphur may be mixed with it.

AUTHOR'S PREFACE. 



Though the world is full of cook books of every description, yet it has 
been my experience that there are few of them that are more than a collection 
of recipes. There are few really good teachers of the science of cooking. For 
the past thirty years the author has been engaged in teaching of some kind, 
ranging from kindergarten work to assistant at Chicago University and from 
private teacher of cooking to Public Lecturer on Domestic Science. This 
training has not only given me a knowledge of the subjects in hand but has 
perhaps rendered me capable of imparting this knowledge to others in a way 
to be easily understood by all. 

Having managed a homcof my own for twelve years and having lived 
in both the country and the city have probably given me a knowledge of the 
practical needs of the average home. Further than this, I am called upon reg- 
ularly each week by 'phone to direct the culinary affairs of many Cleveland 
homes, thus giving me the practical experience which is lacking in so many 
teachers of Domestic Science. Furthermore, during the past five years I have 
delivered (and am still engaged in the lecture work) a series of over six hun- 
dred public lectures on cooking, a larger number than ever before delivered 
on this subject by any woman in one place. These things have brought me in 
direct contact with thousands of people of all classes, given me a knowledge 
of their needs and at the same time fitted me for imparting this knowledge to 
others in a practical waj. 

Having been principal of private schools and being at the present time a 
member of " The Domestic Science and Art Association " of Cleveland, and 
" The American Home Economics Association " of Chicago, and also State 
Secretary of " The Associated Clubs of Domestic Science " has brought me in 
contact with many of our ablest instructors in Domestic Science and afforded 
me an excellent opportunity to get the best and most modern ideas relative 
to the science of cooking. These ideas I have endeavored to incorporate in 
this work, leaving out the technical things and making them practical for the 
home. 

I believe in having system in the home and a business-like management 
of household affairs as is attested by the fact that I am author of " Mrs. Kirk's 
Card Index Cooking Recipes " and also of " Handy Expense Cards for Hoxjse- 
keepers " and ** Correct Combinations of Foods for Daily Use." 

I have given over two hundred of my choice recipes in this work and for 
these I have, adopted the form used in my " Card Index Recipes." It will be 
noticed at a glance and without reading the recipe, one can tell just what 
materials are required and the quantities of each. One can also tell the utensils 
that are necessary and thus have everything in readiness before beginning the 
work. Then are given full and complete directions for putting together and 
cooking the ingredients., These directions I have endeavored to make so 
simple and complete that the girls and the young housewives with no previous

experience can use these recipes and be certain of good results. Though the 
cook with many years of experience may become so skillful that she can 
" guess " at quantities and generally get good results, yet it is necessary for 
the inexperienced to observe absolute accuracy in following every instruction. 
In fact, the time has gone by for " guessing " at quantities. Use accuracy and 
you will never have failures for the same cause always gives the same 
results. 

Preceding each chapter will be found the general principles underlying 
the science of cooking and I believe it will pay every woman to carefully study 
and follow these rules, for cooking is now as much of a science as is any other 
branch of knowledge. I believe that cooking and the management of house- 
hold afifairs should be a pleasure rather than a drudgery. I believe that a 
knowledge of proper foods and the proper way of preparing them is one of 
the most important sciences, for our health and temperament, and conse- 
quently our happiness and success in life, largely depend upon what we eat. 

Though the two hundred recipes make dainty and attractive dishes, yet I 
have had due regard to economy and the " Favorite Home Recipes for Every 
Day Use " have been gathered from mothers living in all parts of the world. 
They are the dishes " like mother used to make," and I believe they will be 
found the most simple and practical collection of recipes for every day use that 
has ever been published. 

It has been my object in this work, not only to give some of the general 
principles underlying the art of cooking, but also to give simple and practical 
recipes that can be used in every home in the country.

NO. 1. TABLE LAID FOR SINGLE SERVICE FOR INFORMAL DINNER. 

LAID FOR SOUP COURSE. 

The soup plate is on a service plate which is an eight or ten-inch plate. Observe 
closely the accuracy with which knife, fork, spoons, goblet and other service are placed 
on the table. The soup spoon is placed to the right of the knife and the soup ladle to 
the right of the soup spoon. Using left hand for removing cover of tureen, you are 
ready to take the ladle in right hand and serve soup which may be passed to other 
members of the family at table. 

The water glass or goblet should always be placed at end of knife blade. The 
bread and butter plate is on the left side at end of fork. The silver is always used 
from the outside toward the plate, either from right or left. Napkins should always 
be placed on left side of fork. Twenty-four inches is the usual space allowed for each 
cover or person. 




(Photographed especially for this book.') 

No. 2. DISHES TO BE USED IN INFORMAL DINNER FOLLOWING TABLE 
LAID FOR SOUP COURSE AS SHOWN IN NO. 1. 

Note convenience and care in arrangement of the dishes to be used for the re- 
mainder of this dinner. It saves a great deal of time and anxiety to have every dish 
in readiness for use and, at the same time, this table should be as attractive as the 
dining table. For time saving this table may be drawn up close to the hostess where 
she may easily reach many things without rising from the dining table. 




(Photographed especially for this book.) 
NO. 3. TABLE LAID FOR COFFEE AND DESSERT. 

This represents the same table shown in No. 1 at close of dinner. The dessert 
spoon and after-dinner coffee spoon are at the right of the dessert plate which is 
brought in with the finger bowl on it and set down before each guest, the finger 
bowl being removed to the back and left of the plate. Then the dessert is brought 
in and passed or placed on the dessert plate, the water and claret glasses remaining 
during the entire meal. When dessert is finished the finger bowl is replaced on the 
plate ready for use. The tips of the fingers are dipped in the water and wiped on 
the napkin. Never put the napkin in the finger bowl. If necessary to wipe the lips, 
do this by wetting the finger tips, touching the lips and then wiping with the napkin. 

The coffee percolator is convenient and sociable and adds very much to the final 
entertainment of the guests and is coming more and more into every-day use. 




(Photographed especially for this book.) 

NO. 4. TABLE SET FOR A DINNER WHERE THE FIRST COURSE IS A 

FRUIT COCKTAIL. 

This is to be followed with a soup course or not as one chooses. The small plate 
holding the cocktail glass is on the regular ten-inch service plate which is to remain on 
the table for any other course which is to follow up to the regular meat course when 
it is to be removed and regular dinner plate brought in. 

The knives, forks and spoons are arranged in their respective places. The fork 
to right of knife is the one to be used for the cocktail; or, if much juice is in the cock- 
tail, a spoon should be substituted in place of fork, being laid in exactly the same 
place as the cocktail fork. All silver placed to the right of the meat knife is sup- 
posed to be used preceding the meat course. 

Note the arrangement of the glasses: the water glass at the end of the knife 
blade; cordial glass next, which is taken at the beginning of the meal; the sherry glass 
next, which usually comes with the fish course and may be omitted if no fish is served; 
and the next is the claret glass which is to be used during the entire meal.

NO. 6. A KITCHEN CABINET AND CONVENIENCES IN A MODERN 

KITCHEN. 

In the kitchen most women take too many steps in preparing meals or doing 
their ordinary baking, Much of this work may be accomplished while sitting on a 
stool which should be in every kitchen. Besides showing all the conveniences gathered 
m one spot for comfortable working this illustration shows utensils in readiness for 
bread making — the bread mixer to the left. Note the accurate measuring cup which 
is divided into halves, quarters and thirds and is very important to use in all cooking. 
In fact, there ts no such thing as luck in cooking in these days and accurate measurement 
is absolutely necessary. With all supplies and utensils in one place much labor and 
drudgery are saved in the kitchen. Note Recipe and Expense Cards at left.

THE HOUSEKEEPER'S SCIENCE OF COOKING 

OR 

DOMESTIC SC IENCE I N THE HOME. 

" Good cooking means the knowledge of .all fruits, herbs, balms and spices, and all that 
is healing and sweet in fields and groves, and savory in meats. It means carefulness, inven- 
tiveness, watchfulness, willingness and readiness of appliances. It means the economy of 
your great-grandmothers and the science of modern chemists." — Ruskin. 

THE HOUSEKEEPER'S CREED. 

I believe housekeeping and cooking is and should be interesting and 
worthy work and that the majority of women would enj®y it if they had the 
opportunity to know more of its science ; that it must be considered elevating 
— the highest art — and not a menial and brainless occupation. If a man is not 
ashamed of his profession or work, there is no reason why a woman should 
be ashamed of hers. 

I believe before marriage every woman should show to the man she 
is to marry that she thoroughly understands the work of making and keeping 
the home on a perfectly systematic and business basis, as much as the man has 
shown her that he has a profession or business capable of providing the income 
for the maintenance of home and family. 

I believe that marriage is a life partnership with mutual interests as well 
as love; a partnership of square dealing and equally shared responsibilities, 
and should not be entered into from any other motive. 

It is reasonable to suppose that the young woman should be able and 
willing to keep house as conscientiously as she has taught school or music or 
used the typewriter. 

Can you use the salary of the young man wisely, economically and so that 
each of you may live comfortably, besides saving a little for the proverbial 
" rainy day?" This question should be answered before marriage. 

I believe home making, housekeeping and all that goes with it is not 
drudgery, is not a narrow sphere for the woman, but that it is the very high- ' 
est type of living. 

" He who gives us better homes, better books, better tools— a fairer outlook and wider 
hope — ^him will we crown with laurel." — Emerson. 

WHAT CONSTITUTES HOUSEHOLD MANAGEMENT. 

Not many years ago everything made to meet the needs of the people was 
created in the home. Now, as diiiferent shops and factories have taken most 
of the productions and developed them into large and flourishing industries 
and manufactories, there are two jjroblems always to face, and these are — 
preduction and consumption. It is interesting to watch the wonderful strides 
of today in producing wealth, but it is of at least equal importance how this 
money is spent ; and the home is the center for the consumption of this wealth. 
It has been said by students of Home Economics that the greatest financial 
losses come through the home. If this be true, then women should begin to 
have a better understanding of the practice of economy in the home. First, 
they should help and encourage in every way to increase the income; and 
2-1 1 



2 THE PEOPLE'S HOME RECIPE BOOK. 

second, to lessen the expenditures. It is not always what we earn, but how 
that is spent that insures the best economy and results in perfect, or nearly 
perfect, household management. At the present time the difficulty with the 
housekeeper is not so much that she has lack of income, as that she does not 
always spend wisely. 

Women are almost having their first real awakening to the fact that they 
must acquire more knowledge and skill to do the work in the home success- 
fully and thus live better and have greater enjoyment and prosperity. 

Home-making is, or should be, a business. The home has close business 
relations with the grocer, butcher, merchant, bank and in fact the business 
world in general and only business-like methods can succeed. 

Begin early in life with your daughters and train them in systematic 
household management and home-making and there will be fewer financial 
failures in the business world. 

HOUSEKEEPING A PROFESSION. 

Housekeeping has passed the days of mere drudgery and now ranks among 
the professions. 

There is much thought exercised by the well trained and thoughtful house- 
wife who plans and directs and knows herself how to do any of the work in 
the home. 

We know this work takes more brains than dollars, and education and 
training are necessary for the woman who selects the food, clothing and all the 
works of art for the uplifting and growth of a well-balanced family, mentally, 
morally and physically. She should be trained in the estimation of values, 
in food, clothiilg and household furnishings. 

She should have had practice in the various duties of a home before mar- 
riage. Otherwise the expense comes at the wrong time, which is unjust' to 
the man. Mrs. Ellen H. Richards says, " By teaching the girl under fourteen 
how to cook, she will do it naturally and easily when she is a housewife." If 
women knew how to do this work well, it would cease to be a drudgery. 

A good business man has to know his business thoroughly and apply to 
it ordinary business principles and systematic methods in order to succeed. 
The same is true of housekeeping. 

HOME EXPENDITURES AND ACCURATE RECORDS. 

" An economical household, not a stingy one, makes a successful and contented home." 
— Freeman. 

" In olden times women thought and thought before they spent, often 
making the spending a burden. Now women often spend and then think and 
think and think." There should be some happy medium. 

If we have studied pure foods, good taste in dressing and the same in 
furnishings for the home, we have made great advance in the lessening of 
home expenditures. Accurate accounts should be kept of the allowance for 
such use and what it is spent for. There are many ways of doing this but one 
of the simplest is a card index system on which the expenditures for the day, 
not itemized, but headings, may be quickly noted and footed up at the end of 
the week. This is absolutely necessary for system and economy in the home. 

It is true, that all the members of the family must unite in this if it is 
successful. They must all agree upon a universal or given standard of living. 
It is better to divide the income to cover the necessary expenditures and then 
try to live within it. The figures must be before you or you will find waste 
and more waste. One housekeeper recently said to me in trying my Expense 



DOMESTIC SCIENCE. 3 

Cards, " I found I was not losing on my regular expenditures, such as gro- 
ceries, etc., but my * miscellaneous ' was appalling." Twenty-five cents today 
and another tomorrow seems very little but for a month or year it means 
much loss. 

ORGANIZATION AND DIVISION OF LABOR. 

It is very easy for most of us to imagine the home where no system or 
organization exists. — ^There is no order; things are placed here today and 
there tomorrow and valuable time is spent in searching for articles which have 
no settled resting place. This kind of living, or staying, more properly speak- 
ing, reacts upon every member of the household. The work is much harder 
and costs infinitely more in time, strength and money than a definite and well 
regulated home would cost. " It is not the revolution that wears out the 
machinery, it is the friction," and nowhere is this so true as in the home. If 
the housewife has had no training or experience her troubles are legion. It 
is first in knowing how and what to do, the proper division of this labor, and 
when it is to be done. It makes very little diflference whether it is the woman 
with no servants or one with several. It is now conceded by every thinking 
individual that the housewife must not only know how the work is to be 
done ; but must be able to plan, systematize and direct the same. 

Applying this knowledge every day, one need not carry the kitchen or 
three meals a day " on their shoulders " from morning until night, but have 
regular hours for definite and systematic work, recreation or study. It is very 
easy to direct " Mary " to do the washing, bake a cake and have company for 
dinner, and it is quite another thing to know the necessary time required to 
do these things. 

System is the keynote of the home. Each day's work should be planned 
in advance; in fact, a written or printed plan of work should be in every 
kitchen. Then a written menu of the meals. These may be written on cards, 
one for each day of the week, and indexed under the card index system so uni- 
versal now. On the opposite page may be references showing where recipes 
for certain dishes may be found, or any other notes. The grocery order should 
be made out and the refrigerator consulted at the same time. " Woman's 
work," it is said, " is never done." It has been largely her own fault. Plan, 
systematize, and pigeon-hole your work ; in other words, get rid of it, which 
will be a wonderful ;:are-remover. 

Woman's life, as a rule, is made up of little things. This is particularly 
true in the spending of small sums of money; five cents here and there, then 
a dime, quarters and dollars until in this small spending they do not realize 
that " tremendous whole." 

I repeat, housekeeping is a profession and it is the careful watching of 
just the right time to buy, and what to buy, that constitutes good household 
management. Much depends on the manner or style of living whether you 
should buy in large or small quantities. Find the happy medium between 
the hand to mouth style of living and the buying in too large quantities, which 
may mean waste. Marketing is an art. We had better say to market well is 
an art. Buy foods in season as nearly as possible. If you can only purchase 
a little, buy that which is good and use every bit of it. It is the little wastes 
that fill the garbage can. 

A WELL EQUIPPED KITCHEN AND THE UTENSILS. 

" The best is the cheapest " is a good rule to follow. In many homes the 
surprise is that the meal can be prepared with the meager kitchen equipment 



THE PEOPLE'S HOME RECIPE BOOK. 



provided. Be proud of your kitchen and utensils but take care of them. The 
very best of utensils may soon be useless if placed over too hot fires, especially 
gas. On the other hand a medium priced article in the hands of a skilled 
worker may outwear the very best utensil in the hands of a careless one. 

Many accessories in the kitchen have come to be looked upon as " must 
haves" through long use. The evidence of utility in 'everything, together 
with good taste and judgment in every selection, are the great essentials in 
buying kitchen as well as other utensils. 

Fireless Cookers and Steam Cookers are doing much to overcome this, 
as in either of these methods of cooking neither food nor utensils can be burned. 
Do not buy every new thing that comes out. Find out whether it is of prac- 
tical use, then buy it and use it. Too many articles and in inconvenient places 
are as bad as not enough. Have a convenient drawer or hook for utensils and 
always have them in that place and no other. 

The Fireless and Steam Cookers and Bread Mixers are among some of the 
kitchen utensils that have come to stay and it is the intelligent, thinking, up- 
to-date housekeeper that is looking for the practical, helpful and attractive 
equipment for her kitchen.

HOUSEKEEPER'S EVERY DAY SCHEDULE. 

" In any community organized on really healthy lines, the average woman will have 
quite enough to do in her own home, whether she is rich or poor. Nowhere else can she 
do work of such value to the nation." — Theodore Roosevelt. 

Kitchen calendars or schedules have probably been written for nearly 
every cook-book published. It has been a serious question in my mind how 
much time and thought to devote to this. If the housekeeper will use it, it is 
worth while. If she is a " guess cook " or " near enough " it would be waste 
of time to prepare it. 

With the thousands of women with whom we have come in contact in the 
past four years, I know they are steadily advancing along the line of better 
and more wholesome living, and more accurate cooking. By such these pages 
will be read and consulted or a copy made and framed to hang in the kitchen. 
One of the most difficult problems the housewife has in her cooking is deter- 
mining the tempeij^ture of the oven for baking. Moderate, hot, very hot, cool, 
etc., may not mean the same thing to one that it does to another. Thermom- 
eters are coming into general use, are inexpensive and will do much to not 
only relieve the anxiety attending the baking, but there will not be failures 
as before when it was all guess work. We are learning to be systematic and 
accurate in all that pertains to housekeeping and cooking ; and as a result work 
is easier and we have better cooked foods with fewer failures. 

A half-pint measuring cup of tin or glass can be purchased at any depart- 
ment store for five or ten cents, and it is standard for all recipes given. Do 
not expect perfect results using a tea cup one time and a cofifee cup another, 
or guessing at the halves, thirds or quarters. No matter what your experi- 
ence or judgment, in order to have a recipe give perfect results, always — ^with 
all conditions equal — there are certain measurements which must be strictly 
followed.

BAKING. 

" She can bake, she can broil, she can fry, 
Ne'er a cake does she spoil, nor a pie. 
She's perfectly neat. 
Her temper is sweet. 
And this is the reason why." 
Much depends upon the regulation of heat in planning any definite time 
for baking ; an oven may be slow for some things, quick for others and so on. 
Follow recipes and note the time and kind of oven given ; this will be of more 
service to the housekeeper than all the tables ever written. Bread and cake 
cannot be baked once or twice in three months and you know much about tem- 
perature of the oven. This knowledge of ovens only comes by continual prac- 
tice, or, as before stated, by the use of a thermometer often enough to become 
perfectl)' familiar with its registrations. 

TABLE SETTING AND SERVING. 
(Table Etiquette.) 
When hearts are light and spirits gay 
You almost hear the table say: 
" These people give me hearty cheer, 
I'm very glad they're round me here." 
If food is wholesome, linen white, 
China and silver polished bright, 
With pride the table spreads its leaves. 
Glad to dispense what it receives. 
With friends in loving converse near 
The table speaks for all to hear. 
It says as plain as table can: 
" Draw round me all, I'm spread for man." i 

—Table Talk. 
The duty of setting the table usually falls to the daughter of the house, 
if there is one. If not, the mother has this added responsibility if she has no 
helper in the home, and even then, if she wants care and neatness in this most 
artistic work, as the maid of all work does not have time to devote to it. 
There should be a certain personality in the setting of a table that belongs to 
some member of the family. And there are some absolutely fixed rules for 
the placing of the service on the table. 

In the first place the linen should be spotless and white and as fine as your 
style of living will warrant ; the simpler linens for every day use and the finer 
ones for special occasions. They may be all this, but if they are not ironed 
with great care and the corners of cloth and napkins folded perfectly even, 
the very foundation of table setting is a failure. 



BREAD MAKING. 7 

Have a soft pad or under-cloth on the table before the cloth is laid. The 
linen then wears better, looks richer, and there is less noise from the dishes 
and silver. Lay the cloth perfectly smooth and straight, being careful in doing 
this not to make a wrinkle. Place the knives to the right of each place with 
the blade turned toward the plate and the fork to the left, each one inch from 
the edge of the table and allowing about twenty-four inches for each guest. 
Place teaspoons to the left of the fork and soup spoons and oyster fork to 
the right of the knife. Do not place too much silver on the table at once; 
better have it brought in later, as needed, by the one doing the serving. 
Place the butter plate back to the left of the tip of the fork, and the water glass 
to the right at the tip of the knife. 

The napkins should be folded perfectly square and placed to the left of 
the forks. The remaining setting of the table all rests entirely upon the in- 
genuity and good taste of the housewife. Just a suggestion — keep it simple 
rather than have too much on it. Nothing speaks more loudly for the refine- 
ment of a family than the perfectly set table. 

In the serving, when a maid is in attendance, all food should be served 
from the left side. If it is passed, to be setdown, from the right side. Nearly 
eighty-five per cent, of the families are without help in this country; conse- 
quently, most of the serving is done at the table; or, members of the family 
take turns and in this manner there is less confusion. 

bread'making. 

(Including Muffins, Rolls, Pop-Overs, Gems and Griddle Cakes.) 

" Full many a gem which should have raised serene. 
Burns to a crisp behind the oven door, 
And many a sack of flour is borne to burst unseen. 
And waste its whiteness on the kitchen floor." 

Flavor, in bread, by many people is considered one of the first requisites ; 
and the difference in flavors is entirely due to the amount of soluble carbohy- 
drates and the kind of flour which will produce the greatest per cent, of gluten 
both in quality and quantity; and again upon the fermentation used in the 
making. 

Every housekeeper who wishes to be able to make perfect bread, should 
acquaint herself thoroughly on the subject of " flours." And any of the best 
cook-books will enlighten her on the subject with very little effort on her part. 
The housekeeper must know all she possibly can of flour, yeast, fermentation 
and baking, in order to attain anything like success. There are two distinct 
kinds of flour called Spring and Winter. 

The Spring wheat is stronger and contains the greater amount of gluten 
(muscle building food^, and for this reason will retain more moisture and 
produce a greater number of loaves of bread than the Winter. I mean by 
this the hard Spring wheat. Personally, I prefer a blending of Spring and 
Winter wheat, providing the mixture is largely Spring, 

A good bread flour should be a rich creamy yellow, rather " sandy " in feel- 
ing and should fall apart easily when taken between the thumb and forefinger. 
Good pastry flour is not so yellow in appearance and is easily packed into a 
little cake, when pressed between the thumb and forefinger. 

In the following recipes for bread making it has not been possible to give 
the exact amount of flour, as different flour, even from the same mill, re- 
quires more or less liquid. 



8 THE PEOPLE'S HOME RECIPE BOOK. 

These liquids may be water, milk, or milk and water together. The most 
wholesome bread is made without butter or lard. If you are in doubt about 
your yeast, a little sugar may be used, which will help to create the neces- 
sary activity. Of course, you will not expect good bread from poor yeast; 
but the sugar will aid the growth of yeast plants still alive. Butter and lard 
retard the yeast and when used a little additional yeast should be supplied. 

Bread should be well kneaded and this is more easily accomplished by 
using a Bread Maker, It is the only hygienic way to knead the bread, and 
these machines can be purchased at from $1.35 to $3.50 and are a great saving 
both of time and labor. Bread can be well made and spoiled in the baking. 
The oven should be ready for the bread, and that at a temperature of what is 
called a " quick " oven, or if you use the oven thermometer ten minutes after 
13 for twenty minutes, and then cooling to five minutes of 13, for the remain- 
ing twenty-five minutes. Remove the bread from the oven; do not cover, 
but allow the air to circulate freely around it. When cool place in a clean, 
dry, bread box, which has been washed, dried over a little heat and closed to 
keep out any particles of dust, which carry germs, producing mold.

two or three teaspoonfuls, cover and set 
this to rise, while the milk and water 
mixture is cooling. When that is luke- 
warm, add the yeast sponge, and only 5 cups of the flour all at once, with the 
salt. It is better to add the remaining cup of flour as you see that it is needed, 
but be very careful and not put in too much flour as this will make the bread 
dry. Now turn the mixer for about 15 minutes, then if it is still sticky, add 
the remaining flour, half a cup at a time until your dough is just right. 
It is kneading, as much as the flour, which relieves the stickiness and makes 
it smooth and springy to the touch; better too little, rather than too much 
flour. About 30 or 30 minutes is usually sufficient for this kneading in the 
mixer, then cover and set in a warm place. Now this does not mean hot, 
nor in hot water, nor on a radiator where you would get uneven temperature) 
but out of drafts, in a perfectly warm place. Let rise two hours or until' 
it doubles its bulk, or breaks down and leaves a hole when you place your 
finger int© it. Have your pans greased and warm (not hot), and divide the 
dough into two equal parts, shaping lightly into loaves, put into the pans and

cover with greased paper, setting in the same careful temperature to rise 
an hour or until it has doubled its bulk and the pan feels light. Now with 
all of this care, bread may be spoiled in baking if you do not understand 
your oven. Have a hot quick baking oven. Put in the bread when ready 
and bake for 15 minutes; it should just begin to have a delicate color. Now 
lower the temperature a little so that it is a steady, moderate heat and 
bake it for this sized loaf 45 minutes. Practice is the only sure success to- 
wards good bread making. 

If you desire a stronger flavor to your bread, knead for ten minutes after 
the first raising and let rise again. This takes a little longer time than the 
first process. This will make two loaves of bread.

batter, which will run from the spoon, 
from the best buckwheat flour, at the 
same time adding the salt. Beat well 
and let stand over night. In the morn- 
ing take out a pint of the mixture and 
set to one side. Now put into the 
pitcher the remaining ingredients. 

Mix lightly all together and bake on a 

hot griddle. 
If there is any left after baking add the pint to it which has been set to 
one side, and the night before using pour in a pint of lukewarm water, add 
the salt and sufficient flour to make the batter as previously directed, and 
proceed as before, except now add one-half teaspoonful of baking soda dis- 
solved in a little boiling water and stirred in carefully just before baking. 
Always save out some batter the first thing in the morning for the next 
baking. If some white flour is desired simply lesson the quantity of buck- 
wheat but these cakes eaten occasionally will cause no trouble. 

Making the batter in this way may be continued for a week if kept in 
a cool place, then if any is left it should be thrown out and start fresh again.

14 THE PEOPLE'S HOME RECIPE BOOK. 

CAKES, 

(Including Butter Cakes, Sponge Cakes, Layer Cakes, Loaf Cakes, Fruit 
Cakes, Cookies, Fillings and Icings.) 

" The character of all work depends upon the intelligence of the person who performs it." 

All measurements level unless otherwise stated. Flour sifted before 
, measuring. 

There are only two kinds of cakes — ^butter cakes and sponge cakes, and 
they must be considered separately as to the manner in which they are put to- 
gether and in baking. All butter cakes are stirred or beaten ; for all sponge 
cakes, a motion called " cut " or " fold in " is used. This refers to the manner 
in which the flour and sugar are put into the cake. One stroke too much in 
sponge or angel cakes only toughens them. 

There are three things very necessary in cake making. 

First — material,, which should be the very best butter, freshest eggs, fine 
granulated cane sugar, pastry flour and pure cream of tartar baking powder. 

Second — putting the materials properly together. 

Creaming the butter, gradually adding the sugar and then alternating with 
whatever liquid is used and flour. Whites of eggs if used, beaten stiff, and 
then the baking powder. This is only a general principle and all depends upon 
the texture desired in the cakes. 

Third — ^this is the most difficult task of all, and it is knowing how to man- 
age the oven. 

If I say " a moderate oven," that may mean one thing to me and another 
to you. The same is true of any other temperature and nine-tenths of the 
failures in cake making come through not understanding the proper relation 
of heat to the cake in the oven. Oven thermometers are coming into common 
use and will no doubt prove very helpful. There is no such, thing as luck in 
cake baking. There must be accuracy in measurements with all the other 
qualifications named. Cake baking is a science. Science is exact' knowledge. 
Know the very best ways of doing, follow your recipe accurately and with 
some knowledge of the laws of heat in the oven and success is assured. 

Never remove a cake from the pan until perfectly cold. 

Never use a greased pan. 

Use the best cream of tartar baking powder. 

See that all utensils and materials are ready for use before beginning your 
cake. 

Use as few utensils as possible to insure good work. 

Be neat and orderly in your work and do not scatter flour and spill 
materials. 

A cake made with water instead of milk will be more tender and keep 
moist longer. 

To be a successful cake-maker one should make cake often, at least once 
a week, until you have mastered the general principles involved in it and then 
good judgment and brains must be mixed with every cake to insure success. 

Cakes without butter require a very moderate oven; in fact, start with 
barely a warm oven until raised to its full height; then increase slightly to 
brown. 

Cakes with butter require a moderatiely hot oven. 

Layer cakes are baked more quickly than lOaf cakes. 



CAKES. 



15 



All molasses cakes and gingerbreads require a moderate oven as they 
burn easily. 

Steam fruit cakes, when possible, and finish half an hour in a moderate 
oven to brown. 

The " one, two, three, four cake " used by our grandmothers is really the 
mother of all butter cakes used today, while the sponge cake is the foundation 
from which angel food and sunshine cakes are derived. 

Certain proportions are used as guides in all butter cakes ; there is less 
sugar than flour and less butter than sugar. Where no eggs are used more 
baking powder is necessary. For instance, one teaspoonful of baking powder 
is suificient for each cup of flour if several eggs are used. Do not use too 
much baking powder as the cake is likely to be coarse grained and dry quickly. 

It is not necessary to have so many recipes as it is to obtain changes ki 
flavoring and filling.

Cook one pint of maple syrup and one-fourth cup of butter until it forms 
a soft ball when dropped in cold water. Just before the syrup is cooked 
enough add four tablespoonfuls of water to one-half pound of marshmallows 
and set them over the hot water. When they are melted beat them into 
the syrup mixture and continue until cool and stiff enough to remain on 
the cake. This should be soft and creamy and cut without cracking. Spread

" Enough is as good as a feast." 
" Most of the want and much of the misery in this world may trace its begin- 
ning to lack of early training in the fundamentals of self development, character 
building and thrift, using the world in its best sense." — Good Housekeeping. 

(All Measurements Level.) 

The people of this nation live under intense excitement and energy, and 
with this great mental activity which ' really seems necessary in this age, 
meats, at least in small quantities, should be used for quick results. We are 
living, however, in a vegetable period and not a meat period, or more correctly 
speaking, we are just coming into it. 

Where one demands meat and another vegetables much depends largely 
upon the life they live. In a vegetable diet of the right sort followed with less 
rapid living there is nothing better. 

Pork should never be used by anyone who desires the best of food, but 
there can be no laws laid down as to what one should or should not eat. Think 
for yourself, investigate and study the best authorities on the subject. 

Find out the foods with the combinations best suited to your particular 
needs and manner of living and then live as near to this standard as possible. 

In the ordinary family the greater part of the muscle building and re- 
pairing of waste tissues is probably furnished by meat. If all the women 
knew how to buy and cook the cheaper cuts of meat it would help to keep 
down the prices of the more expensive cuts, besides, giving the family a larger 
percentage of nutrition. Most cooking of meat has been too rapid. " Get a 
meal quickly " has been the housewife's cry. Yes, and empty your purse 
quickly at the same time, has been the result. 

While it is true the better the piece of meat the better the result, as a 
general thing it is possible and desirable in the average family to save expense 



MEATS. 23 

■where it may be done without serious loss. Wise buying and careful cooking 
applies particularly to meats. Good meat may be spoiled by poor cooking and, 
on the other hand, an inferior piece of meat can be made exceedingly palat- 
able by knowing just how to cook it. All sorts of good appetizling dishes may 
be prepared from the so-called cheaper cuts of meats. Never drop meat from 
your bill of fare unless you can supply the proper elements to nourish and 
sustain the body through other foods. 

The housekeeper who does her own marketing should know how to buy 
not only the cheaper cuts of meats but the better ones as well. This practical 
knowledge of marketing on the part of the housekeeper affects to a marked 
degree both the comfort and the expense book of the family. Intelligence and 
skill in buying are only secured by careful practice and the purchaser must 
not be afraid to ask questions or show her ignorance when necessary. Most 
men in the markets will be found courteous and helpful if you will only let 
your wants be known. If your meals are planned ahead, and they should be, 
more than a single day's orders may be purchased ahead. This saves time 
and energy as the meat is the basis upon which the remainder of the meal is 
planned. 

Recipe 1. ' ROAST BEEF. 

To roast a piece of beef perfectly is no small art and yet so little has to 
be remembered to do it well. 

The oven should be very hot. 

Wipe the meat with a wet or damp cloth ; place it in the baking pan, add- 
ing one teaspoonful of salt (not over the meat) and enough boiling water to 
keep the pan from burning. Sear well over the top. When this is done, lower 
the fire to a hot oven, dust the meat with pepper and bastp often until done. 
This will require about twenty minutes to the pound, or longer if it is liked 
better done, although the best juices and~ sweetness of the meat are lost <by 
over-cooking. 

Two things must be kept clearly in mind and these are : — first, have the 
oven hot; second, when the meat should be basted, baste and let nothing in- 
terfere. 

Another way is to have a covered roaster. Then the meat is put in dry 
and it is self-basting, which does away with much extra, work. 

Again, a roast may be placed in the baking attachment of the Fireless 
Cooker and with the soap stones heated and all covered closely with the hood, 
the roasting will be perfectly done without heat in the kitchen and the house- 
wife free to do as she chooses.

for soups or gravies. If boned, it is rolled with a piece of suet and tied ; this 
is a much better way than using skewers as they are in the way when carv- 
ing and difficult to remove. There are two terms, " roasting " and " baking." 
The former is placing on the broiler over the pan, searing first one side and 
then the other and proceed as you would for steak, reducing the tempera- 
ture and lowering the flame to finish, basting with the fat and allowing 
fifteen or twenty minutes to the pound. 

For baking proceed just the same except place in a covered baking pan 
with sufficient hot water to keep from burning the pan and sear for fifteen 
minutes, then reduce the heat, add the salt to the pan, dredge the 
meat with a little pepper and finish as for roasting. Remember that slow 
cooking will add greatly to the flavor of pork but will destroy . entirely thf. 
flavor of beef. If dry and tasteless it has been poorly cooked.

Turn once more and put the onions 

on the meat and add the boiling water. 
Cover and simmer slowly one hour; season with salt and pepper and con- 
tinue to cook until done, an hour and a half or two hours. The secret of a 
pot roast is more in the cooking than in the meat, being sure not to let it 
boil at any time. Have. sufficient liquid in the kettle for gravy which may be 
thickened with a tablespoonful of flour after the meat is removed to a 
platter. Pour the gravy over the whole and sprinkle with finely chopped 
parsley. 

Potatoes may be cooked with this and half a pound of well-washed prunes 
may be added for flavor and served with the roast, or removed and pickled 
to be used as a relish. 



Recipe 4. IRISH STEW WITH DUMPLINGS. 

Put three ounces of suet into a kettle. When the fat is rendered out of it, 
remove the cracklings and slice one onion in the fat and cook until a nice 
brown. Have two pounds of lean meat from the round cut into two inch 
squares, to this meat add two tablespooniuls of flour. Rub well together then 
throw into the hot fat and shake over a hot fire until nicely browned. Add 
one pint of stock or water ; stir until boiling. Slice one carrot, add one bay 
leaf, 1 teaspoonful of kitchen bouquet, 1 teaspoonful of salt, and pepper to 
taste. Cook slowly for one hour and a half. Ten minutes before the meat is 
done add dumplings made as follows:

tablespoonful of butter melted to which you have added salt and pepper. 
Lift the steak carefully to the platter and baste with the butter and season-

steak two inches thick requires twenty minutes for broiling; one and a half

turn them as soon as seared. Sear and 
turn again and so continue for five 
minutes. Then lower the flame under 
the pan and broil slowly for five min-^

thick. Be very careful that there is 
no frying. Turn all meats more often than when broiled under gas or it will 
be fried rather than broiled. Finish the same as the preceding recipe. The 
English Mutton and Boston Chops will require fifteen minutes, and the ordi- 
nary American chop ten minutes. In pan broiling be very careful they do 
not fry, as mutton is fatter than beef.

Reduce the temperature to moderate heat and bake slowly, basting often. 
The time required will be 20 minutes for each pound of veal. Any method 
of cooking requiring long slow cooking, such as stews, fricassees, casserole, 
fireless cooking, etc., is especially desirable for veal. If you use a covered

baking pan the basting is not necessary. The only object of the water is 
to keep the pan from burning and smoking until sufficient fat is obtained for 
basting.

For most housekeepers it is better to have the turkey drawn (that is 
the intestines removed and tendons pulled out) by the butcher. Now all 
that remains to be done is to wring a cloth from cold water and wipe the 
bird both inside and out, or by holding it under the cold water faucet and 
letting the cold water run through ; but do not let the fowl soak in cold water. 
Wipe dry. Truss by drawing the thighs close to the body and hold by

inserting a steel skewer from one middle joint through the body to the other. 
Cross the ends of the legs and tie securely with a string, covering quite well up 
with several thicknesses of oiled paper. Bend the wings so they fit closely to 
the body and then fasten both firmly with another skewer. Draw the neck 
skin well to the back and fasten in like manner. Brush well with melted 
butter and place in the roaster, breast down, laying strips of bacon 
over the back of turkey and dust well with flour. Cover the pan and place 
in a VERY hot oven for fifteen minutes. Gradually reduce the temperature 
until a moderate oven and then finish in a slow oven which will take about three 
hours. Add salt and pepper when half done and turn on its back. If you do 
not use a covered roaster put in sufficient water to keep pan from burning, 
then the turkey must be basted every fifteen minutes, watching carefully 
that it does not brown too fast; if it does, cover with several thicknesses of 
oiled or buttered paper. 

Remove the string and skewers before serving. Garnish with parsley 
or celery tips. 

The true flavor of the turkey is preserved when it is not stuffed with 
a dressing. 

If it is desired, use three cups of grated white bread crumbs, one tea- 
spoonful of grated onion, one-half cup of melted butter, one-half of finely 
chopped green pepper (sweet), one cup of chopped celery and one pint of 
well-washed and drained oysters and salt to taste. Mix together in the 
order given. If desired, a beaten egg or two may be added to this stuffing.

Recipe 7. CHILDREN'S SCHOOL SANDWICHES AND LUNCHEONS. 

"Over the hills and through the valleys 
List to nature's wooing call, 
Seek the field, the shore, the wildwood, 
Summer comes with joys for all." 

Of all the work a mother has to do for her children, none is more trouble- 
some than putting up luncheons day after day with a due regard for variety 
and whblesomeness, and for the fickle and often unreasonable taste of the 
child. If one could only give chocolate layer cake or large cucumber pickles 
every day and nothing else, then, indeed, one might be sure the luncheon 
would be eaten and approved by the small gourmand . but when one has a 
maternal conscience such things must be dealt out infrequently and bread 
and butter offered day by day — a diet to which most children are indifferent 
if not actively hostile. 

How to " do up " a luncheon which shall be. appetizing wholesome, and 
varied day after day, whei? often the larder is bare of dainties, is indeed a 
subject for study. It may be done occasionally with comparative ease, since 
woman's wit is equal to severe strain, but for ten months a year and twentv 
days a month — that gives the most ingenious pause. 

Sandwiches are to be considered first, because one begins with them 
every morning. A good plan is to have them of different kinds of bread, 
either of white and whole wheat each day, or perhaps better, of white one day. 
whole wheat the next, Boston brown bread the third, white again the fourth, 
and little baking-powder biscuit the fifth. Of course fresh baked bread will 
not do ; it must be at least a day old, and should be very thin, with most of 
the crust cut off ; not all by any means, but only the heavy edge. 

Sandwich fillings are legion, many of them nourishing and good, and a 
little handbook of suggestions is a boon to mothers, because invention fails 
so often. These combinations will be found easily prepared and appetizing. 

Meat Sandwiches. — Cold roast beef chopped and slightly salted, between 
slices of white bread. Chicken, cut very thin and salted ; White bread. Boiled 
ham, chopped very fine, mixed with a very little dry mustard; brown, bread. 
Roast veal, finely chopped, with a few olives mixed in ; brown bread. Onfe 
very thin layer of chopped ham and a slice of chicken ; white bread. Corned 
beef shaved very thin ; white bread. 

Salad Sandwiches. — Lettuce leaves on white buttered bread, with a very 
litjtle French dressing made by mixing a teaspoonful of oil with a few drops of 
lemon juice and a little salt. Chopped watercress on buttered bread, white 
or brown, with salt. Very thin slices of cucumber, with salt; white bread. 
Thin slices of tomato, drained of all pulp and seeds and wiped dry; salt. 
Nasturtium leaves, with French dressing or salt. Lettuce with a little cream 
cheese spread on it, and salt or lemon juice. Watercress and cream cheese. 
Celery, chopped very fine and mixed with either French dressing or a little 
mayonnaise, or merely with salt and lemon juice ; whole-wheat bread. Chopped 
green peppers mixed with cream cheese. 

Sweet Sandwiches. — Chopped dates, wet with a little cream ; white bread. 
Orange marmalade ; whole-wheat or white bread. Fjgs, chopped fine and wet 
with cream ; whole-wheat bread. Figs and nuts, chopped together ; white 
bread. .Nuts and raisins, chopped together; whole-wheat bread. Candied 
ginger, chopped; white bread. Prunes, chopped with peanuts; white bread. 



MEAT SUBSTITUTES. 35 

Other mixtures are these : 

Hard-boiled eggs chopped and mixed with French dressing. Cream 
cheese, alone or mixed with chopped nuts ; Boston brown bread. Baked beans 
seasoned with lemon juice, mashed to a paste; very thin white bread. Stewed 
oysters, chopped. Olives, chopped ; white bread. 

It is always best, if possible, to have two kinds of sandwiches, one of 
meat, eggs, or cream cheese, and the other of some sweet mixture, perhaps 
two of each. On the day the tiny biscuit are used there may be some thin 
slices of cold meat, with a couple of olives, for a change. 

Never warm or melt the butter, but beat until soft and creamy. The fill- 
ings may be made from all meats, most vegetables, eggs, cheese and the use 
of mayonnaise. Sandwiches depend upon the seasonings and it is very essen- 
tial to have these on hand so as to lend variety to the luncheons and outings. 
Season corned beef or chopped ham with mustard. Roast beef or boiled 
tongue with Harvey, Worcestershire sauce or horseradish. Lamb, with capers, 
tomato sauce, catsup or chopped mint. Chicken or veal with chopped celery 
or celery salt or chopped pimentos. (The latter are a sweet Spanish pepper 
put up in little cans for 13 or 15 cents and a great addition in most all cookery, 
particularly salads and sandwiches.) Fish with onion juice, parsley and 
chives. 

Nuts, cheese, eggs, mayonnaise, celery, cress, cucumbers, tomatoes and 
olives combined with meat and any of these vegetables make delicious sand- 
wiches. 

When they have to stand any length of time after making before they are 
to be used, pack in a stone jar and cover with a cloth wrung out of cold water, 
and when ready to be packed for the lunch wrap in oiled paper, keeping differ- 
ent foods separated by pieces of cardboard, and salads packed in tightly fitting 
jars.

should be given to the best ways of cooking it. 

One of the simple things to remember in cooking is that the albumen 
in the egg coagulates at a high temperature ; hence to have that soft creamy 
consistency, be careful of extremes in heat and too long a time over the fire. 

Eggs for cakes and souffles should be separated and the whites and yolks 
beaten separately. The main thing in the white is the amount of air that is 
beaten into it. The white of the egg never acts chemically upon any of the 
ingredients with which it is mixed, but the membrane being tough it has the 
power of sustaining the air beaten into it ; when carefully folded into the batter 
it sustains that lightness to the end, if carefully baked. 

Hot or warm water makes a much more tender omelet than milk, and 
there is no reason for failure of these most toothsome articles if one is reason- 
ably careful. 

A good omelet pan is as necessary to success as good eggs. A good 
steel spider, smooth, and the right temperature will go a long way toward 
producing good results. 

It is the practice which makes perfect, and if you fail, try again for, " The 
man, or woman, who never makes any mistakes in life never makes anything 
else."

loosen the omelet at the edge, allowing the thin portion or uncooked part to 
run under and so continue until the omelet is " set." Now sprinkle over the 
parsley finely chopped and with your spatula turn over one-third of the 
omelet, then fold once more as you turn it out. Serve at once. More failures 
are reported to me in omelets than in almost any other branch of cooking. 
Each and every detail must be carefully followed to insure success. The stee^. 
spider, perfectly smooth, is the first requisite, then do not beat the eggs too 
much, twelve or fifteen minute beats will usually do the work, and the butter, 
while hot, must not be brown and smoking. These directions carefully fol- 
lowed — not once but always — you cannot fail. 

This omelet may be varied by chopping ham very fine — two tablespoon- 
fuls when chopped — and adding just before folding. Then you have a hanv 
omelet. Peas, tomatoes, oysters, bacon, red and green peppers, sweetbreads 
and grated cheese all lend variety to a plain omelet.

SAUCES. 

(For Meats, Fish, Vegetables, Puddings and Frozen Desserts.) 



" Sauces and soups are the fine art of cookery and the person who understands them 
must understand tastes and flavors and possess a trained palate." 

(All measurements level. Flour sifted before measuring.) 

It is considered a great art by a few cooks and housekeepers to make good 
sauces. Unfortunately, it is the few rather than the many who recognize 
this or really take the trouble to make sauces properly. They hurry over them 
and subject them to too much heat and consequently send to the table a 
thick, disagreeable paste, lumpy or thin and wateryl 

To make good sauces takes a little time, but it, is quite worth while as 
gravies and sauces constitute the perfection of entrees ; even for a simple hash 
it is very necessary to make them with care. When one becomes familiar 
with a basis for all sauces others are quickly and easily made. 

Sauces are intended as an accompaniment to the meat, fish, vegetable or 
pudding with which they are served and should be in perfect harmony with it. 
They should never be so prominent in flavoring or served in such quantity as 
to lose sight of the main dish. Pale sauces and gravies are not desirable, and 
this can easily be remedied by always having a bottle of Kitchen Bouquet in 
the kitchen, and using it sparingly as so little is required to produce the re- 
quired color and flavor. If you wish a white sauce, have it white ; if a yellow 
pn^, yellow ; and a brown sauce should be brown- Browned flour is al§Q ^X- 



SAUCES. 



I'd 



nellent for thickening and coloring and gives a fine flavor but double the 
given amount of flour when desired browned. 

Serve a sauce as soon as possible after making as there is danger of 
separating. 

If necessary to keep hot, set in a pan of hot water. 

All sauces are made or derived from brown or white sauce and the 
flavoring makes the numerous changes. The basis for this is one rounding 
tablespoonful of butter, the same of flour and one-half pint of any desired 
liquid, such as stock, strained tomatoes, milk, cream, water, etc. 

Certain sauces belong to some particular vegetable, meat, fish or dessert, 
such as brandy sauce with plum pudding, cranberry sauce with turkey, apple 
sauce with pork, mint sauce with lamb, and caper sauce with mutton. 

A general principle in uniting material for sauces is, rub butter or fat 
and flour together, and soften with a little of the hot liquid which is heating 
in the double boiler; stir all together until it is the desired tTiickness. In 
this way the flour is most thoroughly cooked, besides more digestible than 
when cooked in the fat. 

The main or standard seasonings are salt, pepper, paprika, onion, bay leaf, 
Worcestershire sauce, Tobasco sauce, mint, capers, and flavorings from meats, 
fish, stock or vegetables. The thickening may be flour, bread crumbs, yolks 
'of eggs, arrowroot, cornstarch or vegetable puree. 

There are many fruit sauces very nice for puddings and ice creams made 
from crushed fresh fruits and the juice and sugar cooked to any desired 
thickness.

is very nice to serve either with chicken or boiled salt cod. For a Butter 
Sauce substitute boiling water instead of the milk or cream, adding it slowly 
beating all the while.

SOUPS. 

(Soup Stocks and Meat and Vegetable Soups.) 



, " Scientific cookery in the home, by the mistress or housekeeper, means the elevation 
of the human race." 

(All measurements level unless otherwise stated. Flour sifted before 

measuring.) 

Most soups are spoiled by making them in too much of a hurry, and cook- 
ing rapidly. 

Retaining the flavor by slow cooking and by having a soup kettle with 



SOUPS. 47 

a itightly fitting cover, made from granite or aluminum or any good ware 
which will not chip, is a necessity in making good soup. 

Have it large enough to contain meat, bones and water, and room for 
skimming. When all is ready and in the kettle, place over the fire and bring 
slowly to the boiling point and skim. Now lower the flame if you use gas 
or set back on the stove to simmer. Never boil soup as it makes it tasteless 
and cloudy. 

Very good soup stock is made from beef alone but it is improved in flavor 
when made from equal parts of beef and veal. Veal and chicken make a 
white stock and delicate in flavor ; or, again, a stock from one-half of beef and 
one-quarter each of mutton and pork, liver and ham are used for flavor. 

Americans are just beginning to learn the value of having soup stock 
always on hand to use for gravies, sauces, made-over dishes, etc., which has 
been much of the secret of taste and flavor in French and other foreign cooking. 

Soups have been looked upon as a dish for the rich. They are for rich and 
poor alike. 

Use the clear soups or those with vegetables for dinner. 

The cream or heavy soups may be served to better advantage for luncheon 
or supper dishes and if we realized the value of soups we would have them 
on our regular bills of fare. 

Soups, however, should not be gulped down or taken into the mouth and 
then swallowed, but held long enough to mix well with the saliva before enter- 
ing the stomach. 

A great variety of soups to suit individual tastes and occasions may be 
made Vv^ith very little trouble, but learn first how to make a good soup stock 
as a basis for many good and wholesome soups.

(Full directions for cooking all kinds of vegetables and retaining theit 

delicate flavors.) 



" We go on in the beaten path without profiting by the varieties to be found on every 
side." 

(All measurements level unless otherwise stated. Flour sifted before 

measuring.) 

Vegetables are divided into four groups : 

1. Muscle Building or Nitrogenous. — ^These take the place of meat and 
are such as peas, beans, lentils, and nuts, 

3. The Heat and Energy Producers. — These must be used in larger quan- 
tities than the muscle building foods. They are rice, white and sweet pota- 
toes, white bread, macaroni, spaghetti, chestnuts and the cereals. 

3. Fat Producers. — These include nuts and olives. This group is one 
not so largely used or considered. Many times used only as " extras " when 
we have company. This is a grave mistake. 

4. The vegetables of this group are important as cleaners and are largely 
water, mineral water and fine flavoring. They include lettuce, radishes, cab- 
bage, celery; in fact, all the green succulent vegetables come under this head 
and are used largely in salads. 

All vegetables should be cooked in uncovered vessels in boiling water 

Vegetables growing above ground should have salt added to the water. 
Underground vegetables, such as turnips and beets, should be cooked in boil- 
ing, unsalted water. 

Dry vegetables, such as old peas and beans should be soaked over night 
in cold water. 

To freshen vegetables when wilted, soak an hour in cold water. Never 
add salt as it softens them ; particularly is this true of cucumbers. 

All vegetables must be thoroughly cleaned before using and nothing is 
better for this than a vegetable brush and a sharp pointed knife. 

Many pages might be written on the food value of vegetable diet. It is 



53 THE PEOPLE'S HOME RECIPE BOOK. 

the one thing in cooking that requires care ; it is the one thing that does not 
get it. There are general principles underlying all vegetable cooking which 
are easy for every housekeeper to understand, if her interest can be aroused to 
do it. As vegetables are generally cooked they are tasteless and there is no 
branch of cooking as carelessly done, both at home and in hotels and restau- 
rants, as the cooking of vegetables. 

Practically all the elements necessary for the building of the body are 
found in vegetables and with these are included nuts and fruits. Health and 
nutrition depend upon the right selection and combination of these. There 
is such a variety of vegetables to be had in every state. Combine with this 
their clean and wholesome qualities and it is a wonder we are such a meat 
eating nation. But vegetable cooking requires greater care than cooking 
meat. Careless and rapid cooking dissipates the flavor and then we have a 
tasteless article. 

Vegetables should not be closely covered while cooking. They are full 
of volatile oils — some more than others — and if these with the gases generated 
by cooking are not allowed to pass off into steam the vegetables are dark and 
strong in flavor. 

Our living, habits, and character are largely dependent upon what we 
eat and we must, to sustain life, eat every year about half a ton of cooked food. 
One can readily see that a large proportion of the health, comfort and happi- 
ness of the home comes from the dining room and kitchen. How important it 
is, then, that we and our daughters should be educated along the lines of 
cookery. The practical kind where they can apply their chemistry both in 
the kitchen and laundry if need be ; their physiology in the selection and 
cooking of foods ; their lessons in fine arts, in the harmony of foods. Never 
be at the mercy of your cook, but know these things yourself. If you do not 
you will have not only badly cooked foods but unfriendly combinations.

the rapid boiling. Let boil very rapidly for ten or fifteen minutes, or until 
a kernel is soft under pressure with a fork. Drain in a colander and hold 
under the cold water faucet, letting the cold water run slowly over it. This 
removes the starch and whitens the rice. Now sprinkle with salt and set 
the colander on a pie pan in a warm oven to dry, occasionally tossing the 
rice up and down. This is a fine substitute for potatoes at least twice a 
week and may be served with a little pitcher of melted butter or butter and 
sugar or a rich brown gravy.

SALADS AND SALAD DRESSINGS. 

" Bestowed with lettuce and cool herbs." 

" Salads refresh without exciting, and make people younger." 

(All measurements level. Flour sifted before measuring.) 

There was a time when it was quite necessary to educate people to eat 
salads. While this might not have been true in foreign countries it has been 
in our own. A salad is by no means a modern invention, as lettuce, 9ress and 
cucumbers were used by ancients for dinner salads, although the dressing was 
quite different. Nothing is more appetizing than a fresh green vegetable and 
French dressing. On account of expense and time simple salads should be 
studied. 

The vegetable must be fresh to crispness, the simple dressing perfectly 
blended and all ingredients cold. It must appeal to the eye as well as to the 
stomach. To become an expert salad maker, one must have a good idea of 
color and form, a very, keen sense of taste, and a desire as well in planning, 
new combinations. Avoid too many mixtures and the materials used should 
be harmonious ones both as to color and proper food relations. 

With lettuce, cress, endive, as the most common " greens " used in salads 
and with any simple dressing you have a perfect dinner salad. 

Salads are not simply the " fashion " but they are in strict accordance with 
our well being and should find a place on every table at least once a day. 



SALADS ANt) SALAD DRESSINGS. 63 

SALADS SERVED WITH FRENCH DRESSING. 
■ Some Combinations. 

Lettuce — Half a tomato, chopped cucumber and green pepper. 

Lettuce — Cream cheese moulded with chopped pimentos and olives. To- 
matoes with mint chopped fine in French dressing. 

Lettuce — Moulded spinach and hard boiled eggs or beets. 

Dandelion — Watercress and tomatoes cut into quarters or eighths. 

Lettuce — English walnuts. 

With any succvilent green vegetable and French dressing you have — if 
well made and served — a perfect dinner salad. 

These green or succulent vegetables contain the necessary salts for the 
blood ; the lemon or vinegar, the acid ; and the oil, a most wholesome and 
easily digested fat. 

The amount of oil to be used in either the mayonnaise or French dressing 
depends upon the individual taste. One person may like more oil and less of 
the acid and vice versa, hence only general rules can be given for these 
dressings.

cream or the white of an egg well beaten. Tarragon or plain vinegar may 
be used instead of the lemon juice if preferred. This should be made in 
five to eight minutes. A Dover egg beater may be used but it will take much 
longer. 

Parsley Mayonnaise. 

Chop and pound fine one tablespoonful of parsley, adding a few drops 
of lemon juice. To this add one cup of good thick mayonnaise and a tiny 
bit of the desired coloring from any good fruit coloring. Do not add any 
fruit coloring unless it is necessary as the coloring from the parsley is usually 
sufficient. If you do not happen to have lemon juice two or three drops of 
alcohol will start the juices and coloring.

DESSERTS. 

(Including Pies, Short Cakes, Tarts, Fruit Whips, Fruit Cups, Jellied 
Fruits, Puddings, Ice Creams and Sherbets.) 



" And if the dish contentment "brings. 
You'll dine with me again." 

(All measurements level. Flour sifted before measuring.) 

In these days of correct and careful living the dessert is the smallest part 
of the meal. It is the final sweet at either lunch or dinner. But the success or 
failure of an entire dinner very largely rests upon the careful selection and 
preparation of this last course. 

Heavy desserts should be avoided when the meat course has been par^ 
ticularly rich and heavy. Desserts should be planned that do not contain the 
same elements as found in the meat. For instance, in a roast pork dinner do 
not serve suet pudding, or in a boiled ham dinner do not serve mince pie, or 
in a roast beef dinner do not serve a custard rich in eggs, as in all of these 
your dinner will be unbalanced. Substitute the light whipped cream desserts, 
fruits or cheese and wafers. 

With a vegetable dinner serve desserts rich in milk and eggs. It may 
all be summed up in a few words. A dessert must harmonize with the dinner. 
It is the beginning and the end which we remember and the dessert should be 
in perfect keeping with the food which has preceded it at the meal. Iced 



DESSERTS. 69 

watermelon and very cold desserts should be indulged in very sparingly by 
most people when they follow a hearty dinner. Nothing, however, shows the 
extreme dainty cooking and thought as does the dessert. This is often pre- 
pared by the housekeeper's own hands and everyone is eager for new ways of 
preparing attractive and delicious dishes. 

Many desserts may be made in the morning and set in a cool place and are 
ready for use when desired. Desserts to be moulded should receive careful 
attention to have perfect success. Wet the mold in cold water before using 
and when ready to remove, dip for an instant into hot water. Lay the dish 
you wish to serve it on over the mold, invert, and it will come out more easily 
than by wiping with a warm cloth as the heat is uniform on the mold and 
leaves no chance for it to stick. 

Frozen desserts are very satisfactory when made at home and the grow- 
ing popularity for many frozen desserts is due largely to the simplicity of the 
present make of ice cream freezers. 

There are large ones and small ones and those specially nice for flat or 
small family use where the freezer can be set in the kitchen sink. Use an ice 
chipper and shave the ice into a pail, using one-third coarse rock salt and two- 
thirds ice and mix well together. Have the freezer can perfectly clean and 
cold. Put the cream mixture into it, adjust all the other parts and pack closely 
the ice and salt mixture around the can and over the top. Turn the crank 
steadily, but not too fast, until it is frozen to the desired consistency. Wipe 
the top of the can to prevent any salty water from getting into it. Remove 
the dasher, scrape off all the cream quickly, pack down evenly and re-cover, 
using a clean piece of muslin for this and a cork to put into the cover. 

Pour off the water from the melted ice and re-pack with ice clear over the 
very top; cover with paper, burlap or carpet and stand aside two hou,rs to 
ripen. The best ice creams are made only from a good quality of cream. 
Scald half of the cream with the sugar, cool and add the flavoring and the re- 
maining cream and freeze. If fruits are to be used, mash and add after the 
cream is frozen. 

Ices of all kinds should be frozen slowly. In making sherbets turn the 
freezer very rapidly and a meringue of the white of one egg and one table- 
spoonful of sugar may be added after it is frozen.

sections of oranges and a spoonful of whipped cream and fruit over the top 

makes a desirable change.

BEVERAGES. 

(Including Coffee, Tea, Chocolate, Cocoa, Lemonades, Ginger Ale, Fruit 
Syrups, Punch and Home-Made Wines.) 



" Simple living and high thinking have the approval of learned men and women." 

Tea, coffee, chocolate or cocoa are the beverages most indulged in, in the 
average home, but a few additions have been made under this heading. Water 
is presumably the true beverage ; but with all the numerous " Waters " to 
drink, one is not quite sure whether they have the right one, and if they have 
one are not quite sure but they should have chosen the other. But good 



BEVERAGES. 81 

water we must drink, and plenty of it, if we wish to keep in a good healthy 
condition. 

Tea and coffee should be taken in moderation and coffee must always 
be of the best, and made most carefully. Never allow the coffee to be pul- 
verized as that means " burnt " (through grinding) coffee, but finely ground, 
and for large quantities one-half pound to four quarts of water. . 

A cup of chocolate or cocoa well made is a wholesome food. Always 
make in a double boiler, and it requires cooking. Not actively boiling, but 
with the steady water heat underneath ^ould be cooked sufficiently to take 
away that " raw taste " so often found in a cup of chocolate in public places. 

Tea is usually poor, not only on account of the indifference with which 
people usually buy this article, but the greater indifference with which it is 
made. As with coffee, the water should be freshly boiled and when possible 
use a tea ball or strainer; then by dipping up and down you can have just the 
desired strength. But this is not always convenient, so use a hot earthen pot 
and boiling water, let stand two or three minutes and with a good tea the in- 
fusion is delicate and not unwholesome when taken in moderation.

Recipe 1. HOW TO MAKE COFFEE. 

Materials. Measure. DIRECTIONS. 

Coffee 4 Tablespoonfuls 

White of^ Egg 1 Tablespoonful A great deal both of interest and i.n- 

Boiling Water ... .. 3 * Cups formation might be written about cof- 

fee, but it is not wise to take it up here. 
UTENSILS- Always buy the best coffee that can 

,,_,„* be bought, and that does not always 

ffieyo"or^'^' ''^fesulg Cup • -ean the highest priced. Inform your- 

self so as to know good coffee. Do not 

always blame the grocer if your coffee 

is poor; sometimes the poor coffee is 
the result of a not perfectly clean coffee pot. Once a week put a teaspoon- 
ful of baking soda into the pot, partly fill it with water and boil for at least 
ten minutes. Then wash thoroughly and you will find it sweet and clean. 
So there are three necessaries for good coffee, first an enamel or granite pot 
kept perfectly clean, or buy a cheaper coffee pot (not tin, however) and have 
a new one oftener. Second, a good blending of the best Mocha and Java 
coffee ; and third, freshly boiled water. Scald the pot, grind the coffee about 
as fine as coarse granulated sugar. Beat the egg in the cold water, add the 
coffee and mix well. Pour into the coffee pot and add one cup of boiling 
water and bring quickly to the boiling point. Now this must be done always, 
or the coffee is ruined. Set back on the stove where it will keep hot, but not 
boiling, and add the remaining two cups of boiling water. Let stand two or 
three minutes, settle with a very little cold water and serve at once.

DRIP COFFEE. 



Materials. Measure. 

Coffee 2 Tablespoonfuls 

Boiling Water 4 Cups 



DIRECTIONS. 



UTENSILS: 
Drip Coffee Pot Tablespoon 
Measuring Cup 



There are so many percolators on 
the market that one is at a loss to 
know which one to choose. Select one 
with as few separate parts as possible, 

and easy to keep clean. It, is not wise 

to choose those having washable bags. 
When you have wisely made your se- 
lection, do not take it home and set it on the shelf, but use it, as coffee made 
in this manner is for most people perfectly harmless. Put the freshly boiled 
water into the lower part of the coffee pot, and the coffee ground as 
fine as it can be ground without pulverizing it, into the upper section. Put 
on the cover and place over the fire. In from five to eight minutes you will 
have a most delicious coffee. Tea can be made in the same manner. These 
drip coffee pots or percolators can be purchased to have the coffee made in 
the kitchen or with alcohol lamps for table use.

Recipe 5. GINGER ALE. 

Ginger ale is the foundation of many agreeable drinks and fiuit punches, 
since almost all fruits and flavors seem to harmonize well with th- ginger and 
lemon of which it is made. In two gallons of water dissolve three pounds of 
granulated sugar, and add the beaten whites of three eggs and two ounces of 
ground ginger, previously dissolved in water. Let the mixture come to a 
boil, skim and set aside to cool. Now add the juice of four large lemons, one- 
fourth a yeast cake (compressed) previously dissolved in a little water, and 
stir the mixture thoroughly. Let stand for a few minutes, and then strain 
through a cheese cloth bag, and pour into bottles. Set away in a cool dark 
place, and in forty-eight hours, the ginger ale will be ready to drink. An 
acid flavor may be given to this ale by squeezing the juice of half a lemon 
into a tumbler, and then filling the glass with the ale. 



Recipe 6. FRUIT SYRUPS. 

For a change in punches try rhubarb, raspberry, currant, pineapple, or 
strawberry-ade. These, as also lemonade, are better if sugar syrup rather 
than crude sugar be used for sweetening, but on no account should the 
fruit juice be cooked. Add this when the syrup has become cold. A little 
lemon juice to give " point " to the particular fruit flavor that is used is essen- 
tial in all beverages of this class. 

Remember to use the sweet element sparingly even if the beverage is to 
be used half frozen ; for sugar is a fuel food and in consequence is not " in 
order " during the heated term. Half a cup of sugar is enough for un- 
frozen mixtures; two-thirds of a Cup may be required when the beverage 
is to be frozen. But, while stinting on the sugar be generous with 
the fruit juice, and if the quantity at hand of one variey be scanty, add the 
juice of some other fruit and call the concoction a punch.

cool fill bottles which have been rinsed with alcohol. Use bottles with 
patent stoppers. This syrup will keep well the entire year, but should be 
made in the spring when lemons are cheap and plentiful. Oranges may be 
used in the same manner as above, using two quarts of juice and the same 
ingredients. Pineapples, cherries, grapes, currants, raspberries and straw- 
berries all make syrups which make delicious drinks, sauces, and ice creams 
when these fruits are out of season. Be careful of too much boiling as it 
destroys the flavor and color of the syrup. Use only granite or porcelain 
lined kettles and stir with wooden spoon.

CHAFING DISH COOKERY. 

(Including Rarebits, Creamed Oysters, Etc.) 



" The social meal in the home is an ideal preparation for good digestion." 

While the chafing dish started the fashion, it has quickly grown to 
be one of the very best of friends. There are many homes where you find it, 
and nowhere is it more serviceable or welcome than at the Sunday night 
supper. 

All who possess this most useful dish are on the lookout for new exploits 
in the chafing dish line. Always making fresh and astonishing creations. In 
the recipes here given they may represent to many merely old friends with 
new faces, or new names, or perhaps the old dress with additional frills, which 
add not only to the attractiveness of the dish but the taste as well. There are 
few, things that cannot be done in the chafing dish if one knows how. The 
greatest aid to successful results is having everything in readiness for work. 
Arrange all material conveniently on either side of dish ; milk and cream and 
all liquids, in fact, in attractive pitchers. Butter molded in balls measuring 
one tablespoonful. Matches in a little tray, etc. Chafing dish on a tray. ^ 
Teaspoon and tablespoon for measuring and all seasonings arranged on a ' 
small tray. It is not necessary to tell how these things should be arranged,

but neatly and in order and perfectly convenient. Give thought and care to 
this as it saves time and confusion. 

See that the lamp is in perfect working order and filled. 

If all the preparations are carefully made, each or any dish will be 
quickly and easily cooked. 

For a quick breakfast and where you do not have access to gas, its worth 
cannot be estimated. The chafing dish has come to stay.

THE CANNING OF FRUITS AND VEGETABLES. 

(Including Both Large and Small Fruity, Pineapples, Asparagus, Beans, 
Beets, Tomatoes and Green Corn.) 



" Practice makes perfect." 

It is not difficult to can all kinds of fruits and vegetables if one studies 
sterilization, has perfect utensils and knows how to select fruits. The slight- 



THE CANNING OF FRUITS AND VEGETABLES. 91 

est disregard of necessary rules in the canning or preservation of fruits may- 
cause great loss, not only of time and strength, but money as well. 

The following rules have been used many times with perfect success. 
If you fail it is because you have not followed the suggestions given. 

All fruits and vegetables to be perfect should be canned the day they 
are picked. If this is not possible, when purchased at the stores, come as close 
to freshness as you possibly can. 

They must be ripe, not bruised, and free from decay. 

They must be cooked in the cans or jars in which they are to be kept; 
<tnd the best process known is canning by steam. Cans or jars and covers (and 
rubbers if you use them) should be perfect. Use new rubbers every year. 
Use jars with covers which are absolutely unaffected by any known food acid, 
and sweet and clean as the glass itself. 

The jars must be sterilized by placing in the cooker and gradually bring 
water to the boiling point, and boil for ten minutes. Covers should be dipped 
in boiling water and not handled on the inside after this sterilizing. 

The contents of every jar must be sterile; that is, sufficiently boiled to 
destroy all the germ life in it; otherwise they will surely spoil, and one germ 
will spoil the entire contents. Dififerent fruits and vegetables require differ- 
ent time for cooking, as some germs are tougher and longer lived than others. 

Fewer utensils are necessary with the steam cooker than any other 
method of canning, and these should also be sterilized to insure perfect suc- 
cess.

in the cooker and steam five minutes. If the jars are not quite full, fill from 
one jar then return them to the cooker and steam_ five minutes longer. Seal 
tightly, stand aside until cool. Then tighten again. 

In canning strawberries, place them in a colander and dip them up and 
down two or three tin;es in cold water to remove any sand or dirt. Drain 
and stem them. Make your syrup, using water in place of currant juice. 
Fill the jars full of berries and place in the cooker. Steam for ten minutes.

CORN. 



Materials. 


Measure. 


Corn 




UTENSILS: 


Steam Cooker 


Large Kettle 


Tablespoon 


Holders 


Wide Mouthed 


Towels 


Funnel 





DIRECTIONS. 

After removing the husks and 
every particle of silk from perfectly 
fresh corn, cut it from the cob, pack 
it in sterilized jars, press down well 
and fill them. Put these jars into the 
steam cooker and steam for two hours. 
If the corn shrinks fill three jars from 
the fourth and put them back into the 
cooker and steam one hour longer. Seal carefully as directed for peas, as 
corn is one of the hardest vegetables td can. Watch carefully for three or 
four days, and if there is the slightest sign of fermentation, remove the lids, 
put them back into the cooker and steam thirty minutes again. 

(Some, who do not have a steam cooker, set the jars in boiling water.)

Stew Pan Wooden Spoon silver knife for this purpose. 

Fill the copper pan of the steam 

cooker with cold water, set the jars 
inside the cooker, put over the fire, bring the water to the boiling point and 
boil ten minutes. This is absolutely necessary for sterilization of the jars. 
In the meantime add the juice from the pineapple to the water and sugar, 
put this into the stew pan over the fire, stir until sugar is dissolved. Boil 
five minutes and skim. Remove one jar at a time from the cooker, fill with 
the pineapple and then to overflowing with the boiling syrup. Put those 
filled into the cooker, lay the cover on top, which has been dipped for a second 
time in boiling water, and steam fifteen minutes. Now remove each jar, 
lift off the cover and place again in boiling water while you fill the jar to 
overflowing with the remaining boiling syrup. Replace the cover quickly, 
sealing tight, and stand aside to cool. The next morning and for nearly a 
week, watch your fruit carefully to see if it is going to keep. The contents 
of every jar must be sterile (dead), one germ on the cover, in the jar or 
fruit will spoil the entire contents. 



PRESERVING AND JELLY MAKING. 

(Including Jams and Fruit Juices.) 



" There is every kind of berry in my pail, 
I wanted blue ones only, 
But on this fruitful road I could not fail 
To find all kinds of berries in my pail." 

In preserving, canning or jelly making, iron or tin utensils should never 
be used. The fruit acids attack these metals and give both bad color and 
taste to the fruit. 

The kettle should be broad rather than deep, and this may be procelain 
lined, enameled or aluminum. As in any other work, the proper tools or 
utensils are necessary for the best results in canning, preserving and jelly 
making, such as preserving kettle, steam cooker or large kettle, skimmer, 
colander, wire sieve, wooden spoon, measuring cup, sauce pan, scales for large 
fruits if possible, wooden masher, cheese cloth jelly bag and plenty of clean 
cloth or towels. The regular kitchen pans hold the fruit and sugar. 

When the fruit is purchased, keep it where it will keep cool and free 
from dust or flies until ready to use. System will do much to lighten the 
work. Have the kitchen swept and dusted thoroughly with a damp cloth 
to keep down all dust and thus have less danger in keeping the fruit. 

Have a kettle ready for sterilizing the jars and all necessary utensils and 
sugar at hand. Then with a moderate amount of fruit to put up at one time 
the work should be a pleasure. 

To each quart of large fruit one pint of syrup is necessary for can- 
ning. Two-thirds of a pint of syrup for a quart of the small fruits. One pint 
of sugar and the same of water put over the fire, stir until the sugar is dis- 
solved, bring slowly to the boiling point and boil five minutes or longer if 
desired richer. This makes a good syrup for all canned acid fruits. 

A light syrup may be made from one pint of sugar and two pints of water 
boiled t€n minutes for canning blueberries, and proceed precisely the same 
as for canning raspberries, cherries and currants. 

Fruit syrups and fruit juices are two most desirable ways for the preser- 
vation of fruit, and are most desirable for delicious drinks, sauces, ices and 
ice cream. Pineapples, cherries, grapes, currants, oranges, lemons, raspberries 
and strawberries may all be used for this purpose. Be careful of too much 
boiling, as it destroys the color and flavor of the fruit juices or when made 
into syrup. It keeps well the entire year and should be made when fruits 
are seasonable and reasonable in price. 

One recipe will answer for all fruit juices. They may be bottled with or 
without sugar. Currant juice may be sterilized and canned without sugar, 
making the jelly at any season of the year. 

Use self-sealing bottles instead of cans. 

The amount of sugar, when used for grape juice, cherries and plums is 
one-half pint to each quart of juice. Currants will require one pint of sugar 
to a quart of juice. I will give the recipe for Grape Juice and this will answer 
for all the given fruits as directed.

Recipe 1. GRAPE JUICE. 

, Wash the grapes and, pick them from the stems. Put them into a pre- 
serving kettle — porcelain lined — crush a little, adding just enough water to 
prevent them from sticking. Cover and heat slowly until the grapes are soft 
and the juices well out. Turn into a double cheese cloth bag and drain over 
night. The next morning sterilize the bottles. Return the juice to the clean 
preserving kettle over the fire. Let come to a boil and skim. Repeat. Add 
the sugar and stir until dissolved. Let come to the boiling point, skim and 
rinse the bottles with a little alcohol, fill them and cork. Put them into the 
steamer or a kettle of hot water and boil them thirty minutes. Place on a 
wire cooler away from the draft to cool. 

The only difiference between the syrups and juices is that in the syrup 
more sugar is used.

Do not stem them but mash well. 
Place over the fire until heated and the 
juices well started. Put into the jelly 
bag and drain over night. The next 
morning, wash and put the glasses into 
the kettle with cold water and bring 
slowly to the boiling point ready for use. Measure the juice and for each 
pint or quart of juice an equal amount of sugar. Measure the juice into 
the kettle, put over the fire, bring to the boiling point and boil it twenty 
minutes, skimming often. After the juice has been boiling for about ten 
minutes, measure the sugar into a pan, place in a moderate oven and heat, 
being careful not to melt it. 

When the juice has cooked the required time, add the sugar, stir until 
all is dissolved. If your fruit was not over-ripe and your work carefully done, 
the jelly will be ready to strain at once into glasses ; if not, it must be cooked 
longer. Set in the sunshine to finish. Cover with melted paraffine, label 
and set away in a dark, cool closet. Grapes, raspberries and blackberries

are made in the same manner. A mixture of fruit juices always makes a 
pleasant variety. 

For red raspberry jelly add one-third currant juice. For crab-apple 
jelly the addition of wild pliini juice improves the flavor, or a stick of cin- 
namon, or even the native grape juice. Under-ripe grapes make an espe- 
cially attractive jelly. Black raspberry and crab-apple, and grape and crab- 
apple make a nice combination.

PICKLING. 

(Including Watermelon, Peach, Pear, Tomato, Cucumber and Oiled Pickles 
and Chow Chow, Chili Sauce and Relishes.) 



" Prove all things ; hold fast that which is good." 

(All measurements level.) 

'§weet pickles are made from all fruits that can be preserved such as 
citron, watefrnelpn rindj crab-apples, peaches, pears, cucumbers and many 
others. 

-Spiced fruits frqm currants and gooseberries are delicious with cold 
meats. 

Good cider vinegar only should be used for pickling, brown or white 
sugar an4 the very best gpipes which can be bought. The housekeeper has 
every opppftunity now ijnder the Pure Food Law of knowing whether she has 
genuine spices or ground leaves. There is, or has been, so much adulteration 
in spices that I makp this appeal to housekeepers to not buy cheap, inferior 
spices. The success of pickHng where spices are used depends mainly upop 
their purity and flavor. 

The syrup for the sweet pickles should be rich and thick and sufficiently 
cooked to keep without being sealed. 

Do not use preservatives or coloring matter of any kind. Do your pick- 
ling carefully,, not too much at once. Have variety rather than quantity, then 
there will be no failures.

really takes only a few minutes each day. 

For pickling peaches use a fine freestone and prepare as for canning, 
except do not cut in halves. Pears are cut in halves.

" Simple diet is best for many dishes bring many diseases. •' 

The recipes in this department have been gathered from many parts of 
the world and have all been carefully corrected and arranged with the view 
of making them the favorite re.cjpes for every-d^y use jn the hprne. Thpugh 
the work is complete and covers every subject, yet special attention has 
been given to the simple and inexpensive dishes. ^This dPP^rtriient will be 
found thoroughly practical and entirely different from all Qt}ier cpok books. 
The aim has been to give full and complete directions with each subject, not 
only that the experienced cook may use it ^s a guide, but g.lso that th/e young 
and inexperienced housewife can make a practical use of the book.

Bread, Qatmeal Bread, Brown Bread, Giraham Bread, Corn Bread, Currant 
Bread, Cprni^Ji Bread, Salf Rising Bread, gingerbread. Etc. Also Recipes

" Giye us this day pur daily bread." 

" In bread making, as in baseball, there is nothing like a good batter in the 

hour of knead." 

As " bread is the staff of life," it is irapprtant that every housewife be 
^yell skilled in the art of making good bread. Spongy sweet bread, light 
crisp rolls or flaky biscuits make the plainest meal appetizing while the most 
luxurious dinner is a failure without them. Indeed the health and comfort 
of the family is often determined by the quality of the home made loaves and 
it is an old saying that the way to a man's heart is through his stomach. 
Then why should not every young woman learn this art? There is' no 
greater accomplishment. In bread making three things are important — good 
flour, good yeast and good care. 

FLOUR. 

Thjsre is no accurate rule by which the grade of flour can be determined 
by examination and it is well to stick py some tried brand which has been 
used with success. A brand which is liked by ope will be a failure in the 

103 



106 THE PEOPLE'S HOME RECIPE BOOK. 

bands of another. Good flour has a cream-white tint and one should never 
buy that which has a blue-white tinge. Poor flour often has a dingy appear- 
ance as though mixed with ashes, is not adhesive, and may be blown about 
easily. Good flour will adhere to the hand when pressed and will show the 
imprint of the lines of tho skin. Flour should always be thoroughly sifted. 
A single speck of mold will often spoil the bread. Flour should be bought in 
small quantities, kept dry, cool, and beyond the reach of rats, mice and insects. 
The small moth does much damage. Remember that all kinds of flour and 
meal, except buckwheat and graham, need sifting. It is well to nave a paiJ 
with a tight-fitting cover in which to keep flour after sifting until it is needed 

YEAST. 

After flour, the yeast is the most essential element in bread. Most people' 
prefer yeast bread but there are some who prefer " salt-rising " bread. Many 
of the dry hop yeasts are good if available. Many use baker%' yeast and buy 
just what they need each baking. There are two advantages in using potato 
yeast — bread made from it will not dry out so quickly and there is not the 
danger that too much will spoil the flavor of the bread. 

THE SPONGE. 

Sponge is made from warm water or milk, yeast and flour. Some add 
mashed potatoes. A pint of water or milk should be used for each quart of 
sifted flour. The milk or water (wetting) should be at blood heat. If milk 
is used it should be new and first scalded to prevent souring, then cooled to 
blood heat. The bread will be coarse if the " wetting " is too hot. When 
water is used, the addition of a tablespoonful of either butter or lard will 
make the bread more -tender. Bread made from water will keep longer and 
has more of the sweet taste of the wheat than that made from milk but is not 
so tender and nutritious. When mixed with milk it requires more flour and 
more kneading. In the summer the sponge should not be set before eight or 
nine o'clock in the evening. The sponge may be made with cold water in hot 
weather. In winter the batter should be mixed with water or milk at blood 
heat. Test it with the finger and make it as warm as can be borne; stir 
in the flour which will cool it enough for the yeast; cover it closely with 
several layers of blanket (it is best to have it in a large jar or crock) and place 
in a warm and even temperature. For four ordinary sized loaves, three pints 
of wetting and a teacup of yeast will generally make enough sponge. In 
making sponge, the yeast should always be added last and the sponge should 
not be hot enough to scald. The temperature for rising should he eighty 
or ninety degrees. A more uniform heat can be maintained in a crock or 
stone jar than in tin, hence sponge should never be set in tin. 

MIXING AND KNEADING. 

Early the next morning measure and sift the flour and if the weather is 
cold both the flour and the sponge should be warmed. A large tin dish pan 
with a tight fitting cover is excellent for mixing dough. It should be scalded 
each time it is used. Put the flour into it and for four loaves add two level 
teaspoonfuls of salt. Mix well but be careful not to get the dough too stiff, 
then turn out on the bread board ; knead without stopping until the dough 
sticks to neither the hands nor the board. This will require from forty-five 



BREAD MAKING. 107 

minutes to an hour. All flour to be used should be put in at the first molding 
and it should be kneaded the longest at this time. Use just as little flour as 
necessary to prevent sticking and remember that any pause in the kneading 
will injure the bread. There are different ways of kneading and no precise 
directions can be given. Experience is the best guide. When through with 
the kneading, form the dough into a large loaf and again place it in the bread 
pan which has been sprinkled with flour. Either sprinkle the loaf with flour 
or grease it over with salted butter or lard, cover it closely and set in a warm 
place for from one to two hours, or until it rises to twice its original size ; then 
knead down in the pan, but bread should be kneaded but little at the second 
molding. Form into loaves and put each into a well greased baking pan, 
grease the tops of the loaves with salted butter or lard and set to rise. The 
loaves should be molded perfectly smooth with no lumps or flour adhering to 
the sides. The loaves should rise in the pans for from fifteen minutes to an 
hour, much depending upon the temperature. Before it is entirely through 
rising or when it has risen enough to seam or crack it should be placed in the 
oven. Bread should ferment but twice as the third fermentation spoils it. 
This may be remedied by adding a teaspoonful of soda for each four quarts of 
flour but the bread will not be so good nor so healthful. Salt should always 
be added to bread and biscuit but never salt sponge. A small quantity of 
white sugar improves bread dough, providing the yeast is doubtful. Bread 
should be mixed as soft as it can be handled but if " new process " flour 
made from spring wheat is used the dough must be much harder than when 
winter wheat is used. Try to get the loaves into the pans for the last rising 
rather soft. Pans with high sides are the best for they keep the bread from 
spreading apart or running over the sides. 

To have good baking powder biscuit the dough must be kept so soft that 
you can just get it into the pan. They must be baked quickly in a very hot 
oven. Never roll the dough thinner than an inch. 

BAKING. 

A moderate, uniform heat is very necessary in baking bread. If the heat 
is too great a hard_ crust is quickly formed before the bread has expanded 
sufficiently and it will be heavy. If the bare hand and arm can be held in the 
oven not longer than enough to count twenty moderately, it is hot enough. 
Or, it may be tested by placing a small quantity of flour in the center of the 
oven on an old piece of crockery ; if it browns in one minute the heat is right. 

To tell when the bread is done break the loaves apart and press gently 
with the finger ; if elastic, it is done, but if clammy, it needs to be returned to 
the oven. Or the loaves may be tested with a broom splint. If nothing ad- 
heres when it is withdrawn the bread is done. It generally takes from forty- 
five minutes to an hour for the baking. As soon as removed from the oven 
the loaves should be taken from the pans and the entire outside greased with 
melted butter. They should then be tilted on edge to allow a free circulation 
of air, though some have success by wrapping the bread with cloth as soon as 
it is taken from the oven. Do not place warm bread next to wood or it will 
have a bad taste. Lay a cloth upon the table and put the bread on that. Pans 
should be greased very lightly for bread. If the bread is baked too hard wrap 
it in a wet towel and cover with another dry towel. 

Remember that yeast must never be used if sour ; the temperature where 



lOS THE PEOPLE'S HOME REClPE BOOK. 

the bread is set to rise must hot be hot enough tb scald ; and the temperatttre 
of the Overt must be moderate and uniform. 

Heat the btead knife and ydU will preverit crumbling in cutting warm 
bread.

CAKE MAKING. 

(Including Recipes and Directions for Making All Kinds of Cakes, Frostings, 

Icings and Fillings.) 

Aye, to the leavening, but here's yet in the word hereafter the kneading, the making 
of the cake, the heating of the oven, and the baking. Nay, you must stay the cooling, 
too, or you may chance to burn your mouth. — Shakespeare. 

GENERAL DIRECTIONS. 

©nly the best of materials should be used for cake. The pans for baking 
should be perfectly clean and free frt»m odor and should not be used for any 
other purpose. 

The butter should not be <aily but just soft enough to cream well with 
sugar. In making white cake do not use colored butter for the coloring matter 
will not disappear like the natural color does. If there is too much salt in 
the butter it should be freshened by working it in cool water. Use only the 
very best. 

The sugar should generally be either powdered sugar or " coffee A." 
If granulated sugar is used it should be very fine. Use pulverized sugar for 
delicate cakes; coflfee-crushed, powdered and sifted for rich cakes; the best 
brown sugars for dark cakes ; granulated and " coffee A " for fruit cakes and 
jelly cakes. 



130 THE PEOPLE'S HOME RECIPE BOOK. 

The eggs should be fresh and cold to beg.t well. In summer cool theiti 
on ice or in cold water. Mariy of our best cooks think they get better results 
by whipping with a fork or wire spoon than with a beater. Always beat the 
eggs in an earthen vessel and never in tin ; a pinch of salt ,ad4ed makes them 
come to a froth quicker. The whites and yolks should be beaten separately. 

Most cooks grease the cake pans with fresh lard. If Jautter is used it 
should not be too salty or the cake will stick. Cover the bottorns of the 
pans with white or manilla paper. As soon as taken from the oven set the 
pan upon a cloth wrung out of water for two or three minutes and the cake 
will not stick when being taken from the pan. 

Always cream the butter and sugar first, then add the yolks of eggs, milk, 
and lastly the flour ai^d whites of eggs. 

In mixing cake, dp not stir, but be^t it thoroughly, unless otherwise di- 
rected, bringii^g the batter up from the bottopi of the dish with every stroke. 
Use a long handled wooden spoon. An iron spoon turns the mixture black. 
Never beat a cake in tin but use earthen or stone ware. 

Rernember that sour milk and soda go together; and sweet milk and 
baking powder go together ; and that baking powder combines the properties 
of soda and cream of tartar and is always used alone. 

To one quart of flour use 3% teaspopnfuls of baking powder. 

To one quart of flour use 1 teaspoonful of soda and 3 teaspoonfuls of 
cream of tartar. 

Whpn molasses is used thp cake should always be baked }n a mo4erate ' 
oven for the molasses makes it burn easily. 

In cake making do not try to economize too much in materials as a cake 
is often spoiled by some petty economy. 

It is a bad thing to disturb a cake or even open the oven door for the first 
ten minutes while baking or until the cake is " set," but if it is baking unevenly 
it should be turned very gently, keeping the oven door open as short a time 
as possible. Outside air affects tl^e baking and will make the cake fall. 

Test with a broom splint or knitting needle. When the cake is done 
none of the mixture will adhere. 

If the oven bakes too fast on the bottorn, place the grate under the cake ; 
if too hot on the top, set a pie pan of water on the top grate. 

For baking sponge or pound cake, the oven should be hot enough to turn 
a piece of white paper a riclj yellpw in 5 najnutes. For cookies, layer cakes 
or cup cakes, the paper should turn a dark brown in 5 minutes. For baking 
bread, throw a little flour on the bottoip of thp oven and if it browns quickly 
without taking fire the heat is suffipient. For b^kjng puff paste; the heat 
should be greatest first and decrease later. This is to keep the paste in shape. 
When the oven is too hot the temperature may be reduced by placing a pan 
of cold -vyater in it. After a cake is in, should tjie oven be found too hot so 
that the cake jjrowns almost immediately, lift a lid off the stove and cover 
the cake with a buttered paper. The cake ViH not be as nice as if it were 
not browned so quickly bi;t this is all yqu can do. 

Sprinkle a little flour over the top of a cake to prevent the icing from 
running off. Pour on a small quantity of icing, spread jt over the cake with 
a brocld knife, which dip frequently in hot water to keep if from stic)<jing. 
Never try to ice a cake while hpt, and let layer cakes get nearly cold before 
putting together. 

Gingerbread should be baked with a moderate fire as it is easily ^uriie.d* 



CAKE MAKING. 121 

Put only a little bf the dough on the board at once in making cookies. 
It is more easily managed in this way. ' Cookies must bfe gotten into thfe pans 
as soft as possible. 

The fire should be fixed, the patis greased and everything in readiness 
before the cake is mixed if baking powder is used for it effervesces but once 
and there shotild be no delay in baking. The Cake should rise in the oven 
atid not the mixing bowl. 

Bread and cake pails made of sheet iron are better than those made of tin.

Some hae meat and carina eat, 
And some would eat that want it; 
But we hae meat, and we can eat, 
Sae let the Lord be thankit.

HOW TO SELECT GOOD MEAT AND POULTRY. 

Beef. — Good beef is elastic so that if it be pressed with the finger no 
impression will remain. If the meat be in poor condition the lean part will 
usually be of a dark color and inelastic. 

Mutton. — The lean part of good mutton is of a dark, bright crirason 
red ; the fat is firm and white. The iean part of bad mutton is of a brownish 
Cdior with a bad smell; there is little fat and it is flabby and y^owish.

130 THE PEOPLE'S HOME RECIPE BOOK. 

Pork. — ^The fat part of pork should be firm and white ; the lean should . 
be of a fine grain; and the skin cool and thin. Should the fat contain ker- 
nels the pork should be avoided for the pig was diseased when killed. Pork 
should not be kept more than a day or two before it is cooked for it will not 
keep long without salting. Great care should be exercised that pork be 
thoroughly cooked or there will be danger of disease. 

Veal. — Veal will spoil quickly and should not be kept more than two 
days in summer nor four in winter. 

Turkeys. — A young cock-turkey has smooth, black legs with short 
spurs. Sometimes dealers cut and scrape the spurs of old turkeys so as to 
deceive one, hence they should be carefully examined. The beak of an old 
turkey is hard while that of a young bird is somewhat soft. The legs of 
an old hen-turkey are red and rough. If the turkey is in poor condition 
the eyes will be dim and sunken and the feet dry and stifif, while if it be tn 
good condition the eyes will be bright and full and the feet soft and pliable. 

Fowls. — Select a fat fowl for any purpose. The skin should be trans- 
parent and if the bird is young and tender the skin under the wing or leg may 
be easily torn. A young cock will have short spurs. A fine bird will have 
a full fat breast and a smooth comb. 

Ducks. — If the duck has been recently killed the feet and legs will be 
soft and pliable but if it be stale they will be dry and 'stifif. Freshness of 
the eyes is a good indication. An old duck will generally be thin and lean 
while a young bird is generally plump. The tame duck has rather large feet 
that are of a dusky yellow while the feet of the wild duck are smaller and 
of a reddish color. 

Geese. — ^The feet and beak of an old goose will generally be red and 
bristly, while those of a young goose will be yellow with few bristles. When 
stale the feet and legs are dry and stiff ; when fresh they are pliable and soft. 
The breast of a young bird, as with all poultry in good condition, is plump 
and the flesh whiter than that of old birds; 

A FEW SUGGESTIONS CONCERNING THE COOKING OF MEATS 

AND POULTRY. 

Salt meats and meats used for soup should be put to cook in cold water ; 
but otherwise, fresh meat should be put on in boiling water. Cold water 
extracts the juice while hot water quickly cooks the outer surface of the 
meat and so retains the juices. Put a piece of red pepper in the water to 
prevent the odor which arises from boiling meat and turn the meat fre- 
, quently that it may cook evenly on all sides. Carefully remove all scum as 
it arises. The meat should be kept boiling constantly but very gently. 
Allow twenty minutes for each pound of meat. 

When roasting meat in the oven it should be frequently basted, that 
is, the juices should be dipped and poured over it with a spoon. Keep the 
fire at a uniform heat. 

In broiling, have the gridiron hot before putting on the meat. Turn 
it over as soon as it sears. 

Do not salt meat until it is nearly done as salt extracts the juices. The 
juices of meat are also extracted by allowing them to remain wrapped in 
paper when purchased. The meat should be immediately unwrapped. 

In cooking an old fowl or a tough piece of meat, add a pinch of soda or 



MEATS, POULTRY, GAME, ETC. 131 

a spoonful of vinegar to the water in which they are boiled to aid in making 
them tender. 

Frozen meats should be laid in cold water te thaw out shortly before 
using. 

When roasting meat, use either tripods or clean pieces of wood to keep 
it out of the juices. Keep a pan of water in the oven to prevent scorching. 

In warm weather mutton, veal and pork may be kept fresh for several 
weeks by laying them in sour milk. The meat should be entirely covered 
and the milk changed when mould appears. Wash the meat in cold water 
before using. 

Salt pork may be freshened by soaking it over night in sweet milk and 
water. 

A nice gravy is made by adding the meat gravy to some flour and butter 
which have been rubbed together and browned in the skillet. 

The garnishes for meat are slices of lemon, parsley, sliced beets, sliced 
carrots and currant jelly,,

FISH AND OYSTERS. 

"Master, I marvel how the fishes live in the sea!' 

" Why as men do on land ; the great ones eat up the little ones.'' 

— Pericles. 

"Drenched in the sea, hold, notwithstanding, their freshness." — Tempest. 

" Fruit of the wave ! O, dainty and delicious ! 
Food for the gods ! Ambrosia for Apicius ! 
Worthy to thrill the soul of sea-born Venus, 
Or titillate the palate of Silenus ! " 

In selecting fish see that the eyes are full and not dull and sunken. The 
flesh should be firm and hard to the touch and should rise at once to the pres- 
sure of the finger. 

The earthy or muddy taste may be removed by soaking in salt water 
shortly before using. The skin may be readily removed by pouring boil- 
ing water over it and letting it stand a few minutes. Lemon juice whitens 
fish. 

Fish should be cooked the day they are bought. Fresh mackerel, espe- 
cially, spoil very quickly. 

In frying fish, put it into very hot lard and turn as soon as browned on one 
side. When browned on both sides move the skillet to the back part of the 
stove, cover and let cook slowly. Use plenty of lard but no butter. 

Garnishes are parsley, sliced beets, lemon, lettuce and hard-boiled eggs.

SOUPS. 

(Including Soup Stocks, Bouillon and Broths.) 



" Let onion atoms lurk within the bowl, 
And, half suspected, animate the whole." 

— Sidney Smith. 

Always use cold water in making soups as the juices of the meat are 
thus extracted, while if the meat is put into hot water the outer part is 
quickly seared and the juices retained. Use a quart of water to a pound of 
meat and allow a quart of soup for three or four persons. It is very necessary 
that the soup be thoroughly skimmed and all grease should be removed. 
Long and slow simmering is necessary to get all the strength from the meat. 

There are two kinds of soup or stock — white and brown. The white 
is made from either veal or fowls while the brown is made from beef. 

In making vegetable soups cook the vegetables separately and add to 
the soup just before taking from the fire. Celery seed will be found an ex- 
cellent substitute for celery. The best herbs for seasoning soups are sage, mint, 
tarragon, sweet marJ9ram, thyme, sweet basil, bay leaves, parsley, cloves, 
mace, celery and onions. 

Scorched flour or burnt sugar are used to color soups. Season lightly 
at first for more may be added if desired. 

Never put soups or gravies in tin or copper and it is best to use a wooden 
spoon. 

1. Asparagus Soup. — Take a can of asparagus, 1 pint of cream or milk, 
1 pint of white stock, 1 tablespoonful of chopped onion, 3 tablespoonfuls of 
butter, 2 talblespoonfuls of flour, 1 teaspoonful sugar and % teaspoonful pep- 
per. Cut off and lay aside the heads of asparagus, cut stalks into short pieces 
and put them on to boil in a stew pan with the stock. Put onion and butter- 
in a small frying pan and cook slowly for ten minutes, then add flour; stir 
until mixture is smooth and frothy, but not brown. Add this, together with 
the sugar, pepper and salt, to the stock and asparagus and simmer for 15 
minutes; then rub the soup through a sieve and return it to the stew pan. 
Add cream and asparagus heads and after boiling tip once, serve without 
d^lay. In case fresh asparagus be substituted for canned, |;se two bunches. 
Cooic them in the stock or water for 30 minutes. Rerpove the heads for 
later use and proceed with the cooking the same- as when canned asparagus 
is used. 

%. Bean Soup. — Boil 1 quart of beans until soft, rub through a colander 
to remove hulls. Return soup to the fire, season well with pepper and salt, 
and add a few spopnfuls of cream; serve with srnall squares of toast. Some 
prefer corn bread with bean soup. If desired a small piece of bacon may 
be boiled with the beans as it adds richness and flavor to the soup.

EGGS. 

Including Various Ways of Cooking Eggs and Making Omelets. 



" New laid eggs whose praise 
Is sung by pullets with 
Their morning lays." 

— Saxe. 

The fresher eggs are, the better and more wholesome they will be. 
Eggs over a week old may be fried but should not be boiled. To tell good 
from bad eggs they should be put into water. The good ones will lay 
on their side while those that turn with the large end upward are bad and 
should be rejected. 

When eggs are plenty and cheap they may be preserved for future use 
by packing in salt, being careful not to allow them to touch. It seems 
to be a disputed question whether the large or small ends should be put 
down. To keep eggs for one's own use they may be dipped in melted 
wax or in flax seed oil or rubbed with lard, then packed in oats or bran. 

The eggs of ducks and geese are too coarse to be eaten alone, though 
they are frequently used in cooking. 

In breaking eggs they should be broken separately over a cup, to be 
sure they are perfect. The shells, washed, may be saved for settling coffee. 

In poaching eggs the hot water should be salted and if a little vinegar 
is added it will aid in setting the whites. 

Three minutes will boil an egg soft; five minutes will cook the white 
hard but not the yolk; eight to ten minutes will cook it hard clear through; 



EGGS. 143 

ten to fifteen minutes will cook it hard enough to slice or to serve with 
salads. 

While boiling an egg eight or ten minutes renders it tough and harder 
to digest, if it be boiled for half an hour it will become tender and mealy 
and will be more easily digested than either raw or soft boiled eggs. When 
boiled for half an hour eggs may often be eaten by sick people when they 
cannot eat them if prepared in any other way. For this reason many doctors 
now recommend them for convalescents. 

It has been claimed that eggs may be served in nearly six hundred differ- 
ent ways. However this may be, they form one of man's principal articles 
of diet and as they are generally obtainable we will give a number of the 
simpler ways of preparing them so that the housewife may perhaps find 
several new ways to serve this nutritious food. 

1. Creamed Eggs. — Have a pan of a size that eggs cannot spread much. 
Butter it thoroughly and break eggs into it c^efully. Put small pieces of 
butter, and a tablespoonful of cream, over each egg; salt and pepper; bake 
for about five minutes to have the eggs done; to have them hard and eat 
cold, bake longer. . 

3. Egg Gems. — Mix together 1 pint of bread crumbs and 1 pint of 
chopped meat; season with pepper, salt and a little butter; moisten with a 
little milk or water; heat this mixture thoroughly; fill gem or patty pans 
with the mixture; break an egg on the top of each and bake until the eggs 
are cooked. Cold roast beef or pork that is very lean will be especially nice 
for this dish. 

3. Ox Eyes. — Cut off 3-inch pieces from a long, round loaf of bread; 
carefully cut the crust and scoop a portion out of the center of each piece; 
then place in a deep buttered dish ; for 3 pieces, beat well together two eggs 
and add a pinch of salt and % cup of milk ; baste this over the bread, adding 
more until all the liquid is absorbed ; carefully break an egg into the cavity in 
each piece and bake in a hot oven. 

4. Baked Eggs with Cheese. — Butter and place a thin piece of cheese 
in the bottom of each egg dish; then break carefully an egg into each; for 
each egg take a tablespoonful of bread crumbs and grated cheese, a dash 
of paprika and salt sprinkled over each egg ; and on top place a bit of butter 
and set in a hot oven until eggs are set; serve at once. 

5. Eggs in Tomatoes.^-Take fine tomatoes, one for each person to be 
served, and cut top off each ; scoop out the seeds and break an egg into 
each tomato; season with salt, pepper and butter; sprinkle top with bread 
crumbs and bake in hot oven. 

6. Egg Nest Toast. — Toast as many slices of bread as desired; dip 
quickly in salted water ; butter and put into a baking pan in the warming oven. 
Take as many eggs as you have slices of bread ; beat whites to a stiff froth ; 
place a spoonful on each slice of toast, making a little dent in the center 
in which place the yolk, and set all in oven to brown lightly ; be very careful 
not to break any of the yolks as they look very pretty in each nest. 

7. Deviled Eggs. — Cut open 6 hard-boiled eggs and make the filling 
of the yolks. Mash fine with fork ; add 1 teaspoonful of butter, i/^ spoonful 
of sugar, pinch of salt and pepper and mustard to taste; add enough vinegar 
to moisten, and fill the whites; a little chopped ham or lettuce or parsley 
or cheese may be added if wished. Served on lettuce leaves. 

8. Eggs a la Creole. — Butter the molds well (muffin pans will do), 



144 THE PEOPLE'S HOME RECIPE BOOK. 

scatter finely chopped parsley in the bottom and sides ; break an egg into 
each mold' and steam or bake until the white is set. Have rice thoroughly 
boiled and piled in the center of an oblong dish, with eggs arranged around 
the edge. Pour the following tomato sauce over all : Two cups strained 
tomatoes, 1 tablespoonful of onion juice, 4 whole cloves, 4 whole peppers 
and 1 tablespoonful each of parsley, cornstarch, butter and sugar; let boil 15 
minutes, then add 1 tablespoonful of capers. This is good to lock upon as 
well as to eat and the sauce is delicious on deviled fish of all kinds. 

9. Shirred Eggs. — Put 1 teaspoonful of cream into each baking cup, 
or grease gem pans and break an egg into each. Sprinkle with salt and pep- 
per and pht a small bit of butter on top when no cream is used. Bake in hot 
oven ten minutes. 

IQ. To Coddle an Egg. — Put the egg into enough boiling water to cover 
it and at once remove the water from the stove so that the egg will cook 
slowly ; leave it in the water for 7 or 8 minutes. When broken open the 
white should look like jelly. 

11. Baked Eggs. — Break eight eggs into a dish that has been well 
but|:ered; add three tablespoonfuls of cream, salt, pepper and bits of butter; 
bake in oven for about twenty minutes ; serve while very hot. 

13. Bird's Nest. — After removing the shells from some hard-boiled eggs 
surround the eg^s with forcemeat ; bake or fry them until well browned ; cut in 
halves and place in the dish with gravy. 

13. Curried Eggs. — Fry two sliced onions in butter ; add a pint of good 
stock Qj- broth and a tablespoonful of curry powder; stew till onions are 
tendei'; add a cup of cream which has been thickened with rice flour or ar- 
rowroot; simmer a few moments; add eight or ten hard-boiled eggs which 
have been cut in slices and beat them well, but do not boil. 

14. Egcalloped , Eggs. — Place a layer of bread crumbs moistened with 
meat broth or rriilk into a well-buttered dish ; slice hard-boiled eggs and dip 
each sljce in a thick drawn butter sauce to which has been added a well- 
beaten egg ; put a layer of these slices of egg upon the bread crumbs ; upon 
the layer of eggs put a thin layer of minced veal, ham or chicken ; then add 
another layer of bread, etc., finishing with dry, sifted bread crumbs; bake 
until thoroughly heated. Another way is to mix equal parts of fine bread 
crumbs and minced ham and season with pepper, salt and melted butter; 
moisten this with milk until quite soft ; butter the gem pans and fill half full 
of this mixture; then carefully break an egg upon the top of each; dust 
with pepper and salt and sprinkle finely powdered crackers over all; bake in 
the oven for eight minutes and serve at once. 

15. Frizzled Ham and Eggs. — Prepare the skillet with butter or beef 
drippings and put into it some finely chopped, boiled or fried ham ; pour over 
this from four to six well-beaten eggs and after it is heated through season 
with pepper and salt; stir all together; cook until brown and turn without 
stirring.' 

16. Poached Eggs. — Pyt water into a shallow stew pan over the fire 
and add salt and a tablespoonful of vinegar. The vinegar aids in "setting" 
the egg. When the water boils, carefully break the eggs into it one at a 
time, let them simmer two minutes, take them up carefully with a strainer 
and serve on toast cut into fancy shapes; garnish with parsley. 

1?'. Fried Eggs. — The frying pan should be perfectly clean when fry- 
ing eggs; butter, dripping or cottonseed oil may be used. As soon as the 



EGGS. 145 

pan is hot break the eggs into a cup and put them one at a time into the 
pan. As they fry raise the eggs from the bottom and give them a slight 
shake. Dip some of the hot butter over the yolk. They will be done in 
two or three minutes and should be taken out and the grease allowed to 
drain off. Serve on slices of bacon. 

18. Scrambled Eggs, — Melt a tablespoonful of butter over a hot fire, 
add four beaten eggs and stir quickly for one or two minutes. Salt and 
pepper to taste. Some increase the quantity by adding three-fourths of a cup 
of milk. The butter should then be put in first and the other ipgredients 
added and stirred until the whole thickens. ' When done it should be soft and 
creamy. Fine served on toast. 

19. Eggs a la Creme. — Slice twelve hard-boiled eggs in thin rings. 
Spread bits of butter in the bottom of a deep baking dish and put in a layer 
of bread crumbs and then a layer of the sliced eggs ; cover with bits of butter 
and dust on pepper and salt. Continue thus till the dish is nearly full. 
Crumbs spread with bits of butter should cover all the eggs. Over the whole 
pour a pint of sweet milk or cream and bake in a moderate oven. 

20. Eggs, Newport Style. — Soak a pint of bread crumbs in a pint of 
milk. Stir the soaked crumbs with eight eggs beaten very light, beating 
five minutes. Have ready a sauce pan containing two tablespoonfuls of 
butter which is very hot but not scorching; pour in the mixture of eggs and 
crumbs and season with salt and pepper as the mixture is stirred and 
scrambled. Stir quickly with the point of a knife for three minutes or until 
the mixture is thoroughly heated. This should be served on a hot platter 
with squares of buttered toast. 

31. Stuffed Eggs. — Cut six hard-boiled eggs in halves, take out the 
yolks and mash theip fine; add one teaspoonful of cream, two of butter, 
two or three drops of onion juice, and pepper and salt to taste. Mix thor- 
oughly and fill the whites with the mixture and put them together. To 
the filling which is left add a well-beat^ji egg. Cover the eggs with this 
mixture and roll in cracker crumbs. Put into boiling fat and fry a light 
brown. 

33. Cupped Eggs. — Take the required number of cups and put into 
each a spoonful of fiighly seasoned brown gravy; have a sauce pan of boil- 
ing water on the stove and set the cups into it and when the gravy is 
heated drop an egg into each cup; take the sauce pan oflf the stove and 
keep it covered close until the eggs are cooked tender; dredge with salt and 
nutmeg. Serve in a plate covered with a napkin. 

33. Eggs a la Mode. — Peel a dozen medium sized tomatoes and cut them 
up in a sauce pan; add salt, pepper and a little butter; when sufficiently 
boijed add six beaten eggs just before serving and stir one way for two 
rninutes. 

34. Buttered Eggs. — Heat and grease the muffin irons; break an egg

OMELETS. 

As will be seen from the recipes, opinions differ as to the way an omelet 
should be made, but the following general directions have given good 
results. 

The yolks should be beaten lightly. Much beating will make them too 
thin and it is said that twelve beats is the magic number. Add the milk, 
pepper, salt and flour if it is used,- and lastly add the whites beaten to a 
stiff froth. The skillet should be as hot as possible without scorching the 
butter ; after putting in a tablespoonful of butter the omelet should be poured 
in and it should begin to bubble and rise in flakes at once. It should be raised 
from the bottom occasionally with a thin, broad-bladed knife to prevent 
burning. Fold over as soon as the under side is set enough to hold together. 
Shake the skillet so as to free the omelet, slide it carefully on a hot platter 
and serve at once. It should be cooked in from three to five minutes.

These Secrets, Obtained from an Expert Confectioner, Enable the Housewife 

from a few Recipes to Make Endless Varieties of Candy, Including 

Chocolates, Bonbons, Fudges, Taffies, Caramels, Etc. 

" Sweets for the Sweet." 



At certain seasons and on special occasions, especially at Christmas 
time, every housewife desires to know something of the art of candy making 
and to make in her own kitchen and with ordinary cooking utensils, some 
of the sweets displayed so temptingly in the up-to-date confectionery stores. 
Candy making, to the layman, is a mysterious art suggestive of bright copper' 
kettles, white marble slabs, massive cooking furnaces, a confusion of ex- 
pensive machinery and white-aproned experts with years of experience and 
a knowledge of many recipes and secret processes, together with a wealth of 
capital. 

And for the most part confectioners aim to keep all knowledge of their 
art to themselves and for this reason but few really good recipes find their 
way into the popular cook books, while no knowledge of the principles under- 
lying the art are made public. The writer, having had years of experience 
and having now retired from business, makes known for the first time 
candy secrets obtained from confectioners whose whole lives have been 
devoted to the work and who are now operating some of the finest stores 
in the East. Candies made from several of these recipes have taken prizes 
in New York City in competition with the best artists of the world. Of 
course better results are obtained after one has had experience in the work 
and yet we will endeavor, even at the expense of repetition, to make the proc- 
ess so clear that the amateur, by carefully following the instructions given, 
may achieve results rivaling the products of the experienced confectioners

both in quality and appearance, and yet have the satisfaction of knowing it 
is " home-made." 

The professional candy maker uses expensive machinery and endless 
paraphernalia, not because they are necessary to good results, but because 
he manufactures in large quantities and the saving of time and labor is 
essential. 

PRECAUTIONS TO PREVENT SUGARING OR GRAINING IN MAK- 
ING ALL KINDS OF CANDY.— 

In making all candies, except those that scorch easily, as soon as the 
sugar is dissolved and it begins to boil it is well to cover the vessel for a 
short time, say two or three minutes, that the steam may soften any sugar 
sticking to the sides of the kettle, then to take a damp cloth and carefully 
remove all undissolved sugar. This is important that the candy may not 
" grain " or turn back to sugar. If the candy is one that easily burns and 
requires stirring the kettle must be cleaned without steaming. 

Either pure glucose or cream of tartar are generally used to prevent 
" sugaring." Vinegar will do but is not so sure. Be careful also that there 
is no sugar, not even a few grains, on the platter or marble upon which the 
candy is poured. Needlessly stirring or handling the batch while cooling 
will sometimes cause " graining." In spite of all precautions this will some- 
times happen. It must then be covered with water, again placed on the 
stove and re-cooked but will seldom be as nice as when cooked but once. 

COLORS. 

If desired, the colors for candies may be made at home instead of being 
purchased at a confectionery. 

For Red. — Take one-half pint of water, add one ounce of cochineal and 
boil for five minutes and add one-half ounce of powdered alum, one ounce 
of cream of tartar and boil for ten minutes. Take from stove and stir at 
once in two ounces, of sugar and bottle for use. 

For Blue. — Rub indigo in a little water in a saucer. 

For Yellow. — Rub gamboge in water in same way. 

For Green. — Boil spinach leaves in a little water for one minute, strain 
and bottle. 

TESTING— HOW TO TELL WHEN THE CANDY IS DONE OR HOW 
LONG IT SHOULD BE COOKED.— 

Candies are cooked for a short or long time, according as a low or 
high degree of heat, or temperature, is desired. Soft candies are cooked but 
a short time as only a low degree of temperature is needed. Hard candies 
are cooked longer or to a higher degree. For trying or testing the temperature, 
so as to know when the candy is done and should be removed from the stove, 
the confectioner generally uses a thermometer which he places in the boiling 
syrup, but as one fit for this purpose is rather expensive the housewife will 
find it more practical to try or test the candy by dropping a little of the 
boiling syrup into cold water. The confectioner uses his finger for this 
purpose by first wetting it in cold water, but it is safer for the beginner 
to use a spoon. The longer the candy cooks, or the higher the degree of 
temperature, the harder will it become when a little is thus chilled in cold 
water. One should try or test it frequently in this manner as it takes but a 
few moments over a hot fire to raise it from a low to a high degree. In 



256 THE PEOPLE'S HOME RECIPE BOOK. 

spite of care, should it be left on too long arid be too hare when testfed, 
add a little water to reduce it back and cook until it is of the right consistency 
when tested again. 

Below we give a table that will enable you to test properly and tell when 
the candy is done. Then under each recipe we refer you to this table so 
that you may know just how long each candy should cook. Much of your 
success depends, upon removing the candy from the stove at the right time. 
It will be seen from this table that if candy be boiled a short time and then 
a little be dropped into cold water it can just be felt with the finger or seen 
as syrup or molasses in the water. This is called the smooth (No. 1, below). 
If cooked a little longpr and then dropped into water it will stick or cliiig 
to the finger but is still too soft to p^ive shape or roll into a ball. This is the 
thread (No. 8, below). If cooked, still longer and again tested it may be rolled 
between the $ngers into a soft ball and is called the soft ball or feather (No. 3, 
below). And so it continues to get harder through the various degrees until 
if cooked long enough and again tested it becomes very hard when cooled 
in water and may be broken nke glass in the fingers. This is the dry crack 
(No. 7, below). If a thermometer wrere put into the boiling candy it would 
be found at the various stages to register the degrees given with each testing. 
This table may be used in cooking icings and frostings as well as candies. 
Use cold water. 

TESTING TABLE. 

No. 1. — The Smooth (318 degrees). The boiling syrup or candy can 
just be detected when dropped into water and is about the consistency of 
molasses. (Used fbi- crystallizing creams, candies, etc.) 

No. 3. — The Thread (235 degrees). The candy will stick or cling to the 
finger but will, not retain the shape of a ball when rolled between them. 
(Used for making liquors, etc.) 

No. 3. — The Soft Ball or Feather (240 degrees). — The candy .when cooled 
in water and rolled between the fingers will take the form of a soft ball. 
(Used for fondants, cream goods and fruit candies.) 

No. 4.— The Hard Ball {Uh to 250_degrees). When cooled in water and 
rolled between the fingers the candy will take the form of a rather hard ball 
but is not hard enough to crack when bent or broken. (Used for some 
fondants and creatn goods, such as cocoanut and combination creams.) 

No. 5. — The First Crack (250 degrees). Will just crack when bent or 
broken between the fingers. (Used for caramels, butter scotch, Japanese 
cocoanut bars, etc.) 

No. 6. — The Second Crack (8»6 to 260 degrees). Will crack more easily 
than for first crack and will chew free without sticking to the teeth. (Used 
for most taffies or candies that are pulled.) 

No. 7.— The Dry Crack (300 to 310 degrees). When cooled in water it 
will break brittle like glass in the fingers. If cooked much longer the candy 
will color and burn. (Used for stick candy and all kinds of hard clear 
candies.) 

FONDANTS. — The basis of cream candies of nearly every description 
is a combination of sugar, cream of tartar and water cooked together and 
then stirred and creamed. By confectioners' it is called " fondant." This 
fondant is variously colored, flavored and combined with chocolate, fruits, 
nuts, etc., to make chocolates, bonbons and wafers of nearly every descrip- 



THE ART OF CANDY MAKING. 157 

tion. The making of fondant is simple if accuracy is observed in following 
instructions and as it is the foundation of several hundred and in fact, as 
will be seen later, of several thousand varieties of cream candies, with this 
secret in her possession and a little experience, the housewife may compete 
with the confectioner in making endless varieties of toothsojne sweets. 

WHITE FONDANT is made by taking: 
Four cups granulated sugar 
Two cups hot water 
One level teaspoonful cream of tartar. 

Stir over a moderate fire until the sugar is dissolved. When it be- 
gins to boil, steam and wash the sides of the vessel to remove all sugar, 
as directed above. Then place over a quick fire and allow it to boil without 
stirring until it will form a soft ball when tested in cold water. (See No. 
3 in Testing Table.) Remove from fire and set aside until cool but not en- 
tirely cold, then stir vigorously with a spoon or wooden paddle until it 
creams and becomes quite stiff. When too thick to stir, knead it thoroughly 
in the hands until light and creamy. Do not be afraid of kneading too much. 
Place in an earthen vessel or crock, keep covered with a damp cloth and in 
twenty-four hours it will be ready for use, but if the cloth is kept damp it 
will keep a number of weeks and perhaps several months and be all the better. 
This is white fondant and is the one mostly used. 

MAPLE FONDANT is made by taking: 
Four cups broyvn sugar 
Two cups m^ple syrup 
Two cups hot water 
One levfel teaspoonful cream of tartar. 

Cook 4nd treat this the saqie'as white fondant above. 

When taken from the crock, should the top of the fqndant be dry or 
hard it may be kneaded ^gain until it is all of thfe same consistency. 

To Cplor Fondant. — ^XVork or knead in a little at a time any color de- 
sired, uptil pf the proper shade. 

To Flavor Fondant. — Work in the desired flavor in the same way to suit 
\.he taste. 

We will now proceed to the various combinations or cream candies which 
n^ay be made from fondant. 

CREAM CANDIES. 

Cretin candips include chocolates, bonbons, wafers, etc., and of each 
there are many varieties. 

1. Chocolatp^.— We will begin with those made from the white fon- 
dant described above. Color and flavor some of the fondant and roll it into 
small balls. A Httle starch may be used upon the hands to prevent sticking. 
Let these stand for an hour or two then dip into melted chocolate. Melt the 
chocplate by putting it into a dish and setting in a vessel of hot water. For 
dipping thp drpps use a fork or large needle and lay them upon paraifine or 
waxed paper tp harden. If the waxed paper is not at hand use common 
white paper that has been well greased with butter. 

2. Svveet Sweets and Bitter Sweets. — If the fondant is left uncolored 
and unflavpred two varieties are pbtained by dippjng the drops into either 
sweet, or bitter chocolate. If flavored with vanilla those dipped in sweet 



168 THE PEOPLE'S HOME RECIPE BOOK. 

chocolate are called " Sweet Sweets " and those dipped in bitter chscolate art 
called " Bitter Sweets." 

3. Various Chocolates. — The white fondant above may be colored pink, 
red, blue, yellow, green or orange and rolled and dipped into either bitter or 
sweet chocolate so that we will have fourteen varieties. Each one of these 
fourteen, before being rolled and dipped, may be flavored with either vanilla, 
lemon, pineapple, orange, wintergreen, peppermint, raspberry, strawberry, 
etc., giving 112 varieties. As soon as dipped in chocolate a nut kernel or 
piece of candied frui.t may be placed on top of each chocolate. By using 
English walnuts, black walnuts, pecans, hickory nuts, almonds, hazelnuts, 
pistachio nuts, filberts, cream nuts, candied cherries, or small pieces of citron 
or candied pineapple, etc., for this purpose,' the number of varieties is multi- 
plied by twelve, which makes over 1300 kinds. Instead of placing these 
nuts and fruits on top of the chocolate drop, the fondant may be rolled around 
any of them and then dipped in chocolate. By using the various colors and 
flavors of fondant in this way our 1300 is doubled to 2600 kinds. 

Then the maple fondant may be used in the same number of ways, 
which ag^in doubles the number of kinds so that we have over 5000 varieties 
of chocolate drops. In fact the combinations may be multiplied almost in- 
definitely to suit the taste or fancy of the confectioner and his patrons. 

4. Bonbons. — These are made the same as chocolates except that the 
rolled fondant is dipped in melted fondant instead of chocolate. Take some 
of the white fondant in a vessel, set this vessel into a kettle of hot water, 
until the fondant is dissolved. Dip the drops made from either the white 
or maple fondant into this melted fondant the same as into the .chocolate for 
chocolate drops. Or the maple fondant may be melted and used for the 
coating in the same manner. Both the fondant used for the drops and that 
melted for the coating may be flavored and colored to suit. Nuts, fruits, 
etc., may be used the same as with chocolates above, so that even more com^ 
binations may be m.ade in bonbons than in chocolates and our number of 
different kinds is again more than doubled, giving a total of more than 10,000 
varieties of cream candies alone, should one desire to exercise his fancy to 
that extent. 

5. Wafers. — To make wafers, melt some white fondant as directed 
above in making tonbons, color and flavor to suit and drop upon waxed 
paper, making the wafers about the size of a quarter or a little larger. In 
dropping the melted fondant, a large funnel may be brought into service, 
using a small, round stick about a foot long as a stopper. Hold the funnel 
right side up, place the stick in so as to close the small end, fill the funnel 
with the melted fondant, then open and close the small end of the funnel 
with the stick, allowing a little of the fondant to drop each time upon the 
waxed paper. A little practice will be required to make the wafers of 
uniform size. 

6. Cream Dates. — Cut the date open lengthwise and take out the seed 
carefully. Refill with enough fondant so that the date cannot quite be closed 
again. Thus you allow a part of the fondant to show. Then roll in granu- 
lated sugar or dip each end in melted fondant colored to suit. (See fondant 
above.) 

7. Cream Grapes. — Clip Malaga grapes from the stem with scissors 
to prevent leaking of the juice. Dip in melted fondant colored to suit and you 
have something luscious. 



THE ART OF CANDY MAKING. 159 

8. Cocoanut Creams. — When creaming white fondant (fondant for this 
purpose should be cooked a little longer than that described above, or to a 
hard ball as in No. 4 of the table for testing) stir in some good shredded 
cocoanut. After kneading, cut into small squares or bars to suit and dip 
in melted chocolate. Cocoanut creams are very fine eating. 

9. Combination Cream. — Pour into a small cake pan some melted fon- 
dant of any desired color. (This fondant should be cooked to a hard ball as 
in No. 4 of testing table above.) When cool, pour on top of this more 
melted fondant of another color allowing each layer to cool before adding 
another. The layers may be of any number, thickness and color desired. 
When all is cold, carefully take from the pan and cut into slices as you 
would cake. This makes a very attractive and a very rich candy. 

10. Orangettes. — Make the following fondant: Take 3 pounds granu- 
lated sugar, Ys teaspoonful cream of tartar and water enough to dissolve. 
Cook to a hard ball (No. 4 in testing table above), pour upon an ungreased 
marble or large platter. Add the grated yellow rind of two oranges and 
the juice of one and stir with spoon or paddle until creamed; knead with 
the hands until soft and creamy, roll into drops and dip into melted choco- 
late. Orangettes made from this recipe were awarded the prize in New 
York City. 

TAFFIES. 

In making candies a confectioner generally has a marble stone or slab or 
a cooling table made for the purpose upon which to pour the batch of 
candy when cooked. If these are not available a large platter will answer 
for domestic purposes. In making taffies this should be well greased with 
butter to prevent sticking. In the pulling -of taffies the confectioner uses 
a large iron hook, securely fastened to the wall; and for best results it will 
be found almost necessary in the making of home-made goods, for the candy 
can be pulled to much better advantage from a hook than in the hands and 
will be much more porous and light, which is much to be desired in taffies. 
A blacksmith will bend an iron to suit but if it is not convenient to have a 
hook made the candy may be pulled in the hands. Glucose is generally used 
in taffies instead of cream of tartar to prevent sugaring. Pure glucose is made 
from grain and is not injurious, as many people suppose. 

VANILLA, ORANGE, LEMON, PINEAPPLE, STRAWBERRY, 
WINTERGREEN, CINNAMON AND CLOVE TAFFIES.—These taffies 
are made the same, except that they are diiferently flavored and colored 
so we will treat them together. Take five pounds granulated sugar, one and 
one-half pounds of glucose, or if the glucese cannot be obtained use one 
level teaspoonful of cream tartar in its place. Add enough water to dissolve 
the sugar. When it boils, cover and steam the vessel two or three minutes 
to soften any sugar on the sides and then remove all undissolved sugai* 
with a damp cloth. Cook until, when tested in cold water, it will chew free 
and not stick to the teeth. This is the second crack as given in No. 6 of the 
table above for testing. Pour on greased marble or platter. If outer edges 
cool quickest turn them into center of platter that all may cool evenly, but 
be careful not to handle unnecessarily or it may go back to " sugar " and need 
to be recooked. As soon as it is cool enough to handle place on hook and 
pull. Any color or flavor may be added while on hook and thoroughly 
pulled in. Vanilla, orange, lemon, pineapple, strawberry, wintergreen, cinna- 



160 THE PEOPLE'S HOME RECIPE BOOK. 

mon and clove are most commonly used in taffies. These eight or ten varie- 
ties may be obtained from the one cooking if desired. When the taiify is 
pulled light and full of air and is cool enough to be rather stiff, remove 
from hook, cut into convenient lengths and place in pans. 

VARIOUS CANDIES. 

1. Butterine Sticks. — Take five pounds of granulated sugar, one and 
one-half pounds of glucose and one quart of sweet cream. Cook until it 
forms a soft ball when tested in cold water as described in No. 3 of the table 
for testing. This must be stirred constantly or the cream will burn. When 
done remove from fire and rub hard against the sides of the kettle with a 
knife or paddle until it creams, then before it sets pour on greased marble 
or plates, allowing it to make a layer about half an inch thick. Before it 
becomes entirely cold cut into sticks about four inches long and three- 
fourths of an inch in width. The writer is the originator of Butterines. 
They have had a great sale and will be found excellent. 

2. Cream Caramels — Vanilla and Chocolate. — Take two quarts of 
heavy sweet cream, five pounds of granulated sugar and one-half pound of 
glucose. Stir constantly while cooking to the first crack that can be de- 
tected when tested in cold water. (No. 5 in testing table above.) Remove 
from fire and stir in one tablespoonful of vanilla ; pour on greased marble or 
platter to a depth of half an inch. When cool cut into small squares. 

To make chocolate caramels add from one-fourth to one-half pound of 
grated chocolate shortly before taking from the stove, allowing only time for 
the chocolate to dissolve. Cook and treat as above. You will have to 
use great care to prevent scorching. These caramels will stand without 
wrapping. This recipe was obtained from a confectioner at the cost of five 
dollars and it makes one of the finest cream caramels manufactured. 

3. Candy Cough Drops. — ^Take two and one-half pounds of granulated 
sugar, one-fourth teaspoonful of cream tartar and enough water to dissolve. 
Cook to the dry crack or until it will break like glass when tested in cold 
water. (See No. 7 in testing table before given.) After testing place a little 
in the mouth and if it will not stick to the teeth when chewed it is ready 
to take from the stove arid pour upon greased marble or platter. When on 
platter add one-half ounce powdered willow charcoal and one-fourth tablespoon^ 
ful of oil of anise, fold afld knead thoroughly while as hot as can be handled. 
Then cut into small pieces or drops with shears. The batch must be handled 
rapidly or it will cool and harden before cut into convenient pieces. These 
are some of the best cough drops made and will last a long time. 

4. Peanut Bar Candy. — Take five pounds of granulated sugar, one- 
fourth pound of glucose and water to dissolve. Cook to a soft ball when 
tested in cold water, or to No. 3 in testing table previously given. Now add 
raw shelled peanuts to make the batch quite thick. Stir and cook until the 
peanuts are thoroughly done and smoke rolls from the kettle. Pour on 
greased marble or platter and when cool but not cold cut into bars with 
a large knife. The peanuts may be tested by dropping a few into cold water 
and biting in two with the teeth. They should be brown and well roasted. 
Do not forget to steam and wash the undissolved sugar from the sides of 
the vessel as elsewhere directed. Great care must be exercised for peanut 
candy very easily sugars and cannot be recooked like most candies. 

5. Qocoanut Bar Candy. — Take five pounds of light brown sugar^ o»e- 



THE ART UF CANDY MAKING. 161 

half teaspoonful of cream of tartar and enough water to dissolve. Cook to soft 
ball, or No. 3 in testing table previously given. Now add one and one-half 
pounds of shredded cocoanut, stir and cook to first crack, or No. 5. Pour 
on greased marble or platter making a layer half an inch thick. As soon as 
cool enough cut into bars.

PIES. 

No soil upon earth is so dear to our eyes, 

As the soil we first stirred in tei;restrial pies. 

— O. W. Holmes. 

" We've baked the pies you all like best 
And are willing now to stand the test; 
The proof of the pudding is in the eating, 
And the pies we serve there is no beating" 



GENERAL DIRECTIONS FOR MAKING PIES. 

In the baking of pies it takes much practice to become perfect. One may 
have the best recipes in the world aiid yet fail but the young housewife 
should not let this discourage her. 

The secret of pie-making is to use just as little water as possible and 
get the dough into shape, having everything very cold. Butter or lard for 
pastry should be fresh, sweet and solid. 

Use a cupful of lard and a teaspoonful of salt to a quart of flour. This 



f>tfeS. 163 

quantity will make four crusts, either two pies with covers or four without. 
The lard should be worked thoroughly into the flour with the fingers before 
any water is added. Use only a little water and press the dough together 
hard, then put upon a board that has been well floured. Roll the dough one 
way only. In warm weather if you are not ready to bake the paste at once 
after making up, it should be kept on ice till wanted. It improves pastry 
to lie on ice two or three hours and it may be kept several days if necessary. 

The under crust should be a little thicker than the top. If a pie is made 
without ah upper crust it is well to have a heavy edge. ' If tin pie pans are 
used the bottom crust will be better baked than if earthen pans are used. 
Before putting on the upper crust, wet the rim of the lower with water, or 
a thick paste of flour and water, or flour and egg; then press the two crusts 
well together and then loosen all from the pans. This will prevent the burst- 
ing of the pie. 

If it is a fruit pie a little flour should be dusted over the bottom ; or, 
the juice will be prevented from soaking through by rubbing some well- 
beaten egg over the lower crust with a piece of cloth. To prevent the jtiice 
from running over, a level teaspoonful of cornstarch should be evenly sprink- 
led over the fruit before the upper crust is put on. 

Always make air holes in the top crust or the pie will burst. It is best 
not to wash the rolling pin but to scrape the dough ofl^ well and rub with 
a dry towel. Thus it will always be dry and will never stick if kept well 
floured. 

Always beat eggs separately. 

Some always grease the pie tins while others sprinkle them with flour. 
It is safest to grease then^ if the pie is to be removed from the pan before 
putting on the table. 

To keep pastry from scorching on the bottom sprinkle salt in the oven 
under the pie tin. 

A nice, flakey, pie dough may be made by lessening the amount of short- 
ening and adding a level teaspoonful of baking powder to a quart of flour. 

The time for cooking pies varies with the heat of the oven and the kind 
of pie. Where a rich lemon pie might bake in twenty minutes it probably 
would require from thirty to forty minutes to bake a green apple pie. 
, Bake fruit pies in a moderate oven and if possible have a better heat at 
the bottom than at the top or the lower crust will be " raw." When done, 
the crust will separate from the pan and may be easily removed. It should 
be taken from the tin at once and slipped onto a porcelain plate if you would 
have the bottom crisp instead of soggy; or, stand on a wire cake sieve to allow 
the air to circulate all around it.

PUDDINGS AND SAUCES. 

"The proof of the pudding is in the eating." 

PUDDINGS. 

Each ingredient used in making a pudding should be of the best quality. 
The milk should be strictly fresh and the suet perfectly sweet. Dried cur- 
rants should be washed carefully and dried in a napkin. The stems and dirt 
should be removed by rubbing in a coarse towel after whiclj the currants 
should be seeded. Spices must be finely pounded and only the outside rind 
of oranges and lemons should be lightly grated ofif. 

For puddings, eggs should always be beaten separately, the yolks strained 
and the whites added last. Boiled milk should be allowed to. cool before the 
eggs are added and if fruit is used it should be added last. Puddings are 
either boiled, baked or steamed. Add a pinch of salt to all puddings and bake 
them as soon as mixed. Batter and cornstarch puddings require a rather quick 
oven while bread, rice, custard and fruit puddings should have a moderate 
heat. 

Boiled puddings will be lighter if boiled in a cloth with full room to 
swell but some use a mold or bowl with a cloth tied over it. The bagf should 
be wrung out of hpt water and well floured on the inside. As a rule boiled 
puddings require twice as long for cooking as those that are baked. Steamed 
puddings are likely to be lighter and more wholesome than those that are 
boiled or baked. Put over cold water and do not remove cover while steaming.

CREAMS AND CUSTARDS. 

" An't please your Honour," quoth the Peasant, 
" This same dessert is very pleasant." 

—Pope. 

We give herewith a recipe that is the ground work of all creams made 
with custard: — 

Stir two ounces of lump sugar, or sufficient for the purpose required, 
into a pint of boiling milk. Have ready the beaten yolks of four eggs and 
pour the boiling milk over . them. Put into a stew pan, place over a -slow 
lire and stir with a wooden spoon as briskly as possible for twenty minutes 
or until it begins to thicken ; then set on the coolest part of the range where 
it cannot simmer and let it stand for fifteen minutes, stirring occasionally. 
When the custard is ready it should be poured into a basin and flavored with 
vanilla, lemon or almond. Stir until cool so as to prevent a skin forming 
over the top. 

The secret of making a custard is in the stirring and when this is prop- 
erly done, a custard made with milk and the number of eggs given in this 
recipe will be as rich as one made with cream and a greater number of eggs. 

For cream and custards, eggs , should be beaten in stone or earthenware 
but never in tin. 

Custard should always be baked slowly in a moderate oven for too much 
heat will turn it to whey. The rule for a custard to bake is one cup of 
sugar, four eggs and one-half teaspoonful of salt to a quart of milk. 

In boiling custard always use a double vessel. It is well to bake cus- 
tards in small cups to be served to each person 

Remember that nutmeg and cinnamon are used with sugar, and cloves 
and allspice with meats. 

Only the outer part of lemon rind should be used. A good way is to 
rub it off with hard lumps of sugar. The sugar thus becomes saturated with 
the oil of the lemon. 

1. Apple Float. — Beat the whites of 4 eggs to a stiff froth ; add 4 large 
tablespoonfuls of powdered sugar and beat until fine and dry ; pare 3 large, 
tart apples and grate into this mixture a little at a time, beating all the while. 
Have ready a. good sized glass dish. partly filled with whipped cream; heap 
this by tablespoonfuls over the surface and dot here and there with candied 
cherries. 

, 3. Apple Snow. — Peel and grate 3 small sour apples, sprinkling over 
it a small cup of powdered sugar as you grate, in order to keep it from turn- 
ing dark. Break the whites of 3 eggs into this and beat it constantly for 
half an hour. Have it on a large platter as it beats up very stiff and light. 
Heap in a glass dish, pour a fine, smooth custard around it and serve. 

3. Banana Pudding. — Two eggs, 1 quart of milk, 1% teaspoonfuls of 
cornstarch or flour, 1 teaspoonful of vanilla, 4 tablespoonfuls of sugar; cook 
in double boiler and when cool pour over 6 bananas sliced very thin. It is 
like ice cream. 

4. Bavarian Cream. — One and one-half pints of milk, % box of gelatine

tine and the whipped whites of the eggs. Pour over bananas or fruit if 
desired.

ICE CREAMS, SHERBETS AND ICES. 

"Give us the luxuries of life, and we will dispense with the necessaries." 

Ice cream is richer when cream is used instead of milk ; however, milk 
alone may be used or milk and cream together. A number of varieties are 
obtained by adding various flavors and colors to vanilla ice cream, so we 
will first give a recipe for it. In making such ice cream as lemon, etc., 
from vanilla ice cream where the extract is used without the fruit, add 
one tablespoonful of extract to one gallon of vanilla ice cream. Ice cream 
expands in freezing so that the freezer does not need to be filled at first. 

In making ices be sure to use enough sugar and fruit for part of their 



ICE CREAM, SHERBETS AND ICES. 179 

taste is lost in freezing. There must be enough fruit, also, to give body to 
the ice. 

1. Vanilla and Lemon Ice Cream. — To make a gallon freezer full, take 
2% quarts of cream, 18 ounces of granulated sugar, 3 eggs well beaten and 
1 tablespoonful of vanilla extract. Freeze until stiff. To make lemon ice 
cream add 1 tablespoonful of lemon extract to a gallon of vanilla ice cream. 

2. Chocolate Ice Cream. — Shave 4 ounces of bitter chocolate very fine

oughly into one gallon of vanilla ice cream. 

3. Strawberry Ice Cream. — Wash 1 quart of strawberries, cover with 
sugar and let stand until the sugar is dissolved, then pass through a fine 
cloth ; add 1 tablespoonful of strawberry extract and whip into a gallon of 
vanilla ice cream. 

4. Banana Ice Cream. — Remove all dark spots from 4 bananas, mash 
thoroughly and whip into 1 gallon of vanilla ice cream. 

5. Almond Ice Cream. — One pint of blanched almonds, 1 pint of milk, 
1 quart of cream, 1 cup of sugar. Brown the almonds, then pound them 
to a paste in a mortar; cook the milk and pounded almonds together, then 
add the sugar and cook for a few moments ; strain the mixture through a 
sieve, pressing through as much of the almond as possible; when cold add 
the cream and % teaspoonful of almond extract. Freeze and when hard let 
stand 2 hours to ripen. 

6. Caramel Ice Cream. — Put 1 quart of milk in a double boiler ; when

an hour or two; before using run through a potato masher, or coarse cheese 
cloth, and add to the partly frozen ice cream. If desired, one or two peaches 
cut fine but not mashed, may be added at the last. A quart of peaches to 
a cup of sugar is a good proportion. 

11. Pineapple Ice Cream. — One pint of milk, 1 quart of cream, 1 can 
of grated pineapple, 1 pound of sugar, the white of an tgg and the juice of

little while, then add the beaten yolks of 2 eggs and 1 cup of sugar; cook for 
a few minutes, then add the beaten whites ; cool and freeze. To give it a 
caramel flavor, ssorch some of the sugar. 

14. Lemon Ice. — Take the juice of 6 or 8 lemons and the grated peel of 
three. Sweeten with sugar or syrup to taste, remembering that part of the 
flavor is lost in freezing. Add 2 eggs well whipped and ^ ounce of gelatine 
dissolved in hot water. Strain the whole and freeze. 

15. Orange Ice. — Using oranges in place of lemons proceed as for lemon 
ice. Add the juice of the two or three lemons as the taste of orange alone 
is not suiificiently distinct in an ice.

berries and % pint of water. Simmer for a few minutes, strain through a hair 
sieve, add another ^ pint of water and 13 ounces of sugar and it is ready, for 
freezing. 

18. Strawberry Ice. — Take 4 pounds of fresh strawberries and the juice 
of 3 or 3 lemons ; color with cochineal and sweeten to taste. The strawberries 
and lemon juice with a little sugar should be passed through a sieve, then 
the rest of the sugar and the color should be added before freezing. 

19. Cranberry Ice. — Stew 1 quart of cranberries in enough water to 
cover them. When they are soft, mash and strain through a sieve; add one 
pound of sugar; dissolve one package of lemon Jell-o in a pint of warm

freeze the milk and sugar; then add the strained juice of the lemon and freeze 
stiff. A little cream will improve it. This will make one quart. If desired, 
one can of pineapple may be added. 

33. Green Grape Sherbet. — Strain one quart of grapes through a cloth ; 
sweeten to taste. If too acid add from a pint to a pint and a half of water. 
Beat the whites of 4 eggs, and put the mixture into the freezer and turn slowly 
until frozen. This quantity makes a good gallon when finished. It is very 
white arid beautiful and the medical properties of grape juice render it highly 
digestible. 

34. Orange Sherbet. — One scant pint of cold water, 1 tablespoonful of 
gelatine, 1 cup sugar, 6 oranges or one pint orange juice, % cup boiling 
water. Soak gelatine for 10 minutes in % cup of cold water; put sugar and

remainder of cold water into pitcher, also the orange juice; if the oranges 
are very sour add more sugar. Dissolve the gelatine in the boiling water 
and add to the mixture. Strain into the can and freeze. 

35. Pineapple Sherbet. — Three lemons, 1 can of pineapple, 3 cups of 
sugar, 3 quarts of water, whites of 3 eggs. Whip the whites until stiff and 
add to the mixture after it is frozen ; turn awhile to thoroughly mix it. 

36. Bisque Glace. — One pint sweet milk, 1 quart cream, 1% dozen mac- 
aroons, % pint sherry wine, % box of gelatine; roll macaroons and soak in 
wine ; let milk come to a boil and pour over gelatine undissolved. When 
cold mix all together, sweeten to taste and freeze. 

37. Frozen Fruit. — Six oranges, 1 ten-cent can of pineapple, 1 pound white 
grapes, 4 lemons, 1 fifteen-cent bottle of cherries, 4 large cups sugar, 1 table- 
spoonful of gelatine. Cut the cherries and grapes in halves, and pineapple 
into small pieces; divide the oranges into quarters and remove all pith and 
dividing skin as far as possible, cutting the fruit into small pieces. Add 
the juice of the lemons and the gelatine dissolved in cold water and the 
sugar. Freeze shortly before serying, about as one would freeze sherbet, 
being careful not to make it too solid. This will serve about 40 people if 
served in small sherbet cups and costs, including ice to freeze^ about 75 cents. 

38. Maple Frappe. — One large cup of maple syrup, yolks of 4 eggs; 
cook until smooth, cool, and add 1 quart of cream; freeze. This is sufficient 
for 10 people.

CANNED FRUITS. 

(All Kinds.) 

When canning fruit see that the cans and elastics are perfect and that the 
tops fit properly. Put the cans and covers into a kettle of water and bring 
slowly to the boiling point. Dipping the elastics into the boiling water will 
be suf5ficient to sterilize them. Set the cans in a pan on the stove and fill 
to overflowing with the fruit which should be boiling hot. Put the top on 
quickly and screw it down tightly. As the fruit cools the tops should be 
screwed- down again and again to keep tight. It is best to use glass cans. 
To test whether they are air tight turn them upside down as soon as they 
are filled. The juice will ooze out if they are not air tight. Each can should 
be wrapped with paper to exclude the light and then set in a dark place that 
is cool but dry. The cans should be examined two or three days after filling, 
and if syrup leaks out from the rim the fruit should be recooked and us^(j 
for jam or jelly. 



186 THE PEOPLE'S HOME RECIPE BOOK. 

PRESERVES. 

(All Kinds.) 

Preserves must be made with the greatest care. As soon as pared, 
peaches, pears, apples and quinces should be placed in cold water to keep 
them from turning dark. Many fruits, such as pears, quinces, citrons, water- 
melon rinds, cherries, currants, etc., harden when put at first into a thick 
syrup. To prevent this they should be cooked first in water or thin syrup 
and the rest of the sugar added later. Apples, peaches, plums, tomatoes and 
strawberries are likely to become too soft in cooking. It is a good plan 
to pour the hot syrup over these fruits or to put the sugar over them and 
let them stand several hours. Either method extracts the juice and hardens 
the fruit. 

Preserves should boil gently to avoid burning and to let the sugar 
penetrate the fruit. As a general rule, from three-fourths to a pound of 
either loaf or granulated sugar is used for each pound of fruit. Put sugar 
and water over the fire in a porcelain kettle. Beat lightly the white 
of an egg with two tablespoonfuls of water and add to the syrup just be- 
fore it boils. As it begins to boil the scum should be carefully removed. 

CANNING FRUITS, MAKING PRESERVES, JELLIES, ETC. 

Simmer until the preserves are clear, then take out each piece with a 
skimmer and put at once into the jars. Stew the syrup until it " ropes " 
from the spoon, skimming off the scum which arises; then pour the syrup 
over the fruit in the jars and seal. When preserving apples or peaches it 
is an improvement to add a few slices of lemon or orange. To keep pre- 
serves from sugaring add a little tartaric - when cooked. 

MARMALADES. 

Marmalades and fruit butters will require less boiling and will be 
smoother and better flavored if the fruit is well cooked and mashed before 
adding either sugar or vinegar. They should be stirred constantly with an 
apple butter stirrer. 

JELLIES. 

For jelly, select fruit that is not too ripe as it wil! jelly better and have 
a better flavor. It should be heated as the juice can then be better extracted. 
Jelly should be strained twice and will be much lighter if allowed to hang and 
drip over night. Heat the juice, then add the sugar which should fjrst be 
heated in the oven. Jelly should be boiled rapidly in a pan with a large bottom. 
It should not stop boiling till done, which usually requires fifteen or twenty 
, minutes. If a little gelatine.be added it will not need to be cooked so long 
and will be of a lighter color. After the glasses are filled they should be set 
in the sun till cold, then a piece of writing paper should be placed directly 
on the jelly and another piece fastened over the glass with a rubber band. 
Moulding may be prevented by putting a teaspoonful of sugar on top of 
the jelly in the glass.

when cool, with melted paraffine before putting on covers. 

12. Strawberry Preserves. — Take equal parts by weight of sugar and 
fruit; the berries should be solid, used as soon as ready and not sugared 
down. Use just enough water to keep them from sticking and put berries, 
sugar and water all on at the same time and cook for 20 minutes. Then 
spread on flat dishes and set in sun for 3 or 4 days and then put in glass jars.

" Peter Piper picked a peck of pickled peppers.'' 

It is always best to u^e cider vinegar in making pickles as other kinds 
eat the pickles or make them soft. Vinegar whicji is too strong should be 
diluted with water. The vinegar should never be boiled but should be poured 
on the pickles hot as it comes to the first scald. If pickles are put into brine 
the brine should be strong enough to float an egg. A heaping pint of coarse 
salt should be used to each gallon of water. Never put pickles into anything 
that has previously held any kind of grease and never let them freeze. A 
good way is to put pickles in bottles and seal while hot. Put a slice or two 
of horseradish into the jar with pickles. It will soon sink to the bottom, 
taking the scum with it and leaving the vinegar clear.

spots with either vinegar or tartaric acid. 

167. To Prevent Blue from Fading. — All shades of blue may be pre- 
vented from fading by soaking for two hours in a solution of an ounce of 
sugar of lead to a pail of water. The material should then be allowed to dry 
before washing and ironing. 

168. To Wash Red Table Linen. — Set the color by using warm or tepid

thickness of wet cotton cloth over it, lay the velvet on this with the wrong 
side next the wet cloth, rub gently with a dry cloth tintil the pile is raised 
then lay the velvet on a table and brush with a cloth or soft brush. 

171. To Take Grease Out of Woolens, Silks, Paper, Floors, Etc.— Grate 
. either French or common chalk thickly over the spot, cover with a brown 

paper, set a hot flatiron on it and let it remain until cool ; repeat if necessary. 
See that the iron is not hot enough to burn the paper or cloth. 

173. Silver Polish for Shirts. — One 'ounce borax, one ounce isinglass, 
two teaspoonfuls white of egg, one teaspoonful white glue; cook well in two 
quarts of fine starch. Starch in this and dry. Before ironing apply it to 
the cuffs and bosom with a cloth until well dampened and iron immediately 
with a hot glossing iron. 

173. To Clean Black Lace. — Wipe off all the dust carefully with a cam- 
bric handkerchief; then pin it on a board, inserting a pin in each point of lace 
that projects. Sprinkle it all over with table beer and leave it until perfectly

and wash them in white castile soap suds or in borax water the s^me as 
though washing the hands; rinse by holding under a stream of water and 
dry with a towel. Keep them on until half dried, remove and fold carefully 
like new gloves and lay between towels under a weight. 

178. To Wash Delicate Colored Muslins. — Make a thick corn meal mush, 
salt it well and use instead of soap; rinse in one or two waters. It will not 
need starching. 



208 THE PEOPLE'S HOME RECIPE BOOK. 

179. Washing Laces. — Mix the dry particles of starch with enough cold 
water to make a smooth paste and add cold water until it looks like milk and 
water and boil in a glazed earthen vessel until transparent. While the 
starch is cooling squeeze the laces through soap suds and rinse in clear water. 
If you desire them to be clear white, add a little bluing; if ivory white, omit 
the bluing; if yellow-tinged, add a few teaspoonfuls of clear coffee to the 
starch. Run through the starch, squeeze, roll up in towels, and clap each piece 
separately until dry. Pull gently into shape from time to time and pin upon 
the ironing board. When dry press between tissue paper with a hot iron. 
Punch the openings and pick each loop on the edge with a large pin until it 
looks like new. 

180. To Bleach Muslin. — For fifteen yards of muslin dissolve one-half 
pound of chloride of lime in a quart of rain water. Soak the muslin over 
night in warm rain water. Wring out the cloth and put in another half 
tub of warm rain water in which the solution of lime has been poured. Leave 
it in this for about twenty minutes bvit lift up cloth for an airing every few 
minutes. Rinse in clear rain water. Will not injure the cloth. 

181. To Wash Lace Curtains. — Carefully shake out all the dust and 
put the curtains into tepid water in which is dissolved a little soda and 
without soaking wash at once in several waters. Rinse in water that has 
been well blued; also blue the boiled starch deeply and squeeze, but do not 
wring, the curtains. If you have no curtain frames, some sheets may be pinned ' 
on the carpet in a vacant room and the curtains pinned to them. Have the 
curtains stretched to same size as before washing. In a few hours they will 
be dry and ready to put up. The curtains should not be soaked and the wash- 
ing and stretching should be done as quickly as possible for curtains shrink 
rapidly. They should be measured before washing so they may be stretched 
to the same size. 

183. To Keep Cranberries. — Put them into a keg of water and they 
may be kept all winter. 

183. To Keep Celery. — Bury it in dry sand. 

184. To Keep Onions. — The best way is to spread them over the floor. 

185. To Keep Turnips. — Bury them deep in the ground and they will 
keep until spring. 

186. To Keep Lemons — They will keep and also be more juicy if kept 
covered with cold water. The water should be changed every week. 

187. To Keep Parsnips and Salsify. — Unless the climate is very severe 
they should be left in the ground all winter, otherwise they should be buried 
in a deep pit in the garden. 

188. To Keep Parsley Green and Fresh. — Make a strong, boiling hot 
pickle of salt and water and keep it in this for use. If wanted for soups and 
stuffing, hang it up in bunches in a dry attic, with the blossoms down. 

189. Whitewash for Cellars. — Add an ounce of carbolic acid to a gallon 
of whitewash or add copperas to ordinary whitewash until it is yellow. Cop- 
peras is a disinfectant and will drive away vermin. Carbolic acid will prevent 
the odors which taint milk and meat. 

190. To Keep Cellars Clean. — Remove all vegetables as soon as they 
begin to decay and ventilate well. Sprinkle with chloride of lime, which is 
a disinfectant. 

191. To Keep All Kinds of Herbs. — Just before or while the herbs are 
in blossom gather them on a dry day, tie in bundles and hang up with the 



" WHAT TO DO " AND " HOW TO DO IT." 309 

blossoms downward. When they are perfectly dry those that are to be used 
as medicine should be wrapped in paper and kept from the air while those 
that are to be used in cooking should have the leaves picked ofif, pounded, 
sifted fine and corked tightly in bottles. 

193. To Keep Cabbages. — Cut them off near the head and carry to cellar 
with leaves on, break off the leaves and pack the cabbages in a light box 
with the stems upward. When the box is nearly full cover with loose leaves 
and put the lid on to keep rats out. They should be kept in a dry cellar. 

193. To Keep Potatoes. — They should be kept in a cool, dark place. 
When old and likely to sprout, put them into a basket and lower them for 
a minute or two into boiling water. Let them dry and put in sacks. This 
destroys the germs without injuring the potato and allows it to keep its flavor 
until late. 

194. The Temperature at Which Vegetables Should be Kept.— Vege- 
tables should be kept at as low a temperature as possible without freezing. 
Apples will stand a very low temperature but sweet potatoes should have 
a dry and warm atmosphere and should be kept well packed in dry leaves. 
Squashes should be kept in a dry place and as cool as possible without 
freezing. 

195. To Keep Pess for Winter Use. — Shell them and put into boiling 
water with a little salt added, boil for five minutes. Drain in a colander and 
afterwards on a cloth, then place in air-tight bottles. When used they should 
be boiled until tender and seasoned with butter. 

196. To Keep Apples. — Apples are usually kept on open shelves where 
any that begin decaying may be removed immediately. Sometimes they are 
packed in layers of dry sand but care should be taken that they do not touch 
each other. They may also be packed thus in any grain, such as oats, barley, 
etc. If the apples are very choice, each one should be wrapped separately in 
paper and packed in a box. 

197. To Keep Grapes. — The simplest way is to keep them in drawers 
or boxes which hold about twenty-five pounds each, and pile them one above 
another. A better way is to ha::g a barrel hoop from the ceijing by three 
cords ; seal the stem with sealing wax, attach a wire to the small end of the 
bunch andj hang on the hoop, taking care that no two bunches touch. The 
imperfect grapes should previously have been picked off. The room should 
not he too moist and yet not so dry as to wither the grapes and it should be 
free from frost. 

198. To Keep Vegetables. — If they are to be kept a long time they should 
be pulled on a dry day and the tops should be cut off and trimmed. Pack 
them in layers in barrels or boxes with moss between and over them. The 
moss keeps them from shriveling and yet keeps out any excess of moisture. 

199. Mucilage. — Dissolve three ounces of gum arable by putting it into 
one-h'JE pint of cold water and stirring frequently. 

200. To Remove Coffee Stains. — Mix the yolk of an egg with a little 
water that is slightly warm and use it on the stain like soap. If the stains have 
been on tor some time a little alcohol should be added to the egg and water. 

301. To Restore Feathers. — Sprinkle a little salt on a hot stove and hold 
the plume in the fumes for a few minutes. 

303. To Clean Feathers. — Pour boiling water over some white curd soap 
which has been cut into small pieces and add a little pearlash. When dis- 
solved and cool enough for the hand, put the feathers into it and draw them 

> 2-14 



210 THE PEOPLE'S HOME RECIPE BOOK. 

through the hand until all the dirt is squeezed out, then pass them through 
a clean lather with bluing in it. Rinse in cold water with blue to give them 
a good color. Shake the water off by striking them against the hand, then 
dry them by shaking near a fire. To clean black feathers use water and gall 
and wash and dry in like manner. 

203. To Curl Feathers. — When nearly dry draw each flue or fibre over 
the edge of a blunt knife, turning it the way you want it to curl ; if the feather 
is to be flat, press it between the leaves of a book. 

204. Magic Annihilator. — To make a gross of 8-ounce bottles of annihi- 
lator, take one gallon aqua ammonia, four pounds of best white soap, eight 
ounces of saltpeter and eight gallons of soft water. Pour the water over the 
soap which has previously been shaved fine and boil until dissolved. Let it 
get cold, then add the saltpeter and stir until dissolved. Strain, let the suds 
settle, skim off the dry suds, add the ammonia and bottle and cork at once. 

What It Will Do. — It will remove all kinds of oil and grease from every 
description of wearing apparel, such as coats, vests, pants, dress goods, car- 
pets, etc., and will not injure the finest laces and silks. It works like a charm 
when used as a shampoo, lathers freely and removes all grease and dandruff. 
A cloth wet with it will remove every pjClicle of grease from door knobs, 
window sills, etc It will remove paint ^fom a board no matter how dry 
or hard the paint may be and will not injtiflre the finest textures. It acts on 
oil or grease, turning it to soap which may be washed out with cold water. 
Nothing can beat it for cleaning brass, copper and silverware. It will posi- ^ 
tively exterminate bed bugs. 

Directions for Using. — To remove grease spots, pour some of the Magic 
Annihilator upon both sides of the article to be cleaned and rub well with a 
clean sponge. If the grease upon carpets and coarse goods is hard and dry, 
use a stiff brush and afterwards wash out with clear, cold water. One appli- 
cation is all that is ever required tt> remove fresh grease spots but two ap- 
plications may occasionally be necessary to remove old spots. For a shampoo 
mix the Annihilator with an equal quantity of water and apply to the hair 
with a stiff brush, rub well into the pores and wash out with clear water. 
It will give the hair a gloss like silk. For cleaning silver, brass and copper 
mix a little whitening with a small quantity of the Annihilator, apply to the 
metal and rub briskly with a rag. Apply it to beds and other places where 
they frequent and you will soon be rid of the bugs. Many other uses will 
be found for the Magic Annihilator. 

205. To Remove Sealing Wax. — Apply either alcohol or naphtha to 
the spots with a camel's-hair brush. 

306. To Remove Tar. — Scrape off all the tar possible and then thor- 
oughly wet the place with either melted lard or good salad oil and let it 
remain for twenty-four hours; if woolen or silk, take out the grease with 
either spirits of wine or ether; if cotton or linen, wash out in strong, warm 
soap suds. 

207. To Make Bluing for Clothes. — Powder one ounce of soft Prussian 
blue and put it into a bottle with a quart of clear rain water, then add one- 
fourth ounce of oxalic acid. Use a teaspoonful for a large washing. 

208. Patent Soap. — Three pounds grease, three pints salsoda, one-half 
pint turpentine, two pounds resin soap, forty gallons water ; boil one hour. 
This makes a great soap. 

209. Brilliant Self-Shining Stove Polish.— Take black lead (plumbago), 



" WHAT TO DO " AND " HOW TO DO IT." 211 

finely pulverized, and put into 2-ounce wooden boxes; label them neatly arid 
retail for 10 or 15 cents per box, or wholesale at $6.00 per hundred. It costs 
three cents per box to prepare. 

Directions. — ^This , polish requires no mixing which is so disagreeable 
to the housewife. Dip a damp woolen cloth into the box and apply to the 
stove, then polish with a dry cloth. It will give a very beautiful polish. 
Stove polish is a necessity in every home and if you have the best, as thjs is, 
you will make a sale at every house. Step up and polish a small place on 
the stove and the sale is made. If the stove is not convenient, use a piece of 
wood, a sheet of paper, a potato or almost any article and you will have a 
lustre like a burnished mirror. This is a great invention and will make money 
for those who push the sale. 

210. To Clean Gold Chains, Etc. — Let the article lay in a solution of 
caustic potash until all the dirt is removed. 

211. To Kill Carpet Bugs. — Put one tablespoonful of corrosive sublimate 
into a quart of hot water and saturate the floors and cracks in the walls. 
If the carpet is to be sponged use a weaker solution. It will be found a sure 
treatment. 

212. To Sweeten Rancid Butter. — Use 15 drops of chloride of lime to a 
pint of cold water and wash the butter thoroughly with it until it has touched 
every particle; then work the butter over in clear, cold water. 

213. Liquid Glue. — Dissolve half a pound of best glue in three-fourths 
pint of water and add one-half pint of vinegar. This glue is always ready for 
use without warming. 

214. Concrete. — Add 15 barrows of sand to 8 barrows of slacked lime 
that is well deluged with water. Do not use river or beach sand as it 
absorbs moisture. Mix to a creamy consistency and add 60 barrows of coarse 
gravel and work well. Stones 9 or 10 inches in diameter may be put into 
this mixture and it will become as hard as rock. 

215. Patent Blacking. — One gallon alcohol, ll^ pounds gum shellac, 1 
ounce sulphuric acid; let stand for 48 hours, then add % pound ivory black. 
Let stand 34 hours, then carefully pour off the top. This is for the polishing 
of all kinds of leather and is waterproof. A four-ounce .bottle retails for $1.00 
and $50.00 was the original cost of this recipe. Of course it may be made in 
smaller quantities by using the same proportions. 

216. Axle Grease. — One pound tallow, % pound black lead, 1/4 pound 
castor oil; melt the tallow; add the other ingredients and rub all together 
until cold and well mixed. 

217. To Find the Number of Bushels in a Bin. — Multiply together the 
three dimensions in feet to get the number of cubic feet and deduct % and 
you will have approximately the number of bushels in the bin. 

218. To Measure Hay. — Fifteen to eighteen cubic yards of hay well 
settled in mows or stacks make a ton ; 20 to 25 cubic yards make a ton when 
loaded on a wagon from mow or stack; 25 cubic yards of dry clover make 
a ton. To find the number of tons in a mow multiply the length, width and 
height in yards and divide by 15 if well settled and by 18 if not so well 
settled. 

219. Apple Tree Louse. — Lime and tobacco juice mixed together will 
kill them. 

220. Army Worm. — A ditch around the field to be protected will arrest 
their progress so that they may be killed by covering with earth, by crushing 



212 THE PEOPLE'S HOME RECIPE BOOK. 

with rollers, pouring coal oil in ditch or burning straw over them. The sida 
of the ditch next the field should be perpendicular or sloping under so they 
cannot easily crawl out. 

231. Bark Lice. — Use a strong lye made from wood ashes or diluted 
soft soap or a mixture of lime, whitewash and kerosene. If the latter is used 
there should be a pint of kerosene to a gallon of whitewash. 

222. Apple Tree Borers. — During the spring or early summer the trees 
should be washed with strong soap suds to kill the borers. 

223. Cinch Bugs. — They may be destroyed with a mixture of soap suds 
and kerosene. Make the suds by using one pound of soap to ten gallons of 
water, then use equal parts of the suds and kerosene to make the emulsion. 

224. Colorado Beetle or Potato Bug. — Dust the vines with Paris green, 
London purple or carbonate of lime. 

225. Corn Moth. — Fill up all cracks and sweep the floors and walls clean 
before storing the corn. To destroy the moths, fill all cracks and then sprinkle 
the floor with a mixture of strong white wine vinegar and salt before laying 

, up the corn. If the moth has deposited its eggs on the grain salt may be mixed 
with it. 

226. Grain Weevil. — The granary should be fumigated thoroughly with 
burning sulphur before the grain is stored and again in about two months. 

227. Caterpillars. — ^These may be destroyed with powdered hellebore. 

228. Hessian Fly. — Quicklime scattered over the field immediately after 
the grain is cut will destroy the pupae. It is well to thresh as soon as possible 
after the grain is cut then to scatter the straw over the stubble and burn. An- 
other way is to turn the cattle on the young wheat while the ground is yet 
frozen and let them eat the wheat close to the ground. 

229. Strawberry Worms. — Poultry will destroy them. They should be 
turned into -the patch before the berries are formed. Spray the plants with 
one pound of white hellebore in twenty gallons of water. 

230. To Cut or Break Glass in Any Shape. — File a notch in the edge of 
the glass at the place you wish to begin to break from; then put a red hot 
iron on the notch and draw it in the direction you wish the glass to, break. 
If the iron be drawn slowly a crack will follow it. Another way is to hold 
the glass level under water and cut with a pair of shears. 

231. To Bore Holes in Glass. — Any hard steel tool will easily cut glass 
if it be kept moist with camphor dissolved in turpentine. A drill may be 
used or, if that be not available, the tool may be held in the hand. A window 
glass may be easily sawed with a watch spring saw if this solution be used. 

232. To Clean Tobacco Pipes. — Pour alcohol into the bowl and allow 
it to run out of the stem. This will thoroughly clean and sweeten the pipe. 

233. To Petrify Wood. — Mix equal parts of rock alum, gem salt, white 
vinegar, chalk and peebles powder ; after the ebullition has ceased throw any 
piece of wood or other porous substance into the solution and it will petrify. 

234. To Remove Blood Stains. — Steep the article in lukewarm water. 
If pepsin is at hand apply it after fifst softening the spots in lukewarm water. 

235. To Remove Tar, Wagon Grease, Mixtures of Fat, Carbon and 
Acetic Acid. — If the spots be on white goods apply soap and oil of turpentine, 
alternating with streams of water. If the spots are on colored cottons or 
woolens, rub in with lard ; let it lie ; soap ; let lie ; and proceed, alternating with 
oil of turpentine and water. Treat silks the same only use benzine in place 
of turpentine. 



" WHAT TO DO " AND " HOW TO DO IT." 213 

236. Black Ink, Copying or Writing Fluid. — Rain water, one gallon; 
brown sugar, one-eighth pound ; gum arabic, one-eighth pound ; powdered nut- 
galls, three-eighths pound ; clean copperas, one-eighth pound ; bruise and mix, 
then let stand for 10 days, shaking occasionally ; strain. If not used as a copy- 
ing ink but one-fourth of the sugar or gum is needed as it will then flow more 
freely. This ink is fine for, records and deeds for it may be read hundreds 
of years hence. 

DYEING AND COLORING. 

General Remarks. — Every article to be dyed should be perfectly clean. 
They should be washed thoroughly with soap and then rinsed. To prevent 
spotting, the goods should be dipped into warm water jvtst before they are 
put into the various coloring preparations. After the article is dyed it should 
be aired awhile, then well rinsed and hung up to dry. Cotton goods should 
first be bleached if they are to be dyed a light color. Never wring silk or 
merino dresses. Use soft water and where the quantity is not mentioned 
enough should be used to well cover the goods. 

COTTON GOODS. 

237. Black. — For 5 pounds goods take 3 pounds (wood and bark to- 
gether) of sumac and boil one-half hour and let the goods steep in this for 
12 hours; then dip for half an hour in lime water and let drip for an hour; 
now add half a pound of copperas to the sumac liquor and dip the goods 
again in this for an hour and then for one-fourth hour in the lime water. 
Make another dye by boiling 3^^ pounds of logwood for an hour and dip the 
goods in this for three hours, then add 2 ounces bi-chromate of potash and 
dip for another hour. Wash the goods in cold water and dry in the shade. 

238. Brown for Cotton, Woolen or Silk. — For coloring 5 pounds of goods 
dissolve two ounces of alum and one pound of catechu in enough hot water 
to wet the goods. Put this solution into a tin boiler or a brass kettle on 
the stove and put in the goods when it is boiling hot and remove from the 
fire. You should have ready 4 ounces of bi-chromate of potash dissolved in 
hot water in a wooden pail. Drain the goods from the catechu and then dip 
them alternately into the bi-chromate of potash and catechu until of the 
desired shade. 

239. Sky Blue for Cotton or Silk. — Dissolve two ounces of blue vitriol 
in one gallon of water and dip the goods for fifteen minutes, then put through 
lime water. 

240. Blue. — For 5 pounds of goods dissolve 4 ounces of copperas in 3 
or 4 gallons of water and soak the goods thoroughly, then drain and put them 
into a solution of 3 ounces of prussiate of potash in 3 or 4 gallons of water. 
Lift the goods and put them to drain, then pour i/^ ounce oil of vitriol into the 
prussiate of potash solution, stirring carefully and pouring in but a few drops 
at a time. Put the goods in this solution until of the desired shade then rinse 
in clear water and hang up to dry. 

241. Yellow. — For 5 pounds of goods dissolve 1 pound of sugar of lead 
in enough water to thoroughly wet the goods and in the same quantity of 
water in another vessel dissolve % pound of bi-chromate of potash. Dip the 



214 THE PEOPLE'S HOME RECIPE BOOK. 

goods well and drain in each alternafceljr until of the desired shade, then 
rinse and hang up to dry. 

243. Orange. — Color the goods yellow as given elsewhere but before 
rinsing dip them into strong, hot lime water. 

243. Green. — First color blue as given elsewhere, then proceed as in 
yellow, also given elsewhere. 

244. Red. — Put % teacupful of muriate of tin into enough water to cover 
the goods well, bring to a boil, put in the goods and leave for an hour, stir- 
ring often, then remove them and empty the kettle. Put 1 pound of nic- 
wood into the kettle with clean water and steep for half an hour at hand 
heat, then put in the goods and slowly increase the heat for an hour but 
do not boil. Air the goods and dip an hour as before. Wash without soap. 

V/OOLEN GOODS. 

245. Chrome Black. — For 5 pounds of goods dissolve 6 ounces of blue 
vitriol in enough boiling water to cover the goods. Dip the goods 45 minutes, 
airing frequently, then remove. Make a dye by boiling 3 pounds of logwood 
for half an hour ; dip the goods for 45 minutes, air and dip again for the same 
length of time. Wash the goods in strong suds. The sun will not fade this. 

246. Brown. — Color the same as for cotton goods. 

347. Blue. — For 3 pounds of goods take sufficient water to cover and add 
5 ounces of alum and 3 ounces of cream of tartar and boil the goods in this 
for an hour. Now boil the goods, until the color suits, in warm water con- 
taining more or less extract of indigo, according to the color desired. 

248. Yellow. — For 5 pounds of goads make a solution by adding 2 ounces 
of alum and 3 ounces of bi-chromate of potash to enough water to color the 
goods and boil them in this for half an hour; lift and air until well cooled 
and drained, then work for half an hour in a bath with 5 pounds of fustic. 
Wash and hang up to dry. 

249. Green. — For each pound of goods put 3% ounces of alum and 1 
pound of fustic into sufficient water to cover goods; steep until the strength 
is out before putting in the goods ; then soak until a good yellow color is ob- 
tained; then remove the chips and add extract of indigo or chemic until of 
the desired color. 

250. Scarlet. — For one pound of goods take sufficient water to cover 
and boil in it % ounce of pulverized cochineal, % ounce cream of tartar and 
2% ounces muriate of tin; put ifi the goods and work briskly for 10 or 15 
minutes, then stir goods slowly while boiling 1^/^ hours. Wash and hang in 
the shade to dry. 

251. Crimson. — Make a bath of 6 ounces of dry cochineal, 1 pound cochi- 
neal paste, 1 pound of tartar and 1 pint of proto-chloride of tin. Work the 
goods in this bath fbr an hour, wash out and hang up to dry. 

352. Orange. — For 5 pounds of goods take sufficient water to cover, 4 
ounces argal, 6 tablespoonfuls muriate of tin; boil and dip 1 hour, then add 
1 cup of madder and dip for half an hour. A much brighter color will be 
obtained by using 2 ounces of cochineal instead of the madder. 

253. Pink. — For 3 pounds of goods use 3 ounces of alum ; boil and dip 
the goods for an hour; then add to the solution 4 ounces cream of tartar and

" WHAT TO DO " AND " HOW TO DO IT." 215 

SILK GOODS. 

354. Black. — For 5 pounds of goods make a dye by boiling 3 pounds of 
logwood in enough water to cover goods. Work the goods in bi-chromate of 
potash which is not quite to the boiling point, then dip them in the logwood 
solution in the same way. 

255. Brown. — Color the same as. for cotton and woolen goods given else- 
where. 

256. Sky Blue. — Proceed as for cotton goods given elsewhere. 

257. Light Blue. — Dissolve % tablespoonful of alum in a cup of warm 
water and add to a gallon of cold water, then add a teaspoonful of chemic at 
a time until the desired shade is obtained. The more chemic is used, the 
darker will the color be. 

258. Orange. — For one pound of goods use a pound each of soda and 
annotto ; repeat if desired. 

259. Green. — For 1 pound of goods boil 8 ounces of yellow oak bark for 
% hour ; turn off the liquor from the bark and add 6 ounces of alum ; let stand 
until cold ; while this is being made color the goods in the blue dye-tub a light 
blue; dry and wash; then dip in the oak and alum dye. Warm the dye a 
little if it does not take well. 

260. Yellow. — For 1 pound of goods make a solution of % ounce sugar 
of lead and 3 ounces alum and let the goods stand over night in it ; take out 
and drain. Make another dye with 1 pound of fustic; dip in this until the 
desired color is obtained. 

261. Crimson. — Dip 1 pound of goods in a solution made with 3 ounces 
of alum. This should be at hand heat. Take out and drain while making 
a new dye by boiling for 10 minutes 2 ounces of bruised nut-galls, 3 ounces 
cochineal and % ounce of cream of tartar in one pail of water. When this is a 
little cool, begin to dip the goods, raising the heat to a boil. Dip for an hour ; 
wash and hang up to dry. 

262. A Quick and Easy Way to Compute Interest. — Allow 30 days for 
each month and multiply the amount .by the number of days. 

The result divided by 60 gives the interest at 6 per cent. 

The result divided by 45 gives the interest at 8 per cent. 

The result divided by 40 gives the interest at 9 per cent. 

The result divided by 36 gives the interest at 10 per cent. 

The result divided by 30 gives the interest at 12 per cent. 
Example.— $200.00 for 3 months and 10 days, or 100 days, is 20000; 
divided by 40 gives $5.00, which is the interest at 9 per cent; or divided by 
60 gives $3,333, interest at 6 per cent. etc. To find the interest at 5 per c'ent. 
first find the interest at 6 per cent, then deduct 1/6. Or add 1/6 to find the 
interest at 7 per cent. etc. 

263. To Find the Number of Gallons in a Barrel or Cask. — Add the 
greatest and the smallest diameters in inches together and divide by 2 and this 
will be the average diameter. Multiply this number by itself, then by the 
length of the barrel in inches and then by 34 and cut off the four right-hand 
figures. This is approximately the number of gallons. 

Example. — A cask is 28 inches in diameter at the head and 32 inches at 
the bung and is 36 inches in length ; 28 plus 32 equals 60, divided by 2 equals 
30, or the average diameter ; 30 times 30 equals 900 ; 36 times 900 equals 32400 ; 



216 THE PEOPLE'S HOME RECIPE BOOK. 

34 times 32400 equals 1101600. and cutting off the four right-hand figures 
leaves 110 as the number of gallons. 

264. To Find the Number of Gallons in a Round Tank. — Multiply the 
diameter in feet by itself (called squaring the diameter), multiply the product 
by the depth in feet, then multiply by 6 and the result is the approximate 
number of gallons in the tank. 

Example. — ^A tank is 5 feet : i diameter and 7 feet deep; 5 times 5 equals 
25, 7 times 25 equals 1?(3, 6 ti:T?,es I'J'S equals 1050 gallons. 

265. How to Find the IVi timber of Common Bricks in a Wall or Building. 
— Multiply together the lerigtli, height and thicV:ness in feet ard multiply 
this result by 20 and you will have tne number of common bricks in the wall. 
Find the numbei in each wall and add these together and you will have the 
number in the building. 

366. Table of Avoirdupois Weight. — 

437% grains equal 1 ounce. 

16 ounces equal 1 pound. 

35 pounds equal 1 quarter. 

2000 pounds equal 1 ton. 

2240 pounds equal 1 long ton. 

267. Miscellaneous Weights.— 

100 lbs. nails equal 1 keg. 

196 lbs. flour equal 1 barrel. 

200 lbs. beef or pork equal 1 barrel. 

380 lbs. N. Y. salt equal 1 barrel. 

268 Table of Troy Weight.— 

24 grains make 1 pennyweight. 

20 pennyweights make 1 ounce. 
13 ounces make 1 pound. 

480 grains make 1 ounce. 

The troy pound contains 5760 grains while the avoirdupois pound contains 7000 
grains. If a merchant sells you a pound of tea by troy weight he cheats you, but if he 
sells you an ounce by troy weight he cheats himself out of 43% grains. 

369 , Table of Apothecaries Weight— 

1 drop equals 1 grain. 
20 grains make 1 scruple, which is equal to Vs teaspoonful. 

3 scruples make 1 drachm, which is equal to 1 teaspoonful. 

8 drachms make 1 ounce, which is equal to 2 tablespoonfuls. 
12 ounces make 1 pound. 

370. Table of Fluid Measures.— 

60 drops make 1 fluid drachm, or 1 small teaspoonful. 

8 fluid drachms make 1 fluid ounce, or 2 tablespoonfuls, or % gill. 
16 fluid our|ces make 1 pint, or 4 gills. \ 

1 pint equals 1 pound in weight except with Ether, Glycer- 

ine, Sulphuric acid. Chloroform apd a few 
others. 

271. A Handy Table.— 

1 tablespoonful equals 4 teaspoonfuls. 
1 teacup equals 4 fluid ounces. 

1 coffee cup equals 6 fluid ounces. 
1 wine-glass equals from 3 to 4 tablespoonfuls. 

272. Table of Liquid Measure.— 

4 gills make 1 pint. 
2 pints make 1 quart. 
4 quarts make 1 gallon. 



" WHAT TO DO " AND " HOW TO DO IT." 217 

273. How Clothes Are Cleaned by Those Who Make it a Business. — In 
cleaning establishments, silks and woolen clothes are immersed in gasoline 
and dipped up and down, and especially the soiled parts are rubbed with ivory- 
soap. They are then rinsed in clean gasoline. The odor is removed by shak- 
ing for fifteen or twenty minutes or by hanging on a line where there is a 
good breeze. Don't use gasoline near a light or stove. 

274. To Clean Dark Furs. — Put some new bran into a pan on the stove 
and heat very hot, stirring so" as not to let burn. Rub this thoroughly into 
the fur several times then shake and brush it till it is free from dust. 

275. To Clean Light Furs. — Lay the fur upon a table and with a flannel 
rub it with bran that is slightly moistened with warm water Rub until 
dry then with book muslin apply dry bran. Dry flour will do instead of the 
wet bran. When through rubbing with the bran or flour rub magnesia the 
wrong way into the fur then shake and brush. 

276. To Clean Straw Hats. — First sponge the hat with a mixture of 2% 
drachms sodium hyposulphite, 1 drachm glycerine, 2i/2 drachms alcohol, 2i/Jt 
ounces of water; then hang the hat in the cellar or other moist room for 
24 hours ; then apply a solution of y% drachm citric acid, 2^/^ drachms alcohol, 
3 ounces of water and again hang in a moist room for 24 hours. The hat 
should then be gone over with a flatiron that is not too hot. 

277. Cut Worms. — Make a little ring of either lime or wooci' ashes about 
the plant as a protection against cut worms. 

278. Onion Maggots. — The best known remedy is to put chimney soot 
in the drills. 

279. Plant Lice. — A tea made from tobacco, or tobacco smoke, will kill 
them. 

280. Squash Bugs. — Put some white shingles on the ground under the 
vines and the bugs will collect under them and may be destroyed in the 
morning. 

281. Slugs. — In England the gardeners drop a handful of bran every 
8 or 10 feet along the garden walks. The slugs collect on these little heaps 
of bran and may be swept up in the morning with a broom and dust pan. 

282. Scale. — Boil 1 gallon of barley in water, pour off the liquid (the 
grain will do to feed the chickens) and add quicklime to it until about as 
thick as paint. When cold add 1 pound of lampblack and mix for a long 
time then add % pound flowers of sulphur and 1 pint of alcohol. Brush 
the bark of the tree with a stiff brush to remove the moss and then apply 
the liquid with a paint brush. 

283. Canker Worms. — Spread tar, or tar and molasses, on a cloth and 
bind about the trunk of the tree near the ground. Do this early in the spring 
and the female worm will be kept from crawling up the tree. Apply kero- 
sene below the cloth to kill the eggs. 

284. Grubs. — Apply soap to the trunks of the apple and peach trees dur- 
ing May. In the fall cut out all that have entered the bark. 

285. Cucumber Beetles. — About the only way to keep these away is to 
cover the plants with netting. 

286. Celery Pest or Little Negro Bug. — Sprinkle the plants with a 
mixture of 1 tablespoonful of crude carbolic acid to 2 gallons of water. If pre- 
ferred, a teacupful of the acid may be mixed with a bushel of either air- 
slacked lime or land plaster and the plants dusted with this.

AUTHOR'S PREFACE. 



Having been Veterinary Editor of the " Ohio Farmer " for about thirty 
years and of the " Michigan Farmer " for nearly fifteen years, I have prob- 
ably had more correspondence with Farmers and Stock Owners pertaining 
to the ailments, feeding, and breeding of live stock than has any other 
Veterinarian in the country. During these many years of connection with 
these Standard Farm Journals I have answered over a quarter of a million 
Inquiries concerning the diseases and care of domestic animals. Many of 
these questions have been concerning things either improperly treated or not 
treated at all in the stock books in use among the farmers. Thus, I believe 
I am in a position to know just what the farmer and stockman need and 
my years of experience have perhaps fitted me for treating these subjects 
in a way easily understood by every person in the country. 

Many of the stock books in common use have been written by college 
professors or retired veterinarians who perhaps had a great deal of scieintific 
knowledge but were lacking in actual experience and consequently most 
of their books have been written in language not easily understood by the 
average person. I have long seen the need of a practical book of this kind 
and have tried to make this work thoroughly scientific and yet so simple and 
practical that it can be used by every stock owner in the land. 

This work has been written at my Veterinary Hospital at Cleveland 
while actively engaged in my extensive practice. Though it has been with 
difficulty that I have found time for the work, yet after several years of dili- 
gent work and research I have finally succeeded in completing my task 
and believe that the book will be found all the more practical for having 
been written while thus actively engaged in my practice. The merits of 
every remedy prescribed in this book I have thoroughly tested and tried 
in my practice and at my hospital and having been President of both the 
Cleveland and the Ohio State Veterinary Medical Associations I have been 
enabled to learn how these remedies effected cures in the hands of the Vet- 
erinary Profession in general. Also, having been Consulting Veterinarian 
for The Cleveland Humane Society for thirty years and for some time Presi- 
dent of The Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, I have been 
afforded an excellent opportunity to study sick and disabled animals. Many 
of the illustrations found in this work are actual photographs taken from 
life of cases that have been brought to my Veterinary Hospital for treat- 
ment and care and among these cases have been some of the most celebrated 
horses in the world. These illustrations have been procured at Lhe cost 
of much time and money and I believe they will be found of great value in 
determining the diseases of stock. A horse can not tell you what the trouble 
is, but these pictures will aid you in locating the ailment. 

Though I have given what I considered the best and simplest remedies, 
yet in many instances I have seen fit to add to my own treatment of the 
disease various "People's Home Remedies" which have been gathered 
from practical fanners and stock owners of many different states. These 



ii PREFACE. 

are practical and reliable remedies that have been in use for years among 
successful stockmen and many of them I use and prescribe in my own 
practice. 

Though the purchaser may have other stock bqoks in the home, I 
believe this work will be found worth many times the price paid for it, as 
it is really in answer to the quarter of a million inquiries sent me during 
the last thirty years by both the farmers and veterinarians of the United 
States and Canada and consequently contains much practical information not 
found in other books in general use among stockmen. 

It was my original plan to keep everything of a " personal " nature out 
of the book, but the publishers have convinced me that the public desire to 
know something of the author and his " practical experience " and for 
this reason I have occasionally cited personal experiences where I thought 
the purpose would be better served or the point made clearer. It has been 
my aim to make this book full and complete for practical use and yet I 
have endeavored to condense it as much as possible by giving in one line 
the information that one so often has to search through many pages to dis- 
cover. I trust that it will be found complete and reliable and yet simple 
and practical.

THE HOSS. 



Love the Hoss from hoof to head, 
From head to hoof and tail to mane. 
I love the Hoss, as I have said, 
From bead to hoof and back again. 



I love my God the fust of all, 
Then him that perished on the Cross; 
And next my wife and then I fall 
Down on my knees and love the Hoss. 
— James Whitcomb Riley,

DR. FAIR DICTATING LETTERS TO STOCK OWNERS. 
Four times a day the mail brings numerous inquiries from all parts of the United 
States and Canada pertaining to the ailments of live stock. Many of these letters 
are from readers of this book and subscribers to "The Ohio Farmer" and "The Michi- 
gan Farmer." It is not unusual for Dr. Fair to receive fifty or one hundred letters of 
this kind daily.

CONFORMATION AND GOOD POINTS, ALSO DEFECTS AND 

BLEMISHES. 

CONFORMATION AND GOOD POINTS. 

The head should not be too large but with considerable width between 
the eyes. The eye should show but little white, have a mild expression and 
be clear and well developed. The face should be lean ; the nostrils large and 
somewhat open and the muzzle should not be too large but there should 
be considerable width between the angles of the lower jaw. The ears should 
be carried erect and be of moderate size. The neck should be long, narrow, 
arched and moderately deep. The shoulders should be well developed and 
considerably wider than the neck. The elbows should not turn in and the 
arm should be long and quite muscular. The knee should be broad in front. 
tapering back, but straight, for if too far back it resembles a cow's leg and 
if too far forward the horse is knee sprung. The shin bone should be flat 
and wide from front to back ; the fetlock should be large and the fetlocks 
should stand at an angle with the floor of about 45 or 50 degrees. The foot 
should not be too small and should be shaped like a bell. " The fore part of 
the shoulder should afford a comfortable resting placie for the collar and the 
withers should be strong, well developed, and not too round. The breast 
should be full and wide; the chest should be large; the body should not be 
too slender; the back should not be too long or too low (sway back) and 
the loin should be well developed. The last rib should come well back. 
The hips should be wide, muscular, and not drooped too much. The tail 
should be wide at dock, tapering, and muscular; it should also be carried 
away from the body. The hind quarters should come close together, espe- 
cially around the anus. The quarters stiould be thick and muscular and the 
thigh heavy and tapering downward. The hock should be broad, clean and 
flat; a short, flat shin bone is preferable; the fetlock should be strong and 
not set too far forward; the pastern should be of medium length and the 
foot not too small. 

DEFECTS AND BLEMISHES 
Defects and blemishes are the result of either predisposing (hereditary) 
or exciting causes, showing on the external parts of the body. For con- 
venience they may be classified as diseases of the bones, synovial mem- 
branes, muscles, tendons, ligaments, skin and also diseases of the foot.

BREAKING, TRAINING AND HAN- 
DLING HORSES. 

(Including Their Feeding and Care.) 

BREAKING AND TRAINING.— The most successful horse breakers 
and trainers are level-headed, good-natured and thoughtful men and they 
make a study of every particular colt or horse that comes under their care 
for instruction. They believe in subduing the animal by kindness rather than 
by force ; they also know that it is important to teach certain lessons first, also 
to get on good terms with the animal. 

THE FIRST LESSON. — In order that the work may be accomplished 
easily a colt should be halter broke when it is a few days old, or not allowed 
to go longer than two or three weeks. Put a halter on the colt and lead the 
mare and the colt with her. Lead the colt short distances to and from the 
mare and also in a circle within her view. Teach him the word to stop and 
start, lift up his feet, open his mouth, avoid frightening him, don't use the 
whip as it is unnecessary. Handle him often enough so that he will not forget 
his lessons or acquaintance with you. When halter breaking him teach him 
to stand tied and be sure to use a halter that he cannot break, for if he learns 
the habit of breaking loose he soon becomes a halter puller. It is not a bad 
plan to tie the halter strap to the collar of his mother's harness ; this teaches 
him to walk with her and also to start and to stop when the words are spoken 
to her. The older and stronger a colt is when you attempt to halter break 
him, the more force must be used ; besides, it takes more time and he is more 
likely to get hurt. 

BITTING A COLT. — This is one of the most important parts of his edu- 
cation, for if he is bitted properly he will drive kindly all his life ; therefore, ' 
plenty of time should be given to this part of his education. A bridle with 
a smooth bar or snaffle bit should be placed in his mouth, not too high up, 
and should be left on him several hours a day before he is reined up. As soon 
as he does not fight the bit it will do to drive him with a harness and teach 
him to be guided with the lines. After he has become accustomed to this 
sort of work hitch him to a break cart and be sure to put on a kicking strap. 
The harness and cart should be strong enough so that it will not break if he 
plunges or stumbles or attempts to run away. • A hopple on one foot with a 
rope attached to it, held in the hand of an assistant, will prevent his running 
away. The length of time it takes to teach him to drive kindly in harness 
depends very much upon how thorough his former training has been, but 
if he is nicely bitted and obeys the word it will not take more than a few days ; 
however, the colt should be driven slowly several miles every day Until he is 
thoroughly broken. It is always a mistake to commence the education of a 
colt and then not continue it daily until completed. 

HOW TO SADDLE BREAK A COLT.— First of all, let him wear 
either a saddle or a dummy with a bitting rig, then he becomes accustomed 
to something on his back. If necessary dress up a dummy man or woman, 
put it on his back and lead him around for a few days until he becomes accus- 



4 THE PEOPLE'S HOME STOCK BOOK. 

tomed to the sight of a person on his back ; then, when he becomes quiet and 
appears to pay no attention to the dummy, a light person can safely ride him. 
Many colts are frightened when a person attempts to mount them ; this is for 
want of proper lessons in the stall where they should all be given to under- 
stand they are not going to be hurt. Another mistake that is frequently 
made when teaching a colt to ride is the rider's using spurs instead of the 
words or a gentle tap with the whip. When first mounting a colt outdoors, 
have him hitched to a post and get off and on frequently until he understands 
that he should stand still until you are safely seated. 

EDUCATING HORSES. — When we consider what remarkable mem- 
ories horses possess and what respect they have for man if treated kindly by 
him, we should not feel discouraged at the simple task of teaching horses to 
stand without hitching, stop and start when they are told, quicken and slow 
thdr gait at the word, go to the right or left when asked and to back 
when told, without the use of reins. During my younger days when on a 
stock farm in Canada I broke steers to drive and work and also colts, and 
since then have owned a great many thousand horses and have used several 
different ones almost every day of my life. Nearly all of them have a differ- 
ent disposition but by kindness I have managed to control them by word. An 
animal should be talked to but not foolishly. Say to them what you want 
them to do, show them how, then it is only a question of a sufficient number 
of lessons when they will do what they are told. I have owned horses that 
could be driven with perfect safety through the streets of a city without 
bridle, bit or reins; they were under control and had never been misused or 
abused. I know hundreds of teamsters that are on good terms with their 
horses all the time and it seems a pleasure for their horses to obey their 
commands. I had the pleasure of stabling at my hospital the wonderful, 
educated horse " Jim Key." During the two weeks that the horse was under 
my care I was afforded a splendid opportunity to study and test his intelli- 
gence. Dr. Key, who raised and educated him, told me that it required some 
five or six years to teach him what he knew; it was all done by kindness 
and patience. The doctor built on his farm in Tennessee a large school 
room and allowed no one else to even feed or attempt to instruct the horse. 
In educating animals the teacher must be thoughtful, intelligent and kind or 
he will prove a failure in this line of work. 

HOW TO SUBDUE VICIOUS HORSES.— The different professional 
horse trainers and tamers who were the most successful in handling vicious 
horses did so by firmness and kindness, but usually they did it by different 
methods of restraint, such as using bits and roping them and casting them 
frequently until the animal became subdued, then the trainer resorted to 
strategy and kindness. Nearly all the readers of this book must have heard 
of the Rarey and Gleason methods of restraint and education of vicious and 
tricky horses. They applied a bridle that would stay on, used different kinds 
of bits for different animals and had a very simple method of throwing them, 
but their plan was to keep right at an animal until the brute weakehed and 
surrendered to them, then they took him step by step until the animal under- 
stood that the trainer was not going to hurt him, and I might say right here 
that a timid, cowardly person is wholly unfit to handle and subdue vicious, 
willful horses. In handling a vicious horse the trainer must possess marked 
intuitiveness and be able to interpret the thoughts of the horse. Further, he 
must use methods of control which protect himself against injury. If the 



HORSE— BREAKING, TRAINING AND HANDLING. 5 

horse has not first been subdued and is well under control he should be 
hitched to a cart that he cannot easily break. Just think how many years 
Rarey, Gleason and others were engaged in this piost hazardous business and 
they were seldom hurt. If handling a colt that is not halter broke, put him 
in a. small enclosure, bridle him, move him from side to side and around the 
stall or pen, then throw him down; some time later let him up. This soon 
quiets the colt's fears and he learns quickly that he is not going to be hurt. 
Handle him when down, not forgetting to fuss with his head and legs. Let 
him see a harness and saddle, then move it over his body and legs and con- 
tinue at this until he becomes familiar with the sight and feeling of the 
harness. It must be understood when handling vicious horses or breaking 
colts to lead, drive and ride that they should be given several .lessons a day 
and kept at it until they drive kindly. TSIow, in taming some ugly colts and 
horses it is well to strap up one forefoot and make them stand for a time 
on three legs or hopple the forelegs together above the knee or use trotting 
or pacing hopples to prevent their striking, kicking or running away. It is 
also no bad plan to buckle a strap around the pastern or one forefoot, hitch 
a rope or strap to it and pass it through a ring fastened to the surcingle or 
belly girth and then if he attempts to run away you can bring him to grief 
at once by pulling up on one forefoot and making him stand on three legs. 
Many a vicious colt has been subdued by making him stand for hours during 
the day with one foot up but of course letting it down occasionall)-. A stub- 
born or sulky disposittoned horse is very often benefited by a few good 
lashes with a whip that stings, this should be done more with a view of caus- 
ing pain. However, as I have said before, a whip, if used at all, should be 
handled by a level headed person for I find that many horses are ruined in 
disposition and their value depreciated by the reckless use of whips. There 
should always be the right sort of an understanding between horse and 
driver and when tlfis exists the work goes on nicely without balking and 
sulking. A stubbern, sulky horse, when he refuses to pull or to go when told 
should have his attention called away from his load; this is accomplished in 
various ways ; sometimes a handful of food, a loud noise, a drink of water, a 
handful of sand placed in the mouth or a little water dropped in the ears will 
produce the desired results. Remember, you cannot pound brains into a horse. 
CASTING. — In performing painful surgical operations it is sometimes 
necessary to cast the horse. This can be done in a great many different ways 
and it makes little diflference which method is employed when throwing 
young colts or horses, but old horses should be cast with caution for fear of 
fracturing their backs. It always makes a difference which method is to be 
used according to what sort of an operation is to be performed. For castra- 
tion the side-line is the least expensive and most convenient method. This 
consists in using a long piece of rope with a loop in the center which is used 
for a collar, passing the two ends down between the forelegs and either 
round the back part of the pastern or through the eye of a hopple, then pass- 
ing it on the outside of body through the loop. Assistants should be at the 
head of the animal and one or two pulling on each rope soon puts the colt 
down, then he is tied by one-half hitches over both hind and forefeet. Another 
common method is' hoppling, which consists in placing one hopple round each 
pastern then commencing at one fore quarter, passing the rope through hop- 
ple eye of each hopple, then pulling the forefeet together until the horse 
falls. An assistant should be stationed at the head. Another simple method 



6 THE PEOPLE'S HOME STOCK BOOK. 

is tying up one forefoot, passing a strap around pastern of opposite forefoot, 
then pulling up the foot. The horse, dropping on his knees, soon gets tired 
of this position and lies down. When on his knees, the halter strap should 
be passed along the opposite side of the neck over the shoulder and pulled 
firmly until the nose is pulled around on neck or shoulder and if held in this 
position for a short time he is inclined to roll over toward you. This is 
a one-man method employed by Mr. Magnen The Rarey method differs by 
pulling up the opposite hind foot as well as the opposite forefoot and when 
this is done it is convenient to use a surcingle with ring to pull straps 
through. There are many other methods which are equally simple and about 
as effectual. However, space will not permit o£ my mentioning more. 

KICKING IN HARNESS.— This is a habit or vice that is usually the 
result of poor horsemanship, improper breaking of colts or allowing horses 
to remain idle 'so long that they become playful and foolish, Commencing the 
habit and apparently forgetting to discontinue it. I can safely say that many 
colts are not bitted properly and accustomed to the harness before they are 
hitched to a wagon and it is not surprising that some of the high-lifed or 
sulky, bad tempered colts or horses should take to kicking when in harness. 
There is another kind; namely, nervous ticklish animals that are allowed to 
go with their head down low and when frightened or startled commence 
kicking. 

REMEDY. — In my judgment there would be few kickers if colts were 
handled young, bitted properly and driven about with the lines before they, 
are hitched to a vehicle. When hitched. they should be hooked to a cart and 
a kicking strap applied to prevent their kicking. After a thorough education 
of this kind and at the same time checking the head up reasonably high to 
prevent the raising of the hind quarters very high, few horses would attempt 
to kick in double harness. Most kickers that kick in single harness have first 
contracted the habit when double or when hitched to a cart without kicking 
strap or to a cart that was too light and broke to pieces when the cplt ran 
away. It is time well spent to bit a colt a few weeks before you attempt 
to drive him single or double. Colts very often break in very easily if first 
driven with their mother while they are young and I might add that every 
colt should be broken when he is a year old or younger. By doing this fewer 
accidents happen and less force has to be used. Besides, much valuable time 
is saved for a young colt breaks more easily than an old one. 

KICKING WHILE EATING GRAIN— KICKING IN STALL.— This 

is a habit that is contracted from the animal's being overfed and under exer- 
cised ; also, nervous horses seem to soon pick up the habit from the horse in 
the next stall so that it is not unusual to find several idle horses kicking, one 
after the other, or several at the same time. Horses kept in single stalls are 
most likely to kick the stall and kick while eating grain. 

REMEDY. — Give the animal plenty of exercise or moderate work; 
buckle or fasten a strap around each pastern of. the hind leg attaching to it 
twelve or fourteen inches of chain; or, harness him with either trotting or 
pacing hopples. Hoppling the hind legs together twelve or fourteen inches 
apart, with hopple- applied above hock, works fairly well and very often 
shifting a stall kicker to a dififerent part of the stable where he will have 
quieter associates seems to have a good efifect. It is not unusual to find mares 
kicking the stall while in heat, if they" are teased by their neighbor. I have 



HORSE— BREAKING, TRAINING AND HANDLING. 7 

known mares that were inveterate kickerSj the result of disease or an ab- 
normal condition of the generative organs. In these cases spaying is the 
only successful remedy. 

BALKING. — Balking is when a horse refuses to go when told or ui^ed 
to do so. There are two general causes; namely, exciting and predisposing. 
The exciting causes are decidedly numerous — ^yes, there are hundreds of 
them, while the predisposing causes are perhaps few. However, the two 
causes are many times closely associated, as for instance a quick, high-lifed, 
nervous, energetic colt in the hands of a nervoys, excitable, poor horseman ; 
and attempting to use the colt for slow heavy work is very likely to fret and 
discourage both colt and driver. Besides, over-loading young uneducated 
horses during the muddy or snowy season and pulling this heavy load up 
hill, especially if the haul is long, is quite likely to make a balky colt. Using 
harsh bits that make the mouth sore, using bad-fitting collars that hurt the 
shoulders, working a spirited horse with a lazy sluggish one, reining the 
head up too high and jerking and abusing a willing, true puller, have a tend- 
ency to discourage him and make him balky. Punishing a horse when he is 
■unable to pull the load and whipping him when he is doing his best are al- 
ways remembered. Horses have great memories. I have no hesitation in 
saying that for want of knowledge, a level head and a smooth temper 
drivers are responsible for spoiling the disposition and discouraging nearly 
every balky horse. An excitable horse should not be driven or worked by an 
excitable person. Light driving and road work should be done with light 
horses. 

REMEDY. — Ascertain the cause and when a horse balks attract his 
attention away from what he is thinking about but treat him kindly. Coax 
him into pulling the load or starting on his journey. Place some sand in his 
mouth or drop a little water in his ears. Place a twitch on either lip or ear 
and he may pull. Or, tie a rope around his flank, hitch it to his mate and 
when he goes the balky fellow is likely to follow. There are hundreds of 
ways of controlling a balky horse, but kindness and strategy on the part of 
the driver overcome every balky horse or mule. 

CRIB BITING— WIND SUCKING.— This is not a disease, but a vice 
or bad habit, perhaps the result of indigestion, pain in the jaw or teeth, but 
the greatest number of cases I have traced have been contracted by imita- 
tion when. the animal was idle. Wind sucking is usually the result of crib 
biting after it has been kept up for a certain length of time. The swallowing 
of air is accomplished by the animal's taking hold of some hard substance, 
then dropping the neck and allowing air to fill a vacuum in the pharynx. 
This air later passes into the stomach and on into the bowels. 

TREATMENT. — Put the horse in a box stall or a stall with smooth par- 
.titions and without any manger and oblige him to eat out of an oval-shaped 
cement or metal box resting on the floor. If he sucks wind wear a muzzle on 
him when he is not eating. Mangers covered with metal or smeared with 
oflFensive drugs, such as aloes, coal-tar disinfectants or red pepper have a 
tendency to prevent their cribbing. In pure wind suckers a strap may be 
tied tightly around the upper part of the neck. This will prevent the horse 
filling himself with air. However, I have known horses to become roarers 
from wearing a strap buckled tightly around their neck to prevent wind 
sucking. 

HALTER BREAKING AND HALTER PULLING.— When colts are 



8 THE PEOPLE'S HOME STOCK BOOK 

a few weeks old and before they get strong every one of them should be 
halter broken and this is most easily accomplished when the colt is first led 
with its mother. The second lesson should be by leading the colt in a circle 
within sight of its mother, either in a stall or paddock and I have always 
thought it was a mistake to be in a hurry and try to teach the colt too much 
in a minute. However, a colt can be halter broken in two or three days so that 
he can be led about like an old horse if good judgment is used on the part 
of the teacher. Older colts require more time to teach to lead, but whenever 
they are taken in hand the work should be persisted in until the ends are 
accomplished. Halter pullers are usually made by using halters that are 
easily broken. The habit is usually acquired through fright and the careless 
tying of young horses or colts. I have found it a good plan to use a strong, 
well fitting halter and to tie them short and high up, as this -gives the horse 
less power to break loose. Another plan is to use a long rope, passing it 
around the body at the flanks with a slip knot, passing it under or alongside 
of the body through a ring in surcingle and up through a halter or neck 
strap and then hitching it to the manger or a post, and then after the colt 
makes a few attempts to break loose he will give it up as a bad job and per- 
haps discontinue the habit. However, it is not a good plan to take this rope 
off too soon. Another plan is to buckle a 'hopple around the foreleg either 
above or below the knee, sli(^e this through a neck strap or halter and hitch 
him to the manger or post and he will not break loose. 

EXAMINATION FOR SOUNDNESS.— In buying a horse it is well 
to know whether he is sound or unsound for if not sound his value must de- 
preciate. In order to tell whether he is sound or not, you must be thorough 
and keep in mind the necessity of looking him all over. Watch him closely 
in the stable— he may crib bite or have some vice or may point a foot or rest 
one leg. He may come out of the stall lame but the lameness may soon dis- 
appear. Trot him on hard footing, examine his eyes closely, look at his 
mouth to see how old he is, pick up his feet, watch his breathing, look into 
his mouth for diseased teeth, test his wind by giving him a brisk gallop, back 
him out of the stall and watch for stringhalt and chorea, see that his feet are 
of even size and that he has no thrush. Tap his feet for corns and tender 
spots, look into his nostrils and examine the eyes closely to see that they are 
alike. Go over every part of the body carefully. See that there are no splints, 
ring-bones, spavins, curbs, bog-spavins or thoroughpins. Stand him on a 
level floor or piece of ground, then step to one side and notice if he is knee 
sprung. Also stand behind him and observe whether his hips are alike. 
Notice if his respiration is normal, also use enough pressure on the throat to 
make him cough. If he has a moist cough think little about it, but if he has 
a harsh, dry, hacking cough it is perhaps chronic and possibly bad enough to 
condemn him. Trot him both to and from you on hard footing, letting him 
have the free use of his head; also trot him in a circle for some horses will 
show lameness only when turning. If you are buying him for work, insist 
on seeing him hitched and test«his pulling qualities. It is well to notice 
whether the mane is roughened from wearing a collar, also look for harness 
marks. It is always suspicious to find no evidence of harness marks. If 
you are going to use him for road work give him a good sharp drive, also 
be sure to give him a brisk gallop to test his wind. 

TEETH AND HOW TO TELL A HORSE'S AGE.— The teeth are, of 
course, the principal agents used in the process of mastication, besi les afford- 



HORSE— BREAKING, TRAINING AND HANDLING. 9 

ing a means of telling a horse's age. A tooth is divided into three parts — 
crown, neck and fang and is formed of three substances — enamel, dentine and 
crusta petrosa. There is a cavity in the fang called the pulp cavity, extending 
up into the neck. This cavity is largely supplied with fibers and blood 
vessels, also with nerves. This cavity, however, disappears as the animal 
grows older. It is surrounded with nearly thirty per cent, of animal matter 
and about seventy per cent, of earthy matter. This accounts for the teeth 
being harder than bone. Dentine develops from the pulp, but in very old 
animals the teeth are composed entirely of earthy material and, I might add, 
are the hardest material of the body. The teeth are of three classes. Incisors, 
tusks or canine teeth, and molars or grinders. The teeth in the upper jaw 
are always wider than in the lower. The horse is provided with temporary 
teeth at first and later with permanent teeth, having twenty-four temporary, 
twelve molars and twelve incisors. He has forty permanent teeth. On 
the table or wearing surface of the incisors there are cavities and these 
cavities form the best means of telling a horse's age. The temporary teeth 
are white, have a well marked neck, and are narrow; while the permanent 
teeth are always darker in color and wider; besides, as they wear down they 
become more upright. When a colt is foaled it usually has four front teeth — 
two above and two below. However, if they are not seen at birth they 
usually appear in ten or twenty days. From four to six weeks later four 
more appear close to the others and some six- months later the other four 
corner teeth appear, making six above and six below, and this is the full set 
of incisor teeth. The only change that takes place up to two and one-half 
years is that the surface of the teeth become smoother. Now between two 
and a half and three years the four temporary teeth are shed and permanent 
ones take their place, and when from three to four years old, the four central 
incisors are shed and from four and a half to five years old the corner incisor 
teeth are shed and the permanent ones take their place. Sometimes a horse 
will have a full mouth when four and a half years old. The mouth of a two- 
year old resembles somewhat that of a five-year old. However, the teeth of 
the two-year old are always whiter and narrower and a two-year old never 
has bridle teeth. The foal at birth usually has twelve temporary molars. 
The first permanent grinder teeth appear when the colt is about twelve or 
thirteen months old. The next appear six or eight months later and at about 
three and half years old the fifth appears taking its place third in the jaw 
and very soon afterwards the sixth appears, and when four years old the 
colt has a full set of permanent molar teeth. The bridle teeth appear be- 
tween four and five years old then the horse has a complete set of permanent 
teeth. At the age of six years the marks in the central lower incisors are 
pretty well gone, at seven the central lower, at eight the surface of the lower 
row of nippers is almost perfectly smooth and there is a small hook on each 
of the upper corner incisors. At nine years the mark is worn out of the 
two central upper teeth, at ten it is out of the next ones and at eleven the 
upper row of teeth is worn smooth. After this the incisors begin to project 
forward, become narrower from side to sidb and broaden from the four back 
ones and are almost round at the age of twelve. At thirteen years of age 
the central lower nippers are nearly round -and at fourteen years nearly all 
the incisors of the lower jaw are round. When fifteen years old the central 
upper nippers are almost round, in fact all the upper nippers have assumed 
that shape. At sixteen years the middle ones are nearlv round, measuring 



10 THE PEOPLE'S HOME STOCK BOOK. 

but little more in depth than they do in breadth. Now, at seventeen years of 
age the incisors of the upper jaw have become almost round. However, the 
middle teeth are a little deeper than they are broad. At eighteen years the 
lower incisors become a little more triangular in shape and somewhat deeper 
than they are wide. At nineteen years we find the middle teeth of the lower 
jaw triangular in shape and not quite so wide, but perhaps a little deeper, and 
at twenty years the whole six lower incisor teeth have become triangular in 
shape. Besides, they are usually somewhat irregular. 

PROPER FOOD AND FEEDING. — In feeding animals, especially the 
young, it must be remembered that milk that comes from the mother is a 
balanced ration and if the. young colt has plenty of it and meets with no mis- 
hap or sickness he grows evenly and every part of the body seerns to be 
nourished properly. Then after weaning time, the diet must be of such a 
j nature as to take the place of milk. Colts or calves should be fed some 
' ground oats while sucking the mother so that when weaned they will eat 
t hay, grass, grain, vegetables and fodder. H left to their own choice, where 
' they, have access to a variety of food stuffs it is astonishing to see them nib- 
bling a little of them all; This is a hint to us to supply their wants, for while 
they are making their own selections their entire body is growing not only 
rapidly but evenly. Growing young stock are not always fed a sufficient 
quantity of nutritious food to keep them growing ; besides, too many of them 
are fed the same kind of food during the entire winter months and nothing 
but grass during the summer season and of course this is a mistake. The 
common food for horses in this country and Canada is hay, straw, corn- 
fodder, grass, roots, oats, corn and rye but in some other countries they are 
fed on much the same kind of food that man eats and I am told they thrive 
on it. In the selection of food for horses it should be of good quality and 
not too bulky, for the stomach of a horse is small, hence the necessity of 
supplying him with grain as well as fodder if he is working. Hay, straw and 
corn-fodder should be fed first for it passes out of the stomach more quickly 
than grain and if hay or fodder is fed last some of the grain must leave with 
it instead of remaining in the stomach to be digested. Furthermore, a horse 
should be watered before he is fed grain for fear that the water will wash 
the grain into the bowel before it has been properly digested. If hungry 
horses are fed bulky food first, they eat it slower than if fed grain and it does 
them more good, and feeding this way also prevents their swallowing the 
grain whole. Indigestion is very often the result of feeding tired, exhausted 
horses too soon after their day's work is over especially if they are fed cut 
feed and chopped feed that has much corn mixed with it. Of course it may do 
but little harm when fed in cold weather but during hot sultry weather it 
usually disturbs digestion, ending sometimes in death. Too sudden a change 
of diet is somewhat dangerous if a large quantity of rich nutritious food i§ 
supplied to an animal unaccustomed to it. 

PROPER SHOEING. 

These rules are recommended by the Instructors of the United States 
Government Training School for Farriers and Horseshoers at Fort Riley, 
Kansas. 

The following rules may serve as a guide for the shoeing of healthy feet : 
1. The wall, being the weight bearer, should be rasped perfectly level 



HORSE— CARE OF SICK AND INJURED. 11 

or the foot will be thrown out of its true position, causing extra strain on 
some of the ligaments. 

2. Fit the shoe accurately to the outline of the foot; do not alter the 
latter to fit the shoe. Rasping away the exterior of the crust to fit the shoe 
not only renders the horn brittle but is so much loss of bearing surface. 

3. The sole should not be touched with the knife; loose flakes may be 
removed with a blunt instrument. 

4. The bars should not be cut away; they are a part of the wall and 
are intended to carry weight. The shoe should rest on them. 

5. The frog should not be cut, but left to attain its full growth. No 
frog can perform its functions unless on a level v^ith the ground surface of 
the shoe. 

6. The shoe should have a true and level bearing and rest well and 
firmly on the wall and bars. A plain light-weight shoe is the best — plain on 
both ground and foot surface. 

7. High nailing is injurious; do not use any more nails than are abso- 
lutely necessary, as the nails destroy the horn. 

STABLE MANAGEMENT OF THE SICK AND INJURED. 

<(In treating of the management and care of sick and injured horses we will 
quote largely from the instructors of the Government Training School.) 



Care of the Sick. 

The sick horse should, if practicable, be immediately removed to a large, 
clean, light and well ventilated box stall, free from drafts and located as far 
as possible from other horses. Clean bedding should be provided, and the 
stall kept free from manure and moisture. If such a stall can not be pro- 
vided a double stall, with the kicking bar removed and ropes or bars placed 
across the front of it, will answer the purpose. 

If the patient is suffering from a febrile disease (fever) during the cold 
season of the year, paulins or horse covers can be hung up in such a manner 
as to serve as a protection from drafts, care being taken to allow sufficient 
air to enter this improvised box stall. Such patients must be clothed accord- 
ing to the season of the year, the blanket drawn well forward on the neck 
and fastened in front, the legs, after hand-rubbing, bandaged with flannels. 
The bandages should be changed several times daily and the legs thor- 
oughly rubbed to stimulate circulation. 

Horses with diseases of the nervous system require to be kept absolutely 
quiet, and must be removed as far as possible from all noise. It is prefer- 
able that only one man be allowed to attend to their wants, as a change of 
attendants would very likely cause excitement and thus increase the severity 
of the disease. Animals suffering from debilitating diseases should be 
tempted with and fed any food that is rich in nourishment and easily di- 
gested. Salt should frequently be added. The food, etc., should be given 
only in such quantities as the animal will readily eat, and any portion left 
over should be at once removed, as food constantly remaining before a sick ani- 
mal will have a tendency to deprive it of all appetite. Food that is wet, such 
as bran mashes or steamed oats, will soon solir in warm weather and will 



13 THE PEOPLE'S HOME STOCK BOOK. 

get cold or may freeze during the winter ; if eaten in these conditions it may- 
cause diarrhea, colic, etc. Feed boxes, water buckets, and all parts of the 
stall must be kept clean and free from odor. The hay should be clean and 
bright, and only the best given to the sick animal. Pure water should be 
provided and, placed in such a position as to enable the animal to reach it 
without difficulty; a sick horse will frequently rinse the lips and mouth with 
water if given the opportunity, even when not thirsty. The water should 
be changed as often as necessary during the day to insure a pure and fresh 
supply at all times. 

A horse suffering from colic requires sufficient space, well bedded, to 
prevent injuring himself by rolling over during a spasm of pain. A man 
should be constantly in attendance, as there is danger that the animal may 
become cast and be unable to get up without assistance. 

Undigested matter being the exciting cause in almost all cases of coHc, 
food should be withheld for about twelve hours after all pain has disappeared, 
and then given only in small quantities during the next twenty-four hours, 
after which the ordinary ration may be resumed. A few swallows of pure 
water may be given at short intervals, but special care must be taken when 
the water is very cold. 

The pulse is the beating of the arteries, usually felt at the jaw (the 
submaxillary artery), and is an important guide in determining the physical 
condition of the animal; the normal pulsations are about 40 per minute. The 
count is best taken by placing the fore or middle finger transversely on the • 
artery. The slightest excitement, when the horse is sick, will cause an alter- 
ation in the pulse, therefore the animal should be approached very quietly. 
A strong and full pulse is an indication of health. 

In the first stages of fever the pulse is full and bounding, afterwards be- 
coming small and weak. A very slow pulse denotes disease or injury of the 
brain or spinal cord. An imperceptible pulse indicates the approach of death. 

At rest the heajthy horse breathes from 13 to 15 times per minute. Diffi- 
cult or rapid breathing is a prominent symptom of disease of the respiratory 
organs; it may also be observed in some cases of flatulent colic. Abdominal 
breathing is the respiratory movement performed with the ribs fixed as much 
as possible, owing to pain or mechanical obstruction in the chest, and is a 
symptom of pleurisy and hydrothorax (water in the chest). 

Irregular breathing is that condition where there is a want of harmon- 
ious correspondence between the inspiratory and expiratory movements, and 
/is observed in the disease commonly known as " broken wind " or " heaves." 
The inspiratory movement in this affection is performed quickly and with 
a jerky effc5rt, while the expiratory movement is performed slowly and with 
a double action, more particularly of the abdominal muscles. Irregular breath- 
ing often becomes spasmodic or convulsive during the progress of the disease. 
The condition and color of the visible mucous membranes should be closely 
observed ; as will be learned in detail later, they are an important guide in 
determining the physical condition of the animal. 

The normal temperature of the horse in the internal part which is most 
easily accessible, the rectum, may be estimated at from 99 degrees to 101 
degrees F. In very young animals the temperature is commonly about 101 
degrees, but in very old ones it has been known to be as low as 96 degrees F. 
The temperature of the external parts of the bod^'' becomes lower according 



HORSE— CARE OF SICK AND INJURED. 13 

to their distance from the heart, and liable to much variation from the state 
of the surrounding atmosphere. Fever is an elevation of temperature. 

The production of animal heat is due to certain chemical and vital 
changes which are continually taking place in the body; these changes con- 
sist in the absorption of oxygen by the capillaries in the lungs, and the 
combination of that oxygen with the carbon and hydrogen derived (first) 
from the disintegration of animal tissues and (second) from certain elements 
of the food which have not been converted into tissue. 

This combination with oxygen, or oxidation, not only takes place in the 
blood, which may be looked upon as a fluid tissue, but in' the tissue cells 
also, in all parts of the body, the animal heat being maintained by the natural 
changes which are essential to a healthy condition. 

As previously stated, oxygen is absorbed from the air by the capillaries 
of the lungs in respiration (breathing). Expired air is found to have lost 
about 10 per cent, of the oxygen contained in pure air, and to have accu- 
mulated a like amount of a combination of carbon and oxygen, called carbonic 
acid gas. If we imagine the animal breathing and rebreathing the same air, 
it, can be seen that the oxygen, so necessary for the purification of the blood, 
would soon diminish to a dangerous degree. Hence, we realize the importance 
of a large supply of air to draw on and the necessity of good ventilation. At 
each inspiration the horse draws about 250 cubic inches of air into the lungs, 
and he therefore requires about 3 cubic feet per minute, or 120 per hour. It 
is customary, in building ordinary stables, to allow 1,600 cubic feet of air 
space (over twelve hour's supply) for each animal, and to provide means of 
admitting fresh air without causing drafts. In infirmary stables the allow- 
ance is increased to 1,900 cubic feet. 

Without good air the blood is imperfectly purified, the vitality of the 
animal is lessened, he is more susceptible to disease, and will succumb more 
easily when attacked; consequently, horses should never be kept in the 
vicinity of a marsh, the air from which contains an excess of carbonic acid gas 
and a diminshed supply of the necessary oxygen. 

Care of the Injured. 

If the horse is seriously injured and stands with difficulty, he should 
be placed in slings (See Plate) to partially support the weight of the body. 
The slings must be properly adjusted, fitting closely behind the elbows in 
such a manner as to support the weight of the body on the chest and not on 
the abdomen. This position is maintained by the use of the breast piece and 
breeching, which prevent the shifting of the sling. A single stall, having 
a level floor; free from bedding, is more suitable than one allowing more 
motion to the animal. 

If the horse is but slightly injured, there is no necessity of placing him 
in slings. An ordinary stall with a level floor is all that is required. After 
the injury has been dressed he should be allowed to stand without being dis- 
turbed. If very lame, and movement is painful, the more quiet he is kept 
the more quickly will recovery take place. Absolute rest and perfect quietude 
are two very essential things, and when secured they will hasten the process 
of recovery without inflicting unnecessary pain upon the animal. In some 
surgical cases it is necessary to restrain the animal so that he can not injure 
himself by rubbing or biting the aflfected parts. This can be accomplished 
by tying up the head or by the application of side lines. Bandages may be

applied to the legs of animals for different purposes — First, to give support 
to the blood vessels and synovial bursas; second, to dry and warm the legs; 
third, to support packs used in applying hot and cold lotions; and fourth, 
when conditions are favorable, to check hemorrhages. 

Food and Drinks for Sick Horses. 

Water Supply. — However harmless impure water may have been to animals 
in a wild state, the more we subject them to an artificial existence the more 
we remove them from the immunity they may have possessed against com- 
mon causes of disease and the greater liability is there for the development of 
causes of disease and the greater liability is there for the development of 
diseases which originally may never have existed. In other words, the do- 
mesticated animals should always have pure water; when the vitality is 
further reduced by sickness the necessity of absolute purity is even more 
imperative. 

Hay Tea. — Fill a tub with a good quality of hay, pack it down closely 
and cover it with boiling water, then cover the tub and keep it in a warm 
place for fifteen or twenty minutes and if the water evaporates add some more 
cold water. Hay tea is refreshing to a horse. 

How to Make Gruel. — Stir either a quart of corn meal or oat meal into 
a gallon and a half or two gallons of cold water, allowing it to stand for an 
hour or two, then give it as> a drink. 

How to Make Bran Mashes. — Take four or five quarts of fresh bran, add* 
a tablespoonful or two of salt, pour on boiling water until the bran is cov- 
ered with the water then cover with a cloth to keep in the steam and surround 
the bucket with some straw or cloth to keep it warm or place it in a 
warm room and allow it to stand for two hours. If the horse is not inclined 
to eat it add a few oats. This is a very good meal for heavy work horses,. 
Wednesday and Sunday evenings, to keep the bowels open. 

How to Give a Horse Medicine. 
Medicine is given to a horse most conveniently in feed, or with a syringe, 
or as a drench out of a wine or whiskey bottle. The head is easily held up by 
fastening a strap or rope in the nose piece of the halter, then passing through 
a ring or pulley or over a beam. Pour the contents of the bottle slowly into 
the mouth, bu.t never pull out the tongue or pinch the throat. It is a mistake 
to hold the head too high and decidedly dangerous to drench a horse through 
the nose. Many times it becomes necessary to give medicine by injecting it 
into the bowel or to give it with a hypodermic syringe. Medicine can be easily 
given to a horse in pill oi- bolus form and balling guns are useful for this pur- 
pose but the pill or bolus may be given by taking hold of the tongue with the 
left hand, pulling it well forward, keeping the mouth open with the same hand 
and then placing the ball well back in the mouth and letting go of the tongue 
after the right hand is withdrawn. Medicine in powder form, when not ir- 
ritating or caustic in its action, can be given with a spoon when the tongue is- 
pulled forward with the left hand and mouth kept open with closed hand. 



DISEASES OF THE DIGESTIVE ORGANS. 

(Including Diseases of the Mouth, Stomach, Bowels, Liver, Etc.) 



INDIGESTION. — A simple functional derangement of the digestive 
system is very common in animals, especially the horse which has a small 
stomach. 

CAUSES. — Simple indigestion is very often brought on by eating too 
much bulky food of poor quality. Of course it is true that digestion in the 
horse goes on rapidly for if it did not, with so small a stomach in propor- 
tion to the size of his body, the horse would suffer more from indigestion 
than he does. Sharp uneven teeth, causing the horse to improperly masti- 
cate his food, is another cause of indigestion. 

SYMPTOMS. — The animal usually falls off in condition and becomes 
somewhat emaciated. His coat looks rough and he presents an unthrifty 
appearance. The bowel movements are often irregular. He may show 
some abdominal pain and instead of losing his appetite he will often eat filthy 
things with apparent relish and he very often licks the wall, hunting for lime 
or salt. 

TREATMENT. — There may be an over acidity of the stomach and if so 
the horse will of course be fond of lime or salt. Many home remedies help 
this kind of cases. Salt, lime and very often a small dose of calomel and 
a moderate dose of aloes, or epsom salts, or baking soda and charcoal can be 
given with benefit. A little bit later give quinine, gentian, quassia, sulphate 
of iron or charcoal. If the animal shows much weakness give stimulants. 
Float the teeth if they need it, exercise the horse regularly and be sure to 
change the feed. 
PEOPLE'S HOME REMEDIES FOR INDIGESTION.— 

1. Raw Linseed Oil. — Drench with a quart of raw linseed oil. This 
dose may be repeated if necessary. 

2. Soda, Ginger and Gentian. — Mix equal parts of common baking soda, 
powdered ginger and powdered gentian and give in tablespoonful doses 
twice a day one hour before feeding. This is best given by dissolving in 
half a pint of water and giving as a drench. 

3. Removing Causes. — If the indigestion is caused by sharp and irreg- 
ular or decayed teeth they should be rasped down or extracted. If the horse 
bolts his grain without chewing it properly this can be remedied by feeding 
in a large manger where the grain can be spread out so that he cannot eat 
it so fast. If worms are the cause then a dose of one ounce of aloes or a pint of 
raw linseed oil will prove of service. 

CHRONIC INDIGESTION.— This is a weakened condition of the di- 
gestive organs. 

CAUSES. — This ailment is sometimes associated with functional de- 
rangements of the liver and is often brought on by feeding a horse too many 
oats for too long a time when not exercised. 

SYMPTOMS. — An animal may have indigestion and not show symp- 
toms of sickness; however, his general appearance is not good. He is dull 
and languid, sweats easily and his coat is not glossy. The pulse is too slow, 

15 



16 THE PEOPLE'S HOME STOCK BOOK. 

the membranes yellow, appetite irregular and sometimes there is sorne diar- 
rhea. There is a desire for salt and an inclination to lick lime and dirt. 

TREATMENT. — Find out the cause and remove it. Change the feed, 
open the bowels and give ginger, soda, charcoal, gentian, cinchona, or any- 
home digestive remedy. 

ACUTE INDIGESTION. — This is an ailment caused by eating too 
much of the wrong kind of food, eating it too fast, improperly masticating 
it and failing to digest it quickly. During hot weather a great many draft 
horses die of acute indigestion by its producing rupture of the stomach or 
bowels, or pressure against the diaphragm. 

CAUSES. — Perhaps the most common cause is subjecting a horse to 
hard work or fast driving too soon after eating a hearty meal. Another very 
common cause is watering horses after they have eaten grain. The follow- 
ing foods seem to be most likely to cause it : wheat, barley, Indian corn and 
many kinds of green food. Also, the atmosphere seems tq exert a peculiar 
influence in causing acute indigestion. For example, in my practice and at 
my hospital some days I have had not less than twenty cases and many other 
days none at all. This, I might say, is the experience of many other veter- 
inarians. 

SYMPTOMS. — The animal usually becomes dull and sluggish, soon 
showing a slight uneasiness, turning the head to one side seemingly suffering 
more pain. These pains are often spasmodic. However, later they become 
more continuous and the abdomen enlarges. The eructations of gas or*the 
passage of gas through the rectum are favorable indications. Sometimes 
there is regurgitation of food, but this will be found in more extreme cases. 
The animal very often perspires, has slight diarrhea and rolls and tumbles 
violently. If the anus is reddened much and the pulse is weak and quick it 
is unfavorable. Also, if the animal staggers or reels or falls back upon his 
haunches it is an indication that he will not recover. 

TREATMENT. — In all cases of acute indigestion the treatment should 
be prompt to be effective. Give one ounce aromatic spirits of ammonia in 
one pint of cold water and repeat in thirty minutes; or, give three ounces 
hypo-sulphite of soda in one pint of water and repeat in one hour. Another 
remedy is three drams of salicylic acid in one-half pint raw linseed oil and 
repeated in two hours if necessary. Or, you may give one-half ounce tur- 
pentine in twelve ounces raw linseed oil and repeat in one hour if necessary. 
Give injections, making them of good soap and warm water; a little sweet 
oil may be added. If, in your judgment, you believe that the gas is increasing 
and has no means of escape, do not hesitate to tap him, using of course the 
horse trocar and canula. The trocar used for the horse should be smaller 
than the one used for the cow. The opening should be made in the right 
flank between the last rib and the point of the hip. Be sure that your in- 
strument has been boiled or dipped in a two per cent, solution of carbolic 
acid and water. (See " Tapping for Bloat.") 

PEOPLE'S HOME REMEDIES FOR BLOATING.— 

1. Soapy Water. — If wind is the cause of the bloating, give injections 
of warm soapy water. 

2. Cayenne Pepper and Ginger. — Put half an ounce of cayenne pepper 
and one ounce of ginger into a pint of warm water and give as a drench as 
quickly as possible.

METHODS OF SECURING THE HORSE WHILE GIVING MEDICINE OR 
PERFORMING AN OPERATION. 




HORSE BACKED IN STALL READY FOR OPERATION. 
A horse may be backed into the stall and secured when necessary to give a 
drench or perform a minor operation. Dr. Fair is about to float (file) the teeth. 
The teeth of every horse should be carefully examined once a year and attended to 
if necessary. 

(Photographed at Dr. Fair's Veterinary Hospital especially for this book.) 




HORSE IN SIMPLY CONSTRUCTED STOCKS READY FOR OPERATION. 
Dr. Fair, with English Sliding Chisel, is about to cut a large abdominal growth 
from a molar tooth. The assistant is handing him a balling iron for keeping the 
horse's mouth open. These stocks are very simple. The horse's legs may be hoppled 
if necessary. 

(Photographed at Dr. Fair's Veterinary Hospital especially for this book.) 



HORSE— DISEASES OF DIGESTIVE ORGANS. S? 

3. Charcoal. — Charcoal will give relief by absorbing the gas. Any 
amount may be given. 

4. Chloride of Lime. — One-hali ounce of chloride of lime will cure 
bloating. 

5. Carbonate of Ammonia. — Give one to two drams of carbonate of 
ammonia. 

6. Linseed Oil or Aloes. — Give from a pint to a quart of raw linseed oil 
or from one-half to an ounce of aloes. Either of these will unload the stomach 
and bowels. 

PUNCTURING TO RELIEVE BLOAT— TAPPING THE LARGE 
BOWEL. — Tapping is a surgical operation that I have been performing suc- 
cessfully for thirty-four years and, so far as I can learn, the puncturing of 
horses to relieve flatulence had never been done successfully prior to this 
date. This discovery grew out of the fact that I was losing so many valuable 
horses from acute indigestion and feeling so badly over the death of one or 
more horses or mules every hot sultry day or evening, caused me to have 
a long, small trocar made and, to my surprise, three out of the first five cases 
I punctured made splendid recoveries and had I not so long delayed operat- 
ing on the other two I am inclined to believe they might also have recovered. 
Never use a large trocar on horses for the operation is likely to prove fatal 
as it makes too large a wound or opening in the bowel. Besides, there is 
greater danger of hemorrhage. When it becomes necessary to puncture, 
the operation should not be put off too long, but should be performed while 
the animal is strong and before rupture has taken place. The trocar should 
not be used until the flank becomes drum-like and before doing so the skin 
should be washed clean with soap and water, then with alcohol or peroxide- 
hydrogen or any other good antiseptic. The operation is usually performed 
on the right side of the animal, but may be done on the left side in cases 
where the left flank is badly distended. The skin should first be cut with 
the lancet or a sharp, clean knife. This is done for the purpose of facilitating 
the entrance of the trocar and canula, but before the trocar is used it should 
be boiled in hot water for ten minutes or dipped in carbolic acid water, one 
part to thirty. The direction should be downward and inward. After pulling' 
out the trocar if no gas comes through the canula you must not be discour- 
aged but should puncture him again. After the gas has all escaped the 
canula may be withdrawn and the wound usually heals by first intention. 
However, in some cases an abscess forms which should be treated as if it 
occurred on any other part of the body. It is a good symptom when pure 
gas comes through the canula and an unfavorable one if fluid passes, as 
this indicates inflammation of the bowels. But I have known scores of 
recoveries to take place even when this dark fluid escaped at the time of 
puncturing. After the operation a dose of laxative medicine may be given. 
The animal should be kept on a light diet for a few days and allowed to rest 
as this is of assistance in bringing about a permanent recovery. Every 
horse owner should keep on hand an instrument of this kind and should not 
hesitate to use it before it is too late, making the opening on the right side 
at the most prominent and distended point in the right flank, which is 
usually in the triangle between the hip and ribs.

eration of gases in the stomach and large intestines the same as in acute in-

digestion. The same treatment will answer very well in either case. There- 
fore, the reader is referred to " acute indigestion," where the causes, symptoms 
and treatment are given. As there stated, treatment should be quite prompt. 
Energetic, diffusible stimulants such as 1 ounce sulphuric ether; aromatic 
spirits of ammonia, 1 to two-ounce doses,; or a dessert spoonful of turpentine 
should be given. Repeat every 2 hours until relief is obtained. Also give 
enemas of warm water' with a small quantity of salt added. I have seen 
excellent results from the use of tobacco injection. After every attack of 
flatulent colic the animal should be kept on a light diet for two or three days 
and the stomach and bowels should be cleaned out with a dose of 1 ounce 
aloes, 1 quart raw linseed oil, or 1 pound epsom salts. Tapping ma:y be 
necessary. 
PEOPLE'S HOME REMEDIES FOR FLATULENT OR WIND COLIC. 

1. Red Pepper Tea. — Give a quart of strong red pepper tea while warm 
and follow in an hour with a pint of raw linseed oil. 

2. Whiskey and Soda. — Give a teaspoonful of common baking soda in 
a pint of whiskey. This may be repeated in one hour if necessary. 

3. Lime or Ammonia. — Give half-ounce doses of chloride of lime every 
half-hour until relieved. Carbonate of ammonia is also good and may be 
used in the same dose. 

4. Charcoal. — Give charcoal every hour in ounce doses to absorb the gas. 

5. Warm Lard. — Drench the horse with 1 pint of warm lard. This is 
a remedy that is nearly always at hand. 

6. Wild Yam. — Give 30 drops of wild yam every fifteen to thirty min- 
utes. This should be given in half a pint of warm water. 

7. Aloes, Sweet Oil, Etc. — Apply blankets wrung out of hot water. 
Give injections of warm soap suds mixed with 8 ounces of sweet oil. Also 
give one-half ounce of Barbadoes aloes. 

8. Hop Tea. — Drench the horse with a quart of strong hop tea and then 
let him roll or walk him. 

9. Soda and Buttermilk, — Give a teaspoonful of common baking soda 
in a quart of buttermilk. May be repeated in half an hour if necessary. The 
soda should not be added to the buttermilk until just before it is given. 

10. Soda and Ginger. — Mix a tablespoonful" of ginger with a tablespoon- 
ful of common baking soda, dissolve in warm water and give as a drench. 

11. Chloroform and Linseed Oil. — Mix half an ounce of chloroform with 
a quart of raw linseed oil and give at one dose. 

12. Turpentine and Laudanum. — Mix 1 ounce of turpentine with two 
ounces of laudanum and a pint of warm water and give as a dose. 

13. Milk and Ammonia. — To a pint of sweet milk add a teaspoonful of 
aqua ammonia and give at one dose. 

14. Laudanum, Ether and Nitre. — Mix equal parts of laudanum, sul- 
phuric ether and spirits of nitre. The dose is two tablespoonfuls in a pint 
of water and may be given every hour until relief is obtained. 

CRAMPS OR SPASMODIC COLIC— Spasmodic colic is perhaps one 
of the most common bowel ailments of the horse. It is known by such names 
as gripes, cramps, belly-ache, etc. It consists of a spasmodic contraction of 
the muscular portion of the intestines. It usually affects the small intestines ; 
however, the large intestine is sometimes involved. 

CAUSES. — Spasmodic colic is often the result of a change of feed from 
good to an inferior quality. It also follows drinking too much cold water 



HORSE— DISEASES OF DIGESTIVE ORGANS. 19 

when in a heated condition, especially if the animal is exhausted. Eating cold 
or frozen vegetables, sometimes a very small quantity, brings on the attack. 
A change of temperature from hot to cold and irritating cathartic medicine 
when not combined with an anodyne to prevent griping are other causes. 

SYMPTOMS. — ^This ailment attacks the animal suddenly. When seem- 
ingly in perfect health and while eating food he is seized with pain and turns 
the head around to the side, switches his tail, paws and kicks, often raising 
the hind foot toward the abdomen. Ha cringes down, very often lying down 
and rolling from side to side and of course must be suffering violent pain. 
These attacks of pain are usually periodical and soon pass off. During these 
attacks the pulse quickens but slows when the animal is quiet. The neck 
of the bladder is usually contracted and the animal is unable to urinate, but 
after the abdominal pain ceases the animal urinates freely. During these 
sick spells the ears and legs very often become cold and when rolling he 
tries to balance upon his back. He generally paws and turns around several 
times before lying down and he frequently eats hay between the attacks and 
sometimes the bowels move freely. These attacks usually last from fifteen 
minutes to ten or fifteen hours. Whenever the pain becomes continuous and 
the visible mucous membranes become inflamed it indicates inflammation of 
the bowels. 

TREATMENT. — In the treatment of colic it is important to be energetic 
and to bear in mind that giving twelve or fifteen times as much of any of the 
common home remedies used for colic in the family is equally proper in the 
treatment of spasmodic colic in horses. All alcoholic stimulants and anti- 
jipasmodics are proper remedies for this ailment. Among these remedies 
are sulphuric ether, tincture opium (laudanum), ginger, capsicum, belladonna 
and nux vomica. If the bowels are costive give a laxative of oil or aloes, 
with calomel and ginger. It is also well to give injections. Stimulating lini- 
ments or mustard applied externally give relief. The animal should be al- 
lowed to roll as he pleases. A very common drench is composed of one 
ounce of sulphuric ether, one ounce of tincture of opium (laudanum), one- 
half ounce tincture ginger and one dram tincture capsicum in a pint or two 
of cold water. Repeat this dose in an hour or two if a recovery has not taken 
place. It is always good practice to give a laxative to clear out the bowels 
and it is always good judgment to lessen an animal's food supply for twenty- 
four hours after he has had an attack of colic. 
PEOPLE'SHOME REMEDIES FOR CRAMP OR SPASMODIC COLIC. 

1. Whiskey. — Give half a pint of whiskey in. some hot water every hour 
until relief is obtained. 

2. Soapy Water and Salt Water. — Give injections of warm soapy water 
or weak salt water if the horse has spasmodic colic. 

3. Laudanum, Ether and Linseed Oil. — Give two ounces each of lauda- 
num and sulphuric ether mixed with half a pint of raw linseed oil. 

4. Chloral Hydrate. — Give an ounce of chloral hydrate in one-half pint 
of water every two or three hours. 

0. Nitre, Opium and Ginger. — To half a pint of water add one-half ounce 
of fluid extract of ginger, one ounce of tincture opium and 1% ounces of 
sweet spirits of nitre. This is one dose. 

6. Nitre, Laudanum, Ginger. — To a pint of lukewarm water add one 
Jtftblespoonful of ginger and one ounce each of tincture of laudanum and sweet 



so THE PEOPLE'S HOME STOCK BOOK. 

spirits of nitre. Give this amount every four hours until the horse is better. 
This is one of the best remedies known for cramp or spasmodic colic. 

7. Asafetida and Ether. — Mix 1% ounces of sulphuric ether with 4 
ounces of tincture of asafetida. Give one-fourth of this amount in a pint of 
warm water every twenty minutes until relief is obtained. 

GORGED STOMACH— IMPACTION OF THE STOMACH— STOM- 
ACH STAGGERS.^ When the stomach is overloaded and distended so much 
that it fails to contract on its contents, we call it gorged stomach. This usu- 
ally happens to hungry, half-starved, ravenous eaters when they have access 
to a grain bin or field of grain. 

SYMPTOMS. — The animal soon becomes dull and shows distress, keep- 
ing the head low. This dullness increases and he usually paws and acts as 
though he were going to stagger and it Is not uncommon for him to be- 
come delirious, tremble violently and act wild until he falls. This ailment 
sometimes remfnds one of a horse with mad staggers or vertigo. 

TREATMENT. — Give one ounce of aromatic spirits of ammonia, one 
dram fluid extract nux vomica and three ounces of whiskey in a pint of cold 
water every hour. Or, give any good home colic mixture. A cathartic of 
aloes, epsom salts or Glauber's salts should be given immediately. Large doses 
of ginger and red pepper are good and I have known two tablespoonfuls of 
turpentine given in one-half pint of either sweet oil or raw linseed oil to act 
very well. If there is much gas forming give two drams of salicylic acid in 
a teacupful of warm water every hour until relief is obtained; or, give one 
ounce of aromatic spirits of ammonia in one pint of cold water every hour 
until the horse is better. 
PEOPLE'S HOME REMEDIES :— For Impaction, Gorged -Stomach, or 

Stomach Staggers. — 

1. Aloes, Cayenne Pepper and Turpentine. — Give an ounce of Barba- 
does aloes as a physic and follow with half an ounce of cayenne pepper or 
ginger; also, give injections of warm soap suds. This treatment has cured 
many a horse. 

RUPTURE OF THE STOMACH.— Rupture of the stomach is a result 
of acute indigestion, bvit I have known it to occur without the bowels being 
veiy much affected. 

SYMPTOMS. — One of the most prominent symptoms is the animal's 
attempting to vomit and it very often succeeds when the stomach is rup- 
tured. The heart action is always weak, cold sweats bedew the body, the 
ears and legs grow cold and the horse sits on his haunches. Rupture of the 
stomach is always fatal. "However, an animal will often live several hours 
after the rupture occurs. 

TREATMENT. — Treatment consists in moving the bowels before'an in- 
flammation takes place ; therefore, give one ounce of aloes, thirty g'rains 
calomel, one dram ground nux vomica and two drams ground ginger, made 
into a bolus. Give at one dose. Eight hours later give a pint of raw lin- 
seed oil and one dram tincture nux vomica at a dose three times a day until 
the bowels move. Also give injections of warm soap suds, apply mustard 
and water to the abdomen and if the pain is intense give four grains of mor- 
phine four or five times a day. Give the animal water if he craves it. As 
a last resort I have thought good results followed giving twenty-five drops of 
croton oil in a pint of raw linseed 6il. It is well to keep in mind that a little 
walking exercise assists greatly in moving the bowels. 



HORSE— DISEASES OF DIGESTIVE ORGANS. 21 

GASTRITIS— INFLAMMATION OF THE STOMACH.— 

CAUSES. — Gastritis is usually the result of taking irritants or poisons, 
such as arsenic, brine or lime, into the stomach. 

SYMPTOMS. — The animal suffers great pain, may sweat freely and the 
pulse is weak. The horse is less liable to have gastritis than the ox or dog. 

TREATMENT. — Without knowing the cause you cannot treat gastritis 
properly. If it is due to eating arsenic, give hydrated sesquioxide of iron; 
also give nutritive tonics and stimulants, plenty of eggs and milk and such 
home remedies as soothe our own inflamed stomaclis. 
PEOPLE'S HOME REMEDIES.— For Gastritis or Inflammation of the 

Stomach. — 

1. Sulphuric Acid. — Give from half a teaspoonful to a teaspoonful of 
sulphuric acid well diluted with milk, whites of eggs, or oils. Also give lin- 
seed gruel. 

ENTERITIS— INFLAMMATION OF THE BOWELS.— Enteritis, or 
inflammation of the bowels, as it is commonly termed, is a very fatal affection 
of the horse and I might say in all the lower animals. As a rule the inner 
coat of the bowels is affected However, all the other coats may become in- 
volved, and the large intestines are much more commonly affected than the 
small ones. This is not a common disease of the horse, but when it does 
exist it is usually fatal. 

CAUSES. — It is usually the result of other ailments that affect the bowels. 
Certain animals are seemingly predisposed to it. It very often follows the 
giving of poisonous doses of croton oil, arsenic and other irritating drugs. It 
also results from impaction of the bowels caused by food clogging them and 
also from foreign bodies lodging in the intestines. It also results from intus- 
susception or a telescoping of the bowels, or from volvulus or a knotting or 
kinking of the bowels. It is possible for a horse to suffer with this disease 
for several days; however, most cases do not last longer than twenty-four 
or thirty-six hours. 

SYMPTOMS. — The symptoms are very similar in the first stages to those 
of colic, but they soon become more severe, the pain more continuous, the 
pulse quicker and the temperature usually rises. In most cases the horse 
tries to roll on his back and appears easiest in this position. The abdomen is 
hard and painful to the touch. Cold sweats appear on the body. The eye 
is somewhat blood-shot and the animal wanders about the stall as though 
unconscious of what was going on. Whenever a diarrhea sets in it should be 
a hint that recovery is doubtful. 

TREATMENT.— The treatment of this fatal disease is unsatisfactory. 
Give opiates freely, and small doses of calomel and oil. If it is convenient, 
give morphine hypodermically, from one to three grains at a dose, repeating 
the dose as often as necessary to give the animal relief. Injections of tepid 
water with a little tobacco added is a good treatment. Apply mustard and 
water freely to the abdomen. See that the animal has pure fresh air to breathe 
and look well after the horse's general comfort. Do not allow him to stand 
in a draft or chill and do not allow any by-stander to suggest giving a horse 
suffering from enteritis a dose of physic, for if you do it adds to his chances 
of dying. I have known of hundreds oT horses being killed on account of 
this mistake being made. It is well to keep in mind that large doses of opium 
to quiet the animal and keep him quiet throughout his sickness is the best 



22 THE PEOPLE'S HOME STOCK BOOR. 

remedy that can be given. Also apply hot applications and mild counter-" 

irritants to the abdomen. 

PEOPLE'S HOME REMEDIES.— For Inflammation of the Bowels.— 

1. Hot Water. — Apply woollen blankets wrung out of hot water to the 
abdomen and back. 

Z. Vinegar, Mustard and Turpentine. — To two quarts of vinegar add 
half a pound of mustard and an ounce of turpentine. Mix and rub on the belly 
and back and then tie a blanket around the horse. 

3. Opium and Belladonna. — Give from one to two drams of powdered 
opium mixed with one dram of extract of belladonna. This dose may be 
given every three or four hours. 

4. Oatmeal Gruel, Starch Wate^:, Etc.— Apply hot blankets to the belly 
and give oatmeal gruel, starch water or linseed tea. 

5. White Oak Bark. — Make a tea of white oak bark and give large and 
frequent doses. Apply mustard water to the legs and to the body apply 
blankets wrung out of hot water and sprinkled with turpentine. 

PERITONITIS.^(See " Cattle Department.") 
PEOPLE'S HOME REMEDIES.— 

1. Opium and Calomel. — Every 2 to 4 hours give from 1 to 2 drams 
of powdered opium mixed with % dram of calomel. Also apply mustard 
plasters or turpentine stupes to the belly. 

HERNIA — RUPTURE.— A hernia is a protrusion of the whole or a part 
of an organ through either a natural or an unnatural opening. It usually 
means a protrusion of some of the intestines from the abdominal cavity. The 
name usually indicates the location and we meet with umbilical, scrotal and in- 
guinal hernias. When it interferes with the circulation of the parts it is 
called strangulation. In many cases it is reducible. 

INGUINAL HERNIA. — Inguinal hernia is usually met with in 
young animals or stallions and consists of the passage of a portion of the 
intestines through a ring into the inguinal canal, becoming strangulated and 
producing violent colicky pains. These are difficult cases to diagnose and if 
discovered the treatment consists in casting the horse, rolling him on his 
back, passing the hand into the rectum, seizing the bowel and shaking it 
loose, then applying a pad and keeping the bowel within the body. With 
this treatment the parts may close and a recovery take place. Otherwise, it 
would be necessary to castrate the horse by the covered method. 

SCROTAL HERNIA. — Scrotal hernia is very common in young animals 
at birth and it very often gets well without treatment. When it produces no 
harm it is best to leave it alone until it does. 

SYMPTOMS. — A bunch of this kind usually increases in size after the 
animal has eaten a hearty meal. It is always larger in hot weather for cold 
seems to contract these bunches. A very good test is to place the hand on the 
bunch and have an assistant oblige the animal to cough ; when coughing the 
hernia will be forced out and enlarged. It is always a good plan to examine 
the hernia before castration. 

TREATMENT. — The only satisfactory treatment is a surgical operation 
and this work should be done by an expert. Therefore, it is needless to give 
directions as to how the work should be done. 

UMBILICAL HERNIA. — Umbilical hernia is a protrusion of the bowel 
through the umbilicus (navel opening) and is most commonly met with in 
young animals. It seldom causes much inconvenience and is almost always re- 



HORSE— DISEASES OF DIGESTIVE ORGANS. 33 

duceable. Of course there is some danger of its becoming strangulated, but this 
is the exception. Very often the bunch can be reduced by pressure and some 
veterinarians try bandages or a truss before they will consent to operate. 
Skewers are often put through the skin and a ligature applied back of them, 
or a clamp is applied and left on, allowing the pouch of skin to slough off. 
This very often brings about a perfect recovery. I have also cut into the 
hernial sack, made the edges of the abdomen raw, stitched the opening with 
heavy catgut sutures, then placed a bandage and pad of oakum over the 
bunch and obtained splendid recoveries. 

VENTRAL HERNIA.— This is a kind of herjiia that takes place through 
an artificial opening in the abdomen. It is the result of accident. It is very 
often caused by kicks or being hooked by cattle, or in old animals it some- 
times takes place on account of the abdominal muscles giving way, the result 
of over exertion. 

TREATMENT.— If very small it is not always advisable to do much for 
it unless it increases in size, becomes strangulated or interferes in some way 
with the use^fulness of the animal. When it does it is well to open the ab- 
domen, scarify the edges of the opening, stitch them together with heavy 
catgut, treat the wound antiseptically and wear a bandage and pad until a 
recovery takes place. 

DIAPHRAGMATIC HERNIA.— In diaphragmatic hernia the bowels 
pass from the abdominal to the thoracic cavity and it is not unusual when it 
occurs to find several feet of the small bowels in the chest. Death always 
follows. 

Causes. — It is usually the result of severe exertioii. 

Symptoms. — Same as enteritis. 

Treatment. — Is of no avail. 

INTESTINAL WORMS— LONG ROUND WORMS— TAPEWORMS 
— PIN WORMS. — The tapeworms have flat bodies and are made up of a 
succession of segments or links with a narrow neck and quite small head, 
some of them being round headed and others flat headed. We also find flukes 
of a flat shape with digestive organs and a number of sucking discs ; we also 
find the thorn-headed worms with long rounded bodies and retractible snouts 
with hooks by which they attach themselves to the mucous membrane of the 
bowels, but they have neither mouth nor digestive canal. The horse harbors 
in his bowels tapeworms and round worms and I have seldom failed to find 
them. The large worms usually inhabit the small intestines and the small 
worms reside in the large bowels and as the large worms have sixty or more 
feet of bowels for their home, it is not surprising that they are difficult to 
destroy and when we consider that the small worms have thirty or more feet 
of large bowels to reside in, are you surprised at a single dose or two of 
medicine failing to reach them all? Horses become wormy by taking food , 
or drinking water that contains worm embryos which, when meeting the heat 
and moisture of the body, soon grow and develop into worms and of course 
they multiply rapidly and if not destroyed or passed out of the body they 
disturb digestion and pick up considerable nutriment, causing the animal to 
get out of condition and lose flesh. Besides, I have known them to puncture 
the bowels. 

SYMPTOMS. — The symptoms are shown whenever worms are present 
in large numbers and attach themselves to the mucous membranes or when 
they bore through these to reach other parts. They produce signs of ill health. 



34 THE PEOPLE'S HOME STOCK BOOK. 

poor condition, hide-bound, a scurvy, dry state of the skin, pot-belly, an itchy 
condition of the skin and root of tail and often a voracious appetite with 
fetid breath, sometimes diarrhea and at other times costiveness. There is 
bloating in the morning, a puffy swelling and itchy condition of the anus 
which is very often surrounded with a sort of dried mucus, rubbing of the 
tail and colicky pains, and one of the best and safest symptoms is the pass- 
age of worms. However, it is not always possible to see them without the 
use of a magnifying glass. 

TREATMENT. — Perhaps the most reliable remedy known is santonine ; 
however, it should be given in one-dram doses combined with twenty grains 
of calomel and two drams of powdered kamala and made into a, bolus with 
linseed meal and given on an empty stomach in the morning, daily for three 
or four days ; then discontinue for several days and repeat it. Another popu- 
lar home remedy is giving one ounce of turpentine and one dram of oil of 
male fern in one pint of raw linseed oil at a dose twice a week for two or 
three weeks. This mixture should be given as a drench in the morning accord- 
ing to directions for drenching horses. All vermicides given to human beingsi 
that produce good results are proper remedies for horses, but give ten times the 
quantity at a dose. For pin worms wash out the rectum with a gallon or two 
of soap suds, then use an infusion of quassia which is made by soaking one 
ounce of quassia chips for one hour in a pint of warm water. Or, dissolve 
one ounce of sulphate of iron in three or four parts of tepid water and use 
this instead of the quassia. Or, dissolve three ounces of common salt in, a 
gallon of tepid water and use this. In treating wormy live stock it is well 
to consider the importance of removing the cause, which means a change o* 
food and the boiling of the water supply. 

PEOPLE'S HOME REMEDIES FOR WORMS.— 

1. Fine-Cut Tobacco. — Give an ounce of fine-cut tobacco in the feed once 
a day for a week or ten days. 

2. Turpentine and Linseed Oil. — Give half a pint of raw linseed oil to 
which has been added an ounce of turpentine. 

3. Salt Jind Ashes. — Mix equal parts of salt and wood ashes and give two 
tablespoonfuls at a time in the feed once a day. 

4. Pin Worms.-^Once or twice daily inject an infusion of either tobacco 
or quassia chips, using half a pound to a gallon of water. Repeat once or 
twice a day for two or three days and follow with a physic. 

5. Pin Worms. — Dissolve a tablespoonful of salt in a quart of tepid 
water and wash out bowel daily for a week. 

INTESTINAL TUMORS.— Tumors, if not large, may exist in the intes- 
tines for a long time without doing much harm. However, when they grow 
large they are always troublesome, very often causing death. 

CAUSES. — Any injury to the bowel, such as puncturing for fiatuleijt colic, 
or some rough uneves hard substance passing through the bowel may be the 
means of starting a tumor-like growth and it is not uncommon to find them in 
white horses suffering from melanosis. 

SYMPTOMS.— A horse suffering from tumors in the bowel usually shows 
colicky pains, paws, rolls and throws himself about gently. The pulse is 
slightly quickened, bowels are constipated, the body and extremities become 
cold and the animal very often dies in a few days. 

TREATMENT. — Give morphia, opium or belladonna and if a correct 



HORSE— DISEASES OF DIGESTIVE ORGANS. 25 

diagnosis can be made and the services of a skillful sui^eon can be had ask 
him to operate, for this is the only possible chance of saving the horse's life. 

INTESTINAL CONCRETIONS.-:-Intestinal concretions sometimes 
form in the bowels and block them. They are usually hard and are composed 
of lime, magnesia, hair, meal and many other substances. Many of these 
masses have some hard substance as a sort of nucleus around which these 
substances seem to fasten and accumulate. 

CAUSES. — Animals that lick others during the shedding season and cows 
that are fond of picking up pieces of wood, metal or leather are quite likely 
to have trouble of this kind. Besides, certain kinds of feed are likely to pro- 
duce dust balls. 

SYMPTOMS.— The animal usually has considerable abdominal pain and 
as the disease progresses the horse is inclined to sit on his haunches and if 
the bowel is entirely blocked he soon shows all the symptoms of enteritis or 
inflammation of the bowels. 

TREATMENT. — First of all it is good treatment to wash out the rectum 
with soap and water that is a little warmer than the temperature of the body. 
If there be much pain, opiates should be given and there is none better than « 
tincture of opium (laudanum) and in the horse large doses of purgative medi- 
cine should be given. Raw linseed oil or sweet oil is the safest. If aloes, 
calomel and ginger are given, it should be in the early stages before any in- 
flammation of the bowels has taken place. A horse can often be relieved by 
introducing the hand into the rectum and removing the obstruction, providing 
the impaction is in the posterior bowel and within reach. It is well to keep 
in mind that it is easy to injure the bowel; therefore, the finger nails should 
be cut short and the hand well oiled before this work is done. 

DYSENTERY.^This term is used when blood comes away mixed with 
the feces and it may or may not occur as an independent disease. 

CAUSES. — It is very often the result of tuberculosis of the bowel or due 
to the presence of irritants in the intestines; It also comes from drinking 
stagnant or impure water; besides, an inferior quality of feed often causes it. 

SYMPTOMS. — An excessive bowel action and some blood and mucus 
mixed in the evacuations are common symptoms of dysentery. The pulse is 
usually quick, the animal thirsty, bowels ulcerated, coat dry and hot, and if the 
animal does not get relief he loses strength rapidly and death may be the result. 

TREATMENT. — I invariably give a dose of oil, either raw linseed or 
olive oil. Castor oil is often given with gpod results. Chalk and opium, ether, 
whiskey, brandy or rum are proper remedies. Catechu, tannic acid, starch 
and wheat flour act very well. Whenever the bowel discharges lessen mater- 
ially, begin to give tonics such as equal parts of sulphate of iron, gentian, 
ginger and cinchona, a tablespoonful at a dose in feed two or three times a 
day. It is always a mistake to allow an animal to have too much hearty iooC 
or vegetables after recovering from an attack of this kind ; besides, he should 
be kept reasonably quiet, 

, DIARRHEA. — Diarrhea consists n the passage of too much liquid feces 
and it is very often the result of other ailments, such as indigestion and enter- 
itis. 

CAUSES. — Eating infected food, too much rich food when the animal is 
not accustomed to it, drinking stagnant or filthy water, grazing on bare pas- 
tures where too much earth is taken in with the food and eating too many 
vegetables and badly, cured fodder are among the causes of diarrhea. Certain 



86 THE PEOPLE'S HOME STOCK BOOK. 

rangy horses with slim bodies, flat ribs and which are poorly ribbed up, are 
subject to looseness of the bowels. 

SYMPTOMS. — The passage of too much liquid fecal matter and exhibit- 
ing symptoms of pain each time the bowels are moved are symptoms of diar- 
rhea. In the early stages the heart action is not much changed; however, 
later on the circulation quickens and the extremities may grow cold ; also> the 
animal may stagger, indicating considerable weakness. 

TREATMENT. — Find out if possible whether the case is acute or chronic. 
It is generally good practice to give from one pint to one quart of raw lingeed 
oil or sweet oil. It is also a good plan to give sweet spirits of nitre, ginger, 
and opium ; one-half ounce of each at a dose in a pint of water, three or four 
times a day. The quantity of opium should be increased if the bowel action 
is not checked ; or you may give one dram ;powdered opium, two drams pow- 
dered catechu and one ounce prepared chalk at a dose two or three times a 
day. Very often by giving flour or starch in water two or three times a day the 
case will be helped ; besides, wheat flour gruel is a proper food to give. In 
the treatment of young foals they should be given medicine very carefully, in 
the same way, but given in very small doses. If the disease is due to micro-or- 
ganisms, bowel antiseptics such as creosote, carbolic acid, hypo-sulphite soda 
or salol should be given and counter-irritants applied externally. 

DIARRHEA IN YOUNG COLTS.— This is brought on by the, colt's 
getting too much rich milk from the mother or from her udder being in- 
fected, or from exposure. 

CAUSES. — The first njilk from the mare or sow possesses laxative prop- 
erties; therefore, if the colt takes too much it is likely to produce diarrhea. 
Sometimes it is the result of the mare's milk being of poor quality ; or, if she 
is working and becomes overheated, this changes her milk. It is also the re- 
sult of exposure to storms and lying on wet cold ground. 

SYMPTOMS.— Watery bowel movements. 

TREATMENT. — Keep the colt quiet, clothe his body warm and bandage 
the legs if they are cold. Give a small teaspoonful of laudanum and a large 
teaspoonful of good whiskey, twenty drops spirits of camphor and five grains 
of powdered alum in some of the mare's milk every three or four hours until 
the bowels tighten. Or, give five grains sulphate iron in one ounce water 
every three hours. Or, you can give any good home remedy that is used in 
diarrhea or dysentery in man. 
PEOPLE'S HOME REMEDIES.— For Diarrhea in Young Colts.— 

1. Flour. — Mix two tablespoonfuls of flour with a teacupful of cold water 
and drench the colt twice a day. If the case is severe and attended with 
much pain apply a mustard plaster to the abdomen and give a drench of 3 
tablespoonfuls of whiskey, 1 ounce of castor oil and 10 drops of laudanum. 

2. Preventive. — To prevent scouring in foals do not feed the mare vege- 
tables or too much grass to purge her soon after foaling but feed some old 
oats and well cured fodder. This con es from a Granger living in Stockton, 
Iowa. 

CONSTIPATION.— ^Constipation is more a symptom of disease than a 
.disease itself. 

CAUSES. — Perhaps over feeding and want of exercise are the most com-, 
mon causes of constipation. A rapid absorption of the fluids of the bowels 
during fever always has a tendency to produce constipation. It is also an 
indication of a torpid liver. Certain kinds of food cause it ; it can be brought 



HORSE— DISEASES OF DIGESTIVE ORGANS. 27 

Ofl by feeding too much nourishing food or too much non-nutritious food; be- 
sides, it often follows indigestion and derangement of the digestive system, 
especially in old animals. ■ 

SYMPTOMS. — As a rule it is not difficult to make a diagnosis, but do 
not be misled if a slight diarrhea is present, for this is often set up as an effort 
of nature to empty the bowels. The dung is often covered with mucus, the 
animal presents a dull appearance, shows some abdominal pain at times, rolls 
some, bloats a little, and the trouble is usually in the large bowels. The 
rectum is usually irritated and protrudes somewhat. This is a result of the 
horse making an effort to empty his bowels. 

TREATMENT. — If a horse is affected, give aloes ; if an ox, give epsom 
salts or oil ; and castor oil for the dog. It is well to give a little ginger; or 
capsicum to prevent griping, or a decoction of tobacco as an injection and it 
is often necessary to empty the bowel by hand, especially if there is any par- 
alysis of the rectum. In chronic constipation it is well to keep in mind that 
nearly all vegetables have a laxative effect ; therefore, they should be fed to all 
idle horses. The bowels move much more often when an animal is exercised 
than when standing still. Therefore, exercise is a preventive. 

CONSTIPATION IN YOUNG COLTS.— Nearly every colt is costive 
when born. 

CAUSES. — It is more likely to occur in colts when the mother has been 
fed on dry food and her bowels are in a costive state. 

SYMPTOMS. — There is constipation if the bowels of a colt do not move 
within twelve or twenty-four hours after birth. 

TREATMENT. — ^If the bowels do not move within twelve or twenty- 
four hours after birth, inject sweet oil or push in a round, smooth* tapered 
piece of ivory soap or a glycerine suppository, or something that is oily and 
not irritating, but be sure not to injure the bowel. Sometimes soap suds act 
very well. 
PEOPLE'S HOME REMEDIES.— For Constipation in Foals.— 

1. Castor Oil. — Give from 3 to 4 ounces of castor oil at a dose. The 
lives of many foals would be saved if the constipated condition of the bowels 
was noticed and this treatment given. 

VOLVULUS. — Volvulus is a twisting or kinking of the bowel that occurs 
when the animal is rolling. Young animals appear to be more affected than 
older ones and it is not uncommon to have it take place while an animal is 
suffering from colic. 

SYMPTOMS. — This is an ailment that is difficult to diagnose for the 
symptoms are very much the same as in inflammation of the bowels, but 
the animal very often shows more distress. The animal sits on his haunches, 
much like a dog. 

TREATMENT. — As a rule very little can be done to prevent a fatal term- 
ination but it is always good practice to give remedies that will quiet the 
animal and there is none better than tincture of opium (laudanum) given in 
one-ounce doses as often as necessary to allay the pain. In my practice I 
advise the destruction of a horse that has volvulus and cannot be relieved 
from the pain, for this is the humane thing to do. 

INTUSSUSCEPTION. — Intussusception means a slipping of a portion 
of bowel within another very much as a telescope i^ shortened. It occurs in 
both the large and small intestines, but I have found the small intestines to 
be most frequently involved. 



28 THE PEOPLE'S HOME STOCK BOOK. 

CAUSES. — No one has ever been able to tell the exact cause ; however, it 
frequently follows attacks of spasmodic colic when there is violent muscular 
contraction of the bowels and it is most common in young animals. 

SYMPTOMS. — Almost identical with those of volvulus. 
' TREATMENT. — A surgical operation is sometimes attended with good 
results ; however, to be successful the work must be well done. I have known 
a portion of the bowel to slough aod come away showing that nature effected 
a cure. (Se? treatment for volvulus and follow it.) 

PROLAPSUS ANI— FALLING OF BOWEL.— Prolapsus ani or fallen 
bowel is a condition of the rectum which follows irritation of the bowel, very 
often from what is termed back-racking when the hand of the operator was too 
large or when he neglected to oil his hand properly or when too much force 
was used. 

Causes. — it is caused by anything that irritates or inflames the rectum 
such as irritating drugs in injections and giving certain medicine to purge 
animals or inexperienced persons emptying the bowel by hand. 

SYMPTOMS. — There is a red looking mass protruding from the bowel 
the size of a pint measure or sometimes even larger. 

TREATMENT. — First of all wash out the bowel with tepid water, using 
a small rubber tube ; however, in case the water fails the hand should be used 
and the smaller the hand the better. The protruding part should be washed 
clean and forced back into place and the hind quarters raised eight or ten 
inches higher than the fore quarters. This is best done by arranging the 
stall floor. Put % pound of sugar of lead, four ounces of laudanum and one 
ounce of tannic acid into a gallon of cold water and apply to the rectum five 
times a day. Keep the bowels open by feeding well salted bran mashes, vege- 
tables, or grass or give some raw linseed oil. I have sometimes found it 
necessary to remove a portion of the bowel, but not until it had become 
gangrenous. 

RUPTURE OF THE RECTUM.— Rupture of the rectum is by no means 
an uncommon injury. It often occurs by the careless use of metal syringes, 
mal-address in mating mares, in taking away foals and in back-racking. 

TREATMENT. — The treatment consists in stitching the break with 
strong catgut and bringing the edges as closely together as possible, then 
keeping the bowel clean and not too full and washing it out daily with one 
part carbolic acid, two parts glycerine and fifty parts water. 

SORE MOUTH. — This is an inflammation of the mucous membrane fol- 
lowing many different constitutional and exciting causes. 

CAUSES.^ — Stomach disturbances from eating too much bad food is a 
cause; or, eating irritating things or taking drugs which have a caustic or 
irritating effect will often produce an inflamed condition of the mouth. 

SYMPTOMS. — The mouth is swollen, hot and tender; there is drool- 
ing of saliva and there is always a reddened appearance of the mouth, and 
sometimes small ulcers or blisters can be seen; however, this is not very 
common. 

TREATMENT.— Feed grass or damp, cut fodder; also feed soft mashes 
that will not irritate the mouth. _ Dissolve % ounce of borax in a pint of 
water and wash out the mouth twice a day. There are many home remedies 
that will do just as well as drugs. Alum, salt or chlorate of potash are very 
good. 

STOMATITIS. — This is the name usually given to a soreness that oc- 



HORSE— DISEASES OF DIGESTIVE ORGANS. 29 

CUTS in the mouth and on the tongue, very often occurring when young ani- 
mals are teething. 

CAUSES. — Eating infected food which causes a derangement of the 
stomach and digestive organs, lack of nourishment, debility from scours, 
becoming infected through the navel, and the cutting of teeth appear to 
be the common causes of this ailment. It usually affects young animals; 
however, old ones are sometimes affected. 

SYMPTOMS. — There is a redness of the mouth, with a dripping of 
saliva. A few days later small white points appear on the membrane of 
the mouth and these soon begin to break, giving off rather an offensive odor, 
then the mouth presents a gangrenous appearance. 

TREATMENT.— A change of food is always advisable. The bowels 
should be moved gently by giving epsom salts or raw linseed oil. Antiseptic 
and astringent gargles should be applied and as a rule tonics should be given. 
If diarrhea is present give small doses of opium, lime water and creosote and 
continue the lime water for a week or ten days. Also give quinine three or 
four times a day or any of the home tonics that are used by the family. 
The mouth should be washed out three or four times a day and if it is gan- 
grenous put one dram of permanganate of potash into twenty ounces of 
water, or one ounce of carbolic acid into forty ounces of water, or one ounce 
of coal-tar disinfectant intc^ fifteen ounces of water and swab out the mouth 
two or three times daily. After using these washes it is a good plan to wash 
out the movith with warm water. 

PEOPLE'S HOME REMEDIES FOR STOMATITIS OR INFLAMMA- 
TION OF THE MOUTH.— 

1. Alum Water. — As a mouth wash use an ounce of alum to a quart 
of water. Give soft feed only. 

2. Borax. — Dissolve half an ounce of borax in a pint of water and use 
as a mouth wash. Hard dry feed irritates the mouth so give nothing but 
soft feed.

PEOPLE'S HOME REMEDIES.— 

1. Alum.— As a wash use half an ounce of alum to a pint of water. 

3. Borax.— Dissolve an ounce of borax in a quart of water and use 
as a mouth wash. Nothing is better. 

SLAVERING OR FROTHING AT THI, MOUTH.— This is a con- 
dition usually brought on by sharp points of the teeth irritating the cheeks 
or tongue or by giving horses strong irritating drugs which make the mouth 
sore or by the horse accidentally picking up irritating things. Foreign 
substances lodged in the mouth or tongue always cause an abnormal flow 
of saliva and so do some kinds of foods, such as second crop clover. Colts 
unaccustomed to the bit very often froth at the mouth. 

TREATMENT. — If it is caused by sharp, uneven molar teeth, file off 
the outer edges of the upper row and the inside of the lower row. If it is 
caused by a foreign body, remove it. Dissolve one ounce of borax or one 
ounce of powdered alum or one ounce of baking soda in a quart of water and 
wash out the mouth three times a day, using not less than i/i pint at a time. 
Feed the animal a cooling, laxative diet and if your colt slavers on account of 
the bit when you drive him, let him wear it when not in harness and not eating.

LAMPAS. — Whenever the gums behind the incisor or nipper teeth are 
somewhat full and up a little high, either with or without inflammation, it 
is called lampas. 

CAUSES.^Any irritant that will cause sore mouth will produce a swell- 
ing of the gums and bars of the mouth ; besides, lampas is always present in 
three, four and five-year-olds when their permanent teeth are coming in 
but older horses are not often troubled this way. 

SYMPTOMS. — An inflamed condition of the gums and a swollen condi- 
tion of the bars close to the incisor teeth are the two prominent symptoms 
of lampas; however, in some cases the gums are quite tender. 

TREATMENT. — Food that is not too stimulating, such as bran mash 
or vegetables and grass to open the bowels, always assists in reducing the 
inflammation of the gums. Washing the mouth out three times a day with 
either borax or alum and water, % ounce of either to a pint of water, or a weak 
salt solution does good. Never allow any person to burn them, for this is 
cruel, but I sometimes cut bars with a penknife to allow the serum to 
escape. Feeding corn to colts that have lampas is a mistake for it only 
makes them worse. They should be given soft feed. 
PEOPLE'S HOME REMEDIES FOR LAMPAS.— 

1. Alum Water. — Use alum water as a mouth wash. This will be found 
an efifective remedy. 

THE TONGUE, INJURIES TO.— The tongue is quite likely to su«er 
from injuries and in many different ways. 

CAUSES. — The tongue may be injured by being cut by sharp teeth, 
giving, irritating medicine without plenty of water and by foreign bodies 
lodging in the tongue. I have found rubber rings around the tongue; also 
hog rings through the lower portion of the tongue of crib-biting horses. 

TREATMENT. — In all cases of sore tongue it is very important that 
a careful examination of the tongue be made with the hand for if this is not 
done the cause may not be discovered. If a foreign body is found, remove 
it at once and wash out the mouth with warm water, then apply any of 
the home gargles used in human practice; or, dissolve i^ ounce of alum, or 
^2 ounce of borax, or one ounce of salt in one quart of water and apply 
to the tongue three times daily. If the discharge is offensive apply anti- 
septic washes, such as one part carbolic acid and 99 parts water, or any 
of the reliable coal-tar disinfectants, making the lotion one part to' fifty of 
water. 

STRICTURE OF THE CESOPHAGUS.— This is usually the result of 
choking brought on by continued inflammation of the gullet following the 
accident. 

SYMPTOMS. — When passing the probang it moves down easily until 
it reaches a certain point, there it is passed with difificulty and after more 
force is used the stricture gives way, then the probang moves along easily. 

TREATME*NT. — As a rule treatment in these cases does not give satis- 
factory results; however, I have had cases of this kind in valuable animals 



HORSE— DISEASES OF DIGESTIVE ORGANS. 31 

where I arranged to have the probang passed iaily, increasing the size of 
the probang until the stricture was dilated and a recovery took place. 

DILATION OF THE (ESOPHAGUS.— This is usually the result of 
choking caused from a stretching or enlargement of the gullet at a certain 
point when the accident occurred. 

SYMPTOMS. — In order to arrive at a correct diagnosis it is often 
necessary to pass a probang; however, very little can be done for an ailment 
of this kind more than to give oil when the attack is on and feed sloppy food. 
When the swelling is high up a pad is sometimes applied to good advantage. 
CHOKING.— 

CAUSES. — Choking occurs in all animals, but it is perhaps of most fre- 
quent occurrence among cattle and of course is due to the arrest of some 
substance swallowed on its way to the stomach and clogging, the gullet, thus 
preventing the passage of either liquid or solid food from ti.e mouth to the 
stomach. It is often caused in a simple way as, for instance, was the case 
with a valuable saddle mare brought to my hospital suffering from choke 
and in great distress. We cast her, rolled her on her back and extended her 
head preparatory to passing the probang; however, before doing so I used 
a mouth speculum and introducing my hand into the back part of the mouth, I 
picked out a fresh hen's egg. This mare was owned by Judge Williamson, 
General Counsel of the New York Central Railway Lines. It appears the 
mare had swallowed the egg while eating mash out of a feed box that a hen 
had used for a nest. A hungry, greedy animal often takes large mouthfuls 
and swallows food partially masticated and too dry and therefore chokes. 
Animals frequently choke on potatoes, apples, turnips or other vegetables, 
or by picking up pieces of coal, bones or wood. I have known horses to 
choke by (giving them large dry horse pills. 

SYMPTOMS. — One of the first symptoms is uneasiness, coughing, at- 
tempts at swallowing, spasmodic movements of the neck when attempting 
to drink water which returns through the nostrils. When cattle are choked 
there is usually considerable coughing. 

TREATMENT. — First of all, find out, if possible, the probable cause 
and if found to be a substance that can be crushed this should be done. 
If the obstruction is lodged, in the pharynx it can often be removed by the 
hand, otherwise pushed down with a probang. In cattle this is easily accom- 
plished, even with a flexible whip handle ; however, in horses it is much more 
difficult. In some cases I have found it necessary to cut the object out; 
however, this should be done by a vete /inarian. 
PEOPLE'S HOME REMEDIES FOR CHOKING.— 

1. Fomentations. — Apply hot fomentations just above the choke until 
the parts are_ relaxed and then work the obstacle loose with the hands. 
Sweet oil or linseed oil poured down the throat will help. 

2. Soaprsuds. — Pour a liberal quantity of thick soap-suds down the 
throat. 

3. Hose. — Run a rubber hose down the throat. This should be done 
with care. 

BOTS (HORSE BOT-FLY).— Bots are th^ result of larvae dropped 
by the horse bot-fly and usually deposited in the form of a yellow nit that 
the fly fastens to the hair on some part of the horse, most commonly on 
the chest and legs. The young larvae are licked off by the horse and taken 
into the mouth and transferred to different parts of the body, generally 



33 THE PEOPLE'S HOME STOCK BOOK. 

passing into the stomach wiere they develop and attach themselves to the 
mucus lining, where they remain until fully developed. The bot is not 
nearly so dangerous as it is supposed to be. Nearly all horses that are ex- 
posed to flies have bots and after remaining in the stomach for five or six 
months come away with the feces and for choice bury themselves in the 
ground or under Mth and in six or eight weeks become winged bot-flies. 

TREATMENT. — Bots are supposed to do a great deal of harm; how- 
ever, this is a mistaken idea, for there may be a great many of them in the 
stomach without even distwrbing digestion very much. Drugs given to harses 
with bots seldom do much good. Well-groomed horses may be entirely 
free from them and those that are wiped with a rag that has been satu- 
rated in kerosene may also be free from them, for kerosene destroys the nits. 
Applying one pf rt vinegar and two parts water to the horse's coat during 
the fly season will also destroy the gadfly egg^. By using these home 
remedies you can very easily prevent your horse from having bots, A favorite 
remedy is milk and molasses. This is used a great deal. Try giving one- 
half ounce of turpentine and four ounces of raw linseed oil on an empty 
stomach every morning until three doses have been given, then give six 
drams of powdered aloes, twenty-five grains of calomel and two drams 
ground ginger two hours after giving the last dose. 
PEOPLE'S HOME REMEDIES FOR BOTS.— 

1. Indigo Water. — Make some weak indigo water and drench the 
horse with it. This will knock the bots. » 

2. Milk and Syrup. — ^tive the horse a drench of a quart oi sweet milk 
and the same quantity of honey or molasses. The sweetne&s of this drench 
causes the bots to loosen their hold on the stomach and then an ounce of 
turpentine given in a pint of raw linseed oil will expel the bots. 

3. Hop Tea. — Drench the horse with a quart of strong hop tea. 

4. Red Pepper Tea. — Give the horse a quart of strong red pepper, tea. 
This causes the bots to let loose of the stomach and they may then be 
expelled with a pint of raw linseed oil. 

INFLAMMATION OF THE LIVER— HEPATITIS— ALSO CON- 
GESTION OF THE LIVER.— Congestion of the liver is a very common 
ailment of horses in warm climates where they feed on luxuriant grasses. 
Over-feci animals that are idle and kept in badly ventilated stables in low 
level land in the South are very often sufferers from liver congestion and 
inflammation of the liver. Inflammation does not by any means always fol- 
low congestion of the liver. 

SYMPTOMS.— In cases of congestion of the liver the animal often 
appears as though he had been poisoned, very often showing great pros- 
tration with dull sunken eyes, an anxious face, quick pulse, quick breathing 
and trembling with violent colicky pains. He frequently looks at the flank, 
lying down and rising. Tlie mucous membranes are yellow and in some cases 
there appears to be a slow sort of congestion going on. Upon stril<ing the 
animal a blow on the right side in the region of the last ribs, he appears 
tender. The bowels at first may be loose but gradually harden. The appe- 
tite is usually gone and the legs frequently stock. In some cases the 
horse shows lameness in the right foreleg. If the lungs or heart are impaired 
the liver is generally affected to a certain extent; therefore, derangement 
of the liver is often a symptom of other diseases and diseases of the liver are 
very difficult to diagnose. 



HORSE— DISEASES OF DIGESTIVE ORGANS. 3S 

TREATMENT. — A full dose of carthartic medicine should be given but 
avoid giving calomel when the liver is congested. Gopd results follow giyiog; 
eosom salts in three or four-ounce doses twice a day and feeding the animal 
on easily digested food. Inflammation of the liver (hepatitis) should be 
treated very much the same as congestion of the liver, adding mild stimulants 
and applying light applications of mustard and water over the right side. 
Give scalded bran and some mixed hay. Carrots and grass are proper foods 
foi an animal in this condition. 

PEOPLE'S HOME REMEDIES FOR HEPATITIS OR INFLAMMA- 
TION OF THE LIVER.— 

1. Bleeding, Etc. — Draw from four to six quarts of blood from^ the 
jugular vein and give one-half-ounce doses of saltpeter three or four times 
a day. Feed sparingly and chiefly on bran mashes. 

JAUNDICE— YELLOWS.— Jaundice or " yellows," as it is often called, 
is the most common disorder of the liver. 

CAUSES.— It is very often the result of debilitating fevers and other 
diseases ; also, it results from eating too much rich food when idle. It is, no 
doubt, often the result of a stoppage of tbe bill duct and a torpid condition 
of the liver; the urine may contain bile. This ailment is very likely to fol- 
low other diseases of the liver. 

TREATMENT. — If tbere is a stoppage of the duct give twenty grains 
calomel daily for five . days and if the bowels are blocked give six drams 
Barljadoes aloes, of course adding two drams ground ginger to the aloes 
to prevent griping. Giving granulated phosphate soda in warm water daily, 
or podophyllin occasionally, will help these trases. During the summer 
rttonths a run to grass is always beneficial. 
PEOPLE'S HOME REMEDIES FOR JAUNDICE OR YELLOWS.— 

1. Glauber's Salts. — Give two ounces of Glauber's salts once or twice a 
day for a week. 

CIRRHOSIS. — Cirrhosis is really an induration or hardening of the liver 
and frequently follows inflammation of the liver. 

CAUSES. — It is caused by feeding a poor quality of food, such as badly 
cured fodder, after living on rich nutritious food, and in man it is very often 
the result of long and continued use of alcoholic stimulants. 

SYMPTOMS. — The same symptoms are present as in other liver dis- 
orders ; the animal soon becomes greatly eniaciated and shows a rough coat ; 
the dung smells strong and the membranes are pale. 

TREATMENT. — It is difficult to make a correct diagnosis. Give bak- 
ing soda, one or two ounces ; Glauber's or epsom salts ; or, phosphate of soda 
in 6 dram doses twice or three times a day. Also give tonics. 

ASCITES, ANASARCA OR DROPSY.— These ailments are the results 
of other diseases. 

CAUSES. — There is generally quite a quantity of effusion or water 
in the abdomen and it is usually the result of diseases of the liver or kidneys 
or chronic peritonitis. 

SYMPTOMS. — The coat is generally dry and dusty and the horse is 
hide bound and has an unthrifty appearance. The abdomen is distended and 
the bowels are irregular. The animal may eat well, but even if he does he 
loses strength. 

TREATMENT. — Medicine that acts on the kidneys should be given 
and there is none better than iodide of potassium. Give one or two drams 

3-S 



34 THE PEOPLE'S HOME STOCK BOOK. 

two or three times a day. Feed nutritious food that is easily digested. If 
the swelling is not reduced it is good practice to open into the abdomen and 
allow the water to escape. However, if this becomes necessary you had 
better have it done by a veterinarian. In mild cases give a tablespoonful of 
the following compound powder at a dose in feed, three times a day until a 
recovery takes place. Take equal parts by weight of powdered sulphate 
iron, ground gentian root, ground ginger and powdered saltpeter. 
PEOPLE'S HOME REMEDIES FOR ASCITES OR DROPSY OF THE 

ABDOMEN.— 

1. Salts and Saltpeter. — Give either epsom or Glauber's salts and also 
give one-half-ounce doses of saltpeter. 

LOCO DISEASE. — Loco disease is brought on by eating loco weeds, 
which bear pods, and as these weeds seem to be a native of the western 
plains the disease is common in those parts but not met with in other parts 
of this country. These plants grow to be ten or twelve inches high and are 
of a gray color and remain green throughout the winter, which accounts for 
hungry animals eating them and getting into trouble. 

SYMPTOMS. — If the animal eats much of the weed he soon begins to 
lose flesh and he becomes emaciated and usually dies of starvation. In the 
early stages the animal appears sluggish and moves slowly, the muscles 
tremble and he gets up with great difficulty. There is considerable trembling 
of the head and neck with a peculiar anxious expression followed by fits or 
a sort of delirium. The horse acts somewhat like a horse suffering with 
blind staggers. This fitty condition is most likely to occur in hot weather, 
especially if the horse is overheated by work. Cattle as well as horses are 
affected, but they resist the poisonous effects better. 

TREATMENT.— In talking with chemists they tell me that the loco 
weed is not very poisonous, but it is almost wholly void of nutrition and 
hungry animals eating this weed, on account of its greenness and freshness 
during the winter season, fail to get sufficient nourishment to keep them 
alive; consequently, animals that are inclined to eat loco weeds should be 
kept away from_ them and fed other kinds of food and when showing symp- 
toms of this ailment they should be given two tablespoonfuls of ground 
gentian, two tablespoonfuls of ginger and two tablespoonfuls of powdered 
charcoal at a dose in feed two or three times a day. (See treatment for 
" Indigestion.")

DISEASES OF THE RESPIRATORY OR

(Including Diseases of the Lungs, Bronchial Tubes, Throat, Etc.) 

PNEUMONIA— INFLAMMATION OF THE 1,UNGS.— Pneumonia 
is an inflammation of the lung tissues and may affect one or both lungs. 

CAUSES. — It is caused by exposure, over exertion and parasites in the 
lungs and is the result of congestion following chills and other diseases of the 
higher air passages. 

SYMPTOMS. — If it does not follow an acute congestion there may be 
shivering followed with a hot skin and fever with some cough. The horse 
stands with the forelegs apart, elbows turned out, nose poked out and as 
near an open window as possible and he breathes with a sort of moan. By 
sounding the chest you hear a crackling noise and as the disease procuresses 
there is some discharge from the nose. When suffering with pneumonia the 
horse generally stands up, while the cow lies down. 

TREATMENT. — Give a nice, airy box stall with a south window which 
is kept open. Apply mustard and water to the sides once a day. The bowels 
should be kept open but not too loose. Give some aconite or acetanilide to 
reduce the fever ; also, feed the patient well and after the fever subsides give 
tonics. 
PEOPLE'S HOME REMEDIES FOR PNEUMONIA OR LUNG 

FEVER. 

1. Whiskey. — Every four or five hours give 6 ounces of good whiskey 
diluted with a pint of water. If the horse will not eat food and will drink 
milk, give him 3 or 4 gallons a day with 3 or 4 fresh eggs stirred into each 
gallon. 

2. Quinine. — Make 1 dram of sulphate of quinine into a ball with a 
sufficient quantity of linseed meal ,and molasses and give one of these balls 
every three hours during the height of the fever. 

PEOPLE'S HOME REMEDIES FOR CONGESTION OF THE LUNGS.— 

1. Whiskey, Brandy, Etc. — Every hour give a quarter of a pint of either 
whiskey or brandy in a pint of water. Hand rub and bandage the legfs to 
■draw the blood to these parts. It is also well to rub the legs thorougfhly 
with a liniment composed of equal parts of' extract of witch hazel, alcohol, 
spirits of camphor and water. Use two or three times a day. 

2. Aromatic Spirits of Ammonia and Whiskey. — Give one ounce aro- 
matic spirits of ammonia and a teacupful of whiskey in a pint of cold water 
as a drench every two hours until his legs become warm and his body 
comfortable. 

PLEURISY. — Pleurisy is an inflammation of the membrane which lines 
"the chest and extends over the lungs. 

CAUSES. — Nearly all the common causes of diseases of the air passages 
may cause pleurisy, and it is sometimes the result of injury. 

SYMPTOMS. — There is some fever, a quick pulse and a crease extend- 

86 



36 THE PEOPLE'S HOME STOCK BOOK. 

ing from the elbow to the flank. Pressure between the ribs causes pain. 
By sounding the lungs a sort of rasping noise is heard. The horse has very- 
little if any appetite. There is some coughing, but by tapping the chest 
a hollow sound is caused and there should be no rasping noise heard when the 
ear is placed to the breast. 

TREATMENT. — The bowels should be opened by giving epsom salts 
or raw linseed oil and it is also important to apply hot applications to the 
sides. Mustard and water or home liniments applied twice daily give relief. 
Water may accumulate in the chest; if so, give digitalis or iodide of potas- 
sium, or it may be necessary to tap the chest. 

BRONCHITIS. — Bronchitis is an inflammation of the mucous membrane 
lining the bronchial tubes. These tubes are formed by the branching of 
the lower end of the windpipe and they themselves branch in the lungs. 

CAUSES. — It is often the result of an inflammation of the upper air pas- 
sages when a recovery did not take place, or it may be the result of colds ot 
exposure. 

SYMPTOMS. — The animal breathes with a sort of grunt, refuses food, 
has a cough and if you listen at the breast a roaring sound is heard. The 
pulse quickens somewhat and the temperature rises. 

•TREATMENT. — Allow fresh air but keep the body warmly covered 
and free from draft. Place the horse in a comfortable stable. The breast 
should be rubbed twice a day with mustard and water or with some 
good home liniment. Give one dram fluid extract belladonna, one-half ounce 
tincture of opium and one ounce alcohol in a pint of cold water at a dose 
three or four times a day. Steam with creosote or carbolic acid twice a day 
and keep the bowels open. 
PEOPLE'S HOME REMEDIES FOR BRONCHITIS.— 

1. Steaming with Carbolic Acid. — Put a tablespoonful of carbolic acid 
into a bucket of hot water and have the horse inhale the vapor. In bad 
cases this treatment should be repeated every hour. Stirring the water 
will cause it to give off more steam. 

HEAVES— BROKEN WIND.— Heaves in horses is closely allied to the 
disease asthma in man but the symptoms seem to be much more continuous. 

CAUSES.— Feeding on clover or musty, badly-cured fodder of any kind 
is likely to bring on heaves ; besides, feeding too much bulky non-nutritiou* 
fodder and over exertingthe animal when the stomach is very full are com- 
mon causes of broken wind. Diseases of the lungs sometimes terminate in 
heaves. This disease sometimes attacks two-year-old colts; however, it is 
principally a disease of middle-aged or old horses. A horse with a small 
chest and of delicate constitution is most liable to heaves and it is this kind 
that seems to come honestly by heaves. 

SYMPTOMS. — The nostrils usually stand open, the horse has a short, 
dry cough and a wheezing noise is heard in the throat. There is a sort of 
double lift to the flanks every time the animal breathes. Nearly every 
broken-winded horse has more or less indigestion, is inclined to eat far too 
much, bloats and passes gas and, strange to say, is fond of filthy fodder. 
The muscles of the body are generally soft and flabby and if put to very 
hard work it loses flesh. This is perhaps the result of both stomach and 
lung trouble. The symptoms I have mentioned can be greatly modified by 
limiting the amount of bulky food and water; also by giving drugs which 
have a sedative effect. 



HORSE— DISEASES OF THE RESPIRATORY ORGANS. 37 

TREATMENT. — If it is possible to ascertain what has caused the heaves 
and remove that cause the ailment can soon be somewhat relieved, but it 
is well to limit the amount of bulky fodder and it should be of good quality 
and all the better if it is wet with lime water. This is made by dropping 
a pound or two of lime into a bucket of water, pouring off the first' water, 
then refilling and continuing to refill until the lime is all dissolved. Water 
will take up only so much lime and no more so there is no danger of making 
it too strong. Keep the bowels open, give opium, belladonna, digitalis, 
lobelia, arsenic, stramonium and tar water. If there is much discharge, give 
one dram sulphate of copper at a dose twice daily. Water before feeding 
grain. 
PEOPLE'S HOME REMEDIES FOR HEAVES OR BROKEN WIND.— 

1. Proper Feeding. — Feed corn stalks, moist hay, carrots, beets, pota- 
toes, etc. The hay should be moistened so as to prevent irritation. For 
two or three weeks give arsenic in three-grain doses twice a day. Also 
keep^the boweld open with laxatives. 

3. Phosphorus. — For eight or ten days give 8 or 10 drops of tincture 
of phosphorus in the drinking water several times a day. 

3. Ear Corn, — Feed nothing but ear corn for six or seven months. One 
man says he has seen useless horses entirely cuj-ed in this way. 

ROARING. — This, properly speaking, is not a disease but a symptom. 
It is breathing with a loud and unnatural sound, due to paralysis of the vocal 
cords and a sweetened condition of the dilator muscles of the larynx. 

CAUSES. — There are many different causes that may produce roaring. 
M'alformation of the air passages, nasal polypus or a closing of one nostril, 
will produce the sound, but in a genuine case of roaring the vocal cords 
and muscles are usually paralyzed or atrophied. Any irritation of the larynx 
that lasts very long may cause degeneration of the muscular fibres and pro- 
duce roaring. Strangles (distemper) may terminate in roaring. Tight rein- 
ing is another cause. 

SYMPTOMS. — The symptoms are shown in most cases when the animal 
is exerted much. In mild cases he may not make much noise but may whistle 
slightly, which indicates a thickened condition of the mucous membrane of 
the larynx. A whistle of this kind has a right to cause suspicion for few 
sound horses make this noise. 

TREATMENT. — Feed a good quality of food and no clover or musty, 
badly-cured fodder of any kind. Apply home liniments or mustard and water 
to the throat daily, or apply some iodine ointment. Give one-dram doses 
iodide potassium twice a day for two or three weeks. When the vocal cord 
muscles are paralyzed and much atrophied mild remedies do but little good. 
The operation of tracheotomy is helpful to many or a surgical operation on 
the throat and removing the vocal cords frequently proves successful. 

HICCOUGHS OR THUMPS— SPASM OF THE DIAPHRAGM- 
PALPITATION. — Palpitation is a sudden, violent and convulsive beating of 
the heart. Palpitation should not be confounded with hiccoughs or thumps 
for they are the result of a spasm of the diaphragm and not an affection of 
the heart. The causes are very similar to those that bring on congestion of 
the lungs and sometimes colic. Place the ear back of the heart and you will 
soon determine that it is not a heart beat, but a jerking sort of noise back of 
the heart; besides, the heart sound is usually more feeble. If the spasm is 
not relieved death may be the result. 



38 THE PEOPLE'S HOME STOCK BOOK. 

TREATMENT. — Apply mustard and water directly over the seat of 
the noise or apply a light blanket wrung out of hot water to the chest and 
side, covering it with dry blankets and a rubber cover. Give one ounce 
sweet spirits of nitre, two drams fluid extract opium, twenty-five drops ex- 
tract of digitalis and one-half dram fluid extract nux vomica in a pint of cold 
water every two or three hours until relief is obtained. If you have none 
of this medicine on hand give one-half pint of whiskey and a tablespoonful 
of ginger in a pint of cold water and repeat it every three hours. Avoid 
giving the animal large quantities of ice-cold water at a time but give ginger 
in the feed. He should be fed a moderate quantity of well-cured fodder and 
grain and exercised moderately for a week or two until he recovers. Also, 
avoid over exerting him. 

LARYNGITIS— SORE THROAT.— The larynx is situated near the 
root of the tongue and upper portion of the windpipe and lies between the 
lower jawbones. Usually, when there is sore throat the larynx and its lining 
mucous membrane become inflamed. The pharynx, situated at the upper 
end of the gullet, is usually more or less inflamed also, 

CAUSES. — Exposure to cold winds when in a heated condition or in- 
haling foul air, dust or poisonous gases are the causes. 

SYMPTOMS. — There is always more or less difficulty in swallowing 
and when drinking water a portion will often be returned through the nose. 
There is an increased flow of saliva, sometimes external swelling of the throat 
an extension of the nose, a reddened appearance of the lining membrane 
of the nostrils, some rise of temperature, generally a cough, and usually the 
animal refuses to eat dry feed. 

TREATMENT. — The animal should be placed in a comfortable, clean, 
dry and well-ventilated stable and if convenient allowed to inhale twice a 
day some medicated steam; however, this is not always necessary. The 
animal should be supplied with plenty of cold drinking water and fed braa 
mash, ground grain and vegetables made moist with warm water. Dissolve 
one ounce chlorate of potash in one pint of water and inject some into the 
mouth four or five times a day. It is not good practice to drench a horse 
that has sore throat for fear that a portion of the drench will go down the 
windpipe and bring on bronchial pneumonia. Apply one part kerosene 
(coal oil) and five parts sweet oil or raw linseed oil or lard to the throat 
once or twice a day; or, apply any good home liniment, such as equal parts 
aqua ammonia, turpentine and sweet oil. Hot poultices or mustard and 
water or antiphlogistine or any vegetable poultice will have a tendency to 
relieve the throat. If an abscess, forms it should be opened and treated as 
I have directed for abscesses.

be used instead. 

MALIGNANT SORE THROAT.— (See " Cattle Department.") 

TRACHEOTOMY.— (Inserting tube in windpipe.)— Tracheotomy con- 
sists in making on opening into the trachea or windpipe to prevent death from 
suffocation in acute cases of throat trouble or choking. It is also resorted 
to with considerable success in roarers where there is a paralysis of the vocal 
cords or a changed condition of the throat, interfering and making it difficult 
for a horse to breathe freely. It is a very simple thing to perform this 
operation ; just open the skin about two inches long, some eight or ten inches 
from the throat, and if the tube is going to be left in but a short time open 
one of the rings of th' windpipe or cut out a circular piece, making a hole 
large enough for the ube. This tube should be clean when it is inserted; 
also, it should be taken out and cleaned daily. This is best done by boiling 
the tube for ten minutes or dipping it into a two per cent, solution of carbolic 
acid and water. I have often found it necessary to perform this operation 
in severe cases of distemper and sore throat. The operation appears to be 
difficult; however, it is far from it. If you are unable to secure the serv- 
ices of a veterinarian and you have a tube, do not hesitate to put it into the 
horse yourself for you may thus save the life of a valuable animal. 

CATARRH. — Catarrh is a congestion, inflammation or irritation of any 
mucous membrane of the body. When the membranes of the head are 
affected it is called " nasal catarrh " and I shall now give causes, symptoms 
and treatment for this ailment. 

CAUSES. — The most common causes are exposure of thin, weak animals 
to storms and cold winds and standing in drafts when ill a heated condition 
and also inhaling dust, smoke and poisonous gases. 

SYMPTOMS. — At first when the animal has just taken cold the mucous 
membrane is dry and parched-like; some hours later a watery discharge 
takes place, followed some days later by a thick, pus-like mucus. In many 
cases there is some loss of appetite and slight fever followed by more or less 
weakness. 

TREATMENT. — It is important to give the animal good care and pre- 
vent his catching any more cold. He should be kept in a clean, well-ven- 
tilated stable and fed well-salted bran mashes and vegetables or any other feed 
that he craves, for if he has much fever he will refuse grain. I have seen 
many cases greatly benefited by steaming the head. For this purpose add 
some creosote or carbolic acid to boiling water, a teaspoonful or two to. a 
bucket of water. A teakettle is very convenient for this work. Sometimes 
buildings are fired tJirough carelessness in steaming. Use an alcohol or kero- 
sene stove or lamp to heat the water and be careful. Give a tablespoonful 
of the following compound powder at a dose in feed or with a spoon 
three times a day. Of sulphate iron, ground gentian, ginger and nitrate potash, 
take equal parts by weight. If the bowels are costive give eight ounces 
raw linseed oil daily until they open. If the horse coughs much give a 



40 THE PEOPLE'S HOME STOCK BOOK. 

tablespoonful of laudanum and a teaspobnful of chloroform in three ounces 
of sweet oil three timfes a day until, the cough is relieved. 
PEOPLE'S HOME REMEDIES FOR CATARRH IN THE HEAD OR 
HEAVES.— 

1. Western Hay. — Feed western prairie hay with which the resin plant 
is mixed. 

2. Steaming. — Have the horse inhale steam from a bucket of hot water. 
The steam should be inhaled five times a day and from fifteen to twenty 
minutes each time. 

NASAL GLEET. — Nasal gleet is a chronic catarrh of the nose and upper 
air passages and is usually the result of neglected cases of cold in the head 
or simple catarrhal fever. 

CAUSES. — Nearly all cases of nasal gleet are the result of fracttires, 
diseased roots of grinder teeth, diseased "bones, or neglected catarrh. 

SYMPTOMS. — This ailment is attended by a nasty discharge from one 
or both nostrils and is often mistaken for glanders. When the breath is 
offensive it indicates a diseased tooth or bone. T. S is not a contagious 
disease. 

TREATMENT. — The most important step to be taken in the treatment 
of nasal gleet is to ascertain the cause, if it is possible to do so, and remove 
it. When the discharge comes from a diseased tooth, pulling it out is the 
remedy. If a bone is diseased, scrape off the diseased part and it wili heal. 
Dissolve six drams boric acid in a quart of water and wash out nose twice' 
a day. Give % ounce sulphate iron and two drams nitrate potash in feed 
twice a day for twenty days ; and, if not then well, give five one-dram doses 
sulphate of copper in feed three times a day. I have often found it neces- 
sary to cut (trephine) through the bone of the face in order to wash out the 
nose and head thoroughly. This is the only way to bring about a recovery 
in bad cases. 

PEOPLE'S HOME REMEDIES FOR CHRONIC NASAL CATARRH 

OR NASAL GLEET.— 

1. Sulphur. — Burn sulphur in the stable so that the horse will inhale 
the fumes but be careful not to suffocate the animal. 

3. Lime. — It is well to sprinkle chloride of lime about the stable and 
to put some under the hay in the manger so that the horse will inhale the 
fumes while eating. 

3. Copperas. — Give a teaspoonful powdered copperas at a dose in feed 
two or three times a day, 

MALIGNANT CATARRH.— (See " Cattle Department.") 
CHRONIC COUGH. — Chronic cough very often exists without any 
apparent or known cause. It may also follow sore throat and may be as- 
sociated with chest diseases, indigestion, stomach worms, bots, derangement 
of the pneumogastric nerve, etc. 

CAUSES. — It very often follows distemper, influenza, sore throat, pneu- 
monia, enlarged glands of the throat and the feeding of badly-cured clover, 
musty fodder and bulky non-nutritious food that deranges the stomach and 
digestive organs. 

SYMPTOMS. — Coughing much without any discharge whatever from 
the nose or without any apparent cause is sufficient evidence that it is a 
chronic ailment. Furthermore, if it has lasted long it must necessarily be 



HORSE— DISEASES OF THE RESPIRATORY ORGANS. 41 

chronic. By applying slight pressure to the throat the animal will usually 
hack and cough several times. 

TREATMENT. — It is well to keep in mind that every good cough 
remedy used and prescribed in human practice is equally as effectual in' veter- 
inary practice. However, the dose should be from six to twelve times as 
much. Fairly good results follow giving % dram gum camphor, % dram pow- 
dered digitalis arid % dram powdered opium, at a dose, either in feed or with 
a spoon two or three times a day. Or, give two drams muriate ammonia, y% 
dram powdered lobelia and two drams of powdered saltpeter at a dose in 
feed or with a spoon. Or, dissolve i/^ dram iodide ,potassium in % pint of 
water and pour over feed twice a day. The same external applications that 
I have recommended for sore throat should be used occasionally in the treat- 
ment of chronic cough. 
PEOPLE'S HOME REMEDIES FOR COUGHS, HEAVES AND ALL 

THROAT AND LUNG TROUBLES.— 

1. Coughs, Heaves, Etc. — Give two tablespoonfuls of powdered licorice, 
a tablespoonful ground ginger, a teaspoonful powdered digitalis leaves, one- 
half teaspoon ful powdered lobelia and one-third of a teaspoonful of powdered 
opium at a dose in damp feed night and morning. Also wet his fodder 
with lime water, which is made by adding a pound of lime to a bucket of 
water. Pour off the first water which is a little bitter, then refill and use. 

PNEUMOTHORAX— AIR OR GAS IN THE CHEST.— This is gen- 
erally due to a changed condition of the liquid, having undergorae some sort 
of decomposition in the chest. It is also the result of chest punctures or 
broken ribs. 

TREATMENT. — Whenever fluid, air, or gas can be drawn from the chest 
this should be done. I have obtained good results by injecting one part 
carbolic acid and two hundred and fifty parts water into the chest after the 
operation of tapping. 

HYDROTHORAX— WATER IN THE CHEST— DROPSY OF THE 
LUNGS. — Hydrothorax is not a disease but a result of other ailments such 
as pleurisy, pleuro-pneumonia, heart trouble or debilitating diseases. 

SYMPTOMS. — Whenever water commences to accumulate in the chest, 
the animal very often seems to revive and appear better; however, the good 
symptoms are not always lasting for the water must soon be absorbed or the 
case ends in death. Listen and you can hear a splash in the chest and if 
there is much water it must be let out or death soon follows. Even tapping 
very often gives only temporary relief. Give the animal two drams of fluid 
extract of digitalis and two drams of iodide potassium two or three times daily. 

NASAL POLYPUS. — A nasal polypus is a small tumor in the nostril, 
very much the shape of a pear or top and it very often interferes with 
breathing. 

CAUSES. — It is not always easy to tell what causes them ; however, 
they are often the result of wounds or some foreign substance lodging in 
the nostril and setting up irritation' which is followed by these growths. 

SYMPTOMS. — Very often the first symptom is a slight discharge from 
the nostril and this discharge is frequently mixed with blood. The horse 
breathes with some difficulty, making a snuffling sort of sound. 

TREATMENT.— These tumor-like bodies should be removed and this 



43 THE PEOPLE'S HOME STOCK BOOK. 

is best done with a pair of forceps or pincers. When removed they are likely 
to bleed freely. This hemorrhage is best stopped by applying one part tinc- 
ture of iron and twelve parts water; or, dissolve two ounces of alum in a 
pint of water and apply by saturating a sponge or cotton and holding it 
on the wound. Either hot or cold water will have the same effect. It is 
well to keep in mind that a nasal polypus should be removed as soon as it 
is noticed, for the operation is much more easily performed when it is small 
and there is much less danger from hemorrhage. 



DISEASES OF THE URINARY ORGANS. 

(Including Diseases of the Kidneys and Bladder.) 



KIDNEY AILMENTS. — Diseases of the urinary organs of horses are 
not nearly so common as in man. However, we do find them prevailing in 
certain localities where limestone is abundant and where resinous plants grow ; 
we also find kidney troubles caused by horses pasturing on damp low lands 
and by eating a poor quality of fodder. We also find kidney ailments coming 
on for want of enough water. It is often brought on from giving drugs which 
act harshly on the kidneys, or from giving diuretic medicine for too long a 
time. It may result from liver disease. Far too many horse owners have 
wrong beliefs regarding kidney diseases of the horse for they are not nearly 
so common as supposed. 

SYMPTOMS. — The general symptoms of kidney disease, if it is acute, are 
a straddling gait with the hind legs, tender loins and a straining to pass 
urine. The urine is either passed with difficulty or it dribbles away. In horses 
and cattle the urinary organs can very often be examined by introducing the 
hand into either the bowel or vagina. A certain class of urinary ailments can 
be diagnosed only by making an examination of the urine. 
PEOPLE'S HOME REMEDIES FOR RETENTION OF URINE.— 

1. Turpentine. — Mix one part of turpentine with five or six times the 
quantity of sweet oil and apply to the small of the back once a day. This 
remedy can be depended upon in every case. 

2. Nitre. — Give one ounce of sweet spirits of nitre every hour until re- 
lieved and rub the back with spirits of camphor. 

3. Nitre and Spanish Fly. — In severe cases of retention of urine give 1^/2 
ounces of sweet spirits of nitre mixed with five or ten grains of Spanish Fly. 
Repeat every hour until relief is obtained. It is also "well to rub the back 
with a mixture of ginger and mustard. 

INFLAMMATION OF THE BLADDER— CYSTITIS.— (See " Cattle 
Department.") 
PEOPLE'S HOME REMEDIES.— 

1. Borax, Etc. — The bladder should be washed out twice a day with a 
solution of a dram of borax to a quart of water. Give linseed tea or slippery 
elm tea in the drinking water. Apply mustard over the loins and to the back 
part of the abdomen. The diet should be light, such as roots, bran mashes, 
grass, etc. 

NEPHRITIS— ACUTE INFLAMMATION OF THE KIDNEYS— 
ALSO CHRONIC INFLAMMATION OF KIDNEYS.— Inflammation of the 
kidneys is not a very common ailment in horses and it is not by any means 
the most common disease of the kidneys. It is most likely to occur in the 
chronic form and we often find only one kidney involved. 

CAUSES. — Exposure to cold wet rains, sleet, and cold wind storms, 
especially after an exhaustive drive, causes the animal to chill suddenly after 
being over-heated. It also follows giving large and r£peated doses of salt- 
peter, resin and other drugs that act on the kidneys. It sometimes follows 

43 



44 THE PEOPLE'S HOME STOCK BOOK. 

the application of fly blisters to the loins on account of an absorption of can- 
tharides. 

SYMPTOMS. — Very often azoturia is confounded with nephritis. The 
animal has more or less fever, the heart action is quicker, the animal exhibits 
some pain, very often turning the nose to the seat of this pain and very often 
pointing his nose to his kidneys. Uremic poisoning may set in and if so the 
animal acts as if intoxicated. Pressure applied to the loins is not a reliable 
test. Passing the hand into the rectum and finding undue heat in the loins 
leads one to suspect nephritis. In well marked cases casts of the kidney 
tubes may be discovered in the urine. 

TREATMENT. — First of all lessen the work on the kidneys by stimu- 
lating the bowels and skin glands into greater activity. Give fifteen drops of 
tincture of aconite at a dose four or five times a day. Apply mustard and 
water to the loins or apply warm antiphlogistine. If the animal suffers much 
pain give one-ounce doses of laudanum every two or three hours, also give 
one ounce of hypo-sulphite soda three times a day for four or five days. Feed 
a good quality of food but not too much of it. 
DIABETES INSIPIDUS— DIURESIS— PROFUSE STALLING.— 

Excessive secretion of urine is an indication that the animal suffers from 
diuresis. 

CAUSES. — The reckless use of drugs and dosing of horses with quack 
nostrums will bring on this ailment; however, feeding musty and badly cured 
fodder or grain, or bran that has soured and heated is a very common cause. 
New oats, distillery refuse and plants which act severely on the kidneys brin|f 
it on. I have seen a whole flock of sheep and all the horses in a large stable 
suffer from eating badly cured fodder or from eating acrid plants. Exposure 
to wet and cold, also feeding too much salt and thus irritating the stomach and 
increasing the thirst will som.etimes bring on this disease. 

SYMPTOMS. — There is a frequent passing of a large quantity of pale 
urine which is of very low specific gravity ; there is a falling off in condition 
and the horse grows weak and perspires when not exerted very much. The 
urine has no odor and contains very little solid mater but a great deal of it 
may be passed in a day. The skin usually becomes dry and harsh, he appears 
hide-bound and has the appearance of ill health but may live for months. 

TREATMENT. — In the early stages a recovery soon follows a removal 
of the cause and a change of food. Feed well cured fodder, keep the bowels 
open, feed no new hay. Give two drams iodide of potassium daily, also give 
two drams of phosphate of iron, two drams gentian and two drams powdered 
cinchona at a dose in feed twice a day. Give plenty of hearty food and a 
recovery will take place much more quickly. In some cases 1 have given 
creosote with good results ; however, this is not always necessary. If occur- 
ring in the winter, be sure to ventilate your stable, let in fresh air day and 
night and keep the stable clean and free from foul gas. 

BLOODY URINE— H.S:MATURIA.—H3ematuria, or blood in the urine, 
is quite common in cattle and sheep, but not in horses. 

CAUSES. — It is generally the result of a sprain or injury but is sometimes 
due to calculi or stone in the bladder or kidneys or to fracture of the back- 
bone. 

SYMPTOMS. — If the blood comes away with the urine and pretty well 
mixed it is generally kidney hemorrhage, but if there are clots it must be com- 
ing from other parts. 




PNEUMONIA OR LUNG FEVER. 

A horse with pneumonia always stands up while a cow with pneumonia always lies down. 
This six-year-old mare is recovering from a bad attack of pleura-pneumonia. She lost 200 lbs. 
in weight in 10 days. Note the anxious eye and haggard appearance. Forelegs are held 
far apart. , ■ i_ i \

AZOTURIA. 

This 1800-lb. draft mare took Azoturia, became paralyzed, laid in a Cleveland street for 
four hours, was hauled in an ambulance to Dr. Fair's Veterinary Hospital, remained down for 
three days and when photographed was recovering but still weak in left hind leg and swollen on 
rump. Also a large sitfast (fibrous tumor) was removed from the shoulder while at the hospital. 
Azoturia is caused by over-feeding and under-exercising. 

(Photographed at Dr. Fair's Veterinary Hospital especially for this book.) 



HORSE— DISEASES OF THE URINARY ORGANS. 45 

TREATMENT. — It is important to remove the cause. Also change the 
feed and give a tablespoonful of tincture of chloride of iron in a pint of water 
two of three times a day, or give a teaspoonful fluid extract ergot two or three 
times a day. 
PEOPLE'S HOME REMEDIES.— 

1. Slippery Elm Tea and Lithia. — Give freely of slippery elm tea and 
then give one-half ounce of lithia. If the discharge is excessive apply cold 
water to the loins. 

AZOTURIA— PARTIAL PARALYSIS OF HIND QUARTERS.— Azo- 
turia belongs to the class of dietetic diseases, usually resulting from too gener- 
ous feeding of concentrated food without giving the horse sufiRcient fresh air 
and exercise. It may be defined as a hyper-nitrogenous condition of the blood 
and whole system. This excessive loading of the blood, with nitrogen seems 
only to take place when the animal is stabled, kept qui^t and over-nourished 
on grain. When the blood is charged with an excess of nitrogen and carried 
through the system it seems to be inclined to settle in the myolemma or cover- 
ings of the deep muscles of the haunch. This seems to cause a partial or 
complete loss of motor power in the hind quarters. This disease is known by 
many different names such as azoturia, paralysis, kidney disease, spinal dis- 
ease, hysteria, enzootic hasmaturia and hsemaglobinuria. However, it is most 
commonly known by the name of " azoturia." 

CAUSES. — It can be safely stated that this disease is caused by too much 
albumen and this albumen is produced by over-feeding on grain when the 
horse is idle and not exercised, and by the kidneys acting in an improper 
manner. The system seems to load with urea and hippuric acid which are 
secreted by the liver, and the nervous system, no dovtbt, becomes affected by 
the urea. Now when the horse is exercised and the blood circulates rapidly, 
it being highly charged with albumen, it undergoes rapid oxidation, exerting 
a peculiar affect on the muscles of the back and hind quarters and causing 
either partial or complete loss of motion. It is supposed to be a disease of 
the kidneys or spinal cord but this is not correct for it is more nearly a disease 
of the liver ; the liver fails to transform albuminoids into urea and fills up the 
gland and the circulating fluid with partially oxidized products which pass off 
later by the kidneys. Quick or violent exercise is far more likely to bring on 
an attack than moderate or slow exercise. The urea no doubt acts upon the 
nerves, bringing on a spasm of the muscles of the hind quarters. When the 
stpmach and bowels are very full and the horse put to fast or hard work this 
d'isease soon develops, especially if his kidneys are not active and the bowels 
are costive. Azoturia may occur at any season of the year ; however, it is 
much more common in the cold winter months than in summer; as a rtile, a 
rest of a day or two or more is required to bring it on. It rarely comes on 
without exercise ; however, I have known it to occur without it. 

SYMPTOMS. — The symptoms of azoturia are unlike those of other dis- 
eases and are very plain. After a few days rest the horse is brought out of the 
stable, having been well fed on grain and not, exercised. He seems in fine 
spirits, but before going far he becomes dull and sluggish, perspires freely, 
shows some stiffness in the loins and hind quarters and steps as though 
walking on a rolling stone. The animal walks stiff; knuckles on the fetlock, 
usually worse on one than the other and soon becomes so crippled that he can 
go no further. He then either remains standing still or falls down, suffering 
great pain. His pulse quickens and he frequently rolls, very often making un- 



46 THE PEOPLE'S HOME STOCK BOOK. 

successful efiforts to get up. He is able to do so in front but is partially para- 
lyzed behind and is only able to rise part way up. The muscles of the haunches 
contract firmly and generally enlarge. Azoturia occasionally affects the fore 
quarters and not the hind limbs. This form I do not regard as being nearly 
so fatal. When the loin muscles are much involved the animal suffers the 
most pain. This form is quite often thought to be broken back ; however, if 
you will inquire into the history of the case you will soon learn it is a case of 
azoturia and not fractured back. 

TREATMENT. — First of all let me say this is a preventable disease but 
not by any means always curable. This being the case, why should horse 
owners waste their feed on idle horses when the food is only acting as a 
slow poison? It is unnecessary to feed idle horses more than one-quarter the 
quantity of grain which they require when doing full work. Thin horses 
seldom suffer from azoturia. Clear out the bowels promptly by giving a full 
dose of cathartic medicine. Aloes five drams, podophylin % dram and ginger 
2 drams may be given at one dose, either in pill form or as a drench. Or, 
give one quart of raw linseed oil ; or give epsom or Glauber's salts. Also give 
copious injections of soap suds with oil added. Give %-ounce doses of bromide 
of potash every four hours. Draw off the urine if the horse is unable to pass 
it ; here is where many geldings are ruined. It is easy work to pass a catheter 
in the mare but not always so with a gelding. I find in most cases the animal 
will pass his water if let alone. Hot applications to the back and loins are 
very beneficial. It is of the utmost importance to keep the horse from going 
down ; therefore, if the animal were stopped and stabled when the attack first 
comes on, few deaths would result. If the horse ge;ts down, try to keep him 
from lying flat ; prop him up, hand rub his cold legs and ears, cover body with 
enough blankets to keep him warm and rub his back with mustard and water 
or some good home liniment. Let him drink plenty of water but it should 
not be too cold. Keep him quiet and comfortable. When the proper time 
comes, I have used slings to good advantage, but it does harm to sling a 
horse that is wholly unable to stand alone. The bowels, kidneys and skin 
should be kept moderately active while the animal is recovering and the 
horse should be fed sloppy mashes, some vegetables, and well cured hay or 
grass. In conclusion let me say — Exercise all heavy breeds of horses, be sure 
they have fresh air to breathe and when idle are fed not more than one-fourth 
or one-third the amount of grain required when working. Stop immediately 
when you notice your horse showing dullness, perspiring freely and crippling 
•behind when going slow soon after leaving the stable, and especially if he 
has been in the stable resting for two or more days. By observing what I 
have said you need have no fear of losing any horse with this fatal ailment. 
PEOPLE'S HOME REMEDIES FOR AZOTURIA.— 

1. Hot Fomentations, Etc, — First give a dose of from 4 to 6 drams of aloes 
and then give 4 drams of bromide of potassium mixed with an ounce of sweet 
spirits of nitre. The nitre and potassium may then be given every five or six 
hours if required to quiet the nervous excitement. Also apply hot water fo- 
mentations over the loins. The horse should be stopped immediately when 
an attack of azoturia comes on.

DISEASES OF THE GENERATIVE ORGANS OF 
BOTH THE HORSE AND MARE. 

(Including Foaling and Its Attending Difficulties.) 



BARRENNESS. — Failure to breed is quite often due to an acid secretion 
of the genital organs or it follows a retention of the afterbirth or is the result 
of infection where the germs of contagious abortion have been pjcked up. 
It may also be on account of an abnormal condition of the sexual organs of 
either male or female. An acid condition of the womb and vagina is quite 
common in mares and cows and when it exists conception will not as a rule take 
place. Animals that suffer from infectious abortion germs have a catarrhal 
inflammation of the womb and vagina; therefore, they are not so likely to 
become pregnant as well animals, and if they do', are likely to have a mis- 
carriage. Old animals are often barren and some young ones because of ex- 
cessive service. Closing of the neck of the womb prevents many mares from 
getting with foal. The standing wide open of the neck of the womb prevents 
some mares remaining pregnant. Any unnatural discharge coming from the 
womb generally prevents conception and also irritates the neck of the womb 
and is inclined to grow worse if not corrected. 

TREATMENT. — If it is due to an acid condition, dissolve one ounce of 
baking soda in a quart of clean water and wash out the vagina daily for two 
weeks or longer; or, put a tablespoonful of carbolic acid into three pints of 
water and wash out the vagina daily until she gets with foal, but do not mate 
the mare until you know she is well and has been opened within a few hours 
before she is bred. In opening the neck of the womb use clean hands with 
finger nails cut short, or use a rubber glove ; or, use a steel sound, which is the 
best. The yeast treatment is quite effective in curing barrenness in horses and 
cattle when the disorder is due to an acid condition of the genital tract. The 
solution is made as follows. Put two heaping teaspoonfuls of yeast into a 
pint of boiled water, set the solution near the stove or in the sun and maintain 
at a temperature of about 70 degrees, for four or five hours ; then add three 
pints of boiled water and keep it warm for five or six hours. By this time the 
solution will have a milky appearance and is ready for use. Flush the parts 
first with warm water, then inject the yeast. The animal should be mated 
from two to six hours after the vagina has been washed out with clean warm 
water and the yeast mixture applied. I have prescribed this treatment to a 
great many horse and cattle breeders who have tested its merits to their 
satisfaction. However, in cases where the animal does not come in heat it has 
no value. For such give twenty grains of powdered cantharides or one dram 
of tincture of cantharides at a dose in feed night and morning. This medicine 
I have found acts as well as any in stimulating the generative organs into 
action, but it is by no means a reliable remedy. 

ABORTION— MISCARRIAGE— SLINKING OF FOAL.— This consists 
of the expulsion of the foetus, generally before it can live, from the womb 
(uterus) ; however, the word " abortion " is used wrong many times in speak< 

47

ing of mares or animals which miscarry before the proper time for parturition 
arrives. 

CAUSES. — Injuries of many kinds may produce abortion. Among the 
causes are blows or pressure on the abdomen, disease "of the abdominal walls, 
acute indigestion, slips, falls, exhaustion, weakness, influenza, severe exer- 
tion, too active cathartics, death or deformity of foetus, ergotized food, smutty 
feed, impure water, germs in the uterine tract and also fright and bad odors. 

SYMPTOMS. — In the early stages of gestation it may take place without 
warning and no person know of it, for it does not make the animal very sick. 
The animal coming in heat again is of course evidence that she has aborted. 
A swelling of the external generative organs and a filling of the udder should 
prove a sort of warning. A discharge from the vagina during pregnancy is 
an indication that the mare may have had a miscarriage. 

TREATMENT. — Prevent as many of the causes which I have mentioned 
as possible and it will go a long way toward preventing abortion. When it 
follows an accident that is not too severe the animal soon recovers, even if 
very little is done in the line of treatment other than good care. The most 
important thing to consider is whether the miscarriage is due to infection or 
injury. If an infectious kind be in your stable, disinfectants should be used 
freely to stamp out the contagion and remember that cows and sheep very 
often infect mares. If the bowels are too loose and the labor pains come on 
without much relaxation, give one ounce of tincture of opium at a dose three 
times a day. If she loses her colt, burn it; wash stalls with one part carbolic 
acid to fifty parts water and also spread copperas on the floors; or, dissolve 
the copperas in water and sprinkle it on stalls and floors. Let her pass two or 
three periods of heat before having her served. Give tonics such as iron, gen- 
tian and ginger. 

SPAVma. -- (See " Cattle Department.") 

LEUCORRHEA— WHITES.— This is a disease affecting the mucous 
membrane of the uterus (womb) and sometimes of the vagina. Whenever 
there is an outpouring of a milky-looking discharge from the vagina there is 
always a sort of sub-acute inflammation of the parts which may be the result of 
a slight irritation caused by a retention of a portion of the placenta or after- 
birth. The disease is most common in old and debilitated animals. 

SYMPTOMS. — There is always a white discharge issuing from the vulva, 
enough in many cases to soil the thighs. Ovarian diseases sometimes give 
rise to leucorrhea. In some cases large quantities of mucus accumulate in 
the uterus and come away when the animal is exercised. This is especially 
likely to be the case if the animal stands with the forefeet a little lower than 
the hind ones. 

TREATMENT. — The treatment of leucorrhea should be both constitu- 
tional and local and the food should be highly nutritious, easily digested, laxa- 
tive in character and liberal in quantity. Give three drams powdered sulphate 
iron, two drams of ground gentian and one-half dram of iodide of potassium 
at a dose in feed three times a day. Dissolve two drams permanganate of 
potash or two ounces of carbolic acid in a gallon of tepid water and daily 
wash out the uterus and vagina with the aid of a rubber tube and funnel. Or, 
dissolve one-quarter pound of alum or two ounces of sulphate of zinc in a 
gallon of water and use in the same way. It is well to keep m mind that afte.- 
using active astringents for a few days the solution should be gradually 
weakened by adding water. There are many other excellent remedies, both it»

the line of tonics and astringents, that are sometimes as good as those I have 
mentioned, but they are more expensive. 

INFLAMMATION OF THE VAGINIA— VAGINITIS.— (See " Cattle 
Department.") 

METRITIS— INFLAMMATION OF THE WOMB.— Metritis or in- 
flammation of the womb is not a very common ailment of the mare but is quite 
common with cows. 

CAUSES. — When inflammation of the womb occurs in the mare it often 
follows using force or the improper use of instruments when assisting in the 
delivery during parturition and it may come from an invasion of micro-organ- 
isms which make their way into the uterus soon after foaling or it sometimes 
results from exposure and want of proper care. 

SYMPTOMS. — The mare shows more or less uneasiness, exhibiting a 
disposition to paw and to lie down and roll. She keeps the back somewhat 
arched and the temperature always goes up. There isj generally loss of appe- 
tite but great thirst. 

TREATMENT. — It is generally good practice to give twenty drops of 
tincture of aconite in some cold water every three hours until the fever re- 
duces ; or, giving one dram of acetanilide every four hours will also reduce the 
fever; or, give % ounce of saltpeter three times a day in the water. The 
pain should be subdued by giving tincture of opium (laudanum) in one-ounce 
doses every two hours until relieved. Or, give one dram fluid extract bella- 
donna every two hours ; or, give three grains morphine hypodermically. The 
latter will act quickly in relieving the pain and it should be repeated if neces- 
sary. Mustard and water applied over the back and around the flanks and 
abdomen are helpful. Liniments are also proper remedies but severe blisters 
are not necessary. The womb should be washed out with one part carbolic 
acid, two parts glycerine and fifty parts water which is of the same heat as 
the body. Any of the coal-tar disinfectants put into forty parts water will 
help. Or, dissolve two ounces sugar of lead in one gallon of tepid water and 
use twice daily. It is well to remember that the mare is more easily hurt 
during parturition than the cow; therefore, avoid using much force and be 
sure if you use instruments to have them perfectly clean. Also, the hands of 
the operator should be clean and his nails should be cut short and be made 
smooth. 

RUPTURE OF THE WOMB.— (See " Cattle Department.") 

EVERSION OF THE UTERUS OR WOMB.— This consists in the 
womb turning inside out and protruding through the vagina. It most fre- 
quently follows foaling when the after-pains continue. Or, it may be caused 
by the animal's standing with the hind parts too low. 

TREATMENT. — The womb should be kept clean and this is best done 
by placing a sheet under it. Place her hind parts twelve or fifteen inches 
higher than the fore parts or even higher than this; if she strains much give 
one-ounce doses of chloral-hydrate every two hours until she becomes quiet. 
Or, give one-ounce doses of tincture of opium every thirty minutes until she 
ceases to strain. Be sure that the afterbirth is not attached to the uterus 
when the parts are returned to place. Also notice that the womb is not rup- 
tured for if this is the case it should be stitched carefully with catgut and 
treated with antiseptic washes. A surcingle should be placed around the 
flank of the mare and she should be fed nutritious and easily digested, but not 
too much, bulky food, and should be kept in a position with ihe forefeet several 

3^

inches lower than the hind ones. It is very often necessary to put a few 
stitches in the upper part of the vulva and leave them in a few days. Besides, 
she should be given opium, chloral, belladonna or morphine to keep her from 
straining. Sometimes in returning the everted womb a rupture of the womb 
or vagina is made unless it is done cautiously. This occurs as a result of push- 
ing too hard against the everted parts with the ends of the fingers instead of 
the flat of the hand or fist. 

EVERSION OF VAGINA.— This consists in a turning out of the vagina, 
caused very often by standing with the hind feet considerably lower than the 
fore ones and also by crowding the bowels too full. Constipation is another 
common cause of eversion. 

TREATMENT. — Place the mare in a position in which the hind parts are 
not less than four or five inches higher than the fore parts. Limit her supply 
of bulky food and dissolve one ounce of alum and one-half ounce of sugar of 
lead in a quart of warm water and apply to the everted parts ten or twelve 
times a day. Or, apply one part carbolic acid and fifty parts water three or 
four times a day. The parts should be returned to place without injuring them, 
a few stitches taken in the upper part of the vulva to hold them in place, a 
surcingle applied to the flanks and it may be necessary to give her ounce 
doses of laudanum to prevent straining. 

CLEANING— REMOVING PLACENTA OR AFTERBIRTH.— When 
mares foal too early, the result of injury or infectious abortion, they do not 
always clean properly, the afterbirth remaining inside the womb with perhaps 
a portion hanging out of the vagina. If tiie bowels are not open give one piiit 
of raw linseed oil and one dram of fluid extract of belladonna, one dose only. 
Or, give injections of warm soap suds to empty the rectum, but if her bowels 
are moderably moist do not give more than one-half pint of oil and in some 
cases it is best to give none. If the afterbirth does not come away in twenty- 
four hours, remove it with clean hands, but the operator should have no sharp 
nails and the hand should be smeared with one part of carbolic acid and 
twelve parts of sweet oil. Also, give the mare twenty drops of carbolic acid 
and a teaspoonful of powdered saltpeter at a dose once a day for ten days 
and if a discharge continues inject one part carbolic acid and fifty parts , 
water, or, dissolve one ounce of alum in a quart of water and inject once a 
day until she is well. 

AFTER-PAINS FOLLOWING FOALING.— There are cases where the 
labor pains continue after the foal has been expelled from the womb, and in 
order to avoid making mistakes in giving quieting drugs you should pass the 
hand into the uterus and ascertain whether or not there is another colt in the 
womb and if this is the case allow the pains to continue until the foal is ex- 
pelled, then perhaps it will be necessary to give a stimulant, such as whiskey or 
wine. But if the after-pains are the result of nervousness, give one-half ounce 
doses of chloral-hydrate in one-half pint of cold water every hour or oftener 
until the mare gets relief. Or, give one ounce of tincture of opium (lauda- 
num), one-half ounce of fluid extract of ginger and four ounces of whiskey in 
a pint of cold water every hour until pain ceases. Cover her back and loins 
with plenty of clothing. If the womb tends to evert place her hind quarters 
a foot higher than the fore parts ; or, stitch the upper part of the vulva and 
apply a surcingle around the flank. 

BLEEDING AFTER FpALING— FLOODING.— Considerable hemor- 
rhage sometimes follows foaling on account of the womb's being injured or 



HORSE— DISEASES OF GENERATIVE ORGANS. 51 

everted and its failure to contract after its relaxed state. By passing the hand 
into the uterus it will be found full of blood clots. 

TREATMENT.— Give one-ounce doses of fluid extract of ergot every 
thirty or sixty minutes until bleeding ceases, but be sure to use fresh ergot 
for this drug becomes worthless after it is about a year old. 

DROPSY— SWELLING OF THE BELLY BEFORE FOALING.— 
This is a condition that exists very often in brood mares and commences three 
or four weeks before foaling time and many very good mares are troubled 
in this way without showing the slightest symptoms of disease. It is a result 
of improper elimination of the fluid from the body. 

TREATMENT. — Give the mare more exercise, change her feed, keep her 
bowels moist by feeding some well-salted bran mashes or vegetables, also 
give one-ounce doses of either fluid extract of buchu or powdered buchu 
in her feed once or twice a day before foaling and continue the treatment for 
a few days after foaling. 

GARGET— MAMMITIS— INFLAMMATION OF THE UDDER.— 
Mammitis, inflammation of the udder, or garget, is when an inflammation 
takes place in the glands that secrete the milk. 

CAUSES. — The common causes are injuries, the colt not sucking properly, 
lying on cold damp ground, or bacterial infection through the teat »pening. 

SYMPTOMS. — Either one or both sides of the udder become h®t,, tender 
and inflamed; a watery fluid is passed instead of milk; the mare walks with 
a straddling gait and sometimes she loses her appetite and has fever. In some 
cases pus comes from the udder and in other cases an abscess forms in the 
bag, requiring opening. 

TREATMENT.— /If her bowels are costive, give one-quarter pound of 
epsom salts every six hours until they open. Give one dram of fluid extract of 
belladonna and ten drops of tincture of aconite four or five times a day; also 
give her a teaspoonful of powdered saltpeter twice a day. Foment the bag 
with hot water and apply equal parts of extract of witch hazel, spirits of cam- 
phor, alcohol and sweet oil ; or, apply hot linseed oil. I frequently give them 
two-dram doses of fluid extract of Phytolacca root (poke) three times a day 
and apply extract of Phytolacca one part and vaseline eight parts to udder 
twice a day. In giving this drug, large doses very often act the best and three 
or four times the quantity I have prescribed may be given with safety. How- 
ever, giving two drams every two or three hours is a better way to medicate 
than to give large doses once or twice a day. 

MILK FEVER— PUERPERAL FEVER.— This is technically called 
" puerperal fever " and is a sort of fever occurring two or three days after 
foaling. It is always made worse by too much exercise, over exertion or ex- 
posure to storms. 

SYMPTOMS. — There is an increase in temperature, quick pulse, quick 
breathing, cold ears and legs, costive bowels and highly colored urine. The 
udder is inclined to be inflamed and to secrete very little, if any, milk. This 
ailment is most likely to affect a mare after having had her first colt. 

TREATMENT. — Place the mare in a warm, comfortable place, bandage 
her legs, clothe her body and treat her much the same as for mammitis.

GONORRHEA— GLEET— INFLAMMATION OF THE URETHRA. 

— This ailment often follows as a result of irritants in the urine which were 
taken by the mouth, from excessive copulation, connection with a newly de- 
livered female or one that has other infectious ailments, or from injury. 

SYMPTOMS. — There is swelling and soreness in the sheath and the 
horse evinces pain while passing urine. There is also a discharge of white 
mucus and if the membranes are examined they present a fiery and inflamed 
appearance. 

TREATMENT. — Apply hot fomentations, give a light dose of physic and 
foment the parts with hot water and when suppuration takes place use a 
soothing or astringent injection such as is made by dissolving two drams of 
permanganate of potash or two ounces of sugar of lead, or one ounce of 
sulphate of zinc, or one hundred grains of nitrate of silver, in a gallon of 
water and use any one of these lotions twice a day. Also, give one-half-ounce 
doses of citrate of potash or the same quantity of lithia at a dose two or three 
times a day. Feed sparingly of vegetables, but give mostly grain and well 
Cured fodder. In the male a stricture may occur from the use of too active 
astringents in the early stage of this disease. When this occurs it causes 
great pain in urinating and should be relieved by passing catheters or sounds 
of different sizes daily until the strictured portion of the urethra is dilated." 

INFLAMMATION OF THE TESTICLES— ORCHITIS.— (See " Cattle 
Department.") 

NYMPHOMANIA.— (See " Cattle Department.") 

CASTRATION. — Castration is usually performed during the months of 
spring and autumri, for it should not be done in zero weather or during the 
■ fly season. One year old is a good age to change colts and if it is done earlier, 
all the better, for they mind it less than when older. However, the testicles 
are not alvvays down in th^ scrotum much before the age of twelve months 
and sometimes they are later in descending. It is not necessary to throw a 
colt or even an old stallion to castrate him, unless he is a ridgling or is ruptured. 
A twitch should be placed on the nose or a war bridle put on him and if neces- 
sary the forefoot should be held up by an assistant or the hind legs hoppled 
above the hocks, leaving the connecting strap twelve or fourteen inches long. 
This will prevent his kicking you but should you be an experienced operator 
it is never necessary to go to this trouble for it requires only a ininute or two 
to complete the operation. The scrotum should be- washed off with soap and 
water. Then apply either alcohol or one part carbolic acid and thirty parts 
water. The instrument as well as the hands of the operator should be 
clean. Now, if not cast, make r. bold "incision exposing the testicle and it is 
wise to take out the smaller one first, cutting it off with the emasculator or 
ecraseur. There are many different methods of castration, such as actual 
cautery or burning off the cord with a red hot iron ; ligature, which means to 
tie the end of the cord or artery to prevent bleeding; torsion, which consists 
in twisting off the cord and applying caustic clamps to prevent hemorrhage. 
The ocraseur or emasculator is preferable to the other nientioned methods. I 
have castrated thousands of valuable animals and employed every known 
method, doing it whichever way the owner requested, but if left to my choice, 
I always use the emasculator and seldom throw a colt down if both testicles

are down and he is sound and normal. The only argument in favor of operat- 
ing while standing is to prevent accident in throwing and this is not great. 

RIDGLINGS.— (See " Cattle Department.") 

TROUBLES FOLLOWING CASTRATION.— There is always more or 
less pain and always some swelling of the scrotum but if there be no loss of 
appetite and not much fever, pay no attention to the colt or horse. The 
wound should be opened and some carbolic lotion (one part carbolic acid to 
thirty of water) applied daily. Or, apply iodoform and boric acid in eqnal 
parts daily. There will always be some suppuration, some adhesions, perhaps 
some secondary hemorrhage and, if extensive, it may be necessary to cast 
the colt or horse and grab the end of the cord with forceps and, after pulling 
out the cord, tie the artery with catgut or very fine silk. Peritonitis may follow 
the operation from exposure ; or, if the operation has not been done properly, 
tetanus, or lockjaw, sometimiCS follows this operation, but if iodoform gauze 
be placed in the wound and cleanliness observed at the time of the operation 
very few would have lockjaw following castration. Hernia is another ail- 
ment which follows castration and when it occurs treat it surgically. Abscess 
in the scrotum often follows and is easily treated. Open the parts freely and 
inject with one part carbolic acid and fifty parts water twice a day. Scirrhous 
cord often follows leaving the cord too long from the use of clamps in cas- 
tration. The cord adheres to the skin of the scrotum and is not released and 
a tumor grows on the end of the cord which, when cut oflf, soon gets well. 
This is not by any means a difficult operation unless the tumor has attained 
very large proportions. Then it is difficult to stop the bleeding. However, 
if the operator is energetic and cautious he will be fairly successful. I re- 
member of removing a very large 7-pound tumor from the trotting horse 
" Clingstone " which cost Mr. W. J. Gordon twenty thousand dollars. He 
made a perfect recovery and trotted several seasons afterwards, going faster 
than he had before and Mr. Gordon refused an offer of fifty thousand dollars 
from Mr. W. H. Vanderbilt of New York City. 

SWELLING AFTER CASTRATION.— If a colt swells but little after 
castration and if- there is but little suppuration with no loss of appetite, the 
case is usually doing nicely, but if the scrotum swells badly and the animal 
loses its appetite treatment should be prescribed. 

CAUSES. — By using dirty hands and instruments and by lack of general 
cleanliness during the operation the parts are often infected, setting up con- 
siderable inflammation. Besides, it also follows keeping the animal in filthy 
quarters after he is castrated. 

TREATMENT. — Keep the bowels open and the kidneys active. Open 
the wound in the scrotum with your finger but be sure the hand is clean and 
dipped in carbolized oil or disinfectant. Inject one part carbolid acid and 
thirty parts water into scrotum twice a day, also give a teaspoonful of pow- 
dered saltpeter twice a day. Fomenting the scrotum with hot water relieves 
the pain. Be sure to keep the colt in a clean stable or let him run out to 
pasture. 

BLEEDING AFTER CASTRATION.— More or less bleeding always 
occurs after castration. The blood may come from veins in the scrotum or 
from the artery of the cord ; if from the veins the blood is dark colored, but 
if from the artery it is of a bright red and comes away in jerks, shooting out 
with more force than if from a vein. 

TREATMENT. — Lay a wet blanket over the loins and dash cold water on 



54 THE PEOPLE'S HOME STOCK BOOK. 

and into the scrotum. Sometimes, pouring 'cold water on the loins stops it 
quickly. Stand the colt or horse with the forefeet lower than the hind ones. 
Dissolve four ounces of sugar of lead in a gallon of water and inject into the 
scrotum or dissolve one ounce each of alum and copperas in a pint of cold 
water and inject into the scrotum ; then pack the scrotum with cotton satur- 
ated with either of these lotions, removing the cotton next day. If the blood 
comes from the artery place a twitch or twist on the colt's nose and reacfe 
for the cord and tie a silk thread on the artery and this will stop bleeding. 
Injecting eqiial parts of Monsell's solution of iron and water, or injecting 
adrenalin into the scrotum generally stops bleeding. 
PEOPLE'S HOME REMEDIES.— For Bleeding from Castration.— 

1. Salt Water and Vinegar. — Wash thoroughly with salt water and then 
apply vinegar. 

2. Cold Water. — Dash cold water upon the parts. This will frequently 
stop the bleeding. 

3. Muriate of Iron. — Wet pledgets of tow in muriate of iron and stufif 
into the canal. 

4. Cold Pack on Back. — Place a wet towel or two on his loins and keep 
them wet with cold water. 

5. Tying. — Tie a string tight around the tail. 



DISEASES OF THE SKIN. 

(Including Scratches, Grease Heel, Mange, Surfeit, Hide-Bound, Warts, Etc.) 



SCRATCHES— MUD FEVER— CRACKED HEELS.— This is a con- 
dition common among race horses, affecting runners, trotters and pacers. It 
may be defined as an inflammation or irritation of the skin, brought on by 
washing or showering the legs with cold water or dirty soap suds. The 
heavy breeds of horses are no doubt more liable to cracked heels than the 
lighter breeds that are not subjected to the exciting causes. The disease 
usually affects white legs first and is more likely to occur in the hind ones. 

CAUSES. — Cracked heels follow washing the legs or exposing them to 
wet and filth without giving them proper care after a drive or a hard day's 
work. Heat and cold, acting alternately, seem to have a strong tendency to 
chap the skin. Friction is another cause or the application of strong irri- 
tating drugs. It is an ailment that seldom affects horses that have proper care. 

SYMPTOMS. — Usually the heels show a reddened appearance followed 
by swelling and small cracks and the skin exudes a fluid and the animal 
travels stiff. 

TREATMENT. — If the animal suffers much pain apply hot water and 
hot packs or poultices of linseed meal, boiled turnips or antiphlogistine 
which will allay the irritation. Dissolve one-quarter pound of sugar of lead, 
two ounces of sulphate of zinc and one ounce of powdered sulphate of copper 
in a gallon of water and apply to sore heels three times a day. Or, apply 
one part carbolic acid and thirty parts water and if the sores appear to be 
malignant and tardy in healing apply one part carbolic acid and fifteen parts 
water. In cases where the heels are dry and chapped some apply one part boric 
acid, one part powdered alum and five parts lanolin twice a day. The animal 
should be fed 'cooling laxative diet and if you believe his blood is bad give 
one dram iodide potassium at a dose two or three times a day. If the hair 
sheds, leaving the heel bald, apply one part boric acid and six parts vaseline 
daily. 
PEOPLE'S HOME REMEDIES FOR SCRATCHES.— 

1. Carrot Poultices. — Wash the parts thoroughly with warm soft water 
and castile soap, rinse with clear water, dry with a cloth and then apply a 
poultice of scraped carrots. Repeat this twice a day. 

2. Turnip and Charcoal Poultices. — Clean the parts with castile soap and 
water and then apply a poultice of boiled turnips which have been mashed 
and thickened with powdered charcoal. 

3. Glycerine and Sulphur. — At night apply a paste made of sulphur and 
glycerine, using just enough glycerine to give it a glossy appearance. In 
the morning apply glycerine alone. So continue until cured. 

4. Blue Vitriol, Alum, Vinegar, Etc. — To a quart of cider vinegar add 
an ounce each of copperas, nut gall, blue vitriol and alum. Warm this until 
dissolved and apply lightly to the affected parts once a day. Keep the bowels 
open with epsom salts. 

55 



56 THE PEOPLE'S HOME STOCK BOOK. 

5. White Lead and Linseed Oil. — Soften some white lead with linseed 
oil and, after washing and rubbing dry the affected parts, apply the lead and 
oil and repeat each night until cured. 

6. Ointment for Scratches. — To an ounce each of vaseline and sugar of 
lead add 30 drops of carbolic acid and make into an ointment. Always cleanse 
the parts thoroughly with warm water and castile soap and then dry before 
applying the ointment. 

GREASE HEEL. — This is a disease showing itself generally on the hind 
heels of the horse and producing an irritation of the parts which soon in- 
volves the hair-follicles and sebacious glands which soon give off a discharge. 
Heavy breeds of horses are much more likely to be affected than the lighter 
breeds. Some veterinarians are inclined to believe this ailment contagious 
and to be caused by the presence of a parasite; however, this has not yet 
,been proven to my satisfaction, but it is well to keep in mind that it may 
be communicated from one to another. 

CAUSES. — The causes of grease heel are both exciting and predisposing. 
The exciting causes are washing the legs too often and not drying them 
. properly, especially if the skin is white. The most common cause is cracked 
heels or scratches which it often follows and the same causes that produce 
the one will cause the other. Horses with round fleshy legs that are in- 
clined to stock and those that are kept in filthy stables or allowed to run 
in snow or slush or walk through putrid pools in the straw yard or used in 
mud and wet and that are not taken care of after their day's work are very 
likely to have grease heel. The skin in the region of the heel is very vasciilar 
and abundantly provided with oil glands; therefore, when exposed to irri- 
tants these parts are likely to become inflamed. No doubt, either overfeed- 
ing on rich nutritious food or feeding food of a poor quality has a tendency to 
produce grease heel. 

SYMPTOMS. — ^There is always more or less swelling of the parts, a 
slight discharge of oily fluid, and cracks and chaps of the skin with some 
eruption and generally lameness. 

TREATMENT. — The treatment of grease heel should consist in remov- 
ing the cause if possible and in taking steps to arrest the discharge and 
bring about a healthy condition of the diseased parts. It is always a 
mistake to apply too powerful astringents, but in their place use hot fomen- 
tations and poultices after the hair has been clipped off. Discontinue feeding 
grain, give a full dose of cathartic medicine and, after, the animal is purged, 
feed cooling laxative food, such as well salted bran mashes, vegetables and 
grass. Dissolve % pound of sugar of lead, three ounces sulphate of zinc and 
one ounce of carbolic acid in a gallon of clean water and apply to the swollen 
and inflamed legs three or four times a day. Or, dissolve ten grains of 
chloride of zinc in a pint of water and apply three or four times daily. Or, 
dust on powdered charcoal or use bromo-chloral and after the sores heal and 
scabs form on them apply some glycerine. Whenever the disease assumes 
a malignant type and ugly looking sores appear, touch them with crude car- 
bolic acid or dust them over with burnt alum or with nitrate of silver or 
use a red hot iron. In using either caustics or the actual cautery it must be 
done with care or the healthy parts may be injured. I have often applied 
yeast poultices and also turnip or carrot poultices and obtained good results 
in the early treatment of this ailment. Give three-dram doses of powdered 
saltpeter at a dose in feed three times a day in the early stage of this ail- 



HORSE— DISEASES OF SKIN. 57 

ment; in the later stage give three or four-dram doses of Fowler's solution 
of arsenic two or three times a day for fifteen or twenty days. 
PEOPLE'S HOME REMEDIES FOR GREASE HEEL.— 

1. Oxideof Zinc Ointment. — For two days apply poultices of equal parts 
of flax seed meal, bran and finely powdered charcoal. Then, twice a day for 
ten days apply oxide of zinc ointment. The parts should be thoroughly 
washed and dried before each application. Give loosening food and for a 
week give 3 drams of nitrate of potash in the feed morning and evening. 

2. Turpentine, Linseed Oil and Oil of Vitriol. — Put a quart of linseed 
oil and four ounces of turpentine into an earthen vessel and very slowly add 
one ounce of oil of vitriol. Be sure to add the vitriol slowly and at the same 
time stir the mixture and so continue until cool. Use this as a liniment for 
chronic scratches, grease heel and old sores. 

3. Ointment for Grease Heel. — ^To half a pound each of honey, lard and 
tar melted together add one ounce of pulverized white vitriol, one ounce of 
pulverized sugar of lead and one-half pound of pulverized alum and stir until 
cold. Put on a cloth and bind on for 36 hours. Repeat this application when- 
ever needed. At the same time give condition powders for the blood. 

ECZEMA, ACUTE AND CHRONIC— (See " Cattle Department.") 

MANGE— SCAB — ITCH. — All these ailments are due to parasites that 
harbor in the skin or to mites which trouble both horses and cattle. Some 
of these parasites and insects bury deep in the cracks of the skin while others 
work on the surface and it is well to keep in mind that one animal gets 
them from another. 

SYMPTOMS.-^There is almost a constant itching of some parts of the 
surface of the body and' when the hand or curry comb or brush is placed on 
the body the horse leans towards you as though he liked to be groomed. 
Scabs very often form and sores appear which are the result of the animal's 
rubbing himself. To be sure that an animal has mites use a magnifying glass 
in looking at the scales that come off the body. 

TREATMENT. — Wash the body with soap suds, adding a tablespoon- 
ful of borax to every quart or the same quantity of kerosene ; or, apply coal- 
tar disinfectant and water, a five per cent, solution or even stronger; or, a 
decoction of tobacco, one ounce to a quart. Occasionally dust .on some pow- 
dered sulphur. If you are sure he has scab use the treatment prescribed for 
scab in sheep. Good grooming and generous feeding are helpful after the 
parasites or mites are killed.

3 ounces of oil of tar and 2 ounces of lac-sulphur; mix thoroughly. Wash 
the skin thoroughly and apply the above with a hair brush. In two or three 
days repeat the washing and application. 

ERYSIPELAS.— (See" Cattle Department.") 

ITCTiING TAIL.— This is an itchy condition of the skin at the root or 
scalp of the tail and is generally the result of filth or some parasitic disease 
or of an over-fed horse becoming feverish with a heated condition of the skin, 
causing the animal to rub against almost anything he can reach. One of the 
first steps is to give the horse a mild dose of cathartic medicine. Reduce 
his supply of stimulating food, wash the tail 'with soap and water every day 
and wet the scalp with a lotion composed of baking soda, one and a half 
ounces in a quart of water; or, use salt in place of the soda; or, put two 



58 , THE PEOPLE'S HOME STOCK BOOK. 

ounces of kerosene into a quart of soap suds and apply the one which is the 
most convenient, three times a day. If the horse has pin worms, they may 
cause him to rub and if so, wash the bowel out with soap suds, followed by 
an infusion of quassia (two ounces of chips soaked in three pints of hot 
water for two hours). By dissolving four ounces of sugar of lead and one 
ounce of carbolic acid in one-half gallon of water a useful application is 
made for an itching tail. Good grooming and cleanliness -and keeping up the 
treatment I have prescribed will soon effect a cure. 

SURFEIT— NETTLE RASH— URTICARIA,— This is an eruptive con- 
dition of the skin in which there are small or moderate sized hard nodules oj 
lumps. Sometimes they come in the form of a small blister. This lumpy 
condition of the skin takes place as a sort of effort of nature to throw off 
either a surplus of effete material or a poison of some kind. 

CAUSES. — Generally the cause is too high feeding of corn or other fat- 
producing grain. It sometimes appears at shedding time and during the 
changeable weather of spring and autumn. Poorly groomed horses suffer 
from surfeit. 

SYMPTOMS. — The skin appears to swell and thicken and this is fol- 
lowed by the appearance of buds or bunches and the skin remains thick in 
several places. This eruption generally appears quickly and it may disappear 
rapidly, but generally lasts for six or seven days. 

TREATMENT. — Give a cathartic of either aloes or epsom salts and keep 
the bowels moderately active by giving either salts or raw linseed oil. Also 
give a tablespoonful of saltpeter or two tablespoonfuls of baking soda at, a 
dose in feed three times a day. Mixed hay, vegetables and grass are the best 
foods and the quantity given should be limited. If the horse itches, put one 
ounce sulphuric acid in a gallon of water and apply to itchy parts twice a 
day ; or, dissolve an ounce of baking soda in a quart of water and apply this 
lotion two or three times a day. Salt and water is also a good rejnedy. 

TUMORS.— (See " Cattle Department") 
SIT-FASTS— CALLOSITIES.— 

CAUSES. — These bunches are very common under the collar. They are 
located under the skin and are caused by chafing or a bruise bringing on a 
thickened condition of the skin or a fibrous bunch under the skin. Badly 
fitting collars and saddles and improper care of the shoulders or back are 
the most common causes of sit-fasts. 

TREATMENT. — In my practice I never waste time using poultices or 
caustics in the treatment of chronic sores and bunches of this kind but I 
always cut them out and treat the shoulder as any common wound should 
be treated. After the operation apply any good home healing remedy and 
rest the animal if possible, but if you are obliged to work him, hollow out his 
collar or saddle to prevent irritating the wound. Apply peroxide-hydrogen 
twice a day; ten minutes later apply any of the following healing remedies; 
a two per cent, solution of carbolic acid; one part coal-tar disinfectant and 
twenty parts water; or, dissolve one-quarter pound of sugar of lead, three 
ounces sulphate of zinc and three ounces of tannic acid in a gallon of water 
and apply to shoulders or back three times a day. There are many other 
useful remedies you may apply. 

HIDE-BOUND. — This is not a disease though it is often thought to be. 
This is a mistaken idea for it is usually the resuft of some other ailment of 
a debilitating nature such as fevers or indigestion or the feeding of badly 



HORSE— DISEASES OF SKIN. 59 

cured or non-nutritious food ; or, it is the result of over work, causing the 
animal to lose flesh and of course the hide then clings to the bones more 
closely than if they were covered with fat. The skin being tight on the body, 
the animal being thin, the skin dry and dirty and the coat usually rough gives 
the animal the appearance of being hide-bound, hence the name. 

TREATMENT. — Increase the quantity of nutritious food, giving tonics 
and worm remedies; also groom the animal well twice a day and perhaps 
keep him in a warmer and more comfortable stable. He will then soon 
commence to thrive and lose the appearance of being hide-bound. Give two 
tablespoonfuls of ground gentian, one teaspoonful of powdered copperas, two 
tablespoonfuls of ground ginger, one tablespoonful of powdered cinchona 
and one tablespoonful of baking soda at a dose in feed two or three times 
a day. 

FROSTBITES.— (See " Cattle Department.") 
BURNS AND SCALDS.— (See " Cattle Department.") 
LICE. — There are two kinds of lice that usually attack the horse — blood- 
suckers with narrow heads and long trunk-like sucking tubes and bird lice with 
very large broad heads and biting jaws. 

SYMPTOMS. — The state of lousiness is usually seen in poor, half-starved 
young animals or very old ones. Debility seems to be the predisposing cause, 
rendering the animal a proper subject for the propagation and development 
of these parasites. 

TREATMENT. — The best treatment is to clip the hair and then wash 
the animal with a decoction of stavesacre, one ounce of the powdered seeds to 
a pint of warm water; or, a solution of one part tobacco to twenty parts 
water; or, one part coal-tar disinfectant to twenty parts water. Or, apply 
kerosene emulsion which is made by mixing one quart of kerosene and one 
quart of rain water and adding one pound of good soap. When dissolved, 
pour from one bucket to another until thoroughly mixed, then add ten quarts 
more of water and bathe the horse with this mixture every day or two until 
a few applications have been made. The sides of the stall and the harness as 
well as the curry combs and brushes should be treated with an application 
of the same. I have also applied, with good results, one part carbolic acid 
and thirty or forty parts of water. A small quantity of mercurial ointment 
rubbed into the mane and root of tail has a good effect. Good grooming 
and plenty of good food is important for lice seem to select for their victims 
the weak, thin animals. 
PEOPLE'S HOME REMEDIES FOR LICE.— 

1. Benzine. — Sponge the parts with benzine and repeat in a week to 
kill any that may have hatched from the nits in the interval. 

2. Sulphur Ointment. — Sulphur ointment will kill lice on horses. 

3. Tar Water. — Sponge the horse with tar water and repeat in about 
a week to kill any that have hatched later from the nits. 

4. Insect Powder. — Dust the horse well with insect powder and then 
blanket him for an hour or two. Examine again in a week and if any more 
have hatched the treatment should be repeated. 

5. Coal Oil, Soap Suds and Vinegar. — ^Wash the horse with one part 
coal oil and five parts soap suds twice a week. To kill lice nits apply one 
part cider vinegar and two parts water. 

WARTS. — Warts are abnormal growths of the skin and occur on any 



69 THE PEOPLE.'S HOME STOCK BOOK. 

part of the body; however, they are most frequently found about the head, 
neck, belly and sheath. 

CAUSES. — Medical authorities are somewhat divided in opinion as to the 
real cause of warts ; however, a slight injury or irritation of the skin may start 
a warty growth. Highly fed animals appear to suffer most from warts, the 
skin becoming affected from blood trouble or stomach disorders. We some- 
times m'eet with certain kinds of warts that seem to be contagious, 

TREATMENT. — If overfeeding has produced them it is well to cut 
down the animal's allowance or change from stimulating food to a more cool- 
ing and laxative diet. I have known a run to grass to seemingly cause them 
to go away. Every wart that has a well defined neck should be cut off with 
either a knife or an ecraseur; or, they should be burned off with a knife- 
shaped iron at white heat. By burning them it stops bleeding and often 
kills the roots. They can also be removed by ligaturing; however, I do not 
like this method. Now, there are many different remedies that will take 
them off, such as castor oil, acetic acid, chromic acid, arsenic ointment, nitrate 
of silver and salicylic acid. It is well to keep in mind that they are usually 
not deep footed, principally confined to the skin, and are easily cut out but 
sometimes are inclined to bleed. Applying tincture of chloride of iron or 
burning with' a hot iron will quickly stop the bleeding; or, tie the blood 
vessel with a silk thread. 
PEOPLE'S HOME REMEDIES FOR REMOVING WARTS.— 

1. Dry or Seed Warts. — Take equal parts of calomel, copperas and 
alum. The first two should be pulverized together and the alum should be 
burned and then mixed with the other ingredients. The wart .should be 
scraped with a knife until raw and the mixture applied as often as the scab 
comes 9fi until the wart is entirely removed. 

2. Bluestone. — Clip or cut off the wart and cauterize the raw surface 
with pawdered bluestone. 

3. Acetic Acid. — Apply strong acetic acid to the warts until they are 
removed. Do not let this run upon the surrounding skin. 

4 Washing Soda. — Dissolve an ounce of washing soda in two ounces 
of water and wet the warts with this solution. 

5. Castor Oil. — Apply castor oil to the warts twice a day, or apply 
salicylic acid. 

6. Sulphur. — Give a teaspoonful of sulphur at a dose in feed once a day. 
This will generally take off warts, 



DISEASES AND INJURIES OF THE 
EYE AND EAR. 

(Including Sore Eyes, Worm in the Eye, Cataract, Moon Blindness, Etc.) 



SIMPLE OPHTHALMIA— SORE EYES— INFLAMMATION OF 
THE EYES. — Simple ophthalmia is really an inflammation of the eye, or of 
the eyeball and is sometimes confined to the conjunctiva (mucous membrane 
of the eye). 

CAUSES. — It is very often the result of an injury, a speck of sand get- 
ting into the eye and setting up inflammation, stable gases and sudden changes 
of weather. However, it generally results from injury or from a foreign body 
getting into the 'eye and remaining there. 

SYMPTOMS. — The symptoms are — flowing tears, swollen lids, red and 
retracted eyes, dilated pupils and blinking when facing a bright light. I might 
say that in this ailment the eye is much more inflamed than in periodic 
ophthalmia. 

TREATMENT. — First of all a very careful examination should be made 
and if possible the cause should be removed. We find the disease existing in 
three forms, depending on how long the eye has been sore. First, we have 
an acute inflammation and if this is not subdued a sub-acute inflammation 
follows and if this lasts long it becomes chronic. Now the first step in the 
line of treatment should be to reduce the inflammation and this is generally 
best done by applying either hot or cold water and these applications should 
be kept up constantly for at least one or two hours at a time and it is well 
to keep in mind that hot water in winter and cold in summer is the way to 
use water on inflamed parts. Drop three grains of sulphate of zinc and one 
grain of sulphate of atropia into one ounce of rain water and a^ply three 
times a day. Also, feed no grain but give bran mashes, vegetables or grass. 
A dark stable is the best and any eye wash that is good- for man is equally 
good for animals for their eyes ar§ alike. I very often give one-dram doses 
of iodide of potassium internally with good results and this always helps 
to clear the eyeball. I also blow some calomel into the eye daily and give 
a few grains in the feed with good results, if the case seems to stand still 
and not show any signs of mending. Always remember that dust and bright 
fight irritate the eyes. 
PEOPLE'S HOME REMEDIES FOR INFLAMMATION OF THE 

EYES.— 

1. Witch Hazel. — Bathe the eyes freely with extract of witch hazel. 

2. Lotion for Eyes. — To 4 ounces of water add 1 ounce of glycerine, 
and one-half dram of sulphate of zinc. Put 4 or 5 drops into the inflamed 
eyes morning and evening. 

3. Sugar of Lead and Belladonna. — To a pint of boiled rain water add 
30 grains of sugar of lead and a teaspoonful of fluid extract of belladonna. 
Keep a soft cloth wet with this and hang over the eyes. This is for in- 
flamed eyelids. 

4. Borax. — Use 60 grains of borax to a quart of boiled water, keep a 
cloth wet with this and hang over the eyes. It is also important that you 
keep the bowels in a laxative condition.

INFLAMED EYES— CONTAGIOUS OPHTHALMIA.— (See " Cattle 
Department.") 

CATARACT, — A cataract is either a partial or complete opacity of the 
crystalline lens or its capsule and may be either the result of injury or a 
sequel to other diseases, such as periodic ophthalmia. Cataracts vary in 
shape, size and situation. Only the capsule may be involved, or both capsule 
and lens, and sometimes only the lens. It is seen at birth in some animals 
and is called congenital cataract. When the whole lens is affected the eye- 
ball shows some atrophy or wasting and the opening of the pupil becomes 
large and loses its elliptical form. In order to detect a small cataract place 
the animal in a dark place and use artificial light such as a candle. Or, if 
you know how to use an ophthalmoscope you will very readily detect a cataract 
if there be any. The test is always made most easily after belladonna or 
atropia has been applied to the eye. However, it is not generally necessary 
to test this way. By facing the horse out of a barn door and placing your 
hat over his eye, letting it remain there for a few minutes and then removing 
it quickly, the different effects light will have on the well and diseased eye 
will be marked, especially on the pupillary openings.. Cataract usually de- 
velops slowly but I have known it to develop in twenty days and I might say 
there is no remedy on account of surgical work being inadvisable in all cases 
of cataracts in animals. Of course an operation is advisable in man because 
he can wear glasses. 

CONJUNCTIVITIS— CATARRH OF THE EYE.— (See " Cattle De- 
partment.") 

• IRITIS— RETINITIS. — This is an inflammation of the eye, especially 
that pprtion which surrounds the pupil and gives color to the eye. It is 
usually ferought on by blows or extreme changes of light and darkness. It is 
also the result of facing fierce storms and cold wind- and is no doubt some- 
times the result of constitutional disturbances, especially those of the diges- 
tive organs. 

SYMPTOMS. — The symptoms are like those of superficial ophthalmia 
but there is more constitutional disturbance with loss of appetite, increased 
heat of body and considerable retraction of the eye into its socket. The haw is 
drawn up, the mucous membrane is inflamed, the aqueous humor becomes 
muddy with white floating flakes in the anterior chamber and frequently a 
little pus settles in the lower part. As the disease advances a white speck 
or cloud appears in the lens behind the pupil and iris. 

TREATMENT.— Place the animal in a dark stable with pure, dry air. 
Give a full dose of cathartic medicine and some saltpeter in his drinking 
water, also place some wet cloths over his eyes. Apply a saturated solution 
of boric acid to the eyes five times a day. This is made by dissolving all 
the boric acid the water will take up ; therefore, there is no danger of making 
this solution too strong. If the eyes are painful add some belladonna. Feed 
the horse a cooling, laxative diet and give one-half dram iodide of potassium 
and two drams Fowler's solution at a dose two or three times a day. If the 
eye fails to clear, blow a little calomel into it once or twice a day and give 
twenty-five grains of calomel at a dose twice a week for three weeks. 

INFLAMMATION OF THE HAW (Membrana Nictitans).— (See " Cat- 
tle Department.") 

WORM IN THE EYE. — Worm in the eye is not a common ailment in 
this country ; however, I have met with more than a dozen cases. It is, how- 
ever, a common affection in some hot countries such as India. 



HORSE— DISEASES OF EYE AND EAR. 63 

CAUSES. — Through the horse drinking stagnant water is the manner 
in which the ova or egg makes its way into the circulation and through the 
blood vessels into the eye. 

SYMPTOMS. — The eye is dull. On examination a thread-like body is 
seen moving about in the eye and if allowed to grow it will produce loss 
of sight. 

TREATMENT. — A surgical operation is always successful. Puncture 
through the cornea and allow the aqueous humor and worm to escape. 

PERIODIC OPHTHALMIA— MOON BLINDNESS.— Periodic oph- 
thalmia is a constitutional affection of the eye and is known by many differ- 
ent names such as " moon-blindness," " moon-eyes " and " constitutional oph- 
thalmia," and it has also been called " odontalgia " and we sometimes hear it 
called " hereditary ophthalmia " and " specific ophthalmia." Fortunately, 
this ailment is not nearly so common as it was twenty years ago. 

CAUSES. — Perhaps it might be as well for me to say that the veterinary 
profession is pretty well agreed that the cause is not known ; however, certain 
exciting causes may have a tendency to bring it on, but it seems to lurk in 
t}ie body ready to break out when favorable conditions exist. Many writers 
believe the cause to be a germ of some kind. Dark, badly ventilated stables, 
poor food, extreme heat or cold, all have a tendency to bring it on. Over 
exertion and over heating have been known to cause it. There are many 
exciting causes of periodic ophthalmia. 

SYMPTOMS. — The attack is generally sudden, the eye is sensitive to 
bright light and always retracted, the eyelid is dropped, the cornea dim and 
the eye dull, and as soon as one eye becomes affected the other generally 
gets sore. One attack seems to follow another. After each attack the eye- 
ball atrophies more or less and generally this disease sooner or later term- 
inates in loss of sight. 

TREATMENT. — The very best that can be done in the line of treatment 
for this ailment is to relieve the disease and this is perhaps best done by 
keeping the bowels open and rather active by giving salts, oil or aloes to 
purge the animal if you believe it necessary. Place the horse in a dark stall 
and give a tablespoonful of nitrate of potash at a dose in the feed or water 
twice a day until the eyes become less inflamed. Put three grains of sulphate 
of atropia in one ounce of rain water and apply twice a day ; or, apply 3 grains 
acetate of lead, twenty drops tincture of opium and one ounce of water twice 
daily.

DISEASES OF THE NERVOUS SYSTEM. 

(Including Lockjaw, Hydrophobia, Blind Staggers, Stringhalt, Sunstroke, 

Paralysis, Etc.) 



TETANUS — LOCKJAW. — Tetanus is not a common disease in cold 
climates; however, it is quite prevalent in hot countries where the soil is 
fertile and wounds are not treated properly. 

CAUSES. — The tetanus bacillus makes its way into the body through a' 
skin or flesh abrasion or wound. The most common abodes for this germ 
are in road dust, garden earth, barnyards, stable floors or in any fertile soil. 
Therefore, one can readily understand why a wound siti'aied in the foot, 
leg or lower part of the body is very convenient for the bacillus to gain en- 
trance into the body and cause lockjaw. 

SYMPTOMS. — In mild cases it is not always easy to make a correct 
diagnosis. However, in severe cases it is easy, for the clinical symptoms 
differ from all others. It is safe to say that nearly all the muscles of the 
body are implicated, some of them much more so than others. The muscles 
of the legs are always stiff, the muscles of the head and neck are the first to 
be noticed, and the nose is always poked out. The head and tail are usually 
elevated, the animal is easily excited and trembles some and the membrana 
nictitans (haw) flashes over the eye whenever the animal is excited. The 
animal stands with the forelegs extended forward and the hind ones back of 
the body and generally straddles as though afraid of falling. All animals 
suffering from lockjaw present an anxious expression, move stiffly, have a 
quick pulse when excited and the jaws are generally either partially or 
totally closed. The animal almost always takes the standing position and 
retains it, his appetite is good, bowels costive, urine scanty and highly 
colored. Whenever the animal lies down before the muscles are relaxed nearly 
all the symptoms become aggravated and it is not unusual for them to grow 
more nervous and struggle until they die, but in mild cases they often retain 
the standing position for several weeks until they have made a recovery. 

TREATMENT. — It is safe to say that nearly every drug and anti-toxic 
serum known to veterinarians and physicians have been tried and failed as a 
remedy for severe cases of tetanus. However, the disease can generally be 
prevented by immunizing the patient with anti-toxic serum (tetanin) which 
will immunize the animal. Furthermore, wounds in the lower part of 
the body should be covered with absorbent cotton or oakum or a dressing 
that will make it impossible for the admission or entrance of the tetanus 
bacillus to the circulation or body of the wounded animal. Nearly 
all veterinarians are equipped to immunize animals which have nail punc- 
tures and wounds in the lower part of the body; besides, the treatment 
is not expensive and it is certainly cheap insurance. Of course this treat- 
ment is not curative after the disease has once become established. A horse 
suffering with tetanus should be kept in a dark stable which is free from 
noise. He should be fed gruel and liberally supplied with water. The water 
and feed should be put into a tub and set about three and one-half feet high 
for the horse is unable to lower the head much. Give the horse one dram of 

64 



HORSE— DISEASES OF NERVOUS SYSTEM. 6& 

solid extract of belladonna at a dose three or four times a day, either by- 
mouth or by injection into the bowel. In the early stages it is good practice 
to. give a cathartic. If the wound can be discovered apply antiseptics such 
as hydrogen-peroxide, carbolic acid, iodoform, boric acid, bichloride of mer- 
cury, etc. There are many drugs that appear to have a soothing effect, such 
as bromide of potassium and chloral hydrate. When the spasms are intense 
they can be relieved by inhalations of chloroform. However, this relief is 
usually only temporary. As a rule the same man should look after the horse 
during his entire sickness as strangers usually excite him. It is important to 
feed nutritious food and green fodder is the best. Whenever a recovery takes, 
place it is always slow and it is unwise to put a horse to work too soon 
after he has had tetaifus. 
PEOPLE'S HOME, REMEDIES FOR LOCKJAW.— 

1. Preventive. — Wet wounds lightly with turpentine and they will not 
.be the cause of lockjaw. 

2. Nux Vomica and Belladonna. — Give one-half teaspoonful of tincture 
of nux vomica and a teaspoonful of fluid extract of belladonna at a dose three 
times a day. This is said to cure lockjaw. 

RABIES— HYDROPHOBIA.— Rabies is not a very common disease in 
the horse. It is usually the result of a bite of a mad dog and the disease 
never has a spontaneous origin, but it is often very difficult to trace the 
source of infection. All, or nearly all, of the lower animals, if bitten, are 
liable to this disease. It is called hydrophobia by many people on account of 
the animal's inability to drink water. The virus oi poison no doubt exists, 
in every part of the body, especially in the saliva, spinal cord and brain but 
after death it soon ceases to be dangerous. It is perhaps true that the first 
bites from a rabid dog are possibly the most dangerous and it is also true 
that man is not so easily infected as are other animals. I knew a woman to 
die of hydrophobia from allowing a mad dog to lick her hand, all going to 
show that the saliva is loaded with the virus. I also knew a man who caught 
the disease while skinning a dog. 

SYMPTOMS. — There is a change in the disposition, dullness and an in- 
clination to hide away in a dark quiet place. The patient startles easily, is 
a little flighty and grows dull but remains quiet only a short time. Those 
affected are inclined to eat pieces of wood and bits of coal and dirt. Later 
they become irritable, often inclined to snap and bite but they generally will 
not go far out of their path to bite a person, but will chase dogs wherever 
they see them. The head and tail are always • carried low. The disease 
assumes one of two forms; the furious or the dumb and paralytic. In the 
latter form the lower jaw of the dog drops, remaining so unless spasms come 
on or allowed to worry another dog. The furious form is more dangerous 
for the dog will often bite you without a moment's warning. A mad dog, if 
allowed to run loose, will often travel ten or fifteen miles, return to his old 
kennel, lie down and die from exhaustion. The mad dog always loses his 
voice, soon has trouble swallowing food or water and dies of paralysis. 

TREATMENT. — No remedy — but the Pasteur treatment will prevent 
this disease in man.

CONGESTION OF THE BRAIN. — This is a horse disease characterized 
usually by sudden and temporary loss of sensation^ and voluntary motion, 
■i-t 



66 THE PEOPLE'S HOME STOCK BOOK. 

generally with considerable trembling without the general spasms of epi- 
lepsy. 

CAUSES. — This is very often the result of an undue accumulation of 
blood in the brain, producing congestion, and it may be due to heart trouble, 
extreme heat, excitement, the giving of large doses of stimulants, over-exer- 
tion, badly fitting collars which obstruct the return of blood from the head to 
the body or it may be caused by tumors in the brain or a tumor or abscess 
interfering with the circulation back from the brain. It is also brought on 
by digestive disturbance and is quite common in overly fleshy horses. 

SYMPTOMS. — The animal usually slows his gait, throws up his head, 
shivers, staggers, and he may fall and sometimes he will plunge and run 
away.. The eyes are staring, respiration usually quickened and he may stand 
with legs braced and in a few minutes be apparently all right and go on his 
journey as though nothing had happened. In other cases he'may show the 
effects of this attack for a week but if the ailment is due to organic heart 
trouble or disease of the blood vessels of the brain he may show a dumpish 
condition without any fitty condition and die without showing any alarming 
symptoms. 

TREATMENT. — Remove the cause if possible, apply cold water to 
head, reduce his food supply, give a cathartic of either aloes or oil and if he 
is fleshy, reduce his we ht. If it comes or because of want of exercise do 
not allow him to remain die. It is always good judgment to stop the animal 
when the attack is comi s^ on. In acute cases they very often recover but in 
chronic cases they seldoii get over it and remain well without showins; dizzi- 
ness, fits or staggers. Blood letting gives relief. Giving chloral hydrate or 
bromide of potash and a laxative diet help every case. 

SUNSTROKE— HEAT EXHAUSTION.— Horses that fall from heat 
exhaustion or that sufifer from what is commonly called " sunstroke " are 
usually out of condition otherwise or they probably would not have been 
affected much by the heat. Horses suffering from indigestion or those who 
have a heavy coat of hair or who have sluggish kidneys and very little action 
in the glands of the skin, and those that are fleshy are usually the victims. 
Horses that are fed light and exercised regularly and whose bowels and kid- 
neys are acting freely and which perspire moderately are usually exempt from 
these attacks. 

SYMPTOMS. — In sunstroke the horse usually falls and appears ex- 
hausted. In heat exhaustion perspiration checks, the horse pants and staggers, 
the skin is dry and the mucous membranes of eyes and nostrils are red and his 
temperature goes up. 

TREATMENT. — Place the animal in a cool, comfortable, shaded place 
and apply cold water freely to both the head and body. Give one-half pint of 
whiskey and one ounce of aromatic spirits of ammonia, and sometimes add 
a tablespoonful or two of sweet spirits of nitre, and then add a pint or 
more of cold water and give as a drench and repeat in an hour or two if 
necessary. In treating an ailment of this kind it is important to place the 
horse in a cool, comfortable stable or under a tree or tent and cool the surface 
of the body, at the same time giving stimulants. 

STRINGHALT. — Stringhalt is a spasmodic jerking and a sort of regular 
movement of one or both hind legs and is perhaps caused by some lesion 
or abnormal condition of a nerve or perhaps of the spinal cord. It is, no 
doubt, caused by some irregular supply of nerve influence to the extensor and 



HORSE— DISEASES OF NERVOUS SYSTEM. 67 

flexor muscles or tendons of the limb. However, it is difficult to explain 
just why this irregular distribution of nerve supply comes about. In some 
cases where we know there is nerve pressure it can be accounted for, but in 
a majority of cases it must "be admitted that the cause is not known and the 
disease not well understood. 

SYMPTOMS. — Whenever the animal is moved forward or suddenly 
backed it will show an irregular jerking motion of the limb. This is always 
noticeable in bad cases, but in some mild cases the animal may move quite 
a distance before showing it and I have known cases where the animal had to 
be turned from side to side or backed up quickly before they showed it. Of 
course an animal is more likely to show it when trotted. Stringhalt may 
follow exposure to severe cold weather and sometimes follows blistering or 
firing for ring-bone. It is well to keep in mind that heat palliates or relieves 
every case of stringhalt. Some horses show it in the winter but not in the 
summer. 

TREATMENT. — In the majority of cases the disease should be con- 
sidered incurable. Removing a section of the tendon under the hock (pero- 
neal tanotomy), however, or removing a section of the nerve high up, have 
given me fairly good results and these two operations are well worth the 
trial. In an extremely bad case where the animal jerks the feet up to 
the belly, does not improve with exercise and does not show it less in warm 
weather, it is hardly worth while to operate. Peroneal tanotomy is a very 
simple operation and can be performed without throwing the horse. 

PARALYSIS. — Paralysis is loss of voluntary motion with or without 
sensation and is either partial or complete, usually affecting one part, the 
whole side or hind quarters. It may be local and affect only a muscle or two 
as we sometimes find in the -lip. Paralysis sometimes follows gastric irrita- 
tion bringing on fits and loss of power of the hind quarters. Or, if the trouble 
be in cord near the head, the paralysis may affect the whole body. We have 
paralysis resulting from brain disease; also, tumors in the brain sometimes 
cause loss of power, followed by death. Paralysis sometimes results from 
sunstroke or concussion from blows or from falling and jumping with weight 
on the back ; or, it sometimes occurs when throwing a horse down. In these 
latter cases the vertebrae or bones of the back have either been fractured or 
displaced, causing spinal cord pressure and loss of power. A paralysis may 
also come from violent muscular contraction while resisting when he is 
secured ior some surgical operation. Tuberculosis affecting the spinal cord, 
tumors in that region pressing on the cord and a softening of the cord, all 
lead to paralysis. Following oste-porosis (big-head) where the bones en- 
large and honey comb or the bones of the back anchylose, the back is easily 
broken and of course when this occurs paralysis always follows. We have 
still another form of partial loss of power where the animal goes with a sort 
of staggering gait and weaves from side to side. This kind may be the result 
of slight accident or some error in habits or food supply. There is also a 
paralysis of the lips caused from some injury to the brain or some interfer- 
ence in the nerve supply to the lip. Horses also have a paralysis of the tail 
which is generally the result of an injury followed by wasting of the muscles 
of the tail. These are unsatisfactory cases to treat. 

TREATMENT. — Treatment of paralysis is by no means always satis- 
factory. However, there are certain rules which must be followed in order to 
assist nature in bringing about a recovery. If there be any displacement of a 



68 THE PEOPLE'S HOME STOCK BOOK. 

bone, put it back in place as quickly as possible and try to keep it there. The 
bowels and kidneys should be kept active and the general health of the animal 
looked after. The food supply should be nutritious and easily digested. The 
weak parts should be stimulated with some good home liniment such as 
equal parts turpentine, aqua ammonia and sweet oil. Apply this to the 
affected parts daily ; also, give nux vomica or strychnia, which latter has the 
same effect but is more active. In some cases the different preparations of 
iodine have a good effect and produce good results. Many horses should be 
placed in slings and kept there until they recover from paralysis. This should 
be done on account of their weakness and inability to get up and down. They 
wear out their strength struggling to get up. Besides, the bowels and 
kidneys act better when the animal is kept in an upright position. The 
horse thrives better in this position and of course must recover more 
rapidly if thriving than if failing in health. It is also very important in the 
treatment of paralysis to feed a good quality of food. Feed some vegetables 
but no musty or badly cured fodder. It may be necessary for you to blister 
and if so apply cerate of cantharides, or biniodide of mercury, one part to 
six or eight parts of lard, once every week or ten days. 

APOPLEXY. — Apoplexy is generally the result of stagnation of the cir- 
culation of blood in the brain, and there may also be a rupture of some small 
blood vessel or blood vessels, allowing the blood to clot and produce undue 
pressure on the brain. 

CAUSES. — It is very often the result of some error in feeding, seldom 
attacking thin horses. It is not a common ailment of the horse. The dog 
and pig are often affected. It is, perhaps, brought on by overfeeding whicb 
produces too much blood and weakens the walls of the blood vessels. Fat 
animals seem to be the ones most likely to become affected. 

SYMPTOMS. — Apoplexy comes on suddenly and as a rule the animal is. 
unconscious. The pupil of the eye is dilated and breathing is labored. In 
some cases only part of the body seems to be affected. Post-mortem gener- 
ally reveals some congestion of the brain, a ruptured blood vessel or extrav- 
acation of blood that has oozed through the wall of a vein or artery. 

TREATMENT.— If a fleshy horse is affected he should be bled, taking 
away eight or ten quarts. Apply cold packs to the head, give bromide of 
potash in half-ounce doses every three or four hours or hypo-sulphite of 
soda, 1-ounce doses three times a day in food or water. Also reduce his 
food supply and get his bowels to acting freely by giving the common cathar- 
tic for the animal affected. 

MYELITIS. — Myelitis is really an inflammation of the spinal cord and 
when the coverings of the spinal cord are inflamed the disease should be called 
spinal meningitis. 

CAUSES. — It is quite often the result of injuries or feeding a poor quality 
of food. It is also the result bl severe exertion or undue nervous excitement. 
Besides, it sometimes occurs in a locality, affecting several animals, without 
the cause being known and in some cases it follows an attack of azoturia. 
Whenever there is much softening of the spinal cord it usually terminates- 
in complete paralysis and death. 

SYMPTOMS. — There is great nervousness. Sometimes the animal per- 
spires and occasionally falls and is unable to get up without assistance; but,, 
when down, usually struggles. This is a disease that occurs more often dur- 
ing cold weather than during the summer months. 



HORSE— DISEASES OF NERVOUS SYSTEM. 69 

TREATMENT. — If it is caused by an injury and there be a complete 
Vjss of motion we have a right to suspect that the back is fractured. In such 
cases the animal should be destroyed. Give small doses of iodide of potas- 
sium and apply hot water packs to the back. Or, rub on some liniment. 
Fairly good results will often follow giving tincture of mix vomica in one- 
dram doses three or four times a day, but if there is complete paralysis you 
should destroy the animal. ' 

EPILEPSY — FITS. — This is not a common ailment of horses but is 
quite common in the dog, and is spoken of as fits or convulsions. 

CAUSES. — It is very often the result of intestinal or liver derangement, 
such as a torpid liver or stomach or bowel worms and it sometimes comes on 
when the animal is teething. 

SYMPTOMS. — The animal generally falls, froths at the mouth and has 
a sort of convulsive fit, but usually gets over it in two or three minutes. 

TREATMENT. — A liberal supply of fresh air always revives an animal 
suffering from epilepsy unless the brain hemorrhage is extensive. Also, give 
bromide of potash, cathartics and vermifuges and apply cold packs to the 
head. 

CHOREA. — Chorea is a disease of the nervous system producing a sort 
of involuntary and convulsive jerking of the muscles and in horses it usually 
affects the flexor and extensor muscles of the hind legs. However, other 
parts of the body are sometimes affected. I have known horses to be af- 
fected in the foreleg and sometimes quite a portion of the body is affected. 
This ailment is not by any means too well understood and no sure remedy 
has ever yet been discovered. It very often comes on as a result of other 
diseases. 

TREATMENT.— The general health of the animal should be looked 
after, the body kept warm and both the bowels and kidneys kept moderately 
active. If taken with it lightly in the spring of the year, quite a number of 
animals recover when turned out where they are exposed to the bright sun- 
lijght. I have obtained the best results by giving small doses of Fowler's 
solution of arsenic and iodide of potassium. Give from one to three drams 
of Fowler's solution and one-half dram of iodide of potassium at a dose in 
€ither feed or water twice daily. It is very important that the animal should 
be given good care and exercised moderately every day. 

CEREBRO-SPINAL MENINGITIS.— Cerebro-spinal meningitis is a 
fever affecting the brain and spinal cord and their coverings. The ailment 
seems to be most prevalent on this continent and we seldom find one case 
alone. The nervous system appears to be most affected. This disease is no 
doubt on the increase. It sometimes arises sporadically but most commonly 
occurs as an epidemic in a stable or community. 

CAUSES. — The causes of this ailment are none too well understood. 
Many veterinarians believe it to be due to atmospheric influences. Bad venti- 
lation, damp stables, feeding musty fodder and bacteria may cause it. My 
own observations are that it is generally brought cwi by watering animals out 
of wells that catch the barn yard sap and where the water is well filled with 
decayed animal or vegetable matter. This is also the conclusion of a few 
other veterinarians. I might add it is also caused by the feeding of decayed 
vegetables. 

SYMPTOMS. — There is generally more or less loss of power which may 
develop quite suddenly or gradually. The temperature always increases, thea 



70 THE PEOPLE'S HOME STOCK BOOK. 

some time later falls below normal and during the later period may rise again. 
There is generally some twitching of the muscles, sometimes about the neck, 
at other times the hind quarters. In severe cases it is not unusual to find 
the animal staggering and sometimes it tumbles down, lying on the side and 
moving the limbs rapidly as though trotting. In other cases they are more 
paralytic. In most cases the bowels are constipated and small quantities of 
urine are secreted and it is generally of a reddish color. The eye is also 
quite reddened. In other cases the brain appears to be very much affected, 
the animal being drowsy, dull and stupid. Later the animal becomes delir- 
ious, has convulsions and soon dies. In most cases the animal seems unable 
to swallow food, especially when the disease seems to be appearing without 
any well known cause and in different parts of the country. Whenever the 
animal seems to lose his ppwer of swallowing food it means almost sure 
death. As a rule death results in from two to four or five days, and on ex- 
amination after death we usually find considerable effusion about the brain 
and spinal cord with considerable congestion of the brain and cord. Also, the 
bowels will be found almost empty; however, I have often made examin- 
ation after death and found very few, if any, post mortem lesions. But the 
symptoms of this disease differ from all others. Therefore, you can gener- 
ally make a correct diagnosis. 

TREATMENT. — Where the loss of power is almost complete you should 
look for a fatal termination, but if it is only partial, give one-half ounce of 
Dromide of potassium or the same quantity of belladonna every three hours 
or one ounce three times a day; or, 2 drams fluid extract every 4 hours. Apply 
stimulating home liniments to the spine and legs. When giving medicine it 
is very often necessary to pour it through a tube for the animal is unable to 
.swallow. It will also be necessary to give nourishment, such as eggs, milk, 
alcoholic stimulants and gruel in the same way and it must not be forgotten 
that a complete change of food and water should be made right away. All 
things considered, this is a very unsatisfactory ailment to treat for the disease 
generally proves fatal. 



LAMENESS. 

(Including Sweeny, Sprains and Strains, Fractures, Spavins, Curbs, Splints^ 
Thorough-Pin, Etc., and Full Directions for Locating Lameness.) 



HOW TO LOCATE LAMENESS.— Nothing seems to puzzle the horse 
owner and farmer more than locating lameness. This, perhaps, is for want 
of sufficient knowledge of the symptoms of lameness; also for lack of famil- 
iarity with the normal gait and peculiarity of action. Now, in order that 
every reader of this book may school himself in the art of locating lameness, 
I shall try to make the symptoms clear and as easily understood as possible. 
Lameness is a manifestation of pain by one or more limbs, indicating weak- 
ness or inability, soreness or stiffness, causing partial or total inability to use 
the limb or limbs. In order to detect lameness when it is slight you must 
be familiar, not only with the natural gaits but all the peculiarities of gait. 
The signs of lameness during repose (rest) are very important and fre- 
quently assist materially in locating the seat of trouble. If resting on all 
four limbs, the pastern of the lame one will generally be more upright than 
the others ; if one foreleg be far in advance of the otHer it indicates tender- 
ness or soreness in the back part of the leg and low down. Resting the toe 
on the ground and bending the knee and fetlock, without the foot's being in 
advance of the other, indicates shoulder or elbow lameness. When both fore- 
feet are kept in advance of the body, the animal resting on the heels, with the 
hind legs kept well under the body, the soreness is usually in the forefeet. 
When a horse rests one foot more and for a longer time than any of 
the others it should create suspicion. When he is inclined to lie down and 
remain so, it indicates weakness, perhaps fracture or considerable pain. In 
most cases of hind quarter lameness, if it is situated low down, the foot is 
kept in advance, but if in the stifle, he drags the toe and if the hip is the 
seat of trouble he will also drag the leg and trot out of alignment. A horse 
that walks lame always trots very lame. Lameness may be shown in the 
walk but it is best seen in the slow easy trot and, if led, the head should not 
be pulled to one side, and the less excitement the better. In all cases of lame- 
ness where only one leg is involved the leg is lifted quickly and less weight is 
put upon that foot; therefore, i halting of the limb occurs and by listening 
a different noise is made whr . the foot strikes the ground. When one fore 
limb is affected the head and fore quarter are raised when that foot comes to 
the ground, but he is seen to drop on the well side. Do not be misled and 
suppose that he is lame behind, for, to the casual observer, it would seem 
so on account^ of a depression in the opposite hind hip. In lameness in one 
hind leg the hip is raised higher than the opposite one and dropped carefully j 
in other cases a depression is found in the hip. With lameness in both fore- 
feet he steps short and puts the foot down carefully; he changes position 
often, not standing on one foot very long at a time ; the shoulders are carried 
stiff and upright ; the head is carried high ; the loins are arched and the hind 
feet are brought well under the body. Lameness in both hind quarters is 
generally marked by the backward position of the forefeet, being well under 
the horse in order to take some weight off the hind quarters; besides, he 

71 



12 THE PEOPLE'S HOME STOCK BOOK. 

backs with difficulty. When the horse is lame in both legs on same side he 
usually ambles and never trots square, but drops heavy on the well side. 
Remember, if a horse which is lame in the right fore limb be trotted from 
you he seems to be lame in the left hind leg for the quarter ascends and 
descends. A horse trotted in a small circle always appears to be lartle in 
the leg nearest the center of the ring. Many horses travel with a nod in 
front or have a hitch behind, but are perfectly sound. Other horses come out 
of the stable sore and lame but after taking a few steps go sound. Some 
lameness grows more severe the farther he goes. The slow gait is the best 
gait to locate lameness. Be sure to have the horse trotted towards you, 
watch closely for the symptoms I have mentioned and do not decide too 
quickly. Have him trotted immediately after he leaves the stable. Examine 
the foot closely; I have known horses to be lame in two places in the same 
leg at the same time. In locating lameness it is well to use both negative 
and positive signs. If there is heat, pain, or swelling in any part of the limb, 
discoverable by manipulation, the evidence is positive that the cause is in 
such parts. If there is no heat, swelling, or pain, then we must conclude 
the lameness is deep seated and then arrive at a conclusion from negative 
evidence. It is a very common custom to make a hurried examination, jump 
at a conclusion and apply some liniment or blister without being certain where 
the lameness is located. It is far better to apply some soothing remedy such 
as hot or cold water or wait a few days until the symptoms are more marked. 
In my practice in Cleveland and elsewhere, it is unusual to be called upon to see 
a lame horse that has not had something done to him before he was brought 
to me and, four times out of five, remedies have been applied to the wrong . 
parts. This is not always for want of knowledge but is often gross care- 
lessness. Lameness is not of itself a disease but a manifestation of it. It 
is generally an expression of pain and we seldom have much lameness with- 
out pain. We seldom have lameness existing for any great length of time 
without some inflammation ; however, a stone in the foot may cause great 
pain before any increased heat sets in. A great many horses would appear 
to sort of come honestly by their lameness; therefore, in selecting breeding 
stock they should be free from both bone and bog spavin, thorough-pin, capped 
hock, bursal swellings, ringbone, side-bone, curb, navicular disease and flat 
feet and they should also be of good conformation and then you will find 
much less lameness to contend with in your horses and especially in your colts. 

SWEENY— ATROPHY OF MUSCLES— WASTING AWAY OF 
PARTS— SHOULDER SLIP.— What is understood by sweeny is an atrophy 
or wasting away of the muscles of the shoulder following shoulder slip or a 
sprain of the shoulder muscles or other causes. Or, it may result from chronic 
lameness in other parts of the limb causing the animal pain which prevents 
the proper exercising of that quarter; so you can readily understand that 
sweeny of the shoulder may be a result of soreness or weakness in some other 
part of the limb and not in tiie shoulder. When you find a sweenied condition 
of the shoulder or hip with lameness in that quarter, make a careful ex- 
amination of the whole limb before arriving at a positive conclusion that the 
injury is in the sweenied or wasted part. 

TREATMENT. — If the lameness is in the lower part of the limb treat 
the diseased part to relieve the animal of pain, unless it is a mechanical 
stiffness that is causing the trouble, but of course stimulate the wasted 
muscles with any eood home liniment, such as is mzide by mixing equal parts 



HORSE— LAMENESS. W 

of tincture of cantharides, turpentine, aqua ammonia and sweet oil and apply 
it to the wasted muscles daily or as often as thought necessary. Or, blister 
lightly with cerate of cantharides. During the winter and cooler months of 
the year I have obtained good results from setons, but this is a rather an- 
cient treatment and attended with some risk. There are many kinds of 
liniments and blisters that act well in these cases. Muscle-making food 
such as oats and a good quality of mixed hay should be fed in preference 
to starchy, fattening food. If the animal is not lame, walking or slow exer- 
cise will assist in reproducing and growing the muscular fibres. 
PEOPLE'S HOME REMEDIES FOR SWEENY.— 

1. Sweeny Cure. — Put one ounce each of camphor gum, spirits of tur- 
pentine, tincture of cantharides and oil of hemlock; two ounces of oil of 
spike and four ounces of oil of origanum into a pint of olive oil. The skin 
should first be well pulled and lifted over the parts and then the liniment 
should be applied every two or three days for two or three weeks. If the 
blistering is too severe a few applications may be missed and the parts 
rubbed with lard or sweet oil. 

2. Sweeny. — Apply equal parts of tincture of cantharides, sweet oil, 
hartshorn and origanum. This is an effective remedy for sweeny and shrink- 
ing of the muscles. 

3. Sweeny Cure Without Medicine. — Pull the skin up well over the 
shrunken parts, make a small incision with a knife, insert a goose quill and 
blow full of air. The horse should then be allowed to rest or to run on pasture 
for a few days. 

SPRAINS OF TENDONS, LIGAMENTS AND MUSCLES.— What is 
understood by a sprain or strain is a distention or laceration of the fibre of 
a tendon, ligament or muscle and the name following the word " sprain " 
merely indicates its location but they nearly all require the same sort of 
treatment and the same line of care. A sprain is usually the result of an 
accident caused by slipping, falling or over-exertion, such as pulling too heavy 
a load. Horses are sprained by making a misstep or by traveling on slippery 
footing or by hauling loads up a hill when the road is wet and muddy and 
they are not properly shod to give secure footing. Horses very often strain 
themselves when holding back a heavy load while going down hill ; besides, 
I have known many horses to sprain diilferent parts of the body when get- 
ting up awkwardly on a slippery floor. Sprains are a common occurrence 
among race horses, caused by over-exertion. 

TREATMENT. — In every case of sprain when a rapid recovery is de- 
sired the animal should be given absolute rest until the lameness disappears. 
The inflammation should be subdued by cold applications in the summer 
months and hot applications in the winter but in order to do much good water 
should be applied frequently. After a few days treatment with water and 
perhaps bandages, apply the following lotion five or six times a' day. Dissolve 
14 pound of sugar of lead and eight ounces of fluid extract of arnica in one 
gallon of water ; or, apply equal parts extract witch hazel, alcohol and spirits 
of camphor twice a day. Or, apply equal parts turpentine, aqua ammonia 
and sweet oil once a day and later on, perhaps a blister, using cerate of can- 
tharides once a week until recovery takes place. A laxative diet should al- 
ways be substituted in place of a stimulating grain diet.

of cedar, oil of hemlock, camphor gum, sweet oil and turpentine. Shake well 
before applying. This will be found an excellent treatment for nearly all 
kinds of strains and swellings. 

DISEASES OF THE BONE.— Diseases of .the bone are of an inflam- 
matory or non-inflammatory character. When the substance of the bone be- 
comes inflamed we call the disease ostitis and the disease very often subsides, 
usually leaving a bunch but in many cases no lameness. In splint, spavin and 
ringbone we have this condition of the bone. Another form of bone disease 
is " caries " where the bone seems to be destroyed and comes away in par- 
ticles. We find this the case in fistula of the withers and poll evil when the 
case is chronic. Necrosis of a bone means its destruction and these cases do 
not get well. 

TREATMENT. — A healthy action should be brought about as rapidly as 
possible and if the bone is diseased cut down on the diseased part, scrape or 
cut it off, then apply home remedies such as carbolic acid, coal-tar dip, creo- 
sote, iodoform, boric acid or any good healing powder. 

INFLAMMATION OF THE BONE— OSTITIS.— Diseases of the bone 
are usually either inflammatory or non-inflammatory, but it is not always an 
easy matter to tell which. Bones seem to become inflamed much the same 
as the soft tissues. When the substance of the bone is inflamed it is called 
" ostitis " and when the covering of the bone is inflamed it is called " perios- 
titis " which, of course, is an inflammation of the periosteum. Ostitis may sub- 
side without forming any bony enlargement. Every bone is permeated with a 



HORSE— LAMENESS. 75 

i.ort of net work of minute blood vessels carrying nutriment to build, grow 
;ind nourish them ; now, when the bone is injured and an inflammation is 
set up, interfering with the circulation through the bone, changes soon begin 
to take place. At first a fluid is thrown out, which is called lymph and this 
may soon change into pus, settling either on the surface or in the interior. Or, a 
hardening of the lymph takes place closing the blood vessels and limiting 
the supply of blood, then some ulceration of the bone may take place. In- 
flammation of the bone very often results in the formation of a bony bunch 
called exostosis; or, it may result in what is called caries, meaning the grad- 
ual destruction of the bone. This latter we very often find in chronic cases 
(;f poll-evil and fistulous withers. Sometimes in hock' lameness there is very 
'little enlargement but an ulceration of the surface of the bones has been 
going on and this may be followed by a necrosis or complete destruction of 
the bone. Such conditions are serious and are incurable when joints are 
much involved. 

GENERAL SYMPTOMS.— In slight cases there is some soreness but 
seldom much lameness, unless trotted on a very hard road. The bone is 
tender when tapped with a piece of wood and in cases where the inflamma- 
tion is great the lameness is extreme. When suppuration takes place in the 
interior of a bone the pus may remain imprisoned for a long time, but it 
causes great pain. When pus forms between the bone and its covering apd 
is not allowed to escape, it often does great harm and when pus forms deep 
in a bone the bone usually bulges and enlarges somewhat. Ulceration of 
the bone often follows exposure of the bone to air or to pressure of pus 
and when it is going on a strong disagreeable odor is thrown off, differing 
from all other odors. Death of a bone is generally associated with an open 
sore and if the discharge is felt it will be found to contain grit and it will 
also blacken silver. If the wound is probed the bare bone can be felt. 

GENERAL TREATMENT.— In the first treatment of the bone it is 
always a good plan to first try soothing remedies, such as hot or cold water. 
A dose of purgative medicine generally helps. Cooling astringent lotions are 
proper remedies; put one-fourth pound sugar of lead, one-half ounce alum, 
apd three ounces sulphate zinc into a gallon of cold water ; or put one pint of 
alcohol, one-fourth pound saltpeter, two ounces muriate ammonia and one 
quart cider vinegar into a gallon of cold water and apply to sore parts five 
times a day. One part alcohol, five parts witch-hazel and five parts water is 
a good remedy. When the acute inflammation has subsided apply equal parts 
tincture iodine, spirits fcamphor and alcohol to sore parts daily. Later apply 
one part red iodide mercury and eight parts lard or apply cerate of cantha- 
rides. In treating bony tumors it is well to understand that mineral acids 
remove them but always leave a scar; besides, if applied over a joint they 
may do harm by producing open joint. Cutting off bony bunches should be 
done with care. The skin should be opened and the bunch removed with a 
chisel or bone cutter and the wound should be treated with great care. 
Many times the distension of a fibrous membrane stretched over a bony 
bunch causes great pain and lameness. When this is cut relief comes quickly, 
but when the operation is performed great care should be taken not to 
introduce any air or infection. 

FRACTURES— BROKEN BONES.— What is generally meant by a 
fracture is a broken bone. However, in surgery it means any breaking of 
the texture of a bone or other hard structure. Fractures are common in all 



76 THE PEOPLE'S HOME STOCK BOOK. 

the lower animals ; perhaps more so in the horse and dog than in other animals. 
There are four kinds of fractures met with — simple, compound, comminuted 
and compound comminuted. Simple fracture is that form wherein the bone 
is broken nearly straight across. Compound fracture is where the broken 
bone pierces the flesh and skin. Comminuted fracture is where the bone is 
broken in several places. Compound comminuted fracture is where the bone 
is shattered, cutting the soft tissues, and is rather complicated. 

CAUSES. — External violence is one of the causes, such as kicks, blows, 
and coming in contact with hard substances while going fast. Muscular con- 
traction when tied and confined for surgical work, rearing and falling, slip- 
ping and heavy pulling are all causes of fracture. 

SYMPTOMS. — As a rule it is not difficult to tell when a bone is broken 
for there is generally great pain and by motion a grating noise is produced 
by the ends of the broken bones rub,bing together. If the break is deep 
seated it may be puzzling for the bones are held pretty well in position by 
heavy muscles and the bones may not be much if any out of place. 

TREATMENT. — It is astonishing how fast a fracture mends in an ani- 
mal if the bones are put in place and held there. The whole object of treat- 
ment should be to put the bones back in place as quickly as possible and 
keep them there. When a fracture occurs in a part of the body which 
cannot be reached and the bones are much out of place the horse had better 
be killed for he will never recover. Always put the bones back in place 
promptly and apply splints and bandages that have been starched; or use 
plaster of Paris. It is often necessary to place the animal in slings. 

EXOSTOSIS OF THE JAW.— This is quite a common affection of 
the lower jaw and consists in one or more small bony bunches on the jaw. 

CAUSES. — The curb chain causes the most of them and the tight nose 
strap produces some ; also, eating out of small iron feed boxes is another 
common cause of exostosis. 

SYMPTOMS. — Sometimes they are small round bunches, but they may 
be quite flat and spread over considerable of the lower jaw. They do not 
always do much harm but spoil the appearance of the jaw. 

TREATMENT. — Give one-half dram iodide potassium at a dose in 
either feed or water twice a day for twenty days, then give the medicine 
once a day for thirty days. ^^ Apply iodine ointment. This you can secure 
at any drug store and it should be applied every day or two. 

BONE SPAVIN. — Bone spavin is a bony growth (exostosis) involving 
the hock joint, generally affecting the front and inner, lower portion of the 
joint. There is always considerable irritation, causing more or less inflam- 
mation of the bones. Whenever this inflammation affects the synovial mem- 
brane and covering of the bones, there will be lameness, but there may 
be no enlargement. But when there is any exudation (oozing out) of bony 
matter there will soon be an enlargement, showing what part of the joint 
is involved. 

CAUSES. — The causes of spavin are hereditary and exciting. The pre- 
disposing causes are horses with heavy bodies and light, weak, crooked 
hocks; these are the animals that appear to come honestly by bone spavin, 
J have known hundreds of horses of the same family to suffer from bone 
spavin lameness without ever working a day; consequently, they must have 
inherited a predisposition to this disease. The exciting causes are bruises 
of the joint, sprains, injuries, hard work and fast driving on hard roadSk

HORSE— LAMENESS. 77 

producing concussion and setting tip an inflammation of hock joint, espe- 
cially if the joint is crooked and narrow from the front to the back. 

SYMPTOMS. — A horse suffering from bone spavin lameness usually 
steps shorter with the lame leg and starts quite lame but grows less so after 
traveling a short distance. The exercise appears to stimulate a secretion of 
synovial fluid (joint oil) which oils the joint, relieving the pain and making 
the horse more comfortable but, as soon as he is allowed to stand still for 
a few minutes, he will start lame again. In more severe cases and of longer 
standing the lameness does not disappear very much with exercise. In 
nearly all cases of spavin lameness the horse steps on the toe when start- 
ing or stepping over in the stall and very often shows a great deal of 
lameness when traveling through deep mud or snow. When a spayin is 
causing lameness, the joint is usually inflamed. This is easily ascertained by 
wetting both hock joints with cold water; the diseased one always dries 
first. In chronic cases the muscles of the hip are generally wasted some from 
lack of exercise but this must not mislead you in determining the trouble. 
TREATMENT. — If an exciting cause has produced spavin, this cause 
should be removed before we can expect a recovery to take place. Unless 
the affected bones can be grown into a solid bone the horse will remain lame. 
In my practice and at my hospital I have treated thousands of cases of 
bone spavin and those that have recovered from their lameness were given 
absolute rest until they traveled sound and after getting well they re- 
mained so. The inflammation of the joint should be reduced with either 
hot or cold water applications. After applying these for a few days, apply 
any good home liniment, iodine ointment or light blisters, such as cerate of 
cantharides, or equal parts of tincture cantharides, turpentine, aqua ammonia 
and sweet oil. Apply once a day until the parts blister. Or, apply one part 
red iodide mercury, one part powdered cantharides and eight parts fresh 
(ard. These applications should not be made oftener than every week or ten 
days. There are many other blisters that you may use that will perhaps 
give you good results. Should blisters fail to reduce the lameness, have the 
horse fired. I have succeeded in relieving many cases by cutting a tendon 
which crosses the hock joint. This operation should not be attempted by 
any other than a skilled surgeon. A high-heeled shoe always relieves a spav- 
ined horse when traveling. Young horses are far more likely to recover 
from spavin lameness than old ones and when a horse with spavin warms 
out of his lameness he should recover if given sufficient rest and proper 
treatment. 

PEOPLE'S HOME REMEDIES FOR SPAVINS, SPLINTS, RING- 
BONES, ETC.— 

1. Cantharides, Etc. — To one ounce of lard and one-half ounce of tar add 
2 drams each of cantharides and corrosive sublimate and rub this mixture in 
thoroughly for about ten minutes. Twenty-four hours later apply vaseline 
and do this every night and morning until the blister has healed. 

2. Spavins, Splints and Ringbones. — ^To one-half pound of lard add 
2 ounces of turpentine, one ounce of cantharides and three drams of biniodide 
of mercury. These should be thoroughly mixed and then applied to spavins, 
splints or ringbones every week or ten days and the blistered surface should 
be healed with vaseline. This will be found to be an effective remedy. 

3. Soap, Salt and Turpentine for Bone Spavin.^Mix salt, turpentine 
and soft soap to make a soft salve. Apply three days and leave off for

three days but rub each day; then apply for six days and then rub gently 
until there is an oozing out of yellow matter. After this apply once every 
two or three days as long as there is a swelling. 

BOG SPAVIN AND BLOOD SPAVIN.— A bog spavin is a sort of puffy 
swelling situated on the fore part of the hock joint. The capsular ligament is 
always distended and on account of the irritation of the joint there is always 
an increased secretion of joint oil (synovial fluid). Associated with bog 
spavin we generally have thorough-pin. If an enlarged or varicose vein 
passes over the spavin it is sometimes called blood spavin. 

CAUSES. — Bog spavin is generally brought on by hard work, fast driv- 
ing, heavy pulling, irregular exercise and a predisposition from faulty con- 
formation of the hock joint. This is sometimes an hereditary ailment. 

SYMPTOMS. — The symptoms are exceedingly plain, for this puffy bulg- 
ing of the joint can readily be seen. When this' ailment occurs on a heavy 
horse, producing no lameness, it should not be regarded as serious but when 
it occurs on lighter horses it should be regarded with suspicion, especially 
if there be a deposit of calcareous matter in the joint, for these cases 
are difficult to treat successfully. The more tense and hard is this swelling, 
the less likely is the animal to recover. 

TREATMENT. — As stated, a heavy horse may suffer from bog spavin 
and it never hurt him ; these cases should be let alone. Cold applications 
and sometimes hot applications are helpful ; however, cold seems to produce 
the best results. Hand rubbing and slight pressure from a truss and bandag- • 
ing with pad are beneficial. Stimulating liniments, light blisters and some- 
times firing produce excellent results. Some practitioners recommend draw- 
ing off this fluid with an aspirator, then injecting some iodine into the 
joint; however, this must be regarded as rather dangerous, unless done by 
an expert and even then it very often sets up a violent inflammation of the 
joint, causing the animal great suffering; therefore, all things considered, it 
is not good practice. 
PEOPLE'S HOME REMEDIES FOR BOG-SPAVIN, BLOOD SPAVIN 

AND THOROUGH-PIN.— 

1. Bog and Blood Spavin and Thorough-Pin. — Mix three drams each of 
cantharides and biniodide of mercury ■\^ith four ounces of lard. Clip the 
hair and rub the ointment well into the parts. In forty-eight hours wash the 
parts clean and apply sweet oil every day. Repeat every ten days until 
cured. Tie the horse so that he cannot reach the parts. 

CURB. — A curb is a rupture or a sprain of a short ligament situated 
on the back part of the hock joint. The upper portion of the back tendons 
may also be sprained at the time of injury. 

CAUSES. — Many animals on account of having crooked hocks are liable 
to curb. This is on account of the hock being narrow from back to front 
and also on account of its being weak. Over exertion is the principal 
cause. 

SYMPTOMS. — A swelling usually appears suddenly on the back part 
of the hock which is tender on pressure and is generally inflarried. The 
lameness is usually noticeable but in some cases it is very slight. It is best 
seen by looking at it sideways. The least curve on the back part of the hock 
indicates a curb. 

TREATMENT.— The treatment does not differ from any other sprain 
of a ligament or tendon. It is important to give the animal rest. Reduce 



HORSE— LAMENESS. 79 

the inflammation by applying cold water or put one-half pound of sugar 
of lead into a gallon of water and apply five or six times a day. After the 
inflammation subsides blister with cerate of cantharides or apply one part 
of red iodide of mercury and eight parts of lard or vaseline. 

SPLINT. — A splint is a hard bony bunch situated on the cannon bone 
on either side of the foreleg but most often on the inside and just below 
the knee. Sometimes they are on the hind legs, but not very often. When 
they are situated close to the knee and afifect the joint or are close to the 
suspensory ligament they produce lameness but if situated on the shaft of 
the bone they seldom do much harm. When a splint is forming it generally 
produces slight lameness when the horse trots on hard roads, but he walks 
sound. 

CAUSES. — Concussion is the general cause of splints. They also come 
from blows, kicks, bruises and sprains. Striking the shin with the opposite 
foot causes a great many splints. 

SYMPTOMS. — When first forming the colt may walk sound and trot 
lame. The shin is usually hot and tender but if not near the knee the sore- 
ness soon disappears. 

TREATMENT. — Give the colt rest and apply either hot or cold water 
for a few days. Apply the following lotion : sugar of lead, one-fourth pound ; 
tincture arnica, one pint; water, one gallon; apply five times daily. Later 
apply liniment, iodine ointment or a light blister. 
PEOPLE'S HOME REMEDIES FOR SPLINTS.— 

1. Iodine. — Apply tincture of iodine daily for five or six weeks. This 
will frequently remove splints. 

3. Ointment for Splints. — Make an ointment of three ounces of lard, 
three drams of powdered cantharides and two drams of biniodide of mer- 
cury. Clip the hair from the parts and rub in the ointment for fifteen min- 
utes. On the third day apply sweet oil or lard to soften and remove scab. 
These applications should be repeated three times a month. 

THOROUGH-PIN.— Thorough-pin is very often associated with bog 
spavin and is a bursal enlargement, usually in connection with the flexor 
muscle or capsular ligament of the hock joint. It rarely produces lameness ; 
therefore, it is not considered a serious ailment. 

CAUSES. — It is generally the result of a sprain ; however, many of the 
heavy breeds of horses appear to be heir to this ailment for this puffy con- 
dition of the joint appears at or soon after birth. 

SYMPTOMS. — In this trouble there is always a puffy swelling on each 
side of the hock joint. It is not painful. When pressure is applied to one 
side it increases the bulging on the opposite side. 

TREATMENT. — If there is lameness the horse should be rested and 
the inflammation subdued with either hot or cold applications. Or, put 
14. pound of sugar of lead into one gallon of cold water and apply to the 
jo5nt five or six times a day, then apply cerate of cantharides once a week. 
Where the swelling is very great the fluid can be removed and a truss 
applied to prevent further distension ; however, this work should be done 
by a skillful veterinarian and even .hen it should not be done unless the 
horse is to receive extra good care after the operation. It is always difficult 
^o reduce a thorough-pin and almost impossible to entirely remove it. It 
is considered by veterinarians to be good practice to leave a thorough-pin 
alone if it is not very large and produces no lameness. Equal parts of soirits 



80 THE PEOPLE'S HOME STOCK BOOK. 

of camphor and tincture of iodine have given me very good results in the 
treatment of thorough-pin without resting the horse. 

OPEN JOINT.— This results from an injury caused by either a sharp 
or dull pointed substance making a wound which penetrates the inner struc- 
tures of the joint and allows the synovial fluid to escape. If there is a 
simple, small puncture, or cut, the wound may close quickly but if the tissues 
are badly bruised and lacerated considerable inflammation follows and the 
case becomes serious. 

TREATMENT. — One of the greatest mistakes that is usually made is 
the probing of such wound with a dirty probe. This very often infects the 
joint and makes the case a difficult one to treat while if it had been let alone 
a recovery might have taken place. It is always a good plan to remove 
sand or gritty matter or hairs and dirt that may have been punched into 
the wound at the time of the accident. The edges of the wound should be 
stitched closely together and hot packs dipped in a lotion composed of one 
part bi-chloride of mercury and one thousand parts of water should be kept 
on constantly for several days. The animal should be kept perfectly quiet 
It is fairly good practice to apply a light blister to that part of the joint 
not wounded. This produces swelling and very often closes a wound, thus 
giving it an opportunity to protect the open joint and allowing an adhesion 
and union of the edges which otherwise could not have taken place. The 
greatest danger lies in the movement of the joint, which of course stimulates 
the secretion of synovia, thus making the case worse. One part carbpHc 
acid and thirty parts water is a good dressing; or, dissolve one ounce of 
powdered alum or one ounce of sugar of lead or one ounce of sulphate of 
zinc in a quart of water. Any of the three are proper remedies to apply. 
I have obtained good results by dusting on equal parts of iodoform, boric 
acid and powdered alum once a day. In treating such cases, remember that 
they seldom recover unless the animal is kept from moving about. 
PEOPLE'S HOME REMEDIES FOR OPEN JOINT, OLD SORES, 

SCRATCHES, ETC.— 

1. Alum, Bluestone, Vinegar, Etc. — To a pint of good vinegar add 
one ounce each of powdered alum, bluestone and sugar of lead. Bathe the 
parts for fifteen minutes with water as hot as can be borne and then apply 
this lotion. This recipe has saved, a number of valuable horses. 

HIP JOINT LAMENESS— ARTHRITIS OF HIP JOINT— WHIRL- 
BONE LAMENESS.— Lameness of this kind is not common ; nevertheless, 
it is astonishing how many horsemen hold to the opinion that their horse is 
lame in the " whirlbone," as they call it, when they are lame elsewhere. 
The hip joint is well protected and is really the strongest joint in the 
body, being formed of some of the heaviest bones and held in place by a 
powerful ligament; besides, it is well protected by heavy muscles. In- 
flammation may occur in the joint, the result of injury, and we find rheumatic 
trouble in this joint, but it is seldom sprained. 

SYMPTOMS. — When the hip joint is inflamed the foot is raised from 
the ground and is lowered against the will of the animal. This is on ac- 
count of the lameness being painful. Atrophy of the muscles is pretty 
sure to follow lameness of the hip joint if it lasts a few weeks. There is 
always difficulty in bringing the limb forward and the toe is dragged near 
the ground. In some cases it is well to use the old test by placing a piece 
of board over the hip joint and striking it a blow with a mallet, which

HORSE— LAMENESS. 81 

causes great pain if the hip joint is sore and inflamed. Should this test 
fail, look for the lameness in some other part of the leg. 

TREATMENT. — Apply hot fomentations and give the animal rest. If 
occurring in the summer season, use cold water and if in winter, use hot 
water. Apply equal parts of turpentine, tincture cantharides, aqua ammonia 
and sweet oil every day or two and if you find it necessary to blister use 
cerate of cantharides. I have frequently obtained good results from setons. 
I dislike to put them into the hip during hot weather but for a deep-seated 
ailment like this they are of great value. 

DISLOCATION OF THE PATELLA— STIFLED.— The stifle of the 
horse is very much like the knee of man and when a dislocation takes place 
the cap slips out of the pulley-like groove in the bone in the front part of 
the stifle joint and of course when this happens the leg locks and it is im- 
possible for the animal to lift his foot forward. A dislocation is generally 
caused by the foot slipping backward and. the limb twisting when the 
weight of the body is on it. 

SYMPTOMS. — When the stifle bone is out of place the leg is generally 
kept back of the body with the foot close to the ground. The stifle appears 
to be swollen. 

' TREATMENT. — In some cases starting the animal with a whip will 
:ause him to bring the limb forward suddenly and the cap will slip into 
place; however, it is usually necessary to draw the foot forward either by 
lifting it or attaching a rope or strap round the fetlock and passing it through 
a collar on the neck and pulling it forward and when in this position an' as- 
sistant should press the bone into position. Apply cerate of cantharides to 
•the stifle joint as a blister. Sometimes it is necessary to keep the foot tied 
forward and the hind feet a little higher than the forefeet. 

SPRAIN OF THE STIFLE JOINT.— When the ligaments of the stifle 
joint become stretched from slipping or from an injury, setting up inflamma- 
tion and causing the animal to have trouble in bringing the leg forward, we 
are led to believe that he suffers from a sprain of the joint. 

TREATMENT. — If occurring in the summer, shower the stifle with 
cold water three or four times a day, or dissolve % pound of sugar of lead 
in a gallon of water and apply this lotion five times a day, or dissolve % 
pound saltpeter m i/^ gallon of vinegar and add a gallon of water and apply 
this lotion five times a day. After the inflammation subsides apply any good 
home liniment twice a day; or, use equal parts of turpentine, aqua ammonia 
and raw linseed oil once a day and later on if it is thought necessary blister 
with cerate of cantharides. 
STONE BRUISES— BRUISES OF THE SOLE OF THE FOOT.— 

CAUSES. — Horses with flat weak soles frequently bruise the bottom 
of the foot by stepping on pebbles, clinkers, pieces of brick, bolt heads and 
other hard substances. 

SYMPTOMS. — The bruised foot soon becomes hot and tapping the 
sole with a small hammer or block of wood causes considerable pain. If al- 
lowed to go on, the coronet swells and the inflammation increases ; the 
lameness also becomes more noticeable and in some cases the horse will 
scarcely put his foot to the ground. He usually holds the lame foot in advance 
of the other foot and steps either unusually long or quite short. 

TREATMENT. — If he is shod, remove the shoe; tap the sole of the 
loot lightly to locate the sore spot and if you suspect that pus has formed 



82 THE PEOPLE'S HOME STOCK BOOK. 

cut through the sole, making a very small opening and then pour in equal 
parts of peroxide of hydrogen and water and then apply one part carbolic acid 
and thirty parts water or a good healing powder composed of equal parts of 
iodoform, powdered alum and boric acid. If the opening through the sole 
is made large, proud flesh is liable to grow in the wound and if it does, 
apply burnt alum or crude carbolic acid or cut it oflf with a sharp knife or 
burn it down with a point of a red hot iron and continue applying healing 
remedies. 

SPEEDY CUT— BRUISED KNEE.— This usually results from a blow 
with the opposite foot in horses that have high knee action and that have 
narrow chests or toe out. Horses driven in deep snow are inclined to strike 
their knees. Following the blow there is more or less swelling on the inside 
of the knee and it is not unusual to have a serous sac or an abscess form 
which contains pus. 

TREATMENT. — When first noticed the inflammatory stage can be 
subdued by the continued use of either hot or cold applications and some 
cooling astringent lotion such as is made by dissolving one-quarter pound 
acetate of lead in a gallon of cold water and adding one pint of fluid ex- 
tract of arnica. These applications should be made five or six times a 
day. The knee should not be bandaged unless by an expert. If much fluid 
forms it may be necessary to allow it to escape through a small tube or if 
pus forms it should be allowed to escape with proper drainage, then treat 
it as an abscess. Certain horses, from conformation, can scarcely be shod, so 
they will not strike their knees, especially when going fast. The lighter 
the shoes, the less knee action; besides, if the inside of the shoe is made 
a little heavier this has a tendency to carry the foot out. The head should 
not be reined up high. The horse should be driven slow on rough roads 
and when turning a corner. I have owned many horses which required the 
knees to be protected with boots when they were driven fast, no matter 
how capable the shoer might have been. However, I recommend having 
a horse of this kind shod by the best mechanic you can find. 

SPRUNG HOCK. — Sprung hock is a sprain of the ligaments of the hock 
joint, bringing on an inflamed condition of the parts and usually resulting in 
an enlargement of the joint. It usually occurs in animals with crooked joints. 

CAUSES. — This condition is usually the result of injuries following a 
runaway or is caused by falls, slipping, kicks, blows or fractures. 

SYMPTOMS. — The animal is usually very lame and stands with -the 
hock flexed, never attempting to place any weight upon the limb. In se- 
vere cases the whole joint is badly swollen and very tender; this should be 
regarded as a serious injury. 

TREATMENT. — In all such cases it is impoitant to give the animal 
absolute rest. Apply either hot or cold applications constantly and when 
the inflammation and pain subside, apply iodine ointment or some stimulating 
and mildly counter-irritating liniment, such as equal parts turpentine, aqua 
ammonia and sweet oil, or any other good home liniment you may have 
on hand. 

CAPPED HOCK. — Capped hock is due to distension of a small bursa 
situated beneath the skin on the point of the hock. Or, it may be a distended 
bursa situated deeper and when the deeper-seated parts are affected it is 
more serious. 

CAUSES. — Capped hock is generally caused by kicking against the stall, 



HORSE— LAMENESS. 83 

or by kicks or blows. The heavy breeds of horses are the most likely to 
become affected. This is perhaps on account of their sluggish circulation. 
It also seems to follow debilitating diseases. 

SYMPTOMS. — There is a soft, puffy and very often painless swelling 
on the point of the hock, containing a water-like effusion. 

TREATMENT. — The secret of success in the treatment of capped hock 
generally lies in one's being able to remove the cause; hence, if caused by 
kicking in the stable in a single stall, remove the horse to a box stall or pad 
the single stall. Hot water applications are proper for early treatment and 
should be followed by daily applications of equal parts of alcohol, tincture 
of iodine and spirits of camphor. When it becomes necessary to open the 
sack it should be done with great care and cleanliness. A small opening 
should be made and the parts kept wet with one part bichloride mercury and 
500 parts tepid water. This will keep the parts from becoming infected. 
Fairly good results follow applications of red iodide of mercury, one part, 
and lard, eight parts; apply this every week or ten days. This should be 
the treatment in chronic cases. 
CAPPED ELBOW— ELBOW TUMOR— SHOE BOJL.— 

CAUSES. — These are usually caused by the heels of the shoe when the 
horse is obliged to lie down in a very narrow stall. They are also caused by 
the harness and by blows. 

SYMPTOMS. — There is first a hot, tender swelling and if not treated 
properly and the cause removed this grows and increases in size until it be- 
comes very large and especially is this true if it occurs in hot weather. 
A few days after the injury the swelling will fluctuate, indicating that it 
contains fluid and this fluid being serum may do very little harm. In other 
cases pus forms, which generally makes the horse quite lame. If the swell- 
ing contains serum, it may be absorbed and the bunch almost disappear, 
but if it contains pus it should be opened. 

TREATMENT. — Apply either hot or cold applications; I prefer cold 
applications in summer and hot ones in winter. If the swelling contains 
serum and is not very large apply tincture of iodine once or twice a day and 
it will perhaps cause the fluid to be absorbed, but if the swelling is exten- 
sive and contains much fluid it should be drawn off with a canula and trocar 
and the sac injected with a small quantity of tincture of iodine once a day. 
In many cases I find it good treatment to lay the sac freely open and if it. 
contains a hard bunch, cut it out. Chronic elbow tumors can be treated 
successfully in no other way than by cutting them out. Following an opera- 
tion of this kind the wound always heals slowly. Apply peroxide of hydrogen 
twice a day and dust on equal parts of iodoform, boric acid and tannic acid, 
but be sure to prevent his bruising the sore parts. In some cases I find 
it necessary to keep the horse in a standing position until the wound heals, 
and horses that bruise their elbow should wear a roll around each pastern 
to prevent the shoe from coming in contact with the elbow. 



WOUNDS. 

(Including Abscesses, Poll-Evil, Fistulous Withers, Saddle Galls, Sore 
Shoulders and Wounds of all Kinds.) 



WOUNDS. — Wounds are a division of the soft structure of the body 
and are named according to their appearance, depending on how and by 
what sort of an instrument they were produced. 

INCISED WOUNDS. — Incised wounds are those made with a sharp 
knife or some sharp substance making a clean cut and their length is greater 
than their depth. When a muscle is cut off the wound always gaps wide open, 
much more so than if the muscle is cut lengthwise and when cut transversely 
it makes a bad-looking wound. i 

PUNCTURED WOUNDS. — Punctured wounds are those made with a 
dull instrument or stick and may be caused in hundreds of different ways. 
There is no use of enumerating them but a punctured wound should always 
be looked upon as being much more serious than an incised wound. 

LACERATED WOUNDS. — Lacerated wounds are those which are 
more or less torn. They are not very deep and are often caused from com- 
ing in contact with wire, being kicked by a horse or running against some 
sharp substance, but these wounds are not often serious. 

CONTUSED WOUNDS. — Contused wounds are those caused by bump- 
ing against blunt things or are inflicted by a blow or by over-reaching or 
striking or by being kicked by a horse without a shoe or with a dull shoe. 

WOUNDS AT THE JOINTS.— These are quite often serious for there 
may be open joint in connection and if so they are not easily treated success- 
iully. They may be caused by a splinter of wood or by a pitchfork prong. 
Whenever the discharge is stringy and odorless and the animal very lame it 
indicates open joint. 

POISONED WOUNDS.— These are those made by a snake but are not 
common in this country. Of course many wounds are poisoned by things 
people apply but this should not be the case. 

TREATMENT OF WOUNDS.— In the treatment of wounds it is well 
to keep in mind that the bleeding should be arrested first. If an artery is 
opened it should be tied at once with fine silk, linen, or catgut and if it is to 
be left in it should be a substance which will be absorbed without causing any 
irritation or suppuration ; hence the necessity of using sterilized catgut. The 
wound should be irrigated or washed out with one part bi-chloride of mercury 
and one thousand parts tepid water; then the edges of the wound should 
be brought together and stitched closely. If the parts are clean when the 
sewing is done and the animal is kept in a clean place the wound will gen- 
erally heal rapidly. It must be remembered that if impure air is kept away 
from a wound it will suppurate less and heal more quickly. There is always 
a great difference of opinion as to what remedy will heal a wound most 
quickly. I am of the opinion that many of the simple home remedies are 
as good as any and a wound generally does well if it has plenty of pure fresh 
air. Keeping wouijded animals in dirty, filthy stables and barnyards is 

84 



HORSE— WOUNDS. 85 

bed practice for they seldom do well. Most of the modern healing remedies 
are superior to the old ones. I have obtained good results by using peroxide 
of hydrogen, carbolic acid, coal-tar preparations, acetate of lead, sulphate of 
zinc, tannin, boric acid, alum, oxide of zinc and bi-chloride of mercury. Use 
but one of these and of course in water as they should generally be reduced. 
Nearly all watery lotions should be applied twice a day. If a wound fills 
with a fungus, burn it with nitrate of silver or other caustic or burn with a 
red-hot iron. 
PEOPLE'S HOME REMEDIES FOR WOUNDS, CUTS, ETC.— 

1. Kerosene Oil. — Frequently apply kerosene oil to the cuts. It is an 
inexpensive remedy but it is as good as anything that can be used. 

2. Lard and Tar. — Mix equal parts of lard and pine tar and apply 
freely to cuts and sores. This is not only healing but it also keeps the flies 
away. 

3. Onions and Lard. — Boil onions in lard and make as strong of onion as 
possible. This should be strained and of course kept clean. Apply to flesh 
wounds once a day. 

4. Vinegar, Eggs, Turpentine and Ammonia. — Take equal parts of 
these, shake well, let stand 10 or 12 hours and apply twice a day. 

5. Glycerine and Carbolic Acid. — Bathe the parts with a mixture of 
one part of carbolic acid with ten or fifteen parts of glycerine. 

6. Alum or Bluestone. — If proud flesh appears it should be treated with 
either burnt alum or powdered bluestone. 

7. Wounds and Cuts. — To 8 ounces of linseed oil add one ounce of car- 
bolic acid and one dram each of oxide of zinc and iodoform. This should be 
mixed thoroughly and applied twice a day. 

8. Burns and Scalds. — Bathe the parts with a solution of common bak- 
ing soda or a weak solution of sugar of lead. 

9. Lime Water and Linseed Oil for Scalds and Burns. — Apply a mix- 
ture of equal parts of lime water and linseed oil. This mixture is called " car- 
ron oil " and is one of the best things known for burns and scalds on either 
man or beast. 

10. Carbolic Acid and Sweet Oil for Cuts. — Apply one part carbolic acid 
and ten parts sweet oil to wounds twice a day. 

SCREW WORMS OR MAGGOTS IN WOUNDS.— (See " Cattle De- 
partment.") 

AIR UNDER THE SKIN.— (See " Cattle Department.") 
. PUNCTURED WOUNDS OF THE FEET.— Punctured wounds are of 
frequent occurrence in cities and especially about glass works and iron and 
nail mills. 

CAUSES. — Punctures of the feet are most commonly caused by step- 
ping on nails, pieces of iron, sharp stones, cinders, broken pieces of glass, 
sharp snags of wood or any sharp uneven substance. 

SYMPTOMS. — It is generally not very difficult to tell whether a horse 
has a punctured foot or not if the accident has occurred a day or two be- 
fore ; however, in slight cases where the wound is not large or deep, it is very 
often quite puzzling to locate it. A puncture of the foot should always be 
regarded as a serious ailment for it is generally done with a dull, hard, and 
dirty_ substance ; besides, a portion of dirt is generally driven into the foot at 
the time of the puncture and if the substance remains in any great length of 
time it is quite likely to set up considerable inflammation. When the snag 



86 • THE PEOPLE'S HOME STOCK BOOK. 

or nail is pulled out, dirt and foreign bodies are usually stripped off and left 
in the foot, thereby producing inflammation which is soon followed by the 
formation of pus. The foot is usually hot and tender and when the horse is 
resting he stands upon the toe. In severe cases the leg is sometimes swelled 
clear to the body and is accompanied with great pain, quick pulse and often 
loss of appetite and some fever. 

TREATMENT.— Wash the foot clean, search for the seat of injury and 
if the nail, snag, or other foreign body is still in the foot, pull it out and 
cut down to the bottom of the wound and allow the pus and dirt to escape. 
Apply peroxide of hydrogen and ten minutes later apply one part carbolic 
acid and fifteen parts water ; or, coal-tar disinfectant full strength twice a day. 
Each day stand the horse in hot water to which has been added one part of 
bi-chloride of mercury to one thousand parts of water. Clean and well- 
prepared poultices relieve the pain. Treat these punctures as advised in 
treating wounds. 
PEOPLE'S HOME REMEDIES FOR NAIL PUNCTURES.— 

1. Lye Water and Poultices. — Stand the foot in lye made of wood ashes 
and hot water. After two hours in this lye make a poultice of the lye and 
some corn meal and apply to the foot keeping on for six hours but changing 
frequently to keep it hot. 

2. Peach Leaves. — Put some juice obtained from peach leaves into the 
wound and bind on some of the crushed leaves which should be moistened. 
This will be found a very effective remedy. , 

3. Coal Tar Disinfectant. — Apply one part coal tar disinfectant and ter- 
parts water to wound twice a day. 

4. Powdered Borax. — Fill the wound with powdered borax and cover h 
with cotton batting or wool. 

PRICKING. — Whenever a horse shoer drives a nail into the sensitive 
foot instead of through the insensitive horn or wall of the hoof, we call it 
pricking; however, it may have been entirely accidental. 

CAUSES. — In most cases it is the result of carelessness on the part of 
the horse shoer. A nail sometimes splits, one part going into the sensitive 
foot and the other going in as it should. Sometimes a nail is driven into and 
withdrawn from the sensitive foot without even the knowledge of the shoer. 
Nails fast in boards or frozen ground very often puncture the sole of the foot 
and pull out. 

SYMPTOMS. — Whenever a horse steps on the toe and keeps the heel 
of the foot up, also when it keeps the foot off the ground and the foot is very 
hot, be sure to examine for foot punctures or pricks. If a nail is driven too 
high, tap the hoof opposite the nail and if he is pricked this tapping will 
hurt him. 

TREATMENT. — Remove the cause as quickly as possible and this is 
best done by pulling out the nail. Treat the puncture as I have directed for 
punctured wounds. 

WOUNDS OF THE LIPS.— (See " Cattle Department.") 
BITES OF INSECTS AND SNAKES.— (See " Cattle Department.") 
FRACTURE OF THE HIP BONE— HIPPED.— In young animals 
the little nodule on the extreme angle of the hip is often broken off by 
blows before it has become firm with the parent bone, but the most common 
injury of the hip of both young and old are fracture of the bone and a frac- 
ture of the hip seldom takes place without the point remaining somewhat 



HORSE— WOUNDS. 87 

lower than the opposite side and also a little ways in, thus giving the point 
of the hip a smooth appearance. 

CAUSES. — It is caused by falling on hard ground, by blows, coming in 
contact with the sides of doors or stall posts and fracturing the bone or bones 
of the hip. 

TREATMENT. — As a rule the animal should be placed in slings to keep 
him in a quiet condition until the bones unite. In some cases a fibrous 
union takes place which means a poor and unsatisfactory recovery; however, 
if the bones of a young horse are kept in proper position a bony union gen- 
erally takes place and a satisfactory recovery follows. Hot fomentations 
relieve the pain somewhat and should be kept up constantly for two or three 
days after the accident occurs and it is well to apply equal parts of tincture 
of arnica, laudanum, spirits of camphor and witch hazel, three or four times 
a day and if this mixture produces pain add some water to it. A hipped 
horse usually steps a little shorter with his imperfect hip and hitches some 
when trotting, but many of them are about as useful after the accident as be- 
fore. If the bones are badly shattered the horse should be destroyed. 

ABSCESS. — Abscesses consist of accumulations of water, serum or 
pus and are generally held within a wall and may arise in any part of the 
body. They are usually classed as acute and cold, the latter being of a 
chronic character. Acute abscesses are generally found in the glands or 
muscular parts of the body. 

CAUSES. — Abscesses are very often the result of a bruise or injury of 
some kind or they may be the result of infection ; also, many germ diseases, 
such as strangles or distemper, appear to terminate in abscesses. Whenever 
an animal suffers from blood poisoning he is very likely to have an abscess 
in some part of the body. It is also a common termination of tuberculosis 
and of lung, kidney and liver diseases. Abscesses very often form in the 
chest or abdomen. 

SYMPTOMS. — When an abscess is the result of a bruise it is more or 
less inflamed and tender, usually increasing in size and tenderness until it 
is either opened or breaks of itself. When abscesses form in the body the 
animal usually suffers from chills and fever. 

TREATMENT. — Whenever you think that an abscess is forming the 
aim should be to hasten its development as rapidly as possible. This is 
best accomplished by hot fomentations and poultices. The principal object 
of poultices is to keep up the heat and moisture. Constant application of 
fomentations of hot water or hot packs or a hot water bag are of great 
service in hastening suppuration or the forming of pus. I have also found 
daily applications of the following liniment to have a good effect. Take tur- 
pentine, one part; aqua ammonia, one part and sweet oil, six parts. If you 
have ho sweet oil use raw linseed oil. It will do no harm to make these appli- 
cations twice a day. As soon as the hair plucks out easily and the swelling 
fluctuates, open and allow the pus to escape. Inject some peroxide, of hydrogen 
and ten minutes later use one part carbolic acid and thirty parts water or any 
other useful home healing remedy. Chronic cold abscesses should be opened 
or cut out if possible. 

COLD ABSCESS.— Cold abscess is a term applied to a swelling 
that usually contains pus in its center. These abscesses are very often sit- 
uated on the neck, shoulder, or withers and may be of enormous size and 
gradually settle down until they are not very large. This pus is usually walled 



88 THE PEOPLE'S HOME STOCK BOOK. 

in with fibrous, gristle-like tissue. Many times these abscesses apparently 
do very little harm. 

CAUSES.— They are usually the result of a bruise or an injury of some 

kind. 

SYMPTOMS. — The swelling is seldom painful on pressure, very often 
movable an^ not always deep-seated. Swellings of this kind are extremely 
common on the lower part of the shoulders, on the withers and on the poll 
or back part of the head. 

TREATMENT. — Whenever they are suspected to contain pus they 
should be cut open and, if possible, their entire wall removed. Then apply 
any of the home remedies, such as lotions made of sugar of lead, one ounce to 
one quart of water; sulphate of zinc, one ounce to one quart of water; sul- 
phate of copper, one-half ounce to one quart of water; carbolic acid, one part 
to thirty parts water; or any of the coal tar disinfectants that may be on 
hand. I have found in the treatment of such cases very little benefit from 
external applications without opening the abscess; however, if you use any 
apply tincture of iodine once a day. 

POLL-EVIL. — Poll-evil is an abscess which is usually the result of an 
injury of some kind affecting the muscles on the upper and fore part of the 
neck. Little vitality exists in the diseased parts and pus very often burrows 
down beneath the muscles and remains there until it affects the bones. 
This ailment is not now nearly so common as many years ago when ceilings 
of stables were much lower than they are now. * 

CAUSES. — Poll-evil is caused in a variety of ways but it can gener- 
ally be traced to either direct or indirect injuries, such as striking the head 
against the upper part of a doorway, wearing badly-fitting halters or 
bridles, to jumpers wearing a yoke, pressure from over-check, or blows. 
These are the most common causes of abscess on the poll or head. 

SYMPTOMS. — There is always some swelling, heat and tenderness 
which, if not relieved, soon spreads and if it persists it indicates the forma- 
tion of pus. The nose is poked out somewhat to relieve the top of the neck. 
In some cases a sort of cold abscess forms which does not appear to cause 
much trouble and a swelling of the muscles remains after the inflammation 
of the parts has subsided. 

TREATMENT. — The treatment depends upon the stage of the case. 
If but recently bruised, apply either hot or cold applications and give cooling 
laxative diet and the recovery takes place quickly. If pus forms, allow it to 
escape, inject one part peroxide of hydrogen and three parts water slowly twice 
a day. Then inject some carbolic lotion, one part to thirty of water; or coal- 
tar disinfectant, one part to twenty of water, twice a day after using the 
peroxide of hydrogen. (See treatment for bruises and abscesses, also Home 
Remedies following " Fistulous Withers.") 

FISTULOUS WITHERS.— A fistula is a tube-like channel that dis- 
charges and is tardy in healing. It may affect any part of the body; however, 
in horses the poll and withers and heel seem to be the favorite locations fo:' 
fistulas. 

CAUSES. — They are usually the result of an injury or bruise of some 
kind causing a swelling to appear on one or both sides of the withers which 
in a few days may become soft and contain fluid. If left to itself the swell- 
ing increases, breaks and discharges its contents. The discharge at first is 
usually thin and watery, containing some blood and later on some yellow 



HORSE— WOUNDS. 89 

particles similar to pus. The tendency of the wounds is to heal but not re- 
main so, filling up and breaking open every few weeks or months. 

TREATMENT. — Open the swelling and allow its contents to escape. 
Slowly inject one part peroxide of hydrogen and three parts water; this will 
clean out the pus. Take strips of muslin that have been dipped in per- 
chloride of antimony and insert in fistula and allow it to remain in for two, 
three or four days, repeating the application every three or five days. After 
the wound appears to have been stimulated enough, use mild healing rem- 
edies, such as carbolic acid and water, one to twenty; bi-chloride mercury, 
one to one thousand ; chloride of zinc, one to one thousand ; or, dissolve one- 
half ounce permanganate of potash in one gallon of water and use this ; or, 
■use coal tar disinfectant, one part to fifteen of water. When the swelling 
first appears, hot fomentations or cold packs may prevent efifusion or the 
forming of pus. In chronic cases I believe in using the knife freely and in 
some cases it is necessary to remove a portion of the bone before a cure can 
be efifected. For was'hing out pus and washing off the shoulder, use the 
peroxide of hydrogen. 
PEOPLE'S HOME REMEDIES FOR FISTULA AND POLL-EVIL.— 

1. Muriatic Acid and Lye. — Cleanse the sore thoroughly and drop on 
several drops of muriatic acid each day until it looks like a fresh wound; 
then wash with castile soap suds and let it heal. If there are pipes, a bit 
of concentrated lye may be wrapped in two thicknesses of white tissue paper 
and inserted in each pipe. The lye in the pipes and the acid on the sore will 
cure every case. Keep the bowels-open while administering this treatment. 

2. Preventive of Fistula and Poll-Evil. — At the beginning give oil or 
salts to open the bowels and then give one-fourth ounce of saltpeter three 
times a day in the feed or water. Three or four times a day pour cold water 
from a height upon the inflamed parts. This pouring should be continued 
for an hour each time. If resorted to in time this treatment will prevent an 
abscess forming and any further trouble. 

3. For Fistula or Poll-Evil Before the Formation of Pus. — To 6 ounces 
of alcohol add 4 ounces of camphor gum and 3 ounces each of oil of spike, 
oil of sassafras, oil of tansy and beef's gall. This will be found a sure cure 
if applied once a day before the formation of pus. 

SORE BACK— SADDLE GALLS, COLLAR GALLS AND SORE 
SHOULDERS. — These ailments are usually the result of an exciting cause, 
such as friction produced from badly-fitting saddles or back pads. This is 
also true regarding sore shoulders and necks and breasts, which are almost 
invariably the result of dirty, badly fitting, shoulder or breast collars. The 
soft, tender shoulders, breast and back of a young horse should be toughened 
somewhat before he is put to hard work and especially in warm weather; 
it is seldom necessary in cold weather for horses do not gall nearly sg 
easily then. 

TREATMENT. — First of all, if it is possible, remove the cause, which 
is generally a bad-fitting harness or saddle. When starting 'to work young 
horses or those who have been long idle, the shoulders should be washed 
with cold water, adding a tablespoonful of salt to each quart. This should 
be done not less than three or four times a day. Or, apply the following lotion 
which is. not expensive and will heal and toughen sore and tender shoulders 
and backs. Dissolve four ounces of sugar of lead, three ounces of sulphate of 



90 THE PEOPLE'S HOME STOCK BOOK. 

zinc and two ounces of tannic acid in a gallon of cold water and apply to 
tender parts four or five times daily. By soaking oak bark in water and mak- 
ing a tea and applying it the parts will toughen. If the sore is raw apply 
peroxide of hydrogen twice a day and ten minutes later apply equal parts 
sub-nitrate of bismuth, oxide zinc, powdered alum and sulphur. Nearly all 
healing remedies are proper ones to apply to sore shoulders and backs. Re- 
member it is very important to keep the collar and saddle clean. 
PEOPLE'S HOME REMEDIES.— 

1. Copperas and Blue Vitriol. — To a pint of water add one dram of 
copperas and one-half dram of blue vitriol. Wash the galled spots with soap 
suds before applying this solution. 

2. Milk and White Lead. — Moisten some white lead with a little milk 
and apply twice a day to the galled parts. The parts should be washed before 
each application. ^

DISEASES OF THE FETLOCK, ANKLE 
AND FOOT. 

(Including Ring-Bone, Side-Bone, Wind-Galls, Corns, Quarter Crack, 
Sand Crack, Quitter, Thrush, Over-Reaching, Interfering, Knuckling, 
Founder, Etc.) 



RING-BONE. — Ring-bone is a ring of bony material extending around 
thre pastern just above the hoof. It is the result of inflammation in the can- 
cellated tissue of the bone.- We have two kinds of ring-bone — high and low. 
The high ring-bone affects the pastern joint, while the low kind very often 
involves the cofSn joint. Sometimes there is a deposit of bony matter on the 
pastern, affecting no joint. This must be regarded as less serious than either 
of the other two. In some cases I have known the fetlock to become alTected. 

CAUSES. — As in bone spavin the causes are predisposing, or donstitu- 
tional, and exciting. The close inbreeding and the mating of sire or dam that 
suffers or has suffered from ring-bone, are very likely to produce offspring 
that suffer from this disease, especially if they are subjected to any of the 
exciting causes to which I shall refer. Hard work and fast driving, also any 
severe injury to the pastern or foot may produce ring-bone. Improper 
shoeing is another very common cause. Horses with short, upright pasterns 
when driven fast on hard roads before they have fully matured are quite 
likely to suffer from ring-bone. 

SYMPTOMS. — It is well to keep in mind that a natural enlargement 
of the parts may readily be mistaken for a ring-bone; consequently, many 
a sound horse is subjected to torture on account of some ignorant person 
having pronounced him unsound from ring-bone. Occasionally a ring-bone 
will form without producing much pain or any lameness, but as a rule the 
horse shows considerable lameness during the period of its development. 
When a ring-bone appears on the foreleg the horse steps on his heel. This 
is done to remove the weight from the toe. When it appears on the hind 
leg the animal always steps on his toe, and when traveling he brings the 
foot forward carefully. At first the enlargement is usually soft but later on 
it hardens. By flexing (bending) the joint or trotting the horse on hard 
footing it always increases the pain and lameness. 

TREATMENT. — The treatment of ring-bone is very similar to that of 
bone spavin. First subdue the inflammation with either hot or cold applica- 
tions. Give him rest and apply counter-irritation. If the foot is not level it 
should be made so and light blisters applied. If they fail, have the animal 
fired. When blisters and firing fail, try plantar neurectome for it is very 
often successful in relieving the animal of pain and making him go sound. 
This operation consists in removing an inch or more of the nerve, either above 
or below the fetlock, on both sides of the leg. I have known a bar shoe 
to give considerable relief and I have also known many cases to recover 
without much rest when the aiiimal was used for slow work on soft footing. 

91 



92 THE PEOPLE'S HOME STOCK BOOK. 

A ring-bone situated low down should be regarded as a serious ailment and 
even when the disease has subsided the animal may go stiff on accouni 
of the joint's being anchylosed. 

PEOPLE'S HOME REMEDIES FOR RING-BONE, STIFF JOINTS, 
BUNCHES, ETC.— 

1. Ring-Bone. — Apply equal parts of oil of origanum, corrosive sub- 
limate and tincture of myrrh. Use this carefully as it is quite severe. This 
gives excellent results. 

2. Bunches, Stiff Joints and Ring-Bone. — To eight ounces of turpentine 
add 2 tablespoonfuls of salt and the white of a dozen eggs and apply to 
bunches, stiff joints or ring-bone,- once a day. 

SIDE-BONE. — This consists of an ossification of the lateral cartilages 
situated pa'rtly within and partly above the heel on either side of the foot. 

CAUSES. — Side-bones are frequently met with in all heavy breeds of 
horses and in some horses it is no doubt the result of a hereditary tendency, 
In the lighter breeds of horses it often produces lameness and is very often 
the result of keeping the heels too high. Another cause is fast driving on hard 
roads, which produces a great deal of concussion; it is also the result of in- 
juries, such as punctures and bruises which set up an inflammation causing 
ossification of the cartilage. It is often the result of poor shoeing, too much 
of the pressure being placed on the wall of the foot. 

SYMPTOMS. — There is an enlargement and tenderness of the cartilage 
with a hardening which produces lameness in some cases. 

TREATMENT. — If the horse is to be worked, shoe him with a bar shoe, 
applying pressure to the frog, bar, sole and wall ; besides, it is important to 
lower the heel and drive the horse as slowly as possible when on hard roads. 
It is all the better if driving can be avoided. Subdue the inflammation with 
hot or cold applications and apply either tincture of iodine, iodine ointment 
or some good home liniment. Or, apply light blisters of cerate of cantharides, 
or one part red iodide of mercury and twelve parts lard every few days until 
a recovery takes place. In my practice and at my hospital I often find it 
necessary to perform a surgical operation. We sometimes give the animal 
an anaesthetic after he is cast; or, the operation can be done in a humane 
and painless manner by injecting a six per cent, solution of cocaine hypo- 
dermically over 1:he important nerves leading to the foot. When the side- 
bone is removed, the operation should be performed by a surgeon and the 
wound kept perfectly clean until it heals. A recovery usually takes place 
in three or four weeks. There are no cases of side-bone that are incurable 
under this treatment. 

WIND-GALLS— WIND-PUFFS.— Wind-galls are soft, puffy, bursal 
enlargements situated on the back part of the leg just above the fetlock joint; 
however, the same ailment affects horses in different parts of the body in the 
form of enlarged burscE, in connection with the tendons. In a majority of 
cases wind-galls are not productive of much harm; however, in some cases 
they do become hard and tender, producing lameness, especially where a 
joint is affected. We often meet with bursal swellings in the knee and hock 
which are, of course, of the same character as a wind-gall and on accoUnt 
of their location injure the horse. 

CAUSES. — The early cause of wind-galls is generally over-exertion, 
fast driving on hard roads or pulling too heavy loads and a great many horses, 
on account of inherited faulty conformation, seem to come honestly by them'

for very slight exciting causes seem to be productive of them. A horse with 
straight, upright pasterns is more likely to suffer from wind-galls than a 
horse that has oblique pasterns ; but the heavy, coarse breeds of horses seem 
to get them without doing much hard work. 

SYMPTOMS. — A soft, puffy, painless swelling, without much heat, 
situated near a joint or a tendon may be called a wind-gall. Chronic wind- 
galls are very likely to become hard. 

TREATMENT. — In the early stages of this ailment, pressure applied 
by small pads with a bandage over them has a good effect. Alcoholic stim- 
ulants or cooling astringents applied to them also have a good effect. Put 
1/4 pound of sugar of lead and three ounces of muriate ammonia into a gal- 
lon of water and apply four or five times a day. Or, apply equal parts of 
spirits of camphor and iodine. Showering with cold water, during the summer 
time, is very beneficial. When the bunches harden apply iodine ointment. 
I have sometimes found it necessary to use an aspirator, drawing off the 
fluid by suction. Sometimes, injecting a weak solution of iodine proved 
successful; however, opening wind-galls is work for a veterinarian. Wind- 
galls often retu-n when the horse is put to work. 

CORNS. — A corn is a simple bruise of that part of the sole included 
between the bars and the wall of hoof at the heel, but later there is generally 
an increased growth of horn and the formation of a horny tumor which 
presses on the quick. In other cases the bruise sets up an active inflammation 
which is soon followed by the formation of matter or pus which, is not 
allowed to escape, will burrow toward the coronet and break. When this 
condition occurs it is called quittor. Corns are most common in flat feet and 
on horses with low heels and are usually situated on the inside quarter. 

CAUSES. — Improper shoeing is no doubt the most common cause of 
corns. They are caused by allowing horses to wear their shoes too long, 
keeping the heels too high, using too narrow shoes, fast driving on hard 
roads, weakening the foot by too much cutting and an uneven distribution 
of pressure which results from leaving the inner heel too high. In fact, any 
cause that will produce contraction is likely to cause corns. 

SYMPTOMS. — The animal is usually lame and in some cases extremely 
so, usually pointing the foot if only one be affected. A horse may have a corn 
and show very little soreness or lameness when walking, but if trotted on 
hard footing will show it plainly. A very good test to ascertain whether or 
not he has a corn it to tap the quarter gently with a small hammer or piece 
of hard wood and if he shows pain it is a good plan to remove the shoe ; but, 
before doing so, upon tapping the opposite quarter he should show no pain 
whatever unless a harder blow is struck than on tender quarter. The heel 
is usually a little feverish and many times pressure applied to the coronet 
will produce pain and when walking he will show a tendency to trip and 
stumble. When the shoe is removed the bruised quarter will be found some- 
what inflamed; or, you will find, perhaps, a small pebble or gravel. How- 
ever, gentle pressure on the quarter will determine whether the corn is pro- 
ducing lameness or not. 

TREATMENT. — Remove the shoe and pare down carefully, but never 
dig down deep with a dirty knife. When the corn is reached the pus will 
run if there be any present. The sole should not all be cut out and only a 
small opening should be made to allow the matter to escape. Pour in some 



U THE PEOPLE'S HOME STOCK BOOK. 

peroxide of hydrogen or any good home healing remedy. Avoid using caustics 
or active counter-irritants. Generally speaking, a bar shoe is preferable to an 
open one. Keep in mind the importance of reheving the quarter arj remov- 
ing the cause. A three-quarter shoe may be used in some cases. In many 
cases, especially chronic ones, the corn can be completely removed and the 
wound healed in two or three weeks ; however, when this is done the opera- 
tion should be performed by a veterinarian and the foot given good care 
and kept clean after the operation. 

QUARTER CRACK— CRACKS IN THE WALL.— Cracks in the wall 
is a condition of the foot due to a separation of the wall of the hoof. It is 
called sand crack when sand or gravel is found in the sore and when the 
split in the hoof is near the heel it is called quarter crack. 

CAUSES. — Many horses seem to be predisposed to foot ailments of this 
kind. They usually have thin, weak hoofs, perhaps flat. It is caused by the 
heels being kept too high, the hoofs being rasped too thin, injuries to the 
coronet, soaking the hoofs too much if they are not kept moist afterward and 
by uneven shoeing. 

TREATMENT.— First of all the foot should be made level and a bar 
shoe applied carefully so that there is pressure on the sole, bars, frog and 
wall, except that part of the wall under and near the crack. The edges of the 
crack should be thinned and the hoof cut through at the coronet. This 
cut or burn should be at right artgles to the crack, then the wall will grow 
down solid. A nail should be driven through the edges of the crack and riv- 
eted; or, a copper plate with Small screws should be applied to the hoof to 
hold the parts together. Wet swabs or poultices help take out the soreness. 
Many times, using a three-quarter shoe is the best way to shoe a horse 
that goes lame from a quarter crack. 

SAND CRACK. — A sand crack is a separation of the wall of the foot 
running parallel to the fibers of the wall. It shows in the fore part of the 
hoof and no doubt derived its name from its being so common in sandy 
countries. 

CAUSES. — Horses with weak, flat feet very often have sand cracks and 
it would seem as though they came honestly by them. Certain breeds seem 
predisposed to sand cracks. Keeping the heel too high, lack of moisture, 
standing on dry floors, and lack of regular exercise are the common causes 
of sand crack. 

SYMPTOMS. — The crack usually appears quite suddenly, causing some 
lameness and, on close examination, a little blood will be found at the 
top of the hoof. The crack usually commences at the top of the hoof and 
extends downward. When buying a horse it is well to examine for sand 
crack for if the hair is long it might be overlooked. 

TREATMENT. — Burn or cut through the hoof at the coronet and draw 
the edges of the crack together with a nail, clip, or plate and screws. 

QUITTOR. — This disease is indicated by a. swelling on the heel which 
is generally discharging pus through a sinus or what is commonly called 
a " pipe." This is a serious ailment when occurring in animals with strong 
feet. 

CAUSES. — It occurs as a result of bruises, treads, pricks, corns, punc- 
tures, wounds and quarter cracks. 

SYMPTOMS. — In many cases lameness is the first symptom noticed. 



HORSE— DISEASES OF FETLOCK. ANKLE AND FOOT. 95 

On examination a hard swelling is discovered on the heel, which soon opens 
and discharges pus. Some time later several openings may be discharging 
matter frorii this same quarter of foot. 

TREATMENT. — If it is possible to ascertain the cause, remove it at 
once. Foment the foot in warm salt qnd water. If no pus is coming from 
the bunch, poultice with bran, linseed meal, carrots or antiphlogistine. Cut- 
ting away any horn that may be pressing on bruised parts or thinning the 
wall may relieve the swollen heel. If it is the result of a suppurating corn 
(gravel), open lower part of heel to obtain drainage and use peroxide of hydro- 
gen ; ten minutes later pack opening with equal parts of iodoform and boric 
acid and then cover the heel wound with oakum and keep the foot quiet and 
perfectly clean. If the quarter is open at coronet the wall of heel should be 
lowered and weakened by thinning it. In some cases the sinus or wall of 
the abscess, may be scraped out and it may be necessary to remove a portion of 
the wall in order to get at the abscess. It is well to keep in mind that proper 
drainage is important, dropping a grain or two of bi-chloride of mercury 
(corrosive sublimate) to the bottom of a pipe will slough out the sinus. 
It may be necessary to repeat this application and as soon as the parts appear 
healthy use peroxide of hydrogen and such astringents, as permanganate of 
potash, carbolic acid, sulphate of zinc, sugar of lead, or coal-tar disinfectant, 
but be sure to keep the foot clean and free from external infection. If the 
lateral cartilages are diseased badly it may be necessary to remove them 
before a recovery will take place. 

THRUSH. — Thrush is a diseased condition of the fatty frog, or may be 
an irritation of the sensitive structures of the back part of the foot. It is 
characterized by an ofifensive discharge from the cleft of the frog. 

CAUSES. — Thrush is often the result of standing in filthy stables or 
running in filthy barnyards. It may result from inflammation of the coffin 
joint; standing too much in cold water; stuffing the feet with cow dung or 
any filthy, irritating foot dressing; and, I might say, it is far more prevalent 
in warm weather and warm climates. 

TREATMENT. — The most important step to take is the removal of the 
cause for until this is done you will fail to effect a cure no matter what 
remedies you may apply. Place the animal in a dry, clean stable ; remove the 
shoes and apply one part carbolic acid and twenty parts water; or, apply 
peroxide of hydrogen twice a day; or, apply coal-tar disinfectant, one part, 
and water, fifteen parts; or, put one ounce sulphate of zinc into one quart 
of water and apply; or, apply calomel. These remedies should be applied 
daily no matter which one you use. 
PEOPLE'S HOME REMEDIES FOR THRUSH.— 

1. Carbolic Acid. — Clean the foot well and pour one part carbolic acid 
and twenty parts water around the frog twice a day until cured. 

2. Lard, Tar and Blue Vitriol. — Use equal parts of warm lard, pulverized 
blue vitriol and pine tar. The foot should be well cleaned and the mixture 
applied once a day for a week and followed with applications of salt for an- 
other week. If not better at the end of the second week the mixture should 
be applied again as before. 

3. Turnip and Charcoal Poultice.— Pare away the diseased parts of the 
horn and for a day or two apply a poultice of boiled turnips to which has been 
added a handful of powdered charcoal and a few drops of carbolic acid. Then 



96 THE PEOPLE'S HOME STOCK BOOK. 

clean the parts and apply dry calomel and dress with oakum and apply s 
bandage. This will be found very effective in the cure of thrush. 

OVER-REACHING— FORGING.— Over-reaching is when a horse in 
traveling steps on the back part of the forefoot with the hind one. Forging 
is when a horse which travels much the same way strikes the bottom of the 
foot or shoe, causing an unpleasant noise. 

CAUSES. — Perhaps the most common cause is peculiar conformation, 
such as high hind quarters with lower fore quarters. This gives the animal 
a greater reach, seemingly, than if the hind quarters were lower. Besides, 
conformation accounts for peculiarity of action ; therefore, line trotters move 
the hind feet forward under the body instead of opening out wide and going 
clear and perhaps strike the forefeet. It is also the result of wearing too 
heavy shoes on the hind feet, thereby lengthening the animal's stride. It is 
also induced by light shoeing in front. 

SYMPTOMS. — Wounds or bruises on the back part of the forefeet 
should cause a suspicion of over-reaching and the condition of his hind toes 
and marks made on the bottom of the shoe, also a noise when traveling, are 
all indications of forging. 

REMEDY. — A majority of young colts over-reach and forge. This is no' 
a bad symptom. However, it very often only occurs while establishing the ani 
mal's gait. To remedy this ailment the action in the front feet should be in 
creased, while that of the hind feet should be retarded. Increase the weight q 
the fore shoes and allow slight rolling motion; behind they should b' 
shod very light, the toe of foot kept long and a toe calk used with but littlr 
or no heel. This prevents or rather retards quick action. Where there is k 
tendency to over-reach and grab the front shoe it should be made as short as 
possible. Also keep in mind the importance of keeping up the front heels and 
lowering the hind ones. 

INTERFERING— STRIKING FETLOCK JOINTS.— Neariy every 
colt when being broken to drive interferes more or less and a great many 
horses, because of faulty conformation, can hardly avoid interfering. A ma- 
jority of those that do strike the fetlock, shin or knee with the opposite foot 
interfere behind, which is not as serious as when they strike in front.' By 
watching horses closely I find that one-fourth of them strike when traveling 
and it is safe to say that a larger percentage of trottihg and pacing horses 
strike. Of course many of them do not strike hard enough to bruise or wound 
the leg. There are several reasons why so many horses interfere. Improper 
shoeing is one ; shoeing with too heavy shoes is another ; driving or working 
horses until they become tired and leg weary is another cause and driving 
horses on rough uneven footing causes most of them to strike. 

TREATMENT. — It is almost impossible to shoe some horses so they 
will not interfere. These are cases where the animal toes out much in front 
or has very narrow hips. However, the worst cases can be helped by proper 
shoeing. In some cases it is necessary to wear boots or pads to protect 
the shin. Shoe with light shoes instead of heavy ones; keep the foot level 
and add some weight to inside of shoe — but keep the foot level. If one kind 
of shoe fails to correct this trouble, have your shoer make a change and as 
a rule the horse shoer knows best how to correct this trouble. Therefore, 
I advise horse owners to listen to the shoer rather than to interfere with 
him. 



HORSE— DISEASES OF FETLOCK, ANKLE AND FOOT. 97 

PUMICED FOOT. — This disease is the result of an inflammation of the 
foot that has become chronic for want of proper care at the proper time. 
I have known neglected cases of founder to terminate in bad cases of pumiced 
foot. Whenever an effusion takes place in the foot it should be allowed to 
escape or else it may give rise to a disease of the foot such as I have men- 
tioned. 

SYMPTOMS.— By looking at the sole of the foot it will be found con- 
vex instead of concave as it should be. The bone of the foot drops and the 
horse travels much like a foundered horse. 

TREATMENT. — I always apply a wide-webbed shoe with bar and pack 
the bottom of the foot so as to support the sole and by following up such 
cases it is astonishing how much each one can be helped even if not made 
entirely well. A horse in this condition should be used on the farm for 
slow work, but seldom driven on the road. In some cases treatment will 
prove quite unsatisfactory and it is better to destroy the horse. 

BREAK-DOWN— RUPTURE OF THE SUSPENSORY LIGA- 
MENT. — What is understood by a break-down is when a rupture of the sus- 
pensbry ligament takes place. This ligament is situated between the knee and 
fetlock and runs between the back tendons and shin bone. In race horses 
the forelegs are more likely to be aiifected, but in draft horses that are used 
for heavy pulling the hind legs generally suffer. 

SYMPTOMS. — When both branches of this ligament are torn loose the 
lameness comes on suddenly and the animal suffers gre^t pain; the fetlock 
descends and of course the toe turns up and the leg is swollen and very much 
inflamed. In mild cases there is scarcely any lowering of the fetlock and not 
nearly so much inflammation in the leg. 

TREATMENT. — When rupture of the ligament has taken place and the 
horse is unable to rest any weight on the injured limb, he should be placed in 
slings and either hot or cold water should be applied to subdue the inflamma- 
tion and very often it gives relief to apply an elastic bandage. The aim 
should be to get the leg back into its normal position as quickly as possible. 
Therefore, a high-heeled shoe and bandages to support the leg are helpful 
in the treatment of break-down. After the inflammation subsides use any 
good home liniment and later apply every week some cerate of cantharides 
to blister the parts mildly. Continue this until he travels sound. 

KNUCKLING— COCKED ANKLE.— When the fetlock joint tips for- 
ward it is termed knuckling or cocked ankle. The seat of trouble may not be 
in the ankle but in some other part of the leg. 

CAUSES. — Colts are sometimes born with this weakness, the fetlock 
being thrown forward and. the pastern being erect, making the colt some- 
what predisposed to knuckling. In older horses it is generally the result of 
a sprain of the ligaments of the fetlock or other ligaments or tendons of the 
leg. Fast driving and heavy pulling are both causes of knuckling. 

SYMPTOMS. — The fetlock joint is thrown forward too far and the joint 
rocks back when the animal moves but when standing still is cocked forward. 

TREATMENT — Colts, if they are well fed, recover without anything 
else being done. In older horses when it is the result of a sprain, give rest 
and shower with cold water in summer or apply hot water in winter. Apply 
any home liniment that you have found useful for sprains in man and good 
results will follow. Apply equal parts of turpentine, aqua ammonia and raw 

3-7

linseed oil once a day. If you believe it necessary to blister use cerate of 
cantharides, which every druggist can supply.* There are many liniments and 
blisters on the market which are equally good in the treatment of knuckling. 
It is important to keep the heel a little higher than the toe; this your shoer 
can do, but harm can be done if it is placed too high. 

NAVICULAR JOINT LAMENESS— COFFIN JOINT LAMENESS.— 
This is an affection of the joint within the foot. The synovial sac, ligaments, 
tendons or bone may be affected. 

CAUSES. — It is usually a disease of the lighter breeds of horses that 
are used for road or fast work. It also follows concussion or injuries to the 
foot from bad shoeing, and it may also arise from stone bruises and contrac- 
tion of the foot. It may also be a rheumatic ailment affecting this particular 
joint or it may follow derangement of the digestive organs caused by over- 
feeding of grain or allowing a fatigued horse to drink too much cold water. 
These are the common causes; however, there are many other caus^is which 
have a tendency to produce a diseased condition of the navicular or coffin 
joint. 

SYMPTOMS.^— The horse points the affected foot ten or twelve inches 
in advance of the other with the heel slightly elevated when standing quietly 
in the stable or- in harness after a drive. This pointing may have gone on 
three or four months before the animal shows lameness. The horse has a 
tendency to step short, stub the toe and stumble when first driven, but the 
lameness lessens and he may go sound after traveling a mile or two. How- 
ever, lameness soon returns. The toe of the shoe wears most; the foot 
feels hot, especially the back part, and it is sometimes swollen and bulging 
over quarters and the foot soon commences to contract. Pressing the thumb 
over the middle of the flexor tendons on either the inner or outer side as low 
down as it can be reached produces pain. Following chronic lameness, there 
is more or less atrophy of the limb, which is sornetimes mistaken for sweeny. 
Tapping the bottom of the foot with a hammer near the heel usually pro- 
duces pain. 

TREATMENT. — In a majority of chronic cases the treatment is unsatis- 
factory. However, in recent cases they may get well. First of all, subdue 
the inflammation with either cold or warm water or poultices and then apply 
a light blister. Some relief follows shortening the foot and slightly raising 
the heel. If occurring in the summer season a run on low land that is moist 
will always help a case of this kind, Frog setons are recommended by some 
veterinarians, but these should be inserted and the foot looked after by a 
veterinarian or bad results may follow. When all other remedies have failed 
to subdue the lameness and effect a cure, cutting the nerves and removing 
not less than one inch either above or below the fetlock always gives relief. 
However, certain cases should not be operated on. If the bone is diseased 
and if the feet are weak and flat the results are not satisfactory. All cases 
of navicular disease are helped by standing the horse in wet clay and by 
applying wet swabs while they are in the stable and, as a rule, repeated 
blisters applied to the coronet do good, but bear in mind that a majority of 
cases never get well. I have known many cases of coffin joint lameness in 
the early stages to be relieved by turning the horse into low wet pastures and 
using him on soft footing instead of on hard roads. 

FOUNDER— LAMENITIS.—Lamenitis is an inflammation of the whole 



HORSE— DISEASES OF FETLOCK, ANKLE AND FOOT. 99 

of the sensitive structure of the foot and it occurs in the acute, .sub-acute 
and chronic forms. 

CAUSES. — It is safe to say that some horses are predisposed to lament 
itis, for I have I<nown many horses with large bodies, light legs and weak 
flat feet to suffer from founder without any person being able to assign any 
exciting cause f,or their trouble. The horse that suffers most pain from lamen- 
itis is the one with deep round feet. Hard and fast work often causes founder. 
High steppers are more likely to have lamenitis than if they traveled low. 
Improper shoeing and feeding too much grain are causes and it sometimes 
follows parturition. Drinking too much cold water when in a heated condi- 
tion is also a cause, and there are many other causes which produce founder 
in horses. 

SYMPTOMS. — In the acute form of founder (lamenitis) there is always 
great pain. The animal usually has a chill before the temperature goes up, 
the pulse is generally full and somewhat quickened and the bowels are 
generally costive and the urine highly colored. If all feet are affected the 
animal keeps his feet well under him, but if the two forefeet only are affected 
he extends them somewhat in front of the body. When required to move 
he goes on his heels. 

TREATMENT.— In the first state there is very little stiffness but very 
soon the temperature of the body goes up and a general stiffness sets in which 
is qviite noticeable. The forefeet should be placed in either hot or cold water 
and I have obtained the best results from hot water in winter and cold in 
summer. However, cold water is most easily applied and generally produces 
good results. Standing the animal in wet clay is fully as good as either hot 
or cold water. Standing on soft footing gives relief. Give aconite in twenty- 
drop doses four times a day if he is feverish ; also give a tablespoonful of 
powdered saltpeter in drinking water twice a day. Keep the bowels open 
by giving one pound of epsom salts daily, until they open ; or, give one pint 
raw linseed oil daily until the bowels loosen; or, a dose of Barbadoes aloes 
and calomel will open them. Walk him on soft ground. 
PEOPLE'S HOME REMEDIES FOR FOUNDER.— 

1. Linseed Oil and Foot Bath. — Stand the front feet in a tub of hot 
water. Give a pint of linseed oil and repeat the dose in 10 hours if it has not 
caused a movement of the bowels. Give the horse walking exercise. 

2. Saltpeter. — Take the animal as soon as known to have been found- 
ered and give a rounding teaspoonful of pulverized saltpeter. Repeat this 
dose in ten hours and follow with one-half pound of salts. 

3. Oil of Sassafras. — When you first discover that the animal has been 
foundered give a tablespoonful of oil of sassafras; in six hours repeat this 
dose and follow with half a pound of salts. In all cases of founder short 
walks are a help rather than a hindrance to a complete recovery. We are 
indebted to a Granger living in Pullman, Washington, for this recipe. 

CHRONIC FOUNDER— CHRONIC LAMENITIS— CONVEX SOLES 
—^Chronic lamenitis and convex soles are generally the result of neglected or 
bad cases of founder that have made a poor recovery. Whenever a sub-acute 
inflammation of the feet occurs and lasts for any great I'^^'^th of time the 
hoofs change in shape and the wall becomes covered with rings and if any 
great effusion takes place in the foot the sole may drop, giving it a convex 
shape. 



100 THE PEOPLE'S HOME STOCK BOOK. 

TREATMENT. — A complete recovery in chronic cases of this kind 
should not always be looked for or you will be disappointed. When rings 
have formed on the hoof and the sole has dropped low the case can be helped 
by putting on a wide webbed shoe, packing the sole with tar and oakum 
and applying light blisters to the coronet once a week. You can use cerate 
of cantharides or any good home blister that is not too severe. A horse that 
has chronic founder should be driven on soft footing, allowed to go slow and 
his forefeet given good care. He should be well shod and his shoes changed 
every 4 to 6 weeks. 

PEOPLE'S HOME REMEDIES FOR HOOF-BOUND AND CON- 
TRACTED HEELS.— 

1. Hoof Ointment. — Apply one part coal tar disinfectant and six parts 
vaseline once a day. This is for cracks in the hoof and is also good to aid 
in growing a new hoof. 

2. Tar, Tallow and Beeswax. — Melt together one pound' of archangel 
tar, one-half pound of tallow and four ounces of beeswax. Apply twice a day. 

3. Hoof-Bound. — Take 4 ounces of pine tar, 3 ounces of olive oil, and 2 
ounces each of burgundy pitch, Venice turpentine, rosin and beeswax ; dissolve 
these and add 2 ounces of spirits of turpentine. Rub well into the hoof once 
a day for a week or ten days. 

4. Hoof-Bound and Contracted Heels. — Besides applying a good hoof 
ointment it is well to apply poultices of boiled turnips or linseed meal. This 
is more in the way of preventive treatment. 



VARIOUS DISEASES. 

(Including Inflammations, Influenza, Pink-Eye, Epizootic, Strangles or 
Distemper, Glanders, Bad Blood, Etc.) 



INFLAMMATION. — This term is usually applied where there is in- 
creased heat with some redness, pain and swelling. The heat is a result of 
an increased circulation of blood to the part and no doubt there is a somewhat 
changed conditipn of the blood. The redness, however, depends upon the 
quality of blood and sometimes the parts may be dark if the blood is coming 
from an open vein and a much brighter red if the blood is leaking from an 
open artery. The swelling of a part does not always produce much pain, un- 
less the pressure applies to a part of the body liberally supplied with nerves. 
Pain is very often a well-marked symptom of inflammation as, for instance, 
in founder. The results of inflammation are numerous. The inflamed parts 
can often be restored to their normal condition by the use of hot water, or 
sometimes cold applications. I have found cold applications very satisfactory 
in hot weather, while hot applications act best during the winter months. 
When an inflammation of a part goes on for some time there is an exudation 
which may solidify, then hot applications or an absorbent should be applied 
to break up the mass. We also find adhesive inflammations following too 
much exercise, resulting in a permanent thickening of the inflamed parts. 
We also sometimes find inflammation going on until suppuration takes' place. 
Finally the abscess bursts and relief comes. As a rule heat hastens this forma- 
tion of pus ; besides, stimulating liniments and light blisters or poultices have 
the same efYect. We also find inflammation terminating in gangrene (morti- 
fication). When this condition exists in a vital organ it is often fatal. How-, 
ever, it may occur in the lungs or bowels and a recovery take place. Of 
course when recovery takes place this gangrenous part must slough off. It 
is well to keep in mind in treating an inflamed part that the cause should be 
ascertained and removed if possible. As a rule the quieter an inflamed part 
is kept the quicker a recovery will take place. It is often well to give medi- 
cine internally as well as to apply it in the treatment of inflammatory troubles. 
At one time " blood letting " was practiced to reduce inflammation ; however, 
it is seldom done now by the best veterinarians. There are cases where it 
proves beneficial, but I find it is often done for a fee by those who do the 
work, not knowing or believing that it will do the horse any good. Hot or 
cold water is the best and least expensive local application to reduce in- 
flammation. Mild stimulating liniments such as are kept in the home are 
also very useful in reducing inflammation. Aconite, acetanilide or opium will 
reduce fever and nearly all the saline remedies, such as nitrate, chlorate and 
carbonate of potassium have a cooling eflfect. It is also a good plan to move 
the bowels and feed very little grain. Also, feed some vegetables or grass and 
allow the animal to drink all the cold water he craves, but not too much of 
it at a time. 

CHILLS. — Chills are usually the result of drinking too much spring 

101 



103 THE PEOPLE'S HOME STOCK BOOK. 

water or ice cold water and allowing the animal to remain quiet afterwards ; or, 
a chill may be one of the first symptoms noticed in the commencement of a 
variety of internal disorders, the result of infection and the commencemeiit of 
many fevers. 

SYMPTOMS. — There is loss of appetite, shivering, quick breathing and 
quick pulse soon followed by a rise of temperature. Of course this is not a 
disease but only a symptom preceding other ailments. 

TREATMENT. — Clothe the animal well, hand rub the legs and bandage 
over with cotton. Give any of the alcoholic liquors and not less than one-half 
pint in twice the quantity of cold water and repeat in two hours. Or, give 
one ounce sweet spirits nitre, one dram tincture nux vomica, four ounces 
whiskey and a tablespoonful or two of ginger in one quart of water as a 
drench, every three hours until the surface of the body becomes warm. After 
the chill is over it is best to give tincture of aconite in 15-drop doses every 
two hours to reduce the fever. Avoid subjecting the animal to exposure. 

INFLUENZA— PINK-EYE— EPIZOOTIC— LA GRIPPE.— This is a 
specific, infectious, and contagious fever in horses and mules and after having 
one attack the animal is usually immune for two years or more. This disease 
is not by any means a fatal one if the sick animal receives fairly good care 
and is not exhausted by work or exposed to cold storms when sick. 

CAUSES. — Nearly all cases appear to come from direct infection, the 
germs being carried through the air a considerable distance. An animal asso- 
ciating with another that has it and especially if kept in a small or badly ven- 
tilated stable is pretty likely to contract the disease. The disiease sometimes 
prevails as an epidemic; at other seasons it is endemic. For some reason 
the disease appeared in 1873 and 1878 as an epizootic and swept over the 
United States and Canada. Since then it has not been nearly so prevalent. 

SYMPTOMS. — One of the first symptoms noticed is a refusal of the 
animal to eat grain. This is on account of a high fever and it is not unusual 
to have the temperature reach from six to eight degrees above normal. The 
animal is dull, stands with head low, is very dumpish and acts as though 
sufTering pain. He has chilly spells, the coat becomes dry and staring, the 
ears hang and the animal is indififerent about moving. The eyes are some- 
times swollen and almost entirely closed, in some cases with tears dropping 
over the cheeks. The pulse ranges from sixty to one hundred beats per 
minute and the respirations are also quickened, the animal breathing from 
twenty to thirty times a minute. The animal always shows great muscular 
weakness and if required to move can scarcely walk. There seems to be a 
total loss of appetite for grain or stimulating food, but a disposition to eat 
hay and sometimes vegetables and generally there is a great thirst. Follow- 
ing high fever there is usually some stocking about the fetlocks, in sheath, and 
under belly and sometimes to an enormous extent. For the first three or 
four days the bowels are inclined to be costive. This is doubtless on account 
of the feverish condition of the body. Influenza, on account of its being 
attended with such high fever, may result in death from either lung or heart 
complications or brain congestion. As influenza is a specific epizootic fever 
of a low type, sometimes associated with inflammation of the respiratory 
organs and always causing an inflammation of the mucous membrane of these 
organs, it is absolutely necessary to give animals suffering with it good care 
and proper nursing. This ailment affects animals very much like La Grippe 



HORSE— VARIOUS DISEASES. 103 

affects man ; therefore, the same line of treatment that is followed in human 
practice always proves beneficial to animals. 

TREATMENT.— As costiveness always prevails in the early stages of 
this sickness it should be overcome by injections of warm water or by giving 
one-quarter or one-third of a full dose of raw linseed oil to move the bowels 
gently, but active cathartics must be avoided for if given they generally 
produce great harm. Experience tells me that animals which are forced to 
breathe bad air during the night and greater part of the day are more likely 
to take this disease. It would seem as though fresh air and comfortable 
clothing were an important and inexpensive remedy. Nobody will deny 
that influenza is a contagious disease ; therefore, it is important to separate 
the sick from the well ones as soon as the first symptoms of the disease 
show, for by doing so its spreading may be prevented. Medical remedies 
given should support the system and assist nature to throw off the disease. 
Give two or three drams of chlorate of potash in drinking water three or 
four times a day; or, give a teaspoonful of powdered saltpeter at a dose in 
drinking water three or four times a day. Give the animal plenty of cold water 
and remember that chlorate of potash is one of the best remedies for influenza. 
In sofee cases baking soda given in water three times a day, a tablespoonful 
at a dose, has a good effect. When a stimulant is required give liq. acetate 
ammonia, two or three ounces at a dose, every three or four hours; or, give 
alcohol, whiskey or wine. In some cases give whiskey, eggs, and milk as a 
nutritious stimulant. If the throat is sore apply antiphlogistine or apply 
equal parts of turpentine, aqua ammonia and sweet oil lightly once a day. If 
the lungs are affected apply light applications of mustard and water or hot 
packs. Benefit may follow steaming the throat. In the convalescent stage 
give tonics, such as sulphate of iron, quinine, gentian, cinchona, quassia or 
cod liver oil and don't forget to groom the animal twice a day. In conclusion 
let me say that I have always found the treatment of influenza very satisfac- 
tory if taken in time, but if old horses are affected remember that their re- 
covery will be much slower and not as satisfactory as in young animals. 

STRANGLES OR DISTEMPER.— Strangles is an acute infectious and 
contagious febrile disease peculiar to the horse, mule and ass and is character- 
ized usually by an abscess forming in some part of the body, but 'generally 
in the throat. This disease is most common in young horses. However, old 
horses sometimes have distemper. It is seldom that a horse has more than 
one attack. This ailment requires six or eight days to develop. Strange to 
say, when young horses are moved from one locality to another they are 
almost sure to become infected. 

CAUSES. — Distemper is due to an organism, a streptococcus, making this 
a contagious disease. Very few public stables are free from distemper infec- 
tion. However, this is not by any means a fatal illness. 

SYMPTOMS. — The animal first appears dull and stupid, the eyes soon 
begin to water, the temperature begins to rise, the coat begins to get rough 
and there is generally a loss of appetite and some discharge from the nostrils. 
The throat usually swells and an abscess begins to form under the lower jaw, 
unless it is a case of irregular strangles ; then an abscess may form in any 
other part of the body, making the case much more serious and difficult to 
treat successfully. 

TREATMENT. — The treatment of strangles, as it generally occurs, is 
not difficult. Place the animal in a comfortable, clean, well-ventilated stable 



104 THE PEOPLE'S HOME STOCK BOOK. 

in winter time, or turn him out to pasture in the summer. Fresh air and good 
care have much to do with bringing about a recovery. Poultice the throat or 
apply equal parts of turpentine, aqua ammonia and sweet oil to the swollen 
glands daily. Hot fomentations induce suppuratioii ; so do all stimulating 
liniments. When the abscess softens it should be opened with a dull knife 
and near the lower part to allow proper drainage. Inject a little peroxide of 
hydrogen twice a day; ten minutes later inject one part of carbolic acid and 
thirty parts water; or one part coal tar disinfectant and twenty parts water; 
or any other good home healing remedy and the abscess will soon heal. If 
the animal has much fever give twenty drops of tincture of aconite five times 
a day. Feed a cooling laxative diet instead of much grain. 
PEOPLE'S HOME REMEDIES.— For Strangles or Distemper.— 

1. Steaming. — Fill a bucket with hay , and bran and mix in some tar ; 
over this pour hot water and steam the horses head with the vapor which 
arises. Belladonna leaves may be used in place of the tar if desired. This 
relieves the inflammation of the mucous membranes and eases the cough. 

2. Gentian, Resin, Ginger and Baking Soda. — To half a pound of ground 
gentian add a pound each of resin, ginger and baking soda. Each should be 
powdered and the whole well mixed. The dose is a tablespoonful three-times 
a day in feed, or given with a spoon. 

3. Salts, Soda or Nitre. — Do not expose the horse to cold rainstorms and 
if there is much fever give one-half teacupful of Glauber's salts twice a day. 
Also give a tablespoonful of baking soda and a teaspoonful of nitre twice a 
day. 

4. Turpentine, Camphor, Olive Oil and Ammonia. — To 4 ounces of olive 
oil add one ounce each of spirits of turpentine and spirits of camphor and one 
and a half ounces of aqua ammonia. Rub the throat with this liniment once 
a day. If the throat is swollen badly the application of a hot poultice of oil 
meal will give relief. It is also well to keep the bowels open with either raw 
linseed oil or salts. 

5. Distemper in Colts. — Give from 4 to 6 ounces of epsom salts. Give 
warm bran mashes or linseed or oatmeal gruel. The colt should be kept 
warm and if the legs seem cold they should be rubbed with cloths dipped 
in hot mustard water. 

6. Tobacco Tea. — To a quart of water add an ounce of tobacco and boil 
to make a tea. Bathe the throat with this tea as hot as it can be borne. 

7. Saltpeter, Etc. — Mix equal parts of saltpeter and chlorate of potash 
and give a teaspoonfijl on the tongue two or three times a day, or dissolve 
in water and let him drink it. At the beginning the hair should be clipped 
from the throat and twice a day a mixture of white wine vinegar and Spanish 
flies should be applied. Use one-fourth ounce of powdered Spanish flies to 
a quart of the vinegar. Keep this mixture in a warm place. 

8. Mustard and Pepper. — Mix equal parts of mustard and cayenne pepper 
with enough water to make a thin paste and apply to the throat and under 
part of neck and chest. When the abscess softens it should be opened. 

SHIPPING FEVER.— The term " shipping fever " is a common expres- 
sion of horse dealers and means either influenza, strangles, catarrhal fever or 
sore throat. For further information the reader is referred to these subjects. 

LYMPHANGITIS— WATER FARCY— WEED— BIG LEG— MON- 
DAY MORNING DISEASE,— These ailments are all the same disease, but 
are known by different names. It consists in an inflammation of the lym- 



HORSE— VARIOUS DISEASES. 105 

phatic glands and vessels, usually affecting the extremities of the horse and 
generally one leg only, which becomes enlarged. The heaviest breeds of 
horse's are predisposed to lymphangitis much more than the lighter breeds 
and it generally affects good feeders. 

CAUSES. — As I have stated, the heavy, fleshy horse is the most likely to 
become affected. However, the disease may occur in the light thoroughbred 
horse. A common cause is resting a hard working animal for a few days 
and feeding him as much or more grain than he would have been given had 
he been working. When a horse rests, especially if he is a draft horse, his 
grain supply should be reduced one-half or more, his bowels should be kept 
open and his stable well ventilated. Another cause is an injury, either mak- 
ing a wound or bruising the lymphatic glands. It also follows debilitating 
diseases but it usually follows high feeding and no exercise. 

SYMPTOMS. — The disease sets in with rigors which are sometimes 
-severe, the animal trembling violently. The mouth is hot, breathing is quidk, 
temperature goes up, the horse soon becomes lame and in some cases the 
animal lies down and is unable to get up without assistance. The symptoms 
of lymphangitis are all very plain and should be readily recognized by any 
one who understands horses. 

TREATMENT. — The treatment of lymphangitis should- be energetic but 
careful and, although this treatment is not popular nowadays, I have obtained 
good results from blood-letting and giving a full dose of cathartic medicine, 
such as aloes, from five to eight drams, with thirty grains of calomel in two 
drams of ginger and made into a bolus and given at one dose. Or, give one 
quart of raw linseed oil. Give one-half ounce doses of powdered saltpeter 
night and morning or give one-half ounce of citrate of potash twice daily. Fo- 
ment leg with hot water, do not feed grain, gently hand rub the leg and soon 
give walking exercise. Never apply hot, irritating liniments or blisters ; use 
hot water. 
PEOPLE'S HOME REMEDIES FOR WATER FARCY.— 

1. For Farcy Caused by Indigestion and Run Down Condition. — Mix 3 
ounces each of saltpeter, sulphur, anise seed and cream of tartar. Divide into 
12 powders and give in soft feed for 12 consecutive meals. 

3. Oxide of Zinc. — Apply zinc ointment which is made by adding a dram 
of oxide of zinc to an ounce of vaseline. 

3. Sugar of Lead. — Bathe the parts freely with a solution of one ounce of 
sugar of lead to a quart of water. Keep the bowels open. 

GOITRE— BRONCHOCELE— ENLARGEMENT OF THE THY- 
ROID GLAND. — This is an enlargement of the thyroid gland situated on each 
side of the neck about 6 or 7 inches from the angle of the lower jaw. Al- 
though this is one of the oldest diseases known it is by no means well under- 
stood. It is epidemic in all mountainous districts the world over and is very 
prevalent in a belt of country extending from Quebec, Canada, to Duluth, 
Minnesota. It is also very prevalent in Michigan and certain other parts of 
the United States. 

TREATMENT. — Iodine seems to be a specific for this ailment and may 
be applied externally or given inwardly. I have obtained good results by 
injecting some iodine into the gland or by applying iodine ointment or tinc- 
ture of iodine to the gland daily or by giving dram doses of iodide of potas- 
sium or even larger doses twice a day until the gland reduces. In obstinate 
cases increase the dose or apply red iodide of mercury, one part; iodine, one 



106 THE PEOPLE'S HOME STOCK BOOK. 

part and lard, eight parts. There are also other remedies which have given 
me fairly good results. 

WEAKNESS IN LEGS OF FOALS.— This is a very common ailment 
of foals and is no doubt the result of their mothers having had improper care 
or having been over worked and not fed sufficient nutritious food or having 
stood still without exercise in a foul, badly ventilated stable. Or, she may 
have been supplied with altogether too much nutritious fat-producing food 
without enough exercise. I find mares that are fed on an unbalanced ration and 
that are kept in badly ventilated barns are inclined to have weak colts. Be- 
sides, mares that are not exercised enough up to foaling time grow weak 
themselves and are quite likely to have weak foals. Another very common 
cause of weakness in foals is want of proper nourishment after they are born ; 
also, neglecting the treatment of navels and allowing them to become in- 
fected, thus causing fever and considerable weakness. This, of course, shows 
in the body, but perhaps not so much so to the casual observer as the weak- 
ness in the legs, which everybody can see plainly. 

TREATMENT. — Colts should be kept warm when they are born, dried 
promptly, either by care from the mother or by clothing or rubbing them 
with soft towels and you should never let a colt or any young animal chill. 
The navel of every colt should be treated for safety. Apply any good healing 
remedy such as one part carbolic acid and fifty parts water, one part bi-chlor- 
ide mercury and 1,000 parts water, or dust on some boric acid powder or 
apply peroxide of hydrogen, then apply iodoform or some coal-tar disinfectant, 
one part to twenty of water, and continue applying remedies until the navel 
dries and heals perfectly. The udder of a mare should be washed clean and 
if soap and water are used all the soap should be washed ofif with warm water 
before the colt is allowed to suck. If her first milk does not prove laxative 
use a little glycerine, sweet oil or soap to lubricate the inside of the rectum. 
Proper food supply and good care are what they need — not liniments. 

TUMORS. — Tumors are unnatural enlargements situated in different 
parts of the body and they very often differ in their nature and structure. 
The tendency of some are to continue growing while others reach a certain 
point of development, then cease to grow. The removal of tumors should be 
done in one of two ways — either by a surgical operation, or by applying iodine 
or giving different preparations of iodine internally, thus causing their ab- 
sorption. Apply either tincture of iodine or iodine ointment. Give iodide of 
potassium or syrup of iodide of iron daily, until the bunch is reduced. 

RICKETS. — Rickets occur in all lower animals but perhaps the puppy 
is the most often affected. This disease is generally brought on by feeding 
an unbalanced ration. 

CAUSES. — The colts from sires that have been over taxed seem to be 
more susceptible to rickets than any others. Weaning young animals too 
soon, feeding food which is unlike milk in nutritive properties and forcing 
quite young animal's to live on food such as old ones eat, are common causes 
of rickets. The young animals cannot digest food that older ones do; conse- 
quently, they are weak and the bones may bend. 

SYMPTOMS. — The bones bend on account of their containing too much 
animal and not enough earthy matter. There is generally considerable weak- 
ness. This accounts for much of the unsoundness of young stpck. 

TREATMENT.— In the treatment of rickets the cause should be found 
and removed if possible. If the animal is still sucking, then its mother is at 



HORSE— VARIOUS DISEASES. 107 

fault and by changing her feed the colt will soon get better. Feed the mother 
a balanced ration, keep her in good health and never wean young animals 
until they have learned to eat and, when weaned, feed them a mixed diet with 
some milk. Lime is usually the best remedy and if the bowels are too costive 
give either sweet oil, castor oil or raw linseed oil. The weak legs should be 
supported with bandages and, sometimes, splints. I have obtained good 
results by giving cod liver oil and syrup of phosphates. However, the most 
important thing to study is the food supply. When the animal is weak, keep 
it on smooth footing. ■ 

OSTEO-POROSIS— BIG HEAD.— This is a disease that usually attacks 
colts before they are four years old. However, it does affect older horses. It 
generally develops without showing much soreness. The bones of the head 
are the most likely to become affected. 

CAUSES. — While the cause is not well understood, the disease seems 
to appear when colts run on pasture lands which are deficient in the salts or 
lime and when stock run on low swamp lands and eat grass whi'^h grows in 
the shade and lacks nutritive qualities. 

SYMPTOMS. — Without any warning the bones of the head commence 
to enlarge and grow soft and if the bones of other parts of the body become 
affected the ligaments or muscles may lose their attachment and pull off. In 
many cases the colt shows lameness which is generally diagnosed as rheu- 
matism. However, if a careful examination had been made the real cause 
would have been learned. 

TREATMENT. — There must be sorne fault in the assimilation of food 
or the quality of food furnished the animal ; or, it may depend on the kind of 
place in which the animals are stabled. Basements that are damp and dark 
seem to favor its development. The best results follow good care, proper 
feeding, good grooming, giving plenty of vegetables or pasturing on high 
ground. Give tonics such as iron, cinchona, gentian, fenugreek, nux vomica, 
cod liver oil and phosphate of iron. No treatment will help advanced cases. 
External applications never do any good unless they are applied very early. 

GLANDERS, OR FARCY.— Glanders is a malignant disease of an infec- 
tious and contagious character and is caused by tlie spread of a specific 
organism, the bacillus mallei. The lymphatic glands are generally affected 
and it usually affects the air passages. It is well to keep in mind that farcy 
is the same disease as glanders but is generally seen on the surface of the 
body. It is an incurable disease and a very loathsome one, affecting men as 
well as sheep, goats, dogs, cats, mice and rats; but cattle never take it. The 
disease has existed two thousand years or more. A remedy has never been 
found that seems to cure it. However, we are pleased to know that it is not 
nearly so prevalent as it was many years ago. 

CAUSES. — Some of our ancient writers claim the disease can have a 
spontaneous origin, but this is nonsense for there is only one cause and that 
is the presence of the germ, bacillus mallei. I have met with many a case of 
genuine glanders where I was unable to trace the contagion but the animal 
must have become inoculated with the virus. Any animal in a weakened con- 
dition will contract the disease much more readily than if strong and well. 
Stabling too many horses in poorly ventilated stables helps spread it if a 
diseased one be amongst them. I have known a horse to work a year with a 
horse that had glanders and not become diseased, but remember that this is 
an exception. No matter in what way the virus enters the body it may infect 



108 THE PEOPLE'S HOME STOCK BOOK. 

another. An acute case is much more contagious than a chronic one. The 
period of incubation is from four to eight days but chronic glanders may- 
break out at any time within ten or twelve months. I have often found cases 
of glanders where gypsies have " swapped " horses and where horse traders 
have operated, shipping horses into the country from large cities. 

SYMPTOMS. — In chronic glanders there may be no clinical symptoms 
that will lead you to decide that the horse has glanders. However, if you 
are at all suspicious and know of his having been subjected to the contagion 
the " mallein " test should be applied for this will pretty correctly determine 
whether or not he has glanders. It can be safely said that glanders is the 
most insidious disease that the horse is heir to for he may have it for years 
and not show it, the virus remaining latent in the system ready to show itself 
under favorable conditions. The disease is usually ushered in with a chill, 
the temperature goes up and sometimes the disease assumes an acute form. 
Some time later a slight discharge comes from one nostril, perhaps more ofteh 
from the :-;~ht nostril than from the left. This discharge is rather greenish 
at first, soon changing to yellow. It is very often highly charged with al- 
bumen which accounts for its sinking readily in water. Sometimes the horse 
coughs ; his coat becomes dry ; the mucous membrane of the nose is covered 
with pimples which point, open and remain sore, healing slowly and always 
leaving a scar. The glands of the body are affected but more especially at 
the angle of the jaw and in many cases they seem to cling to the bone and 
have a peculiar feeling to the touch. The mallein test can always be depended 
upon for I have never known it to fail even in cases where post-mortem showed 
quite slight lesions. In cases of farcy it acts equally well. There is, as I 
have said before, no difference between glanders and farcy only in the manner 
in which the disease manifests itself, affecting different parts of the body. 

THE MALLEIN TEST. — Ascertain the normal temperature of the 
horse ; clean and disinfect a selected spot on the neck or shoulder ; then inject 
from 15 to 20 minims of mallein under the skin. Commence taking the tem- 
perature six hours later, taking it every two hours until the twentieth hour. 
If the temperature rises from two to six degrees above normal, then you may 
safely decide that the horse has glanders. The normal tempsrature is one 
hundred and one-fifth degrees, Fahrenheit. 

TREATMENT.— There is no remedy for glanders. 

POST-MORTEM. — We find ulcers in the nose generally high up and the 
bones may be diseased with the septum nasi, or wall between the nostrils, 
almost gone. Sometimes there are ulcers in the throat and windpipe 
and shiny nodules in the lungs. Just a word of caution : working around a 
glandered horse is dangerous; cutting up one that died or was killed because 
he had glanders is dangerous work. Therefore, you are warned to be very 
careful if you have sores on the hands. The body of the horse should be 
)>urned or buried under the ground to prevent contagion. The stable should 
be thoroughly disinfected. 

RHEUMATISM— SHIFTING LAMENESS.— Rheumatism is a disease 
which affects both the muscles and joints of the body and very often shifts 
from one part to another. 

CAUSE. — Rheumatism of the muscles is generally the result of exposure 
when in an exhausted or heated condition, while rheumatism of the joints is 
due to some micro-organism in the blood, which is deposited in or around the 
joints. Certain animals seem to inherit a predisposition to rheumatic ail- 



HORSE— VARIOUS DISEASES. 109 

ments. Disorders of the digestive or respiratory organs and the kidneys have 
no doubt something to do with the system's becoming loaded with abnormal 
and probably acid elements which may give rise to pain in the muscles, ten- 
dons, joints and bursa. Following many germ ailments it is not unusual to 
have the joints inflamed and the inflammation shift from one joint to another. 

SYMPTOMS. — A shifting lameness passing from one joint to another 
indicates a rheumatic ailment. The joints aflected are not always swollen. 
The animal is slightly feverish with a quick pulse and the affected parts very 
seldom suppurate. Sometimes, when the muscles are affected they contract, 
producing pain and causing the animal to travel with a peculiar gait. When 
the joints are affected the animal suffers considerable pain and shows great 
lameness, while if the muscles are affected it produces stiffness. 

TREATMENT. — The animal should be placed in a comfortable, dry 
stable that is well ventilated but warm, and the body should be clothed prop- 
erly. Give at one dose from five to eight drams of aloes, twenty grains of 
calomel and two drams of ginger, made into a bolus. This will open the 
bowels. Or, give eight or ten ounces of epsom salts or a pint or more of raw 
linseed oil- at a dose daily until the bowels move rather freely and feed well 
salted bran mashes or vegetables to keep the bowels open. Give one dram 
of iodide of potassium at a dose two or three times a day, or a tablespoonful 
of powdered saltpeter two or three times a day, or a tablespoonful of salicy- 
late of soda at a dose two or three times a day. Or, give one dram of pow- 
dered colchium, or fluid extract will do, and one dram salicylic acid or three 
drams of powdered nitrate of potash at a dose three times a day. Apply 
mustard anc' water or some good home liniment to inflamed muscles or joints 
twice a day. 

RHEUMATISM IN COLTS— LEAKING OF THE NAVEL- 
SWOLLEN JOINTS — The navel of a young colt should never be allowed 
to leak after birth and should always be treated for fear of germs entering 
the body through this channel, bringing on rheumatism and' swollen joints. 
When the navel leaks blood apply Monsell's solution of iron or adrenalin or 
tie the cord with silk or take a stitch around the leaking blood vessel. If it 
leaks water, apply astringents such as powdered alum, one ounce, and sugar of 
lead, one ounce, dissolved in a pint of water. Apply this solution to navel 
three or four times a day, also dust on equal parts of iodoform, boric acid, 
powdered alum and tannic acid ; or, apply one part coal tar disinfectant and 
fifteen parts water or one part coal tar disinfectant and four parts vaseline. 
When the joints of a colt only swell do not apply blisters nor open them, for 
if you do it will generally result in death or the colt will be ruined. Apply 
equal parts of extract of witch hazel, alcohol and water. Take good care of 
the mare, feed her properly, keep her udder clean and continue treating the 
navel of the colt. Also avoid tight bandages, for when applied to the tender 
legs of a colt, especially in hot weather, they are likely to do harm. Kindly 
understand the importance of not interfering too much with nature for young 
colts usually outgrow ailments of this kind. When pus forms in the joint 
as it sometimes does, open and allow proper drainage and apply weak anti- 
septic healing remedies, protecting the parts from filth and flies. 

IMPURE BLOOD — BAD BLOOD. — This is an abnormal condition of 
the blood brought on by a variety of causes such as would result from expo- 
sure and a limited supply of poor food or badly cured fodder or by feeding 
too much nutritious food without the animal's having sufficient fresh air and 



110 THE PEOPLE'S HOME STOCK BOOK. 

exercise ; besides, it often occurs when animals are kept in damp, filthy, base- 
ment stables and are not kept clean. 

SYMPTOMS. — An unthrifty condition; rough coat; scaly condition of 
the skin, very often with pimples; stocking of the legs and dullness of the 
animal with weakness are the general symptoms of bad blood. However, 
highly fed horses with skin eruptions may have impure blood. 

TREATMENT. — If the horse is very fat, give a purgative of aloes or 
epsom salts or raw linseed oil and cut down his food supply. Give a tea- 
spoonful of powdered saltpeter, two tablespoonfuls of baking soda and two 
tablespoonfuls of powdered wood charcoal at a dose in feed two or three 
times a day. If occurring in the summer, turn the horse to grass but if occur- 
ring in the winter; salt him well, give mixed hay, well cured corn fodder and 
also plenty of grain and vegetables. It is also important to groom him well 
and give him daily exercise. Nearly all animals that suffer from febrile 
diseases are likely to have impure blood. The treatment I have prescribed 
for chronic indigestion will help cases of this kind.

Anatomy of Cattle, General Symptoms of Disease, Action of Drugs, How 

To Give Medicine, Etc. 



ANATOMY OF CATTLE.— The bones and joints of the ox are known 
by the same names as those of the horse ; however, there is some difference in 
their skeletons. The ox has only thirteen pairs of ribs while the horse has 
eighteen pairs. The horse has a rounder breast bone than the ox. The ribs 
of the ox are united to the breast bone by joints while the horse's ribs are 
united by cartilage. Because of the difference in the construction of the 
chest the horse has more breathing space when standing up and the cow 
when lying down. This is why the horse- stands up and the cow lies down 
when suffering from pneumonia or other lung diseases. The head of the horse 
is narrower, especially the upper part. The skull of the ox has two bony 
projections, one on each side, which extend into the horns and are hollow. 
The ox has two small cardiac bones, (heart bones) and the horse has none. 
The ox has a divided foot while the horse has not and of course the bones 
are different. 
THE DIGESTIVE ORGANS.— 

THE UPPER LIP of the ox is thick and hairless and when the animal 
is healthy and free from fever., the smooth part should be moist. 

THE CHEEKS on the inside are covered with numerous little tufts 
which give them a rather peculiar appearance. 

THE TONGUE of the ox is rough on its upper surface and thicker at its 
base than that of the horse. It is used to pull food into the mouth. 

THE SALIVARY GLANDS are not unlike those of the horse and of 
course perform the same function. 

THE TEETH of the ox and horse differ very much. The ox has no front 
teeth in the upper jaw, their place being filled by a pad of hard tissue. The 
lower row of teeth, when grazing, press against this pad, therefore it serves 
almost the same purpose as the teeth would ; however, it is a mistake to be- 
lieve that cattle can thrive on as short pasture afe horses or sheep. There are 
eight teeth in the lower jaw and the molars (grinders) are similar to those of 
the horse but smaller and rougher on their surfaces. The ox has thirty-two 
teeth, eight in front and twenty-four back. 

THE SOFT PALATE.— In the ox this is small and does not close the 
opening from the mouth to the pharynx and in this respect it diffefs from the 
same organ in the horse. 

THE PHARYNX AND GULLET.— In the ox the pharynx is consider- 
ably larger than in the horse. The oesophagus or gullet, which conveys the 
food to the stomach, is unusually well developed. The fibers in the gullet have 
a sort of double action and when the animal is eating it carries the food from 
the mouth to the stomach but when the animal is chewing the cud (rumin- 
ating) the fibres act in the opposite way and the gullet then conveys the food 
from the stomach to the mouth and of course returns it to the stomach 
when masticated.

CATTLE— ANATOMY, ETC. 113 

THE STOMACH. — The stomach of the ox is a very important organ 
and has a capacity of from 50 to 65 gallons and has four compartments. The 
first is called the rumen or paunch; the second is called the reticulum and 
presents a honey-comb appearance; the third is called the omasum or many- 
plies ; and the fourth is called the true stomach or abomasum. The real pr&cess 
of digestion is carried on mostly in the fourth compartment; however, the 
first three play an important part in the preparation of the food for the fourth 
or true stomach. The rumen, or paunch, occupies about three-quarters of the 
belly cavity and is attached to the left side by ligaments and thus held in 
position. It is important for the reader to remember the position of the 
paunch for many times it is necessary to tap cattle for hoven (bloating). It 
should always be done on the left side and into the rumen. This compart- 
ment has two openings, one for the food to enter and the other for its exit: 
both of these openings are in the front side, the food passing from here into 
the reticulum. In this compartment the entrance is in front and the exit in 
the back part. The function of this organ is to help in the preparation of 
food for its return to the mouth for remastication. From the reticulum the 
food passes into the omasum, which is situated on the right side of the paunch. 
The food, passing from here, goes into the true stomach to be digested and 
from here the food passes along into the small intestines. 

THE INTESTINES OR BOWELS.— There are both large and small in- 
testines, being very similar in structure and action to those of the horse. 
When the food is passed into the small intestines it is acted on by the bile, 
which is secreted by the liver, and also by the pancreatic fluid that comes 
from the pancreas. These juices are emptied into the first part of the intes- 
tines through little tubes, much the same as in the horse. Throughout the 
bowels there aire situated in the coats small villi which pick up the nourish- 
ment and carry it to the blood, the balance of the food passing out in the 
form of manure. The bowels of the horse are smaller than those of the ox 
and shoi-ter, the ox having about 150 feet. The large bowels of the ox are 
very much smaller than those of the horse and are about 35 feet long. The 
bowels of the ox are muqh less liable to become diseased than those of the 
horse. 

THE LIVER AND GALL BLADDER.— The liver of the ox has a large 
gall bladder, much the shape of a pear, to store up gall when digestion is not 
going on ; but when digestion is going on the gall bladder contracts, forcing 
the bile into the intestines. 

THE PANCREAS. — The pancreas of the ox is very similar to that of 
the horse in appearance and its function is much the same. 

THE SPLEEN. — The spleen of the ox is oblong and attached to the 
paunch and is somewhat different in shape from that of the horse. 

THE RESPIRATORY ORGANS.— The respiratory organs of the ox 
are much the same as in the horse and are not nearly so liable to disease and, 
with the exception of tuberculosis affecting the lungs and throat of the ox 
his air passages do not as a rule give him much trouble if he has good care. 

THE URINARY ORGANS.— The kidneys of the ox are larger thai 
those of the horse and are not nearly so smooth. The bladder and passage for 
urine are much the same as in the horse but where the urethra opens into the 
vulva it is different, which makes it more difficult to draw off the water; a 
little depression at the opening causes the trouble. 

THE PULSE. — The normal number of heart beats is from forty-eight 
3—8 



114 THE PEOPLE'S HOME STOCK BOOK. 

to fifty-six per minute ; however, in calves and old animals the pulse is gen- 
erally faster. The most convenient place to take the pulse is on the under- 
border of the lower jaw and in health the beat is generally softer than it is 
in the horse. The artery should be dropped in gently between the first and 
second finger, but the thumb should not be used for fear of counting the 
pulsation in your own artery. 

THE RESPIRATION. — In health this will usually run from eleven to 
eighteen or twenty per minute and is easily counted by watching the nostrils, 
flanks, or the heaving of the chest. Considerable practice is required to do 
chest sounding; however, in health the passage of air through the air pass- 
ages should be smooth and uninterrupted, while in disease of the lungs or 
bronchial tubes the breathing is obstructed. 

THE TEMPERATURE. — The temperature in cattle is a great guide in 
ascertaining if they are in a normal condition and every dairyman should be 
equipped with a clinical thermometer which holds the registration until shook 
down. The thermometer is usually inserted in the rectum and left there two 
or three minutes. The normal temperature in cattle is considered to be 101 
degrees; however, I must place it at 101l^, for after taking the temperature 
of thousands of cattle that were perfectly healthy, their temperature registered 
nearer 101% degrees. The temperature of the horse when in perfect health is 
nearer IOOI/5 than any other point. Whenever the temperature goes much 
above the normal point the animal is considered feverish. 

GENERAL SYMPTOMS OF DISEASE.— A dry, harsh, staring coat is 
one of the leading symptoms of an animal's being out of condition or suffer- 
ing from disease. Also, if the animal shivers when not exposed to cold it is 
another symptom that should be regarded with fear. Whenever cattle break 
out in a cold sweat after having been ill for some time it is a bad symptom. 
The muzzle when not covered with moisture indicates fever. Another symp- 
tom of constitutional disturbance is the animal's ceasing to chew the cud and 
when this occurs in milch cows their milk supply usually falls off quickly. 
Whenever the bowels are inclined to be too costive or too loose and this 
condition continues for some time it always proves difficult to correct. A cough 
is usually a symptom of disease, especially if it becomes chronic, therefore an 
effort should be made to relieve it for, if neglected as it many times is, it 
usually runs on until it becomes incurable. 

ACTION OF DRUGS IN CATTLE.— It is well to keep in mind that 
certain remedies or drugs which act nicely in cattle are entirely unsuitable 
for horses, even if they are suffering from the same ailment. As a rule it is 
good practice to drench cattle slowly and dilute the drugs well, on account of 
the quantity of food in the stomach of cattle. By giving the drench slowly 
its chances are better for reaching the fourth stomach where it should go; 
besides, I have always found it good practice to give cattle larger doses than 
horses. Many times they require twice as much. The common purgative for 
cattle is epsom salts (sulphate magnesia) but never add much, if any, calomel 
for cattle are easily salivated; besides, the mercury is excreted through the 
milk and will affect calves or people who use it. Aloes is an excellent cathar- 
tic for horses but is not fit for cattle. Also, oils will purge cattle but their 
action is quite uncertain and better results are obtained by giving lard. 
Turpentine is less active when applied to cattle than to horses but mustard 
Appears to act with more certainty on cattle than when applied to horses, 



CATTLE— ANATOMY, ETC. 115 

Many of the drugs that are made from herbs do not affect cattle the same as 
they do horses. 

GIVING MEDICINE TO CATTLE.— Cattle are much more easily^ 
drenched than horses. Tie the animal short, stand to the left side, place the 
thumb and finger in the nostrils, put the nozzle of the bottle into the mouth 
and the medicine will run down into the stomach quickly, but of course the 
nose should be held high enough to form an incline for the liquid to run into 
the back portion of the mouth. Placing a ring in the nose and elevating it 
makes the work easier. A great many kinds of medicine can be given in the 
feed or water without the need of drenching. 



DISEASES OF THE DIGESTIVE ORGANS. 

(Including Bloat, Impaction, Indigestion, Scours, Dysentery, Constipation, 

Inflamniation of the Bowels, Cornstalk Disease, Worms, Rupture, 

Sore Mouth, Diseases of the Liver, Choking, etc.) 



BLOAT— HOVEN— TYMPANITIS.— This disease is characterized by 
the distention of the paunch or rumen and is the result of fermenting food, 
or it often follows choking. 

CAUSES. — Bloating very often follows choking and I have known it 
to come on very suddenly from this cause and to go down almost as quickly 
after the obstruction was removed. It also follows acute indigestion, espe- 
cially where thin hungry animals are turned into luxuriant pasture lots 
where they eat far too much wet clover or frozen vegetables to which they 
have not been accustomed. Some cattle bloat from eating alfalfa hay. 

SYMPTOMS. — The animal usually exhibits some pain, breathes quick 
and the abdomen is very much enlarged and the left flank more than 
the right. By tapping the end of the fingers on the left ilank a drum-like 
sound can be heard. The animal exhibits distress and shows it by expres- 
sion and generally moves about slowly. In bad cases you will find that when 
the flank is pressed in and the pressure taken off suddenly the parts fly back 
into place quickly. I have known cases of rupture of the stomach caused from 
the rapid formation of gas ; therefore, when the symptoms are at all alarming 
prompt measures should be taken to relieve the animal. 

TREATMENT. — In every severe case where the life of the animal is 
threatened tapping should be resorted to at once for there is but little dan- 
ger from this operation. In mild cases it is not always necessary to give 
any medicine, but in acute cases the treatment should be prompt. If the 
bloat is great and the left flank drum-like the gas should be liberated at once 
and this is best done by puncturing the paunch. Before puncturing, the 
left flank should be washed off with soap and water and then wet with one 
part carbolic acid and thirty parts water. Cut through the skin and push 
the trocar into the paunch in a downward direction, pulling out the, trocar 
and leaving the canula in for the gas to pass through. If you have no other 
suitable instrument use a common pointed knife, which answers very well and 
is not attended with much risk. When the case demands puncturing, open 
the flank about a hand-span from the last rib and lumbar vertebra and if a 
knife is used instead of a trocar and Canula use a quill or tube to allow the 
gas to pass through. If it becomes necessary to puncture the animal a second 
time you had better make a new opening. When a remedy would seemingly 
correct this trouble give one-half ounce salicylic acid in a pint of hot water 
and, if this gives no relief, in fifteen minutes give another dose, repeating 
the doses every fifteen minutes until relief is obtained. Or, give one ounce 
aromatic spirits of ammonia, one dram fluid extract caliber bean and three 
ounces hypo-sulphite of soda, in a pint of water ; and, if necessary, repeat the 
dose in thirty minutes. If you have neither of the above remedies give one 
ounce ginger, two ounces whiskey and one-half ounce of turpentine in a pint 

116 



CATTLE— DISEASES OF DIGESTIVE ORGANS. 117 

of sweet oil or raw linseed oil. In some cases relief will be obtained by keep- 
ing the mouth open with a block of wood. After puncturing cattle I always 
give them a full dose of epsom salts, which is from one to two pounds, 
with a tablespoonful or two of ginger in three or four pints of water. (See 
" Tapping the Paunch or Rumen.") 
PEOPLE'S HOME REMEDIES FOR BLOATING.— 

1. Tapping. — With a small-bladed knife tap the cow's paunch and in- 
sert a clean pipe stem or goose quill to allow the escape of the gas. The cow 
should be tapped where the bloating is most prominent which is generally 
in the triangle of the left flank, midway between the last rib and the point of 
the hip bone. 

2. Bitting. — lake a piece of broom handle six or eight inches long and 
use it in the mouth as a bit. This may be held in place by tying a cord to 
one end, bringing it up over the head back of the horns and then tying to the 
other end of the bit. This holds the mouth open and allows the gas to escape. 
If used in time this is an effective remedy. If they are too far gone, tapping 
the flank may be necessary. 

3. Camphor. — Drench the cow with two tablespoonfuls of camphor 
mixed with a pint of water and repeat in 30 minutes if necessary. 

4. Cold Water. — Fasten the cow securely and then continue to dash 
cold water on the back and sides for fifteen or twenty minutes. If not re- 
lieved, tapping will have to be resorted to. 

5. Ginger and Charcoal. — Add two ounces of powdered wood charcoal 
and two ounces of tincture of ginger to a quart of warm water and give as a 
drench. 

6. Charcoal. — Mix half a teacupful of powdered charcoal with a quart 
of warm water and give as a drench. Charcoal 'aids digestion and at the same 
time absorbs large quantities of gas, two things which are much to be desired 
in case of bloating. If you have no wood to make charcoal yourself, keep it 
on hand for it can be bought at any drug store and costs but little. 

TAPPING THE PAUNCH OR RUMEN.— This is an operation per- 
formed on cattle to relieve bloat when drugs fail to give relief. After wash- 
ing the flank with carbolic acid and water, one part to thirty, or one part 
coal-tar disinfectant and thirty parts water, insert the trocar into the left 
flank, selecting the center of the triangle formed by the last rib, the point of 
the hip and the transverse process of the lumbar vertebra and at the most 
bloated or prominent point direct the instrument obliquely downward and 
inward and you will not fail to tap the paunch. Pull out the trocar and 
leave the canula in until the bloat goes down. If it is a bad case of bloat 
and you have not the proper instruments, do not hesitate to plunge a knife 
into the left flank, using a goose quill or tube for the gas to pass through, 
for it is not a dangerous operation. (See " Hoven or Bloat.") 

IMPACTION OF THE PAUNCH OR RUMEN.— Impaction is where 
the paunch is wedged so full of food that it causes a sort of paralysis and loss 
of function of the stomach. 

CAUSES. — It is caused by eating too much straw or bulky food that 
lacks moisture and by eating large quantities of grain when the animal has 
not been accustomed to it. 

SYMPTOMS. — In milch, cows the milk flow almost ceases, the animal 
breathes with a grunt and there may be bloating. By pressing the hand on 
the left flank a dent when made is slow to fill out and by tapping over the 



118 THE PEOPLE'S HOME STOCK BOOK. 

paunch a dull sound is made. The bowels are usually costive and the pas- 
sages are dry and give off a disagreeable odor. 

TREATMENT. — Give from one to two pounds of epsom salts, one ounce 
of ground ginger and one-half ounce of laudanum in three quarts of warm 
water as a drench and, if the bowels do not move in twelve hours, give one 
quart of raw linseed oil or give three-fourths of a pound of epsom salts. It 
is also good practice to give a few quarts of warm water every two hours 
as this assists in softening the contents of the stomach. Also give one ounce 
of aromatic spirits of ammonia and one dram of fluid extract of nux vomica 
in a pint of cold water every four hours until the bowels move. In cases 
where there is much pain give four or five grains of morphine every six 
hours. In extreme cases I have obtained good results by giving one dram of 
croton oil and two drams of fluid extract of nux vomica in a quart of raw 
linseed oil. When these remedies fail the operation of rumenotomy should 
be performed. This treatment consists in opening the left flank and removing 
the contents by hand. This is not by any means a dangerous operation and 
is one that I never hesitate to perform when I believe the animal is in danger 
of dying. After the cow has been cast and rolled on her right side, the left 
flank washed clean and the hair clipped ofif short, apply one part carbolic 
acid to thirty parts water, or one part of coal-tar disinfectant and twenty 
parts of water. Then cut into the left flank in the triangle where the paunch 
lies close to the muscles. The opening must be made large enough to admit 
the hand. The edges of the stomach should be secured with strings to hold it 
up to the wound and after the stomach, is emptied the paunch should be 
stitched with catgut ; then stitch up the wound with silk and apply equal parts 
iodoform, powdered alum and boric acid; or, you may use any home 
remedy, such as coal-tar disinfectant or carbolic acid. (See " Rumenotomy.") 

RUMENOTOMY.— This is an operation made through the left flank into 
the paunch, whereby a portion of its contents is removed through the side, 
but of course this should never be done unless the stomach is badly over- 
loaded and distended. Tie the animal securely to a post or place it in a 
stanchion or stocks or with the right side against a wall. The animal should 
either be tied or held by an assistant. Clip the hair off high up on the 
flank where cattle are punctured. Wash with carbolic acid and water; make 
an incision through the skin and muscle, running up and down; then open 
the paunch ; insert a clean piece of cloth, wet in one part bi-chloride of mer- 
cury and 1,000 parts of warm water, to prevent the food getting into the abdo- 
men ; then remove as much of the food as necessary. Wash the edges of the 
wound, sewing up the paunch with catgut and leaving it in. Then sew up 
the muscles and later stitch the skin. Be sure to apply one part carbolic 
acid and thirty parts water to the wound three times a day. Keep the animal 
tolerably empty and the bowels open, feeding very little bulky food until 
the wound heals. (See " Impaction of the Paunch or Rumen.") 

IMPACTION OF THE MANYPLIES OR OMASUM— MA WBOUND. 
The third stomach, which is called the omasum or manyplies, has a great 
number of leaves arranged so as to rub one another, thus keeping up a sort of 
grinding action on the food that passes between them. Sometimes food be- 
comes wedged therein. 

CAUSES. — Many cases occur when animals are turned on to new grass 
before it has grown long enough for them to eat without taking in a lot of 
the old grass and, as the old grass has very little nourishment, it very often 



CATTLE— DISEASES OF DIGESTIVE ORGANS. 119 

clogs this stomach. The same thing occurs in the fall when cattle eat dry 
withered grass and it also occurs when they eat dry corn fodder in the winter. 

SYMPTOMS. — It very often comes on gradually much the same as con- 
stipation, finally causing some pain which is evidenced by the animal's kick- 
ing its belly and grunting at almost every breath. If pressed on the right 
side just below the ribs the animal evinces pain. If the disease goes on the 
fever increases and so does the abdominal pain. A sort of delirium and ver- 
tigo sets in which is very often followed by death. The symptoms of this 
ailment differ from those of impaction of the rumen for it causes no bloating 
of the left flank. 

TREATMENT. — The treatment should be the same as I have prescribed 
for impaction of the rumen, or impaction in horses. Unfortunately, a sur- 
gical operation cannot be performed successfully in these cases,- therefore 
it is much more fatal than impaction of the rumen. 

PEOPLE'S HOME REMEDY FOR IMPACTION OF THE MANY- 
PLIES.— 

1. Salt and Salts. — Give a drench of a pound of epsom salts and half 
a pound of common salt and then give two ounces of laudanum. Also give 
an ounce of alcohol every four hours. 

INFLAMMATION OF THE FOURTH PART OF THE STOMACH. 
— ^This disease is not nearly so likely to affect old cattle as young calves. It 
is very often brought on by eating frozen grass or frozen roots and it some- 
times follows eating over-ripe grain. In calves it takes place when chang- 
ing from sweet to sour milk ; this is especially true in very young calves. 

SYMPTOMS. — At first there is some diarrhea which is later followed 
by constipation; the nose is hot and dry; the ears and legs are cold; the 
pulse/ is quick and hard and the temperature is high. 

TREATMENT. — Give raw linseed oil in three or four-ounce doses with 
from thirty to sixty drops of laudanum added and rub the abdomen with 
mustard and water and if the animal is in much pain give one dram of lauda- 
num every two or three hours until relief is obtained. It is always good 
practice to clean out the stomach and bowels with oil. Feed easily digested 
food and not too much at a time. 

RUPTURE OF THE STOMACH.— (See " Horse Department.") 

DIARRHEA OR SCOURS.— Diarrhea may result from many different 
causes ; however, there are two principal causes, the first being an increased 
action of the muscular coat of the bowels and the second an increased se- 
cretion of the juices. 

CAUSfeS. — Eating too much food ; eating a large quantity of food of an 
inferior quality ; a sudden change of food ; or sudden changes of temperature 
will very often bring on looseness of the bowels. 

SYMPTOMS. — Nearly everyone is familiar with the symptoms of diar- 
rhea. The bowels pass off too much watery excrement which is sometimes 
mixed with blood ; the animal loses strength rapidly and also loses flesh and 
exhibits great thirst. 

TREATMENT. — It is good practice to give a dose of either raw lin- 
seed or castor oil with one or two ounces of laudanum and, if necessary, 
give the laudanum every two or three hours until the bowel movements are 
lessened. I have known one-half ounce of copperas dissolved in a pint of 
water given three times a day to check bad cases. In other bad cases give 
one-half grain of corrosive sqbljmate in a pint of water at a dose three times 



120 THE PEOPLE'S HOME STOCK BOOK. 

a day; or give 50 grains of salol three times a day; or give plenty of ginger 
in the feed. 
COLIC- 
CAUSES. — Eating too much food, grass or vegetables, or drinking too 
much cold water will very often produce uncomfortable feelings in cattle and 
sometimes produce colic. However, colic in cattle is not nearly so common 
an ailment as in horses. 

SYMPTOMS. — General uneasiness, casting the head from side to side, 
striking the belly with the hind feet, switching the tail, and lying down fre- 
quently are symptoms of colic. The pulse usually quickens during pain 
and occasionally the animal moans and grunts. Unless treatment is given 
the pain becomes more severe and some bloating takes place. 

TREATMENT. — Give one ounce of sulphuric ether, one ounce of lauda- 
num and one ounce of tincture of ginger in a quart of warm water as a 
drench ; give all of this at one dose. If you have no drugs on hand give six 
ounces of whiskey. You can give any home colic remedy that is used in hu- 
man practice, but be sure to give fifteen or twenty times as much at a dose as 
for a person. If much bloating takes place, give one-ounce doses of aromatic 
spirits of ammonia in a pint of cold water every thirty minutes until relief 
is obtained. 
PEOPLE'S HOME REMEDIES FOR COLIC— 

1. Whiskey, Pepper and Ginger. — To a pint of warm water add half a 
pint of whiskey and a tablespoonful each of ginger and black peppeif and 
give as a drench. This dose may be repeated in an hour if necessary. 

2. Linseed Oil and Turpentine. — To a pint of raw linseed oil add one 
ounce of spirits of turpentine and give as a drench every two hours until 
relieved. 

OFF-FEED— SUB-ACUTE INDIGESTION.— This is a very common 
ailment in cattle that are over-fed on grain and is most likely to affect those 
that are being fattened or cows which are forced to produce big records. 
Also, poor food may be the cause. 

SYMPTOMS.— The animal refuses to eat all the feed put before it. 
There is spme fullness and constipation or impaction of the rumen but very 
little, if any, pain. 

TREATMENT. — Give a full dose of epsom salts, 1% pounds, with plenty 
of water ; also give a teaspoonful of fluid extract of nux vomica in four ounces . 
of sweet oil or raw linseed oil, at a dose three times a day. Feed lightly for 
a few days. Remedies recommended for chronic indigestion are suitable for 
cases of this kind. 

CHRONIC INDIGESTION.— This is a condition, which has lasted some 
time, in which the digestive organs have failed to perform their normal 
functions. 

CAUSES. — It is generally the result of eating a poor quality of food 
or eating too much food without sufficient exercise but, fortunately, cattle 
are not nearly so likely to suffer from dyspepsia as horses. The worst cases 
of which I have ever known have resulted from eating large quantities of 
badly-cured, non-nutritious fodder when the animal was stabled in a filthy 
and badly ventilated barn. 

SYMPTOMS. — The animal usually has a dry coat and presents an un- 
thrifty appearance ; the hide is tight to the bones ; the appetite is either poor 
or capricious and the animal appears as though the food has done him no 



CATTLE— DISEASES OF DIGESTIVE ORGANS. 131 

good. When cows are affected they give very little milk and the bowels are 
usually costive. 

TREATMENT. — Give easily digested food such as silage, vegetables, 
clover hay, bran, oats, corn and linseed meal with plenty of salt added. Also 
give a tablespoonful of the following compound powder at a dose in feed three 
times a day : gentian, baking soda, ginger and fenugreek, equal parts by 
weight. (Also see treatment for indigestion in horses.) 
PEOPLE'S HOME REMEDIES FOR INDIGESTION.— 

1. Glauber's Salts. — Give four ounces of Glauber's salts every three or 
four days until cured. 

2. Ginger as a Preventive of Indigestion. — Give a tablespoonful of 
ginger and a tablespoonful of baking soda in the feed twice a day and it will 
be found to be a preventive of indigestion. 

INDIGESTION IN YOUNG CALVES.— The digestive organs of a calf 
become somewhat sluggish and inactive, very often by an over supply of rich 
milk or by giving them milk from cows that calved long ago; or, it may re- 
sult from not feeding calves often enough. . It also occurs from feeding un- 
wholesome food, keeping them in dirty, filthy pens and also from licking 
hair off other calves and themselves. 

SYMPTOMS. — They are usually dull and dumpish, their breath has a 
bad odor, they are usually pot-bellied and the bowels generally costive, but 
in some cases they may have diarrhea. 

TREATMENT. — Empty the stomach and bowels by giving a cathartic 
of castor oil or linseed oil. Also give some baking soda with their milk or 
in their feed, and give them some lime water. It is important to study the 
cause and remove it if possible ; however, it is important to supply them with 
a good quantity of wholesome food. 
PEOPLE'S HOME REMEDY FOR INDIGESTION IN CALVES.— 

1. Castor Oil, Soda and Ginger. — For a calf three months old give a 
dose of 2 ounces of castor oil and ^ ounce each of ginger and comnlon 
baking soda. If the calf is scouring it is well to add 15 drops of laudanum 
to this remedy. Each morning, for a few days after giving the above, give 
half an ounce each of soda, salt and pulverized ginger in a little milk. 

DEPRAVED APPETITE.— Cattle very frequently suffer from this pe- 
culiar affection and have a capricious appetite, many times showing a strong 
inclination to lick and eat filthy things such as the dung of horses and of 
other cattle. They are also inclined to lick lime, eat earth and chew rags 
and sponges. 

CAUSES. — It is caused by eating bad food that has changed so as to 
become almost indigestible and that has little or no nutritive properties. It 
also occurs in cattle that are pastured on low marshy land and, strange to 
say, it affects some cattle and not others that are fed on the same quality of 
food: 

SYMPTOMS. — There is an unthrifty condition, loss of flesh and strength 
and a disposition to eat the things above mentioned. They always show 
a rough, staring coat. 

TREATMENT,— A change of feed is the most important step to be 
taken. Also give two tablespoonfuls of baking soda, two tablespoonfuls of 
ginger, two tablespoonfuls of ground gentian and the same quantity of pow- 
dered wood charcoal at a dose, either in feed or as a drench, three times a 
day. Be sure to keep the cattle from eating the kind of food that has brought

on this ailment and remember that remedies that are prescribed for chronic in- 
digestion and dyspepsia are proper remedies for this disease. 

LOSING THE CUD— REMASTICATION.— As far back as I can re- 
member a great many owners of cattle have believed that it was possible lor 
the ox to lose his cud, but it is only a belief for such is not true ; therefore, you 
should not make the same mistake that many cattle owners have done in giv- 
ing fat pork, rags, sponges and the filthy inwards of chickens with the view of 
improving the digestion and causing the animal to remasticate food. In 
order that you may better understand how cattle and other ruminating ani- 
mals remasticate, let me say that the food is eaten hastily and swallowed when 
partially masticated. It passes on to the large paunch but later, by a sort of 
vomiting action, it is thrown into the lower portion of the gullet (oesophagus) 
and then the gullet reverses its action by contracting at its lower end first 
and thus it forces the food back into the mouth. This portion of the food 
is called the cud. After chewing this cud thoroughly the bolus is swallowed, 
not stopping at the paunch but generally passing on to the third stomach 
and after being more perfectly digested it passes to the true or fourth stom- 
ach, then on into the intestines. As soon as the bolus passes down another 
cud is passed up and so on until remastication ceases. Any disease that 
causes loss of appetite will of course have a tendency to prevent the ox 
chewing his cud, but as soon as his appetite returns and he eats fodder then 
his chewing of the cud returns. 

DIARRHEA — GASTRIC CATARRH — WHITE SCOURS IN 

CALVES. — This ailment is very often the result of some error in feeding 

or of the lack of care that is given to the feeding utensils. It is much more 

common in hand-fed calves than those that suck their mothers ; also, calves 

'that are fed substitutes for milk are very often victims of white scours. 

SYMPTOMS. — The symptoms are the passing of a thin, yellow excre- 
ment; general dullness; some uneasiness; loss of appetite and sometimes 
passing of blood and loss of flesh. 

TREATMENT. — Give one and one-half ounces of castor oil with a tea- 
spoonful of laudanum added; then give teaspoonful doses of laudanum four 
times a day and if the laudanum does not check the excessive bowel move- 
ments dissolve one ounce of sulphate of iron in a pint of water and give 
one-eighth part at a dose three times a day; or, try dissolving a teaspoonful 
of baking soda in two ounces of lime water and give this quantity three times 
a d&y. I have also known cases where tablespoonful doses of good flour 
corrected scours. In bad cases give ten grains of salol three or four times 
a day or give small doses of bi-chloride of mercury and water, one-half grain 
at a dose. 
PEOPLE'S HOME REMEDIES FOR SCOURS OR DIARRHEA.— 

1. Alum. — Dissolve a piece of alum as large as a hen's egg in a bucket 
of water and let the cow drink it. This will be found a very effective remedy 
for scours in either cattle or horses. 

2. Boiled Potatoes. — Three times a day feed a peck of boiled potatoes 
while warm. 

3. Flour and Water. — Give at one dose a quart of wheat flour mixed 
with water until it is smooth and just thin enough to run. The dose sel- 
dom has to be repeated. 

4. Salt. — A handful of salt will frequently cure the scours. 

5. Camphor, Rhubarb and Laudanum. — Mix equal parts of spirits of 



CATTLE— DISEASES OF DIGESTIVE ORGANS. 123 

camphor, tincture of rhubarb, and laudanum. This mixture should be put 
into one-half pint of water and given as a drench. The dose for a cow is 
a dessert spoonful and for a calf a teaspoonful. This dose may be repeated 
in three hours if necessary. 

6. Ginger, Charcoal and Baking Powder. — Twice a day give a teaspoon- 
ful of a mixture of equal parts of charcoal, ginger and baking powder. This 
dose is for a small calf and may be given on the tongue or as a drench. 

7. Castor Oil. — Give a tablespoonful of castor oil twice a day for a 
calf not over three months of age. 

8. White Scours in Calves.^ — Three times a day give half a teaspoonful 
of laudanum in a tablespoonful of castor oil. 

INFECTIOUS SCOURS.— This is a form of scours that attacks calves 
that are only a few days old and if not corrected it may terminate in death. 
This ailment usually is the result of diseased germs entering the body through 
the navel cord. 

SYMPTOMS. — There is great weakness and the passing of thick liquid 
feces. 

TREATMENT. — As curative treatment very often fails, an effort should 
be made to prevent this .disease. Treat the navel as is suggested under that 
heading. Place the animal in a dry, clean stall and apply one part of car- 
bolic acid and twenty parts water to the navel before and after the string has 
been applied and use disinfectants freely. Give five drops creosote in a 
tablespoonful of sweet oil twice a day. Also give five grains of salol three 
times a day. 

DYSENTERY— BLOODY FLUX.— Dysentery usually commences in 
the colon but may extend to the other bowels until nearly all of them are 
aflfected. The mucous membrane is where most of the disease is located. It 
is brought on by feeding badly cured hay, poor grain or other food. There are 
certain acid and poisonous plants that bring it on and drinking bad water is 
another cause of dysentery. 

SYMPTOMS. — The animal walks slowly and appears dumpish. It may 
have some abdominal pain and the muzzle is dry and the coat rough. It 
stands with the back arched and presents a sort of hide-bound and unhealthy 
appearance. At first the bqwels act irregularly, the breath is fetid and so are 
the bowel movements and they are often streaked with blood. This disease 
very often terminates fatally. 

TREATMENT.— This disease should be treated very much the same 
as diarrhea, always giving oil at first with quieting medicine and bowel anti- 
septics later. I believe in keeping the animal quiet and bringing it well under 
the influence of an^ opiate which gives the animal rest and always checks the 
excessive bowel movements. If the bowels are leaking blood, dissolve one 
dram of sugar of lead and two drams of fluid extract of ergot in a pint of water 
and give at one dose two or three tinges a day. Corrosive sublimate or 
iialol solution should be given if other remedies fail. 

CONSTIPATION.— A costive state of the bowels exists for want of 
■sufficient moisture in the stomach and bowels, resulting from lack of exercise 
and water supply. 

CAUSES. — This is caused by feeding too ripe food and too much dry 
fodder, preventing the animals from taking exercise, and not giving enough 
water. It is also the result of offering ^animals impure water of which they 
drink too little, thereby depriving themselves of sufficient moisture. In 



1«4 THE PEOPLE'S HOME STOCK BOOK. 

young calves the bowels are inclined to be costive at birth and immediately 
after ; but of course the first milk of a cow is laxative, but if it does not pro- 
duce the desired effects a remedy should be given. 

SYMPTOMS. — The passage of dry manure with a sort of glazed cover- 
ing is a well marked symptom. The muzzle is often dry and the appetite 
poor. If not relieved it may result in inflammation of the bowels or impac- 
tion, causing bowel pain. 

TREATMENT. — Give food of a laxative nature, such as well salted brzln 
mash, vegetables or green food. Injections into the rectum of soap suds at 
blood heat is always good treatment. Give epsom salts or raw linseed oil 
to start the bowel movements and keep feeding plenty of salt which will in- 
crease thirst, thus causing the animal to drink plenty of water, which is 
nature's remedy. Besides, it is well to keep in mind that the bowels move 
three or four times as often when the animal is exercised as when standing 
still. 

CONSTIPATION IN CALVES— RE'TENTION OF THE MECON- 
IUM. — At birth the bowels contain a glue-like material which should be ex- 
pelled very soon after birth for if not it may do harm. The first milk (colos- 
trum) possesses laxative properties and if the calf sucks plenty of it the bowels 
are liable to loosen, but if they do not, push in a small piece of soap or a 
glycerine suppository or inject into the bowel some sweet oil or warm soap 
suds, but be very careful not to injure the bowel. If the milk from the 
mother fails to open the bowels give an ounce of epsom salts and repveat in 
six hours if needed. 

ENTERITIS— INFLAMMATION OF THE BOWELS.— This is an 
inflammation of the lining membrane and also involves the muscular wall 
of the bowels. 

CAUSES. — It comes from eating infected or poisonous things, either 
animal, vegetable or mineral and it may also be brought on by irritating 
drugs, drinking ice cold water, or chilling the surface of the body by ex- 
posure to cold rain storms or sleet. 

SYMPTOMS. — There is very often constipation of the bowels and the 
excrement which is passed is usually covered with a slimy mucus; besides, 
the dung has an offensive odor and is sometimes streaked with blood. There 
is loss of appetite, high fever, quick pulse, dry mouth and muzzle and in 
cows the milk flow almost ceases. The urine is highly colored, the animal 
may bloat, and as the disease progresses the ears and legs grow cold and it 
is not unusual for death to follow. 

TREATMENT. — Ascertain the cause if possible. If brought on by irri- 
tating poisons, either vegetable or mineral, give two ounces of sweet oil and 
one ounce of laudanum in a quart of linseed gruel every three or four hours ; 
also give thirty drops of fluid extract of aconite at a dose every three hours 
until the temperature lowers. Also give a tablespoonful of powdered salt- 
peter in the drinking water three times a day. If occurring in summer or 
during temperate weather, apply blankets wrung out of hot water, covering 
them with dry ones and changing them every hour. After recovery takes 
place the animal should be fed on easily digested food that is not too bulky 
and if the appetite is poor give tonics, such as gentian in one-ounce doses 
three times a day; or give other remedies recommended for chronic indiges- 
tion. 



CATTLE— DISEASES OF DIGESTIVE ORGANS. 125 

PERITONITIS. — This is an inflammation of the membrane that covers 
the bowels and other abdominal viscera and also lines the abdominal cavity. 

CAUSES. — It is brought on by exposure to cold rain storms or standing 
in a cool wirid after being in a heated condition or by lying too long on 
cold frozen ground. It sometimes follows castration or spaying; sometimes 
follows calving and I have frequently found it to follow punctured wounds 
which penetrated the belly. It is also caused by kicks from horses, being 
hooked by cattle or running against hard things, such as posts. It may be 
caused by hanging on fences and the consequent bruising of the abdomen. 

SYMPTOMS. — There is considerable uneasiness with shivering and a 
turning of the head toward the sides. There is a dry muzzle and no rumina- 
tion. The legs are placed well under the belly, the pulse is quick and small, 
the temperature is high and the bowel movements are dry and hard. Apply- 
ing pressure to the flanks produces considerable pain. Sometimes the symp- 
toms are very much like those of inflammation of the bowels. 

TREATMENT. — Try to ascertain the cause. If from a puncture the 
treatment of course will differ somewhat from the treatment of cases caused 
by exposure. Apply hot packs such as suggested for treatment in inflam- 
mation of the bowels. If there is a wound, treat it as such by applying perox- 
ide of hydrogen first, then inject one part carbolic acid and thirty or fifty 
of water. Also apply equal parts of iodoform and boric acid and give the 
same internal treatment as prescribed for enteritis. 

CORNSTALK DISEASE.— This is a disease brought on by cattle eat- 
ing too much infected corn fodder. The disease occurs throughout the 
Western and Middle States. This corn fodder appears to either produce a 
very acute indigestion or poisons the animal and young cattle are usually 
affected more than the old ones; besides, the fodder seems to be most harm- 
ful after cold rain storms which perhaps add to its poisonous properties. 
Cattle that are hungry when turned into these corn fields soon become affected 
if they eat large quantities of fodder where the stalks have been unusually 
rank in growth ; or, cattle that are turned from one lot to another often 
seem to suffer from this ailment. 

SYMPTOMS. — The first symptom noticed is the sick animal's being 
away from the herd and standing with the back arched. When obliged to 
walk it goes with a wabbling gait, twitching the tail and very often kicking 
its belly and is usually somewhat delirious, which symptom becomes more 
pronounced, the animal acting as though in great pain. The animal frequently 
dies within twenty-four hours after showing symptoms of this disease. 

TREATMENT. — Avoid turning hungry animals into such corn fields 
and allowing them to remain very long in the lot; besides, feed other food 
and it should be of a laxative nature, such as alfalfa or millet. See that they 
have plenty of salt. Following these directions will greatly assist in pre- 
venting the death of cattle from this ailment for there is no sure remedy. 
PEOPLE'S HOME REMEDIES FOR CORNSTALK DISEASE.— 

1. Tansy Tea. — Frequently give five-pint doses of tansy tea and a cure 
will be effected. ' 

3. Preventive. — Accustom the cows to eating corn and stalks before 
turning them into the field and you will have no trouble with cornstalk 
impaction. Also see that they have plenty of salt and good water. 

HAIR OR BINDER TWINE BALLS.— It is not uncommon to find 



126 THE PEOPLE'S HOME STOCK BOOK. 

hair balls or balls composed of binder twine in the reticulum or in the rumen or 
paunch. 

CAUSES. — Hair balls are caused by one animal's licking another during 
the shedding season and they also eat binder twine with their fodder which 
of course is not digestible and often forms into balls. 

SYMPTOMS. — ^These are rather puzzling cases to diagnose; however, 
they cause much the same symptoms as indigestion. There is general un- 
easiness and loss of appetite but, strange to say, many cattle that are slaugh- 
tered have large hair and twine balls which have seemingly done no harm. 

TREATMENT. — Treat the same as for impaction of the rumen and 
inflamed stomach, by giving epsom salts; or, cut open the same as for im- 
pacted rumen. 

INTESTINAL TUMORS.— (See " Horse Department.") 

INTUSSUSCEPTION.— (See " Horse Department.") 

FALLING OF BOWEL— PROLAPSUS ANL— (See " Horse Depart- 
ment.") 

RUPTURE OF THE RECTUM.— (See " Horse Department.") 

WORMS. — It is safe to say that cattle are bothered less with worms 
than any other species of domestic animals, therefore it is seldom necessary 
to treat them for intestinal worms. Tapeworms and round worms are some- 
times found in the bowels of cattle. 

SYMPTOMS. — Examine the manure and if you do not discover any 
worms, and your animals are thrifty, it will not be necessary to give them 
treatment. 

TREATMENT. — For tapeworms give a tablespoonful of oil of male fern 
and two drams of powdered kamala in a pint of milk for three mornings in 
succession and, after the last dose has been given, give from one to two pounds 
of epsom salts in two quarts of warm water. This will act as a brisk cathar- 
tic. If you suspect that your cattle are wormy give two tablespoonfuls of 
the following compound powder at a dose in feed twice a day: powdered 
sulphate of iron, ground gentian, ground ginger, bi-carbonate of soda and 
ground worm seed. It is not always necessary to give as large doses as I 
have prescribed. Another very effectual remedy is to give one dram of san- 
tonine and thirty grains of calomel at a dose in feed every morning for three 
or four days and to follow with a cathartic of epsom salts. I have also ob- 
tained good results by giving oil of turpentine, two tablespoonfuls in a pint 
of raw linseed oil, once a day for a few days. 

HERNIA OR RUPTURE.— A hernia, or rupture, is the displacement of 
some internal organ through a natural or unnatural opening. It generally has 
reference to the protrusion of the bowel and omentum through an opening 
in the wall of the abdomen. 

VENTRAL HERNIA.— This is where the protrusion is through the 
abdominal wall and the skin remains intact. 

CAUSES. — Hernia may be produced by kicks from horses or by blows 
of the horns of other cattle or by falls or sprains. It may also occur in ad- 
vanced cases of pregnancy owing to the stretching of the muscles and in old 
cows it may come on without any apparent injury. 

SYMPTOMS. — A rupture in cattle is very often found on the right side 
and when it occurs it is not usually painful, but later on may enlarge to such 
an extent as to allow the bowel to strangulate, then great pain sets in. 

TREATMENT. — When a hernia can be reduced by pushing the part? 



CATTLE— DISEASES OF DIGESTIVE ORGANS. 137 

back into the abdomen and a pad with bandage applied so as to keep it in 
place the opening may close. Melted pitch and other counter-irritants, such 
as turpentine or cantharides, applied directly over the opetiing with a pad 
over this will assist in producing adhesive inflammation. When this treat- 
ment fails it is necessary to resort to surgical work. After the animal has 
been cast and rolled on the side or back, the skin is cut through, the muscles 
sewed with catgut and the skin sewed with heavy corded silk and an elastic 
bandage is then applied to support the stitches. This operation should be 
performed by either a veterinarian or an experienced dairyman. 

UMBILICAL HERNIA (Navel Rupture).— This is a very common ail- 
ment in calves and as the navel opening is where the blood vessels pass from 
the foetus to enter the umbilical cord, this opening at birth should close, but 
it does not always do so. Therefore, some of the internal viscera may de- 
scend, causing what is called navel rupture. 

CAUSES. — In some new-born calves the opening appears to be large. 
However, it is often enlarged at time of birth from the pulling loos^ of the 
cord, allowing the intestine to pass through it. It may also occur from kicks 
or blows. 

SYMPTOMS. — An enlargement at the navel leads one to suspect that 
something is wrong and by pressing the end of the finger .on the bunch you 
will readily push the sack back into the abdomen. This condition is abnormal. 

TREATMENT. — Never be too hasty with remedies for many cases get 
well without treatment, nature effecting the cure, for as the animal grows 
older the muscles grow stronger and the disposition of nature is to clo.«e the 
opening. In some cases a pad and bandage applied seem to greatlj assist 
nature in closing the opening. In a case where the intestines cannot be put 
back a surgical operation is necessary. Then the skin should be opened, the 
adhesions separated, the edges of the opening made raw, the muscles sewed 
together with catgut and the skin stitched with corded silk and an elastic 
bandage should then be applied and kept on until the wound heals. The 
stitches should remain in a week. A simple way to operate is to return the 
sack, put cross pins of either hickory wood or steel at right angles, tie a 
string back of the pins and leave it on until it sloughs off, then the calf will 
be well. 

INGUINAL HERNIA. — This is a condition where a loop of the bowel 
passes down into the scrotum through the inguinal canal where the spermatic 
cord is, causing some enlargement of the scrotum. When the animal shows 
much pain and the scrotum is swollen, pass the hand into the rectum and 
explore^ the floor of the abdomen and it will be possible to pull up the bowel, 
but when doing so the ^animal should be placed on its back or the hind feet 
should be two feet higher than the fore feet. This will assist you in righting 
the bowel. If this occurs in a bull he had better be castrated by the covered 
method, using a clamp and allowing the testicles to slough off. If it occurs in 
a steer and he is in good condition, market him. 

SCROTAL HERNIA. — This is when the bowel passes down the canal 
into the scrotum and I have known many calves to be in this condition at 
birth. Everything goes on all right so long as the opening is large enough 
to allow the feces to pass through the loop of bowel without the intestine 
becoming strangulated or impacted, thus causing inflammation. The open- 
ing in young animals has a tendency to close and it very often does so, 
crowding the bowel up into the body. In many cases the animal suffers no 



128 THE PEOPLE'S HOME STOCK BOOK. 

special' inconvenience and requires no treatment, but if they do require 
treatment they should be castrated by the covered operation. (See " Castra- 
tion " in Horse Department.) 

DIAPHRAGMATIC HERNIA.— This may occur from violent muscular 
eflforts or the diaphragm may become lacerated from a broken rib or any 
other offending body. No matter how slight may be the rupture of the 
diaphragm it is a serious trouble and not much can be done in the line of 
treatment to relieve it except to give rest. Anodynes will allow a slight 
case to merge along into the chronic form. However, it seldom pays to 
treat them. 

MESENTERIC AND OMENTAL HERNIA.— This is a condition 
where a complete obstruction of the bowels takes place and it is very diffi- 
cult to make a diagnosis or apply a remedy. 

VAGINAL HERNIA. — This sometimes takes place and when it does it 
should be treated the same as eversion of the vagina, by placing the animal in 
a position with the hind parts about a foot higher than the fore parts and 
giving laxatives to open the bowels and keeping the animal empty. 

IRREGULAR TEETH.— Irregularity of the teeth is very often the re- 
sult of an uneven wearing of them and the incisor teeth (nippers) are some- 
times broken accidentally by cattle grazing on gravelly soil or by taking 
hold of mangers covered with hoop iron or by kicks, thus splitting the tooth. 
Also, some cattle have trouble when shedding their first teeth. 

TREATMENT. — Examine the animal's mouth by placing a gag ifi the 
mouth to keep it open, or pull the tongue well forward and intrpducie the 
hand to keep it open. This can be done easily for I have seldom found it 
necessary to use anything except the closed hand, but of course a balling 
iron or mouth speculum is much more convenient on account of its holding 
the mouth open wider, thereby giving an inexperienced person a better op- 
portunity to examine the back part of the mouth. It is seldom necessary 
to do more than to extract a tooth or file off the sharp cutting points that 
are wounding the cheeks, tongue or lips. For a mouth wash there is nothing 
better than borax and water, one ounce to a quart, and it should be applied 
three times a day. 

CAPS ON THE TEETH.— Cattle between two and four years of age 
when shedding their temporary teeth or milk grinders sometimes have trouble 
on account of the first teeth or caps hanging on too long while the new 
teeth are growing in. This sometimes produces suppuration and a soreness 
of the mouth which is soon discovered by using the same means of examina- 
tion which I have recommended under " Irregular Teeth." 

TREATMENT. — Remove the cause by pulling oflf the cap with a pair 
of pincers or forceps, then wash the mouth with borax and water or any 
mild non-poisonous antiseptic solution you may have on hand. Borax and 
water or salt and water will prove very satisfactory. 

DECAYED TEETH (Caries).— As nearly all stockmen and farmers 
know, whenever a tooth or bone is decaying it gives oflf a very oflfensive 
odor, differing entirely from that of any other decomposing tissue or part of 
the body. To make sure that a tooth is decaying use a balling iron or 
speculum or pull the tongue forward and close the hand, leaving it between 
the teeth and upper jaw to keep the mouth open, then introduce the other 
hand and examine for a decayed tooth. 

TREATMENT. — The only satisfactory remedy is to extract the tooth 



CATTLE— DISEASES OF DIGESTIVE ORGANS. 139 

with a pair of forceps made for the purpose, then the opening in the jaw 
will soon close. I have often plugged the opening temporarily with gutta- 
percha and have found it to work nicely for it keeps the food out of the 
wound until the tissues grow and fill the openings. 
INFLAMMATION OF THE TONGUE— GLOSSITIS.— 

CAUSES. — This comes from injuries of any kind, from giving irritating 
drugs, from eating certain acrid plants which contain too much acid and 
irritating properties and it is also caused by a disturbed stomach. 

SYMPTOMS. — There is generally some discharge of saliva from the 
mouth, the tongue and mouth are inflamed and in calves there are very often 
little red elevations noticed in the mouth. These red spots may suppurate 
in the center and show ulcerated patches. The tongue swells and frequently 
hangs out of the mouth. , 

TREATMENT.— When the mouth is only inflamed wash it out four 
or five times a day with a solution made by dissolving one-half pound of 
alum in a gallon of water and if there are any ulcers or ulcerated patches 
apply a caustic. The nitrate of silver pencil is the handiest. When the mouth 
shows a cankered condition give one ounce of baking soda at a dose as a 
drench in a quart of water. Or, give one ounce of powdered charcoal and 
forty grains of salol at a dose two or three times a day. 
PEOPLE'S HOME REMEDIES FOR BLACK TONGUE.— 

1. Alum, Lime, Etc. — The animal should be bled from the neck vein 
and then given a pint of castor oil which may be repeated in 10 hours if 
it has not operated. As a local application, use four ounces of burnt alum 
and two ounces of chloride of lime mixed in one gallon of water and fre- 
quently swab the mouth with this mixture. 

INJURIES TO THE TONGUE.— (See " Horse Department.") 

SORE MOUTH— STOMATITIS.— Young calves are usually the vic- 
tims of this ailment and it usually comes on while they are teething. 

CAUSES. — It frequently follows inflammation of the navel or comes 
on as a result of the lack of nutritious food and it may be the result of diar- 
rhea. This disease is not nearly so common in grown animals as it is in 
calves and very often it occurs while they are cutting their teeth. 

SYMPTOMS. — In the early stage there is usually some redness of the 
mouth and some discharge of saliva, and in a few days pointed sores appear 
which are white in color but soon change to yellow. The tissue breaks down 
and gives off an offensive odor. In some cases the ulceration is so extensive 
that the cheek is perforsited. In severe cases whfere the animal has diarrhea 
death very often results in eight or ten days. In old cattle recovery seldom 
takes place in less than from fifteen to twenty-five days. 

TREATMENT. — For a calf give eight grains of quinine at a dose four 
times a day and if there is diarrhea give a tablespoonful of lime water three 
or four times a day. If the animal shows great weakness give two table- 
spoonfuls of whiskey or brandy in a teacupful of sweetened water three or 
four times a day. To quiet the odor from the mouth use permanganate of 
potash and water, one dram to a pint, or put a tablespoonful of carbolic acid 
into a pint of water and swab the raw surfaces several times a day. The 
calf should be fed fresh cow's milk. Give tonics such as quinine, gentian 
and iron. For calves give ten or fifteen grains of quinine at a dose and for 
cows give not less than two drams at a dose two or three times a day. 



130 THE PEOPLE'S HOME STOCK BOOK. 

SLAVERING. — Slavering is a dribbling or discharge of mucus and 
saliva from the mouth. 

CAUSES. — Slavering is usually caused by some foreign body lodging 
in the mouth or by cattle eating irritating plants or licking fresh lime; or, it 
may be the result of applying mercurial ointment and it sometimes is caused 
by sharp points on the teeth. It is also one of the symptoms of foot and 
mouth disease. 

TREATMENT. — First of all a very thorough examination of the mouth 
should be made to ascertain if there is any foreign body causing the trouble, 
and if such is the case it should be removed. Put one ounce of carbolic acid 
and two ounces of glycerine into three quarts of tepid water, or dissolve 
three ounces of powdered alum in a gallon of water, and wash out the mouth 
three or four times a day. Sometimes the edges of the teeth become sharp and 
irritate the mouth. This is easily remedied by filing off the points. Some- 
times between the ages of two and four years the caps of temporary teeth, 
when shedding, cause an inflammation of the mouth which is readily remedied 
by pulling off these milk teeth. 

VOMITING. — This is not a common ailment in cattle but it does some- 
times follow irritation of either the first or fourth stomach and is no doubt 
the result of eating indigestible material such as pieces of cloth, leather, 
or any other substance that may act as an irritant. Besides, it is a result of 
indigestion and when it does occur it usually takes place in animals that are 
unthrifty. Vomiting generally lasts only a short time. 

TR^^ATMENT. — Feed easily digested food that is non-irritating, also 
give a small dose of epsom salts to clean out the stomach, or give one-half 
ounce of chloral hydrate and two ounces of sub-nitrate of bismuth in one 
quart of black coffee every six or eight hours. 
CONGESTION OF THE LIVER— JAUNDICE OR YELLOWS.— 

CAUSES. — Bile stones forming in the duct of the liver, thereby obstruct- 
ing the free flow of bile, is what generally brings on a congested or inflarned 
condition of the liver. ' , ' 

SYMPTOMS. — By pressing the hand on the right side along the lower 
part of the short ribs the animal will evince pain ; there is always loss of appe- 
tite and thirst ; the urine is dark colored ; the animal lies down quite a portion 
of the time; seldom moves about without being forced and walks with a 
staggering gait. In cows the secretion of milk is light and it very often has a 
bitter taste. The horns and ears are generally cold and in some cases there 
is coughing. * 

TREATMENT. — First of all, the bowels should be opened by giving from 
one to two pounds of epsom salts and after they act freely give three ounces 
of phosphate of soda in a quart of hot water twice a day, or give one-fourth 
pound Glauber's salts daily, or give four tablespoonfuls of baking soda and two 
tablespoonfuls of ginger at a dose in feed two or three times a day. 

CIRRHOSIS OR HARDENING OF LIVER.— (See "Horse Depart- 
ment.") 

INFLAMMATION OF THE LIVER— HEPATITIS.— This is really 
an advanced stage of congestion of the liver but it may be confined to one 
part of the liver only as an abscess may form in this inflamed part. 

SYMPTOMS. — It is no easy matter to make a correct diagnosis; how- 
ever, the white of the eye and the membrane lining the mouth are always

yellow. The appetite is poor and the lower part of the belly appears full 
while the upper part appears empty. The animal usually lies down a con- 
siderable part of the time, showing weakness, with the head very often turned 
resting on the side. 

TREATMENT.— Give one-half pound of Glauber's salts in three pints of 
tepid water at a dose once or twice a day or as often as necessary to open the 
bowels. Apply mustard and water over the liver twice a day and give one 
dram of quinine at a dose four times a day. 

FLUKE DISEASE— WORM IN THE LIVER.— Cattle and sheep that 
pasture on low-lying, swampy, river-bottom lands are sometimes troubled 
with this ailment but, fortunately, it seems to be confined to certain localities. 
Usually cattle become infected during the rainy season. 

CAUSES. — This parasite or fluke is doubtless taken in with the food 
or drinking water and finally lodges in the billiary duct of the liver. Here 
it grows and develops and is then passed ofif through the bowels to perhaps 
infect other cattle at some later day. 

SYMPTOMS.— At first; the animal thrives unusually well but when the 
flukes grow and multiply they set up an irritation in the liver. The liver 
softens and is easily torn and the animal becomes dull and swells under 
the throat. His membranes grow yellow, the skin becomes dry, the body 
dropsical and weakness and death soon follow. When cut open the para- 
sites are found in the liver. 

TREATMENT.— All diseased or affected animals should be killed and 
unafifected cattle removed to high and dry pasture lots. There is no danger 
in turning horses on affected pastures. 

CHOKING. — This is a very common occurrence on the farm or in the 
dairy. 

CAUSES. — The animal sometimes chokes when eating vegetables such 
as potatoes, turnips, beets, apples, or pears or when eating dry chaff or dry 
6a,ts. It usually happens to animals that are ravenous eaters. 

SYMPTOMS. — The animal suddenly stops eating, coughs some, breathes 
heavily, and slavers at the mouth. It pokes out the nose and acts as though 
swallowing but when water is poured down or the animal drinks it is soon 
ejected and causes distress. If the choke is in the neck region considerable 
bloating shows in the left side. 

TREATMENT.— If the obstruction is in the mouth y?r well up in the 
throat the mouth should be held open with a balling iron ; or, I have often 
used a horse shoe or clevis or a piece of wood. If the hand of the person 
is not too large the foreign body that is producing all the trouble can then 
be removed with the hand very conveniently. However, if the choke is low 
down a probang, which is made for this purpose, or a flexible buggy whip, 
or a piece of rubber hose corked with a piece of wood with the end of cgurse 
made smooth, can be passed down the gullet and the object forced into the 
stomach. In performing this operation an assistant or two should take hold 
of the head and straighten out the nose in a line with the neck, as this makes 
easy the work of passing the probang. In some cases it is necessary to open 
the gullet and remove the obstruction, then stitch up the gullet wound and 
feed the animal on liquid diet for a week or ten days. 
PEOPLE'S HOME REMEDIES FOR CHOKING.— 

1. Tobacco. — Make a ball of fine-cut chewing tobacco as large as an 
egg, hold the cow's head up and put the tobacco back far enough in the

mouth so that she will have to swallow. This will cause sickness and vom- 
iting and consequent relaxing of the muscles so that the apple or other ob- 
struction will either be vomited up or worked down into the stomach. This 
remedy has saved many valuable cows and may be depended upon. 

2. Rubber Hose. — Run a piece of rubber hose down the throat. Never 
use a whip or broomstick if any other remedy is at hand for fear of injuring 
or killing the animal. 

3. Egg. — Break an egg into the animal's mouth and it will relieve the 
choking. 

4. Lard or Linseed Oil. — Drench the animal with some melted lard or 
some linseed oil and then work the obstruction loose with the hands. 

5. Soft Soap. — Dilute half a pint of soft soap with some water and 
pour down the animal's throat if it is choking.

DISEASES OF THE RESPIRATORY OR 
BREATHING ORGANS. 

(Including Pneumonia, Pleurisy, Bronchitis, Hoose or Husk, Catarrh, Nasal 
Gleet, Malignant Catarrh, Sore Throat, Etc.) 



PNEUMONIA — INFLAMMATION OF THE LUNGS — LUNG 
FEVER. — Pneumonia is an inflamed condition of the lung tissue. 

CAUSES. — Pneumonia very often follows bronchitis, the inflammation 
extending to the lung tissue; or, it comes from colds and exposure during 
changeable weather, especially when the temperature is falling. It also re- 
sults from exhaustion and stabling in damp, badly ventilated barns. Veter- 
, inarians are pretty well agreed that it is a germ ailment and very often 
infectious. 

SYMPTOMS. — There is always a cessation of rumination (loss of cud), 
staring coat, more or less loss of appetite, and the animal usually has a chill. 
The respirations are quick, the pulse is also quick and the temperature goes 
up to 105 or 107 degrees. By sounding the chest a rasping sort of sound is 
heard which later changes to a murmur. 

TREATMENT. — In the treatment of pneumonia the animal should be 
placed in a dry, comfortable stall free from drafts, the body kept warm and 
plenty of fresh air admitted. It is also important to supply the patient with 
all the cold water it' will drink, but of course not large quantities at a time. 
Give twenty drops of fluid extract of aconite at a dose in one-half teacupful 
of cold water every four hours until the fever reduces and the temperature 
lowers within a degree or two of normal. Or, give three drams of nitrate of 
potassium at a dose every six hours until the fever subsides. This can be 
given in drinking water. When the circulation is weak give stimulants 
such as sweet spirits of nitre, in one and one-half-ounce doses, with five ounces 
of whiskey every six hours, or it can be given every four hours with good 
results. If the legs are cold, bandage them in cotton. If the body is cold 
blankets should be applied. I have found mustard and water applications to 
give Telief when applied to the sides, also poultices of antiphlogistine, oil 
meal, warm bran and even cold packs with plenty of dry blankets over 
them have seemingly given relief. I have noticed good results to follow the 
steaming with either creosote or carbolic acid for a few minutes a few times 
daily. This is done by addirjg a tablespoonful of creosote or two table- 
spoonfuls of carbolic acid to one gallon of boiling water, keeping it warm and 
directing the stream into one or both nostrils for ten minutes at a time. 
Whenever signs of improvement are shown, discontinue giving fever medi- 
cine or you will do harm, but give tonics and laxatives. Give brandy, milk, 
eggs, also some quinine, gentian, ginger or any home tonic or stimulant and 
remember that good nursing has a whole lot to do with the successful treat- 
ment of pneumonia. 
PEOPLE'S HOME REMEDIES FOR PNEUMONIA.— 

1. Salts and Mustard Plasters. — Give a pound of epsom salts and apply 
mustard plasters freely.

134 THE PEOPLE'S HOME STOCK BOOK. 

PLEURISY, — Pleurisy is an inflammation of the pleura, which is a 
membrane that lines the chest and is reflected over the lungs. When inflamed 
it should be treated promptly for if allowed to go on and become chronic 
the inflammation usually terminates in water in the chest. This condition 
is called hydrothorax. 

CAUSES. — The same causes which bring on other ailments such as 
laryngitis, bronchitis, inflammation of the lungs, and diseases of ithe respira-' 
tory organs will cause pleurisy. Besides, broken ribs and chest punctures 
very often bring it on. 

SYMPTOMS. — There is always some fever, the pulse beats are wiry, 
the breathing is quickened, the elbows are turned well out and the breath- 
ing is done mostly with the abdominal muscles. In most cases of pleurisy 
there is a well-marked crease extending from back of the elbow to the flank. 
The act of expelling air from the lungs appears to be done with much more 
ease than the act of taking the air into the chest. Pressure applied to the 
space between the ribs causes pain and makes breathing more difficult. The 
nose is dry, the ears hang down, there is loss of appetite and it is not unusua} 
for the animal to point the nose around to the side as if suffering pain. By 
tapping the ribs over the chest a clear sound is heard which is not the case 
in pneumonia; besides, the breath is not hot and there is no rasping noise 
as we hear in bronchitis. 

TREATMENT.^If the bowels are not costive it will not be necessary 
to give a laxative but be sure to apply mustard and water to the chest-'daily. 
Give 25 drops of fluid extract of aconite every three hours in a teacupful of 
cold water. Also give one-half ounce of powdered saltpeter twice a day. 
The same treatment as for bronchitis and pneumonia in horses is also proper 
in cattle but give almost twice as much medicine at a dose to cattle as to 
horses. When a recovery does not take place promptly, water may accumu- 
late in the chest and if this is the case follow the treatment prescribed for 
hydrothorax. 

BRONCHITIS. — Bronchitis is an inflammation of the mucous membrane 
which lines the bronchial tubes. 

CAUSES. — Exposure to storms, sudden change of temperature, from hot 
to cold and neglected cases of catarrh and sore throat are causes of this 
disease. 

SYMPTOMS. — The animal presents a rather peculiar expression, 
breathes with a grunt and has a painful cough, high temperature and no appe- 
tite. The, disease generally reaches its height in three days and begins to 
let up in six or eight days. 

TREATMENT. — Make the animal as comfortable as possible and apply 
mustard and water to the lower part of the neck and sides. I have found that 
good results follow the giving of injections of soap suds to open the bowels,* 
but you must avoid purging. You will find treatment for this ailment given 
in the horse department but give larger doses to the cow than are prescribed 
for the horse. 

HOOSE— HUSK— FILARIA BRONCHITIS.— This is an ailment that 
affects young animals more than aged ones and is brought on by young calveS 
or lambs swallowing parasites in egg form which, when meeting the heat 
and moisture of the body, soon grow and develop into small, slender, thread- 
like worms which fill up the air passages and if not treated produce death. 

SYMPTOMS — The coughing up of worms is very often the first means 



•CATTLE— DISEASES OF RESPIRATORY ORGANS. 135 

nf knowing what the ailment is. The coat becomes dry, a suffocating sort 
of breathing soon sets in and a husky cough follows. 

TREATMENT* — Fee4 plenty of grain, vegetables and grass. Give one 
ounce of turpentine in twelve ounces of raw linseed oil at a dose twice a 
day for a few days, then once daily for a few days if you believe it is neces- 
sary to continue the treatment. Place all the infected animals in a closed 
building and then put small quantities of sulphur on a hot shovel. This will 
make fumes which will kill the worms by being breathed but, for fear of suffo- 
cation, the attendant should remain in the building with the cattle. 

CATARRH— COLD IN THE HEAD.— Catarrh or cold in the head is a 
congestion, irritation or inflammation of the lining membrane of the nose 
and passages of the head, sometimes extending to the throat and eyes. 

CAUSES. — Windy, dusty weather, damp stables, exposure to storms 
when the weather has changed from hot to cold, or allowing cattle to stand 
in a draft after severe exercise are causes of this disease. 

SYMPTOMS. — There is a slight rise of temperature, sometimes a cough, 
generally some sneezing, a watery discharge from the nose and this dis- 
charge soon becomes thicker, the eyes are somewhat swollen and generally 
inflamed, the limbs are cold and also the tips of the horns, the pulse is 
quickened, the appetite is poor and the bowels are usually constipated. 

TREATMENT. — Place the animal in a warm, clean, dry and comfort- 
able stable and give one-half to one pound of epsom salts to open the bowels. 
One dose may be sufficient but if not repeat the dose in 24 hours. Also 
give 15-drop doses of tincture of aconite every three hours to reduce the fever 
and feed cooling, laxative foods. If necessary to steam the head follow treat- 
ment for catarrh in horses. 

CHRONIC CATARRH— NASAL GLEET.— This is very often the re- 
sult of neglected simple nasal catarrh or cold in the head and sometimes it 
becomes contagious. 

CAUSES. — It is generally caused by neglected cases of nasal catarrh 
that terminate in nasal gleet or a sort of malignant catarrh which is per- 
haps due to small organisms similar to bacteria. 

SYMPTOMS. — The nose is hot and dry; sometimes the animal chills; 
the eyes are sore, inflamed and generally closed ; there is loss of appetite ; the 
urine is scanty and the bowels costive. There is a high temperature, great 
thirst, coughing, a sloughing of the membranes of the mouth and the breath 
is generally fetid. 

TREATMENT. — It is always good judgment to remove a sick animal 
that shows the above symptoms to a place by itself for fear of its infecting 
others. Give one and one-fourth or one and one-half pounds of epsom salts 
to open the bowels. Also give aconite or acetanilide to reduce the fever. 
Steam with creosote and hot water and give any good home tonic. Remem- 
ber these cases take time to recover. 

MALIGNANT CATARRH.— This is a condition of the upper air pas- 
sages attended with offensive discharges from the nose and sometimes with 
sloughing. The disease is generally contagious. 

CAUSES. — It is no doubt caused by some sort of minute organisms, 
but just what they are no one appears to know. 

SYMPTOMS. — It is usually ushered in with a chill followed by fever. 
The muzzle is dry, the animal is dull and dumpish, the eyes are almost 
closed and somewhat swollen, the saliva drools from the mouth and the eyes 



136 THE PEOPLE'S HOME STOCK BOOK. 

and nose discharge freely. The pulse is quick and weak, the cough increases, 
the bowels are generally costive or else too loose and the animal has great 
thirst but no appetite for food. The breath becomes fetid, the membranes 
highly inflamed and the passages of the head become stopped up. In many 
cases during the last stage there is quite extensive sloughing, great weak- 
ness and also a considerable fall of temperature. The eyeballs very often 
burst and death may result in ten days. 

TREATMENT.— The animal should be kept away from all others and 
if it is summer time should be put in a cool place and if in winter kept warm. 
Give a pound or more of epsom salts in a quart or two of water to move the 
bowels and if very feverish give one dram of acetanilide and one ounce of 
alcohol in a pint of water at a dose four times a day ; or, give thirty drops of 
fluid extract of aconite at a dose three or four times a day until the fever 
subsides. Also give one-half ounce of nitrate of potash at a dose in feed or 
water twice daily. Drop one ounce of carbolic acid or creosote into two 
quarts of water and keep the mixture hot enough to generate steam, which 
is to be directed into the nostrils three times a day for ten or fifteen minutes 
at a time. If you can arrange to direct the steam through a tube into one 
nostril at a time it will be all the better. As soon as the animal begins to 
recover give a good condition powder or tonic. 

PEOPLE'S HOME REMEDIES FOR MALIGNANT CATARRHAL 

FEVER.— 

1. Steaming. — Give injections to move the bowels and every four hours 
give two ounces of sweet spirits of nitre in a pint of water. The cow should 
be made to inhale steam arising from a bucket of hot water to which has 
been added a tablespoonful or two of carbolic acid. 

SORE THROAT— LARYNGITIS.— Laryngitis, or sore throat, is an in- 
flammation of the larynx. 

CAUSES. — It is caused by coming out of a warm stable and standing in 
a cold draft or by exposure to cold storms of rain or snow. 

SYMPTOMS. — Inability to eat or drink easily, breathing quicker, pulse 
more rapid with some fever, some drooling from the mouth, more or less 
dullness and a cough are symptoms of sore throat. 

TREATMENT. — Apply equal parts of turpentine, aqua ammonia and 
sweet oil to the throat twice daily or apply antiphlogistine. Steam the head 
or dissolve one-fourth ounce of chlorate of potash in a quart of water and 
wash the throat three times a day. 

MALIGNANT SORE THROAT.— Malignant sore throat in animals is 
very much like quinsy in man and it very often proves fatal. 

CAUSES. — It is no doubt the result of some sort of infection ; however, 
it is not well understood. 

SYMPTOMS. — The early symptoms are very much like those of colds 
and distemper or simple sore throat. The mucous membranes inflame, the 
throat swells a great deal, the mouth is kept open, the tongue is covered 
with purple-like spots and the animal soon shows great weakness. 

TREATMENT. — Steam the head with either creosote or carbolic acid 
and apply equal parts of turpentine, tincture of cantharides, aqua ammonia 
and raw linseed oil to the throat twice a day for two days ; also poultice the 
throat. Put tvyo drams of chlorate of potash and a teaspoonful of chloride 
of iron into four ounces of water and wash the throat every three hours.

DISEASES OF THE URINARY ORGANS. 

(Including Diseases of the Kidneys and Bladder.) 



INFLAMMATION OF THE KIDNEYS— NEPHRITIS.— This aihnent 
is not very common in the ox and is generally brought on by injury of some 
kind, giving too strong diuretic medicine or eating acrid plants which act 
on the kidneys. 

SYMPTOMS. — The symptoms are: colicky pains, uneasiness, passing 
small quantities of highly-colored urine, straddling, loss of appetite, arched 
back, sweating, quick breathing and quick pulse. The animal is weak and 
becomes more stupid. 

TREATMENT. — Give a dose of epsom salts, not less than one pound; 
also a pint or two of raw linseed oil. Apply hot blankets to loins or mustard 
and water or hot poultices. Give 15 drops of tincture of aconite and a tea- 
spoonful of fluid extract of belladonna at a dose three or four times a day. 

KIDNEY AILMENTS.— (See " Horse Department.") 

INFLAMMATION OF THE BLADDER— CYSTITIS.— The mucous 
membrane of the bladder frequently inflames ; however, the entire organ sel- 
dom does. 

CAUSES. — Any disturbance of the digestive organs and eating infected 
food or food which makes the urine acid instead of alkaline, are likely to 
irritate the mucous membrane of the bladder. It also follows calculi, or 
giving strong drugs that act harshly on the urinary organs and it also 
follows a retention or holding of the urine too long. 

SYMPTOMS. — There is loss of appetite, a rise of temperature, uneasi- 
ness, quick pulse and the urine is highly colored. Passing the hand into 
the rectum and pressing against the bladder produces pain. When the attack 
is severe and proper treatment is not given the animal soon dies from 
weakness. 

TREATMENT. — Give one pound of epsom salts, apply hot blankets to 
the loins and flush out the bladder of cows with warm water. Give small doses 
of lithia in water or linseed tea. 

RED WATER— H.ffiMATURIA.— This is a condition where either 
blood or the coloring matter of the blood is passing off by way of the kidneys. 

CAUSES. — It is very often the result of an injury, calculi in the kid- 
neys or bladder, eating poor food or poisonous plants, a specific disease such 
as Texas fever ; or,it may result from giving irritating drugs. 

TREATMENT.— If caused by poor food, make a change. Study the 
cause and treat accordingly. If caused by calculi, crush or remove them. 
Give tonics and such food as is recommended for indigestion. Iron, quinine, 
gentian, quassia or cod liver oil and good care will help all cases of red water 
in cattle. 

DIABETES-INSIPIDUS OR PROFUSE URINATION.— The passing 
of enormous quantities of urine is generally called diabetes if the urine is of 
a clear, water-like color. 

CAUSES. — The causes are : eating acrid diuretic plants ; giving too much 

l^8 



CATTLE— DISEASES OF URINARY ORGANS. 139 

sugar-producing food or swill; feeding musty, badly-cured fodder; or eating 
frozen food. 

TREATMENT.— Change the food supply. Give one dram of iodide of 
potassium at a dose in either food or water three times a day; also give 
one-ounce doses of fluid extract of ergot twice a day, but be sure it is fresh 
medicine. If the appetite is poor give one dram of ground nux vomica, one- 
half ounce of gentian and one ounce of ginger at a dose two or three times 
a day. 

UR.ffiMIA. — This is where the urine is reabsorbed into the system, 
causing an excess of urea and of course blood poisoning. 

SYMPTOMS. — Smell the skin and it has the odor of urine; besides, the 
animal has a dull, sick appearance. 

TREATMENT. — Draw off the urine if the animal fails to pass it, give 
lithia in one-ounce doses, or give one ounce of fluid extract or powdered 
buchu leaves at a dose four times a day and a mild dose of epsom salts. If 
the animal is weak give two or three-ounce doses of liquor ammonia acetatis 
and be sure that this medicine is made fresh before you give it or it will 
do no good. Feed easily-digested food and keep the bowels open. 

GRAVEL— CALCULI— STONE IN THE BLADDER.— It is not un- 
usual to find calculi in the bladder or pelvis of the kidney in animals that 
pasture on limestone land or drink water that comes through limestone rock. 

SYMPTOMS. — There is difficulty in passing the urine and the water 
is usually tinged with blood. Certain kinds of food appear to favor the forma- 
tion of calculi in the bladder. 

TREATMENT. — When an operation is necessary you had better call 
a veterinari-an, unless the stone can be crushed by hand. By passing the 
hand into the rectum the stone can usually be found. In some cases it is 
necessary to cut them out. 

TAPPING THE BLADDER OF THE OX OR BULL.— In cases where 
there is a stopping of the water it can be drawn off by cutting into the urethra 
just below the anus where the urethra turns over the angle of the pelvis. Be 
sure to make no larger opening than is absolutely necessary to admit the 
catheter. The wound should be well looked after and healed quickly. Apply 
equal parts of iodoform, boric acid and powdered alum twice a day. 

INCONTINENCE OF URINE— ENURESIS.— This ailment is usu- 
ally the result of paralysis of the muscle at the neck of the bladder and on 
account of its relaxed condition the urine leaks out of the bladder and drib- 
bles away from the animal. 

TREATMENT. — If the animal is in a weakened condition give it plenty 
of nourishing food and give one dram of fluid extract of nux vomica at a 
ciose in feed three times a day. Also give one ounce of lithia at a dose in 
feed three times a day, and apply mustard plasters to the back every two 
days. I have known cold applications to the back to produce good results 
in some cases ; however, they should not be kept on too long. 



DISEASES OF THE GENERATIVE ORGANS. 

(Including Pregnancy, Calving and All Attending Difficulties, Diseases of 
the Vagina and Womb, Milk Fever, Garget, Diseases of the New-born 
Calf, Spaying, Barrenness of Cows and Bulls, Castration, Etc.) 



THE GENITAL ORGANS OF THE COW.— 

THE OVARIES. — The ovaries of the cow are generally found to be 
smaller than in the mare but are much the same in all other respects. 

THE WOMB, VAGINA, ETC.— The womb of the cow differs from the 
mare's not so much in shape as in that the inner surface is covered with 
" cotyledons " or button-like bodies which are small when the cow is not 
pregnant but are quite large near calving time. The afterbirth or placenta 
is attached to these buttons. The vagina of the cow is shorter than in the 
mare. The vulva is almost the same, but the clitoris is generally smaller 
in the cow than in the mare. 

THE UDDER, MILK BAG OR MAMMARY GLAND.— This is di- 
vided into halves and each half is again divided. All four quarters secrete 
milk and drop it into a pouch which is situated just above the teats. Dairy- 
men should study the udder for here is where they have lots of trouble ; there- 
fore, they cannot know too mucl» about the udder. 

GESTATION IN COWS.— It can be safely stated that a cow, if in a 
normal condition, will carry the calf between two hundred and eighty and 
two hundred and ninety days or between nine and nine and one-half months. 
There are cases on record where cows have carried their calves eleven months 
and it is said that the produce is usually male when the cow carries her calf 
beyond nine and one-half months. 

PREGNANCY AND HOW TO TELL IT.— When the cow is in good 
health she comes in heat every third week when not pregnant but of course 
there are exceptional cases. When pregnant she generally ceases to come in 
heat, becomes quieter, feeds better and is generally more thrifty and after 
a few weeks she begins to enlarge in the right flank and after the fifth or 
sixth month the calf will be seen to kick after the cow has taken a drink of 
cold water; or, by pressing the hand against the right flank a solid object 
can be felt and besides, if the hand is put into the rectum the calf may be 
felt. Young cows spring some four months before calving, the udder grad- 
ually increasing in size until parturition, but older cows do not make much 
bag until five or six weeks, or even less, before calving. 

SYMPTOMS JUST PREVIOUS TO PARTURITION OR CALVING. 
— The vulva usually swells within a few days of calving and the udder fills 
gradually for a few weeks, but usually fills full and becomes hard within two 
or three days of calving and perhaps the most noticeable symptom is a 
falling away on each side of the hips close to the tail. When these symptoms 
appear the cow should be put into a comfortable place and away from other 
cattle or animals that may excite her. 

DIFFICULT CALVING— DIFFICULT FOALING— MALPRESEN- 
TATION. — If a mare or cow be in a healthy condition and strong and

CATTLE— DISEASES GF GENERATIVE ORGANS. Wl 

vigorous she will seldom experience any trouble in foaling or calving. Some- 
times labor pains come on before the mouth of the womb has relaxed and in 
such cases the hand should be passed, using the thumb and finger at first 
and later the hand, to dilate the opening into the womb. Before passing the 
hand the nails should be cut short and made smooth and the hand oiled 
with one part carbolic acid and ten parts vaseline or sweet oil. It also as- 
sists matters to smear the neck of the womb with equal parts of fluid ex- 
tract of belladonna and vaseline to assist in relaxing the parts. The normal 
position for a foal or calf to come is the forefeet first with the nose between 
the knees and when the mother is unable to expel the foetus assistance can 
be given her but it should be done gently for if not the colt or calf may be 
killed; besides, she should be assisted most when making an effort herself. 
Never pull on a colt or calf unless you are sure that you are pulling on both 
forefeet or both hind ones for unless you are a delivery cannot be accom- 
plished. In some cases the colt or calf will be found dropsical, making it 
impossible for the foetus to pass. In these cases push the foetus back and 
tap its belly with a knife, then assist in the delivery. In other cases water 
is found in the head of the foetus and these cases also require tapping. The 
swelling is usually in the top of the head. The operation is best done with 
a trocar or small knife. A foal or calf may come with the forefeet and 
head turned back, or a forefoot and a hind one may come. Sometimes the 
head will appear and the forefeet be turned back and at other times all four 
feet appear to come together with the head turned back. Now, in order to 
deliver the colt or calf in these cases, the hind quarters of the animal should 
be raised eight or ten inches higher than the fore quarters and the foetus 
should be pushed back and placed in position and then either taken away nor- 
mally or with the hind feet first. It is always good practice to tie soft 
pieces of rope around the head and feet before the foetus is pushed back 
into the uterus, but of course mark your ropes to know whether it is the 
head, a forefoot or a hind one. Keep in mind that there may be twins as 
these cases do sometimes occur in the mare and more frequently in the cow 
and when they do they are rather puzzling; consequently, a thorough ex- 
amination should be made and good judgment used. After taking away 
the first one the second one usually comes away easily. Sometimes you will 
meet with deformities which may also puzzle you but whatever is done should 
be done without force, for the inner walls of the womb and vagina are easily 
lacerated or torn ; besides, it is an easy matter to infect the mother. There- 
fore, be clean and use antiseptics and disinfectants freely. It is well to 
keep in mind that if the mare does not deliver foal within an hour or less 
after the labor commences there is something wrong; therefore, the case 
should be looked into right away for if looked after early she can be assisted 
much more easily and understandingly than if you delay. Besides, by being 
prompt you can very often save the mare or cow and the produce.

Whenever the afterbirth does not come away in twelve or twenty-four 
hours it should be taken away by hand. 

CAUSES. — Failure to clean properly is very often the result of prema- 
ture parturition; poverty of the animal; too hurried delivery; adhesions 
which are the result of pre-existing inflammation in the womb ; or, it may 
be the result of a failure to establish sufficient contraction of the uterus. 
If not temoved it rots away, causing irritation, a putrid condition, a nasty 



143 THE PEOPLE'S HOME STOCK BOOK. 

vaginal discharge, a rapid loss of condition and shrinkage in milk; besides, 
there may be absorption of putrid matter and a poisoning of the animal. 

TREATMENT. — Give a mild dose of epsom salts tc open the bowels. 
Tying a light weight to the afterbirth assists in stimulating the womb to 
contraction and expulsion of the afterbirth. The most satisfactory method 
is to remove it by hand in not less than twenty- four hours after parturition, 
before the mouth of womb has closed. The hand should be well oiled with 
one part carbolic acid and ten parts vaseline and be sure to cut the finger 
nails, making them smooth to prevent wounding the uterus or vagina. The 
protruding membranes should be gently pulled upon with the left hand 
while the right hand should be introduced into the womb and the connecting 
cotyledons or buttons crushed off from their connections with the womb. 
This process may be slow for there are many of these buttons but it will pay 
to take time enough to do the work properly. In operating, care should be 
taken not to injure the inner wall of the uterus and the work should be done 
thoroughly so as to prevent sloughing and a sub-acute inflammation of the 
uterus. To prevent a retention of the afterbirth try to guard against abor- 
tion and avoid having poverty stricken animals. All thin cows should be 
well fed for two or three weeks before calving and if this is done they will 
clean much better than if they are in a debilitated condition when they are 
calving. 

PEOPLE'S HOME REMEDIES FOR RETENTION OF AFTER- 
BIRTH.— 

1. Saltpeter or Epsom Salts. — If the cow does not clean properly give a 
tablespoonful of saltpeter three times a day; or, give ^4: pound epsom salts 
twice a dav until the bowels move freely and afterbirth comes away. 

CLOSING OF THE NECK OF THE WOMB AT CALVING.— It is 
not unusual when labor pains come on to find the neck of the womb not yet 
relaxed, making it impossible for the delivery of the calf. 

SYMPTOMS. — Lack of results from labor pains should lead to an exam- 
ination by hand which would reveal the fact that the neck of the womb is 
closed. 

TREATMENT. — Saturate a soft piece of sponge or cloth with extract 
of belladonna, tie a string to it, push it into the neck of the womb and leave 
it there for a few hours ; but if the neck of the uterus can be dilated with the 
hand without using too much force, do so and the cow will perhaps have 
her calf with little if any assistance. When the belladonna is applied the 
animal should be given ounce doses of chloral hydrate in a pint or two of 
water every threS hours ; or, give one-half ounce of fluid extract of opium to 
quiet her pains until the belladonna relaxes and opens the neck of the womb. 

FLOODING— UTERINE HEMORRHAGE.— Hemorrhage very often 
occurs when a calf has been removed or when the cow is extremely weak. It 
may be the result of protracted labor or bungling assistance during parturi- 
tion, or it may follow a removal of the afterbirth. 

TREATMENT. — Pour cold water over the loins or inject some cold water 
into the womb, using a rubber tube and funnel; or, dissolve two ounces of 
alum in a quart of water and pour this solution in and, if this does not check 
the hemorrhage, fill the entire uterus with an alum solution of this same 
strength, closing the vulva or elevating the hind quarters so that the fluid 
will remain in the womb. Give one ounce of fluid extract of ergot at a dose 
every thirty or forty minutes until the hemorrhage ceases. After the bleeding 
has stopped the uterus should be washed out with clean water, using one part 



CATTLE— DISEASES OF GENERATIVE ORGANS. 143 

carbolic acid to a hundred parts water. The animal should be kept perfectly 
quiet for twenty-four hours. 

EVERSION OF THE VAGINA.— (See " Horse Department.") 

EVERSION OF THE WOMB— WOMB OR CALF-BED TURNED 
INSIDE OUT. — This is a turning inside-out of the womb, brought on very 
often by the cow's lying with her hind parts too low and also by a con- 
tinuation of the after-pains or a careless removal of the afterbirth and it 
sometimes occurs in weak cows at time of calving, from coughing or from 
over-feeding with bulky food. These all have a tendency to crowd out the 
uterus. 

SYMPTOMS, — There is a protrusion of the uterus through the vagina 
to a greater or less extent. 

TREATMENT. — By promptly calling a competent veterinarian the cow's 
life is often saved, unless the farmer or dairyman will use cleanliness and 
good judgment in replacing the womb without injury. First of all, place the 
cow with the forequarters about a foot lower than the hind ones and spread 
a clean sheet or towel that has been dipped in one part carbolic acid and fifty 
parts water or one part corrosive sublimate and one thousand parts tepid 
water. Clean the everted portion and hind parts of the cow by pouring on 
either of these preparations. The uterus should be supported with this sheet 
or towel, an assistant holding each end while the veterinarian or dairyman 
gently returns the parts to their normal place. Apply a surcingle snugly 
around the body at the flank, put two or three stitches in upper portion of 
vulva and keep her in the position I have suggested and also keep her from 
straining by giving her one-ounce doses of chloral hydrate and two-dram doses 
of fluid extract belladonna, or four-dram doses of fluid extract of opium, every 
five or six hours or as often as necessary to keep her q.uiet. Dissolve two 
ounces of sugar of lead and one ounce of carbolic acid in a gallon of water 
and wash out the vagina through a rubber hose with a funnel at the end, 
twice a day. Give her good care and plenty of nourishing food that is not 
too bulky. Now just a word of caution : Be very careful not to puncture a hole 
in the uterus or lacerate it. Be sure to have no sharp finger nails or dirty 
hands when you return the parts. Be sure that she has recovered before 
you allow her to run around or lie down with the hind parts too low. 

CESAREAN OPERATION.— This is an operation whereby the calf 
is taken through the side of the cow. It is sometimes desirable to perform this 
operation in case of accident to the cow or mare, especially if they are thor- 
oughbreds, for the purpose of saving their produce; besides, in difficult and 
impossible cases of delivery as a last resort this operation is performed. As 
this work is difficult it should never be attempted by any other person than a 
capable veterinary surgeon or physician. If the cow is exhausted and in a 
high state of inflammation her life cannot be saved but the calf can. In 
case the mother has just died, any person may operate and it is astonishing 
to know how successful dairymen are but I have never known inexperienced 
persons to operate and save both cow and calf. 

RUPTURE OF THE WOMB. — A rupture of the womb seldom occurs 
unless a cow is roughly handled by hands or with instruments. However, it 
does occasionally occur when it is hard to tell the exact cause. The feet are 
sometimes pulled in such a way, when assisting in the delivery of the calf, as 
to rupture the uterus. When it occurs the bowels may protrude through the 
opening, causing hemorrhage. 



144 THE PEOPLE'S HOME STOCK BOOK. 

TREATMENT. — ^If an eversion takes place, close the womb by stitching 
the tear closely with catgut, then return it to place, using solutions of one 
part carbolic acid to two hundred parts water and if the animal shows much 
pain give one-ounce doses of chloral hydrate or one ounce of fluid extract of 
opium at a dose, every three or four hours, until pain ceases. 

DROPSY OF THE WOMB BEFORE CALVING.— This is caused by 
a derangement of the fcetal membranes and there must be an excessive 
amount of fluid secreted around the foetus. 

SYMPTOMS. — The belly of the cow grows to be unusually large but the 
fluid usually comes away at the proper time without doing any harm. 

TREATMENT. — Feed the cow well and see that she has daily exercise ; 
if she is weak, give tonics. 

DROPSY OR SWELLING OF THE BELLY BEFORE PARTURI- 
TION.— (See " Horse Department.") 

PARALYSIS OF THE HIND QUARTERS BEFORE CALVING.— 
Thin, weak, emaciated cows that are poorly fed and not sheltered sometimes 
lose the proper use of their hind quarters and are unable to get up without 
assistance. 

TREATMENT. — Apply mustard and water to the back every day or two 
and give a tablespoonful or two of the following compound powder at a. dose 
in feed three times a day. The powder is made by mixing ground gentian 
root, ground ginger, powdered saltpeter, baking soda, ground nux vomica and 
powdered charcoal. Also increase the animal's food supply, not forgetting to 
feed her some vegetables. ' 

PARALYSIS AFTER CALVING.— This consists in either a partial or 
complete loss of power of the hind quarters after calving. It is caused by 
weakness or pressure from an unusually large calf. 

TREATMENT. — Apply mustard and water to the back ; blanket warm ; 
feed on nourishing, laxative food and milk the cow four times a day. Also 
give two-dram doses of fluid extract of nux vomica and three drams of citrate 
of potash at a dose three times a day. Apply equal parts turpentine, aqua 
ammonia and sweet oil to the back daily if the mustard and water does not 
produce the desired results. 

MILK FEVER— PARTURIENT APOPLEXY.— In this disease there 
is a congested condition of the brain and spinal cord and in every case it 
follows the act of parturition and as a rule seldom attacks a cow until after 
she has had two or more calves and it seems to be a disease which afifects 
cows more than any other animals. It seldom attacks light milkers but usu- 
ally selects the very best milk producers. Until within a few years it has been 
considered a fatal disease. High feeding, under-exercising and a plethoric 
condition leading up to apoplexy are doubtless predisposing causes. It in- 
variably follows an easy parturition and a rapid emptying of the udder. It 
seldom, if ever, follows abortion and rarely occurs in a poorly-fed and de- 
bilitated cow. Following the latest methods of treatment a recovery gener- 
ally takes place rapidly. The second attack is more likely to prove fatal than 
the first attack. 

SYMPTOMS. — The first symptoms noticed may be tjie decrease in 
milk flow, some dullness, holding the head low, loss of appetite and a disin- 
clination to move. The cow pays no attention to her calf and walks with an 
unsteady gait. The base of the horns and the poll are unusually hot but the 
surface of the body is colder than usual. The bowels become constipated,

CATTLE-DISEASES OF GENERATIVE ORGANS. 145 

the urine, if passed, is scanty and the bowel discharges are covered -vrith 
mucus. The cow soon falls to the ground and becomes excited trying to rise. 
She throws her head about for a while but soon assumes a comatose state as 
though asleep. The eyes are glassy and not sensitive. The head is usually 
turned to one side and when pulled out straight she soon flops it back to tha 
former position. She is usually bloated and the bladder is full. The disease 
may set m one hour after calving but usually occurs one, two or three days 
afterwards, seldom occurring later than ten days. The earlier it appears, I 
believe the more fatal it is. However, some cases that develop slowly term- 
inate in death. 

TREATMENT.— The treatment of milk fever in cattle has changed 
within the past few ^ears and a reliable remedy has at last been found. The 
" oxygen " or what is commonly known as the " air treatment," if applied in 
lime, will save ninety-five per cent, of the cows suffering with milk fever. 
The old treatment of blood-letting, giving large doses of cathartic medicine 
or whiskey or ammonia and applying mustard and turpentine to the back 
or using other strong liniments, also giving chloral hydrate and bromide of 
potash, was thought to be beneficial. However, it is not necessary in most 
cases to give drugs. Several years ago, Schmidt of Kolding, advised filling 
the udder with a sterilized solution of potassium iodide as soon as possible and 
tiis new treatment gave fairly good results. However, it is not much practised 
now. Sometimes a salt solution is used instead, but the air treatment gives 
much the best results. The iodide of potassium solution is made by dissolv- 
ing two drams of iodide of potassium in a pint of clean boiled water and is 
injected into the four quarters, four ounces into each quarter of the udder. 
When called to treat a case, or if you do it yourself at home, first place the 
cow m a clean place, wash her udder with soap and water, wipe it clean, 
pour over a little alcohol or disinfectant, such as one part carbolic acid to 
fifty parts of water, or one part coal-tar disinfectant and thirty parts watet. 
If you have oxygen at hand, use it; if not, fill the udder with clean sterilized 
air, but not until you have milked all the milk out of the udder. Be sure to 
knead the udder in order that it may be inflated thoroughly. Tie a tape 
around the neck of each teat to prevent the air from escaping. If the cow does 
not recover in five or six hours, repeat the air treatment. The teat tube 
should be clean. If you give the cow stimulants or any medicine it must be 
done through a rubber tube for if not the medicine is likely to go dawn the 
windpipe and bring on bronchial pneumonia. Cold water applied to the head 
is aJways helpful. The body should be kept warm and the legs hand rubbed. 
Never empty a cow's udder too soon after calving. Don't overfeed a fat 
cow before calving. Keep the bowels open and exercise her. In using the 
air treatment, if you have a milking tube and a common bicycle pump and no 
other appliances, .use them, but try to blow pure air into the udder. 
PEOPLE'S HOME REMEDIES FOR MILK FEVER.— 

1. Fresh Water. — Immediately after calving see that the cow has plenty 
of fresh water to drink. Do not give too much at a dose but a pailful at short 
intervals. This is a preventive of milk fever. 

2. Proper Feeding.— Feed but half the usual quantity of grain for two 
weeks before calving. For twenty-four hours after calving give nothing but 
fresh water, then begin with half ration and gradually increase the allowance. 
If adhered to this treatment will prevent milk fever. 

3. Soapsuds, Turpentine and Lard. — Move the bowels with injections 

3-10 



146 THE PEOPLE'S HOME STOCK BOOK. 

of warm soapsuds and to the back and udder apply a mixture of one part tUj- 
pentine and six parts lard twice a day for two days. 

4. Salts, Lard and Ginger. — To a quart of warm lard add a pound of 
epsom salts and an ounce of pulverized ginger and give as a drench. 

PUERPERAL FEVER.— This is a fever that often follows calving. It is 
brought on by exposure to cold and wet storms or by want of proper nourish- 
ment before calving. Young heifers, when they first come fresh, seem to be 
affected more frequently than older cows. 

SYMPTOMS. — There is a quick pulse, high temperature, somewhat red- 
dened mucous membranes, a lessened milk flow and the udder may be hot and 
tender. 

TREATMENT. — Give a medium-sized dose of epsom salts and give ten 
drops of tincture of aconite every three hours until the fever reduces. Feed 
vegetables and slops instead of grain. In many cases it will not be necessary 
to give any medicine. 

INFLAMMATION OF THE VAGINA— VAGINITIS.— This is an in- 
flammation of the vagina and is generally the result of lacerations or injuries 
of some kind during calving. 

SYMPTOMS. — ^There is always more or less swelling and an inflamed 
condition of the lining membrane with some mucus discharge. 

TREATMENT. — Mi-Id cases require little or no treatment. Inject some 
of the following lotion into the vagina two or three times a day — naix sugar 
of lead, one ounce and carbolic acid, two drams, with a gallon of water. This 
makes a useful application for such cases. Or, dissolve two ounces of pow- 
dered alum in a gallon of water or two drams of permanganate of potash in a 
gallon of water, or dissolve one-half pound of hypo-sulphite of soda in a 
gallon of water. Any of these makes a good application. However, in the 
treatment of su-ch cases it is a good plan to change the treatment every few 
days. If the bowels are costive feed laxative food and give epsom salts and 
if the kidneys do not act freely give a tablespoonful of citrate of potash or 
powdered saltpeter at a dose two or three times a day. 

INFLAMMATION OF THE WOMB— METRITIS.— This occurs a few 
days after calving, It is caused by the animal's getting wet or standing in a 
cold draft or it comes from the wrong kind of assistance during calving when 
infected hands and instruments have been used. It also follows eversion of 
the womb. 

SYMPTOMS. — There is coldness of the extremities and surface of the 
body at first, followed by quick breathing and high fever. There is also loss 
of appetite and rumination ceases. There is some swelling of the vagina and 
the passage of blood-like mucus. The bowels are usually constipated and the 
animal stands with the back arched. By passing the hand into the rectum, 
the womb will be found swollen and tender. The milk flow diminishes and 
in some cases the cow becomes unconscious and shows symptoms of milk 
fever. 

TREATMENT.— Treatment must be both local and internal. Give a 
laxative of epsom salts or linseed oil. Give ten drops of fluid extract of aconite 
and a teaspoonful of fluid extract of belladonna at a dose in a pint of cold 
wafer as a drench three or four times a day. Apply wet cloths to the bead 
and hot blankets to the loins and if she is very feverish give one-dram doses 
of acetanilide four or five times a day and use the same injections recommended 
for vaginitis. 



CATTLE— DISEASES OF GENERATIVE ORGANS. 147 

WHITES— LEUCORRHEA.— This is a chronic inflammation of the 
womb and vagina. 

_ CAUSES.— It very often follows injuries sustained while the cow is being 
assisted in calving. It also follows a retention of the afterbirth and it very 
often follows abortion and sometimes results from wearing a pessary to pre- 
vent eversion of the vagina or womb. 

SYMPTOMS.- -There is a white discharge of more or less offensive 
mucus with some swelling of the vagina and vulva. There is also some shrink- 
age in milk and loss of flesh. The cow very often comes in heat too often and 
remains in heat longer than she otherwise would. In other cases she may 
not come in heat at all. By introducing the hand into the rectum the womb 
will be found somewhat enlarged. 

TREATMENT.— As a rule mild astringents and antiseptic washes are 
proper remedies. First wash out the vagina and uterus with warm water 
usmg a rubber tube with a funnel at the end. If the neck of the womb is 
closed it willbe found necessary to dilate it in order to let the medicine come 
in contact with the inflamed parts. Dissolve one ounce of sugar of lead or 
one ounce of sulphate of iron, or three drams -of permanganate of potash, or 
six ounces of hypo-sulphite of soda, or six drams of sulphate of zinc, or three 
ounces of powdered alum in a gallon of tepid water. Or, put six drams of 
carbolic acid and two ounces of glycerine into a gallon of water and use any 
one of the above solutions freely once a day until the discharge has almost 
ceased, then it will not be necessary to use the medicine so often. Feed less of 
vegetables and more grain ; also give mineral tonics such as iron, copper and 
arsenic. 

ABORTION— CONTAGIOUS ABORTION.— What is understood by 
abortion is the expulsion of the foetus before it is properly matured and at a 
time when it will not live outside of its mother. Abortion is perhaps most 
common in cows; however, it affects mares, sows and ewes. There are two 
common causes — accidents and contagion. If accidental and the animal cleans 
properly, bad results do not generally follow. However, if a miscarriage is 
due to either acute or chronic contagious abortion it should be regarded 
seriously for it is no easy matter to stamp this disease out of a herd. Cows 
affected with acute abortion may lose one, two or three calves and later the 
disease becomes chronic; then the cows may carry their calves nearly to if 
not to the full time. Cows suffering from chronic abortion do not as a rule 
yield as much milk as if they were in a healthy condition. Cows affected 
with accidental abortion usually show some effects of the accident but no well 
marked symptoms of abortion. But if due to contagion, little red patches can 
be seen on the lining membrane of the vulva; besides, if the herd bull is 
affected he usually has some catarrhal discharge. The germs of contagious 
abortion can be found in the genital organs of the cow and perhaps in the 
blood. Thev are also found in the stables where the animals are housed. 

TREATMENT.— The genital organs of the cow and bull should be 
washed out with an antiseptic solution of some kind. Unless these germs are 
killed, not only in the animal but about the premises, especially the back part 
of stalls, you may expect future trouble and financial losses. Apply one part 
of carbolic acid and fifty parts of water, or one part corrosive sublimate to 
one thousand parts water, or one part chloride of zinc and one thousand 
parts water, or one part coal-tar disinfectant and thirty or forty parts water. 
Whichever lotion you use it should be injected or poured through a small 



148 THE PEOPLE'S HOME STOCK BOOK. 

rubber tube with a funnel at the end and not less than three or four pints 
should be used at a time. Repeat once a day until the discharge ceases and 
the lining membrane appears normal. These same lotions will do for stall, 
floor and external hind parts of the cow. Whitewash is another useful thing 
to apply to stall and floor. Never forget the importance of separating the 
sick cow from the rest of the herd as soon as she aborts. Be thorough in the 
treatment of every cow that calves too soon. Some veterinarians are inclined 
to believe that the serum treatment, administered with a hypodermic syringe 
to desti^oy the germs in the mother's blood and system, is the only correct and 
reliable method of destroying this contagion. However, I must say that it 
has not given me satisfactory results and a majority of the veterinarians hold 
the same opinion. 

PEOPLE'S HOME REMEDIES FOR PREVENTION OF ABORTION.— 
, 1. Salt and Carbolic Acid.— Thoroughly mix % ounce of pure carbolic 
acid with a quart of salt. This quantity should be divided among four cows 
twice a month. 

2. Contagious Abortion. — Once a day give each cow 15 drops of car- 
bolic acid diluted in three pints of water. This may be sprinkled in the feed 
and should be continued for two months. Also inject into the vagina an 
ounce of lysol diluted with three quarts of warm water. This should be done 
once or twice a week for five or six weeks. 

NYMPHOMANIA. — This is an unnatural desire on the part of the cow 
to have intercourse with a bull, she seemingly being constantly in season. 
When mated she seldom comes with calf and if she does she usually aborts. 

TREATMENT. — Feeding rich stimulating food tends to make tlie cow 
worse. If caused by catarrh of the genital tract use cooling astringents, such 
as are recommended for leucorrhea but if the ovaries are diseased, spay her. 
Give a teaspoonful of saltpeter, a teaspoonful of fluid extract of belladonna 
and one-half teaspoonful of camphor at a dose in feed twice a day. 

GARGET— MAMMITIS— INFLAMMATION OF THE UDDER.— 
This is a swelling accompanied bv in inflammation of the udder of mammary 
gland and resulting in what is ca' garget, or caked bag. This usually occurs 
near the time of parturition but may appear at any time while the cOw is 
giving milk. 

CAUSES. — It is caused by anything that will produce an irritation of the 
bag such as an injury by a bruise, kick, blow, one animal stepping on the 
udder of another, exposure to cold winds, lying on wet frozen ground, germs 
entering the udder, and it very often follows the careless use of the milking 
tube. 

SYMPTOMS. — Acute mammitis is generally ushered in by shivering 
which is soon followed by dullness and fever; however, in the milder forms 
these symptoms may not show but the udder will be found hot, swollen and 
somewhat tender. The fnilk is sometimes curdled and tinged with blood and 
unless a recovery takes place pus may form which is either discharged through 
the teat or opens outwardly. In many cases no suppuration takes place but 
the bag is inclined to harden and remain enlarged and in bad cases it becomes 
gangrenous and a portion of the udder sloughs off. One or more quarters 
may be affected. Some cows appear to be more liable to attacks of mammitis, 
or garget, than others. 

TREATMENT. — Ascertain as quickly as possible whether it is due to an 
injury or bacterial infection. If due to cold or exposure keep the \'umal in a 



CATTLE^DISEASES OF GENERATIVE ORGANS. 146 

warm comfortable place and bed her well so that she cannot bruise her udder. 
If she is fleshy and has been over fed, reduce her grain supply. Foment the 
udder with ^ot water and apply hot camphorated oil or hot raw linseed oil, 
or hot sweet oil, or hot vaseline twice a day. If her bowels are costive give 
her epsom salts and ginger If she is feverish give one-half-ounce doses of 
saltpeter, or give two-ounce doses of hypo-sulphite of soda three times a day. 
In bad cases keep on hot fomentations almost, constantly until the inflamma- 
tion subsides. If you use a milking tube boil it in hot water for ten minutes 
each time before it is used, or dip it into one part carbolic acid and thirty 
parts water. In treating try to remove the cause. 
PEOPLE'S HOME REMEDIES FOR GARGET OR CAKED UDDER.— 

1. Carrot Ointment. — Grate some yellow carrot and simmer in lard 
to make an ointment. First bathe the udder with water as hot as the hand 
will bear, then dry and rub the ointment in thoroughly. 

2. Camphor and Sweet Oil. — Dissolve one ounce of camphor gum in 
four ounces of sweet oil and rub well into the udder two or three times a day. 

3. Tallow, Beeswax and Rosin. — Rub the bag with equal parts of mutton 
tallow, beeswax and rosin which have been melted together. A little currier's 
oil mixed with this will make it spread better. 

4. Hog's Lard. — Rub the udder well with hog's lard. 

5. Salts and Soap Suds. — Give a dose of epsom salts and rub the bag 
with hot soap suds. 

6. Poke Root. — Feed one-half to one ounce of poke root and also apply 
a poke root poultice to the udder. 

7 Salts and Poultices. — Give a pound of epsom salts ahd apply poultices 
of bran and hops which should be kept hot by pouring on hot water occa- 
sionally. The cow should be milked a dozen or fifteen times a day. 

8. Iodine. — Once a day give the cow twenty drops of tincture of iodine 
in the feed. A reliable remedy. 
BLOODY MILK. — 

CAUSES. — This is usually the result of an injury caused by the cow's 
Jumping or stepping over fences, over beams in the cow stables, over logs 
in the woods, one cow's hooking another, a colt's kicking the udder, lying 
down on hard substances or injuring the udder on the floor of the stall. Or 
it may be caused by careless milking. 

TREATMENT. — Remove the cause if possible. Bed the cow well, bathe 
the udder with hot water and dissolve one-quarter pound of sugar of lead in 
a gallon of cold water and apply to the udder three times a day. Showering 
the udder with cold water for a few minutes has a tendency to close the open 
blood vessel. You should use care in milking. Nearly every owner of cows 
can ascertain the cause of his cow's giving bloody milk and if so he can remedy 
It by removing the cause. Bunting calves frequently cause their mother's to 
give bloody milk. 
PEOPLE'S HOME REMEDIES FOR BLOODY MILK.— 

1. Aconite. — Twice a day give twenty or thirty drops of tincture of 
aconite in dampened feed. You will be surprised at the effectiveness of this 
rettiedv. 

STRINGY MILK. — Stringy milk is often the result of cows wading into 
stagnant ponds or rivers and getting the bag covered with filth and drinking 
this kind of water. 

TREATMENT.— Keep the cattle out of ponds which contain impure 



150 THE PEOPLE'S HOME STOCK BOOK. 

water and furnish them a good quality of water to drink. Wash their udders 
clean with soap and water and apply one part peroxide of hydrogen and four 
parts water. Also inject into the udder the same as directed in the treatment 
for blue milk. 
PEOPLE'S HOME REMEDIES FOR STRINGY MILK.— 

1.— Aconite. — Give twenty to thirty drops of tincture of aconite twice a day. 

BLUE MILK. — Milk presents a sky-blue color on account of its contain- 
ing a great many germs. The germs may enter the milk after it has been 
milked or the milk may be blue on account of germs that have inhabited 
either the teat duct or udder. 

TREATMENT. — If you are sure that the germs! are in the udder or teat 
duct, inject one part lysol or one part carbolic acid in two hundred parts 
water or, in bad cases, use it twice this strength. In making these applica- 
tions it is best to use a return flow syringe, or they should be carefully done 
with a common syringe, but be sure that it is clean. Whenever a fluid of 
this kind is injected into the udder it should be milked out after remaining 
in the gland or teat for a few minutes. 

BLOCKED TEATS— STRICTURE OF THE TEATS.— This is a very 
common ailment in cows and is caused by an injury or an irritant of some kind 
in the milk passage which partially or completely closes the duct. 

TREATMENT. — In many cases treatment is very unsatisfactory. Apply 
either iodine ointment or tincture of iodine lightly every day -or two' and if 
it is caused by a small polypus this can sometimes be removed with a wire 
loop passed up through the teat opening, cutting oflf the polypus at its base. 
In many cases I have found it necessary to cut down upon the bunch and re- 
move it. This operation, however, should be performed when the cow is 
dry. When the operation has been performed, a probe or milking tube should 
be put into the teat and a milking tube should be left io until the wound 
heals or a stricture is likely to take place. I have often operated while the 
cow was giving milk and met with fairly good success; however, the opera- 
tion is most satisfactory when the cow is dry. 

PASSING THE MILKING TUBE.— Every dairyman and farmer knows 
what milking tubes are but the careless use of them produces serious udder 
troubles by infection for want of cleanliness. After it has been used the in- 
strument should be cleaned in hot water and always boiled ten minutes before 
it is used again ; or, it should be dipped into an antiseptic solution of one part 
carbolic acid and thirty parts water or a strong soda solution made by dis- 
solving an ounce of baking soda in a pint of water ; or, it should be allowed to 
remain in the oven for ten minutes before it is used. When passing the tube, 
turn it and use gentle pressure and you will not injure the teat duct and be 
sure that your tube is a little longer than the teat. 

BLEEDING FROM THE NAVEL.— This may occur at time of birth 
or within a day or two afterwards. When the cord is cut too close to the 
navel and not tied a hemorrhage may take place and in a young animal with 
but little blood it soon produces great weakness. 

TREATMENT. — Whenever any cord is left it is good practice to tie iv 
with a clean piece of silk, linen or catgut. When there is much swelling a 
loop of the bowel may be down and if this be the case the bowel should be 
pressed upward and the cord then tied below the bowel, for if the bowel is 
tied in with the cord it will produce death. A solution of powdered alum, 



CATTLE— DISEASES OF GENERATIVE ORGANS. 151 

copperas or lead, made by adding one-fourth of a pound of whichever is used 
to a gallon of water, should be applied to it twice a day. I might say that 
the navel of every young animal should be treated twice a day for a few days 
with an antiseptic such as one part carbolic acid and forty or fifty parts water, 
or one part coal-tar disinfectant and twenty parts water. Or, you may use 
any good home healing remedy, for if applied it will often prevent infection. 

SUSPENDED BREATHING IN NEW-BORN CALVES.— When the 
circulation thrdugh the navel string stops, death soon follows unless breathing 
is established and it is astonishing how quickly the young calf makes an 
effort to breathe when the cool air strikes the surface of the body. This seems 
to produce contraction of the respiratory muscles and diaphragm. Many 
young calves die from suspended breathing just before or during birth on 
account of a closing of the navel cord from pressure which stops the circula- 
tion ; besides, the calf is in such a position that it cannot breathe. It is always 
unfortunate for the foetal membranes to be pulled away from the womb in 
the early part of calving. With weak cows that" have trouble calving and also 
when the membranes are wrapped over the head, the calf sometimes smothers. 

TREATMENT. — Remove the membranes and clear the nose and mouth 
of mucus as soon as possible. Produce suction through the nostrils, outward ; 
and sometimes blowing into the nostrils has a good effect. In some cases 
blowing air into the lungs revives a calf. Gentle artificial breathing by com- 
pressing the chest helps. Whatever is done should be done promptly but 
always avoid allowing a young calf to chill. 

INFLAMMATION OF THE NAVEL URINE DUCT.— This is an in- 
flammation of the urachus, or navel urine duct, and is generally the result of an 
injury. 

SYMPTOMS. — There is always redness, heat, swelling and pain. This 
navel enlargement is always hard and extends backward and if the urine is 
examined it will perhaps contain some pus which shows that pus is being 
passed through the ordinary channel back into the bladder. 

TREATMENT. — Apply one part of carbolic acid, one part of sugar of 
lead, six parts of glycerine and ten parts of water to the navel two or three 
times a day, commencing soon after birth. By doing so this trouble may be 
avoided as it is often the result of infection or a dripping of urine. 

URINE DISCHARGED THROUGH THE NAVEL.— Before birth the 
urine of a foetus passes from the bladder through a special tube called the 
urachus, through the navel and string into the outer water bag and at birth this 
should close and the tube be drawn in toward the bladder. Male calves and 
colts are more likely to drip urine at the navel than females as the urethra of 
the male is sometimes small and not well developed. 

TREATMENT.— If a portion of the cord remains it should be tied and 
allowed to dry up or wither away. If the ends are too short, apply the follow- 
ing lotion or powder. Dissolve one-quarter pound of sugar of lead and two 
ounces of tannic acid in a gallon of water and apply four times a day; or 
dust on equal parts of powdered alum and tannic acid; or apply Monsell's 
solution of iron; or apply a light blister, using cerate of cantharides, which 
produces swelling and closes the opening. Or, touch the leaking parts with 
the end of a red hot iron ; this sets up inflammation and swelling which very 
often closes the opening. When the urethra and urachus are both closed and 
the urethra cannot be opened the urine may cpllect in the bladder, bringing on 



158 ' THE PEOPLE'S HOME STOCK BOOK. 

uremia and death, but generally as soon as the urachus is closed the urine 
will pass off through the natural channel. 

JOINT-ILL— INFLAMMATION OF THE JOINTS IN CALVES.— 
This ailment very often affects calves from three to thirty days old and it may 
affect one or more joints but usually attacks the knee or hock. There is 
always more or less fever and inflammation in the joints and this is no doubt 
caused by a sort of infection passing into the body through the navel opening, 
hence the necessity of treating the navel of every young animal. 

TREATMENT. — Foment the joints with hot water but never apply any 
strong liniment or blisters. Apply equal parts extract of witch hazel, alcohol, 
spirits of camphor and water. Or, apply soap liniment or lead lotion and if 
the colt is in much pain apply one part laudanum and four parts water. 

SPAYING. — This operation consists in removing the ovaries in order that 
the cow or heifer will not come in heat again or breed. In young hejfers it is 
best done by making an opening into the flank or flanks in the same location 
as for rumenotomy. In older animals the operation can be made by cutting 
through the wall of the vagina. The animal should be fasted for a day or 
two before the operation or it should "be emptied out by giving a dose of 
cathartic medicine. Before operating the animal should be placed in stocko. 
Clip the hair off the flank high up and make an incision through the skin and 
muscles large enough to admit the hand. Pass the hand in, down and back 
until you find the womb. Follow it up to the end of the horn and you will 
find the ovary, which is about the size of a small finger; pass in a long 
ecraseur, slipping the ovary through the chain loop, and cut it off as is done 
in castrating colts with the ecraseur. When operating, cleanliness should be 
observed and antiseptics should be used ; also be careful not to allow the ovary 
to drop into the abdominal cavity or it may produce death. Both ovaries can 
be taken through the one opening. However, some operators prefer to 
operate on both sides. I always operate on but one side and in cows I prefer 
to operate through the vagina. However, antiseptics and great cleanliness 
should be used in operating by this method. Inexperienced persons should 
not operate through the vagina. 
BARRENNESS IN COWS AND BULLS.— 

CAUSES. — This is very often the result of an acid condition of the genital 
tract or genital organs, or a diseased condition which is the result of germ 
infection. A catarrhal condition in either male or female usually produces 
barrenness. It is true that barrenness may be the result of debility and the 
want of proper food supply while, on the other hand, it is often the result 
of a plethoric condition which is the result of over-feeding and no exercise. 
In the male it is often due to too much service. It is also the result of an 
abnormal condition of the ovaries in the female or of the testicles in the 
male. Perhaps it is most often the result of neglect following a miscarriage 
and improper cleaning of the cow. In the female it is frequently caused by a 
closing of the neck of the womb. 

TREATMENT.— If it is the result of debility, increase the food supply,; 
if caused by plethora, reduce her feed. If an acid condition exists, dissolve 
a tablespoonful of baking soda in three pints or more of tepid water and 
wash out the vagina daily,, or try the yeast treatment which has been ex- 
plained in treating barrenness in mares. Before treating a case try to ascer- 
tain the cause. Use mild astringents, such as alum, sugar of lead, sulphate of 
zinc, chloride of zinc, carbolic acid, bi-chloride of mercury or any of the 



GATTLE-.DISEASES OF GENERATIVE ORGANS. 153 

coal-tar disinfectants, making the solutions weak. Before concluding that 
an animal is barren, it should be examined by a competent person who is able 
to tell why it does not breed. 
THE GENITAL ORGANS OF THE BULL.-^ 

THE TESTICLES.-T-The testicles of the bull are different in shape from 
those of the horse and the spermatic oord a»d actery are smaller in the bull 
than in the horse. 

THE PENIS. — The penis is long and pointed and the sheath extends far- 
ther forward than in the horse. It is impossible to pass the catheter through 
the penis of the bull. While it is done fairly easily in the horse the curve 
in the bull's penis is too crooked to admit of the passage of a catheter. 

CASTRATION OP BULLS AND CALVES.— This consists in remov- 
ing the testicles. The beet position for castrating a bull is the standing posi- 
tion but it is most convenient to cast young calves for this can easily be accom- 
plished by hand. When necessary to throw a bull it can be done by the 
same melJiods used in castrating hcMrses. If ynu have n© travia or stocks, tie 
his head short to a post or in a corner, the right ®de against the wall and held 
there by an assistant ; or, place a strap cur surcingle around the body and tie 
him tb the wall ; tiaen wash the testicle with carbelic loti©n, one part car- 
bolic acid to thirty parts of clean watw^ dip the hands and knife in this same 
lotion ; take hold el the scrotum firmly, crowding both Isoaticles low down ; 
make a bold incision on hade part of scarotMm to it® vary bottom, allowing 
testicle to escape ; take hold of one and draw it down, caitting loose the thin 
attachment on the fore part of the testicle; tiien cat off the cord well up, 
using an emasculator or ecr'aseur, or tie fte o®rd wilii catgut or silk to pre- 
vent bleeding and let the ends of the storing hang down out of tlie wound to 
be pulled off later. In young calves the cord can be cut off with scissors or 
a knife and they will not bleed enough to do any harm. The wounds should 
be treated once a day, using the carbolic lc4aon, peroxide of hydrogen, coal- 
tar disinfectants or any other good home healing remedy. Never forget 
the importance of saturating the string ©f catgut or silk you use in tying 
the cord in carbolized oil or carbolic lotion, also use the same for instruments 
and wound. Keep the animal in a clean stable or turn him into a pasture. 

RIDGLING BULLS OR " RIGS."— These are animals where either one 
or both testicles have not come down into the scrotum. 

TREATMENT.— A surgical operation such as is easily performed on 
stallions cannot be successfully performed on bulls, therefore they should be 
fatted before they become a nuisance and perhaps dangerous. 

INFLAMMATION OF THE TESTICLES— ORCHITIS.— This is usu- 
ally the result of an injury of some kind or a diseased condition of the parts 
or the result of excessive service. 

SYMPTOMS.— Walking with a straddling gait, heat and tenderness of 
the gland and more or less swelling are the symptoms. 

TREATMENT.— Give not less than one pound or one and one-half 
pounds of epsom salts with a tablespoonful of ginger added. Dissolve in two 
or three pints of water and give as a drench. Foment the testicles and 
scrotum with hot water and apply one part fluid extract of belladonna and 
six parts water. When it is not convenient to foment, apply a poultice of 
either linseed meal or antiphlogistine. Give the animal plenty of salt and 
a tablespoonful of saltpeter at a dose in feed twice a day. In some cases, 



154 THE PEOPLE'S HOME STOCK BOOK. 

where the injury has been great, an abscess may form. If this be the case, 
©pen it and treat as recommended for abscess. 

GONORRHEA— INFLAMMATION OF THE URETHRA.— This is 

an inflammation of the urethra, which conveys the urine from the bladder, 
and it is generally the result of infection from serving cows affected with 
leucorrhea, or of too frequent service ; or, it may come from an acid, catarrhal 
condition of the mucous membrane of the urethra. Give epsom salts to open 
the bowels, bathe the sheath with hot water three times a day and dissolve 
one dram of permanganate of potash in half a gallon of water or dissolve 
one ounce of lysol in a gallon of water, and inject into the urethra once or twice 
a day. These applications are most conveniently made through a small 
rubber tube with a funnel attachment. Give one-half ounce of citrate of potash 
at a dose in feed three times a day or one ounce of lithia three times a day, 
or it will do no harm to give them both. 

INJURIES TO THE SHEATH AND PENIS.— From animals being 
placed in slings or work oxen being placed in stocks to be shod or from cattle 
jumping fences the sheath and penis may be injured. 

SYMPTOMS. — There is swelling and pain, causing some' fever, and there 
is dryness of the muzzle. There is also straddling with loss of appetite and 
in the latter stages there may be some suppuration. 

TREATMENT. — Apply hot packs or hot poultices of linseed meal or 
antiphlogistine and keep up these applications constantly, for prompt, ener- 
getic treatment saves the life of many a good bull or steer. Three or four 
times a day apply a lotion made by dissolving one-quarter pound of sugar 
of lead in a gallon of water and adding one pint of fluid extract of opium 
and one quart of witch hazel. If occurring in the summer season cold ap- 
plications have a good effect. If suppuration takes place, open and treat 
with antiseptics. 



DISEASES OF THE SKIN. 

(Including Mange or Scab, Eczema, Ringworm, Erysipelas, Frostbites, 
Tumors, Abscesses, Warts, Sore and Chapped Teats, Grubs, Lice, Etc.) 



MANGE, SCAB OR ITCH.— This ailment is caused by a mite very much 
like the parasite that causes sheep scab. Cattle itch, as it is called, is most 
prevalent throughout the West and Southwest during the winter season and 
is mostly confined to young cattle. Besides, it usually affects those that ar^ 
in an unthrifty condition. 

SYMPTC3MS.^ — It produces itching about the* neck and shoulders and 
the root of the tail and if not remedied extends over the rest of the body. The 
skin always becomes scurfy and the discharge hardens on the body. The 
hair sloughs out and the skin becomes wrinkled and thickened. This dis- 
ease spreads rapidly in herds when the stock is unthrifty. Never confound 
this disease with eczema. Try to find the parasites; you will usually find 
them on the hair or scales. 

TREATMENT. — As soon as the disease affects your animals, remove 
the sick to a cleati, uninfected place and thoroughly disinfect it as well as 
the premises from which the affected ones were brought. Spray one part 
of carbolic acid and twenty or twenty-five parts of water on the stalls and 
on the ground or floors where the cattle have been standing and be very 
thorough in these applications. The department of agriculture recommends 
dissolving twenty-one pounds of flowers of sulphur and sixteen and three- 
quarter pounds of unslacked lime in one hundred gallons of water. The lime 
should be slacked with water enough to form a thick paste, sifting in the 
sulphur slowly but stirring the mixture well. Boil the 'mixture of sulphur 
and lime in twenty or thirty gallons of water for two hours until the sulphur 
disappears. Let it stand, draw off the clear liquid and add water to make 
one hundred gallons. Use this solution at blood heat and dip the cattle once 
every ten days or two weeks. Two or three applications is all that is nec- 
essary. The grooming tools should also be dipped. 
PEOPLE'S HOME REMEDIES FOR MANGE, SCAB OR ITCH.— 

1. Aloes, Turpentine, Sulphur and Lard. — With four ounces of lard mix 
three ounces of flower of sulphur, one ounce of spirits of turpentine and one 
dram of finely powdered aloes. Apply this ointment to the parts affected 
with mange, scab or itch. 

ECZEMA— ACUTE AND CHRONIC— Eczema is an inflammation of 
the skin which at first is acute and if not relieved becomes chronic. 

CAUSES. — Poor grooming, allowing the animal to become filthy or 
lousy, over-feeding, keeping the animal in a stable which is too warm and 
damp, also feeding distillery slop or garbage may cause eczema. 

SYMPTOMS.^There is al-ways more or less! heat and swelling of the 
skin ; besides, there are very often little water blisters which generally break, 
discharge and soon heal, but others are appearing on different parts of the 
body. The animal has intense itching of the skia, especially tfee parts that 
are sore. In some cases large sores appear, diseiiarg^ and remain rav; iot 
some time. 

16S 



156 THE PEOPLE'S HOME STOCK BOOK. 

TREATMENT.— Give a full dose of epsom salts. From one to two 
pounds is usually required to get up a brisk action of the bowels. Also give 
four tablespoonfuls of baking soda or a dessert spoonful of powdered salt- 
peter at a dose in feed two or three times a day and give two tablespoonfuls 
of Glauber's salts in feed twice a day. Dissolve one-quarter pound of sugar 
of lead in one gallon of water and apply to sore parts three times a day, or 
dissolve six ounces of boric acid in a gallon of water and apply in the same 
way. Or, apply one part coal-tar disinfectant and thirty parts water or one 
part coal-tar disinfectant and fifteen parts sweet oil or apply zinc ointment. 
Feed well salted bran mashes, vegetables or grass. 

ERYSIPELAS. — This is an inflammation of the skin that often extends 
into the deeper tissues, producing considerable pain and fever. It may be 
called an infectious ailment for one animal can take it from another by direct 
inoculation through a wound. 

CAUSES.^-It is due to a germ that makes its way into the body throiigh 
a wound or skin abrasion which is possible by the animal's coming in con- 
tact with a sick animal or where it has been. 

SYMPTOMS.^The skin is swollen and always hot and tender; the 
swelling usually pits on pressure and in severe cases it has a tendency toward 
the formation of pus. 

TREATMENT. — Give from one to two pounds of epsom salts, one dose 
only; also give ten drops of fluid extract of aconite, twenty-five drops of 
fluid extract of belladonna and one-half ounce of powdered saltpeter at a 
dose in feed or water two or three times a day. If the animal is thin give 
tonics such as iron, quinine, quassia, etc. When pus forms the abscess should 
be opened and injected with one part corrosive sublimate and one thousand 
parts water or one part carbolic acid and thirty parts water. I have given 
the serum treatment with fairly good results, but it is too expensive to use 
in all cases. 

SURFEIT— NETTLE-RASH— URTICARIA.— (See " Horse Depart- 
ment.") 

RINGWORM. — This is an aflfection of the skin very common in cattle, 
and is due to a vegetable parasite. 

SY^IPTOMS. — ^The disease afifects the skin of cattle in patches, the 
parasites grouping themselves in fields of two or three inches in diameter. 
Their favorite location is about the head and neck. The skin usually thickens 
and becomes scaly and crust-like. Ringworm parasites always cause itching. 

TREATMENT. — Wash the crust off with soap suds and apply tincture 
of iodine or one part carbolic acid and fifteen parts sweet oil, or turpentine 
or kerosene. Be sure to disinfect or whitewash the stable. 
PEOPLE'S HOME REMEDIES FOR RINGWORM.— 

1. Iodine. — Scrape off the crusts and apply tincture of iodine and repeat 
in a week. 

HIDE-BOUND.— (See " Horse Department.") 

BURNS AND SCALDS.— For burns apply equal parts of linseed oil and 
lime water. The lime water is made by dissolving lime in water. The first 
water is somewhat bitter and should be poured oflF and the vessel refilled. 
Water absorbs only so much lime and no more. If you will cover the burn 
with baking soda or flour, then cover that with cotton or oaktim it will exclude 
the air. Or, apply lead lotion which is made by dissolving two tablespoollftlls 



CATTtE— DISEASES OF SKIN. 157 

of sugar of lead in a gallon of water. When blisters are opened the air should 
not be admitted nor the skin removed. 

FROSTBITES. — In cold countries cattle very often suffer from frozen 
ears and this generally happens with those that are poorly fed and improperly 
stabled. 

SYMPTOMS. — After freezing occurs the parts soon become swollen 
and painful; the frozen parts, however, soon again become cold and begin 
to shrivel and later on they drop off, leaving a raw sore. 

TREATMENT. — Apply some good home liniment such as is made by 
mixing one part turpentine, one part aqua ammonia and eight parts sweet 
oil and if the frozen parts slough off apply equal parts of powdered alum, 
oxide of zinc and iodoform to the sore twice a day. 

TUMORS. — Tumors are abnormal . growths which very often follow an 
injury which sets up an inflammation inducing a growth of tissue. There are 
many different kinds of tumors and those that do not yield to treatment are 
usually of a malignant character. 

TjREATMENT. — The removal of tumors is the only satisfactory way to 
treat them and there are many different methods, but cutting them out is 
the best ; however, care must be taken to prevent hemorrhage. Another method 
is to place an elastic band around the neck of the tumor or a thread or string 
can be used. This chokes the circulation and the bunch sloughs off. Another 
method is to burn them off with caustic or with a red hot iron. When a 
tumor is cut out with a knife the wound usually heals more quickly than from 
any other method. After the operation use any good home healing remedy. 
PEOPLE'S HOME REMEDIES FOR FLESHY TUMORS.— 

1. Bin-iodide of Mercury. — Make an ointment by thoroughly mixing 
one dram of bin-iodide of mercury with two ounces of vaseline and rub 
well into the tumor. Repeat in two weeks. 

ABSCESS.— An abscess is a collection of pus or purulent matter, 
the result of a morbid process. 

CAUSES. — The cause is many times hard to trace ; however, it often fol- 
lows a bruise, strangles in horses, or some sort of infection resulting in the 
formation of pus in some part of the body. The most serious kind of ab- 
scesses are located in the abdominal cavity and in the brain. 

TREATMENT.— Hot fomentations of water; or, bran, linseed oil or 
bread and milk poultices hasten the formation of pus. When the hair pulls 
out easily and the bunch fluctuates on pressure it should be opened and washed 
out with one part of peroxide of hydrogen and two or three parts of water, 
applied very slowly; ten minutes later use coal-tar disinfectant, carbolic acid, 
permanganate of potash, sulphate of zinc or sugar of lead. Of course any 
of these drugs should be diluted with water before it is applied. Any one of 
them will give you good results for I have tested their merits hundreds 
of times in the treatment of abscesses. Before pus forms paint the parts 
with tincture of iodine and it will often absorb the effusion and scatter or re- 
duce the swelling. 

WARTS. — ^These are usually the result of an injury to the skin and the 
most satisfactory ^vay to get rid of them is to cut them off. Those that are 
flat can be taken off by applying acetic acid, nitrate of silver, salicylic acid 
or chromic acid every day or two. Sometimes cdstor oil will reduce them 
and I know veterinarians who believe that giving small doses of sulphur 
m the feed daily will remove warts, but I have my doubts as to thia In some 



158 THE PEOPLE'S HOME STOCK BOOK. 

cases I use the red hot iron in preference to drugs. This is, of course, quickei 
than caustics and more likely to stop bleeding. As they are confined to the 
skin, cutting them out is the most satisfactory way to treat warts. 

SORE TEATS— CRACKS AND SMALL WARTS.— The teats, during 
cold weather, are very often made sore by the Saliva from calves' mouths 
which causes them to chap and crack open and when once sore they are 
not easily healed while the calf is allowed to suck. From the injury to the 
skin warty growths very often appear on the teats. 

TREATMENT. — Clip the warty growths oflf with a pair of scissors 
or a sharp knife, or burn with lunar caustic. Apply any good home heal- 
ing ointment such as is made by adding one part of boric acid to five parts 
of vaseline, or one part coal-tar disinfectant to six parts vaseline, or one 
part sub-nitrate of bismuth to five parts vaseline. There are many healing 
remedies that should not be applied to sore teats if the calf is allowed to suck 
the cow for fear that the medicine will act as a poison. 
CHAPPED TEATS.— 

CAUSES. — Cows that are sucked by calves outdoors during cold weather 
are very likely to have chapped teats on account of the teats remaining wet. 
Other causes are: laying on wet frozen ground or in snow, walking through 
wet grass, or allowing the bag to remain wet after milking; also, during the 
fly season flies are often numerous, biting and irritating the teats and udders 
of cows. 

TREATMENT. — Apply any good home healing lotion or ointment that 
is not giving off an offensive odor which is likely to be absorbed by the 
milk at the time of milking. Apply oxide of zinc ointment or one part carbolic 
acid and fifteen parts vaseline; or, apply one part lemon juice and five parts 
glycerine. Or, dissolve one-quarter pound of sugar of lead in a gallon of 
water and apply twice a day. 

WARBLES— GRUBS IN THE BACK.— These are little round lumps 
that appear on the backs of cattle during the winter and spring. They de- 
velop from the egg of the ox gad-fly. The eggs are deposited on the legs, 
licked off and remain in the mouth for a time, then make their way into 
the cellular tissue beneath the skin of the back and remain there until spring. 
These grubs annoy cattle and they damage the hide by boring holes in it. 

TREATMENT. — Every warble should be treated in the early part of 
the winter by applying tincture of iodine, turpentine, coal-tar disinfectant 
or iodine ointment to the bunch. Or, apply one part turpentine and three 
parts lard twice a week. This will kill most of the grubs and the others may 
be liberated by making the opening larger with a sharp pen-knife ahd squ.eez- 
ing them out. Also apply some home healing remedy to the sores once a day. 
When squeezed out the grubs should be killed. 

LICE. — There are two kinds of lice that infest cattle — the blood-sucking 
lice and the biting lice. There are two varieties of blood suckers, one kind 
with long noses and the other with short noses. These latter are the regular 
ox lice and are usually found on the neck and shoulders. The biting or 
bird louse is of a reddish color and is most commonly found on cattle. 

SYMPTOMS. — Cattle become lousy during the winter and spring, per- 
haps on account of a run-down condition. A close examination should be 
made of all cattle, especially the thin ones during the winter months. 

TREATMENT. — Apply equal parts of kerosene and soap suds, or one 
part coal-tar disinfectant and thirty parts water, or one part carbolic acid 



CATTLE— DISEASES OF SKIN. 159 

and fifty parts water ; or, boil one-quarter pound stavesacre seeds in a gallon 
of water for one hour and make up the quantity to one gallon before it is 
applied. These applications should be made daily for two or three days, 
then once every week until the lice and nits are destroyed. It is needless 
to say that lice generally attack thin, unthrifty cattle; therefore, it is neces- 
sary to feed them well and give them tonics, such as are recommended for 
chronic indigestion, etc. 
PEOPLE'S HOME REMEDIES FOR LICE.— 

1. Sulphur and Lard. — Apply sulphur ointment made by mixing an 
ounce of sulphur with four ounces of lard. 

2. Linseed Oil and Kerosene. — Mix an ounce of kerosene with four 
ounces of raw linseed oil and apply to the infested parts. 

3. Sulphur and Linseed Oil. — Apply a mixture of one part sulphur and 
four parts lard. 

4. Lard and Insect Powder. — Mix an ounce of Persian insect powder 
with four ounces of fresh lard and use as an application for lice. 

5. Tobacco Tea. — Pour a quart of boiling water over four ounces of to- 
bacco leaves, let stand fifteen or twenty minutes, then strain and apply with 
a cloth or sponge. i 

6. Onions. — Give lousy cattle a few slices of onions in the feed and it is 
claimed it will rid them of lice. 

7. Wood Ashes. — Sprinkle some fine wood ashes upon the parts infested 
with lice. 

8. Salt,Sulphur and Saltpeter. — With ten ounces of salt mix two ounces 
of sulphur and one-half ounce of saltpeter. Keep this mixture before the cows 
constantly and they will not be bothered with lice. 

BUFFALO GNAT.— This is a small, dark-colored fly with short silk- 
like hairs covering its body. In certain localities these flies appear every year 
as soon as warm weather comes and remain from one to six weeks. They 
seem to trouble cattle mostly in the morning and when numerous do great 
harm by sucking blood from the animal, causing weakness, shock, and many 
times death. If animals are unable to brush them oS or drown them by 
wading into water they are sure to do harm. Mules suffer even more than 
cattle from the Buffalo Gnat. 

TREATMENT.— Whenever the Buffalo Gnat appears build fires that 
will produce plenty of smoke, adding damp wood, some sulphur, rags, old 
pieces of leather and rubbish. If the animal shows weakness give plenty 
of whiskey in cold water, adding perhaps one dram of carbonate of ammonia 
or one dram of fluid extract of nux vomica. Apply fish oil, whale oil^ or 
cotton seed oil with oil of tar, carbolic acid or kerosene added, and keep the 
animal in a dark, cool place. 

HORN FLY. — This is a small insect about one-half the size of a house 
fly which it somewhat resembles. Horn flies swarm around the head where 
they bite and cause the animal great annoyance. They also stick to the back 
and sides. Apply equal parts fish oil, coal oil and pine tar. By placing some 
of this mixture around the horns and ears the animal will suffer less. Nearly 
all the fly killers on the market keep them off; besides, there are many home 
remedies that work well, such as equal parts pine tar, fish oil, cotton seed oil 
and kerosene. Or, apply one part coal-tar disinfectant and thirty parts water 
twice daily. I have used crude oil and thought it worked fairly well. These 
flies seem to appear with the first warm weather and leave when frost comes.

PEOPLE'S HOME REMEDIES FOR KEEPING FLIES OFF OF 
STOCK.— 

1. Economical Treatment.-^-Into an ordinary oil barrel put two and one- 
half gallons of zenoleum or coal-tar disinfectant and five gallons of cotton 
seed oil and fill the barrel with water. As occasion demands this may be used 
as a spray or applied with a cloth or sponge. It is not sticky, leaves the 
animal's coat in good condition, and is not expensive. 



DISEASES OF THE EYE AND EAR. 



INFLAMMATION OF THE EYES— OPHTHALMIA.— rSee "Horse 
Department.") 
PEOPLE'S HOME REMEDIES FOR SORE EYES.— 

1. Salts and Atropia.— Give a pound of epsom salts and keep the 
bowels open with laxative feed. Bathe the eyes three or four times a day 
with warm water and after each bathing drop a few drops of the following 
solution into the eyes. Use two grains of sulphate of atropia to an ounce of 
water. V 

PERIODIC OPHTHALMIA— MOON BLINDNESS.— (See "Horse 
Department.") 

INFLAMED EYES— CONTAGIOUS OPHTHALMIA,— This is a ca- 
tarrhal condition and it may be the result of local causes or it may assume an 
epidemic form and affect a great many of the herd as the result of some irritant 
or germ carried in the air or coming from the soil. It is no doubt due to some 
sort of bacterial infection when it assumes an epidemic form. 

TREATMENT. — Place the animal in a clean, dark, cool stable; give 
laxative food and fresh water to drink and al^ give epsom salts to open the 
bowels and one-half-ounce doses of saltpeter to reduce the fever and start the 
kidneys. Foment the eyes with cold water and blow boric acid into the 
eyes once a day. 

IRITIS— RETINITIS.— (See "Horse Department.") 

CONJUNCTIVITIS— CATARRH OF THE EYES.— This is an inflam- 
mation of the mucous membrane of the eye and it is best, treated by apply- 
ing either hot or cold applications, keeping the animal in a clean, well ven- 
tilated, dark stable and out of bright sunlight. If the bowels are costive 
give epsom salts, if the cow is feverish, give saltpeter or tincture of aconite. 
Feed a cooling, laxative diet. Dissolve boric acid in water and apply to the 
eyes three times a day. If the eyes continue to discharge mucus, blow a 
little calomel into them once a day. 

INFLAMMATION OF THE HAW (MEMBRANA NICTITANS).— 
The haw often becomes inflamed and enlarged because of an injury by some 
foreign substance or because of a catarrhal inflammation of the eye. 

TREATMENT.— Apply cold water freely. Also apply weak lead lotions 
with a little opium added and if the swelling does not recede and the muscle 
go back into place, run a thread through it, pull it out and clip it off with 
a pair of sharp scissors or a knife; then apply boric acid or any home eye 
wash two or three times a day. 

WORM IN THE EYE.— fSee "Horse Department.") 

CANCER IN THE EYE— FUNGUS H^MATODES.— Sometimes 
these cancerous growths appear in the eye and their cause is unknown. 
When there is cancer in the eye the ball usually bursts and a fungus growth 
soon appears. ' 

TREATMENT. — The sooner the eyeball is removed, the quicker the 
animal will recover ; this can be done painlessly by the use of an anaesthetic 
or cocaine ; then apply any good home healing remedy. 

161 



153 THE PEOPLE'S HOME STOCK BOOK, 

AMAUROSIS— GLASS EYE— GUTTA SERENA.— This condition of 
the eye is due to paralysis of the optic nerve and its terminal expansion, the 
retina, without much change in the appearance of the eye itself. It may co- 
exist with periodic ophthalmia and cataract but not very often. It sometimes 
appears as a symptom of milk fever and in the last stages of other diseases. 
Injuries to the optic nerve, or standing for a long time in a dark stable brings 
it on. Mules in coal mines are often sufferers from this ailment. Amaur- 
osis sometimes occurs in pregnant cows and mares and leaves a few days 
before calving or foaling. It also sometimes follows hemorrhage. 

SYMPTOMS. — The pupillary opening seems to lose its elliptical form 
and become round and the eyeball enlarges and has a glassy appearance. 
Both eyes are generally affected unless it is the result of an injury, then one 
eye only may be affected. The sight is usually impaired and very often lost. 

TREATMENT. — Give one-ounce doses of bromide of potash four times 
daily; or give one dram of ground nux vomica in the feed three times a day. 
Keep the animal in a stable with dim light and the bowels should be kept 
open. 

CATARACT.— (See " Horse Department.") 

FOREIGN BODIES IN THE EYE.— Quite often chaff, barley-beards, 
little pieces of wood, old leaves, pieces of fodder or weeds break off and re- 
main in the eye, causing inflammation, blindness and sometimes an abscess. 

TREATMENT. — Secure the animal and remove the object as carefully 
as possible without injuring the eyeball. If the eyeball is punctured there 
is generally loss of vision, but small punctured wounds may heal. Blow in 
some boric acid twice a day or apply one part extract of witch ha^el and 
two parts water. 

DISLOCATION OF THE EYEBALL.— It is not unusual for one ani- 
mal to hook the eyeball out of another, or the eye is sometimes crowded 
out with the end of a walking cane or a punching stick. ' 

TREATMENT. — If the optic nerve is not lacerated and the muscles too 
badly torn it is advisable to replace the eyeball and stitch the lids together 
or use a compress to hold the eye in place; however, if the attempt to re- 
place it is unsuccessful cocaine should be used and the eyeball taken out. 

INJURIES TO THE EYELIDS.— Cattle frequently meet with accidents 
by coming in contact with barbed wire or being hooked by other cattle. A 
splinter of wood may injure the eyelid or it may be injured by a nail. 

TREATMENT. — If the wound is lacerated, trim off the edges and stitch 
with silk or linen thread and keep the parts dressed with boric acid or any 
good home healing remedy that will not .injure the eye. 

INFLAMMATION OF THE INTERNAL EAR— OTITIS.— This con- 
sists in an inflammation of the inner ear and sometimes the bone becomes 
diseased, especially if it is broilght on by an injury; or, the ear may become 
sore from lump jaw or tubercular affections. 

SYMPTOMS.— If but one ear is affected the head is held to one side. 
The animal may not eat well and in some cases pus is discharged, giving off 
an offensive odor. 

TREATMENT. — Apply hot fomentations and pour into the ear very 
slowly one part peroxide of hydrogen and five parts water, then dust in some 
boric acid powder; or, if the animal appears to be in pain, pour in a small 
quantity of laudanum and sweet oil, one part of laudanum to ten or twelve 
parts of oil. Where a cooling astringent is required dissolve one ounce of 



CATTLE— DISEASES OF EYE AND EAR. 163 

sugar of lead in two quarts of water and use some of this solution once or 
twice a day. 

DISEASE OF THE CARTILAGE OF THE EAR.— When the ear be- 
comes badly bruised the cartilage may become diseased and when it does the 
discharge is quite offensive. 

TREATMENT. — If a pipe or sinus forms cut it out or rip it open and 
also cut away the diseased portion of the cartilage; then apply equal parts 
of boric acid and powdered alum twice a^day or use any good home healing 
remedy. 

ABSCESS OF THE EAR.— It is not unusual for cattle to have abscesses 
of the ear for they are the result of either filth or injury. 

TREATMENT. — Open the abscess freely, washing it out with one part 
peroxide of hydrogen and two parts water, then apply one part carbolic acid 
and fifty parts water; or, the inside of the abscess may be painted with 
tincture of iodine or injected with one part powdered sulphate of copper 
and one hundred parts water. Only two or three applications will be 
required. 

FOREIGN BODIES IN THE EAR.— Whenever a foreign body lodges 
in the ear the animal shakes the head or rubs the head and ear against fences, 
trees, posts, etc. 

TREATMENT. — Tie the animal short, examine the ear closely where 
there is good light and if a foreign body is found remove it with a pair of 
forceps. If the ear is much inflamed foment with hot water and apply boric 
acid or a weak lead lotion which is made by dissolving two ounces of sugar 
of lead in a gallon of water. 

LACERATED EARS. — It is not unusual for the ears of cattle to be 
torn and lacerated by dogs. 

TREATMENT.— If the wound is large and the ear torn much, cut off 
the ragged edges and stitch the wound with catgut or silk. You will find 
it difficult to get a proper union of the ear as the cartilage is of low vitality 
and consequently it is slow to unite. Apply any good home healing remedy, 
but don't take out the stitches too soon» 



CONTAGIOUS DISEASES. 

(Including Tuberculosis and the Tuberculin Test, Foot and Mouth Disease, 
Black-Leg, Cow-Pox, Anthrax, Contagious Pleura-Pneumonia, Texas 
or Southern Fever, Etc.) 



TUBERCULOSIS. — Tuberculosis is a contagious disease attacking many 
animals but perhaps is most common in cattle. It is caused by germs or 
bacteria that are always present in an animal suffering with this disease. 

CAUSES. — This disease is not nearly so hereditary as many believe 
for I have known many cows to be consumptive that gave birth to perfectly 
sound calves which showed no reaction whatever from the tuberculin test. 
The milk from diseased cows will infect not only domestic animals but man. 
especially children under eight years of age. The germs are passed out 
of the body with the excrement and are also sometimes discharged with 
the mucus from the nose. There is a great difference of opinion existing 
among bacteriologists, physicians and veterinarians as to whether consump- 
tion in man and tuberculosis in cattle are not about the same disease; any- 
how, the germs that cause consumption in man and tuberculosis in cattle are 
very much alike. 

SYMPTOMS. — As this disease may attack almost any part of the body, 
in either mild or severe form, it is difficult to state what the symptoms are. 
The. lungs seem to be attacked most frequently ; however, the Hver, spleen, 
lymphatic glands, bones or joints may he the seat of this disease. When 
the lungs are affected and become badly diseased the animal falls away in 
flesh although eating plenty of food ; the coat is rough ; the eyes are somewhat 
sunken and the animal usually has a cough; but, strange to say, an animal 
may be badly affected and appear quite healthy; therefore, the only means 
of making a correct diagnosis is to test with tuberculin. The disease is con- 
tracted, no doubt, through wounds, by eating food or drinking water or 
by being inhaled; also, sucking calves may get the disease from drinking 
milk. The discharges from the nose may dry and blow some distance in the 
form of dust and be picked up by other cattle and produce tuberculosis. 
Every suspicious case should be examined after death on the farm or at the 
slaughter house to ascertain if any of the vital organs contain nodules or 
lumps which, if cut open, show a yellow substance which seems to be gritty, 
or if the nodule contains pus of a cheesy nature, or if the bunch be sort 
of fibrous. Very often the disease appears outside of the vital organs, show- 
ing tumor-like growths or bunches which, when cut into, appear as above 
described. These tubercles are sometimes exceedingly small and in other 
cases they are very large. The disease may be confined to one small tubercle 
or many of them may be scattered throughout the body. The tubercular 
bunch or deposit is quite often found in one or more of the lymphatic glands, 
in the throat, between the lungs, in the udder or along the border of the 
bowels. These glands when healthy vary in size from a small bean to a 
large marble and when cut open are found to be solid but when diseased 
they are always enlarged, showing a yellow material when cut open. It 

164 



CATTLE— CONTAGIOUS DISEASES. 165 

is not unusual to find tubercles attached to the pleura liniilg the ribs, in the 
liver, spleen, lungs, womb or other organs of the body. 

TREATMENT. — There is no known remedy ; however, when feeding 
plenty of rich, easily-digested food and allowing the animal to breathe pure 
dry air it is astonishing how much nature will do to remedy this ailment. 
The best method of preventing the disease if it is not already in your herd 
is to allow no animal to come on your premises that has not been tested with 
tuberculin in the hands of a competent person, for I fully believe that no 
farmer or dairyman or stock raiser can afford to have tubercular cattle as- 
sociating with healthy stock. They should be segregated and kept by them- 
selves. If in emaciated condition it will not pay to keep them but if appar- 
ently healthy and vigorous they should be fatted and sold to a butcher where 
their carcasses can be examined by either local government meat inspectors 
or by a competent veterinarian or person who can determine whether the 
animal is fit for food ot not. 

THE TUBERCULIN TEST.— The only accurate means of detecting 
tuberculosis in cattle is by testing them with tuberculin. The temperature 
of the animals to be tested should be taken every two hours during the day 
to determine their normal temperature which should be about lOli/^ de- 
grees ; of course, it may vary slightly but a majority of cattle have this tem- 
perature. The tuberculin should be injected under' the skin in the region of 
the neck or back of the shoulder, late in the evening. Eight hours after 
the injection is made commence again taking the temperature and take it 
every hour or two during the following day. If the animal has the disease, 
some time between eight and twenty hours after the injection of tuberculin 
has been made, the temperature will show a rise of from two to six degrees 
above normal and then gradually recede towards evening. If the tempera- 
ture rises only a degree it is not enough but if a degree and a half it should 
be regarded as suspicious. If the temperature does not rise higher than the 
highest point before injecting you can safely believe your animal free from 
tuberculosis. ' The test should never be made when a cow is in heat or suf- 
fering from any febrile ailment; she should not be given large quantities 
of cold water at a time on the days you are testing and if a reaction takes 
place you should be certain that nothing else contributed to cause it other 
than tuberculosis. Cows should hot be tested closer than three or four weeks 
before calving or the same number of weeks after calving ; also keep in 
mind that those that suffer the least from tuberculosis very often react most, 
while advanced and -generalized cases may show little or no reaction from 
the test; howevei", a physical examination made by an expert may be suf- 
ficient to condemn the animal. When tuberculosis has once gained a foot- 
hold in a herd you will find it quite difficult to disinfect and fumigate the 
stables and premises thorough enough to prevent the cattle contracting 
the disease. Fumigate with formaldehyde or sulphur or use live steam ; also 
sprajr with a three per cent, solution of carbolic acid, or one part corrosive 
sublimate and one thousand parts water or one part coal-tar disinfectant 
and fifty parts water. But even if you destroy the infection in the stable 
there are many other places about the premises that may perhaps escape the 
disinfectants. 

FOOT AND MOUTH DISEASE— CONTAGIOUS ECZEMA.— This is 
a highly contagious fever of a specific nature marked by blisters in the 
mouth and also around the coronet of the foot and between the toes. It is 



166 THE PEOPLE'S HOME STOCK BOOK. 

more common in cattle than in other domestic animals ; however, sheep, goats 
and pigs may also suffer with it. This is a disease that is not well 
understood but is doubtless of the germ variety, due to a specific organism. 
Fortunately, it is not prevalent in this country; however, it did exist in the 
New England States during 1903, but was stamped out. Another outbreak 
occurred in Michigan during the latter part of 1908 and early part of 1909, 
which, by strict quarantine regulations enforced by the Bureau of Animal 
Industry, was also stamped out. As a rule the disease is not by any means 
fatal, but great loss is sustained by stock falling off in flesh and milk besides 
, losses from restrictions of the live stock trade. 

CAUSES. — It is doubtless due to a specific germ transmitted by direct 
contact, by eating infected food, drinking infected water or being housed in 
infected stables, cars or pens; or, it may be taken from the attendant. Per- 
haps the contagion may be carried in the air and also the milk of infected 
animals is contagious. The disease usually develops in two or three days, 
but may not develop before eighteen or twenty. 

SYMPTOMS. — It usually sets in with a chill that is of short duration. 
There is an arched back, staring coat and a gaunt appearance with some 
shivering or slight twitching of the muscles. The animal usually shows 
some lameness, some discharge from eye and nostril and usually shows a 
quick pulse and elevated temperature. Blisters show in the mouth, on the 
udder and about the feet. These are filled with a watery sort of fluid but 
soon burst, leaving a raw surface. These blisters cause a discharge from 
the mouth which is thick and ropy. The animal soon finds it difficult to eat 
solid food, the feet frequently become very sore and the lungs may become 
affected. 

TREATMENT. — The majority of cases recover without treatment; 
however, it is well to assist nature by applying to the sore mouth, udder 
and feet a lotion made from astringents or antiseptics. Dissolve one-quarter 
pound of alum or boric acid in a gallon of water and wash the sores twice 
a day; or, wash the mouth out with one part carbolic acid and two hundred 
parts water and apply one part carbolic acid and thirty parts water to the 
sores on the feet and udder twice a day. Or, dissolve one-quarter pound of 
sugar of lead and one ounce of carbolic acid in a gallon of water and apply 
twice a day. If the bowels are costive, give epsom salts and if the kidneys 
do not act freely, give saltpeter or citrate of potash and remember it is 
important to report cases of this kind to the proper authorities for their in- 
vestigation. Your State Veterinarian, your County or City Board of Health 
or the Bureau of Animal Industry, Washington, D. C. are the proper parties 
to be notified. 

PEOPLE'S HOME REMEDIES FOR FOOT AND MOUTH DISEASE.— 
1. General Treatment. — Give plenty of good cold water and feed bran 
mashes. If there is much fever dissolve an ounce of nitrate of potash in 
each bucket of water and give thirty drops of aconite every four hours. 
Coal-tar disinfectants should be applied to the feet twice a day. 
BLACK-LEG— BLACK QUARTER- 
CAUSES. — This is an infectious disease produced by a bacillus which 
lives in the soil of certain districts; besides, it also inhabits the bodies of 
diseased animals. Certain kinds of soil appear to suit this parasite and when 
once infected it usually remains so. Black-leg at one time was supposed to 
be anthrax fever but that was a mistake for they are two distinct and inde- 



CATTLE— CONTAGIOUS DISEASES. 167 

pendent diseases, each being caused by a different germ. One diseased ani- 
mal does not infect another only by self-inoculation. The germ must enter 
a wound in the skin or mucous membrane of the body and is most likely 
to enter the body through wounds or skin abrasions on the legs. When an 
animal dies of black-leg it should be burned, not buried, for the germs should 
be kept out of the soil. 

SYMPTOMS. — This disease is usually characterized by swellings on 
the upper portion of either one or more quarters of the body. Shortly after 
the animal is infected, a gas forms in the tissues beneath the skin, the gas 
being produced by the germ. When punctured, a bloody fluid with a bad 
odor oozes out. The animal loses appetite, has a high fever and generally 
shows considerable lameness. 

TREATMENT. — No remedy has yet been discovered. Cattle should 
never be kept on infected ground unless they have been immunized, which 
can be done by vaccination or a protective inoculation. When vaccinated, 
cattle will not take the disease within a year but when calves have been 
vaccinated it is a good plan to do it over again in eight or ten months. All 
preventive medicines appear to fail. Whenever an outbreak occurs all the 
young animals should be removed at once to a non-infected pasture and be 
sure to supply them with a good quality of water. Black-leg vaccine is made 
by heating the flesh of a calf that died of the disease to a temperature that 
weakens the germs. One kind of vaccine that is prepared requires only 
one dose while the other kind has to be given ten or twelve days apart. 
The vaccine is put up in pill form and also as a string saturated with the 
virus. The pills are forced under the skin with a little gun, the string being 
pulled in with a needle. The vaccine is also put out in powder form to mix 
with water and inject under the skin. 
PEOPLE'S HOME REMEDIES FOR BLACK-LEG.— 

1. Preventive. — With three pounds of salt mix five ounces of sulphur, 
three ounces of copperas and one and one-half ounces each of saltpeter and 
air-slacked lime. Beginning several weeks before time for black-leg to 
attack them, keep this before the calves all the time. 

2. Salt and Salts.^ — In a quart of water dissolve one-half teacupful of 
common salt and a small teacupful of salts. Repeat in five hours and then 
give once, a day for two or three days. There is probably no remedy that 
will cure every case of black-leg but this one is worth a trial. 

COW-POX— VARIOLA VACCINA.— This is a contagious disease 
similar in nature to small-pox in man, but of course milder. One cow takes 
it from another. Cow-pox exists in herds all over the world.. 

SYMPTOMS. — Small red pimples appear around the teats ; in a few 
days they form a sort of blister containing a watery fluid which, if not broken, 
dry and form a dry scab which later scales off leaving the teat in a normal 
state. The animal generally has some fever. 

TREATMENT. — About all the treatment required is to give the animal 
good care, laxative food and some saltpeter in the drinking water and apply 
zinc ointment to the sores once a day. I often apply one part carbolic acid 
and twenty parts sweet oil to the sores twice daily. 

ANTHRAX— SPLENIC APOPLEXY.— Anthrax, or splenic apoplexy, 
is a disease confined mostly to cattle and is one of the most fatal diseases to 
wh&h they are subject. It is due to micro-organisms, the anthrax bacilli, 
■vvhieh can readily be seen under the microscope by examining the blood 



168 THE PEOPLE'S HOME STOCK BOOK. 

taken from either the spleen or the ear, but this examination should be made 
before the carcass decomposes. The disease comes on suddenly, is of short 
duration and usually termiaatee fetally and te readily communicatesd jso man 
and other animals. 

SYMPTOMS. — The animal may appear well at nig-ht and be dead liie 
next morning, or the disease may develop more gradually with high tempera- 
ture, loss of appetite, suspended rumination, a chill followed by perspiration, 
a rapid and weak pulse and scanty and highly colored urine. There is great 
weakness, the animal walks with a staggering gait and the breathing is 
quick and difficult. The brain is generally affected, there is frothing at the 
mouth and. the animal crften bellows witii pain and very often dies in 
convulsions. 

TREATMENT. — When the disease is fully developed medical remedies 
have little effect, nature seemingly having to do it all ; however, it is well 
to isolate the animal and give antiseptics such as carbolic acid or creosote 
in one-half-drara doses well diluted in water and freely use disinfectants 
such as coal-tar preparations. A cathartic of linseed oil should be given and 
the food and water supply should be changed. In all cases repjrt the out- 
break to your State Veterinarian or to the Bureau of Animal Industry at 
Washington, D. C. The carcass should not be opened to allow the blood to 
spill, but should be buried four feet under the ground or burned ajid the 
hide should go with the carcass. 

CONTAGIOUS PLEURA-PNEUMONIA.— This is perhaps one ©f the 
most fatal ailment® cattle are heir to and consists in an inflaramation of the 
lungs and pleura. The exact nature of the contagion has never been fully 
determined. The disease usually develops in from three weeks to three 
months after exposure. Fortunately, the Bureau of Animal Industry stamped 
out this disease successfully and unless it is brought here again from some 
other country we shall perhaps not be troubled with it. 

SYMPTOMS. — There is high temperature, loss of appetite, staring ce»at, 
chills, shrinkage in milk and the passing of small quantities of highly colored 
urine. There is tenderness over the lungs and the cough increases. There 
is quick breathing, a pointing out of the nose and an arching of the back 
and the hind legs are drawn under the body and the elbows kept well out. 
At first the chest sounds clear but later a dry crackling noise is heard which 
later changes to a dull sound. The disease seems to spread more rapidly 
during hot than cold weather. 

TREATMENT.— It can perhaps be safely stated that fifty per cent, of 
the sick animals recover. On account of its seriousness it should be pre- 
vented if possible. No person should be allowed to come from a diseased 
herd and mix with healthy stock. When the disease breaks out in a herd the 
safest way is to destroy them, burn their carcasses, disinfect thoroughly and 
keep no more cattle on the premises for six months or a year. 

TEXAS FEVER— SPANISH OR SPLENIC FEVER— SOUTHERN 
FEVER— TICK FEVER.— This is a fever caused by a microscopic para- 
site that is transmitted from southern to northern cattle by means of the 
southern tick. Southern cattle come here in summer from tick infested dis- 
tricts and infect our pastures by the female tick's dropping off the cattle and 
laying a great many eggs which mature and, in from two to six or seven weeks, 
crawl on to our native cattle and bury their mouths in the skin ; in this man- 



CATTLE— CONTAGIOUS DISEASES. 169 

tier the disease is transmitted. Northern cattle taken south to infected dis- 
tricts show the disease in ten or fifteen days. 

SYMPTOMS. — There is loss ot appetite, high fever, suspended rumina- 
tion, weakness and trembling. The head is held low, the bowels are costive, 
the urine is red and young ticks can be found where the skin is thin but you 
may need a magnifying glass to see them plainly. After death the blood 
will be found to be very thin and not to clot readily and the gall bladder 
will be found full and the spleen greatly enlarged. The liver is enlarged and 
quite yellow in color and the kidneys are somewhat congested and the 
bladder full of red urine. 

TREATMENT. — Good nursing and feeding the animal plenty of easily- 
digested food will help save its life. Tonics such as quinine, gentian, cod- 
liver oil and alcoholic stimulants help brace the animal against the debilitating 
effects of these ticks. When first discovered, pick ofif as many of the ticks 
as possible and kill the rest with tick-killing dip. If the bowels are costive 
give a small dose of epsom salts. Eggs and milk with brandy or whiskey added 
help revive these cases. Cattle in the southern infested pastures become im- 
mune to this fever by ticks diseasing the calves in a mild way which pre- 
vents their ever having another attack. But to immunize northern cattle, 
they require to be vaccinated with the blood of a sick animal, which produces 
the disease in mild form, thereby rendering them immune to the disease. 
Cattle can be vaccinated a time or two without very much risk and at small 
expense and this should be done before they are taken to infested parts of 
the country Cold frosty weather kills the ticks. This disease has been 
heard of since 1814 and called by many dififerent names and is no doubt 
caused by an organism which lives within the red corpuscles and breaks 
them up but how they get there is hard to tell. 

INFLUENZA — PINK EYE— EPIZOOTIC — LA GRIPPE.— (See 
"Horse Department.") 



VARIOUS DISEASES. 

(Including Lump Jaw, Foot-Rot, Founder, Wounds of all Kinds, Screw 
Worms, Broken Bones, Hydrophobia, Apoplexy, Epilepsy, Dropsy, 
Rheumatism, Ringing Bulls, Dehorning, Diseases of the Heart, Blood and 
Veins, Etc.) 



LUMP JAW— ACTINOMYCOSIS.— This disease is due to the presence 
of vegetable parasites which are known by the name " actinomyces." It has 
been known to affect man, sometimes the horse and other animals, but it 
generally affects the ox. 

CAUSES. — It is always due to a vegetable organism that makes its way 
into the tissues, producing a lump or tumor on some part of the body, gen- 
erally affecting the jaw but may affect the tongue and is sometimes found 
in the lungs. This fungus grows on plants and very often gains entrance to 
the body through wounds about the head or mouth or even other parts of 
the body. This disease should not be called strictly contagious for the only 
way a diseased animal can infect another is by pus dropping on grass, as this 
fungus seemingly regains vitality and when eaten seems to disease others; 
therefore, an animal suffering from this disease and discharging pus should 
not be allowed to run on pasture where other cattle graze. 

SYMPTOMS. — Usually the first symptoms are : a refusal of food, an irri- 
tation of the tongue, disinclination to masticate food and very often a profuse 
flow of saliva, a disagreeable odor from the breath and a swelling, such 
as would result from an injury. When pus comes from the bunch it is 
usually sticky and contains small hard yellow particles which can be seen 
readily by spreading on a clean glass. This disease appears to act rather 
peculiarly for in some cases it progresses rapidly and in other cases quite 
slowly. To be sure that it is a case of actinomycosis the pus should be 
examined with a microscope to find the fungus. 

TREATMENT. — In a majority of cases, if treated in time, this disease 
is curable but, if it has become chronic and the bones affected very much, 
they are cured with difficulty ; however, it is well to make the effort. Simple 
home remedies cut little figure in the treatment of this ailment. From one to 
four drams of iodide of potassium dissolved in water should be given as a 
drench twice a day until a perceptible improvement is noticed, then less of 
the medicine should be given until a recovery takes place. The best external 
application is red iodide of mercury, one part and lard, four parts, applied 
every few days as the case demands. I have obtained very good results by 
cutting the tumor open and applying caustics and there are none better than 
caustic potash. After the inside of the tumor; sloughs out apply either tincture 
of iodine or iodine ointment. I have also tried some of the lump jaw cures 
that are on the market and they have given me fairly good results. It is 
well to keep in mind that this ailment can be communicated to other live 
stock ; therefore, it is often wise to fatten and dispose of them as in the 
majority of cases the flesh of an animal of this kind is fit for food.

PEOPLE'S HOME REMEDIES FOR LUMP JAW.— 

1. Air-Slacked Lime. — Cut the lump open and put in all the air-slacked 
lime it will hold. This will eat out the diseased parts and effect a cure. 

2. Iodine. — The lump should be cut open and cleansed with a solution 
of one part carbolic acid and twenty parts water and then half an ounce of 
tincture of iodine should be injected. 

3. Iodide of Potash. — Give one dram of iodide of potash once a day for 
ten or twenty days, discontinue for a week and then repeat. The potash 
should be given in the drinking water. This is one of the most effective 
remedies known for lump jaw. 

4. . Kerosene and Iodine. — Mix one part of iodine with two parts of kero- 
sene and apply frequently when the lump first makes its appearance. 

LUMPS ON THE JAW. — A lump on the jaw is very often caused by a 
blow or by one animal's hooking another or by being kicked by a horse. The 
bunch may be actinomycosis (lump jaw), or it may be the result of a dis- 
eased tooth or a cap crowding against the cheek and causing an inflammation 
of the jaw. ' 

TREATMENT. — Try to ascertain the cause and if it is the result of an 
injury or even if it be incipient lump jaw apply iodine ointment which can 
be obtained from any druggist. If caused by a tooth, treat as I have suggested 
elsewhere. When applying iodine ointment or tincture of iodine, daily appli- 
cations should be made for a few days, then the medicine may be used less 
frequently. 

EXOSTOSIS OF THE JAW.— (See " Horse Department") 

FOOT-ROT— FOUL IN THE FOOT.— This is a diseased condition of 
the foot showing itself mostly between the toes and in the back part of the 
heel and in the coronet. 

QAUSES. — It is generally caused by stable filth or by some foreign body 
lodging between the toes or by allowing the toes to grow too, long and out 
of shape. In cattle it is not generally contagious but it frequently is in 
sheep. 

SYMPTOMS. — Generally, the first symptom noticed is lameness. There 
is swelling of the coronet, swelling between the claws and very often some 
sloughing and if the case has been neglected it is often deep seated and sup- 
purating under the wall. 

TREATMENT. — If you suspect there is pus under the wall, cut through 
and liberate it, applying peroxide of hydrogen ; a few minutes later apply one 
part carbolic acid and ten parts water, not fprgetting the importance of keep- 
ing the animal in a clean dry stable. After the foot ceases to discharge pus, 
apply pine tar and oakum and bandage a:round the foot to protect it from dirt. 
Feed the animal on cooling laxative diet and as the animal begins to recover 
it is not necessary to use the carbolic lotion stronger than one part to thirty 
of \ivater. I have obtained good results by applying the following lotion : — 
Dissolve one-quarter pound of sugar of lead and two ounces of carbolic acid 
in a gallon of water and apply daily. This is hardly active enough, however, 
for bad cases during the early treatment. If the toes have grown out long they 
should be shortened. If the feet are much inflamed, poultices will make the 
animal more comfortable. 
PEOPLE'S HOME REMEDIES FOR SORE FEET, FOUL IN THE 

FOOT OR FOOT EVIL.— 

1, Linseed Oil, Lard and Carbolic Add. — Mix one ounce of carbolic acid 



173 THE PEOPLE'S HOME STOCK BOOK. 

with two ounces each of linseed oil and lard. Before applying, the foot should 
be thoroughly cleaned by drawing a rope between the toes. 

2. Blue Vitriol. — Pare the hoof and then bathe with a solution of four 
ounces of blue vitriol in a pint of warm water. Finely pulverized blue vitriol 
may be applied dry if preferred. This is an excellent remedy for foul foot of 
cattle. 

3. Butter of Antimony. — Clean the foot and apply butter of antimony. 
Repeat in a week or ten days if the first application does not complete the 
cure. If it makes the foot too sore apply some lard or linseed oil. 

4. Turpentine. — Thoroughly clean the foot and apply spirits of turpen- 
tine. This should be applied early. 

5. Borax, Calomel and Blue Vitriol. — Mix half an ounce of borax with 
two ounces each of calomel and blue vitriol and apply twice a week. The 
foot should be thorougfhly cleaned each time before applying. 

FOUNDER— LAMINITIS.— This is an inflammation of the sensitive 
tissues of the foot, usually afifecting the front feet but sometimes all four feet. 

CAUSES. — It is caused by traveling a long distance on rough, hard roads 
and by over-feeding and it sometimes follows calving. 

SYMPTOMS. — The animal walks sore and is inclined to lie down and 
when traveling attempts to carry as much of the weight of the body on the 
hind legs as possible, especially when the forefeet only are afifected. 

TREATMENT. — Stand the animal in a tub of warm water if occurring in 
the winter season, or in cold water or wet clay in the summer. Give a full 
dose of epsom salts, also give a tablespoonful of saltpeter three times a day. 
When the animal is feverish give ten or fifteen drops of fluid extract of 
aconite and if in much pain give a teaspoonful of fluid extract of belladonna 
or a tablespoonful or two of laudanum two or three times a day. 

FOOT SORENESS.— This is a very common ailment in cattle and is 
generally the result of filth, over-feeding or traveling on rough, uneven roads 
or running in rough lots. Stand in either hot or cold water or poultice the 
feet with wet clay or apply antiphlogistine. Also apply wet swabs to the 
hoofs and if you are able to determine the cause, remove it. 

LOSS OF HOOF.— The loss of a hoof is usually the result of an acci- 
dent or injury of some kind, pulling oflf either or both claws. 

TREATMENT. — After applying peroxide of hydrogen cover the foot with 
pine-tar, covering that with oakum and a bandage. It will not be necessary to 
dress the foot more than two or three times, providing the foot is clean when 
first dressed and the coating of tar and oakum is sufficient to protect the foot 
from wet and dirt. There are many healing remedies that you may have on 
hand that will answer almost as well as what I have prescribed. It is import- 
ant to keep the foot clean and free from infection. 

SPAVIN IN CATTLE,— This is not neariy so common an ailment in 
cattle as in horses but work oxen and cows that are obliged to travel on hard 
roads do sometimes have bone spavin, causing a bony enlargement on the 
lower and inside part of the hock joint. 

TREATMENT. — Rest, blisters and firing, the same as are recommended 
for horses, are proper treatment for cattle. 

SPRAIN OF THE STIFLE JOINT.- rSee" Horse Department.") 

DISLOCATION OF STIFLE IN CATTLE.— The stifle bone sometimes 
becomes dislocated in cattle and should be treated the same as for horses, 
(See " Horse Department.") 



CATTLE— VARIOUS DISEASES, 173 

SPRAINS. — Sprains of Tendons, Ligaments and Muscles are treated in 
the " Horse Department." 

WOUNDS. — Wounds on cattle should be treated much the same as 
those on horses ; therefore, I suggest that you lopk up the treatment for 
wounds in the " Horse Department." However, it is well to keep in mind that 
every wound should be examined closely at first to ascertain whether or not 
there is any foreign body in it. If there is, remove it, pour on a small quan- 
tity of peroxide of hydrogen or one part of carbolic acid and thirty parts of 
water or one part of coal-tar disinfectant and thirty parts of water. Or, dis- 
solve one ounce of alum or the same quantity of sugar of lead or sulphate 
of zinc in a quart of water and apply to wounds two or three times a day. 
Any of the above home remedies will answer very well. A very good healing 
powder is made of equal parts of iodoform, powdered alum and boric acid, 
but remember that for wounds to do well the animal should be kept in a clean 
place and the wounds should be kept clean and protected from contaminated 
influences. It is not always necessary to cover a wound with oakum or ab- 
sorbent cotton or tar bandages but as a rule when they are applied properly 
a wound heals more rapidly. When it is necessary to stitch a wound it should 
be done with clean sewing material — silk, linen, catgut or any of the sewing 
materials that are sold for human practice. Of course you should use the 
heaviest, or two or three thicknesses and bring the edges of the wound as 
close and even as it is possible. Take out the stitches as soon as you believe 
a union of the tissues has taken place. 

BANDAGING AND STITCHING WOUNDS.— In case of wounds on 
the legs a light bandage or a strip of adhesive plaster wound around the leg 
will hold the edges of a wound together almost as well as stitches. When 
stitches are required, either silk or catgut should be used ; the silk holds 
better bijt of course will not be absorbed as catgut will. The silk stitches need 
to be taken out. (See " Wounds " in both this and the " Horse Department") 
PEOPLE'S HOME REMEDIES FOR SORES AND FOUL FLESH.— 

1. Oil of Vitriol. — Cleanse the parts with water and then bathe with 
half a teaspoonful of oil of vitriol diluted in half a teacupful of water. 

SCREW WORMS IN WOUNDS— MAGGOTS IN WOUNDS.— When- 
ever a wound is neglected during hot weather it is liable to be inhabited by 
screw worms or maggots. Apply one part carbolic acid and thirty parts 
water or one part coal-tar disinfectant to thirty parts water or apply peroxide 
of hydrogen, then apply equal parts powdered alum, oxide of zinc and iodo- 
form. Sometimes, dropping in turpentine not only kills the maggots but stimu- 
lates a healthy action. Other fairly good remedies are one part bi-chloride of 
mercury and five hundred parts water or one part chloride of zinc and five 
hundred parts water. Or, apply equal parts of iodoform, powdered aliim and 
boric acid. Wounds of this kind should be treated twice a day and should be 
covered with oakum. In summer apply pine-tar as soon as the sore ceases 
to suppurate and this will keep the flies away. 

AIR UNDER THE SKIN.— Frequently, following a wound, air makes 
its way into the tissues beneath the skin, giving rise to an enormous swelling. 
Tapping on the skin with the fingers produces a crackling noise and drum- 
like sound. 

TREATMENT. — Keep the animal quiet and make large wounds through 
the skin in order to let out the air ; also hand rub the parts. 



174 THE PEOPLE'S HOME STOCK BOOK. 

WOUNDS OF THE LIPS.— 

, CAUSES.— rThese are caused by coming in contact with nails, barbed wire, 
splinters on boards and sometimes by blows. I have known of swollen lips 
being the result of a snake bite. 

SYMPTOMS. — External wounds are of course easily seen but the lips 
may be wounded on the inside by the animal's picking up pieces of glass or 
foreign bodies that are sharp and uneven; therefore, in making an examina- 
tion, the inside of the lips should be examined closely. 

TREATMENT. — If the lips ar© only bruised with a dull substance and 
there is no open wound, apply simple home remedies, such as hot or cold 
water or one part witch hazel and two parts water. Or, dissolve one ounce 
of borax in a quart of cold water or put four ounces of fluid extract of arnica 
into a quart of cold water and apply to the lips four or five times daily. If 
you suspect that a snake bite is the cause, give not less than one-half pint 
of whiskey several times a day for a day or two. Nearly all home healing 
remedies will be found useful in treating wounded lips. 

INJURIES TO EYE.— (See " Diseases of Eye and Ear.") 

INJURIES TO EAR.— (See " Diseases of Eye and Ear.") 

FRACTURES— BROKEN BONES.— A fracture is usually the result of 
an injury and the proper treatment for such is to place the broken bone in its 
original position and if held there for a few weeks a bony union usually takes 
place ; however, in old animals this may not be the case and when the bones 
move and are not kept in place a fibrous union occurs which is not nearly 
so satisfactory as if a bony union had taken place. There are many ways in 
which bones may be held in position by bandages of various kinds. The most 
satisfactory plan is to use prepared plaster of Paris bandages; the directions 
go with them and they are not expensive. These may be applied to fractures 
of the limbs. Splints of card board, wood or whale bone wrapped with 
cotton and held on with bandages do very well. When the animal is kept on 
foot a temporary sling should be used for a few weeks. 

HIP JOINT LAMENESS.— (See " Horse Department") 
HIPPED— FRACTURE OF THE HIP BONE.— 

CAUSES. — This ailment is usually the result of an accident by rushing 
through a narrow door or falling or being kicked, striking the point of the 
hip and breaking the bone. This kind of a fracture is not very dangerous for 
either a fibrous or bony union takes place, leaving the point of the hip down 
and in. 

TREATMENT. — Keep the animal quiet in a standing position until the 
bones unite, which requires four or five weeks. Dissolve one-quarter pound 
of sugar of lead in a gallon of water, adding eight ounces of fluid extract of 
opium and apply to sore parts twice a day; or apply spirits of Camphor. If 
the bone does not unite it will perhaps produce an abscess and the detached 
piece should be removed and the end of the bone made smooth. In some 
cases it is not necessary to treat them for if the bone is held in position by 
the muscles they get well without treatment. 

BITES OF INSECTS AND SNAKES.— There are too many varieties 
of insects and too many kinds of snakes for me to speak of each one separately ; 
therefore, I shall give you general treatment for all kinds that have come 
under my observation. 

TREATMENT.— For insect bites apply lead lotion which is made by 
dissolving one-half ounce of sugar of lead in a quart of water and, if the swell- 



CATTLE— VARIOUS DISEASES. 175 

ing produces much pain, add one-fourth part laudanum. Or, apply equal parts 
of aqua ammonia and sweet oil, or some camphorated oil and, if the animal 
is very dull or dumpish, give some whiskey or alcohol every two or three 
hours. In case of snake bites, either touch the sore with caustic or the point 
of a ret hot iron. In many cases I have thought that tincture of iodine gave 
as good results as any drug I had pver used. 

HYDROPHOBIA— RABIES.— This is an infectious disease caused by 
an invisible organism which is transmitted from one animal to another usu- 
ally by a bite when suffering from the disease or by direct inoculation. This 
ailment is most common in the dog, perhaps on account of dogs running at 
large and biting others. The dog shows two forms of rabies — furious and 
dumb, the dumb being much the more common. In furious rabies the animal 
seeks a dark place for a day or two, gradually becoming more restless, drink- 
ing lots of water, eating sticks, stones and other rubbish and some dogs travel 
many miles from home and return to die from exhaustion or paralysis after 
biting many animals. During their journey they are far more likely to bite 
other animals than man. In the dumb form the animal seeks dark places, 
becoming nervous. The throat and lower jaw become paralyzed, the lower 
jaw dropping and remaining open and the voice changing from a bark to a 
howl. When in this condition they are unable to bite a person ; however, they 
sometimes change to a more furious state and bite. In the horse the symp- 
toms are restlessness, unusual violence, kicking and biting and very 
often the showing of sexual excitement. I have known horses with rabies to 
eat a hind leg almost completely off. The disease usually develops in from 
eight to twenty-one days; however, it may not develop for several months. 
It usually runs its course in from two to eight or ten days and terminates in 
death. As this disease advances cattle become unusually excitable and vicious 
and suffer from spasms and appear to suffer a great deal of pain during the 
later stages of the disease and show partial paralysis of the hind quarters. 

TREATMENT. — As there is no curative remedy the treatment should be 
preventive. If bitten by a dog, burn the wound with a red hot iron, or with 
caustic to destroy the infection. The preventive treatment used in man is 
far too expensive to be used on animals. 

CEREBRO-SPINAL MENINGITIS.— (See "Horse Department.") 

VERTIGO— BLIND STAGGERS— FALLING FITS.— (See "Horse 
Department.") 

APOPLEXY. — This ailment is usually the result of congestion or stag- 
nation of blood in the brain or of rupture of some small blood vessel which 
causes a clot that produces pressure on a portion of the brain. 

CAUSES. — The causes are high feeding and under exercising ; or, exertion 
in excessively hot weather, especially if the animal is very fleshy. 

SYMPTOMS. — Apoplexy develops suddenly, the pupil of the eye is al- 
ways dilated and the animal breathes heavily. In some cases only a portion 
of the body is affected. 

TREATMENT. — In fleshy animals I believe in blood-letting, taking away 
not less than two gallons. Give from one to two ounces of bromide of potash 
every two hours or the same quantity of hypo-sulphite of soda and as a rule 
from one to two pounds of epsom salts should be given to open the bowels. 
If the animal is in a comatose condition, pour the medicine through a rubber 
tube with a funnel for there is danger in giving it as a drench out of a bottle. 

SUNSTROKE— HEAT EXHAUSTION.— (See " Horse Department.")

LOCKJAW— TETANUS.— (See " Horse Department.") 

CHOREA.— rSee "Horse Departnlent") 

FITS— EPILEPSY.— No person has ever been able to tell what causes 
epileptic fits; however, they are claimed to be caused by some germ or or- 
ganism or diseased condition of the blood. They follow teething, worms, a 
torpid condition of the liver and chronic indigestion. 

SYMPTOMS. — The disease sets in suddenly followed by a convulsive 
spasm. 

TREATMENT. — Try to learn the cause and remove it by treating for 
such an ailment. If worms are the cause, treat for them and if the teeth, treat 
them and if the bowels are costive, give laxatives. If caused by chronic indi- 
gestion, treat the stomach and liver. 

PARALYSIS.— (See "Horse Department") 

DISEASE OF THE SPLEEN.— It is so puzzling to tell when an animal 
suflfers from disease of the spleen that it is hardly worth considering as a 
cattle ailment. Therefore, about all we can do is to treat what symptoms 
they show and feed cooling, laxative food, keeping the bowels and kidneys 
active. It is also important to exercise the animal some every day. 

MYELITIS— INFLAMMATION OF THE SPINAL CORD— (See 
"Horse Department.") 

DROPSY OF THE BELLY— ASCITES.— Dropsy is not a djsease but 
a result of other ailments such as peritonitis, diseases of the liver and.debility 
following a lack of proper nutrition. ^ 

SYMPTOMS.— There is a general dullness; an increase of size in belly, 
especially the lower part; a paleness of the mucous membrane ©f the mouth 
and eye ; a loss of appetite and an irregular rumination of food. By tapping 
the abdomen with the ends of the fingers a dull sound is produced and if the 
hand is passed into the abdominal cavity through the bowel, water can be 
felt; besides, the fluctuation can sometimes be determined by pressing the 
right flank. When there is dropsy, the shape of the lower portion of the belly 
seems to differ from its shape in all other ailments. 

TREATMENT. — Feed a good quality of nutritious food and give one 
ounce of ground gentian, one dram of ground nux vomica and one-half ounce 
of nitrate of potash at a dose in feed three times a day. The bowels and kid- 
neys should be kept active. When the effusion is great I never hesitate to tap 
the animal, using, of course, a trocar and canula. The opening should be 
made four or five inches back of the navel on the under side of the abdomen. 
In performing this operation the trocar must be pushed only through the ab- 
dominal wall for if pushed further you may puncture a bowel and cause the 
death of the animal. 

TAPPING THE BELLY.— This is done to empty the abdominal cavity 
of water as in cases of ascites. Make an incision through the skin just back 
of the navel and insert the trocar, leaving the canula in until the fluid all 
runs out, then withdraw the instrument. It is sometimes necessary to oper- 
ate more than once. Be sure that the instrument is clean before it is used. 

WATER IN THE CHEST— HYDROTHORAX.— This is not a disease 
but is a result of other ailments. An accumulation of water takes place in the. 
chest and this condition is generally found following a bad case of pleurisy. 

SYMPTOMS. — Whenever water commences to accumulate in the chest 
the worst symptoms of pleurisy seem to somewhat subside. Here is where 
the veterinarian and stockman are often deceived but after a short time the 



CATTLE— VARIOUS DISEASES. 177 

ft 
animal is worse and soon shows it. The nostrils flap, breathing is labored 
and the flanks heave and the legs and chest become dropsical. By listening, 
a murmur can be heard in the bottom of the chest and the heart can often 
be heard splashing in water. Percussion on the ribs makes a very dull sound 
if the tapping is low down. The pulse is quick and weak. When, death takes 
place it is caused by crowding the lungs to the upper part of the chest, thus 
causing' sufifocation. 

TREATMENT. — Give three drams of acetate of potash and two drams 
of fluid extract of digitalis at a dose three times a day ; or give one dram of 
iodide potassium at a dose three times a day; or give a tablespoonful of pow- 
dered saltpeter at a dose two or three times a day. It is well to keep the 
bowels and kidneys moderately active, also groom the body twice a day. If 
the animal's appetite is poor give two tablespoonfuls of ground gentian, two 
tablespoonfuls of ground ginger and a teaspoonful of ground nux vomica at 
a dose three times a day. This will improve the appetite. Be sure to furnish 
the patient with nutritious food such as well-cooked oatmeal gruel and eggs 
or milk and whiskey to keep up the strength. 

TAPPING THE CHEST. — This is done in case of an excessive accumu- 
lation of water in the chest. A trocar and canula such as are used in tapping 
horses should be used. However, a veterinarian is the proper person to do it 
for if an inexperienced person attempts it he may get into trouble. 

RHEUMATISM. — This is a disease that is by no means well under- 
stood; however, it is doubtless the result of too much acid, in the system, 
which has a tendency to produce inflammation and pain of some part or parts 
of the body, quite often afifecting the joints, sheaths of the tendons and syn- 
ovial membranes. It is known by its changing from one part of the body to 
another. The acute form is the most common, causing swelling and some- 
times suppuration and a discharge of synovia from the opening. In the 
chronic form the joints stiffen, become diseased and sometimes become per- 
fectly stiff. In some cases the pleura and heart are involved, resulting in 
death. In other cases the muscles are aflfected and remain so, causing them 
to contract. A shifting lameness with joint swellings indicates rheumatism. 
The bowels are generally costive and the coat dry. The joints may suppurate. 

TREATMENT. — Good care is the treatment. Keep the bowels open and 
the kidneys active ; also, keep the animal warm and apply mustard and water 
or some good home liniment such as is made by mixing equal parts of turpen- 
tine, aqua ammonia and sweet oil. Give two drams of salicylate of soda three 
times a day or give a tablespoonful of powdered saltpeter at a dose in feed 
or water three times a day. Any one of the above remedies do good in such 
cases. Rubbing with spirits of camphor, alcohol or oil of mustard partially 
reUeves the pain. 

HOLLOW HORN AND WOLF IN THE TAIL.--These are common 
terms made use of by uninforined persons to denote a diseased condition of 
the blood when they are not able to tell what ails the ariimal. It is an imag- 
inary disease. The hollow condition of the horn exists in nearly all cattle, 
especially in thin ones and boring a hole in the horn and filling it with pepper 
and salt never did any good but often harm. Splitting the tail and using the 
same remedy cannot remedy tail ailments if the animal has any. Generous 
feeding and giving a teaspoonful of ground nux vomica, a teaspoonful of 
sulphate of iron and a tablespoonful of ground gentian in the feed three times 

3—12

• 

a day will help tone up the system. Never allow any person to make you be- 
lieve there are such ailments in cattle as hollow horn or wolf in the tail. 

PERICARDITIS. — This is an inflammation of the membrane inclosing 
the heart and is very often the result of other ailments such as pleurisy, pneu- 
monia or rheumatism and it may also follow other -constitutional diseases, 
It is true that this disease may arise independent of any other, the result of 
exposure to cold, damp weather. 

SYMPTOMS.— It usually sets in with a light chill followed by sHght 
fever, producing dullness and a quick and somewhat irregular pulse. The 
legs are usually cold, the respirations quicken, and when the left side is tapped 
with the finger it produces pain. In the secondary stages the legs stock and 
a swellins: appears under brisket and lower part of belly. 

TREATMENT. — Keep the animal in a quiet, comfortable stable, hand 
rub the legs and clothe the body warmly. Give easily digested food in mod- 
erate quantities several times a day. In the early stages of this ailment give 
one-pound doses of epsom salts daily until the bowels move freely and if the 
temperature is high give 35 drops of tincture of aconite every three hours for 
a day or two, then give one dram of fluid extract of digitalis and one dram 
of -fluid extract of nux vomica thjee times" a day. Or, give a tablespoonful of 
powdered saltpeter and two tablespoonfuls of baking soda at a dose in feed 
three times daily. 

PLETHORA. — This is a rich condition of the blood that interferes with 
circulation; consequently, poisonous materials are not eliminated from the 
system and,, of course, this leads to many congestive and inflammatory ail- 
ments. 

CAUSES. — Feeding too much rich nutritious food such as oil meal, corn, 
oats, barley or rye, without the animal's getting enough exercise, also forcing 
the growth of the animal beyond a certain point are causes. Being kept in 
too warm a stable and breathing impure air are other causes. 

SYMPTOMS. — There is an unusually thrifty condition, the animal laying 
on flesh rapidly but showing slight fever at times followed later by conges- 
tion and later on by inflammation. 

TREATMENT. — Give a cathartic of epsom salts or linseed 6il and reduce 
the food supply. Instead of grain, feed some vegetables and well salted bran 
mashes ; also, give one-half ounce of saltpeter at a dose in the feed two or three 
times a day. Do not forget that exercise is one of the best remedies for 
plethora. 
ANEMIA.— 

CAUSES. — ^This is a condition of the blood just the opposite to plethora 
and is generally brought on by want of sufficient food or fresh air. Exposure 
to cold and storms, lice or other parasites, also indigestion and other debili- 
tating diseases may lead to anemia. Dropsy or purpura hemorrhagica may 
follow cases of this kind or they may end in rheumatism. 

SYMPTOMS. — The animal has pale membranes, is unthrifty, weak, dull 
and always inclined to stock and it may be lousy. 

TREATMENT.— If lousy, apply an infusion of stavesacre seeds, which 
is prepared by boiling one ounce of crushed seeds in a quart of water, then 
add water to make one quart before using. Give mineral tonics such as sul- 
phate of iron in teaspoonful doses three times a day; or give a teaspoonful 
of liquid chloride or irOn at a dose three times daily. Any good home tonics, 
such as quinine, gentian, quassia, ginger, cinchona or Fowler's solution are 



CATTLE— VARIOUS DISEASES. 179 

proper remedies but never forget the importance of plenty of good food. Keep 
the bowels and kidneys active. 

PURPURA HEMORRHAGICA.— This is a specific blood disease seldom 
affecting cattle but most commonly affecting horses. 

SYMPTOMS. — It is generally due to an impoverished condition of the 
blood which oozes through the walls of the blood vessels, causing extensive 
swellings of the head and limbs and under the belly. It often follows debili- 
tating diseases or exposure to cold storms ; it also follows exhaustion and ' 
usually comes on suddenly. The swelling pits on pressure, the mucous 
lining of the nose and mouth is covered with red or purple spots and some- 
times abscesses form, causing death. 

TREATMENT. — Place in a dry, clean, well-ventilated stable ; feed plenty 
of rich nourishing food; also give thirty grains of quinine and two drams of 
tincture of chloride of iron in three ounces of raw linseed oil every four hours 
for two or three days. Hot blankets are helpful in cases of abdominal pain. 
The serum treatment has given me fairly good results in the majority of 
cases where I have tried it, but of course it is more expensive than drugs. 
When it is employed give it early and in full doses. Lead lotions or vinegar 
and water applied to the swellings on the head help to keep the swelling in

BLOOD POISONING— PY.EMIA— SEPTICAEMIA.— This is a con- 
dition that generally results from absorbing into the system some sort of 
poisonous matter from a suppurating surface or ulcer or from picking up pus 
or germs of some kind. 

SYMPTOMS. — There is a rise in temperature, loss of appetite, quick 
breathing, loss of flesh and, in serious cases, delirium. There may be an 
external abscess, or perhaps one situated out of sight, which causes all the 
trouble. 

TREATMENT. — Ascertain the cause and if it is an abscess open it and 
wash out with one part peroxide of hydrogen and three parts water, applied 
very slowly; ten minutes later apply one part carbolic acid and thirty parts 
water and repeat three times a day. Give thirty grains of quinine and half 
a teacupful of whiskey four times a day. If the bowels are costive give epsom 
salts or raw linseed oil to move them, also give a tablespoonful of powdered 
saltpeter at a dose twice a day. 

INFLAMMATION OF THE VEINS— PHLEBITIS.— This condition 
of the veins is usually the result of infection by an animal's rubbing a wound 
where the vein has either been punctured or exposed. 

SYMPTOMS. — When inflammation follows the operation of blood-letting 
the wall of the vein usually thickens and the wound discharges a watery fluid 
and when the pin is taken out it can be noticed that the skin has not united. 
This inflammation may extend along the vein a considerable distance ; also, an 
abscess may form causing the formation of pus which always interferes with 
the circulation of blood through the vein. But cattle have an accessory jugu- 
lar vein which carries on the work if the other becomes clogged. 

TREATMENT.— Same as for Horses. 

HOW to RING A BULL.— First of all you must secure the bull by 
placing him in stocks or stanchion, throwing him or placing him in a narrow 
stall. Tie him short, place a small block of wood in one nostril, set the punch 
in the other and strike it a blow. This makes a hole through the cartilage ; 
then place th,e ring and set the screw and your work is completed. Some

stockmen burn a hole through the nose partition with a pointed iron when at 
white heat ; this can be done quickly if you have an assistant to help. 

BLEEDING— BLOOD-LETTING.-^Nearly all ancient writers on veter- 
inary subjects were inclined to recommend blood-letting for common ailments 
of live stock ; however, the practice has largely gone into disuse, not only in 
human practice but in veterinary practice also. 

DEHORNING. — In young calves apply caustic potash as soon as the 
horn bud can be felt and be sure to apply it to the whole horn for if this first 
application is thorough it will prevent the horn's ever growing. In making 
this application do not get the caustic too wet for, if so, it may burn the healthy 
parts and perhaps some of it get into the eye. In removing the horns from 
an adult, place the animal in a stanchion or stocks or tie the head firmly and 
short to a post. Snap a nose ring into the nose, pull the head round to one 
side, use the dehorning shears and then apply one part carbolic acid -and ten 
parts pine tar, covering it with either oakum or cotton. To stop bleeding 
apply Monsell's solution of iron or use a red hot iron or tie a silk thread about 
the artery. Sometimes I take hold of the artery with the forceps and twist it. 
This stops the blood very quickly. In some cases pus forms, and if this is the 
case apply peroxide of hydrogen and dust on equal parts of iodoform, pow- 
dered alum and tannic acid.

SHEEP, 



DISEASES OF THE DIGESTIVE ORGANS. 

(Including Colic or Stretches, Bloating, Diarrhea in Lambs, Constipation, 
Stomach Worms, Fluke Worms, Nodular Disease, Choking, Etc.) 



COLIC— STRETCHES.— 

CAUSES. — Drinking too much ice cold water and eating too much badly 
cured fodder or grain and eating frozen vegetables or grass are the causes of 
colic or stretches, 

SYMPTOMS. — The symptoms are : getting up and down frequently, 
stretching as if in pain, striking the belly with the feet and refusing to eat. 

TREATMENT. — Any good home colic remedy is all right, or give a tea- 
spoonful of essence of peppermint, a teaspoonful of ginger and twenty drops of 
laudanum at a dose every hour or two until the pain ceases. Apply mustard 
and water to the lower part of the abdomen and it will relieve the pain. If the 
bowels are not moving freely give epsom salts to open them. 
PEOPLE'S HOME REMEDIES FOR COLIC OR STRETCHES.— 

1. Soda and Ginger. — In water as a drench give a dram each of common 
baking soda and ground ginger. If the first dose does not effect a cure a 
second dose may be given in an hour. If the second dose is necessary it is 
well to give five ounces of raw linseed oil. 
PEOPLE'S HOME REMEDIES FOR LAMB CHOLERA.— 

1. Ether and Milk. — Mix one-fourth ounce of sulphuric ether with two 
ounces of warm milk and give at a dose. Repeat in two hours if necessary. 
This remedy can be depended upon to cure lamb cholera. 

HOVEN— BLOATING— TYMPANITES.— These ailments are the re- 
sults of fermentation of food that the sheep have eaten, causing distension of 
the stomach and bowels. 

CAUSES. — Drinking too much very cold water, eating frozen vegetables 
or grass, also eating too much young grass are the causes. 

SYMPTOMS.— The left side is puffed out and if tapped it will sound 
drum-like. The sheep is always uneasy, getting up and down and showing 
symptoms of suffering considerable pain. 

TREATMENT. — Give a dessert spoonful of aromatic spirits of ammonia, 
one-half ounce hypo-sulphite of soda and a teaspoonful of tincture of ginger 
at a dose in a pint of cold water every two hours until pain ceases and the 
bloat goes down. If the bowels are costive give three ounces of epsom salts 
in one-half pint of water, adding a little ginger. If you believe there is danger 
of the stomach or bowels bursting, puncture the stomach and allow the gas to 
escape. The wool should first be cut off and some disinfectant applied to the 
skin. A clean trocar and canula should be used. The place to puncture is at 
the most prominent point of the bloating. Pull out the trocar but leave the 
cantila in until all the gas is out.

182 THE PEOPLE'S HOME STOCK BOOK. 

PEOPLE'S HOME REMEDIES FOR BLOATING.— 

1. Soda, Ginger and Ammonia. — With a pint of water mix one dram each 
of common baking soda and ginger and eight drams of aromatic spirits of am- 
monia. This is one dose and may be repeated in an hour if necessary. 
IMPACTION OF THE RUMEN.— 

CAUSES. — This comes from eating too much food that the sheep is not 
accustomed to having and eating large quantities of indigestible fodder, grain 
or grass. Badly cured clover and too ripe timothy are also causes of impaction. 

SYMPTOMS. — There is loss of appetite, labored breathing and few if 
any bowel movements. The sheep does not ruminate and by pressing the left 
side with the hand you will feel a dull hard substance. 

TREATMENT.— The first point to consider is how to unload the stom- 
ach and bowels quickly and not hurt the sheep. Give four or five ounces of 
epsom salts, one, dram of tincture of ginger and ten drops of tincture of nux 
vomica in one-fourth pint of water as a drench. This should move the bowels. 
If it fails, give raw linseed oilor some more of the salts. Injections of soap 
and water should be used. If the sheep is much bloated give some aromatic 
spirits of ammonia, peppermint and ginger or any good home remedy for 
flatulent colic. 

ENTERITIS— INFLAMMATION OF THE BOWELS.— Enteritis is 
quite a common sickness in sheep. 

CAUSES. — It very often follows impaction or colic and is also brought on 
by exposure to cold and from eating the wrong kind of food, or it is sometimes 
the result of giving irritating drtigs. 

TREATMENT. — Whenever the abdominal pain is continuous instead of 
spasmodic you can safely say it is inflammation of the bowels and not colic. 
Apply mustard and water to the abdomen twice a day. Also give a teaspoon- 
ful of laudanum, twenty drops of fluid extract of belladonna, four drops of 
tincture of aconite and eight or ten ounces of raw linseed oil at a dose every 
two hours until pain ceases. Also give two grains of calomel, one dose only. 
DIARRHEA IN LAMBS.— 

CAUSES. — If every ewe's udder could be washed clean just before the 
young lambs suck, fewer lambs would have diarrhea and if the lambs' first 
milk allowance could be somewhat limited, they would have less bowel 
trouble; besides, young larfibs very often chill and this produces bowel 
trouble. 

TREATMENT. — The lamb should be given a small dose of castor oil or 
sweet oil with a few drops of tincture of ginger or a teaspoonful of whiskey 
or three drops of tincture of opium (laudanum) and, if necessary, give a few 
drops of tincture of rhubarb, spirits of camphor and ginger or laudanum with 
some whiskey. Treat an ailment of this kind in lambs just as if treating chil- 
dren and you will be successful in relieving them. I have obtained good re- 
sults by keeping the lamb perfectly quiet and changing its food and giving 
one drop of creosote and three drops of fluid extract of cinnamon in some 
of the mother's milk three or four times a day. 

DYSENTERY.— Dysentery is caused by an inflammation of the mucous 
membrane of the bowels. It is generally the result of neglected cases of diar- 
rhea or eating bad food, which brings pn irritation of the bowels. It also fol- 
lows giving too much cathartic medicine at a time and too often. 

SYMPTOMS.— There is some fever and loss of appetite and the bowel 
movements are liquid and tinged with blood and have a bad odor. 



SHEEP— DISEASES OF DIGESTIVE ORGANS. 183 

TREATMENT. — In the treatment of dysentery it is generally good prac- 
tice to give two or three ounces of castor oil or sweet oil to clear out the 
stomach and bowels. Also give a teaspoonful or more of tincture of opium 
(laudanum), a teaspoonful of tincture of ginger and the same quantity of 
tincture of catechu at a dose in a little warm water as a drench every two or 
three hours until the bowel discharges lessen. It is always a good plan to 
give preparations of iron for a few days. The sulphate of iron is the least 
expensive and one-third of a teaspoonful given at a dose two or three times 
a day in feed will act both as a tonic and bowel astringent. It is also impor- 
tant to feed gruel for two or three days instead of whole grain or dry fodder. 
CONSTIPATION.— 

CAUSES. — Constipation comes from milking the ewe before she Iambs. 
The milk then does not possess the same laxative properties which it would 
if she had not been 'milked before lambing time. When the lambs are fed 
cow's milk without its being diluted with water or sweetened, constipation 
is likely to be the result. In lambs it is no doubt often the result of keeping 
the ewes in a constipated state for some time before lambing. It is a good 
plan to have the bowels open at lambing time and then your lambs will do 
better. 

SYMPTOMS. — The lamb bloats somewhat, is slightly distressed and 
strains to move its bowels but fails in the effort. The first passage is gener- 
ally waxy and adheres to the walls of the bowel, making, it almost impossible 
for the weak young lamb to force the plug out; besides, the bowel seems to 
be almost closed. 

TREATMENT. — The first step is to use some sweet oil, raw Unseed oil, 
soap, vaseline, fresh butter, or lard. Also give the lamb a small teaspoonful of 
sweet oil at a dose two or three times a day until the bowels move easily. 
PEOPLE'S HOME REMEDIES FOR CONSTIPATION IN LAMBS.— 

1. Preventive. — For two or three days after lambing give the ewe each 
day a warm mash made of a pint of bran with a tablespoonful of salt added. 
This will prevent constipation in the lamb. 

STOMACH WORMS. — Stomach worms trouble sheep more than the 
breeder is inclined to believe; but, of course, if they are not numerous the 
breeder may never know how much they bother the sheep. Lambs are more 
often affected than old sheep. 

SYMPTOMS. — The sheep that has stomach worms usually eats plenty 
but loses flesh and becomes unthrifty. The bowels are generally too loose 
but the sheep does not appear sick. The stomach worm is about % of 
an inch long and is most often found in the fourth stomach of lambs and 
sheep. It is not unusual to find a whole flock afflicted and sometimes it is 
necessary to treat the whole flock. 

TREATMENT. — The quickest and most satisfactory results are obtained 
by giving three ounces of a solution made by adding one part of coal-tar 
creosote to ninety or one hundred parts of water. Give a dose twice a week 
for two weeks. Or, give a dessert spoonful of gasoline in three ounces of 
sweet milk twice a week for two weeks, or give a teaspoonful of turpentine 
in three ounces of sweet oil once a week for three weeks. Feed the sheep 
one part of powdered sulphate of iron in thirty parts of salt once a week. 
This will help your flock. It is also important to feed plentyof grain at such 
times for the sheep are generally run down and need building up. 



184 THE PEOPLE'S HOME STOCK BOOK, 

PEOPLE'S HOME REMEDIES FOR WORMS.— 

1. Salt and Sulphur. — Mix one part of sulphur with ten parts of salt and 
keep before the sheep all the time and they will not be troubled with worms. 

2. Salt and Turpentine. — Keep salt constantly before the sheep and frc' 
quently sprinkle a few drops of turpentine over it. This will prevent worms 
and ticks. 

3. Coal-Tar Creosote. — Mix coal-tar creasote with thirty parts of w^Jter 
and give one tablespoonful. Repeat this dose in 34 hours. 

4. Milk and Gasoline. — Mix one part gasoline with ten parts of milk and 
give a tablespoonful twice a day for two or three days. 

PEOPLE'S HOME REMEDIES FOR STAGGERS OR LOSS OF APPE- 
TITE.— 

1. Turpentine. — If the sheep has the staggers give it a teaspoonful of 
turpentine. The dose seldom has to be repeated. 

TAPEWORMS. — Tapeworms are more common in sheep in some local- 
ities than in others. They vary in length from five to twenty feet. They are 
perhaps one-twentieth part of an inch wide at the head and about % inch wide 
at the tail. They are of a white color and are generally found in the small 
intestines. 

SYMPTOMS. — Sheep that have tapeworms usually scour, become blood- 
less, have a white skin, show weakness and great emaciation and sometimes 
die. The eyes are dull. The appetite is good but the sheep fails to thrive. 
By watching the excrement, joints of the worm may be discovered. 

TREATMENT. — Get the stomach and bowels empty. Give a teaspoon* 
ful of powdered kamala and a teaspoonful of oiLof male fern in 3 ounces of 
sweet oil as a drench twice a week until the tapeworm comes away. Another 
very good remedy is two drams of kamala given in one ounce of castor oil on 
an empty stomach. When treating for tapeworm be sure to fast the sheep to 
have the stomach and bowels empty. In order to know if your treatment 
proves effective keep them in a barn by themselves and examine their evacua- 
tions closely and try to find the head of the tapeworm. If you have never 
drenched a sheep before — let him stand in a natural position, avoid holding 
the head too high and pour the medicine into the mouth slowly for fear a 
portion of it will pass down the windpipe. If taken slowly it generally passes 
into the fourth stomach where it should go. 

SHEDDING TEMPORARY TEETH.— Between one and two years of 
age the sheep sometimes have trouble in shedding some of their milk teeth. 
When they do not eat well but show no symptoms of sickness, examine their 
teeth and you will perhaps find a cap that requires removing and, if so, do not 
hesitate to pull it out with a pair of pincers and the sheep will eat better at 
once. 

DISEASED TEETH.— It is very often necessary to pull a few remaining 
front teeth in sheep after they have shed some of them. By so doing the gums 
come together better than if these teeth were left in. The front teeth of sheep 
seem to loosen and give out first. 

FLUKE WORMS— FLUKE DISEASE— LIVER-ROT.— This affection 
is a very destructive ailment of sheep and is determined by the presence of 
flat-like parasites in the gall ducts. These parasites lay eggs in the gall ducts 
and are passed out of the body and if deposited on certain damp lands they 
soon multiply and infect all the sheep that graze on such land. 

SYMPTOMS. — The sheep may thrive very well for a few weeks but soon 



SHEEP— DISEASES OF DIGESTIVE ORGANS. 185 

begin to lose flesh and grow weak rapidly. The skin becomes soft and is 
always pale and the eyes become a sort of yellow color. The wool drops out 
easily and the sheep become dropsical and if the dung is examined large num- 
bers of microscopic eggs are readily seen. 

TREATMENT. — Drugs cut very little figure in the treatment of liver-rot 
when many parasites have gained access to the system. The most important 
step is to remove the sheep to a high and dry pasture for if kept on a wet low 
one the whole flock will die. By feeding plenty of salt and draining your low 
wet pastures you will obtain better results than by any other means. Keeping 
the sheep off the infested fields at night and until all the dew has dried off the 
following morning will go quite a ways toward lessening the death rate in your 
sheep, but of course an infested pasture should be abandoned until the para- 
sites die and sheep should never be turned into any kind of a meadow that is 
not high and dry. It is a pretty good plan to feed diseased sheep some of the 
following compound. Take powdered gentian, powdered anise seed, powdered 
sulphate of iron and common salt, equal parts by weight, giving % a tea- 
.spoonful at a dose to each sheep every day. Owing to the rapid spread of this 
ailment it is sometimes good judgment to destroy sheep and abandon the 
meadow for a year in order to stamp it out. Their bowel discharges should 
be examined microscopically by a person who can tell when the liver fluke 
parasite is present. 

PEOPLE'S HOME REMEDIES FOR FLUKE WORMS.— 

1. Sulphur, Salt and Ashes. — Keep before the sheep constantly a mixture 
of equal parts of sulphur, salt and wood ashes. This will keep them in good 
condition and prevent their being troubled with the fluke worm. 
CHOKING.— 

CAUSES. — Sheep are most often choked by eating vegetables that have 
not been sliced properly or by eating dry meal too fast. 

SYMPTOMS.— When a sheep is choked it froths at the mouth, usually 
bloats some, is unable to eat and sometimes has a spasm of the muscles of the 
neck. 

TREATMENT. — An effort should be made to assist them in swallowing 
the obstruction and this is b6st done by giving thein oil or grease, and fifteen 
drops of laudanum or fluid extract of belladonna should be added. It is 
often necessary to pass a probang ; or, a rubber tube may be run down the 
throat. It must not be forgotten that the throat and gullet are easily injured ; 
therefore, care must be taken not to puncture them. After a choke feed gruel 
or wet mash for ten days. 

NODULAR DISEASE. — Nodular disease is quite prevalent all over this 
country and is what butchers and sheep raisers call " knotty guts " and is quite 
unlike all other ailments of sheep. The disease is caused by a small worm 
from one-half to one inch in length and it seems to be an American species 
for sheep seem to be free, or almost free, from this disease in Australia and 
Germany. On examination the walls of the intestines are found covered with 
small nodules filled with a greenish pus. These nodules are caused by a small 
worm about the size of the stomach worm or smaller but it is not the adult 
worm but its embryo that really produces this trouble. The way this disease 
is spread is by allowing diseased sheep to graze on land that is used later by 
sound sheep. Preventing the lambs from grazing behind their mothers will 
help prevent their becoming diseased. It is the older sheep that are most 



186 THE PEOPLE'S HOME STOCK BOOK. 

aflfected with this disease but lambs frequently have a few nodules but not 
enough to do much harm. 

SYMPTOMS. — The most noticeable symptoms are much the same as 
those presented in stomach worms and many times a correct diagnosis can 
not be made until after death. 

TREATMENT. — When in the advanced stages nothing can be done 
that seems to cure nodular disease in sheep. Three ounces of a one per 
cent, solution of coal-tar creosote, or a teaspoonful of gasoline in four ounces 
of sweet milk, or two ounces of sweet oil once a week for three Weeks is sup- 
posed to help them. Also, giving from fifteen to twenty-five grains of sul- 
phate of iron at a dose in feed daily will help them. Plenty of good feed and 
salting them well, at the same time giving tonics, are beneficial. 

By inspecting the intestines of sheep at the different slaughtering estab- 
lishments of this country and talking with both the United States and City 
Meat Inspectors I find that nearly all the sheep that are slaughtered .show a 
few nodules on the bowels which could have done no harm; but when they 
have a great many their bowels are irritated, digestion interrupted, and the 
animals grow weak. 



DISEASES OF THE RESPIRATORY OR 
BREATHING ORGANS. 

(Including Catarrh, Sore Throat, Distemper, Bronchitis, Filaria Bronchitis 

and Pneumonia.) 



CATARRH— COLD IN THE HEAD.— Catarrh is an inflammation of 
the mucous membrane that lines the nasal and upper air passages. 

CAUSES. — During the washing season and following the shearing of 
sheep they are quite likely to suffer from cold in the head. It is also caused 
by exposure in wet weather, and it also follows exposure to too much dust as 
when traveling over dusty roads. 

SYMPTOMS. — There is a discharge from the nose, some coughing, sneez- 
ing and some loss of appetite. 

TREATMENT. — If it is possible to find out the cause, do so, and remove 
it, for this will do much for your sheep. Keep them in a dry comfortable 
place, feed them well, keep their bowels open and give each sick one % tea- 
spoonful of sulphate of iron, % teaspoonful of gentian root (ground or pow- 
dered), one-fourth of a teaspoonful of flower sulphur and % teaspoonful of 
powdered charcoal at a dose in feed or as a drench twice a day. A very good 
condition powder to give sheep that have catarrh is made of powdered sulphate 
of iron, gentian, ginger, fenugreek and baking soda ; use equal parts of each 
by weight and give one-half teaspoonful to each sheep at a dose two or three 
times a day. Feed some vegetables and keep their bowels open. 
SORE THROAT.— 

CAUSES. — Exposure to cold rain or snow storms, cooling the body sud- 
denly, being in dust or being stabled in foul filthy barns are some of the most 
common causes of sore throat in sheep. 

SYMPTOMS. — ^There is a poking out of the nose and soreness of the 
throat and when pressure is applied there is generally some coughing. Usu- 
ally some of the water returns through the nose when they drink. 

TREATMENT. — Apply equal parts of turpentine, aqua ammonia and 
either sweet oil or raw linseed oil to the throat once a day or you may apply 
any good home liniment or apply one part kerosene and four parts of lard. 
Steam the head with creosote or carbolic acid and hot water twice a day. 
Also give two tablespoonfuls of the following gargle at a dose three times a 
day. Dissolve two drams of chlorate of potash in a pint of water and give 
according to above directions. 
PEOPLE'S HOME REMEDIES FOR SORE MOUTH.— 

1. Turpentine and Sweet Oil. — ^Without raising the sheep's nose, pour 
one part turpentine and six parts sweet oil over the nose and mouth. Also 
mix some salt and turpentine with bran and feed to those affected. 

DISTEMPER. — Distemper in sheep is a disease very much like dis- 
temper in horses and canine distemper in dogs and when a recovery does not 
take place in two or three weeks it becomes malignant and not easily cured. 

SYMPTOMS. — This disease is usually preceded by a chill or chilly feel- 
ing and is followed by some fever, a quickened heart action and some nasal 

187 



188 THE PEOPLE'S* HOME STOCK BOOK. 

discharge which soon thickens and sticks to the nostrils. When the disease 
becomes aggravated, the discharge is thick and mixed with blood and there 
is much prostration and the pulse is weak and breathing is difificult; they will 
then die if not relieved soon. 

TREATMENT. — A change of not only food but air is of great import- 
ance in getting them well. They should be well fed on grain, clover hay, 
vegetables and grass if possible. Give a teaspoonful of the following com- 
pound powder at a dose in feed or water as a drench two or three times a day. 
Mix gentian root, (powdered), ginger, granulated carbonate of ammonia and 
charcoal. If they cough much give ten drops of tincture of opium, ten grains 
of muriate of ammonia and ten drops of tincture of lobelia at a dose in feed or 
water twice a day. It always helps them to steam the head, adding a little 
creosote or carbolic acid to the hot water and this should be done daily. Their 
noses should be washed out with weak salt-water. 

BRONCHITIS. — Bronchitis is an inflammation of the air passages of 
the lungs. 

CAUSES. — Exposure to storms and dust; the presence of ■ filaria, or a 
small thread-like worm, in the bronchial tubes and inhaling irritating gases 
are causes of bronchitis. It is also caused by improper drenching of sheep 
when some of the medicine goes down the windpipe instead of the gullet. 

TREATMENT. — Keep the animal in a comfortable pen free from dust. 
Feed bran mash, vegetables or grass. Apply liniment to the chest. Give ten 
drops of laudanum, ten drops of fluid extract of belladonna and forty drpps 
of sweet spirits of nitre in three ounces of cold water as a drench three times 
a day. It is helpful to give some whiskey, eggs, milk and oatmeal in the later 
stages of this ailment, especially when the sheep are weak. 
FILARIA BRONCHITIS.— 

CAUSES. — Fildria bronchitis is the result of small slim worms inhabiting 
the bronchial tubes, thereby setting up irritation. 

SYMPTOMS. — ^There is always loss of appetite, rubbing of the nose and 
quick breathing. Sometimes there is looseness of the bowels and generally 
there is a husky, dry, hoarse cough. 

TREATMENT. — Give % teaspoonful of the following compound powder 
to each sheep at a dose in feed or as a drench twice a day. Use equal parts 
by weight of powdered sulphate of iron, ground ginger, gentian and flower 
sulphur. Burn sulphur and let the sheep inhale the fumes, but be sure to re- 
main in the room in order to see that they are not given too much. This 
treatment should be given once a week for four weeks and it is a good plan 
to keep the sick and healthy apart. Feed them plenty of nutritious food. 
Fairly good results follow giving one-half teaspoonful of turpentine in thfee 
tablespoonfuls of raw linseed oil twice a week. This will help them. Or, ask 
your veterinary surgeon to inject, with a hypodermic syringe, five or six 
drops of carbolic acid and ten drops of chloroform in a teaspoonful of sweet 
oil into the windpipe, the one dose only ; or, you will find gasoline and sweet 
oil produces quite good results, one-half teaspoonful of the gasoline in a 
dessert spoonful of oil. When any mixture of this kind is put into the wind- 
pipe, it produces some coughing and the sheep or calf should be kept in fresh 
air until the dead worms are tinloaded. 
PEOPLE'S HOME REMEDIES FOR STRONGYLUS FILARIA.— 

1. Turpentine and Linseed Oil. — Give one dram of turpentine in some 
linseed oil. 



SHEEP—DISEASES OF RESPIRATORY ORGANS. 189 

2, Sulphur. — Burn some sulphur where the sheep will be compelled to 
inhale the fumes, taking care not to suffocate them. This treatment should 
be repeated once a day for three or four days. 

PNEUMONIA. — Pneumonia is an inflammation of the lung substance. 

CAUSES. — An inflammation of the lungs very often follows congestion 
of the lungs. It is the result of exposure to cold storms and is very often 
associated with other diseases such as pleurisy, bronchitis and catarrhal 
affections of the air passages. 

SYMPTOMS. — There is loss of appetite, great thirst, quick breathing, 
some coughing and a quick pulse which generally grows weaker. By sound- 
ing the chest with the ear placed to the side, back of the shoulders, a grating 
sound will be heard. 

TREATMENT.-^Place the animal in a clean well-ventilated pen, not 
in a basement. It should not be forgotten that fresh air and cold water are 
two of the essentials in treating pneumonia. Also give aconite to reduce the 
fever, or give saltpeter in the drinking water. Also give tonics or stimulants 
as the case seems to demand. Good nursing and plenty of fresh air are two 
important things to look after. Also give tonics and stimulants in the later 
period of their sickness. 
PEOPLE'S HOME REMEDIES FOR PNEUMONIA.— 

1. Quinine, Whiskey, Saltpeter and Aconite. — Every six hours give .*? 
grains of quinine in half an ounce of whiskey and every four hours give 
2 grains of saltpeter and 2 drops of aconite. Begin giving the first mixture 
and wait one hour before beginning with the second remedy.

Castration, Etc.) 



LAMBING. — The usual period of gestation in ewes is from 145 to 165 
days but inost ewes lamb in about 155 days. In order to tell when ewes have 
been mated the ram is generally painted on his breast and brisket ; some of this 
paint is left on the ewe when served; so, if close watch is kept, you can tell 
pretty nearly when the ewe will lamb. After the ewe has been pregnant three 
months the udder usually commences to fill, especially if she is young, but 
if old she does not make bag so early. When ewes are making preparations to 
lamb they generally leave the rest of the flock and appear uneasy, pawing 
the ground, lying down and getting up and bleating as if looking for their 
lamb. Very soon the water bag breaks which is followed by labor pains and 
the expulsion of the lamb. 

DIFFICULT LAMBING.— It is seldom necessary to help a ewe to lamb 
and she should never be assisted unless you believe it is necessary for when she 
is taken hold of and frightened it sometimes causes her to cease having labor 
pains and greatly delays matters, then the operator fails to get the necessary 
assistance from her he otherwise would have had if her pain had kept up. The 
forelegs should come first with the nose between and when a lamb comes this 
way the ewe seldom has any trouble, but the forelegs may come with the head 
turned back, or one leg and head, or one foreleg and a hind one may come 
first. Or, she may have twins and a leg of each comes at the same time. 
Therefore, whoever assists her should study the situation and take steps to 
put the lamb in a normal position, th^n she can soon be relieved. It is 
always good practice to use some disinfectant or carbolized lard or oil and 
warm water; besides, the hand should be clean and the nails cut short. 
Push the lamb back into the uterus with either a crutch or the hand and put 
it into a normal position ; never use too much force for fear of injuring the 
ewe. Every sheep breeder should have some handy instruments for use in 
such cases. A great many lambs die from getting chilled when they are born. 
Their lives could have been saved by keeping the ewes in a warm place. If 
you find a lamb a few hours old that is chilled, dip it in warm water, a 
little warmer than body heat, then wrap it in a woolen cloth until it dries 
and keep it in a heated room for a few days. 
GARGET— MAMMITIS— INFLAMMATION OF UDDER.— 

CAUSES. — The deep udders of sheep which are easy milkers are most 
commonly affected with garget and it is generally the result of infection or 
injury or too much cold air or moisture, producing congestion followed by 
an inflammation of the bag. When an udder is infected the bacteria gen- 
erally creep through the teat opening; this is why so many free milkers are 
diseased. Of course bacteria may reach the udder of ma^y sheep, and no 
doubt they do, without doing very much harm but in many cases they seem 
to set up an active inflammation which is not easily subdued. Butting lambs 
which bruise their mothers' bag and also over-feeding cause the udder to in- 

190 



SHEEP— DISEASES OF GENERATIVE ORGANS. • 191 

flame. Any severe injury may cause a simple case of garget but the majority 
of cases show germs or bacteria in the diseased quarter. 

SYMPTOMS. — There is a tense, hard bunch in one or more quarters 
of the udder, increased heat in the bag, some fever, loss of appetite and quick 
breathing which is the result of pain. 

TREATMENT. — Support the udder with a bandage, apply hot fomenta- 
tions early and often for they give good results, and irrigate the udder with 
one part bi-chloride of mercury and one thousand parts of clean water once a 
day. It is also good practice to inflate the blocked quarter with oxygen or 
sterilized air if nothing else will open it. This may be done by pumping 
oxygen or air into the udder with a bicycle pump. I have obtained good re- 
sults from applications of hot raw linseed oil or camphorated oil. Gentle 
hand-rubbing will always help a caked bag and giving small doses of iodide 
of potassium will help to clear it. Grain should not be fed to sheep while their 
udders are much inflamed and it is important to keep the bowels open and 
active. 

CLEANING— THE PLACENTA NOT COMING AWAY.— The pla- 
centa, or cleaning, should come away very soon after lambing but if it does 
not, it should be pulled away gently. However, I like to wait five or ten 
hours before taking it away. If you give any medicine it should be a laxa- 
tive of either epsom salts, sweet oil or raw linseed oil; salts is the best. 
If the bowels are open and active it is not good practice to give a cathartic. 
I have obtained good results by giving one-dram doses of tincture of ergot 
but it is seldom necessary. 

EVERSION OF THE WOMB.— Eversion of the womb is usually the re- 
sult of violent straining when lambing or soon after, or it may be the result of 
weakness. Whenever it occurs the parts should be kept very clean. This is 
best done by placing a towel under the uterus and washing the womb with one 
part carbolic acid and one hundred parts tepid water. After you have cleaned 
the uterus, elevate her hind parts and gently return the uterus. The hind parts 
should be elevated three or four inches higher than the fore parts. Two or 
three stitches should be taken in the upper part of the vulva and left in for a 
week. A surcingle placed around her waist will prevent her displacing the 
parts and if she is in any pain give one dram of laudanum every hour or two 
until pain ceases. 

INFLAMMATION OF THE TESTICLES.— Inflammation of the testi- 
cles is generally the result of an injury. 

SYMPTOMS. — On account of the pain the ram usually stands. The 
scrotum is swollen and tender and his appetite is poor. 

TREATMENT. — Suspend his testicles in a bandage or net. Foment 
with hot water and apply equal parts of extract of witch hazel, alcohol and 
hot water ; or, dissolve one ounce of sugar of lead in a quart of water and ap- 
ply several times a day. Give epsom salts to open the bowels and feed cooling, 
laxative food. In some cases pus forms and when it does it should be allowed 
to escape and the scrotum should be washed out with peroxide of hydrogen 
and later with carbolic acid and water, one part acid and fifty of water. 

CASTRATING LAMBS. — Lambs should be castrated when they are 
five or six days old. The operation is exceedingly simple and it is best done 
by having an assistant hold the lamb. Cut. off quite a portion of the pouch. 
This 'is easily done with either a sharp knife or scissors. Then pull out the 



193 THE PEOPLE'S HOME STOCK BOOK. 

testicle, either altogether or well out, and cut off the cord. Then apply 
one part carbolic acid and fifty parts water or blow on equal parts of iodoform 
and boric acid. When operating always clean your knife or scissors and dip 
them into carbolic acid one part and water fifty parts. Be sure to clean your 
tools after each operation for fear of one sheep poisoning another. 

CASTRATING RAMS.— When castrating an old ram it is well to keep 
in mind that there is danger of his bleeding to death if the operation is not 
performed properly. Throw the animal down and roll him on his back and 
then tie his legs or have him held. Either cut off the end of the sack or make 
a bold incision into the scrotum to allow the testicle to escape; then cut the 
attachment with a knife, pull out the cord and cut it off with either an emas- 
culator or ecraseur, or it will perhaps bt more convenient to tie a silk or 
linen string around the cord, leaving the ends long and hanging out of the 
body so that the string will fall out of the body when the end of the cord sloughs 
off. Wash the wound with carbolic acid, one part, and water, fifty parts ; or, 
dust in iodoform and boric acid twice a day. The knife and hands of the 
operator should be kept clean and the knife should be put into carbolic acid 
and water before it is used. Always wash the knife before it is used on a 
second sheep for fear of infection. The wound should be dressed once of 
twice a day. 



VARIOUS DISEASES. 

(Including Foot-Rot, Grubs in the Head, Ticks, Scab, Sore Eyes, Swollen 
Feet, Docking, Maggots, Wool-Shedding, Hydrophobia, Lockjaw, Etc.) 



FOOT-ROT. — Foot-rot is a contagious disease caused by a micro- 
organism and is always made worse by standing in manure or filth or 
from wearing the hoofs too close or from running on soft boggy pastures and 
there are many other causes which may bring on simple foot-rot that may not 
be the contagious kind. 

SYMPTOMS. — In nearly all cases there is some lameness and in many 
cases severe lameness. The heat of the foot will tell you which is the sore 
one. It may be the result of injury and only foul in the foot, or it may be 
non-contagious. 

TRE.\TMENT. — In case there is only superficial rawness either be- 
tween the claws or on the back part of the heel, touch the sore with one 
part of sulphuric acid and four parts of water, then smear the sore with pine- 
tar, cover with oakum, and bandage. I have found sugar of lead and water 
very good. Use an ounce o sugar of lead to a quart of water and it should 
be applied daily. It is ofte necessary to trim oiif some of the horn to get 
at the sore parts. When y u are sure the case is one of contagious foot-rot 
stand the sheep in a saturated solution of bluestone (sulphate of copper) 
for ten or twelve minutes and thi§ mixture should be at blood heat. If 
there are any very raw sores touch them with crude carbolic acid, muriatic 
acid or nitrate of silver or with a red hot iron. The feet should be kept clean 
and the diseased sheep kept away from the well ones and well fed. If they do 
not eat well give vegetable tonics. 
PEOPLE'S HOME REMEDIES FOR FOOT-ROT.— 

1. Blue Vitriol; — Put four inches of water into a tank and add all the 
blue vitriol it will dissolve. Cut away all diseased parts of the foot and let 
each sheep stand in this solution for ten or fifteen minutes and then apply 
chloride of lime and fill the cleft with a piece of tow long enough to tie to 
the foot. The lime should be renewed daily until a cure is effected. The 
farmer sending this recipe lives at Windham, Ohio. He says : " Using 
this recipe once was worth over one hundred dollars to me. At an auction 
I bought' a flock of over fifty sheep for one dollar per head as they were so 
badly diseased with foot-rot that no one else would buy them. I took them 
home, used this treatment thoroughly and finally cured them and sold them for 
three dollars per head, which made me a profit of two dollars per head on over 
fifty sheep." 

It is only necessary to add that it is the farmer who knows the most about 
stock, their diseases and how to cure them that makes the most money. Nowa- 
days the farmer should be as wide awake and up-to-date as the business 
man if he expects to make the greatest success. 

2. Turpentine. — Clean the foot carefully and pour turpentine freely 
upon the affected parts. 

3. Arsenic. — Drive the sheep through a long trough containing one-half 
pound of arsenic to five gallons of water. 

^13 193 



394 THE PEOPLE'S HOME STOCK BOOK. 

4. Carbolic Acid and Corrosive Sublimate. — Construct a long trough 
and fill to the depth of three or four inches with water to which has been 
added an ounce of carbolic acid and two drams of corrosive sublimate to each 
quart pf water. Drive the sheep through this trough once a week until cured. 

GRUBS IN THE HEAD.— The grub in the head of sheep is the larva 
of a small gadfly (CEstrus Ovis) which deposits its live embryo on the 
margin of the nostrils. It passes up the nasal cavities into the sinuses and 
nests just below the eyes. It is during the hot months of July, August and 
September that these gadflies bother sheep most. These larvje remain 
in the sinuses all winter and come out in the spring and in three or four weeks 
turn into gadflies. During the summer when these flies are bothering 
sheep it is a good plan to allow the sheep to run on a plowed field in order 
that they can push their noses into the earth and prevent being infested. 

SYMPTOMS. — There is generally more or less irritation of the nose 
with some discharge and when there are many of the larvae they produce 
dizziness. 

TREATMENT. — Place your sheep in a warm building and this will 
induce the grubs to come out ; or, blow some Scotch snuflf into the nose twice 
a day; or, burning some red pepper will cause sneezing and dislodge some of 
them. By far the better treatment is a preventive one. During the gadfly 
season keep the sheep in a dark shaded stable in the daytime. Plow a few 
furrows to give the sheep loose earth to rub the nose in. Put tar on the 
nose and it is better to add some fish oil to it. It is well to keep in mind 
that grubs usually come out of the sinuses in the spring but if they do 
not the only successful treatment is to cut (trephine) through the bones of 
the face between the eye and the median line of the face or just in front of 
the horn if the animal has horns. The sinuses should then be washed out with 
weak salt water at about the temperature of the body and kept up until the 
grubs are dislodged. Sheep that have grubs in the head should be well fed 
and should be treated in due time. 
PEOPLE'S HOME REMEDIES FOR GRUBS IN THE HEAD.— 

1. Sulphur. — Burn sulphur near the sheep so that they will inhale the 
fumes. They should inhale enough to cause coughing but not enough to 
suffocate them. 

2. Kerosene. — Pour half a teaspoonful of kerosene oil into each nostril 
if the sheep are suffering with grubs in the head. 

3. Preventive. — To keep the gadfly away from the sheep put some pine- 
tar on their noses during the fly season. 

TICKS. — The sheep tick is an insect with which every farmer is familiar. 
The female drops one egg at a time, therefore ticks do not multiply very 
rapidly. When sheep are shorn, kill the ticks or they will get upon the lambs 
for protection and bother the flock for a whole year . 

TREATMENT. — The same remedies recommended for scab will kill 
ticks. One dipping is generally all that is required to kill them. 
PEOPLE'S HOME REMEDIES FOR TICKS.— 

1. Sulphur, Salt and Saltpeter. — With 5 pounds of salt mix 1 pound of 
sulphur and 1/4 pound of saltpeter. Keep this where the sheep can get it 
at all times and they will not be troubled with ticks or skin diseases. 

2. Sulphur, Salt and Wood Ashes.— Mix equal parts of sulphur, salt 
and wood ashes. Keep this mixture before the sheep all the time and it will 
keep them in good condition and prevent both ticks and fluke worms. 



SHEEP— VARIOUS DISEASES. 195 

PEOPLE'S HOME REMEDIES FOR LOUPING ILL.— 

1. Tobacco and Salt. — The louping ill is caused by ticks which may be 
lemoved by washing the sheep with a strong tea made from tobacco. Add 
some salt to this tobacco tea and it will be all the more effective. 

2. Turpentine. — Turpentine will destroy the ticks that cause this trouble. 

3. Creosote and Linseed Oil. — Wash the sheep with a solution of one 
part creosote to four parts linseed oil. 

INFLAMED EYES— OPHTHALMIA.— Sheep are very often troubled 
with sore eyes. Bathe the eyes with hot or cold water three times a day for 
thirty minutes at a time and apply a saturated solution of boric acid. This 
is prepared by dissolving all the boric acid the water will take up and this 
should be applied after using the water. Another very good eye wash is 
made by dissolving 4 grains of nitrate of silver and one grain of atropia in 
one ounce of rain water. I have also obtained good results by blowing some 
calomel into the eyes occasionally, when milder remedies had failed. 

SCAB. — Scab is a skin disease very similar to mange in horses and itch 
in man. 

CAUSES. — It is produced by a very small insect which irritates the skin 
and soon burrows beneath the cuticle, producing some discharge that dries 
and forms a sort of crust to protect these parasites and this causes the 
wool to slough off. These scab germs multiply quite rapidly, producing 
great irritation and emaciation and frequently death. 

SYMPTOMS. — The symptoms are uneasiness and trying to bite or rub 
the shoulder or parts most affected, showing that there must be intense 
itching. If you will examine the skin you will see that there is a watery 
exudation but you will fail to see the scab insects unless you use a micro- 
scope or powerful magnifying glass. You will soon notice several of your 
sheep scratching, for scab is highly infectious and soon goes through a 
flock. The wool usually drops off in bunches leaving a bare patch. 

TREATMENT. — In order to cure scab you must dip the sheep and 
it should be done thoroughly. Nearly all the coal-tar disinfectants on the 
market will cure scab, but I believe they should not be diluted as much as 
their directions state. In most cases make the solution one-third to one- 
half stronger than prescribed and you will lessen your work and cure the 
scab more quickly. A very effectual dip is prepared by making a decoction 
of tobacco, twelve pounds leaf tobacco and eight pounds sulphur in fifty or 
sixty gallons of hot water. Dip the sheep in this when it is a little warmer 
than body heat, leaving the sheep in the dip not less than four or five minutes. 
The United States Government issued a bulletin telling how to make the 
lime and sulphur dip for scab in sheep and you would "make no mistake in 
sending for this bulletin. If you use the lime and sulphur dip, do not leave 
the sheep in the dip more than two minutes at a time. It is a good plan to 
dip your sheep every ten days or two weeks for four or five weeks. When 
sheep are dipped for scab the ticks are killed. Galvanized iron or concrete 
dipping vats are the best. 

PEOPLE'S HOME REMEDIES FOR SCAB.— 

1. Lard, Oil of Tar and Sulphur. — Gradually mix % pound of oil of tar 
with 1 pound of sulphur and then add 2 pounds of lard and rub together to 
form an ointment. This ointment is an effective remedy for scab in sheep. 

2. Tobacco. — Wash the sheep thoroughly with strong tobacco tea. 



196 THE PEOPLE'S HoME STOCK BOOK. 

3. Wood Soot and Turpentine. — Mix a little turpentine and wood soot 
and add to their grain when feeding if the sheep have the scab. 
SWOLLEN FEET.— 

CAUSES. — When a sheep has a swollen foot it is generally the result of 
an injury of some kind, and by close inspection you can tell what is wrong. 
Very often the biplex canal in the front and upper part of the foot becomes 
inflamed and red, causing the coronet and pastern to swell. When this occurs 
the toes are usually apart and the foot is quite tender. Examine the foot 
foi foreign bodies and treat as if it were a case of simple foul. Sometimes 
a few applications of tincture of iodine will efifect a cure. The coal-tar dis- 
intectants, when applied full strength, act very well. 
PEOPLE'S HOME REMEDIES FOR FOUNDER.— 

1. Castor Oil and Soapsuds. — Give the sheep two tablespoonfuls of 
warm castor oil and inject the bowels with warm soapsuds. This treatment 
may be repeated in two hours if necessary. 

2. Raw Linseed Oil and Soapsuds. — Inject the bowels with warm soap- 
suds and give two tablespoonfuls of raw linseed oil. Repeat in an hour and 
a half or two hours if not relieved. 

FRACTURES OR BROKEN BONES.— When sheep fracture the limbs, 
the bones should be put back into place and a Paris plaster bandage applied 
and the sheep kept fairly quiet. You can purchase plaster bandages already 
prepared for use and there is no reason why farmers cannot apply them. 
Fractures of young sheep heal rapidly and a bony union generally takes plaice 
if the bones are held in position. Treat fractures in sheep the same as in 
other animals. 

DOCKING. — Docking in lambs should be done when they are only a 
few days old unless they are' to be marketed before they are three months 
old. The tail can be cut off easily with one stroke of a knife or with docking 
pinphers or with a mallet and chisel. In order that the flesh may drop over 
the end of the tail after it is cut oflf, draw the skin and flesh well forward 
towards the body, then cut it oflf and the flesh will drop over the end of the 
tail and make a better looking tail ; besides, the lamb suflfers less when the 
operation is performed in this way. When the old lambs are docked it is 
necessary to cord tail them to stop bleeding, leaving the string on for 24 
hours. It is also good practice to apply one part coal-tar disinfectant and 
four parts of vaseline to the end of the tail. When the operation is per- 
formed, if the tail bleeds too much burn the end with a red hot iron or apply 
some of Monsel's solution or apply either hot or cold water. 

MAGGOTS IN WOUNDS.— Maggots are very likely to get into wounds 
in sheep if the sores are neglected and not kept clean and properly treated. 
Blow-flies are the cause. 

TREATMENT. — First of all, clean the wound and apply one part of car- 
bolic acid and thirty parts of water, or apply tincture of myrrh ; or, drop four 
ounces of sugar of lead, three ounces of sulphate of zinc, and two ounces of 
carbolic acid into three quarts of water and apply twice a day. Another very 
good plan is to clip oflf all the wool tags which hold dirt and filth and apply 
diluted carbolic acid, adding a little turpentine, camphor and asafcetida, or 
apply diluted kerosene. 
WOOL-SHEDDING.— 

CAUSES.— Keeping sheep too warm and feeding them too much stim- 
ulating food will cause them to shed some wool. 



SHEEP— VARIOUS DISEASES. 197 

SYMPTOMS. — Whenever the wool commences to drop off there is a 
reason and generally a good one. Reduce their grain allowance, keep them 
in a cooler place and salt them well, and the wool will soon stop dropping off. 
Give five drops of Fowler's solution of arsenic and thirty drops of fluid ex- 
tract of sarsaparilla at a dose in feed twice a day, or give 1/4 teaspoonful baking 
soda at a dose twice a day. It is also a good plan to feed some vegetables and 
in some cases give fifteen grains of sulphur at a dose in feed twice a day, or 
give some saltpeter. 

HYDROPHOBIA— RABIES.— Hydrophobia, or rabies, is quite common 
in sheep for if bitten by a mad dog or other rabid animal they seem to be 
easily infected. As there is no remedy for this ailment all sheep bitten should 
be destroyed for fear of their doing damage. The preventive is altogether too 
expensive to apply to sheep but it should be given to man if he has been bitten 
by any animal that has rabies. 
TETANUS— LOCKJAW.— 

CAUSES. — It must be understood that tetanus is caused by a germ which 
makes its way into the circulation or blood of an animal or person. The most 
common abode for this bacillus is in rich fertile garden soil or filth ; therefore, 
in treating wounds on animals they should be protected so as to make it im- 
possible for these germs to enter the body. 

SYMPTOMS. — There is great stiffness, locking of the jaws, hardening of 
the muscles and quick breathing. The sheep is unable to walk and generally 
dies in a day or two. 

TREATMENT. — The best drugs to give partial relief are belladonna or 
henbane (hyoscyamus) but it is well to keep in mind that we have no certain 
remedy for tetanus, but we can prevent it by immunizing the animal for a 
few weeks when he suffers from a wound low down on the body. 



HOGS. 

DISEASES OF THE DIGESTIVE ORGANS. 

(Including Indigestion, Diarrhea, Constipation, Worms, Fits in Pigs, 
Rupture, Liver Disease, Black Teeth, Hog Cholera, Etc.) 



THE STOMACH OF THE PIG.^The stomach of the pig is simple, yet 
it performs the functions of both carnivorous and ruminating animals. The 
saliva of the pig is quite active, continuing after it reaches the stomach to assist 
in digesting starchy food. Therefore, the pig fattens on cereals more rapidly 
than other animals but it takes him longer to digest meat than it does the 
carnivora and, as he does not masticate vegetables as well as herbiverous and 
ruminating animals, he does not extract the same nutriment from them that 
they do. The intestines of a hog are not nearly so sensitive as those of the 
horse ; therefore, they are less likely to become diseased. The stomach of the 
hog possesses wonderful digestive powers. 

INFLAMMATION OF THE STOMACH— GASTRITIS.— In all mild 
cases the mucous membrane of the stomach is inflamed but in severe cases the 
muscular parts are involved. This is not a very common ailment in hogs 
on account of their stomachs not being easily inflamed. 

CAUSES. — Gastritis is generally the result of giving caustic or irritating 
drugs and is often associated with other ailments. 

SYMPTOMS. — There is generally some vomiting, more or less pain and 
uneasiness, and some thirst. The end of the nose is dry, as is also the skin ; 
the urine is of a brown color; the tongue is covered with a fur and the pig 
sometimes coughs. In some cases of gastritis the hog lives only a few hours, 
that is, if he has been poisoned with drugs. 

-TREATMENT. — Give carbonate of soda if he h^s been given acid and 
give vinegar to counteract the effect of an alkali; or, give milk if you have 
nothing else, adding 25 or 30 drops of tincture of opium. Let him have plenty 
of cold water and if he is weak give him some black coflfee and whiskey. If 
you believe he is full of indigestible food give two ounces of castor oil to clean 
him out. If there is very much vomiting, give^ 30 drops of the medicinal solu- 
tion of prussic acid, or a few drops of wine of ipecac, or some strong black 
coffee. After the acute symptoms pass oflf give plenty of milk and water with 
some oatmeal added. 
INDIGESTION.— 

CAUSES. — The pig very often suffers from attacks of indigestion for 
want of exercise, because of being fed too long on one kind of food or because 
of eating decomposed meat or food of poor quality. 

SYMPTOMS. — There is either partial or complete loss of appetite in 
most cases ; however, I have known them to crave filthy food that they would 
not care for when well. This shows it to be a sort of acidity of the stomach 
and the hog was hunting to find a remedy. The bowels are either costive or 
too loose. In some cases the pig coughs and in young pigs they often have 

198 



HOGS— DISEASES OF DIGESTIVE ORGANS. 199 

fits. In most cases they have some fever and the urine is scanty and of a 
brown" color. 

TREATMENT. — In most cases it is good practice to give a cathartic, es- 
pecially if the hog is constipated. If the bowels are loose, give castor oil or 
raw linseed oil and if costive, giv'e epsom salts. The dose of salts is from one 
to two ounces and castor oil is given in the same quantity; however, in all 
cases you must use your own good judgment as to the dose. "Tincture of 
rhubarb and tincture of opium and ginger act well in cases of too much bowel 
action. If the pig is troubled with vomiting give him one-half teacupful of 
strong black coffee, or two or three drops of wine of ipecac, or twelve drops 
of nitro-muriatic acid in a little water or give five drops of creosote or carbolic 
acid in cold water. Ginger, peppermint and baking soda are all remedies which 
assist in correcting stomach disorders. Powdered wood charcoal is another 
simple home remedy that always helps hogs with indigestion. 

ACUTE INDIGESTION.— Acute indigestion follows fast eating of food 
to which the animal is unaccustomed; eating too much at a time; or from a 
fermentation of what the animal has eaten, causing bloating and great distress. 

TREATMENT. — Give a teaspoonful of hypo-sulphite of soda every hour 
until the bloat goes down, or give a tablespoonful of aromatic spirits of am- 
monia every hour. Do not give baking soda for bloat as this is a mistake that 
is often made by stock raisers. After the acute attack passes ofif give a table- 
spoonful of powdered charcoal and a teaspoonful of ginger at a dose in feed 
two or three times a day. 

CHRONIC INDIGESTION— STUNTED.— Changing young pigs from 
their mothers' milk to grain stunts a great many of them ; also, when grain is 
taken away from pigs and an insufficient quantity of nutritious food is furn- 
ished them they may become stunted. It can be safely stated that nearly all 
pigs are wormy ; some of them have far too many worms and when you see a 
pig eating plenty of rich nourishing food and not growing but seemingly 
getting thinner you can safely suspect him of having lots of worms. 

TREATMENT. — If you believe he is wormy, treat for worms; if he is 
sick, try to diagnose his ailment and treat for it ; however, it is generally well 
to give him a dose of castor oil and a teaspoonful of the following compound 
condition powder for hogs. Take equal parts by weight of ground gentian 
root, ground ginger, baking soda and powdered charcoal, and in some cases 
add powdered copperas. Aldose should be given in feed three times a day, also 
salt them well. It is needless to speak of the importance of feeding a good 
quality of food until' they commence to grow. 

MORBID APPETITE. — Hogs that eat enormous quantities of food or 
that eat rubbish unfit for any animal to eat are in an abnormal condition and 
seldom lay on flesh. In many cases it is due to acidity of the stomach. 

TREATMENT. — In all such cases the stomach should be rested and the 
hog put on an easily digested diet. Mix equal parts by weight of powdered 
sulphate of iron, ground gentian, ginger, baking soda and charcoal, and give 
the hog a teaspoonful at a dose in feed two or three times a day. In many 
cases it is good practice to give a cathartic of either epsom salts or castor 
oil to open the bowels. ^ ^ ... 

ENTERITIS— INFLAMMATION OF THE BOWELS.— Enteritis is 
an inflammation of the bowels ; however, in most cases only a portion of the 
bowels are inflamed. This is quite a fatal ailment in pigs. 

CAUSES.— It is often the result of constipation, colds, injuries, eating 



200 THE PEOPLE'S HOME STOCK BOOK. 

irritating substances and drinking impure water and it may result from other 
diseases. 

SYMPTOMS. — There is loss of appetite, thirst, fever, pain, dryness of the 
mouth, looseness of the bowels with some blood, sometimes vomiting, and al- 
ways some weakness. 

TREATMENT. — When the bowels are too loose give twenty or thirty 
drops of tincture of opium and when they are costive give epsom salts. Very 
often it helps to give four tablespoonfuls of castor oil to clear out the stomach 
and bowels. In some cases small doseS' of calomel help to effect a cure. 
Apply mustard and water to the abdomen every day and, if it is possible, keep 
the hog or pig on liquid food for a few days. 

COLIC. — Colic in hogs is not a very common ailment and when it does 
occur it is generally the result of changing from a digestible diet to one that is 
less so, thereby causing fermentation, and it also follows exposure. 

SYMPTOMS. — Sitting on haunches, shifting position, moving head from 
side to side, sometimes bloating, grunting, and squealing are symptoms. 

TREATMENT. — Any home colic remedy acts well on the hog. Give 
laudanum in twenty-drop doses. Essence of peppermint, ginger, whiskey, 
aromatic spirits of ammonia or some camphorated tincture of opium will help 
to give relief. 

VOMITING. — ^Vomiting is the act of ejecting food or material from the 
stomach, accomplished by contraction of the stomach with perhaps some con- 
traction of the diaphragm and abdominal muscles. 

CAUSES. — It is generally the result of an irritation or inflammation of 
the stomach ; however, it may also be the result of some nervous disorder. 

TREATMENT. — Without knowing the cause it is not an easy matter to 
tell what to give; however, try coffee, aromatic spirits of ammonia, pepper- 
mint, laudanum, ginger, wine of ipecac, a few drops of creosote or carbolic 
acid in water, or soda or a few drops of chloroform. 

BLEEDING FROM THE STOMACH.— Bleeding from the stomach is 
generally attended with vomiting of blood but is not very common in the pig. 

CAUSES. — It is most likely the result of injuries. It may be caused 
by swallowing a bone with a sharp end and thus wounding the stomach. 

SYMPTOMS. — There is loss of appetite and vomiting or passing of blood. 
Examine the blood and if dark colored and mixed with some food it comes 
from the stomach, while if it is from the lungs it will be of a brighter red color. 

TREATMENT. — Drop a grain or two of sugar of lead and ten drops of 
laudanum into a teaspoonful of cold water and give this quantity at a dose 
every two or three hours ; or give a teaspoonful of fluid extract of ergot ; or 
give ten or fifteen drops of Monsell's solution in water every two or three 
hours. 
DIARRHEA.— 

CAUSES. — Diarrhea is caused by eating food that ferments, eating irri- 
tating things, too much action of the liver, effete material in the blood, or too 
much exercise on a hot day. In fact, when the stomach is full, any cause 
which will produce excessive bowel action may cause diarrhea. Weakness of 
the bowels may be the cause and young pigs very often scour on account of 
their mothers eating certain kinds of food. Diarrhea is not really a disease 
but a result of other ailments. 

SYMPTOMS. — In simple cases the bowels act too freely and the excre- 
ment is liquid but there is no disease. When there is much pain or loss of 



HOGS— DISEASES OF DIGESTIVE ORGANS. 301 

appetite or when the liver is much affected the passages will be of a yellow 
color and when there is vomiting and straining it is very often due to too 
much acid. 

TREATMENT.— If you can tell what caused this bowel trouble and re-, 
move it they soon get well. Give a small dose of castor oil or sweet oil to 
clean out the stomach and bowels and follow this with fifteen or twenty drops 
of spirits of camphor and twenty or twenty-five drops of laudanum and repeat 
these doses every two or three hours until the excessive bowel movements are 
checked. When the purging has been going on for some time it is not neces- 
sary to give oil. I have given a grain of powdered opidm and four grains of 
sugar of lead every three hours and found that it acted well. All home reme- 
dies that are given in human practice for diarrhea can be given to hogs with 
equally good results. 
PEOPLE'S HOME REMEDIES FOR SCOURS IN PIGS.— 

1. Copperas. — Give the sow % teaspoonful of copperas in a little swill. 
Do not feed her much slop until after the pigs are weaned. 

2. Air-Slaked Lime. — Give the pig a tablespoonful of air-slaked lime .v\ro 
or three times a week in the slop. 

DYSENTERY. — Dysentery is an inflammation of the mucous membrane 
of the bowels with frequent bowel movements and with some blood in the 
excrement and some scales of mucus. There is also some i)owel pain. 

CAUSES. — It often follows eating putrid, rotten meat or decayed vege- 
tables and lying in cold damp places. Worms, a torpid liver, and constipation 
also cause it. 

SYMPTOMS. — There is some uneasiness, dullness, loss of appetite, and 
some pain, and there are passages of dry excrement at first, then the move- 
ments are thin and tinged with either mucus or blood. There is always some 
fever and some bloating and the longer the disease lasts the stronger will be 
the smell of the excrement. 

TREATMENT. — Give a good large dose of castor oil to clean out the 
stomach and bowels ; also give calomel and a few grains of powdered opium, 
or 25 drops of laudanum. A teaspoonful of ginger, three grains of quinine, 
or one ounce of whiskey in the last part of their sickness does them good. 
Give three times a day. 

CONSTIPATION. — The bowels of hogs should move about so often 
and if they do not we say they are constipated. Constipation soon causes 
the bowels to become somewhat impaired and unfit to perform their normal . 
work. 

CAUSES. — An accumulation of hard excrement or other substance in 
the bowels is often brought on by over-feeding and under exercising of hogs 
and if not relieved produces irritation and inflammation. 

TREATMENT. — Give castor oil in two-ounce doses every twelve hours 
until relief is obtained; or give epsom salts with some senna added; or give 
any of the reliable compound cathartic pills which are used by man and they 
will give good results. If the pig is weak give tonics and stimulants. Give 
food of a laxative nature for a few days after an attack of constipation and be 
sure to exercise the hog. 
PEOPLE'S HOME REMEDIES FOR CONSTIPATION.— 

1. Salt and Wood-Ashes. — Feed plenty of salt and wood ashes and the 
hogs will not be troubled with constipation. 



202 THE PEOPLE'S HOME STOCK BOOK. 

2. Epsom Salts. — Give four ounces of epsom salts if the hogs are con- 
stipated. Also give an injection. 
PEOPLE'S HOME REMEDIES FOR LAMENESS,— 

1. Sulphur and Epsom Salts. — To a very large hog give two teaspoon- 
fuls each of sulphur and epsom salts in the feed three times a day until the 
bowels are thoroughly opened. 

2. Salt and Ashes. — Keep salt and wood ashes before the hogs all the 
time and they will be troubled with neither lameness nor constipation. 

OBSTRUCTION OF THE BOWELS.— By obstruction of the bowels 
is meant their blocking with some impediment, preventing the free passage 
of feces. 

CAUSES. — The hog very often eats food of an indigestible nature and 
frequently picks up coal and cinders. Besides, concretions seem to form 'in 
the bowels and tumors grow and obstruct the passage of excrement. 

SYMPTOMS. — The attack may come on suddenly, creating severe pain 
and uneasiness. There is some vomiting and bloating, followed by inflamma- 
tion of the bowels and death. 

TREATMENT. — Give two ounces of castor oil or three ounces of raw 
linseed oil or epsom salts and some senna. If the oil fails to act add three 
drops of croton oil; however, it should be remembered that croton oil is a 
drug that will kill if too much is given. Give injections of soap and warm 
water with some sweet oil added. If vomiting is severe give black coffee or 
two or three drops of wine of ipecac or any simple home remedy that will 
warm up the stomach. The custom of feeding coal and coal cinders to hogs 
is altogether too common. 

INTERNAL PARASITES— WORMS.— Nearly all young pigs have a 
few worms and I might safely say the same regarding old hogs. This is the 
result of our methods of feeding pigs. Much of the food is fed without 
being cooked and the meat which they very often eat is full of ova which 
soon grow and develop into worms after the hog has eaten them. 

CAUSES. — The habits of hogs render them more liable to worms than are 
many other animals. The ova when taken into the stomach and bowels, meet- 
ing moisture and heat, seem to grow and as the hog eats all kinds of raw 
vegetables and meat it is no wonder he is wormy; besides, he sometimes has 
indigestion and this favors their growth. 

SYMPTOMS. — On account of the worms' movements in the stomach 
and bowels they seem to produce some irritation, bringing on a certain amount 
of pain and uneasiness. There is itching of the anus and nose, also rubbing 
of the tail and rooting with the nose. The bowels are either costive or too 
loose and sometimes a little blood can be seen in the excrement and sometimes 
shreds of mucus may be seen and if the microscope is used you will see the 
small worms or their eggs. Worms derange the nervous system, causing ver- 
tigo, chorea, coughing, fits, fever, loss of flesh and skin diseases. 

TREATMENT. — When treating pigs for worms the stomach and bowels 
should not be too full. Fairly good results follow giving some charcoal 
and hard wood ashes or sulphate of iron in the feed. Others give one-half 
teaspoonful of turpentine in three or four tablespoonfuls of raw linseed oil 
and still others give fluid extract of spigelia and senna in tablespoonful doses 
every four or five hours until the pig purges, then discontinue its use. Some 
give twenty grains of powdered cedar apple. Areca nut is sometimes given ; 



HOGS— DISEASES OF DIGESTIVE ORGANS. 303 

also powdered kamala and pumpkin seeds are beneficial. I am told that hogs 
which eat pumpkins and carrots are seldom bothered with worms. 
PEOPLE'S HOME REMEDIES FOR WORMS.— 

1. Turpentine. — Every third day, until four doses have been taken, give 
a teaspoonful of turpentine in milk in the morning before feeding. ' 

3. Gentian and Iron. — Give a dram each of ground gentian and sulphate 
of iron in the feed once a day. 

3. Santonine. — Give five or ten-grain doses of santonine. 
FITS IN YOUNG PIGS.— 

CAUSES. — It is safe to say that fits in young pigs are often the result of 
worms, or of over-feeding and want of exercise. 

SYMPTOMS.— The first*symptom is an unthrifty condition; The legs 
tremble and shake and the head and neck bend. The pig soon becomes rigid 
and falls over and struggles some, then remains quiet for a few moments and 
then gets up and acts as though perfectly well, only to have another sick spell 
sometime later. Pigs two or three months old should be given twenty grains 
of powdered kamala and a dessert spoonful of castor oil. Or, give twenty 
drops of turpentine in two ounces of raw linseed oil and it may be necessary to 
give more than one dose but not sooner than 24 hours. Young pigs should 
b^ given some gentian, ginger and copperas in their feed twice a day. 
PEOPLE'S HOME REMEDIES FOR KIDNEY-WORMS IN HOGS.— 

1. Lye and Turpentine. — Rub the back with turpentine and two or three 
times a day give in slop one or two tablespoonfuls of weak lye made from 
wood ashes. 
PEOPLE'S HOME REMEDIES FOR WEAK BACK.— 

1. Turpentine. — Rub turpentine on the back. One application is usually 
sufficient. 

PERITONITIS (INFLAMMATION OF THE PERITONEUM).— 
Peritonitis is an inflammation of the membrane that lines the abdominal cav- 
ity and which is reflected over the intestines. 

CAUSES. — It sometimes follows castration, chills, kicks from horses, 
hooks from cattle, bunts from rams and punctures through the abdomen. 
Sometimes it follows farrowing and the penetration of foreign bodies into the 
bowels. It may result from other diseases such as swine plague and cholera. 

SYMPTOMS. — The hog has chills, pain, tender abdomen, bloating, vomit- 
ing, quick pulse, fever and short breathing and if the pain increases death usu- 
ally follows but if the pain subsides it is a favorable indication of recovery. 

TREATMENT. — Give either castor oil or sulphate of magnesia but never 
give aloes. A dose or two of calomel will do good. Give opium to allay the 
pain ; also give eggs and milk to support their strength. When there is much 
weakness give aromatic spirits of ammonia and whiskey. 

UMBILICAL HERNIA. — What is usually understood by hernia is a 
projection of the bowels through an opening, either natural or artificial, or a 
rupture of the walls of any organ. Hernia is classified according to its posi- 
tion, but the kind most common to the pig is either umbilical (navel) or scrotal. 
It is very common to find the omentum or intestine protruding through the 
umbilicus, caused by a failure of the navel to close early. 

SYMPTOMS. — There is a soft puflfy bunch at the navel, which, if pressed, 
will return through the opening and pass back into the body. This rupture, if 
small, seldom causes the pig any trouble unless it becomes strangulated and 
if it does not it is seldom necessary to do anything for it. 



204 THE PEOPLE'S HOME STOCK BOOK. 

TREATMENT. — A simple and quite successful way to operate is to roll 
the pig on his back, press the omentum and bowel back into place, pick up the 
loose skin, put a skewer through the sack or pouch of hide close to- the ab- 
domen and then 'another one at right angles; then tie a string close to the 
body back of these pins. This chokes the circulation, the opening in the ab- 
domen fills with serum and the parts swell and close and soon unite. In a 
week or ten days the pouch of skin sloughs ofif and your pig is well. I have 
operated on hundreds and seldom had a failure unless the bunch was very 
large. Be sure to dip the pins into carbolic acid and water and do not tie 
the cord too tight. 

SCROTAL HERNIA. — Scrotal hernia is where the bowel has passed 
through the canal into the scrotum, or pouch. 

SYMPTOMS. — The scrotum is too large and when pressed feels soft and 
dough-like. 

TREATMENT.— Roll the pig on his back ; return the intestine ; pull up 
the scrotum and testicles as far as you can ; then apply a wooden clamp 
(without paustic). Let it remain on until the parts slough off, then apply 
equal parts of iodoform and boric acid or one part of carbolic acid and thirty 
parts of water twice daily. 

STRICTURE OF THE RECTUM— Stricture of the rectum should be 
suspected whenever a pig is found straining and is unable to empty the bowel 
and if an examination is made the cause will generally be found. The bowel 
wall may be thickened or falling of the bowel may have taken place or there 
may be a tumor or stricture. 

TREATMENT.— The first step should be to wash out the bowel with 
soap and warm water and then apply one part of solid extract of belladonna 
and six parts of vaseline, or one part of fluid extract of belladonna and twenty 
parts of water, and inject two ounces into the bowel daily. Plenty of vaseline 
or fresh lard applied to the inside of the bowel gives good results. 

HEMORRHOIDS OR PILES.— Hemorrhoids are soft tumors that bleed 
easily and are found in or near the anus. When they do not bleed they are 
called blind piles and of course are either visible or invisible. The soft 
bunches are often varicose veins forming a sort of tumor; the others contain 
coagulated blood and in either case they annoy the animal. 

TREATMENT. — Always give the pig a cathartic of aloes, calomel and 
ginger or give castor oil, or epsom salts and senna. Fill the rectum full of 
cold water, adding a little tannic acid to the water. It is sometimes necessary 
to open these tumors and squeeze out the blood. When this is done open with 
a narrow knife in several places and apply sugar of lead and' water several times 
a day. Sometimes hot applications act well. 
PROLAPSUS ANI— FALLING OF THE BOWEL.— 

CAUSES. — Prolapsus ani is generally the result of a weakness of the 
muscles of the bowels but is sometimes the result of constipation and strain- 
ing. It also follows excessive bowel action such as people have in diarrhea 
and dysentery when there is a smarting of the bowels every time they move. 
The longer the bowel protrudes the more difficult it is to effect a cure. 

TREATMENT. — Give twenty drops of laudanum every few hours to 
stop the straining. Foment the swelling with hot water an hour at a time ; or 
put one dram of sulphate of zinc, two drams of acetate of lead and two ounces 
of tincture of opium into twenty ounces of cold water and apply to the swell- 
ing every hour until the swelling reduces ; then return the bowel to its place 



HOGS— DISEASES OF DIGESTIVE ORGANS. 205 

and put the hog in a narrow stall with the head three or four inches lower 
than the hind quarters for a day or two. By keeping him in this position the 
bowel will not need stitching but will fall back into its normal position. In- 
jections of soap and warm water should be given and the bowels kept open. 
If you fail to return the bowel have it cut off and sewed to the margin of the 
anus and if done properly it will unite. 

LIVER DISEASE. — The casual observer is seldom capable of diagnos- 
ing correctly a case of liver disease. Inflammation of the liver is brought 
on by feeding too much rich, nutritious food and allowing the animal to have 
no exercise. It is most common in hot weather. 

SYMPTOMS. — There is dullness, constipation, some cough and yellow 
mucous membranes. 

TREATMENT. — This ailment should have prompt, energetic treatment 
for if not it, may bring on other ailments. Purge the pig with epsom salts and 
give small doses of calomel to act on the liver and bowels. Sometimes castor 
oil acts well and if the pig is in much pain give calomel and opium several 
times daily. 

JAUNDICE — YELLOWS. — ^Jaundice is not a common disease of the 
pig. It is known by the yellow appearance of the pig which is the result of 
absorption of bile. 

SYMPTOMS. — There is loss of appetite, dullness, vomiting and deranged 
digestion. The excrement is of a clay color and the bowels are costive. 

TREATMENT. — Give either castor oil or sulphate of magnesia; also give 
small doses of calomel, podophyllin, phosphate of soda and hot water ; or give 
twelve drops of nitro-muriatic acid two or three times a day. 

SPORADIC APHTHA — GLOSS ANTHRAX — GUM MOUTH.— 
Sporadic Aphtha is a vesicular eruption of the tongue, cheeks and lips. It is 
very often called gloss anthrax or gum mouth. 

SYMPTOMS. — There is loss of appetite and some fever and there are 
pustules on the tongue and lips. 

TREATMENT. — Give three grains of quinine, forty drops of gentian and 
one-half ounce of whiskey at a dose five times a day. Use alum and water, one 
ounce of alum to one quart of water, and apply to the mouth three times a 
day. When the mouth is only slightly inflamed apply borax and water, an 
ounce of borax to a quart of water. Wash the mouth with this three times a 
day. Feed gruel made of meal and milk or give eggs, milk and whiskey if the 
pig is weak. Also be sure to keep the hog in a clean dry place. 

BLACK TEETH. — Black teeth is supposed by many hog raisers to be a 
disease; however, the veterinary profession is pretty thoroughly agreed that 
they are mistaken and the author shares this same belief, for he has not yet 
been able to connect it with any sickness. It seems to be natural for some 
pigs to have black teeth and many of them never have a sick day ; besides, at 
our large slaughter houses many of the finest hogs killed have black teeth 
and they never harmed the hog. My advise to swine breeders is to leave them 
alone unless they are decayed and if so, pull them out with a pair of forceps 
or nippers. 

CHOKING. — Sometimes hogs choke when attempting to swallow too 
large a piece of vegetable or other hard substance. 



206 THE PEOPLE'S HOME STOCK BOOK. 

TREATMENT. — When called upon to relieve choke in hogs give some 
raw linseed oil, melted lard or glycerine with ten or fifteen drops of fluid extract 
of belladonna added. If the obstruction does not go down, open the mouth 
with a gag and remove the obstruction with splint forceps or tongs made of 
wood or try to work the obstruction down. It may be necessary to use a 
probang. 

HOG CHOLERA AND SWINE PLAGUE.— The terms " hog cholera " 
and " swine plague " have come into general use among breeders and raisers 
of hogs and the supposition that these two diseases are entirely different is 
wrong for they are very similar both in cause and symptoms. Until recently 
we were led to suppose them to be two separate infectious diseases but to 
save time and confusion let us consider them as one disease for to distinguish 
the difference requires the services of an expert to examine the body after 
death. I 

CAUSES. — Hog cholera and swine plague are no doubt caused by a 
germ so small as not to be visible with the microscope and these germs pass 
readily through filters. Our old theories have been very much changed by the 
excellent work done in recent years by the government and different state 
experiment stations. It is well to know that infection is absolutely necessary 
to produce the disease and without it there can be no hog cholera or swine 
plague. Certain hogs may resist this infection better than others; however, it 
makes no difference how susceptible they may be they never take hog cholera 
without being subjected to this one specific cause. The hogs raised in certain 
localities under certain conditions seem to possess less power of resistance 
than others. " Show " hogs that have been pampered and their growth forced 
and also corn-fed hogs that are kept closely housed in damp, badly ventilated 
pens appear to be quite liable to cholera infection. 

Everyone who raises hogs should bear in mind that the living organisms 
under favorable conditions multiply rapidly and are carried from place to place 
in very small particles of filth. It is also well to keep in mind that there are 
scores of different ways whereby this affection may be carried from place to 
place. It may be carried by sick hogs, upon the legs and bodies of well ones 
that have been exposed, carried on wagons, in stock cars, upon the shoes and 
even clothing of people and it has been known to be carried down streams for 
miles. It can be safely stated that both the blood and manure of hogs suffering 
from cholera, and also the dead carcasses are highly infectious to other hogs. 

SYMPTOMS. — A single case of hog cholera never presents all the symp- 
toms of the disease for cases vary in virulence and some acute cases run their 
course rapidly, terminating in death in a day or two while other cases assume 
a chronic form, the sick hogs living for weeks. A hog infected with cholera 
becomes dull and dumpish, his hair is rough and the eyes inflamed and soon 
discharge. There is an effort to cough, the temperature rises to 105 or 106 
degrees and the hog hides away in a cool dark place. The appetite is poor 
and the bowels are either normal or costive at first but soon loosen, the dis- 
charges becoming watery and offensive. If the lungs are involved breathing 
is quickened, becoming more labored and especially in the later stages of th^ir 
sickness. The skin is generally congested and red on the inside of the legs 
and along the lower part of the abdomen, the color varying from pink to a sort 
of red or purple. The eruptions on the skin dry and form scales or scabs of 
different sizes. The hog stands with arched back, refuses, to eat, loses flesh 



HOGS— DISEASES OF DIGESTIVE ORGANS. SOt 

and strength rapidly, walks with a crippled and wabbling gait and gradually 
fails in strength until he dies. No person can tell for certain before death 
whether a hog suffers from hog cholera or swine plague but in the latter case 
the lungs are often more involved than in cholera and consequently the hog 
breathes with more difficulty. 

TREATMENT. — It is safer to say that hog cholera and swine plague can 
be prevented, rather than to say they can be cured; however, it is encourag- 
ing to know that well hogs can be immunized without danger so as to prevent 
their taking cholera. The credit of this recent discovery should go to the 
Bureau of Animal Industry, Washington, D. C. and perhaps a share to the 
different State Experiment Stations of this country. When a case of cholera, 
is discovered every possible effort should be made to destroy the infection 
and prevent the disease from spreading. One part carbolic acid and twenty 
parts water is as good as any disinfectant to use in spraying the pens and sprink- 
ling the ground where the hogs have been. Besides, the sick hogs should be 
kept by themselves and given good care, their pen sprinkled with air-slacked 
lime, the hogs kept away from mud and ponds and given some of the follow- 
ing tonic in their feed. Take two pounds of salt, two pounds of baking soda, 
one pound of Glauber's salts, two pounds of hypo-sulphite of soda and one 
pound of black antimony; mix thoroughly and give each full grown hog a 
tablespoonful at a dose in feed or as a drench once a day. It is important to 
give the hogs good care and also plenty of good food; also, keep them in a 
dry comfortable place and if they are sick during summer, find a shaded place 
for them. 

PREVENTING THE SPREADING OF HOG CHOLERA AND 
SWINE PLAGUE. — In a locality where hog cholera exists the owner of well 
hogs should do many things which he need not do if infected herds were not 
in his neighborhood. The owner of well hogs should keep away from stock 
yards and from all pens and farms where the disease exists. It is also im- 
portant to keep your neighbors away from your place if their hogs are dis- 
eased. Before allowing any person to come on your premises ask him some 
questions and you may learn that he has come from a farm where they have 
cholera and, if such is the case, keep him off your place. One man should 
have the care of diseased hogs and visitors should be kept from coming near 
them. Keep all diseased hogs in small fields by themselves. When any new 
hogs are bought and brought onto your farm, keep them away from your well 
ones for three or four weeks. It will pay well to disinfect and clean up after 
new healthy appearing hogs and it must be done thoroughly after sick hogs 
are gotten rid of. The troughs and floors should be scalded with hot water 
or steam or they should be wet with one part bichloride of mercury (corrosive 
sublimate) and one thousand parts water or use one part coal-tar disinfectant 
and thirty parts water. Brood sows that have had cholera produce pigs which 
resist the disease better than if the sow never had cholera and are said to 
live through an attack better. 

HOW TO PREVENT CHOLERA AND SWINE PLAGUE BY VAC- 
CINATION. — Blood serum taken from the body of an immunized hog and 
from one sick with cholera and injected into a well hog produces a mild 
attack of cholera from which most hogs recover and then they resist the in- 
fection. The serum from such hogs injected into the bodies of susceptible 
hogs seems to fortify them against infection for a time but if blood from a 



208 THE PEOPLE'S HOME STOCK BOOK. 

cholera hog is also used with it then it is likely to immunize the hog for life. 
The serum method should be used in treating hogs whenever there is an out- 
break of cholera in the neighborhood and it is well to immunize every hog 
as quickly as possible. I do not regard the new method of treating cholera 
by vaccinating to prevent its spread as likely to spread the disease if the 
work is done as it should be. Furthermore, if good serum is used few hogs 
will sicken badly from its use; however, too much virulent blood may be in- 
jected into a well hog and make him very sick« 



DISEASES OF THE RESPIRATORY OR 
BREATHING ORGANS. 

(Including Pneumonia, Congestion of the Lungs, Bronchitis, Pleurisy, Quinsy, 
Sore Throat, Coughs, Catarrh, Etc.) 



PNEUMONIA — INFLAMMATION OF THE LUNGS — LUNG 
FEVER. — Pneumonia is an inflammation of the lung substance. 

CAUSES. — The weather seems to have a great deal to do with animals 
taking pneumonia for it is much more prevalent during cold, wet, changeable 
weather than during hot summer weather. It follows other debilitating ail- 
ments and especially those of the air passag'es. 

SYMPTOMS. — There is first a chill and then fever, pain, uneasiness, hard 
breathing, a quick pulse and some coughing. The disease lasts from nine to 
fourteen days. 

TREATMENT. — Give a few drops of laudanum first to prevent vomiting, 
or you may give cofl^ee for this. Then give aconite to relieve the fever, or you 
can give veratrum viride. Good care in the line of food, fresh air and tonics 
seems to help most cases. Be sure the pen is clean and dry. 
PEOPLE'S HOME REMEDIES FOR PNEUMONIA.— 

1. Turpentine, Laudanum and Milk. — To half a cup of milk add a tea- 
spoonful of turpentine and 30 drops of laudanum. This is the dose for a 100- 
pound hog. In six or seven hours give another dose, but give just half the 
above quantities. 

CONGESTION OF THE LUNGS— APOPLEXY OF LUNGS— PUL- 
MONARY APOPLEXY. — Congestion of the lungs is a very common ail- 
ment in hogs and is what is generally called apoplexy of the lungs or pulmon- 
ary apoplexy. 

CAUSES. — There is too much blood stagnation about the lungs. A fat 
pig has but little breathing space and if exerted too much when in a weak, 
flabby condition he is likely to take congestion of the lungs. It also 
follows keeping pigs in badly ventilated and foul pens. 

SYMPTOMS. — There is great pain, the head is down, the mouth open, 
and there is some blood oozing from the nose in some cases. The extremities 
are cold, the pulse is weak and in fact the pig is unable to stand. 

TREATMENT. — If the pig is cold put him in a warm comfortable place 
and give stimulants such as whiskey, brandy, rum, aromatic spirits of ammonia 
or sweet spirits of nitre. Cover the body with woolen blankets and rub the 
legs with one pint of whiskey with a teaspoonful of tincture of capsicum 
added. In the early stages the ammonia or ether acts best and the alcoholic 
stimulants are best later on. Energetic treatment very often prevents its 
terminating in inflammation of the lungs. 

BRONCHITIS— INFLAMMATION OF THE BRONCHIAL TUBES. 
— Bronchitis, is not a common disease of the pig and when it does occur it is 
in pigs a few months old and then they do not always recover. 

CAUSES. — Exposure to cold and wet, too much dust or smoke, and cer- 
*ain conditions of the atmosphere seem to cause it to be epidemic. 

S— 14 209 



•210 THE PEOPLE'S HOME STOCK BOOK. 

SYMPTOMS. — A hoarse cough with difficult breathing, poking out the 
head, a discharge of mucus from the mouth, some fever and considerable weak- 
ness are the symptoms. 

TREATMENT. — If you notice the pig when first taken sick, give epsom 
salts, Glauber's salts or castor oil to open the bowels. To quiet the cough give 
morphine, opium, belladonna, muriate of ammonia or nitrate of potash three 
times a day. Also apply mustard and water to the breast daily. In the later 
stages of this disease give syrup of squills, muriate of ammonia and tincture 
of lobelia. If the pig is weak give eggs, milk and whiskey. 

PLEURISY— INFLAMMATION OF THE PLEURA.— Pleurisy is an 
inflammation of the membrane that lines the chest and covers the lungs. 
Strange to say, this membrane is frequently inflamed. I believe hogs very 
often have light attacks of pleurisy and recover without treatment and no 
one knows they ever had it. 

CAUSES. — Forcing pigs to sleep in cold wet beds is perhaps the most 
common cause. Standing in a draft or cold wind when warm, or an injury such 
as a kick are other causes. 

SYMPTOMS. — It sets in with a chill and pain in the side, some coughing, 
quick breathing, restlessness, fever, and arched back. When the chest con- 
tains fluid, breathing becomes more labored and quick but the pig suffers less 
pain. 

TREATMENT. — If the bowels are costive give one or two ounces of 
epsom salts in water as a drench ; also, give two drops of veratrum viride and 
ten drops of tincture of opium at a dose every three hours until the pig seems 
better and coughs less. If the kidneys do not act freely give fifteen grains 
of powdered saltpeter at a dose in either feed or water three times a day. 
When all the fever subsides, give as a tonic one teaspoonful of tincture of 
chloride of iron, the same quantity of fluid extract of gentian and one-half 
teaspoonful of fluid extract of cinchona at a dose in feed three times a day. Be 
sure to keep the pig in a dry clean place. 

QUINSY— INFLAMMATION OF THE TONSILS.— This is a very 
common ailment in swine and is frequently of a serious nature, terminating 
in death. 

SYMPTOMS. — There is great difficulty in swallowing and there is 
sweUing and soreness of the throat and the hog hangs the tongue out of the 
mouth. 

TREATMENT.— Apply hot water or hot cloths to the throat constantly 
for twenty-four hours ; also apply equal parts of extract of witch hazel, spirits 
of camphor and alcohol to the throat twice a day. Dissolve a teaspoonful of 
chlorate of potash in one-half pint of water, adding one teaspoonful of fluid 
extract of belladonna, and gargle the throat with two tablespoonfuls three or 
four times a day. 

LARYNGITIS— PHARYNGITIS— SORE THROAT.— This is a very 
common ailment in hogs, causing a cough, difficulty in eating and swallowing 
and generally affecting the breathing. 

CAUSES. — It is caused by exposure to storms in the cooler months of the 
year and wallowing in too cold water in hot weather. Also sudden changes 
in the temperature from hot to cold and keeping hogs in foul and badly ven- 
tilated pens will cause it. 

SYMPTOMS. — There is difficulty in swallowing dry feed, spasmodic 



HOGS— DISEASES OF RESPIRATORY ORGANS. 211 

coughing, a hot and dry skin, fast pulse, and a tendency to filling up of the 
throat. 

TREATMENT. — rlf the bowels are costive give castor oil; also give 
twelve grains of chloride of potash, three drops of tincture of belladonna and 
fifteen drops of tincture of opium at a dose three or four times a day. Or, 
give thirty drops of syrup of squills and ten drops of laudanum three times a 
day. I have used borax, alum and water with good results. 

CHRONIC LARYNGITIS.— The pig seldom suffers from chronic laryn- 
gitis. Although the throat membranes may be somewhat inflamed for a long 
time they do not change much, but the pig continues to cough. 

TREATMENT. — Apply equal parts of turpentine, aqua ammonia and 
raw linseed oil and give thirty drops of syrup of squills and fifteen drops of 
laudanum at a dose two or three times a day. 

COLDS. — Hogs suffer from colds, brought on by exposure to wet and 
storms and also from sleeping in damp basement pens. 

TREATMENT. — Feed warm slop and easily digested food and keep the 
hogs warm and dry. Mix equal parts of ginger and powdered licorice in their 
feed ; a tablespoonful is a dose for a full grown hog and this medicine should 
'be given three times a day until the hog recovers. 

SNUFFLES. — This is a common ailment in hogs, affecting them much 
the same as na^al catarrh, and unless they get well it may end in nasal gleet. 

TREATMENT. — Apply one part of peroxide of hydrogen and two parts 
of water to clear out the nose and give fifteen-grain doses of sulphate of iron 
in feed three times a day, or give three or four drops of Fowler's solution of 
arsenic at a dose in feed three times a day. In the treatment of snufHes feed 
as nearly as possible a balanced ration for hogs. If this disease results in 
nasal gleet (ozena) it will not pay to treat the hog and it is best to destroy 
him for fear of contagion ; besides, if the bony structures of the nose are dis- 
eased it is a difficult task to cure such a case. 

COUGHS. — Some pigs appear to suffer from a sort of nervous cough, 
others appear to cough while they are teething and without any inflammation 
of the mucous membranes; therefore, it must be some interference with the 
nerves of respiration. 

TREATMENT. — By giving the pigs tonics and good care they generally 
recover. Onions, garlic, or opium are good, and some give five-drop doses of 
nitro-hydrochloric acid at a dose three times a day. 
PEOPLE'S HOME REMEDIES FOR COUGHS.— 

1. Powdered Licorice. — To a two-hundred pound hog give two teaspoon- 
fuls of powdered licorice in the feed and repeat the dose in twenty-four hours 
if necessary. 

INFLAMMATION OF THE NOSTRILS— NASAL CATARRH.— In- 
flammation of the nostrils, or nasal catarrh, is a common ailment of hogs. 

CAUSES. — The most common cause is exposure to cold and wet. It is 
also caused by dust blowing up the nostrils and when nearly all the pigs are 
affected in your locality it is epizootic. 

SYMPTOMS. — Dryness of the membrane of the nose, some swelling, 
sneezing, a discharge from the nose with an increasing inflammation and loss 
of appetite, are the symptoms of nasal catarrh. 

TREATMENT. — It is not necessary to medicate all cases but give the pig 
good care and a few doses of ginger and nitrate of potash followed with a 
few two-grain doses of quinine two or three times a day. 



213 THE PEOPLE'S HOME STOCK BOOK. 

CHRONIC NASAL CATARRH— NASAL GLEET— OZENA.— When 

simple catarrh lasts long it is called chronic catarrh, nasal gleet, or ozena and 
the discharge becomes very thick and sticky, making breathing quite difficult. 

TREATMENT. — Give the pig three grains of powdered sulphate of 
copper, or three drops of Fowler's solution,, or ten grains of sulphate of 
iron, at a dose in feed three times a day ; pr give two grains of quinine at a 
dose four times a day. Fairly good results follow steaming with creosote or 
carbolic acid twice a day. Also, wash out the nostrils with salt and water, 
using a tablespoonful of salt in a quart of water and these applications should 
be made twice a day. 

MALIGNANT CATARRH.— When a hog suffers from a bad attack of 
malignant catarrh and has been given good care and the right kind of treat- 
ment it is often better to destroy him than to take chances of his infecting other 
pigs. 

SYMPTOMS. — There is a heavy discharge from the nostrils and eyes, the 
eyelids swell and the mucous membrane of the mouth and throat becomes 
inflamed. The pig has fever, loses flesh, and if the disease is not checked he 
dies. 

TREATMENT. — Give castor oil to open the bowels. Give four grains of 
quinine at a dose four times a day. If he coughs give 20 drops of laudanuns 
and steam the nostrils. 



DISEASES OF THE SKIN. 

(Including Prurigo, Surfeit, Mange, Scaly Disease, Lichen, Measles, Scarlet 
Fever, Ringworm, Erysipelas, Lice, Etc.) 



PRURIGO.— 

SYMPTOMS. — This is an eruption that causes great itching. It usually 
appears on the neck and shoulders and the pimples are almost of the same 
color as the skin, but by passing the hand over the skin it is found to be rough. 

TREATMENT.— It must be the result of faulty digestion ; therefore, it is 
always good practice to give an ounce or two of sulphate of magnesia to open 
the bowels promptly. Also give four drops of Fowler's solution and twenty 
drops of syrup of iodide of iron at a dose in feed or water three times a day. 
The coal-tar preparations mixed with four parts of vaseline help such cases. 
Dissolving baking soda in water and applying it to the sore parts two or three 
timesa day helps to take out the itching. This treatment will do for most skin 
eruptions of the hog. 
PEOPLE'S HOME REMEDIES FOR SORES BACK OF PIGS' EARS.— 

1. Kerosene and Sulphur. — Sometimes the pigs get sore back of the ears 
and have a discharge of a yellow matter with an offensive smell. Give the 
hog a teaspoonful of sulphur once a day and rub kerosene oil on the affected 
parts. 
PEOPLE'S HOME REMEDIES FOR " CANCER OF THE TAIL."— 

1. Preventive. — Feed the sows lightly for a couple of weeks after far- 
rowing. Equal parts of bran and shorts is a good feed. Also feed the sow 
a teaspoonful of sulphur three times a week. 

2. To Keep Tail from Falling Off. — Mix one part of carbolic aci.d with 
twenty parts of sweet oil and apply to the sore parts. 

SURFEIT— NETTLE RASH— URTICARIA.— This is a skin eruption 
that is never contagious but is very common in pigs. 

CAUSES. — It is generally brought on by feeding the pig on the same 
kind of food for too long a time, or by feeding him too much starchy food. It 
must be the result of deranged digestion. 

SYMPTOMS. — There is a sudden appearance of many elevations of the 
skin that seem to itch and if these pimple-like buds do not disappear soon the 
disease assumes a sort of chronic form and hard bunches form, continue to 
swell, soften, and discharge a glue-like fluid. In this second form of surfeit 
there may be loss of appetite and a sort of unthriftiness. 

TREATMENT. — Discontinue feeding nutritious food for a few days. 
Give a cathartic to clean out the bowels. The dose of epsom salts is from one 
to two and a half ounces and one dose is usually enough to move the bowels. 
Apply one part of bi-chloride of mercury and five hundred parts of water to 
the sore parts five or six times a day. This will take out soreness. Or, dis- 
solve one-fourth pound of sugar of lead in a gallon of water and add eight 
ounces of laudanum, if the itching is intense, and apply to surfeit buds four 
or five times a day. If the skin does not clean up in a few days give twenty 
drops of fluid extract of sarsaparilla and four drops of Fowler's solution at a 
dose in feed or water three times a day. 

213 



214 THE PEOPLE'S HOME STOCK BOOK. 

MANGE. — Mange is a parasitic ailment of the skin. It is readily com- 
municated from one pig to another and has been known to be given to man. 

SYMPTOMS. — There is severe itching on account of the parasite's bur- 
rowing under the outer skin. Because of this the pig is in misery. Scabs 
form and from rubbing there are some large sores on the body but these soon 
heal when the parasites are killed. 

TREATMENT. — Wash the pig with soap and water and if you have soft 
soap use it. Rub on flower sulphur and apply it daily; also, apply any of the 
coal-tar preparations that have a good reputation. A good remedy is staves- 
acre seeds, two ounces in boiled water ; or an infusion of tobacco applied twice 
a week. One part kerosene and two parts vaseline will help cure mange ; or 
apply one part sulphur and two parts lard daily for a few days. When apply- 
ing coal-tar disinfectants for mange, make the solution one part to ten of 
water. 

SCALY DISEASE OF THE SKIN.— The skin of the hog when subjected 
to the hot sun in summer and to the zero weather of winter very often scales 
and becomes rough. 

SYMPTOMS. — First, pimples appear and there oozes out a fluid which 
hardens and seems to cause the skin to come off in flakes. This is the most 
common skin disease in hogs. 

TREATMENT. — If the pig is fleshy give it a dose of jihysic, feed less 
grain and more cooling laxative food, and apply one part of oxide of zinc and 
three parts of vaseline to the sore parts of the skin once or twice a day. Give 
four drops of Fowler's solution and three grains of iodide of potassium at a 
dose in feed two or three times a day. Dissolve one-fourth pound of sugar of 
lead in one gallon of water and apply three times a day. Many of the simple 
home remedies are good. 
PEOPLE'S HOME REMEDIES FOR REMOVING SCURF.— 

1. Buttermilk. — Wash the pigs each day with buttermilk until the scurf 
is entirely removed. 

LICHEN. — When the skin is covered with a great many small pimples 
around the hair follicles, in sort of patches, we are led to believe the pig is 
suffering from lichen'. The hair usually falls out and the skin scales some, 
but in a few weeks the hair commences to grow again. 

TREATMENT. — Give two-thirds of a teaspoonful of sulphur, ten grains 
of saltpeter and one-half teaspoonful of baking soda at a dose in feed three 
times a day. Wash the pig with baking soda and water. 

MEASLES. — Measles is a very common ailment in pigs and it is very 
contagious. 

SYMPTOMS. — It is generally attended with a cough, some sneezing, 
and loss of appetite in severe cases, but in mild cases the pig is not notice- 
ably sick. There is some sore throat and a rash breaks out on the fourth day 
but if the skin is not white this might be overlooked. If the disease is 
severe the eyes become inflamed, the lids swell, the temperature rises, the 
pulse becomes quick and there is fast breathing. About the eighth day 
the disease begins to subside. 

TREATMENT.— It is 'unnecessary to treat mild cases, other than to 
give them good care and see that the bowels move freely; if not, give sulphate 
of magnesia in small doses; also give nitrate of potash to reduce the fever. 
If there is coughing give any good home-made cough remedy, or give lauda- 
num. In some cases the pig suffers from weakness ; if so, gi-\-e tonics and 



HOGS— DISEASES OF SKIN. 213 

stimulants such as whiskey and quinine and if the pig has diarrhea, give 
opium ; but keep in mind that if the pigs are not exposed to storms and too 
much wet and filth when they are sick they need very little if any medicine. 

SCARLET FEVER. — This is a contagious disease which runs its course 
in seven or eight days and is very often diagnosed as measles ; however, the 
symptoms are not alike but it requires some experience to tell the diflference. 

SYMPTOMS. — The first indications of sickness are dullness', stiffness, 
a fast pulse, fevei-, great thirst, loss of appetite, vomiting, stupor, delirium 
and sometimes convulsions. 

TREATMENT. — It is well to keep in mind the fact that a great many 
pigs have suffered from scarlet fever and recovered without treatment. It 
is also a fact that many hogs are given medicines for scarlet fever that could 
in no way assist nature in throwing off the poison of this disease. Look 
after the general comfort of the pig and see that he has good care. If the 
bowels are costive, give castor oil or epsom salts, but in small doses, for if 
the bowels get to acting too freely you may find it troublesome to stop the 
purging. If the throat is sore, dissolve twelve grains of chlorate of potash 
in two ounces of water and gargle the throat four times a day. If the pig 
shows much weakness give whiskey and quinine three times a day; or, give 
carbonate of ammonia iri fifteen-grain doses three times a day. 

RINGWORM. — Ringworm is not common in pigs ; however, we do meet 
with cases of it. It is due to the presence of a vegetable parasite and of course 
spreads rapidly when meeting with a suitable abode. 

SYMPTOMS. — When the hair drops out of the skin in ring-like patches 
and the center becomes dry and the edge moist, the ringworm parasite is 
generally present. This disease is contagious to other pigs and likewise to 
man, but man is easily cured for these parasites do not seem to live a great 
length of time in him. 

TREATMENT. — Iodine ointment is a remedy, but before applying it 
wash the sores with soap and water. Another remedy is to dissolve one 
ounce of carbolic acid in four ounces of alcohol and apply to the sores twice 
a week. It will often effect a cure. Sulphur, one part, and lard, two parts 
acts well. 
ERYSIPELAS.— 

CAUSES. — There can be little doubt that this disease is due to an or- 
ganism and it seems to follow wounds or injuries to the skin when there is 
an abrasion sufficient to allow germs to be picked up and pass into the cir- 
culation and infect the pig. Certain aqimals seem to be easy victims of this 
ailment. It seems to be influenced by diet and exposure. The disease may 
be said to be both local and constitutional. This being a contagious disease, 
the sick should be kept away from the well hogs. 

TREATMENT.— The bowels should be opened with either castor oil or 
epsom salts; also, give aconite to reduce the fever; or, give nitrate of potas- 
sium. To relieve the pain give opium and it is good practice to give tincture 
of chloride of iron in twenty or twenty-five-drop doses every few hours. Feed 
milk, oatmeal or eggs and if very weak give quinine and whiskey. When blis- 
ters form, open them. This will keep the skin in better condition than if 
they are left alone. Be sure to let the pig have plenty of fresh water. 

WARTS. — Warts are caused by some deranged condition of the outer 
skin and soon the true skin becomes diseased and thickens. When a wart 



216 THE PEOPLE'S HOME STOCK BOOK. 

meets with friction, causing it to bleed, it grows, sometimes to quite' a size. 
Some warts seem to spread out and cover considerable surface of the skin. 

TREATMENT.— If the wart has a well-defined neck, cut it off; if large, 
it will bleed some and to prevent this heat a piece of knife-shaped iron 
red hot and burn off the wart instead of cutting it. The hot iron stops hem- 
orrhage. Or, tie a string around its neck, leaving it for a few days and if 
it does not slough off, tie on another string and leave it on until the wart 
drops off; then apply nitrate of silver or carbolic acid, or terchloride of anti- 
mony, or one part of chromic acid and five parts water. These caustic applica- 
tions will kill the roots. 

LICE. — When swine are infected with lice they soon commence to lose 
flesh and grow thin, but lice are so easily gotten rid of that no hog need 
have them. 

TREATMENT. — Apply coal-tar disinfectant, one part to twenty of water, 
once a day or boil stavesacre seed and make a decoction and it will kill lice 
quickly. Or, use a decoction of tobacco. Fairly good results follow the 
use of one part kerosene arid ten parts of soap suds. Or, light applications 
of fish oil will drive off lice. 
PEOPLE'S HOME REMEDIES FOR LICE.— 

1. Coal Oil and Lard. — Rub the hogs with a mixture of equal parts of 
coal oil and lard if they have lice. Repeat in a week or ten days. 

2. Kerosene. — Rub with kerosene oil and repeat in ten days. 

3. Carbolic Acid Solution. — Rub the hogs with one part of carbolic acid 
diluted with thirty parts of water and you will kill the lice. Better repeat* in 
a week.

(Photographed at Dr. Fair's "Mentor Stock Farm" especially for this book.) 



DISEASES OF THE GENERATIVE ORGANS. 

(Including Farrowing or Pigging, Eversion of Womb, Inflammation of Womb, 
Inflammation of Udder, Castration, Etc.) 



FARROWING OR PIGGING.— The usual time for gestation in sows if 
they are strong and healthy is a little less than four months. A weak, young 
sow pigs earlier. Six weeks after a sow has been served she begins to get 
big and heavy, growing more so until she farrows. While pregnant she 
should be well fed and allowed to exercise and her bowels should be moder- 
ately open when she farrows. She should be kept in a pen with the tempera- 
ture from 60 to 70 degrees until her pigs dry, then it is not necessary to keep 
them as warm as when they wei-e born. Young pigs chill easily and cold 
pens for brood sows cost their owners money on account of the death of 
the pigs. The sow should have plenty of short bedding with which to make 
a nest before she farrows. 

SYMPTOMS. — When the sow begins to make preparations for pigging 
she is uneasy, gathers straw and arranges it for her nest, lies down and ex- 
pels her pigs. Of course the water bag breaks first. The forefeet first with 
the nose between them is the proper position for a young pig. Should you 
be obliged to help her, put the pig in the natural position, oil the passage 
with carbolized lard and if the hand is used instead of instruments it should 
be a small hand. I prefer to use instruments. Pigs can be taken away hind 
.feet first. 
PEOPLE'S HOME REMEDIES TO PREVENT AND CURE EATING 

OF PIGS.— 

1. Preventive and Cure. — Make a mixture of equal parts of salt, sulphur, 
charcoal and wood ashes and keep this before the sows all the time and espe- 
cially at pigging time. This is a preventive but if they have begun eating 
the pigs, give them all the salt pork they will eat. 

EVERSION OF THE WOMB.— This is where the pig bed is turned out 
on account of the sow's being weak at farrowing time or getting into a posi- 
tion where the hind parts are much lower than the fore parts or on account 
of the vagina being large and the uterus slipping into it and turning inside 
out. 

SYMPTOMS. — The uterus, or pig bed, when turned out is quite large. 
It is red and inflamed and this cannot be mistaken for any other ailment. 

TREATMENT.— In the first place the womb should be kept clean and 
not injured. Bathe the parts with cold water to somewhat reduce the swell- 
ing. Then elevate her hind quarters and return the uterus, but before doing 
so, pour on a one per cent, solution of carbolic acid and water. This is made 
with one part of carbolic acid and 99 parts water. Or, use one part bi-chloride 
of mercury and twenty-five hundred parts of warm water, or one part coal-tar 
and fifty parts of water. As soon as the parts are in place sew up the upper 
part of the vulva and give the sow a teaspoonful or more of laudanum every 
two or three hours to keep her from straining. Her bowels should be kept 
open and, if necessary, give epsom salts, three or four ounces a day. The hind 
parts in some cases should be Tcept higher than the fore parts. 

217 



218 THE PEOPLE'S HOME STOCK BOOK. 

INFLAMMATION OF THE WOMB.— This is likely to come on after 
eversion or where the sow was improperly helped during farrowing, . or kept 
in a cold, damp, filthy pen or place after farrowing. I have known it to come 
on without any well-known cause. 

SYMPTOMS. — The symptoms are loss of appetite, dullness, thirst, pain 
and fever. The vulva usually swells and there is some vaginal discharge. 

TREATMENT. — Give aconite to reduce the fever, or saltpeter acts 
well. Wash out the womb with boric acid and warm water, as much acid 
as the water will dissolve, and run it through a rubber tube with a funnel. 
Give laudanum or belladonna to quiet the pain- and keep the bowels loose. 
Feed cooling, laxative food. 
INFLAMED UDDER- 
CAUSES. — Improper care, a wet bed, exposure to cold, over-feeding and 
the loss of a part or the whole of a litter are the causes. 

SYMPTOMS. — There is some loss of appetite, fever, shrinkage in milk 
and a hard and tender udder. 

TREATMENT. — Give epsom salts as a cathartic and some saltpeter 
three times a day. Foment the udder with hot water three times a day and 
rub with camphorated oil daily. 

CASTRATION. — When I was raising pigs myself I made it a practice to 
castrate them when they were two or three weeks old and I do not now re- 
call that any of them had not fully recovered from the shock before wean- 
ing time, but in my practice I have been called upon to castrate them at all 
ages and the older they are the more it seems to affect them. Therefore, 
I urge you to castrate pigs early for there is then much less risk. When you 
get ready to castrate the "pigs, mix one part of carbolic acid and fifty parts of 
water, lay your knife in it, wash the pigs scrotum with the same, also dip 
your hands in it. Put the pig on his back in a furrow or trough and tie or hold 
his legs or, if he is small, your assistant can hold his head between his knees. 
Place the left hand under the testicle, making a bold incision and allowing 
the testicle to escape ; separate the covering from the testicle ; tie a piece of 
catgut, silk or linen thread tightly around the cord to stop bleeding; let the 
ends of the thread hang out of the scrotum a few inches but cut off the cord 
leaving one-half or three quarters of an inch below the string and in a few 
days the string will drop off or may be pulled off. The knife and operator's 
hands should be cleaned before another pig is operated on. When operating 
on a ruptured boar the hind quarters should be placed a few inches higher 
than the fore quarters. The pig should be empty and, if you are operating 
on an old boar your work will be made much easier if he is quite empty. 
After cleaning the scrotum, cut through the skin but not the last covering 
of the testicle; separate this from the outer covering and force the testicle 
out; then place a string around the cord three inches above the testicle and 
cut off the cord, leaving it an inch longer than in simple cases and also be 
sure the string is tight for if it slips off the bowel may come out. In badly 
ruptured boars it is a good plan to stitch the wound in the scrotum and also 
to keep him empty until the string comes off and the wound heals besides, 
they should be kept by themselves in a quiet place and one part of carbolic' 
acid and thirty parts of water should be applied to the wound twice a day. 
Young pigs may be allowed to run with others after this operation 



VARIOUS DISEASES. 

(Including Thumps, Rheumatism, Founder or Sore Feet, Diseases of the Eye, 
Brain Troubles, Apoplexy, Blind Staggers, Paralysis, Chorea, How to Tell 
the Age of Hogs, and General Rules as to Care, Feeding and Raising of 
Hogs.) 



THUMPS— PALPITATION OF THE HEART,— 

CAUSES. — This is an ailment which most generally attacks young pigs 
that are fleshy and do not have enough exercise. It is perhaps the result of 
a spasmodic contraction of the diaphragm and just what should bring this 
on is none too well understood, for it seems to attack the finest looking ones 
of the litter. A morbid condition of the system causes it, also worms and 
feeding food which does not contain sufficient nitrogen. 

SYMPTOMS. — The pig is taken with a sort of hiccough and jerking of 
the body with palpitation of the heart and there may be spasms of the 
diaphragm as well ; however, it is not easy to tell. 

TREATMENT. — More can be done in the line of prevention than curing 
the diseased ones. If the sow is a deep milker and the pigs are too fat, 
purge her and reduce her food allowance. Also see that she and her pigs 
have more exercise. If their bowels need attention, give either epsom salts 
or castor oil to open them. It is always wise to diet the sow and pigs 
after one shows thumps for fear of more becoming affected. You will find 
digitalis a useful drug; or, give aromatic spirits of ammonia every hour or 
two. As soon as the pigs have some appetite feed them milk, eggs, and oat- 
meal gruel but not too much at a time. 

RHEUMATISM. — This is a very common ailment of young pigs. Cer- 
tain conditions of the body seem to be just right for them to become stiff and 
sore. Many veterinarians believe it to be the result of an acid, either lactic 
or uric; however, this is doubtful. Certain animals seem to have a predis- 
position to become rheumatic and when subjected to exciting causes .they 
soon become sore and lame. 

SYMPTOMS. — The fetlock joints very often swell, there is lameness in 
one or more legs, some fever, loss of appetite and, if there be much inflamma- 
tion, the joints swell. Rheumatism may attack any organ of the body. 

TREATMENT. — Give sulphate of magnesia to open the bowels 
promptly; also give ten-grain doses of iodide of potassium at a dose three 
times a day. In chronic cases give five drops of Fowler's solution at a 
dose in feed two or three times a day. Give ten grains of carbonate of potash 
or citrate of potash or sodium salicylate at a dose three times a day until 
you can notice some results, then give smaller doses or fewer doses a day. 
If the joints are swollen apply equal parts of extract of witch hazel, fluid 
extract of belladonna and tincture of opium twice a day._ Equal parts of 
turpentine, aqua ammonia and sweet oil is another good liniment for rheu- 
matic joints and it should be applied daily. 

FOUNDER OR SORE FEET. — It is not unusual to find pigs walking 
\ ery foot-sore, especially after walking far on a hard road or walking about 

219 



THE PEOPLE'S HOME STOCK BOOK„ 

in a pen when fattening or when fed a large quantity of grain at a time when 
they were not accustomed to it. This brings on a sort of founder in hc^& 

SYMPTOMS. — When a pig travels with the forefeet far in advance 
of the body and continually changes feet he is foot-sore. 

TREATMENT. — If in summer, stand the pig in wet clay or sasif 
to cool his feet; if in winter, apply hot poultices. Reduce his grain supply 
and feed cooling, laxative food, such as vegetables and grass. Give epsom 
salts to open the bowels and some saltpeter in the feed or water two or three ' 
times a day. If the sores appear between the toes or on the back part of 
the heel apply chloride of zinc and water, one dram to a pint ; or, apply one 
part of carbolic acid and ten parts of water twice a day. Be sure to keep 
the pig in a clean, dry place. 

WOUNDS. — Hogs are often wounded by dogs, by cattle hooking them, 
by kicks from horses wearing sharp shoes and by running against barbed 
wire fences and sharp snags. 

TREATMENT. — Apply one part coal-tar disinfectant and fifty parts 
water, or one part carbolic acid and fifty parts water; or, dissolve one- 
fourth pound of sugar of lead, one-fourth pound of sulphate of zinc and two 
ounces of carbolic acid in a gallon of water, which makes a good and not to» 
expensive healing remedy for wounds on hogs. "A good healing powder is 
made by mixing equal parts of oxide of zinc, powdered alum and boric acid. 
This should be applied twice daily. 

AMAUROSIS— PARALYSIS OF THE RETINA.— Amaurosis is a di- 
lation ,of the pupil of the eye, usually lasting in its effects and giving the eye 
a glassy and greenish appearance. It causes blindness. 

CAUSES. — The optic nerve is affected and there is generally some de- 
rangement of the digestive organs with, perhaps, some worms in the stomach. 

TREATMENT. — A cathartic of castor oil or epsom salts with some 
worm medicine will give relief if any treatment will. It is also necessary 
to keep the pig in a dark pen which is free from foul gases. 

DISEASES OF THE EYEBALL.— The eyes of pigs seem to be 
as exempt from eye diseases as those of any other domestic animal; how- 
ever, they are sometimes troubled with inflamed eyes, the result of exposure 
to cold, heat and sunshine. Living in acrid, nasty vapors and also foreign 
bodies making their way into the eyes are other causes. 

SYMPTOMS. — Whenever the tears flow over the cheek or the eye 
seems inflamed it is well to make an examination and ascertain if any foreign 
body is in the eye. 

TREATMENT. — Simple ophthalmia usually results from injuries which 
cause an inflammation of the eyeball and mucous membrane of the eye and 
is best treated by placing the pig in a dark pen or shaded place and applying- 
hot water. Follow with applications of boric acid and water, just as much 
acid as the water will dissolve; or, dissolve fifty grains of sugar of lead in 
one-half pint of rain water, add a teaspoonful of laudanum and apply three 
times a day. When the acute inflammation subsides a film or scum covers 
the eye. If this is the case,_ blow some calomel into the eye once a day 
or dissolve four grains of nitrate of silver and one grain of sulphate of 
atrop-ia in one ounce of rain water and apply to the eye daily. 

PHRENITIS AND MENINGITIS— INFLAMMATION OF THE 
BRAIN AND ITS MEMBRANES.— Phrenitis, or inflammation of the brain. 



HOGS— VARIOUS DISEASES. 321 

and also meningitis, or inflammation of the membranes of the brain, give rise 
to very much the same symptoms; therefore, we shall not need to take up 
«ach separately as nearly all the parts are involved when one is inflamed. 

CAUSES. — It can be safely stated that over-feeding on rich nutritious 
foad without the pig's having enough exercise and fresh air is the most 
tommon cause of these ailments. They are also caused by injuries, other 
dliseases, feeding improper food, over exertion and a faulty circulation. 

SYMPTOMS. — There is generally dullness, loss of appetite and stag- 
gering and these are followed by delirium and in some cases vomiting. The 
pulse is fast and full. I have seen them chase chickens and run into things. 

TREATMENT. — First of all, remove the cause as quickly as possible 
if you can tell what it is. Give two or three ounces of epsom salts to open 
tfae bowels. Give four drops of tincture of aconite every three hours, but 
discontinue it if the pig vomits. Put ice packs on the head and keep them 
on until the pig is better and apply some strong liniment at the junction 
of the spinal cord and brain twice a day. 

APOPLEXY. — This derangement is an ailment in hogs confined almost 
exclusively to those that are too fat. 

SYMPTOMS. — The attack comes on suddenly; if eating the hog will 
stop and appear restless and act stupid; the eyes are blood-shot and promi- 
sient and in a few moments the hog may fall, froth at the mouth and soon get 
fflp. Other cases prove fatal. 

TREATMENT. — I have known many recoveries to follow bleeding from 
the veins of the leg, but these cases might have recovered without treatment. 
When you bleed a hog suffering from apoplexy; tie a string around the 
foreleg above the knee, open the vein on the inside of the leg and be sure 
to use a clean knife or lancet. If it is a bad case, open the other vein of the 
Joreleg and take away not less than a pint; or, perhaps one-half pint more 
can be taken away to advantage. To close the wound use a clean pin, passing 
it through both edges, and tie a string back of the pin; this will prevent 
Meeding. In most cases it is good practice to give two or three ounces of 
<epsom salts and reduce the food supply. If it occurs in summer, place the 
hog in a cool place and apply cold water to the head. 
PEOPLE'S HOME REMEDIES FOR EPILEPSY.— 

1. Aloes and Potassium Bromide. — Give one dram of aloes and follow 
with ten-grain doses of potassium bromide. 

BLIND STAGGERS.— This ailment is brought on by generous feed- 
ing and keeping hogs in badly ventilated and filthy pens. 

SYMPTOMS. — The hog is stupid, does not see well, runs against things, 
moves in a circle and is likely to fall. It is sometimes caused by effusion 
in the' brain and may develop quite suddenly. After he falls there is consid- 
erable frothing at the mouth with hard breathing, jerking and stiffening of 
the limbs. 

TREATMENT. — Apply cold water to the head, place the pig in a com- 
fortable place and give a dose of epsom salts. If the pig is less than three 
months old a tablespoonful of salts is a large enough dose. If he is weak 
give a teaspoonful of sweet spirits of nitre and a dessert spoonful of whiskey 
in cold water as a drench ; and if high feeding and filth has caused it, reduce 
the grain ration for a few days; also give the pig a dose of epsom salts once 
a week for thirty days and keep the hog in a dry clean pen.

PEOPLES HOME REMEDIES FOR BLIND STAGGERS.— 

1. Cold Water.— Pour cold water on the head. 

PARALYSIS. — This is a common ailment in pigs, mostly afifecting the 
hind limbs and resulting in either partial or complete loss of power of the 
limbs. 

CAUSES. — It is not always easy to tell what causes paralysis ; however, 
it is general 1}' the result of accident, some error in feeding or some other 
sickness or disease. 

TREATMENT.— If it is the result of a fractured back, destroy the hog; 
but if the loss of power is only partial and the hind quarters possess sensa- 
tion, then apply hot applications to the back or apply some good home 
liniment, or mustard and water daily; or, apply equal parts of turpentine, 
aqua ammonia and either sweet oil or raw linseed oil once a day. Give six 
or eight drops of fluid extract of nux vomica and one-half teaspoonful of 
fluid extract of buchu at a dose three times a day. The bowels should be 
opened by giving castor oil or epsom salts and the hog should be fed laxa- 
tive food. 

CHOREA. — Chorea is a disease of the nervous system, characterized by 
involuntary and convulsive muscular movements of one or more parts of the 
body. The contractions are not rigid and persistent as in lockjaw but ap- 
pear as though they were voluntary movements. 

CAUSES. — There is an excited state of the nervous system, perhaps 
the result of perverted nutrition of the nerves in the part afifected or possibljj 
due to defective nutrition of the body. However, I have seen pigs and 'old 
hogs affected with chorea that did not appear to be unhealthy; therefore, it 
IS not easy to tell what brought it on. 

TREATMENT. — I have obtained the best results by giving Fowler's 
solution in four or five-drop doses and sub-carbonate of iron in one-quarter 
to one-half-dram doses three times a day, or five drops of tincture of nux 
vomica three times a day. 

HOW TO TELL THE AGE OF A PIG.— At birth the young pig usu- 
ally has eight teeth, four temporary incisors and four tushes ; at ten or twelve 
days old the second and third temporary molars appear; at 30 days, four in- 
cisors are out, two in the upper and two in the lower jaw ; at the sixth or 
seventh week the front molars can be seen and at three or three and one-half 
months, four more are in, two in each jaw; now all the temporary or milk 
teeth are in. At six or seven months a tooth appears just behind the tem- 
porary tushes on both sides and in the upper jaw just in front of the grinders 
we also find the fourth molar coming through the gum. At nine months 
the comer incisor teeth are displaced and the permanent ones come in their 
place ; also, the permanent tushes come at this time and the fifth grinders on 
each side of the jaws come at this time. At twelve months the middle in- 
cisors are replaced by permanent ones and the temporary incisors are shed 
and replaced by permanent ones, and at eighteen months the hog has a full 
set of teeth as the lateral incisors and sixth molars are up and in good order. 
In estimating the age of a pig it is well to take in his general appearance for 
some of them have a full set of permanent teeth a month or six weeks earlier 
than others. 

PEOPLE'S HOME REMEDIES FOR KEEPING HOGS IN HEALTH.— 
1 Salt and Lime. — Mix equal parts of salt and air-slacked lime and 



HOGS— VARIOUS DISEASES. 3^3 

keep this mixture before the hogs all the time if you would keep them in good 
health. 

2. Sulphur and Charcoal, — Occasionally feed the hogs a little sulphur in 
their feed. Also keep plenty of charcoal where they can get it whenever they 
desire. 

3. Salt and Ashes. — Feed salt and ashes at least once a week if you 
would keep them in health. 

4. Soft Coal. — Feed the hogs all the soft coal they will eat and they 
will eat ^ lot of it. 

5. Tobacco. — A teaspoonful of tobacco once a week will keep the hogs 
in good condition. 

6. Burnt Com. — Burnt corn is a good form of charcoal to give the hogs. 
PEOPLE'S SUGGESTIONS AND RULES AS TO THE CARE, FEED- 
ING AND RAISING OF HOGS.— 

1. The pens should be warm but well ventilated at the top. 

2. The floor of the pen should be covered with a foot of clay. 

3. The feeding floor should be open to the sun but should have a goo^ 
slope so as to carry off the rain. 

4. The surrounding ground should slope away from the pen so as to 
carry off water and refuse. 

5. The hogs should at all times have access to a stream of pure run- 
ning water. 

6. The stomach should be kept in good condition and not overloaded. 

7. Hogs fed on corn should also have green food and sour slop may 
also be fed to advantage. 

8. If the hogs are kept on clover they should not have slops but should 
have potatoes, turnips or other roots. 

9. If the tongues are contracted and red the hogs should have some 
slops or should be turned on clover. 

10. If the tongues are large, pale and flabby the hogs should have corn 
and cooked roots and should be given soda in the feed. 

11. Where the hogs are kept on clover, a .d root vegetables cannot be 
given them, they should have plenty of soda and lime. 

12. Keep their pens clean and free from lice and at once separate a»y 
sick ones from the rest of the herd. 

13. See that they have plenty of charcoal, ashes, and salt. 

14. In case of disease use disinfectants freely.

ROUP.— 

CAUSES. — Roup is caused by a micro-organism and of course is a 
highly contagious disease and one that is quite destructive to poultry. It 
is supposed to result from other debilitating diseases but this is a mistake. 

SYMPTOMS. — The early symptoms are much the same as in catarrh, the 
discharge being thick, sticky and offensive. The eyelids swell, the sides of 
the face bulge and the bird seems to grow weak rapidly and if the disease 
is not checked death results. 

TREATMENT.— When this contagious disease exists in a small flock 
of chickens that are of small value it is often good business judgment to kill 
and burn every one of the fowls for, all things considered, it is the least 
expensive way out of the trouble. The healthy and well birds should be 
moved away at once to a clean place and the diseased ones treated where'they 
are. This will prevent spreading the contagion. Give at once a dessert 
spoonful of castor oil and repeat in twelve hours if it does not act. Put a 
teaspoonful of carbolic acid and a tablespoonful of glycerine into a pint of 
water and syringe some into the slit in the roof of the mouth twice a day. 
Put some finely powdered boric acid into the eyes daily and drop a small 
quantity of calomel into the eyes three times a week. Some poultry raisers 
use kerosene and others use one dram of sulphate of copper dissolved in a pint 
of water and inject into the nose once a day. The coop and all food and 
water dishes should be either scalded or disinfected before they are used. 
One part carbolic acid and fifty of water or one part coal-tar disinfectant 
and thirty of water are the right proportions. If you do not thoroughly dis- 
infect and clean the poultry house, do not keep other well poultry in it for 
three or four months. 
PEOPLE'S HOME REMEDIES FOR ROUP.— 

1. Carbolic Acid, Etc.— The eyes, mouth and throat should be bathed 
with a solution of ten grains of carbolic acid in an ounce of water. Feed 
soft feed in which is mixed either black or cayenne pepper. Also put a few 
drops of hartshorn into the drinking water. Keep in a clean warm place. 

_ 2._ Sulphur and Lard. — Mix sulphur and lard, make into pills and put 
a pill into the throat of each chicken that has the roup. 

3. Coal Oil. — Hold the chicken's head under coal oil until it breathes 
once. 

PIP. — This ailment usually follows sore mouth, a crust or scale forming 
on the tip of the tongue which seems to be irritated from the fowl's breath- 
ing through the mouth when the head is stopped up from catarrh or cold in 
the head. 

TREATMENT.— Soften the scale by applying either sweet oil, gly-

cerine or cream and wash out the mouth with a solution of boric acid and 
water, which is made by dissolving all the boric acid the water will absorb. 
Or, put one ounce of chlorate of potash and two drams of borax into one 
quart of water and wash out the mouth twice a day. If the bowels are cos- 
tive give a teaspoonful of castor oil daily until they open. 
PEOPLE'S HOME REMEDIES FOR PIP.— 

1. Butter and Scotch Snuff. — Remove the thickened membrane from the 
tongue with the finger nails. Make some pills by mixing Scotch snuff with 
butter and put two or three of these pills down the chicken's throat. Keep 
the chicken from the cold and damp. 

3. Butter, Pepper, Garlic and Horseradish. — Make some pills by mixing 
some butter, pepper, garlic and horseradish and, after removing the lump 
from the tongue, put two or three of these pills down the chicken's throat. 
GAPES.— 

CAUSES. — ^This ailment is caused by a small red worm which lodges 
in the windpipe of chickens from two to five months old. This worm is 
generally closely attached to the lining of the windpipe. The male is about 
one-fourth of an inch in length and the female is almost twice as long and 
they are very often found close together. 

SYMPTOMS. — When chickens have gapes they usually open and close 
the mouth frequently. In very bad cases they cough, seem droopy, show 
great weakness and soon die. When opened the worms are found without 
trouble. 

TREATMENT. — In order to cure the gapes you must be able to kill the 
worms that are causing it. Take a small swab or stripped feather, dip it 
into either tincture of chloride of iron or turpentine and insert it in the 
opening to the windpipe at the base of the tongue and turn it around very 
gently a time or two and then withdraw. This will perhaps be all that is 
necessary to effect a cure. In very young chickens apply one part of tur- 
pentine and four parts of lard or vaseline to the throats daily. Season the 
food with pepper, onions, ginger or gentian, adding some asafetida. Sepa- 
rate the sick and well and keep the fowls in a dry place. Use disinfectants 
freely and burn the droppings of the sick ones. 
PEOPLE'S HOME REMEDIES FOR GAPES IN POULTRY.— 

1. Smoking with Tobacco. — Put the chickens into a box containing a 
pan of live coals upon which has been sprinkled some fine cut tobacco. The 
pan should be fixed so that the chickens cannot get into it and the box 
should be covered with an old sack or piece of carpet. The chickens should 
be left in the box until they become drunk or stupefied but not long enough 
to smother them. The first time you try this treatment you will think you 
have killed all your chickens but if they are watched and not smoked too long 
there is no danger and the chickens will revive when fresh air is admitted. 
The tobacco smoke kills the little red worms in the throat which are the cause 
of gapes. This treatment never fails. 

2. Air-Slacked Lime. — Put the chickens into a tight box and over this 
spread a piece of cloth and through this sift some air-slacked lime. The air 
in the box will thus be full of fine particles of lime and breathing this will 
kill the little worms that cause this disease. Do not leave the chickens 
in the box long enough to smother them. 

3. Camphor. — Put camphor in the drinking water if you would cure 
the chickens of gapes. 

8—16 



326 THE PEOPLE'S HOME STOCK BOOK. 

4. Tallow and Oatmeal Porridge. — Melt a tallow candle and mix with 
a quart of thick oatmeal porridge and feed to the chickens. 

5. Turpentine. — Give the chick five or six drops of spirits of turpentine 
three times a day until cured. Another way to administer the turpentine is 
to dip a feather into the turpentine and then carefully swab out the throat 
or windpipe. This must be r done with care. 

6. Carbolic Acid. — Put some carbolic acid into a large spoon and hold 
over a lamp. Hold the chicken's head over this until it breathes in enough 
of the fumes to become almost suffocated. This will kill the gape worms 
that cause the trouble. 

7. Sulphur and Alum. — Mix two parts of sulphur with one part of pul- 
verized alum and blow this mixture down the throat. This may be re- 
peated two or three times if necessary. 

8. Soft Soap. — Make some pills by mixing some soft soap with dough 
and give each chicken one of these pills. 

DIPHTHERIA. — This disease gives rise to, many symptoms which are 
similar to roup or contagious catarrh. It is necessary to make a close ex- 
amination in order to distinguish between the two diseases. Being a con- 
tagious disease it is spread in much the same manner. 

SYMPTOMS. — In addition to the symptoms of roup, the tongue, mouth, > 
throat and windpipe are covered with false membranes which present a 
grayish color and when removed the parts underneath are left raw and usu- 
ally bleeding. This condition we do not as a rule find in roup. 

TREATMENT. — ^The treatment should be similar to that for roup but 
the tongue and mouth should be treated with one part glycerine and three 
parts tincture iodine twice a day for a few days. Then apply either sweet 
oil or glycerine. Put a dessert spoonful of carbolic acid into a pint of water 
and use it the same as for roup. I have obtained fairly good results by using 
protargol and water, also permanganate of potash and water, and thought 
that coal-tar disinfectant applied full strength helped effect a cure. Sickly . 
weak children, and in fact ail young children, should be kept away from them. 
This disease, however, differs from diphtheria in man and if contracted is 
not nearly so dangerous. 
BRONCHITIS.— 

CAUSES. — When catarrh of the upper air passages extends into the tubes 
of the lungs it is called bronchitis. 

SYMPTOMS. — If you listen with the ear at the breast, a wheezing sound 
will be heard. The fowl holds the head high, coughs some, is dumpish and 
a bad odor comes from the nose. 

TREATMENT.— Make the fowl as comfortable as possible by placing 
it in a clean, well ventilated place. Dip the nose into one part of peroxide 
of hydrogen and four parts of water twice a day. Steam the head with 
carbolic acid and hot water once a day. Put one-half ounce of chlorate of 
potassium and one-fourth ounce of citrate of iron into a gallon of drinking 
water and let them have what they want. If the bowels are costive give a 
teaspoonful of castor oil twice a day until they move freely. 
CATARRH.— 

CAUSES. — Poultry that are kept in damp filthy houses or coops and roost 
in windy places are very likely to suffer from catarrh. 

SYMPTOMS. — The eyelids usually swell some. At first a watery dis- 
charge comes from tbe nose to be followed later by a thicker mucus and the 



POULTRY DISEASES. , 237 

face on each side generally swells some. In bad cases the fowls breathe 
with a little difficulty. 

TREATMENT. — As soon as possible remove the fowls to a dry com- 
fortable place which is free from drafts and feed them easily-digested food, 
highly seasoned with either black or red pepper or ginger. Wash out the 
mouth, nostrilp and eyes with a saturated solution of boric acid. This is 
prepared by dissolving as much boric acid as the water will take up and it 
should be applied twice a day. One part peroxide of hydrogen and four parts 
of water applied to the mouth and nostrils removes the mucus and makes 
breathing easier and thus assists in bringing about a recovery. 
PEOPLE'S HOME REMEDIES FOR EPIZOOTIC— 

1. Tar and Asafetida. — Mix some tar and asafetida and give ten drops 
twice a day in the feed. Also feed a warm bran mash once a day. 
CANKER- 
CAUSES. — Feeding chickens filthy, putrid and diseased meat and keeping 
them in coops that are filled with foul gas and in unsanitary quarters of any 
kind are likely to induce canker in fowls. Musty, badly-cured grain that 
has been kept in damp places also seems to cause canker. 

SYMPTOMS. — Suppurating sores on the top of the head and also in 
the mouth and throat, with some discharge from the eyes are the leading 
symptoms of canker. 

TREATMENT. — Wash the sores with peroxide of hydrogen, one part, 
and water three parts, twice a day. Ten minutes later apply boric acid 
and water, as much acid as the water will absorb ; or, one part of carbolic acid 
to thirty parts of water should be carefully applied to the ulcers twice daily. 
Touching the sore with one part of sulphate of copper and fifty parts of water 
helps heal them. Any good family mouth wash or healing powder will 
help heal canker sores in chickens. 
CROP-BOUND.— 

CAUSES. — Chickens that swallow pieces of bone or sticks and eat too 
much food that is dry, which, when meeting with moisture becomes a hard 
mass, are the fowls which sufifer from crop-bound. 

SYMPTOMS. — There is loss of appetite, dullness and drowsiness and 
the crop is bulged out and very hard. 

TREATMENT. — Give castor oil, sweet oil, fresh butter or lard to soften 
the contents of the crop. Then hold the head down, hand-rub the crop and 
gradually work the food out of the body. If this fails, open the crop and re- 
move its contents, then stitch up the crop and the chicken will soon be well. 
After this operation feed often but not much food at a time as the crop 
should not be distfended too much until it is healed. 

INFLAMMATION OF THE EGG PASSAGE.— It is not always an 
easy matter to tell what brings on an inflammation of the egg passage but, 
fortunately, it is not by any means a common ailment in poultry. 

SYMPTOMS. — The symptoms are an inflamed inside of the passage and 
frequent straining. If the yolk of the egg is pressed out and is found cov- 
ered with blood, the whole passage is then more or less irritated. The chicken 
has fever and the feathers appear dry and rough. 

TREATMENT. — Give epsom salts to open the bowels; one-half tea- 
spoonful is a full dose for a large chicken and the medicine should be given 
daily until the desired effect is produced. Also give one-fourth grain of calo- 
mel to act on the liver, and this medicine should be given twice a week for 



338 THE PEOPLE'S HOME STOCK BOOK. 

two weeks. Feed vegetables instead of grain while the fowl has fever. A 
chicken of small value is hardly worth what it costs to treat it. 

APOPLEXY. — Apoplexy is generally brought on by too generous feeding 
and insufificient exercise and is perhaps sometimes the result of straining in 
laying eggs. It is also induced by keeping fowls in close confinement in 
filthy coops where the air is foul. 

SYMPTOMS.— The attack is sudden and death follows quickly. How- 
ever, if the case is a mild one the chicken is dumpish and stupid for several 
days before it comes on. 

TREATMENT. — More can be done in the line of prevention than in 
the way of curing. After the attack is on it is generally too late for treat- 
ment for the chicken soon dies. If the chicken is noticed to be dizzy or in- 
clined to fall, apply cold applications to the head or let a stream of cold water 
run on the head for a few minutes. Give epsom salt^ to open the bowels and 
reduce the food supply, especially their grain ration. 
VERTIGO.— 

CAUSES. — This dizzy, fitty condition of fowls is generally the result of 
high feeding on rich nutritious food, want of exercise, too much hot sun or 
worms. 

SYMPTOMS. — The chicken usually runs in a sort of circle with the head 
high and frequently falls down. 

TREATMENT. — As soon as possible apply ice water to the head or turn 
on a stream, of cold water. Give a cathartic such as a dessert spoonful of 
castor oil or a few grains of jalap or one-half dram of either sulphate of soda 
or sulphate of magnesia or two tablespooonfuls of sweet oil or raw linseed 
oil. Feed vegetables and keep in a cool place, also make the fowls exercise 
some every day. 
RHEUMATISM.— 

CAUSES. — ^This comes from eating too much lean meat, running in tall 
wet grass, being out in rainy weather too much and roosting in foul damp 
places. It also comes from eating too much sour acid-producing food. 

SYMPTOMS. — Shifting lameness is one of the most certain symptoms 
of rheumatic ailments. The foot or lower joints are most often affected. 

TREATMENT.— A removal of the cause is the first step that should be 
taken in the treatment of this ailment. Keep the fowls in a dry place, change 
their food and if the bowels are costive give one-third teaspoonful of epsom 
salts or Glauber's salts to open the bowels. Also give two grains of salicylate 
of soda or the same quantity of salicylic acid ; or, give either citrate or carbon- 
ate of potash in two-grain doses twice or three times a day. Apply equal parts 
of spirits of camphor, witch hazel and alcohol to the sore joints twice a day. 
SCALY LEGS.— 

CAUSES. — ^This ailment is the result of small parasites which burrow 
under the skin. It is a contagious disease ; therefore, should not be neglected. 

TREATMENT.— The coal-tar preparations applied full strength or 
kerosene applied to the legs every day or two will soon make them better. 
The diseased ones should be removed from the healthy and kept away until 
all the diseased poultry are cured. Apply kerosene about the hen coop and 
disinfect thoroughly or you will fail to stamp it out. It is a good plan to 
scrape and clean the legs thoroughly but, before doing so, soak the feet and 
legs in warm water and then scrape off the scales. Do not neglect to apply 
some kerosene to the legs occasionally, also some vaseline two or three times 



POULTRY DISEASES. 239 

a week until you are sure the fowls are free from disease. Washing the legs 
with soap and water, adding a tablespoonful of kerosene to each quart of suds, 
will keep the legs in good condition. 
PEOPLE'S HOME REMEDIES FOR SCALY LEGS.— 

1. Crude Oil. — Apply crude oil or blackstrap to the scaly legs. 

2. Kerosene and Lard. — Mix a teaspoonful of kerosene oil with two 
ounces of lard and apply thoroughly to the legs of the chickens affected. 
LEG WEAKNESS.— 

CAUSES. — It is not always an easy matter to tell what is causing leg 
weakness in poultry. However, inbreeding, close confinement, want of suffi- 
cient outdoor air and exercise and lack of proper food to nourish the body 
are among the causes. Young male fowls seem to be the ones mosc likely 
to become affected and the larger breeds appear to suffer most. This ailment 
is very often a result of some other sickness and I have known of debilitated 
fowls, that had become so from being lousy, to be treated for leg weakness. It 
is well to keep in mind that poultry should be fed a balanced ration from the 
time they are hatched. If not, they may become rickety and leg weak. 

SYMPTOMS.— The bird walks with difficulty, is inclined to stop and 
rest very often and in many cases is unable to stand at all. Strange to say, 
upon examination of the legs they are very often found free from pain or 
swelling. ' 

TREATMENT. — Be sure to examine for lice of all kinds before pre- 
scribing treatment and^ if possible, remove the cause for this may be the 
means of your success in making them well. To be successful in treating 
such an ailment you should first try hard to ascertain the cause. After a re- 
moval of the cause the symptoms will soon moderate and the fowl perhaps 
recover. Feed some meat, grain and vegetables ; also give five grains citrate 
of iron at a dose twice a day; or give some copperas and phosphate of lime 
in their feed twice daily. Give them lime water to drink or give some lime 
in their feed. The dose of copperas is six or eight grains and ten grains of 
phosphate of lime is a dose. However, neither are very poisonous and larger 
doses can be given. Lime is a very common remedy for leg weakness but it 
should be air-slacked before it is fed. One-quarter of a teaspoonful at a dose 
is enough and it should be given once or twice a day. Be sure to allow the 
chickens to exercise, and feed them some vegetables. 

WORMS. — Poultry that run on the same small lot year after year always 
get wormy and suffer from both round worms and tapeworms. It is true 
that many fowls do not have enough worms to interfere with their general 
health ; however, a great many chickens have enough to prevent their grow- 
ing as rapidly as they would if free from them. 

SYMPTOMS. — If a chicken has many worms it will seem dull, some- 
times purge, grow thin and lose condition, become uneasy and will not 
thrive. If the bowel movements are closely examined you will find the ex- 
crement contains many small worms and eggs. I suggest the use of your 
magnifying glass to determine whether the dung contains small worms, eggs 

or worm embryor , , . 

TREATMENT.— For the round worms give a teaspoonful of castor oil 
to which has been added five grains of powdered kamala and ten drops of 
turpentine. Or, give three grains sulphate of iron and ten grains ground gen- 
tian ; or, feed the fowls some pumpkin seeds or carrots either raw or cooked. 
I prefer to feed the carrots raw. Or, give santonine in doses of one, two, or 



230 THE PEOPLE'S HOME STOCK BOOK. 

even three grains to a large chicken, once a day on an empty crop. If you 
are sure any of your fowls have tapeworms, do not feed them for 15 or 20 
hours and then give five grains of powdered kamala, five drops oil male fern 
and eight drops turpentine in a teaspoonful of castor oil and it will be quite 
sure to bring the tapeworm away. 
DIARRHEA.— 

CAUSES. — ^This is caused by exposure to too much wet during cold 
weather, by filth, and by feeding on too much constipating food without 
exercise. It is also caused by eating early grass, roosting in damp places and 
is often the result of other ailments. 

TREATMENT. — Feed well cooked barley meal and add some ginger, 
catechu and prepared chalk. In order to check the excessive bowel dis- 
charges give four drops of tincture of opium, four drops of spirits of camphor 
and three drops of fluid extract of cinnamon, every six hours until the medi- 
cine seems to produce results. Put sulphate of iron in their drinking water. 
If the fowl is not too weak when taken sick, a teaspoonful of castor oil will 
do good. 
CHICKEN CHOLERA.— 

CAUSES. — This contagious disease is caused by a micro-organism and 
is perhaps produced by crowding poultry into filthy, damp, ill-ventilated 
quarters and by forcing them to live on dirty, filthy and unwholesome food. 

SYMPTOMS. — ^The fowl is always dull, dumpish and droopy. It has 
great thirst and walks slowly. The comb and wattles grow pale and lose 
freshness and the crop fills with gas, digestion ceases, diarrhea sets in and 
the passages are yellow and quite frequent. The breathing is quick and 
the eyes appear very dull and are partly closed and the fowl soon dies. 

TREATMENT. — The first step should be to remove the healthy from 
the sick and thoroughly disinfect the coop. Veterinarians and chicken raisers 
are not yet quite sure that a remedy has oeen found for cholera. I believe in 
burning all refuse and roosting poles. Then saturate the floor with one part 
of carbolic acid and ninety-nine parts of water daily for a few days. Also 
apply this to all the interior of the coop or whitewash with chloride of lime. 
Also use coal-tar disinfectant freely about the premises and continue to do so 
until you are certain that no infection remains. Should any fowl show any 
of the symptoms of cholera remove it at once. By doing so you will finally 
get rid of this disease. Many times thoroughness as to cleaning will prevent 
the disease spreading, so do not be slack in dealing with this highly con- 
tagious ailment. I have obtained good results by giving carbolic acid in small 
doses. Put one dram into one quart of water and give each fowl a teaspoon- 
ful at a dose two or three times a day. Or, give hypo-sulphite of soda and 
gentian. Put one and one-half ounces of hypo-sulphite of soda and three 
ounces of tincture of gentian into one quart of water and give one teaspoonful 
at a dose two or three times a day. > Another inexpensive remedy is made 
by dissolving two or three drams of sulphate of iron in a quart of water 
and giving a dessert spoonful to each full grown chicken two or three times 
a day. Keep your poultry strong by giving tonics such as gentian, cinchona 
and ginger in the feed twice a day.

2. Cholera Mixture.— ^Take one pound each of charcoal and sulphur. 



POULTRY DISEASES. 231 

one-half pound of copperas, ten grains of calomel and one grain of salicylic 
acid. Mix, and grind to a fine powder. The, dose is a tablespoonful for a 
dozen fowls. Give once a day in moist meal. 

3. Salt, Etc. — Mix plenty of salt with the feed. Also keep plenty 6i 
fresh water before them and keep their surrounding^ cjean. 

4r. Douglass Mixture. — Carefully mix an ounce of sulphuric acid with a 
gallon of water. In another gallon of water dissolve half a pound of cop- 
peras. Mix the two together and keep tightly corked. Put from two tea- 
spoonfuls to two tablespoonfuls into each quart of drinking water. This is 
a good tonic and a preventive and cure for cholera. 

5. Castor Oil and Carbolic Acid. — Into each gallon of drinking water 
put one-half teaspoonful of carbolic acid. Also give each chicken a teaspoon- 
ful of castor oil. 

6. Salts. — As a preventive put a teaspoonful of salts into each gallon 
of drinking water. 

7. Alum and Saltpeter. — Dissolve alum and saltpeter in the drinking 
water. Use equal parts of each. This is a preventive of chicken cholera. 

8. Carbolic Acid and Glycerine. — To a quart of water add a dram of 
carbolic acid and an ounce of glycerine and of this mixture use two table- 
spoonfuls to a gallon of drinking water. 

9. Onions and Ginger. — Put chopped onions and ginger in thi feed 
once a day for a week or so. 

BLACK HEAD— CONTAGIOtJS BOWEL AND LIVER DISEASE.- 

CAUSES. — This disease is caused by a micro-organism belonging to . 
family called the protozoa. These parasites are no doubt taken in with the 
food or water supply and upon reaching the two blind portions of the intes- 
tinal tract they halt and there multiply rapidly, setting up more or less 
inflammation and enlarging the bowels and liver. A thickening of the walls 
of the intestines takes place and the liver becomes covered with spots yellow 
in color. 

SYMPTOMS. — During the early part of the sickness the fowl appears 
■dull, hangs the head and some time later the bowels loosen and move too 
freely, then the bird begins to show unthriftiness. Young fowls are the 
most likely to suffer and the disease runs a slow course. Very often the comb 
loses its rich red color and turns dark, hence the name " black head." When 
opened after death, the liver is found to be too large and usually covered 
with grayish-yellow spots. The intestines are inflamed and their wall very 
thick. 

TREATMENT. — Very little can be done for turkeys or chickens when 
they suffer from black head more than to give tonics. Feed them well and 
give hypo-sulphite of soda in the drinking water; or, give copperas or 
gentian in the feed. When this disease finds its way into a flock of turkeys, 
dispose of them as soon as possible for the disease is not going to be easily 
checked. It is always a difficult task to get rid of this disease and if you 
fail, dispose of the whole flock and give up raising turkeys for not less than 
two years. Then you can pretty safely start over again.

1. Mustard. — Let out the contents of an egg through a small opening 
in the large end. Beat some strong mustard into the egg and refill the 
shell, pasting a piece of cloth over the opening. Place where the hens can 
get at it and after attempting to eat it they are very likely to think twice 
before trying to eat another egg. 

WHITE DIARRHEA. — White diarrhea in poultry is caused by a germ 
of low vitality which harbors in the caecum, or blind intestinal pouch, and sets 
up irritation and excessive bowel action causing great weakness and very 
often death. Chicks between two and six weeks old and even younger seem 
to be the ones generally affected. 

SYMPTOMS. — ^There is dullness, weakness, and loss of appetite accom- 
panied by a white, pasty fecal discharge. 

TREATMENT. — Treatment in such cases is by no means satisfactory 
for this ailment is not well understood; however, fairly good results follow 
giving small doses of castor oil, sweet oil or turpentine; or, dissolve five or 
ten grains of citrate of iron in each gallon of their drinking water. 

Prevention. — More can be accomplished in the line of prevention than by 
medication after the chick takes sick. Eggs used for hatching should be 
cleansed by washing them in a ninety-five per cent, solution of alcohol and 
if an incubator is used it should first be thoroughly disinfected. Formalde- 
hyde is the best disinfectant to use ; also expose the incubator to sunlight and 
fresh air or put in a heated oven. The egg trays should be thoroughly steril- 
ized as often as convenient. The brooders should also come in for their 
share of disinfection and sterilization; they should be kept scrupulously 
clean. It is also important to treat the ground that the chicks run on — this 
should be kept clean; it should be cultivated and lime mixed through the 
soil; furthermore, the land should be exposed to the sunlight. If hens are 



POULTRY— CAPONIZING. 233 

to hatch out the eggs their nests should be clean or composed of fresh straw 
or absorbent cotton with a little oakum or tar paper in the bottom. 

CAPONIZING. 

It is needless for me to say that caponizing cockerels, if done properly, 
will prove profitable to poultry raisers. The operation is by no means a difh- 
cult one to perform and it requires but a few lessons to teach any poultry 
raiser how to operate, but before attempting to do so secure a set of instru- 
ments suitable for doing the work and it will pay you well. 

Directions. — Select the cockerels you expect to operate on, place them in 
a dry clean place that has been disinfected, give them neither food nor water 
for thirty hours or feed them lightly for a day or two to have the bowels as 
empty as possible. Place the fowl on his left side, tie his legs with a tape or 
string, also tie the wings together and fasten to a 3-lb. weight or to table 
and the legs may also be tied to table ; this keeps the fowl in position during 
the operation. Clip off feathers just in front of the thigh joint; apply one 
part bichloride of mercury and one thousand parts water to the skin or use per- 
oxide of hydrogen or carbolic acid, one part to fifty of water. Make an 
incision not more than two inches nor less than one and one-half inches long 
between the last two ribs. Avoid cutting the intestines (if they are full you 
may do it occasionally). If the wound bleeds, halt a moment until it ceases. 
Use the spreader to keep the woimd open; pick up glistening lining with a 
hook ; cut or tear it open to get into the bird ; then you will plainly see one 
testicle lying close up to back and covered with a sort of film which can either 
be cut open or taken away with the testicle. Now slip the wire between the 
artery and testicle, making a loop ; and then cut off testicle. Then repeat 
the operation in removing the other testicle through the same opening. 
Understand, the loop is brought through a canula and the end of canula 
should be kept down close to the testicle when it is cut off. Caution. — 
Be sure to drop no dirt or pieces of feathers into the abdomen when operating ; 
. have clean instruments and hands when you operate and remem 5er that most 
deaths occur from hemorrhage. This is on account of cutting off an artery 
which lies just back of the testicle. I find that many poultry raisers do not 
use proper cleanliness when operating. I have never failed to teach farmers 
quickly how to caponize but it should be done only by showing them how 
«nd standing over them during their first operations.

sprouted and begin to heat. They should be sprinkled with water once a day 
and should always be kept covered with a blanket o^f old sack. It is best 
to grow them in a cellar. In the summer time use cold water and in the 
winter warm water. When they have become a mass of sprouts they shoiild 
be spread three or four inches thick in a box that has also had one or two 
half-inch holes bored in it. When in this box they should also be sprinkled 
and stirred each day. They make the best feed when the sprouts are from 
half an inch to an inch long. One bushel of good oats properly treated will 
make four or five bushels of sprouted or processed oats. In this way you 
not only get the full value of the nutriment in the oats but you also have a 
green food for winter use that will start the hens to laying quickly. Twice 
a day give the laying hens all they will eat. A teaspponful each of salt and 
cayenne pepper added to each pailful of oats will give excellent results. 
When the sprouts are half an inch long they make a fine chick food and 
may be given to chicks three times a day after they are a week old. This 
makes a good food for turkeys, ducks and geese as well as chickens. 



HOW TO MAKE MONEY ON CHICKENS. 

Rules and Suggestions Gathered from the Most Successful Poultry Raisers 

in the World. 

1. Use open-front hen houses or houses open on the south side and 
only protected by muslin curtains. Curtains to be dropped in zero weather 
only. 

3. Keep houses perfectly clean. Dropping boards to be cleaned at least 
once a week and floors as often as the litter becomes soiled or damp. 

3. At least twice a year whitewash the buildings thoroughly, using 
carbolic acid in the whitewash to keep away vermin. If this is done you will 
not be troubled with mites. 

4. To jet eggs in winter you must make the hens exercise. Do this 
by keeping \he floor well covered with from six to twelve inches of clean, 
dry straw in which scatter the morning and evening feed, thus making them 
work for what they get to eat. 

5. Feed all the hens will eat, twice a day. Feed a balanced ration, 
giving wheat, oats and barley in equal portions and in the summer add an 
equal portion of corn but in the winter add three times as much corn. The 
proportions may be varied to suit t!.e inclination of the fowls. 

6. You cannot expect many eggs in the winter unless you give plenty 
of green food. Sliced beets are gogd, also keep the feeding rack full of short 
cut clover. The hens are fond of clover and you can depend on its produc- 
ing eggs. Sprinkle the clover with water and let it stand a day before feeding. 

7. A good and inexpensive green food is made by sprouting oats. You 
thus get a good green food for winter use .at a cost of about ten cents per 
bushel. Directions for making these sprouted or processed oats are given 
elsewhere. 

8. Keep beef scrap, oyster shell, and grit constantly before the hens. 
Keep these in hoppers to avoid waste. 

9. Keep fresh, clean, drinking water before the fowls all the time. Clean 
the water dishes every day= 



VALUABLE POULTRY SECRETS. 235 

10. Avoid disease by the free use of disinfectants, such as carbolic acid 
and formaldehyde. 

11. Keep a box of clean, dry dust in a sunny corner of the poultry house. 
This is important. 

12. Do not over-crowd the hens and do not keep too many in one 
building. 

13. Hens do best in flocks of not more than fifty. 

14. Allow one cock for every twelve or fifteen hens in the breeding pens. 
No cocks in the laying pens. 

15. Allow plenty of fresh air at all times but do not have drafts. 

16. Keep the hens free from lice. 

17. In the summer the chickens should have free range. If this is im- 
possible they should be supplied with plenty of green food. 

18. For breeding purposes use only your best and healthiest stock. 

19. If you want to breed for the best egg production, get trap nests 
and keep a record of each hen and breed only from the hens that show the 
greatest yearly production of eggs. 

30. In the poultry business it is attention to details that counts. Ob- 
serve regularity in feeding, cleaning, and filling the hoppers and look after 
the comfort of the hens at all times. 

21. One breed well cared for will pay better than too many breeds. 

23. If you feed a mash do so in the morning but do not feed enough to 
keep them from exercising. Many poultry raisers give dry feed exclusively. 



HOUSEHOLD PETS., 



DOGS, 

FEEDING DOGS. — In feeding dogs there seem to be many wrong 
opinions and numerous ancient traditions are being followed that are far from 
right. I even know people who believe it dangerous to give a pup several 
months old a piece of meat, holding fast to the belief that the dog should have 
no meat until he has lived twelve months or more. Meat is not harmful 
to pups after they are three or four months old, but of course the meat should 
be well cooked and fed in small quantities and mixed with other things in 
order to balance the ration. After the pup is weaned table scraps or puppy 
biscuits with plenty of milk seem to grow them evenly. Pups should be fed 
twice daily; aged dogs once. Meat, vegetables, cereals and milk is a proper 
ration. Well cooked meat mixed with rice or corn meal mush makes a good 
dog food. The food-holding utensils should be scalded with hot water once 
a day. Feed the house dog his hearty meal in the early part of the day. 

CANINE DISTEMPER.— This disease has existed for nearly a thousand 
years and has always been considered a dangerous ailment in young pups, 
but not nearly so fatal to dogs more than a year old. The contagion is 
contained in the discharge from the nose and eyes and in the blood. Dis- 
temper is a contagious infective disease. The true nature of this ailment 
has not yet been positively denionstrated ; however, the contagion is no 
doubt both fixed and volatile. It is transmitted by co-habitation, by in- 
oculation and perhaps taken from the air in breathing. Old dogs seldom 
suffer from canine distemper. Weak, delicate dogs or those kept in-doors 
are easily infected. 

SYMPTOMS. — The symptoms of distemper vary greatly. The mucous 
membrane of the nostrils, eyes, air passages and digestive organs are inflamed. 
The brain and spinal cord may be affected. The dog shivers and has fever; 
the coat is dry, the eyes discharge and ulcers sometimes appear on the eye- 
ball. The dog_ coughs, loses his appetite, is thirsty, vomits and the bowels 
are either costive or too loose. It is not unusual for pneumonia to follow 
distemper. 

TREATMENT. — It is quite difficult to lay down any particular line of 
treatment for there are so many different forms of distemper; therefore, 
I will say quinine is a useful remedy and small doses of beech wood creo- 
sote is another good remedy. If feverish, give acetanilide. Cod liver oil, 
raw eggs, alcoholic stimulants and nutritious, easily-digested food help all 
cases of distemper. When complications arise they must be met with a 
proper remedy. When sick, keep the dog warm, dry and comfortable. 

MANGE.— There are two kinds of mange in the dog— the follicular and 
sarcoptic. Follicular mange is not easily cured as the parasites are down 
in the hair follicles but this variety is not nearly so contagious on this 



HOUSEHOLD PETS— DOGS. 237 

account. Sarcoptic mange is the most common variety and is very con- 
tagious. Man can contract this disease but is in less danger than other 
animals and thin skinned dogs seem to be the most easily diseased. 

SYMPTOMS. — The symptoms of follicular mange are redness of the 
skin and shedding of the hair, but at first there is no irritation of the skin that 
can be seen. Some time later, and not always very soon, little pustules 
appear which, if squeezed, exude a purulent sort of fluid. If this fluid is 
placed under a microscope a great many flat, fish-like parasites with short legs 
on either side can be seen. In the later stages the dog is uneasy and scratches 
and rubs constantly, the body becoming covered with sores and the animal 
losing flesh and giving off a very offensive odor. In sarcoptic mange the dis- 
ease usually commences under the arm or where the skin is thin, causing 
great itching and scratching which are followed by sores that are slow to 
heal. If the dog is neglected and the disease not checked, the sores soon 
cover the whole body and most of the hair falls out. In many cases the dis- 
ease spreads rapidly over the whole body, causing great irritation which is 
followed with emaciation and if nothing is done to kill the parasites the dog 
soon dies from weakness. It is well to keep in mind that both kinds of 
mange may be communicated to man, especially sarcoptic mange. 

TREATMENT. — First of all the dog should be clipped and thoroughly 
washed with soap and water and dried; then apply equal parts storax and 
raw linseed oil; or one-half part carbonate potash, one part sulphur and 
five parts lai-d; or one part coal-tar disinfectant and four parts vaseline; use 
any of these remedies daily for a few days. If the whole body is dis- 
eased put medicine on only a part each day, for fear of its injuring the dog. 
Remember that carbolic acid and many other irritating drugs should never be 
put on dogs. 

RINGWORM. — This is a very common ailment in dogs and Is caused 
by a parasite that belongs to the vegetable kingdom and the disease is called 
ringworm on account of the parasites grouping and working in patches of 
' a somewhat round shape. Ringworm is readily communicated from one ani- 
mal to another and it is also communicated from animals to man ; however, 
these parasites do not care to reside on man nearly so well as animals, and 
I* have known cases where they seem to die off in a month or two without 
much being done to kill them. 

SYMPTOMS. — An eruption is noticed on one or more parts of the body 
and is more likely to be about the head, neck and loins than- any other part 
of the body. The hair soon drops out in circular sort of patches and by using 
a magnifying glass the surface of the skin will be found rough and a fluid 
oozing out. In many cases the disease is confined to a small area and never 
spreads much while in others it extends pretty much over the body. 

TREATMENT. — First wash the parts with soap and water and apply 
either iodide ointment or tincture of iodine a few times ; then apply one part 
Sulphur and six parts lard, or any good home mange remedy. 

LICE.— Lice are the result of keeping animals in a filthy condition and 
not feeding them properly. Their presence is easily observed by inspection 
which is aided materially by the use of a magnifying glass. 

TREATMENT.— A rough-coated dog should be clipped, for by doing so 
much less medicine will be required to kill the lice. One of the most satis- 
factory lies killing remedies is made by mixing five ounces of crushed staves- 



238 THE PEOPLE'S HOME STOCK BOOK. 

acre seeds in a gallon of boiling water and allowing it to simmer an houi 
or two and then straining through a cheese cloth and filling to original quan. 
tity. Apply three times a week. Or, apply one part coal-tar disinfectant 
and thirty parts water; or, apply one part powdered stavesacre seeds and five 
or six parts lard; or, a small quantity of mercurial ointment placed on the 
■ body where he cannot lick it off acts well. 

FLEAS. — During the dry summer months nearly every dog is troubled 
more or less with fleas and if kept on sandy soil or bedded with sawdust 
or straw they are very likely to have them. Fleas irritate and annoy dogs 
very much and there is little use of driving them off the dog or killing them 
unless they arc driven out of the kennel. 

TREATMENT. — To kill fleas soak one-fourth pound crushed stavesacre 
seeds in a gallon of hot water for three or four hours, strain and apply once 
a day. Or, apply insect powder. Apply cologne or a weak solution of coal- 
tar disinfectant ; also, dust on some flowers of sulphur along the back. The 
kennel should be disinfected and kept clean. 

WORMS. — -Nearly all dogs have a few worms and tapeworm is a. com- 
mon ailment, but they may not have enough to do any particular harm, 
Worms do not always remain in the bowels but find their way into the 
stomach. 

SYMPTOMS. — There is a change in disposition, an excessive appetitt< 
loss of flesh, itchy skin, rough staring coat or loss of hair, bowel pain, in- 
digestion, occasional vomiting or scouring, fetid breath and a disposition 
to lick the anus and drag the hind parts along the ground. Wormy dogs 
usually show an irritable temper and frequently suffer from vertigo or con- 
vulsions. 

TREATMENT. — For round worms in dogs, areca nut and spigelia are 
reliable remedies ; or, giving fluid extract of spigelia and fluid extract of senna 
every morning for three or four days will usually ,rid a dog of round worms. 
The dose of powdered areca nut is about two grains for each pound of the 
dog's weight and it is convenient to give it in some milk. The dose of 
fluid extact of senna for a matured dog is from twenty drops to two drams, 
according to weight, and for young pups one drop for each week of age. This 
medicine should be combined with a brisk cathartic, such as senna or castor 
oil. Santonine is another useful remedy; for pups give from one-fifth to 
three grains, combined with a small dose of calomel. For matured dogs I 
usually give from six to twenty-five grains at a dose. Powdered kamala is 
another useful remedy or the powdered male fern or the oleoresin of male fern 
will be effective. 

PNEUMONIA — LUNG FEVER — INFLAMMATION OF THE 
LUNGS. — This disease is generally the result of neglected cold, catarrh or 
chilling when in a heated state ; or, it is due to exposure or housing in damp, 
badly ventilated basements or kennels. 

TREATMENT. — Give the dog good care ; keep him in a well ventilated 
place and reduce the fever by giving small doses of aconite, acetanilide or 
nitrate of potash. Apply antiphlogistine or mustard to sides ; also give quinine 
and other tonics and stimulants. The treatment should be much the same as 
in man or the horse. 

OPHTHALMIA— INFLAMMATION OF THE EYES.— This disease 
is the result of a great many exciting causes and tVie result of other diseases. 
Dust and other irritants blowing into the eyes is the most common cause. 



HOUSEHOLD PETS— DOGS. 339 

TREATMENT. — Avoid keeping the dog in a place where the light is 
too bright. Apply equal parts of extract of witch hazel and water or dis- 
solve boric acid in water — all the water will take up— or dissolve three grains 
of sulphate of zinc and one grain of atropine in one ounce of water. Eye 
lotions should be applied three or four times daily. 

WARTS. — Warts should either be cut off or burned with caustic such 
as lunar caustic, chromic acid or acetic acid. 

TUMORS. — Small tumors often appear in the corner of the eye or on 
different parts of the body and when they dp they should be cut out and 
boric acid applied or any non-poisonous home-made healing lotion will do. 

WOUNDS. — Wounds on dogs should be stitched the same as in other 
animals, but the healing remedies applied should be non-poisonous, such 
as peroxide-hydrogen, boric acid or coal-tar disinfectant. 

CANKER OF THE EAR.— Canker is a diseased condition of the inner 
surface of the ear. 

SYMPTOMS. — The dog shakes his head and paws the ear. If but one 
ear is affected the head is carried to one side. The inner surface of ear 
looks red, is swollen, inflamed and gives off an offensive odor. 

TREATMENT. — Discontinue feeding meat and stimulating food. Ap- 
ply one part peroxide of hydrogen and four parts of water and ten minutes 
later dust on boric acid ; or, apply one part calomel, three parts oxide of zinc 
and twelve parts boric acid to the sore parts once a day. 

COLIC. — Colic is usually the result of exhaustion, exposure to cold 
and wet, eating a hearty meal after fasting or eating infected and unwhole- 
some food. 

TREATMENT. — Give one-half teaspoonful of ginger and a teaspoonful 
of whiskey or from five to twenty-five drops of laudanum or some pepper- 
mint or anv home colic remedy. 

INFLAMMATION OF THE BOVVELS.— This comes on from expo- 
sure of the body to too much cold when in a heated condition or from eating 
certain poisons or swallowing sponges, rags or foreign bodies that obstruct 
the bowels. 

TREATMENT. — Always try moving the bowels with sweet oil or cas- 
tor oil or perhaps linseed oil ; also apply hot packs, poultices or weak mustard 
water. Give laudanum to relieve the pain, also give injections of soap and 
water to move the bowels. 

COUGH. — Dogs are subject to coughs which are the result of exposure 
to wet and cold or of sleeping in damp, badly ventilated basements or cellars. 

TREATMENT. — Give from three to ten grains of iodide of potassium 
and from three to ten drops of laudanum at a dose three times a day, or give 
any good home cough remedy. 

PARTURITION — PUPPING. — This generally occurs between the sixty- 
first and sixty-sixth days after service and if the bitch is not too fleshy, has 
r)een exercised regularly while pregnant, and the bowels are not too costive, 
she will whelp without assistance. When a bitch is unable to whelp and re- 
quires help, I generally give an anaesthetic, using ether as it is not dangerous. 
I seldom give chloroform in such cases. Instruments should be used with 
care. Many times the fingers can be usfed and of course this is safer than 
using instruments. Be sure to remove the afterbirth and wash out the uterus 
with a weak antiseptic or astringent for a few days. 

HERNIA— RUPTURE.— We meet with umbilical, abdominal and in- 



240 ' THE PEOPLE'S HOME STOCK BOOK. 

guinal hernia most often in dogs and cats. The most common causes are 
accidents and injuries. Nearly all cases require surgical treatment. The work 
.should be done by a person who has had experience and uses cleanliness. 
The operation is not dangerous. 

CASTRATION. — Dogs are castrated to prevent them from wandering 
away from home. Wash the scrotum with an antiseptic of some kind ; give 
them ether and then make a bold incision, exposing the testicle; then twist 
the cord a few times, scraping cord through, or apply traction to the cord 
until it gives way. This last method I do not like so well. In old dogs I 
very often use an emasculator, clamp and iron, or apply an aseptic ligature. 
Be sure to use clean instruments and have clean hands. 

SPAYING. — ^This is an operation that is done to prevent bitches from 
coming in heat and to prevent breeding. Ether is given, the belly shaved and 
the abdomen opened in the flank or center of the belly. The ovaries are 
found and twisted off and the wound stitched. The stitches should be re- 
moved on the fourth day and in a few days she will be well. The operation 
is performed with less risk if she is not in heat; however, it can be done 
when in heat and the bitch live. Apply peroxide of hydrogen to wound, also 
use boric acid. 

FRACTURES OR BROKEN BONES.— Dogs are very liable to meet 
with fractures of the toes, legs, hip and back. These should be treated the 
same as fracture in other animals. Give the dog ether as an anaesthetic, 
crowd the bones into position and apply a plaster bandage, starch bandage, 
or adhesive plaster bandage; or, an ordinary bandage will often answer the 
purpose. A fracture requires four or five weeks to unite properly. 

CHOREA. — ^This is a nervous ailment which frequently follows canine 
distemper, other debilitating fever or injury. The symptoms consist in a 
twitching and quick jerking condition of certain muscles of different parts 
of the body. When the disease becomes chronic it is painless. 

TREATMENT. — Keep the dog warm and give him good care. This is 
about all that can be done. Mild cases sometimes recover; severe ones 
never do. 

WORMS IN THE KIDNEYS.— Small thread-like worms measuring 
from twelve to thirty-six inches grow and develop in the kidney. They 
attain considerable size, destroy the function of the kidney and later make 
their way into the abdominal cavity. The only treatment that gives any 
results is ten or fifteen drops of turpentine at a dose, daily; however, I am 
inclined to believe there is no positive remedy. 

GONORRHEA. — Dogs are seldom troubled with infectious gonorrhea, 
but sometimes have gleet, attended with a mucous discharge. 

TREATMENT. — Bathe the parts with warm water twice a day. Dis- 
solve one dram of sugar of lead in a pint of water and apply twice a day, or 
dissolve one-fourth dram of permanganate of potash in a pint or two of water 
and apply this. There are many other remedies that are used in human prac- 
tice that are equally as good for an ailment of this kind. Give five drops 
oil of sandal wood at a dose twice daily. 

RABIES— HYDROPHOBIA.-^Rabies is an infectious disease and can 
be produced only by inoculation with the specific virus which causes if 
however, an opposite opinion is held by some people, believing that the dis- 
ease can arise spontaneously. Its being difficult to trace the origin of infection 



HOUSEHOLD PETS— CATS. 241 

» what !eads people to hold the latter opinion. Rabies has existed for more 
than two thousand years. It is an incurable ailment, but both man and 
animals can be immunized. The virus of rabies is contained in the saliva, 
blood and body. 

SYMPTOMS. — The animal becomes restless, dull and watchful and with- 
draws from his companions, hiding in dark corners, below chairs and other 
furniture. He becomes nervous, lying down and jumping up again in an 
excited, unnatural manner. He has a tendency to rove about and if possible 
will escape and wander away. At first the dog's power of recognizing people 
is not lost; he is inclined to lick things that are cold and will pick at bits of 
wood and coal and swallow stones and as the disease advances his movements 
become somewhat unsteady. Sometimes he will stare at an imaginary object, 
then rush forward and bite anything that may be in his way, or even at the 
air as if he were catching flies. The appetite is lost. The thirst is con- 
siderable but he is unable to swallow. His bark changes to a howl, he 
occasionally vomits, the jaws drops, saliva runs from the mouth and the 
tongue swells and grows black. The bite of a mad dog is less liable to infect 
man than other animals. 

CATS. 

GENERAL SYMPTOMS OF DISEASE IN CATS.— Whenever a cat 
becomes sick or ailing from disease or injury, it usually loses its appetite and 
hides out of sight and the nose becomes hot and the coat dry. The cat often 
moves about as if in pain and if not, sleeps almost continually. When they 
have stomach trouble they are inclined to eat grass; this produces an irrita- 
tion of the stomach, resulting in either vomiting or purging or both. Grass 
acts much the same as Glauber's salts or castor oil given in small doses to 
children. Mixing some flowers of sulphur or baking soda in their drinking 
water seems to help sick cats. Cats are often troubled with colds, coughs, 
sore throat and bronchial and lung diseases. They have liver, stomach and 
intestinal diseases; fever, infectious distemper; also glanders, eczema and 
local diseases of the eyes, teeth and claws; also parasitic diseases such as 
mange, fleas and worms. 

CATARRH— COLD IN THE HEAD.— This consists in an inflammation 
of the mucous membrane lining the nose, throat and head. The symptoms 
are sneezing and coughing with fever in most cases. The treatment consists 
in good care and gj ring home remedies such as are used in human practice 
and for dogs. 

BRONCHITIS. — Bronchitis is an inflammation of the tubes that lead 
to the lungs and the treatment consists in keeping the cat out of drafts, dust, 
cold rain storms and out of wet basements and medicating with the remedies 
used for children and dogs. Most cases need no drugs. When the cat is sick 
it hides away in a sheltered place and soon recovers. 

PNEUMONIA. — Pneumonia is attended with more fever than bronchitis ; 
however, in cats the two ailments generally occur_ together as we seldom have 
lung fever alone in cats. In many cases parasites are lodged in the lung 
tissue. 

TREATMENT. — Give the cat good care and pure air to breathe. Keep 
it eating by tempting it with diflferent kinds of food. Apply poultices, give 

3-16 



343 THE PEOPLE'S HOME STOCK BOOK. 

whiskey and small doses of quinine, also home medical remedies that are 
prescribed for broncho-pneumonia in horses and for man. 

GASTRITIS. — Gastritis is an inflammation of the stomach, generally 
brought on by feeding too often and too much at a time, or by feeding ir- 
ritating food or giving drugs that burn the inner wall of the stomach ; but 
it may be a secondary or constitutional disease and not the result of gorging 
the stomach. The symptoms are : vomiting up food, frothy mucus and some- 
times blood. 

TREATMENT. — When the cat is left to follow his own instinct he eats 
grass which acts as an emetic or cathartic and if it does not act thus, give 
him a cathartic of Glauber's salts and if the vomiting continues give hot 
black coffee, and if he has much pain give small doses of chloretone or 
paregoric. 

CONSTIPATION.— This is an ailment the cat is pretty free from but 
when it does occur give castor oil, sweet oil or jalap. 

DIARRHEA. — This is a very common ailment in house cats, brought 
on by eating out of dirty dishes and eating infected food. Feeding irregularly 
and too much fat meat also bring on looseness of the bowels. Liver and 
vegetables when fed to cats open their bowels. 

TREATMENT. — All the remedies that are prescribed for bowel ail- 
ments in man are suitable for cats. A small dose of sweet oil or castor oil 
should first be given to ckar the bowels and if the pain is great give laudanum. 

YELLOWS— JAUNDICE.— When the mucous membrane of the eye is 
yellow the liver is perhaps congested or the bile is not passing out of the 
body by its natural channel. The liver may contain parasites or may be in- 
active or enlarged. When the bowels are costive give small doses of calomel 
and castor oil or Glauber's salts and regulate the cat's diet. 

TUBERCULOSIS.— Cats very seldom suffer from tuberculosis and, in 
fact, it is a very difficult task to inoculate the cat so as to produce the dis- 
ease. . I very often examine cats after death to satisfy people who insist 
that their cat had consumption but generally find they were mistaken. 

DISTEMPER. — Distemper is a contagiouF and infectious disease affect- 
ing cats. Associated with this ailment various organs of the body may be 
inflamed and the cat always has fever. The symptoms are: a watery dis- 
charge from the nose and eyes, gradually growing thicker ; fever ; some cough- 
ing and quick breathing. The throat, bowels and lungs may become affected. 

TREATMENT. — Keep the sick animal away from healthy cats. Be sure 
the cat has fresh air but is kept warm and in no draft. If the bowels are con- 
stipated, give a laxative but never give a cathartic for it may produce death. 
Give some baking soda in milk or some hot black coffee and if the cat grows 
cold give whiskey in twent^-five-drop doses every three hours. When lung 
or bowel complications set in treat them as in man. 

GLANDERS. — This is a constitutional disease accompanied by the forma- 
tion of tubercles on the body and in the nose on the mucous membrane. 
These tubercles break and form ulcers. The lungs and liver are sometimes 
affected as well as other vital organs of the body. Lions take glanders from 
eating horse meat cut from the carcass of glandered horses. This is not 
by any means a common ailment in cats unless fed meat from glandered 
horses. 

ECZEMA. — ^This is a skin disease, due perhaps to errors in feeding and 
care of the skin. It consists of a hyperemia of the skin followed by an oozing 



HOUSEHOLD PETS— CATS. ;343 

through of a fluid which seems to dry, forming scales and leaving the skin 
rough. The face, back and legs are most commonly affected. 

TREATMENT. — Give three grains baking soda in food three times a 
day and dissolve one ounce of baking soda in one quart of water and apply 
to the sore parts three times a day, or use a home eczema cure prescribed 
for man. Change the feed; give less meat, no sweet cakes or candy, no 
butter or greasy gravy and keep the cat in a cool place. 

CANKER OF THE EAR.— This is one form of eczema and the same line 
of diet prescribed for eczema should be followed; also apply one part per- 
oxide of hydrogen and four parts water, then apply boric acid a few minutes 
later. Do this twice daily. Give two-drop doses of Fowler's solution twice 
a day. Also give one-grain doses of iodide of potassium daily. 

MILK FEVER. — Taking away all the kittens immediately after birth 
very often causes the udder to cake and inflame, which of course, is followed 
with fever ; besides, wounds on the belly may also cause the udder to inflame. 

TREATMENT. — Apply one part extract of Phytolacca and eight parts 
vaseline to udder twice a day and give two drops of fluid extract of Phytolacca 
root at a dose three times a day, or give two grains of nitrate of potash three 
times a day. 

FITS— CONVULSIONS.— Fits and convulsions are generally due to 
some kind of digestive disturbance or irritation, the ingestion of irritating 
food, overloading the stomach in hot weather and to stomach worms. It 
is more common in young than old cats. 

TREATMENT. — Give a cathartic of either syrup of buckthorn or castor 
oil and wrap the cat in a hot blanket or drop it in warm water, all but the 
head. Give two grains of bromide of potash four times a day. 

EPILEPSY. — Epilepsy develops suddenly. The cat falls down and froths 
at the mouth. The greatest difference between this ailment and convulsions is 
the absence of delirium. Do not frighten the cat. Give laudanum or chloral 
hydrate to quite the animal, also give syrup of buckthorn to move the bowels. 
Feed a good quality of easily digested food and not too much of it, also ex- 
ercise the animal. 

FLEAS. — Fleas do not as a rule bother cats and if the same flea gets 
on a person it does not remain. They are easily gotten rid of by applying 
cologne, tobacco snuff, flowers of sulphur or Persian insect powder. Apply 
not only on the cat, but also in its basket or sleeping places. 

SARCOPTIC MANGE. — The most common kind of mange affecting 
cats is sarcoptic mange and it is due to a small parasite which burrows under 
the skin and multiplies rapidly, causing intense itching. 

TREATMENT. — One of the most effectual and least expensive remedies 
is made by mixing one-half a part of carbonate of potash, one part sulphur 
and six parts fresh lard. Apply it daily for a few days and then as often 
as necessary. There are many other remedies that will cure mange but 
select the least irritating. 

FOLLICULAR MANGE. — Follicular mange is a kind that is not easily 
cured. It affects the nose, skin of the chiri, and claws. This insect is hard 
to kill but if the cat will allow air-tight, non-irritating balsams to remain 
on long enough to smother the insects, a cure will be effected. Light applica- 
tions of mercurial ointment or sulphur ointment applied freely will help 
effect a cure. 



244 THE PEOPLE'S HOME STOCK BOOK. 

STOMACH WORMS. — Stomach worms are not only found in the stom- 
ach but also in the intestines and are three or four inches in length and the 
size of a slate pencil, the female being the longest. 

TREATMENT. — Purge the cat with castor oil, then give three grains 
of santonine^ one hour later give three drops of turpentine in a small dose 
of castor oil. 

TAPEWORM. — ^The tapeworm is from four to thirty inches long and 
lives in the small bowel with its head fastened to the mucous membrane of 
the bowel while the rest of the body floats in the intestines. 

TREATMENT. — Starve the cat for thirty hours, then mix twenty grains 
of powdered areca nut or fifteen grains of pondered kamala, or three grains 
of santonine in milk, which a hungry cat will drink. Two hours later give 
a large dose of castor oil and you may be able to dislodge the worm. Be 
sure the head comes away and it should then be killed. 

RINGWORM. — This disease appears in the form of round bald patches 
which soon get sore. It is caused by a vegetable parasite. 

TREATMENT. — Apply some mercurial ointment or paint the patches 
with tincture of iodine as soon as noticed and be sure to keep the cat away 
from children for people are very often diseased by coming in contact with 
cats that have ringworm. 

TRICHINA. — Although it is difficult to make a correct diagnosis when 
cats suffer from trichina, yet many of them have it. I have known many 
cats to die from it that were treated for rheumatism. 

EYE DISEASES. — In distemper and fevers cats have more or less eye 
trouble and in the treatment of these ailments good results follow bathing the 
eyes with hot water. Keep the cat in a dark room and feed cooling, laxative 
food. Apply one part extract witch hazel and three parts water; or dissolve 
boric acid in water, all the water will take up ; or apply calomel to clear the 
eye and give small doses of calomel or iodide of potassium. 

THE TEETH.— Frequently the young kitten has 26 teeth which are re- 
placed by 30 permanent teeth when the cat is about six months old. The 
growing cat has trouble teething and may not do well. Old cats may have 
diseased teeth that should be extracted and the tartar should be broken off 
the teeth when it affects the gums. When the mouth is sore use mouth washes 
that are used for people. 

THE CLAWS. — ^The claws often require cutting and, if trimmed, the 
house cat will prove much less destructive than with sharp nails. Nails often 
break and when they do they should be trimmed smooth. 

POISONING. — It is not uncommon for the house cat or even the farm 
cat to get hold of rat poison which is generally composed of arsenic; or, 
some malicious person may give your cat strychnine. If poisoned with 
arsenic, give mustard and water or Glauber's salts to cause vomiting and if 
strychnine caused the poisoning give twenty grains of chloral hydrate and 
repeat the dose if necessary to control the spasms. 

■ GIVING A CAT MEDICINES.— If possible give it in food ; or, wrap 
him in a shawl and pour it down but avoid giving it in large quantities. 

CASTRATING CATS.— Wrap the cat in a rubber cloth or shawl and 
leave the hind quarters out; clean the scrotum first; then open and remove 
the testicle by cutting off the cord or twisting it off, which stops bleeding. 
No after care is required except to keep the cat clean and warm. 



HOUSEHOLD PETS— CATS. 245 

SPAYING. — This is done to prevent females from breeding. I operate 
on one hundred or more every year by first giving the cat a small dose 
of morphine, hypodermically, then giving ether. Shave the abdomen and 
wash it, cut into the abdomen, remove ovaries, stitch wound, then keep 
cat quiet. Remove the stitches on the fourth day and the wound is gen- 
erally healed in a week or less. Never give a cat chloroform unless you want 
to kill it. It is not alway necessary to give morphine before giving ether 
but I very often do give it to old cats and dogs. 



USEFUL STABLE DRUGS. 

Their Uses and Doses. 



Acetanilile. — ^Used in febrile diseases. Doses: Horses, 1 to 3 drams; cattle 
8 to 4 drams; sheep, % dram. Repeat every few hours. 

Acetic Acid. — Used to remove warts and other kinds of gr.owths. 

Aconite. — Used to reduce fever. Doses: Horses, 30 to 50 drops or 
more ; cattle, 1 to 2 drams ; sheep and pigs, 10 to 20 drops. Tincture of aconite 
is now made weaker than formerly. 

Alcohol. — Alcohol is perhaps the most useful of all drugs in the treatment 
of live stock. It acts as a cerebral excitant, is a stimulant and increases func- 
tional activity of all organs. Doses: From one to three ounces and it acts 
best when given with ether, digitalis or aromatic spirits of ammonia. 

Aloes. — Aloes is the common cathartic for horses and mules. Barbadoes 
aloes is the most reliable. The dose for horses is from 3 drams to 10 drams', 
given in combination with calomel and ginger in ball form or dissolved in 
water and given as a drench. 

Aliun. — Alun^ is quite a useful drug in veterinary practice, being useful 
in healing lotions and drying powders. Doses: Horses, 1 to 3 drams; 
cattle, 2 to 4 drams ; sheep and pigs, 10 to 35 grains. Dried alum, commonly 
known as burnt alum, is deprived of its water and acts more like a caustic. 
When applied to wounds it acts as a powerful drying drug. 

Areca Nut. — Areca nut is a vermicide, especially for dogs. Doses: 3 
to 10 grains for small dogs and from 20 grains to 2 drams or even more for 
large ones; or, give 1 to 3 grains for each pound the dog weighs. 

Ammonia (Aqua Ammonia). — Doses: Horses, 1 to 2 drams; cattle, 2 to 
4 drams ; sheep and pigs, 14 to 1 dram. Aromatic spirits of ammonia — Doses: 
Horses, 1 to 1^^ ounces ; cattle, 1 to 31/2 ounces ; sheep and pigs, 1 to 2 drams ; 
dogs, 5 to 40 drops. Carbonate of Ammonia — Doses: Horses, 1 to 2 drams; 
cattle, 1 to 4 drams ; sheep and hogs, 10 to 35 grains ; dogs, 1 to 6 grains. 

Arnica. — Arnica tincture is most used. Doses: Horses, 1 to 4 drams; 
cattle, y2 ounce to 2 ounces ; dogs, 5 to 20 drops. It is prescribed for bruises 
and sprains. 

Arsenic. — Doses : 1 to 6 grains for horses ; 3 to 9 grains for cattle ; 1 to 
2 grains for sheep and hogs ; 1/50 to 1/8 of a grain for dogs. Arsenic should 
be well diluted when given to animals. Fowler's solution is a convenient prep- 
aration of arsenic to keep on hand. Doses : Horses, 1 dram to 1 ounce ; cattle, 
2 drams to 1% ounces; sheep and pigs, 10 to 40 drops; dogs, 1 to 8 drops. 
Each ounce contains between four and five grains of arsenic. 

Belladonna. — Fluid extract of belladonna root is the preparation gener- 
ally used. Doses; Horses, % to 1 dram ; cattle, 1 to 3 drams; sheep 15 to 30 
drops 5 pigs, 3 to 10 drops; dogs, 1^ to 3 drops. 

246 



•JSEFUL STABLE DRUGS. 247 

Buchu. — The dose of powdered leaves and fluid extract is about the same. 
Doses : Horses, % to 1% ounces ; cattle, 1 to 2 ounces ; sheep and hogs, % to 
1% drams; dogs, 10 to 50 drops. 

Borax. — Borax is used as an antiseptic, astringent and parasite killer,' 
mostly for mouth or skin ailments. Dissolve one ounce or more in a quart ot 
water and apply two or three times a day. 

Boric Acid. — Dose for horses and cattle from 1 to 4 drams; sheep and 
hogs, 1/^ dram; dogs, 3 to 15 grains. This also makes an excellent dressing 
for wounds and for eye ailments. 

Bismuth. — Bismuth is used to allay irritation in dyspepsia, to arrest 
vomiting and to correct catarrhal ailments of the bowels. It is also used 
extensively to correct itching skin diseases in dogs and is usually combined 
with wool-fat. Doses: Horses, 1 to 4 drams; cattle, 2 to 6 drams; sheep 
and hogs, y% dram ; dogs, 3 to 25 grains. 

Bromide of Potash. — Doses : Horses, from l^ to 2 ounces ; sheep and pigs. 
1 to 3 drams; dogs, 5 to 50 grains. It should always be dissolved in warm 
water when giving it. 

Black Haw. — This is given to prevent abortion and to stimulate the urin- 
ary arid generative organs. Dose of fluid extract for mares is 1 to 3 ounces ; 
cows, 3 to 4 ounces ; sheep and hogs, a teaspoonful ; bitches, fifteen drops to 
114 drams. Mares and cows that abort annually should be treated with small 
doses two or three times a day, but in acute cases give a large dose and it will 
often prevent a miscarriage. 

Calomel. — Doses : Horses, i/4 to 1 dram ; cattle, % dram to 3 drams ; sheep 
and hogs, 3 to 15 grains. As a purgative it should be given with cooking 
soda. It is a specific for thrush and dries up wounds. It is also used to clear 
opacity of the eye. 

Copperas. — Copperas or Sulphate of Iron is one of the least expensive and 
most useful preparations of iron, although there are many. Doses: Horses, 
y^ to 31/^ drams ; cattle, 2 to 3 drams ; sheep and hogs, 10 to 30 grains. It acts 
as a blood tonic, astringent and disinfectant. 

Cannabis Indica. — The fluid extract of Indian cannabis is the preparation 
mostly used in veterinary practice and is given to quiet the nervous system 
and relieve pain. Doses: Horses 3 to 6 drams; cattle, 3 to 10 drams; sheep 
and hogs, 10 to 30 drops ; dogs, 1 to 13 drops. 

Camphor. — Dose of gum camphor for horse, 1 to 2 drams ; cattle 3 to 4 
drams; sheep and pigs, 10 to 40 grains; dogs, 1 to 8 grains. Camphor is 
soluble in ether, alcohol, chloroform and milk, but requires about seven hun- 
dred parts water to dissolve it and when powdering gum camphor add a few 
drops of alcohol. Spirits of camphor contains ten per cent, camphor gum 
and ninety per cent, alcohol. Camphor is given and applied to allay pain. 

Cantharides — Spanish Fly. — When given in small doses it stimulates both 
the genito-urinary tract and the kidneys to action; when applied exter- 
nally it blisters. The dose for horses and cattle is 5 to 35 grains ; sheep and 
hogs, 3 to 10 grains ; dogs, 1/2 to 8 grains. One part of powdered cantharides 
to 4, 6 or 8 parts lard makes an active yet inexpensive blister. 

Caraway Seed. — The dose for a horse is 1 ounce ; ox, from 1 to 3 ounces ; 
sheep and pigs, 2 drams. Its action is to improve the -condition of the 
stomach. 

Chloral Hydrate.— The dose for a horse is from ^^ to IV2 ounces, accord- 



248 THE PEOPLE'S HOME STOCK BOOK. 

ing to the effect you desire to produce ; cattle, % to 2 ounces ; sheep and pigs, 
% to 1 dram ; dogs, 3 to 30 grains. Chloral should always be well diluted 
with water when given and a solution of it should not be left standing long 
for it changes into chloroform. It is generally given to relieve pain or quiet 
an animal during a surgical operation. 

Cblodium Flexible. — This is applied to wounds for the purpose of forming 
an air-tight dressing and also for holding the edges of small wounds in a fixed 
position until they heal. It is also used to hold absorbent cotton or oakum 
on a raw sore. 

Corrosive Sublimate. — It is used principally externally in the treatment 
of wounds or as an external application to rid the skin of parasitic life. It 
is generally used in the strength of 1 to 500, 1 to 1000 or 1 to 2000 but when 
used as an uterine injection, 1 to 5000 or even 1 to 8000 parts water is 
about right. Fifteen grains dissolved in a pint of water makes a 1 to 500 
solution. 

Digitalis. — The fluid extract is the most convenient preparation to keep 
on hand. Doses: Horses, % to 1 dram; cattle, % to 3 drams; sheep and 
hogs, 5 to 30 drops. Digitalis stimulates the heart and is used in dropsical 
ailments mixed with acetate of potash and saltpeter. 

Epsom Salts — (Sulphate of Magnesia). — This is the common cathartic 
for cattle and when a laxative effect is desired give from 4 to 6 ounces daily, 
but when a brisk purgative effect is desired give from ly^ to 3 lbs. The dose 
for horses is about two-thirds as much as for cattle ; sheep and hogs, 4 to 6 
ounces. A cathartic effect can generally be obtained in from twelve to twenty 
hours. 

Ergot. — The fluid extract of ergot is usually given and its medical uses 
are to assist in parturition and to prevent uterine hemorrhage as well as to 
prevent hemorrhage during and after operations. Dose for horse or cow, 
%.to 3 ounces; sheep and swine, 1 to 3 drams; dogs, % to 1 dram. The dose 
should be repeated every 30 or 40 minutes until the desired effect is produced. 
Ergot loses its strength with age.

alyzes a healthy heart. Doses : Horses, 1 to 3 ounces ; cattle, 1% to 3 ounces. 
By adding an equal quantity of alcohol and ten times as much cold water it 
makes a good stimulant. 

Formalin or Formaldehyde. — ^This is the most powerful antiseptic, dis- 
infectant and deodorant and when applied to wounds should be used in the 
form of a one-quarter to three-quarter of one per cent, solution but when used 
to cleanse hands and instruments a one-half to a two per cent, solution is used. 
When destroying the disagreeable smell of fecal matter, a one per cent, solu- 
tion is sufficient, but when disinfecting a stable by spraying, a twenty per 
cent, solution sprayed into the air is not at all dangerous. It is sometimes 
given to correct bowel ailments. 

Gentian. — Gentian is a bitter tonic and one of the most useful drugs for 
use on the farm. Doses : Horses, 3 or 4 drams ; ox, 1 to 3 ounces ; sheep and 
swine, % dram ; dogs, 3 grains.

effect. 



USEFUL STABLE DRUGS. 249 

Glauber's Salts — (Sulphate Soda). — The dose for a horse when a purga- 
tive effect is desired is from 13 to 34 ounces, but seldom give less than 30 
ounces ; cattle, 1 to 3 pounds ; sheep and hogs, 3 to 4 ounces. When a laxa- 
tive effect is desired give about one-sixth of the above dose daily. Ginger 
or red pepper should be given with salts to prevent griping. 

Iodine. — The dose of resublim'ed iodine for horses is from 15 to 30 grains ; 
cattle, 30 to 40 grains ; sheep, 10 to 35 grains ; pigs, 5 to 35 grains ; dogs, one- 
sixth to one grain. Iodine, when given inwardly, acts as a blood purifier and 
absorbent. When applied externally it has a tendency to reduce bunches. 
There are many preparations of iodine and nearly all of them are useful in 
veterinary practice. 

Lime. — Lime is often used in cases of diarrhea, and is combined with 
opium and tannic acid. The dose for horses is from 2 drams to 1% ounces; 
cattle, % ounce to 2 ounces; sheep and pigs, from 30 to 40 grains or more; 
dogs, 2 to 25 grains. The dose of lime water for horses is from 4 ounces to 
16 ounces; cattle, one-third more; sheep and hogs, 3 to 3 ounces; dogs, 1 
to 6 drams. The chloride of lime is used as a deodorizer and a disinfectant 
and is very useful in destroying foul odors about the stable where there may 
be diseased or decomposing dead animals. 

Lobelia. — ^The dose of fluid extract of lobelia for a horse is from % dram 
to 3 drams; ox, from 1 to 3 drams; sheep and swine, from 5 to 15 grains. 
Lobelia is given to relieve air passage troubles and it very often produces 
good results. 

Mustard (Sinapis). — Mustard is useful as a counter-irritant in sore-throat, 
bronchitis, pneumonia and pleurisy ; also, the volatile oil obtained from black 
mustard is a blister and in combination with water acts quickly. 

Nux Vomica. — Nux Vomica is a tonic and nerve stimulant. Dose: 
Horses, 1 dram ; ox, 3 drams ; sheep and hogs, 5 to 15 grains ; dogs, ^4 to 2 
grains. 

Opium. — There are many preparations of opium and the drug is given in 
conjunction with other drugs with good results. Tincture of opium (lauda- 
num) is commonly used by horsemen. Doses : Horses, % to 3 ounces ; cattle, 
1 to 3 ounces ; sheep and hogs, 1 to 3 drams ; dogs, 1 to 35 drops. Camphorated 
tincture of opium (paregoric) is very often used in dog practice, the dose 
being from 2 to 15 drops for young dogs and from 1 to 3 drams for old dogs. 
Morphine and codeine are also preparations of opium, but not used so exten- 
sively on the stock farm. 

Poke — (Phytolacca). — The dose of fluid extract of Phytolacca root (poke 
root) for a horse is from 2 to 6 drams ; cows, % to 2 ounces ; sheep, 15 drops 
to 1% drams; pigs, 10 drops to 1 dram. The principal use of this drug is 
in mammitis (garget) to check the inflammation of the bag and prevent the 
formation of pus. Apply the extract locally in the proportion of one part to 
six or eight parts vaseline or sweet oil. 

Resin. — Resin acts on the kidneys of all kinds of live stock. Dose : Horse, 

4 to 6 drams ; ox, % to 1 ounce ; sheep, 2 to 3 drams ; hogs, 1 to 2 drams ; dogs, 

5 to 20 grains. 

Saltpeter — (Nitrate of Potash). — Large doses generally irritate the stom- 
ach, bowels and kidneys, but moderate doses purify the bloody reduce fever 
and act on the kidneys. Doses : Horses, 2 to 4 drams ; cattle, 3 to 6 drams ; 
sheep and hogs, 10 to 25 grains; dogs, 5 to 30 grains. 



350 THE PEOPLE'S HOME STOCK BOOK.

one mostly used is bicarbonate of soda (baking soda). This is a very useful 
farm drug for it is both given inwardly and applied locally. Doses : Horses, 
2 drams to 1^/^ ounces ; cattle, % ounce to 3 ounces ; sheep and hogs, i/^ dram 
to 1 dram. It is given for stomach and bowel ailments and, dissolved in 
water, to relieve itching skin troubles — one ounce to a quart of water makes 
a useful skin lotion. It is also used to correct leucorrhea. 

Sugar of Lead — (Acetate of Lead). — ^This is perhaps the most useful 
preparation of lead to keep on the farm. It is given inwardly to check hemor- 
rhages firom the stomach and lungs and for diabetes and diarrhea. It is also 
useful as a wound dressing with sulphate of zinc. Doses: Horses and cattle, 
% to 1 dram ; sheep and pigs, 5 to 15 grains ; dogs, i/4 to 3 grains. Dissolve 
one and one-quarter ounces of sugar of lead and one ounce of sulphate of zinc 
in a quart of water and apply to sore back and shoulders four or five times a 
day and it will help them. 

Sulphate of Zinc. — There are many preparations of zinc ; the sulphate is 
mostly used externally in healing lotions or eye washes. Dissolving one 
ounce in a quart of water and adding the same quantity of acetate of lead 
makes a nice wound dressing and is also useful in the treatment of crucked 
heels and sore shoulders. The oxide of zinc is used as a healing powder and 
is often mixed with vaseline to make a healing ointment. 

Sweet Spirits of Nitre. — Dose for a horse, 1 to 2 ounces ; ox, 2 to 4 ounces ; 
sheep, 2 to 4 drams; dog, V2 to 2 drams. It is given as a stimulant and has 
a direct action upon the kidneys.

drams ; sheep and pigs, % to 2 drams. It is also used in ointment form, one 
part tannic acid to four parts vaseline or benzoinated lard or glycerine. It 
is given as an astringent in bowel ailments and very often used in solution 
to toughen tender shoulders. 

Turpentine (Oil of Turpentine). — Turpentine is a vermicide and stimu- 
lant, also a counter-irritant when applied externally. Dose for horses when 
a stimulant and kidney effect is desired, 2 to 4 drams every five or six hours ; 
cattle, 3 to 6 drams. When given to kill worms from 1 to 4 ounces can be 
given horses and cattle, but it should be mixed with ten times its bulk of 
cotton seed oil, linseed oil or milk. Whenever turpentine is given as a drench 
it is done with some risk. 

Vinegar— (Acetic Acid). — Instead of acetic acid vinegar is often used 
in removing warts and other dry excrescences.

BREEDING AND FEEDING LIVE STOCK 
FOR PROFIT. 

(How to Produce Milk, Wool, Muscle and Fat.) 



BREEDING. 

The most valuable lessons in breeding are to be learned by consulting 
the successful breeder. Every stock raiser should be a good judge of the 
kind of animals he is producing; this can only be learned by study and close 
observation. Why not visit the State and County fairs and look over the 
total exhibit; then watch the judging. If necessary, ask the judge questions- 
why such an animal was awarded the prize. This teaches the breeder how to 
tell an animal of quality from an ordinary specimen; besides, he learns to 
know market values, which, of course, greatly assists him in both buying and 
selling. Following up the different causes of failure in breeding, I find those 
who have been unsuccessful were either poor judges of live stock or they 
were poor feeders. 

It is always a mistake to keep too much live stock on a farm but never a 
mistake to keep a few good animals. These same animals should always have 
the best of care. Every breeder I know is keeping a few animals at a loss 
and some breeders have no profitable animals at all on their farms and are 
astonished that they are not making money. 

The unprofitable live stock should be sold and profitable ones put in their 
place. 

When engaging in the business of live stock raising, select nothing but 
good animals that are suitable for not more than two or three purposes. It 
is important that breeding stock be of rugged constitution and as free from 
disease as possible. Inbreeding has a tendency to predispose live stock to 
disease, especially if it is carried too far. When a breeding animal has a con- 
stitutional defect it should be mated to one with the same points exception- 
ally well developed. By giving attention to such a rule, the hereditary tend- 
ency or predisposition to either weakness or disease can often be avoided. 

The breeder must keep in mind the value of soundness in horses for 
unsoundness depreciates their market value; therefore, the breeder should 
possess some knowledge of what constitutes soundness. No stockman can 
afford to use an unsound stallion for breeding purposes unless the unsoundness 
was produced by accident or injury for if it is a hereditary ailment it is pretty 
sure to be transmitted to the produce. Successful breeders do not use crippled, 
blind, ring-boned, spavined, curbed, badly puffed, crooked-legged or deformed 
mares for breeding purposes. It is also a mistake to use roarers (whistlers) 
or broken-winded mares that have heaves for breeding purposes; besides, it 
seldom pays to breed bad tempered, tricky, vicious mares. 

261 



THE PEOPLE'S HOME STOCK BOOK. 

Breeders who aim to produce either a draft, general utility, saddle horse 
or roadster seem to be more successful than those who try to raise horses fol 
all purposes. No matter what kind you raise, they should be good walkers 
and have fair all-round action and travel without striking. Never select thin, 
gaunt, hard keepers for breeding purposes ; they are usually unprofitable. 

In raising cattle select large, easy keepers for beef and deep milkers for 
dairy purposes, rather than to try to combine them both in one. 

In swine select hogs that are of a moderately large breed but easy keepers, 
for certain animals are usually fatted at a loss. 

In sheep select a flock that are good breeders, good wool producers and 
those that are easily fatted. 

To be successful in raising live stock for profit you must, as I have 
stated, be a good judge and have a thorough knowledge of feeding. 

FEEDING. 

Modern feeding principles are the outgrowth of centuries of feeding. The 
application of science to feeding has resulted in the formation and classifica- 
tion of rules and principles which experience has shown to underlie all feeding 
operations. Good feeding was just as scientific centuries ago as it is today. 
The experienced feeder used many of the same foods, got just as good results • 
and fed just as economically, but he did not understand the physiological 
reasons for his methods and could impart but little of his practical knowledge 
to his fellow men. With our present knowledge of animal nutrition, food 
analysis, and the uses of the food elements in the animal body, the novice 
should be able to gain the practical knowledge in a few years which the old 
feeders had at the end of a lifetime. 

The earliest farmers kept little live stock. Their farms were rough and 
uncultivated and their animals grazed throughout the year on the native 
grasses. Feed was not stored for winter use and little or no shelter was pro- 
vided. Feeding under these conditions was a simple operation. But as graz- 
ing land became scarce, and as animals increased in numbers and improved in 
quality the matter of providing suitable nourishment and utilizing it at a 
profit became a study. At the present time the need for economy in feeding 
and the perfection of the product is recognized by all. The feeder of today 
must feed to produce the greatest number of pounds of flesh, milk or wool at 
the least possible expenditure of food, time and labor. To do this he must 
have at least a working knowledge , of the fundamental principles of animal 
nutrition. No hard and fast rules can be laid down for the feeding of all 
classes of animals under all conditions and surroundings. We can calculate 
the rations and method of handling which will approximate the results de- 
sired. Maximum results can then be obtained by slight deviation from the 
calculated rules. 

Every feeder knows that certain combinations of foods give better results 
than others. When the old feeders found that their animals were not doing 
as well as they should, they gave them a little " meal." They did not know 
why the meal produced the desired results, but experience taught them that 
it would. Here the chemist and the student of animal nutrition came to the 
assistance of the feeders. The chemist learned that certain combinations of 



BREEDING AND FEEDING FOR PROFIT. 263 

chemical elements were present in all food materials. He further learned that 
these same combinations were found in the various tissues of the animal body 
The logical conclusion was that the feeding animal should be furnished with 
such foods as would supply the necessary elements in the proportions best 
suited to the animal being fed. 

FOOD ANALYSIS. 

The agricultural chemist divided the nutritious substances in foods into 
groups which he called water, ash, protein, carbohydrates, crude fiber, nitro- 
gen free extract and fat. The processes by which he determines the quanti- 
ties of each of these substances are too complicated to be presented here. We 
must content ourselves with brief statements of what each consists and some- 
thing of the function of each in building up the body. All foods, no matter 
how dry they may appear to be, contain some water or moisture. The ash 
is the mineral element of the plant and goes to build up the bony tissues of 
the animal and, to a small degree, the soft tissues. Protein is a group of ele- 
ments containing nitrogen. It is absolutely essential to the production and 
repair of blood, muscles, nerves, bones and all the tissues of the body. The 
greatest amount of protein is required by growing animals but animals of all 
ages and all kinds require some protein. Carbohydrates form a group of 
nutrients containing carbon, oxygen and hydrogen, but no nitrogen. They 
cannot produce or repair tissue, but they do form fat, either in the body or in 
milk, and they produce energy and heat. Crude fiber is the framework of the 
cells in plants. Nitrogen free extract is the portion of the feeding stuff re- 
maining when the other substances have been deducted. Fat is the vege- 
table oil, not unlike that found in the animal body. The fats serve the same 
purpose as the carbohydrates, except that as a source of energy and heat the 
fats are about two and one-fourth times as valuable as carbohydrates. 

THE ESSENTIAL ELEMENTS OF FOODS. 

The protein, carbohydrates, and fats are the essential groups. All three 
of them are used as sources of heat and energy. Any or all of them may be 
used for fat production, although the chief sources of animal fat are the 
vegetable fats and carbohydrates. Protein is the only group that can build 
up and repair the tissues and maintain the vital organs. 

FEEDING STANDARDS. 

These facts have been determined for us by the chemists. The students 
of animal nutrition dealt with the analyses furnished by the chemists. They 
determined the requirements of the various animals under varying conditions 
of age and utility. They learned that all rations must contain some protein. 
Th^y also learned that the addition of carbohydrates and fats reduced the 
amount of protein required. The question then arose how much of the ration 
for different purposes should consist of protein, and how much of carbohy- 
drates and fats. This was worked out by extensive investigation with animals 
of all kinds and under all normal conditions, and given to us in what are 
known as feeding standards. The standards most used are those established 
by the German scientists Wolff and Lehmann, and are known as the Wolff- 



264

NUTRITIVE RATIO. 

We have seen that protein, carbohydrates and fats are the essential nu- 
trients in a food ration or a single food material. The prof)ortion of protein 
to the carbohydrates and fats in a food is a quick indication of the value of that 
food in a ration. This is known as the nutritive ratio. The nutritive ratio 
is the ratio of the amount of the digestible protein in a given feeding material 
or a combination of foods to the amount of digestible carbohydrates and fats 
they contain. Fats yield two and one-fourth times as much heat in the body 
as carbohydrates. To determine the nutritive ratio of a food or a combination 
of foods the amount of digestible fat is multiplied by two and one-fourth 
(2.25'), and the product obtained is added to the total quantity of digestible 
carbohydrates in the given food or combination of foods. This sum divided 
by the digestible protein gives the nutritive ratio. For example, the tables 
of food analyses give the digestible ingredients of corn as follows : Protein, 
7.14 per cent. ; carbohydrates, 66.12 per cent. ; fat, 4.97 per cent. To find the 
nutritive ratio of corn we multiply the fat content by two and one-fourth 
(4.S7 X 2,25) and get H.18, Adding this to the carbohydrates (66,13 plus 



BREEDING AND FEEDING FOR PROFIT. 265 

11.18) we have 77.30. Now, dividing by the protein (77.30 divided by 7.14) 
we get 10.8, and we express the nutritive ratio of corn as 1 to 10.8 or 1 : 10.8. 

TABLE OF FOOD ANALYSES. 

Tables of analyses of foods may be obtained from many different sources. 
The following brief table gives the average digestible ingredients of some 
of the most common food materials :

BALANCED RATIONS. 

We have found that certain elements in plants go to build up or repair 
certain tissues in the animal body. Different classes of animals, and animals 
under different conditions of growth and age require different feeding. Thus 
the growing calf requires muscle and bone-making material. The fattening 
steer requires tissue-building and fat-producing material. The dairy cow 
requires a food that will keep the vital organs in repair and at the same time 
produce fat for milk production. Obviously, these different animals require 
different rations. Each animal requires a ration in which the food elements 
are supplied in the proportion best suited to meet the needs of its own con- 
dition, work or growth. Such a ration is called a balanced ration, i. e., a ration 
combined of foods mixed in such proportion as to provide the constituents in 
such relative quantities as experience has shown to give the best results under 
the given set of conditions. 

The feeding standards give us the requirements of the animals. The 
tables of analyses give us the amounts of digestible nutrients supplied by the 
various foods. The task of the feeder is to combine these foods in such 
quantities as will give the animals the required nourishment. In actual feed- 
ing, the feeder must also make this selection with a view to economy and the 
utilization of the foods at hand. To make a practical application, suppose that 
we are to feed a dairy cow weighing 1,000 pounds and giving 33 pounds of 
milk per day, and have clover hay, corn silage, corn meal, cottonseed meal 
and wheat bran to feed. The feeding standards tell us that such a cow should 
have about 89 pounds of dry matter per day. This dry matter should contain 
2.5 pounds protein, 13 pounds carbohydrates, 0.5 pounds fat and have a nutri- 
tive ratio of 1 to 5.65. By reference to the table of analyses and trying out 
different quantities of foods named, we find that the requirements of the 
standard are best met by a combination of 4i/2 lbs. clover, 27 lbs. silage, 
SYz lbs. of corn, 6 lbs. of bran and 2 lbs. of cottonseed meal. By ref- 



866 THE PEOPLE'S HOME STOCK BOOK. 

erence to the table of analyses we find that their combination supplies the 
nutritive elements in the quantities shown in the following table : 

Dry Carbo- 

Food. Matter. Proteint hydrates. Fats. 

4.5 lbs. Clover 3.8 0.33 1.71 .08 

27 lbs. Silage 6.9 0.32 3.93 .24 

5.5 lbs. Corn 4.7 0.34 3.59 .19 

6 lbs. Bran 5.3 0.72 2.47 .17 

2 lbs. Cottonseed Meal ; 1.8 0.74 0.33 .25 

Total 22.5 2.45 12.03 0.93 

Standard 29.0 2.5 13. 0.5 

Applying the rule given for determining the nutritive ratio, we find that 
the ratio of the above combination is 1 to 6.4. The requirements of the 
standard are thus met near enough for practical feeding. To meet the needs 
of each individual, slightly vary the quantities here and watch results. Indi- 
viduals vary in their needs, and the feeder must study his animals and vary his 
computed rations accordingly. 



TRICKS OF HORSE TRADERS^ 



During my thirty years of experience, I have had occasion to buy and sell 
several thousand horses and have met with a great many deceptions among 
unscrupulous horse traders. I have assisted in sending several crooked horse 
dealers to the state's prison and for the protection of the public, I have deemed 
it wise to expose a few of their tricks. Beware the Tricks of Horse Swindlers. 

1. Dieting and Doping a Heaver. — Broken winded horses breathe easier 
when empty, hence bulky food is kept from them, their food is dampened with 
lime water and they are doped with such drugs as arsenic, lobelia, chloral 
hydrate, opium, stramonium or even lard or linseed oil and sometimes bird 
shot is given them to palliate or hide the symptoms of heaves until the horse 
is unloaded on the purchaser. 

Caution to Buyer. — Let him eat his fill of dry, bulky food or satisfy his 
thirst with wate'r, then trot him up a hill or on a muddy road or otherwise 
subject him to violent exercise and he will show the symptoms of heaves. 

2. Plugging a Roarer or Whistler. — It is a common practice to insert a 
sponge in one or both nostrils with thread attached, making it possible to 
clear the nostril after the sale is made. Or, sometimes both ends are cut from 
a lemon, it is squeezed dry and then inserted in the nostril where it will shrink 
and be blown out later by the horse. Plugging the nostrils prevents roaring 
or whistling for the time being. Checking the head high also aids in cover- 
ing up the symptoms. 

Caution to Buyer. — Always examine high up in nostrils when buying a 
horse. Also give him a brisk gallop to bring out the' symptoms. 

3. Blowing Up Old and Sweenied Horses. — When a dishonest horse 
trader has a sweenied horse, it is a common practice for him to blow air under 
the skin over the shrunken parts. He does this by puncturing the skin and 
blowing air under it through a tube or goose quill. This gives the wasted 
parts the appearance of being normal. Sometimes this is done with old horses 
to give them a younger appearance. 

Caution to Buyer. — By applying pressure to the parts with the hand a 
crackling noise is produced which is quite unnatural, therefore by close ob- 
servation this trick is easily discovered. 

4. Paralyzing a Switcher, — Unscrupulous dealers, to stop switching and 
" line grabbing " until after a sale is made, hang a four or five pound weight 
to the tail for several hours or tie the tail up over the back, keeping it in a 
fixed position until the tail is temporarily paralyzed. This prevents switching 
while the partial paralysis lasts. 

Caution to Buyer. — It is always suspicious when a horse hangs the tail in 
a limp or pendulous way and never moves or switches it. ■ _ 

5. Gingering. — Crooked horse traders frequently insert a piece of ginger 
root in the lower bowel or moisten the anus with an irritating medicine of 
some kind to make him carry a high tail and act more lively when in the show 
ring or on the road. 

267, 



268 THE PEOPLE'S HOME STOCK BOOK. 

Caution to Buyer. — Be suspicious when a horse carries his tail too high. 

6. Hiding Lameness. — Horse swindlers have learned to handle the hy- 
podermic syringe and inject cocaine over the nerves on each side of a lame 
leg. (This prevents pain and makes the horse go sound until after a sale or 
trade is consummated. 

Frequently they have a section of the nerve taken out and this perma- 
nently relieves the animal of pain below the fetlock. Sometimes the nerve is 
severed or divided above the knee or hock and this relieves lameness below. 

Often the shoe is pulled off the foot of lame leg to deceive the buyer into 
believing that the lameness was caused by casting a shoe and is only tem- 
porary. 

Caution to Buyer. — Watch closely for scars or needle punctures, espe- 
cially above and below the fetlock. Be suspicious of a lame horse that has 
cast a shoe. 

7. Hiding Spavins, Ringbones and Sidebones. — ^Unscrupulous horse 
dealers frequently make wounds or skin abrasions over a spavin, ringbone or 
sidebone, or they bruise the parts to produce local swelling. This sometimes 
misleads the buyer into believing that the horse has met, with a recent and 
trivial injury from which he will soon recover. 

Caution to Buyer. — Hesitate to buy a horse when sufifering from a wound 
or skin abrasion in the localities where these blemishes are found. 

8. Putting Heuness Galls on a Balky Horse. — Gypsies and disreputable 
horse traders very often burn sores on the shoulders and disarrange the hail? 
on top of the horse's neck as though caused by a cellar. They also chafe the 
horse's sides as though done by the harness. This is done to make the inno- 
cent purchaser believe that the horse received these scars while doing hard 
work in the harness while it is possible that the horse will not pull a pound ii) 
the harness. 

Caution to Buyer. — Insist on seeing the horse work and pull a heavy load. 

9. " Doctoring " a Cribber. — ^To conceal the fact that a horse is a cribber, 
horse traders sometimes saw between the incisor teeth or drive small wedges 
between them or make the mouth sore by cutting or burning the gums. The 
horse is not likely to crib while his mouth is very sore. 

Caution to Buyer. — Examine the mouth and incisor teeth very carefully 
before buying. 

10. Winding a Horse, — ^A common trick of horse traders when showing, 
a broken winded horse is to gallop past the buyer, then go slow and consume as 
much time as possible in turning. This allows the horse to catch his wind 
and not show his broken wind when galloping past the buyer. Sometimes the 
horse is made to appear as though trying to run away and thus requiring to 
be held in. The head is also checked high and the nose kept poked out as 
much as possible. 

Caution to Buyer. — Insist on the horse being galloped fast for a con- 
siderable distance and the nose pulled well into the breast. 

11. "Bishoping." — For nearly a hundred years gypsies and dishonest 
horse traders have been known to " Bishop " the teeth, thus making an old 
horse appear young to the casual observer. The operation consists in cutting 
cups in the table surface and staining them with nitrate of silver, thereby 
giving the old tooth the appearance of a much younger one. Special tools 
are made for this purpose and it is astonishing how expert some of the horse 
traders become in this art 



TRICKS OF HORSE TRADERS. 269 

Caution to Buyer. — ^An old horse seldom has the appearance of a young 
one, and the teeth have an entirely different appearance. The difference wilJ 
readily be noticed upon comparison. 

13. The " Stool-Pigeon Swindler." — In all large cities, it is common prac- 
tice with many disreputable horse dealers to advertise a horse as being the 
property of Mrs. Blank, who is represented to the customer as a widow. She, 
of course, is always dressed in black and sheds tears with ease while in reality 
she is the "stool-pigeon" or accomplice of the swindler. Various misrepre- 
sentations are made and after the swindle is discovered by the purchaser he 
is either unable to find the sellers or he finds them to be irresponsible parties 
from whom no damages can be collected. I have known operators of this kind 
to rent as many as six or eight barns in various parts of the city and advertise 
a horse first at one and then at another. 

Caution to Buyer. — Beware of " stool-pigeons " and widows (when buy- 
ing horses) and have a doubt in your mind when answering advertisements 
of this kind. Don't be influenced by the horse stories of strangers but buy 
the horse on its merits. 

13. Matching a Fractious Horse with a Lazy One. — To deceive inno- 
cent purchasers, dishonest dealers sometimes dope an unmanageable horse 
with drugs to make him quiet and gentle. Or, sometimes the horse is walked 
or driven, before shown for sale, until he is nearly exhausted. These things 
are also done to match a fractious horse with a quiet, lazy one and make them 
travel well together. 

Caution to Buyer. — In matching horses never decide too quickly and es- 
pecially if the animal impresses you as being vicious or excitable for he may 
have been " fixed " to deceive you. 

14. The Straw and Stringhalt Trick. — When horses show stringhalt the 
trader very often accounts, for it by saying it is a habit contracted on account 
of being bedded deeply in rye straw, thus obliging the horse to lift his feet 
high while walking about in the box stall. 

Caution to Buyer. — Don't accept an excuse or apology for an ailment of 
this kind. The excuse is generally made of " straw." 

15. The Dark Trick. — Horse traders frequently desire to dispose of 
horses that are suffering from moon blindness (periodic ophthalmia) and this 
is an incurable eye defect which is much worse at some times than others. 
These horses are usually disposed of in the evening or at the time when they 
show the defect the least. 

Caution to Buyer. — Never buy a horse in the dark. Notice that both eyes 
are the same size, and that the lids are normal and the eyeballs transparent 
and not of a bluish color. 

16. Stuffing the Ears. — The ears of nervous and excitable horses are 
often stuffed with cotton, wool or oakum to render the animal deaf and thus 
prevent his becoming frightened by noise. 

Caution to Buyer. — Always examine both ears closely. 

17. The Meaning of Many Scars.— Scars are frequently the result of run- 
aways or falling during a fit. The animal may be unmanageable or subject to 
blind staggers or the scars may have been produced by injuries received while 
rolling and tumbling with frequent attacks of colic. 

Caution to Buyer. — Beware of a horse with many scars unless you know 
what caused them.
