INTRODUCTION. 



It was at the suggestion of some friends in England — 
who had spent a few years at the Cape, and who have 
ever since shown a kindly interest in South Africa — that 
I collected some homely and old-fashioned recipes from 
relations and friends^ and from practical housewives some 
simple and dainty dishes. 

I trust that to some old friends in England my little 
book may bring back recollections of days spent at the 
Cape ; and to my country cousins and far-off friends in 
South Africa — who, in the rush of life, have not found 
leisure to copy their mothers' and grandmothers' old recipe- 
books — this collection may prove useful. Few Colonial 
cooks of the present day understand the art of cooking; 
it is therefore absolutely necessary for the lady of the 
house to know something about it, so that she can direct 
them. Let us look at some of the simplest terms. 

Simmering (to bring as near as possible to boiling 
without letting it boil) is one of the great difficulties. 
Cooks will not remember how much depends on slow 
cooking. 

Hashes, Curries, "Bredees," etc., etc., must simmer. 
Fry the onion with the meat, a light brown (" smoor," as 



INTRODUCTION. 



Cape cooks say). This must be done rather quickly; then 
the meat must simmer with whatever ingredient you like 
to add. 

The old Cape families of Dutch descent, who had 
Malay and Indian cooks, and many of French descent, 
understood the art of ROASTING. They roast their 
Chickens, Partridges, Quail, Wild Duck, Venison, etc., 
not in an oven, but in a flat, round pot, about five and a 
half inches deep (Dutch baking-pot), with a raised lid. 
The meat is put into the pot with, say, half a pint of 
water, and the pot is put on the stove. About half an 
hour afterwards some live coals are put on the lid, and 
just before the joint or chicken begins to brown it is basted 
well with a little butter or dripping. Half an hour before 
serving the cook should pour half a tumbler of red wine, 
well mixed with a small dessertspoonful of flour, over the 
joint or chicken, while giving the gravy a good stir. This 
gives a delicious flavour to any Poultry or Venison. A 
leg of Mutton done in a Dutch baking-pot in this way is 
very good. 

In Boiling meat, a leg of Mutton, or Chicken, etc., 
be very careful that the water boils when you put it in, and 
then let it simmer. The meat will be tender ^.x\d. juicy— - 
this is my experience. 

Boil all green Vegetables— viz.. Peas, Cabbage, Green 
Beans, etc. — in an open saucepan; put them into boiling 
water, into which a teaspoonful of salt and a pinch of 
carbonate of soda has been added. This is the American 



INTRODUCTION. 



mode of cooking vegetables. The Peas, Beans, etc., will 
be beautifully green and delicate. 

Broiling is the most primitive way of cooking, and it 
is best understood by our country folk. It is, nevertheless, 
one of the most appetising ways of cooking a Mutton 
Chop; and any one who has travelled in South Africa 
will remember how good was the " Sasatie " (Kabob) or 
tender " Carbonatje " (Mutton Chop), steaming hot from 
the gridiron on wood coals, or two-pronged fork held 
against the coals. Some kinds of fish broiled are very 
good, such as the Cape " Harder," " Hottentot Fish " or 
" Snoek." 

Stewing is a very easy and economical way of cook- 
ing. First stew the meat and Onions together, with a very 
little water, till nice and tender and slightly brown ; then 
add Cauliflower, Green Beans, Potatoes, or any vegetable 
you like. This should be done in a flat pot, not a deep 
saucepan. Meat and vegetables done in this way are called 
by the Malay cook a "Bredee." Add a red chilli cut 
small, or a few pieces of it. 

In Frying Fish, Cutlets, etc., be very careful that the 
lard or clarified dripping in which you do it is boiling. 
Do not forget to dust your fish with flour, and dip it into 
an egg and bread-crumbs, before putting it into the 
fiying-pan. 

The tail of the native Cape sheep — which is composed 
entirely of fat, and often weighs five or six pounds — when 
minced and melted out, supplies the Cape housewife with 



INTRODUCTION. 



a very good substitute for lard ; is excellent for frying fish 
or Fritters in ; it is more delicate than lard, and eaten on 
hot toast, with pepper and salt, is a good imitation of 
marrow. 

Always dry any pieces of stale white bread you have, 
cutting off the crust ; pound in a mortar, and keep in a 
tin closed up, ready for dusting Rissoles or Cutlets before 
frying. 

Preserves. — In making Marmalades and Jams always 
oil the preserving-pan with the best Lucca Oil, to prevent 
the jam from burning. If dry sugar is used for preserving, 
keep the pot closed till the sugar is dissolved, stirring 
occasionally. When the sugar is melted, jams should boil 
briskly. In preserving fruit, such as Figs, Citrons, etc., 
boil very slowly — simmer, in fact. 

Under the head of "Invalid Cookery" will be 
found good recipes for Beef Tea, etc.; and under 
" Home Remedies," some homely cures for Burns, 
Rheumatism, etc. 

The Recipes that follow are arranged in alphabetical 
order according to the class of dish to which they 
belong. For instance, for Beef Fritters, look under the 
heading of "Fritters"; for "Berg River Cake," see 
" Cakes," etc. 

Great care should be taken to keep all kitchen utensils 
scrupulously clean. Washing soda will thoroughly cleanse 
and remove any taste or smell adhering to saucepans or 
pans in which onions or cabbage have been cooked. One 



INTRODUCTION. 



ounce of washing soda and a gallon of boiling water will 
go a long way. 

Brooke's (Monkey brand) Soap is most excellent for 
scouring the inside of enamelled saucepans, and for 
brightening coppers and all tin things used in a kitchen ; 
in fact, it is so useful that one wonders how one; ever got 
on without it. It cleans marble washstands, mirrors, 
window-panes, etc. 

In cleaning dishes and plates, be careful first to wipe 
out all greasiness with a piece of paper, and then wash 
with blue mottled soap in very warm water, and rinse 
off in clean hot water, and dry and brighten with a nice 
clean cloth. 

Cooks should be very careful always to soak all 
kitchen cloths over-night in washing soda, and thoroughly 
rinse next morning in warm water and soap. 

Wash glass in cold water and blue mottled soap, and 
brighten with two cloths; if turned over on the washing 
board on a cloth to drain, it takes much less time to brighten. 

A few blank pages have been left at the end of each 
letter of the alphabet, in which the owner of this little 
" Where Is It ? " can enter any new recipes she or he may 
come across, and think worth preserving.

PREFACE TO SECOND EDITION. 



" Hilda's ' Where is it ? ' or Recipes " has been 
received in so friendly and kind a manner by the press 
and public, both in the South African Colonies and in 
England, that within an unexpectedly short time a second 
edition is called for ; and I gladly seize the opportunity 
of thanking the many friends, known and unknown, who 
have accorded so warm a greeting to the little Colonial 
recipe book. 

In this new edition some corrections have been made, 
and some excellent recipes have been added. 

It will give me real pleasure to receive (through 
Messrs. Juta & Co., Cape Town) any suggestions ol 
improvements, or any original recipes, with permission 
tc add hereafter to the collection, if deemed suitable.

HILDA'S 
"WHERE IS IT?" OF RECIPES. 



A. 



ANCHOVIES ON TOAST. 

Toast some slices of bread before a sharp fire, butter 
well, and cut into pieces one and a half inches square, lay on 
each piece a slice of hard-boiled &g^ and a boned anchovy. 
Sprinkle over the whole chopped parsley, and stand it for 
ten minutes in the oven. Serve on a hot dish with water- 
cress round. 



APPLES (A NICE WAY OF COOKING). 

Wipe the apples, but do not peel them, core, quarter, 
and cut into slices. Have ready some syrup, made in the 
proportions of a pound of sugar (or three-quarters, if they 
are very sweet apples) to a pint of water, boiled quickly 
for five minutes — either moist or crystallised sugar. Throw 
the apples into the boiling syrup, boil rapidly for one hour, 
reckoning from its first boiling up — stir frequently. It 
should then be clear, and jellied, and stiff. The rapid 
boiling drives off the watery particles in steam. Allow one 
pound of sugar to half-a-dozen apples. Cloves, cinnamon, 
or lemon-peel, may be added to tast^,

Al APPLES (STEWED)— APRICOTS (DRIED)— ASPIC, 



STK^rVED APPLES AND CUSTARD. 

Ingredients. 

t good-sized Apples. 4 lb. Sugar. 

4 Cloves. The rind of half a Lemon. 

I pint Water. 4 pint Custard. (See CusTAlD.) 

t doz. Almonds. 

Pare and core the apples, but do not divide them, and, 
if possible, leave on the stalks ; boil the sugar and water 
for ten minutes, then put into the syrup with lemon-rind 
and cloves, simmer gently till tender. Do not let them 
break. Then reduce the syrup by boiling quickly, let it 
cool a little, then pour over the apples. Have ready half a 
pint of thick custard, pour round ^^t. apples. Lastly, stick 
into the apples one dozen almonds, blanched and cut into 
strips. Takes twenty to thirty minutes to stew. This 
quantity will fill a large glass dish. 

APRICOTS, DRIED AND SALTED. 
{Commonly called " MebosJ') 
Take soft ripe apricots, lay them in salt water (about 
two ounces of salt to a quart bottle) for a few hours. Then 
lay them on a mat to dry in the sun ; the next day press 
them between the hands to flatten, and to let the stone 
come out. The next day repeat the process. At the 
Cape it generally dries and becomes " Mebos " in three or 
four days in the sun, but if the weather should be damp, 
they might be dried in heated rooms, or a cool oven. To 
crystallise the Mebos, lay them in lime water [see Lime 
Water) for five minutes, till they feel nice and tender, 
take out, wipe dry on a soft cloth, and rub coarse crystallised 
white sugar well into each ; take one and a half pounds 
of sugar to one pound of Mebos. Pack closely with lots 
of sugar in between, in jars that will cork well. A very 
nice sweetmeat, and said to be a remedy for sea-sickness.

an hour. Thicken the gravy with butter rolled in flour. 
Enmtgh for six people. 

BEEF TEA.— See Invalid Cookery. 

"BILTONG." 
(An old Cape way of curing and drying meat.) 
Take about six or eight pounds of beef, cut out in a 
long tongue-shape, out of the hind leg of an ox, from the 
thigh-bone down to the knee-joint. There are two such 
pieces in each leg, being quite encased in a fleecy skin. 
Take this meat, which is quite free from sinew or fat, first 
rub it with a little salt, and an hour after rub in well half 
a pound of salt, ditto brown sugar, and an ounce of salt- 
petre. Leave for three days, rubbing and turning every 
day ; then put it under a press for a night. Have it dried 
in the wind, and then hung in the chimney till it is dry 
and pretty firm. When eaten, it is to be cut into very 
thin slices — or rasped. Invalids like this way best ; in 
fact, with bread and butter, " Biltong " is most appetising 
and nourishing ; and, on board ship, people sufl'ering from 
ntal de mer have relished this when no other delicacy 
would tempt them to eat. 

BISCUITS.— See Tea Cakes.

with the meat and soaked bread. Mix one egg with the 
mixture, whisk the other with some milk, and pour over 
the whole, after being put into a buttered pie-dish or into 
little cups (the old Indian way), with a lemon or bay leaf 
stuck into each little cup. Put them in the oven to bake, 
and send to table in the cups or pie-dish. Serve with 
rice. (This dish is equally good made of cold mutton.) 

One ounce of tamarinds soaked in half a pint of boiling 
water, then strained, and the juice used for Bobotee, 
Sasaties, and Curries instead of vinegar, gives a very 
pleasant acid flavour.

BREAD {BROWN). 

(Our old " Groote Post " Recipe. Cape.) 

Take about six pounds of meal, pour into it three 

cups of home-made yeast {see Yeast), and as much tepid 

water as will make it the consistency of dough. Knead 

it well for a quarter of an hour, till your hand comes cle4n

out of the dough. Set it to rise in the pan in which you 
have mixed it, and cover it up well. Put in the warmest 
comer of the kitchen. It will be ready for making into 
loaves in two hours, and will then have a rather dis- 
agreeable odour and feel quite spongy. Six pounds of 
meal will just fill an ordinary baking-pan for a moderate- 
sized stove oven. Keep the stove well heated, and when 
it has been in the oven for an hour turn the baking- tin 
round. Bread made in this way is generally very sweet 
and wholesome. {See LOAF.) 



<' BREDEE?' 
(A favourite Cape Stew. Malay.) 

Take two pounds of thick rib of mutton, or in ordering 
four pounds of cutlet meat, take all that is rejected after 
carefully cutting and paring the cutlets. Take this meat, 
cut in small pieces, put into a stewing-pot with two onions 
cut small. Let the meat and onion fry to a nice brown — 
dotit burn, A rather quick fire is required for browning 
onions. Take one dozen or more large tomatoes, cut 
in slices or pass through a mincing machine. If the 
tomatoes are not quite ripe add a teaspoonful of sugar, 
salt, a small piece of red chilli ; let the tomato and meat 
stew gently; if watery, remove the lid of pot till there 
is a rich thick gravy. Bredees are not to be made in 
deep saucepans, but in flat pots, as they would be too 
watery in the former. Meat can be done with any 
vegetable in this way. Cauliflower, potato, vegetable 
marrow, makes good Bredee, {See TOMATO BREDEE, 
p. 244.) 

"BOONTJES BREDEE' 
(Dry Bean Stew. Cape or Malay.) 

Take one pound of ribs of mutton, the fat part ; set 
on the fire with a small onion cut in rings to brown 
slightly ; then add a pint of water, about two or three 
cups of dry beans. If the beans are old. parboil them 

14 



BRINE-" BliOOD KLUITJES "—BRUSHES. [B 



for half an hour ; strain through a cullender and add 
to the meat Stew till nice and tender for an hour or two. 
Add a red chilli, cut up. This is a favourite Cape dish. 
Any kind of dry bean done in this way is very nice.

first to have the pot warmed ; on this pour three cups of 
boiling water. Keep the pot on the stove or coals, let it 
drain through the bag twice, then put into bottles and 
cork immediately. This will keep, if well corked and 
made quickly, for a fortnight, and is most excellent for 
picnics, when one tablespoon added to a cup of boiling 
milk will be found as good as any freshly-made coffee. 
For ordinary use, when not so much milk would be used, 
add four cups of water instead of three to a breakfast- 
cap of ground coffee mixed with chicory.

CURRY (CHICKEN— CUCUMBER). [C 



CURRY {CHICKEN). 
(Our Cape way.) 

Ingredients. 

I Fowl. 3 tablespoons of Vinegar or a sour Applet, 

ij tablespoons of Curry Powder. i oz. Butter. 

X teaspoon of Sugar. 3 Onions sliced and browned in butter or 

\ teaspoon of Salt. fat. 

The fowl must not be more than twelve months old, 
and must be killed the day before cooking. Cut it into 
small joints. Mix the onions with the curry powder, 
vinegar, salt, sugar, and butter, into a paste ; lay on the 
chicken. Cover the pot and let it simmer, or stew gently, 
for an hour, then stir well. If dry add a little water. A 
tablespoon of tomato sauce or lemon in half a cup of milk, 
stirred in shortly before serving, is an improvement, but it 
will be found excellent without. Serve with boiled rice. 
Sufficient as an entriefor six or eight people. 

Some people fry the meat and onion together till 
brown ; but from experience I find it best to do the onions 
first, and then let all steam with the chicken. 



CURRY {CUCUMBER). 
(A Cape Dish.) 

Take four large cucumbers that are turning yellow ; 
peel carefully (be particular that no bitter be left), take

with forcemeat, made as follows : one pound of mutton 
(fresh or cold) minced, one slice of bread soaked in milk, 
one ^^g, a little salt and pepper, a dessertspoonful of 
curry powder. Mix well together, stuff the cucumber with 
this. Then take two large onions, fry a nice brown ; make 
a paste of curry powder one ounce, one teaspoonful of 
sugar, one tablespoonful of vinegar, a cup of stock, a good 
tablespoonful of dripping (butter is better) ; simmer in a flat 
stewing-pot. Arrange the stuffed cucumber in this, and 
let it simmer on a moderate heat for two hours. Serve 
with boiled rice, (This is a very nic? mtr^f or lunch dish.)

2 teaspoonfuis of Sugar. teaspoonful of Indian Currie Paste). 

Cut the mutton in nice little pieces. Fry the mutton 
and onion a nice brown, cut the apple or tomato in slices, 
mix with curry powder and other ingredients ; stir all well 
together. If the meat is lean a small piece of butter is an 
improvement. Simmer for two hours gently. Serve with 
boiled rice. Cold meat cut in slices, and simmered in this 
mixture of curry, etc., for two hours, does very well. 



CURRY {ANOTHER MUTTON). 
(This was taught me by an Indian Cook.) 

Take three pounds of mutton out of the leg ; cut into 
small, square pieces, and put into the pot. Slice up a 
large onion thinly ; put that on the top of the meat. Now 
make a paste of two tablespoonfuls of curry powder, one 
tablespoonful of brown sugar, two tablespoonfuls of vinegar. 
If apples are in season, slice up two or three and add to it. 
Stir all together, and put this on the top of the sliced 
onions. Shut up the pot ; let it simmer gently. No water 
to be added. After an hour, stir all well together. Let it 
simmer gently another hour. Just before' serving, if it 
should be dry, add half a cup of milk and a tablespoonful 
of tomato sauce. Serve with rice. 



CURRY {VEGETABLE). 

Chop four onions and four apples, put them in a pan 
with a quarter of a pound of butter, let them fry a light

of the fire till quite seasoned. Whisk the eggs well, bring 
the milk to a boiling point, then strain into a basin. 
When it has cooled a little, stir in the eggs. Strain this 
mixture into a jug; place this jug in a saucepan of boiling 
water over the fire ; keep stirring the custard one way until 
it thickens, but on no account allow it to reach boiling 
point, or it will curdle and be full of lumps. Take it off 
the fire, stir in a wineglass of brandy (if liked). Time — 
half an hour to infuse lemon-peel, or flavouring ; about 
ten minutes to stir the custard. Sufficient for eight glasses

q CUTLETS— LAMB CUTLETS-CUTLETS (STEWED). 



CUTLETS. 

Trim your cutlets carefully ; lay them in a little milk, 
which makes the meat white and tender. (Fresh meat 
laid for five or six hours in a little milk will be found nice 
and tender.) Have ready some fine bread-crumbs, nutmeg, 
pepper, salt, lard, or dripping. 

Roll the cutlets in egg and bread-crumbs, sprinkle with 
pepper, salt, and nutmeg, fry in hot lard. Serve with

DUMPLINGS (RICE). [V 



When cool, beat up the three eggs into it. Boil the other 
half-bottle of milk, and take with a teaspoon little pieces 
of the dough ; put them into the milk, and boil for a 
quarter of an hour. 

A delicious old-fashioned German dish was made in 
the following way : A young fowl, cut in small joints, was 
fried with some butter and sliced onion to a nice brown ; 
about a pint of water was added w/ten brown, and some red 
chillies. In this gravy was stirred some of the above Milk 
Kluitjes a few minutes before serving. 

DUMPLINGS (RICE). 
(Very old Cape Recipe. Cape name, " Rys Kluitjes.") 

Ingredients. 

I lb. Rice. 3 dessertspoonfuls Melted Butter. 

3 Eggs. Sugar. 

3 spoonfuls Flour. Scnamon. 

Boil the rice as if for curry, only not quite so dry ; let 
It cool ; mix with flour, eggs, and butter ; roll in sugar- 
loaf shapes (about eight or nine from this quantity), dust 
with flour, and put into boiling water. When done, it 
rises to the top. Serve with sugar and cinnamon. Time 
about ten minutes. 

In most Cape Dutch houses this dish is eaten with 
meat, and generally made when a corned brisket of beef 
is boiled. Instead of mixing melted butter with the rice, 
some of the fat is taken from the stock in which the beef 
is boiling ; and when the dumplings are ready, the meat is 
taken out about ten minutes before dinner, and the 
dumplings are boiled in the stock, and served with sugar. 
Whether from the German or Dutch, most colonists who 
are not of English parentage are very fond of sweet things 
with meat — such as stewed fruit, sweet potatoes, or parsnips 
done with sugar.

E] EGGS (ITALIAN— POACHED— SCRATCHED). 



EGGS {ITALIAN). 
(Mrs. Fleming's Recipe.) 

Hard-boiled eggs, cut in two, the yolks to be taken 
out, minced, and mixed with very finely minced cooked 
bacon, and some chopped parsley; put back into the 
whites arranged on a dish. Serve with mayonnaise 
dressing. To be eaten cold. 



EGGS (POACHED). 

Eggs for poaching should be fresh, but not new-laid, 
or the whites will not set. A stale egg will not poach. 
The best are about thirty-six hours old. Strain boiling 
water into a deep, clean frying-pan. Break the tgg into 
a cup, without damaging the yolk. When the water boils, 
gently slip the egg into it. Keep the water gently 
simmering till the white looks nicely set ; take up gently 
with a slice. Serve on toasted bread or slices of ham 
on spinach. (In slipping the egg into the water keep 
the cup over it for half a minute, so as to gather the 
whites together.) In doing eggs in a frying-pan never 
do more than four or five at a time. If liked, mix one 
tablespoonful of vinegar in the water in which you poach, 
one pint for an ordinary-sized frying-pan. Time, two and 
a half or three and a half minutes. 



EGGS (SCRATCHED). 
(A favourite Colonial breakfast dish.) 

Take five or six eggs, whisk them well together ,- take 
a dessertspoonful of butter in a frying-pan, let it get quite 
hot. Stir in the eggs ; keep stirring briskly over the fire till 
done. Serve on hot buttered toast with pepper and salt.

EGGS {SNOWy. 

Ingredients. 

4 Eggs. Sugar to taste. 

I pint Milk. Vanilla Bean, or Essence. 

Make a rich custard of the yolks; then whisk the 
whites. Flavour with vanilla and sweeten. Take a 
tablespoonful at a time of the white froth and drop into 
boiling milk, turning carefully ; then take it out and 
put it on a glass dish — go on till you have done all. 
Now pour the rich custard into the dish, not over the snow. 
This makes a pretty, cool-looking supper dish.

3 tablespoonfuls of Flour. The Whites of 2 Eggs. 

The Yolks of 4 Eggs. Hot Lard, or Clarified Dripping. 

Put the flour in a basin, and mix with it enough boiling 
water to make a stiff paste ; stir all the time, to prevent 
its getting lumpy. Let it cool a little, then break into it 
the yolks of four eggs and the whites of two ; stir all well 
together. Have ready some boiling lard or clarified 
dripping ; drop a dessertspoonful of batter at a time, and 
fry the fritters a light brown. They should rise like balls. 
Time, five or eight minutes to fry. Sufficient for four or 
five people.

spoonful of carbonate of soda, a little pounded ginger, 
about a cupful of thick milk ; mix into a nice smooth 
paste. Have ready some boiling lard or clarified dripping, 
and drop in the paste ; each small spoonful will rise into a 
ball Serve hot, with sugar and lemon. 

FRITTERS {ORANGE). 

Mix with eight ounces of flour two ounces of butter, then 
add one pint of water, then the whites of two eggs, to make 
a batter. Peel three large oranges, cut across, and take 
out seeds, cut in slices, dip each slice into the thick batter,

F] FRITTERS (PUMPKIN)— FRUIT (BOTTLED)— FISH. 



FRITTERS {PtIMPKIN). 

Stew a sweet pumpkin; when soft, add a few ounces 
of flour to thicken it. For two cups of pumpkin take a 
jood slice of white bread, soaked in milk and squeezed 
lery dry. Mix well together with a pinch of salt, some 
cinnamon, and a quarter of a teaspoonful of carbonate 
of soda and two eggs. Fry in boiling fat. Serve hot, 
with sugar and cinnamon. 



FRUIT {BOTTLED). 
(Mrs. Rose Innes' Recipe.) 

Ingredients. 

I bIU of Water. i gill of Sugar to every lb. of Fmit. 

Mason's jars (with screw tops). 

Take the proportions of sugat and water, and boil. 
When boiling, put in the fresh ripe fruit you intend 
bottling ; let it boil till tender, and bottle at once. The 
jars must be hot, and filled to overflowing, and closed at 
once. Have your bottles in a saucepan on the stove, side 
by side with the fruit you are preparing, so as to ensure 
their being hot when the fruit is ready; laying the jars 
on a little straw in the saucepan, in cold water, and allow- 
ing the water to boil. Place the jars on soup-plates (as 
they are to overflow), so that the syrup is not wasted. 
Fruit done in this way will keep over two years. 

The moment apricots ^nd plums boil up they are 
ready ; also mulberries and gooseberries ; but peaches, 
apples, quinces, guavas, require a longer time. 

The bottled fruit is very good eaten with cream, 
when a little more sugar may be added if wanted. 

[Note to Recipe for "Engelegte Fish" on p. 7a]

fresh red chillies, three dozen coriander seeds, half an 
ounce of ground ginger, a few lemon leaves, one ounce of 
sugar, one quart of good vinegar. Let these ingredients 
boil up well. Then take the fillets of fish (which have 
been previously fried a nice brown colour in lard, and well 
drained), and put them carefully into the boiling mixture 
of curry, and just let it boil up. This ensures its keeping 
for months if well corked in small jars. At the Cape the 
best fish for pickling are "Kabeljon," "Geelbeck," "Roman," 
etc 

[Note to Recipe for " Flavouring Mixture '' on p. 72.] 
(A German Marinade for flavouring Fish. Miss Becker's Recipe.)

Boil this mixture well ; strain and let the fish simmer 
in it and get cold in it ; then remove the fish and lay on a 
dish nicely drained. Pour over it any Mayonnaise sauce, 
when wanted as a supper or lunch dish. It should be 
done before so as to be cold ; garnish with finely-chopped 
parsley, radish, lemon, or beetroot. 

The tail end of the "Stockfish" or "Kabeljon" or 
" Geelbeck " done in this way is very good. It is also a 
very nice way of cooking salmon.

GESMOORDE HOENDER. 
(An old-fashioned Entree, from a Malay Recipe. Mrs. D. Cloe'c.) 

Ingredients, 

A young Fowl. White Pepper. 

2 large White Onions. A Green Chilli, 

A little Nutmeg. Salt, 

3 oz. Batter. 

Fry your onions a golden brown in some butter or fat. 
Then cut the chicken in nice little joints, let them brown

When cool add a tablespoonful of yeast on toast. Let it 
stand for twelve hours. Strain through a coarse cloth and 
bottle, tying the corks down. The white of one egg well 
beaten, and added just before corking, is a great improve- 
ment for using soon. Three days will do. 



GRAPES IN BRANDY. 
(Mrs. Cloete's Recipe.) 

Take nice ripe Hanepot grapes, cut them with a piece 
of the stalk, prick with a steel pin ; fill a jar. Then take 
VERY thick syrup, previously boiled, two cups of syrup to 
one of good spirits of wine. Fill the jars, cover well ; tie 
down with bladder. 

GRAPE yAM. 
(Home Recipe.) 

Ingredients. 
4 lb. Fruit. I lb. Sugar. 

Carefully pick the grapes from the bunches, prick with 
a steel pin. Boil a syrup of the sugar, put the grapes into 
the boiling syrup. Some sliced apple or quince may be 
added to the grapes, for every pound of quince one of 
sugar, some cut-up orange-peel. Boil rather quickly at 
first. Take some of the preserve and lay it on a saucer to 
cool to see if it is ready; if so it will jelly. 

Another very nice way of making grape jam is to take 
the "Hanepot" grape before it is quite sweet and ripe, 
then take equal parts of sugar and fruit, pick from the 
bunches, and put into a preserving-pan with a few cups of

water, and allow the grapes to stew for half an hour. 
Skim off all the seeds, add the sugar (and if you like, a 
few pounds of sliced stewing apples), let all boil briskly, 
stirring constantly with a wooden spoon. If done in small 
quantities (not more than six pounds) it does not take 
more than two hours, and becomes quite like a jelly when 
done. 

GRATED CHEESE AND CAULIFLOWER. 
(" Chouxfleurs au Gratin." Miss Leisching.) 

Ingreditnts. 

A fine head of Cauliflower. The yolk of i Egg. 

4 tablespoons of Cream or Milk. 2 oz. of Fine Bread-crumbs. 

A few slices of Onion, chopped fine, i saltspoonful of Salt. 

2 oz. of mild Cheese, grated. Haifa saltspoonful of Pepper and Cayenne. 

Boil the milk with the chopped onion, then add the 
grated cheese (keeping a little for sprinkling afterwards), 
let it boil up ; draw it aside and add gradually the yolk of 
the egg, pepper, salt, cayenne, and bread-crumbs. Mix all 
thoroughly, keep nice and warm, and pour over the cauli- 
flower, which should be ready (having been previously 
boiled nice and tender in a saucepan of water with the 
head downwards, leaving the pot open); break the cauli- 
flower into neat little pieces (remove all green and stalk), 
pour the mixture over the cauliflower on a baking-dish, 
and then on the top a little more bread-crumbs and grated 
cheese. Bake for a few minutes in the oven, and serve with 
cutlets. 

Vegetable Marrows done in this way are very good. 

GRAVY {A GOOD). 
(For Mutton, Beef, Game, or Poultry.) 

When the roast is well done, remove all the fat from

of maizena to it. Stir well, and let it thicken, and serve 
with your joint.

HAMS \H0W to cure THEM)- 
(Proved by long experience to be an excellent Recipt.) 

After cutting the hams, rough-salt them for a night, 
letting all the water drain away. 

For a ham weighing twelve or fourteen pounds take as 
follows : two pounds of salt, one pound brownest sugar, 
two ounces saltpetre, four ounces black pepper, four ounces 
allspice, and a handful of coriander seeds. Bruise the 
spices and saltpetre, mix all well with the salt, and have the 
ham rubbed well with the hand and a little fiat stone for half 
an hour every day for three days, till the skin feels soft, and 
the salt, etc., looks like a creamy substance. In rubbing 
divide the salt, sugar, etc., into portions, and take a fresh 
portion every time, taking care to turn the ham skin 
downwards, and cover with the salt, etc. When all has 
been used, and the ham rubbed three days, take all the 
brine that has formed and boil it with two pints of vinegar 
and two pints of good ale. Skim it well, and when cool 
poui* over the ham, leaving it in this pickle for a month.' 
Then dry it, put under a press, brush with a little tar 
mixed with treacle and some bran. Smoke for three 
weeks, and hang in a cool, dry place. 

The above pickle does beautifully for sides of bacon, 
or any other pork that has to be smoked. 

When wanted for use, before boiling soak the ham for 
a night, simmer gently for three or four hours. Let your 
water boil before putting in the ham, and then gently 
simmer.

too large ; dredge with flour, and fry in butter a nice brown ; 
then put into a stewing-pan with the herbs, onions, cloves, 
allspice, pepper, and lemon-peel j cover with hot water, 
and when it boils carefully remove all the scum, and 
let it simmer gently till tender (which will be in about 
one hour and three-quarters if the hare is old). Then 
take out the pieces of hare, thicken the gravy with flour 
and butter, add the ketchup and port wine, let it boil 
ten minutes ; strain through a sieve on the pieces of hare. 
Let it simmer for two minutes, so as to be nice and warm. 
A few forcemeat balls {see Forcemeat Recipe) stewed 
in the gravy ten minutes before dishing, is an improve- 
ment. Serve with quince or red currant jelly.

TO STOP BLEEDING FROM THE NOSK. 

A teaspoonful of cream of tartar in a tumbler of water, 
taken, will almost immediately stop the bleeding. 



FOR BRUISES OR SPRAINS. 

Bathe with hot water as soon as it can possibly be 
procured, and as hot as can be borne. Go on for an hour 
or more. 

FOR BURNS AND SCALDS. 

Common whiting mixed with water to the consistency 
of cream, spread on linen, laid over the part scalded or 
burnt, gives instantaneous relief. To be kept moist by 
occasional sprinkling. 

Another excellent remedy is the following : Take equal 
quantities of lime water and raw linseed oil, mix well 
together, and rub over the scald or burn. Lime water is 
made by mixing three tablespoonfuls of lime with a quart 
of boiling water. Shake well, and let it stand for a day or 
two. Pour off when clear, and mix with linseed oil in 
equal quantities. Keep in readiness. No house ought ever 
to be without it. 

FOR CHAPPED HANDS. 

(A Country Remedy. Bessie's.) 
Take equal quantities of glycerine, castor oil, spirits of 
wine (tablespoonful of each), ditto goat lard (buck fat) ; a 
piece of beeswax the size of a walnut, half an ounce of 
camphor (dissolved in eau de cologne and spirits of wine), 
the juice of a lemon. Melt the beeswax and goat lard, 
stir with the castor oil, then the glycerine ; then remove 
from the fire, stir in the camphor (dissolved in the spirits 
of wine), then the spoonful of eau de cologne, and lastly 
the juice of the lemon. Stir all well together till quite 
cold. Put into pomade pots. Will keep for years.

FOR CAPE DISTEMPER IN DOGS. 

(Homoeopathic.) 
One dot of nux vomica once a week regularly before the 
dog shows symptoms of the disease. Young dogs generally 
get it early in the spring. When the disease shows — 
which will be perceived by the gums being white, and the 
eyes weak, and the dog has no appetite — give one dot or 
drop of the tincture of nux three times a day for three 
days. Then give arsenicum three times a day, one dot or 
drop ; then pulsatilla, one dot three times a day. The 
dog to be kept very warm ; fed on lukewarm water and 
brown bread. If he is very weak, give beef tea three times 
a day. 

KOR ECZEMA — A SIMPLE CURE. 

Take equal proportions of glycerine and castor oil, stir

Four drops of sulphuric acid in a wineglass of water 
three or four times a day. 

I have heard that burning equal quantities of tar and 
turpentine (about two tablespoonfuls of each in a tin 
cup or pan) in the room of the patient suffering from 
diphtheria gives great relief. 

Families living far from medical aid should always 
keep Swedish tar, turpentine, and sulphuric acid in their 
houses. 

FOR DIPHTHERIC THROAT— GARGLE. 

A few drops oi a strong solution of permanganate of 
potash, in water, make an excellent gargle.

some ginger, and cinnamon, on a quart bottle of the best 
brandy ; let it stand in the sun, or by the fire, for a few 
days, till all the goodness is drawn out of the spices. 

Dose for an adult, one teaspoonful ; for a child, ten 
drops in wineglass of water ; or dropped on hot flannel, 
and applied externally, it will be found very effectual also.

ICING FOR CAKES. 
(Mrs. D. Cloete's Recipe.) 

Ingredients. 
t lb. Icing Sugar. Whites of 3 Egga 

Whisk the eggs to a stiff froth and gradually sift in the 
sugar. Beat the mixture well, until the sugar is smooth ; 
then with a broad knife lay the icing equally over the 
cake, laying on one layer first, and allowing it to get firm 
in a cool oven before you put on the next layer, and so on. 
The icing may be coloured with a little cochineal or 
currant juice. Spinach juice gives a nice green colour. 
For a sponge cake the icing may be flavoured with orange 
or vanilla. Dry the icing in a cool oven before sending to 
table. 

For ornamental icing put layer of white sugar icing 
first, then mix a little cochineal with some icing. Make 
a kind of cornucopia of paper, leaving a small hole at the 
bottom; fill with the red icing, and press it out at the 
hole, when it can be guided into patterns or raised in 
dots, etc. Or ornamental squeezers can be got at iron- 
mongers' for this purpose. For a sponge cake flavoured 
with orange, it makes a nice change to put a layer of 
marmalade over the cake, and the icing, also flavoured 
with orange, over that

J] JELLY (ANOTHER ASPIC— BLACKBERRY). 



JELLY {ANOTHER ASPIC OR SAVOURY). 

Ingredients. 

1 Calf's Foot. I blade of Mace. 
6oz. ofHatn. lo Peppercorns. 

2 lb. of VeaL Whites of 2 Eggs. 

I Large Carrot. i teaspoonful of Tarragon Vinegar. 

1 Small Onion. 1 spoonful of Isinglass. 

I bunch of Sweet Herbs. Hajf a gallon of Water, 

Put about six ounces of ham, two pounds of knuckle of 
veal, and a calf's foot (with the bone broken) into a stew- 
pan, with one large carrot, a small onion, and a bunch of 
sweet herbs. Boil it until reduced to one quart ; strain it 
through a sieve. When cold, skim off all the fat, and put 
the jelly into a stewpan with the whites of two eggs (well 
whisked), and a teaspoonful of Tarragon vinegar, and a 
spoonful of isinglass. Stir it until on the point of boiling, 
then draw it to the side, and let it simmer gently for nearly 
twenty minutes. Let it stand to settle, and then pour it 
through a jelly-bag until quite clear, when it will be fit to

JELLY {BLACKBERRY), IN A MOULD. 
(Mrs. Jackson's Recipe.) 

Ingredients. 

2 lb. of Blackberries. J lb. of White Sugar. 

\ oz. Gelatine. 

Extract the juice from the fruit by putting in the oven 
in a jar for a few hours ; strain through a muslin bag 
placed over a cullender, or strainer. Soak half an ounce 
of gelatine in a little water ; add to the blackberry juice, 
with a quarter of a pound of sugar ; boil all for half an 
hour. Put into a wet mould ; turn out next day ; serve 
with cream. This will do for mulberries, only taking more 
sugar.

JELLY (CALVES' FOOT)— FRUIT IN JELLY. [J 



JELLY (CALVES' FOOT). 

Take four calves' feet, slit them in two, take away the 
fat from between the claws, wash them well in lukewarm 
water, then put them in a large stewpan, and cover them 
with water. When the liquor boils, skim it well, and let 
it boil gently six or seven hours, that it may be reduced to 
about two quarts, then strain it through a sieve, and skim 
all the oily substance which is on the surface of the liquor. 
If you are not in a hurry, it is better to boil the calves' 
feet the day before you make the jelly, as, when the liquor 
is cold, the oily part being at the top, and the other being 
firm, you may remove every particle of the oily substance 
without wasting any of the liquor with pieces of kitchen 
paper applied to it. Put the liquor into a stewpan to 
melt, with a pound of lump sugar-, the peel of two lemons, 
and the juice of six, the whites and shells of six eggs 
(beat together), and a bottle of sherry or madeira. Whisk 
the whole together until it is on the boil, then put it at the 
side of the stove, and let it simmer a quarter of an hour. 
Strain it through a jelly-bag ; what is strained _^rst must 
be poured into the bag again, until it is as bright and as 
clear as spring water. Then put the jelly into moulds to 
get cold and firm. When it is required to be very stiff, 
half an ounce of isinglass may be added when the wine is 
put in. It may be flavoured by the juice of various fruits, 
etc., or spices, and coloured with saffron, etc. 

N.B. — Ten sheep's trotters, which may be bought for 
twopence-halfpenny, will give as much jelly as a calf's 
foot, which costs a shilling. 

JELLY (FRUIT IN). 

Put an inch of jelly into a mould ; when set, arrange 
any fruit you like. Put spoonfuls of jelly in between, to 
keep it in place. It must be done slowly, allowing the 
jelly to set before adding the fruit. Fill up with jelly. It 
is an improvement to steep the fruit in maraschino, or 
brandy, before putting into the jelly.

J] JELLY (GUAVA— MEDLAR— QUINCE). 



JELLY (GUAVA). 
(Mrs. Hiddingh's Recipe.) 

Take nice ripe guavas, peel them, cut them through, 
and just cover them with water. When quite soft, pour 
them into a large, coarse bag, something like a jelly-bag; 
leave it to drain all night Next day, convert into jelly by 
adding to every two cups of the juice, when it boils, one 
cup of sugar. Boil briskly till the consistency of jelly. 
Pour a little into a tumbler of cold water ; if it does not 
mix with the water, it is ready to be poured into moulds 
or jars. 

JELLY (MEDLAR). 
(A Swellendam Recipe.) 

Let the medlars be quite soft ; cut ofif the tops, put in 
a preserving-pan, cover with water, boil six or eight hours 
slowly, strain through a coarse sieve. To every pint of 
juice add one pound of sugar. Boil over a quick fire, 
stirring all the time. When it thickens, drop on a plate ; 
if it Jellies it is done. Or drop into a tumbler of cold 
water ; if it does not mix with the water it is good. This 
jelly is delicious, and ought to be a clear amber colour. 



JELLY (QUINCE). 
(Mrs. Cloete's, of Constantia, Recipe.) 

Take about twenty-five quinces, wipe them clean, cut 
in quarters, lay in a large preserving-pot, cover with water 
(about six quarts to twenty-five quinces) ; boil till quite 
soft, then strain through a thin cloth or coarse milk 
strainer. To three cups of juice take two of white sugar ; 
boil in small quantities on a brisk fire. When it begins to 
get thick, pour a little into a tumbler of water ; and if it 
congeals, and does not mix with the water, it is ready to 
be put into moulds or cups. Cover with paper dipped in 
brandy, and keep in a dry place. Will keep for years.

come to blood heat ; flavour with a tablespoonful of Vander- 
hum (or rum), one tablespoonful of rennet. Stir well, and 
pour into a glass dish, which stand in a tin of warm water, 
so that the mixture remains lukewarm for half an hour, in 
which time it will become quite firm. Whisk up half a pint 
of cream with sugar and pour over the junket before 
serving.

KIDNEYS {BROILED). 
(For Breakfast.) 

Take four sheep's kidneys ; with a sharp knife cut each 
kidney open lengthways down to the root, but do not 
separate them ; skin them, and put a small skewer under 
the white part of each to keep them flat. Make the grid- 
iron warm and rub it over with butter ; place the kidneys 
with the inside downwards, and broil them over a clear fire. 
When sufficiently done on one side, turn on the other. 
Remove the skewers, season with pepper and salt, put a 
little piece of butter in the centre of each, and serve on

LIQUEUR {ORANGE). 
(Mrs. Myberg Elsinberg. Old Dutch Recipe.) 

Ingredients. 

5 bottles of Brandy. 4 lb. of white Loaf Sugar. 

9 sweet Oranges (Peel and Juice). A few sticks of Cinnamon. 

Cut four incisions in the oranges and squeeze them 
slightly, then let all soak together for ten days, then bottle.

L] LIQUEUR (ANOTHER ORANGE— VANDERHUM). 



UQUEUR (ANOTHER ORANGE). 

(Old country.) 

Peel very thinly ten oranges and ten lemons. Put the 

peel on four bottles of good Cape brandy, add four pounds 

of white sugar. Let it stand for eight or ten days, stirring 

every day, morning and evening. Strain and bottle. 

LIQUEUR {VANDERHUM). 
(Mrs. Cloete. Another old Recipe.) 
Dissolve three pounds ol cai«died sugar in six bottles of 
good brandy (best Cango will do). Then mix with it one 
hundred cloves, a quarter of a pound of cinnamon, twelve 
tablespoonfuls of finely-cut naartje-peel, one nutmeg, a 
few cardamom seeds. Let it all stand for a month and 
a half, shaking occasionally, then bottle. Clarify through 
filtering papers. The brandy should not be weaker than 
twenty-two degrees, or the liqueur will not be clear. Also 
good. 

LIQUEUR (VANDERHUM). 
(Old Recipe. Cape SpicialiU.) 

Ingredients. 

lo bottles of Brandy. 50 Cloves. 

10 dessertspoonfuls of Cinnamon just so tabiespoonfals of findy-eut Naartje- 
bruised. PeeL 

Half a Nutmeg. 

Mix all well together, and allow the ingredients to 
remain on the brandy for one month till all the virtue is 
extracted from it. Then take five pounds of clear light 
brown crystallised sugar, boil to a thick, rich syrup. When 
quite cold, mix one cup of syrup to two of the spiced 
brandy, stir well till quite mixed. Add one wineglass of 
best rum to every bottle of Vanderhum. The rum mellows 
the mixture. Put all back into a cask, and clarify with 
the whites of two eggs well whisked, and lightly put on 
the top of the cask. In three weeks it will be beautifully 
clear and ready for bottling. If made in small quantities, 
the brandy and spices can be put in jars well corked, and 
the spices in little bags. Very good.

LOAF (TO FRESHEN A STALE)— LOQUAT JAM. fL 



LOAF {TO FRESHEN A STALE). 

Dip quickly into cold water, and put into a moderately 
warm oven for twenty minutes. This quite freshens any 
loaf. 

LOQUAT JAM. 
(Frances Cloete.) 

Jngredients. 
6 lb. of Fraft. 8 lb. of White Crystallised Sugsr. 

Peel and stone the loquats ; put into the preserving- 
pan in layers. Boil quickly for three hours. If the fruit 
is nice and ripe, take equal quantities of sugar.

M. 

MACAROONS. 

fMrs. Myburgh. A very old Dutch Recipfe) 

Take one pound of almonds, blanched and pounded, 
and one pound of sugar. Melt the sugar and almonds 
over the fire till quite a tough jelly. Then have ready 
the whites of four eggs beaten to a froth, whip together 
when cold. This way of melting the sugar and almonds 
is excellent, as it prevents the macaroons from running 
together in the tins. Dust some fine cinnamon over. The 
old-fashioned way was to put a small piece of citron pre- 
serve on every cake. When pounding the almonds add a 
spoonful of rose-water. 



MACAROONS {ANOTHER RECIPE), 
(Mrs. J. Cloete's.) 

Ingredients. 

I lb. Almonds blaached and pounded. The Whites of 4 Eggs. 
I lb. sifted Sugar. i teaspoonful of Cinnamon. 

Blanch and pound the almonds, adding a little rose- 
water while pounding. Mix with the sugar, which should 
be slightly warmed, then stir the whites of the eggs well 
whisked. Butter a paper and lay it on a baking-pan; with 
a fork put small lumps of the paste on the paper. Bake 
in a moderately slow oven for twenty minutes. A small 
piece of candied citron stuck into each little cSkke is a great 
improvement. Very good, 

139 



M] MARMALADE (APRICOT— ORANGE— SCOTCH). 



MARMALADE OR CHEESE (APRICOT). 
(Cape. Mrs. Henry Cloete's Recipe.) 

Two hundred apricots, wiped and cut into pieces, their 
weight in sugar. Slightly wipe the preserving-pan with 
Lucca oil. Put in the apricots, let them boil to a pulp, 
stirring all the time. Then add the sugar; stir well. 
Let the whole boil briskly till a clear golden brown. It 
is ready to dish when in passing a spoon through the 
mixture it opens dry from the pot as it were. Put into 
moulds or basins; keeps beautifully. Some of the pips 
blanched, and cut up in the marmalade, is liked by some 
people. Six pounds is a nice quantity to boil at a time. 
Use an enamelled or copper preserving-pan ; it will take 
about two hours altogether to preserve. 



MARMALADE {ORANGE). 
(Mrs. Shaw's Recipe.) 

Ingredients. 

le large Oranges. 13 pints of Water. 

8 lb. Sugar. 

Cut. the oranges in thin slices, and then soak in water 
twenty-four hours. Then add the sugar, and boil until 
it becomes a jelly. 

Lemons may be done in the same way. 



MARMALADE {SCOTCH). 
(Mrs. Etheridge's Redpe.) 

Ingredients. 
6 lb. of Seville or Bitter Orange. 13 lb. of Sugar. 

Scrape or grate the peel slightly; put the oranges 

into a stewpan ; cover them with cold water. Boil gently 

for two hours, keeping them well under water with a 

plate on the top. When quite soft take them out and 

140 



MAYONNAISE— "MEBOS." [M 



drain, open them, and take out the seeds. Cut the peel 
and pulp all together in thin strips (some people mince 
everything through a mincing-machine). For every pound 
of fruit, weighed after being boiled, take two of sugar, and 
one pint of the water the oranges were boiled in. Boil all 
together for half an hour, and pour the marmalade boiling 
hot into jars. 



MARMALADE. — See also JAMS and Preserves. 

MA YONNAISE. 
(Mrs. Fleming's Recipe.) 

Ingredients. 

• Eggs. I teaspoonrul of Sugar, Mustard, 

Some Lucca Oil. Cayenne. 

2 lablespoonfuls of Vmegac Some cold Chicken. 

I teaspoonful of Salt. a tablespoonfuls of Cream. 

First prepare the following mayonnaise mixture : Beat 
the yolks of two eggs well ; add gradually drop by 
drop Lucca oil, until it is worked into a stiff ball, then 
gradually add the vinegar, salt, mustard, and cayenne, 
until the sauce is thin enough to pour over the meat the 
consistency of cream. At the last moment before pouring 
over the meat, add two tablespoonfuls of cream. SufBcient 
for one mayonnaise. 

Remove all the meat from the bones, put into a pie- 
dish. Pour over it about a dessertspoonful of oil, a table- 
spoonful of vinegar, a teaspoonful of chopped onions, and 
some parsley, pepper, and salt. Leave this for half an 
hour. Remove the meat from this when you want to 
arrange the mayonnaise. Put alternate layers of meat, 
lettuce, beetroot on a dish, pouring the mayonnaise mix- 
ture over each layer. Garnish with hard-boiled eggs, 
olives, anchovies. A few capers are an improvement. (See 
§AUCES for other recipes for Mayonnaise dressing.)

M] MERINGUES— MINCEMEAT. 



MtRINGUES. 
(Mrs. D. Cloete's Recipe.) 

Ingredients. 
\ lb. of Sifted Sugar. The Whites of 4 Eggs. 

Whisk the whites of the eggs to a stiff froth, and with 
a wooden spoon stir quickly the sugar in the whites. 
Have ready some thin wooden boards, cut strips of paper 
two inches wide. Place the paper on the board, and drop 
a tablespoonful of the mixture on the paper, taking care 
to let all the mdringues be of the same size. In dropping 
it off the spoon, give them the shape of an t^g (if a 
tablespoonful is taken and carefully turned over, it is egg- 
shaped). Keep them two inches apart. Strew over them 
sifted sugar, and bake in a moderate oven for half an 
hour. As they begin to colour, take them out of the oven. 
Take each slip of paper by the two ends, and turn it 
gently on the table, and with a small spoon take out 
the soft part of the meringue. Spread some clean papers 
on the board, turn the meringues upside down, and put 
them into the oven again to harden and brown on the 
other side. If kept in a dry place they will keep for 
weeks. When required for table, fill them with whipped 
cream flavoured with liqueur (Vanderhum) and vanilla. 
Join two of the mdringues together, and pile them high 
on the dish. Great quickness is required in making 
meringues, for if they are not put into the oven as soon as 
they are mixed the sugar melts. The sweeter the meringues 
are made the crisper they will be ; they are sometimes 
coloured with cochineal. This quantity will make two 
dozen. 

MINCEMEAT. 

Ingredients. 

I lb. Beef SueL J lb. Candied PeeL 

I lb. Stoned Raisins cut in half. i teaspoonful of Salt. 

1 lb. Currants. 2 oz. Scotch Marmalade.

"MOSS BOLLETyES." 

(An old Dutch Recipe. From Mrs. Moorries.) 

Ingredients. 
2 lb. of Raisins. li lb. Butter. 

i6 lb. Flour. I lb. Fat. 

si lb. Sugar. 2 tablespoonruls AntsecA 

8 Eggs. 2 Nutmegs grated. 

I tabIesp«onful Cinnamon very finely pounded. 

" Moss Bolletje " — so called from " Moss," juice of the 
grape in its first stages of fermentation, and " Bolletje," a 
bun. During the wine-making season the freshly fermented 
grape-juice is commonly used instead of yeast by the 
country people at Stellenbosch, French Hoek, etc., and 
very nice buns, etc., are made of it. When grapes are not 
to be had we take raisins, as in following recipe, and put 
them in a jar which is previously seasoned by having had 
fermented raisins or grapes in it. This jar is not washed 
with water, but generally dried in the sun and kept closely 
covered from dust, and only used for making the " moss " 
in, as one is so much surer of its fermenting in a given 
time if made in a seasoned jar or calabash. 

Cut the raisins or mince them, put them into a jar or 
calabash, with twelve cups of lukewarm water, on the stove 
or warmest part of your kitchen for twenty-four hours, 
till they ferment. Have ready the flour, in which, after 
being well mixed with the sugar, spices, etc., make a

hole ; into this strain the fermented juice of the raisins. 
Sprinkle some flour over the top, and set to rise for 
some hours in a warm place. Then melt the butter and 
fat, warm the milk, whisk the eight eggs, yolks and 
whites separately. Mix the whole well together into a 
stiff dough, knead with the hand for quite three-quarters 
of an hour, let it stand over-night to rise. In the morning 
roll into buns, set in buttered pans in a warm place, let 
them rise for half an hour. Brush with the yolk of an egg, 
and some milk and sugar. Bake for half an hour in an 
oven heated as for bread. To dry, cut into two or three 
when cold, and put into a cool oven over-night. Very 
good. 

MUSHROOMS (^FRIED). 
Take large " flap " mushrooms, peel carefully ; fry in a 
pan, with pepper and salt, in boiling lard or butter, and 
serve on toast very hot. (As a vegetable or as a breakfast

MUTTON CHOPS. 
(A favourite Cape dish.) 

Cut some nice chops, either from a loin or neck of 
mutton that has been well hung; beat them well with a 
wooden kitchen mallet ; then dip in boiling fat or lard, 
then in bread-crumbs (made by drying stale bread in an 
oven, and pounding it, and keeping ready for use), or fine 
biscuit, some pepper and salt. Have ready your gridiron, 
well heated on wood coals ; lay your chops on this, and 
broil a nice brown over a quick fire, turning occasionally. 
Serve with a mould of mashed potatoes or tomato sauce. 
Very good. 

Pork chops done in the same way are very good. 

MUTTON CHOPS IN BATTER. 
(A Colonial Recipe.) 
Cut from a tender leg of mutton (uncooked), or loin, 
nice little slices. Season with pepper, salt, and a little 
nutmeg. Dip in a batter made of half a pint of milk, 
three tablespoonfuls of flour, and two eggs (if eggs are 
scarce, flour mixed with thick milk and half a teaspoonful 
of carbonate of soda makes a very light, nice batter). Fry 
io hot dripping or lard, as you would a cutlet 

MUTTON CHOPS IN BATTER {ANOTHER IVAY\ 
(tor Cold Mutton.) 
From a cold leg of mutton cut slices an eighth of an 
Inch thick. Beat up an egg, stir in a teaspoonful of 
Worcestershire sauce ; dip each slice in this, roll in bread- 
crumbs. Fry quickly. Serve with fried or mashed 
potatoe&

M] MINCE PIES. 



Note to Mincemeat, p. 143. — The following is a good 
way to make mincemeat into mince pies : 

Make some puff paste (see p. 194), roll it out very 
thinly, less than a quarter of an inch, line your patty-tins 
(first butter them) ; fill liberally with mincemeat (p. 143), 
cover with a thicker layer of puff paste, brush over with 
an egg v/ell whisked. Bake in a brisk oven for twenty- 
five minutes. Sprinkle or sift very fine sugar over 
them. The pies may be warmed up if made a day or 
two before wanted. 

The pies may be made /ike open tarts, and burnt 
brandy handed round with thenx

" NAARTJE COMFYT? 

(Mandarin Orange Preserve. From my Grandmother's Dutch 
Recipe BooL:.) 

Take two pounds more sugar than the weight of the 
orange. Rasp the naartje with a piece of glass (which 
prevents it tasting of steel) or a blunt knife ; cut two 
slits across the bottom of the naartje, lay in water for two 
or three days, giving clean water every day. Boil the 
syrup, and when tepid pour it over the fruit ; leave it for a 
night ; preserve the next day very slowly, only letting it 
simmer. Repeat the process the third day, then bottle 
and cork well. 



NASTURTIUM SEEDS USED AS CAPERS. 

Gather the seeds before they are too hard, keep them 
for a day or two with salt sprinkled over them, then put 
them into empty pickle bottles ; pour boiling vinegar over 
them and leave them to cooJ When cold, cork closely. 

The nasturtium flowers are very nice to eat with bread 
and cheese, and butter ; and look very pretty to hand 
round on a separate plate, with the cheese and butter, 
after dinner.

OYSTERS {SCALLOPED^ 

Ingredients. 
• dot Oysters. a or. of Fresh BuUtf. 

A tea-cup of Grated Bread-crumbs. Pepper, 

A little Lemon Juice^ 

Butter some tin scallop-shells, or, if you have not any, 
a small pie-dish. Strew a layer of crumbs, then some thin 
slices of butter, then oysters enough to fill up tin or dish. 
Cover with bread-crumbs and slices of butter, add pepper, 
salt, and lemon, and some of the liquor kept from the 
oysters. Put butter over the whole surface, and bake in a 
quick oven. Brown in the oven. Serve in dish or shells 
in which it has been cooked. Time, quarter of an hour. 



OVENS {IMPROVISED). 

For travellers camping out in South Africa, Nature 
has provided wonderfully good ovens in the ant-heaps, 
which are plentiful in this country. Supposing that 
there was little or no shelter, and, as would be quite 
natural, great difficulty in lighting fire where wood is 
scarce, the traveller should halt in the vicinity of an ant- 
heap. He should make a hole at the side and go on 
scooping it out until there is a good-sized cavity ; then 
make a hole at the top just large enough to fit a saucepan 
or kettle on. After collecting some dry grass, set it alight, 
and place it in the cavity. The inner walls of the ant- 
heap being mostly composed of fine dry grass, it will 
soon ignite, and in a very short time the pot or kettle will 
be boiling. If he wishes to bake a loaf the oven would be 
found sufficiently hot, the hole at the top having heen 
filled up with clay, which can be obtained by mixing the 
stuff taken from the ant-heap with water. If the traveller 
be halting in a wooded part, an oven may be improvised 
by scooping a hole in a bank or ravine and heating it with 
wood. For an improvised stove, travellers should provide

themselves with an empty oil-drum — one that would 
contain six gallons of oil — the top to be cut out, and at 
about four inches from the bottom, two holes, four inches 
square, to be made on opposite sides. Lay some wood 
in the drum, and light the fire, then place the saucepan 
on the top. This would be found useful in either windv 
or rainy weather, and has been used by fishermen in open 
boats at sea. In travelling the oil-drum will form an 
excellent stowaway for small articles.

"PAARL LEMOEN," OR CAPE SHELLFISH. 

Five or six large shellfish. Clean by putting the 
shell in strong lye (boiling water put on wood ashes ; 
half a teaspoonful of washing soda will do as well). The 
shell separates, and the inside easily comes out, and must 
then be rubbed on a stone, well washed, and beaten with 
a wooden mallet. Put in a stewing-pot with a little 
butter or fat, let it simmer for an hour; then stir in a 
tea-cup of fine bread-crumbs, two ounces of butter, some 
nutmeg and white pepper, and just before serving, a little 
salt. Be careful to stir occasionally. No water to be 
added, as it forms a rich gravy of its own, but requires lots 
of butter. Ought to be as tender as marrow. A delicious 
dish. 

N.B.— The Paarl Lemoen, or Klip Kous ("Stone- 
stocking ") , a species of shellfish found on many parts of 
the South African coast, adhering to the rocks. Tiie

and peel of a lemon ; when nearly done, a glass of dark 
wine. Excellent, 

PEAS {GREEN), TO BOIL. 

Shell your peas as soon as you have gathered them (if 
possible). For a large vegetable dish of peas take a quart 
of water, into which put a pinch of salt, and a small piece 
of vegetable charcoal. Boil for fifteen minutes, if young 
and fresh, in an of en saucepan. When tender drain through 
a colander, and put into a dish with a piece of butter, 
and if the peas have been gathered some time before 
being shelled they will have lost their sweetness, in which 
case add a teaspoonful of sugar. Shake well together in 
the dish, and keep the dish on the top of the saucepan 
for five minutes to melt the butter and sugar belore 
serving. 

PICKLE {CABBAGE).

Pepper, Salt, Gravy. s oz. Butter, 

Lay a rim of paste round the sides and edges of a pie- 
dish. After the pigeons are cleaned, halve them ; season 
as you would any other pie; a few slices of ham, some 
hard-boiled eggs, a cup of good stock or gravy. Covei 
with puff paste ; ornament the top, and stick four of the 
little feet out of it. Brush over with egg and milk, bake 
an hour and a half, with a buttered paper if the oven ia 
very hot, over the pie crust to prevent its burning. 

(Pigeons at the Cape are very plentiful, and are very 
good roasted or stewed.) 

PIE (STEAK). 

Cut a steak into thin slices, sprinkle with parsley, 
mushroom, and onion ; season with pepper and salt, 
rubbing in the seasoning well on both sides ; roll up each 
slice of beef, put into a saucepan on a layer of bacon, and 
put in sufficient water to cover the rolls. Simmer gently 
with the lid on till tender; put into a pie-dish with a 
layer of hard-boiled eggs, cover with a good crust. Bake

glass of white wine, and a little stock. Mix all well to- 
gether, cover with crust. Bake for two hours. 

PIES. — N.B. — All meat pies with pastry crust should have a hole 
left in the top of the crust, or it should be pricked over with a fork, to 
let the steam escape during the baking, otherwise it is unwholesome. 
It is with the object of biduig the bole that a pastry ornament is usual 
at the top of a pie.

P] PIGGIE, OR SUCKING-PIG-POLISH. 



PIGGIE, OR SUCKING-PIG. 
(A very favourite Cape Dish.) 

When the piggie has been well cleaned and washed, 
make a stuffing of bread-crumbs, suet, some dried sage 
leaves, pepper, salt, lemon-peel. If eggs are plentiful, then 
moisten with an egg and some water. Stuff the pig, sew 
up with strong thread j truss it as a hare is trussed, with 
its fore-legs skewered back and its hind-legs forward. Lay 
it on a trivet, in a dripping-pan, with a pint of water in 
the pan. Rub the piggie all over with butter (or sheep- 
tail fat), and set it in a hot oven. Will take two hours. 

I have heard that rubbing the piggie all over with the 
white of egg, before roasting, makes it nice and crisp.

POLISH FOR FLOORS. 
(Home Recipe.) 

If your floors are white, scrub and scour well with 
strong soda ; stain with oak staining or vandyke brown, 
which can be ground in water and mixed with a little size. 
Go over the boards twice ; let the floor get quite dry, then 
polish with beeswax and turpentine. Scrape the bees- 
wax and any remains of sperm candles in a round basin. 
Cover the wax with spirits of turpentine ; leave all night. 
The next day the wax will be dissolved, and the mixture 
have a creamy appearance. Rub well into the boards with 
a piece of flannel, and polish by friction. A soft linen 
cloth gives a better polish than flannel. When done three 
times, an ordinary deal floor will have a beautiful polished 
surface;

Scented Verbena Leaves. 2 oz. Bay Salt. 

Lavender. 2 oz. Saltpetre. 

A few Bay Leaves. i oz. Cloves. 

Some Nutmeg and Cinnamon, 

The Odorata rose and other sweet-scented ones, freshly 
gathered (but be careful no dew is on them), the verbena, 
lavender seeds, and leaves, put in a wide-mouthed jar in 
layers sprinkled with the salt, saltpetre, and the spices 
well bruised. Stir the contents of the jar occasionally. 
This will retain its scent for years, and may be freshened 
up whenever roses and other scented flowers are in season — 
clove, carnations, etc. At the Cape there is a very sweet- 
scented pink rose, almost single, called the French, brought 
to the Cape by the Huguenot refugees, and also Capse rose, 
which give a most delicious scent to the pot-pourri. Be 
careful not to let water be spilt on the pot-pourri — it would 
spoil it completely. 



POTATOES {HOW TO BOIL) 

Put your potatoes into boiling water with a good tea- 
spoonful of salt ; boil for twenty minutes ; when soft 
which can be felt easily by pricking with a fork, throw 
the water off, put the potatoes back (if with their jackets 
on) into the saucepan, putting the pot on the stove for a 
few minutes till the skins burst. If the potatoes are peeled 
leave them in the colander on the steam ; toss them, and 
send them in looking nice and mealy. The Dutch people 
serve boiled potatoes with a little melted butter.

POTATOES {SAVOURY). 

(Mrs. Manuel's Recipe.) 

Bake yonr potatoes, then cut in half and scoop out the 
iii'side, which mix with a little chopped parsley, onion, 
nutmeg, cheese, pepper, and salt ; put back into the skins, 
e^g and bread-crumb the tops, brown them and serve hot. 



"SWEET POTATOES" STEWED AS A VEGETABLE. 

Peel and slice about four or five pounds of "sweet 
potatoes"; take a cup of sugar, a spoonful of flour, a 
spoonful of butter, and a little salt. Lay the sliced sweet 
potatoe in an enamelled saucepan in layers, sprinkled with 
sugar, butter, and flour, and when you have put in the 
last layer pour over it a cup of water. Let it all stew 
gently, giving the pot a stir occasionally. 

To those who like sweet things with meat this is very 
iKuch liked. 

Boiling them in water with their jackets on,- peeled 
before serving, and cut in slices, with melted butter, is 
another good way of cooking " sweet potatoes."

the apricots out of the salt water, wash them, and pour 
the boiling syrup over them. LeaVe for a night like this. 
The next day preserve by gently simmering till the fruit 
is nice and clear. 



PRESERVE {RIPE APRICOT). 
(Old Dutch Recipe.) 

Apricots can only be preserved by pouring boiling 
syrup over them, for ten days, boiling the syrup every 
day ; the syrup to be made of sugar, the same weight as 
the fruit. On the tenth day make a fresh thick syrup; 
put the apricots in a wide-mouthed jar, pour the thick 
boiling syrup over them, and cork well. 



PRESERVE (APRICOTS IN BRANDY).

Ingredients. 
61b. of Ripe Apricots or Peaches. sj lb. Sugar (boiled to a thick syrup). 

Wipe your fruit very clean, prick with a steel pin ; pack 
the apricots or peaches in a jar. Take one tea-cup of 
thick syrup and one tea-cup of brandy, mix well, and 
pour over each layer of fruit as you put them in your 
jar; when filled, put a paper between the top of the jar 
and lid ; set the jar in a saucepan of water, and let it heat 
to near boiling point, then remove the paper and lid, and 
when cold cork well. If the lid is one that screws on, no 
bladder is necessary. Apricots and the " Pavia " peaches 
are best done this way, and the yellow peach with Mrs. 
Cloete's recipe.

PRESERVE (CITRON— FIG). [P 



PRESERVE {CITRON). 
(From my Grandmother's Recipe Book. Dutch.) 

Scrape the rind, cut in halves, take out the pulp, lay 
them in a basin of hot water to which a handful of salt 
was added ; change the water the next day, then leave for 
two days longer in water ; after that, boil them in clean 
water till soft enough to put a reed through. Press all the 
water out carefully, laying on a cloth to cool. For each 
pound of fruit take two of sugar ; make a syrup of the 
sugar (one cup of water for a cup of sugar), clarify with 
an egg. Boil for two days on a slow fire. Keep well 
corked in glass bottles. 

PRESERVE (FIG). 
(Old Cape Recipe.) 

To preserve white figs whole, take them nearly ripe, 
peel thinly, but leave the stalks on; lay for a night in 
lime water, the next morning prick with a needle. Take 
the weight of the fruit in sugar, make a thick syrup, taking 
less water than cups of sugar ; lay the figs in the syrup, 
boil gently till the figs are transparent and the syrup thick. 

ANOTHER FIG PRESERVE. 
(From a very old Cape Recipe Book. Dutch.) 

Scrape unripe figs, cut a slit across the top (not to0 
large), lay in a basin of cold water in which has been put 
two tablespoonfuls of lime (this quantity to lOO figs). Lay 
a plate, with a weight on it, on the top of the figs, or they 
will drift on the water. About twelve hours after, take 
out, wash clean. Have ready a saucepan in which you 
have about three quarts of clean water, one teaspoonful of 
carbonate of soda, one tablespoonful of salt. Let the figs 
boil up in this, taking care to leave the saucepan open. 
Take out when soft enough to be easily pierced with a 
reed ; drain through a colander, or on a cloth. Take two

pounds of sugar more than the weight of fruit, make a 
clear syrup (one cup of water to one of sugar) ; when 
strained and cool, lay your figs in it for a night, the next 
day preserve on a slow fire till the fruit is quite clear. 
Cork in small jars. Time, three or four hours. Very good. 

PRESERVE {RIPE FIG). 

Take six pounds of ripe figs, lay them for a few hours 
in lime water (two spoonfuls of lime to a basin of water) ; 
take six pounds of sugar, boil a clear syrup ; alter strain- 
ing, let it boil till thick before adding the figs ; then 
preserve for two hours longer, slowly, till the figs look 
clear. Cork. Will keep well. 

PRESERVE i^' HOTTENTOT FIG," OR "SOUR FIG"). 

Lay the " figs" in boiling water till the hard skin is soft 
and will peel off easily. Take the weight of fruit in sugar, 
and boil a syrup. Put the fruit (after carefully peeling 
and cutting off the hard part at the bottom) into the syrup, 
and preserve slowly. 

(The Hottentot fig is the fruit of a kind of mesem* 
bryanthemum which grows wild at the Cape.) 

PRESERVE {RIPE MELON). 
(A very old Cape Recipe.) 

Ingredients. 

8 lbs. of Sugar, boiled with the same 6 lbs. of Melon, ripe, 

quantity of Water into a Syrup i oz. of White Ginger, 

clarified with an Egg. 

Take a large ripe melon (not too soft) ; cut into large 
slices ; prick with a fork, peeling the slices very thinly and 
removing the seeds. Lay the pieces in a basin, cover 
with cold water, in which is a teaspoonful of salt, and put 
a plate on the top to keep the pieces under water. Let it 
remain in water four or five days ; then wash it carefully; 
put the fruit into boiling water, and let it boil up once ; 
17$ 



PRESERVE (WATER MELON PEEL— MELON). [P 

lay the slices of melon on a cloth to drain. Now boil the 
syrup, and pour it boiling hot on the slices of melon, 
repeating this process every morning for a week ; the last 
two days put the slices of melon in the preserving pot in 
which you heat the syrup, and let it boil gently for ten 
minutes or more, then let it cool. Repeat the next day, and 
go on till the fruit is quite clear and firm, and the syrup 
nice and thick. This process diminishes the syrup greatly, 
and you might make a little more if necessary. This mode 
of making preserve is rather tedious, but repays one for the 
trouble ; it will keep for years, and becomes beautifully 
clear and quite firm. (The ginger to be put in a muslin 
bag, and boiled with the preserve, and taken out the last 
thing.) 

PRESERVE {WATER MELON PEEL). 

Cut the water melon peel in pieces ; cut ofif the outer 
green peel and all the soft inside, cutting away all the red 
part ; then cut into square pieces or shapes, prick well 
with a fork ; lay the pieces in an earthen basin in lime 
water — two spoonfuls of lime to four quarts of water. Put 
a plate on the top to keep it under water ; leave all night ; 
wash well in cold water next morning; put in some cold 
water ; let it boil till you can put a stick into it ; now 
drain. Having previously weighed the peel, take the same 
weight in sugar ; set it on the fire in a saucepan, a layer of 
peel and a layer of sugar, a few sticks of cinnamon, two or 
three cups of water ; close the lid of the stewpan ; let it 
simmer till the sugar is melted, then preserve gently (take 
the lid off if there is a good quantity of syrup). If the 
water melon was an " American Ice Cream," it will preserve 
in two or three hours, urd be beautifully crisp and soft, 
almost melting in your -:^outh. Four or six cloves to be 
put into the preserve. 

PRESERVE (MELON). 

Made in the same way, only take green melons, while 
the water melon peel preserve should be from a ripe one.

P] PRESERVE (SEVILLE ORANGE— PEACHES). 



PRESERVE {SEVILLE OR BITTER ORANGE). 
(Mrs. Etheridge's Recipe.) 

Scrape the rind with a blunt knife or piece of glass. 
Cut four small incisions at the bottom ; put them in water 
for four days, changing the water daily. Boil the oranges 
until soft, putting them into boiling water. Squeeze them 
out well. Have- ready the syrup — for twelve pounds of 
fruit eighteen pounds of sugar. Let the oranges lie for a 
night in syrup before preserving. (Similar to recipe for 
" Naartje Comfyf') 

PRESERVE {PEACHES IN BRANDY), 
(Mrs. H. Cloete's Recipe.) 

Ingredients. 
ISO Peiches. 8 lb. Sugar. 

3 bottles of White Spirits of Wine. 

The yellow or apricot peaches are generally used. 
Make a thin syrup of half the sugar (four pounds). Peel 
and prick the peaches ; boil fifty at a time in the syrup till 
nearly soft; of the remaining sugar make a very thick 
syrup. Take three cups of this and two cups of spirits of 
wine. Put the preserved peaches in glass jars; pour the 
mixture over and cork at once. 

Should a smaller quantity of peaches be made, the same 
syrup in which the peaches were boiled might be mixed 
with the spirits of wine, only boiled till very thick. 

PRESERVE {WHOLE PEACHES). 
(Mrs. Henry Cloete's old Cape Mode.) 

Take ripe " Clingstone " peaches, peel very thinly, prick 
well. Lay them in a large basin of water into which two 
spoonfuls of lime have been thrown (if you have no lime at 
hand, a handful of kitchen salt will do as well ; the effect 
is to harden the outside of the fruit.) Leave the peaches 
for an hour or two in this. Weigh the fruit before you put

ft in the lime-water ; for twelve pounds of fruit take ten 
pounds of sugar. Wash the peaches in clean water ; oil 
your preserving pan with olive oil. Put alternate layers of 
fruit and sugar, and pour about two or three cups of cold 
water over ; preserve with the lid on the pot for about an 
hour on rather a quick fire, then let it stew very gently 
till the syrup is thick and the fruit looks clear ; skim 
occasionally. Cork when cool. Wi/l keep well. 

Ordinary white crystallised sugar or light yellow gives 
a nice colour. 

PRESERVE {QUINCES). 

(Hilda's Recipe.) 

Peel and cut the quinces (large ones) in four pieces ; 
carefully core and cut out all the hard inside. Lay in a 
saucepan, cover with cold water with a handful of salt. 
Boil quickly till soft (for about ten minutes), then drain 
carefully. The weight of the quinces after they are peeled 
in sugar. Take the peels and cores and pips, cover with 
cold water, and boil well, and strain ; of this juice take as 
many basins as sugar. Lay the quinces in a preserving- 
pan covered with sugar, and the juice of the skins and 
cores ; preserve gently till the pieces are quite clear, and 
the juice forms a jelly when cold. This preserve served 
with whipped cream is most delicious. 

PRESERVE (QUINCE). 

(Mrs. Etheridge's Book.) 

Peel and cut quinces in thin slices, let them dry a 
little ; the next day preserve in thick syrup, two pounds of 
■ugar more than the weight of fruit.

(Mrs. Ahren's Recipe.) 

Take middle-sized fruit ; prick and cut an incision at 
the bottom. Lay in lime water for a night (a tablespoonful 
of lime in two bottles of water) ; the next day in a little 
salt water. Preserve in an equal quantity of sugar. Oil 
the saucepan, then put in layers of fruit and sugar alter- 
nately, and boil slowly. Half an ounce of ginger in a 
muslin bag to be added during the boiling, and taken out 
when done. 



PRESERVE (GREEN TOMATOES). 

Take six pounds oi greett, unripe tomatoes, eight pounds 
of sugar, boiled to a syrup, and four lemons, the rind very 
thinly cut and the juice squeezed. 

First boil the tomatoes gently till quite tender, but 
don't let them break. In the water in which the fruit is 
boiled put about two or three dozen green peach leaves ; 
drain, after taking out. Make a syrup, and put the toma- 
toes in it cold. Put in two or three pieces of ginger in a 
bag and the lemon-peel ; let it boil slowly till quite clear, 
then take out the ginger. Just before taking the preserve 
off the fire add about two tablespoonfuls of brandy.

SPRITZE. 

(Another Dutch SpecialitL) 

Ingredients. 
3 lb. of Flour, i lb. Butter, 

lo Eggs. a bottles of Milk. 

Boil the butter and milk, stir in the flour and a quarter 
of a pound of sugar. Pour the paste in a dish, arid when 
cold mix ten eggs with it ; beat well till it drops clean off 
a spoon. Let it drop into a saucepan of boiling lard or 
fat in tiny balls. Fry a nice brown. Serve with sugar 
and pounded and sifted cinnamon. The old Dutch people 
had a tin through which they pressed the dough into the 
boiling fat 

(Another recipe says, one pound of flour to eight eggs, 
a quarter of a pound of butter, and one pint of milk.) 

STEAK {PICKLED). 

Lay two pounds of steak in a dish with sliced onions, 
half a dozen cloves, two dozen whole pepper, a bay leaf, 
sprig of thyme, marjoram, and parsley, a tablespoonful of 
salad oil, tarragon vinegar enough just to come up to the 
steak ; let it soak for twelve hours, turning occasionally. 
Then take it out, and grill the steak in a hot pan, turning 
constantly. Stew the mixture, add a teaspoonful of salt, 
and let the steak simmer in it, taking out the spices, etc., 
before serving in a hot dish. Enough for six people.

" SWARTZUIR? 
(A homely Cape Dish.) 

Ingredients. 
S lb. of Ribs of MuHoa 6 Cloves. 

1 Onion. la Peppereorns, finely bruised, 

s oz. of Tamaripds. \ tablespoonful of Brown Sugar. 

Salt. 

Cut the meat as you would for curry, put in a stew- 
pan with the onion and a pint of water. When it has 
simmered for an hour take out a cup of the boiling stock, 
skimming the top so as to remove all the fatty particles. 
Stir into this boiling soup a large cup of fine flour ; stir 
well over the fire till it is a thick dough, now set it to 
cool. When quite cold work into the dough one or two 
*ggs ; of this make dumplings the size of a walnut. 

After this cup of soup has been taken from the meat, 
stir into it the tamarinds soaked in a pint of boiling water, 
spices, etc.; let it boil well, and half an hour before serving 
stir in the dumplings. Serve as an entree. The old recipe 
had the blood of a duck instead of tamarinds.

SYLLABUB. 

(Mrs. Etheridge's Recipe.) 

Jngredients. 

i pint of White Wine. 2 oz. Loaf Sugar. 

I pint of Rich Cream. Juiee and Peel of a small Lemon. 

Rub the sugar on the peel to extract all the flavour 
from the peel, then add to the cream, and whisk well. 
Take about one ounce of sifted sugar and add it the 
last thing, as it tends to make the cream thicker. Put 
into glasses. Excellent.

boiled to a Syrup, and strained. tumbler of Water, 

i teaspoonful of Oil of Lemon. 

Stir all together; let it settle, then bottle and cork 
well. A little taken with soda water, or in plain water, is 
very refreshing in summer, 

[Note to Salads, p. 213. — The following is a Dutch recipe for 
Herring Salad.] 

Ingredients. 

3 large Salted Herrings or Harders. i tablespoonfiil of Chopped Parsley. 
a Spanish Onions. i dessertspoonful of Salad Oil. 

Pepper and Vinegar. 

Soak the harders in cold water for a night ; boil for five 
minutes. Separate the fish from the bones; slice the 
onions thinly, scald with boiling water ; mix fish, onions, 
and other ingredients ; garnish with hard-boiled egg and 
parsley. Penguin eggs, hard-boiled, may be added to the 
fish. This makes a good supper dish. 

[Note to Sandwiches, p. 213.— The following are good recipes.] 

SANDWICHES {PLAIN MEAT). 

Cut very thinly slices of bread and butter from a 
square loaf baked in a tin, and place very thin slices of 
ham, tongue, biltong, or game between them ; season with 
salt and mustard or pepper ; press them on a board with 
the blade of a large knife. Cut the crust off evenly, and 
divide them into oblong squares. 



SANDWICHES— SWEETS. [S 



Ordinary cold meat sandwiches are much improved by 
the meat being minced, and hard-boiled eggs and a little 
parsley, both chopped fine, being mixed with the meat, 
and placed between the bread and butter. Many people 
dislike the mixture of mustard and butter, so it is generally 
best to omit the former. A. sprinkling of pepper, if liked, 
is ar improvement 

SANDWICHES (EGG). 

Two or three hard-boiled eggs, mashed very finely, and 
mixed with half an ounce of butter, some pepper and salt. 
Spread liberally on the bread and butter (cut as for an 
ordinary sandwich) with a sprinkling of watercress (cut 
sniall) or mustard and cress. The eggs may also be cut 
thinly and laid between the bread and butter, with pepper, 
and salt, and cress. 

SANDWICHES {SAVOURY). 

Very savoury sandwiches may be made of bloater paste, 
etc., according to recipe (p. 12), and boned anchovies and 
hard-boiled eggs. 

For afternoon tea, sandwiches made with jam, or slices 
of cucumber, with lettuce, or thin omelet, make a nice 
variety to ordinary bread and butter.

T] TART (COCOA-NUT— MILK). 

TART {COCOA-NUT). 

(" Klapper-Taart." From a very old Dutch Book.) 

Rasp two cocoa-nuts into their weight in sugar, add a 
good spoonful of butter, a cup of milk, and some cinnamon. 
Boil all together till it is quite stiff; then line a tart-dish 
with puff paste, and pour the mixture in. Bake for half 
an hour. Very good. 

TART {COCOA-NUT), ANOTHER WAY. 
(Old Dutch Recipe.) 

Grate the cocoa-nut very fine, take the weight in sugar, 
half an ounce of butter, one &^g, white and yolk whisked 
separately, some cinnamon. Mix well together; line a 
tart-dish (ordinary tin kitchen plate) with puff paste. Bake 
in a quick oven till a nice brown. 

Another way is to boil the cocoa-nut in a syrup made 
from the sugar, and when cold add the egg and butter; but 
the first has been tried and is very good.

(An old German Cake. Mrs. Van der Riet) 

Ingredienti. 
A Stale Sponge Cake. i pint of Milk. 

100 Walnuts. ■ Eggs. 

I spoonful of Sugar. 

Take a hundred walnuts (or a grated cocoa-nut) ; shell 
and pound the walnuts — it should be a teacupful. Make a 
custard of the milk and eggs, and a spoonful of sugar. 
Add the pounded walnuts, stirring until it thickens, then 
pour into a basin to cool. Cut your cake in slices (a plain 
round mould is best), putting them together carefully; 
then put the bottom piece on a dish, cover it with some of 
the walnut custard, put the next slice so as to fit, and put 
on some custard, and so on till the cake is built up again. 
Of the whites of the eggs make an icing. Ice the whole 
cake; ornament the top with pieces of walnut and some 
little bits of icing coloured with cochineal. If cocoa-nut is 
used instead of walnuts, boil it with sugar into a syrup, as 
you do cocoa-nut ice. An excellent way of using up a 
stale sponge cake. 

TARTLETS (.MARMALADE CREAM). 

Line some patty-pans with puff paste : now fill them 
with this mixture : one tablespoonful of apricot marmalade, 
the yolks of two eggs, one white, the weight of one egg in 
butter and in sugar. Whip all to a cream ; put into the little 
tins. Bake in a hot oven twenty minutes. To be eaten cold.

r] TOMATO BREDEE— TOMATO STUFFED— TRIFLE. 

TOMATO BREDEE. 
(Cape. H. D.) 
Cut up two pounds of ribs of mutton and an onion ; let 
it stew in a flat pot for an hour. Cut up and add 
eight or ten tomatoes in slices, also a teaspoonful ot salt, 
a pinch of sugar, and half a red chilli. If there is a 
great deal of liquid, remove the lid, and let it simmer till it 
is all a rich, creamy-looking sauce. Remove the fat. Serve 
with plain boiled rice. A very nice entrh. See Bredee. 



TOMATO STUFFED. 

Extract some of the inside of the tomato ; mix bread- 
crumbs, cheese chopped, onion, and pepper, with an egg. 
Stuff the tomato with this mixture; sprinkle over with 
bread-crumbs and a piece of butter. Bake for an hour. 
Tomatoes plainly cut in halves and sprinkled with crumbs 
and butter, and fried or baked in the oven, make a very 
nice vegetable. 

TRIFLE.

Ingredients. 

1 tumbler of Madeira or Sherry. J^ lb. of Macaroons. 

2 wineglasses of French Brandy. i pint of rich Boiled Custard. 
4 Sponge Biscuits. I pint of Syllabub. 

Soak four sponge biscuits and half a pound of maca- 
roons in the Madeira and French brandy. Then cover 
the bottom of a glass dish with half of these, pour over 
them a pint of rich custard previously made, then lay 
the remainder of the soaked biscuits upon them, and 
pile over the whole, to the depth of two or three inches, 
the whipped syllabub, well drained ; the whipped syllabub 
to be made the day before, or some hours before, as fol- 
lows : Take half a pint of cream, half a glass of light wine, 
and a dessertspoonful of sifted sugar ; take a clean dry 
whisk, and whip the cream to a stiff froth with the wine, 
adding the sugar last of all. When the wine has drained 
to the bottom, carefully skim the light, frothy cream, and 
pack it on the top of the last layer of macaioons. Excellent, 



TOFFEE (COCOA-NUT)— TURKEY (BOILED). [7 



TOFFEE {COCOA-NUT), 

Ingredients. 
I Cocoa-nut. x lb. Sugar. 

QrsXt Afresh cocoa-nut ; boil the sugar with the milk of 
the cocoa-nut and a cup of water ; when nice and thick, 
add the grated cocoa-nut. Stir all the time, till you see it 
coming quite clear off from the sides, then take oif. Grease 
the dishes on which you pour it, mark it out with a knife 
in squares, and let it get cold. Very good. 

TURKEY {BOILED). 

Hen turkeys are preferable for boiling, on account of 
their whiteness and tenderness. They should not be 
dressed until they have been hung two or three days, as 
they will not be tender. Pluck the bird carefully, and 
singe with a piece of paper ; wash well, and wipe with a 
dry cloth ; cut off head and neck ; draw the strings, or 
sinews, of the thighs ; cut off the legs at the first joint, 
draw the legs into the body, and fill the breast with force- 
meat, or stuffing ; run skewers through wing and middle 
joint of leg quite into wing and leg on opposite side ; break 
the breastbone, and make the bird look as round as possible. 

Way of cooking. — Put the turkey into sufficient kot 
water to cover it, let it come to a boil, then carefully 
remove all scum ; if this is attended to there is no occasion 
to boil the bird in a floured cloth, but it should be well 
covered with water. Let it simmer very gently for one and 
a quarter to one and three-quarter hours, according to the 
size, and serve with either white, celery, oyster, or mush- 
room sauce, a little of which should be poured over the 
turkey. Boiled ham, bacon, tongue, or sausages should 
accompany this dish ; and when oyster sauce is served, 
the turkey is always stuffed with oyster forcemeat. 

A simple stuffing for Turkey. — Soak a penny loaf of 
stale bread in either milk or water, press well; take a 
good lump of butter or suet, a little sugar, pepper, nutmeg, 
salt, some sweet herbs, an egg. Mix all well together, and 
stuff turkey or fowl.

T] "TASSAL"— TEA, 



[Note. — " Tassal " is an old-fashioned up-counby way of curing 
meat in the open air popular with travellers.] 

« TASSAL? 

Take any meat, beef, venison, springbok, etc. Cut the 
meat in long strips about three inches thick, sprinkle 
slightly with salt, pepper, a little coriander seed (bruised), 
and vinegar ; leave for a day, then hang to dry ; if wanted, 
just soak a little and' grill on the coals. 

The Boers and travellers find it most nourishing in 
travelling, when fresh meat cannot be procured. 



TEA (TO MAKE GOOD). 

Be very careful to rinse the teapot with boiling water. 
Allow a teaspoon of tea for each person and one for the 
teapot, pour boiling water into the pot, let it stand for five 
or six minutes. Then pour it off into your silver teapot, 
and keep hot with a cosy by the fire for late-comers. 

On no account keep tea standing on the leaves for 
more than ten minutes. The Dutch people often improve 
their tea by collecting the orange-blossoms in the season, 
and keeping them with their tea in the caddy.

and an egg or two ; mix all well together. Skewer up the 
joint in a round form (larding it with nice fresh bacon is a 
great improvement) ; cover the veal with a buttered paper ; 
let it roast very gently ; baste it well with some butter or 
fat. About half an hour before serving, pour over the 
joint half a tumbler of wine, with a teaspponful of flour 
mixed in it, which makes a nice rich gravy. (Takes three 
hours in an oven.)

V] VENISON— VEGETABLE MARROW STUFFED. 



VENISON. 
(My own Recipe.) 

The " Duiker " is considered very good, and also the 
" Springbok," which, however, is very rare in the western 
province of South Africa. 

The forequarter is generally used for "Buck soup"; 
the saddle (cut like a saddle of mutton) being the best 
joint for roasting, and must hang for six or seven days. 
After the outer skin is taken off, there still remains a 
thin white fleece, which must be taken off before larding 
the venison. Take a firm piece of fat bacon cut into equal 
strips, and proceed to lard either with a larding-needle or 
pointed knife. Venison is much nicer roasted in a flat 
Dutch baking-pot, with a good piece of butter and a spoonful 
of good lard or fat. Put the joint on with a little water. 
If a saddle, turn it upper side down at first, and an hour after- 
wards put some wood-coals on the cover of the pot Having 
basted the joint well, roast it a nice brown, and half an 
hour before serving pour over it a tumbler of dark wine 
and a little vinegar, with a dessertspoonful of flour mixed 
in them. Stir the gravy well. This gives a nice glaze to 
the meat, and imparts a very good flavour. If done in an 
oven, cover the joint with a buttered paper and baste 
frequently. 

The " Steenbok " and " Grysbok " are very plentiful in 
some districts, and are very good to eat too.

butter, bread-crumbs, spices, the yolks of one or two eggs, 
and the flavouring. Cut average-sized vegetable marrows 
(the small, pretty-shaped ones) into halves, scoop out the 
seeds, etc., fill with the above mixture. Wrap up each 
marrow in a piece of buttered paper tied with a string, lay 
them all closely together in a buttered tin, cover this with 
a tin plate, and put in the oven. When you think they 
are done, remove the paper carefully, lay them in a dish, 
and serve with a nicely-flavoured gravy made with a little 
stock, thickened with the yolk of an egg, and a glass of 
wine or a little lemon mixed just before serving. 



VEGETABLE MARROW AS AN I MIT A TION OF APPLES. 
(Cape. Our own Recipe.) 

Take a large vegetable marrow — the white kind, with 
lumps all over the outside — cut it in thin slices, after 
having peeled and taken out the soft pulp and seeds. 
Proceed to slice it very thinly. Butter an enamelled pot ; ■ 
put layers of this sliced vegetable marrow, and sugar (for 
one good-sized marrow take a large breakfast-cup of 
sugar), a tablespoonful of flour or bread-crumbs, ten 
cloves, a tumbler of wine and vinegar mixed — pour the 
wine over the last layer of vegetable marrow and sugar — 
also a pinch of salt. Let the stewpan simmer for two 
hours, stirring carefully for fear of burning. Very good 
with roast duck or goose. 

VEGETABLES {SAVOURY\ 

Take a young heart-shaped cabbage, parboil, and lay 
it on a dish and cut it in half, carefully remove the inside, 
stuff the cavity with nicely-flavoured mince, or a prepara- 
tion as for "Frickadel" (see p. 75); put the two halves 
together, and tie with a piece of tape and a thin skewer, 
put it into a saucepan with a little stock, and a few pieces 
of bacon; let it simmer for an hour or more. Serve nice 
and hot. A slice of toast or some crumb of bread in a

muslin bag, placed in the water in which cabbage is 
boiled or stewed, absorbs the pecuh'ar cabbage smell out 
of the water which is so disagreeable, and the muslin bag 
can be thrown away when the vegetable is dished.

YEAST (FOR MAKING HOME-MADE BREAD). 
(Our own Recipe.) 

Take two quarts of boilinfj water, an ounce of salt, 
three cups of meal. Put the salt into a saucepan, pour on 
it the boiling' water, strew on it gradually three cups of 
meal, then cover closely, putting a cloth between the lid 
and pot to absorb the steam. Set it over-night in the 
warmest corner of your stove. At six o'clock next 
morning stir into it a cup of boiling water; stand the 
saucepan on some hot ashes, and soon it will begin to 
ferment. When ready for use it will have a frothy 
appearance and a disagreeable odour. Pour it into six 
pounds of meal, mix with warm water, and knpad into

OPINIONS OF THE PRESS 

ON 

HILDA'S "WHERE IS IT?" 



The Sunday Times says :— " Urder this very curious tide, Miss Hilda- 
gonda J. Duckitt has writtrn one of the most delightful volumes of recipes 
ever printed. How many are there who have travelled that do not regret, 
when back in London, that they neglected to take the receipt of ' that delicious 
vegetable curry at Colombo,' that green tomato omelette at the Mauritius, that 
kidgeree in Bombay, that something-or-other toasted somewhere, and never 
forgotten? Their number must be very great, and it is by this regretful and 
regretting multitude that Hilda's volume will be most warmly welcomed. 
Here they will find how to prepare those acid-sweet apricots the Persians bring 
down into the plains of India for sale, the ' sambal,' or green chutney which 
makes the dishes of the Malays so appetising, the ' sasatees ' that, steaming on 
their skewers, rejoice the picknickers at the Cape, and scores of other dishes 
which the wanderer on the face of the earth will recognise as old friends with 
pleasure. The home-stayer, too, will do well to experiment in them, in spite 
of their fearsome names ; but these same names are most quaintly exorcised 
and made comfortable and homely by the writer's little notes." 

The Morning Post says: — "Hilda's 'Where Is It?' of Recipes may 
be recommended as containing clear directions for the preparation of many 
delicacies for the table. The recipes include Cape, Indian, and Malay dishes 
and preserves, some of which are as good as they are rare. Space has also 
been found for other matters besides eatables, and the possessors of this small 
volume will find themselves provided with directions for polishing furniture, 
tleaning materials, and administering homely remedies to the sick." 

The Cape Argus says : — " Admirable book . . . compiled by somebody 
who knows all about it." 

The Wynberg (South Africa) Times says:— "This work cannot 

fail to prove eminently useful to every intelligent housewife who is fortunate 
enough to become possessed of a copy. . . . The book is of a thoroughly 
practical character, and written in an easy, pleasant style." 

The Saturday Review says : — " A capital book ... a most interest- 
ing collection . . . much is new, and what is not is often newly put." 

The Princess says : — "A book of novel arrangement. . . . There are 
instructions in this book that, I suppose, it would be a thousand chances one 
would ever meet elsewhere, some of them as old as a century, and it should 
certainly be added to the collections of every housewife. " 

Vanity Fair says : — "The author lives at the Cape, and has collected from 
various sources — the majority of them the archives of her own family — valuable 
old recipes, owned and practiued by the Malay, Imlian, and French cooks, 
whom it was the custom of Cape families of Duich descent to employ. 
Attached to the book is a pencil, intended to do duty on the blank pages left 
for the purpose of memoranda writing, where recipes from other sources may 
be committed to paper."
