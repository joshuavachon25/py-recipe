COOKING— BOOK TWO 



FOREWORD. 

This course in cooking has been worked out in such a way as to make it 
thoroughly practical and workable in Public Schools. Each lesson in the 
hands of the pupil is so comprehensive, and yet so explicit, as to require the 
least possible detail work on the part of the teacher. 

Each pupil should be required to study her printed lesson very carefully, 
for there she will find not only full working directions for all processes in the 
cooking class, but she will also find such information as is necessary to give 
the subject its fullest educational value. 

The fact that each student must read and interpret the printed page, 
closely correlates this work with every other subject of school work, and 
develops careful concentration and thoughtful interpretation. 

The various directions and instructions given throughout these courses 
are not presented with the idea of being the only ways by which results can 
be obtained, but they are set forth as ways thoroughly tested by many years 
of successful experience in several large cities, as well as small country 
schools. 

As this work is presented in the kitchen — a place where pupils learn to 
do by doing as well as by thinking — it differs from the regular class room 
work where only thinking is required, and will be strange to the pupils for a 
few recitations. For these reasons, the specific regulations set forth in this 
manual: have been suggested. These suggestions should be adhered to closely. 

The Suggestions for Home Application given at the close of each regular 
lesson represent the practical generalizations which the students should 
gather from that lesson. This work should have particular emphasis. 

The Home Recipes found in each lesson are kindred dishes which may 
be used either at school or at home to augment the regular lessons. These 
recipes will afford abundant material for additional and optional lessons. 

The pages of Menus for Luncheons and Dinners offer guidance in the 
preparation of school meals, many of which should be given during the 
year. Nothing can be done to add popular favor to the Domestic Science 
work so effectively as to have the students serve an occasional luncheon to 
school authorities or patrons. 

Every means of correlating the work of the school wath the life of the 
home and the community should be earnestly developed.

THIS PAGE TO BE TORN OUT AND GIVEN TO HOUSEKEEPER NO. 1. 
HOUSEKEEPER'S DIRECTIONS FOR LESSON 1. 

You are really a Teacher's assistant in this lesson and the success of 
Lesson 1 depends to a great extent on how you do your part of the work. 

First: We must have all the materials necessary on hand. As we are 
going to prepare Canned Tomatoes today, let us see what we must order at the 
grocery store. 

Market order for a class of sixteen pupils : 
16 Large, Red, Ripe Tomatoes. 

or 
32 Small Tomatoes. 
8 Pint Jars with rings and covers. 

GENERAL DUTIES OF HOUSEKEEPER NO. 1. 

Take one of the dust cloths provided and dust one half of the room 
accorling to the directions for "Dusting" already learned. 
You cannot spend much time in dusting — about ten minutes will do. 

Now find the tea towels and the dish cloths and take out half as many 
of each as there are girls in the class. 

Place one tea towel and one dish cloth in each middle drawer between 
two girls. The dish cloths will be needed for washing the dishes, and the 
tea towels for wiping the dishes. 

Pay close attention to the teacher's instructions to pupils when she 
presents the lesson. 

When the girls are all through scraping and piling dishes for dish wash- 
ing, gather waste materials on a dish. Empty the waste on to a piece of 
paper, fold carefully and put into the garbage pail. 

If there are any extra soiled dishes in sink, pantry or in ice box, collect 
them and divide them equally among the girls who are washing dishes today. 

When pupils are all through washing and wiping the dishes, gather all 
the tea towels in one pail. Wash them in hot, soapy water. Wring and 
rinse them in clear water. Wring as dry as possible and hang them up to dry. 

When Housekeeper No. 2 has washed out the dish cloths, wash and wipe 
out the sink. 

After the pupils have been dismissed, sweep one-half of the room, if the 
janitor of the building does not do it. 

Be sure that the room is in perfect order before you leave it.

THIS PAGE TO BE TORN OUT AND GIVEN TO HOUSEKEEPER NO. 2. 
HOUSEKEEPER'S DIRECTIONS FOR LESSON 1. 

If your room is furnished with a water heater, light it. 

Dust one-half of the room with a dust cloth (according to directions 
already learned). 

Place the food materials on work tables at convenient places, each to 
furnish 8 pupils (4 pairs) with the necessary quantities. 

Place the tomatoes so there will be 1 large or 2 small ones for each pupil. 
You should w^ash the glass canning jars, rings and covers. Place the jars edge- 
wise and covers in a pan of cold water and heat slowly to boiling point. Let 
them remain in the water until the girls are ready to use them. 

Place one large kettleful of water which has been boiled, cooled and salted, 
allowing 1 tsp. salt to each qt. of water ,for each 8 pupils (4 pairs). Place a 
large bowlful of cold water for each 8 pupils (4 pairs). Fill a sauce pan full 
of water over a burner, one for each 8 pupils, that the girls may scald their 
tomatoes in it. 

For each 8 pupils place a dish pan over a burner. Cover the bottom of 
pan with steamer rings or several thicknesses of paper, that the filled cans 
can be placed on them. The pupils must not place the filled cans so they touch 
the bottom of the dish pan. It would break the jars. 

Have a second dish pan ready so that the filled one may be covered with it. 

GENERAL DUTIES OF HOUSEKEEPER NO. 2. 

Be seated and listen to the teacher's instructions during the presentation 
of the lesson. 

Wash out, wring and rinse the dust cloths which you and Housekeeper 
No. 1 used today. 

When pupils are through with the food material, g^ather all that may be 
left over and can be used. Place in clean dishes, cover and put it aviray for 
the next lesson. 

Wipe off the shelves in the pantry. Wipe off the kitchen table if there 
is one in the room. See that the ice box and cabinets are perfectly clean. 

Collect all the soiled dish cloths in a pail, and cover them ^vith warm, 
soapy water. Wash, wring, rinse and hang them up to drj' 

When pupils have been dismissed, sweep one-half of the room if the 
janitor does not do it. 

See that the room is in perfect order before you leave it.

SPECIAL ISrSTRUCTIONS TO TEACHERS FOR LESSON 1, ' 

CANNED TOMATOES. 

Market order for class of 16 pupils, larger or smaller classes in proportion. 

16 Large, Red, Ripe Tomatoes. 

or 
32 Small Tomatoes. 
8 Pint Jars with rings and covers. 

NOTE. Housekeeper No. 2 should place the tomatoes so there will be 1 
large or 2 small ones for each pupil. 

She should wash the glass canning jars, rings and covers. 

Place the jars edgewise and covers in a pan of cold water, and heat them 
slowly to boiling point. Let them remain in the water (according to Directions 
on Note Book Page today) until the girls are ready to use them. 

Place one large kettle full of water for each 8 pupils (4 pairs). 

Place a large bowlful of cold water for each 8 pupils (4 pairs). 

Fill a sauce pan full of water over a burner, one for each 8 pupils, so that 
the girls may scald their tomatoes in it. 

For each 8 pupils place a dish pan over a burner. Cover the bottom of 
pan with steamer rings, that the filled cans may be placed on them. The pupils 
must not place the filled cans so that they touch the bottom of the dish pan. 
It would break the jars. Have a second dish pan ready so that the filled one 
may be covered with it. 

Discussion. Tomatoes may be kept indefinitely in this way. They should 
be put upside down and kept in a dark place — as light affects the tomatoes and 
develops an unpleasant taste. 

If one washes to prepare tomatoes for salad, they may be canned in vinegar 
and salted water, using half and half. 

NOTE. If tomatoes cannot be obtained, this canning Lesson may be post- 
poned without breaking the sequence of the Lessons.

Prepare CANNED PEACHES. 

Market order for a class of 16 pupils 

16 Peaches. 
21/2 Lbs. Sugar. 



On hand. 

Cloves, 

1 Lemon. 

4 Pint Jars with rings and cover. May need less jars. 

Housekeeper No. 2 should place 8 peaches for each 8 pupils (4 pairs). 

She should fill one bowlful of cold water for each 8 pupils for the girls 
to measure. 

Fill one pan full of water and place it over a burner for 8 pupils to scald 
the peaches in.

Cut lemon in halves, one half on a saucer, one saucer for each 8 pupils 
(4 pairs). 

Place cloves on saucers, 4 on each saucer, one saucer for each 8 pupils 
(4 pairs). 

DISCUSSION: 

This is another method of preserving fruit. The jars and covers must be 
perfectly sterilized and the fruit poured into the jars while hot that there 
may be no chance of bacteria getting into the jars. The jars should be filled 
to overflowing with the fruit and syrup and the sterilized covers screwed on 
securely. 

NOTE. If peaches can not be obtained, some other fruit may be substi- 
tuted, or the lesson may be postponed without disturbing the sequence of the 
work.

DISCUSSION: 

All egg and milk mixtures should be cooked at a low temperature, as 
albumen coagulates at 134 deg. F. 

If custard is baked too long or at too high a temperature, it will water. 

Custard is baked when a clean cut can be made with a knife. 

Pupils must be careful when caramelizing the sugar. First it will form 
lumps and then gradually melt.

The fact that stale fish is injurious should be emphasized and that fresh 
fish is nourishing and easily digested, especially the white-fleshed kind. An 
acid will coagulate albumen, so when vinegar or lemon juice is added to the 
water in which fish is to be cooked it will make the flesh firm. — Farmers ' Bulle-

DISCUSSION: 

Overheated gelatine will not stiffen on cooling ; so pupils should be warned 
not to boil gelatine mixtures. The gelatine should be soaked in cold water 
(hydrated), then dissolved either in holing water or over it. It should be free 
from any gelatine specks; that is, completely dissolved, before combined with 
other ingredients — otherwise mixture will not stiffen.

IV2 Lbs. Veal from the shoulder or round. 3 Eggs. 

1 Onion. 4 Potatoes. 

Few Pepper Corns. 1 Sprig Parsley. 

Bit of Bay Leaf. 1 Oz. Butter. 

Lard left from Doughnut Lesson for frying. 
Flour, Salt and Pepper on hand. 
Housekeeper No. 2 should cut the meat into rather small pieces, put into 
saucepan, cover with boiling water, add a slice of onion, bit of bay leaf, pepper 
corns and a teaspoon of salt. Put over the fire and cook it 25 minutes. This 
might be done the day before. Remove thfc meat and force it through the 
food chopper. ' . 

To 11/2 cups of stock (water in which the meal; has been cooking), add 1/2 
cupful of Hour mixed w4th an equal amount of cold water until smooth, and 
thin out until it can be poured easily. Add thickening to stock, cook over the 
fire until thick (about 5 minutes). Divide chopped meat into 2 bowls — place 

1 bowl for each 8 pupils, or 4 pairs. Divide sauce into 2 bowls — 1 bowl for 
each 8 pupils, or 4 pairs. 

Measure 2 tablespoons of butter into a custard cup placed in a saucepan 
of hot water. Place this where all pupils may reach it easily. Place parsley 
and celery salt where pupils can reach it easily. Place pieces of stale bread 
on plates — 1 plate for each 8 pupils or 4 pairs. Place frying kettle on 1 
burner. Have the table covered with several thicknesses of paper so that if 
t'at spatters, the grease will not get onto the table top. Have a pan covered 
with paper near burner, to drain the croquettes. 

Housekeeper No. 1 should pare the potatoes. Wash, put into a saucepan, 
cover them with boiling, salted water (1 quart Avater — 1 teaspoon salt) and 
cook them until soft. Force potatoes through a potato ricer. Divide riced 
potatoes into 2 bowls, 1 bowl for each 8 pupils or 4 paire. 

Beat 2 eggs slightly with a fork, add 2 tablespoons cold water — divide onto 

2 plates — 1 plate for each 8 pupils or 4 pairs. Break third egg, beat slightly, 
divide into 2 custard cups — 1 custard cup for each 8 pupils or 4 pairs. 
DISCUSSION: 

The pupils should be very careful to cover the entire croquette mixture 
with egg, as the egg forms a firm coating through which the fat cannot pene- 
trate. 

The housekeepers should begin their work at least 40 minutes previous 
to this lesson. They could cook the meat and potatoes and prepare the sauce, 
the day previously, if desirable. Also force the meat through the food chopper 
and the potatoes through the potato ricer.

DOUGHNUTS. 

Market Order for class of 16 pupils : 

y^ Lb. Granulated Sugar. 

2 Oz. Butter. 

3 Eggs. 

1 Lb. Flour. 

Baking Powder. 
Nutmeg, Salt. 

Peanut Oil, Lard or Crisco for frying. Should be enough left over 
from previous lesson. 

Housekeeper No. 2 should put the sugar in bowls, 1/2 cupful iii each— 
1 bowl for each 8 pupils, or 4 pairs. Measure the butter, 2 tablespoons on 
each saucer, 1 saucer for each 8 pupils, or 4 pairs.

Put 1 nutmeg on each saucer — 1 saucer for each 8 pupils, or 4 pairs. 

Place doughnut cutters so pupils can use them. 

NOTES : 

Pupils may bring doughnut cutters from home, in case the school is not 
supplied with them. If there is fat left over from the previous lesson, the 
pupils should take off the top layers of fat; in this way any sediment left 
over on the bottom may be removed. 

If there is not enough fat, add some fresh fat to the left-over fat. 

It is safest to have but 1 frying kettle and for the teacher to stand by 
it during the frying. In this way, accidents are avoided. 

The table near the kettle should be covered with several thicknesses of 
paper, that it may not be spattered with fat. 

The pupils should hold material close to top of fat when dropping the 
materials into it — if held at some distance and then dropped, the fat spatters 
badly.

pupils use V4 cup of this mixture, in place of the licpiids and yeast. 

Light the ovens when the loaves are rising the second time. 

NOTES : 

In order that this Bread lesson may be completed in the allotted time 
of the recitation, a large proportion of yeast is used. In the Home Recipe 
a less amount in proportion is used. You should call the attention of the 
class to this important matter. It is a safe plan for the teacher to test the 
water before the pupils add their j^east cakes — as a little too much heat will 
kill the plants and the sponge will not rise. The dough should rise to double 
its bulk each rising. Pupils are likely to bake it before it has risen suffi- 
ciently. Remind the pupils that there are no more yeast plants in bread 
started with a great number of plants than in bread started with a small 
number. It takes just so. many plants to do the work, and the more used to 
begin with the shorter the process. 

Pupils are apt to knead in too much flour after it has been tossed on the 
board. They should add the flour, cutting it in with a knife, until when 
mixture is touched with the finger, it does not stick to the finger. 

The board should be dusted with flour and the dough kneaded until 
smooth and elastic to the touch.

WHITE CAKE. 

Market Order for a class of 16 pupils : 

1/3 Lb. Butter. 
2 Lbs. Sugar. 
8 Eggs. 

1/2 Pt. Milk. 

Pastry Flour, Vanilla and Baking Powder on hand. 

Housekeeper No. 2 should divide the butter in bowls — place 1 bowl for 
each 8 pupils, or 4 pairs. 

Divide the sugar in bowls, the milk and the pastry flour — 1 bowl for each 
8 pupils, or 4 pairs.

baking powder cans and vanilla bottle where pupils can reach them easily. 
Light the ovens.

NOTES: 

The pupils should work together on the cake mixture, and when it is 
just ready to take out of the oven, prepare the frosting. 

The frosting is delicious when properly made. It must be taken off the 
fire just as soon as a soft ball will form, when a little is tried in cold water; 
or when it spins an inch thread when a little is dropped from a fork. Bread 
flour can be used for cake, but it does not make as delicate a mixture.

of each as there are girls in the class. 

Place one tea towel and one dish cloth in each middle drawer between 
two girls. The dish cloths will be needed for washing the dishes, and the 
tea towels for wiping the dishes. 

Pay close attention to the teacher's instructions to pupils when she 
presents the lesson. 

When the girls are all through scraping and piling dishes for dish wash- 
ing, gather waste materials on a dish. Empty the waste on to a piece of 
paper, fold carefully- and put into the garbage pail. 

If there are any extra soiled dishes in sink, pantry or in ice box, collect 
them and divide them equally among the girls who are washing dishes today. 

When pupils are all through washing and wiping the dishes, gather all 
the tea towels in one pail. Wash them in hot, soapy water. Wring and 
rinse them in clear water. Wring as dry as possible and hang them up to dry. 

When Housekeeper No. 2 has washed out the dish cloths, wash and wipe

DISCUSSION: 

Freshl}' boiled or canned peas maj^ be used. Dried green peas that have 
been soaked in cold Avater for 24 hours or more and then cooked until soft, 
may be used. The dried peas contain a larger proportion of nourishment and 
are inexpensive. They require long soaking and long cooking. Where strict 
economy must be exercised, they should be used frequently in soups, creamed 
and in timbales.
