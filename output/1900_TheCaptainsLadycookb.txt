Se\>eral years ago I JounS the original manuscript for this 
cookbook -journal 7b I read through the han^v^ritten pages oj Jaded 
copperplate, I Jelt as ij I had stepped hack in time to an era oj 
majestic clipper ships, the Ci^il War, a dashing captain and his 
lo\>ely lady who avfaited her husband's return Jrom sea so many 
times. As I JolloWed her through those many years oj anxiety, I 
came to knoh> a courageous, deMed, sensitii^e, caring, v/arm, hiding, 
educated Woman. She spent many hours perfecting a style oJ 
cooking We noW recognize as typical NeW 'England. 

We read about her jamily and her husband sjamily, her deep 
lo-^ejor music, poetry, literature and art; her handicrafts, shopping 
trips, her dog, ja'fourite books — all the intellectual and house- 
wifely pursuits oJ an elegant lady oJ her times — an authentic 
Qothic heroine — in this instance —

Till that I ha^e v^ritten about my Jamily can again be expressed 
Jor my Captain's Jamily. 'Ois truly said that nfhen a man finds a 
w/oman who is surrounded by the same marvelous atmosphere that 
contains all the good things of life like joy, loi/e, peace, he is 
enchanted. He has not only jallen in lo^e but has found a safe 
harbour in which together they will be saje Jrom all the \>icissitudes 



My Captain's Ta-^ourite 'Poem — 

"Come my friends, 

'Cfis not too late to seek a nevier WorU. 

'Push off, and sitting Well in order smite 

Ohe southing JurroWs; Jor my [mrpose holds 

do sail beyond the sunset and the baths 

Of all the Western stars, until I die. 

It may be that the gulfs will Wash us doWn: 

It may he We shall touch the Happy Isles, 

Tlnd see the Qreat Tlchilles, whom We knew. 

dhough much is taken, much abides and though 

We are not noW that strength which in old days 

Moied earth and hea-ien, that which We are, We are — 

One equal temper oj heroic hearts. 

Made Weak by time andjate, but strong in Will 

do stride, to seek, to find, and not to yield. 

"Ulysses" Alfred, Cord dennyson 

'Vhe Way of £ife" 

6th Century "B.C. Chinese 

He who is open-eyed is open-minded. 
He who is open-minded is open-hearted. 
He who is open-hearted is Kingly. 
He who is Kingly is godly, 
He who is godly is usejul. 
He who is usejul is infinite. 
He who is irfinite is immune. 
He who is immune is immortal.

Ohe Captain brought me a hand-carded hope chest Jrom the 
Orient Jor my 16th birthday. We also pledged our troth that day. 
Since then I ha-^e beenjilling it with so many beautijul things, I 
am ajraid I Will need a second chest by the time the Wedding takes 
place. 



^^[Jhe Wedding 

March 18, 1857 

It is a soft, misty, early spring hy. Ohe sky is blue, the sun is 
bright. CJhere seems to he a special radiance v/here-^er I look. I Jeel 
that I am h>alkiny through a dream. I am noW dressed in my 
heautijul, soft vfhite gov^n oj O'Callaghan lace oVer tissue taffeta 
with a myriad oJ petticoats to make it stand out. My Captain 
brought the materials from Ireland along With a ^ery special bouquet 
of white silk Killarney roses: My Qolden Celtic Cross and my 
Claddagh Wedding ring he brought hack on his last Voyage. My 
long. Trench illusion i^eil is caught up with the same roses and 
looks T^ery pretty against my light auburn hair done up in large 
curls and Waives. My Jather brought my pearls Jrom the Orient 
se-^eral years ago. 

My bridesmaids — my sisters, sisters-in-laW and cousins — 
look like a heritable rainbow in e^ery shade imaginable — blues, 
greens, pinks, \>iolet. My little nieces are dressed in white replicas 
of my goWn. 

I arri\>ed at St. Michael's Church in our large carriage with my 
Jather and mother. Ohey looked at me so lovingly and proud. We 
then all arranged oursehes in a procession; the music started and I, 
leaning on my father's arm. Walked doWn the long aisle to the altar, 
dhere he stood — My Captain — tall, blond, bearded, 
handsome, strong, honest and true. Ohe Mass Was \>ery special, the 
music loifely. We made our pledges to each other and sealed them 
with a kiss. Ohen We turned and started doWn the aisle to be 
greeted by our relatives and Jriends. May the happiness, beauty and 



sanctity of this moment ne^^er cease. I Jer^ently helie-^e that ' £o^e 
is 'Eternal " May Qod hless us both an^ may his bright, shining 
light oj lo'^e encircle and protect usjorei^er.

"Hoy^ Do I £o^e Ghee?" 

'Elizabeth 'Barrett 'Brin\>ntng 

How do I loie thee? £et me count the vlays, 

I loie thee to the depth and breadth and height 

My soul can reach whenjeeling out of sight 

Tor the ends oj "Being and ideal Qrace. 

I loi/e thee to the leiel oj e-fery day 's 

Most quiet need, by sun and candle-light. 

I loie thee jreely, as men stri^/ejor Jiight. 

I loie thee purely, as they turn Jrom "Praise, 

I loife thee with the passion put to use 

In my old griejs, and With my childhood's Jaith. 

I loie thee With a loVe I seemed to lose 

With my lost saints — / /oVe thee With the breath 

Smiles, tears, of all my lije! — ar^, if Qod choose 

I shall hut lo^e thee better ajter death.

'A Worthy Wife" 



When one finds a Worthy Wife, her ialue is Jar beyond pearls. 
Her husband, entrusting his heart to her has an unfailing prize. 
She brings him good, and not e'fil, all the days of her life. 
She obtains Wool and flax and makes cloth With skillful hands. 
She puts her hands to the distaff, and her fingers ply the spindle. 
She reaches out her hands to the poor, and extends her arms to the needy. 
Charm is decepti^fe and beauty fleeting; the Woman who fears the 

Cord is to be praised. 
QiT^e her a reward of her labors, and let her Works praise her at the 

city gates. 



Ohis is the true measure of loie, when We believe that We alone 
can loie, that no one could e-ier ha^e lo'ied so before us, and that no 
one will e-ier loie in the same Way after us.

^^My "Brother, Charles^^ 

August 22, 1857 

Wor^ has just been received tohy of the hath at sea of my 
dearest brother Charles 'Philip. He n/as Captain oj the tall, square 
rigger "3he Valiant" that Went dor^^n i^fith all souls aboard on my 
Wedding day, March 18, 185?. 

I remember him so Midly a great, big powerful man With black 
curly hair and beard, a soft, laughing look to his eye and the scent 
oJ the sea and "English lavender always about him. He had a Wry 
grin and always let me Jill his Irish clay pipe with aromatic 
durkish tobacco. 3 hen he'd puff aWay as I excitedly told him 
about my dreams, plans and fancies. He used to bring me back 
dolls and pretty things to Wearjrom all his many "Voyages around 
the World. 

I think before he lejt this time he had a premonition of impending 
disaster because he asked me to take care oj his dog. King, a big 
jaWn- colored shepherd. 

I remember noW so Midly the day oj my Wedding. As I Was just 
about to enter the carriage, King suddenly started to bark joyfully 
and ran to the gates, prancing about all the Way back to me as ij 
he saw someone I did not. CJhen, as my jather assisted me into the 
carriage I Jelt a light touch on my Jace and then King sat doWn 
\'ery still at my Jeet, head on paWs and rejused to moVe. I let him 
be and when We got to the Church he stood guard until my Captain 
and I came out together. CJhen he took up his position at my 
Captain's Jeet. He must haife knoWn then that his old master 
Would ne^^er return again.

Cousin Jane Wyler^^ 

Cousin Jane Wyler n^fli laid to rest today in a forgotten 
lichen- co\>ered, maple-shaded corner oj the old 'Protestant church- 
yard. Ohe beauty oJ the early spring day enhanced hy the sv^eet 
Jragrances i^/ajting up from the deep masses oJ ^arigated lilacs and 
sno^y v^hite syringia only seemed to intensify the poignancij oJ her 
tragic demise. If only I could ha^/e helped sustain her in her sorrov^, 
anguish and shame, dissuaded her from engaging in self- 
condemnation. 'But, alas! Oo no a-^ail. She said, "I can hear any 
physical pain stoically, hut not the soul-searing pain of \^atching 
the disappointment and disgust in the innocent eyes of my family 
and friends. Worst of all to he denied v^orship and the Sacraments 
in my Church. I neither seek nor desire pity. I ha\>e searched my 
soul and my eyes are blinded u/ith tears for my helo\>ed Jonathan 
and the loss of my honor. I cannot li-i'e }]/ithout respect and honor. 
"Death r^^ould be a Welcome friend and companion. Ohen my 
loneliness and self-imposed exile Would be ended. My Jesus aWaits 
His recalcitrant and penitent child. " 

I tried to persuade her to journey to friends in "Prescott in the 
Western part of the state. Dhey Would ha-i>e shielded her in her time 
of tra'\^ail; hut, she Would hear none of it. She deemed it just and 
proper to pay for her sinful behaviour in full measure. If only her 
betrothed had not died one Week before the Wedding at NeW }j ear's. 
I fear that Cousin Jane with her great religious fer-^our and refined 
and delicate sensibilities, had descended into melancholia and 
morbidity and, therefore, must needs censure herself far beyond 
society s monumental demands. Her guilt became for her an 
emotional obsession that naught could e^er change. I pray that 



25 



Our Saviour, in His Infinite loi^e and i^isdom, i^^ill join them 
together as one Jore\>er on high. 

Jane and Jonathan 
and their unborn 

"May a rosy nfreathe entv^ine themjor all eternity.

71 Knyght there \iai and that a Worthy man, 

Who, from the moment when he first began 

do ride forth, loied the code of chiifalry: 

Honor and truth, fieedom and courtesy. 

His lord s War had established him in Worth; 

He rode — and no man further — ends oj earth. 

In heathen parts as Well as Christendom, 

Honored whereT/er he might go or come. 

Of mortal battles he had seenjifteen, 

And fought hard for our faith at Gramassene 

Ohrice in the lists, and always slain his foe. 

Ghis noble knight Was e^ien led to go 

Go Gurkey, where he fought most :faliantly 

Tlgainst the heathen hordes for "Palaty 

^Renowned he Was; and. Worthy, he Was Wise — 

rrudence, with him, Was more than mere disguise; 

He Was as meek in manner as a maid. 

Vileness he shunned, rudeness he ne^fer said 

In all his life, respecting each man's right 

He Was a truly perfect noble knyght.

Sea Tei'er" 

John MaiejieU 

I must go doh!n to the seas again, to the lonely sea and the sky, 

And all I ask is a tall ship and a star to steer her by, 

'And the wheel's kick and the wind's song and the white sail's shaking, 

'And a gray mist on the sea's Jace, and a gray hwn breaking. 

I must go doWn to the seas again, Jor the call oj the running tide 

Is a wild call and a clear call that may not be denied; 

And all I ask is a Windy day with the white clouds flying, 

And the flung spray and the bloWn spume, and the sea gulls crying. 

I must go doWn to the seas again, to the T/agrant gypsy lije, 

do the gull's Way and the whale's Way where the wind's like a 

whetted knije; 
And all I ask is a merry yarnjrom a laughing JelloW-ro-^er, 
And quiet sleep and a sWeet dream when the long trick's o^er.

*^ Christmas Season 

December 4, 1859 

It's almost Christmas, our first together. Tortunately the 
Captain's \>oyage ended in August and he v^ill not he lea\>ing again 
until June, 1860. 

I must start the plum puddings, 12th Night Cakes, Jruit cakes, 
other special cakes, candies and mince meat. It is December 4th, 
St. 'Barbara 's Dag, my patron saint, and it is bitterly cold. Ohe 
snov^ continues ceaselessly. Ohe Captain spends many hours in the 
library studying his navigation charts and engineering formulae. I 
enjoy baking something special myself and bringing it into his study 
later in the evening. We sit close together before the roaring fire 
and share our deepest thoughts and feelings. I can hardly bear the 
thought of his lea-iling again in the spring.

Oodaij \^as our third anni'^ersarxj. It seems hut yesterday when 
My Captain and I Were married. We lo'\^e each other e^en more 
this day, ij possible. We celebrated with both his parents and my

'BeeJ, Yorkshire "Pudding, Shrimp, Williamsburg Tipple Pie, 
Prune Whip With a Jroth oj cream and, oj course, a special Cake

T^arious precious stones. Ohe pin jorms a tree oj lije in gold 
encrusted with stones on e\>ery branch. £aid in succession, the jirst 
letter oj each stone spells the Word "T)earest. " ^Diamond, emerald,

Outv^ard ^ound^^ 

June, I860 

CJhe most difficult part of ii^aiting for my Captain is v^hen he 
has just sailed to some strange seaport in a place that I hnoW I 
shall ne\>er see. Once at sea, he is part oj a World that I ha^e no 
part oJ; I cannot share. My only ri-^aljor his constant and complete 
lo-^e and a^ection is "Ohe Sea." When he yets that Jar-a-r^ay 
look in his brilliant sea-hlue eyes, I knoh^ that a ne\^ Voyage is 
heiny planned. Ohen I v^ish v^ith all my heart and soul that I 
could accompany him v^here^er he goes — just to he n>ith him — 
to experience v^ith him the pov^erjul lure oj the sea — that 
intoxicating feeling oJ freedom and ad-^enture — the utter grandeur 
of it all. Anything so I do not ha^e to stay home and Wait and 
Worry through the long endless months ahead. HoWe-^er, he Will 
not permit it. CJhe trips are sWift, the seas treacherous, the dangers 
many and Varied. He usually tra^^els from 'Boston to the West 
Indies around the Horn to California, then the Sandwich Isles, 
Ja)^a, Sumatra, Ceylon and Canton exchanging cargoes at all 
these ports as he goes. Ghis takes about three and one half months, 
then a Weeks stay in Canton making repairs, loading up; then it's 
retrace the same route back to Boston for another three and one 
half months. He Would ha^^e no peace of mind With me on hoard 
as he has so often said. 

When I know he is homeWard -bound, I like to spend as much 
time as possible in his library. I feel ^ery close to him there. CJhe 
beautiful Walnut panelled Walls complement the many models of 
famous ships displayed all around the room. His shell collection 



87 



occupies an entire v^all. Ohousam^s of boohs on myriad subjects 
occupy the other vHalls. Ohere is a large globe inhere I JolloW him 
as he sails around the H^or/3. / usually ha^^e afire lit and sit at his 
beautijul hand-carxfeS desk and v^rite letters to him, do my house- 
hold accounts, keep up both my daily journal and receipt boohs. I 
h my needleWorh and practice my music at a small harpsichord I 
ha\'e brought in Jor practising. 

dhen later in the afternoon, I sit on the crimson iehet coi^ered 
k'iWojV seat in the large 'Bay y^indo)^/ r^/ith my dogs and cats, 
enjoy my afiernoon tea and v^atch the horizon intently in order to 
be sure to catch the first glimpse oj the breath-tahing sight oj 
"Dhe Qolden Tleece" as she majestically enters the harbour. 
"My Captain has returned!

May 1863 



T)unng the Ci^il War, my Captain deli'/ered military supplies 
an^ Joo^Jor our hra\>e soldiers ^on'n along the coast to Southern 
'Ports. On one journey homev^ar^ he became in-^oked in a harrowiny 
rescue at sea. 

Upon arriving at his destination, he discovered that the prevailing 
\Veather conditions v/ere soJaVorahle that they \Vere able to sail 
directly to their anchorage iVithout the aid of a tug or pilot boat. 
"But now, as they prepared to return to the home port oj "Boston 
this early morning they found that the v/ind \Vas rising steadily. 
Ohe Captain \Vas on the quarter deck \Vith the harbour pilot h>ho 
had been taken aboard in order to guide them out as Jar as the 
open vVater because oj the thrashing seas. Ohe Captain issued 
commands to the Tirst Mate. "Prepare to cast ojf, Mr. Tarrell. " 
Tlye, TLye, sir, \Vas the quick reply. 

Till Work being done to the accompaniment oJ Varied Jull- 
throated sea shanties, the anchor Was hoVe up and aWay. CI he 
wind Was steadily increasing an^ there Was already a good deal oJ 
restless sWell to the sea. Ohe sails Were then unfurled. Suddenly, 
the Captain spied a little black girl about eleVen running toWard 
the ship with tWo men in pursuit — probably slaVe bounty 
hunters. She Was clutching her cloak tightly about her pathetically 
thin little body. Ohe Captain quickly ordered a line oVer the side 
and up she hastily scrambled much to the anger and dismay oJ the 
hunters. Anxious hands pulled her safely oVer the side. Ohe line 
Was immediately hauled in and the signal given. "Qet underway 



97 



at once, Mr. Tamil " Oh great ship mo-^e^ majestically out to 
sea guiSed hy the harbour Tilot n/ho then dropped ^oh^n a line to 
his boat anS returned to the Sock. Ghe ensign halyards M>ere then 
raised; the Stars and Stripes billo\^ed back from the stern; the 
helmsman grasped the wheel, shaped her course and held her steady 
as she goes. Ohe taut, Wind-Jilled sails strained the ropes. Ohe 
hoisted sheets sw/elled and caught the mighty mnds mth a sharp 
crackling, ear-splitting sound that reverberated oifer the restless 
fomenting v^aters. Jhey continued to Jill as into the roaring sea the 
clipper ship glided, gathering speed faster and faster, heading straight 
for the open seas and home. Ohe ship \^as noW on its ohin; the 
v^aters rushed backward from the sharp boW to rush aft in a great 
froth and mingle with the foaming white Wake beyond the stern. 

As soon as they Were safely on the high seas, the Captain 
ordered the little girl brought to his quarters. She, who had been so 
braVe before Was now trembling with fear as the tall, stern-looking 
Captain began to question her. "What is your name and where are 
you from, little lady?" asked the Captain. 

She replied, "My name is Mariah. I lived on a plantation in 
Virginia. Tlfter it Was burned to the ground, my mammy and I ran 
aWay. She Was taken sick and died about tWo months ago. (Before 
she died she told me to run to the North, head toward the sea. 
Maybe someone Would take me aboard a ship. I traveled by nite 
and hid by day, living on anything I could find. I Was scared and 
missed my Mammy so, but I kept hearing her say: "Child, go 
North and find freedom somehow. " I kept running until I Was 
within sight of the dock and your ship. Ohen those tWo hunter men 
saw me and give chase. I prayed so hard and you saW me and 
here I be." 

Ohe Captain ordered hot blankets and food for her immediately. 



98 



7b he helped her to remote her tattered cloak, he heard a hahy 
v!ail and with great disheliej carefully lifted a little tWo-month old 
hahy from a sack attached to her back. She told how her Mammy 
died when brother Isaiah Was horn. Ohen a pathetic meoW Was 
heard as a tiny half-star\>ed tabby cat poked its head Jrom another 
sack tied to her bodice. Ohe Captain threw back his head and 
laughed. "Wait 'til my Cady sees what treasures I am bringing to 
her on this 'Voyage. 71 little girl to be companion to my nieces 
Carrie and Jennie Maria, an official mouse -catcher for JloseWood 
and another little baby orphan to raise. 7111 in all a handsome 
bounty for my Cady s pleasure. We're homeWard bound and clear 
of danger so let's crowd those sails Mr. Tarrell. I haVe a Cady 
Waiting in Boston for this precious cargo!" 

'"But now our trip is oier and v/e don't ha^ie a care. 
We'll bend on all our stu n sails and sailjor }jankee £and, singing,

CI hen We had a lo'^ely lunch at my Aunts; \>isited for a vfhile 
and made one more stop at the Apothecary hejore returning home. 
An apothecary shop is indeed a fascinating place. Ohe scents are 
tantalizing, the strange names so intriging and the goods themselves 
so interesting. We bought many bars oj Qrossmith's \Vhite rose and 
cucumber soap and lotions oJ Cucumber to preserve the Complexion. 
Dhen, oj course, glycerine and rosev^ater lotion, s\Vansdov!n pujfs, 
sponges, almond meal, witch hazel, nail brush and bujjer, tooth 
brushes, dentijrices and white rose Jragrance in the prettiest 
container. 

June 3 is the Captain's birthday and I ha-^e a large party 
planned just Jor ourjamilies. I shall Wear the white muslin oVer

Ohe Captain s mother came to spend a fortnight ii^ith us before 
he sails to the West Indies, her husband had to go south on a 
business trip. She is such a lo-^ely, intelligent lady, "/erg particular 
in everything she does. Hovfe^^er, she seems to find my pursuits to 
her liking. We think alike on so many things, books, poems, music, 
politics, clothes, floti^ers, food — housekeeping in general. We 
share a )fery deep lo'^e of the classics — music, art and literature 
— also joy and laughter, the study of the moon, the sun, the 
stars, the uni-^erse, the hea-^ens — but most of all v)e share the 
same esteem for the Captain. Her belo-^ed son and my i^ery dear 
and cherished husband. 

I am so thankful that she li\>es only across the riVer.

'Vhe Death of My Uncle

%ly 8, 1871 

My dear uncle Stephen 'Phillips Med today. He v^as horn 
No-i>emher 11, 1791. It is a \>ery sad time for ourjamily because 
he Was my dear jather's only lining kin. My aunt Victoria is 
griej-stricken. CJheirs h>as a long and abiding marriage filled with 
much happiness. !Kosalind, their only child, died the year I Was 
horn and they ojten said I Was like another daughter to them. My 
parents allowed me to spend summers with them at their magnificent 
estate: Jlosemeathe. Whenei^er I visited there, my uncle Would take 
time to teach me the intricacies oj higher mathematics, nai^igation 
and astronomy; then, together We Would gojor rides through the 
grounds oJ the estate. My Welsh pony, Princess, Was gi'^en to me 
one birthday. I lo\>ed her and took care oJ her myself. My uncle 
and I Would play croquet, tennis and badminton. 

My uncle Was a retired sea-Captain and delighted in telling me 
tales oJ the sea monsters sighted off of Qloucester; and thrilling 
stories of hoW he outdistanced Chinese pirates while on the China 
Seas. He also taught me many of the sea songs (mana\>ilins) and 
sea shanties (work songs). <J he former Were sung by the sailors 
for fun and the latter only for Work. My fa\>ourite shantie has 
always been "^Rolling Home" a haunting melody that my uncle 
Would sing for me. Other evenings We Would play backgammon, 
chess or checkers. 

I lo\>ed him like a second father and he lo\>ed me like a dear

daughter. I do so Wish my Captain v^ere here vfith me at this sad 
time.

My Sear Tlunt Victoria Med tohy, 'August 1, exactly 2A days

she Would only Want to be close to him in death. 

She Was horn in Scotland, No\>emher 1J, 1797 in ^ grand

daughter, she Was permitted to study singing and pianojorte. 
dhrough the years she attained a high degree of proficiency at both 
arts and Was noted Jor her exquisite oratorio and opera singing. 
When my Uncle Stephen Was on a Voyage to the British Isles, he 
met her, immediately became Jascinated With her, proposed, Was 
accepted and married in a ^ery short time; one month to be exact. 
Obey sailed jor 'Boston where my uncle built Jor her the magnificent 
Qeorgian estate called "J\.osemeathe" which he jilled with countless 
rare and beautiful jurnishings Jrom China and other places. I Was 
^ery fortunate because she taught me hoW to sing and play the 
piano. Many an e-\/ening We Would gather in the music room and 
after errjoying a high tea before the blazing hearth, I Would entertain 
with songs by Trancis Hopkinson, namely: 'My days hai^e been 
so Wondrous free, " "'Enraptured I Qaze, " and "My £oi>e is Qone 
Do Sea, " while my aunt played the harpsichord and my uncle, 
the 'Dulcimer. 

She possessed that peculiar combination of spirit and brains that 
lights a personality with charm. She Would let me play with curious 



117 



things my uncle had brought hackjrom China — especially a 
hand-carded i-Hory chess set. On my thirteenth birthday, she brought 
me to hear "Dhe SvHedish Nitengale, " Jenny £ind, at the Oemple 
in 'Boston toWn and also ga-^e me a pale blue leather Journal — 
siher bound v^ith lock and key to record my life. 

She taught me hoW to knit coverlets, blankets, and many loT^ely 
things for my hope chest.

Ohe Cegacy of Eoi^e^^ 

September 3, 1871 



yesterday I Was informed hy my Aunt's lawyer that I \^as to 
he the sole heir to her estate. I still can harMy believe it. She lejt 
this letter to me: 

Tlugust 2, 1871 
T)earest niece, 

Since your birth you ha-^e brought great joy not only to 
your family but to your uncle and myself as v^ell. }jou ha^^e 
shared so much of your lo^e of life and joy in li-\?ing with us 
that We deem it only Jit and proper that you should be our 
only heir. We wish you to be Mistress oj Jiosemeathe and 
your Captain, a fitting Master. All monies and things of 
lvalue are to he yours so that you Will he an independent 
Woman as I Was. }jour uncle especially desired this. Dogether 
We leai^e you this legacy oj loVe. 

With much lo^e, my dear, 

your de\>oted, 

Tlunt Victoria 

Ooday is the first day that I ha-^e been back to Jlosemeathe 
since my Aunt s death. It is such a magnificent estate, twice as 
large as 'JloseWood, with ^ast lands, stables, and gardens. It is a 
^ery large establishment with many ser^^ants. I feel \/ery strange and 
a bit lonely Walking through the echoing chambers. Obey contain 
so many beautiful treasures from my Uncle's Voyages around the 



123 



t^orl^: hand-painted n^allpaper depicting Chinese scenes, hand-carT^ed 
mantlepieces, 'Porcelain jardiniere, sets oj Irish 'Beleek, 'English 
Wedgev^ood, sihery^are oj all descriptions and Jurniture in all styles 
and periods. I opened the hidden saje and removed \>elM cases 
containing matchless jewels oJ inestimable \>alue. Opals, diamonds, 
star sapphires and my Ja^ourites — emeralds. I replaced the 
sparkling jewels and continued my Walk through the house, 
rediscovering old nooks and crannies I lo\>ed so Well as a child. I 
then proceeded up the narrow stairs into the attic and then climbed 
up the last pair oJ stairs to the rooj and the "Widow's Walk 
that extended the length oJ the house Jrom chimney to chimney. 
Ohe day Was o'^ercast with a promise oJ rain and Jog. 71 hint oj 
autumn chill roused me jrom my rcT^erie oj things and times past 
and brought me downstairs again, doWn to the special place that my 
Aunt ga-^e mejor my Very oWn. I quickly Walked to the Qallery; 
a long, lojty suite oj rooms panelled in English Walnut taken jrom 
an old ship. Ohere Were high-backed chairs, tables, jirescreens, 
dressers — all the jurniture brought to 'Kosemeathe jrom her 
ancestral home in Scotland. CJhis place she called her jamily 
remembrance apartment. I quickly Walked to a Wall cohered by a 
heaVy tapestry, briejly glanced at the tall suit oj armour standing 
guard and pulled the curtain back. On the Wall repealed Was 
embossed a shield which I pressed and a door slowly opened. I lit a 
taper that I Was carrying and started up the staircase to another 
room. Now, I Was in my oWn special place. Dhere my girlhood 
treasures Were assembled; T)olls, trunks oj dress costumes jrom my 
aunt's cast-ojf goWns, books, puzzles, dried up paints with stijjened 
brushes, toys oj all description — the mementos oj a Very happy 
childhood. I sat doWn at my pretty little table and Weptjor my 
aunt and uncle and all the happy times We had shared together.

My Captain viill arrive three months later than expected; early 
October instead oj late June. Ohen v^e v/ill moT^e into J^osemeathe 
and probably let !Kosehfood out to someone in thejamily. I kno)^^ I 
shall lo-fe and care for this great place and lifith my Captain's 
help v^e v^ill enjoy it just the v^ay my 'Aunt and Uncle intended 
v/e should.

My Captain is a man of character, intellect, courage, honor 
strength; moral as v^ell as physical. 71 man oj hring, adventure, 
\>ision, he has his eyejixe^ on the North Star n/ith his hand at 
the helm an^ is ahle to chart and hoB a true course. He is 
skilled in the Ways of the sea and possesses all the necessary 
instincts oJ a deep Water sailor, especially the ability tojeel his 
Way through shrouds oj jog and darkness and bring his ship into 
saje harbour. His great compassion enables him to handle relation- 
ships with people of all characters and nationalities. Dhe determina- 
tion, dedication and de^^otion he expends on his many enterprises 
are noteworthy. "Besides being an astute businessman, he is also an 
engineer, astronomer and na\>igator. His deep lo^e oj nature is 
re'fealed in his descriptions oJ sunsets in the South Seas, sea gulls 
flying OT^erhead, then darting into the opalescent Waters which are 
Jairly leaping With sihery Jish. 

TLhoard ship his lije is filled with loneliness, because to maintain 
order he must isolate himself Jrom his creW. 7L steward attends to 
his needs and series him his meals alone fior he must eat in seclusion. 
Dhe technicalities of charts and maps occupy many hours oJ his time 
and the successful completion oj the long "Voyage depends on his 
astuteness in these areas. His moments oj relaxation are spent in 
the study and collecting oj shells, buying unusual objects ojartjor 
our home and smoking his pipe. He takes great pride in his ship. 
It is a great beauty with that mark oj the perfect clipper ship: a 
magnijicent cur\>e to its boW. Ohis curiae pro^^ides the great speed 
jor which the ship Was built. It is trim, elegant and handsome; just 
like my Captain; a true Aristocrat oj Sail.

^^<Jhe East Jleturn Jrom the Sea^ 

October I 1871 

[Johij is the first hy oj Odoher. It is a i^eritahle goU and 
crimson Jantasy as Jar as the eye can see. Such splendor, such 
magnificence: the golden sun rising firom the smoke hazed mountains 
transjorming them into a )^?onderland ofi riotous colours then 
continuing on in its orhit e\>er upn/ard radiating in the ^ast heavens 
oJ cerulean blue. 

I arose early this morning just as the mists H>ere rising aho\>e 
the ^ater and the sun )^as breaking through. Till morning I Jelt a 
strange inner unrest, a feeling of unrestrained joy and expectation. 
Could this be the day? I carefully made my most perfect lemon 
meringue pie and then left it to cool. I hastily dressed in a soft 
emerald green ^ehet riding habit. I donned a tocque of green ostrich 
plumes and then set ofi on my fa\>ourite chestnut bay, Star. I called 
to 'Dutchess, the terrier and Moira and J^ori, the Irish setters; v^e 
set ofi at a fairly brisk pace through the perfect v/ood dov/n to the 
pond. Ohere, ri-hilets of deU> vJere evaporating in the Warmth of the 
sun. Ohe pond, so still, faithfully refiected the irridescent images 
of all that it captured \Vithin its depths: the trees, the leases, the 
sun, the sky. Shy deer daintily sipped the cool v^ater, joined by 
rabbits and an occasional mother fox and her pretty cubs. I had a 
basket with me containing bread for the fish, birds and animals and 
small treats for the horse, the dogs and myself. 7b the morning 
Wore on. We Walked further into the peaceful Wood to the holy place 
my Captain and I had made. Ohere by the small shrine to St. 
Trancis, I knelt and prayed, "'Please send my Captain safely 



131 



home, today. " 7b I rose and turned, I thought I saii^ a vision, hut 
no! 3here he vias running to me through the v^ood, the sunlight 
catching the glint from his golden hair. I immediately ran to him 
with the dogs at my side harking Jor joy. It )^as as ij vHe v^ere in a 
dream. Ohen I v>as in his strong arms: that magic circle oj loVe 
and contentment. My Captain lifted me onto the horse, took the 
reins, and v!e started home. 

My Captain is home, ne^^ermore to Venture forth to sea. I will 
now he able to gaze at him to my heart's content, ei^eryday. My 
lo\>e has returned. My life is complete.

him that I Would be honored to be his wife. He took my hand and 
placed a lo'^ely emerald ring with diamonds surrounding it on my 
finger. "Qreen, to match your eyes, " he said. We sealed our 
promises with a kiss. I still hold the magic of that moment in my 
heart and my soul. Ohe rest of the e-^ening Was a dream. We 
danced almost e^ery dance together and when We Were apart We 
longed to he together again. It is now 1878 and We both feel 
exactly the same.

71 happy party they Were that ey>ening. Ohe snov/ had begun to 
Jail softly through a starlight night. Within, the hest sitting room at 
Manor Tarm y^as a good, long, hrh-pannelled room With a high 
chimney-piece. 'Rt the upper end oj the room seated in a shady 
hoWer of holly and e^fergreens Were the tvio hest fiddlers, and the only 
harp in all Muggleton. In all sorts oJ recesses and on all kinds of 
brackets stood massive old siher candlesticks With jour branches each. 
Ohe carpet Was up, the candles burnt bright, the fire blazed and 
crackled on the hearth and merry Mces and light-hearted laughter 
rang through the room. 

When they Were all tired oj dancing, blindman's blufi and other 
games, there Was a great game oJ snap-dragon, and when fingers 
enough Were burned With that and all the raisins gone they sat 
doWn by the huge fire ojfiaming logs to a substantial supper of 
stout ale, roast goose, plum pudding, apples, toasted chestnuts, apple 
tarts, mince pie and a mighty siher howl oj Wassail in which the 
hot apples Were hissing and bubbling With a rich look and a jolly 
sound, that Was perfectly irresistable. UpfieW the bright sparks in 
myriads as the logs Were stirred and the deep red blaze sentjorth a 
rich glow that penetrated into the farthest corner oJ the room, and 
cast its cheerful tint on e^ery Jace. Tls the clock struck tWehe and 
joyful Christmas Was ushered in, e^ery i>oice rose in happy song.
