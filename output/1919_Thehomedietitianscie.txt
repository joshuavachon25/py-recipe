Introductory Note 

Mendel says: "Let us welcome the day when the food 
market and the kitchen are taken into consideration by the 
physician as seriously as are the apothecary shop and the 
fashionable watering place." 

When people eat the proper kind and amount of food, there 
will be little need for the physician save as a teacher and 
guide. Today the people's greatest need is education along the 
line of normal living. Little good can come from spasmodic 
desultory teaching. The mother, the housewife must be thor- 
oughly trained in the science of home-keeping and child cul- 
ture, a most important phase of which is the feeding of the 
bodies of those in her care. 

"What the average woman at the head of a home does not 
sufficiently grasp in all its importance is that the very centre 
of the household — the most important thing in the home — is 
the spread table with a meal on it. Look at the church. It is 
by no accident or mere coincident that the central sacrament 
of the Christian religion takes the form of a common meal. It 
represents a universal fact of human life. The domestic table 
is really the pivot upon which the whole home turns." — Eliza- 
beth Harrison. 

"To keep the body in a healthy condition, to develop its 
strength that all its machinery may act harmoniously, should 
be the first study of our lives." — Ellen G. White. 

"The body is the foundation and not to be ignored. The 
people of power are those who have an efficient tool to carry 
out the mental and spiritual ideas." — Dickenson. 

The mother has the opportunity of developing in her child 
the physical foundation that makes possible heights of intel- 

5 



lectual and spiritual growth. The problem must be solved in 
the home. Upon the housewife rests the responsibility. To 
her this book is humbly dedicated in the hope that it may 
help her in her task.

Health is a state of physical, mental and moral equilibrium, 
a normal functionating of body, mind and soul. It is the state 
when work is a pleasure, ivhen the world looks good and beau- 
tiful, and the battle of life seems worth while. Health is the 
antithesis of disease, degeneracy and crime. 

"The laws of health are as inexorable as the law of gravi- 
tation, as exacting as eternal justice, as relentless as fate, and 
their violation is the beginning and cause of all disease, suf- 
fering and sin. 

"Health is the most desired of earthly blessings. When 
finally lost, it cannot be purchased by uncounted millions, re- 
stored by the alienist, or returned by the pulpit." — S. J. 
Crumbine.

CHAPTER I. 
Food Classification. The Cycle of Life. 

In the body, combined in various ways, are sixteen chemical 
elements: Carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, sodium, potas- 
sium, magnesium, calcium, phosphorus, iron, sulphur, chlorine, 
iodine, bromine, flourine and silicon. 

For the successful growing of crops there must be present in 
the soil a definite number of elements in normal amount and 
combination. Just so for the normal development of human 
beings, there must be present in the food these sixteen elements 
in proper amount and proportion. 

These are not taken into the body as elements but are built 
up first into seven elemental food classes. These seven food 
classes are: carbohydrates, fats, proteins, vitamines, salts, cellu- 
lose and water. Any daily food ration not containing these in 
proper proportion is defective. 

Class I. Carbohydrate made up of the chemical elements, 

carbon, hydrogen and oxygen, includes all starches and sugars 

and is a fuel food. Its combustion in the body 

Food produces heat and energy. The carbohydrates 

Elements make up a large part of the food value of grains, 

fruits, and vegetables. 

Class II. Fat is another but more concentrated fuel food 
also containing carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen. This food 
element we have in butter, oils, fat meats, nuts, egg yolks, 
olives, in the alligator pear, the soy bean; also to some extent 
in other legumes, in grains, and in vegetables. 

Class III. Protein is the muscle and tissue builder. It 
contains, in addition to carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen, another 
very important chemical element called nitrogen, by reason of 
which it is often spoken of as nitrogenous food. Protein also 
contains variable amounts of other chemical elements as phos- 

9 



TO THE HOME DIETITIAN 

phorus, sulphur, and sometimes iron, but its distinctive element 
is nitrogen. This food is found in a pure state in egg white, 
casein of milk, and in lean meat. In a combined form it 
makes up part of the food value of grains, vegetables, legumes, 
and nuts. 

Class IV. Vitamines, our knowledge of which is still some- 
what limited, are doubtless the substances out of which the body 
makes its internal secretions, digestive enzymes, and the fer- 
ments of vegetative life processes. They are found in raw, and 
in fresh vegetables, in fruit, in raw milk, in the outer covering 
of grains, and in raw meat. 

Class V. Salts, both organic and inorganic, are made up of 
many different chemical elements and are necessary for blood 
making and tissue building, for the carrying on of various 
metabolic and secretory processes, and to maintain the proper 
alkalinity of all body fluids. They are found principally in 
fruits, vegetables, grains, and milk, and are located with the 
vitamines largely under the skin of fruits and vegetables and 
in or near the outer covering of grain. 

Class VI. Cellulose is really a carbohydrate but being 
practically indigestible, is placed in a class by itself. It makes 
up the woody framework of fruits and vegetables. Its value is 
in its bulk which by its presence mechanically stimulates the 
bowel, thus aiding in normal intestinal peristalsis. 

Class VII. Water plays an important part in the many 
chemical reactions and tissue changes continually going on in 
the body, it holds the various salts in solution, it makes up 
the principal part of all body fluids and secretions and, as a 
circulatory medium, it helps to make it possible for the body 
to regulate its own temperature. 

All food is built up in nature's laboratory by a process called 
synthesis; For example, take the apple which is made up chiefly 



THE CYCLE OF LIFE 11 

of fruit sugar and cellulose with accompanying vitamines, 
salts, and water. The sugar and cellulose both belonging to 
the carbohydrate class contain the chemical elements car- 
bon, hydrogen, and oxygen. 

The chlorophyll, or green coloring matter of the plant first 
manufactures starch, obtaining its carbon from the ever present 
carbonic acid gas or carbon dioxid (C0 2 ) of the 
Nature's air and giving back to the air the oxygen. Water 
Laboratory (H 2 0), coming up through the roots with its 
hydrogen and oxygen, supplies to the chloro- 
phyll these elements to complete the process of starch making.* 

From some of this starch cellulose is made and later as the 
apple ripens the remaining starch is changed into sugar. 

In the same way the elements necessary for the vitamines 
and salts are obtained from the soil. All are combined in a 
wonderful way until we have as a result the finished product, 
the apple ripened and tinted by the sun. 

Before it can be utilized in the body, however, a very differ- 
ent process goes on. From the time the apple is seized by 
the teeth the process becomes one of disintegration or analysis, 
begun by the mechanical action of mastication. It is continued 
by the muscular activity of the digestive tract until the food 
becomes a thoroughly liquified mass. 

But these physical changes are not sufficient. That the 
food may be yet more completely simplified and dissolved, 
certain juices are poured out along the digestive 
A Twofold tract which break up the food molecules into still 
Phase of more simple forms that the next important step 
Digestion may take place with the greatest ease and com- 
pleteness. Thus chemical action in addition to 



*The chemical formula for starch is (C 6 H 10 O 5 )n. The formation of 
starch in the plant may be represented by the chemical equation: 
6 C0 2 (carbonic acid gas) + 5 H 2 (water) = C 6 H 10 O 5 (starch) + 12 
(oxygen). 

The starch remains as a part of the plant— the oxygen returns 
to the air. 



12 THE HOME DIETITIAN 

mechanical action prepares the food for the process of absorp- 
tion into the body proper, where it may repair and build the 
tissues and produce the necessary heat and energy for the effi- 
cient conduct of all body processes. 

In this digestive process all starch is changed to sugar (See 
footnote page 72), all complex sugars to simple sugar or dex- 
trose, fats are emulsified, and proteins are reduced to simpler 
forms called proteoses, peptones, and amino-acids. Many of 
these processes can be carried on to some extent outside of the 
digestive tract; thus we have certain predigested foods such as 
dextrinized cereals in which the starch has been largely changed 
to sugar by extreme heat, e. g. oven toast, shredded wheat, corn 
flakes, etc. Likewise fats may be eaten in an already emulsified 
form as in nut butter and cream. The sugar of fruit being in 
the form of dextrose and laevulose (See footnote page 74), 
needs but little digestion. 

Starch digestion begins in the mouth and is completed, 
with the simplifying of the complex sugars, in the small intes- 
tine. The solution of protein and its change into proteoses 
and peptones begins in the stomach and is completed, with its 
final reduction to amino-acids, in the intestine. The prepara- 
tion of fat for absorption is carried on entirely in the 
intestines; first by a process of saponification (soap formation) 
and emulsification, then by a splitting up into more simple 
parts (See page 68). 

Thus the digestive tract becomes a great preparation cham- 
ber, a carburetor, as it were, where the food is transformed 
into a simple state and put into solution so 
A Carburetor that it can easily be taken up by the blood 
and thus carried to and properly utilized 
by the body cells. 

Strange as it may seem, the digestive tract must be consid- 
ered physiologically as outside of the body proper. It is 
simply a tube extending through the body, but not connected 



THE CYCLE OF LIFE 13 

with it except by an absorbing medium, the mucous membrane. 
It is continuous with the outside world from which it receives 
food substances and into which are discharged those parts 
which cannot be prepared for reception by the blood and 
tissues. The lining membrane of the digestive tract tries 
carefully to guard the body cavity against intrusion into it of 
substances which are undesirable or might do harm and, nor- 
mally, after careful preparation only that part of the food 
which can serve as material to replace worn out tissue or as 
fuel to produce heat and energy is passed on into the blood. 

However, as the result of putrefactive processes going on 
in the intestine certain poisons are also carried through the 
mucous membrane. These would quickly prove 
A Sentinel fatal were it not for the faithful liver which 
stands as a sentinel to prevent these toxic ma- 
terials from gaining entrance into the general circulation. 
The liquified and simplified food passing through the mucous 
membrane of the small intestine enters many tiny bloodvessels 
or capillaries which carry it to the portal vein through which 
it is carried to the liver. Here the poisonous substances are 
filtered out to be transformed by the liver cells into harmless 
materials and the purified food, passes on into the general 
blood stream.* The liver also acts as a great storehouse for 
sugar, this part of the food entering the system according to 
body demands. 

If, as a result of dietetic errors, intestinal putrefaction is ex- 
cessive, the amount of toxic material taken up by the great 
absorbing surface of the small intestine may be so great that 
even the ever vigilant liver is unable to filter out these poisons 
and to prevent their entrance into the blood where they are 
carried throughout the body causing various kinds and degrees 
of ill health. 



♦The digested fat, called chyle, does not pass with the other food 
to the liver, but is absorbed directly into the lymphatic system. 



14 THE HOME DIETITIAN 

Even though the food has been received by the blood, its 
analysis is not yet complete but is carried on still further in 
connection with a form of oxidation or combus- 
The Cycle tion. During this process the nutritive sub- 
Of Life stances are utilized by the tissues and finally, 

being reduced to a simple state, they are elim- 
inated as waste by the lungs, skin and kidneys. Now they can 
again be taken up by the plant and combined into materials 
which may be used as food by animals and man. Thus the 
cycle of life goes on, nothing ever lost, each chemical element 
being used again and again. 

Just how these final steps in the process of food analysis are 
carried on in the tissues, we will consider further in the next 
chapter, in connection with the study of metabolism. 



"Down to the last detail the world is made for what is in it; 
and by whatever process things are as they are, all organisms 
find in surrounding Nature the ample complement of them- 
selves.'" — Drummond. 



CHAPTER II. 

The Body as a Stove. Metabolism. 

It is important that we study more fully the oxidation 
processes through which the food passes after it is absorbed 
by the wall of the digestive tract. This final process of food 
reduction is included in the subject, metabolism. 

Food does not arrive at its ultimate destination until it 
reaches the individual cell. Here the nitrogenous portion is 
built up into the cell itself; the carbohydrate and fat afford 
energy for cell activity. Thus new cells are made, old cells 
are renewed, this process of cell building and repair being that 
part of metabolism known as anabolism. 

In connection with the activity and life processes of the cell 
which are made possible by the energy resulting from the 
oxidation or combustion of the food taken up by the cell, 
waste material, made up of broken down cells and the products 
of combustion, is produced which is carried by the blood stream 
to its proper outlet. This process of tearing down and waste 
formation is that part of metabolism called katabolism. 

In connection with these changes of waste and repair, or 
metabolism, the body may be compared to a stove. The food 
is the fuel which is as truly burned in the tissues 
The Fuel as is gas, wood, or coal burned in a furnace. This 
slow combustion is a true oxidation process and 
oxygen is as necessary for the body fires as it is for the more 
rapid oxidation which goes on in the ordinary stove. The 
lungs serve both as drafts and flue and a perfect circulation 
of the oxygen received is made possible by the circulation of 
the blood. The kidneys are the grates through which the ash 
is eliminated. 

The oxidation of carbohydrate results in the production of 
heat, ever transformable into energy, the end products being 
carbonic acid gas (C0 2 ) and water (H 2 0). These are elim- 

15 



16 THE HOME DIETITIAN 

inated through the lungs, skin and kidneys as simple gas and 
water. There is no ash, just as there is none from the burning 
of gas in a gas heater. Starches and sugars are simply fuel 
foods necessary for heat and energy, but have nothing to do 
with tissue repair. 

Tissue repair is the additional work of protein. Protein 
contains nitrogen in addition to its carbon, hydrogen, and 

oxygen. The nitrogen is used in the work of cell 
Tissue building and cell repair. It is the iron of the 
Building stove and, while not needed in such large amounts, 

is of vital importance; for the body stove if not 
kept in constant repair would soon enter a state of dissolution. 
As protein contains the three elements, carbon, hydrogen and 
oxygen, heat and energy may result from the oxidation of this 
part of the protein molecule, some carbon dioxid and water 
being given off, but the distinctive work of this food element 
has to do with its nitrogenous portion. 

The protein molecule is very complex and varies within 
wide limits. Its nitrogen is always combined with carbon, 

hydrogen and oxygen, but is combined with these 
Building in many different ways to form different kinds of 
Stones proteins. The arrangement of the nitrogenous 

combinations in the food proteins is different than 
in that of the tissue proteins, so after the breaking down process 
that the food undergoes in connection with digestion the nitro- 
genous links are put together again in the various necessary 
combinations to form the many kinds of tissue. A complete 
protein contains seventeen or eighteen of these nitrogenous units 
which are called amino-acids and have been likened to building 
stones. (See chapter VI, page 60.) Rearrangement of these 
amino-acids makes possible the formation of the tissues that go 
to make up the body. (An amino-acid contains the rad- 
ical N H.,.) 



THE BODY AS A STOVE 17 

As the result of cellular activity and oxidation a definite 
solid ash is formed in which form the nitrogen is eliminated 
through the body grates, or kidneys, in solution 
The Body in the urine. Urea, uric acid, purins, creatin 
Grates and other allied bodies make up this solid ash. 

The most completely reduced form is urea which 
is the most important end product of protein metabolism, and 
the form in which the greater part of the nitrogen is eliminated. 
There is normally, however, a certain small part of the ash not 
so completely metabolized which must be eliminated as uric 
acid and purins, but these in excess soon become abnormal. 

Any protein not needed for tissue building may be used by 
the body to produce heat and energy, the nitrogen being split 
off and eliminated in the usual way. But 
An Expensive this would be a waste of nitrogen, and a 
Fuel needless task imposed on the excretory or- 

gans. It could not, therefore, be considered 
economy if it were possible to obtain this energy from the 
strictly fuel foods that leave no nitrogen for elimination. This 
use of nitrogen would be analogous to burning iron in a fur- 
nace. While it might be possible it would hardly, under ordi- 
nary circumstances, be considered wise or economical. 

Thus as the result of oxidation and reduction processes, the 
food, whether carbohydrate, fat, or protein, is reduced to a 
simple state which makes complete elimination 
Clinkers from the body possible. If for any reason oxida- 
tion is incomplete the process of elimination is 
greatly hindered; the ash is not finely divided but is full of 
clinkers, the grate becomes clogged and waste products are 
retained which further clog the body stove and the more 
hinder normal oxidation processes. 

For this reason it is important that the body fuel, while suf- 
ficient, be not excessive, that the drafts be kept well open, and 
that there be a free circulation of oxygen. Then the fuel will 



18 THE HOME DIETITIAN 

be thoroughly burned, the ash finely divided and elimination 
will be complete; clinkers will not clog up the grate, back up 
into the stove and the stove will not smoke. The vital fires 
will burn brightly and all organic functions will be carried on 
in a normal way that makes for health and strength.

CHAPTER III. 
Defective Food Analysis. Auto-intoxication. 

We have seen that the passage of the food through the body 
means a gradual reduction from a complex to a simple state. 
That this reduction should go on in a normal way and at a 
normal rate is all important. Certain conditions, chiefly 
dietetic errors, result in great interference with these processes, 
both while the food is still in the digestive tract and after 
absorption when it has been taken up by the blood and tissues. 
The first — slow and imperfect digestion; the second — faulty 
and incomplete metabolism. 

The first and most common defect in food analysis is in the 

process of mastication. Carelessness in regard to this most 

important initial process lies at the foundation 

A Serious of much of the imperfect digestion in the lower 

Defect alimentary tract. 

As the result of imperfect disintegration in the 
mouth food substances are hurried into the stomach faster and 
in larger amounts than they can properly be received and cared 
for. Food received by the stomach in normal, well masticated 
portions, already in a semi-liquid state, begins at once to leave 
the stomach, the amount taken in continually bearing such a 
relation to that passing out that at no time is the organ over 
distended and thus handicapped in its muscular movement.* 



*X-ray study has shown that the liquid portion of the food begins 
at once to leave the stomach, the more solid portions remaining for 
further digestion. As the acid contents of the stomach rush through 
the pylorus (the outlet of the stomach) into the first part of the 
small intestine, or duodenum, the pylorus closes, the bile and the 
pancreatic juice flow through a common opening into the duodenum 
neutralizing by their alkalinity the acidity of the food material from 
the stomach. As the contents of the duodenum become neutral or 
alkaline the pylorus relaxes and more of the gradually liquifying food, 
or chyme, passes out of the stomach. Again the reflex effect of the 
acid fluid on the duodenal mucous membrane causes a contraction of 
Jhe pyloric sphincter and the stomach outlet is closed, the same 
alternating process to be continued until stomach digestion is com- 
plete and the organ is at rest. The length of time required depends 
upon the amount, kinds, and combination of food taken into the stom- 
ach and varies normally from two to six hours. 

19 



20 , THE HOME DIETITIAN 

But the rapid introduction into it of improperly prepared 
material at once tends to overwhelm the stomach and would, 
could it be seen, produce as unsightly a spec- 
An Unsightly tacle as the crowding of the mouth so full of 
Spectacle food that mastication be made awkward and 

almost impossible. This food not having 
been properly reduced before swallowing, requires an exces- 
sive amount of churning by the stomach wall which is already 
handicapped by over distention. 

Incomplete mastication means hurried eating. Hurried eat- 
ing leads to overeating because the introduction of food has 
been so rapid that the nerve impulses have not had time to 
return with their message "enough", and thus by the time the 
sensation of hunger has disappeared an excess of food has 
been taken. Everyone knows how, if called away from a hur- 
ried meal, appetite perhaps still keen, he may return later only 
to find himself satisfied with the food already taken. The 
nerve impulses of satiety take a little time to report, hence the 
advantage of slow eating. If one must eat hurriedly his only 
safety lies in eating within safe limits as to the amount, and 
stopping his meal while yet the appetite may call for more. 

Indigestible food substances, wrong combinations, eating at 
too frequent intervals, all play their part in causing slow and 
difficult digestion and thus hindering the normal passage of the 
food through the alimentary tract. 

Stagnation in the stomach or intestine, whatever the cause, 
means one or all of three abnormal processes. Food must be 
properly digested and absorbed or carbohydrates 
Three will ferment, protein will putrify, fats will be- 

Results of come rancid. These processes take place in the 
Delay digestive canal as quickly as outside of it and 

often sooner because the conditions of tempera- 
ture and moisture are ideal for germ growth. 



A UTO - INTOXICA TION 21 

In the stomach, because of the presence of the germicidal 
hydrochloric acid, germ activity is hindered and under normal 
conditions made impossible. But under the conditions men- 
tioned above fermentation often takes place resulting in "sour 
stomach", gas formation, and a general bad state of affairs. 

In the intestine, the food having been longer on the way and 
the secretions being alkaline instead of acid, germ activity goes 
on to a great extent. Under normal conditions this 
Germs at may even assist in the dissolution of the food, but 
Work very quickly under conditions of slow digestion 

and retention food decomposition becomes abnor- 
mal, fermentation and putrefaction are set up, resulting in the 
formation of gases and irritating substances that greatly inter- 
fere with peristalsis and with the completion of digestion. The 
amino -acids, instead of being allowed to pass unhindered 
through the mucous membrane into the blood, are broken down 
by the germs into decomposition products. Poisons are 
formed which being absorbed often overwhelm the liver, get 
by into the blood stream, and slowly but surely intoxicate the 
individual. As the result of carbohydrate fermentation alco- 
hol and kindred products may be formed, the absorption of 
which may produce symptoms of chronic alcoholism in the 
total abstainer. The absorption of the products of protein 
putrefaction, becoming excessive and acute. 
Self spells "bilious attacks" or perhaps "ptomain 

Poisoning poisoning," but oftener in a chronic way these 
poisons gradually do their work causing 
abnormal fatigue, lowered nerve tone, irritable nerves, head- 
aches, sallow skin, lowered vitality, and functional disturb- 
ances of any or all of the organs. 

Thus in this great preparation chamber there may be prepared 
for absorption, poisons as well as food. The food itself being 
incompletely digested, much of it may not be absorbed and so 
may never reach its destination. The cells instead of receiv- 



22 THE HOME DIETITIAN 

ihg their needed nourishments are handicapped by poisons and 
their activity is enfeebled. This condition of poisoning from 
one's own digestive tract is known as "auto intoxication," or 
self poisoning and is widespread, lying at the foundation of 
many of the ailments and diseases that beset the civilized race. 
With those who are naturally robust it may seem that the 
limit of work imposed upon the stomach and intestine need 
only be determined by the appetite and in- 
A Reckoning clination of the individual. But be the diges- 
Time tive organs ever so strong, what with the in- 

gestion of incompletely masticated food in 
unlimited kind, variety, and amount, perhaps improperly pre- 
pared or in combination with substances difficult of digestion, 
there will come a time when these faithful organs will be 
unable to do the work given them to do, even though the 
amount of work be decreased to normal limits. And often long 
before symptoms directly referable to the digestive tract mani- 
fest themselves, the amount of putrefaction may have reached 
the stage where the vitality is greatly lowered, signs of toxemia 
appear, and gradually but surely the health and efficiency of 
the individual is undermined. 

There are many who, having a smaller amount of inherent 
strength in the digestive organs, feel sooner the results of the 
conventional careless habits of eating. Not realizing the cause 
of their earlier symptoms they continue in their dietetic mis- 
takes until a radical program which admits to the alimentary 
canal only the simplest and most easily digested food is neces- 
sary to give the organs of alimentation the opportunity to catch 
up as it were, and to lay in a store of reserve strength that 
they may perchance at some future time be able to carry on a 
normal amount of work. 



AUTO- INTOXICA TION 23 

This type of person is sometimes spoken of as the auto- 
intoxication type and he is found in all stages and in all 
grades. Under this head comes the one who eats 
A Type but grows thinner and wonders why; the one who 
suffers from the occasional bilious attack and cer- 
tain type of sick headache; the nervously exhausted individual 
with aches too numerous to mention and symptoms as varied as 
temperament and susceptibility may differ; the dyspeptic, sal- 
low, thin, despondent, suffering from indigestion, gastric dis- 
tress, constipation and "gas", the digestive organs unequal to 
their task accomplishing the little they do by much coaxing, 
the tenderest of care, and artificial aid. 

The cause of anemias and serious organic disorders of the 
nervous system is coming more and more to be considered 
referable to excessive putrefaction in the intestine, 
Anemias with a slow absorption of poisons. 

And thus we have a picture of some of the vari- 
ous conditions often resulting when the first steps in body food 
analysis or reduction are not carried on properly. No one 
can estimate the reserve strength of his digestive organs. 
Often the one who early has evidence of a weak digestion is the 
one fortunate because he is of necessity led to careful dietetic 
habits. And therefore it were well could all adopt a sensible, 
sane plan of eating, following natural law, eating for strength 
and not for drunkenness, wisely selecting and preparing their 
food, and partaking of it in such a way as to assist instead of 
hinder nature in her efforts to utilize it to the best advantage. 



'Is life worth living? It all depends on the liver." 



CHAPTER IV. 
Defective Food Analysis — Continued. Suboxidation. 
As has already been suggested, there are those who suffer 
little, if any, from digestive disturbance, because they are en- 
endowed by nature with great vitality and organic 
Results strength. 

More They can "digest anything", can eat at any time, 

Remote anything their palate calls for, and never suffer the 
discomforts of indigestion. One's first thought 
might be, How fortunate are these! but that is 
not entirely true of them; for their carelessness and ignorance 
in connection with alimentation will lead to a condition of ill 
health more remote perhaps, but as truly the result of dietetic 
errors as are those of the previous class and often these results 
prove more disastrous in the end. 

These diseases come under the head of metabolic disorders 
and, in the light of our comparison of the body to a stove, we 
will speak of them as conditions due to suboxida- 
Another tion and of the individual suffering from them as 
Type belonging to the suboxidation type. In these per- 

sons oxidation is imperfect, elimination of cell 
waste is incomplete, the tissues become clogged with sub- 
stances which should be eliminated, the grates or kidneys do 
their work incompletely and "the stove smokes." The "fires 
are banked." 

As has already been made plain in a previous chapter, pro- 
tein metabolism results in the formation of a solid ash which 
is in the form of urea, uric acid*, purin bodies, creatin, and 

*Uric acid (C 3 H 4 N 4 O s ) and the purin bodies as Xanthin, hypo- 
Xanthin, etc., are very closely related both chemically and physio- 
logically to each other and to the caffeine (C s Hi N 4 62) of tea and 
coffee and the theobromine (C 7 H* N t Oo) of cocoa. Uric acid and 
the purins result principally from the metabolism of the neucleo-pro- 
teins. Neucleo protein is abundant in meat, especially in glandular 
tissue as liver, sweetbreads, etc. A purin free diet is one in which 
meats, and tea and coffee are excluded. Purins are found also to an 
extent in some other foods as, e. g. eggs and legumes.

SUBOXIDATION 25 

certain other related substances. The most important of these 
is urea in which form most of the nitrogen is eliminated. 

In order for this ash to be properly eliminated it must be 
finely divided by a process of oxidation and analysis. Imper- 
fect metabolism is always associated with suboxidation and 
the result is an excess of an incompletely oxidized protein ash, 
which backs up in the blood stream as "clinkers." These 
accumulate in the joints producing rheum- 
Rheumatism atism, so called, and in the muscles they are 
the cause of lumbago and myalgia; along 
the nerve sheaths their irritating presence may produce 
neuritis; accumulating in the blood vessel walls, they cause 
the arteries to lose their supple, elastic quality and to become 
hard, stiff, and brittle, which in the end means high blood 
pressure, an over-worked heart, and often apoplexy, angina 
pectoris, and heart failure. The kidneys in their effort to elim- 
inate an excess of waste and that in an imperfectly prepared 
form are over-worked and Bright's disease may be the result. 

While all of these conditions do not come to one individual, 
and to many only in minor degree, yet the ever increasing oc- 
currence of these diseases with, because of them, the lowered 
life expectancy of the man past forty bears witness to the fact 
that metabolic disorders are becoming more prevalent and 
must be reckoned with in the struggle for race conservation. 

With defective protein metabolism is ever associated suboxi- 
dation of carbohydrate and fat, which still further clogs the 
body stove. (See page 68.) Carbohydrate, containing the 
same chemical elements as fat, is readily 
A Cause changed over in the tissues into fat, and these 

Of Obesity two food classes instead of being used up in en- 
ergy production may be stored excessively as 
adipose tissue and this often at the expense of muscle.

thus adding another factor in the causation of the ever increas- 
ing condition of suboxidation. 

But this "suboxidation type" of person has a good digestion 
with its accompanying good appetite, is fond of rich concen- 
trated food and, unaware that his ills are directly due to his 
wrong habits of eating, he goes blindly on overloading his 
body furnace with fuel that it can not oxidize or eliminate 
and that only serves to increase the clinkers that hinder the 
burning of the vital fires. 

Often it is not the bulk of the food intake, but its concen- 
tration in fats and sweets that determines its excess, and as we 
study further the question of food values it will be seen how 
easily food can be taken in excess of body needs. 

While some may suffer from under feeding, yet in conditions 
of prosperity the diseases of the race due to improper alimenta- 
tion are the result, almost entirely, of an excess of food, rather 
than the result of a deficient amount, a condition of under- 
feeding sometimes following on as the result of conditions 
caused primarily by a too abundant food intake. 

Again we will enumerate the conditions necessary for per- 
fect oxidation and thereby make evident the remedy. 

1. Proper kind and amount of fuel — a prop- 
Important erly balanced food supply in direct proportion 
Conditions to body needs. 

2. Open drafts — (a) An ample supply of 
oxygen through the lungs, (b) The carrying of the oxygen to 
every cell by a free circulation of the blood, made possible only 
by exercise. 

3. A finely divided ash, free from clinkers, so that thorough 
elimination may be possible. This may necessitate a limited 
intake of fuel for a time, giving the body a chance to burn up 
what is already on hand in excess. 



SUBOXIDATION 27 

The subject of eating cannot be separated from that of the 
oxygen we breathe in, and the exercise we are able to take. 
An ample supply of oxygen must reach the lungs, 
Exercise but oxygen which goes no further than the lungs 
does the tissues no good. It must be carried 
throughout the body by the blood, a perfect circulation of 
which is possible only under conditions of more or less vigor- 
ous exercise. The freely moving blood stream carries both fuel 
and oxygen to the cells and thoroughly washes tissue, muscle, 
and organ from waste matter, carrying these wastes to their 
avenues of elimination. 

Often the person suffering from suboxidation reaches the 
point where, because of obesity, fatty heart, or high blood 
pressure, exercise is impossible. Under these conditions the 
problem of increasing the circulation and the metabolic proc- 
esses, becomes largely one of diet regulation, the exercise, of 
necessity, being largely passive as in massage and manual 
Swedish movements. 

The intelligent treatment of obesity, with its allied conditions, 
by diet adjustment upon the basis of measuring the fuel supply 
is most satisfactory, the treatment of no abnormal condition 
promising more sure results.* 

Defective food analysis, whether in the digestive tract or in 
the tissues, lessens the alkalinity of all body fluids producing 
a more nearly acid condition of the blood. Acids are formed 
as the result of fermentation and abnormal food decomposi- 
tion in the intestinal tract, and as the result of cell waste and 
katabolism in the tissues, (f) These wastes not being prop- 



*To those who desire to study more fully the dietetic treatment 
of obesitv, we would recommend that amusing- and instructive little 
book by Dr. L. H. Peters, "Diet and Health with Key to the Calories." 

f(b) There is a difference in the acidity of the ash resulting from 
the metabolism of various foods, e. g. the metabolism of meat yields 
an acid ash, that of vegetables an alkaline ash. Most fruits are base 
forming, thus increasing the alkalinity of the blood, (See chapter VIII) 
while cereals furnish in their metabolism a preponderance of acid. 



28 THE HOME DIETITIAN 

erly oxidized and eliminated lessen the alkalinity of the blood 
because of the excess of acid products. (See footnote page 69.) 
As diseases of metabolism are so common and most of them 
due to an improper food supply, the understanding of food 
values, both as to quality and quantity, becomes a very impor- 
tant matter. How we may measure our food intake easily, but 
scientifically, and make this knowledge of practical value, we 
will consider in our next chapter. 



'"Our bodies, in other words, should be such good machines 
that their running ivill cause no creaking or jolting" — Hoxie. 



CHAPTER V. 
The Food Unit or Calorie. 
Of the seven food classes three are oxidized in the body and 
may be measured by the calorie or heat unit. In this way we may 
as easily measure our body intake of fuel as 
How Much can the manufacturer who estimates the amount 
Fuel ? of coal necessary to furnish the energy required 

to run the machinery of his plant. Every 
ounce of protein, fat, or carbohydrate taken into the tissues 
produces a definite amount of heat. Heat can always be con- 
verted into energy. 

The instrument used in measuring the heat value of food is 
called a calorimeter, and simply described is this: — A double 
chamber, in the inner chamber a given quantity 
The of food, e. g. an ounce of sugar; in the outer 

Calorimeter chamber a given quantity of water of a known 
temperature. The food in the inner chamber 
is ignited by an electric spark. When the burning is complete 
the temperature of the water in the outer chamber is taken 
and the increase in temperature shows the energy or caloric 
value of that food. 

The amount of heat required to raise the temperature of a 

pound of water 4 degrees Fahrenheit, or 1 degree centigrade is 

a calorie. The slow combustion of an ounce of food 

The in the body tissues will produce the same amount of 

Calorie heat as though oxidized rapidly in a calorimeter. 

By experiment it has been found that the heat 
value of a gram of pure water-free protein, e. g. the casein of 
milk, egg albumen, fibre of meat is four calories; of a gram 
of pure carbohydrate as starch or sugar, four calories; but of 
a gram of fat more than two times as much, or nine calories. * 



♦More accurately — 1 gram of protein equals 4.1 calories: 1 gram of 
carbohydrate equals 4.1 calories; and 1 gram of fat equals 9.3 calories. 

29 



30 THE HOME DIETITIAN 

An ounce equals about thirty grams, therefore multiplying the 
above figures by thirty, gives the number of calories per ounce. 
Different foods contain varying amounts of these oxidizable 
substances; accordingly the caloric value of food stuffs de- 
pends upon the amount of protein, fat or carbohydrate thev 
contain; e. g. an ordinary slice of bread weighing 1*4 ounce, 
or 38 grams, contains approximately 4 grams of protein, 2 
grams of fat and 16 grams of carbohydrate, the 16 grams re- 
maining being water and cellulose. 

4 grams of protein equals 16 calories 

2 grams of fat equals 18 calories 

16 grams of carbohydrate equals. _ 64 calories 

Total 98 calories 

Or approximately 100 calories. 

By a little study one may very easily become familiar with 
the approximate values of common foods and be able to arrive 
at some conclusion as to the correctness of one's daily food 
ration in its amount and proportion of food elements. Many 
would be surprised to find how far short their diet comes 
from the ideal which if followed would result in the maximum 
of health and strength. 

It is very easy to remember that one slice of bread contains 
100 food units, one egg 75, a glass of milk 150, an average 
potato 125, a tablespoonful of average cream 
A Practical about 40, a serving of cooked cereal 75 to 100 
Application calories, an ordinary serving of green and leaf 
vegetables 25 to 50, depending upon the 
amount of fat or milk added, average serving of legumes 100 
to 150 calories; also that desserts are higher in food value, 
ranging from 125 calories for a simple custard or junket to 
350 for one-sixth of a pie. See table given below. These and 
many others in a short time become very familiar to the 
housewife interested in food values. 



THE FOOD UNIT OR CALORIE 31 

The amount of food required by the individual varies with 
height, age, sex and muscular activity, but for the average per- 
son 2000 calories may be taken as a working 
Food basis. One above average height will need 

Requirements more perhaps. Other things being equal, men 
need about ten per cent more than women. If 
engaged in active, muscular labor, the requirements may be 
2500 to 3000, or even more in the case of a farmer, a lumber- 
man, or a soldier. Those of sedentary habits often do better 
on less than 2000, even as low as 1500 or 1600. This will de- 
pend upon the height, temperament, and natural tissue activity. 

An obese individual or one suffering from the results of im- 
perfect oxidation, as manifested in rheumatic joints, high blood 
pressure, may do well for a time on as low as from 1000 to 
1200 food units daily, with marked relief from symptoms and, 
if obese, a reduction of from one to four pounds per week. 

The amount of protein needed does not vary within such 
wide limits. The amount remains more nearly constant and 
should be from 200 to 300 calories in twenty- 
How Much four hours, even though the total ration be low. 
Protein? On the average ration this would be about ten 

per cent of the entire daily food intake, but if 
one does well on the low ration as suggested above, the protein 
must not be reduced proportionately but should be kept near 
the normal of at least 200 calories; for the body, not being 
able to store this repair material in excess, must have it sup- 
plied to it in regular daily amounts. 

The fat intake should be from 400 to 800 food units per 
day.* A study of food values soon makes it very evident 

that the average individual takes much 
How Much Fat? more than this amount in his daily food 

ration. The remainder of the total calor- 



*This need not be in the form of free fat. Many foods contain a 
high proportion of fat, as milk, eggs, olives, nuts. 



THE HOME DIETITIAN 



ies is made up of carbohydrate. Fat and carbohydrate can to 
an extent be substituted one for the other, but an excess of fat 
should be avoided. This we will discuss in a later chapter. 

The first of the following tables gives the approximate en- 
ergy value of the cooked and ready to serve foods commonly 
used. An effort has been made to arrange them so 
Food that the housewife may be able to see at a glance 

Values the food value of the average helping of the various 
dishes appearing upon her table, and the proportion 
of protein, fat, and carbohydrate contained in each. These 
percentages are of the total number of food units and not of 
the weight. Fractions and decimals have been disregarded in 
most cases. 

Because of the variation in recipes for the same dish, many 
of the figures in the following tables can only be approximate, 
but given the ingredients, the value of any dish may be esti- 
mated with a fair degree of accuracy by the use of table No. 2. 
(See page 48.) This table gives the value of staple food stuffs, 
both raw and cooked, used in cooking and in the making up of 
various recipes. From this table the housewife may easily 
estimate the calories contained in a serving of any dish she 
may prepare. 

Take for example the following recipe: —

THE FOOD UNIT OR CALORIE 33 

Therefore each serving of soup will contain 96 calories, of 
which 27 is protein, 7 is fat, and 62 is carbohydrate. 

Put the spinach and onion through the meat chopper, follow- 
ing them with the bread to prevent waste. Put into a double 
boiler with the milk and cook until tender. This is a rela- 
tively high protein dish, over ^4 of the calories being protein, 
and shows a good use for skimmed milk and stale bread. 
Try it.

CHAPTER VI. 
A Balanced Ration — Protein. 

As has been made plain in previous chapters, it is very 
necessary that the food supply be correct, not only as to total 
amount, but also as regards its proper balance, 
Ample i. e. it must contain the various food elements in 

Supply proper relation one to the other and to the entire 

Important intake. While this is true of all the food ele- 
ments, it is undoubtedly in the normal adjust- 
ment of the protein part of the diet that mistakes are 
most often made and with the most serious results. While 
an excess of fat is harmful, yet a comparatively small 
amount may not be deleterious providing it is of the right 
kind and the necessary food units are made up in carbohy- 
drates. But with the protein, error may easily be made on 
either side and, while much has been said in regard to protein 
in excess, quite as much stress should be laid on the impor- 
tance of getting enough. 

Tissue repair being dependent upon nitrogen, it is obvious 
that enough protein is needed in the food to supply the neces- 
sary nitrogen to rebuild worn out cells.* The ideal balance is 



*The normal adult body should be kept in nitrogenous equilibrium, 
i. e., the protein intake equal to the outgo. The intake is proportion- 
ate to the food ingested; the outgo is indicated by the nitrogen elim- 
inated in the urine, which can be determined by laboratory tests. The 
body is out of nitrogenous equilibrium when the protein intake is not 
sufficient to replace worn out tissue as in cases of depleted food sup- 
ply, or in disease with insufficient food ingestion or assimilation. Here 
thd intake is less than the outgo and if continued death must finally 
result. 

The body is also out of nitrogenous equilibrium when protein is 
used not only to replace worn out cells, but also to construct new 
tissue. This is the case in convalescence from wasting disease, as in 
fevers, tuberculosis, etc. In these cases the ingestion is in excess of 
the elimination, and should continue so until a normal balance is 
reached. Normally the growing child takes in more protein than 
eliminated because of continually developing cells and tissues. Here 
again the body is out of nitrogenous equilibrium, but necessarily" so, 
and should be on the safe side of an ample supply. In some cases of 
suboxidation the nitrogen eliminated is less than the amount ingested 
because of an excessive intake and insufficient activity of the organs 
of elimination. This lack of balance is abnormal and results in 
disease.

the one that supplies to the tissues the amount and kind of pro- 
tein essential for its specific purpose and not a great deal in 
excess of that amount. Protein cannot be stored in the tissues 
in excess and so must be supplied to the body in regular daily 
amounts, the amount needed varying within much narrower 
limits than that of fat and carbohydrate and much less de- 
pendent upon varying conditions of exercise. 

Unless engaged in very active muscular exercise, 2000 to 
2500 food units is sufficient for the person of average height, 
and many leading sedentary lives do much better 
Protein on from 1600 to 1800 in twenty-four hours. All, 

Ration however, need from 200 to 300 calories daily of 

Constant protein. If one requires 2000 calories total and 
200 calories of protein the amount of . protein 
necessary would be 1-10 or ten per cent of the total ration. 
But if an individual of sedentary habits needs only 1600 calor- 
ies, total, he would still need the 200 protein units, making 
his necessary protein 12^ per cent. It is very important then 
to bear in mind that the amount of protein should remain 
comparatively constant and that if, for any reason, the total 
food intake be low the protein must not be materially reduced. 

This is well illustrated in the treatment of obesity. If the 
daily amount of protein be kept up to nearly normal, a marked 
reduction in the total food intake may be made without incon- 
venience to the patient. 

On a ration of 1000 or 1200 food units daily, with an up- 
keep of protein of from 200 to 250 calories, a weekly loss in 
weight of two to four pounds may be ac- 
An Obesity complished and the individual not suffer from 
Cure hunger but maintain his strength and carry on 

his regular daily duties. In fact the body being 
gradually relieved of an unnecessary burden, various asso- 
ciated ailments due to suboxidation (See chapter IV) disap- 
pear and one feels well rewarded for any self-denial necessi- 



58 THE HOME DIETITIAN 

tated. Such a regimen should, however, be carried out under 
the supervision of a physician and often combined with grad- 
uated exercise and tonic baths. 

An abnormally low protein aliment leads to anemia, tuber- 
culosis, malnutrition, nervous exhaustion, and other chronic 
and functional disorders. 

But how may we know whether or not our protein ration is 
properly related to our total daily intake? By referring to the 
tables of food values as given in Chapter V 
How to Know the percentage of protein in various foods 
may readily be seen and, with a knowledge 
of these proportions, the higher protein foods may be combined 
with the foods lower in nitrogen in such a way as to maintain 
the necessary protein percentage, thus giving to the body this 
tissue building element in the normal amount. 

Those who partake freely of meat are in no danger of defi- 
ciency in protein, their danger lies in getting an over supply; 
but vegetarians often make the mistake of 
Overeat and unbalancing their daily ration so as to 

Undereat at overeat and to undereat at the same time. 

The Same Time Their foods are often combined in 
such a way that it is necessary for 
them to overeat of the total amount in order to obtain the 
body requirement of nitrogenous food ; thus we frequently find 
such an individual poorly nourished and unsatisfied while at 
the same time he suffers the effects of overeating and indi- 
gestion. 

In the preparation of food the protein balance is often dis- 
turbed by the addition of an excess of fat or sugar or both. 
Take for example an Irish potato containing 100 
Protein calories, ten calories or ten per cent of which 

Balance is protein. Add to this 50 calories of butter. 

Disturbed The protein calories still remaining ten, the 
percentage of protein is now 6%. Likewise 



A BALANCED RATION— PROTEIN 59 

beans, always considered a high protein dish, may be made 
a medium or even a low protein food by the addition of a free 
amount of fat in their preparation. An ordinary serving of 
oatmeal with whole milk contains about 150 calories of which 
27 calories or 13 per cent are protein. If to this, 50 calories 
of sugar are added, and cream with its high percentage of fat 
used instead of milk, the serving has been reduced from a high 
to a low protein dish, the amount of protein being even as low 
as 8 per cent of the total food units. If cream were used but 
no sugar, the percentage of protein would drop to 9!/2- The 
addition of the cream and sugar greatly increases the total 
food value without adding any protein. 

Even the homely but much depended upon article of diet, 
bread, has a goodly proportion of protein, 12 to 16 per cent. 
(See table, chapter V.) But as ordinarily 
Bread as a eaten with butter, marmalade or jelly it de- 

Protein Food scends greatly in the scale as a protein food. 
For example, one slice of whole wheat bread 
equals 100 calories, of which 15 calories are protein. Adding 
to this 50 calories of butter, the total food value becomes 150; 
the protein calories still 15 makes the relation of protein to the 
total just 10 per cent. Foods served in this way may be most 
excellent foods, but if every dish is so prepared that it con- 
tains 10 per cent or less protein it is quite evident that there is 
great danger of the protein intake being too low unless the 
entire food ration be kept high, which might in many cases 
make the total more than necessary for body needs. 

Then too it must be remembered that many foods, as 
fruit, desserts, sweets, etc., contain practically no protein so 
that somewhere in the daily ration there must be food contain- 
ing much more than 10 per cent protein. 

A farmer who needs from 3000 to 3500 food units daily, or 
perhaps more, easily gets his necessary protein even while 
living on medium and low protein foods. He uses 



60 THE HOME DIETITIAN 

up the excess of carbohydrate and fat in the energy he 
expends in his active labor; but the one who needs, 
because of a sedentary life, to be careful not to 
overeat must take the more highly protein 
The Brain foods. Brain workers, or those who expend 
Worker nervous rather than muscular energy, need a 

comparatively high protein ration with a low 
total intake. They must live on the higher protein foods. 

A person convalescing from a wasting disease must have 

ample protein to rebuild tissue, but often his digestive organs 

are not equal to the task of caring for a total 

The amount of 2000 or more calories. So the diet 

Convalescent for such a one must be so planned that the 

proportion of the tissue building elements be 

high in order that enough of this may be supplied even though 

the entire daily intake must of necessity be lower than normal. 

Many thin people would gain in weight more readily on a 

diet supplving a goodly amount of protein, with less of the 

carbohydrate and fat and even a low total daily 

If You Are ration, than on one in which the entire food 

Too Thin intake is pushed to an extreme degree, imposing 

an extra tax on the digestive organs in their 

effort to care for an excessive amount of food material which 

never can be gotten ready for absorption and utilization by 

the tissues. 

There is another important phase of the protein question 
that must be considered. We have referred in chapter II to 
the complex structure of proteins and to the fact 
Complete that complete proteins contain some seventeen 
Proteins nitrogenous combinations called amino-acids. 
These seventeen parts may be arranged in many 
different ways to form various kinds of body tissue. Proteins, 
in order to repair every kind of tissue, must contain all of 
these seventeen units and such proteins are said to be complete. 



A BALANCED RATION— PROTEIN 61 

There are other proteins in which some of these important 
combinations of nitrogen, or "building stones," are missing 
and so are incomplete. Some of the important amino-acids 
are, tyrosin, trytophan, leucin, lysin, glycocoll, cystin, histidin, 
and arginin. 

It is quite evident then that all proteins are not of equal 
value to the body and that a diet may be deficient in the quality 
of its protein as well as in the quantity. While 
Quality this question is not yet well understood, yet as 

As Well the result of animal experimentation some- 

As Quantity thing of the nature of the various food proteins 
has been ascertained. For example, it has 
been shown that some proteins will maintain but will not induce 
growth. Rats fed on corn fail to grow, but develop properly if 
their diet is supplemented by casein of milk, egg yolks, the 
proteins of other grains as the glutenin of wheat, glycenin from 
the soy bean, globulin from squash seed, globulin from cotton 
seed, excelsin from Brazil nuts, and globulin from maize or 
corn.* 

It has been found that an animal does not thrive if fed on a 
single cereal grain even though the amount of protein be 
theoretically correct and the total food units be 
Grain sufficient. This seems to be due, in part at least, to 

Proteins the fact that many of the grain proteins are in- 
complete. This does not mean that grains are not 
good foods, but simply that the diet must be varied enough so 
that incomplete proteins may be supplemented by complete 
proteins or with proteins supplying the missing links. 

♦Quoting- from L. B. Mendal, who has done much work along this 
line: "When the gliadin of wheat, a prominent protein of this seed, 
is fed as the sole protein, adult animals are suitably maintained; but 
growing animals cease to increase in body weight, remaining in nutri- 
tive equilibrium without growth unless the amino-acid lysin is added 
to the gliadin food. Thereupon growth is promptly resumed. The 
explanation becomes apparent in the fact that gliadin is almost en- 
tirely devoid of the amino-acid lysin; and inasmuch as this is obviously 
needed for new protein construction, growth can not proceed until the 
missing unit is supplied. Again zein, the most conspicuous protein of 



62 THE HOME DIETITIAN 

Two proteins both incomplete may be deficient in different 
ways so that the combination of two or more incomplete pro- 
teins may be sufficient to supply all the nitro- 
Combination genous combinations and thus make a corn- 
Important plete protein food.f 

A monotonous diet of grain being also 
deficient in alkaline salts (see footnote, page 27) and, as or- 
narily prepared, lacking in certain vital substances called 
vitamines by Funk, care must be taken that these be supplied 
in other ways. (See Chapter IX.) 

A single grain usually contains more than one protein as, 
e. g. wheat with its gliadin, a protein that will maintain body 
weight, and its glutenin, one which will stimu- 
The Protein late growth, and while zein a prominent protein 
Of Corn of corn is unable to even maintain the body, yet 

corn also contains another protein called globu- 
lin which will maintain and even cause growth. If intelli- 
gently combined with other foods, corn is a valuable addition 
to the dietary. It, however, could not be depended upon as a 
sole source of protein. It is interesting to note that the protein 
of green vegetables will supplement the protein of corn. 

The proteins of meat, milk, and eggs have been found to be 
complete in themselves. Accordingly a diet of grains and 
milk is a complete food in so far as its proteins are con- 
cerned. Recent experiments have shown that the protein of 
the peanut and the soy bean are\ of very good character. 

the maise kernel, fails to yield either lysin or tryptophan or glycocoll, 
and accordingly is entirely inadequate to meet the nitrogenous needs 
of the animals in respect to either maintenance or growth. It may 
be fed in the greatest abundance, yet the animals decline in health 
unless the zein is supplemented by some more perfect protein. If the 
amino acid tryptophan is added to the imperfect maise, protein main- 
tenance of body weight without growth is promptly established. . . . 
If both tryptophan and lysin are added to the zein, the diet thereupon 
becomes suitable for growth." — Journal of American Medical Associa- 
tion, Sept. 5, 1914. 

fThe proteins of the pea or bean, when taken as the sole source of 
nitrogen, are of very low biologic value, and they will not supple- 
ment the protein of corn though they improve the protein of wheat. 
Bean protein will not supplement those of oat, though pea proteins 
and oat proteins are said to supplement each other. 



A BALANCED RATION— PROTEIN 63 

Again we would emphasize the need for a knowledge, by the 
vegetarian, of foods and their values that the meatless diet may 
not prove to be a deficient one. A complete diet 
Know without the use of flesh food is very possible and a 
Foods great advantage, but care must be taken that intelli- 
gent combinations be made and that monotony be 
avoided. Green vegetables and fruits supply many elements 
lacking in grains and with a knowledge of food values and 
an intelligent daily variation in foods served, 
Avoid one need be in no danger of limiting his diet 

Monotony to one deficient either in quantity or quality of 
protein. But how important that the housewife 
be educated along these lines and so be understandingly effi- 
cient as she carries on the important work of supplying the 
family table. 

Following are grouped some of the more important staple 
protein foods in such a way as to show at a glance those having 
the highest proportion of the nitrogenous element.* With 
these, many attractive dishes may be prepared and, as meat 
substitutes, supply the necessary protein.

CHAPTER VII. 

» 

A Balanced Ration — Fat 

Fat makes up an important part of the dietary. It is fuel 
for the body in a concentrated form. It contains carbon, hy- 
drogen, and oxygen and, with the car- 
A Concentrated Fuel bohydrates, furnishes heat and en- 
ergy* in its oxidation in the body. 
Ordinarily about % to 1/3 of the food supply should be fat 
or from 600 to 800 calories. Under conditions where the 
body fires need to burn more brightly, as in cold 
How Much climates or in excessive exercise, the body needs 
Fat? more fuel and so can utilize and take care of 

more of this concentrated food.f 
However, the menu of the average family contains much 
more of this food element than the 1/3 given as the normal pro- 
portion. Instead of 600 or 800 calories, the 
An Excess amount usually runs up to more than 1000 calor- 
ies. Four hundred to 600 food units of butter 
alone may be daily consumed by the one who, not realizing 
the need for a more nearly balanced ration, carelessly follows 
his inclination in this respect. When to this is added the fatty 
seasonings in the other foods served, the normal fat content of 
such foods as olives and nuts, legumes and grains, cream and 
milk, the excess of fat not only tends to bring the total food 
ration far above the normal, but often overwhelms the diges- 

*The three common classes of fat are, stearin, palmatin and 
olein. Stearin (C 57 Hn O ) makes up a large part of beef and mut- 
ton tallow, and having a higher melting point than the other fats, is 
in a solid form at ordinary temperatures. Palmatin (C 5 i H 98 O ) is 
found in human fat, in all animal fats and to an extent in vegetable 
fats. Olein (C57 H i0 4 O e ) , having a low melting point and so in the 
form of oils, is found to a greater extent in vegetable fats as in olive 
and cotton seed oils. 

fRecent scientific investigation goes to show that of the vita- 
mines essential for life some are soluble in fat and of the fats in- 
cluded in the diet some should be in such form as to ensure the pro- 
vision of this valuable vitamine. (See chapter IX, page 83.) 

66 



A BALANCED RATION — FAT 67 

tive tract and tissues with an amount of fat far exceeding the 
ability of the body to properly utilize and eliminate. 

Recent calculations show that the average consumption of 
fat per capita a day in the U. S. is 150 grams, which equals 
1350 calories daily. (See page 29.) While 
Average Hoover reports that during his two years' experi- 

Per Capita ence in Belgium the ration allowed contained 
40 grams or 360 calories of fat, 60 grams or 
240 calories of protein and 300 grams or 1200 calories of car- 
bohydrate, making a total of 1800 food units daily. This was 
found entirely sufficient for the entire population except for 
adolescent children, for whom an extra allowance of fat was 
made. Surely the difference between the 360 fat units actually 
required and the 1350 used by the American people represents 
a great excess in the use of this kind of food. 

Fat is supplied to us in two forms: free fat and combined. 
Combined fat is found in nuts, olives, grains and in le- 
gumes, especially the soy bean. It is also 
Fat Free found in other vegetables and in some fruits, 

And Combined as the alligator pear. Fat is not found in 
nature as a free fat, but by mechanical proc- 
esses can be isolated. So we have butter, oils, free animal fats 
as suet, tallow, lard, etc. The fat of cream is in an emulsified 
form and is not a free fat until it is made into butter. 

Tht fat-soluble vitamine (See Chapter IX) is found in 
milk, eggs, and butter, and also in green vegetables. In this 
respect it becomes largely a question of quality rather than of 
quantity, and while vegetables can not be said to supply fat to 
any great extent, yet they contain a sufficient amount to hold 
in solution this valuable vitamine. 

Taking a hint from nature it would seem that the plan 
was not for our food to contain fat in a free state, but in a 
form which could more readily mix with the digestive juices. 



68 THE HOME DIETITIAN 

In the stomach an excess of free fat, by lubricating the food 
and thus preventing its mechanical action, hinders the flow 
of gastric juice and also interferes with the thorough mixture 
of the digestive fluid with the stomach contents. 

All free fat must be thoroughly emulsified before it can be 
digested or before the digestion of other food elements can be 
accomplished. This process of emulsification 
Digestion takes place in the intestine and until it is accom- 
Hindered plished all digestion is to a greater or less degree 
hindered. This is particularly true of protein. 
The oily coating about the protein particles hinders the action 
of intestinal fluids on the protein, thus furnishing another fac- 
tor in the causation of intestinal putrefaction and auto-intoxica- 
tion. This stagnation also allows the fat itself to become 
rancid. ; producing products irritating to the mucous lining. 

After fat is digested and absorbed it should be completely 
oxidized into carbon dioxide (C 2 ) and water (H 2 0) with 
resulting heat production and, as carbon dioxide 
Fat and water, eliminated through the lungs, skin 

Metabolism and kidneys. If more fat is ingested than can 
be oxidized into C 2 and H 2 0, one of two 
things happens: either the excess is laid up as fat in the tissues 
with perhaps resulting obesity, or an attempt is made to throw 
off the excess in an imperfectly oxidized form and again we 
have a "stove that smokes." 

Fatty acids are combinations of carbon, hydrogen, and 
oxygen into which the complex fat molecule is broken up on 
its way to complete disintegration. To an extent 
Fatty they are formed normally in the process of fat diges- 
Acids tion. Abnormally they are formed when fats become 
rancid either on the pantry shelf or in the digestive 
tract as the result of delayed digestion. The subjection of 
fats to extreme heat as in frying also results in the formation 
of fatty acids. 



A BALANCED RATION — FAT 69 

If in connection with metabolism the oxidation of fats is 
incomplete, the process often stops at the fatty acid stage and 
in this form the body seeks to eliminate them.* 
Eczema The excretion of these products of an imperfect 
Pimples metabolism takes place through the skin and mu- 
Catarrh cous membranes and, because of their irritating 
action, they increase the tendency of a susceptible 
skin to eczema, acne, pimples, boils, etc., and of the mucous 
membranes to catarrh. 

This result is often made the more probable because of the 
accompanying intoxication resulting from the intestinal stasis 
(stoppage) brought on or increased by the presence of a large 
amount of free fat in the intestinal canal. 

These conditions of irritation are increased if before 
fats are eaten they are broken up by heat into these same 
fatty acids, as happens in most frying and cooking 
Frying at extreme heat.t This decomposes the fat so that it 
at once manifests its irritating properties as it reaches 
the delicate lining of the stomach; and at the same time the 
coating of fat which the food receives in frying greatly hinders 
the mixing of the gastric juice with the food particles. 

So it is important that in our dietetic program which is to 
make for health our plan should be, first — to properly balance 
our daily fat ration, second — to eat the minimum 
The Ideal amount of free fat and, third — to eliminate as 
far as possible the use of fried or greasy foods. 
An ample amount of fat can be supplied the body in the form 
of olives and nuts and in other combined forms without the 
use of fat in a free state. It should be remembered that the fat 



*This excess of fattv acids in the blood may be a factor in the pro- 
duction of a lessened alkalinity of the body fluids, often spoken of as 
acidosis. (See page 27.) 

fThe peanut as it is ordinarily prepared for the market loses much 
of its dietetic value. The roasting at a high temperature to a certain 
extent decomposes the fat of the nut, thus lessening its digestibility. 
Peanuts would serve a better purpose as a food if they were pre- 
pared by boiling or baking as are other legumes. 



70 THE HOME DIETITIAN 

taken in olives can be utilized by the body to much better ad- 
vantage than if taken as olive oil. For those who need for a 
time an extra amount of concentrated food, cream may be 
taken with advantage, but this can easily be overdone. 

Whenever fat is used as seasoning it is much better to add 
it after the food has been removed from the fire so that it may 
not be subjected to intense heat. The addition of fat to vege- 
tables greatly lessens their digestibility and if cooked property, 
it is surprising how palatable such foods may be without 
the addition of butter or oil. (See recipe number 51, Chap- 
ter XXII.) 

It is a fact worthy of mention that the vegetable oils, espe- 
cially olive oil, are not so quickly broken up into fatty acids 
as are animal fats, more particularly butter. Butter being 
rather unstable, quickly becomes rancid and soon decomposes 
when subjected to heat. For this reason it is not ideal for the 
seasoning of cooked foods and should be used carefully. This 
with the fact that disease of animals is rapidly on the increase 
makes the question of the free use of butter one not only of 
economy, but also of health. 

Instead of the excessive use of fats and oils in frying, equally 
satisfactory results may be obtained by braising or broiling, 
using only enough fat to slightly oil the pan. 
To Fry Even an egg may be "fried" without grease by 
Without dropping it on a perfectly smooth hot iron skillet 
Grease or on a soapstone griddle. 

With a little interest and care we will find it 
possible and quite as easy to prepare our foods in a way that 
will yield results in added health, and at the same time satisfy 
the most epicurean taste. 



CHAPTER VIII. 
Carbohydrates — Their Place in the Daily Ration. 
The total food ration being kept near normal limits and 
fat and protein taken in proper amounts, the question of 
the proportion of carbohydrate obviously takes care of itself; 
but there are a few things in regard to this important fuel food 
that should be kept in mind. 

The great bulk of food is carbohydrate, one of the seven 
great food classes. To this class belong starch, sugar and 
cellulose. Cellulose is not digested and serves 
Cellulose merely as bulk, but when acted upon by strong 
acids it may be changed from cellulose to starch ; 
from starch, through the stages of dextrin and maltose, to glu- 
cose the simple sugar which all digestible carbohydrate be- 
comes before it is absorbed from the intestinal tract. All plant 
fibre is cellulose, the woody framework of trees, and even 
cotton. A story is told of a man who took a dirty shirt which 
had been worn by a tramp and, after washing it, put it through 
various chemical processes which changed it from the cellulose, 
which it really was, into glucose from which he made a de- 
licious confection. However the digestive tract can not digest 
cellulose, so it passes through unchanged, simply serving as a 
broom to keep the bowel clean and as bulk upon which this 
muscular tube can exercise itself. 

All sugar is at first starch. Unripe fruit contains starch 
rather than sugar, but as the fruit ripens the starch is changed 
to fruit sugar and this sugar is the simple form of 
Starch carbohydrate which requires no digestion and is 
known by the names, glucose and dextrose. In vege- 
tables starch is stored up in the plant, only a small portion of 
it becoming sugar. The carbohydrate of grains is mostly in 
the form of starch. Certain foods such as the Irish potato, 
polished rice, white bread contain a large proportion of carbo- 

71

hydrate in the form of starch and are often spoken of as 
starchy foods. 

The important difference in these forms of carbohydrate is 
that the starch must be changed into sugar during the process 
of digestion. Sugars may be classified as: Dextrin, 
Sugar Maltose, Sucrose, Glucose (or dextrose) and Laevu- 
lose (see footnote, page 74). The formation of dex- 
trin is the first step in the process of the change of starch into 
sugar. (See page 12.) Maltose is the next step. It is formed 
in the malting of grains, during thorough mastication, and in 
the intestine where the process of starch digestion is completed 
by the action of the amylopsin of the pancreatic juice. 

Cane sugar or sucrose is the most complex sugar. It is 

formed in plants such as the sugar cane, the maple, and the 

sugar beet. In the process of digestion it is 

A Complex changed into the absorbable glucose.* Honey 

Sugar is a combination of cane sugar and fruit sugar, 

and because of its content of predigested fruit 

sugar it has an advantage as a food over the pure cane sugar. 

The process of digestion completed, carbohydrate is absorbed 

in the form of glucose. It is then changed in the liver to a 

form called glycogen and is dealt out to the body 

Glycogen as it is needed. 

In the tissues the oxidation of sugar produces 
heat and energy, and it is eliminated as carbonic acid gas 
(C 2 ) and water (H 2 0). Normally a certain amount of 
A ,., carbohydrate is changed over into fat and depos- 

-p , itea in the tissues as reserve tuel. In this re- 

spect carbohydrate and fat differ from protein in 
that protein can not be stored as reserve for future use. 

*The chemical formula for starch is (C Hi 5 )n, for dextrin (C 6 
Hio Or,)n, for maltose C12 H 22 O n > for cane sugar Ci 2 H22 On, for dex- 
trose or glucose C 6 H 1C O . The change from starch into sugar may 
be represented by the following chemical equation: 2 (C 6 H u O.-,) + 
Ho O = C12 N22 On; or maltose. The change from maltose or from 
cane sugar, as the case may be, into the simple sugar glucose, is 
shown by the following: Ci 2 H 22 On (maltose) + H 2 (water) = 
C H 12 Oo 6 (glucose) + C 6 Hi 2 06 (glucose) or two molecules of glucose. 



CARBOHYDRATES 73 

In cases of sulfoxidation clue to lack of exercise or where the 
food intake is in excess of body demand, this storing of the 
carbohydrates in the form of fat may become excessive and 
obesity result. 

Diabetes is an abnormal condition in which the oxidation of 
sugar is interfered with and sugar, instead of being used by the 
tissues, is dealt with by the blood as a foreign sub- 
Diabetes stance and, eliminated by the kidneys as glucose, 
is found as such in the urine. This metabolic dis- 
order is not well understood, but is probably due to some 
abnormality in the internal secretions which govern the oxida- 
tion processes. 

One great harm resulting from an excess of food containing 
starch is in the extra tax placed upon the digestive tract be- 
cause of the amount of digestion required by 
Starchy Food starch, mastication so often being incomplete. 
In Excess The increased length of digestion time may 

mean fermentation with the formation of irri- 
tating acids and gases which distend the bowel and prevent 
peristalsis, thus causing distress and flatulence. 

This dietetic error is often a mistake made by vegetarians, 
who, not understanding how to balance their daily ration, take 
an excess of starch in their effort to get enough food. Starchy 
foods are often devitalized foods (See chapter IX), another 
reason for a tendency toward sluggishness in the process of 
their digestion. Well cooked rice, however, because of the 
mechanical ease with which it mixes with the gastric fluids, is 
easily digested. As browned or dextrinized rice (See recipe 
21) it becomes one of the most easily digested of foods. 

The individual who has a good digestion may eat a large 
amount of starchy food and suffer no inconvenience, save per- 
haps an increase in avoirdupois. This increase in weight is, 
however, more liable to be the result when an excess of sugar 
or fat is taken. 



74 THE HOME DIETITIAN 

The amount of cellulose well tolerated by the digestive 
tract all depends on the inherent strength of its muscular wall. 
Some can take a large amount of bulky food; 
Roughage others find food containing much cellulose diffi- 
cult of digestion. All, however, need a certain 
portion of cellulose or "roughage" to stimulate the bowel to 
its normal muscular activity. Much depends on the prepara- 
tion of the food, the time spent in eating it, and the thorough- 
ness with which it is masticated. With thorough mastication 
many of the bulkier foods ordinarily considered indigestible 
may be well taken and properly handled by the digestive tract. 

The form of carbohydrate which as food places the least tax 
upon the digestive organs is dextrose, this, as we have seen, 
requiring no digestion. This is found in fruit as fruit 
Fruit sugar.* So in fruit we have a naturally predigested 
Sugar food together with cellulose which by reason of its 
bulk is a natural laxative. The exquisitely flavored 
acid of fruit which adds so much to its desirability is not only 
an appetizer and a delight to the rjalate, but has a definite dis- 
infectant action in the digestive canal. It lessens bac- 
Fruit terial activity in the mouth, sweetens the stomach, 
Acid helps to check intestinal fermentation and putrefac- 
tion and thus markedly lessens the formation of 
poisons resulting from germ activity in the alimentary tract. 
It is well known that the acid fruits such as the lemon, orange, 
and grape fruit help to clear up a coated tongue, sweeten the 
breath and are good for a "torpid liver" and "biliousness." 
The bitter principle in grape fruit is said to act particularly on 
the liver. 

The fruit acid is a direct stimulant to the gastric and in- 
testinal glands, increasing the flow of digestive juices. It 
also stimulates the muscular wall of the stomach and bowel, 

♦Fruit sugar is made up principally of glucose or dextrose and a 
closely related sugar of practically the same chemical composition 
called laevulose. 



CARBOHYDRATES 75 

thus in every way increasing digestive activity. For those who 
can not take much cellulose the fruit juices are a great help by 
reason of their natural laxative action. 

The good influence of this delightful food does not, however, 
stop here but is felt in an effective way after it is taken into 
the blood. The food value of the fruit fills a definite place as 
fuel in the body oxidation processes, but it is in the effect of 
the acid upon the blood that the most beneficial action is ob- 
tained. 

The acid of the fruit is in the form of acid salts. These in 
the normal chemical processes of digestion are changed into 
the alkaline carbonates which render the blood 
A Cure for more alkaline. This is a very desirable and 
Rheumatism necessary result, for, in counteracting the acid- 
ity resulting from protein wastes, it helps to 
maintain the normal alkaline reaction of the blood and thus 
tends to neutralize the conditions associated with lessened alka- 
linity as found in rheumatism, gout, etc. (See chapter IV, 
page 27.) 

It was thought for years that fruit increased a tendency 
toward rheumatism, but we know now that this is not the case 
but that most fruits lessen this tendency and so 
Nature's are among the best rheumatic cures.* Fresh fruits 
Medicine are also full of vitamines which adds greatly 
to their healthfulness, and for all these reasons 
fruit might well be considered nature's medicine. 

Some with catarrhal stomachs find that they do not take fruit 
well because of an irritated condition of the mucous membrane 
brought on by some other cause. In this condition the stomach 
lining cannot bear even the normal stimulation of the fruit 
acid and its cellulose. The trouble is not with the fruit but 
with the primary state of gastric irritation. 

♦The exceptions to this are the grape, the prune, the plum and the 
cranberry. They do not affect the alkalinity of the blood as do the 
other fruits, e. g. the apple, the orange, the lemon, grapefruit, etc. 



76 THE HOME DIETITIAN 

In some others, due to abnormal nervous excitation or nat- 
urally irritable mucous lining, an excessive amount of the nor- 
mal acid of the stomach is secreted, and the already irritated 
mucous membrane does not seem to bear well the addition of 
any more acid even though it be the normal acid prepared by 
nature for us as food. However, even in these abnormal 
states, there is usually some way by which fruits or fruit juices 
can be taken and many of these persons do well if they eat 
fruits alone, not trying to combine them with other foods. 

Fresh fruits are more easily digested when eaten without 
cane sugar. When sugar is added to stewed fruits it should 
be cooked with the fruit. In this way the heat and fruit acid 
tend to change the cane sugar into the simple predigested dex- 
trose which results in a more natural and more easily digested 
combination. 

In spite of the abundance of the natural predigested sugar it 
is in the form of cane sugar extracted from its various sources 
and served often in its concentrated form that a large part of 
sugar is ingested. Cane sugar requires digestion. This does 
not take place until late in the digestive process when the food 
has traversed a large part of the digestive canal. This delay 
often results in fermentation, especially when the sugar is com- 
bined with food requiring some length of time in stomach 
digestion. 

In its concentrated form cane sugar is very irritating to 
mucous membranes, very marked inflammatory effects being 
produced when solutions stronger than from 
An Artificial 6 to 10% are taken. Yet it is in this form 
Food that millions of pounds per year are con- 

sumed by the American people, and to this 
excess may be ascribed another cause for various digestive trou- 
bles, to say nothing of an excessive fuel supply in its effect on 
metabolism. In nature cane sugar is given us in a diluted form, 
even honey consisting largely of fruit sugar. This should sug- 



CARBOHYDRATES 11 

gest to us that concentrated cane sugar is an artificial rather 
than a natural food. 

Children are educated from babyhood to like sugar and the 
"sAveet tooth" so universal among them is more often a re- 
sult of wrong training than a natural instinct. 
The Sweet The susceptibility of the child to colds, ca- 
Tooth tarrh, adenoids, enlarged tonsils, croup, bron- 

chitis is often greatly increased by this error in 
diet together with an excess of fat and greasy foods (See chap- 
ter VII) ; and wise is the mother who, knowing this, feeds her 
child in such a way that the foundation for chronic catarrh 
and digestive troubles is not laid. 

We quote from Dr. Kerley in Archives of Pediatrics, Oct. 
1914: "Cane sugar was not cultivated until 300 years ago 
and as late as the 16th century it was used 
A Highly largely as a condiment as honey is used at 

Energized Food the present time. Countless millions existed 
and lived their span without it. Now we 
require 40 pounds a year per capita. It requires no great 
strain on the imagination to believe that the introduction of so 
large an amount of highly energized food in excess of demands 
might produce ailments of a very definite character. It is 
noteworthy that, as the refined product came into common use, 
it was first employed only in medicine 'to render unpleasant 
and nauseating drugs grateful to the sick.' Gradually sugar 
was found of value in preserving fruits and then added to tea, 
wine and various beverages until its acceptability as a food for 
the sick and its value as a source of energy in sustaining arti- 
ficially fed infants came to be appreciated. Then only (about 
1600) was the substance commonly recognized as a food. 
What the result has been can not be better summarized than in 
the words of Mosely, written in 1800. 

" 'Two centuries have elapsed since it can properly be said 
that sugar has become an ingredient in the popular diet of 



78 THE HOME DIETITIAN 

Europe. Such is the influence of sugar that once touching the 
nerves of taste no person was ever known to have the power of 
relinquishing desire for it.' " 

Sugar is present in mother's milk in just the right proportion 
for the babe and the only reason that sugar of any kind is 

added to the formula used in artificial feeding 
Sugar in of infants is to adjust the cow's milk so that it 

Infant's Milk will contain the food elements in the same 

proportion as in mother's milk. As the chil- 
dren grow older much harm is done them by adding sugar to 
their cereals, by feeding them cakes and desserts in which sugar 
is served in a concentrated form. (See Chapter XIX.) 

The banana is a food of great value. Too often it is eaten 
unripe and in this form is indigestible because of its high 

content of raw starch. In the process of 
The Banana ripening this starch is changed to sugar and 

the ripe banana with its yellow brown-speckled 
peel is a food of exquisite flavor and easy of digestion It 
should, however, be properly masticated. Too often it is 
gulped down without sufficient mastication. The food value 
of the banana is similar to that of the potato. Its percentage 
of protein is somewhat lower, but its proportion of alkaline 
mineral salts is about the same. Baked in the skins or pre- 
pared as croquettes, bananas may be served as vegetables and 
may often be substituted for foods higher in price, but perhaps 
lower in actual food value. (See recipes 89 and 90.)

CHAPTER IX. 

VlTAMINES. 

"It has thus far been shown that nutrition means fuel for 
the machinery, new parts with which to repair the machine, 
and minute quantities of 'vitamines' which produce a har- 
monious interaction between the materials in the food and 
their host." — Lusk. 

"Vitamines are ferments of life, substances without which 
a food does not keep one healthy even though on a balanced 

ration." — Evans. 
Ferments Funk says: "Vitamines are mother substances 

Of Life of digestive ferments and of body hormones as 

thyroid secretion and other internal secretions. 
Food may be ever so nourishing, but if without vitamines, the 
body can not construct its own ferments and carry on its own 
vital activities." 

Years were spent in investigation before it was found that 
beri-beri, a disease of the Orient, could be cured and prevented 
by the addition to the diet of the nutritive elements 
Beri beri ordinarily thrown away in the polishings. Just 
what these nutritive elements were was not un- 
derstood, but the fact remained that a diet of polished rice re- 
sulted in symptoms of beri-beri, while a diet of the unpolished 
grain was sufficient to prevent any manifestation of the dis- 
ease; In Java where the people lived largely on whole rice, 
beri-beri was unknown. 

For years it has been a recognized fact that sailors living on 
canned and preserved foods sooner or later contract scurvy, 
but that this disease is speedily cured by the addi- 
Scurvy tion to their diet of fresh vegetables or the juices of 
fruits, especially the orange and the lemon. In 
1535, when all but three of Cartier's 110 sailors had scurvy, he 
cured them all by giving them a decoction of fresh pine needles.

Babies fed on pasteurized milk often contract infantile 
scurvy but may be cured in a remarkably short time by the 
addition of orange juice to their diet. Potato water and other 
vegetable broths may be given these babies with the same bene- 
ficial effect, the symptoms of scurvy rapidly disappearing. 
When fed on oats or barley only, guinea pigs die from scurvy, 
but if the grain is moistened and allowed to sprout, i. e. in a 
way converted into fresh vegetables, the disease is prevented. 

Pellagra, a disease of the Southern States, manifests itself 
largely among a class of people living on a monotonous diet 
of corn bread, bacon, biscuit and syrup. Gold- 
Pellagra berger's experiments in the State penitentiary in 
Mississippi, showed that many cases of pellagra 
resulted when the inmates were kept upon a diet of white flour, 
grits, cornmeaL fried mush, brown gravy, sweet potatoes, coffee 
with sugar and syrup. The introduction of oatmeal and fresh 
vegetables practically eliminated the pellagra. 

"The regular diet of thousands of the poor people of the 
Southern States during the winter contains little besides corn 
bread, molasses and a small amount of salt 
A Restricted pork. After three or four months of such a 
Diet diet large numbers of them develop pellagra. 

That the cornmeal which is eaten has in itself 
nothing to do with the production of pellagra is evident from 
the fact that the disease occurs with those who have not eaten 
corn products in the period preceding the attack. Corn rightly 
used is a wholesome foodstuff, and there is no warrant for the 
belief sometimes expressed that it is the cause of pellagra. It 
is the restricted character of the diet which is undoubtedly ren- 
dered unsatisfactory by several factors operating simultane- 
ously, and not corn or any other single food which caused the 
disease. When the character of the diet is improved by doing 
away with an excess of alkali (baking soda) in cookery and by 
the introduction of a wider range of foods . . . many of 



VITAMINES 81 

the milder cases of the disease recover." — Ten Lessons of Food 
Conservation, U. S. Food Administration, p 50. 

No matter how plentiful in "calories" the diet, it be- 
came apparent that there might be a deficiency elsewhere 

with disastrous results to the body and thus the 
Deficiency term "deficiency disease" originated. Unmistak- 
Diseases ably beri-beri and scurvy come under this head 

and the above observations strongly suggest that 
pellagra is also a deficiency disease. There are some investi- 
gators who believe that a predisposition at least, to rickets in 
children, to eczema, and even to such infections as tuberculosis 
and pyorrhea may result from a diet deficient in certain vital 
elements. Dr. A. S. Gray says that pyorrhea is the "result of 
lowered vitality from lack of those organic com- 
Pyorrhea pounds other than the proteins which CasimirFunk 
and other investigators prove to be present in 
fresh vegetables and in lime and other fruit juices, small quan- 
tities of which are absolutely essential to growth and health." 
Gray also says: "A diet largely composed of sterilized milk, 
corn flours., starch and sugar, or of any foods subjected for a 
long period to a temperature above 250° may be considered 
vitamineless and will predispose to tuberculosis, beri-beri, pel- 
lagra, rickets, scurvy, osteomalacia, etc." 

Casimir Funk, a Russian, working along this line, perfected 
some experiments that resulted in added light being thrown 

upon this most interesting subject. He was able 
A Vital to produce experimental beri-beri in pigeons by 

Substance feeding them for three weeks on polished rice. 

Then if they were fed the polishings from this 
same rice they were cured of their symptoms in a remarkably 
short time, showing that in the rice polishings were certain ele- 
ments absolutely essential to life. What could this vital sub- 
stance be? 



82 THE HOME DIETITIAN 

By a series of experiments he finally isolated from the rice 
polishings a minute crystalline substance, of which, two pounds 
of rice polishings yielded about one-half a grain. 
A Rapid Injecting under the skin or into the crop of a dying 
Cure pigeon three-tenths of a grain of this crystalline 

material was sufficient not only to make it well in a 
few hours, but also to keep it so for two weeks while on a diet 
of polished rice. 

This precious crystalline substance, which contained nitrogen, 
Funk called vitamine from "vita" meaning life 
Vitamine and from "amine," a nitrogenous chemical com- 
pound closely related to the proteins. 
Much has yet to be learned in regard to this wonderful life 
giving substance and whether or not it is really an "amine" is 
still a debated question, but experiments by Funk and by other 
investigators as well have given evidence quite sufficient to 
help us materially in planning a diet that will completely 
supply the body needs. In addition to a sufficient diet as 
regards the caloric value of our food, it is quite as important 
that daily we obtain in some way an adequate 
A Battery amount of this wonderful vitamine; the battery, 
as it were, which keeps in operation the vital 
body processes and makes possible a utilization by the body 
of food materials. 

Just what may be the relation of vitamines to the proteins is 
as yet not fully determined, but it has been demonstrated that on 
a diet composed largely of carbohydrate more 
Vitamine as vitamine is needed by the body than when a 
Related larger amount of protein is taken. In other 

To Protein words that there is a direct relation between 
the quantity of carbohydrate to be metabolized 
and the amount of vitamine needed, carbohydrate metabolism 
seemingly influenced to a great extent by the presence of this 
vital element. At any rate, though all need an ample supply 



VITAMINES 83 

of vitamine foods, yet the vegetarian and the one living on the 
low protein ration need even more an abundant supply of these 
ferments of life. Perhaps the protein with its nitrogen con- 
tent can to an extent take the place of the vitamine when this is 
for any reason deficient. 

Again we are reminded of the importance of supplying to 
the body a sufficient amount of nitrogenous food. Babies fed 
largely on sugar as found in many proprietary foods 
Rickets with their deficiency of protein may get fat and 
seem to do well for a time, but often manifest symp- 
toms of rickets which are relieved when the child is put upon 
a diet containing less carbohydrate, more protein and a goodly 
supply of vitamines. 

Reference has been made in a previous chapter to the con- 
clusion drawn from laboratory experiments that young animals 
will not thrive and develop on a monotonous cereal diet be- 
cause the proteins are incomplete. It has been shown that the 
supplying of the missing protein links is not sufficient for nor- 
mal development unless with these are furnished these vital 

elements called vitamines. That vital 
A Vitamine That element which has to do with proper 
Induces Growth growth is said by some investigators to 

be a fat soluble chemical substance and 
supplied in foods containing fats as fat meat, egg yolks, and 
milk. (See Chap. VII, footnote, page 66.) It is not present 
in refined oils as olive and cotton seed oil, it is not present in 
lard, but is found in butter fats and cod liver 
In Green oil. It is also found in the germ of grain and 

Vegetables in green and leaf vegetables, as even these con- 
tain enough fat to hold in solution the minute 
quantities of this important substance. The germ of grain 
may be at times difficult to obtain, but green and leaf vegetables 
are always on hand, and these not only supplement incomplete 
proteins, but also furnish vitamines and the fat soluble sub- 



84 THE HOME DIETITIAN 

stance necessary for the proper growth.* (See page 120.) 
Might not the disadvantage of a cereal diet lie largely in the 
fact that much of the cereal is taken in its devitalized form 
having been robbed of its aleuron layer containing the germ 
of the grain? 

Funk's scurvy and beri-beri vitamine is water (water- 
soluble B) and rather more widely distributed than the fat- 
soluble A.f For practical purposes we may class them 
all as vitamines and by acquainting ourselves with vitamine 
foods avoid any of the results of a devitalized diet. 

What foods then contain vitamines? This is the practical 
question. All raw foods contain them as raw 

Foods That fruit, raw vegetables, raw milk, raw meat; all 

Are Alive fresh vegetables properly prepared and not 
over-cooked ; all whole cereals raw or cooked at 

not too high a temperature, as in a double boiler or, better still, 

in a fireless cooker. 



*The following 1 is quoted from Dr. Graham Lusk as given in an ad- 
dress at the Auditorium, National Museum, Washington, D. C, Au- 
gust 30, 1917: "Two Italian scientists describe how this class of people 
(Italian peasants) live mainly on corn meal, olive oil and green stuffs 
and have done so for generations. There is no milk, cheese or eggs in 
their dietary. Meat in the form of fat pork is taken three or four 
times a year. . . . Little wonder that such people have migrated to 
America, but it may strike some as astonishing that a race so nour- 
ished should have become the man power in the construction of our 
railways, our subways and our great buildings. 

"Dr. McCollum will tell you that the secret of it all lies in the 
green leaves. The quality of the protein in corn is poor but the pro- 
tein in the leaves supplements that of corn, so that good result is 
obtained. Olive oil when taken alone is a poor fat in a nutritive 
sense, but when taken with green leaves these furnish one of the 
peculiar accessory substances, commonly known as vitamines, which 
is present most abundantly in butter fat, and gives to butter fat and 
to the fat in the whole milk its dominant nutritive value. The green 
leaves also furnish another accessory substance which is soluble in 
water and which is necessary for normal life. Furthermore, the green 
leaves contain mineral matter in considerable quantity and in about 
the same proportions as they exist in milk." 

Recent investigation has also shown that carrots contain a con- 
siderable amount of both the water soluble and the fat soluble 
vitamine. 

fThe two vitamines (so-called) that have been definitely isolated 
have been designated as fat-soluble A and water-soluble B. Fat- 
soluble A is necessary for growth; water-soluble B for normal body 
maintenance. 



VITAMINES 85 

Vitamines are abundant in the outer layer and in the germ 
of grain, and they are found just under the skin of vege- 
tables and fruits. They are also present in brewer's yeast. 

They may be destroyed by overheating or drying, or may be 
removed from the food in the process of preparation. Dried, 
preserved and commercially canned foods are 
Foods That vitamineless; also all processed grains as white 
Are Dead flour and polished rice in which the aleuron 
layer has been removed. The vitamines remain 
in the outer coarser portion and are often fed to stock which 
thrive on "shorts" the part of the grain discarded by the human 
animal. It is said that pellagra, which is on the increase in 
America, is more acute and fatal here than elsewhere because 
of the superior machinery used in processing of food. "Food 
is too much polished, too much cooked, too much dried." 

In the paring of vegetables many vitamines are lost; in the 
boiling most of those remaining pass into the water which is 
usually thrown away. Vitamines are destroyed by baking 
powder and soda, a strong argument against the use of these 
powders in the cooking of vegetables and baking of breads. 
Vitamines are more stable in some foods than others; e. g. 
raspberry juice can be boiled one hour without losing its vital- 
ity, while lemon or lime juice can be boiled and kept indefi- 
nitely without becoming devitalized. 

Individuals with weak digestive organs, unable to digest 
bulky food, are often in danger of living on a vitamineless diet 
because their vegetables are pureed, their cereals 
A Danger are processed often in the form of gruels with 
the coarser particles removed, or much of their 
food is dextrinized, superheated, their bread twice baked and

should be remembered that broths prepared from vegetables

*The dietetic value of the leaves of plants (leaf vegetables) as 
compared with the seeds (grains and legumes) has been conclusively 
shown by the experiments of McCollum, Simmonds and Pitz. The 
seed of the plant is its storehouse and aside from the germ, contains 
no living matter. The seed, while rich in caloric food value, has a 
protein of relatively poor quality; it is low in inorganic salts and is 
deficient in the fat soluble vitamine. The leaf of the plant is made 
up largely of living cells. It is the active respiring portion; the 
laboratory of the plant where starches, fats, and proteins are built 
up. This part of the plant supplements the nutritive shortcomings 
of the seed. We quote from McCollum: "From the results of ex- 
periments just described it was necessary to conclude that the leaf 
differs from the seed in that it contains in satisfactory amounts the 
dietary factors which are founds in seeds in too small amounts. 
These include the three inorganic elements, calcium, sodium, and 
chlorine, the fat-soluble A, and a protein supply which supple- 
ments, at least in some degree, the proteins of the seed. These, it 
will be remembered, are the three and only purified food factors 
which need to be added to each of the seeds singly in order to make 
it dietetically correct. It is therefore possible to devise a diet which 
is derived entirely from vegetable materials which will produce nor- 
mal growth and the optimum physiological well-being." — The Newer 
Knowledge of Nutrition. Page 64. "The potato is to be classed with 
the seeds in its dietary properties, because it consists largely of 
reserve food materials and relatively little of cellular elements. The 
results available indicate that if the potato is steamed and the thin

While Feasting it is important that we remember the danger

We quote again from Dr. A. S. Gray, "The wise man takes 
no chances and simply sticks close to nature. This means eat- 
ing simple, properly prepared, unprocessed foods."

CHAPTER X. 
Flesh Food. 

Is flesh food necessary for the maintenance of health? This 
is today a much discussed question. Can health, strength and 
vigor be maintained without the use of meat? 
An Important The weight of evidence falls on the side of 
Question a vegetarian diet and seems to show that 

under present day conditions civilized man 
may reach a more nearly ideal state both physically and intel- 
lectually if he wisely and carefully selects his foods direct 
from nature's table rather than second hand through the flesh 
of the animal. Unquestionably the American people eat far 
too much meat, and much good might be accomplished could 
the ideas of the people in regard to the need for and the de- 
sirability of this class or foods be decidedly modified and the 
amount of flesh food consumed be materially lessened. 

The high cost of living, the need for economy, the growing 
scarcity of meat have called the attention of many to the ex- 
travagance in the use of a food obtained 
An Extravagance from the animal flesh, when it might be 

derived much more economically and in 
a purer state from other sources. 

We will give briefly six reasons why flesh food is undesir- 
able, also evidence to show that physical strength and effi- 
ciency need not be impaired by a diet in which 
Six meat is not included. 

Reasons 1. Excess of protein, resulting in auto-intoxica- 

tion and sulfoxidation. 

2. Uneliminated tissue wastes: uric acid, purins, xanthins, 
creatin, etc. 

3. Poisons resulting from putrefactive processes taking 
place in the animal as soon as life is extinct, as ptomains, etc. 

4. The disease of animals. 

88 



FLESH FOOD 89 

5. ./Esthetic reasons. Suffering of animals, filth of slaugh- 
ter houses, influence of meat eating upon character and dispo- 
sition. 

6. Economy. 

1. Excess of proteins: 200 to 250 calories of protein in 
twenty-four hours is ordinarily sufficient. Except in children 
only enough is needed to replace tissue waste, that is to keep 
the body in nitrogenous equilibrium. (See footnote page 56.) 
More than this is a burden and a handicap. One pound of 
lean meat contains 700 or more calories; most of this is protein. 
(See page 38.) It has been estimated by compe- 
In the tent observers that of the flesh food eaten, one- 

Digestive tenth to one-seventh putrifies or rots in the intes- 
Tract tines. The poisons thus produced are absorbed 

and auto-intoxication, with its train of ills, as 
torpid liver, bilious attacks, sallow skin, despondency, neuras- 
thenia, etc., results. (See Chapter III.) 

When, as the result of active digestive processes an excess of 
protein is absorbed, the human stove becomes over-supplied 
and clogged with fuel. This interferes with proper 
In the oxidation and produces a condition which we may 
Tissues call suboxidation. (See Chapter IV.) This results in 
the formation of clinkers. The grates (the kidneys) 
become clogged, this interfering with complete elimination of 
the nitrogenous ash which backs up in the blood producing, as 
it accumulates in the joints and other tissues, rheumatism (so 
called), gout, lumbago, sciatica, etc. The arteries gradually 
lose their supple, elastic nature, and arterio sclerosis results 
with its accompanying rise of blood pressure and perhaps final 
apoplexy. 

The overworked kidneys often become diseased. Prof. 
Quine, dean of the medical department of the University of 
Illinois, said : "Where one man dies of Bright's disease due to 



90 THE HOME DIETITIAN 

chronic alcoholism, fifty men die of Bright's disease due to 
an excess of protein food, especially meat." 

As a result of the accompanying suboxidation of the carbo- 
hydrates and fats, the individual also becomes obese, often with 
fatty heart resulting in shortness of breath and swelling of the 
ankles; all of these conditions producing the stout, rheumatic, 
apoplectic type of individual we so often see. 

The fires of the system must burn more vigorously in order 
to oxidize protein just as it would require a much hotter fire 

were we to use iron as fuel in our stoves instead 
Meat as of wood or coal. Dr. Hindhede, the great Danish 
A Fuel dietetic authority, says: "Meat is a fierce burning 

fuel, but it seems to burn out the oven itself in 
the long run." 

"Body weight, health, strength, mental and physical vigor, 
and endurance, can be maintained with at least one-half the 

protein food ordinarily consumed. A kind 
A Physiological of physiological economy which, however, 
Economy if once entered upon intelligently entails 

no hardship, but brings with it an actual 
betterment in health." — Dr. Winfield Hall, Professor of Phys- 
iology, Northwestern University. 

2. Uneliminated tissue wastes: The tissue and body fluids 
of the animal, at the time of death, have in them the protein 

ash on its way to be eliminated. Cellular ac- 
Surcharged tivity continues for some time after death, 
With Wastes but elimination ceases, therefore the flesh and 

blood of the animal are surcharged with pro- 
tein wastes, and the one who eats this food introduces into his 
system this ash which must be eliminated in addition to the 
ash formed in his own body. So we have another factor in 
the causation of the conditions mentioned under reason No. 1. 



FLESH FOOD 91 

These protein wastes have much the same chemical compo- 
sition as the caffeine of tea and coffee and the same stimulating 
effect, so that the individual leaving off flesh 
Poisonous food misses this stimulation and thinks he must 
Extractives have meat to give him strength. But that these 
extractives are actually poison is shown by the 
fact that animals die more quickly from starvation when fed 
exclusively upon meat extract than when entirely deprived of 
food. 

We also give the following as quoted from Dr. A. L. Bene- 
dict in the Journal of the American Medical Association of 
September 10, 1910: "A meat broth prepared at a tempera- 
ture above 160 degrees Fah., the coagulation point of albumen, 
contains salts, extractives wihch are mainly excrementitious, 
and a little gelatin, as well as some melted fat, although the 
last is often skimmed off to make the broth more pleasant and 
palatable. In so far as protein is concerned, a 
Egg Tea meat tea made by boiling, cannot be more nourish- 
ing than egg tea, that is to say, the water in which 
eggs are poached, or in plain words, it contains no protein 
nourishment at all, and is, barring certain qualitative and 
quantitative differences, of the same dietetic value as urine." 

The more freely the flesh is drained of the blood, the freer is 

the meat from these excrementitious products, so we can see 

the wisdom of the Lord's instruction to the chil- 

A Wise dren of Israel, when He said: "Only ye shall not 

Provision eat the blood; ye shall pour it out upon the earth 

as water." — Deut. 12:16 

We quote from Harrington and Richardson's Practical Hy- 
giene, page 91: "The Jewish method of slaughtering is re- 
garded by many as far superior to any other. According to 
Dembo ; it is the most rational from a hygienic standpoint, 
since the animal is bled rapidly and completely." 



92 THE HOME DIETITIAN 

So meat, if eaten at all, should be thoroughly cleansed of 
all its juices which, in the minds of many, would detract greatly 
from its desirability. 

3. Poisons resulting from putrefactive processes: The 
ever present germ begins its work upon the flesh of the 
animal as soon as life is extinct, and decomposition be- 
gins immediately. The products of putrefaction are not all 
poisonous, but very often deadly poisons are formed and 
poisoning produced by decayed meat and fish is not an un- 
common occurrence. This form of poisoning is known as pto- 

main poisoning, ptomains being organic bases 
Ptomain resulting from the activity of bacteria on nitro- 

Poisoning genous matter. These ptomains may be formed 
after the meat has been eaten, through changes 
occurring in the intestines as the result of the excess of pro- 
tein and the stagnation in the bowel. However, decomposition 
has, in most cases, progressed to a great extent before the meat 
is digested. Often meat is not considered ready to eat unti: 
it has reached a certain stage of putrefaction and perhaps is 
ready to fall to pieces. 

Food Inspector Dodge, of the District of Columbia, testi- 
fied that families of social prominence in Washington pre- 
ferred "ripe" meat because it was more tender. 
Ripe Meat "Many savage people prefer putrid fish and 
meat, and the more rotten it is the greater their 
enjoyment in its consumption. In less degree the same is true 
of many of the most enlightened people who prefer game 
when decomposition is fairly well advanced." — Harrington and 
Richardson s Practical Hygiene, page 66. 

4. The diseases of animals: Some of the diseases which 
may affect animals are anthrax, black leg, pyemia, septicemia, 
rabies, tetanus, malignant epizootic, catarrh, hog cholera, 
actinomycosis, lymphadenitis, tuberculosis, pleurisy, pneu-

tape-worm, trichina, peritonitis, pericarditis, meningitis, en- 
teritis, gastritis, metritis, mammitis, polyarthritis, phlebitis, 
foot and mouth disease, abscess, tumors, nephritis. Even fowl 
are often contaminated with disease. 

It has been estimated that with tuberculosis alone the fol- 
lowing percentage of cows are affected: Great Britain, 30%; 
Belgium, 49%; Denmark, 33%; Mexico, 33%; United States, 

14% 

Post mortem condemnations for one year in U. S. were:

Note the fact that so large a number of carcasses are re- 
jected only in part, the remaining portion being used as fit 
for food. Of some five hundred livers in one lot 
A Tainted only forty were, according to the testimony of 
Food one inspector, considered good enough for ex- 

port. The rest were reserved for home con- 
sumption. Meat inspection is often very superficial, and many 
diseased conditions may escape the notice of even the ordi- 
narily careful inspector. 

Many Frankforters and Bolognas are said to consist largely 
of horse-meat, immature veal, and decrepit and sick cows, tu- 
berculous and otherwise. Prepared sausage casings contain 
about five grams (about a teaspoonful ) of excrement per 
metre. 

Thirty per cent of oysters five miles from sewer outlets 
contain the colon bacillus, a germ whose habitat is the human 
intestinal tract.

"'Not long ago the Metropolitan Sewage Commission of 
New York and the Merchants' Association made an exhaustive 
investigation of waters and oyster beds surrounding New York 
and reported the harbor to be one vast cesspool foul with dis- 
ease germs and undissolved sewage matter. Two million 
oysters are taken annually from these waters." — National Food 
Magazine. 

"The pernicious practice of fattening oysters on sewage has 
been the cause of untold deaths from typhoid fever in the 
past." — Roberts. 

It is a very common occurrence to find fish fresh from the 
market or fish wagon with worms crawling in great numbers 
out of their flesh. 

5. ./Esthetic reasons: On the question of suffering of ani- 
mals we need not dwell. No comment is needed. On the 
filth of slaughter houses one quotation will suffice. 

"At nearly all slaughter houses inspected, foul, nauseating 
odors filled the air for yards around. Swarms of flies filled 

the air and the buildings and covered the carcasses 
Slaughter which were hung up to cool. Beneath the houses 
Houses was to be found a thin mud, or a mixture of blood 

and earth, churned by hogs which are kept to 
feed upon the offal. Maggots frequently existed in numbers so 
great as to cause a visible movement in the mud. Water for 
washing the meat was frequently drawn from dug wells which 
received seepage of the slaughter house yards or the water was 
taken from the adjoining streams to which the hogs had ac- 
cess. Dilapidated buildings were the usual thing, and always 
the most repulsive surroundings and odors existed." — Slaugh- 
ter House Inspector of Indiana. Gov. Bulletin. 

Regarding influence on character and disposition we will 
quote the following: 



FLESH FOOD 95 

"More or less exclusive carnivorous alimentation is, to a 
greater extent even than race, one of the factors of the gentle 

or violent character of an individual. It is 
Character known that the white rats of our laboratories, as 
Gentle or long as they are fed on bread and grain, are 
Violent very manageable and easy to tame, whilst they 

become snappy and given to biting from the time 
they are fed on flesh. The same observations have been made 
in the case of a horse and even of a dog, although the latter is 
omnivorous. Liebig relates that a bear kept at the museum at 
Giessen was gentle and quiet when it was fed exclusively on 
bread and vegetables, but a few days of animal diet caused it 
to become fierce and dangerous to its keeper. They used to 
amuse themselves by periodically altering the animal's char- 
acter. It is known, adds Liebig, 'that the irascibility of pigs 
may be increased by a meat diet to such an extent as to cause 
them to attack men.' " — Gautiers "Diet and Dietetics," 
page 376. 

"It (the fleshless diet) is practical and rational. It should 
be accepted and commended by those who pursue the ideal of 

the formation and education of gentle, intelligent, 
The Ideal artistic and nevertheless prolific, vigorous and 

active races." — Id., p. 413. 

6. Economy: Meat furnishes protein and fat, practically 
no carbohydrate. Protein and fat can be obtained at a 
much less expense than is necessary in obtaining them 
from flesh. A dearth of grain and milk would be a much 
greater disaster than a shortage of meat. The grain fed to 
animals which are in turn slaughtered to furnish flesh food, 
would accomplish much more if given directly to the people 
for food. 

Much of the food value of the grain fed to animals is used

up by the animal in heat and energy production. It requires 
five or six pounds of grain to produce one pound of beef. Six 
pounds of grain represents about 10,000 
An Expensive calories in food value. One pound of beef 
Diet averages 1000 food units. Hence the extrava- 

gance of feeding so much of food grains to ani- 
mals, especially at a time when there is actual shortage of 
grain for human sustenance. Some one has aptly put it that 
"for every pound of steak we refrain from eating we release 
grain enough to furnish bread for a week for a soldier 'some- 
where in France.' " 

Dairy products are more vitally necessary for food than 
meat. A well nourished cow during a year will give in the 
form of milk as much protein, and two 
Meat or Milk — and a half times as many calories as are 
Which? contained in her own body. Let us seek 

then to save more of our cattle that we may 
have a necessary supply of milk even though the amount of 
flesh food be diminished. The question at the present time 
becomes one not only of keeping the cost of living within the 
limits of the financial possibilities of the average home, but 
also that of a patriotic duty in conserving the food supply of 
the nation and of the world. 

In conclusion the following quotations will leave no doubt 
in the minds of any as to the need for flesh food in the diet of 
man under present day conditions: — 

"Comparative experiments on seventeen vegetarians and 
twenty-five meat eaters in the laboratory of the University of 
Brussels, have shown little difference in strength 
Physical between the two classes, but a marked superiority 
Superiority of the vegetarians in point of endurance. The 
average superiority was 53%. The vegetarians 
recuperated from fatigue more quickly than the meat eaters." 
— Irving Fisher. 



FLESH FOOD 97 

''Fourteen meat eaters and eight vegetarians started out on a 
seventy-mile walking match. All the vegetarians reached the 
goal in splendid condition, the first covering the distance in 
fourteen and a quarter hours. An hour after the last vege- 
tarian came in the first meat eater came in, and he was com- 
pletely exhausted. He was also the last meat eater, for all the 
rest had dropped off after thirty miles of endeavor." — Id. 

Says Dr. Graham Lusk: "The popular idea of the neces- 
sity of meat for a laboring man may be epitomized in the 
statement: 'A strong man can eat more meat than a weak one, 
hence meat makes a man strong.' The proposition is evidently 
absurd." 

Thus does scientific investigation, together with the question 
of home and national economics, vindicate the principles of 
vegeterianism. While the majority may not want to take a 
radical stand on the side of strict vegetarianism, yet we believe 
that many when they look at the question squarely, will be led 
to put much less dependence upon flesh food as an article of 
diet. They will appreciate the fact that a fleshless diet may be 
more healthful and strength producing than the one on which 
mankind has for so long a time subsisted. 

To be a vegetarian one should be intelligent as to foods and 
their values, and should make a wise daily selection. This, 
however, is very possible, and with careful planning the house- 
wife may arrange her daily menus in such a way as to greatly 
raise the physical plane of the members of her household with- 
out the use of an article of food tainted with impurity. 



"Give me health and a day, and I will make the pomp 
of Emperors ridiculous." — Emerson. 



CHAPTER XL 

Condiments. 

A two-fold purpose is accomplished in eating: First — the 
supplying of a physiologic need; second — the enjoyment re- 
sulting from the partaking of pleasant food. 

Physiologic need being supplied, hunger disappears and ap- 
petite wanes, but humanity, so keen to surfeit itself with pleas- 
ure, has tended to tempt the fleeing appetite with foods so pre- 
pared that they may appeal to the palate even after the needs 
of the body are supplied. 

This having been for so long the tendency of mankind, we 
find ourselves caring most for those things artificially and ex- 
cessively seasoned, and so, often depend upon 
Tastebuds the seasoning rather than upon the natural flavor. 
In fact, few have tastebuds* so sensitive that 
they are able fully to appreciate the exquisite flavors of the 
foods so wonderfully supplied by nature. 

It has been said that given any article capable of disintegra- 
tion by the teeth, plus the various condiments and seasonings 
known to the modern chef, a dish fit for a king may be evolved. 
So with peppers and sauces, with frying and basting, our food 
is set before us in such a form that it is often impossible for 
us to tell of what we are eating. 

As "overflavoring leads to overeating," the custom of serving 
richly and highly seasoned food undoubtedly has much to do 
with the too prevalent dietetic sin of eating 
Eating for for drunkenness rather than strength. To re- 
Drunkenness educate our sense of taste that it might be nor- 
mally sensitive to nature's exquisite flavors 
would, if we could but realize it, give us the keener enjoy- 
ment and prevent the suffering of penalties for the breaking of 
natural law.

CONDIMENTS 99 

The mucous lining of the digestive tract has two very im- 
portant functions. First — to secrete the digestive fluids; sec- 
ond — to produce mucous which is a natural 
A Protection lubricant and protects the delicate membrane 
from the mechanical friction of food itself 
or from any other irritation which might enter it from 
the outside world. 

Condiments such as mustard, pepper, vinegar, etc., by 
reason of their irritating effect, produce a congestion of the 
mucous membranes with which they come in contact. This 
temporarily increases the flow of digestive juice, but analysis 
has shown that the character of this fluid is quite different 
from that produced as the result of the pres- 
Quantity Rather ence of food unassociated with condiments. 
Than Quality An analysis of the salivary secretions fol- 
lowing the introduction into the mouth of 
peppered food shows an increase in the quantity but a lowering 
of the quality. Though there is more saliva, it contains less 
ptyalin (the active digestive principle) and more mucous. 
Consequently it is weak in digestive power. 

Just so in the stomach and intestine; and as the result of 
repeated irritations of this kind, the little cells whose duty it is 
to secrete mucous, in their effort to protect against an ever 
increasing irritation, secrete more and more mucous and to a 
greater or less degree crowd out the cells that normally secrete 
digestive juices. The mucous glands increase in number and 
size, the digestive glands grow fewer, the mu- 
A Callous cous membrane thickens, becomes calloused as 
it were, until, as the months and years go by, 
catarrh of the stomach (or bowel) often results with a "corn" 
in the stomach instead of on the foot. The cause is the same: 
a long continued abnormal irritation and an effort on the part 
of the epithelial wall to protect itself — one is analogous to the 
other, but the first far more disastrous and as difficult to cure. 



100 THE HOME DIETITIAN 

But the deleterious effect of condiments does not stop here: 
The irritants are absorbed, enter the portal system, produce 
chronic congestion of the liver and, in their elimination through 
the kidneys, cause the same irritation in those organs with con- 
sequent thickening and scar tissue formation. Especially ob- 
jectionable are those articles hardened and preserved in brine 
and vinegar as pickles. As the vinegar preserves the cucum- 
ber so do these irritants toughen and pickle the tissues and in 
addition to the irritation of the condiment is added the indi- 
gestibility of the toughened article of food. 

Vinegar differs from lemon juice in that it is a free acid, 
being a solution of acetic acid. It is a decomposition product 
of alcohol, the result of two fermentative 
Vinegar versus processes, and because of its irritating 
Lemon Juice properties produces disease ; while lemon 

juice is not a free acid but an acid salt, not 
a decomposition product but is built up in nature's laboratory, 
is full of vitamines and is a cure for scurvy and many cases of 
malnutrition. 

Some one has well said that "mustard produces the same ef- 
fect on the inside as it does on the outside of the stomach." 

Says Gautier: "Pepper irritates the digestive tract and the 
urinary tract." 

Condiments create an inflammatory thirst which water can- 
not quench; alcohol is able to quench that thirst, and many a

people are generally prepared in a way to produce drunkards." 
— Ellen G. White. 

And a still greater "cloud of witnesses" might be raised up 
against these much used articles. But enough has been pre- 
sented to cause the thoughtful mother and house- 
Disease or wife to hesitate before serving to her family 
Health foods so seasoned that, even though the imme- 

diate effect may seem pleasing and satisfactory, 
a foundation for disease rather than for health is being laid, 
and, in some cases at least, a thirst created that may lead to 
a more grievous form of intemperance with its train of misery 
and woe. 

While catarrh of the stomach and bowels, hardening of the 
liver and Bright's disease, are not in every case caused by the 
use of condiments, nevertheless these things are factors in the 
production of these ever increasing diseases and shorten the 
working life of these organs. Again we would lay emphasis 
upon the fact that the reserve strength of a 
How Much healthy organ cannot be estimated. Just how 
Reserve? much wear and tear and overstrain it may be 
able to endure we can never know until it has 
been tried out, and then it is often too late; the damage is

may resist and override the few occasional mistakes, but a 
combination of factors, a continued irritation from various 
sources, is bound even in those most vigorous to bring all too 
soon the time of reckoning and the day when the strength of 
the organs no longer enables them to cope with

102 THE HOME DIETITIAN 

An important part of the treatment of the diseases mentioned 
in this connection is the elimination from the diet of all irri- 
tating and highly seasoned foods. How much better to avoid 
those things which tend to produce disease and to let our regu- 
lar dietary consist of the foods so bountifully supplied by 
Nature that will place upon our bodies no handicap in the 
processes of assimilation and elimination. 

There are many delicious flavors in natural foods; the de- 
lightful nectar of fruits, the rich flavor of nuts, the wholesome- 

ness of grains, the savor of vegetables and vege- 
Keen table broths; all of these were given us that 

Enjoyment we might derive the keenest enjoyment in the 

partaking of them. Careful and intelligent 
preparation will bring out delicacy of flavor that will prove 
delightful and more than satisfactory to all who will give the 
healthful way an unprejudiced trial.

CHAPTER XII. 

Unnatural Stimulants. 

These are any substances which excite cell or tissue to undue 
activity by reason of their irritating presence. Condiments 

then would be included under this head (see 
Abnormal previous chapter) , but as they have already been 
Excitation discussed, we will devote the contents of this 

chapter to those stimulants which affect the 
nervous system. These are substances which excite the brain 
and nerves to abnormal activity by reason of their irritating 
presence in the blood. This undue stimu- 
Compensatory lation is always followed by a compensatory 
Depression period of depression. This is more than a 

mere physiological sedation, for after re- 
peated stimulation of this sort it takes more of the stimulant 
to produce the same amount of activity until the nerves tend 
toward a wornout state or a condition of exhaustion. 

Exhausted nerves are always irritable, and as the end result 
of a continued abnormal stimulation the nerves become weak, 
unsteady and unable to do with poise and control the work of 
governing the muscular mechanism of the body. Under the 
head of such stimulants may be classed: Alcohol, tobacco, 
various drugs, many patent medicines, tea, coffee, cocoa, and 
meat juices. 

Alcohol, the great destroyer of the race, we need not discuss 
here. Tobacco, a menace to the physical and intellectual in- 
tegrity of mankind, is not included in the realm of dietetics. 
The promiscuous use of drugs and patent medicines the people 
are being, to an extent, saved from by educational campaigns 
and the law. But coming more strictly in the province of our 
discussion, and often apparently innocent in their effects, 

103 



104 THE HOME DIETITIAN 

are those in the remainder of the list — tea, coffee, cocoa, and 
meat juices. 

Tea: "That social cup which sharpens wit, brightens 
repartee, accelerates the flow of ideas, quickens the pulse, re- 
lieves one of headache and fatigue and drives away dull care 
is not the innocent benefactor of the race that it may seem to 
be. Instead it is a deceiver which, commending itself for the 
present as a thing 'to be desired to make one wise' and well, in 
the end robs us of a hundredfold more of the very things it 
seems to give." — Dr. D. D. Comstock in Signs of the Times, 
July, 1917. 

Tea contains two injurious extractives — a somewhat bitter 
alkaloidal poison called theine, and an astringent acid called 
tannin. A small cup of tea — four ounces — will 
Theine contain from y 2 to one grain of theine and a vari- 
able amount of tannic acid. The physiological 
effects of theine are principally those of stimulation. It is an 
excitant to the brain, quickens the pulse and raises blood pres- 
sure, apparently relieving fatigue. 

"Used in excess it (tea) exerts a harmful influence upon the 
nervous system, and in too strong a form injures the digestive 
tract and function." — Harrington and Richardson's Practical 
Hygiene, page 212. 

According to Bullard, "the abuse of tea as a beverage leads 
to ringing in the ears, tremor, nervousness, headache, neu- 
ralgia and constipation." 

Practically all medical authorities classify theine with the 
habit forming drugs, such as morphine, cocaine and alcohol. 
Who shall say then just what is excess or 
A Habit- abuse? Experiments of the Pasteur Insti- 

Forming Drug tute have shown that the long continued use 
of even very small doses of poison ulti- 
mately produces decided injury to the organism, and some 
observers say that a given amount of poison taken in small 



UNNATURAL STIMULANTS 105 

doses over a long period of time does more harm than if taken 
in large doses at infrequent intervals. Just as there is greater 
damage inflicted by alcohol on the "tippler" than on the man 
who goes on a "spree" occasionally, but abstains at other times. 

The astringent action of the tannic acid of tea in its effect 
on the bowel is no small factor in the causation of the preva- 
lent disease, constipation, and many a girl and young woman 
has laid the foundation for future ill health in her daily indul- 
gence in a cup of tea. 

"With nerves all a-quiver with theine, and the bowels all 
puckered with tannin, what an amazing preparation for the 

battles of life! It is but little short of a 
A Tragedy tragedy that a girl of a nervous and artistic 

temperament, with a natural tendency toward 
functional disease of the nervous system, should be encouraged 
or even allowed by her parents to begin so young to cultivate 
a disorder toward which she has a natural bent — nervous pros- 
tration and chronic constipation — through the free use of tea 
and other nerve stimulants and sedatives." — D. D. Comstock. 

Coffee: The stimulating principle of coffee is caffeine, which 
is practically the same as the theine of tea, and identical in its 

effects, and much that has been said of tea might 
Caffeine also be said of coffee. Caffeine is a drug that is 

commonly used in headache powders or is pre- 
scribed by physicians when an emergency stimulant is needed. 
Coffee contains about 2-grs. of caffeine to the cup and 
thus its effect upon the nervous system is even more marked 
than that of tea; and while tea, because of its astringent action, 
interferes with the normal peristalsis of the intestine, coffee 
interferes to a greater extent with stomach digestion. 



106 THE HOME DIETITIAN 

American people yearly consume about 15,000,000 pounds 
of caffeine, which if given at one time would kill the whole 
world at one dose. This if divided into doses 
15,000,000 would equal more than 100,000,000,000 doses 
Pounds annually or a little more than 3 grains daily for 
every man, woman and child in the nation. 
Surely this can not tend toward the physical uplift of the race, 
but must have its effect in the gradual increase of chronic 
disease. 

Quoting from Gautier: "Coffee, as everybody knows, pro- 
duces a nervous excitement, which if abused may lead to 
insomnia, halluciantions, troubles of the circulation, and mus- 
cular enervation, to pericordial distress and to dyspnoea. One 
can become caffeic, just as one can become alcoholic or a 
morphia maniac." 

And again from Harrington and Richardson's Practical Hy- 
giene, page 214: "Coffee taken in extreme quantities causes 
palpitation and intermission, besides general nervousness and 
derangement of digestion. It has a marked inhibitory influence 
on gastric digestion and is more oppressive to the stomach than 
tea, and hence should be used with caution by dyspeptics." 

The headache that one has when deprived of his morning 
coffee or his daily portion of tea is one of the greatest evidences 
that the nervous system has learned to depend 
For That upon the artificial stimulation and that, sooner 
Headache or later, if the habit is continued nature will 
reach the place where she can no longer cope 
with the situation and the collapse will come. 

"There can be no doubt but that the human race would be 
better off if these beverages had never been discovered, and 
many cases of nervousness, dyspepsia, and constipation would 
be either greatly helped or entirely relieved if these beverages 
were banished from our tables." — Sadler in Science of Liv- 
ing, p. 162. 



UNNATURAL STIMULANTS 107 

Cocoa: Many giving up tea and coffee feel that they can 
indulge themselves freely in cocoa, but here again a mistake 
is made; for even in the use of this delightful 
Theobromin beverage, care and moderation should be exer- 
cised. It contains the active principle theo- 
bromin which is related to caffeine, though not so deleterious 
in its effects, it not having the untoward effect on the cerebral 
centers and the heart that does the active principal of either 
coffee or tea. However, it is a drug, its drug action affecting 
principally the kidneys and urinary tract. A cup of cocoa 
contains about one-half as much of its active principle as does 
tea or coffee and the theobromin may be considered one-half 
as injurious in its effects as caffeine. 

Cocoa has an advantage over tea and coffee. Being rich in 
fat and protein, it has rather a high food value. Chocolate and 
cocoa are the same except that in cocoa the fat has been largely 
removed. This fat is placed on the market as cocoa butter. 

So while the same things cannot be said against cocoa as 
can be said against tea and coffee, and it may at times serve a 
useful purpose as food, yet it should be used only with care 
and moderation. Especially should children be kept from the 
use of cocoa, it being particularly deleterious to them because 
of its action on the urinary tract. 

Truly it is "the little foxes that spoil the vines" and our 

safety and greatest efficiency lie in a selection of food which 

will yield the highest results healthwise, and in the 

Little avoiding of those things which are questionable in 

Foxes their effects. 

Meat Extractives: The end products of protein 
metabolism already described are closely related to caffeine. 
For this reason the stimulating effect of meat or meat broths, 
which when taken add these extractives in excess to those 
already formed normally in the tissues, and the sensation of 



108 THE HOME DIETITIAN 

weakness when they are omitted from the dietary by one accus- 
tomed to having them. 

The feeling of strength obtained from meat broths is thus 

not a true tonic but an unnatural stimulant, which if freely 

indulged in cannot but have in the end a 

A Devitalizing devitalizing effect upon the general nervous 

Effect system. 

Eating for health means eliminating from 
one's diet those things which tend to make for disease and race 
decadence and in subsisting on those foods so abundant that 
are full of life and health properties. The more we are able 
to reach this ideal the nearer does the body approach the nor- 
mal state which means not only fulness of physical but of 
intellectual strength. 



'Blessed art thou, land, ivhen . . . thy princes eat 
in due season, for strength and not for drunkenness. 9 ' 



CHAPTER XIII. 
Meat Substitutes 
Upon meat and the savors derived from it has dependence 
always been placed to make food palatable and appetizing. 

With meats taken from us, free fats in disfavor, condiments 
disallowed, what can we do in the way of preparing dishes that 
will not only supply the body needs, but also 
A Problem meet the demands of often wrongly educated 
palates? Surely we would feel quite helpless 
and find the problem too great. However, a practical study 
may enable us to "find a way." 

In preparing meat substitutes we must think of (1) broths, 
(2) entrees, and (3) gravies. These foods must be appetizing, 
the broths with something of the same savory 
Three-fold appeal to the palate as have the meat juices; 
the entrees must supply the necessary amount of 
tissue building element, and the gravies, while palatable, must 
be free from excess of grease especially superheated fats. 

(I) Broths and Soups: Vegetables properly prepared yield 
the most delicious and appetizing flavors. In fact, vegetable 
bouillon may be so like the ordinary meat broth in its savor 
that many could scarcely be persuaded of the absence of all 
meat extract in its preparation. Moreover, such 
A Natural vegetable broths are rich in the mineral salts 
Tonic and vitamines so essential. For the invalid they 

will have all the advantages of an appetizer and 
tonic without the contamination of animal wastes and purin 
stimulation. 

The vegetables cut up without paring should be put to cook 
in cold water and allowed to simmer two or three hours. In 
this way the mineral matter, vitamines, and much of the pro- 
tein pass into the broth, the temperature not being high enough 
to destroy the vitamines. In boiling vigorously for more than 

109 



110 THE HOME DIETITIAN 

thirty minutes a greater risk is run of destroying the vital 
elements. 

The most important part of the nourishment being near the 
skin, a most delicious vegetable broth can be made by using 
simply the parings of potatoes and other vege- 
Soup Stock tables. These having been thoroughly cleansed, 
may be used to excellent advantage in the prep- 
aration of broths and soup stock. No fat should be added but, 
after straining or pressing through a colander, seasoning in the 
way of salt, celery salt, a bay leaf, or a pinch of thyme may 
be added. Any combination of vegetables may be used with 
good results. (See recipes for soups, Chap. XXII.) Vegex 
is a factory prepared vegetable extract which makes, when 
added to boiling water, a very nice bouillon comparable to that 
prepared from bouillon cubes. (See recipe 34, Chap. XXII.) 

(2) Entrees: The essential for these dishes as meat substi- 
tutes is first, and most important, that they contain a relatively 
high proportion of protein. In this way only can 
The they replace flesh food, which usually contains 

Essential 30% or more of the nitrogenous element. Often 
dishes are served as meat substitutes which con- 
tain a very small percentage of protein, and are in reality 
starchy rather than nitrogenous foods. Something more than 
the taste must be considered if we are rightly to supply the 
body demand. However, the flavor cannot be ignored and 
the dish to be a success must satisfy the palate as well. For 
foods that, because of their large protein content, are good meat 
substitutes, see table, Chapter VI. 

For at least two of the daily meals, a protein dish should be 
planned. For breakfast it may be an egg, cottage cheese, 
cottage cheese omelet, milk toast, gluten mush or 
Breakfast gruel, or any of the whole grains, as oatmeal, 
whole or cracked wheat, whole rice, pearled bar- 
ley. These grains contain in themselves 15% or more protein. 



MEAT SUBSTITUTES 111 

When eaten with milk the percentage of protein may reach 
18%. The addition of sugar is a mistake for two reasons: first 
because sugar and milk is not a good combination (see Chap- 
ter XVI 1) and second, because the extra food units of sugar 
greatly disturb the protein balance. Cream may be used if 
other fats in the meal are limited, but as a protein dish the 
cereal has its greatest advantage when eaten with whole milk. 
Fruit juices may be combined with the grain if desired, but 
care must be taken that sufficient protein in some form be sup- 
plied. Nuts are a good addition to a breakfast menu, but sup- 
ply fat rather than an excess of protein. The peanut and 
almond are higher in protein than other nuts.

In some cases where the no breakfast plan is followed, or 
where the morning meal is made up largely of fruit or other 
low protein foods, the other two meals of the day must be 
planned so as to furnish ample tissue building material. 

When possible it is better for dinner to be served in the 
middle of the day. In planning the menu it is well to decide 
first upon the form in which the protein is to be 
Dinner supplied, then to select the other foods accordingly. 
If legumes, such as peas, beans, or lentils are to 
be served, or cottage cheese either as a salad or a meat dish, it 
may not be necessary to plan a special meat substitute. How- 
ever, it is often very pleasing to serve a dish which will seem 
more nearly to take the place of meat, such as recipes 36 to 47, 
Chapter XXII. These may be served with sauces or gravies 
which may add greatly to the meaty flavor.

116 THE HOME DIETITIAN 

Note the high total; the fat nearly two times the normal 
amount (See Chap. VII) ; the protein less than the lower nor- 
mal limit. 

The only person handling well the total amount of food 
would be a man in active labor, as a farmer. For him the 
protein would be 50 to 100 calories too low. Having a total of 
3041 calories, his protein might be sufficient at 9% or 10%, but 
in this ration he has only 6% protein. 

Two other meals having been served, it is often better for the 
evening meal to consist largely of fruit with a dextrinized 
cereal or some other easily digested food. This, 
Evening of course, depends entirely upon the needs of the 
Meal individual and what portion of the necessary daily 

ration has already been taken. If the protein 
ration is still low, there must be added to the evening meal 
some food which will supply the lack. This may well be in 
the form of buttermilk, cottage cheese, a cereal gruel or an 
egg. Brain workers and those fatigued from the work of the 
day would find it a great advantage to take their food at this 
time in as digestible a form as possible. 

Often, however, the evening meal must be the heavy meal of 
the day. In these cases the lunch at mid-day should be light 
but nourishing and the evening dinner, while supplying the 
necessary food elements, should be served in not too great a 
variety, properly prepared and eaten with care as to mastica- 
tion. The fact that more time can be taken for the meal in 
the evening is an advantage over the haste with which a noon- 
day meal is often eaten, this offsetting to a great extent the 
disadvantage of eating heartily in the evening. Dinner menus 
numbers 3 and 4 are simple in variety and may well be taken 
in the evening. In many cases it is better not to serve potatoes 
regularly for evening dinner. They may be served for break- 
fast instead, and as baked potatoes make a most satisfactory 
addition to the morning meal. 



MEAT SUBSTITUTES 117 

No. 3. Gravies: Many would be quite willing to eliminate 
flesh food from their diet were it still possible to have the rich, 
savory gravies usually served with meat. These much to be 
desired sauces may readily be made from vegetable broths and 
extracts and eaten with the added satisfaction of the thought 
that they are not only appetizing but health giving. 

Many gravies made by vegetarians are anything but hy- 
gienic because of their excess of grease and superheated fat. 

These may make a meal more unhealthful than 
Unhygienic one in which meat is served. 
Gravies A very enjoyable and healthful dressing for 

vegetables and entrees may be prepared by 
using a vegetable broth as a basis. Instead of browning flour 
in butter or oil, it can be browned in the oven or in a dry pan 
over the flame and this used to thicken the gravy. The addi- 
tion of caramel cereal coffee, or carmelized sugar, will serve to 
give an added richness in color. (See recipe 56, Chap. XXII.) 



"Experiments have shown that physical endurance can be 
doubled by dietetic causes alone." 

"Observation shows that many, possibly most, of the ivorld's 
most vital men and women have virtually made over their con- 
stitutions from iveakness to strength" — Irving Fisher. 



CHAPTER XIV. 

Vegetables 

No other food is so universally used by all classes as the 
vegetable. No daily ration seems complete without it, no mat- 
ter how elaborate the other foods may be. None 
A Universal live so largely on a meat diet that they do not 
Food feel the need of the accompanying vegetable to 

make their meal satisfactory. And to those 
who have adopted a fleshless diet it becomes, more than ever, 
an important part of their dietary and greater dependence is 
placed upon it in the making up of the daily ration. Greater 
thought and care must then be accorded its preparation and 
more attention paid to the part it plays in each meal. 

Vegetables are valuable because of their cellulose which, as 
before stated, serves as necessary bulk; because of their rich- 
ness in the mineral salts so essential to the blood and 
Their tissues ; because of the great amount of vitamines they 
Value supply, without which the organic processes could 
not be carried on; and because of actual caloric 
food value, this last much more abundant in some vegetables 
than others. The leaf vegetables are of special value because 
of their complete proteins and growth producing vitamines. 
See chapters VI and IX. 

Botanically vegetables may be classified as follows: 

1. Roots— as carrots, turnips, beets, parsnips. 

2. Tubers — potatoes, onions, etc. 

3. Leaves — lettuce, cabbage, cauliflower, asparagus, spin- 
ach, greens. 

*4. Seeds or Legumes — peas, beans, lentils, peanuts, soy 
beans. 



*In this class may. also be placed the grains. 

118 



VEGETABLES 119 

The bulk of most vegetables is cellulose; exceptions being 
the potato, sweet potato, the winter squash and the legumes. 
The cellulose of some vegetables is tougher and more indi- 
gestible than that of others; for instance, that of the cabbage, 
the parsnip, corn, and vegetable oyster. The cellulose of vege- 
tables is often more digestible raw than cooked, as for example 
cabbage which can be eaten raw by many who find it im- 
possible to take it cooked. 

The potato, though poor in cellulose, is especially rich in 
alkaline salts and for this reason is useful in conditions where 
it is desirable to render the blood alkaline. This, 
The Value no doubt, is the reason why the combination of 
Of Potato "meat and potatoes" has always been so satisfac- 
tory; the acid ash of meat metabolism being 
neutralized to an extent by the alkalinity of the potato. 

All vegetables are rich in salts; green vegetables are par- 
ticularly valuable for the iron salts they contain, thus being 

very helpful in cases of anemia. The iron obtained 
An Iron in this way is appropriated by the body to a much 
Tonic greater degree than that taken as "iron tonic" out 

of a bottle. The green coloring matter of plants is 
known as chlorophyll. Chlorophyll is the respiratory and 
starch making portion of the plant and is essential not only to 
plant life but to animal life as well. 

Haemoglobin, the red coloring matter of the blood, is anal- 
ogous to the chlorophyll of the plant, and just as chlorophyll 
is necessary for plant life so is haemoglobin necessary for 
animal life. Green vegetables contain substances closely re- 
lated to the red of the blood and the quality of the haemo- 
globin of the blood with its iron content may be altered mate- 
rially by a deficiency or an abundance of these important 
and vitalizing foods. 



120 THE HOME DIETITIAN 

Vitamines are present in these green vegetables in large 
amounts, thus making them invaluable as an article of diet 
both for the invalid and for the person in nor- 
Fat-Soluble mal health, for the child as well as for the 
Vitamine adult. For the child they are especially valu- 

able because of the "fat-soluble" vitamine con- 
tained in them, which has to do with normal growth and de- 
velopment. (See chapters VII and IX.) 

Green vegetables contain much water, as high as from 80% 
to 92%. For this reason an animal feeding largely upon 
leaves and green vegetables drinks much less 
Hot Weather water than one subsisting upon a diet of grain. 
Food For this same reason green vegetables are es- 

pecially good as "hot weather food." How- 
ever, they should be obtained as freely as possible at all times 
of the year. 

In cities and countries where green vegetables can not be 
obtained during the winter months people often suffer the 
results of a vitamineless diet. Dr. Evans, a noted 
Spring health writer, says that one-half of the people in the 
Fever cities have a touch of scurvy every winter. This 
may account for the epidemics of spring fever so 
prevalent as winter ends, and the use of liver pills and blood 
purifiers at this time of the year. All vegetables, however, con- 
tain vitamines and when green vegetables can not be obtained 
and fruits are expensive, the proper preparation of winter 
vegetables may supply necessary vitamines. 

The question of the preparation of vegetables is a most 
important one. Uncooked vegetables contain the highest per- 
centage of vitamines and such vegetables as carrots, turnips, 
cabbage, as well as lettuce, water cress, tomatoes and celery, 
etc., may be eaten raw with great advantage, care being taken 
to insure thorough mastication. These prepared in the form 
of salads may be served in a most attractive way. (See recipes, 



VEGETABLES 121 

Chapter XXII.) In this way they may to a great extent take 
the place of fruit. 

The process of cooking unfortunately often greatly lessens 
the nutritive value of vegetables. It is possible, however, to so 
prepare and cook them that they will not lose their nutritive 
and vital elements, and it is very important that this be ac- 
complished. 

The ordinary method of vegetable preparation includes the 
removing of the skins and those parts containing the tough, 
more fibrous portions of cellulose such as celery 
A Waste tops, asparagus butts, peapods, etc. These parts, 
however, contain many of the valuable salts and 
vitamines and often a comparatively large amount of protein. 
For example, the greater part of the protein nourishment lies 
with the salts and vitamines just underneath the skins of such 
vegetables as the potato, the carrot, etc., and so is lost when 
these are thrown away. Carrot tops are said to be particularly 
rich in calcium or lime salts. 

When vegetables are boiled a considerable portion of the 
remaining nitrogenous elements and vitamines passes into the 
broth and not infrequently is thrown down the sink, instead of 
being used where it is so often sorely needed in the supplying 
of body needs. When potatoes are peeled, allowed to stand 
in cold water and then boiled, they lose about 50% of their 
protein and 40% of the mineral matter and vitamines. As 
usually prepared and cooked, carrots lose 40% of their protein 
food value and 25% of their sugar. The cooking of other 
vegetables results in about the same loss. In this way much 
of the delightful flavor is lost, and the vegetables lose to a 
great extent their satisfying palatability. 

These losses may be prevented in a number of ways. Vege- 
tables may be cooked without paring. They may be baked, 
boiled or steamed, the skins being removed just before serving, 
or eaten, as in the case of baked potatoes. In boiling, the water 



122 THE HOME DIETITIAN 

should never be thrown away, but should be saved as a basis 
for soups and gravies. As a variation, and for those members 
of the family not able to handle cellulose well, the vitamines 
may be secured and served in the form of these delicious 
vegetable broths and purees. 

The vegetables having been thoroughly cleansed with a 
brush may be cut up and cooked without paring, or the parings 
may be cooked by themselves (see recipe 23, 
An Economy Chapter XXII), and in this way the nutritive 
elements extracted. This being a process of 
extraction instead of retention the cooking should be more pro- 
longed than otherwise and at a lower temperature, as e. g. sim- 
mer, which takes place at about 190° F instead of 212 ° F, the 
ordinary boiling point. At this lower temperature a somewhat 
prolonged cooking of one to one and a half or even two hours 
does not destroy the vitamines but quite thoroughly extracts the 
food elements from the vegetable. Pressing through a colander 
or sieve will separate the skins and cellulose and leave prac- 
tically all nutritional elements in the broth or puree. The ele- 
ments thus extracted contain the meaty savor which is an appe- 
tizer and tonic. 

Delicious soups may be made in this way, and from the 
standpoint of economy they are well worth while, as parts are 
used that ordinarily find their way to the garbage can. Out- 
side lettuce leaves, celery tops, the tougher portions of aspara- 
gus, and even peapods may be boiled and from these portions 
will thus be obtained food elements that will 
Vegetables as greatly increase the total value of the vege- 
Protein Food table. (See recipes, Chapter XXII.) Pre- 
pared in this economical way the vegetables 
no longer remain simply carbohydrate food, but may be made 
to supply to the body a comparatively large portion of nitro- 
genous material. It is interesting to note that, while the total 
food content of vegetable is often low, that of this low total, a 



VEGETABLES 123 

high proportion may be protein, in the case of the leaf vege- 
table ranging from 25 to 50%. How important that none of 
this be lost! 

In cooking vegetables care should be taken that they are 
cooked until tender, but that they are not over-cooked or al- 
lowed to become water soaked. Unless a broth is 
Do Not desired, only enough water should be added to 
Overcook properly moisten the vegetable so that when cook- 
ing is complete there will be no excess to throw 
away. Cooking is often prolonged much beyond the necessary 
time and this at a high temperature which devitalizes the food 
and in no way increases its tenderness or desirability. The 
prolonged subjection to heat may even toughen it, as in the 
case of peas. Vigorous boiling longer than thirty minutes is 
said to destroy vitamines. Spinach is often cooked one to one 
and a half hours, when cooking from 20 to 30 minutes is usu- 
ally quite sufficient leaving the vegetable much more desirable 
as a food, rich in vitamines and iron salts. (See recipe 51, 
Chapter XXII.) 

The actual energy value of vegetables varies within rather 
wide limits from the cabbage containing 2 to 5 calories to 
the ounce to the bean furnishing a food supply of 65 calories 
to the ounce.* Vegetables should be considered real food rather 
than merely a relish, and they may assume a place in the role 
of nutrition that they have never had when housewives learn 
to prepare them in such a way as to retain all their food 
elements. 



*"We may safely compare the cost of the cereal grains or the le- 
gumes with each other, or with the tubers such as the potato, or the 
sweet potato, or with the root foods. It is not possible to compare the 
cost of any of these with milk or the leafy vegetables such as cabbage, 
cauliflower, Swiss chard, collards, Brussels sprouts, onions, lettuce, cel- 
ery tops, spinach, turnip tops and other vegetables employed as greens. 
Milk and the leafy vegetables are to be regarded as protective foods. 
The leaves should not be regarded as foods of low value 
because their content of protein, fat and carbohydrate is low, and 
the content of water high. . . . But they have a peculiar value 
. which makes them stand in a class by themselves among the 
vegetable foodstuffs." — McCollum. 



CHAPTER XV. 
Breads and Cereals. 
Bread is the staff of life and without the homely loaf we 
would often feel unsatisfied even though surrounded by the 
most tasty viands. Someone has well said that 
The Staff "there is true religion in a loaf of good bread." 
Of Life Today when the cost of living is high, the 

quality of our bread becomes a question of the 
greatest importance, and when we are confronted with the 
fact that the refined flour of today has been robbed of life 
giving properties by the removal of the outer layer of the grain, 
it behooves us to cultivate a taste for real graham bread and 
demand whole flour instead of that which has been devitalized. 
(See Chapter IX.) 

Whether bread is made from wheat, rye, or corn, flour con- 
taining the whole grain should be obtained whenever possible. 
In this way not only are the valuable vitamines 
The Whole and mineral salts saved to the body, but the 
Grain extra bulk is a great help in the prevention and 

treatment of constipation. One of the most 
generally recognized foods indicated in constipation is bread 
containing an excess of bran. However, the addition of steril- 
ized bran to bread made from devitalized flour, while of some 
benefit, can not take the place of bread containing both the 
coarse outer covering and the vitamines which would be found 
in graham bread made from real graham flour. 

Genuine whole wheat or graham flour is difficult to obtain, 
but its value as a food is worthy of a determined effort to 
obtain it and to eat it every day as bread, raisin bread, nut 
bread, or gems. The flour sold as whole wheat is usually a 
combination of a few of the several low grades of flour, mid- 
dlings, and bran produced by the roller processes, and so does 
not contain vitamines.

BREADS AND CEREALS 125 

After being ground the outer layer containing the germ will 
not keep more than a few weeks and so can not be stored 
indefinitely. For this reason the manufacturers will not keep 
it on hand until the demand for it is greater than it has been. 
But the occasional small miller can often be found who will 
grind the whole wheat berry, as it is called for, or the wheat 
can be ground at home in a small mill or even in a coffee mill. 

Several families may club together and buy a mill in which 
a supply of whole wheat flour may be ground for them all. 
This has been done by many with satisfac- 
Home tory results. We are too often prone to do 

Ground Wheat the easy thing, but a sense of the importance 
of having the best, most wholesome bread 
will result in a determined effort to obtain it, and "where there 
is a will there is a way." 

A mill can be bought at a small cost that will turn out 15 lbs. 
of whole wheat flour per hour. Larger and more expensive 
mills may be purchased that will grind as high as 50 lbs. per 
hour. With wheat at $2.25 a bushel it is worth 3%c per lb. 
Labor time not counted, home grinding then saves per pound 
the difference between 3%c and the 6c or 7c at which graham 
or whole wheat flour is marketed. At the same time the family 
is supplied with a fresh, whole grain containing its food ele- 
ments entire. One who has suitable storage room may buy 
grain by the bushel and grind it as it is needed. It should, of 
coarse, be protected from dampness and mice. This home 
ground wheat may be coarsely ground and used as breakfast 
cereal, or in a more finely divided state it may be used in 
bread making. The wheat should first be washed until the 
water is clear and spread on a cloth to be dried before grind- 
ing. (See recipe 10, Chapter XXII.) This mill may be used 
in grinding other grains as corn, rye, buckwheat, rice, or in 
making peanut butter, and grinding dried fruits, etc. 



126 THE HOME DIETITIAN 

Given bread made from flour which is of the right quality, it 
should be prepared in a way that will permit of easy digestion. 
Bread raised with yeast, most commonly used and undoubtedly 
the best, should, of course, be light and sweet, but aside from 
these qualities there is another qualification to which we pay 
little attention, and that is the process through which bread 
passes after it is baked. Fresh bread is difficult 
Fresh Bread of digestion, and this difficulty is enhanced by 
the common addition to it of large amounts of 
butter. Being soft it is not thoroughly masticated and it is 
often swallowed in masses which become soggy in the stomach. 
The gastric juice is unable to mix thoroughly with it, digestion 
is delayed and fermentation results. On the other hand, if 
bread is allowed to stand for twenty-four hours or more, im- 
portant changes take place which eliminate its indigestible 
qualities. It becomes drier, separates into small particles more 
readily, and certain chemical changes actually occur in the 
protein as the bread becomes stale that greatly increase its 
digestibility. 

These conditions are enhanced when bread is twice baked, 
as in oven toast, and for one with a weak di- 
Oven Toast gestion there is no bread so well received by 
Or Zweiback the stomach. The starch is partly digested by 
the extreme heat and we speak of it as being 
"dextrinized." Its brittleness allows of easy solution by the 
digestive fluids. 

Toast, as often made, is not better than fresh bread. A 
slice of bread is taken and browned superficially leaving the 
center soft and often more like fresh bread than 
The Wrong if it had not been toasted. This is then covered 
Way with butter and reheated, making a combina- 

tion in the "hot buttered toast" as ordinarily 
served that can hardly be called hygienic, even though com- 
monly considered under the head of invalid dietary. The 



BREADS AND CEREALS 127 

thorough mastication of hard breads would tend to prevent 
much of the premature decay of teeth so prevalent among the 
American people. Here as elsewhere are often seen the results 
of lack of exercise, and the teeth tend, because of disuse, to fall 
into degeneration and premature decay. 

Baking powder and soda breads are not the best for sev- 
eral reasons: 

1. They are made usually of refined, devital- 
Devitalized ized flour. 

Bread 2. They are served hot, and eaten with an 

excess of butter. 

3. Soda and baking powder destroy the vitamines, so even 
though whole grain were used, the addition of these powders 
would tend to devitalize the grain, with a resulting vitamine- 
less bread. 

4. Baking powders, even though the best, leave in the bread 
a chemical residue, the continuous ingestion of which is not 
conducive to health. 

In a baking powder two substances are combined, one alka- 
line the other acid in character. The alkaline substance is 
soda, the acid may be cream of tartar, acid phosphate or an 
acid salt of alum. The chemical reaction between the acid and 
the alkali results in the formation of carbonic acid gas (C0 2 ) 
and a salt. The gas passes off and makes the bread light, the 
salt is left behind as a residue in the bread. In the alum bak- 
ing powders the residue is particularly unhealthful. 

Analysis has shown that a cream of tartar baking powder 
leaves about 70% of its own weight in Rochelle salts as a resi- 
due and that the acid phosphate leaves about 35% of its own 
weight in sodium phosphate. These salts are all saline cathar- 
tics. Rochelle salts is the basic element of a Seidlitz powder. 
From the U. S. Department of Agriculture in Bulletin No. 13 
we receive the information that "a loaf of bread made from 

9 



128 THE HOME DIETITIAN 

a quart of flour leavened with cream of tartar baking powder 
contains forty-five grains more of Rochelle salts than is con- 
tained in one Seidlitz powder." Also in a report on baking 
powders by the Referee Board of Consulting Scientific Experts, 
appointed by the United States Department of Agriculture, that 
"it is wise to be moderate in the use of foods that are leavened 
with baking powders." Dr. A. Warner Shepard, formerly 
Health Officer in Brooklyn, said: "I have not the slightest 
doubt that the mental and physical health of thousands is per- 
manently injured by the excessive use of Rochelle salts in 
bread and other forms of food and drink. It irritates the kid- 
neys, bowels and stomach and may therefore produce most un- 
fortunate results. 

5. Soda, if used at all, should be used with an acid in exact 
proportions, so that there may be no excess of alkali. The 
most accurate way to use it is with hydrochloric 
How to acid in the proportion of one exactly level tea- 
Use Soda spoon of soda to 80 minims of hydrochloric acid. 
In this way the following chemical reaction takes 
place: HCL (hydrochloric acid) -f- NaHC0 3 (soda) = NaCL 
(salt) -j- H 2 (water) -f- C0 2 (carbonic acid gas). The end 
products are simply common salt, water and carbonic gas or 
carbon dioxid. This measurement, however, must be exact. 
Only the careful housewife should use this combination. 

We quote from "The New Cookery" by Lenna Frances 
Cooper: "It is advisable when using hydrochloric acid to 
have a minim glass, which can be purchased for a small sum at 
any drug store. One perfectly level teaspoonful of soda is 
neutralized by 80 minims of hydrochloric acid. The hydro- 
chloric acid must be chemically pure (marked C. P.) and in 
the concentrated form. One teaspoon of soda and 80 minims 
of hydrochloric acid are equivalent to four level teaspoons of 
baking powder . . . for most recipes % teaspoon of soda 
and 40 minims of hydrochloric acid are sufficient to use with 



BREADS AND CEREALS 129 

one cup of flour." (For warm breads without baking powder 
see recipes, Chapter XXII.) 

Very satisfactory breakfast gems may be made without the 
use of baking powder or soda. These are best made with 
whole wheat or graham flour and are light and easy of diges- 
tion (See recipes 1 and 2). 

Cereals are very useful foods, and it is most important that 
their comparative values be understood by the housewife. The 

greater part of the protein of all cereals is 
Cereals as found in the pericarp and just beneath it, so 

Protein Foods any whole cereal is comparatively rich in 

protein. Even rice ceases to be merely a 
starchy food when not deprived of its outer covering. The 
tables in Chapter VI give the approximate protein value of 
these foods. Whole or cracked wheat, oat meal, and whole 
rice contain 13 to 18% of protein and so are of great help in 
the making up of the necessary daily ration of nitrogenous 
food. The proteins of cereals often being incomplete need to 
be supplemented by those of other foods, as milk, eggs and 
vegetables. This is due in part to the fact that much of the 
cereal eaten has been deprived of important proteins in the 
outer covering. However, a monotonous diet largely of cereals 
or of a single cereal should be avoided. (See Chapter VI.) 

Cereals should be thoroughly cooked; the cooking preferably 
prolonged at a low temperature as in a double boiler or fireless 

cooker. The length of time required varies, but 
To Cook is usually two and one-half to six hours. This 
Cereals softens the outer covering and prepares the grain 

for easy and complete digestion. Cooked at the 
simmering point, the temperature is not high enough to de- 
stroy the vitamines. For invalids or for small children it 
may be necessary to serve cereals without the rough elements, 
but the prolonged cooking has put into solution most of the 



130 THE HOME DIETITIAN 

salts and vitamines of the outer layer and they are not lost to 
a great extent when only the harsh exterior is strained away. 
Gruels, while usually considered invalid dishes, make a nice 
variation from the ordinary breakfast mush and may be served 
for a change to the entire family for breakfast or as an evening 
lunch. (See recipes 19 to 21, Chapter XXII.)

CHAPTER XVI. 

Desserts. 

This most pleasing part of our meal comes to us, usually, 
when hunger is satisfied and the needs of the body have been 
supplied by that part which has gone before. 
Insult Added Thus the digestive powers are overtaxed, the 
To Injury body is burdened by an excess of food, and 

actual harm is often done, even though the dish 
might of itself be wholesome. However, desserts are frequently 
not wholesome and then the food which is imposed upon an 
already more than satisfied stomach is of such a quality that 
insult is added to injury. 

The so-called best chef is the one who can make a dessert so 
tempting that it will appeal to the palate of one who is already 
surfeited with food, and again we are reminded of the fre- 
quency with which the question of supplying physiological need 
is lost sight of in the desire to cater to the sense appeal. When 
one is truly hungry it is not the dessert that satisfies, but the 
homelier part of the meal, and the tendency is to wait until the 
appetite wanes before partaking of that which is often of the 
most concentrated food value. 

The best desserts are light, easily digested, and of a minimum 
caloric value. They must not be of such concentration that 
they interfere with the proper food balance. If the first part 
of the meal is low in calories and it is planned that the dessert 
supply a large part of the food value, making with the re- 
mainder of the food served a proper balance, a more concen- 
trated dessert may be served, e. g. the following: 

Protein Calories. Total Calories. 

Cottage Cheese 2 oz 40 75 

Spinach 2 heaping tbsp 8 25 

Apple Pie 1-6 of a pie 16 325 

Walnuts (6) 20 200 

Glass Milk 28 150 

Per cent of protein for the meal 14. 



132 THE HOME DIETITIAN 

Note the ample total food units, and the protein — half the 
daily needs, in spite of the fact that the pie contains only 

414% protein. The low protein of the pie is 
The Proper made up by the high protein content of the 
Food-Balance other food. While the pie may not be con- 
Maintained sidered the most wholesome of desserts and 

better to be served only occasionally, yet 
much of its unhealthfulness is avoided when it is given its 
rightful place in the meal. The pie and nuts, making a dessert 
of 550 calories, would undoubtedly be a great imposition upon 
a digestive tract after the ordinary dinner of three or four 
courses. This would in reality be serving a second full meal 
when the digestive organs already have all they can do. 

Usually the dessert of 150 food units or less is the best, and 
many very delightful dishes of this kind can be prepared. 
(See recipes, Chapter XXII.) 

One great disadvantage in desserts is the large amount of 
fat and sugar of which they are usually made. If care is not 

taken this will result in a meal overbal- 
A Disadvantage anced as regards its carbohydrate and fat 

content, at the same time irritating because 
of its concentrated sweet and overheated fat, and more or less 
indigestible especially if added to an already overloaded 
stomach. 

Desserts should be made of food substances in proper com- 
bination. For instance, combinations of milk and sugar are 

not the most wholesome and greatly increase a 
How to tendency to gastric fermentation. (See recipes, 
Combine Chapter XXII, for desserts without the milk and 

sugar combination.) The combination of fruits 
and vegetables is not considered ideal, and if a fruit dessert is 
served after a hearty vegetable meal, is should preferably be 
one in which the cellulose of the fruit has been largely removed. 



DESSERTS . 133 

The time for candy is at the end of the meal at which time it 
may be served with the dessert. Taking its proper place as a 
part of the meal, its food value being reckoned with 
Candy the daily ration, one great objection to its use is 
removed. The appetite already satisfied, the ten- 
dency to overeat of it is greatly lessened and it does not prove 
so irritating to the mucous membrane when not taken on an 
empty stomach. However, candy eaten in excess even at this 
time often results in marked irritation of the throat and in- 
creased catarrhal conditions. 

Nuts are some times served with the dessert, and much blame 
is often attached to this most valuable article of food because it 
so often plays a part in the overeating frequently in- 
Nuts dulged in during this last most delightful course. The 
high caloric value of nuts must be kept in mind and 
they should be eaten accordingly. Nuts served with a simple 
fruit dessert make a most satisfactory combination in which the 
food concentration need not be too great. Nuts often cause dis- 
tress because they are improperly masticated. If thoroughly 
chewed and eaten moderately, as all concentrated foods should 
be; if eaten at the proper time and place and considered a food 
with actual food value instead of something merely to please the 
palate, this pleasing as well as nourishing food may be eaten 
by nearly everyone with no unsatisfactory results. 

Ice cream, so often served, should be mentioned, and 
the same rules apply to this as to all others. It must be 
eaten with due regard for what has preceded it. 
Ice Cream Because of its combination of milk and sugar it 
can not be considered as wholly without objec- 
tion, but if eaten in moderation and slowly so that large ice 
cold masses are not thrown upon the stomach at once, thus too 
quickly lowering the temperature below that at which digestion 
can be carried on, it need not be condemned. As a dessert it 
is much to be preferred to the rich puddings and pastries so 



134 THE HOME DIETITIAN 

often served. A good time for ice cream is at lunch when little 
else is taken. A plain cracker eaten with ice cream makes a 
more rational combination than the conventional cake. Some- 
times an invalid can take ice cream better than anything else. 
At these times it is usually served by itself and supplies needed 
nourishment. Melted before it reaches the stomach, it is little 
more than a liquid and is usually well taken care of. 

Rich cakes and pastries are better omitted. Simple cakes 
made preferably without baking powder (see recipe 87) 

may be served occasionally, but the fewer of these 
Cakes sweets supplied the family table as a usual thing, the 

better. And when for economy's sake, or lack of 
time, the dessert is forgotten or omitted, none need feel that 
the body will suffer because of the omission. 



"Many things sweet to taste, prove in digestion sour" 

— Shakespeare. 



CHAPTER XVII. 

Combinations. 

The question of proper and hygienic combinations of food 
is one which greatly exercises the mind of many who find it 
necessary to consider their diet from a health standpoint. Yet 
we believe that those who have carefully followed us in our 

discussion of the previous chapters can readily see 
The that when the daily ration is properly balanced, and 

Solution one is careful not to overeat, the problem of 

food combination is to a great extent solved. And 
again we are reminded of the beauty and freedom of eating, as 
well as living, by principle rather than merely by rule. How- 
ever, there are a few points in this connection which perhaps 
should be spoken of in addition to those already discussed. 

First, and perhaps most important of all, is this: the menu 
having been properly balanced it is much better to serve a 

small variety at one meal. A large variety often 
Small complicates the digestive processes and tends to 

Variety overeating. Different kinds of digestive juices are 

called forth by different foods. If the variety is 
too great the stomach may find it difficult or impossible to 
manufacture so many kinds of gastric juice at the same time 
and thus the digestive process be hindered. 

Often when some particular food disagrees, it can be eaten 
and properly digested if taken unmixed with other foods. 
This is sometimes true in cases where fruit is not well 
taken. Although fruit should form a part of the dietary of 
everyone, yet there are those who seem unable to take it in any 
form, particularly if raw, or very acid. In nearly every case 
if these persons would devote one meal to the eating of fruit 
and nothing else, they would find themselves able to eat it 
without trouble, and they would often soon find it possible to 

135 



136 THE HOME DIETITIAN 

add one other simple food to the fruit meal, such as oven toast 
or cereal in some form. 

The combination of fruit and vegetable is not an ideal one. 
Fruit being a predigested food, should pass from the stomach 

very soon after entering it. Vegetables often 
Fruit and require rather a prolonged stomach digestion be- 
Vegetable cause of the protein which they contain. The 

fruit cellulose in addition to that contained in 
the vegetable may greatly retard and even prevent the digestion 
of the vegetable protein. This objection is to a great extent 
removed if the fruit is served in the form of a puree, the cellu- 
lose removed as in prune or apple whip, fruit mold, etc., or if 
the vegetables are tender, free from fibrous cellulose and easy 
of digestion. There is ordinarily no objection to fruit juices 
taken at meals where vegetables are served. 

Much has been said in regard to the combination of starches 
and acids, the reason being given that the ptyalin of the saliva 
which acts upon starch does its work only in an 
Starch alkaline medium, the saliva normally being 

And Acids slightly alkaline. However, as all of our food ex- 
cept meat and nuts contains starch, this would 
interdict the eating of fruits with any food ordinarily served. 
Even cottage cheese and buttermilk with their lactic acid con- 
tent would have to be eaten by themselves. With a properly 
balanced ration and careful mastication the question of this 
combination may be disregarded. 

The milk and sugar combination has already been spoken of 

and, while it is perhaps not necessary to avoid it 

Milk and entirely, it should be remembered that milk and 

Sugar sugar combined in excessive quantities may prove 

very injurious, and for one with a weak digestion 

should be avoided. 



COMBINATIONS 137 

Whether or not milk and fruit should be taken at the same 
meal depends largely on how they are taken. We quote as 
follows: 

"There is a deep-rooted impression that sweet milk and fruit 
should not be taken at the same meal. This idea is evidently 
largely based upon the fact that milk curdles in the 
Fruit and presence of a fruit acid ; but the curdling of the 
Milk milk by the fruit acid aids rather than retards its 

digestion. The first thing that happens to milk 
when it reaches the stomach is that it is curdled. There is a 
special milk-curdling ferment in the stomach. A fruit juice 
more acid than the normal gastric juice of the stomach cannot 
be found. Lemon juice, one of the most acid of fruit juices, 
added to milk, renders the milk easier of digestion. We 
should guard against the sudden pouring of a large 
quantity of milk into the stomach, as this may form large, 
tough curds, difficult of digestion. If the milk is taken slowly, 
or mixed with the food as it enters the stomach, it will be con- 
verted into small curds." — Dr. George Thomason. 

It is well to remember that fruit is practically predigested 
and quickly passes from the stomach unless combined with a 
food requiring prolonged stomach digestion. For this reason 
some may find it an advantage to eat the fruit part of their 
meal first, thus allowing it time to pass from the stomach be- 
fore a great deal in the way of other food follows. Still others, 
as suggested above, find it better to eat their fruit alone, un- 
combined with other foods. Ordinarily, however, milk eaten 
on cereal, or taken in sips thus allowing it to enter the stomach

same meal. It should be remembered that thorough mastica- 
tion will prevent the unpleasant results which sometimes seem 
to follow the introduction of these unlike foods into the stom-

ach. More often incomplete mastication rather than the non- 
ideal combination leads to fermentation. 

Another rule in regard to combinations that has been given 
is the one that two starches should not be eaten at the same 
meal, or that bread must not be eaten with a starchy 
Two food. However, as so many of our foods contain 

Starches starch, the following of this rule would be quite 
impractical. The principle underlying it obviously 
involves the question of the proper food balance. This hav- 
ing been looked after by the intelligent housewife in the plan- 
ning of the meal, the question of whether or not two or more 
foods containing starch should be combined can be forgotten. 
It can readily be seen that a meal composed of rice and pota- 
toes with white bread would be far from correct healthwise, but 
this mistake no one who understands the fundamentals of 
dietetics will make. 

Someone else raises the question, "Should two kinds of fruit 
be eaten at one meal, or is it healthful to eat stewed fruit and 
fresh fruit at the same time?" We know of no 
Two Kinds reason why these combinations are objection- 
Of Fruit able, and again we would emphasize the impor- 

tance of getting away from petty rules and of 
intelligently planning the daily dietary, combining common 
sense and good judgment with a knowledge of scientific prin- 
ciples. Eat a few well selected foods at one meal. Do not 
overeat or undereat, but see that the foods are so prepared and 
combined in the daily ration that the necessary food elements 
in proper proportion and amount are supplied to the body. 



CHAPTER XVIII. 
Fads. 

What to eat has always been the big and engrossing question 
with mankind ever since Eve in the garden made her first great 
mistake and Adam as the result was sen- 
An Engrossing tenced to a lifelong earning of his bread in 
Question the "sweat of his face." The question has 

been an absorbing one from the standpoint 
of the epicurean whose desire was to find some new thing with 
which to please the palate to the man or woman who in the 
face of poverty has had the problem to solve with the wolf at 
the door. 

The primary thought in regard to eating having ever been to 
please the senses, man has long since reached the place where 
because of certain discomforts and ailments ob- 
What Shall viously due to error somewhere in the amount 
We Eat? or kind of food taken he asks the question, 

"What shall I eat?" from the standpoint of one 
who has come to realize that he must eat to live rather than 
live to eat. 

We hear the question from the man or woman who regards 
it sanely, sensibly and with a real desire to understand the 
principles underlying nutrition; and from the fanatic and the 
hypochondriac, who look upon all food as an enemy and seem 
to think that the less of it and in the most unpalatable form 
the better, expecting that everything eaten will cause distress 
unless it be taken according to the most rigid rules and with 
the utmost self-denial. 

This question has been carefully investigated from the stand- 
point of science, more and greater light has gradually been 
thrown on it until today those interested in this all important 
subject have only to study the proper literature to learn much 

139 



140 THE HOME DIETITIAN 

in regard to the scientific principles underlying the question of 
how to supply the body with proper food. 

Together with a fund of scientific facts accessible to the in- 
vestigative mind are various fancies and fads brought forth 
by those who in their searching have often 
Fads Many gotten but a single truth instead of the whole 
And Varied fundamental outline involving body nutrition. 
Fads in regard to diet are many and varied. 
The question of eating having become so problematical, men 
both scientific and otherwise, have advanced many theories as 
to the practical solution of these dietetic problems. 

The partaking of food leading to so many ills it has been 

only a matter of course that some one should come forward 

with the assertion that, if eating causes such a large 

Fasting proportion of sickness, abstinence from food would 

undoubtedly prove a cure-all, and so the "fasting" 

fad has had its day. 

So much trouble having resulted from faulty and incomplete 
nutrition it has seemed the natural thing that an effort be 
made to overcome this condition by forcing an excess of food 
upon the body. The thought has been that at least a part of 
the excess must be assimilated and that the body, 
Forced gaining strength from added nourishment, would be 
Feeding better able to cope with problems due to a weak 
digestive tract. And so "forced feeding" has played 
a great part in the treatment of anemic conditions, malnutri- 
tion and wasting disease, as tuberculosis, etc. 

Abnormal conditions resulting from errors in protein diges- 
tion and metabolism being so apparent, the "low protein" idea 
has been advanced, and many have been led to the 
Low extreme of omitting as nearly as possible all pro- 

Protein tein from the diet — subsisting on a meatless, eggless, 
. milkless diet, with nothing to take the place of 
these protein foods. 



FADS 141 

Protein, however, being such a necessity and the harm result- 
ing from a deficient protein diet so apparent to secure this 
food in as digestible and assimilable a form as 
Milk Diet possible has seemed most important, and so the 
"milk diet" has had, and still holds a great place 
as a "cure all" for all conditions of disturbed nutrition and 
chronic disease. 

Others seeing conditions so often resulting from an over- 
worked digestive tract and an excessive body 
No Breakfast fuel supply have sought to solve the problem 
and to obtain results by the "no breakfast 
plan" which has worked admirably in many cases. 

Again the prevalence of eating processed, over-cooked, over- 
seasoned foods having been so evidently a factor 
Raw Food in the causation of disease the advantages of the 
other extreme have been widely heralded and 
the "raw food" fad has had a great following with much bene- 
fit, no doubt, to some. 

So much of digestive disturbance seemingly due to improper 
combination of various sorts, many have thought that all 
dietetic errors might be corrected if a few 
Combinations rules in regard to what foods may be com- 
bined, were obeyed, and so many "diet spe- 
cialists" have confined their dietetic teaching to the questions 
of "combinations." So we hear that a starch and an acid must 
not be eaten at the same meal ; bread must not be eaten with 
starchy foods, two starches must not be combined; two kinds 
of fruits, fruit and vegetables, fruit and milk, are all wrong 
combinations, until one finds himself so surrounded by a maze 
of rules that bewilderment results and fear lest some rule 
be disobeyed takes such a hold that eating becomes a bur- 
den and the digestive organs, affected by anxious mental im- 
pulse, are unable to care for the simple food that may be 
taken. These bewildered friends, still suffering ills apparently 



142 THE HOME DIETITIAN 

due to dietetic mistakes, are at loss to know how to solve a 
problem which becomes more and more a vital one, and in 
desperation ask the question, "What can we eat?" 

Along with all this comes the theory that it does not make 
any difference what you eat; "forget it and eat what you want." 
Build up the general health by exercise, and 
"Eat What proper and regular living; maintain the correct 
You Want" mental attitude and eat what your appetite calls 
for. For those who have long been introspec- 
tive and have feared to eat, this advice may be very timely. 

We would wish no one to think that we have not the fullest 
respect for each one of these various rules in regard to eating. 
Each one has done much good and in selected cases under 
proper supervision there is no doubt but that each one of these 
may apply and perhaps in a more or less modified way be used 
with great success in the treatment of various and sundry ab- 
normal conditions. Every one of these hobbies 
Many Winds has had its basis in truth. It is in the applica- 
Of Doctrine tion that mistakes have been made. The rule 
has been advanced, the reason why has been 
vague and indefinite, and the people, untaught in regard to 
body processes and food composition, have been tossed about 
by many winds of dietetic doctrine. 

The reason for these rules in regard to eating becomes very 
apparent when one has been properly educated in food funda- 
mentals. The application, based upon principle, then becomes 
plain and the modern housewife, as the home dietitian, may 
wisely plan the food program for her family in 
A Better such a way as to apply sensibly the principles 
Way upon which all of these fads are founded. She 

can thus avoid the necessity of having members 
of her family submit to any one of the above lines of dietetic 
treatment for the correction of conditions brought on by over- 
eating, undereating, or improper eating of any sort. 



FADS 143 

Briefly we will consider the principles underlying the appli- 
cation of the eight methods given above of overcoming nutri- 
tional ills. 

1. Fasting: In conditions of auto-intoxication and over- 
loaded digestive tract, excessive putrefaction in the large in- 
testine and a body often supersaturated with nourishment, a 
fast for a more or less limited time undoubtedly would be 
indicated. It must be remembered, however, that except per- 
haps for a short time, the advantage of a complete fast, with- 
out the disadvantage, may be obtained by a 

An Antitoxic modified fast such as a food supply limited 
Diet to those things that will tend to decrease auto- 

intoxication, e. g. fruits and fruit juices. These 
may be taken alone or with a certain amount of green vege- 
tables and perhaps lactic acid foods, as cottage cheese, butter- 
milk or yogurt.* An occasional meal missed; a day without 
food or with nothing but fruit will often be found a great ad- 
vantage. "Abstemiousness in diet is rewarded by mental 
and moral vigor." — White. 

2. Forced Feeding: Less can be said in favor of this plan. 
However, there are cases where the food supply has long been 
deficient when it may be found a decided advantage to insist 
upon the ingestion of food in amounts necessary to supply the 
excess of nourishment needed to build up a body long weak- 
ened and wasted from lack of food. This is to be done gradu- 
ally and carefully with due regard for existing conditions and 
dietetic principles. This plan should always be carried out 
under competent supervision. 

3. Low Protein: Those, who have long overeaten of pro- 
tein food and are suffering the results of protein putrefaction 



*In the dietetic treatment of diabetes, an initial period of fast- 
ing- is often carried on under the careful supervision of the attending 
physician. 
10 



144 THE HOME DIETITIAN 

in the intestine and incomplete protein metabolism, often do 
well for a time on much less than a normal supply of this 
nitrogenous food until the excess has been eliminated and the 
body calls for more to keep up actual repair. However, this 

must be done carefully as an exceedingly low pro- 
Serious tein diet continued for too long a time will result in 
Results weakness, lowered nerve tone, malnutrition and even, 

because of lowered resistance, in an increased sus- 
ceptibility to such diseases as tuberculosis. In these cases the 
ingestion of protein is less than the outgo; the body is out of 
nitrogenous equilibrium (see footnote page 56), and the re- 
sults will be serious unless the condition is soon corrected. 

4. The Milk Diet: This diet is valuable in many cases. 
It permits of an excess of nourishment in an easily digested 
and assimilated form. Many will take the amount of food 
units that their body needs and the excess that, because of de- 
pleted conditions, they should have for a time in the form of 

milk better than in any other way. However, 
In Selected we believe that these cases should be carefully 
Cases selected and that often the same, or even better, 

results may be obtained by a modified milk diet, 
or by a diet in which the same advantages may be derived with- 
out the absolute restriction. We know of no serious objection 
to the milk diet as a trial even though the same results might 
be obtained in another way. The plan is simple and needs not 
the thorough knowledge of foods necessary in planning a varied 
diet with the same results in view. 

Often little permanent good results from this plan of feeding 
because the patient, upon going back to his usual dietetic pro- 
gram, returns to the same errors that led to trouble in the first 
place, so he has gained little in the way of lasting benefit if in 
addition to the milk diet he has not obtained a knowledge of 
the normal rational eating that makes for health. 



FADS 145 

5. The No-Breakfast Plan: This plan we consider a very 
good one because. First, many have eaten a hearty dinner the 
evening before, their digestive organs have had to work while 
they slept and are in no condition in the early morning to take 
up the work of digesting even a light breakfast. Second, the 
plan lessens the daily food intake and discourages overeating. 
Third, the digestive organs should have more rest between 
meals than they usually get; six to eight hours intervening, 
being the ideal. With no breakfast and an early lunch this 
would be accomplished. 

It can readily be seen, however, that understanding the prin- 
ciple one may get the same advantageous results by leaving out 
supper or by eating carefully three times a day. 

6. Raiv Food Diet: The advantages of this are many: 

(1) It ensures an ample supply of vitamines which lessens 
the amount of protein needed. (See Chapter IX.) 

(2) It necessitates thorough mastication. 

(3) It prevents rapid eating. 

(4) It hinders excessive seasoning and the use of super- 
heated fats. 

(5) Many vegetables are more digestible raw than cooked. 

These principles borne in mind will enable one to avail him- 
self of all the advantages of the raw food diet without the re- 
strictions. However, too much cannot be said in favor of the 
eating of vegetables and fruits raw; a certain amount of these 
taken daily being a decided advantage. 

7. Combinations: This is by no means an unimportant 
subject, and the housewife wishing to feed her family for the 
best results in health and vigor should be informed as to the 
principles underlying this phase of dietetics. But here, as 
elsewhere, those who have only a few rules by which to be 
guided, without a knowledge of the reasons why, will often fail 
to accomplish the important results they seek. (See Chap. 
XVII). 



146 THE HOME DIETITIAN 

8. "Eat What You Want." For the poor neurasthenic, who 
has forgotten everything in life but the question of what he 
dare put into his stomach, this is perhaps the best of all. And 
it explains the often apparently marvelous results of various 
faith cures, so called. Too much attention to the digestive 
tract may be worse than none at all and some may well, for 
a time at least, "forget it." 

Again the importance of intelligent application of principle 

cannot be too emphatically urged. Let us know 

Principles our bodies and their needs; supply them wisely 

Not Rules and in a masterly way and thus rise above the 

petty handicaps that hinder us in our endeavor 

to reach our ideals and to find success. 



"There are more things in Heaven and earth, Horatio, than 
are dream't of in your philosophy." — Shakespeare. 



CHAPTER XIX. 

The Feeding of Children. 

It is in childhood that the foundation for the health or ills 
of life are laid, and more can be accomplished by proper 
feeding of the boys and girls while yet in the developmental 
stage than in after years when the seeds of ill health have long 
been sown and nature has begun to take her toll. Careful 

feeding can do much to prevent the digestive 
A Foundation upsets and respiratory troubles so common 

among children and will lay a foundation for 
health and strength in after life that means more than any 
heritage of lands or gold. 

We cannot in our limited space present an exhaustive treatise 
on this important phase of dietetics, but we can lay down a 

few principles that may serve as a helpful guide in 
Normal the important work of supplying to the child 
Physical the food which will yield happy results in the way 
Growth of a normal physical growth. The body is made up 

of the food supplied to it. This food should be 
complete, untainted by impurities introduced from without or 
manufactured from within. 

Perhaps one of the most important things to be made em- 
phatic is the necessity for regularity in feeding with ample 

length of time between meals for the stomach to 
Regularity entirely empty itself. We find that even infants 

do much better when fed every three or four 
hours, than when fed every two hours as has so commonly 
been done. They gain in weight more rapidly, have less colic, 
and are happier in every way. 

When it is necessary to feed babies artificially, it is safer to 
use only sterilized milk. It has been found too that the boiling 

147 



148 THE HOME DIETITIAN 

of milk greatly increases its digestibility*. However, if the 
milk is boiled or even pasteurized, it is of the greatest im- 
portance that these babies receive in addition to their milk, 
at least an ounce of orange juice daily; a neglect of this 

precaution often being a factor in nutritional 
A Precaution disturbances, such as scurvy, eczema, rickets, 

etc. (See Chapter IX.) Orange juice may be 
introduced carefully into their diet at any time after the age 
of one month, and it is often a valuable addition to the diet of 
even a nursing infant. 

If the baby does not take orange juice well, or if this 
fruit is difficult to obtain, the necessary vitamines may be sup- 
plied in potato water or in other vegetable broths. Other 
fruit juices may be used as lemon juice or grape fruit juice. 

It is well after the age of seven months to gradually intro- 
duce into the diet additional foods as vegetable broths and 
purees, potato gruel and cereal gruels. To make 
After Seven the cereal gruels, the cereals should, after thor- 
Months ough cooking, be put through a colander or 

strainer, and to the jelly-like mass left should 
be added milk (not cream) to make it the consistency of gruel. 
Add no sugar. 

A little later or by the age of nine months, vegetable purees, 
oven toast, hard crackers and scraped apple or apple sauce 

should be given; also other fruit purees and 
The Second fruit juices. Early in the second year the 
Year child should begin to have green vegetables as 

spinach, green peas, string beans, etc. These 
should be pureed at first, but soon the child may be taught to 

♦According to Dennett the milk or milk mixture, the proportion 
depending- upon the baby's age, should be boiled vigorously for three 
minutes, stirring well to prevent the formation of a scum. The curds 
formed from this milk are fine and much like those of mother's milk, 
and when properly supplemented with orange juice and vegetable 
broths are not constipating. 



THE FEEDING OF CHILDREN 149 

masticate thoroughly the more tender cellulose, so that tender, 
carefully cooked vegetables may be given without being 
strained or pureed. These vegetables should be cooked with 
due care to preserve the vitamines. (See Chapter XIV.) 

The sooner after the age of twelve months that children are 
put on three meals a day the better. If anything is given be- 
tween meals it should be fruit or a drink of milk. Even this 
extra, if allowed, should be given at the same hour every day 
with unvarying regularity. One mistake that is often made is 
in keeping children too long on milk alone, some babies being 
nursed into the second year or kept upon the bottle long after 
they should be having a greater variety of food. 

The cereals will during the second year have an important 
place in the diet of the child along with milk toast, and stale 
bread and milk. In the beginning of the second year well 
cooked cereals may be given the child without the preparatory 
process of straining. These cereals should be thoroughly cooked. 
The mistake is often made of adding sugar to the 
A Mistake cereal, but the child should learn from the first 
to take cereal and milk without sugar. Great 
harm is done by educating children to like sugar in this way. 
Never at any time should the combination of milk and sugar 
be allowed on cereal, whether gruel or mush. 

Bread should be whole wheat and graham, or made from 
other whole grains, and should be at least thirty-six hours old. 
All toast given the child, whether dry or as milk toast, should 
be in the form of oven toast, hard clear through, with more 
than merely a superficial browning. 

Artificial sweets should be limited. (See Chapter IX, p. 91. 

Quot. from Dr. Kerley.) It were better for any child if he 

need never know of the existence of cake, pie, ice 

Sweets cream and ordinary desserts. It is only as a result 

of education that children acquire the sweet tooth 

so common among them. But it can hardly be hoped that the 



150 THE HOME DIETITIAN 

ideal will be reached — there are too many loving friends to 
teach our children to like these things for us to expect to be 
able to keep sweets entirely away from them. If the sweets 
could be limited to their proper place and to that alone, no 
harm perhaps might be done, but with the knowledge of the 
delight to the palate comes the difficulty of teaching proper 
control and moderation. However, this must be done and our 
aim as parents must be, if not to restrict entirely, to limit candy 
and other sweets to the proper time, place and amount. Much 
can be done in this direction, and it is surprising 
The Body how much co-operation can be elicited from the 
Machine little folks if they are taught in the interesting way 
that it is possible for them to be taught, the im- 
portance of caring for the body machine as carefully as father 
looks after his watch or his automobile. 

The element of education and discipline entering into this 

phase of child culture gives the parents the great opportunity of 

obtaining results not only in a physical way, 

Self-control but also in the way of character building and 

self-control, so closely is the physical allied 

to the intellectual and moral. 

But it is only as the mother has mastered for herself the 
problem of eating for health and the necessary self-control to 
reach this high ideal, that she can be master of the important 
work of feeding and teaching her child. 

The dainty morsel of candy can be eaten as dessert and 
when the little one has, with a hearty appetite, eaten well of the 
dinner served, a very small amount of candy will 
Generosity suffice. Then too, as a matter of politeness, the 
supply of sweets must be passed and divided 
with the members of the family, and in this way the amount 
may be quite easily limited to the one or two pieces the child 
may be allowed to have. With great care should the mother 
prepare the simple dessert allowed her tiny man, that there 



THE FEEDING OF CHILDREN 151 

may be nothing served him that would in any way detract from 
the benefit his little body should derive from this food. 

Cereal desserts made with cereal, egg and a moderate amount 
of sugar are often good (See recipes Chapter XXII) and, 
served at the midday meal, simply add more 
Simple calories that the growing child may thrive. Des- 
Desserts serts such as prune whip, banana whip, junket, 
fruit mold (see recipes Chapter XXII), are all 
good and supply the necessary sweet. The little one will 
delight in these simple things if they are made attractive and 
he will derive only benefit from them. Dried fruits as figs, 
dates, raisins, etc., may help to supply the needed sweet in a 
very wholesome form. 

The fresh fruit served the boy or girl will be delighted in 
for its own flavor without added sugar, if a little tact is used by 

the thoughtful mother. The sliced peaches, berries 
Fresh and other fresh fruit served may be enjoyed without 
Fruits the sugar usually added. Special care should be 

taken that this fruit be naturally sweet and pal- 
atable. The older members of the family may in their inter- 
est in watching the beautiful development of this normal boy 
or girl become enthusiastic in eating as carefully as the little 
folks are taught to eat and thus become examples, incidentally 
deriving immense advantage to themselves. 

Ice cream should be withheld as long as possible, but as the 
child grows older it may seem almost impossible to withhold it 

entirely, but it must be insisted upon that it be 
Ice Cream eaten only at meal time, that it take the place of 

real food and that it be eaten slowly and in mod- 
eration. Too much cannot be said against the pernicious cus- 
tom of permitting the child to obtain ice cream sodas and ice 
cream cones promiscuously from any and every ice cream 
stand. This tempting sweet should be obtained from a source 



152 THE HOME DIETITIAN 

that guarantees its freshness and purity, served with care and 
best in the home at the regular meal. 

A simple sponge cake or plain cookie may be allowed in 
place of. or in connection with, the dessert. 

At bread making time a crusty sweet cake can be made 
Cake from the bread dough that will be as much a delight to 

the normally educated child as a French pastry to the 
one who has been trained to like excessive and rich sweets. 
When pie is served the older members, how the little one will 
rejoice in a tiny pie made especially for his or her benefit, and 
the crust may be as hygienic as bread, for it may be made from 
the same dough, and its palatability will never be questioned 
by the small recipient. 

Another common mistake in feeding children is in the 
thought that they must have an abundance of fat — cream on 

their cereal, butter freely on bread, richly 
Concentrated seasoned vegetables and even fried and 
Food greasy foods. This plan for them does untold 

harm and their appetites are so educated that 
they can never perhaps get away from the bondage of ac- 
quired and perverted tastes. Dr. Kerley says that "the average 
child after the sixth year receives two or three times as much 
energy food as he requires." (This probably does not include 
the poorer classes.) Energy food we know to be fat and car- 
bohydrate. 

In almost every case whole milk is better than cream. The 
child needs ample protein, but not an excess of fat. The ca- 
tarrhal conditions, frequent colds, enlarged ton- 
Undesirable sils, adenoids and recurrent bronchitis so 
Results common among children undoubtedly are fa- 

vored, if not caused by, the excess of fat given 
them together with the large amount of sweets allowed in their 
diet. The result of these mistakes are never entirely overcome 



THE FEEDING OF CHILDREN 153 

and thus the individual goes through life handicapped because 
of the ignorance of his parents. 

For a child subject to colds, no plan is better than a diet 
limited, for a time at least, to boiled skimmed milk, whole 
cereals, green vegetables, fruits, cottage cheese, 
A Corrective buttermilk, vegetable broths and vegetable 
Diet soups (See recipes 23 to 31, Chapter XXII), 

and perhaps an occasional egg. Butter used 
very moderately if at all. 

Above all things do not serve your children hot fresh bread, 
griddle cakes, fried potatoes, richly seasoned foods of any kind. 

Give them plenty of food requiring thorough mastication as 
hardtack, oven toast, etc. Teach them to masticate thoroughly. 
Impress upon their minds that if they are to have beautiful, 
sound teeth, these teeth must be exercised as 
To Encourage well as kept clean. Tell them how the 
Mastication starch is changed to sugar in the mouth. Let 

them become interested in seeing how much 
sugar they can manufacture out of a crust of bread and how 
sweet the sugar will taste. The social element at meal time may 
be one of the best safeguards against too rapid eating and im- 
proper mastication. 

We quote the following: 

"After the teeth begin to come children should be given all 
their starchy food in as hard a form as possible and the per 
cent of starch limited. 

"The preponderance of the carbohydrates in the diet is one 
of the causes of so many children entering the kindergarten 
with their teeth broken down to the gums and small undersized 
jaws. One of our responsibilities is spreading the knowledge 
that no demineralized white bread or crackers should ever be 
given to a child under five. We not only need all the lime 
salts contained in the dark breads to build the teeth and bones, 
but we need exercise to develop the jaws. 



154 THE HOME DIETITIAN 

"Children who eat tough bran bread made into toast instead 
of mush and who do not drink while eating usually get the 
proper development of the jaws." — M. Evangeline Jordan, 
D. D. S., in California State Health Bulletin. 

Tea and coffee must never be allowed, even cocoa should be 
kept away from them. Children are much better off without 
meat and meat broths with their protein wastes. It 
Avoid is well for the child up to the age of four or five 
years to eat by himself and not at the family table 
unless the other members of the household can themselves 
co-operate with the small boy or girl in eating for the body 
strength and health. Usually the evening 
Co-operation dinner is later than the child should take 
his evening meal and it becomes a simple 
matter to serve his simple meal at 5:30 and his appetite is en- 
tirely satisfied when an hour later his elders partake of theirs. 
Never should food be allowed between meals. If the hungry 
boy waits until meal time he will eat at the right time the food 
he needs, and care much less about the sweet after- 
Between part. Plain food will taste good and be quite 
Meals satisfactory, and the supply taken will be sufficient 

to last until the next regular meal. If the boy 
after school must have something to "stay his stomach" until 
supper time, let it be an apple or other fruit and this the regu- 
lar daily plan, instead of a spasmodic one. 

During the period of growth and development much more 
food is needed per pound of body weight than after maturity is 
reached. It is impossible to say how much 
Amount of Food food a growing child may need. It all de- 
Needed by Child pends upon the activity of the child and 
the rapidity with which new tissues are 
formed. The child who cares little for vigorous play but en- 
joys his books, should eat less food than the one who plays 
hard all day. Other things being equal, the child of phlegmatic 



THE FEEDING OF CHILDREN 155 

temperament will need less food than the one who is of a 
more nervous, impulsive type. The amount of food needed 
depends upon tissue activity and this varies with individual 
temperament. Boys, because of greater muscular activity, need 
more food than do girls. 

Every mother should see that her child gets active physical 
exercise daily. Then if the boy or girl is fed regularly, does 
not eat between meals, eats wholesome food, prepared with due 
regard for hygienic principles as outlined above, the appetite 
will be one of the best guides as to the amount of food required. 

A careful estimate for a few weeks of the calories taken by 
the child will be of advantage to the mother from an educa- 
tional standpoint, and will permit her to study and to deter- 
mine the results when the daily amount in food units is de- 
creased or increased for a time. 

It should be remembered that it is not bulk so much as con- 
centration of food that determines its caloric value. And also 
that the candy or knick-knack taken between meals may in- 
crease the total food value above actual body requirement, 
even though the child eats a comparatively small amount of 
food at mealtime. 

Do not underfeed your children. They must be properly 
and sufficiently nourished. Their body demands are great and 

must be supplied, but they can have enough 
Body Demands food without that which will handicap 
Great rather than help the body in its work. Of 

protein they must have an ample amount, of 
carbohydrate and fat a normal supply, but they may get this 
without excess and with every advantage to their growing needs. 
Great danger lies in a diet for them top-heavy in fats and 
carbohydrates with often not enough protein. The results of 
such as unbalanced diet are serious and parents should know 
how to avoid a mistake which is far too common. Some sweets

they should have, but the intelligent mother having mastered the 
important principles of nutrition, will supply these in a simple, 
not too concentrated a form and combined in a healthful way. 
She will be teacher as well as mother, and will teach her boys 
and girls that the most wonderful, the most manly, womanly 
thing they can do is to develop strong, healthy, normal body 
machines that will make of them strong, noble men and 
women, able always to do well their part and to make a suc- 
cess of life. 



"The mother who holds herself responsible for what her 
child shall wear and yet does not feel that she is answerable 
for what he shall eat, shows that she regards his outer appear- 
ance more than his health of body or moral strength." 

— Elizabeth Harrison. 

"In these years of infancy and childhood, food and nourish- 
ment are of special moment; not alone for the time, but also 
for the child's future life. Through its diet, a child may grow 
up to be — in the business of life — idle or industrious, dull or 
lively, weak or strong." — Froebel. 



CHAPTER XX. 
Food Economy. 
(Written at the time of the Food Conservation Campaign, 1918. 
Hoover Food Dictator.) 
We have come to the time when "economy" is the watch- 
word: conservation of men, money, food. Well had it been 
could such an impulse have been given prosperous civilized 
man without the appearance upon the stage of action of dire 
necessity in the shape of a gigantic war ! Con- 
Conservation servation of the health, of the resources of the 
Always race should always have been the ideal, but in 

The Ideal the mad rush of a strenuous life we have 

thought that we could spare no time for petty 
economies, not even for those of body conservation and the 
things that would mean the most in the longevity and efficiency 
of the human race. After all it is in the time of stress that we 
come the nearest to reaching our ideals and, in suffering, has 
mankind ever reached the highest state of perfection. Sterling 
qualities, physical and mental, gain strength only through 
exercise and exercise comes in the face of resistance and trial. 
So today in the face of a great need, many will acquire depth 
and breadth of character and attain to ideals of living far out 
of the reach of the throng in times of prosperity and peace. 

Eating for pleasure's sake has for so long been the only 
thought in supplying the body with food; for so long the sole 
ambition of the overworked housewife has been 
The Old to supply her family with food that would "taste 
Standard good" that often all else has been lost sight of. 
Life in so far as the housewife has been concerned 
has become sordid and ideals have been cheapened. Neither 
has her energy been conserved, the food supply, or the body 
strength and resources of those who day by day sat down to an 

157 



158 THE HOME DIETITIAN 

overstocked board loaded with eatables far in excess of phys- 
ical needs. 

Today in the light of scientific advance and national need 
the mother in the home is blessed with a new vision. The 
needs of the hour, the demand for conservation 
A New both of food and of physical resources, lends a new 
Vision interest to her plans. Her work is no longer a mere 
drudgery to please the varied tastes of a family de- 
manding that their appetites be pampered three times a day, 
but she becomes master of a new situation: that of furnishing 
the table with a food supply adequate for body needs, bal- 
anced with such correctness that there is the least possible 
waste in the raw material, in its preparation, or in its ultimate 
utilization by the body; at the same time yielding the highest 
and most satisfactory results in physical health and strength. 

She is no longer merely cook; she becomes a dietitian 
whether she prepares the food with her own hands or directs 
its preparation by those under her. She is no 
The Home longer content to leave the question of feeding 
Dietitian her family with the ordinary cook, however ex- 
perienced and competent, but personally super- 
vises the important work of supplying those at her table with 
the food yielding the best results with the least possible waste. 
Thus she serves her country, is a blessing to her family and 
to the race. 

Her immediate reward she will receive in seeing those in her 
care thrive and develop in a normal physical way, and in 
knowing that by her thoughtfulness and careful planning more 
has been left to maintain the great supply necessary to feed the 
world. 

"The heart of her husband will safely trust in her, and her 
children will rise up and call her blessed" and, no matter how 
narrow her sphere may seem to be, she will be doing her bit 
and this perhaps the most important service that can be appor- 



FOOD ECONOMY 159 

tioned to any in this time of need for every possible conserva- 
tion of national resources. The need no longer so urgent, she 
will still appreciate the advantage of wise economy and will 
continue to direct her family in the way that will lead to the 
results most needed by the home and nation in time of peace, 
as well as in time of war. 

True food economy in so far as the body is concerned is the 
partaking of the minimum amount of food necessary to fully 
supply the body needs and to keep one in 
Economy health, with some reserve in the form of stored 
And Health food as fat. Overeating, as we have learned, 
interferes with proper oxidation, and complete 
elimination. The blood thus becomes surcharged with wastes, 
the tissues overloaded and the circulation sluggish; the 
mind becomes clouded and many are the evil results. But 
with a proper food balance all of the body processes are car- 
ried on with freedom and alacrity, strength and poise, and re- 
sulting health, vigor and efficiency. "Economy in food does 
not signify ill health, but rather the reverse, as undoubtedly in 
times of peace and prosperity a very large number of people 
eat unsuitable food and more than is good for them." — Edi- 
torial Medical Record June 16, 1917. 

Because the suggestions of the present food campaign are 
so in harmony with the laws of scientific dietetics and so ever 
applicable and, helpful for any time in com- 
How America bating the "high cost of living," we will 
May Feed consider against the background of the Food 

The World Question as we have followed it in our pre- 

vious chapters, the practical points in Food 
Conservation as emphasized in the setting 
forth of the needs of the present hour. The vital question is 
that of having enough food to go around. The problem would 
be solved were no one to eat more than necessary to ade- 
quately supply his physical needs. This alone would mean a 
li 



160 THE HOME DIETITIAN 

saving in the total amount of food entirely sufficient to feed the 
world, even though America were the only source of supply. 
And what would it not mean in the added physical strength and 
efficiency of the nation, in the lessening of disease, in the in- 
crease of mental and moral power, in the advance of national 
enlightenment and onward stride of civilization. 

Dr. H. Edwin Lewis in American Medicine of May, 1917, 
says, "Not the least of the duties of this department (Depart- 
ment of Food Conservation) will be the systematic dissemina- 
tion of information in regard to the amounts and kinds of food 
required to maintain perfect health." 

But not only must there be a reduction in the total amount 
but certain kinds of food must be used more sparingly and 
with greater care, and again we see man- 
Normal Food kind thrust back as it were by an irre- 
Balance Propor- sistible force to the normal food balance 
>tionate to proportionate with natural supply. The 

Natural Supply sure result of this to be a more normal, 
natural method of living compatible with 
the highest degree of health and enlightenment. 

How strange that the foods we must get along without are 
those foods that we have been using in excess of physical need, 
and that we could not have had, had not the total food supply 
been so abundant; far in advance of that actually needed by 
the world population. And so we have been led to profligacy 
in eating and living. Can it be possible that the disasters of 
the most terrible war of history may be compensated for to a 

degree in the resultant necessity for obedi- 
A Compensation ence to natural law as regards the feeding 

of our bodies? In the raising of the 
physical plane of the people, who have long been looked upon 
as the teachers and leaders of the world? 

Because of the need for food conservation we find that as a 



FOOD ECONOMY 161 

nation we must readjust our dietetic habits in the following 
ways: 

First — We Must Eat Less Meat: We come face to face with 
the fact of our extravagance in feeding so much of our food 

grains to stock, and then killing and eating the 
Save Grain animal which might have been saved for the 
And Milk production of milk by far the most economic 

method of converting vegetable into animal food. 
We are reminded that each pound of meat not eaten will save 
ten pounds of grain and the economic value of a vegetarian 
diet becomes apparent. But in the light of modern hygienic 
dietetic principle this self-denial becomes a source of satisfac- 
tion and pleasure. The meatless days are no hardship and 
are many instead of one or two a week. (See Chapter X.) 

Second — We Must Use Less Fat: In Ten Lessons on 
Food Conservation by the U. S. Food Administration, we are 
advised to "avoid cooking by means of frying," and again to 
"preach the gospel of reducing the total amount of fat 1/3 oi 
an ounce a day for each adult." We are told that the waste of 

1/4 oz. of butter daily in every one of our 20,000,000 
Save households would mean 312,500 lbs. a day, 
Butter 114,062,500 lbs. a year. How easy to save this 

amount and much more by eating less. Without a 
doubt each individual in the ordinary family could eat *4 oz - 
less butter daily and be the gainer healthwise; and how much 
more in the way of valuable fat could be saved if the hygienic 
method of cooking with the use of the minimum amount of free 
fat be adopted by the housewives of the land. 

Among other suggestions are these : "Choose recipes calling 
for less fat;" "use cream desserts sparingly;" "buy whole 
milk instead of cream; use the top milk on cereals, etc., 
and the remainder for drinking and cooking." We are told 
that the value of skimmed milk has not been appreciated; that 



162 THE HOME DIETITIAN 

as a meat substitute it is quite as valuable as whole milk, as it 
contains just as much protein. 

What a source of satisfaction our economy in this direction 
becomes when we learn that a reduction in the use of free fat 
and fried foods will greatly lessen the prevalence of certain 
diseases among us, and thus increase our strength as a nation. 
(See Chapter VII.) 

Third — We Must Greatly Reduce Our Sugar Supply: It is 
suggested that more honey be used; that fresh fruits be eaten 
more plentifully instead of the cooked fruits 
Use Natural requiring sugar ; that dried fruits be used to 
Sweets take the place of sugar. That dried fruits be 

added to desserts, in this way lessening the 
amount of sugar needed. 

How enthusiastically we can co-operate as we learn the great 
advantage to be derived healthwise, from a reduction in the 
use of this concentrated food. How easy this restriction be- 
comes when we realize the added benefit derived from the use 
of fresh fruits, with their vitamine content and predigested 
sugar; when we appreciate the nutritive value of honey and 
dried fruits with their content of fruit sugar. (See Chap- 
ter VIII.) 

Fourth — We Must Learn to Do Without White Flour: We 
are finding it necessary to use flours made from a variety of 
cereals, as oatmeal, cornmeal, buckwheat and rice. 
Coarse Those most addicted to the use of fine flour bread 
Breads are learning because of wartime necessity to culti- 
vate a taste for breads made from the coarser unre- 
fined whole grains. We are accustoming ourselves to break- 
fast cereals made from other grains than wheat. 

There is no hardship in this in the light of our knowledge 
that upon a "monotonous diet of a single cereal," even though 
it be our faithful standby wheat, we may be unnecessarily lim- 



FOOD ECONOMY 163 

iting our tissue supply of complete proteins; when we know 
that the use of refined flours robs our bodies of elements es- 
sential to life and health. (See Chapter XV.) 

Fifth — Use More Vegetables in Season and Prepare Them 

Without Waste: This suggestion can be followed only with 

the greatest satisfaction when we become aware of 

Natural the valuable nutritive elements in these natural 

Foods foods, and of the great nutritional value of those 

parts so often thrown away. (See Chapter XIV.) 

Sixth — We Are Urged to Prepare Our Food With Due Regard 
for Fuel Conservation: Again we can see in this a great ad- 
vantage when we think of the vital ele- 
The Less Cooking ments in fruits and vegetables, so often 
The More Life- destroyed in the cooking, and the benefit 

Giving the Food derived when these foods are eaten raw. 

To the saving of fuel in the use of the 
fireless cooker is added the enjoyment of added delicacy of 
flavor, and of a knowledge that there are in this way retained 
valuable food elements, often lost in the ordinary methods of 
cooking. (See Chapter IX.) 

Seven — Waste Not, Want Not: Our attention is called to 
the enormous waste in this country. A recent Government 

Bulletin tells us that the estimated food 
Food Waste of waste of the U. S. equals in value 
$700,000,000 $700,000,000.00 annually. We quote again 

from Dr. Lewis: "It is a well established 
fact that the waste of food each year is enormous. The amaz- 
ing prosperity throughout the country during the past few 
years has made the people careless, and in the kitchens of our 
homes, our large hotels and public institutions, the waste, ac- 
cording to a very conservative estimate, is said to exceed 10%. 
Indeed there are those who, as the result of careful thought and 



164 THE HOME DIETITIAN 

investigation, do not hesitate to say that 20% is more nearly 
correct." 

There is the waste due to thoughtless extravagance in sup- 
plying our tables, a common fault of which the majority of 
American people are guilty. Thus at every meal in the home, 
or public eating place, the average individual invariably in- 
sists on having a great deal more than he needs, often more 
that he can possibly eat — the remainder is thrown away. 

From the Independent we take the following: 

"What is needed is the individual cultivation of the custom 
of taking no more food on the plate than one expects to eat, 
and then eating it all unless it proves unpalatable or excessive. 
If this practice were universal, we should have enough to put 
up a palatial postoffice in every hamlet, pension all descend- 
ants of all the soldiers, build the biggest navy in the world, and 
carry out any of the schemes of social improvement urged 
upon us." 

Even in times of peace the world's needs are great enough 
to demand conservation of resources in every way possible and 
the "Gospel of the Clean Plate," so impressed 
A Rule of upon our minds in times of stress, should 

Daily Living never be forgotten in times of prosperity, and 
the admonition to "gather up the fragments 
that nothing be lost," should be a rule of daily living, however 
abundant our supply. 

So we find that Food Conservation means body conservation 
and health; that the need for food economy can have only a 
most beneficial effect upon the American home, and that the 
educational value of the present Food Campaign will prove to 
be far beyond estimation. 

The problem of feeding the family with the least expense, 
the least food waste, and the best results in a sufficient and 
balanced food supply thus becomes one of fascinating interest ; 



FOOD ECONOMY 165 

one that makes of the housewife a scientist as well as an artist; 
raises home keeping to the dignity of a profession, and will 
in time of the greatest prosperity do more for the nation in con- 
servation of resources and in race betterment than can in anv 
other way be accomplished. 

The woman of the land, the housewife, the mother in the 
home thus becomes in this way, as well as in many others, the 
power that rules the world, builds the nation and shapes the 
future destiny of the race. 



"Much food is in the tillage of the poor; but there is that 
is destroyed for want of judgment." 



CHAPTER XXI. 

Summary and Conclusion. 

1. Our bodies are made up of the food we eat. "As a man 
eateth so is he." Quality of tissue depends on quality of food. 

2. Food may be of poor quality when eaten or it may be- 
come contaminated during a process of retarded digestion, and 
so be impure as it enters the blood. 

3. Excessive quantity is sure to impair quality of food and 
of the food laden blood. 

4. Chronic disease is largely due to defective food analysis 
in the body. These conditions are all preventable. Knowl- 
edge is power. 

5. Know food values, the composition of foods and the 
relation of food elements to body needs. 

6. See to it that your daily ration is a balanced one. Do 
not consider the question of calories an arbitrary one. Re- 
member that individual needs and conditions must be consid- 
ered and rules modified. Estimate your calories for two weeks. 
How much are you eating, and is it the right amount? Couid 
you do just as well on less or do you need more? Sit in 
judgment on your own case. 

7. Remember that excessive calories can not make up for 
deficient vitamines. That the body can not utilize food unless 
the necessary ferments of life processes are backed up by an 
ample vitamine supply. Know the vitamine foods and avoid a 
devitalized diet. Eat freely of raw foods and do not forget the 
value of green vegetables. 

8. Avoid a monotonous diet and thus the danger of defi- 
ciency in quality as well as in quantity of proteins. 

9. Do not consider it a hardship if you find it necessary 
from the standpoint of economy to limit your meat supply. 
Remember that an adequate, properly balanced diet is very 

166 



SUMMARY AND CONCLUSION 167 

possible without the use of flesh food, and that the fleshless diet 
offers many advantages healthwise. 

10. Keep out of your food those things that make it "hot 
when it is cold" and that tend to produce irritated catarrhal 
conditions of the digestive mucous membrane. Remember that 
the mucous membrane may be irritated not only by condiments, 
but also by excessive and superheated fats, improperly masti- 
cated and indigestible food, and by cane sugar in concentration. 

11. Do you long for a good complexion? Eat less free fat, 
more raw carrots and green vegetables. 

12. Remember that your health and efficiency are impaired, 
your possibilities for length of life lessened by the use of bev- 
erages and foods which continually, even though slightly, stim- 
ulate because of drug principles that they contain. 

13. Remember that bread is the "staff of life" only when it 
contains its nutritive elements entire, and that the use of the 
whole grains is economy from every standpoint. 

14. Regard desserts with suspicion, use them with caution 
and when used, let them supply a need rather than serve as an 
excess. 

15. A simple variety at a meal is a great advantage and the 
best combination is a well-balanced ration. 

16. No one dietetic plan is a "cure all." All rules have 
their exceptions. The only safe plan is to have a thorough un- 
derstanding of dietetics and of the principles of nutrition with 
the use of common sense and good judgment in their appli- 
cation. 

17. The physical foundation for mental and spiritual 
growth is most important. The greatest work that can be ac- 
complished is that of feeding the child in such a way as to 
insure the highest type of physical, mental and spiritual de- 
velopment. The self-discipline and control that this will foster 
is not the least of the good results. 



168 THE HOME DIETITIAN 

18. Conserve your food intelligently and thus your health. 
Economy is spending not less, but more wisely. Much that 
is expended for food could be used with better and far more 
lasting advantage, in some other way. 

19. Remember that good food may be wasted, or spoiled in 
the preparation, and that cooking should be a science as well 
as an art. 

20. Remember that how you eat is quite as important if not 
more so that what you eat. Food eaten properly is much less 
liable to be taken in excess. Proper and thorough mastica- 
tion will cover a multitude of dietetic sins. If you must hurry, 
eat less. 

21. Allow ample time for stomach digestion by sufficient 
rest between periods of work so that this your faithful friend, 
upon the integrity of which so much depends, may not give 
out before its time. 

22. System and regularity are as important in the work of 
the digestive tract as in all other business. Therefore, plan 
for regular habits of eating. Never eat between meals. 

23. If fluid taken at meals hinders the proper mastication 
of your food, go on a dry diet. 

24. Do not forget that adherence to principle in eating is 
an evidence of strength of character and that he who eats to 
live will longer live to eat. 

25. Above all do not be a fanatic. 



"The object of physical health is not health as an end, but 
as a means to the end of efficiency." — Dickenson. 



INTRODUCTION TO CHAPTER XXII. 

This book is not a cook book. But in order to help the 
housewife make practical application of the principles laid 
down in the preceding chapters, and to acquaint her in a 
measure with simple hygienic methods of cookery, we append 
a few representative recipes that we trust may serve to intro- 
duce her into the art and science of healthful food preparation. 

To lend variety many of these recipes may be modified. The 
housewife already versed in the art of cookery may often be 
able to improve upon the recipe given, but we trust that she 
may do so with intelligent regard for food values. The size of 
the serving may often vary, but the calories given for the 
entire recipe will enable anyone easily to estimate the value 
of any sized helping. A few of the recipes have been received 
directly from the Bulletins sent out by the United States De- 
partment of Agriculture. For many we are indebted to our 
friends: Miss Lenna Frances Cooper, director of the Battle 
Creek Sanitarium School of Economics, and author of The 
New Cookery; Mr. H. S. Anderson, dietitian of the Loma 
Linda Sanitarium and author of Food and Cookery; and to 
Mr. E. G. Fulton, for many years proprietor of the Vegetarian 
Cafeteria, Los Angeles, and author of the Vegetarian Cook- 
book. A number of recipes have also been taken from the 
Manual of Recipes of the Washington Sanitarium, Washing- 
ton, D. C. 

To these most excellent and reliable authorities on hygienic 
and scientific cookery, we would recommend those who desire 
to inquire further into the detail of Modern Culinary Art.

solve the sugar and salt in the rest of the water; mix the two 
solutions and add all to the meal (or meal and flour). Mix 
thoroughly so that all the liquid is incorporated in the mass, 
cover and set in a moderately warm place to rise. After about 
2 hours, or when well risen, add the shortening and knead 
well, adding a little meal if necessary, until a smooth elastic 
dough has been formed. Cover and set aside again to rise for 
an hour. Knead lightly, form into a loaf, place in a greased 
pan; allow to rise until just double in bulk (this is only % 
of the usual rise in the pan when white bread is made) . Bake 
slowly for % of an hour. 

Calories per slice would vary slightly from bread as given in

many others. 

In the making of this soup stock there may be cooked with 
the potato and onion any other vegetables as carrots, tomato, 
cabbage or lettuce leaves, celery tops, etc. Or the soup 
stock may be made from potato parings alone, with or without 
the parings and outer leaves of other vegetables. If parings

savory flavors. Beet juice, turnip water, asparagus broth, etc., 
may be added in varying amounts, depending upon individual 
preference, and there need be no monotony in the soups served. 
Cream may be used instead of milk ; or, if preferred, the soups 
may be served without the addition of milk or cream. If served 
without milk or cream it may be an advantage to thicken them 
slightly with a cereal as gluten, cream of barley, oatmeal, etc. 
Left-over cereal may be added to the soups with satisfactory

bay leaf, sweet basil, etc., may be used. But no fat of any
