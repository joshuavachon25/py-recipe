PREFACE, 




WELL-KNOWN Statesman of our own times has 
earned no little part of his deserved celebrity by his un- 
tiring advocacy of a " free breakfast table," that is to 
say, a morning meal in which every article of which it may be 
oomposed is free from taxation and impost of any kind whatever. 
To aid in the attainment of this object by getting jdd of igno- 
rance and incompetence in the preparation of dishes, and 
bringing under the housekeeper's notice a variety of articles 
suitable not only for the brtakfast table, but for dinner ^ tta^ 
and supper as well, is the object of this little book. 

In its pages the housekeeper will find ample and intelligible 
directions for the preparation of delicious puddings and pastry, 
Isy using Messrs. Goodall, Backhouse, atd Co.'s inexpensive 
and economical Baking Powder and Egg Powder, whteh are 
equally serviceable and indeed almost indispensable in making 
light and digestible bread, biscuits, and cakes. The various 
modes of making custards -uid blancmanges of various kinds by 
the aid of Goodall, Backhouse, and Co.'s invaluable Custard 
Powder and Blancmange Powder are also described in 
detail, and the methods also of preparing eg^s. omelets, cheese, 
etc., so as to render these articles of food as wholesome and 
digestible as possible. Those who require a grateful beverage 
for summer and winter may learn how to manufacture cheap, 
but excellent, ginger beer by Messrs. Goodsdl, Backhouse, -and 
Co.'s marvellous GiViger Beer Powder ; while wives and 
mothers will find advice gratis on health and home remedies, 
simple but effectual, such as Quinine Wine and Kaberry's 
Lumbago, Gravel, and Liver Pills, prepared and sold by 
this firm. Every housekeeper, moreover, should note what is 
said about Goodall's Brunswick Black, the best preparation 
extant for keeping stoves and grates bright and clean through 
the summer. 

In the First Series of this Work anyone may learn how to 
dress meats, fish, poultry, and vegetables, and how to make 
soups, sauces, and salads, all of which may be improved by 
adding a little of Goodall's Yorkshire Reush or Mushroom 
Ketchup, the best and cheapest preparations of the kind that 
money can proc\u%.

PUDDINGS AND PASTRY. 

• 

p make paste for pies And puddings that ^hall 
be light and esLsy of dig^ion should be the 
ambition of evexyone who desires to excel 
as a cook. The preparation of light and wholesome 
pastry has been rendered fair mott easy of late years 
by the introduction of a most trseful preparation 
known as "baking powder." The value of baking 
powder to the housekeeper, however, does not con- 
sist solely in the fact that its use tends to make pastry 
and pudding-crust light. It possesses the further re- 
commendation of producing paste for puddings and 
pies, at the cheapest possible rate, for butter can be 
dispensed with altogether if it be desirable to do so 
on the ground of economy ; while, in making pud- 
dings, eggs may be used in less quantity, or omitted 
altogether, if baking powder be made use of. It is 
necessary, however, to caution the buyer against the 
indiscriminate use of all baking powders. The 
manufacturers of the Yorkshire Relish, Messrs. 
Goodall, Backhouse, and Co., of Leeds, prepare 
Good all's Baking Powder also, that can be 
thoroughly depended on for the puriiy of its ingre- 
dients, and the absence of alum and other harmful

substances, which are frequently introduced into pow- 
ders of this kind. Another useful article, by aid of 
which custards may be made without egg^ and a rich 
and most palatable accompaniment prepared for all 
kinds of pies and puddings, whether made of fresh 
fruit, dried fruit, or preserves, is Goodall's Custard 
PpWDER, manufactured by the same firm — Messrs. 
Good all. Backhouse, and Co., of Leeds. A pie or 
pudding, be it of what kind it may, cannot fail to give 
satisfaction when either or both of these most useful 
aids to good cookery have been used in its making. 
Let no housekeeper, therefore, think that she is fully 
prepared for culinary work in the kitchen, unless she 
have at her elbow plenty of 

GOODALL'S BAKING POWDER and 
GOODALL'S CUSTARD POWDER, 

manufactured by Messrs. Goodall, Backhouse, and 
Co., of Leeds, and sold by all respectable grocers 
and oilmen throughout the United Kingdom and the 
British Colonies. 

Golden Rule for Baking Pies and Pastry. — 
Meat pies, unless the meat be partly cooked by stewing 
before it is put under the paste, should be baked in a 
slow oven. Pastry, fruit pies, 6rc., should be baked 
in a quick oven. 

Golden Rule for Boiling Puddings, — 
Puddings of all kinds should be plunged into boiling 
water, and the water should boil, **^t simmer, all the 
time that the pudding remains in it. Jt is well nigh 
impossible to boil a pudding too long. 

Pudding cloths should be kept scrupulotisly clean. 
Wash out the puddina cloth well as soon after the 
pudding is taken out of the boiler, dr»^., as may be con- 
venient ; dry it thoroughly, and put it away in a clean 
place, ready for use at another time.

Matekials.— Suet, thiee quArters of a pound : 

tablespoonful of Goodall's Baking Powder, 

Co., of Leeds; one pint of waler. 

Pkocess.— Mince the suet as finely as possible, 
and, with IhesJl, mix 
it well wilh the flour;

light and eiceUent paste suitable for all ordinary 
purposes. 

t^ Ttt maHa^ pastry, pics, and fudaingi see that 
you have Goodall, Backhouse, and Co.'s Bakinq 
Powder, a^I use it. WAtn this powder U used no 
disaMoinlment can ensue, and, as Iht ingredients of 
which it is composed are pure and wholesome, no ill 
e^ts can result from its use. 

Is it always necessary to use six ounces of saet to one 
pounfl of flour ? 

No ; a good plain crust may be made with five or 
even four ounces of suet to the pound of flour, the 
baking powder lendine to make the eruat extremely 
light and osy of diecsllon. 

Is such ■ crust suitable for meat pies and puddings? 

It is good enough for any and every kind of meat frfe 
that IS baked and m-al pudding thai is boiled ; and it 
will be found encllenl for fruit pies and puddings for

hour in a hot oven, and then take it out and put it 
under the meat for about the same time. Cut the 
pudding into sc[uare pieces before transferring it from 

the tin to the dish to be sent to table. 

o 

lt^° T^is kind of pudding, when well made and 8 

rendered light and palatable by using Messrs, Goodall^ ^ 

Backhouse, and Co,*s Egg Powder, is a desirable f 
accompaniment for roast beef. 

Is Yorkshire Pudding eaten with meat only ? 

Its richness and lightness renders it a suitable pudding 
to be eaten with meat ; but when a few sultana raisins or 
currants are mixed with the batter, and a little sugar, it 
forms a nutritious pudding, especially for children, to 
be eaten in the usual way after meat 



APPLE PUDDING. 

Materials. — Some good suet crust ; from ten to 
twenty apples, according to size ; six or eight cloves, 
or a few strips of lemon peel. 

Process. — Line a pudding-basin, after greasing it 
well with butter, with some good suet cnist {see page 
7), peel and core the apples, and cut them into small 
pieces. Lay them within the crust, and throw in a 
few cloves or strips of lemon peel here and there. 
Then cover with suet crust, tie up with a floured 
cloth, plunge in boiling water in a large saucepan, and 
boil for two or three hours, according to size of 
pudding. As the watef in the saucepan boils away, 
add some more. A fruit pudding will bear a great 
deal of boiling, but it should be kept covered with 
water, and the water should boil, not sinmier, the 
whole time. 



Sugar should be added to fruit puddings and 
pies after they have been brought to table. Apple pud- 
ding is considerably improved by pouring over it some

rich custard, made ^Goodall's Custard Powder, 
manufactured by Mtisrs^ Goodall, Backhouse^ and Co., 
of Leeds, 

Why are apples cored before being made into pies and 
puddings ? 

To get rid of the hard lining of the cdls in which the 
pips are contained, this lining being apt to get between 
the teeth. In making apple dumplings the pips and core 
are left in the apple for the sake of the flavour that the 
former impart to the fruit. Apples baked in the oven 
or roasted before a fire and eaten with custard made 
of Messrs. Goodall, Backhouse, and Co.'s rich and 
delicious Custard Powder, form a wholesome diet for 
children, and act as a slight aperient. 

RHUBARB PIE. 

Materials. — Some sticks of rhubarb, weifi:h|ng, 
say, four pounds ; some good suet crust ; and lemon 
peel. 
Process. — Strip the skin from the rhubarb, thus 

reducing the weight to about 
three and a half pounds, and 
cut the sticks into pieces an 
inch in length ; if the sticks 
be very thick split them length- 
wise into two or three pieces. 
Line a pie-dish with suet 
crust, put a small cup in 
the centre, lay in the rhu- 
barb, scatter a few pieces 
of lemon-peel, and cover with 
paste. Set in a quick oven 
and bake for three-quarters of 
an hour.

into a bowl, and mix with the milk, adding the tnilk 
gradually until sufficient has been poured in to Make, 
with the flour, &c. , a mixture resembling tiitck creatn 
in substance. Pour into a buttered pie-dish, and

Is not this Very like Yorkshire Padding ? 
Yes-^ the ingredients are siimflar, but the mode of 
cooklDg is different. Such fitrit as cherries, well-washed 
cnrrants, '^c. may be mixed with the bat-ter, but in such 
case the jatter should be made stiifer, to prevent th^ 
fruit from sinking to the bottom of the basin, and tho^by 
appearing in a mass at the t<^ of the pud<ling whea 
boiled. 

OPEN JAM TART. 
Materials. — Some good puff paste ; prescnre of

Process. — Line a shallow tart tin, with a layer

thick layer of jam or mar-

edge of the paste with a

Goodall's Custard Powder, manufacturtd hv 
Messrs. Goodalt^ Backhouse, and Co. ^ of Leeds, and sold 
by all respectable grocers and oilnun^ 

Is the pi:e8«pr€ al^vays put on the pae^e .beioce bakic^ ? 

No ; soBoe consider the flavour of the jam to be spoiled 
by baking, so they baice the paste by itself in a quick 
oven, and then lay in the jam which has in the meantime 
been wanned in a stewpan. The ornaments, which have 
been also baked are then placed on the preserve. 

N.B. — A pretty efect is produced by dividing the paste 
into four, six, or eight compartments^ by means of strips 
of twisted or plaited pastry f and filling alternate com- 
partments •with jam and marmalade, or with either of 
these and custard. 

What are puffs ? 

Tarts that are closed with pastry instead of being left 
open. A thin layer of paste is made and cut into a 
circular form by the aid of a tin circle or saucer ; some 
fruit, as apple, or jam, is laid thickly on one half and 
the other half is turned over the fruit, and the edges of 
the paste pinched together in order to retaia the fruit. 

What is a pasty ? 

A very large kind of puff. Apples and meat are 
most commoDly used for making pasdes.

CUSTARDS & BLANCMANGES. 

HOW TO MAKE, AND HOW TO USE 

THEM. 

lUSTARDS, as we have already seen, form a 
suitable and palatable accompaniment to 
almost all kinds of pies and puddings made 
of fruit, whether fresh or dried. It is now 
necessary to look a little more closely into the method 

of preparing 
custards, and 
to see how 
custardsmay 
be utilised 
with other 
dishes than 
fmit pies and puddings, and even form the chief in-

gredient in the making of many light and highly

To make custards in the ordinary way several qss 
are required, which renders them expensive. For 
this reason they are seldom produced at the tables of 
any but those who are well-to-do in the world. It 
has been said that any man who can make two blades 
of grass grow where only one has grown before 
should be looked upon as a public benefactor. Surely 
then anyone who affords people the means of making 
a delicious dish at less than half its previous cost, 
has an equal claim to be so regarded. This has been 
done by Messrs. Goodall, &ckhouse, and Co., of 
Leeds, who, bv means of their Custard Powder, 
have enabled thrifty housekeepers to make delicious 
custards without eggs at a great reduction of cost. 
So that all may now enjoy those delicious prepara- 
tions which render fruit pies and puddings more 
palatable by softening the natural acidity of the fruit, 
form an agreeable sauce to some, and enter largely, 
if not entirely, into the composition of others. 

Hitherto, owing to the high price of isinglass, blanc- 
mange, which always forms a pretty supper dish, and 
strengthening diet for the invalid, has been excluded 
from the majority of middle-class tables, except on 
state occasions, but now, by using Messrs. Goodall, 
Backhouse, and Co.'s cheap and excellent Blanc- 
mange Powder, even the comparatively poor may 
have and enjoy a blancmange whenever they please* 



CUSTARDS.

ounces of white sugar ; while boiling, pour it into the 
basin, stirring all the time ; when cold, put it in the 
glasses. The custard can be used soon as cold. 

Delicious Custard Pudding. — One quajrt cxf new 
milk, mixed with three ounces of the Custard Powder ; 
boil a few minutes, let it stand till cold, then add one 
or two eggs, four tablespoonfuls of sugar ; pour into a 
pie-dish and bake for half aa hour. This makes a 
very delicious pudding. 

13" See that you get Goodall's Custard Pow- 
der, manufactured by Messrs. Goodall^ Backhousey 
and Co.y of Leeds, Ask your grocer ^r oilman for tt, 
and take none that does not bear ike name of this 
weli'known firm. 

Is no flavouring required with this custard? 

All the flavouring that is necessary has been already 
added by the manufacturer. To add to the appearance, 
however, of the preparation, you may, if you like, grate 
a littie nutmeg on the surface of the costard when it is 
placed in the jug, bowl, or custard cup in which it is to 
be sent to table. It is unnecessary to boil the eosfeapd, 
therefore failure through want of stirring when on the 
fire, and taking it off as soon as it begins to boi^ as in 
the ordinary method of making custard, is simply impos- 
sible. 

SULTAHA TIPSY CAKE. 

Materials. — One dozen square sponge cakes, or 
a sponge cake cut into slices — if stale, so much the 
better ; half a pound of preserve or marmalade; some 
sherry or raisin wine \ two ounces of sultana raisins, 
one ounce of citron, one pint of Custard {see pre- 
ceding recipe). 

Process. — If a large ^ooge cake be used, first 
cut it into slices ; soak the slices, or smoJLI sponge 
cakes — after spreading some jam upon them and ar- 
ranging them in a glass dish — in the wine j pour a pint 
of custard, while hot, w«r the whole, strew the raisins

oter the surface, and cut the citron into strips, and 
lay it here and there among the raisins. 

IS* If wanted for tHnner^ this dish should be 
made early in the morning. It is better at all times 
for being made some hours before it is wanted^ to allow 
the custard to get cold. See that the Custard Powder 
used in making the custard is that manitfactured by 
Messrs. Goodall^ Backhousey and Co,y of Leeds. 

NORMANDY PIPPINS. 

Materials. — Eight or ten Normandy pippins ; 
some water or cider ; quarter of a pound of moist 
sugar ; some good suet-crust {see p. 7 ) ; one pint of 
CUSTARD {see p. 19). 

Process. — Put the pippins into a pie-dish, strew 
half the sugar orver them and pour in sufficient cider 
or water (cider is preferable), to cover them com- 
pktely. Set them in the oven the last thing at night 
and there let them remain till morning, when it will 
be found that they have abscMrbed the water or cider 
in which they were placed, and swollen to roundness. 
Line a pie-dish with suct-crust, place the apples in 
the dish, add a little more water and sugar, and bnke 
for half an hour. When sufficiently baked let the 
dish stand till its contents are cold ; then pour the 
custard over the pippins, and serve. 



Custard prepared from Goodall's Custard 
Vovfl>fLSitmanufactured by Messrs, Goodall^ Backhouse^ 
and Co,, of Leeds, should be served with Normandy 
pippins y with or without pie-crust, and with all stewed 
fruits. 

BAKED PEARS.

CUSTARD CAKES. 

Materials. — Some rich puff paste ; one pint of 
custard. For the mode ormakingpuffpastej^r page 8. 

Process. — Line a tart dish or several p>atty pans 
with puff paste, and bake until sufficiently done. 
When the pastry is removed from the oven it should 
be allowed to cool for a few minutes, when the 
custard must be poured in.

paste use Goodall's Baking Powder, manufactured 
by the same firm. 

TAPIOCA PUDDING. 

Materials. — Four ounces of tapioca ; two ounces 
of beef suet ; one pint uf cold water ; one pint of 
milk ; one pint of custard. {See page 19). 

Process. — Chop the beef suet as finely as possible, 
and put it with the tapioca into a pie dish ; pouring the 
cold water over it. >et it in a cool oven for half an 
hour ; then add the milk ; mix thoroughly with the 
tapioca and return to the oven, letting the pudding 
bake for about an hour. Serve wiih the custard in 
a glass jug or bowl, as an accompaniment, and 
sweeten to taste with moist sugar or loaf-sugar pow- 
dered. Sago may be used instead of tapioca in 
making puddings of this kind, which are wholesome and 
nutritious, and especially suitable for young children.

BERMUDA PUDDING. 

Materials. — One pint of milk ; the peel of half 
a small lemon ; two ounces of loaf sugar ; one table- 
K>oonful of com>fiour; and one packet of Messrs. 
(ioodall, Backhouse, and Co.'s CusrARI> Powder. 

Process. — Peel the rind of the lemon as thinly as 
possible ; put the peel and lump sugar into the milk 
m a clean saucepan, and place over a clear fire until 
the milk just begins to boil. Before doing this, the 
corn-flour and Custard Powder should be mixed 
smooth in a basin, with four tablespoonfuls of cold 
milk, taken from the pint, before the remainder is set 
over the fire. When the milk is beginning to boil, 
add the last-named ingredients, and dlow the sauce- 
pan to remain over the fire for eight minutes longer, 
taking care that its contents are simmering nicely the 
whole time. Pour into a mould, and stand in a cool 
place until cold. 

i^" 7/ftij palatable pudding is much relished By 
children, and is improved by the addition of a little 
cream or preserve when sent to table, Goodall's 
Custard Vowder, for making this pudding, may be 
obtained of most chemists, grocers, and oilmen through- 
out the United Kingdom and British Colonies* 

Why should lemon peel, when used for puddings, etc., 
be cut as thin as possible ? 

Because the cells, which contain the essential oil, lie 
just under the surface of the peel ; so, by cutting the 
peel very thin, the cells are broken, and the oil, which 
imparts the flavour of lemon to any article with which 
the peel is used, is liberated in greater quantities than if 
the peel bad been cut thick. 

BLANCMANGE. 

Materials. — One pint of» new milk or cream ;

fonn of powder, bring it to this state by pounding it 
in a mortar ; then place the sugar and Blancmange 
Powder in a quart basin, with three tablespoonfiils 
of the milk or cream, and mix thoroughly, stiiring 
briskly until the sugar is completely dissolved. As 
soon as this is done put 
the remainder of the 
milk in a clean saucfepan 
and place it over a clear 
fire. "When the milk 
is just on the point of 
boiling, remove the 
saucepan from the fire 
and pour the milk on the ingredients in the basin. 
Stir the whole well together, and return the mixture 
to the saucepan. Have ready a mould or dish which 
has been wetted by dipping it into cold water, and 
when the mixture has boiled for six or eight minutes, 
pour it into the mould. As soon as the blancmange 
is cold it is ready to be sent to table, but before 
serving, it should be removed from the mould and 
placed on a pretty glass or china dish.

secondly, to save ell vvho may use them the trouble and 
expense of addim; special flavouring matter. I^astly, 
the presence of flavouring causes less time to be taken 
in the preparation of the blancmange, and enables any 
one, whose friends have dropped in unexpectedly to 
dinner, tea, or supper, to quickly prepare a nice addi- 
tion to whatever may be ready at hand to send to table. 

Can any other kind of dish be made by the aid of 
Blancmange Powder? 

Certainly I Blancmange — which, by the way, is pro- 
nounced dUk-monzky and means "white food" or 
"white jelly*'— is a preparat on of milk and isinglass 
and flavc iring matter, deriving its whiteness from the 
presence oi milk. When water, white wine, and the 
yolks of eggs are used instead of milk, a kind of yellow 
jelly is the result, to which the name of 

JAUNEMANGE 

is given; which means " yellow food," or " yellow jelly." 
In the present day many have a conscientious objection 
to eU anything into whose preparation any kind of 
wine, or spirit, or alcoholic drink has been used. Those, 
however, who use Goodall's Blancmange Fowl er 
may make excellent Jaunemange by adding a little 
saffron water to the ingredients above enumerated for 
Blancmange. Similarly, the addition of a httle cochi- 
neal to these ingredients will produce a " rose-coloured 
food " or jelly, to which may be given the name of 

ROUGEMANGE. 

Thus by a very simple contrivance variety of colour 
may be given to a most delicious dish, and thereby the 
appearance of a supper table may be wonderfully im- 
proved. An additional charm may be further imparted 
by garnishing the rougemange with white flowers and 
green leaves, as, for example, sprays of white jasmine ; 
the jaunemange with purple and white flowers inter- 
mingled, such as violets and white Scotch loses ; and 
the blancmange with flowers of almost any colour — 
blossoms of the red geranium or nasturtiums affording 
a pleasant and suitable contrast to the biiiliancy of its 
whiteness

BREAD, BISCUITS, AND 
CAKES. 

O necessary is bread for man's sustenance that 
it is frequently spoken of as the " Staff of 
Life." But though there is no article of food 
that is so indispensable for the support of life as 
bread, there are comparatively few families in which 
bread is made and baked. If housekeepers generally 
took to making and baking their own bread, they 
would soon find that they would not only get it at a 
much cheaper rate, but that the bread that is made 
at home is far more palatable and wholesome than 
that supplied by the baker, and that children, who 
ea't far more bread in proportion than adults, will 
thrive better on and yet require less of the former th^n 
they will of the latter. The truth is that most house- 
keepers do not care to face the trouble of making 
bread for many mouths when it can be had from a 
baker close by without any trouble whatever ; but a 
week's trial would show that the actual saving in out- 
lay, and the benefit to health, is worth all the trouble, 
and that the trouble is done away with in a great 
measure by the use of Goodall's Baking -Powder. 
Many kinds of baking powder have been introduced 
of late years, but the best and chejipest for all house- 
hold purposes, whether for making pies or puddings, 
bread or cakes, is Goodall's Baking Powder, 
manufactured by Messrs. Goodall, Backhouse, and 
Co., of Leeds, on account of the purity of the in- 
gredients of which it is composed, and its perfect 
freedom from alum which, on account of its astrin- 
gent qualities, is injurious to the stomach anddetrimen* 
tal to health. Baking powder is used as a substitute 
for yeast in making brnstd. Two teaspoonfuls should 
be used to every pound of flour.

well mixed, the next step in the process is to knead it 
and divide it into pieces sufficient each to make a 
round cake from 3i to 4 inches in diameter. Let 
the cakes remain for a short time before the Hre on a

oven and bake for half an hour. 



TAe Baking Powder manufactured by 
Messrs, Goodall, Backhouse, and Co,, of Leeds, is 
most suitable and economical for making Yorkshire 
Cakes, as well cts bread and pastry of every description. 

In some recipes we are told to use so many teaspoon- 
fuls. in others so many tablespoon fuls of Baking Powder. 
What relation or proportion do these quantities bear to 
one another ? . 

A dessertspoonful is accounted equal to two tea- 
spoonfuls, and a tablespoonful is equal to two dessert- 
spoonfuls or four teaspoonfuls, Always bear in mind 
that two teaspoonfuls or one dessertspoonful of Good- 
all's Baking Powder should be used to every pound 
g of flour for bread, and three teaspoonfuls for cakes and 

Ml tea-cakes.

13" J^or making tea cakes^ and all kinds of breads 
cakes, pies, puddings^ pastry, &*c,, Goo DALLAS 
Baking Powder, made by Messrs. Coodall^ Back- 
house, and Co., of Leeds^ is unequalled. 

Is bread made with baking powder digestible ? 

Far more so than bread made with yr'asr, which is 
fermented bread, while bread made with baking powder 
is wifermented. and therefore far more whol* some. It 
may be eaten as soon as it is cold without any fear of 
indigestion, which is almost sure to follow, with most 
people, when new fermented bread is enten. The threat 
secret of success in making bread with baking powder is 
to thoroughly incorporate the baking powder, flour, and 
other ingredients, mixing them well together and putting 
the dough, when ready, into a very hot oven to bake. 

Golden Rule. — Tn making unfermented bread 
with Goodall's Baking Powder, never deal with 
more than from two pounds to four pounds of flour at 
a time. This kind of bread is belter made in small 
quantities. 

BISCUITS.

fuls of Goodall's Baking Powder ; half a pint of 
milk. 

Process. — Mix the flour and baking powder well 
together, and then add just so much of the milk as 
is sufficient to mike the whole into a very stiff paste. 
After kneading the dough for some time, in order to 
make it perfectly smooth, roll it out in a thin sheet, 
and then with the top of a wine-glass or the cover of 
a round tin, cut out as many circles u{ paste as the 
sheet will allow, making what is left into a mass» rol- 
ling it out and cutting out circlets until the paste is 
used up. Place the biscuits on a greased tin, prick 
them over with a fork or skewer, and bake for alxmt 
fifteen minutes in a slow oven.

CURRANT BUNS. 
Materials. — One pound of flour; three teaspoon- 
fuls of baking powder ; half a pint of mUk ; half a 
teaspoonful of salt ; quarter of a pound of butter; 
q^arter of a pound of moist sugar ; quarter of a 
pound of currants or sultana raisins. 
Pfocess.— Melt tlie butter in the milk, and pour 

the mixture over the 
flour, baking powder, 
and salt, which should 
be previously thorough- 
ly incorporated in a 
large bowL When the 
dough is made add the 
currants or raisins, or equal quantities of both, if 
preferred. Sultana raisins are sweet and free from 
stones, and, therefore, more suitable for buns than 
the common raisins. Divide the dough into small 
pieces, shape them into buns and bake in a hot oven 
on a greased tin. Glaze with egg beaten up, applied 
with a feather before putting the buns into the oven. 
For plain buns use carraway seeds — half an ounce 
will be enough — instead of currants or raisins.

EGGS AND CHEESE. 

GGS and cheese form two very important 
articles of food, but it depends entirely on 
the manner in which eggs are cooked if they 
are wholesome and digestible, while with regard to 
cheese, though it is generally considered indigestible, 
it is thought to aid the stomach in the digestion of 
other foods, and it is beyond doubt rich in elements 
which tend to form flesh and fat. Eggs are most 
readily digested when beaten up, and used with milk 
and other substances in making puddings, &c.; and an 
egg beaten up with milk or a glass of sherry, and taken 
as a drink, is highly nutritious. The use of eggs in pud- 
dings and pastry has been to a great extent rendered un- 
necessary by GooDALL*s Baking Powder and Egg 
Powder, which renders all bread, pastry, &c., into 
whose composition it is introduced, extremely light 
and easy of digestion. It is chiefly desirable here to

BUTTERED EGGS. 

Materials. — Six eggs ; salt ; pepper ; one ounce 
of butter ; bread crumbs. 

Process. — With part of the batter well grease a 
small flat dish, just large enough to hold the eggs 
when placed in it side by side. Season with a sprink- 
ling ot salt and pepper, or strew a few bread crumbs 
lightly on the surface ; add the re^^t of the butter, cut 
in lumps, and placed here and thtre over the eggs. 
Place the dish in the oven until the whites are just set, 
and then hold it before the Are for a minute or two, 
to brown the crumbs slightly, and sejrve.

SAVOURY OMSLBT. 

Materials. — Four eggs ; two tablespoonfuls of 
milk ; salt ; pepper ; sweet herbs, dried and powdered 
in winter and fresh in summer ; an eschalot, or small 
onion ; a dessertspoonful of flour ; one ounce of 
butter. 

Process. — Break the egm into a basin ; add the 
milk, flour, a little salt, ai? just enough sweet herbs 
and eschalot or onion to impart flavour to the 
omelet. Whatever kind of onion is used, it should 
be chopped as finely as possible, and so should the 
sweet herbs, if fresh. Beat 
the ingredients till they 
are thoroughly incorpo- 
rated, and then pour the 
whole into a small frying- omelbt.

An omelet of this kind is improved by sprinkling 
it, after it is served to each person, with afeiv drops of 
Yorkshire Relish, manufactured by Messrs, Good- 
all^ Backhouse, and Co.^ cfLe^ds* 

What is a sweet omelet ? 

In making a sweet omelet, omk the salt, pepper, 
onion, and herbs, and add only a little sugar to the eggs, 
milk, and flour. Send Xxx table with some powdered 
sugar sprinkled over it, or a layer of marmalade or jam, 
folding the omelet over or rolling it up before sending it 
to tabte. 

MACARONI CHEESS. 

Materials. — Half a pound of macaroni ; boiling 
water ; salt and pepper ; two ounces of cheese ; half 
an ounce of butter ; some bread crumbs. 

Process.— Break the macaroni into small pieces ; 
put it into a stewpan with some boiling water sufficient 
to cover it, and let it simmer until soft and ten^kr. 
Strain off the ynter, and lay th« macaroni on a flat 
dish, or in a pie-dish that has been well buttered — 
the former is preferable. Season with pepper and 
salt to taste, adding a few grains of cayenne, if liked. 
Then cut the cheese, if soft, into thin slices, and 
spread the slices all over the macaroni, adding small 
lumps of butter here and there, and sprinkling the 
whole with fine bread crumbs. Set before the 6re or 
place in the oven for fi:ve or ten minutes, so that the 
macaroni may be impregnated with the flavour of the 
melting cheese, and the surface nicely browned. 



After macaroni cheese is sent to table, those 
who partake of it should sprinkle over it a little 
Yorkshire Relish, manufactured by Messrs, 
GoodaU^ Backhomet and Co,, of Leeds,

What cheese should be used in making this dish ? 

American or Cheshire cheese is excellent for all pur- 
poses, whether foe cooking or for eating as it is. When 
cheese gets hard and diy, as it will when kept for too 
long a time, it may be made available for making 
macaroni cheese by scrajMng or grating it. 

WELSH RABBIT. 

Materials. — Two ounces of cheese ; a table- 
spoonful of ale ; a slice of bread, cut thick ; pepper, 
salt, and mustard to taste. 

Process. — Cut the cheese into thin slices and place 
it before the fire or in the oven, in a saucer or tin in 
which the ale has been previously placed, and let it 

remain there till the cheese is 
melted. In the meantime, 
toast the bread, lay it on a 
hot dish, and pour the melted

Why is this dish called a Welsh Rabbit ? 

The word rabbit, as here used, is a comiption of 
rare M, and as the Wel&h are, or are said to be, fond 
of cheese thus prepared, toasted cheese has obtained this 
distinctive name.

pepper to taste, sprinkle with a few drops of vinqgar, 
and about half a teaspoonful of Yorkshire Relish. 
Continue to mash the mixture with a knife until it is 
reduced to the consistency of butter. Spread it on 
toast or bread, or bread-and-butter, before eating it. 

MS' Theficeuourof cheese prepared in this way is 
wonderfully like that of dressed crab, Yorkshire 
Relish, manufacture by Messrs. Goodall, Back" 
house, and Co., of Leeds^ should he eaten with real 
crab as well as mock crab, 

STEWED CHEESE AND ONIONS. 

Materials. — Two Spanish onions or four English 
onions of medium size ; quarter of a pound of cheese ; 
two ounces of butter ; pepper and salt ; bread. 

Process. — Skin the onions and boil them over 
the fire until they are soft enough to be mashed to a 
pulp. When this has been done, throw off any water 
that may remain in the saucepan, and put in the 
mashed onions. Add the cheese — which should be 
cut into thin slices, or grated if rather hard — and the 
butter ; place the saucepan over the fire and stir the 
contents for two or three minutes. Serve in a hot 
dish garnished with sippets of toasted bread. 



Yorkshire Relish, manufactured by Messrs, 
Goodall, Backhouse, and Co,, of Leeds, should be 
added to this dish, in the proportion of one table- 
spoonful to a large onion, or one dessertspoonful to an 
onion of medium siu, to impart pi^tancy to the 
general flavour. 

Are onions wholesome when prepared in this way? 

They are whotesome in any way, and very nutritious. 
When eaten for supper they have a tendency to promote 
sound deep. Onion porridge, consisting of onions 
mashed to a pulp, and eaten with a httle butter, pepper, 
and salt is a simple, but excellent remedy for a cold.

BEVERAGES FOR SUMMER AND WINTER. 

HERE is no man living who does not experi- 
rience parching thirst at times : there are few 
who quench their thirst, when they are tor- 
mented by an irresistible desire for dritik, in a reason- 
able and proper manner. Most men will either drink 
too qaickly or too much, wishing, like Mynheer Van 
Dunk, that their 

' • draught could be 
As full and as deep as the Zuyder Zee/' 

while many will seek to alleviate the drought which 
is drying up both throat and mouth with liquor that 
will, in nine cases out of ten, soon render the thirst from 
which they suffer more intense than ever. The most 
simple, natural, and wholesome way to quench thirst, 
may be enunciated thus : — 

First, bathe the wrists with cold water for three or 
four mintttes, and then drink a glass of ginger beer. 

The application of cold water to the wrists cools 
the blood, and thus tends to reduce the burning desire 
for drink ; and the ginger beer, swallowed when the 
thirst is already begtnmiag to lessen, removes the un- 
comfortable feeling under which the throat has been 
labouring, and strengthens and invigorates the sto- 
mach, benefiting the entire system. 

The poorest person In the British Isles need never 
be without ginger beer, for by using a packet of GOOD- 
all's Ginger Beer Powder, three gallons of the 
best ginger beer that can be procured, can be made 
for eightpence or ninepence, sugar included. The stone 
bottles in which ginger beer is bottled for use, hold 
just about half- a- pint : three gallons will therefore 
fill forty-eight bottles, and the cost of the contents of 
each bottle is no more thoxit/iree-siocteettths of a penny-

HEALTH AND HOME- 

REMEDIES. 

{or imparting strength to a constitution natu- 
rally feeble, as a sa£^;uard against febrile 
affections ; for recovering from weakness, oc- 
casioned by illness of any kind and tending, if neglect- 
ed, to produce mental affections ; for encouraging a 
healthy appetite and as a cordial stomachic, no medi- 
cine more valuable and efficient has hitherto beer 
found than quinine, the bitter principle of the bark of 
trees of the Cinchona family, or trees that yield Peru- 
vian bark. When extracted from the bark by a 
chemical process the alkaloid known as quinine is in 
the form of delicate white crystals, which are insoluble 
in water, and which must be dissolved by the agency of 
tome acid before they can be mingled with any liquid 
that is suitable for the patient or invalid to swallow. 
Quinine, in itself, is intensely bitter, and rec|uires to 
be mixed with some palatable li(^uid before it can be 
taken with any feeling of satisfaction. Orange wine is 
considered the most suitable vehicle in which to take 
it, but the difficulty that is experienced by so many in 
dissolving the quinine before putting it into the wine, 
to say nothing of the questionable quality of much 
manufactured wine of this kind, has debarred many 
from going to the expense of msdcing the preparation, 
while the unpalatable and intensely bitter taste of the 
medicine when made has caused as many more to put 
down the scarcely-tasted draught with disgust, re- 
solving to make no further attempt to swallow it 

Fortunately, however, for those who require this 
invigorating medicine in any form, whether as a tonic 
or as a febrifuge, Messrs. Goodall, Backhouse, 
AND Co., of Leeds, supply a preparation of quinine,

known as Goodall's Quinine Wine, which has 
the merit of being so palatable that even children and 
persons of weak digestion and highly sensitive palate 
will readily swallow this invaluable tonic, and so cheap 
that it can be purchased from the manufacturers, 
through their agents, the chemists, grocers, and oil- 
men throughout the Uqited Kingdom, at less cost than 
the various ingredients with which an equal quantity 
could be made up. 



In tAe preparation ^ Goodall's Quinine 
Wine, manufactured by Messrs, Goodall^ Backhouse^ 
and Co,t of Leeds, " Quinine,* the best and purest 
preparation of this invaluable alkaloid is always 
used. The crystals of quinine are dissolved in a vege- 
table acid, which prevents any tendency to griping pains 
in the stomach, so often felt by those who take this medi- 
cine when it is improperly prepared ; and the quinine, 
when dissolved, is combined with orange wine, made 
expressly Jor this purpose, from Seville oranges^ whose 
peel is rich in an aromatic oil, which tends to render 
the tonic more agreeable to the palate. 

Dose. — For adults a wineglassful ; for children un- 
der fourteen years of age, half that quantity, twice or 
three times a-day. The best time for taking this tonic 
is about an hour before any meal. 

Does not quinine often occasion headache? 

It will do so when taken in too great doses, or if taken 
for too long a time ; it is apt also to cause constipation 
of the bowels if taken in excess. A great advantage in 
using Goodall's Quinine Wine, manufactured by 
Messrs. Good all, Backhouse, and Co , is that ro 
harm whatever can result from taking it, because the 
quinine is blended with orange wine in such proportions 
as render a wine-glassful just a sufficient dose. When a 
course of Quinine Wine is taken, extending over a 
lengthened period, it is better to take it tor three days, 
and then stop for three days.

GENERAL DEBILITY AND WANT 
OP APPETITE. 

Any tendency to langour in a child or grown up 
person, and loss of appetite, should be checked as 
soon as detected. For this purpose the best medicine 
b Gooiaall's QuiNiNfc Wine, which should be ad- 
ministered immediately, and continued until the 
patient shows signs of returning strength and renewed 
appetite. 

COLD IN THE HEAD. 

A feverish cold in the head, attended with run- 
ning at the nose and watering of the eyes, should be 
checked as soon as it is felt by frequent doses of 
camphor in solution, dropped on lump sugar, and by 
putting the feet in hot water before going to bed. A 
cold will soon yield, if taken in time, to simple treat- 
ment, and any return of the ailment or predisposition 
to take cold may be checked and counteracted by 
taking Goodall's Qujnime Wins. * 

AGTJE. 

This painful disorder is occasioned by exfaaktions 
arising from low marshy ground, and frequently at- 
tacks persons who are litinginsuch localities, or Who 
are travelling through countries intersected by swamps 
and marshes. A tendency to ague shews that tne 
system requires strengthening by a tonic suck as 
GOODALL'S QUININK WiNB.

XNmGBSTION. 

This painful compfadnt, otherwise known as dys- 
pepsia, commonly snows itself in those of sedentary 
nalMts, whether compaisory through nectflsity, or 
adopted through inclination. To effect a complete 
core plenty of outdoor exerciae, attiention to diet, and 
sponging the body with cold water in the morning, 
are absolutely necessary, and a dose of Goodali/s 
Quinine Wins should be taken an hour before each 
imeal, 

KBRVOUSNBSS. 

The general condition of the system characterised 
by this name, and distinguisbed by the liability of 
the 8uA«fftr to start and become discomposed by any 
ittdden noist^ or the appearance or coming of anyone 
when not expected, is cbiefty due to general weaknett. 
In such cases the system should be strengthened and 
restored by means of nourishing food, Ixithing, out- 
door exercise, and a course of Goooall's Quinine 
Wine extended over a kngtbened period until all the 
symptoms have totally disappeared. 



RHEXJMATISM AND GOUT. 

AUealies, or the alkaline salts, are considered fitting 
remedies to be employed in the treatment of rheu- 
matism, and of these quinine is one of the most 
^{ficient. All persons who have a predisposition 
to rheumatism should occasionally take Goodall's 
Quinine Wine, in order to guard against lis attacks 
as far it is possible to do so. Those who have a 
predisposition to gout, whether hereditary or other- 
wise, should guard against it as far as possible by 
livine temperately, taking plenty of out>door exercise, 
and frequently using of Goodall's Quinine Wins.

KABERRY'S LUMBAGO, GRAVEL, AND 

LIVER PILLS. 

To be constantly sending for the doctor for every 
pain and ailment to which flesh is heir, would 
be very unprofitable, even if it were possible. It is 
advisable, therefore, never to be without simple and 
reliable remedies, such as are to be found in the 
wholesome and palatable Quinine Wjne, and the 
efficacious Kaberrv's Lumbago, Gravel, knd 
Liver Pills, manufactured by Messrs. Goodall, 
Backhouse, and Co., and procurable of them or any 
chemist or vendor of patent medicines. The pills re- 
move all obstructions and exercise a beneficial influence 
on all the organs of the body, while the former builds 
up and strengthens, completing the work of renova- 
tion that has been commenced by the pills. 

Mild in their operation, certain in their efiect, and 
in no way tending to necessitate confinement within 
doors, these pills have been found to be a valuable 
specific for many painfhl and common ailments. Not 
only are they serviceable in irregular action and 
torpidity of the liver and kidneys, but they are 
most efficacious for all irregularities of a special 
character to which women are subject, and a certain 
and effectual cure for lumbago, gravel, rheumatism, 
gout, and other painful ailments which mostly affect 
men. By the use of these pills most maladies may be 
quickly and cheaply cured, the most obstinate attacks 
yielding to the contents of two boxes, while half a box 
IS sufficient to subdue and cure general ailments.

A HINT FOR HOUSE- 
KEEPERS. 

t 

URING the bright summer months, when the 
nin upon the coal cellar has ceased for a 
time and fires are done away with until the 
approach of winter renders them again necessary, 
there is nothing perhaps more annoying to the house- 
keeper, or detrimental to the hearth-rug and carpet 
before the fire-place, than the continual blackleading 
that is necessary to impart polish and freshness of ap- 
pearance to the fire stove and its immediate frame- 
work, and the fender that lies before it. Servants ar« 
expected to roll up the hearthrug and lay a piece of 
hessian or a large coarse cloth in front of the grate 
before commencing operations, but these necessary 
preliminaries are often omitted, and the hearthrug is 
folded in two and used as a kneeling mat, and the 
carpet is soiled and partially spoilt by spots and 
splashes of blacklead. 

There is a way, however, of avoiding this, and all 
housekeepers would do well to adopt it. At the com- 
mencement of the summer season the entire face of 
the grate, the bars, back, and flap at the top, if there 
be any, should be well cleaned, as soon as the chim- 
ney has been swept, and then coated with Goodall's 
Brunswick Black. 

Brunswick Black is a species of black varnish well 
adapted for application to ironwork of all kinds and 
tinned ware, provided always that such ware is not 
used for cooking purposes. When it is used, a little 
should be poured into a clean earthen saucer, and 
applied with a small paint brush technically csdled a 

sn tool. 

When a fire stove has been treated in this way, the

window should be left open at top and bottom to 
allow of free ve&tilation until all snvell has disap- 
peared ; and care should be taken to raise no dust in 
the room by sweeping or otherwise, until the varnish 
is set and become quite hard. A fire stove thus 
treated will preserve a fresh and bright appearaooe all 
through the sammer, and nothing moce need be daae 
to it u»til fires are relighted, when it may be again 
blackleaded as usuaL It may farther be made omar 
mental by setting within the bars a laige pot filled 
with i«m8» and a row of ferns in pots may be placed 
in fr<»it of the stove within the fender. If the pots 
in which the ferns are placed be kept within other 
pots laiger in size, less watering will be required, 
and to prevent any escape of vi^er into the grate or 
on the fender after watering, care should be taken to 
set each pot in a large earthen saucer, which may be 
nearly hidden from sight by filling it with mossb The 
rich green of the ferns will find an admirable contrast 
in the bright black sxabuce of the stove. 

All iron articles, such as coal-scuttles, &c., when 
not required for use during the summer season, should 
be coated with Goodall's Brunswick Black before 
being laid up in ordinary. Those which show any 
signs of holes in the bottom should be seiil to the 
timnan or zinc worker, that a sheet of zinc may be 
laid over the inside and riveted strongly to the iron 
sheet of which the coal<*souttle is made. Whoi sent 
home the new work should be varnished over with 
Gooball's Brunswick Black. By such treat- 
ment all utensils of this kind will be fiwsb and souad 
when again brought into uscw
