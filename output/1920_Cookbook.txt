TREES 

"I love to look upon an old, old tree 

Because it seems to grow eternally: 

It does not ask (or any special care 

But just a place to live and grow somewhere. 

There's something 'bout a tree that is divine; 
The Lordly Oak, the Red Wood and the Pine 
All lift their heads above this earthly show 
And anchor deeper with the winds that blow. 

Trees bridge the future, present and the past, 
The only living things that seem to last, 
The centuries come, the centuries go 
But Cod's own trees just grow and grow. 

All other life upon the earth gives way 
To trees, but they somehow do longer stay; 
The Forest Kings, majestic noble Sages 
Live on; God's sentinels of the Ages. 

Of all the things that I might wish to be 

1 think that I would rather be a tree 

To live with arms outstretched to .Heaven above 

And grow in understanding and in love."

SALAD DRESSING 



Salad Dressing 

Six egg yolks, s ; x tablespoons of oil, six tablespoons of sugar, two ta- 
blespoons of mustard, one tablespoon of salt, eighteen tablespoons of vin- 
egar and eighteen tablespoons of milk. Put yolks in a bowl and stir well, 
add oil a little at a time until all is mixed. Mix together all dry ingredients 
and add to oil and eggs; add vinegar a little at a time, then add milk. Cook 
until as thick as custard. If thin thicken with cornstarch dissolved in milk. 
When cool, sprinkle with paprika. MRS. A. I. DUPREY. 

Salad Dressing 

One cup condensed milk, two pinches soda, one-fourth cup sugar, one-half 
cup vinegar. Beat until it will foam and look like whipped cream. Add 
salt and pepper to taste and a little mustard if desired. 

Dressing for Lettuce 

Mix three heaping teaspoons of sugar, a pinch of mustard, a little salt 
and a small amount of cayenne or paprika. Add to it three teaspoons of 
vinegar and a scant half cup of sweet or sour cream. Pour over shredded 
crisp lettuce and serve individually as a salad. This will serve two; double 
if necessary. MRS. KEITH HAMNER. 

Fruit Salad Dressing 

Two eggs beaten light, one small cup of sugar, juice of two lemons, one 
cup of cold water, two teaspoons of cornstarch dissolved in the water, salt 
and piece of butter the size of a walnut; cook in double cooker and thin 
with one cup of cream. 

Salad Dressing 

One cup mayonna ; se (either boiled or beaten), one hard-boiled egg; four 
tablespoons chili sauce, using the mayonnaise for the foundation. Thor- 
oughly mix in the egg, which has been chopped into very small pieces; then 
blend in the chili sauce until the whole is a delicate pink. Chopped olives 
and pimentos may be added if desired. This method is a great deal less ex- 
pensive, also considerably less work than the method generally used, and 
the results are practically the same. MRS. J. N. CHAIN.

CANDY MAKING 



Canned milk prevents graining. 
Lemon juice makes candy creamy. 

Atmospheric conditions affect candy. A damp or foggy day requires more 
cooking. 

Cover sauce pan until syrup boils to prevent sugar grains forming. If any 
form wipe off with damp cloth. 

When making cream candies divide mixture into several cups and place 
in pan of warm water to keep soft. 

Add coloring to candies with tooth pick to make delicate color. 



Turkish Delight Candy 

One quart granulated sugar, one-half cup cold water, one cup hot water, 
one box gelatine, juice of one lemon, juice and grated rind of one orange, 
one-half pound finely blanched almonds, one-half pound finely cut wal- 
nuts. Dissolve the gelatine in a cup of hot water. Let sugar and a half cup 
of cold water come to boil; add gelatine and boil ten minutes; add juice of 
lemon and orange and its rind ; lastly the nuts. Pour in shallow pan pre- 
viously wet with water. Let stand over night then cut in brick shape 
squares and roll in powered sugar. It will burn easily. 

MRS. HENRY DUNCAN. 

Butter Scotch 

One cup Karo or light molasses; one cup sugar; one tablespoon butter. 
Boil until hard when dropped into water. Run on buttered flat dish and

Marshmallow Candy 

Two tablespoons gelatine thoroughly soaked in six tablespoons cold wa- 
ter. Boil two cups granulated sugar and one cup boiling water until it forms

ered sugar. Cut in squares and roll each piece in sifted powdered sugar.

Hints to Housekeepers 



To keep bread or cake moist, place a piece of apple in the box with it. 
Try adding a pinch of salt to your cream before whipping. 

To cook vegetables quickly, add a pinch of bicarbonate of soda to the 
boiling water. 

A small spoonful of cornstarch will greatly improve the flavor texture 
of your fudge. 

A teaspoon of vinegar added to your cake icing will prevent it from be- 
coming too sugary. 

To prevent roasting meat from scorching, place a dish of water in the 
oven. 

To .remove the odor of fish or onions from the frying pan, put in vine- 
gar, heat to the boiling point, then wash out.. 

To avoide lumps in your gravy, mix your salt and flour before wetting. 
Try the juice of a lemon in a pan of water for freshening vegetables. 
To keep dumplings light, prick open when first taken from the kettle. 

To keep raisins from going to the bottom of your cake, roll in butter 
before stirring into the batter. 

For light fruit pies, put the sugar in when the pie tin is half full. Your 
pastry will not be so heavy. 

Dip an onion for a moment in boiling water, begin at the root and peel 
upward. You can peel and slice in this way without weeping. 

A few slices of raw potato put into soup that is too salty and boiled for a 
few minutes will freshen the soup and make it palatable. 

Drop a cup of English walnuts (whole) into the kettle while cooking 
cabbage or cauliflower. This will take away the unpleasant odor. A pan of 
vinegar on the back of the stove will have the same effect 

To tell mushrooms, spirinkle a little salt on the gills. If this turns the 
gills black they are fit for food. If yellow they are poisonous. 

To remove marks caused by hot dishes on the table, make a thin paste 
of salad oil and salt, spread on the table where the mark is, leave for an hour 
or so, then rub off. 

To remove ink spots from a varnished surface, use equal parts of vine- 
gar and linseed oil, well mixed, and apply with a soft cloth.
