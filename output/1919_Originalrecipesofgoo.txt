pint of water and cook for thirty minutes with seasoning to 
taste. Without disturbing ingredients add ^ pound of 
noodles and cook until noodles are tender. Mrs. B. Koch.

onion, 1 large carrot, 1 stalk celery or celery root, 3 leaves of 
cabbage, J^ cup lima beans, Y^ cup navy beans, 1 tablespoon 
salt. Put meat and cold water on to boil. Soon as it starts 
to boil skim. Add beans and vegetables, cut as for vegetable 
soup, add salt, cover and let boil slowly for three hours. 
Strain off half the clear soup and set aside to cool. Add 1

boiled rice. Mrs. Louis Ziv. 



Cream of Tomato Soup 

Peel and cut up a dozen ripe tomatoes, stew until tender in 
a cup of water, put through a colander or vegetable press, and 
thicken with 3 teaspoons of cornstarch, rubbed to a paste 
with a heaping tablespoon of butter, season to taste with 
salt, butter, onion juice, and enough sugar to correct the acid 
taste of the tomatoes. Pour slowly into a quart of un- 
skimmed milk scalding hot, to which a pinch of soda has 
been added. The mixture added to the milk should be brought 
to a boil before it goes into the sauce pan containing the 
milk. Serve at once before the foam induced by the boiling 
subsides. If you can have the milk one-quarter cream, the 
soup will richly deserve its name. Marian Krueger.

Betty and Her Daddy 

It's two in the morning and the house is cold. Out of the 
darkness comes a cry — 

"Daddy! Daddy!* Oh, Daddy!" 

And Daddy is up. He doesn't mind the cold if the little 
hand that pats him is warm. 

That was ten years ago — happy, short years, working for 
the baby and her mother. 

It is two in the morning again — and out of an awful dark- 
ness comes the cry — 

"Daddy! Daddy! Oh, Daddy!" 

But Daddy will never jump up again — and he does not 
know that Betty's hands are warm over his cold ones. 

*  :► 

It's two years later, and the little cash balance is gone. 
Mother is a forewoman in an overall factory. Betty is a cash 
girl. She will be an uneducated woman. "Daddy" and 
Mother had planned college and a happy life for her. 

The cash balance would have paid for an income for life for 
wife and daughter. 

Go, story from life, and save other fathers from making the 
same economic mistake !

"If you attempt the boiling to hurry, the gas only is 
wasted; but in attempting the roasting to hurry, the food as 
well, isn't fit to be tasted." 




Many Husbands are utterl}^ spoiled by mismanagement in cooking and 
so are not tender and good. 

Some women go about it as if their husbands were bladders, and l^low 
them up; others keep them constantly in hot water; others let them freeze 5y 
their carelessness and indifference. Some keep them in a stew by irritating 
ways and words, others roast them, and others keep them in a pickle all their 
lives. It cannot be supposed that any husband will be tender and good, 
managed in this way, but they are really delicious when properly treated. In 
selecting your husband you should not be guided by the silvery appearance 
as in buying mackerel, nor by the golden tint, as if you wanted salmon. Be 
sure to select him yourself, as tastes differ. Do not go to the market for 
him, as the best are always brought to the door. It is far better to have 
none unless you will patiently learn how to cook him. A preserving kettle 
of the finest porcelain is best, but if you have nothing better than an earthen- 
ware pipkin, it will do with care. See that the linen in which you wrap him 
is nicely washed and mended, with the required number of buttons and strings 
nicely sewed on. Tie him in a kettle by a strong silken cord called Comfort. 
as the one called Duty is apt to be weak. He is apt to fly out of the kettle 
and be burned and crusty on the edges, since, like crabs and lobsters, you 
have to cook him while alive. Make a clear, steady fire out of love, neatness 
and cheerfulness, set him as near this as seems to agree with him. If he 
sputter and fizz, do not be anxious about him. some husbands do this until they 
are quite done.' Add a little sugar in the form of what confectioners call 
;kisscs, but ,iTo vinegar or pepperxnust be used on any account. A little spice 
improves them, but it must be used with care and judgment. Do not stick 
■any sharp instrument into him to see if he is becoming tender, stir him gently, 
watch the while, and you cannot fail to know when he is done. If thus treated 
you will find him very digestible, agreeing nicely with you and the children, 
and he will keep as long as you wish, unless you become careless and set him 
in too cold a place. 







"If you attempt the boiling to hurry. 
The gas only is wasted; 
But in attempting the roasting to hurry 
The food as well, isn't fit to be tasted."

One and a half pounds ground veal, J^ pound ground salt

What 23 Children Said 

THIS test was made in Denver , Colorado. 
Twenty-three children sat around the 
table. Four dishes of steaming rolled oats 
In front of each, — one of Purity, the 
other three of different brands. 

The children were asked to point out the 
dish which tasted best. By means of secret 
markings on the various dishes, — the count 
showed that 19 of the 23 chose Purity. 

Purity turns the good old breakfast cereal into 
a brand new delight. Mothers, make this test 
yourselves. Let the fresh, unspoiled tastes of 
your children decide which is the best rolled
