HERE is no part of the meal which demands more thought 
than the dessert. We are all content with the good old 
standbys for the principal courses, but with desserts it is 
different. Our hunger is partially satisfied by the time 
they appear, and we are in a more critical mood. We 
want something attractive to look at, and something that 
will gratify our sense of taste and not make too serious demands upon 
our digestion. The pies and hot puddings of our grandmother's days 
have waned in popularity, and in their places are to be found cold and 
frozen desserts. For the making of these new dishes gelatine is indis- 
pensable. It may be used in an almost endless variety of ways. It 
makes possible numberless dishes, not less delightful to the eye than 
pleasing to the palate, and opens the door to constantly new achieve- 
ments in culinary inventions. And gelatine is not limited in Its use to 
the dessert course. It does service in the making of other savory 
dishes from soup to dessert. It is a boon in the preparation of every 
part of the meal. 

Knox Sparkling Gelatine is made under the very best sanitary 
conditions and from the very best materials, and when it is made into 
jelly it produces that clear, sparkling effect which has made it so justly 
celebrated. 

It is our hope that with the aid of this little book the housewife 
will find the making of a great variety of appetizing, nourishing and 
attractive dishes easier and more pleasant. 

It must be remembered, however, that the recipes in this book are 
prepared for use with Knox Gelatine only, and to have good results 
no other gelatine can be used. 

Knox Sparkling Gelatine is endorsed by the leading Pure Food Ex- 
perts, and is used daily in homes and by domestic science teachers and 
teachers of cookery in the foremost cooking schools and hospital train- 
ing classes in the United States and Canada, and the experience of 
these people has taught them to use none but the best. 

Each package of Knox Sparkling Gelatine and Knox Acidulated 
Gelatine is sold under the positive GUARANTEE of money back if 
for any reason you are not satisfied.

Knox Sparkling Granulated Gelatine is put up in two packages. 
No. 1 is the Plain Sparkling (yellow package), and is the original, un- 
flavored, unsweetened gelatine. No. 3 is the Sparkling Acidulated 
(blue package). Both packages are alike, containing two envelopes of 
gelatine, and an envelope of Pink Vegetable Coloring for making a col- 
ored dessert, salad or icing for cake, and make the same quantity — 
TWO QUARTS of jelly. The only difference between the two packages 
is that the No. 3 Acidulated contains an envelope of Lemon Flavoring, 
which takes the place of lemon juice and affords a ready prepared 
flavoring. The flavoring and coloring are not mixed with the gelatine 
in either package, but packed in separate envelopes, thus leaving it to 
the purchasers to use them or not as they desire. With the No. 1 Plain 
package the natural fruit juices of lemons, oranges, etc., are used for 
flavoring, while with the No. 3 Acidulated (Busy Housekeeper's) pack- 
age the Lemon Flavormg is furnished in concentrated form ready for 
use. All that is added is water and sugar, and the jelly is ready to mold. 

Housekeepers will have no trouble in measuring Knox Gelatine, 
as it is already measured in two envelopes, each one making one quart 
of jelly. This makes it very convenient when less than a full package 
is to be used, and being so divided it may be used in serving a small 
family as well as a large party.

QUANTITY OF LIQUID JELLIED BY A PACKAGE OF 
KNOX SPARKLING GELATINE 

Each package of Knox Gelatine makes TWO QUARTS of jelly — 
FOUR TIMES as much as the ready prepared packages on the market 
that make but one pint. That is why Knox Gelatine is so economical. 

In the summer, however, and especially if the dish is to be served 
within two hours after molding, it is advisable to decrease slightly the 
quantity of liquid. In making aspic jelly, for molding meat, fish, and 
salad, where heavy materials are to be held up, one package of Knox 
Sparkling Gelatine will be required for each five cups of liquid. Re- 
member that a package (two envelopes) of Knox Sparkling Gelatine 
will jell two quarts of liquid, one-half package (one envelope) one quart, 
and one-fourth package (one-half envelope) one pint. In trying a new 
recipe, estimate the full quantity of liquid required by the recipe, and 
see that the quantity of gelatine is proportioned correctly. 

TO MOLD AND UNMOLD GELATINE MIXTURES QUICKLY 

By the use of crushed ice and rock salt, jelly made with Knox 
Gelatine may be molded at any season in one hour. When ice and salt 
are not at hand, set the dish containing the gelatine mixture in cold 
water, or in salt and water. In winter the mold may be packed in snow, 
or covered and set out of doors. 

To unmold, immerse the mold to the top in warm — not hot — water; 
then slightly loosen the jelly at the edge, turning the mold meanwhile 
from side to side, then place serving dish on top of mold and invert and 
carefully remove the mold. A delicate jelly cannot be moved easily 
after it has been unmolded, so that care must be taken to place it evenly 
on the dish. If before unmolding a lace paper doily is placed evenly 
over the mold, so that when inverted the doily is between the gelatine 
mixture and the serving dish, the jelly can be moved at will on the paper. 

CA UTION — The liquid quantities in the recipes in this book are based on Wine MeaS' 
urement (U. S. Standard) and are correct. However, when using the Imperial or Metric 
System, a quart of which measures more than one quart Wine Measure, this should he 
taken into consideration and less water or more gelatine used. 





LAYING THE TABLE FOR DINNER OR LUNCHEON 

Lay a plate for each person. At the right of the plate place an 
oyster fork, soup spoon and knives in the order of use, the one first used 
farthest from the plate. At the left of the plate lay the forks, in order 
of use, the one first used farthest from the plate. Have the tines of the 
forks and the bowls of the spoons turned upward, and the cutting edges 
of the knives toward the plate. 

Place the napkin, folded, at the left of the forks; or, when soup is 
served, if desired, the napkin may be folded and placed on the plate 
with a roll or small piece of bread partly folded within it. Set the 
glass for water above the knife. If wine glasses are to be used, set 
the glass for water above the plate and near the center of the cover, 
and set the wine glasses to the right in a half circle, the one to be first 
used the farthest to the right and nearest the hand. 




SEATING GUESTS AT TABLE 

The success of a formal dinner depends greatly upon the selection 
of the guests and the order in which they are seated at the table. 

The host and hostess should sit directly opposite each other. The 
ladies and gentlemen should sit in alternate seats between the host and 
hostess. The alternate arrangement may be followed with six or ten 
persons, but not when eight or twelve are present. 

When dinner is announced the host should enter the dining room 
with the guest of honor. Then the men guests should escort the ladies 
into the room. The hostess with the man guest of honor should be the 
last to enter. The guests should stand back of their chairs until the 
hostess is seated, and each man should adjust the chair for the lady he 
is escorting and see that she is comfortably seated before he takes his 
place at her side. 

SERVING FORMAL MEALS 

Meals are served either from the dining table or by waitress or 
butler from the serving table and pantry. The custom now is to have 
the dishes passed to each guest, the meats, etc., being carved into 
convenient size for the purpose. They are passed to the left of the 
guests. All dishes, glasses, etc., not again required on the table should 
be removed from the left when the next course is served. 

SERVING THE SALAD 

Salad, served with the roast or game (on small chilled plates), is 
eaten with the fork provided for that course. A salad fork is supplied 
for a salad served as a separate course. This is placed when the table 
is laid, according to the position of the salad in the menu, or just before 
the salad is passed. 

SERVING THE DESSERT 

For the dessert course, spoons or forks are usually supplied when 
the table is set, or if one prefers they may be placed for this course after 
the table has been cleared. They are laid at the right of the space to 
be occupied by the plate. When serving the dessert with but one 
maid in attendance, and empty plates or plates with finger bowls are 
to be set before the guests, and the dessert to be brought in afterwards, 
place the plates before the silver. If the dessert is to be brought in on 
individual plates, place the silver, then bring in the dessert.

ORANGE JELLY IN SECTIONS OF ORANGE PEEL {Illustrated on page 38) 

i teaspoonful Knox Sparkling Gelatine. | cup orange juice. 

I tablespoonful cold water. 1 teaspoonful lemon juice. 

1 tablespoonful boiling water. 1| tablespoonfuls sugar. 

Cut a circular piece of peel one inch in diameter from the stem end of an orange. 
Introduce handle of a silver spoon into opening thus made, and remove pulp and 
juice. Strain juice from pulp, and use in making jelly. The forefinger of the right 
hand may be of assistance in loosenmg pulp lying close to skin, which should be 
discarded, as it is apt to make a cloudy jelly. Proceed same as in making Lemon 
Jelly. Fill orange with mixture, place in pan, and surround with ice to which a 
small quantity of water has been added. As soon as jelly is firm, cut in halves 
lengthwise, and cut halves in thirds, arrange on serving dish on a lace paper doily, 
and garnish with glac^d cherry. 

KNOX MAYONNAISE DRESSING 

1 teaspoonful Knox Sparkling Gelatine, Yolks of two eggs. 

1 teaspoonful mustard, if liked. 4 tablespoonfuls Lemon Juice. 

1 teaspoonful salt. Few grains cayenne. 2 cups olive oil. 

Mix mustard, salt, sugar and cayenne. Add egg yolks, and when well mixed 
one-half teaspoonful Lemon Juice; then add gelatine, soaked in one-half tablespoon- 
ful Lemon Juice five minutes, and dissolved over boiling water. Cool, and add oil 
gradually, at first drop by drop, and stir constantly. As mixture thickens, thin 
with remaining lemon juice. Add oil and lemon juice alternately, until all is used, 
stirring or beating constantly. If oil is added too rapidly, dressing will have a cur- 
dled appearance. Olive oil for the making of mayonnaise should be thoroughly 
chilled. Mayonnaise should be stiff enough to hold its shape. 

NOTE — If preferred, mild vinegar may be used in place of the lemon juice. A little 
garlic or onion and a teaspoonful of curry powder may be mixed with the dressing to give 
an added flavor. A small amount of Knox Gelatine added to a cooked dressing improves 
it and makes it stand up firm and hard. 

BUTTER MIXTURE 

NOTE — This mixture is intended for immediate use, and will do the work of two 
pounds of ordinary butter for table use and for baking cakes, muffins, etc., but is not 
used for frying purposes, 

1 pound good butter. 1 heaping teaspoonful Knox Gelatine. 

2 pint bottles milk or one quart. 2 teaspoonfuls salt. 

Take the top cream of two pint bottles of milk, and add enough of the milk 
to make one pint. 

Soak the gelatine in two tablespoonfuls of the milk ten minutes; place in a 
dish of hot water until gelatine is thoroughly dissolved. 

Cut the butter in small pieces and place same in a dish over hot water until 
the butter begins to soften; then gradually whip the milk and cream and dissolved 
gelatine into the butter with a Dover egg beater. After the milk is thoroughly 
beaten into the butter add the salt to taste. 

If the milk forms keep on beating until all is mixed in. Place on ice or in a 
cool place until hard. If a yellow color is desired, use butter coloring. 

CREAM FILLING FOR CAKE 
i envelope Knox Sparkling Gelatine. 1 teaspoonful vanilla, or 
i cup sugar. § teaspoonful lemon extract. 

i teaspoonful salt. 2 cups scalded milk. 

2 eggs. J cup cold milk. 

Mix sugar and salt, add egg, slightly beaten, and pour gradually on scalded milk. 
Cook in double boiler, stirring constantly, until mixture coats the spoon. Add 
gelatine soaked in cold milk five minutes, and flavoring. 

COFFEE CREAM FILLING 

Make same as Cream Filling, scalding the milk with two tablespoonfuls ground 
coffee, and straining before adding sugar, salt and eggs. 



1 tablespoonful tarragon vinegar. 

1 teaspoonful chives, cut in very small 
pieces. 

2 teaspoonfuls cold water. 



RUSSIAN SANDWICHES 

Cut bread in one-fourth inch slices, and shape with a fancy cutter. Place one 
or two small crisp lettuce leaves on one-half the pieces, spread with Russian dressing, 
cover with remaining pieces of bread, and garnish top of each with one-half pecan 
nut meat. Arrange on a sandwich plate, covered with a doily, radiating from center. 
Garnish at center with a few crisp lettuce leaves, to represent a flower, and sprigs

2 teaspoonfuls cold water. Confectioners' sugar. 
6 tablespoonfuls hot milk. 1 teaspoonful vanilla. 

Soak gelatine in cold water five minutes, and dissolve in hot milk; then add 
butter. Stir in sugar until mixture is of the right consistency to spread (the amount 
required being about two and three-fourths cups), and add vanilla. 

WHIPPED CREAM 

1 teaspoonful Knox Sparkling Gelatine, f cup powdered sugar. 
1 tablespoonful cold water. 1 teaspoonful vanilla. 

1^ cups heavy cream. Few grains salt.

add to each pint a level tablespoonful Knox Sparkling Gelatine that has been soft- 
ened five minutes in one-fourth cup cold water. Heat to the boiling point, skim 
and strain into the glasses. 

IN SOUPS AND GRAVIES 

Soups and gravies are much better if gelatine is used in them, 
a thin soup stock it will make a rich, nourishing soup.
