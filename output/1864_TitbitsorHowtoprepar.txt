INTRODUCTION 



IN presenting this book to the public the compiler 
wishes it to be understood that it is not designed to 
supersede any of the valuable " Cook Books " already 
in the market, but as an accompaniment to them ; 
being intended to fill a place which is not yet filled. 

The universal cry among the less wealthy classes 
is, " We can do nothing with Cook Books, the receipts 
are so extravagant ! y 

For the last twenty years the writer has been col- 
lecting receipts for her own private use. 

Many of these were so valuable, combining economy 
with excellence, she was constantly giving them to her 
friends. One lady remarked that one single receipt 
given her was worth five dollars to her. 

A year or two since a friend suggested that these 
receipts should be given to the public, and that as 
many new ones as possible should be gleaned from 
private sources and added to those already in pos- 
session. 

A large majority of cake receipts are for common 



6 INTRODUCTION. 

use, and made by cup measure, to avoid the trouble 
of weighing. 

A small space is given to meats, it being deemed 
unnecessary to fill the book with receipts for plain 
cooking, which it is to be supposed all housekeepers 
are familiar with, and thereby make it a more costly 
one. Two of the receipts are from the Washington 
family in Virginia ; a number from the private manu- 
script of a deceased relative, collected with great care ; 
but the large majority are from the stray leaves of 
friends, who love a nice dish, and have found a way 
to prepare it, without spending all their substance in 
riotous living. 



TIT-BITS 



PART FIRST, 
MEATS. BEEF. 

To Select Beef. 

Nice beef may be known by its color ; the fat will be 
of oily smoothness, and incline to white, rather than 
yellow, while the lean will be of an open grain, bright 
red. Yellow fat is a sure sign of an inferior quality. 

Spiced Beefl 

Cover a round of beef, weighing about sixteen pounds, 
with a pound of salt, and turn it every day for a week. 

At the end of that time, wash it in cold water, rub it 
well with two ounces of black pepper and quarter of an 
ounce of mace. 

Fry three or four onions sliced, add a few cloves, then 
put in the meat, cover it with water, and bake in a stone- 
covered stewing pan for five hours. 

To be eaten cold, for breakfast or supper. 

Beef Steak (Ste^ved). 

Take a steak a little more than an inch thick, fry it to 
a light brown, with two or three sliced onions. After it 

(7) 



8 MEATS. 

is fried, put it in a stewpan, with a turnip cut up small, 
and carrot also, if you fancy, a little celery, salt, and 
pepper ; cover it with water, and stew gently for two 
hours. It is said to be very delicious. 

Beef" Heart. 

"Wash it carefully, and stuff it nicely ; roast or bake 
it, and serve with the gravy, which should be thickened 
with some of the stuffing. It is very nice hashed, with a 
little port wine added. 



-AJLamocle 

Make a stuffing of rich herbs, spice, suet, and stuff 
the beef with it ; one and a half bottles of port or 
claret wine, according to the size of the beef, and five 
quarts of water. Do not let it boil, but simmer until 
it is done. 

Bouilli. 

To a tender piece of beef, about ten pounds, put three 
pints of water, a little pepper, salt, and an onion. Boil 
the beef gently for three or four hours ; the beef should 
be turned, and the water renewed as it boils away. 
Crumbs of bread should be put in to thicken the gravy. 

About half an hour before it is to be taken up*, the 
fat should be carefully skimmed off, then a little cabbage, 
carrots, turnips, and celery, cut small, are to be put in, 
and boiled till quite tender. 



Beeft 

The brisket is the best. A piece of eight pounds will 
require four hours slow boiling. Put it into cold water, 
and take off the scum as it rises ; the slower it boils the 



MEATS. 9 

better. The liquor which the beef is boiled in is very 
nice for gravies and soups, and should be saved for that 
purpose. 

Boileau.. 

Take a piece of beef, weighing six or eight pounds ; 
have the bone taken out, then rub it well with a mixture 
composed of ground cloves, allspice, black pepper, sweet 
marjoram, and salt, one spoonful of each, rubbed fine. 

After the mixture is well rubbed in, roll it up tightly 
and tie it ; put it into a pot half full of water, with three 
or four potatoes, a carrot, two turnips, if small, and two 
onions, and let it stew for six hours. 

Beef Stew. 

Take a pound and a half of nice beef, and cut it into 
small pieces. 

Place in the bottom of your saucepan a layer of sliced 
potatoes, a few slices of onion, a pinch of pepper, one of 
salt ; then a layer of meat, another layer of potatoes, 
onions, salt, and pepper, with a layer of meat, and con- 
tinue in this way till you have disposed of all of your 
meat ; let the top layer be of potatoes, onions, and season- 
ing. Cover all with water, and let it stew for an hour 
and a half. 

Beef" Tongue. 

If it is corned, it should be soaked for twenty-four 
hours before boiling. 

It will require from three to four hours, according to 
size. The skin should always be removed as soon as it 
is taken from the pot. An economical method is to lay 
the tongue, as soon as the skin is removed, in a jar, 



10 MEATS. 

coiled up, with the tip outside the root, and a weight 
upon it. When it is cold, loosen the sides, with a knife, 
and turn it out. The slices being cut horizontally all 
round, the fat and lean will go together. 

StuiTed Beefsteak. 

Take a rump steak about an inch thick. Make a stuff- 
ing of bread, herbs, &c., and spread it over the steak. 
Roll it up, and with a needle and coarse thread sew it 
together. Lay it in an iron pot on one or two wooden 
skewers, and put in water just sufficient to cover it. Let 
it stew slowly for two hours ; longer if the beef is tough ; 
serve it in a dish with the gravy turned over it. To be 
carved crosswise, in slices, through beef and stuffing. 



Take a shin of beef from the hind quarter, saw it into 
four pieces, put it in a pot, and boil it until the meat 
and gristle drop from the bones ; chop the meat very fine, 
put it in a dish, and season it with a little salt, pepper, 
clove, and sage, to your taste ; pour in the liquor, in which 
the meat was boiled, and place it away to harden. 

Cut in slices and eaten cold. 



PORK. 

To Select Pork. 

In fresh pork the flesh is firm, smooth, a clear color, 
and the fat set. Dairy fed pork bears the palm over all 
others. In young pork, the lean, when pinched, will break. 

Excellent bacon may be known by the lean being ten- 
der and of a bright color, the fat firm and white, yet 



MEATS. 11 

bearing a pale rose tinge, the rind thin, and the lean 
tender to the touch. Rusty bacon has yellow streaks in 
it. The test of a sweet ham is to pass a sharp knife to 
the bone, and when drawn out smell it ; if the knife is 
daubed greasy, and the scent disagreeable, it is bad. 

Ooimed Pork. 

It should be soaked a few hours before boiling, then 
well washed and scraped, and put into a fresh water. It 
must not be boiled fast, but put into cold water, and 
gradually warmed through ; skim frequently while boiling. 

A leg or shoulder, weighing seven or eight pounds, 
should boil slowly for four hours. When taken up it 
must be skinned carefully, though some prefer the skin 
remaining on, as it loses much of the juice by skinning. 

It is very nice cold. 

\ 

To Fricassee Pork. 

Cut a small sparerib or chine of pork into pieces, 
cover with water and stew until tender ; remove the 
meat, and flavor the gravy with salt, pepper, and thicken 
with a little flour. Serve in a deep dish, in the gravy, 
and garnish the dish with rice. 

Pork Pie. 

Prepare your pork as above, or take any nice bits of 
cold roast pork. Line a deep dish with paste, fill in with 
the meat, pour the gravy over it, and cover all with the 
paste ; make a small hole in the middle of the paste, and 
bake until nicely browned. 



Feet. 

Boil four pig's feet until the bones drop out. Draw 
out the long bone and place them in a dish to cool. 



12 MEATS. 



Split each foot, take the liquor in which it is boiled, add 
the juice of a lemon and some salt, and turn over the 
feet. They may be dipped in batter, and fried in salt 
pork. 



Head. 

Have the head nicely cleaned, and boil it till very ten- 
der. Chop it very fine, and season with salt, pepper, 
sage, and a little clove, while hot. Put in a deep dish, 
and cover with a plate that is smaller than the dish, that 
it may rest on the meat. Place on the plate a very heavy 
weight, and let it stand for twenty-four hours. This 
makes the famous " Pig's Head Cheese." 



VEAL. 

To Select Veal. 

When the kidney is well surrounded with fat, you 
may be sure the meat is of good quality. Always 
choose that which is whitest and fattest. 

If the vein in the shoulder, which is very perceptible, 
is a bright red or blue, it is a sure sign that the meat 
is fresh. 



Knuckle of* "Veal 

Break the bone in two or three places, put to it five 
pints of water, some sweet herbs, whole black peppers, a 
little salt and mace. 

When the meat is done, take it out with the herbs and 
spices, and thicken the liquor with a little flour, and boil 
it up well ; then put back the meat, add two glasses of 
Madeira wine, and the juice of a lemon. Let it come 



MEATS. 13 

to a boil, but be careful that it does not burn. It is 
much more apt to after the flour is added. 

To I^oast a billet of* Veal. 

Make a stuffing of a little beef suet, chopped fine, the 
same quantity of bread crumbs, a little sweet marjoram, 
the rind of two lemons, grated, a table spoonful of grated 
horseradish, a little pepper and salt ; if you please, add 
the yolks of two hard boiled eggs, cut up fine. 

Introduce the stuffing through the fillet, secure it with 
skewers and twine ; baste it well while it is roasting, and 
make a gravy of the drippings, thickened with flour. 



"Veal 

Take two or three fresh sweetbreads, parboil them for 
a few minutes, then take them from the hot water, and 
put them into cold. Take some bread crumbs, and add 
the yolks of two eggs, well beaten, to the crumbs. 

When the sweetbreads are perfectly cold, place them 
on a skewer, and roll them in the prepared crumbs, lay 
them in a stew-pan with a small bit of butter and a lit- 
tle veal gravy, and cook them a nice brown. 

Take the gravy in which they are cooked, add the 
juice of a lemon, a little salt and pepper ; toast some 
slices of bread, dip them into the gravy, and lay the 
sweetbreads on. 



HCead. 

Let the butcher split the head in halves. Take out 
the eyes and the snout bone ; then lay it in cold water, to 
soak two hours before boiling ; take out the brains, and 
wash them well in several waters, then lay them in cold 
water. Put the head together, and lay it in a good sized 



14 MEATS. 

pot, cover it with cold water, and throw in a table 
spoonful of salt. Let it boil slowly for two hours and a 
half, or three hours, according to size. 

When it has boiled a little more than an hour, take 
some of the liquor, about a quart, and put into a stew- 
pan for the gravy ; add to this liquor some salt, pepper, 
a little parsley chopped fine, a table spoonful of lemon 
pickle, and put over the fire to boil. 

Beat up an egg lightly, with two table spoonfuls of 
flour, then remove carefully the skin from the brains, 
and beat them up with the egg ^nd flour. When well 
beaten, thicken the gravy with it, and stew about ten 
minutes. 



Calf s Live*-, 

Cut the liver into small slices, about three inches 
square. ^Into your sauce-pan place two onions, sliced 
fine, a ta.ble spoonful of sage, one of summer savory, 
a little pepper and salt ; then add your liver, and cover 
with water, and let it stew for two hours. Just be- 
fore you serve it, dredge on a little flour, and add a 
table spoonful of butter. 



Broth. 

Pick and wash a tea cup of rice, and put into your 
dinner pot ; cut up three or four small onions, and add 
to the rice ; next, add your meat, which should be cut 
in pieces of about a quarter of a pound each ; let the 
whole be covered with water from two to three inches 
above the meat. When it has boiled an hour, add a 
few small turnips and carrots, sliced, with a table spoon- 
ful of salt ; a little before it is served add some parsley. 
This is a favorite broth with many people. It is very 



MEATS. 15 



nice without the carrots. Some prefer it thickened with 
flour instead of rice. 



!Rag-oTit of Oolcl 

Cut the veal into slices ; put a large piece of butter 
into a frying-pan, and as soon as it is hot, dredge the 
meat well with flour, and fry a nice brown. Remove the 
meat, and put into the pan as much of your cold gravy as 
you think proper, season with pepper and salt, and a 
wine glass of tomato ketchup ; then cut a few slices of 
cold ham, lay into the gravy, and add your slices of veal. 
It must be sent to the table hot. 

To Dress Oalf s Head lilce Turtle. 

Let them boil an hour and a half, with salt in the 
water ; tie the brains in a cloth bag, and boil half an hour ; 
when all is done, take out the bones and cut up in pieces. 
Add to your liquor a litt" sweet marjoram, a nutmeg, 
grated, clove, mace, and pepper, to taste, half a pint of 
ketchup, half a pound of butter, and a pint of claret, or 
port wine ; then put in the meat, and boil a few minutes, 
and it is done. 

Salem Forced IMeat Balls. 

Take a piece of veal and an equal quantity of salt 
pork, chop them together fine ; pound two hard crackers, 
and add to it a little salt, sweet marjoram, pepper, and 
nutmeg ; mix together well ; flour the hands, and roll 
into little balls ; fry them in butter. Very nice, if added 
to the mock turtle soup. 



Oalfs Liver. 

Put the heart and harslet on to cook in just water 
enough to cover them. Put the liver, in the mean time, 



16 MEATS. 

in cold water, with a little vinegar and salt ; slice up two 
onions, and boil with the heart and harslet for half an 
hour, skim it well, then strain off the liquor. Put a 
little summer savory, with a fresh sliced lemon in the 
bottom of the stew-pan, and on this place the liver, 
(which must be cut into square pieces, of about three 
inches square), pour over it the gravy made by the 
heart and harslet, put in about a dozen allspice, six or 
eight cloves ; let it simmer slowly, tightly covered, for an 
hour and a half, then pour off the gravy and mix with it 
a large spoonful of flour ; when smooth, stir it into the 
gravy, pour it into the sauce-pan, add a wine glass of 
tomato or mushroom ketchup, let it simmer for live 
minutes. Take up the liver, pour over it part of the 
gravy, and the remainder put into your gravy boat. 
This is a very nice dish if carefully prepared. 



MUTTON AND LAMB. 

The best mutton is of a fine grain, the fat firm and 
white. 

Lamb should be eaten very fresh. In the fore quarter, 
the vein in the neck being any other color than blue, 
betrays it to be stale. 

Siionlcler of" M/utton. 

Take out the bone, and fill the space with a stuffing 
made of bread crumbs, salt pork, chopped fine, pepper, 
salt, and sage, or sweet marjoram. A shoulder, weigh- 
ing eight pounds, requires an hour and a half, good 
fire. 



MEATS. 17 

M/ntton a la "Venison. 

Take a fat loin, remove the kidney, and let it hang a 
week, if the weather permits. Two days before dressing 
it for cooking, take ground allspice, clove, and pepper, 
mix them, arid rub into the meat a table spoonful of each 
twice a day for two days. Before cooking, wash it off, 
and roast as a leg. To preserve the fat and keep it in, 
make a paste of flour and water, and spread thickly over 
the meat. Over this tie a double sheet of coarse paper, 
well buttered. About a quarter of an hour before it is 
done remove the paper and paste, return to the oven and 
baste, and dredge with flour. It is equal to venison. 

Mutton Kidneys. 

Take half a dozen fine mutton kidneys, clear them 
of fat and skin, and cut them into thin slices, powder 
them immediately with sweet herbs in fine powder, a 
little cayenne and salt. 

Put into a stew-pan two ounces of clarified butter or 
fresh lard ; put in the slices of kidney, and fry them 
nicely ; dredge a little flour over them, and moisten with 
lemon juice, and in five minutes they will be done ; lay 
them on a hot dish, around which are slices of fried 
bread. 

Pour into the gravy two glasses of white wine, give it 
a boil, pour over the kidneys, and serve hot. 



of M!iitton. 

Make a nice stuffing of finely-chopped beef suet, bread 
crumbs, an onion chopped finely, pepper, salt, and a little 
ground clove. Make incisions in the leg, and stuff it 
well ; tie a little bundle of basil and parsley together, 
lay in the bottom of the dinner pot, and on it place the 

2 



18 MEATS. 

mutton ; just cover with water, and stew slowly. Two 
hours steady cooking will be all that is required ; when 
tender, take out the mutton and add to the liquor a large 
spoonful of flour, made smooth with a little water, stir it 
well, and in five minutes take it off and strain it ; pour it 
back into the pot, and add a wine glass of ketchup, and 
lay the mutton in till it is served. 



of 

Boil it in water to cover it ; when half done add two 
cups of milk to the water, with a large spoonful of salt. 
It should be served with spinach and caper sauce. It 
will cook in an hour and a quarter, or half, according to 
size. 

To ITiry Lainl> Steaks. 

Dip each piece into well-beaten egg, cover with 
bread crumbs or corn meal, and fry in butter or new 
lard. Mashed potatoes and boiled rice are a necessary 
accompaniment. It is very nice to thicken the gravy 
with flour and butter, adding a little lemon juice, and 
pour it hot upon the steaks, and place the rice in spoon- 
fuls around thejiish to garnish it. 



FISH, FOWL, SOUPS, EGGS, &c. 19 



PART SECOND. 
FISH, FOWL, SOUPS, EGGS, &c. 



Wash them very clean ; make a stuffing of bits of 
salt pork, pounded biscuit, thyme, or summer savory, a 
little salt, and one or two eggs. Stuff the breasts suffi- 
ciently to make them look plump, lay them in a stew-pan 
or pot, cover them with water, add a little thyme, and 
half a pint of red wine. 

If young, two and a half hours moderate stewing is 
sufficient ; if old, three or four hours. Add more season- 
ing before you take them off, if required. 



Put into your kettle about half a pound of good butter ; 
make it quite hot, and after cutting your fish in small 
square pieces, of three or four inches in size, flour them 
and fry them brown ; take them out, and place in a deep 
dish, in a warm, not hot, oven. Add to the butter two 
double handfuls of chopped onions, fry your onions brown, 
some sweet herbs, shred fine, three table spoonfuls of 
ketchup, half a pint of red wine, a piece of butter the 
size of an egg, with pepper and salt to taste ; a tea spoon- 
ful of clove, the same of mace. If your gravy is too 
thick, add a little boiling water ; if too thin, a small piece 



20 FISH, FOWL, SOUPS, EGGS, &c. 

more butter and a little flour. When sufficiently boiled, 
pour over the fish and serve. 



lEIoilecl 

Prepare your turkey as for roasting ; put it in a cloth, 
and boil it slowly, if from, eight to nine pounds, an hour 
and a half. Throw into the water a few cloves, a little 
black pepper, sweet marjoram, and salt. It is to be 
served with oysters. 

Skim the turkey well while boiling, or it will not be 
white. 

Oyster Sauce for Tnrlceys, <&-o. 

Strain fifty oysters, put the juice into a sauce-pan, add 
one pint of new milk, let it simmer, and skim off* any 
froth which may rise ; then rub a large spoonful of flour 
and two of butter together ; stir this into the liquor ; add 
a little salt and pepper. Let it simmer five minutes, 
but do not add your oysters till just as they are to be 
sent to the table, as if they are too much cooked they are 
hard. 



Fried 

Place in your fry-kettle half a dozen slices of fat pork ; 
fry to a brown, then remove them to a deep dish ; 
add to the fat three table spoonfuls of fresh lard ; when 
boiling hot, put in your halibut, which should be cut in 
pieces about three inches square, and dipped in sifted 
meal ; sprinkle over it a little salt ; fry a good brown. 
After the fish is all fried (it may be necessary to add 
more lard if it is a large one), put it in the dish with the 
slices of pork, pour the boiling fat over it, and add one 
table spoonful of boiling water ; cover with a plate tightly, 
and stand in the oven for twenty minutes. 



FISH, FOWL, SOUPS, EGGS, &c. 21 



Boiled ITo^vl ox- 

They should be cleaned and stuffed as for roasting. A 
young fowl requires an hour ; if tough and old, three 
hours. A chicken will boil in three quarters of an hour. 
They may be served with oyster, caper, or egg sauce. 



" Sauce. 

Boil a pound of beef in water enough to cover it, with 
a slice of toasted bread. When boiled, remove it from 
the water, and add four or five anchovies, and a glass of 
claret wine, with a little clove ; boil up, and strain into 
your tureen boiling hot. 

Baltimore Tvurlce^r. 

Take out the breastbone, and cut off the legs, not the 
thigh part, of a small, fat turkey. Clean it thoroughly, 
and fill the inside with oysters sew it up, lay in a floured 
eloth, place it in cold water, and boil one hour and a 
half, very slowly ; take it out, lay on a dish, and draw 
out the thread w r ith which the turkey was sewed. Make 
a jelly of calf's feet, without sugar, but flavored with 
lemon and wine ; when cool, but not cold, pour over the 
turkey, and set it aside to jelly. 

Serve with celery. 



I?ea 

Soak a quart of split peas over night. In the morning 
add to them, a gallon of water, in which a piece of beef 
or mutton has been boiled the day previous, and strained, 
and let them boil slowly for four hours, with the addition 
of half a pound of salt pork. Strain through a sieve 
before serving, and season with salt and pepper to your 
taste. 



22 FISH, FOWL, SOUPS, EGGS, &c. 



Oysters, JTa.ii.cy 

Toast a few slices of bread, and butter them ; lay them 
in a shallow dish ; put on the liquor of the oysters to 
heat, add salt and pepper, and just before it boils add 
the oysters ; let them boil up once, and pour over the 
bread. 



Hoasit 

When cleaned and ready for roasting, fill the bird with 
a stuffing of bread crumbs, a spoonful of butter, a little 
salt and nutmeg, and three oysters to each bird (some 
prefer chopped apple). They must be well basted with 
melted butter, and -require thirty minutes careful cook- 
ing. In the autumn they are best, and should be full 

grown. 

* 

Roast Duck. 

Prepare your duck for roasting, and use the following 
stuffing : Chop fine, and throw into cold water, three 
good sized onions, one large spoonful of sage, two of 
bread crumbs, a piece of butter the size of a walnut, a 
little salt and pepper, and the onions drained. Mix well 
together, and stuff the duck. 

An hour is enough for an ordinary sized duck. The 
gravy is made by straining the drippings ; skim off the 
fat, then stir in a large spoonful of browned flour, a tea 
spoonful of mixed mustard, a wine glass of claret. Sim- 
mer for ten minutes. 

ITorceiiieat Balls. 

Take one pound of tender lean beef, and half a pound 
of nice beef suet, chopped very finely, the crumbs of a 
stale loaf of bread, soaked in cold water for a few ino- 



FISH, FOWL, SOUPS, EGGS, &c. 23 

merits, and squeezed very dry, the grated rind and juice 
of a lemon, half a tea spoonful of ginger, the same of salt 
and summer savory, with a little cayenne. Mix well 
together, and add the yolks of three eggs, well beaten. 
Divide in halves ; put one half in a stew-pan, with a 
wine glass of ketchup ; stew half an hour. The other 
half make into balls, the size of a walnut, and fry brown. 
Place round the dish in which the stew is served. 

Cream. Baked Trout. 

Clean the trout, put in pepper and salt, and close them. 
Place the fish in the pan, with just cream enough to 
cover the fins, and bake fifteen minutes. 



Tomato 

Put on a piece of beef, mutton, or lamb, to boil ; skim 
off all the fat before seasoning, then add two sliced 
.onions, a little pepper and salt, two cloves, and about a 
dozen tomatoes ; boil three hours, then add a little thick- 
ening of flour. If the tomatoes are very sour, add a 
table spoonful of sugar. 



Take a fresh haddock, of three or four pounds, clean 
it well, and cut in pieces of three inches square. Place 
in the bottom of your dinner-pot five or six slices of salt 
pork, fry brown, then add three onions sliced thin, and 
fry those brown. Remove the kettle from the fire, and 
place on the onions and pork a layer of fish ; sprinkle 
over a little pepper and salt, then a layer of pared and 
sliced potatoes, a layer of fish and potatoes, till the fish is 
used up. Cover with water, and let it boil for half an 
hour. Pound six biscuits or crackers fine as meal, and 



24 FISH, FOWL, SOUPS, EGGS, &c. 

pour into the pot ; and, lastly, add a quart or pint of 
milk ; let it scald well, and serve. 



Break six eggs, leaving out the whites ; put them in a 
cold place until required. Add to the yolks a little 
powdered sugar, the peel and juice of half a small lemon, 
a little nutmeg, and beat all together ; add four table 
spoonfuls of cream ; beat up the six whites stiff. Put a 
piece of butter in your pan, upon a slow fire ; when hot 
pour in the omelet, mix in the whites gently, turn it on 
your dish, glaze with pounded sugar, put in the oven for 
a few minutes, and send to the table hot. 



Pare two pounds of potatoes, cover them with hot 
water, and. let them simmer till done; mash them, and 
add a little cream and salt ; lay them in the style of paste 
in a dish ; place on thin slices of underdone meat, either 
mutton, beef, or veal ; lay them in thickly ; pour over 
them some gravy, a wine glass of ketchup, then cover 
thick with mashed potatoes, and bake moderately for 
about forty minutes. 

Baked Oodiisli. 

Clean the fish inside and out : flour it ; make a stuff- 

<* 

ing of bread crumbs, bits of salt pork, sage, and one egg. 
Stuff the fish well, put on one or two slices of pork, and 
bake a nice brown. To be eaten .with egg or caper 
sauce. 

Boiled Ham. 

Boil in a large pot, giving it plenty of room and enough 
of water ; let it be an hour coming to a boil. A ham of 



FISH, FOWL, SOUPS, EGGS, &c. 25 

fifteen pounds requires three hours steady boiling. It 
should then be taken from the pot, the skin removed, and 
fine pounded cracker sifted thickly over the top ; put in 
the oven and baked from one hour to an hour and a half. 
Many people prefer the ham boiled only ; in the latter 
case it should boil, if the above size, for five hours, and 
remain fifteen minutes in the pot after the pot is removed 
from the fire. 

Ohiolcen. Fie. 

Cut the chicken in pieces, and parboil for three quar- 
ters of an hour. Remove the chicken, and add to the 
water in which it is boiled a little salt, pepper, and a tea 
cup of milk thickened with a table spoonful of flour. Line 
a deep dish w r ith nice paste, put in the chicken, and turn 
over it the gravy which you have prepared. Cover it 
with paste immediately, make a small hole in the centre, 
ornament with strips of paste, and bake for forty-five 
minutes. 

Boiled. Salmon. 

A piece of six pounds should be rubbed with salt, tied 
carefully in a cloth, and boil slowly for three quarters of 
an hour. It should be eaten with egg or caper sauce. 
If any remains after dinner, it may be placed in a deep 
dish, a little salt sprinkled over, and a tea cup of boiling 
vinegar poured upon it. Cover it closely, and it will 
make a nice breakfast dish. 



The eggs should be fresh. Have the boiling water in 
a shallow pan, break the eggs separately in a saucer, and 
slip gently into the boiling water ; when all are in the 



26 FISH, FOWL, SOUPS, EGGS, &c. 

water, place the pan over the fire, until the white of each 
is perfectly set ; remove with a slicer, and lay on buttered 
toast or broiled ham. 



Veal. 

Break the shank bone, wash it clean, and put into two 
quarts of water an onion peeled, a few blades of mace, 
and a little salt ; set it over a quick fire, and remove the 
scum as it rises. Wash carefully a quarter of a pound 
of rice, and when the veal has cooked for about an hour 
skim it well and throw in the rice. Simmer for three 
quarters of an hour slowly. When done put the meat in 
a deep dish, and the rice around it. Mix a little drawn 
butter, stir in some chopped parsley, and pour over the 
veal. 



Clean and wash the fish with care, and wipe it perfectly 
dry ; put into a stew-pan two table spoonfuls of butter, 
dredge in as it melts a little flour, grate half a nutmeg, 
a few blades of mace, a little cayenne, and a tea spoon- 
ful of salt ; mix it all together, then lay in the fish, let 
it brown slightly ; pour over some veal gravy, a lemon 
thinly sliced, stew very slowly for forty minutes, take 
out the fish, and add two glasses of wine to the gravy. 
Lay the fish on a hot dish, and pour over it some of the 
gravy. Serve the rest in a sauce tureen. 

Scolloped Ousters. 

Line a pudding dish with bread crumbs, put in a layer 
of oysters, a pinch of salt and pepper, and a dozen small 
bits of butter, next a layer of bread crumbs, then a layer 
of oysters, and a layer of cracker crumbs, with pepper, 



FISH, FOWL, SOUPS, EGGS, &c. 27 

butter, and salt, as before ; a layer of oysters, and so on, 
using every other layer, cracker pounded fine, instead of 
bread crumbs. Lastly strain the liquor, and pour over 
the whole, and bake ; if there is not enough liquor to wet 
it thoroughly, use a little milk. 



Ousters. 

Strain the oysters, and put the juice in a sauce-pan on 
the fire ; add a large spoonful of butter and the same of 
flour, well braided together ; add a cup of cream if you 
have it, if not, milk, a little salt and nutmeg ; stir into 
the hot juice, and let it simmer for five minutes. Squeeze 
over the oysters the juice of a lemon, and just before 
they are required for table throw them into the boiling 
juice. 

Oysters are very nice flavored with celery ; this is 
done by cutting the celery stalks into the juice instead 
of the spice, and taken out before the oysters are added. 



Put the juice into a sauce-pan and let it simmer, skim- 
ming it carefully, then rub the yolks of three hard boiled 
eggs and one large spoonful of flour well together, and 
stir into the juice. Cut in small pieces quarter of a 
pound of butter, half a tea spoonful of whole allspice, a 
little salt, a little cayenne, and the juice of a fresh lemon ; 
let all simmer ten minutes, and just before dishing add 
the oysters. This is for two quarts of oysters. 



a, la IMocle (ver^r nice). 

Remove the skin from a dozen tomatoes, medium 
size, cut them up in a sauce-pan, add a little butter, 
pepper, and salt ; when sufficiently boiled, beat up five 



28 FISH, FOWL, SOUPS, EGGS, &c. 

or six eggs, and just before you serve turn them into the 
sauce-pan, with the tomato, and stir one way for two 
minutes, allowing them time to be well done. 

Griiiral>o 5 (a farvorite Soirtlieim. Dish). 

Cut up a pair of good sized chickens, as fora fricassee, 
flour them well, and put into a pan with a good sized 
piece of butter, and fry a nice brown, then lay them in a 
soup pot, pour on three quarts of hot water, and let them 
simmer slowly for two hours. Braid a little flour and 
butter together for a thickening, and stir in a little pepper 
and salt. Strain a quart or three pints of oysters, and 
add the juice to the soup. Next add four or five slices 
of cold boiled ham, and let all boil slowly together for 
ten minutes. Just before you take up the soup, stir in 
two large spoonfuls of finely powdered sassafras leaves, 
and let it simmer five minutes, then add your oysters. 
If you have no ham, it is very nice without it. Serve in 
a deep dish, and garnish tlie dish w r ith rice. 



Boil a pair of chickens with great care, skimming 
constantly, and keeping them covered with water. When 
tender, take out the chicken and remove every bone from 
the meat ; put a large lump of butter into a frying-pan, 
and dredge the chicken meat well with flour, lay in the 
hot pan ; fry a nice brown, and keep it hot and dry. 
Take a pint of the chicken water, and stir in two large 
spoonfuls of curry powder, two of butter, and one of 
flour, one tea spoonful of salt and a little cayenne ; stir 
until smooth, then mix it with the broth in the pot ; when 
well mixed, simmer five minutes, then add the browned 
chicken. Serve with rice.

32 PICKLES, KETCHUP, &c. 



I3ostoii. Oolcl

dressing : The yolks of two eggs, a little sweet oil, a 
good pinch of salt, two tea spoonfuls of mustard flour, a 
bit of pepper, mixed together thoroughly, then stir into 
it gradually half a pint of vinegar, and turn over it as it 
goes to the table. 

Oliicken Oelery. 

Chop the remains of chicken or turkey, and mix with 
it an equal proportion of celery, a little salt and vinegar 
only, although some like a dressing as for slaw, but this 
takes away too much of the celery taste. It may be 
prepared with lettuce instead of celery. 

Tomato !etelru/p.

Salad. 

May be made as chicken salad, and dressed, if you like, 
as slaw. Some people stew the meat and serve hot. 
The best way is to remove from the shell, being sure to 
remove the poison vein, which may be found in the body 
of the creature, by drawing a sharp knife gently through 
the middle of the back lengthwise, not cutting entirely 
through, but open the gash with the fingers, when a single 
black or dark-colored vein may be seen, which must be 
removed, and then the meat will be perfectly harmless. 
Arrange the meat handsomely on a dish, decorating with 
small claws, and let each one dress according to fancy. 

Tomatoes ITriecl (very nice). 

Do not pare them, but cut in slices, as an apple ; dip in 
cracker, pounded and sifted, and fry in a little good butter. 



Maryland Oold. 

Lay the cabbage in halves into cold water for one hour ; 
shave down the head into small slips with a sharp knife. 
Put in a sauce-pan a cup of vinegar, and let it boil ; then 
add a cup of cream, with the yolks of two eggs, well 
beaten ; let these boil up, and pour over the cabbage. As 
soon as the cabbage is cut, and before the vinegar, &c., is 
poured on, it should be sprinkled with a little salt and 
pepper.

!M:rs. Hunter's Holls. 

Into three pints of flour, rub a little butter ; add three 
eggs, half a pint of yeast, and a sufficiency of warm milk 
to mix these ingredients well. Make it in the evening for 
next morning's breakfast. 



Biscuits. 

Into a quart of flour, rub one table spoonful of lard and 
one of butter, with two tea spoons of cream of tartar. 
Dissolve a tea spoon of soda, and one and a half of salt 
in half pint of water, and if this will not wet the flour 
sufficiently add a little more cold water ; roll it out, 
handling as little as possible, and cut with a tin into 
rounds. Bake in a quick oven, quarter of an hour 
should bake them. Everything depends on a quick oven. 
Many use milk instead of water, but if made and baked 
properly water is nice enough to render them fit for any 
epicure. 



Sour IMCiHc Biscuits. 

To be made as the above, with the exception sour milk 
is used in the place of cream of tartar, and the soda is 
dissolved in the milk. Tea spoon of soda to a pint of sour 
milk.

salt, steamed four hours. Brown lightly in the oven 
afterwards. 

Mrs. ITalbens' Economy- Oalces. 

Rusked bread, or that which is old and sour, can be 
made into very nice fritters. The bread should be cut in 
small pieces, and soaked in cold water till very soft. 
Drain off the water and mash the bread fine. 

To three pints of bread thus prepared, add two eggs, 
four table spoonfuls of flour, a little salt, one tea spoon of 
soda in a cup of milk, which must be stirred into the 
bread, and a little more milk added, until thin enough to 
fry. 

Muffins. 

Mix a quart of flour with a pint and a half of luke- 
warm milk, half a cup of yeast, two eggs, tea spoon 
of salt, two table spoonfuls of lukewarm melted butter, 
set it in a warm place and let it rise. Butter cups, and

then remove the skin, and mash them perfectly smooth, 
with a spoonful of butter and a little salt ; add the yolks 
of three eggs, well beaten, and stir into the potatoes, then 
add one pint and a half of milk, and a large spoonful of 
yeast ; beat in flour enough to make a stiff dough ; set it 
to rise, and when risen make it into cakes the size of an 
egg ; let them rise again, and bake a light brown. 

Potato Thread. 

Sift four pounds of flour into a pan ; boil one pound of 
potatoes, skin, and mash them very carefully through the 
cullender ; mix this with equal quantities of milk and 
water, stir with a knife, add a table spoon of salt, and beat 
well ; a cup of yeast. 



Take one quart of dough from the bread at an early 
hour in the morning ; break three eggs, separating yolks 
and whites, both to be whipped to a light froth ; mix them 
into the dough, and gradually add milk- warm water, until 
it is a batter the consistency of buckwheat cakes ; beat it 
well, and let it rise till breakfast time. Have the griddle 
hot and nicely greased ; pour on the batter in small round 
cakes, and bake a light brown. 



s Bread. 

Take two quarts of flour, put before the fire to dry ; 
make a hole in the middle, and put in half a pint of yeast ;

meal, three of flour with two tea spoons cream tartar, mix 
well, then add two table spoonfuls of molasses, tea spoon of 
salt, and a tea spoon of soda in a scant pint of water, stir 
well, and if this quantity of water does not thin the bat- 
ter sufficiently, add a little more. They are very nice 
made of sour or buttermilk instead of cream tartar and 
water. They should be about as thick as the batter for 
pancakes. Grease the griddle well to prevent them from 
adhering, and fry to a nice brown. 

Very nice for breakfast or supper, and may be eaten 
with butter or syrup. 



Brcrwn. 

One quart of Indian and one quart of rye mixed well 
together ; half a cup of molasses, one table spoonful of

When dissolved wet the mixture with it, and if it does not 
thoroughly wet it, add a little more. -It should be 
nearly as stiff as bread. Bake moderately from four to 
five hours. Some people add raisins, which makes it very 
nice.

little nutmeg with the sugar on each one. The charm is 
to eat them while hot.

PUDDINGS. 



PART FIFTH. 
PUDDINGS. 

General Directions. 

If you intend to boil a pudding, always have the water 
boiling before you put in the pudding. 

Many people use a pudding cloth, kept expressly for 
the purpose, made of the thickest twilled cotton, and 
always, before using it, wash it out in clean water, and 
flour it well, before pouring in the pudding, allowing 
room for the pudding to swell according to the size 
designed. 

I much prefer the tin pudding boiler, which is hollowed 
in the centre, that the pudding may be thoroughly cooked. 
This should be well buttered before the pudding is turned 
in, which will prevent it from adhering to the boiler. 
The cover should be tied on, and a thick cloth tied 
tightly over the cover. 

All puddings in which berries are used require more 
flour than those without ; and it must be remembered 
fruit should always be added the last thing. In baking 
puddings, always be sure and butter the dish well before 
the pudding is turned in.

Boil a squash that weighs about six pounds, sift it 
through a sieve, add two quarts of milk, four eggs, well 
beaten, with three soft crackers, pounded as fine as meal. 
If the squash is watery, add another egg or a cracker as 
you prefer. Flavor with ginger or nutmeg, and sweeten 
to taste. A table spoonful of butter, while the squash is 
hot, is a great improvement. Bake in pie plates lined 
with paste. It may be baked deeper in a pudding dish, 
and is very much liked as a pudding by most people.

PART SEVENTH. 
CAKE. 



Directions for 

The flour used for making cake should always be dried 
and sifted ; always break the eggs separately in a cup. It 
is a good plan to lay the eggs, to be used, for a few hours 
in very cold water before breaking ; they whip better for 
being cold. 

When soda is used, always dissolve it before adding it 
to the general mixture. 

In. winter, soften but do not melt the butter in the milk 
used. 

Never add the fruit to cake until it is ready for baking. 

In baking cake which requires long baking, take white 
paper and lay on the sides, bottom, and top ; it is easily 
removed when the cake is done. 

To ascertain when a loaf of cake is done, take a fine 
knitting-needle and insert in the thickest part of the loaf; 
if it does not stick to the needle, the baking is finished. 

In whipping the whites of eggs, always use a shallow 
dish, and whip them in a cool place. 

Never stop after you commence until they are light, and 
whip them until you can turn the dish over without their 
slipping. 

It is better to beat the yolks and whites of eggs 
separately, except in cake that contains yeast or soda. 



CAKE. 69 

The ingredients of the cake should be -well beaten to- 
gether before the flour is mixed in, for it does not benefit 
the cake by beating after all the flour is added. 

I find by experience that the granulated sugar is purer, 
sweeter, and better in every respect for cakes and all 
pastries than brown sugar. 

The butter and sugar should always be worked to a 
cream, and the other ingredients added afterwards, the 
flour always the last. 

The cake should be turned from the tins as soon as it 
comes from the oven. It requires a much hotter oven 
for cake with soda in it, than for that which is raised 
with yeast. 



Four pounds of flour, one half pound of butter, one 
half pound of sugar, five eggs, half pint of yeast, two 
gills of wine, two tea spoons of ground allspice, one of 
clove, one of cinnamon. Beat it well. 



Oake.

chopped well, and two ounces of citron cut in rather 
small pieces.

INtRODUCTIO^. 



In presenting this book to the public the compiler 
wishes it to be understood liiat it is not designed to 
supersede any of the raluable ** Cook Books " already 
m the mfurket, but a» aQ- accompaniment to them; 
being intended to fill a place which is not jet filled. 

The universal cry among the less wealthy classes 
is, " We can do nothing with Cook Books, the receipts 
are so extravagard / " - 

For the last twenty years the writer has been col- 
lecting receipts for her own private use. 

Many of these were so valuable, combining economy 
with excellence, she was constantly giving them to her 
friends. One lady remarked that one single receipt 
given her was worth five dollars to her. 

A year or two since a Mend suggested that these 
receipts should be given to the public, and that as 
many new ones as possible should be gleaned from 
private sources and added to those already in pos- 
session. 

A large majority of cake receipts are for common 



INTKODUCTION. 

use, and made by cup measure, to avoid the trouble 
of weighing. 

A small space is given to meats, it being deemed 
unnecessary to fill the book with receipts for plain 
cooking, which it is to be supposed all housekeepers 
are familiar with, and thereby make it a more costly 
one. Two of the receipts are from the Washington 
family in Virginia; a number from the private manu- 
script of a deceased relative, collected with great care ; 
but the large majority are from the stray leaves of 
friends, who love a nice dish, and have found a way 
to prepare it, without spending all their substance in 
riotous living. 



TIT-BITS 



PART FIRST. 
MEATS. — BEEF. 

To Select Beef: 

Nice beef may be known by its color ; the fat will be 
of oily smoothness, and incline to white, rather than 
yellow, while the lean will be of an open grain, bright 
red. Yellow fat is a sure sign of an inferior quality. 

Spieed Beef: 

Cover a round of beef, weighing about sixteen pounds, 
with a pound of salt, and turn it every day for a week. 

At the end of that time, wash it in cold water, rub it 
well with two ounces of black pepper and quarter of an 
ounce of mace. 

Fry three or four onions sliced, add a few cloves, then 
put in the meat, cover it with water, and bake in a stone- 
covered stewing pan for five hours. 

To be eaten cold, for breakfast or supper. 

Beef* Steak (Ste^wed). 

Take a steak a little more than an inch thick, fry it to 
a light brown, with two or three sliced onions. After it

is fried, put it in a stewpan, with a turnip cut up small, 
and carrot also, if you fancy, a little celery, salt, and 
pepper; cover it with water, and stew gently for two 
hours. It is said to be very delicious. 

Beef* Heairt. 

Wash it carefully, and stuff it nicely ; roast or bake 
it, and serve with the gravy, which should be thickened 
with some of the stuffing. It is very nice hashed, with a 
little port wine added. 

AJLamo^e Bee£ 

Make a stuffing of rich herbs, spice, suet, and stuff 
the beef with it ; one and a half bottles of port or 
claret wine, according to the size of the beef, and five 
quarts, of water. Do not let it boil, but simmer until 

it 1& dOBA* 

♦ 

SoiiiUi. 

To a tender piece of beef, about ten pounds, put three 
pints of water, a little pepper, salt, and an onion. Boil 
the beef gently for three or four hours; the beef should 
be turned, and the water renewed as it boils away. 
Crumbs of bread should be put in to thicken the- gravy. 

About half an hour before it is to be taken up, the 
fat should be carefully skimmed off, then a little cabbage, 
carrots, turnips, and celery, cut small, are to be put in,, 
and boiled till quite tender. 

Ooz-ned Beefl 

The brisket is the best. A piece of eight pounds will 
require four hours, slow boiling. Put it into cold water, 
and take off the scum as: it rises ; the slower it boilS: the> 



MEATS. 

better. The liquor which th6 be^f is boiled in ift very 
nice tot gravies and soups, and should bs saved for that 
purpose. 

SoileaxL. 

Take a piece of beef, weighing 8i± ot eight pounds ; 
have the bone taken out, then rub it well with a mixture 
composed of ground cloves, allspice, black pepper, sweet 
marjoram, and salt, one spoonful of each, rubbed line. 

After the mixture is well rubbed in, roll it up tightly 
and tie it ; put it into a pot half full of water, with thred 
or four potatoes, a carrot, two turnips, if small, and two 
onions, and let it stew for Si^ hours. 

Beef* ©teyr. 

Take a pound and a half of nice beef, and cUt it into 
small pieces. 

Place in the bottom of your saucepan a layer of sliced 
potatoes, a few slices of onion, a pinch of pepper, one of 
salt ; then a layer of meat, another layer of potatoes, 
onions, salt, and pepper, with a layer of meat, and con- 
tinue in this way till you have disposed of all of your 
meat ; let the top layer be of potatoes, onions, and season- 
ing. Cover all with water, and let it stew for an hour 
and a half. 

Beef* Toiifirue. 

Kit is corned, it should be soaked for twenty-four 
hours before boiling. 

It will require from three to four hours, according to 
size. The skin should always be removed as soon as it 
is taken drom the pot. An economical method is to lay 
the tongue, as soon as the skin is removed, in a jar.

coiled up, with the tip outside the root, and a weight 
upon it. When it is cold, loosen the sides, with a knife, 
and turn it out. The slices being cut horizontally all 
round, the fat and lean will go together. 

Stuffed Beef^tealc. 

Take a rump steak about an inch thick. Make a stuff- 
ing of bread, herbs, &c., and spread it over the steak. 
BoU it up, and with a needle and coarse thread sew it 
together. Lay it in an iron pot on one or two wooden 
skewers, and put in water just sufficient to cover it. Let 
it stew slowly for two hours ; longer if the beef is tough ; 
serve it in a dish with the gravy turned over it. To be 
carved crosswise, in slices, through beef and stuffing. 

Savory Seeft 

Take a shin of beef from the hind quarter, saw it into 
four pieces, put it in a pot, and boil it until the meat 
and gristle drop from the bones ; chop the meat very fine, 
put it in a dish, and season it with a little salt, pepper, 
clove, and sage, to your taste ; pour in the liquor, in which 
the meat was boiled, and place it away to harden. 

Cut in slices and eaten cold. 



PORK. 

To Select I*orl£. 

Jn fresh pork the fiesh is firm, smooth, a clear color, 
and the fat set. Dairy fed pork bears the palm over all 
^ others. In young pork, the lean, when pinched, will break- 
Excellent bacon may be known by the lean being ten- 
der and of a bright color, the fat firm and white, yet 



HEATS. 11 

bearing a pale rose tinge, the rind thin, and the lean 
tender to the touch. Rusty bacon has yellow streaks in 
it. The test of a sweet ham is to pass a sharp knife to 
the bone, and when drawn out smell it ; if the knife is 
daubed greasy, and the scent disagreeable, it is bad. 

Ooimed I*orli. 

It should be soaked a few hours before boiling, then 
well washed and scraped, and put into a fresh water. It 
must not be boiled fast, but put into cold water, and 
gradually warmed through ; skim frequently while boiling. 

A leg or shoulder, weighing seven or eight pounds, 
should boil slowly for four hours. When taken up it 
must be skinned carefully, though some prefer the skin 
remaining on, as it loses much of the juice by skinning. 
It is very nice cold. 

To Firieajsisee I*orl£. 

Cut a small sparerib or chine of pork into pieces, 
cover with water and stew until tender; remove the 
meat, and flavor the gravy with salt, pepper, and thicken 
with a little flour. Serve in a deep dish, in the gravy, 
and garnish the dish with rice. 

I*orlc IHe. 

Prepare your pork as above, or take any nice bits of 
cold roast pork. Line a deep dish with paste, fill in with 
the meat, pour the gravy over it, and cover all with the 
paste ; make a small hole in the middle of the paste, and 
bake until nicely browned. 

Pile's Feet. 

Boil four pig's feet until the bones drop out. Draw 
out the long bone and place them in a dish to cool. 



12 MEATS. 

Split each foot, take the liquor in which it is boiled, add 
the juice of a lemon and some salt, and turn over the 
feet. They may be dipped in batter, and Med in salt 
pork. 

Pigr's Heacl. 

Have the head nicely cleaned, and boil it till very ten- 
der. Chop it very fine, and season with salt, pepper, 
sage, and a little clove, while hot. Put in a deep dish, 
and cover with a plate that is smaller than the dish, that 
it may rest on the meat, tlace on the plate a very heavy 
weight, and let it stand for tventy-fpur hours- This 
makes the famous " Pig's Head Cheese." 



VEAL. 

To ©elect Veal. 

When the kidney is well surrounded with fat, you 
may be sure the meat is of good quality. Always 
choose that which is whitest and fattest. 

If the vein in the shoulder, which is very perceptible, 
is a bright red or blue, it is a sure sign that the meat 
is fresh. 

Knuelsle of Veal ©te^ved. 

Break the bone in two or thiree places, put to it ^y^ 
pints of water, some sweet herbs, whol^ blftck peppers, a 
little salt and mace. 

When the meat is done, take it out with the herbs and 
spices, and thicken the liquor with a little flour, and boil 
it up well ; th^n put back the jmaX, e^i two glasses of 
Madeira, wine, and the juice of a lemoB. L^ it come 



MEATS. 13 

to a boil, but be careful that it does not bum. It is 
much more apt to after the flour is added. 

To TtasL»t a Fillet of Veal. 

Make a stuffing of a little beef suet, chopped fine, the 
same quantity of bread crumbs, a little sweet marjoram, 
the rind of two lemons, grated, a table spoonful of grated 
horseradish, a little pepper and salt ; if you please, add 
the yolks of two hard boiled eggs, cut up fine. 

Introduce the stuffing through the fillet, secure it with 
skewers and twine ; baste it well while it is roasting, and 
make a gravy of the drippings, thickened with flour. 

Veal S^weetturead. 

Take two or three fresh sweetbreads, parboil them for 
a few minutes, then take them from the hot water, and 
put them into cold. Take some bread crumbs, and add 
the yolks of two eggs, well beaten, to the crumbs. 

When the sweetbreads are perfectly cold, place them 
on a skewer, and roll them in the prepared crumbs, lay 
them in a stew-pan with a small bit of butter and a lit- 
tle veal gravy, and cook them a nice brown. 

Take the gravy in which they are cooked, add the 
juice of a lemon, a little salt and pepper ; toast some 
slices of bread, dip them into the gravy, and lay the 
fiweetbreads on. 

Califs Head. 

Let the butcher split the head in halves. Take out 
the eyes and the snout bone ; then lay it in cold water, to 
soak two hoursT before boiling ; take out the brains, and 
wash them well in several waters, then lay them in cold 
water. Put the head together, and lay it in a good sized 



14 MEATS. 

pot, cover it with cold water, and throw in a table 
spoonful of salt. Let it boil slowly for two hours and a 
half, or three hours, according to size. 

When it has boiled a little more than an hour, take 
some of the liquor, about a quart, and put into a stew- 
pan for the gravy ; add to this liquor some salt, pepper, 
a little parsley chopped fine, a table spoonful of lemon 
pickle, and put over the fire to boil. 

Beat up an egg lightly, with two table spoonfuls of 
flour, then remove carefully the skin from the brains, 
and beat them up with the egg and flour. When well 
beaten, thicken the gravy with it, and stew about ten 
minutes. 

CaXr»» Liver, Ste^wed. 

Cut the liver into small slices, about three inches 
square. Into your sauce-pan place two onions, sliced 
fine, a table spoonful of sage, one of summer, savory, 
a little pepper and salt ; then add your liver, and cover 
with water, and let it stew for two hours. Just be- 
fore you serve it, dredge on a little flour, and add a 
table spoonful of butter. 

Veal Broth. 

Pick and wash a tea cup of rice, and put into your 
dinner pot ; cut up three or four small onions, and add 
to the rice ; next, add your meat, which should be cut 
in pieces of about a quarter of a pound each; let the 
whole be covered with water from two to three inches 
above the meat. When it has boiled an hour, add a 
few small turnips and carrots, sliced, with a table spoon- 
ful of salt; a little before it is served add some • parsley . 
This is a favorite broth with many people. It is very 



MEATS. 15 

nice without the carrots. Some prefer it thickened with 
flour instead of rice. 

A. 'R,SLsaxjLt of Oold "Veal. 

Cut the veal into slices ; put a large piece of butter 
into a frying-pan, and as soon as it is hot, dredge the 
meat well with flour, and fry a nice brown. Remove the 
meat, and put into the pan as much of your cold gravy as 
you think proper, season with pepper and salt, and a 
wine glass of tomato ketchup ; then cut a few slices of 
cold ham, lay into the gravy, and add your slices of veal. 
It must be sent to the table hot. 

To I>i*ess Oalf^s Head like Tinrtle. 

Let them boil an hour and a half, with salt in the 
water ; tie the brains in a cloth bag, and boil half an hour ; 
when all is done, take out the bones and cut up in pieces.

MUTTON AND LAMB. 

The best mutton is of a fine grain, the fat firm and 
white. 

Lamb should be eaten very fresh. Li the fore quarter, 
the vein in the neck being any other color than blue, 
betrays it to be stale. 

Sboiildex* of* IMCutton.. 

Take out the bone, and fill the space with a stuffing 
made of bread crumbs, salt pork, chopped fine, pepper,

as slaw. Some people stew the meat and serve hot. 
The best way is t#remove from the shell, being sure to 
remove the 'poison vein^ which may be found in the body 
of the creature, by drawing a ^harp knife gently through 
the middle of the back lengthwise, not cutting entirely 
through, but open the gash with the fingers, when a single 
black or dark-colored vein may be seen, which must be ' 
removed, and then the meat will be perfectly harmless. 
Arrange the meat handsomely on a dish, decorating with 
small claws, and let each one dress according to fancy.

Into three pints of flour, rub a Jittle butter ; add three 
eggs, half a pint of yeast, and a sufficiency of warm milk 
to mix these ingredients well. Make it in the evening for 
next morning's breakfast. 

Into a quart of flour, rub one table spoonful of lard and 
one of butter, with two tea spoons of cream of tartar. 
Dissolve a tea spoon of soda, and one and a half of salt 
in half pint of water, and if this will not wet the flour 
sufficiently add a little more cold water; roll it out, 
handling as little as possible, and cut with a tin into 
rounds. Bake in a quick oven, — quarter of an hour 
should bake them. Everything depends on a quick oven. 
Many use milk instead of water, but if made and baked 
properly water is nice enough to render them fit for any 
epicure. 

Soiur Millie Biscuits. 

To be made as the above, with the esioeption sour milk 
is used in the place of cream of tartar, and the soda is

lIMQrs. I^al>eiis' Economy Oalces. 

Rusked bread, or that which is old and sour, can be 
made into very nice fritters. The bread should be cut in 
small pieces, and soaked in cold water till very soft. 
Drain off the water and mash the bread fine. 

To three pints of bread thus prepared, add two eggs, 
four table spoonfuls of flour, a little salt, one tea spoon t)f 
soda in a cup of milk, which must be stirred into the 
bread, and a little more milk added, until thin enough to 
fry.

with a spoonful of butter and a little salt ; add the yolks 
of three eggs, well beaten, and stir into the potatoes, then 
add one pint and a half of milk, and a large spoonful of 
yeast ; beat in flour enough to make a stiflf dough ; set it

well, then add two table spoonfuls of molasses, tea spoon of 
salt, and a tea spoon of soda in a scant pint of water, stir 
well, and if this quantity of water does not thin the bat- 
ter sufficiently, add a little more. They are very nice 
made of sour or buttermilk instead of creain tartar and 
water. They should be about as thick as the batter for 
pancakes. Grease the griddle well to prevent them from 
adhering, and fry to a nice brown. 

Very nice for breakfast or supper, and may be eaten 
with butter or syrup.

thoroughly wet it, add a little more. It should be 
nearly as stiff as bread. Bake moderately from four to 
five hours. Some people add raisins, which makes it very 
nice.

little nutmeg with the sugar on each one. The charm is 
to eat them while hot.

PUDDINGS. 45 



PART FIFTH. 
PUDDINGS. 

Greneira,! I>iireotions. 

If you intend to hoU a pudding, always have the water 
boiling before you put in the pudding. 

Many people use a pudding cloth, kept expressly for 
the purpose, made of the thickest twilled cotton, and 
always, before using it, wash it out in clean water, and 
flour it well, before pouring in the pudding, allowing 
room for the pudding to swell according to the size 
designed. 

I much prefer the tin pudding boiler, which is hollowed 
in the centre, that the pudding may be thoroughly cooked. 
This should be well buttered before the pudding is turned 
in, which wiU prevent it from adhering to the boiler. 
The cover should be tied on, and a thick cloth tied 
tightly over the cover. 

All puddings in which --berries are used require more 
flour than • those without ; and it must be remembered 
fruit should always be added the last thing. In baking 
puddings, always be sure and butter the dish well before 
the pudding is turned ia.

PART SIXTH. 
PASTRY. 

Pastry should be handled as lightly as possible. Many 
people mix the flour and butter with a knife or an iron 
spoon. It should be baked as soon as possible after it is 
made, and in a hot oven. A nice pie will be brown, ten- 
der, and flaky. Never put in the filling, such as mince, 
apple, custard, &c., until you are ready to bake them.

think the apple required (apples vary so in sweetness jon 
cannot be governed by any rule), a little rose water, and 
nutmeg to taste ; cover with the upper paste, make 
a small incision in the middle of the upper crust, and 
bake. Many people think these the nicest kind of apple 
pie. 

Pan I»ie. 

Take a deep earthen pudding pot, fill it with slices of 
apple, then pour on as much molasses as the apple 
requires to sweeten it ; sprinkle over a little cinnamon, 
put over a paste, with a small slit in the middle, and place 
in the oven. After the first paste is baked it may be 
taken off, and another put on in its place. This should 
be taken off, and the apple remain long enough to be a 
deep red. When cooked enough, take from the oven, and 
immediately break the paste in small pieces, and stir into 
the sauce while hot. To be eaten cold. It is a favorite 
dish with many people, and very nice.

PART SEVENTH. 

CAKE. 

Djbrections il>x* Bf!a.kiiig^ Oailce. 

The flour used for making cake should always be dried 
and sifted ; always break the eggs separately in a cup. It 
is a good plan to lay the eggs, to be used, for a few hours 
in very cold water before breaking ; they whip better for 
being cold. 

When soda is used, always dissolve it before adding it 
to the general mixture. 

- In winter, soften but do not melt the butter in the milk 
used. 

Never add the fruit to cake until it is ready for baking. 

In baking cake which requires long baking, take white 
paper and lay on the sides, bottom, and top ; it is easily 
removed when the cake is done. 

To ascertain when a loaf of cake is done, take a fine 
knitting-needle and insert in the thickest part of the loaf; 
if it does not stick to the needle, the baking is finished. 

In whipping the whites of eggs, always use a shallow 
dish, and whip them in a cool place. 

Never stop after you commence until they are light, and 
whip them until you can turn the dish over without their 
slipping. 

It is better to beat the yolks and whites of eggs 
separately, except in cake that contains yeast or soda. 



CAKE. 69 

The ingredients of the cake should be well beaten to- 
gether before the flour is mixed in, for it does not benefit 
the cake by beating after all the flour is added. 

I find bj experience that the granulated sugar is purer, 
sweeter, and better in every respect for cakes and all 
pastries than brown sugar. 

The butter and sugar should always be worked to a 
cream, and the other ingredients added afterwards, the 
flour always the last. 

The cake should be turned from the tins as soon as it 
comes from the oven. It requires a much hotter oven 
for cake with soda in it, than for that which is raised 
with yeast. 

Four pounds of flour, one half pound of butter, one 
half pound of sugar, five eggs, half pint of yeast, two 
gills of wine, two tea spoons of ground allspice, one of 
clove, one of cinnamon. Beat it well.
