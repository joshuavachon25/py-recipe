PUBLIC LISKARY

AD FER TI SEME NT. 



THE reader may probably ask. What necessity 
is Ihere for another Cookery Book, after the 
immense number which have already appeared, 
and many of them with the names of those who 
are considered as proficients in the art ? 

My answer is, that, notwithstanding the 
number of publications on this subject, there is 
still room for another ; because most of those 
alluded to, so much resemble each other, that 
no material difference can be discovered in 
their general plan or execution. 

A work has been lately published, under the 
title of " Domestic Cookery," by a Lady, 
which has shared an uncommon portion. of pub- 
lic approbation, and indeed deservedly so; for 
I do not recollect to have seen a more useful 
book of the kind for domestic use.

The general fault of cookery books is, that 
they are loaded with unnecessary, and indeed 
trifling, receipts, which every one, \\lio has 
the slightest knowledge of cookery, must be 
thoroughly acquainted \\ilh. 

In the Worknow presented to public inspec- 
tion, I do not profess to give any hackneyed re- 
ceipts for boiling or roasting, broiling or bak- 
ing, bu! have conlined my selection chiefly to 
the higher departments of the art, such as made 
dishes, ragouts, fricassees, soups, <S;e. 1 have 
aimed, in general, lo^'ue the most esteemed 
Foreign and Lnglish dislns thai are now in 
use. 

An idea generally prevails, that those who 
have lived at an hotel, tavern, or coffee-house, 
must of course be thoroughly perfected in the 
art of cookery. This is by no means the case : 
there are dishes made in noblemen's houses, 
both in town and country, which a cook of ihe 
description I have mentioned kno\\s very little 
about ; it is only in the first families of rank and

fashion that these things are to be found. The 
time which is allotted to a tavern cook in the 
ordinary course of his business, will not be suf- 
ficient to enable him to accomplish such de- 
signs, even if he were capable of it. Another 
reason, is the enormous expense which must at- 
tend the system of cookery of which I now 
speak. 

I 

It will be perfectly understood, that I do not 
consider this as an introductory work : such 
publications are already so numerous, that 
there is no necessity to enlarge the number. 

It will bs said, this book is not adapted for 
families in general ; the receipts are too expen- 
sive. This is admitted : but are there net thou- 
sands of OPULENT FAMILIES, both in town 
and country, who wish to give handsome 
OCCASIONAL entertainments to their select 
friends ; and who, on such occasions, are not 
so scrupulous of the expense ? To such, I flatter 
myself, the present undertaking will be of great 
service. As to the common hints for marketing, 

a4 



yill ADVERTISEMENT. 

carving, bills of fare, c. what I have already 
said will sufficiently account for the omission. 
As to confectionary in general, I refer the 
reader to the last edition of my " Complete 
Confectioner," the rapid sale of which has cx- 
ccded my most sanguine expectations. The 
5th edition fins lately been published. 

With many thanks for the assistance of my 
friends, I must now conclude. 

To that indulgent public \\hich has so fa- 
Younbly encouraged " The Complete Confec- 
tioner," 1 now submit " The Ro^al and Im- 
perial Cook."

SOUPS. 

1N T making any kind of soups, particu- 
larly vermicelli, portable, brown gravy 
soup, or any other in which herbs are 
used, remember to lay the meat in the 
bottom of your pan, with a large lump 
of butter. Having cut the roots and 
herbs small, stew them over the meat, 
and set the pan on a very slow fire. 
This will draw all the virtue out of the dif- 
ferent ingredients, will produce a good 
gravy, and a very different effect, in 
point of flavour, than if at first you had 
put in water. Fill your pan with wa- 
ter as soon as the gravy is almost dried 
up. Take off the fat as soon as it begins 

u 



2 THE IMPERIAL AXI3 

to boil, and then follow the directions 
for making the sort of soup you wish to 
have. Green peas, intended for soup, 
require hard water ; but soft water is 
preferable for old pea soup. In mak- 
ing' white soup, let it be taken off the 
lire before you put in the eream. As 
soups are soon cold, always dish them 
up the last thing. Take care all the 
greens and herbs you use in soups are 
well washed and clean picked, and that 
no one thing has a predominant taste over 
another, but that it has a fine agreeable 

O 

relish, and that all the- tastes be united. 



SOUP A LV II KINK. 

CUT a few slices of lean ham, and co- 
ver the bottom of a stewpan, that will 
hold four quarts; cut up t\vo fowls, and 
put them in the stcwpan, with a few sli- 
ces of veal, some parsley, six onions, a 
lew blades of mace, and about half a pint

of water ; put it on a slow stove for an 
hour, to draw down ; (take care that it 
docs not catch at the bottom :) when 
drawn down, fdl up j^e stewpan with 
some of your best stock, and let it boil 
gently for one hour; take out the fowls, 
and pull the meat from the bones ; put it 
into a mortar, with two ounces of sweet 
almonds ; let it be pounded very fine, so 
that it will go through a tammy : when 
beat enough, put it into a small soup-pot 
that will hold about three quarts ; put 
nearly two quarts of the stock which the 
fowls were boiled in, with the crumb of 
three French rolls ; let it boil for one 
hour, then rub it through a tammv, and 

<z? %} y 

add about a pint of good cream that has 
been boiled ; put it in the soup-pot, and 
put the pot into a stewpan of hot water, 
and set it by the side of a stove to boil. 
Before you put it into the tureen, taste 
it, as perhaps it may want a little salt, 
or a small bit of sugar : cut the crust of 
the rolls, which you took the crumb

a shilling, and put them into the tureen

N. H. All white soups should be 
warmed by putting the soup-pot into 
hot water. 



VERMICELLI SOUP, WHITE OR BROUN.

wanted, hv putting it on the lire in cold 
water; let it boil up, then strain it off, 
and put it into cold water; let the vermi- 
celli stay in the water until it is cold, (if 
it is left on a sieve to drain while hot, it 
becomes lumpy, and will not dissolve 
again,) strain it quite dry from the cold 
water, put as much best stock as you 
want soup. If it is for white, make a 
liaison of six eggs.

tle Cayenne; put the bouiili on a dish, 
pour sauce on it, and send it to table. 



SOUP CRESSEY. 

GRATE four carrots, a few sliced 
onions, and cut lettuce ; .put them 
all into a stewpan, with a bit of but- 
ter; put a pint of lentils on the top 
of the roots, and add a pint of good 
stock; let it simmer for half an hour, 
then fill it up with the stock ; let it boil 
gently for an hour, then put in the crumb

COVER the bottom of your pot with 
lean ham ; cut it in thin broad slices : 
the quantity of ham depends upon the 
size of the pot ; it is better to put too 
much than too little : be very careful to 
cut all the rusty fat from the lean ; then 
cut up what veal you think requisite, 
(as the quantity must depend upon your 
judgment,) and put it in the stock-pot, 
with the trimmings of any other meat 
you may have by you ; throw in all your 
trimmings of poultry, such as necks,

MUSHROOMS, EITHER FOR FIRST OR 
SECOND COURSE. 

PARE the mushrooms the same as an 
apple, put them in the water, and squeeze 
a lemon into it; then put about two oun- 
ces of butter into a stewpan that will 
hold a quart of mushrooms ; put in the 
mushrooms, with a little pepper and salt, 
and the juice of two lemons; put them 
over a slow fire to draw down : they dis- 

w 

charge a urrat deal of liquor, and should 
remain on the fire until the liquor has 
boiled away, and they become quite dry ; 
but be careful not to let them stick to the 
bottom of the stewpan: when done, put 
them into sweat-meat pots, fill them tluce 
parts full, and iill the 1 pot up to the top 
M'ith clarified butter, quite hot. 

X. 15. The pots will no! require to be 
covered over when they are wanted for 
use; put the mushrooms inio a >tcu p.m 
to warm, str.iin the butter from them,.

and put them either into brown or white 
sauce, according to what they are wanted 
for. By following this method, you may 
have mushrooms all the year round. 



TRUFFLES TO KEEP A YEAR, OR MORE. 

BRUSH the dirt very clean from them 
after washing them in several waters, 
then put them into a stewpan ; put in 
some very strong stock, and half the 
quantity of fat from a brown braise, a 
quart of sherry to about six pounds of 
truffles, one dozen of onions, a faggot of 
sweet herbs, a few blades of mace tied up 
in the faggot ; put the stewpan on a slow 
stove to boil for one hour; then take 
them out, and divide those which you 
wish to send for second course, which 
should be the largest and roundest; peel 
the others, and put them in sweet-meat 
pots, the unpeeled the same; skim the

fat from the braise, and clarify it; boil 
the other part to a glaze, pour it over the 
trutlles, and then add the fat, while 
quite hot ; the trutlles should be entirely 
covered. 

N. 1). The reason for peeling the truf- 
fles that are wanted for cut res, &c. is, 
that thev are readv at a short notiee, 
take up less room, and do not waste the 
glaze that they are preserved in; it is 
very excellent for giving the proper fla- 
vour to the sauce. 



BEEF MADE DISHES. 



OX RUMPS. 



ABOUT four ox rumps make a good

wanting, (one cabbage will make four 
bundles ;) the cabbage should be three 
parts boiled, then squeezed very dry with 
the hand, and lastly with a cloth, so as 
not to leave the least drop of water in 
the cabbage ; tie the bundles up with 
packthread, and put them into the braise

braising pan (but not a very deep one,) 
-with the marinade, and about a pint of 
stock, covered with bacon and pepper; 
be sure to let it simmer very gently ; it 
will take two hours ; when done, pour off 
the liquor, and strain it; skim the fat 
from it very clean, reduce it to a glaze,

on a slow stove to simmer for about two 
hours and a half; take it up, pull all the 
bones from it, dish it, and pur a ragout 
of sweet-bread, mushrooms, and force- 
meat balls over the veal. The ragout 
is made as follows: put a few mush- 
rooms into a stewpan, with a small quan- 
tity of butter, a little pepper and salt, and 
half a lemon squeezed; put it on a blow

force-meat bulls, and one dozen of egg 
balls ; put sauce tourney as much as you 
think will do; add two glasses of Ma- 
deira; and the braise, strained, skimmed, 
and boiled down to a glaze, answers two 
purposes ; first, it gives a right flavour to 
the ragout ; next, the glaze gives it a fine 
gold colour. 



TENDERONES OF VEAL. 

TENDERONES of veal are the gristle- 
bone of the breast of veal ; cut it into

put the partridges on the bacon, and 
cover them over with bacon and a sheet 
of paper cut to the size of the stewpan, 
by way of keeping in all the steam ; put

should be done as follows : raise a pie 
according to the number of the birds you 
intend to put in; lay a thick layer of 
good farce at the bottom ; then take the 
fat off the partridges, and put them in 
the pie, (but not the glaze) ; cover them 
with farce and thin sheets of bacon, or 
the fat of a cutting ham, which is what 
is generally used for all things that re- 
quire to be covered with fat; as, in the 
first place, it generally has a finer flavour 
than bacon ; and, in the next, the fat of 
ham cannot be used in any other way ; 
therefore it would be wasted, if not so 
used : it answers two good purposes ; 
which are, by giving a better flavour, 
and being economical : cover the pie in, 
ornament it, put it into a slow oven, and 
let it stav until it has baked about half an 

V 

hour ; then take it out, make the glaze 
hot that the partridges are taken from, 
and put a little good stock to it, to

ISC THE IMPERIAL AND 



PICKLED SALMON. 

PICK i i n salmon is generally had iVoni 
tlic oyster purveyors. If it should be 
desired to be pickled at home, it, is done 
in the following manner: the salmon 
should <>f course lie liist cleaned and 
>calcd, then split down the middle, and 
cut into proper si/ed puvcs ; (the num- 
ber of piece*, that the s;ilmmi is to be cut 
into, depends upon the size of the sal- 
mon'; put the salmon into a fish Keltic, 
and as much cold water as will barely 
Cover it ; add about a pint of vinegar, a 
handful of salt, about a do/en bay leaves, 
a little mace, and some white whole pep- 
per; when the salmon is done, take it up, 
and lay it on a clean cloth; put the li- 
quor into a smaller vessel, and set it on a 
quick stove to boil until three parts re- 
duced ; then put it into a pan to cool; 
when cold, put the salmon in. Salmon 
done this wav will retain its "-oodncss

SALMON. 

TAKE a piece of salmon of five or six 
pounds weight, (or larger, according to 
your company); cut it into slices about 
an inch thick; after which, make a force-

salmon, and the same quantity of the 
meat off an eel, with a few mushrooms ; 
season it with pepper, salt, nutmeg, and 
cloves, and beat it all together till it is 
very fine: boil the crumb of a roll in 
milk, and beat it up with four eggs till 
it is thick; then let it cool; add four raw 
eggs to it, and mix the whole together;

prevent the skin from breaking ; having 
done this, drudge them well with flour, 
and, before you put them on, rub the 
gridiron well with beef suet : let your

do the turkeys the same, and put farce in 
the turkeys, and truffles, and about three 
pounds of the prime part of Westphalia 
ham that has been braised for about two 
hours ; then make the turkey the same 
shape as the geese; put about one pint 
of good stock into a braising-pan (or any 
thing of that kind) that will barely hold 
them, as by that means they will keep 
their shape ; put them on a slow stove to 
simmer gently for half an hour, by 
way of setting them ; put them to cool 
in the pan they are done in ; while they 
are cooling, raise the pie ; let them be

tlic turkeys and geese; ])llt faR . c between

and about two pounds of ra w truffles,' 
first being peeled, and cover them with 
sheets of haeon ; then cover the pie with 
P :l ^<', and ornament it according to 
fancy: observe to ornament it strong; 
for, if done line, it will not look well, by 
being so long in the oven; it should not 
I"' put in the oven the same evening that 
it is made, hut nr.xt morning, or evening: 
the- !>CM ox-en for it, is just when the 
l"vad is drawn out; leave it in about 
eight hours; when you take it out of the 
oven, he careful that you do not spill any 
fet that rises to the top, as that .soaks 
into the geese and turkeys, and makes 
them mellow : this pie will take four and 
twenty hours to get cold, therefore you 
must prepare accordingly. It ought to 
be begun four days before the day on 
^vhich it is wanted. Ik-fore the pie is 
sent up to the table there should be chop- 
ped a-pic put in it, and the sheets of ba- 



ROYAL COOK. 253 

con taken off. This is the general rule, 
but not the rule that I either recommend 
or follow ; for this reason : by taking 
the bacon off the geese, you let the air 
into the pie, and then the aspic will get 
sour and mouldy in a few days ; therefore 
I recommend the following method : 
put the bones of the turkeys and geese, 
two old fowls, and two pounds of lean 
ham, into a proper sized stewpan, with 
twelve onions, six heads of celery, a little 

v J 

parsley, and other sweet herbs ; put one 
pint of water to them, and put the stew- 
pan on a stove to simmer very slow for 
two hours, but be sure that it does not 
catch at the bottom; fill it up with 
stock, and let it boil very slow for 
three hours ; then strain it off, fill the 
stewpan again with water, and let it boil 
all the evening; the liquor that was first 
strained off put into a stewpan, (first 
skimming the fat off), to reduce to the 
quantity that you think will iill up the 
pie after it is baked, and should be put in 



'.2.34 11! K IMPERIAL AM) 

about half an hour after it is taken out 
of tin- oven, just as much as will hardy 
cover tin- bacon; this will make the pie 
cat far better. 

N. I). Small pies for hall-suppers 
should have- the aspic put over them be- 
fore they are M nt to table; in every other 
respect, all cold pies should be made in 
this manner, only varying as to dilferent 
meats, &c. A tin case has been invented 
for large pies, which is made use of in 
the follo\\ ing manner: make paste the 
same' as tor a raised pie, brush the inside 
of the mould with egg, (be sure to put 
plenty on\ roll out the paste about two 
inches larger than the bottoms, that it 
may turn up on the sides; then roll out 
paste to cover the in.side; let it turn over 
about an inch; roll pieces of paste t\vo 
inches larger than the bottom, egg- four 
sheets of large kitchen-paper, lay the 
paste on them, put plent\ of egg on the 
paste, and put on the tin case; the egg 
will make it stick to the tin; then roll 



ROYAL COOK. 255 

paste out for the sides, roll it in two pieces, 
egg the sides, and put the paste on ; rub it 
smooth with the palm of yourhand, to hin- 
der it from gathering wind, which, if it 
does, the paste will blister and break.when 
a few days baked ; the paste that goes 
round the sides should be about two inches 
broader than the side of the pie, so as to lay 
over the top and fasten to the bottom 
paste, so as to make it a proper thickness, 
to enable you to pinch the bottom, and 
the same at the top; when the case is pro- 
perly covered, then fill the pie as before 
directed; cover it in, and ornament it : 
as to size and shape, that must depend on 
those who are to make or order the pie : 
the tin cases are made by Mr. Bailis, 
in Cockspur-street, Charing-cross, who 
will give a proper direction how to use 
them, by lining it with paper, to give a 
clear idea to those who may not compre- 
hend what I have said upon this subject. 
By using those tins, you are sure of all 
the liquor remaining in the pie : for in- 



'J.~>(> THE MI r Kill A I. A.ND 

.stance: make a lar^c pie, without a tin 
ca>c: an accident may happen to it, so as 
to crack in the oven, which lets the 
gravv and goodness out, and of course 
the true fhvom of the pie is lost, and the 
cook blamed !>v his employer t'or what 
he could not avoid ; tor at times the 1 Hour 
will not stand the ovc n without crack- 
ing: and it certainly does not, take half 
the llour, which is a great consideration : 
the tin case will last a number of years. 
There 1 is another advantage, which is, 
then' is DO occasion to set the meat; for 
if the meat is not set, when the' crust is 
raised it will burst the pic, and of course 
let out all the essence of the iii->de, 
which cannot be retrieved without 
double expense. 



A CHRKHIVS IME. 

IT is made in the same manmras the 
last, with the addition of partridges, 



ROYAL COOK. 25? 

hares, and pheasants, all boned : as to 
the number, it depends on the size which 
the pie is to be. 



A COLD PARTRIDGE PIE. 

CONE partridges, the number accord- 
ing to the size the pie is wanted ; make 
some good farce, and fill the partridges 
with it ; put a whole raw truffle in each 
partridge, (let the truffle be peeled) ; raise 
the pie ; put a few slices of veal in the 
bottom of it, and a thick layer of farce ; 
then the partridges, and four raw truffles 
to each partridge ; then cover the par- 
tridges and truffles over with sheets of 
bacon; cover the pie in, and finish it; it 
will take four hours' baking ; cut two 

O 7 

pounds of lean ham (if eight partridges 
are in the pie) in very thin slices, put it 
in a stewpan, with the bones ynd giblets 
of the partridges, and any other loose

PUFF-PASTE. 

TAKE three quarters of a pound of

be careful not to put too much water at 
first; mix it up rather stiff, then work it 
in well, with the heel of your hand, until 
it becomes pliable, so that it will draw in 
strings; then take a pound of butter, and 
work it together until it becomes tough ; 
roll the paste out rather thick, put all the 
butter in at once, and fold the paste quite 
even ; then roll it out again, and fold it 
up in regular folds; repeat this three 
times, then roll it out for use ; be careful 
to let it all be of a thickness, otherwise 
it will not bake upright, but fall aside in 
the oven; if for pates, it should be 
nearly a quarter of an inch ; cut out with

cut them in the middle about halt 
through; put them in a quick oven im- 
mediately ; be particularly attentive to 
the oven, as thcv will not take manv mi-

ANOTHER WAY TO MAKE PUFF-PASTE, 

PARTICULARLY IN HOT WEATHER. 

CUT the butter in three equal pieces, 
have flour of equal weight, roll the but- 
ter in, and make as much stick to it as 
you can ; wet the remainder with water 
and egg, the same as before ; when well 
worked, roll the paste out, and put one 
third of the butter in ; fold it up, dust it 
with flour, and roll it out; then put half 
the butter that is left, fold it up, and roll 
it out again ; then put in the remainder of 
the butter, fold it up, and put it between 
two dishes, and leave it for half an hour, or 
until wanted ; then roll it out, and fold it 
up ; then roll it out for use. 



TART PASTE, COMMONLY CALLED

must direct you. 



ALMOND PASTE FOR SECOND COURSE 
DISHES. 



TAKE a pound of sweet, and four 
ounces of bitter, almonds ; blanch them, 
and make them as dry as you can ; put 
them into a mortar, and pound them 
well ; beat up the whites of three eggs, 

OO ' 

and wet the almonds with it by a little 
at a time ; when pounded enough, rub it 
through a tammy-sieve ; then get a small

with laree, then with sheets of bacon ; 
finish the pic, and put it into the oven ; 



ROYAL COOK. 265 

it will take three hours to bake; when 
done, have some stock of the very hest 
sort, and about a pint of sherry to a pie 
that contains twelve woodcocks, and 
three parts stock to one of wine; put it 
in the pie while hot; be careful not to let 
any of the fat spill over the sides of the 
pie, for this reason ; it soaksin to the 
woodcocks and makes them mellow, and 
helps the flavour.

woodcocks, only they will take less doing, 
of course.

SMALL MUTTON PIES. 

RAISE as many small pies as the dish 
will hold ; cut the fillet of a neck of mut- 
ton, and some fat; take all the skin and 
sinews from it, and mince it very fine 

i/ 

with your knife, (not with the chopping 
knife); put about a spoonful of stock in- 
to a stewpan with the mutton, mix a lit- 
tle chopped shalot, mushrooms, parsley, 
and a very little pepper and salt ; add it 
to the meat, and set it on the fire for a 
few minutes, stirring it all the while ; 
take it off to cool ; then fill the pies ; 
they will take about half an hour baking; 
with the meat that is left, put as much 
coulis and stock as you think will fill the 
pies up; when they are baked, cut the 
tops off, and fill them with it; dish them 
on a napkin. 

N. B. All pastry should be dished on 
napkins.

ounces of butter into a stewpan that will 
hold a quart of mushrooms, put in the 
mushrooms, a little pepper and salt, and 
the juice of two lemons ; put them over a 
slow fire to draw down ; they discharge 
a great deal of liquor, and should remain 
on the fire until the Tumor is boiled 
away, and becomes quite dry, but be 
careful not to let them stick to the bot- 
tom of the stewpan ; when done, put 
them into sweetmeat-pots, iill them three

until the stock is quite reduced and the

them through a tammy ; then put them 
into a stewpan, and one quart of glaze, 
made from the best stock, or the bottom 
of braises ; put them on a quick stove, 
and keep stirring them while on the fire; 
it should be until the glaze is reduced 
one quarter, or until the herbs become 
quite thick, and begin to stick to the 
bottom of the stewpan ; then put it into 
oval or round potting pots, as they are 
more convenient than the preserving pots 
for cutting out small quantities; those 
herbs will retain their flavour for six 
years, or longer. Turtle herbs done in 
this manner will be found very useful for 
mock-turtle, calf's head hash, matelot of 
different kinds of fish : it takes but a 
small quantity to give the proper flavour 
to the above-mentioned uses; about a 
quarter of an ounce to a pint of sauce,

that will be sufficient for two quarts of

to draw down until quite dry; then put 
about half a pint of good glaze to them, 
and let them simmer in that for a few

quick, as by so doing it would waste too 
much; put the French beans into stone 
jars about three parts full; when the 
brine is quite cold, fill the jars within 
about an inch, and the remainder part 
with salad oil; tie a bladder over them ; 
they will keep good the year round ; be- 
fore using, soak them in warm water, and 
change it several times; when they are 
put to boil, be particular that the water 
boils very fast before the beans are put in, 
and keep boiling till they are done. 

N. R There is not the smallest doubt 
that French beans are a very good and 
wholesome vegetable to take to sea on 
long voyages, as the salt is very easily 
extracted, by putting'them in warm water 
for about two hours before using : the ex- 
pense of trying them would be very trif- 
ling; the early part of September is the 
time they are very plentiful, and gene- 
rally cheaper, or as cheap, as any other 
vegetable.

ful that the venison has no colour from 
the fire ; the paler the fat is, the hetter 
the venison is cooked. A neck of doc 
venison will take an hour ; a ditto of

PORTABLE SOUP. 

THIS soup (which is particularly cal- 
culated for the use and convenience of 
travellers, from its not receiving any in- 
jury by time) must be made in the 
following manner: cut into small pieces 
three large legs of veal, one of beef, and 
the lean part of ham ; put a quarter of a 
pound of butter at the bottom of a large 
cauldron, then lay in the meat and bones, 
with four ounces of anchovies, and two 
ounces of mace ; cut off the areen of five 

O 

or six heads of cclerv, wash the heads 

/ ' 

quite clean, cut them small, put them in, 
with three large carrots cut thin, cover 
the cauldron quite close, nncl set it over a 
moderate fire; when \ on find the gravy 
begins to draw, keep taking it up till 
you have got it ail cut; then put water 
in to cover the meat; set it on the lire 
again, and let it boil priuly for four 
hours; then strain it through a hair- sieve

consistence, observing to keep skimming 
off the fat elean, as it rises : you must 
take particular care, when it is nearly 
done enough, that it docs not hum: sea- 
-' 11 it to your taste \vith Cayenne pep- 
per, and pour it on flat earthen dishes a 
quarter of an inch thick ; let it stand till 
the next day, and then cut it out by 
round tuts a little larger than a crown- 
picee : lay the cake in dishes, and set 
them in the situ to dry; to facilitate 
which, turn them often: when the cakc<- 
are dr\, put them into a tin box, with a 
piece of clean white paper between each, 
and keep them in a dry place; if made 
in frosty weather, it will be SOOIK r 
formed into its proper solidity. This 
soup is not only particularly useful to 
trayellers, but is also exceedingly convc-

nicnt to be kept in private families; for

by putting* one of the cakes into a sauce- 
pan, with about a pint of water and a 
little salt, a bason of good broth may be 
had in a few minutes. Another conveni- 
ence attending this soup, is, that by boil- 
ing a large quantity of water with one of 
the cakes, it will make an excellent oravv 

o / 

for roast turkies or fowls. 



GLAZE FOR LARDING, &c. 

LET the stock that is intended for this 
use be as clean as possible, and of a pale 
colour ; (if the stock is not clear, it 
should be cleared with eggs, and run 
through a jelly-bag) ; boil it over the 
fire until it hangs to the spoon; when 
done, put it into a glaze-kettle; (the 
i>-laze-kettle is made similar to a milk-ket- 

O 

tie, and of the best block-tin) : when the 
glaze is wanted for use, put the kettle 
into a stewpan of water, by the side of a 
stove.

of a deep brown, pour in a little red wine, 
and stir it well together ; then add more 
wine, about a pint in all, and keep stir-

ounce of Jamaica pepper, six cloves, 
shalots, two or three blades of mace, 
three spoonfuls of catsup, a little salt, 
and the rhind of a lemon ; boil them

and then cabbage, and so on until the 
tub is quite full : it must be pounded 
down with a wooden pestle until the 
juice of the cabbage comes on the top; 
(the size of the tub depends upon the 
quantity wanted): then put on a clean 
cloth, a clean board over that, and put 
some heavy weights on them, to keep 
them down close; for the heavier the 
weight is, the more it will press the li- 
quor from the cabbage; as the liquor 
rises, pour it off; it should be done at 
least six weeks or two months before 
using : when any is wanted for use, wash 
it in warm water, and pick all the juniper 
berries from the cabbage. The best way 
of dressing it is as follows : put half a 
pint of good stock, a quarter of a pound 
of butter, and a piece of pickled pork on 
the top, or a fdlet of beef, larded and 
glazed ; put it on a slow stove, to stew at 
least live hours; put the cabbage on the

THE sorrel should be picked so as to 
be very fresh from the stalks, and washed 
in several waters, as it is very apt to be 
gritty ; chop it very fine, and squeeze the 
water from it; then put a bit of butter 
into a stewpan, a slice of lean ham, and 
one large onion chopped very fine, about 
two table spoonfuls of good stock, and

BEING 

A COMPLETE GUIDE TO THE BRITISH CAPITAL; 

Containing an accurate and succinct Account of its Origin, Rise, anti 
Progress; the Increase and Extent of its Buildings ; its Commerce, Curio- 
sities, Exhibitions, Amusements, Public Calamities, Religious and Charita- 
ble Foundations, Litrrary Establishments, Learned and Scientific Institu- 
tions, &c. &c. Faithfully abridged from Pennant's London, andbrought 
down to the present Year. 

BY JOHJV WALLIS. 

This instructive and amusing Work, contains the essence of the labours 
of preceding Antiquarians and Topographers, judiciously selected and im- 
proved. The author, avoiding the prolixity, formality, and expense of 
the mere recorder of antiquities, and yet without omitting any thing inte- 
resting to the admirer of ancient customs and manners, has intermixed s 
many observations, interspersed with anecdotes of persons and places, as te 
render details, otherwise dtfy, perfectly entertaining. Several incidents are 
introduced in different parts of this truly copious volume hitherto unno- 
ticed, particularly under the heads, Auction -Mart, Commercial Road, fliq 
A.-.O'i/il'ion, Freelhinking Christians, Mathematical Society, the Prisons, Palcr- 

'''r-Ji'Hi.-, Cock-lane, Duke's Place, Jew's Hospital, Temple of Reason, thf 
1 1 :cer, 6Cf. <SY. If it be necessary that every person, passing for well- 
informed, should be acquainted with the history of his own country, the 
obligation of knowing that of the METROPOLIS, particularly in its re- 
cent increase and prosperity, is still greater. Its late improvements, 
resulting from commercial speculations, the opulence of the inhabitants, 
public establishments, &c. &c. are admirably portrayed, and convey, 
upon the whole, a complete picture of thcrfrst city in the world.

" It has loin; been our wish that 
some person, who had known France 
previous to tin- Involution, would 
undertake to dcsi-rilir it in its pre- 
seni state. Mr. Yorke has fully gra- 
tilied that wish, and with his fund of 
|irc\i,.us knowledge, an acute and 
penetrating mind, an aptness of 
classical allusion, no small portion 
of humour, and very considerable 
talents, he could scarcely fail to 
produce a work, upon this subject, 
at on, -e instructive, interesting, and 
iiuusing. These letters are written 
in easy, perspicuous, and flowing 
language. Whether amusement or 
information be the object of the 
r.-adei, they may be perused with 
ad\ antage, for they contain a copi- 
ous fund of both.' 1

of the Plays of William Shakspeare, 
accurately printed, and uithout the

Though the editions, lately pub- 
lished, of the Plays of our immortal

unnecessary. Its intention is ob- 



\ iously, to facilitate and extend the 
knowledge of an author, of whom 
England has just reason to be proud; 
and whose 
" .......... works arc iuch 

As neither Man nor Muse can praise 
too much."
