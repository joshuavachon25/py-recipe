Q^^ ANNED SALMON is one of the most im- 
ymJfoj) portant, nutritious and appetizing" of fish 
foods. Its culinary advantages are numer- 
ous and exceedingly valuable. The Alaska 

Packers Association has compiled this book, aboiiid- 

ing" in sug'g'estions for the serving" of this 

popular and excellent fish, and presents it 

to the public with the assurance that no 

other single article of food affords 

such a wide range of uses. 

Canned Salmon may be eaten in 

so many different ways that it readily 

adapts itself to the requirements of 

the breakfast, luncheon, dinner or 

supper, and gives seasonable 

variety to the meal. It is 

especially suited for pic- 
nic and outing" lunches, 

and is invaluable 

for camp life. 









CANNED SALMON has two oppo- 
site qualities of sterling- merit. It 
may be used where a plain dish is 
desired, without preparation, for the 
fish is so thoroug"hly and scientifically 
cooked and sterilized during- the pro- 
cess of canning, that it is ready for 
use when opened. On the other hand, 
it affords an ample field and opportunity 
for the highest ability and genius of the 
experienced cook. It is always ready 
for iiumcdiate use when the unexpected 
visitor happens in at meal time, or can 
be made to fill the most elaborate 
demands of a full course dinner.

ALASKA PACKERS ASSOCIATION 




Its 

Food 

Value 



An eminent seientific authority on food 
values has commented on Canned Sal- 
mon in the following' terms : ' ' Within 
the entire rang-e of preserved food it 
would be difficult to name an article of g'reater 
dietary value and cheaper than Salmon, with the 
exception of milk. It is one of the wonderful facts 
of our time that throug'h modern invention and' 
appliances one pound of the richest fish that swims 
niay be had at a cost to the consumer from one-half 
to one-third the cost of the same cjuantity of fresh 
Salmon. Canned Salinon contains 
as much protein as lamb chops 
or beefsteak; 60 per cent 
•!i i^ more than eg'gs ; more fat 

> than chicken, eg'g's or beef. 

It is incomparably of 
greater food value than 
fruits or veg-etables." 




SALMON RECIPES 



The Alaska Packers Association is the 

lart^'est Salmon canning' company in the world. 
Its canneries are located on the Pacific 
Coast from Puget Sound t(j Bering- Sea. 
More than one and a quarter million 
cases of vSalmon are packed annually' by 
the Association and sold e^'ery^vhere by 
reliable grocers. 

Each label bears the Company's 
name and seal, which is 
a g-uarantee 
of hig'hest 
quality. -.;

Hoiv 

to Open 
the Can 




To open a Can 

of wSalmon, first 

lay the can on 

its side and in- 
sert the can opener close to 
the seam, as shown in illus- 
tration No. 1, then standing 
the can on end press the top 
firmly down and work the illustration no. i 

can opener around to the seam as shown in illustra- 
tion No. 2. This permits the Salmon to come out in 
one whole piece. 

Always remove the vSalmon from the can imme- 
diately after opening-. This is very important. 

Unless otherwise specified, when a spoonful is 

given as a standard of measurement, a level spoonful 

is intended. 

In all of the recipes 

where a ' ' Can of vSalmon ' ' 

is referred to, the contents 

of a One Pound Can is 

understood. 

Any good sauce for 

fish or meat is equally good 

for Salmon.
