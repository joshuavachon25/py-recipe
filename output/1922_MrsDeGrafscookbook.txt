MRS. DE GRAF'S COOK BOOK [13] 

Measurements 

I HE first essentials for uniform results in cookery 
are knowledge of the proper methods to use and 
accuracy of measurements. All cook books and 
tested recipes call for measuring cups and level 
measurements, and flour is sifted once before measuring. 
This will insure uniform results, providing the oven heat 
and the methods used are correct. Most failures in cooking 
can be traced to careless measuring, not following the 
recipe accurately, or lack of proper heat regulation. 

Experience in teaching housewives the fundamentals 
of cookery have brought out the information that com- 
paratively few women provide themselves with standard 
half pint measuring cups. All tested recipes call for a 
cup of this type. For flour mixtures the ordinary house- 
hold cup is not satisfactory, as it seldom holds a half pint. 
The baking powder, salt, etc., will be out of proportion to 
the other ingredients if a standard measuring cup is not 
used. It may not mean failure, but it will mean indifferent 
results. Careless measuring of salt will render a dish most 
unpleasant, if not entirely useless. Too much baking 
powder will cause a cake to be dry and coarse in texture. 
My own experience as a teacher has shown me that the 
average housewife does not measure ingredients carefully, 
and to be accurate in measurements is one of the first steps 
to success. Divided recipes often fail because not care- 
fully divided. 

A standard measuring cup holds just one-half pint of 
liquid or half a pound of butter or sugar, or one-fourth 
pound of flour. A level cup of any material is all the cup 
will hold. Fats should be packed solid or weighed. 
The cups are marked to indicate halves, fourths, and 
thirds. Kitchen equipment should include at least two of 
these cups. 

Measuring spoons come in sets containing tablespoons, 
half tablespoon, teaspoon, half and quarter teaspoons. 
The standard tablespoon or teaspoon may be used, but be 
sure measurements are level.

Culinary Terms and Methods 

The term mixing is a general one, and may mean stir- 
ring, beating, kneading, or folding and cutting, according 
to the dish under preparation and the quality and texture 
of the materials to be used. Stirring is the most general 
method used. Liquids are stirred while cooking; thin 
batters, such as pancakes, are mixed by stirring with a 
spoon. Cereals, jams, sauces, etc., are all mixed by 
stirring. 

Beating is the method used to lighten eggs, mix cakes, 
whip cream, etc. Beating may be done with a rotary egg 
beater, fork, egg whip or perforated wooden spoon. If 
using an egg whip, fork, or wooden spoon, the mixture is 
beaten to inclose a quantity of air. When using a rotary 
egg beater the ingredients are well mixed and light, but 
not nearly so much air is beaten into the mixture as when 
using the egg whip. 

Folding and cutting are usually applied to the manner 
in which eggs are added to cake, muffin, or waffle batters, 
souffles or puffy omelets. Sponge cakes made without 
baking powder depend upon the air beaten into the egg 
whites for lightness and texture, the air beaten into the 
eggs expanding with the heat of the oven. 

This rule also applies to souffles, prune whip, and 
puffy omelets. But unless extreme lightness is desired, 
eggs do not need to be beaten separately for muffin or 
waffle batters. By folding and cutting, eggs are added 
carefully to the mixture, the batter being turned over the 
beaten eggs until all have been folded in. If the eggs are 
stirred or beaten into the mixture, the result will not be as 
spongy and light. When the white of eggs and cream are 
beaten light and then added to a mixture, they must be 
carefully folded into the ingredients; otherwise it is use- 
less to beat them light; stirring or beating them into the 
mixture will undo all the previous beating. This method 
seems to be one of the least understood. 

Kneading is applied to the manner in which stiff doughs 
are handled. This term usually refers to yeast mixtures. 
After the ingredients have been mixed, the dough is turned 



MRS. DE GRAF'S COOK BOOK [IS] 

out on the molding board and kneaded. This is accom- 
plished by slightly flouring the board and hands, then one 
half the dough is folded over the other half, pressing down 
with the ball of the hand. 

The dough is turned constantly, and in this manner a 
new portion of dough is brought uppermost to fold over 
each time. This process is continued until the dough is 
smooth and elastic. Baking powder or soda raised doughs 
should be kneaded very lightly, if at all; otherwise they 
will not be light. 

Rolling is quite different from all other processes, and 
is used in making pies, biscuits, cookies, doughnuts, rolls, 
tarts, etc. Pastry should be rolled and handled quickly, 
and should always be rolled in one direction, and the rolling 
done as lightly as possible. 

Eggs and crumbs are used for croquettes, fish and other 
foods cooked in deep fat. The food to be fried is first 
dipped in fine bread or cracker crumbs, then in eggs, and 
in the crumbs a second time. The egg should be slightly 
beaten and one tablespoon of cold water added; or the egg 
white slightly beaten may be used instead of the whole egg. 

Moldiiig is used for charlotte russe, blanc mange, and 
gelatine mixtures. It also applies to certain types of 
frozen desserts. The mixture is poured into a wet mold or 
form, chilled, and then turned into the serving dish. The 
mold should stand perfectly level during the chilling, and 
when ready to remove, run a sharp knife or spatula around 
the edge of the form, turn over on a flat serving dish, 
shake the mold or tap lightly on the bottom, when the food 
should unmold. The form should always be thoroughly 
wet and cold when the mixture is poured into it. Dipping 
the mold in warm water for a second is another method of 
unmolding gelatine mixtures, or dipping in cold water to 
unmold frozen puddings. Warm water will soften the 
geletine mixture just enough to unmold it easily, and 
the cold water is so much warmer than the frozen mixture, 
it will have the same effect.

Cooking Processes 



Boiling 

Every housewife should possess a thorough knowledge 
of the various methods of applying heat to food. There 
is, for instance, a vast difference between boiling and sim- 
mering, and yet much good food has been completely 
ruined in the cooking because this difference was not 
understood. 

Boiling is the most generally used method of cooking; 
it is also one of the simplest and most economical. It 
means cooking the food in water at 212" Fahrenheit. 
Foods when properly boiled are both wholesome and 
digestible. 

There is also an impression that food will cook faster if 
the water boils violently. This is not the case, however, 
for as soon as water bubbles, it has reached the boiling 
point and it does not become any hotter because it boils 
violently. There is a waste of fuel in unnecessarily fast 
boiling, particularly when gas, electricity, or oil is used. 
When the boiling point has once been reached, it can 
easily be maintained with a reduced heat. 

Simmering 

Simmering food is keeping the liquid under the boiling 
point — a long, slow cooking process. This method is used 
for meat soup stocks and for making tender the cheaper, 
tough cuts of meat and old fowls. Boiling meat or fowl 
only toughens it; keeping at the simmering point will 
gradually make the meat tender and palatable. 

If soup stock is boiled, the stock will lack flavor, for 
boiling seals the surface, and if continued, keeps the juices 
in the meat; simmering will draw out the juices necessary 
in a good soup stock. 

The term "boiled meat" is really incorrect. While the 
meat is plunged into boiling water to seal the surface and 
keep the juices from escaping, it is cooked at the simmer- 
ing point. 

The housekeeper who learns the value of simmering will 
always be able to serve well cooked meats at comparatively 



MRS. DE GRAF'S COOK BOOK [17] 

small cost, for the less tender cuts of meat are just as high 
in food value as the more expensive parts. 

Steaming 

By this method food is cooked in the vapor arising from 
boiling water, and it is the most gradual of all methods. 
The water under the food must be kept constantly boiling 
and the steamer containing the food should be closely 
covered so as to retain all the steam. This gradual heat 
renders many foods more digestible than when boiled. 
None of the nutriment is lost, as when food is immersed in 
water. Steamed foods retain all their food value and 
flavor. 

Stewing 

Stewing is cooking food in a small amount of liquid at 
the simmering point, closely covered, until it becomes 
tender. Stewed meat or chicken is a sort of combination 
meat and soup, for the gravy is always served as part of 
the dish. Food is cut in small pieces for stewing, and the 
cooking takes less time than for one large piece of meat or 
a whole fowl. Stewing is an economical method of cook- 
ing, because the cheaper tough cuts of meat may be used. 
All the nutriment is retained, and the slow cooking renders 
the food entirely digestible. 

Braising 

Braising is a combination of stewing and roasting, and 
is used for meats — usually the less tender roasts. The 
meat is cooked with less liquid than for boiling, and is 
cooked in one solid piece. Braising may be accomplished 
on top of the fire, using a heavy kettle, closely covered, or 
in the oven in a covered pan. The meat is first browned 
in drippings, or other fat; then a small quantity of liquid is 
added, which is slowly reduced to a rich gravy. Occasional 
basting is required if the meat is to be juicy and fine in 
flavor. The toughest cut of meat will become tender by 
this method. When meat is braised in an iron kettle 
over the fire, it is frequently called a pot roast. 

Roasting 

Roasting really means cooking over hot coals, or in hot 



[18] MRS. DE GRAF'S COOK BOOK 

ashes. Oven roasting is the more modern method of 
cooking meats, although the open fire and hot coals are 
still preferred by many cooks. 

The oven should be hot when the meat is put into it, 
and kept hot for about fifteen minutes. By that time the 
surface of the meat should be seared to prevent the escape 
of the juices. The heat should then be reduced and the 
cooking continued. Frequent basting is essential, as it 
prevents the meat becoming dry. 

Broiling or Grilling 

Broiling is one of the quickest methods of cooking 
foods. It is really a form of roasting, but is used for meat 
with greater surface but seldom more than two inches in 
thickness — often less. Red-hot coals or the well-heated 
broiler of a gas or electric range are required. The, object 
is to sear over both sides as quickly as possible without 
burning, in order to retain the rich juices. After searing, 
the heat should be reduced and the cooking continued as 
long as desired, turning once or twice if beef, chops, or 
chicken are being broiled. 

Planking 

Planking meat or fish is practically a form of broiling. 
The food is first seared on both sides in the broiler, then 
finished on the heated plank in a hot oven. The wood 
imparts a pleasing flavor, and the plank itself offers an 
opportunity for attractive garnishes. 

Baking 

Baking is accomplished in the oven with various degrees 
of heat. The difference between baking and broiling food 
is that one is cooked in a dry heat, and the other is cooked 
in moist heat. 

Frying 

There are three methods of frying foods: immersing in 
deep, hot fat; sauteing, or cooking in_ a small amount of 
fat in a frying pan; or pan broiling, which is done in a very 
hot pan without fat, but turning frequently to avoid 
burning. 



MRS. DE GRAF'S COOK BOOK [19] 

Everyday Mistakes in Cooking 

When strong flavored vegetables, such as cabbage, 
cauliflower, or onions, lose their color, are rather strong in 
flavor and throw off" an unpleasant odor while cooking, the 
vegetable has not been put to cook in boiling water and 
the kettle in which it was cooked has been covered. Never 
start vegetables cooking in water under the boiling point. 
For the strong flavored vegetables use a quantity of water, 
but for the green, more delicate flavored ones use little 
water; add salt before the vegetables and cook in an un- 
covered kettle and they will retain their full flavor and 
bright green color. When a quantity of water is used to 
cook such vegetables as peas, spinach, string beans, etc., 
much of the valuable properties of the food are lost and 
thrown away. Many vegetables are overcooked until the 
best flavor is entirely destroyed. Cabbage is an example; 
it is usually cooked until limp and heavy, and while it may 
taste palatable, is most indigestible. Cabbage cooks very 
quickly and is done when tender. 

Mayonnaise dressing separates if the oil is added too 
quickly or if all the ingredients are not of the same temper- 
ature. 

A teaspoonful of vinegar or lemon juice added to the egg 
yolks before any of the oil is used will aid in keeping the 
dressing smooth. If the dressing should curdle add it very 
slowly to another egg yolk. 

French dressing should be thick. This is easily accom- 
plished by putting all the ingredients in a small covered 
fruit jar and shaking until the mixture thickens. 

Fried foods, as croquettes, fritters, doughnuts, etc., be- 
come soaked with fat if the oil or lard they are fried in was 
not sufficiently heated. The temperature of the fat should 
be tested before any food is fried, and this should be re- 
peated each time food is added, as the fat usually cools 
somewhat with each addition of cold food. Heat fat until 
a faint trace of smoke can be seen over the surface, then 
test. It should never be heated until the kitchen is filled 
with an unpleasant haze of smoke. If properly done, deep 



[20] MRS. DE GRAF'S COOK BOOK 

fat frying will be more satisfactory and food will absorb 
less fat than when cooked in a frying pan. 

Sauces and gravies have a layer of fat on top when more 
fat is used than flour. The flour and fat should be in equal 
quantities; allow from 1 to 2 tablespoonfuls of each to a 
cupful of liquid, according to the thickness desired for the 
sauce. 

Omelets are tough when cooked too rapidly. Dump- 
lings are heavy if the liquid is not kept constantly boiling 
and if the cover of the kettle does not fit closely or has been 
removed before the dumplings are cooked. They should 
be dropped into rapidly boiling liquid, covered closely and 
cooked 12 minutes before cover is removed. 

True sponge cakes (those made without baking powder) 
are coarse in texture and dry if eggs are not carefully beaten 
with a whip egg beater to inclose all the air possible, then 
baked in a very moderate oven. 

Baking powder biscuits, muflins and all quick breakfast 
breads require a hot oven or they will not be light. 

Popover and cream puff^s fall when they have not been 
baked long enough. 

Cakes that rise in the center and crack have been baked 
in too hot an oven or contain too much flour. 

Cakes that are soggy in the center have not been 
thoroughly baked. The center is the last part to bake, and 
before removing from the oven touch the center lightly; 
if the finger makes an imprint the cake is not baked 
sufficiently; if it springs back the cake is done. 

To prevent milk from separating when making a cream 
of tomato soup, heat milk and add the thickening. Com- 
bine milk and tomatoes just before serving. 

Boiled or baked custards that have curdled have been 
cooked too fast or too long. A boiled custard that has 
curdled may be redeemed by pouring the mixture imme- 
diately into a cold bowl and beating until smooth with a 
rotary egg beater. It will never be quite so creamy, how- 
ever. Baked custard and all forms of custard puddings 
should be set in a pan of hot water to bake. This will 
usually prevent too rapid cooking. The water is kept 
below the boiling point. 



MRS. DE GRAF'S COOK BOOK [21] 

Fruit cake is light in color if baked too rapidly; it is also 
apt to be bitter. 

Cereals should be cooked in boiling water. They should 
cook directly over the fire for 5 minutes; then cook over 
hot water (in a double boiler) for the time required. Cereal 
cannot be completely cooked directly over the flame, as it 
soon thickens and then will bum. The starch requires 
cooking to be digestible, and cooking over hot water is the 
only method whereby it is possible to cook cereal sufli- 
ciently. 

These are only a few suggestions, and yet the success 
of cookery depends much upon such details, unimportant 
as they seem. 



[22] MRS. DE GRAF'S COOK BOOK 



Oven Regulation 



The importance of oven regulation cannot be over- 
estimated. Good food can easily be completely ruined in 
baking. A tender, juicy roast can be changed into a tough, 
dry piece of meat. Perfectly made pastry may become 
tough and soggy in the baking. Breakfast breads will be 
light or heavy, depending upon the oven heat. All this 
has been realized by many stove manufacturers, and de- 
vices have been installed which will guide the housewife 
in the operation of the oven. Tables of temperatures refer 
to a thermometer placed inside the oven, as near the center 
as possible. These figures cannot always be followed ex- 
actly, with the attachments placed in oven doors, etc. 
But a very little study will soon enable the operator to 
know just what the indicator should register for the diiFer- 
ent heats. For example, biscuits require a hot oven, 4S0 
degrees Fahrenheit. This would mean the degrees of heat 
registered by a thermometer placed in the oven. A 
thermometer placed on the oven door would be affected 
by the colder air of the room, so it would probably be 
necessary to allow the indicator to reach SCX) degrees 
Fahrenheit. This can readily be determined after a few 
trials. For these attachments the table of temperatures 
will only serve as a guide. For those who have no oven 
regulator, and who experience difficulty in managing the 
oven, I would suggest purchasing an oven thermometer. 
It will soon pay for itself in the saving of food, will give 
the inexperienced housewife more confidence, and enable 
her to attempt dishes she formerly felt were impossible. 

A gas oven should not be lighted until just before it is 
to be used, depending upon how hot an oven is desired. 
With two burners lighted, 8 to 10 minutes should make 
the oven very hot, and S to 6 minutes is sufficient for a 
medium heat. Of course, this will vary somewhat, 
depending on the type of range and the quality and 
pressure of the gas. 

All food materials are poor conductors of heat, and it 
takes time for the heat to penetrate. The length of time 
and temperature will depend upon the size and thickness 



MRS. DE GRAF'S COOK BOOK [23] 

of the food. A cake.baked in a brick-shaped pan — pro- 
ducing a cake like a loaf of bread, high and narrow — will 
take twice as long to bake as the same cake baked in a 
shallow pan. The brick-shaped loaf also requires much 
more skill to bake than does the cake baked in a shallow 
pan. In baking flour mixtures, the larger the mass the 
lower the temperature must be in order to have the heat 
penetrate to the center before a crust has been formed. 
If a cake is placed in too hot an oven, it forms a crust 
before it has risen sufficiently. This affects the texture 
of the cake and produces a cake high in the center and 
thin on the edges. It can readily be seen that it is neces- 
sary to overbake the cake at the edges in order to bake 
the center. This will mean a waste, because the edges will 
be either burned or so crisp and hard it must be removed. 

Thin loaves of bread or cake and small pieces of meat 
need much less time for cooking, because the heat pene- 
trates quickly. Mixtures containing much sugar or molasses 
burn easily. Foods containing a large proportion of eggs 
require a low temperature, or they will become tough. An 
oven filled with food from which a quantity of steam is 
being given off requires more heat than when only one 
small dish of food is being baked. 

When roasting meat, the careful housewife will plan to 
utilize the heat for other foods, too — potatoes, pudding, 
or even vegetables. If the meat is to be broiled, then 
advantage should be taken of the hot oven, having bis- 
cuits, cornbread, or a shortcake. A little study will work 
out all these problems and lessen both the fuel bills and 
labor. 

Most housewives use too hot an oven, particularly when 
gas is used. One must bear in mind that if the gas is 
left burning high, the oven heat will increase very rapidly. 
After the oven has reached the heat desired — hot, medium, 
or slow — turn the gas down until just a small flame is 
visible. The oven will then maintain an even heat. Of 
course, it will be necessary to vary this rule somewhat, 
depending upon the size and quantity of the food and how 
long it is to be baked. Very few foods require a hot oven 
for any length of time. A tender roast of meat needs a 
hot oven to cause it to brown at once, so as to form a 



[24] MRS. DE GRAF'S COOK BOOK 

crust which will keep the juices from escaping. As soon 
as this crust is formed (10 to IS minutes), the heat should 
be reduced and only a medium oven is necessary for the 
remainder of the cooking. Biscuits require a hot oven for 
the entire time of baking — about 18 minutes for the 
medium-sized ones. All other breakfast breads need a 
fairly hot oven. Cakes need only a medium oven, and the 
richer the cake batter, the slower the mixture should bake. 

Wood and coal ranges are regulated in about the same 
manner, the oven being heated to the right temperature 
beforehand and adding more fuel in small quantities only 
as required to keep an even heat. 

To test the oven without a thermometer, take a piece 
of white paper. Place in the oven after it has been heated 
10 minutes, reducing the heat, if using gas. If the paper 
bums black in 5 minutes, the oven is very hot; if it bums 
a deep brown, it is hot. For the medium oven the paper 
should be a golden brown in 5 minutes. For a slow oven 
it should barely turn the most delicate brown in 5 minutes. 

AH of these tests need a little study, and each person 
will have to work out their own problem, but these guides 
are an aid in regulating the oven.

Menu Building 



Planning meals day after day is one of the most difficult 
tasks for the housewife, and this particular branch of the 
housekeeping system needs as much skill and judgment as 
the preparation and cooking of foods. With an almost 
unlimited variety of foods to choose from, the housewife 
should know how to select those foods which will prove 
nutritious and give the greatest return of energy to the 
body for the money she has to spend. Wise economy 
demands that foods should be so combined that there will 
be no waste of either material or energy. 

In order to plan foods wisely, the housewife should 
understand how the various foods differ in nutritive values. 
The foods selected depend largely upon climate and season. 
In localities where the summer months are warm, foods 
which would be very acceptable in winter would prove 
anything but appetizing served on a hot day. 

A generous amount of fat and starch may be served 
when the weather is cold, but these must be avoided during 
the summer, green salads, jellied soups, and light cold 
desserts or fruits taking their places. 

Dishes containing the food principles in the same pro- 
portion should not be served together. A well-balanced 
meal contains neither too much protein, starch, sugar, or 
fat. 

To meet this requirement, the housewife must have 
some knowledge of food values. The substances found in 
foods have been divided into five classes, called food 
principles. These are water, fat, mineral matter, starch 
and sugar (called carbohydrates), and protein. Scarcely 
any food is made up of any one of these food principles, 
almost all containing several in combination. Most of the 
fat is obtained in butter, olive oil, other oils, and fat of 
meats, etc. The use of fat to the body is to give energy 
and heat. If more fat is taken than is required for im- 
mediate use, it is stored in the body ready to use when 
sufficient fat has not been consumed. 

Mineral matter is found in most of the vegetables, and 
in all fruits; also in meat and milk. In fact, nearly all 



[26] MRS. DE GRAF'S COOK BOOK 

foods contain some mineral salts. As a rule this require- 
ment is taken care of in the diet of the average adult, but 
food for growing children should contain a quantity of 
mineral matter. 

Sugar and starch comes under one headmg, as starch is 
changed into sugar in the process of digestion. These foods 
supply heat and energy to the body, and the amount 
necessary for an individual will depend largely upon the 
kind of work he does. For heavy, muscular labor and for 
active, growing children, more starch and sugar are re- 
quired than for the clerk, student, or elderly person. 

Protein is the most important food principle, and the 
foremost protein foods are meat, fish, eggs, milk, cheese, 
and most varieties of nuts. There are a few vegetables 
rich in protein as well as starch. These are peas, beans, 
and lentils. When planning a meal with a limited serv- 
ing qf meat, as when using left-overs, any one of these 
vegetables will supply the necessary protein. Beans, 
cooked with some fat, may entirely take the place of meat. 

If the menu is rich in starch, select a vegetable contain- 
ing a high percentage of water. Do not serve two dishes 
at one meal where a cream sauce has been used — for 
example, a creamed soup and a creamed vegetable, or 
creamed fish or meat and creamed vegetable or soup. 
Never serve strong flavored vegetables together, such as 
onions, cauliflower, cabbage, turnips, or parsnips. Do not 
have rice, macaroni, or potatoes served at one meal. 

A green salad should be served with a heavy dinner. A 
hearty salad of fish or meat, combined with mayonnaise 
dressing, supplies the main course at luncheon or supper, 
but is much too heavy for a dinner where meat and 
vegetables are served. With a main dish of macaroni and 
cheese, prepared with a cream sauce (a dish rich in protein 
and starch), such vegetables as spinach, a green salad, or 
tomatoes, cooked or raw, will prove appetizing, while any 
of the beans, dried or green, would make the meal too 
heavy.

Food Value of Fat 



Fat is one of the most important foods, as it is the 
greatest source of reserve energy. It is also required to lu- 
bricate the body and when taken in reasonable quantities 
is easily digested by persons in normal health. Starch is 
digested mainly in the mouth; protein (lean meat, eggs, 
cheese, fish) in the stomach; fats are changed but little 
until they reach the small intestine, then they are divided 
into tiny portions and are carried to the blood. Fats rank 
in digestibility as follows: first butter and cream, then 
olive oil; other vegetable oils such as cottonseed, com and 
peanut oil; oleomargarine, beef fat and last the various pork 
fats. Margarines are used as butter substitutes and rank 
with butter in fuel value in proportion to fat content. But 
butter contains the valuable fat soluble vitamines so 
necessary to growth, especially of children. Margarines do 
not possess this quality, so are not as desirable to use in 
children's diet, although the adult may use margarine in 
place of butter, as the diet for the normal grown person will 
include these vitamines in other foods. 

Nature has taught us to take fats in combination with 
other foods, as it is more palatable in that form. We 
spread butter on bread, or steak, and add it to boiled 
vegetables, potatoes, etc., or cut with an acid we pour oils 
oyer lettuce. Anything which aids in the division of the 
oil, helps in its digestion and assimilation. From this it 
would seem that pastry might not be indigestible. But as 
already stated starch is digested mainly in the mouth, and 
if the starch or flour in pastry be mixed with layers of fat, 
how can the saliva permeate through these layers and 
digest the starch? Well made, light flaky pastry can be 
eaten in moderation without causing mdigestion, but 
pastry should not be served too frequently. 

When using fat for cooking do not allow it to become 
over-heated. Fats heated to the smoking point become 
decomposed; when such fat is eaten it can be an irritation 
which produces indigestion. The temperature of different 
fats vary. Butter when heated to the point when it 
bubbles and foams is about the heat of boiling water. If 



MRS. DE GRAF'S COOK BOOK [29] 

heated beyond the bubbling point, it is considerably 
hotter than the boiling point of water. If fat bubbles when 
heated, there is water present and it is the water which is 
boiling; when the fat ceases to boil the water has been 
evaporated and the fat is ready to use. Since fat when 
over-cooked is very unwholesome, it is essential to know 
how to use this important food so that it will be beneficial 
and not a detriment by daily use. 

As fats have more than twice the energy value of the 
other food principles, there is no reason to question their 
general, wholesomeness. The housewife will need to 
consider how much and in what form fats should be given 
to her family. Only a certain amount is needed for im- 
mediate use in the body, the excess consumed being stored 
for future use. Butter, cream and quantities of whole milk 
are the best fats for children, and foods cooked in hot fat 
should not be given children at all. 

How to Render Fat 

Remove all skin and membrane. Put leaf lard or beef 
suet through the food chopper then place in the upper part 
of a double boiler and set over boiling water. This is a 
quick method and the fat will remain white. A very good 
combination is to use 1 part leaf lard to 2 parts beef suet. 
When the fat is rendered drain through a fine sieve or 
cheese cloth and set aside to cool. When cold but still 
in liquid form beat with a whip egg beater until the fat is 
firm and white. This mixture if beaten in this manner 
does not become tallowy and hard. If lard is not liked use 
}4 ^om oil. This fat can be used as a shortening for pastry 
or biscuit doughs or for frying.

Composition of Tea 




[xcEPT for the sugar and cream that may be taken 
with it, tea possesses no nutritive qualities. It 
is somewhat stimulating and very mildly exhila- 
rating. The stimulating principle, theine, and 
the essential oil, which gives fragrance, are the desirable 
elements. Tannin, a bitter astringent substance, is the 
undesirable element. The problem in making tea is to 
bring out the stimulating qualities and fragrant oil, and 
to avoid the tannin. This can only be-^accomplished by 
pouring freshly boiling water over the tea for five minutes. 
Water under the boiling point will not develop the flavor, 
and if the leaves remain in the water over five minutes, 
the tannin is apparent. If the leaves are boiled, tannin 
will be extracted in quantity. 

Making of Tea 

By freshly boiling water is meant water freshly drawn 
and boiled at once. Using a tea ball is one of the best 
methods to make tea. It can be attached to the cover or 
nozzle of the tea pot by the chain, and at the end of five 
minutes, be withdrawn. Scald the pot before setting 
away, and again before using. The proper proportion of 
tea will vary with the quality and taste. Usually one 
teaspoonful will be ample for each cup of freshly boiled 
water. Earthenware, china, silver, or aluminum are all 
satisfactory materials for a tea pot. 

Coffee 

Coffee has no food value except when milk and sugar 
are used. Tannin is also present in coffee, but in less 
quantity than in tea, and is not extracted so readily as 
from the more delicate tea leaves. When roasting, the 
beans throw off moisture and develop flavor. Coffee also 
possesses a mildly stimulating effect, due to caffeine and 
the essential oil. To make good coffee requires a pure 
brand of coffee and a .perfectly clean coffee pot, free 
from discolorations. 



MRS. DE GRAF'S COOK BOOK [33] 

To Make Coffee in a Coffee Pot 

Allow 1 tablespoon of medium ground coffee for each 
cup of boiling water. Heat the pot, add coffee, then pour 
over the boiling water; set over the fire, bring to the boiling 
point, and remove from the fire. Let stand in a warm 
place for S minutes. Add J^ cup of cold water to make the 
coffee clear. When made by this method, coffee contains 
a minimum amount of caffeine and tannin. 

Percolator Coffee 

The old fashioned coffee pot has been replaced by the 
more modern percolator. For this method of coffee 
making, the beans should be ground very fine. Allow 
1 tablespoonful of the finely ground coffee for each cupful 
of water used. Set over the fire and let percolate about 
5 minutes, according to the strength desired. Hot or 
cold water may be used. 

Filtered Coffee 

This method of making coffee is preferred by many 
persons. It requires a special pot, and full directions for 
making are furnished with each pot. The essentials are 
a heated pot and boiling water. 

Cocoa and Chocolate 

Theobromine is the stimulating element in cocoa beans, 
and is much less pronounced in its effect than the corre- 
sponding principles in tea and coffee. The high percentage 
of fat, together with other food principles, places this 
beverage in the class with foods. As a rule, when making 
cocoa or chocolate, follow the recipes found on the package. 
It will be well to bear in mind, however, that boiling will 
greatly improve it. Beating constantly with an egg 
beater while cooking will thoroughly mix the ingredients 
and prevent a thin skin from rising to the surface. 

Beef Tea 

Like tea, coffee, and chocolate, there is a principle in 
meat which is stimulating. These are soluble in 
water, and when extracted, make a beverage which 
stimulates the appetite. Being easily digested, beef tea is 
good for convalescents and beneficial when one is tired. 



[34] MRS. DE GRAF'S COOK BOOK 

How to Make Beef Tea 

J^ pound of round of beef. J^ teaspoon of salt. 

2 cups of cold water. 

Put meat through the food chopper. Cover with water, 
add salt, and let stand an hour. Put in the upper part of a 
double boiler, fill the under part with cold water, set the 
meat over it, and cook over the water about 2 hours, 
keeping the water underneath below the boiling point. 
Strain and serve. 

Cool, Refreshing Drinks 

All fruit juices make refreshing drinks and punches. 
The fruit syrups may be made and some kinds can be pur- 
chased ready for use. The best lemonade is made from 
prepared syrup in the proportion of two cups each of water 
and sugar and a thin shaving of lemon peel boiled for 
about ten minutes, removing any scum which may gather 
on the surface; cool and add the juice of six to eight lemons. 
Allow two tablespoons of the lemon syrup for each glass 
of water. 

Partially fill each glass with shaved or crushed ice be- 
fore pouring in the lemonade. If one does not possess an 
ice shaver have a small, stout canvas bag and pound the 
ice to the consistency of snow. This insures the mixture 
cooling at once and adds greatly to the attractiveness of 
the drink. This only applies to cool drinks served in tall 
glasses, and not those served from a punch bowl. 

Chocolate syrup is made by taking J^ cup of ground 
chocolate, two cups of sugar and one cup boiling water. 
Mix and boil about 5 minutes. Cool, add 1 teaspoon 
vanilla and store in a tightly covered jar or bottle. For 
iced chocolate use 1 tablespoon syrup to ^ cup of milk; 
pour over shaved or pounded ice and put a tablespoon 
whipped cream on top. 

A chocolate eggnog is particularly refreshing and nour- 
ishing as well, and can be given to both old and young. 
Beat 1 egg white very stiff, then add gradually, while 
constantly beating, 1 tablespoon ground chocolate and a 
few grains of salt; take out about J^ of this mixture, and 
to remaining portion add gradually 1 cup cold milk, con- 



MRS. DE GRAF'S COOK BOOK [35] 

stantly beating. Put the remainder of the mixture on top 
and serve. 

Coffee syrup is useful to have on hand also. Make 1 
pint of strong coffee; strain, add 2 cups sugar and boil 
about S minutes. Cool and store in a bottle or tightly 
covered jar. Use 2 tablespoons of the coffee syrup to ^ 
cup milk, pour over shaved ice and add 1 tablespoon cream 
either whipped or plain; a little nutmeg may be sprinkled 
over the top. Both the iced chocolate and coffee make 
excellent warm-weather luncheon drinks and offer a change 
from the usual iced tea. And, by the way, iced tea should 
be made fresh and used at once if it is to be at its best. 
Always make tea with water which has been freshly 
boiled. For iced tea make a little stronger than usual, 
and steep only 4 minutes, then pour in tall glasses ^ full 
of shaved or crushed ice. Add thin slices of lemon and 
pass powdered sugar. For a tea punch chill tea; add 34 
as much lemon juice as tea. Keep very cold and just 
before serving add 1 small bottle of ginger ale for every 2 
quarts of tea. 

For those persons who enjoy the flavor of chocolate, but 
do not care to indulge in fattening foods, cocoa may be 
freely used. Cocoa is almost free of the rich fats contained 
in chocolate. 

Orange Julip 

3 oranges. 2 cups boiling water. 

1 grapefruit. 1 pint ginger ale. 

1 cup sugar. 1 spray fresh mint. 

Extract orange and grapefruit juice. Boil sugar and 
water 5 minutes; cool and add to fruit juice. Just before 
serving add ginger ale. Fill bottom of glass with crushed 
ice, add a small bit of the bruised mint, then fill glasses 
with liquid. Thin quartered slices of orange or cherries 
may be added. 

Honolulu Fizz 

For each service allow: J^ cup pineapple juice, J^ cup 
sparkling cider, 1 egg white, tiny spray mint crushed.

Fruit Essential in the Daily Diet 

Fruit is really indispensable in a well regulated diet. 
Formerly it was considered an accessory, rather than an 
essential food, and was eaten mainly for its flavor and re- 
freshing qualities. The food value of most fruits is not 
high, but the mineral salts they contain are necessary to 
good health. A person who eats quantities of fruit is 
usually in excellent health and has a clear cornplexion, due 
to the body regulating qualities of the various mineral 
salts and organic acids contained in fruit. These organic 
acids impart an agreeable acid flavor and help to keep 
the blood in good condition. Most fruits contain a large 
proportion of water, also of value in the diet. 

The digestibility of fruit depends upon both the nature 
of the fruit and its degree of ripeness. Neither under nor 
over ripe fruits are fit to eat raw. The over-ripe fruit 
should be discarded, as it is unfit to use under any condi- 
tion; the under-ripe fruit may be cooked and then is 
easily digested. Starch is present in unripe fruit, but is 
changed in the ripe fruit into sugar and gums. 

Uncooked starch is not easily digested, while just the 
opposite is true of the fruit sugars, which very seldom cause 
digestive troubles, such as may be produced from cane 
sugar. Eating under-ripe fruit often causes serious results, 
especially when eaten by children. In the unripe condition 
the starch has not been changed to sugar, and the fruit, 
being very firm, is probably not masticated completely, 
making it still harder to digest. A ripe peach would be 
more easily digested than a firm apple, even though the 
apple were perfectly ripe. 

Prunes, figs, dates, raisins, and bananas have a higher 
food value than other fruits. All these, excepting the 
banana, contain a quantity of sugar, as well as mineral 
salts. Bananas are largely starch, and for this reason 
should be perfectly ripe or cooked before eating. All 
children are especially fond of bananas, but it is much safer 
to bake this fruit than to allow them to eat it raw, for it is 
usually sold under-ripe. When the banana is in a fit con- 
dition to eat raw, the skin has become dark and the 



MRS. DE GRAF'S COOK BOOK [39] 

pulp dry and mealy. Cooking is really a ripening process, 
and fruits not sufficiently ripe to eat raw are wholesome 
after cooking. 

Raw fruits have a much greater tonic value than the 
cooked fruit, but to many persons the raw fruit is indigest- 
ible; and as cooking softens the fruit and converts the 
starch into sugar, it is then more easily digested. As the 
cooking process drives out the mineral salts and acids into 
the liquid in which the fruit is cooked, this juice must be 
served with the fruit, or much of its value is lost. Many of 
the valuable mineral salts are found just beneath the skin, 
so these should be retained as far as possible. 

Most children naturally crave fruit, and this desire 
should be gratified and not considered an indulgence. It is 
nature's way of demanding this health-giving, bone-build- 
ing material. Even babies, after three months old, are 
given small quantities of orange or prune juice, gradually 
increasing the amount as the child grows older. Fruit 
beverages offer an opportunity to introduce acids and salts 
into the system. These are always found refreshing. Do 
not serve too sweet, or they will not quench the thirst. 

Uncooked acid fruits should not be served in combi- 
nation with starchy foods, as this frequently causes indi- 
gestion. If cereal is to be served in combination with fruit, 
the fruit should be cooked, or of a variety which is sweet, 
not acid. As fruit contains a quantity of water, very little 
should be used when cooking. Sugar should not be added 
until the fruit is cooked. 

Dried fruits should be thoroughly cleaned, then soaked in 
water to cover for several hours, in order to regain the mois- 
ture which has been evaporated. They should be cooked 
in the liquid in which they were soaked, heating very 
slowly and keeping under the boiling point until tender. 
The slow cooking develops the natural fruit sugars. Prunes, 
raisins, and figs will require no sugar. Other dried fruits 
may need a small quantity. 

Fruit salads offer splendid opportunities for serving both 
fresh and cooked fruits. Such salads may be served as a 
salad course or used for dessert. Fruit cocktails are pala- 
table and serve as an appetizer for dinner. 



[40] MRS. DE GRAF'S COOK BOOK 

The addition of sugar to cooked fruit greatly increases 
its nutritive value and cooking sugar at a high temperature 
in conjunction with the acid of the fruit brings about the 
inversion of the sugar, which is one of the first steps in its 
digestion. 

For this reason jams, marmalades, and preserves are 
considered one of the most wholesome ways in which sugar 
may be eaten. 

If the family does not care for fruits between meals, which 
is really one of the best times to eat them, see that fruit in 
some form is furnished for at least one meal a day, for it is a 
necessary part of the daily diet. Do not consider fruit an 
extravagance and an accessory. If we are to have healthy 
bodies, fruit is an essential, and although its actual food 
value, if fresh, is not high, its health-giving properties are 
a necessity. 

Orange or Grapefruit in Sections 

Cut the orange peel in eighths from the stem nearly to 
the blossom end. Carefully loosen the peel, then the sec- 
tions of orange. Place on a serving plate, placing a table- 
spoon of powdered sugar in the center. The peel may be 
made to form a border by rolling the points inward around 
the base of the orange. 

Oranges and Grapefruit 

Cut fruit in halves crosswise. Cut a small slice from the 
end so fruit will stand level. Loosen the pulp with a sharp 
knife, or grapefruit knife. Remove center pith and mem- 
brane with scissors. 

To Remove Pulp of Orange and Grapefruit for 
Salads and Cocktails 

Peel the fruit with a sharp knife, cutting close enough to 
the fruit so that the juice will run. Cut out each section with 
a sharp pointed knife. There will be very little waste and 
each section should be whple, 



MRS. DE GRAF'S COOK BOOK [41] 

Fresh Fruit Cocktail 

Select grapefruit, oranges, bananas, pineapple and white 
grapes when in season. Use about equal portions of each. 
Remove all seeds, membrane and skin. Chill thoroughly, 
sweeten if necessary or add maraschino syrup. Arrange in 
cocktail glasses; place a cherry on top of each glass. Serve 
very cold. 

Strawberries Au Naturel 

Wash berries carefully but do not hull. Drain until 
dry. Place a tablespoon of powdered sugar in the center 
of individual service plates. Arrange strawberries around 
the sugar and serve. 

Melon Cocktail 

Have equal quantities of chilled cantaloupe and water- 
melon. Cut into balls with a small French vegetable 
cutter or cut into half-inch cubes. Arrange in cocktail 
glasses; sprinkle lightly with salt. 

Melons 

Serve all varieties of melons very cold. Cut watermelon 
in halves and remove the fruit of each in one piece. Cut in 
sections the shape of a piece of pie, remove seeds and 
serve. This method disposes of much of the water so 
awkward if served on the rind. 

Sliced Oranges 

Peel oranges with a sharp knife; slice very thin cross- 
wise. Arrange on individual plates, sprinkle with powdered 
iigar and serve very cold. 



sugar and serve very ' 



Sliced Peaches 

Scald fruit 1 minute with boiling water. Dip in cold 
water and remove skins. If to stand before serving, 
sprinkle with sugar and lemon juice to prevent discolora- 
tion. 



[42] MRS. DE GRAF'S COOK BOOK 

Sliced Bananas 

Select ripe fruit. Remove skin and scrape outside of the 
fruit. Slice very thin. Do not prepare until shortly before 
being served. 



Fruit Cocktail, with Sauce 

Remove the pulp from grapefruit and mix with diced 
pineapple, diced apple and sliced banana. Allow J^ cup of 
mixture to each serving. Chill thoroughly, add cocktail 
sauce, also chilled, and serve in grapefruit or red apple 
shells or glasses. 

Sauce for Fruit Cocktail 

14, cup tomato cocktail sauce or 2 tablespoons orange juice, 

catsup. ]/s teaspoon each of salt, pa- 

yi cup white grapejulce. prika, sugar and cloves. 

1 tablespoon lemon juice. }^ teaspoon cinnamon. 

Mix thoroughly and chill. 



Prunes — Stewed 

Wash prunes, cover with warm water and soak for 
several hours, over night if possible. Heat slowly in water 
(in which they were soaked) to simmering point and cook 
under boiling point until tender. Rapid cooking destroys 
the flavor and appearance of the fruit. Prunes may be 
flavored with a small stick of cinnamon or a little lemon 
or orange peel. Slow cooking develops the natural fruit 
sugars and little if any sugar is required; if sugar is used, 
add after prunes are cooked but while still hot; or remove 
prunes, add sugar to juice and simmer until juice is some- 
what thickened. A fireless cooker is excellent for cooking 
prunes. Soak as directed above; then heat to the boiling 
point and set in the fireless (without a heated stone) for 
several hours. 



MRS. DE GRAF'S COOK BOOK [43] 

Prune Juice 

Wash prunes, cover with warm water and let stand over 
night. Heat very slowly to simmering point, cook until 
tender; don't boil. No sugar is required. Pour off juice, 
straining through fine sieve. The prunes left can be used 
for prune desserts requiring prune pulp. 



[44] MRS. DE GRAF'S COOK BOOK 

Garnishes 

To garnish a dish attractively or serve it in an appealing 
form adds very little to its cost, takes no very great amount 
of time, and makes the food so much more pleasing in 
every way. There is nothing which so quickly indicates 
the interest the housewife takes in cooking as the manner 
in which she serves food. One who has no pride in her 
work seldom gives thought to garnishing. Daintily 
served foods encourage appetite and aid digestion. This is 
why an invalid's tray should always have special atten- 
tion, for the tastefully decorated, carefully prepared food 
may tempt a delicate appetite. Convalescent children can 
often be induced to eat food which appeals to their imagi- 
nation, where otherwise the dish would be rejected. A 
marshmallow in a hot cup of cocoa, chocolate or milk may 
be just the thing to make the beverage desirable. 

Many busy home makers are unable to give either time 
or thought to elaborate garnishings, but all food may be 
arranged with some sort of symmetry which enhances its 
appetite appeal. Mashed potatoes may be easily arranged 
in a ring on a flat serving dish and the center opening left 
large enough to hold buttered peas, string beans, oi 
asparagus tips. The dish looks attractive and is as quickly 
done as arranging in two separate dishes, and there is one 
less dish to be washed. 

Chops or cutlets can be placed on the platter, one over- 
lapping the other in the center of the dish; or placed in a 
circle on the platter and the center filled with buttered 
peas or mashed potatoes. If roasted potatoes are on the 
menu use as a garnish on the platter surrounding the meat. 
Or perhaps boiled rice is to take the place of potatoes; if so 
butter a custard cup, fill with hot rice, turn out at once 
on the meat platter and repeat until all the rice is used, or 
arrange in a ring. Thin slices of fried bacon make a good 
relish as well as garnish for meat or egg dishes. For 
special occasions mashed potatoes can be shaped into 
individual cup-shaped forms, brushed over with beaten 
egg and then browned nicely on the top grate of a rather 
hot^oven; fill the center with a cooked vegetable. If 



MRS. DE GRAF'S COOK BOOK [45] 

stuffed tomatoes are to be the vegetable, use these as a 
garnish for the roast. Fried eggplant may be used in the 
same manner. Slices of tomato, raw or dipped in crumbs 
and fried, are nice served with fried or baked fish or broiled 
chicken. In fact, these are only a few suggestions as to 
the possibilities for serving food in an appealing way, for 
everyday use, which will not require additional labor, such 
a factor in these days when there are so many interesting 
things to do. 

If food is prepared especially for garnishing, it should 
always be eatable. Sandwiches tied with ribbons and 
attractive bows may make a pretty table, but are certainly 
not practical. Have all the decorations desired on the 
table, but not on the food unless it is edible. 

Slices of hard cooked eggs surrounding a mold of 
spinach; radishes cut attractively or plain olives, ripe, 
green, stuffed; slices of lemon, sprinkled with paprika for 
fish; potato balls dipped in melted butter and finely 
chopped parsley. 

Vegetable borders are very attractive and offer a 
palatable way to use left-overs. The center can be filled 
with creamed fish, chicken or veal. 

Pork or lamb chops may be served on a thin layfer of 
tomato sauce or surrounded with spaghetti cooked in a 
tomato sauce. Pork chops or sausage may be accompanied 
by rings of fried apples. 

Small croquettes of rice, fried a golden brown, and cubes 
of currant jelly may be served with roast game or fowl. 

Fried or baked bananas add greatly to Salisbury steak 
(chopped raw beef). 

Fruit fritters such as apple, pineapple, orange and 
banana may be served with both steak and fried chicken. 
Corn fritters can be cooked on a griddle like pancakes, and 
are acceptable with almost any kind of meat course. Very 
small portions of left-over corn may be made into these 
fritters. 

For more elaborate garnishing a pastry bag and tube will 
be required. Very little practice is required to handle a 
pastry bag skillfully enough for these simple decorations. 
It takes only a second to fill the bag with creamy mashed 
potatoes and when forced through a large star tube, either 



[46] MRS. DE GRAF'S COOK BOOK 

in a border or cup shape, to be filled with vegetables or 
creamed fish or meat, an otherwise commonplace dish will 
assume a festive appearance. The pastry bag can be made 
at home of heavy canvas, in a cornucopia shape, and the 
tubes can be purchased at any household appliance de- 
partment. One or two tubes are all that are needed, so it 
is not necessary to buy an expensive outfit. 

A garnish may be used for appearance only, such as 
parsley or slices of lemon; or for a food such as hard cooked 
eggs, toast, fritters, etc. Chopped parsley adds flavor as 
well as a garnish to many dishes. If lemons are to serve a 
double purpose, garnish and for flavor, they should be cut 
so the pieces can be handled without soiling the fingers. 
Bread for a garnish should be cut the desired shape (tri- 
angles, diamonds or rounds) before toasting. Toast is 
usually used as a garnish with creamed dishes. French 
fried potatoes or potato balls rolled in minced parsley look 
and taste well with croquettes, chops, steaks or filets of 
fish. Garnishes from hard cooked eggs are numerous; 
they may be cut in rings or quarters; or the yolks pressed 
through a sieve and the whites finely chopped. Figures 
cut from pickled beets or just sliced beets or pickles add an 
attractive touch, both as a relish and for contrast of color. 
One point to remember is that the garnish should be appro- 
priate to the dish and it should not crowd the food it 
accompanies. 

Savory appetizers or relishes are not difficult to prepare. 
Canapes, fish and fruit cocktails, raw oysters or clams are 
all used as appetizers to begin the meal, while olives, salted 
nuts, spiced fruits, celery, etc., are passed between courses 
at the formal meal or with the roast at the informal family 
meal. 

Canapes are always attractive and very easy to make 
and add a pleasing touch to the company dinner. The 
foundation is bread cut in small triangles or fancy shapes 
and either spread with butter on one side only and deli- 
cately browned in the oven, or toasted on one side, or 
fried in deep fat. The filling is spread on the untoasted 
side of the bread if the first or second method is used. A 
garnish of some kind is added for the general appearance; 
it may be olives, ripe, green or stuffed; or pickles cut to 



MRS. DE GRAF'S COOK BOOK [47 ] 

look like a fan; or tiny cheese balls rolled in chopped pars- 
ley; bits of hard cooked egg; minced green pepper or 
pimento or almost anything your fancy dictates. Serve 
these canapes on small plates with or without doilies. 

Fish cocktails may be served in long stemmed wine or 
cocktail glasses or small sherbet cups; fish and fruit cock- 
tails should be served very cold. Each cocktail glass 
should be set on a small plate and a doily under each 
glass adds to the general appearance. 

Whipped cream forced through the pastry bag, using a 
star tube, makes a very tempting decoration for desserts. 
All gelatin puddings can be attractively served in this 
manner; also fruit salads, and even the more humble 
stewed prunes or apple sauce, will look more dainty and 
tempting garnished, and may be served as a dinner dessert. 
Whipped cream not only adds to the appearance of a dish, 
whether a pastry bag is used or it is arranged with a spoon, 
but also adds to the food value of the dish with which it is 
served. 

Very thick mayonnaise may garnish a salad or fish, either 
forced through a pastry bag or used plain. 

Cold meats are improved in appearance if served with 
rings of green peppers or pimento or crisp lettuce leaves, 
with a spoonful of some relish, such as chutney, chili 
sauce, horseradish, or pickles placed in the center of each 
leaf. Olives, radishes or fringed celery also add to the 
appealing appearance of many meat and fish dishes, as 
well as salads. 

Cakes can be very elFectively decorated with candied 
fruits, walnuts, blanched almonds and pecans. Angelica 
or thinly sliced citron may be soaked in warm water, dried 
thoroughly, then cut into leaves of any desired form. Tiny 
colored candies and marshmallows may be used to trim 
cakes for children. Also the pastry bag and star tube will 
be found useful for decorating small cakes, even if the 
operator has very little skill in the manipulation of this 
implement. 

Chopped nut meats sprinkled over fruit salads, coffee 
cakes, or cake icings all add to the dainty appearance of 
the food. 

Immaculate linen, attractive dishes, shining glassware, 



[48] MRS. DE GRAF'S COOK BOOK 

all add to the attractive appearance of the table, and these 
need not necessarily be of the expensive variety. 

One important thought to keep uppermost is the fact 
that pleasing looking food creates an appetite and starts 
the digestive fluids, thereby making food more easily 
digested, so the subject of appearance is well worth some 
consideration, not just for occasions, but for every day. 

How to Prepare Radishes for a Garnish 

Wash well, cut a thin slice off the tip and remove the 
root; with a sharp knife score the skin into six or seven 
sections, extending about two-thirds of the way down the 
radish. Then loosen the skin on each section, place in cold 
water and the sections will stand out like the sections of a 
flower. 

How to Prepare Pickles for a Garnish 

Select pickles of uniform size; cut lengthwise, beginning 
at the top, into very thin slices without cutting com- 
pletely through at the end; spread out like a fan. 

To Render Uncooked Vegetables Crisp 

Put into very cold water, adding a slice or two of lemon 
and allow to stand an hour or more.

SOUPS WITH STOCK 
SOUPS WITHOUT STOCK 
CREAM SOUPS 
PUREES 
CHOWDERS 




[54] MRS. DE GRAF'S COOK BOOK 

Good Soup the Best Stimulus to a Good Dinner 

HE best type of soup to use for a dinner menu is 
one made of a meat stock foundation. These 
soups should not be confused in food value with 
heavy chowders, purees or the various cream 
soups and should be classed as accessories instead of 
foods. The foundation for this type of soup is a meat 
stock. Clear soup has its place at the beginning of the 
dinner because it is a valuable appetizer, acting as a 
stimulant rather than as a nutrient, and being guickly 
assimilated, prepares the way for the dishes which are 
to follow. 

Under the ordinary conditions of a dinner, a soup is 
intended to gratify, not satisfy, hunger. It stimulates 
the flow of the digestive juices. When the dishes which 
follow soup are of a hearty nature, the soup should be 
light and clear, not necessarily nutritious. Water cannot 
dissolve the fiber of meat, and as the fiber holds most 
of the nourishment, a meat stock has little food value. 

Where a soup is to form the main dish for luncheon it 
should always be of a nourishing character, such as cream 
soup, puree or chowder. 

The flavor of a good stock depends upon the amount of 
"extractives" that have been obtained during the cooking 
process. "Extractives" are that part of animal food which 
gives distinctive flavor and acts as a stimulant to the 
appetite and as an aid to digestion. 

Meat stock should always be made the day before it is 
required, as a good result can only be obtained by long, 
slow cooking. It is only by this means, too, that the fat 
can be removed from the top of the stock. A good stock 
is strong, well flavored and free from grease. There are a 
number of kinds of stock. 

The first and best stock is made from uncooked meat 
and bones, well flavored. This forms the foundation for 
consomme, bouillon, etc. A second stock may be made 
of the meat and bones left from this first stock by recook- 
ing with water and a quantity of vegetables. This soup 
depends mainly upon the vegetables for flavor. 



MRS. DE GRAF'S COOK BOOK [55] 

Stock may be made from the left-overs of cooked meats, 
bones and vegetables. Such stock can be used not only for 
soup but as a foundation for gravies and savory sauces. 
Stock may be made of vegetables, water and seasonings. 
This makes a very palatable and easilyprepared soup. Fish 
stock is made from fish, shellfish or from the trimmings of 
fish, and well flavored with vegetables. This stock forms 
a base for soup or fish sauces. 

Stock made of the left-overs of poultry is quite satis- 
factory. Brown stock is made principally of beef bones and 
meat, while white stock is made of mutton, lamb, poultry, 
veal or rabbit. Glaze is a stock which has been reduced in 
quantity by slow cooking, and when cold forms a solid 
jelly. Freshly made soup stock may be poured into 
sterilized jars sealed and set aside for future use. It will 
keep the same as any canned fruit or vegetable. 

Consommes are made from the first stock, which has 
been made clear by adding the whites and shells of eggs; 
usually some characteristic flavoring is added to give a 
distinguishing name, such as Consomme Julienne (with 
shredded vegetables), or it may be served plain, but 
should be well seasoned. Broths are made from the first 
stock; they should be well flavored with vegetables, and 
may be thickened slightly by adding sago, rice, pearl 
barley, etc. Bouillon is a broth made from beef. It is not 
cleared, as for consomme; it should be well flavored with 
vegetables and may be served plain or with the vegetables 
finely diced or with rice, sago or pearl barley. Thick soups 
are made from meat stock which has been thickened by 
adding corn starch, arrowroot or a quantity of sago, 
tapioca, rice, pearl barley, etc. These thickening sub- 
stances add somewhat to the food value of the soup, but 
not suflicient to place them in the same class with cream 
soups and chowders. 

The meat from which soup is made lacks flavor, but still 
contains most of the necessary food value. It should be 
well seasoned to supply the flavor which has been extracted 
and may be used for croquettes, timbales, or minced and 
served with savory sauces. 

To obtain the flavor of the meat and bones they should 
be cut in small pieces and all but a small portion of the lean 



[56] MRS. DE GRAF'S COOK BOOK 

meat should be covered with cold water and allowed to 
soak for at. least an hour. The meat which has been re- 
served should be dredged with flour and browned in hot 
fat. Add the cooked meat to that which is soaking in cold 
water; pour over one cupful of water and simmer for a few 
minutes to obtain all the browned material, which adds 
color and flavor to the stock. 

Set the soup kettle over the fire, add the seasoning and 
bring slowly to the boiling point only, then simmer gently 
several hours. Soup stock should never boil, as that would 
make the meat tough and would keep most of the juices in 
the meat instead of extracting them, as desired; also the 
salt has a tendency to draw out the juices and may be 
added to the cold water when soaking the meat. 

The vegetables added for flavor should be finely chopped 
and sauted, in beef dripping or a portion of the suet, for 
about 5 minutes, then added to the stock. When cooked 
the soup should be strained and set aside to cool; the coat 
of fat which will cover the top should be removed and then 
the stock is ready for use for the various soups. Pearl 
barley, rice, etc., should be previously cooked or partially 
cooked, then added to the stock. Vegetables should be 
finely diced or cut in thin strips, so that a very short length 
of time only will be required to cook them. The vegetables 
used to flavor the stock when first preparing will not take 
the place of vegetables served in the soup. The first are 
used for flavor only. The second to serve in the soup and 
to give additional flavor. 



MRS. DE GRAF'S COOK BOOK [57] 

How to Prepare Nourishing Soups Without 

Stocks 

Soups without stock include all cream soups, chowders 
and purees. This type of soup is both substantial and 
nourishing and is served at luncheon or where the meal to 
follow is not hearty. Or cream soups may be served for 
informal dinners to furnish a substantial dish so that the 
dinner itself will not require so generous an amount of the 
more expensive meat or meat substitute. Cream soups 
and chowders are both popular and very easily made. 

The foundation of a cream soup is a thin white sauce; 
cooked vegetable pulp or puree is added for flavor. The 
careful housewife will plan in advance to cook sufficient 
vegetables at a previous meal to prepare these soups. 
Many times left-over vegetables are improved by further 
cooking, since in order to make really good cream soup the 
vegetables should be so soft that they will easily pass 
through a sieve or puree strainer. The outer leaves of 
celery, the tough ends of asparagus, the discarded leaves of 
lettuce, will all give sufficient flavor to make a delicate, 
appetizing cream soup. Vegetables that would otherwise 
be thrown away may be utilized most satisfactorily in this 
manner. When possible use the liquor in which the 
vegetables were cooked, together with milk when making 
the foundation white sauce, as it adds more flavor. Strictly 
speaking, cream soups should contain only pureed vege- 
tables, meats or fish, but are more substantial if a part 
of the ingredients used are chopped very fine and added to 
the soup. When using canned vegetables for making soups 
the liquor should be discarded whenever possible, as it 
usually imparts a "canned" taste not at all palatable. The 
exceptions would be corn and tomatoes. These soups are 
improved if a small quantity of whipped cream is added 
just before serving, or a teaspoon of the whipped cream 
may be used as a garnish for each service. 

When preparing cream soups the vegetables should be 
rubbed through a coarse seive and heated before making 
the white sauce. The sauce should be made just before 



[58] MRS. DE GRAF'S COOK BOOK 

serving time and then the two ingredients combined. 
Cream soups will not curdle if made by this method. If 
allowed to stand any length of time they are apt to 
separate, so should not be made until required. 

Purees are usually made of vegetables such as dried 
beans, dried peas or potatoes and are a form of cream soup 
and very nutritous. 

A puree should be about as thick as a cream soup, there- 
fore but little thickening is needed ; but it will separate if no 
thickening is used. 

Bisques are made of fish, usually shell fish. They have 
as a base a thin sauce. Clams, oysters or diced lobster or 
crab are added to a white sauce and the whole well 
seasoned. 

Chowders are very substantial and are almost a meal in 
themselves when served with bread and butter. These 
soups make a very satisfactory luncheon or supper dish. 

Standard Brown Soup Stock 

3 pounds of shin of beef or 3 whole cloves, 

other muscular portion. }4 teaspoon white pepper.

with cold water and soak for at least an hour. Add the 
browned meat and seasonings and bring slowly to the 
simmering point, cooking between 4 and 5 hours. Do not 
boil. Strain, set aside to cool and remove fat. The stock 
is now ready for many varieties of soup.

BREAKFAST

VARIOUS WAYS OF SERVING EGGS 

HOW TO MAKE OMELETS 




[64] MRS. DE GRAF'S COOK BOOK 

Breakfast One of the Important Events 
of the Day 

REAKFAST in most homes is, without doubt, the 
simplest meal of the day and one requiring the 
least thought and effort in preparation. But 
when we consider the fact that breakfast is 
also the first meal of the day and is the one that should 
furnish the necessary food principles to the body to aid it 
in starting and carrying on the work for the day, we«can 
readily understand the importance of this meal and why 
it is necessary to begin the day with proper food. By 
this is meant a meal containing the essential food ele- 
ments to furnish heat and energy and to repair and build 
the muscles and tissues that are constantly being worn out. 

The right food leads to efficiency in one's work, for the 
body, like an engine, must have fuel, which is furnished 
by the food we eat. And if the food is not of the proper 
kind to supply the bodily needs it is going to suffer from 
lack of fuel. 

Of course, several factors, such as age, sex, muscular 
activity and climate, determine to a large extent the 
amount and kind of food required by different individuals. 
For instance, a man doing hard, muscular labor out of 
doors would require more food and food containing more 
of the muscle building qualities, such as meat or eggs; 
while a man doing office work would need less food be- 
cause his muscular activity is not so great and, working 
indoors, he does not require so much of the heat pro- 
ducing foods. It is often remarkable the amount of food 
growing children eat, but the active child requires energy 
giving foods, particularly if much time is spent out of 
doors in active play. 

The right kind of food, properly prepared, keeps the 
body in a healthful condition. And a healthy body is 
able to resist and throw off disease; an undernourished 
body is very susceptible to germs and will not recover 
from a severe illness so readily as one that is properly 
nourished and kept in a resistant condition. 



MRS. DE GRAF'S COOK BOOK [65] 

Many persons consider breakfast of so little importance 
that they omit this meal entirely. This seems a mistake, 
for in the morning the stomach is practically empty and, 
in order "to start the day right," some food should be 
taken unless for some good reason a physician has advised 
otherwise. 

Again, breakfasts are often eaten very hurriedly, which 
is wrong. In order to receive the greatest benefit from 
the food, it should be thoroughly broken up in the mouth 
so that the digestive juices may begin their action. If 
food is not broken up before entering the stomach it 
must be done there, and this means a strain on that organ; 
overwork will gradually cause it to weaken; so in time the 
stomach will not be able to perform its functions properly. 

It may seem difficult to get the variety in our breakfast 
menus that the large number of luncheon and dinner dishes 
afford, because there is a limited number of so-called 
typical breakfast dishes. But there is an endless variety 
of methods of preparing these different foods, so that there 
is really no need of monotony at this meal. 

Fruit, toast, cereal and coffee is the breakfast of the 
average city dweller; eggs, creamed dishes, ham, bacon, 
etc., for those who require a hearty meal. 

Fruit is valuable in the diet for the acid and minerals 
it furnishes the body, and also to act as body regulators. 
Taking fruit on an empty stomach is more effective than 
when eaten after a heavy meal. The acids in fruits act as 
a stimulant and aid digestion. When cereal is served it 
may furnish the principal part of the meal, for it furnishes 
starch, the heat and energy producing food, as well as 
the minerals that are so necessary to the body. If properly 
cooked cereals are very palatable and very easily digested. 

Cocoa, chocolate or milk supplies a food drink and taken 
with toast or rolls and butter constitutes a light meal. 

Eggs and meat furnish the tissue building elements. 

With the many different kinds of fruits and cereals and 
the various methods of preparing them the housewife 
should be able to have almost as wide a variety of dishes 
for her breakfast menus as for luncheon and dinner.

Cereals^ Fuel Foods 

Cereals are fuel foods and when properly cooked about 
90 per cent of the organic matter is assimilated. They 
supply actual nutriment to the body more economically 
than any other class of food. 

Wheat, com, rice and oats are the most widely used; 
oats and cornmeal, having more fat than other cereals, 
are particularly desirable for winter foods, although ex- 
perience has proved that oatmeal mush is acceptable for 
active children all the year round. Cornmeal and oats 
are valuable when the menu lacks meat. Many cereals 
contain protein, which, together with the starch, make 
them of great food value; in fact, they contain in varying 
proportions all the essential qualities to support life. 
One of their greatest values lies in the mineral salts they 
supply. These salts are essential in the diet of growing 
children for their bone building qualities. 

Because they are rich in starch, cereals must be thor- 
oughly cooked. It is safe to double the time for cooking 
as directed on the package. When they are not sufficiently 
cooked it is difficult for the digestive juices to penetrate 
the raw starch, and the body will not get the full benefit 
of the heat and energy this food contains. 

Cereals should be cooked in a quantity of boiling water, 
the amount varying with the kind of cereal to be cooked. 

The coarser the grain, the more water required for 
cooking. Whole or coarse grains are improved and require 
less time for cooking by soaking in cold water; very fine 
grains may be mixed with cold water before adding to the 
boiling water to prevent the formation of lumps. All 
others should be added slowly to the boiling water, stirring 
constantly. Cook directly over the flame until boiling 

Eoint is reached and boil five minutes. Then place over 
ot water, cover closely and cook the required length of 
time. A double boiler is a necessity when a fireless cooker 
is not used. It is impossible to cook cereal properly 
directly over the flame for any length of time, for it will 
burn before the cereal has cooked sufficiently. Cereals 
should be cooked stifi^ enough to chew. The fireless cooker 



MRS. DE GRAF'S COOK BOOK [67] 

is an excellent medium for cooking cereals. The longer 
they are cooked the more digestible and palatable they 
will be. 

When cereals are to be used in the form of gruels for 
children and invalids the cooking is more important than 
when used by people in normal health. It should be 
cooked much longer, then strained to remove all of the 
tough outer coat of the grains. To this strained mush is 
added milk to make the desired consistency — a very thin 
gruel for young children, and of a thicker consistency for 
invalids or elderly persons if to be eaten from a spoon. It 
is most important that the cooking be long enough to 
change the starch to a nearly soluble condition, otherwise 
it will be indigestible. A good rule is to cook them until 
the cereal forms a jelly-like mass. If cereals are to be 
eaten every day olFer a variety. The family may easily 
tire of one kind served too often. Most cooked cereals 
may be molded, sliced and fried, and served with syrup 
or eaten with meats to take the place of vegetables. A 
portion of cooked cereal may replace an equal amount of 
flour in making muffins or griddle cakes. 

Uncooked cereals are often used as a base for steamed 
puddings or cookies. 

Keep cereals in a cool dry place, closely covered to 
protect them from dust. 

General Directions for Cooking All Breakfast Cereals 

Put water in upper part of a double boiler; add salt 
and when boiling rapidly slowly add the cereal so as not 
to retard boiling Stir constantly, cooking directly over 
the flame for 5 minutes; then set over the hot water or in 
the fireless and cook without stirring and closely covered 
for the required length of time.

Boiled Rice 

Wash rice in several waters until, when rubbed between 
the hands in clear water, no further cloudiness appears. 

Cook in an abundance of rapidly boiling water, using at 
least four times as much water as rice. Add the rice to the 
boiling water a little at a time so as not to lower the tem- 
perature. Boil from IS to 30 minutes, or until the rice 
is tender, then add salt. The time required for cook- 
ing depends upon the age of the rice. The older the rice 
the longer it will take to cook until soft. The boiling 
should be so violent ais to keep the rice agitated and the 
grains well separated from one another. 

To test, press a few grains between the fingers, and when 
it is soft all through drain the rice through a colander and 
set over steam or in a moderate oven for a few minutes to 
dry. If it is found necessary to stir while boiling, use a 
fork, stirring gently so the kernels will not be broken. If the 
rice has been well cooked, even when cold each kernel 
should be dry and distinct. Before adding boiling water 
to the kettle, grease the bottom of the utensil and the 
rice will never stick. 

The water left from boiled rice has far too much starch 
to be wasted. It makes a very good starch for very sheer 
materials. Cooked down until thick, it makes a good 
foundation for all kinds of soups or sauces. If allowed to 
cool, it will form a jelly. This water should be used at 
once, for it sours very quickly.

Food Value and Various Ways of 
Serving Eggs 

Eggs contain water, mineral and two chief elements of 
nutrition, protein and fat. The protein of eggs is more 
easily digested than that of meat. For that reason eggs 
should be used freely during the summer, particularly 
in sections where the weather is hot. 

Being a highly concentrated food, eggs lack bulk, so 
should be served with foods that supply this need. 

Eggs are really a necessity with the average family, and 
there is no other article of food more indispensable to the 
art of cookery. They are used to thicken sauces and 
custards; to clarify soups; to keep a coating of crumbs on 
all breaded foods, such as cutlets, croquettes, etc. ; to leaven 
sponge cakes; to make souffles puffy and light; doughs and 
batters firm in texture — in fact, the use is almost limit- 
less. It may seem a very ordinary process just to boil eggs; 
however, comparatively very few people do this correctly. 

Cooking at a low temperature is absolutely essential if 
eggs are to be rendered digestible. Raw eggs are very 
easily and quickly digested. Heated to about 134 degrees 
F. the white of the egg will be a semi-liquid, the yolk 
liquid, very easy to digest. Heated to 160 degrees F. 
the white of the egg will be of a tender jelly-like consist- 
ency, the yolk soft, also easily assimilated. Heated to 
212 degrees F., or the boiling point, and kept at this 
degree of heat for several minutes, the yolk becomes hard, 
the white tough and difficult to digest. Cooked for any 
length of time at the boiling point they become very 
hard and tough and decidedly indigestible. These facts 
are worthy of consideration, particularly if you are cooking 
for children, elderly persons or those with weak stomachs. 
These principles will apply to all egg cookery. 

When other ingredients are used in combination with 
any number of eggs the heat must be moderate if the 
result is to be successful. Custards, timbales, sponge 
cakes, ometlets, etc., all are tough if cooked at a high 
temperature. During the spring and summer when eggs 



MRS. DE GRAF'S COOK BOOK [71] 

are not so high in price the thrifty housewife will pack them 
for use during the winter months. Of course, perfectly 
fresh eggs have the best flavor and for table use the packed 
eggs will never be as palatable as fresh ones. But for 
making cakes, muffins, griddle cakes, custards, puddings, 
etc., the packed eggs will be just as satisfactory as the 
fresh and at one-half the price. With a case or more of 
packed eggs, a small family may have, at a moderate cost, 
their favorite cake or pudding, the crisp, tempting waffles, 
cream puffs, popovers or omelets with just as satisfactory 
results as if made from fresh eggs. There is a prejudice 
against packed or cold storage eggs which should not 
exist. 

The practical housekeeper realizes their value for cook- 
ing purposes and knows that it is not logical to use these 
eggs for the table, for their flavor is impaired; but, com- 
bined with other ingredients, this lack of flavor has no 
disadvantage. 

Eggs may also be used to replace meat. There are few 
■persons who do not like them, but if served in the same 
way too often, egg dishes become monotonous. There are 
many dishes, offering unlimited variety, which should be 
found on the weekly menu. 

Soft and Hard Cooked Eggs 

To cook eggs soft they should be dropped into a kettle 
containing enough boiling water to completely cover them 
and allow them to stand in the hot water for 10 minutes, 
having the kettle closely covered and no fire under the 
kettle. This will give you the soft egg with the white 
cooked to a jelly-like consistency. If desired cooked 
longer, keep a very low fire so that the water will not reach 
the boiling point and cook 12 to 15 minutes. Cooked in 
this manner the egg will be firm but mealy, not tough, and 
is digestible. 

Or cover eggs with cold water and when boiling point 
is reached remove from the fire. They will be just right 
for soft cooked eggs. If desired medium or hard, let stand 
from 10 to IS minutes in the hot water. Keep kettle 
closely covered and in a warm place on the stove or over 
the lowest heat possible sufiicient to keep the water hot 



[72] MRS. DE GRAF'S COOK BOOK 

only. If eggs are to be used for salad or garnishes, let 
them cook under the boiling point half an hour. Plunge 
into cold water at once so the yolk will not turn dark. 

Poached Eggs 

To poach eggs, fill a deep frying pan ^ full of water, add 
yi. teaspoon of salt. When water is boiling, break egg in a 
saucer and carefully lower into the water. Baste the yolks 
once or twice to cook the tops. The water should not boil 
after the eggs have been added, but kept at the simmering 
point. Cook until the white is firm, then remove carefully 
with a perforated spoon or skimmer to slices of buttered 
toast. 

Poached Eggs with Spinach 

2 cups of cooked spinach, 4 poached eggs. 

chopped fine. 2 tablespoons grated cheese. 

J^ cup of medium white sauce. 

For sauce melt 1 tablespoon of butter or substitute, add 
1 tablespoon of flour; mix until smooth and free from 
lumps; set over fire and cook until frothy; add J^ cup cold 
milk and cook, stirring constantly until thick; season with 
y^i teaspoon salt \^ teaspoon pepper; mix spinach and 
white sauce and heat thoroughly; turn onto a serving 
platter and flatten down with spoon. Place poached eggs 
on top, sprinkle with grated cheese, set in the oven a few 
seconds to partially melt cheese. Garnish with toast 
points and serve. 

Scrambled Eggs 

Scrambled eggs, when properly cooked, are a delicious 
creamy dish; if cooked at a high temperature they become 
a stringy mass which is neither palatable nor easily di- 
gestible. A very easy way to prepare scrambled eggs is 
to use the double boiler and cook the eggs over hot water. 
If the result is to be a creamy mixture, care must be taken 
not to cook them too long. 

Scrambled Eggs with White Sauce 

^ cup of medium white sauce. Salt and pepper. 
4 eggs. 

Make sauce, then add eggs. Cook slowly, stirring 
constantly until creamy. Serve on toast. 



MRS. DE GRAF'S COOK BOOK [ 73] 

Eggs and Asparagus 

1 cup of asparagus tips. i hard cooked eggs. 

1 cup medium white sauce. 

Add asparagus tips to the white sauce; remove shell from 
eggs and cut in quarters; pour white sauce and asparagus 
tips on serving plate and arrange hard cooked eggs 
around the edge. Serve very hot. 



Fried Eggs 

To fry eggs use enough hot fat to baste the eggs as 
they are cooking, so that a delicate film will be formed 
over each egg. The fat should be hot, but not hot enough 
to brown the eggs at once or they will have a bitter, 
unpleasant flavor. 

Eggs Benedict 

For each egg allow 1 slice of cooked ham and V toasted 
English muffin or round slice of toast. Poach eggs. Put 
ham on toast, then poached egg; pour over all a well- 
seasoned white sauce. 



Eggs Baked in Potato Cases 

Bake medium sized potatoes. When cooked split down 
the center lengthwise and remove the pulp. Beat until 
creamy or press through a potato ricer; season with salt, 
pepper and butter, adding a little milk to moisten. Break 
an egg in each potato case, then heap the mashed potato 
mixture on top with a spoon or force through a pastry 
bag. Bake in a moderate oven about 20 minutes. 

Baked Eggs with Mashed Potatoes 

Butter a casserole or baking dish. Fill with hot mashed 
potatoes. With a tablespoon make 4 depressions, each 
to hold an egg; brush over with melted fat, and drop an 
egg into each. Set in a medium hot oven until eggs are 
set and potatoes brown. 



[74] MRS. DE GRAF'S COOK BOOK 

Shirred Eggs Creole 

Make the Spanish omelet mixture. Put a tablespoon- 
ful of this mixture in either a greased individual baking 
dish, or a large one; place the eggs on top of this sauce, 
season and place buttered crumbs over top of egg. Bake 
in a medium hot oven. 

Eggs Marine 

For each service allow 1 egg and 1 tablespoon of finely 
chopped cooked fish; grease custard cups, add fish, 
sprinkled with salt and chopped parsley. Beat egg, add 1 
tablespoon of milk; pour over fish; set cups in a pan of 
boiling water and place in a moderate oven until eggs are 
firm. Turn out on a serving plate and pour a well-seasoned 
white sauce over all. Lemon juice should be added to the 
sauce for fish. Any cooked meat may be used for this dish. 

Curried Eggs 

4 hard cooked eggs. 1 teaspoon curry powder. 

1 cup of medium white sauce. 1 teaspoon onion juice. 

1 tablespoon shredded green 2 cups cooked rice, 
pepper. 

Prepare the sauce, adding peppers, onion juice, rice 
and curry powder, which has been moistened and mixed 
with a little cold milk. Heat thoroughly. Remove eggs 
from shell, cut in quarters. Pour hot mixture into a 
serving plate and garnish with the eggs. 

Stuffed Eggs 

Hard cooked eggs (as many as desired); cut in halves 
lengthwise, remove yolks; to the yolks add salt, pepper, 
chopped, stuffed or ripe olives, and thick mayonnaise 
dressing. Re-fill the whites, place on lettuce leaves and 
garnish with mayonnaise. Serve as a salad or appetizer. 

Eggs a la King 

6 hard cooked eggs. 2 tablespoons shredded green 
^ cup finely minced chicken pepper. 

or bam. 2 tablespoons shredded 
Ipi cups medium white sauce. pimento. 

Prepare the white sauce; to this add the pimento and 
green pepper; cut eggs in halves lengthwise, remove yolk; 
mash, season and add the minced chicken; refill the egg 



MRS. DE GRAF'S COOK BOOK [75] 

white, piling the mixture high. The mixture can be easily 
forced through a pastry bag. Place stuffed eggs on a 
platter and pour the hot sauce over them. Serve at once. 

Creole Eggs 

1 cup tomato sauce. 1 teaspoon butter. 

1 tablespoon chopped olives. }4 teaspoon salt. 

1 teaspoon onion juice. M teaspoon pepper. 

Mix well and simmer gently about 10 minutes. Grease 
4 custard cups, break an egg into each one, sprinkle 
with finely chopped parsley and set the cups in a saucepan 
of boiling water; cover and steam about 10 minutes, turn 
onto a heated serving dish and pour sauce around them. 

Baked Eggs with Cheese 

Allow 1 thin slice of bread for each egg. Grease a 
baking pan, set slices of bread on bottom of pan, break 
egg into a saucer and carefully slip onto a slice of bread. 
Sprinkle egg generously with grated cheese, season with 
salt and pepper and bake in a moderate oven until eggs 
are set. 

To Pack Eggs 

Fresh, clean eggs covered with water glass solution and 
stored in a cool place will keep in good condition for about 
a year, and if not perfect for boiling, poaching or frying, 
will prove an economy during the winter for all other 
purposes. Eggs packed in a solution of water glass are 
much better than the cold storage eggs. For packing se- 
cure large fresh eggs. They must be clean, but do not 
wash them, as this removes the natural coating on the 
outside of the shell. The water glass commonly used is a 
syrup-thick liquid about the consistency of molasses. 
Only pure water should be used in making the solution, so 
it is best to boil it. Then cool before mixing with the 
water glass, using 1 part of the thick water glass to 
9 parts of water. Measure accurately. Have the 
eggs carefully packed in clean earthenware crocks, glass 
jars, large kettles or wooden kegs or barrels. Be sure the 
container is sweet and clean. Cover with solution then 
cover container and store in a cool place. If kept in too 
warm a place silicate deposits on the shell, and the eggs 
will not keep well. 



[76] MRS. DE GRAF'S COOK BOOK 

Omelets 

The muscle building qualities of eggs are utilized to the 
fullest extent in omelets, and, prepared in this manner, 
furnish sufEpient bulk to satisfy the appetite. Omelets of- 
fer an unlimited opportunity for variety in combination 
with other foods, and are suitable for the main course at 
luncheon or the informal home dinner, as well as for 
breakfast. 

There are two classes of omelets, the French and the 
puffy. The last named is best suited for substantial 
omelets. This type of omelet is considered somewhat 
difficult to make, and for that reason few housewives 
attempt to make them. Only a few precautions are 
necessary, however, and when these are thoroughly 
understood there should be no difficulty in preparing a 
variety of attractive, palatable omelets. The foundation 
omelet will always be the same, but it will take its name 
from whatever food is used in combination. 

For the foundation omelet there are a few points to 
carefully follow, and, if this is done, even the most inex- 
perienced housewife may be successful in producing a 
light, puffy omelet, which is delightful to behold, as well 
as to eat. Do not prepare the omelet until everything 
else to be served at the meal is in readiness, so that it can 
be carefully watched and served as soon as cooked. Put 
the frying or omelet pan over a very low fire to heat while 
preparing the omelet. For the "pufFy" omelet a heavy 
pan will give better results, and do not allow the pan to 
get so hot that when the fat is added it will smoke and 
burn. The mixture is first cooked in the frying pan over 
a low flame. When a golden brown on the bottom finish 
cooking in a medium oven or in the broiler. 

Never use more than 4 eggs for a "puffy" omelet. If a 
larger one is needed, majke two omelets. Unless your pan 
is very large, you will not be able to cook a larger omelet 
successfully. 

The main point to observe is to cook the omelet at a 
low temperature, otherwise it will not be thoroughly 
cooked, and if burned or even browned too much will have 



MRS. DE GRAF'S COOK BOOK [77] 

a bitter flavor. If not sufficiently cooked it will fall and 
be heavy, and if over-cooked it will shrink and become 
tough. The omelet should continue to rise and become a 
golden brown after going into the oven. 

When cooked remove from the oven, cut across the 
center halfway through, then fold over and turn on a 
heated platter. 

This gives the foundation omelet, which may be varied 
in a dozen diflFerent ways. 

When eggs are beaten separately as for the puffy 
omelet, the result will be a lighter but dryer omelet than 
when eggs are only slightly beaten together. For this 
reason a filling of creamy sauce or a tablespoonful of 
butter added just before folding add the desired moisture. 

Small bits of left-overs can be folded into the mixture to 
give flavor; a tablespoon of chopped ham or other meats, 
free from fat, bone or gristle; shredded green pepper; 
cooked peas, asparagus tips, flaked fish, cooked rice, etc. 
When eggs are very high a cupful of soft bread crumbs may 
be soaked in milk, then added to the omelet to give a 
substantial dish, making the number of eggs used serve 
more persons. 

A French omelet is cooked entirely in the frying pan 
over moderate heat. It is more of a breakfast omelet and 
does not lend itself to the variety possible with the puffy 
omelet. It requires some skill to cook properly. 

Water or milk may furnish the liquid. Water will 
produce a more tender omelet, while milk furnishes more 
nutriment. 

Foundation Puffy Omelet 

4 eggs, separated. ]/i teaspoon salt, 

4 tablespoons water or milk. 2 tablespoons shortening. 

Beat egg whites until stiflF; yolks until creamy; add liquid 
and salt to yolks, mix well; combine mixtures, folding 
carefully together. Melt fat in a warm frying pan and 
when medium hot, pour in omelet. Cook until brown on 
the under side, then finish cooking in a medium hot oven 
or in the broiler until firm in the center. Cut across 
the center about halfway through, fold and turn onto a 
serving dish.

SWEET OMELETS 
Jelly Omelet 

Use the puffy omelet. Take a glass of jelly (currant 
preferred) and beat it with a fork. Before folding omelet 
spread jelly over the top, then fold, sprinkle with powdered 
sugar and serve. Jam, marmalade or fruit butters may 
replace the jelly. This makes a fine luncheon dish entree 
or may be used for dessert. 

Strawberry Omelet 

3 cups fresh berries. ^ teaspoon of nutmeg. 

Sugar to taste. 4-egg pufEy omelet. 

Before preparing omelet wash and hull strawberries, 
add sugar and nutmeg and mash slightly. When omelet 
is cooked and before folding, add some of the strawberries, 
then fold and pour remaining strawberries around the 
omelet. Sprinkle omelet with powdered sugar and serve. 
This makes an appealing Sunday morning breakfast dish. 
Other fruits, fresh or cooked, may be used in the same 
manner. 

Banana Omelet 

Use the 4-egg puffy omelet. Do not cook on top of 
the fire quite as long as the plain omelet. Have bananas 
sliced lengthwise very thin. Place slices close together 
over the top of the omelet, sprinkle with sugar and lemon 
juice. Place in a medium oven and bake until omelet is 
firm in the center and bananas are tender, about 10 minutes. 
Fold omelet and serve with whipped cream or a hot 
pudding sauce. An entree or dessert.

always tender. It is most essential that fish 
should be perfectly fresh, thoroughly cooked, and care- 
fully cleaned. If under-done, it is not eatable; if cooked 
too long, it is dry and loses most of its flavor. 

When perfectly fresh, the eyes of fish are bright and 
clear, the flesh is firm and odorless. 

Fish may be divided into three clases, namely, white, 
oily and shell fish. The white and oily fish may be served 
in place of meat; and in general, the methods of cooking 
fish are the same as those used in meat cookery. 

Slices of fish require but little attention. They should 
be carefully wiped with a damp cloth, or let the cold 
water from the faucet run over them, then wipe dry. 
Never allow fish to stand in water after it has been 
sliced. Whole fish, even when cleaned at the market, will 
require a thorough washing to remove all the blood from 
the inside of the backbone. 

White fish is not so nourishing as oily fish. In this 
type of fish all of the oil is contained in the liver, making 
the flesh somewhat dry. A rich sauce usually accompanies 
fish of this kind to supply the lacking fat. 

The oily fish, such as salmon, mackerel, etc., have the 
oil distributed throughout the flesh. Therefore this type 
of fish is more nourishing than the white fish. Both 
kinds are useful in the diet of the convalescent or persons 
suffering from indigestion, although the white fish is 
preferable for an invalid. 

In composition, fish is much like meat; but unlike meat 
in that it must be eaten soon after it is killed, as it deteri- 
orates very quickly. It is difficult to keep fish in the house 
either before or after cooking, as the odor is very pene- 
trating and other foods absorb it. If put into the refriger- 
ator uncovered it contaminates all other foods. But if 
placed in a covered pail which is kept for this purpose, the 
odor will not penetrate to the other foods. 



MRS. DE GRAF'S COOK BOOK [85] 

All of the various methods of cooking may be applied 
to fish — baking, frying, sauteing, boiling, steaming and 
broiling. The principal thing is to be sure that the fish 
is thoroughly cooked and still not over-cooked. It is 
really important to keep a set of utensils to use for cooking 
fish only, as the flavor is so distinct that even the most 
careful washing does not always remove it. A frying pan 
seems to be the most difficult utensil from which to remove 
this odor. 

Frying, sauteing and broiling are the most popular 
methods of preparing fish. All fish are greatly improved 
for serving if the bones are removed. A boned fish, stuffed 
and baked, and served with a suitable sauce, is most 
appetizing and will usually be relished even by persons 
who ordinarily refuse fish. 

Then, too, many attractive dishes can be made from the 
left-over fish, and to many persons these dishes appeal 
more than when the fish is freshly cooked. 

It is less wasteful to steam fish than it is to boil it. 
However, it is possible when boiling to add flavoring 
which will make the fish more palatable. In boiling a 
fish add 1 teaspoon of salt and 1 tablespoon of vinegar 
to every 2 quarts of water and use enough water to 
entirely cover the fish. Vinegar tends to make the flesh 
firm. Soup vegetables, a clove or a bit of bay leaf may 
also be added to the water in which the fish is cooked. Do 
not pour cold water over the fish, as it will draw out the 
juices; have the water hot but not boiling, then bring to 
the boiling point and simmer gently until the flesh will 
leave the bones and is tender. Ten minutes' cooking may 
be allowed for each pound of fish, after the water has 
reached the simmering point. 

Fish will hold its shape and can be handled easier if 
wrapped in a piece of cheese cloth before placing in the 
hot water. A rack ©r plate should be placed on the bottom 
of the kettle to prevent the fish from sticking and possibly 
burning. Always serve a salad (green preferred) with a 
French dressing or slices of lemon with all fish dishes. 
If sauces are used, they should be seasoned with lemon 
juice.

Shellfish 

Shellfish are divided into two classes. Clams, oysters, 
scallops and mussels belong to one class, and lobsters 
crabs, shrimps and crawfish belong to another class. 

Oysters are the most important of the shellfish, although 
shrimps are higher in food value. Both clams and oysters 
are more easily digested if eaten raw. With the exception 
of the lobster all fish are easy to digest, although the lean 
fish is more readily assimilated than the fat. The flesh of 
the lobster is coarse, dense and difficult of digestion. 

Escalloped Fish 

Place alternating layers of fish and soft bread crumbs in 
a buttered baking dish, covering the whole with milk or 
a thin white sauce. Season with salt and pepper and 
bake until firm. Variety may be given this dish by 
using tomato sauce instead of milk. 

Fish Pie 

Fill a baking dish with well-seasoned creamed fish, 
then cover with mashed potatoes and bake until potatoes 
are a golden brown. 

Baked Fish with Stuffing 

Prepare a bread stuffing, fill the opening two-thirds 
full and then sew firmly. Cut two or three gashes in the 
side of the fish and lay a piece of salt pork in each gash. 
Dredge fish with flour, sprinkle with salt and pepper, 
lay on a rack or a piece of cheese cloth in a baking pan. 
Bake IS minutes for each pound of fish, basting fre- 
queiitly. The pork should supply sufficient fat for 
basting; if not, add a very little water. 

Baked Fish 

Chop 1 small onion and yi green pepper very fine, 
brush fish over with melted fat, place in the baking pan, 
pile the onion and green pepper on top, season well and 
bake. By baking on a piece of cheese cloth the fish can 
easily be removed from the pan without breaking. 



MRS. DE GRAF'S COOK BOOK [87] 

Fillets of Fish 

Wash and dry fillets. Season, roll in fine bread or 
cracker crumbs, dip in slightly beaten egg diluted with 
1 tablespoon of cold water; dip in crumbs again, then 
fry in deep fat. Prepare all the fillets before beginning 
to cook any of them. Vegetable oil is the best fat to use 
for frying fish. Heat until a very slight trace of smoke 
can be seen, then test with a cube of bread. Drop bread 
in the fat and count 40. If the fat is right the bread will 
be a golden brown; if too hot it will be burned; if not 
hot enough it will not be brown. Test the fat each time 
before adding fish. Drain fried fish on brown paper. 
This is the best method for frying fish. It will be crisp 
and if the fat has been properly tested the fish will not be 
oily. Serve with Tartar sauce or slices of lemon. 

Pan Fried or Saute'ed Fish 

Prepare' the fish as for deep fat frying, then cook in a fry- 
ing pan in a small quanity or fat. If saut^ed without crumb- 
ing, the fish will break easily and will not present an appe- 
tizing appearance. Salt pork adds flavor to the fish and 
is the best fat to use for sauteing. 

Butter adds flavor but burns too easily. 



To Boil Fish 

Have water boiling. Add 1 teaspoon of vinegar to 
a quart of water, also a tablespoon each of chopped onion 
and carrot, a tiny bit of bay leaf and thyme. Lower the 
fish gently intb the water and cook at the simmering point 
until tender. The time required is usually from 6 to 10 
minutes for each pound of fish. 

To Steam Fish 

Season fish with salt, pepper, cover top with thin strips 
of salt pork and place on a plate. Set in a steamer over 
boiling water, cover closely and steam 10 to 12 minutes 
for each pound of fish. 



[88] MRS. DE GRAF'S COOK BOOK 

To Broil Fish 

Wash fish, wipe dry and brush it over with melted 
butter or olive oil. Place on a double wire toaster or 
broiler and cook over hot coals or in the gas broiler. 
Turn every minute until both sides are a delicate brown. 
If gas broiler is used heat well before cooking fish, reducing 
the heat as soon as fish is placed in the broiler. Season 
with salt, pepper, a little onion or lemon juice. 

Creamed Fisli 

For each cupful of diced or flaxed fish allow 1 cupful 
of well-seasoned white sauce. Sprinkle with finely 
chopped parsley or hard cooked egg. Serve in a casserole, 
ramekins or poured over toast points. Garnish with 
thin slices of lemon sprinkled with paprika.

Fried Oysters 

Drain and dry oysters. Sprinkle with salt and pepper. 
Beat 1 egg, add 1 tablespoon of cold water. Dip oysters 
in fine dry bread crumbs, then in the beaten egg, then 
in crumbs and fry in deep fat or pan fry in a hot frying 
pan in 2 tablespoons of fat. Test the deep fat with a 
cube of bread. It should become a golden brown while 
you count 60. Serve with lemon slices. 

Oysters and Bacon 

Drain and dry oysters. Roll each oyster in a slice of 
bacon and fasten with a tooth pick. Cook in a hot frying 
pan until bacon is crisp. Serve on toast. 

Creamed Oysters or Clams

frying pan. Add 2 cups of drained oysters. Season 
with salt, pepper and lemon juice. Shake the pan con- 
stantly until the edges of the oysters are curled. Serve 
on buttered toast. 

Steamed Clams 

Clams should be bought alive in the shell. Wash well 
in several waters to remove all sand. Put into a large 
kettle. Allow }4. cup of boiling water for 2 quarts of 
clams. Cover kettle closely and steam until the shells 
are partially open. If liked a clove of garlic or an onion 
may be added for flavor. Serve with melted butter.

Meat 

Meat is one of the chief sources of tissue building (pro- 
tein) food. Its food value is high, and so unfortunately is 
the price. The average American housewife serves meat at 
least once a day. If the amount of meat is reduced, other 
food equally nutritive must be substituted. The problem 
with most housekeepers at present is how to keep the meat 
bill down and still serve palatable meals. This requires 
careful study and should include a knowledge of the 
different cuts of meat, the amount of waste and quality. If 
these points are not understood, it is not possible to pur- 
chase to the best advantage. And most important, the 
marketing should be "personally conducted,' if the best 
results are to be obtained. To order by telephoiie often 
adds to the cost due to lack of details, such as thickness, 
exact weight or choice cuts, etc., which the dealer will not 
observe as carefully as the purchaser. Then again, the 
market man will probably take a personal interest in hold- 
ing your trade if he finds you know what you want, that 
you are familiar with the different cuts of meat and under- 
stand their qualities. 

The best method of cooking meat depends entirely upon 
the tenderness, texture and flavor. The tenderness will 
depend upon the connective tissue; tender, fine grained 
meats are taken from the least muscular parts of the 
animal and tough, coarse fibercd sections come from 
portions which are most used. One-fourth of the weight 
of a dressed beef consists of the tender meat, and all of 
these cuts are expensive. The less tender cuts are just as 
nutritious; in fact, many of the cheaper cuts have more 
food value than the tender meat, but require more atten- 
tion in their preparation. If cooked properly, these 
cheaper cuts will be found juicy and palatable. 

The value of any cut of meat depends upon the quantity 
of waste, bone, gristle, etc. For example, the prime ribs 
are even higher than they seem, because the purchaser has 
to pay for so much bone; while some of the cheaper meats 
have so much waste in gristle, fat and bone that they 
would be equal in price to more tender cuts. 



[92] MRS. DE GRAF'S COOK BOOK 

All meat cookery is governed by two general principles. 
For tender, fine grained meats there should be intense heat, 
no liquid, and the meat should be seasoned after cooking. 
The high temperature sears the surface and keeps the 
juice from escaping. The meat is cooked quickly because, 
being tender, it would harden and become dry if it were 
allowed to remain in too great a heat for a long period. It 
is seasoned after cooking because the salt would tend to 
draw out the juices, which with tender meats is not de- 
sirable. Water is not added because it would cause steam, 
which would affect the brown, crisp surface of the meat. 
Plenty of fat instead of liquid should be used for basting. 

Coarse, tough meats require quick surface searing, long, 
slow cooking and a small amount of water. The meat is 
seared in order to retain the greater part of the juices, and 
then cooked slowly in a small amount of water and closely 
covered; it may be seasoned during the cooking process. 
The meat when cooked should be juicy, due to seanng, and 
tender because of the slow cooking. 

To understand which method to use is the secret of 
economy in meat cookery. The best and most expensive 
cuts of meat are selected for roasting, broiling or pan 
broiling. The cheaper or coarser portions are made into 
stews, soups, pot roast, braised or boiled. The cheaper 
cuts of meat are just as high in food value as the more 
tender ones, thus offering the housewife the necessary 
variety. 

Meat which is dry and lean is much improved by the 
addition of pork fat, either salt or fresh. This may be 
added by placing thin strips over the upper surface of the 
meat, or strips of fat about half an inch thick can be in- 
serted through cuts made with a sharp pointed knife and 
extended clear through if possible. Or a larding needle 
may be used and strips of pork drawn through in stitches 
about an inch long. These stitches are taken at regular 
intervals over the entire surface of the meat. Take the 
strips of pork as near the rind as possible and cut length- 
wise with the rind. 

Red meats, such as beef and mutton, are more stimulat- 
ing than the white meat of poultry or veal. Beef is the 
most nutritious, mutton being second. Lamb and veal are 



MRS. DE GRAF'S COOK BOOK [93] 

less nutritious than the flesh of full-grown animals. Dried 
or smoked beef contains as much nutriment as the fresh 
meat, while corned beef loses in food value, the brine 
drawing out some of the juices. Meat is too expen- 
sive a food to be thoughtlessly purchased or carelessly 
cooked, and the meat bill may be reduced by making more 
use of the less expensive cuts. 



Roast Meat 

Only the tender cuts of meat should be roasted. The 
following rules will apply to all roast meats: 

Wipe meat with a damp cloth, do not wash. Dredge 
with flour and if the meat is not fat some fat should be 
added. 

Place in a hot oven to sear the outer surface as soon as 
possible, thus preventing rich juices from escaping. 

When the surface of the meat is brown, the heat of the 
oven should be reduced and the cooking continued more 
slowly. 

A medium sized roast should be basted at least four 
times during the cooking, and at the last basting the salt 
and pepper may be added. 

Beef and mutton are roasted IS minutes to the pound, 
veal and lamb 20 minutes. 

Pork from 20 to 25 minutes. 

An additional IS minutes must be added to the cooking 
for the length of time it takes to heat the meat through, so 
that the time allowed for each pound is really after the 
meat is thoroughly heated. 

Perfectly roasted meat will be a rich brown on the sur- 
face. Beef and mutton should show a pinkish tint when 
sliced. Veal and lamb should show no pink. Mutton is 
encased in a thick skin which should be removed, as it will 
impart that peculiar flavor so objectionable to many. This 
skin is tough and when loosened at the edges can easily 
be pulled off. 



[94] MRS. DE GRAF'S COOK BOOK 

Yorkshire Pudding to Accompany Roast. 

\i cup milk. ^ cup sifted flour. 

M teaspoon salt. 1 egg. 

Add salt and flour to milk and beat with an egg beater 
until mixture is smooth; then add egg unbeaten and con- 
tinue to beat about 2 minutes. Do not prepare until 
roast is cooked. Remove meat from pan and place in a 
warming oven or cover to keep hot. Pour batter in pan 
and bake about IS minutes in a hot oven, basting with 
the fat in the pan after the first 5 minutes of cooking. Cut 
in squares, and use as a garnish with roast. This will not 
interfere with making a gravy if desired, although a fine 
cut of roast beef should be cooked so that the juice of the 
meat provides all the gravy needed. 

Broiled Meat 

Tender steaks, chops and cutlets, all fine grained meats 
may be broiled. They are cooked on the same general 
principles that apply to roast meat. They, too, must be 
subjected to an intense heat in order to sear the outer sur- 
face to prevent the loss of the rich juices. Have the 
broiler of a gas or t lectric range very hot. If coal is used 
have a bed of hot coals with no flame. Rub broiler over 
lightly with fat. Wipe meat with a damp cloth; trim oflF 
all excessive fat and remove the skin from chops if the 
butcher has not done so. Reduce the heat of gas so there 
will be no danger of the meat catching fire. Place meat 
about 1 inch from the flame at first so that the meat will 
sear quickly. Cooking may be finished farther from the 
flame. Allow about S minutes for each side of a steak 1 
inch thick if desired rare; longer if to be well done, or if the 
steak is more than an inch thick, watch very closely. Have 
the rest of the dinner completely cooked and ready to 
serve so that the meat can be served at once. Place on a 
hot platter, pour melted butter over the top and sprinkle 
lightly with salt and pepper. 

Pan Broiled Meats 

Select only the tender cuts of meat. Heat a heavy 
frying pan very hot. Do not add fat; that on the meat is 



MRS. DE GRAF'S COOK BOOK [95] 

sufficient. Turn every 2 minutes until cooked. Place on 
a hot platter, pour over a little melted butter and season 
with salt and pepper. 

Planked Steak 

The meat is broiled just enough to sear the surface then 
placed in the center of a well-heated, slightly buttered 
plank. Mashed potatoes, vegetables, etc., must be pre- 
pared before the steak is broiled. Make a border on the 
edge of the plank of mashed potatoes forced through a 
pastry bag with a star tube, or arrange potatoes with a 
spoon. Brush potato with beaten egg. Place vegetables 
inside the potato border around the steak. Boiled onions, 
cauliflower, stuffed tomatoes or peppers, asparagus tips, 
almost any vetegable is suitable. Place in a very hot oven 
until the potatoes are a golden brown and the steak has 
finished cooking. Chopped meat may be shaped like a 
steak, broiled and cooked on a plank. Put bananas cut 
in thirds lengthwise over the top of the meat and garnish 
as for steak. 

Stuffed Steak 

1 flank steak. }^ teaspoon sage. 

1 cup soft bread crumbs. Ys teaspoon pepper. 

}^ teaspoon salt. 2 tablespoons grated onion. 

Mix crumbs and seasonings with J^ cup of melted butter 
or substitute. Place dressing in center of steak, roll and 
tie or skewer in shape. Dredge with flour, place a few 
strips of bacon or salt pork over the top and place in a 
moderately hot oven; baste several times. Serve with a 
brown gravy, to which a few dried mushrooms have been 
added; or serve with a horseradish sauce. 

Broiled Flank Steak 

Purchase a flank steak. Place a few strips of thinly 
sliced bacon over it, then roll up like a jelly roll and tie 
firmly every 2 inches. Cut into slices about an inch 
thick, so that each slice will be tied in the center. Broil on 
each side about 4 minutes in a hot broiler, then finish in a 
hot oven. Garnish with banana fritters or sauted bananas. 



[96] MRS. DE GRAF'S COOK BOOK 

Pounded Round Steak 

Wipe meat with a damp cloth. Cut into portions for 
individual service. With a wooden potato masher pound 
a tablespoonful or more of flour into each portion. The 
pounding breaks the tough connective tissue and the flour 
absorbs the juices. Cook in a hot frying pan in beef 
drippings. 

Pot Roast 

This method of cooking meat is for the less tender cuts. 
It is really a type of braising, only a heavy, closely covered 
kettle is used on top of the stove instead of using the oven. 
Wipe meat and dredge with flour. Heat the kettle 
thoroughly, add 2 or more tablespoonfuls of drippings; 
some of the beef suet may be rendered for this purpose. 

Sear the entire surface of meat until crust is formed. 
Set a small wire rack on the bottom of the kettle, place 
the meat on the rack, add 1 cup of boiling water and cook 
under the boiling point for 3 or 4 hours or until meat is 
tender, about 40 minutes for each pound. When half 
cooked season with salt, pepper and an onion may be added 
or a bit of bay leaf and 2 or 3 whole cloves. Remove meat 
to a hot platter. If any liquor remains pour off^. Add 2 
tablespoons of drippings to the kettle, add 2 tablespoons of 
flour, cook until brown, then add 2 cups of liquid; that 
which was left from the roast, and enough stock or water 
to make the required amount. Season with pepper, salt 
and a teaspoonful of kitchen bouquet, a liquid for seasoning 
and giving gravies and sauces a rich color. 

Braised Beef 

Braising is steaming meat in its own juices in the oven — 
a method suitable for solid pieces of meat not tender 
enough for roasting, but of better quality than those 
utilized in soups and stews. The retention of steam under 
a cover, together with basting with the broth, keeps the 
meat moist enough to permit the juices to flow, while the 
oven heat is intense enough to develop a rich flavor in both 
meat and broth. 

Three pounds of beef from the lower part of the round. 



MRS. DE GRAF'S COOK BOOK [97] 

2 thin slices of fat salt pork, or drippings, yi cup of carrot, 
turnip, onion and celery, or onion only if other vegetables 
are not available. Try out pork and remove scraps or melt 
drippings. Wipe meat, sprinkle with salt and pepper, 
dredge with flour, and brown entire surface in hot fat. 
When turning meat, avoid piercing with fork or skewer, 
which allows the inner juices to escape. Place in deep 
heavy kettle or casserole, surround with vegetables and 3 
cups of boiling water, add 2 whole cloves and a tiny bit of 
bay leaf; cover closely and cook about 4 hours in a very 
slow oven, basting every half hour and turning after the 
second hour. Throughout the cooking the liquid should 
be kept below the boiling point. 

When cooked remove the meat and strain the liquid 
remaining; remove vegetables, which are used for flavoring 
only. For each cupful of liquid allow 1 level tablespoon- 
ful of flour and 1 tablespoonful of beef dripping. Melt 
the fat, add flour, mix until smooth, then cook until frothy 
and add liquid and stir until mixture thickens. Several 
olives, green or ripe, or a tablespoonful of horseradish may 
be added to the sauce. If the water has not been 
allowed to boil, there should be sufiicient liquid to make 
the sauce. 

Casserole of Beef 

Cut round steak or flank in pieces about 2 inches square; 
roll in flour and let brown in salt pork fat or drippings; 
remove to a casserole and add broth or hot water to cover; 
add more fat to the pan and in it brown a small onion for 
each service, add these to the casserole; cover and let cook 
about 2 hours, or until nearly tender. Cut 3 potatoes and 

3 carrots in cubes; parboil S minutes, then brown in a 
frying pan, add to meat yi hour before serving together 
with seasoning of salt and pepper. Serve from the baking 
dish or in individual casseroles. 



Boiled Beef 

Add meat to rapidly boiling unsalted water suflRcient to 
cover. Reduce heat at once, cover closely and cook below 



[98] MRS. DE GRAF'S COOK BOOK 

the boiling point or at the simmering point until meat is so 
tender it almost breaks to pieces. Allow about 45 minutes 
cooking for each pound of meat. Drain and serve with a 
horseradish sauce. A very tough, inexpensive piece of 
meat can be made very palatable cooked in this manner. 
Sliced onions, carrots, etc., may be added to the water to 
impart flavor to the meat. 

Brown Beef Stew with Dumplings 

Remove all fat and gristle from 1^ pounds of beef; cut 
into cubes. Dredge meat with flour. Heat 3 tablespoons 
of fat and add 1 small onion minced flne. Add meat and 
fry until well browned. Add 3 cups of boiling water and 
salt and pepper to taste. Cover closely and cook at 
simmering point about 2 hours. Fifteen minutes before 
stew is to be served add dumplings; cover closely and 
steam 12 minutes. For dumplings take 1 cupful of sifted 
flour, 2 teaspoons of baking powder, yi teaspoon of salt 
and about M cupful of milk. Sift dry ingredients and add 
milk slowly, beating until smooth. Drop by spoonfuls over 
top of steaming hot stew, cover closely and steam 12 
minutes. 

Corned Beef or Boiled Dinner 

Wipe meat and put in a kettle. Cover with cold water 
and bring very slowly to the boiling point. Remove all 
scum and reduce heat to simmering. Cook until tender; it 
usually takes about 1 hour for each pound of corned beef. 
Prepare cabbage, turnips, carrots and potatoes for boiling, 
cut cabbage into eighths, removing all tough outer leaves. 
Cut carrots in halves and the turnips and potatoes in 
sizes to correspond with the carrots. Remove the cooked 
corn beef to a casserole or covered kettle to keep hot. Take 
fat off of the top of the water the beef was cooked in; 
bring to the boiling point, add vegetables and cook until 
tender, allowing about 25 minutes. Do not overcook 
cabbage; it should hold its shape. Place meat on a hot 
platter, surround with potatoes, turnips, and carrots. 
Serve cabbage in a separate dish.

Lamb 

Breast of lamb, while rather wasteful in appearance, is 
one of the most economical parts of the animal. It is 
always less in price than the loin or leg, and can be used in 
many different ways. The small, soft bones add flavor to 
this particular cut, which is not the case in any other cut 
of lamb. It may be stuffed and baked or breaded and 
baked, serving with a tomato sauce or made into a stew. 

Roasted Breast of Lamb 

Remove the outer skin from a breast of lamb and score 
m the direction of the rib bones, in pieces for serving. 
Dredge with flour, place 2 or 3 slices of salt pork or bacon 
over the top and place in a moderately hot oven. Turn so 
that all the surface will be well browned, reduce heat and 
cook until tender, basting several times. Serve with a 
tomato sauce. 

Lamb Stew 

Take 2 pounds of breast of lamb cut in small pieces for 
serviiig. Dredge with flour and fry a golden brown in hot 
drippings. Place in a covered saucepan or casserole, 
sprinkle with salt and pepper and cover with strained 
tomatoes. If one quart can is not sufficient, add boiling 
water. Cover closely and cook slowly under boiling point 
until meat is tender. Can be cooked in the oven or on top 
of the stove. An hour before serving parboil 6 very small 
onions S minutes in boiling water. Add to meat, also 1 
cupful of cooked peas, cook until onions are tender. Thick- 
ening should not be necessary, but if the sauce is too thin, 
remove meat and vegetables to a hot platter and thicken 
the sauce with flour and water which has been well blended 
and strained. One tablespoon of flour should be sufficient. 

Boiled Lamb or Mutton 

Remove all the tough outside skin. Cover with boiling 
water and let boil S minutes, simmer until tender, about 
15 minutes for each pound; add salt and pepper when 
meat is half cooked. Serve with a caper sauce. The 
liquid remaining should be allowed to cool, then remove 
all fat. Heat slowly and simmer until reduced one-third. 



[100] MRS. DE GRAF'S COOK BOOK 

Finely chopped onion or soup vegetables may be added 
about an hour before serving. Also a cupful of cooked 
pearl barley or rice. This makes a very palatable soup. 



Breaded Lamb Chops 

Wipe with a damp cloth and trim ofF all fat; sprinkle 
with salt and pepper; dip in fine bread crumbs then in egg 
which has been beaten and had 1 tablespoonful of cold 
water added. Dip in crumbs again. Fry in deep fat about 
8 minutes (see deep fat frying) or melt 3 tablespoons of 
drippings in a heavy frying pan and cook until crisp on 
both sides. 

Breaded Veal Cutlets 

Wipe with a damp cloth. Place in a frying pan, cover 
with boiling water and simmer about 10 minutes. Drain, 
diry, dip in fine bread crumbs, then in slightly beaten egg 
diluted with 1 tablespoonful of cold water; dip in crumbs 
again and fry in deep fat (see deep fat frying) or cook in 
melted drippings in a heavy frying pan until brown on each 
side. 

For cooking veal follow any of the recipes for cooking 
lamb. 

Shoulder of Pork 

Have bones removed from the shoulder of a young pig. 
Make a dressing by mixing 2 cups of soft bread crumbs, 
seasoned with yi teaspoon each of salt, pepper, sage and 
a little chopped celery; moisten with M cup of melted 
butter and fill the space where the bone was removed. 
Take a few stitches with a larding needle to hold the dress- 
ing in place; dredge the meat with flour and place in a 
moderate oven; baste frequently. Peel an apple for each 
service. For 6 apples make a syrup of 1 cup each of sugar 
and water; cook the apples in the syrup, turning often and 
taking care not to break. When tender, remove to a pan, 
sprinkle with sugar and brown in the oven. Use as a 
garnish for the pork. 



MRS. DE GRAF'S COOK BOOK [101] 

Baked Ham 

Scrub a medium sized ham and soak in cold water over 
night. In the morning drain, cover with fresh cold water 
and bring slowly to the simmering point. Cook until 
tender or until a fork will pierce it easily. Take from 
kettle, remove all skin and trim off all undesirable portions. 
Stick the fat portion full of whole cloves and cover with 
brown sugar. Return to a moderate oven to brown. 

The ham may be boiled a day before required. It will 
take about 1 hour to reheat in the oven. A choice ham will 
of course be the best, but the small picnic hams or shoulders 
are inexpensive and cooked in this manner will be found 
very palatable. 

Tripe and Sweetbreads 

There are two varieties of meat that are first made 
tender by long slow cooking and then broiled. These are 
tripe and sweetbreads. Tripe is usually inexpensive 
while sweetbreads are considered a delicacy and bring a 
high price in most localities. Tripe may be purchased 
fresh or pickled. It should be covered with boiling water 
and slowly simmered until tender; then it is ready for the 
various methods of preparation. 

Sweetbreads spoil very quickly and should be cooked the 
day they are purchased. Soak in cold water at least an 
hour, changing the water several times; remove skin, 
veins, etc., cover with boiling salted water, add 1 teaspoon- 
ful of lemon juice or vinegar and let simmer until tender, 
about 30 minutes. Drain, cover with cold water for lO 
minutes, then wipe dry and they are ready to use for the 
various dishes. 

Broiled Sweetbreads 

Cut the cooked sweetbreads in halves lengthwise and 
brush over with melted butter and broil, having a 
moderate heat, about S minutes. Turn several times 
and baste with melted butter at least once. Place on a 
hot platter spread with creamed butter to which 1 tea- 
spoonful of lemon juice has been added. 



[102] MRS. DE GRAF'S COOK BOOK 

BroUed Tripe 

Cut cooked tripe in pieces for serving. Brush over with 
melted butter, dip in fine bread crumbs and set on a well- 
greased broiler. Cook about 6 minutes, turning twice. 
Spread with creamed butter seasoned with a little lemon 
juice. 

Braised Beef Tongue 

Use a fresh tongue. Place in a deep kettle, cover with 

• boiling water and simmer for about 2 hours. Take from 

kettle and remove skin, roots, etc. Place in a deep baking 

pan and surround with y^ cupful each of diced carrots, 

onion and celery. 

Melt 3 tablespoons of drippings or butter; add 3 table- 
spoons of flour and cook together until well browned. Add 
3 cupfuls of the water in which tongue was cooked. Stir 
until thick, then season with salt, pepper, a teaspoonful 
of Worcestershire sauce and 3 tablespoons of finely 
chopped sour pickles. Pour sauce over the tongue, cover 
closely and bake in a moderate oven about 2 hours. Serve 
on a hot platter and strain the sauce into a bowl. The 
vegetables are added for flavor only. 

Kidney Saute 

Split kidneys in halves and remove all fat and tissue. 
Cover with cold water and heat over a moderate fire to the 
scalding point. Do not boil. Drain and cut into small 
pieces. Again cover with cold water and scald. Drain. 
Melt 2 tablespoons of butter or substitute, add 2 table- 
spoons of flour and cook until brown. Add 1 cup of water 
in which the kidneys were scalded or 1 cup of stock. Cook 
until somewhat thickened, then season with pepper and 
salt, 1 teaspoonful of Worcestershire sauce and the kid- 
neys. Stir until heated and pour over slices of toast cut 
in triangles. 

If kidneys are cooked rapidly, they become very tough. 
Cooked a very short time they will be tender, or they may 
be cooked a very long time and then will be satisfactory. 
They first become tough, but the long slow cooking 
makes then tender again. 



MRS. DE GRAF'S COOK BOOK [103] 

Bacon 

Have bacon cut in very thin slices and lay on the wires 
of a toaster or double broiler. This will keep each piece 
flat. Set over a pan in a moderate oven and cook until 
browned and crisp, ^erve at once. The bacon may be 
fried in a frying pan. Turn often and have only a moderate 
heat. 

Liver and Bacon 

Pour boiling water over slices of calves liver and let 
stand about S minutes. Drain and dry each slice and dip 
in flour. Heat 4 tablespoons of bacon fat and fry the 
liver until brown on each side. Have only a moderate 
heat. If cooked too fast or too long, liver will be tough and 
tasteless. 

Broiled or Fried Ham 

Cover ham slices with boiling water and simmer 10 
minutes. Drain, dry and pan broil or cook in the broiler 
until a delicate brown. Have only a moderate heat. 
Cooked too fast and too long ham is hard and tough.

Selecting and Preparing Poultry and Game 

The proper selection of poultry is not an easy task. It re- 
quires experience, and usually it is necessary to depend 
somewhat upon the judgment and honesty of the dealer. 
In making a selection, see that the flesh is firm and that 
there is a fair amount of fat underneath the skin. The fat 
should be a yellow color. An overfat bird is not economical 
and, owing to the flesh being greasy, it is less digestible and 
delicate in flavor. 

When fresh and in good condition, the skin of a turkey 
should look clear and unwrinkled. When young, all 
poultry should have a flexible breast bone, smooth, pliable 
legs and soft feet. If the spurs are large, the legs hard, 
feet scaly, breast bone rigid and with long hairs, the bird 
is no longer young. 

The question of age and toughness affect its palatability 
rather than the nutritive value. In fact, a tough old bird 
may be steamed or fricasseed and be found very delicious. 

Be careful to note that poultry is free from all dis- 
coloration and that the eyes are clear. Long, thin, 
purplish necks also denote age. Chickens and fowl have 
certain characteristics which make them easily distin- 
guishable. Chickens have soft feet, flexible breast bone, 
many pin feathers and a very small quantity of fat; fowls 
have hard and scaly feet, a rigid breast bone, long hairs and 
a large amount of fat. 

When a chicken is to be fried or roasted, the question of 
tenderness is of great importance. The size of a chicken 
usually indicates its age. The broiler will be small and " 
more tender than the frying chicken, and the frying 
chicken smaller and more tender than the one for roasting. 
The more flexible the breast bone the more tender the bird. 

Young tame ducks have yellow feet and bills. As they 
become older these turn darker and become red. The wild 
duck has small reddish feet, either young or old. The legs of 
a young bird will be smooth and the webbing of the feet 
soft. 

The legs of geese should be pliable and yellow and the 
webbing of the feet soft. The bill also should be pliable, 



MRS. DE GRAF'S COOK BOOK [105] 

the breast plump and the skin smooth. Geese should always 
be eaten young. 

If the birds have not been dressed by the market man, it 
will be necessary to attend to these details. If freshly 
killed, a turkey should be kept for at least 3 or 4 days 
before cooking, or the flesh will not be white and tender. 
It should not be dressed until it is to be prepared for 
cooking. 

When dressing poultry, first of all remove all pin 
feathers. This may be easily accomplished with a pair 
of broad tweezers. Then carefully singe the bird, turning 
constantly so that it will be thoroughly singed in every 
part. Remove the head, then crop attached to the gullet, 
and the windpipe may be drawn out of the neck opening. 
It is usually not necessary to make a slit in the neck, and 
this should be avoided, as the bird will make a much better 
appearance if it is to be roasted. Cut off about 2 inches 
of the neck, so that the skin may be folded back. 

The neck trimmings should be saved for making stock 
for gravy or soup. The tendons should be removed from 
the legs, for when cooked they form a disagreeable hard 
substance. To remove, carefully make an inch slit length- 
wise through the skin below the knee joint and at one side; 
on laying open the skin, the tendons, white, shiny cords, 
will be seen. Slip a skewer or large nail under each one 
and pull them out. If the bird is old this will be found a 
little hard to do. 

Never allow the tradesman to cut off the legs of poultry, 
for then the tendons cannot be removed. 

When tendons have been removed cut off the feet. Make 
a 2-inch incision near the vent, insert two fingers and care- 
fully loosen the entrails. When all are loose, grasp the 
hardest subtance, the gizzard, and pull it out^ Every- 
thing else will come with it, but be careful not to press any- 
thing; then there will be no danger of breaking the gall 
bladder. Insert the hand and remove the spongy sub- 
stances which lie under the breast in cavities; the kidneys 
will be found in similar cavities down the backbone. 

Let cold water run through the bird until it is thoroughly 
cleaned; then dry thoroughly and stuff at once. 

In cutting a bird for a fricassee, have sharp knives. Cut 



[106] MRS. DE GRAF'S COOK BOOK 

ofF the legs at the first joint, then separate at the second 
one. This is easily done if the legs are bent. Cut off wings 
and disjoint them. Separate breast bone from the back, 
divide back in 4 pieces, slit down the breast, cutting it in 
two. Each of these pieces may be cut in halves. 

To stuff and truss poultry for roasting, first put a little 
stuffing in the neck and fill in where the crop has been re- 
moved. Fold over the skin of the neck to the back and 
fasten with a small skewer or sew in place with a trussing 
needle. Then stuff the bird ^ full through the incision 
made in drawing. Tuck the tail into the opening and sew 
firmly into place. Now remove the oil bag by cutting 
around it with a sharp knife. 

If too much stuffing is used there will be no allowance 
for swelling and it might burst through. 

Pinion the wing close to the side and run a skewer 
through each side or a threaded trussing needle through 
the wing and bird to the other wing. Take a stitch to hold 
firmly and then run needle back through the bird again 
and tie the thread so it may easily be removed. This will 
hold the wings in place. Fasten the legs in the same 
manner. 

To prepare the giblets wash the heart and cut it in two 
lengthwise. The gall bladder is a little green sack attached 
to the liver. Great care should be taken not to break it, 
as it contains a very bitter substance. Cut through the 
thick part of the gizzard, empty it and pull out the tough 
inside skin. Put the giblets and trimmings from the neck 
in a quart of boiling water. Cook until tender; then chop 
giblets fine, strain the stock and use for a sauce or gravy, 
adding the chopped giblets. 

To cut chicken for stewing or frying: After dressing 
remove tendons, pin feathers and the oil bag. Cut through 
the flesh at the thigh, bend back legs and cut off. Separate 
second joint and drum stick. Remove wings and cut off 
the tips. Cut through the ribs to separate back from 
breast. Cut breast in two with a heavy knife or cleaver. 

Roast Turkey 

Dress, stuff and truss a 10 to 12 pound turkey. Mix 
y^ cup of butter or butter substitute with }4 cup of flour, 



MRS. DE GRAF'S COOK BOOK [107] 

cream well and rub the entire surface of the turkey with 
the mixture. Place in a large roasting pan and put into 
a hot oven. When the surface of the turkey begins to 
turn a delicate brown, reduce to a moderate heat. Baste 
every IS or 20 minutes. Add 2 tablespoons of butter to a 
cup of boiling water and use for basting. Allow about 
30 minutes' cooking for every pound of turkey. However, 
the time will depend largely upon the age of the bird. Old 
turkeys take long, slow cooking. 

Braised Turkey 

This method is suitable for an older, somewhat tough 
turkey. Prepare the bird as for roasting and with any 
desired dressing. Place several tablespoons of beef 
drippings or salt pork fat in the pan and allow it to melt. 
Then add a layer of the following vegetables cut in dice: 
Carrots, celery, onions, turnips and, if liked, one cup of 
tomato puree. Place the turkey on the vegetables and add 
enough stock or hot water to cover the vegetables only. 
Cover and cook in a moderate oven until the bird is tender. 
The time required will depend on the size and age of the 
fowl. Turn at least twice during the cooking. When 
cooked remove cover, dredge with flour and brown. 
Strain the stock, thicken and serve as a sauce. 

Roast Chicken 

Singe, dress, wash and dry a young chicken. Prepare a 
celery dressing of 2 cups dry bread crumbs, ^2 cup melted 
butter, yi cup diced celery, 1 teaspoonful salt, yi teaspoon- 
ful pepper and yi teaspoonful powdered sage. Stuff 
chicken, truss and rub over with olive oil or melted butter, 
dredge with flour and let roast until tender in a moderate 
oven, basting every 15 minutes. Add 2 tablespoons of 
butter to a cupful of hot water for basting. Serve with 
giblet sauce. As roast chicken is apt to be somewhat dry, 
It should be basted often or cooked in a double roaster. 

Chicken Fricassee 

Cut through the flesh of the chicken at the thigh; bend 
back legs and cut ofi^. Separate second joint and drum- 



[108] MRS. DE GRAF'S COOK BOOK 

stick. Remove wings and cut ofF tips. Cut through the 
ribs to separate back from breast. Cut back into 3 pieces 
and breast in 2 parts. Roll each piece of chicken in flour, 
sprinkle with salt, and brown in melted chicken fat or salt 
pork. When each piece is a delicate brown remove to a 
sauce pan, add 1 cup of water to the pan and cook 5 min- 
utes. Pour over chicken with enough more boiling water 
to cover. Cook, closely covered, at the simmering point 
until chicken is tender. Remove chicken from kettle with 
a skimmer. Remove fat from liquid and add 1 cup of rich 
milk (more if needed). Allow 1 j^ tablespoons of flour for 
each cupful of liquid. Mix to a smooth paste with cold 
water, strain and add to stock and cook until thickened. 
Season with salt and pepper. Pour over chicken and 
serve with hot biscuits or dumplings. 

Chicken Casserole 

Cut up chicken as for fricassee. Roll each piece in flour, 
sprinkle with salt and pepper, place in a casserole and just 
cover with boiling water. Cook in a slow oven until 
chicken is tender. Add 1 cup of rich milk or thin cream, 
thicken slightly and serve. For thickening allow \}4 
tablespoons of flour for each cup of liquid. 

Chicken Pie 

Cut chicken as for fricassee. Sprinkle with salt, pepper 
and roll in flour. Fry until a golden brown, then cover 
with boiling water or stock, and gently simmer until 
tender. Remove chicken to a baking dish, remove fat 
from stock, thicken, allowing lyi tablespoons of flour 
for each cupful of liquid. Cover chicken with gravy and 
place a flaky pastry on top. Bake in a hot oven. The 
chicken may be prepared a day in advance and set away 
in a cool place until required. If preferred all bones may 
be removed after chicken is cooked, then add to gravy and 
place on pastry. 

Stewed Chicken 

Cut chicken up and cover the pieces with boiling water. 
Simmer until tender, adding salt when half cooked. Re- 
move chicken to a hot platter and thicken the liquid. 



MRS. DE GRAF'S COOK BOOK [109] 

allowing 1^ tablespoons of flour for each cup of stock. 
Mix to a smooth paste with cold water and strain. Cook 
10 minutes. Pour over chicken or return chicken to 
kettle and make drop dumplings. 

Oven Cooked Young Chicken 

Split young frying chicken or broilers. Dredge with 
flour. Place in a baking jjan and dot with butter or 
strips of salt pork. Bake in a hot oven until a golden 
brown. 

Fried Chicken 

Unless very young and tender, chicken should first be 
stewed before frying. Drain and dry then sprinkle with 
salt and dip each piece in flour, then in slightly beaten egg 
diluted with 1 tablespoon of cold water; dip in flour again 
and fry in hot chicken fat, salt pork or butter. 

Chicken Maryland 

Prepare chicken as for fried chicken. When chicken is 
cooked remove to a hot platter. Make a sauce of 3 table- 
spoons of butter melted in the pan the chicken was cooked 
in. Add 3 tablespoons of flour. Mix until blended but not 
brown, add 2 cupfuls of rich milk or chicken stock; stir 
until creamy. Season with salt and pepper and pour 
around the chicken or serve in a separate bowl. Garnish 
with strips of bacon and corn fritters. 

Chicken Paprika 

Fry chicken and surround with paprika sauce. Garnish 
with toast points. 

Roast Duck 

Dress in the same manner as for chicken, wash well with 
salted water. Truss into shape with a larding needle or 
skewers. 

Place several stalks of celery inside the bird and set in a 
very hot oven. The time required for cooking is 18 
minutes if liked rare to 40 minutes if desired well done. 
There is a difference of opinion as to whether ducks should 
be salted before or after cooking. It is really a matter of 
taste.

Souffles 




SOUFFLE is in reality a baked omelet in which the 
eggs have been beaten separately. The air which 
has been incorporated into the egg whites causes 
the mixture to pufF up. The general impression 
that they are difficult to make gives this dish a certain dis- 
tinction. However, there is no reason why anyone should 
not be able to make a perfect souffle if the oven is carefully 
managed. 

Souffles should go directly from the oven to the table, 
and it is a wise precaution to cover the souffl6 while carry- 
ing it to the table so that the cooler air of the room will not 
make it fall. The plain omelet souffl6 is the most difficult 
to make. Those made with a cooked foundation (a thick 
white sauce) do not fall so readily. The whites of eggs 
must be beaten until filled with air and should be folded in- 
to the mixture, not stirred or beaten. The souffle is then 
placed in a moderate oven, where the heated air expands 
and puffs up the whole mixture. The baking is con- 
tinued until the air cells are hardened enough to support 
its weight and the souffle must be served at once before 
the enclosed air cools, which causes the souffle to collapse. 

When sufficiently baked the souffle will feel dry and firm, 
like a sponge cake. Deep ring molds are very attractive 
for vegetable souffles. They may then be turned out 
on a serving dish and the center filled with creamed fish, 
sweetbreads, mushrooms or chicken. The vegetables are 
always previously cooked and either mashed or put through 
a puree strainer. 

Souffles may be divided into two classes, savory and 
sweet souffles. The savory souffl6 offers a variety of 
luncheon and dinner dishes in which many left-overs can 
be utilized. The savory souffles can be made entirely of 
eggs and vegetables or may have a thick white sauce as a 
foundation, making them much more substantial and also 
easier to bake. The fruit souffles are made of eggs and 
fruit pulp. 

All souffle, whether sweet or savory, should be served 
with a sauce of some kind. When mixtures contain a num- 



MRS. DE GRAF'S COOK BOOK [115] 

ber of eggs beaten separately, they are usually dry, and 
need a sauce to furnish moisture. 

Bake souffles in an ungreased dish (except when using a 
ring mold where it is removed from the pan), set in a pan 
of hot water, keeping water below the boiling point. Serve 
from the dish in which it was baked. 

Timbales offer a very satisfactory way to use small 
quantities of cooked food. They are really a savory cus- 
tard. Timbales are cooked by poaching and are unmolded 
before serving. 

Spinach Souffle or Ring 

2 tablespoons of butter or sub- J^ cup grated or finely cut 

stitute. cheese. 

2 tablespoons flour. ^ teaspoon salt. 

}^ cup milk. i4 teaspoon paprika. 

1 cup finely chopped spinach, or Few grains of nutmeg or mace, 
spinach puree. 3 eggs separated. 

Melt butter, add flour, mix until smooth, and cook 
until frothy; then add cold milk, stir constantly, until 
quite thick; add cheese, spinach, beaten yolks and season- 
ings; fold in stiffly beaten egg whites, pour into a baking 
dish, set dish in hot water and bake in a moderate oven 
about 30 minutes. 

Very attractive if baked in a ring mold and the center 
filled with creamed sweetbreads, shellfish, or chicken. If 
the souffle is to be unmolded it must be baked in a buttered 
form. Before unmolding let stand a few seconds after 
removing from the oven. To test run a sharp knife through 
the center. If it comes out clean, the soufl[16 is cooked. If 
not cooked sufliciently, the soufil6 will fall. Any vegetable 
may replace the spinach. 

Ham, Chicken or Fish Souffle 

2 tablespoons of butter or sub- J^ teaspoon salt. 

stitute. K green pepper finely chopped 

2 tablespoons flour. (may be omitted). 

1 cup milk. 3 eggs separated. 

}4 cup soft bread crumbs. 
1 cup finely chopped ham or 

chicken or flaked fish. 

Melt butter, add flour, mix well and cook until frothy, 
then add milkfand stir constantly until thickened. Add 



[116] MRS. DE GRAF'S COOK BOOK 

bread crumbs, ham, seasonings and well-beaten egg yolks. 
Remove from fire and fold in the stiffly beaten whites of 
eggs. Pile in a baking dish, set in pan of hot water and 
bake in a moderate oven about 30 minutes. Cooked vege- 
tables, such as peas or asparagus tips, may also be added to 
these souffles. In that case put a layer of the souffle 
in the baking dish, then a layer of the vegetable, then 
souffl6 until all is used. Serve with a suitable sauce. This 
type of souffl6 may also be baked in a ring mold and the 
center filled with creamed vegetables. These combina- 
tion dishes are very attractive for guest luncheons. 

Potato Souffle 

2 cups well seasoned hot 1 teaspoon parsley, 
mashed potatoes. Few grains mace or nutmeg. 

1 tablespoon butter. J^ cup of grated cheese. 

3 eggs separated. 

Melt butter in a saucepan, add mashed potatoes, 
seasonings and well beaten yolks; beat all together, then 
fold in the stiffly beaten egg whites. Bake in a rather quick 
oven. Cheese may be omitted. This souffle is not so 
delicate, so can be baked without the hot water. 

Asparagus Souffle 

2 tablespoons butter. 1 cup asparagus puree. 
2 tablespoons flour. M cup asparagus tips. 
y^ teaspoon salt. M cup grated cheese. 
Yi cup of milk. 3 eggs separated. 

Melt the butter, add flour, mix until smooth, then cook 
until frothy, add milk and asparagus puree. Cook until 
thick, then add beaten egg yolks and cheese. Fold in the 
asparagus tips, and the whites of the stiffly beaten eggs. 
Pour into a baking dish or individual molds, set in a pan 
of hot water and bake in a moderate oven until firm. 

Carrot Ring 

One cup cooked carrots rubbed through a coarse sieve; 
yi cup thick white sauce; 3 eggs, beaten separately; yi 
teaspoon salt; J^ teaspoon pepper. 

Combine carrots and white sauce; add seasonings. Beat 



MRS. DE GRAF'S COOK BOOK [ 117J 

eggs separately; add yolks, then fold in the stiffly beaten 
egg whites. Pour into a buttered ring mold; stand in pan 
of hot water and bake in a moderate oven until firm. Re- 
move from pan of hot water and let stand two or three 
minutes, then turn out on a serving platter. Fill the 
center with creamed veal, fish or chicken. Any vegetable 
pulp may be used in the same manner, adding seasoning 
suitable to the particular vegetable. 

Thick White Sauce 

J^ cup milk. 2 tablespoons flour. 

2 tablespoons butter or ^ teaspoon salt, 

substitute. 

Melt butter, remove from fire, add flour and stir until 
well blended. Set over fire, cook until frothy, then add cold 
milk and stir constantly until very thick. Add salt. 
Foundation sauce for souffles. 

Savory Timbales 

2 tablespoons butter. 1 cup milk. 

}/i cup bread crumbs. 1 egg. 

1 cup chopped meat or fish Salt and pepper, 
(veal, chicken, ham). 1 teaspoonful of grated onion. 

Melt butter, add bread crumbs and milk, cook about 5 
minutes, stirring constantly; add chopped meat and egg, 
beaten slightly; season and turn into well-greased custard 
cups or muffin pans; set in a pan of hot water and bake in a 
moderate oven about 20 minutes or until firm in the center. 
Do not allow the water to boil. 

After removing from the oven let stand a few seconds 
before turning from the molds. Serve with a sauce suitable 
for the kind of meat used. DilFerent seasonings, such as 
chopped olives, pimentoes or mushrooms, may be added. 
Combinations of meat and vegetables also can be used. 

Vegetable Timbales 

Follow the recipe for savory timbales, using 1 cupful of 
mashed pureed vegetables.

Meat Substitutes 

The meat course can easily be dispensed with by making 
attractive vegetable, egg or cheese dishes. Most doctors 
and dietitians claim that the average American family 
eat more meat than is required, so why not plan to have at 
least one dinner a week meatless ? It will usually be found 
less expensive and the household would be benefited also. 

Of course, the family must be supplied with food fully 
as valuable to the diet as meat, and in order to accomplish 
this the housewife must understand a few fundamental 
principles governing the proper selection and combinations 
of food. 

The average housekeeper will hold up her hands in 
despair when food values are suggested, and to many the 
subject seems too scientific to grasp, and in a measure this 
is true. However, the following giiide is not at all compli- 
cated, and the progressive housewife of today will do much 
better when planning meals, meatless or otherwise, if she 
thoroughly understands these principles. 

The body needs material to build up and repair the wear 
and tear caused by activity, also fuel to burn, making ac- 
tivity possible. 

Protein is a distinct repairing or tissue building material, 
and is found in quantities in meat, fish, eggs, cheese, milk 
and nuts. 

Carbohydrates (sugar and starches) and the fats furnish 
the fuel for activity, and include sugar, molasses, honey, 
ripe and dried fruits, starchy vegetables, and cereals. 

Foods rich in both protein and carbohydrates are peas, 
beans, lentils, oatmeal and wheat products; this includes 
all breads. 

The body also requires mineral salts, which are supplied 
mainly in the various green and dried vegetables, fresh and 
dried fruits. Bulk or quantity is furnished also in the last 
named foods. 

This, of course, only touches very briefly on the subject 
of food values, but a comprehensive understanding of just 
these few principles will prove helpful when planning meals, 
and a properly balanced meal need not be a complicated. 



MRS. DE GRAF'S COOK BOOK [119] 

difficult one to prepare, but may be of the greatest simplic- 
ity or mayofFer as great a variety as desired, provided they 
contain the proper combination of foods; in other words, 
some protein, some carbohydrates and fat, some mineral 
salts and the necessary bulk. 

The list of meat substitutes is a long and varied one. Eggs 
are fully as valuable as meat in both food value and digesti- 
bility. 

Beans or lentils may take the place of meat. Boston 
baked beans, if properly prepared, are usually popular. 
Stuffed peppers' or tomatoes make satisfactory luncheon or 
supper dishes. 

The possibilities of cheese combined with other food 
materials are numerous and these combinations may be 
served in place of meat. Cheese has twice the food value 
of meat; there is comparatively no waste, and it has the 
advantage of keeping qualities and requires very little 
preliminary preparation. Even with the prevailing high 
prices, cheese will be found economical when compared 
with other foods of equal nutritive value. The different 
varieties of cheese are used chiefly for their flavor, and used 
in such small quantities, have very little value in the diet 
other than to make the meal attractive and palatable. 
Cream or soft cheese is usually served in this manner and 
is more easily digested thannard cheese. 

One reason, perhaps, why cheese is not more commonly 
used as a meat substitute is due to the fact that because of 
its concentration it is not easily digested. This, however, 
may be largely overcome by grating or cutting into small 
bits then melted with milk, or in combination with other 
ingredients. A very small quantity of baking soda is an 
aid in making cheese soluble. 

Cheese can be overcooked; it is hardened by high heat 
and care should be taken that the food materials combined 
with cheese be thoroughly cooked before the combination 
is made. If merely melted, cheese is probably as digestible, 
if used moderately, as many cooked meats; but when it has 
been overheated in cooking it usually contains burned fats. 
This causes indigestion, and the blame should not be laid to 
the composition of the food but to careless cooking. 

In planning menus of which cheese forms the main dish, 



[120] MRS. DE GRAF'S COOK BOOK 

supply crisp vegetables, such as lettuce, celery, fruit 
salads, and for desserts something light, either fresh or 
cooked fruits or gelatin, plain cookies or fruit shortcakes. 
If cheese is used in quantity it is necessary to diminish 
other protein and fat foods in order that the meal may not 
be too hearty. Vegetables and soups may be cooked with 
cheese, and in such dishes the cheese is added for both 
nutritive value and flavor. 

The housewife whose family is fond of cheese can find 
an almost unlimited variety of combinations. To keep 
cheese free from mold, wrap in a slightly damp cloth and 
keep cool. 

Boston Baked Beans 

2 cups small white beans. 2 tablespoons molasses. 

yi pound fat salt pork. ^ teaspoon dry mustard. 

2 teaspoons salt. 1 cup boiling water. 

Pick over beans, wash well, cover with cold water and 
soak over night. In the morning drain, cover with cold 
water and heat slowly, keeping water below boiling point, 
and cook until the skins will burst. This may be deter- 
mined by taking a few beans on a spoon and blowing on 
them. The skins will burst if beans are sufficiently cooked. 
Drain again, cut salt pork in two pieces, placing one piece 
in the bottom of the bean pot. Put beans in pot, place the 
other piece of pork on top of beans. - Add seasoning to the 
boiling water and pour over beans, adding enough more 
boiling water to cover. Place the cover on bean pot and 
bake slowly about 6 hours. Add more boiling water as 
needed and uncover beans during last hour of baking. An 
earthenware bean pot produces the best results. 

Pink Beans, Spanish 

2 cups beans. 2 pimentos. 

1 onion. 1 tablespoon butter. 

1 cup strained tomato or 1 1 teaspoon salt, 
can chili tomato sauce. 

Wash and soak beans over night. Drain, cover with 
fresh boiling water and cook under boiling point for half 
an hour. Drairi again, cover with fresh boiling water and 
cook gently until tender, or about 1 hour. Do not allow to 
reach boiling point. Chop the onion and pimentos, and 



MRS. DE GRAF'S COOK BOOK [121] 

cook in the butter until the onion is soft, but not brown; 
then add seasoning and tomato. Drain beans, pour over 
the sauce and simmer for about 30 minutes. Serve with 
boiled rice or hominy. If using chili tomato sauce the 
pimentos may be omitted, and if desired highly seasoned, 
use 4 or S tiny dried red peppers or a few drops of pepper 
sauce.

The Use of Left-Overs 

Every housewife faces the problem of "left-overs." To 
utilize and prepare them into satisfactory dishes requires 
more skill and inventiveness than to cook the raw food, 
and this branch of cookery is an art in itself. The thrifty 
home-maker uses all the left-overs. Living has been much 
too high for the average person to ignore this type of 
cookery. 

Food can so easily be spoiled by reheating. Take meats 
for example. A tender piece of roast beef reheated for 
ten minutes will be tough. This applies to almost all 
cooked meats. If sliced very thin and hot sauce or gravy 
poured over the slices, the meat will be tender; but if 
added to the hot gravy in an attempt to reheat it will 
invariably toughen. Meat must be cooked a long time 
when reheating if it is to be tender, the theory being that 
it will toughen at first, but will become tender by long, 
slow cooking. For this reason the covered casserole dishes 
have become almost indispensable. 

A casserole is used for cooking foods that require slow 
cooking for either a short or long period. The dish is 
covered to keep in all the steam, and to retain flavor. 
Dicing food takes more time than chopping or putting 
through a food grinder, but if one has the time, diced meat 
will present a much more attractive appearance, as well 
as being more palatable. Diced meat or fish may be com- 
bined with a white sauce, adding cubes of cooked potatoes, 
several tablespoons of cooked peas and diced carrots. If 
meat is used, salt, pepper and onion juice can be the season- 
ing; if fish, add a little lemon juice also, or a finely chopped 
sour pickle. Or add the diced meat to k tomato sauce, 
seasoning well with onion and chopped green peppers, 
adding six or eight ripe or green olives. A meat pie is 
always acceptable. Dice meat, add to thickened, well 
seasoned gravy or sauce, adding cooked potatoes cut in 
cubes, and small boiled onions and any other left-over 
vegetables, such as peas, carrots, turnips or cauliflower. 
Place in a casserole or baking dish. Make a plain pie 
crust or biscuit dough for top and bake in a moderately 



[128] MRS. DE GRAF'S COOK BOOK 

hot oven. This may be prepared in the morning, and the 
crust made, but not added until the pie goes into the oven. 

Smaller quantities of left-over meat or fish may be 
chopped and made into souffles, timbales or croquettes, 
or added to a well-seasoned white sauce and served on 
toast, or in ramekins or a baking dish, the top covered 
with buttered crumbs and then browned in the oven. The 
white sauce, made of butter or substitute and milk, supply 
additional food value to take the place of the smaller quan- 
tity of meat or fish. 

One most important factor in the success of these dishes 
is in careful preparation. All bones, gristle, skin or tough, 
undesirable portions should be removed and discarded. If 
there are large meat bones, as in a roast of lamb, these may 
be broken — adding two or three cupfuls of cold water, also 
an onion. Simmer for an hour or more and use as a base 
for gravy or sauce. 

A cupful of chopped meat or fish will make a souffle, 
croquettes, timbales or creamed meat in ramekins for four 
persons. 

Left-over vegetables can be reheated in a white sauce, 
used for cream soups or chowders; scalloped, made into au 
gratin dishes, added to a fritter batter and fried in deep fat 
or used in salad. 

Almost any combination of vegetables makes an attrac- 
tive salad, providing it is accompanied with a well-made 
salad dressing. The left-over breakfast cereal may be 
molded, sliced, dipped in flour and fried a delicate brown, 
or half a cupful may replace the same quantity of flour in 
the breakfast griddle cakes or muffins; any fresh or cooked 
fruit can be mashed and poured over molded cold cereal 
for the children's dessert. 

Stale broken pieces of bread may be dried in a very slow 
oven, then rolled or put through the food grinder and stored 
in covered fruit jars. To be used in scalloped dishes, to 
bread cutlets, fish or croquettes. Or cut into very small 
cubes, dried in a slow oven for croutons for soup; made 
into dressing for stufi^ed poultry, meat, fish, tomatoes or 
eggplant. Any of the bread puddings are palatable, pro- 
vided too much bread has not been used. The old- 
fashioned custard bread pudding should not be made just 



MRS. DE GRAF'S COOK BOOK [129] 

to save bread, for that would not be an economy, as the 
other ingredients needed are too expensive merely to use 
up left-overs of bread. 

Small portions of cooked or raw tomatoes may make 
savory sauces. 

Sour milk should never be wasted. It can always be 
substituted for fresh milk in flour mixtures, using one-half 
teaspoonful of soda to each cupful of sour milk, omitting 
the baking powder; or the sour milk can be made into 
cottage cheese. 

All pieces of beef or chicken fat should be cut fine and 
carefully rendered to be used for frying. Fat left from fry- 
ing bacon or ham should be saved, but kept in a separate 
jar, as the smoked flavor is not desirable for all frying. 

Left-overs of fruit may be combined and used for salads 
or for dessert. Stale cake may be served for pudding, with 
the addition of a custard or chocolate pudding sauce; or 
the cake may be cut in finger lengths and used for char- 
lottes or charlotte russe. 

The greatest care should be given left-overs, so that 
they will be in proper condition to use later. Jelly glasses 
with covers are convenient for small portions of vegetables 
or fruit. 

The use of left-overs is unlimited, and while such cook- 
ery requires both consideration and time, the results will 
amply repay for the additional labor. 



[130] MRS. DE GRAF'S COOK BOOK 

Twice Cooked Meats 

Meat which is reheated or twice cooked is less nourishing 
than when first prepared because no matter how careful 
the cooking process, a certain amount of the nutritive 
juices will escape in the first cooking, although usually a 
portion of this is retained and served as a sauce or gravy. 
So the wise housewife prepares various savory sauces when 
reheating meat or fish, to overcome this loss of flavor and 
add to the palatability of these warmed over dishes. 

Twice cooked meat, if properly prepared, is very appe- 
tizing and not hard to digest — unless reheated in such a 
fashion as to render it tough and leathery. It is also neces- 
sary to bear in mind when preparing these various dishes, 
that the meat should never be actually twice cooked, but 
merely reheated. 

Whenever vegetables, sauces, etc., are to be added to 
cooked meat or fish, they should be thoroughly cooked 
before being combined with the ingredients to be reheated. 
The cooked meat or fish, when reheating, should be pro- 
tected if possible from coming in direct contact with the 
heat of the fire, oven or fat; which means that the reheat- 
ing process should be accomplished by adding the cooked 
food to a hot sauce, or be combined with other materials. 

The finer these cooked ingredients are the less time re- 
quired for reheating, and the more quickly will they absorb 
the sauce which is to give flavor to the dish. However, 
this does not mean to mash the meat or fish, but carefully 
chop it; also be careful to remove all bone, gristle and 
undesirable portions before chopping, and if cutting in 
cubes or slicing, have the pieces of uniform size, which will 
add greatly to the appearance of the finished dish. 

Any kind of cooked fish, meat and some vegetables may 
be used in making croquettes. Meat and fish croquettes 
are simply a finely chopped mixture combined with a 
thick sauce, then crumbed, shaped, dipped in egg, then in 
crumbs again and fried in deep fat. Whatever variety of 
meat or fish the rules for the sauce, molding and frying 
are the same. 



MRS. DE GRAF'S COOK BOOK [131] 

Lamb Curry 

Cut cold roast Iamb in thin slices. Prepare a sauce by 
melting 4 tablespoons of shortening, add yi slice onion and 
fry until a golden brown; remove onion from fat and add 
4 tablespoons of flour, yi teaspoon of salt, and 1 teaspoon 
of curry powder. Mix until smooth and add gradually 
2 cups of stock or warm water. Stir constantly until thick, 
then pour over sliced lamb. Stock can be made by adding 
a bouillon cube to water or using left-over gravy and water 
steamed before using. Garnish platter with hot cooked 
rice, molded in custard cups. 



Reheating Roast Beef 

Slice cold roast beef very thin and arrange on a warm 
platter. Just before serving pour a hot meat sauce or gravy 
over the slices of meat. If the beef is reheated and allowed 
to stand over the fire in the gravy it becomes tough. 

Corned Beef Hash 

Chop rather fine, equal quantities of cold corned beef, 
free from all fat and gristle, and cold boiled potatoes; heat 
about 3 tablespoons of shortening in a frying pan; turn 
in the chopped ingredients and add one-quarter cup of 
stock or milk and season with paprika; mix together, cover 
and let allow to brown, watching very carefully and stirring 
occasionally. Fold over and turn on a hot platter; pour a 
well-seasoned tomato sauce around the hash and garnish 
with baked bananas. 



Cottage Pie 

2 cups of diced cooked meat. 1 tablespoon of grated onion.

Creamed Dried Beef with Spaghetti 

1 cup dried beef. 2 hard cooked eggs. 

2 cups white sauce. 2 cups cooked hot spaghetti. 

Cover dried beef with cold water and slowly bring to the 
boiling point and drain. Cut the hard cooked eggs in 
slices. Prepare the white sauce, season and add the 
dried beef. Arrange the macaroni on a hot platter and 
pour over the creamed beef and garnish with the slices of 
hard cooked eggs. 

Chicken and Oyster Pie 

Arrange slices of cooked chicken and oysters in layers 
in a large or individual baking dish. Add a little 
chicken broth or oyster liquor and season. Cover the 
top with flaky pastry. Prick pastry to let out the steam. 
Bake in a hot oven. 



MRS. DE GRAF'S COOK BOOK [133] 

Rissoles 

Make any croquette mixture and set aside to cool. Pre- 
pare flaky pastry, roll out and cut in 3-inch rounds with a 
biscuit cutter. Place a spoonful of the croquette mixture 
in the center of half of the rounds of pastry, brush the edge 
of the pastry with cold water and place a round of pastry 
on top, pressing the edges firmly together. Prick each 
rissole with a fork and bake in a hot oven. 

Meat, Chicken or Fish au Gratin 

1 cup meat cut In cubes. ]4 cup bread crumbs. 

]4 cup grated cheese. j| teaspoon salt. 

1 cup tomato sauce. 1 cup cooked rice. 

Butter a baking dish, place a layer of rice and diced 
meat alternately until all is used. Add salt to tomato 
sauce and pour over the mixture. Mix cheese and bread 
crumbs and spread over the top. Place in a hot oven to 
brown. 

Tongue Piquante 

Make a piquante sauce. Place thin slices of cooked 
tongue in a casserole or baking dish, pour over the piquante 
sauce and set in the oven to heat. 

Creamed Sweetbreads 

Two cups blanched sweetbreads cut in dice. One small 
can button mushrooms; make a sauce with 4 tablespoons 
of melted butter, 4 tablespoons flour, mix well and cook 
until foamy; add 2 cups rich milk or thin cream and stir 
well until thick and creamy; season with j4 teaspoon salt, 
a dash of cayenne pepper and ground nutmeg. Add sweet- 
breads and mushrooms. Serve in ramekins. 

To blanch sweetbreads soak 1 hour in cold water, drain, 
cover with cold water, add 1 tablespoon of lemon juice 
or vinegar, 2 or 3 cloves, dash of pepper and a tiny piece of 
bay leaf; simmer about 15 minutes; drain and remove 
fibers.

Deep Fat Frying 



Deep fat frying is a method of cooking by immersing 
food in very hot fat. If properly fried, foods cooked in 
this manner should not be unwholesome to persons in 
normal health. Vegetable oils are the best fats to use for 
deep fat frying because they can be heated to a higher 
temperature before the burning point is reached than 
animal fats. Fat should be heated until just an indication 
of a delicate blue smoke or vapor arises. If the smoke is 
decidedly perceptible, the fat is too hot for use. Heated to 
the point when the smoke can just be noticed and the food 
to be fried added to the fat, the temperature will be 
immediately reduced to the right degree of heat. To test 
the fat have several cubes of bread when the fat is hot, 
but not smoking. Drop in one of these cubes of bread and 
count 40, about as the clock ticks. If the bread tums a 
golden brown in that time, the fat is ready for mixtures 
that require heating through, such as croquettes, fish balls, 
fritters of cooked fruit or vegetables which have only a 
coating of thin batter. If the foods to be fried are un- 
cooked mixtures, such as doughnuts or fillets of fish, the 
bread should take 60 seconds to brown. The fat should 
be tested each time before the food is added. 

To heat, place the fat in the kettle, cover and allow to 
heat gradually, watching carefully. 

A heavy kettle is always an advantage, as it may be 
kept at a more even temperature than a light-weight one. 
Any fat may be used, the vegetable oils now on the market 
proving very satisfactory. This includes both com and 
cottonseed oil, all of the lard substitutes, and, of course, 
the pure leaf lard. 

Unless a strong-flavored food has been cooked in the 
fat, such as onions, etc., it may be used over and over again 
if clarified after using. 

Frying baskets are a great convenience, particularly with 
delicate frying, as it saves handling. The articles to be 
fried are placed in the basket then submerged in the hot 
fat. When the food is brown, the basket is lifted out. In 
this way each article is perfect. 



MRS. DE GRAF'S COOK BOOK [135] 

If the fat bubbles or sputters while heating it denotes the 
presence of water, and it will be impossible to fry the food 
successfully, for the fat will not become hot enough. To 
overcome this condition, allow the water to evaporate, 
and then it will heat to the right temperature for frying. 

Fat which has been overheated at any time is unwhole- 
some and should not be used. It has become decomposed, 
and cooling and reheating will not restore it. The fat 
absorbed by food cooked in such fat will be irritating. 
After using fat for frying let stand until somewhat cool to 
allow any particles of food to settle. Then strain thro>igh 
a double thickness of cheese cloth to remove all remaining 
particles. If not overheated and carefully strained, vege- 
table fats can be used over and over a number of times. 
If fat becomes dark in color add a few slices of raw potato 
and heat very slowly. This will quickly absorb the various 
impurities and clarify it. To prevent food from absorbing 
fat have fat heated according to the test already given, 
using cubes of bread. Forty seconds for cooked mixtures, 
60 seconds for uncooked articles. Do not put too many 
cold articles in the fat at once, thereby reducing the heat 
too much. Test fat each time before food is added. Do, 
not have mixtures to be fried too rich. Do not use too 
much baking powder. And, except for flour mixtures, 
have food well coated with eggs and crumbs. The egg 
forms a coating which prevents the food absorbing fat if 
the temperature of the fat is correct. The flour mixtures 
should contain enough egg to prevent the mixture absorb- 
ing fat if the fat is of the right heat. 

Saut^ing is cooking food in a small quantity of fat; 
however, the term frying is more commonly used. Many 
experiments have been carried on to determine which 
method of cooking was preferable, deep fat frying or saut^- 
ing, and it has been decided that if properly done the 
deep fat method will absorb less fat than saut6ing or cook- 
ing in a small amount of fat.

Fritter Batter 

To be used for vegetables or fruit. 
i4 cup flour. 1 egg beaten. 

}i teaspoon salt. M cup milk. 

Mix ingredients with an egg beater until very smooth 
and free from lumps, beating with a rotary egg beater. 
Let stand an hour or more in a cool place before using. 

Take slices of pineapple, banana or any cooked fruit or 
cooked vegetable such as cauliflower, egg plant, etc., dip 
in batter to completely coat, then fry in deep fat until a 
golden brown. 

Swedish Timbale Gases 

1 egg. ]4, teaspoon salt. 

J^ cup milk. 1 teaspoon olive or other vege- 

^ cup flour. table oil. 

Beat eggs, add remaining ingredients and beat until 
very smooth, using the egg beater. The mixture should 
be very thin. Set aside in a cool place for an hour or more. 
Have fat deep enough to completely cover the timbale iron. 
Heat the iron with the fat. When fat is hot remove iron, 
drain and dip into the batter a little more than half its 
depth. Dip iron into fat at once, completely covering it 
with fat. The cases are cooked when a delicate brown. It 
may be necessary to test one or two before the batter is 
the right consistency. If the cases are not crisp the mix- 
ture is too thick and should be thinned with a little milk. 
If the batter does not cling to the timbale form, it is too 
hot. It requires a little skill to get them just right. 

To Shape Croquettes 

Allow one rounding tablespoon of the mixture for each 
croquette. Form into a ball, dip in sifted bread crumbs 
and form into any shape desired. This is a very simple 
process and requires very little practice to shape very 
attractive croquettes. 

When all the croquettes have been molded, dip in beaten 
egg diluted with one or two tablespoons of cold water, 
roll in crumbs again and set aside to fry. The item of first 
importance in frying is the temperature of the fat. When 



MRS. DE GRAF'S COOK BOOK [137] 

frying mixtures covered with egg and crumbs, the fat 
should be hot enough to stiffen this coating the instant it 
comes in contact with it, and the final browning should 
not take but a few seconds. The frying process should 
encase the croquettes in a crisp, delicately browned crust 
while being reheated. To accomplish this the fat should 
not be smoking hot but hot enough to turn a cube of 
bread a golden brown while you count 40. If you have 
made the croquettes the size suggested, a rounding table- 
spoon for each croquette, they should be a golden brown 
and well heated through. 

Frying Process 

Fry only four or five croquettes at one time, and be sure 
to test the temperature of the fat between each frying. 
When fried, drain the croquettes on several folds of soft 
paper, laid on a pan in a warm oven, having the oven door' 
open. 

Thick Wliite Sauce for Croquettes 

4 tablespoons'shortening. 1 cup cold milk. 

4 tablespoons flour. 

Melt shortening, add flour, stir until smooth; set over a 
fire, cook until frothy, then add cold milk and cook, stirring 
constantly until thick. Add seasonings and chopped food 
to the sauce; then cool. 

Thick Brown|Sauce for Croquettes 

Brown sauce is made from stock, or stock can be made 
in a minute's time by dissolving a bouillon cube in a cup 
of hot water. Use 4 tablespoons drippings for the short- 
ening, and when this is melted add several slices of onion 
and cook until a golden brown; then remove onion, add 4 
tablespoons flour and cook the flour in the fat until brown; 
then add a cup of stock, stir until thick, season. 

Croquettes of Meat, Ham or Fish 

1 cup thick white or brown J^ teaspoon salt, 
sauce. 1 teaspoon onion juice. 

2 cups minced meat or fish. 

Mix ingredients and set aside to become cold. Make 
into small round or oblong forms. Dip in crumbs, then in 



[138] MRS. DE GRAF'S COOK BOOK 

slightly beaten egg, then in crumbs. When all are made 
fry in deep fat until a golden brown. Drain on brown paper 
and serve with a tomato or other sauce. 



Chicken Croquettes 

Chop chicken very fine, season with salt, pepper, onion 
juice and lemon juice. Chopped ham, tongue, sweetbreads, 
veal or mushrooms all combine with chicken, and any 
of these foods, even a small portion, will improve the flavor 
of the croquettes. For each cup of chopped meat use 1 
cup of thick white sauce. The sauce for chicken croquettes 
may be made with either chicken stock or milk. 

Rice Croquettes 

2 cups boiled rice. 1 egg. 

1 tablespoon butter. 3^ teaspoon salt. 

To hot boiled rice add butter and well-beaten egg; spread 
on a shallow plate and when cold shape in balls, roll in 
soft crumbs, dip in egg slightly beaten, then in crumbs 
again and fry in hot fat. For sweet rice croquettes add 2 
tablespoons sugar and the grated rind and juice of a lemon. 

Potato Croquettes 

2 cups hot mashed potatoes. 1 teaspoon onion juice. 

2 tablespoons butter. 1 teaspoon finely chopped 

J^ teaspoon salt. parsley. ' 

J^ teaspoon pepper. 

Add ingredients in order given to potatoes and prepare 
as for rice croquettes. 

Clieese Croquettes 

1 cup thick white sauce. J^ cup grated cheese. 

J^ teaspoon salt. 1 cup cheese, cut in dice. 

Paprika. 2 egg yolks. 

To white sauce add beaten yolks and cheese; stir until 
cheese is melted; cool, then shape and crumb as for rice 
croquettes. 



MRS. DE GRAF'S COOK BOOK [139] 

Macaroni Croquettes 

2 cups finely chopped cooked ]/i teaspoon salt. 

macaroni. Paprika. 

1 cup thick white sauce. 

Add chopped macaroni to the thick white sauce; also 
seasoning. Set aside to cool. Shape into croquettes, dip in 
crumbs, *hen in slightly beaten egg, then crumbs. Fry in 
deep fat until a golden brown. Serve with a cheese sauce. 



Com Fritters 

1 egg beaten separately. 1 teaspoon baking powder. 

1 cup com. }^ teaspoon salt. 

}^ cup flour. Paprika. 

Beat egg yolk; add corn, flour sifted with baking powder 
and salt; then fold in stiffly beaten egg white. Fry in 
deep fat or on a well greased griddle. 



Celery Fritters 

Cut celery in lengths of about 3 inches. Parboil until 
tender, but not broken; drain, season with salt and pepper. 
Prepare fritter batter; dip celery in batter and fry in deep 
tat; use as a garnish or with a tomato sauce. This is a 
good way to use the outer stalks of celery. 

Banana Fritters 

Dip each piece of banana in the batter and fry in hot fat; 
drain on brown paper. For a dessert or sweet entree serve 
with a sweet sauce; as a garnish for meat serve plain. 
Apple or pineapple fritters are prepared in the same 
manner. 

Tripe Fried in Batter 

Tripe is usually cooked or pickled as purchased in the 
market. It requires more cooking to make it tender. Cut 
into pieces for serving and cook in equal parts of milk 
and water until tender, about half an hour. Drain, dry, 
dip in fritter batter and fry in deep fat.

Vegetable Cookery 




Jegetable cookery is very often slighted because it 
seems too simple to require much attention. Hot 
or cold water is poured over them, regardless of 
the type of vegetable. Sometimes they are cooked 
so long and in such quantities of water that the finished 
dish is anything but palatable. 

Vegetables are made up of countless little cells contain- 
ing water, sugar, starch, mineral salts, etc., and are valu- 
able to the diet as bulk food and for these mineral salts. 
The careful housewife will see that vegetables are cooked 
so as to retain most of these valuable elements. All vege- 
tables should be cooked in boiling water, as this bursts the 
starch grains at once, which will hold the nutriment of 
the vegetable. If cold or just warm water is used, the 
starchy frame of the vegetable will become soaked with 
water, and in the case of very starchy vegetables, such as 
potatoes, they will become water-soaked and soggy — an 
unappetizing and indigestible dish. The vegetables de- 
ficient in starch should be cooked in boiling hot water also, 
in order to retain the flavor, and delicate vegetables should 
not be cooked in a quantity of water or the flavor will be 
impaired and much of the mineral salts lost. Steamed 
vegetables retain nearly all the valuable qualities and is a 
very satisfactory method for cooking many vegetables. 

Foods containing starch must be well cooked. Such 
vegetables as potatoes, turnips and those containing starch 
in the form of woody fiber must be thoroughly cooked or 
they will be unwholesome. Green peas and asparagus 
contain sufficient starch to require thorough cooking, but 
in order to retain the flavor (sugar and other elements) 
there should not be a quantity of water used, and while 
the water should be at the boiling point it should not be 
allowed to boil violently; in the case of peas all water should 
either be absorbed, or whatever liquid remains should be 
served with the vegetables. 

The liquid from asparagus can form the base for a cream 
soup or can be used to make a sauce to pour over the vege- 
table. Spinach, after being carefully cleaned, should be 



MRS. D£ GRAF'S COOK feOOK [143] 

cooked in the water which clings to the leaves, or if any 
water is added it should be only sufficient to cover the 
bottom of the kettle. The length of time required to cook 
vegetables depends upon their age and how long they have 
been gathered. 

Some vegetables are strong flavored and for this type a 
quantity of water may be used. Cabbage, onions, etc., 
come under this class. These vegetables may be blanched. 
By that is meant placing the vegetables in a quantity of 
cold water and then brought quickly to the boiling point, 
boiled not more than S minutes, drained and cooked in 
boiling water as directed. 

Hard water has a tendency to toughen and harden 
woody fiber, and thus keep the sweet juices and other 
valuable compounds within the article cooked; soft water 
acts in just the opposite manner. For that reason we salt 
the water for all green vegetables, which assists them in 
retaining flavor and color. Vegetables containing much 
woody fiber are better cooked in soft water, adding salt 
when half cooked. 

If you will bear in mind that vegetables growing above 
the ground require salted water and those growing below 
the ground can be salted later in the cooking process, there 
will be no mistake. 

Some cooks advise using a small quantity of baking soda 
in the water in which woody fibered vegetables are cooked. 
This is not an advisable process, for the soda is an alkali, 
and while it will certainly soften the water it will also 
destroy certain essential elements in the vegetables and 
will give green vegetables a faded, unappetizing appear- 
ance. 

In the case of dried vegetables, where soda is often 
suggested to soften the cellular structure, soaking over 
night will be found to give much better results. 

Green vegetables will retain their color better if cooked 
in an uncovered kettle. Strong flavored vegetables, such 
as cabbage and cauliflower, will not give off^ as unpleasant 
an odor if cooked in an uncovered kettle. 

Although it is customary to boil vegetables, they may be 
either steamed or baked. To steam be careful to keep 
water constantly boiling and saucepan closely covered. 



[144] MRS, DE GRAF'S COOK BOOK 

Steam until vegetable is tender. This will take a little 
longer than boiling, but they will be of a good flavor and 
there will be scarcely any loss of mineral salts or other 
nutritive content. This method of cooking may be used for 
all vegetables firm in texture. Where possible, steam vege- 
tables without removing the skins. The flavor of the food 
will be greatly improved and the skins may be more quickly 
and easily removed after cooking. In baking there is very 
little loss of material except water, which is driven ofi^ by 
the heat. Baked potatoes, both white and sweet, are 
among the most easily digested and wholesome vege- 
tables. 

When baking raw vegetables always use a medium hot 
oven. Potatoes will not be mealy and satisfactory if placed 
in a cool oven and allowed to heat through gradually. 

The time required for cooking vegetables depends 
largely upon the age of the vegetable. They should be 
cooked until tender, but no longer. Peas overcooked are 
ruined, and cabbage, so commonly cooked until soggy and 
heavy, is certainly unappetizing and indigestible. 

For seasonings, just salt, pepper and butter or any of 
the well-made white or drawn butter sauces. The wise 
housekeeper will master the art of making simple sauces 
and will vary the kind to suit the vegetable the sauce is to 
be served with. If the vegetable is to be fried be sure the 
fat is hot and drain off all fat before serving. Fat soaked 
foods are unwholesome and indigestible. 

Cold cooked vegetables may be scalloped or served au 
gratin. Any of these methods will entirely change the 
flavor and appearance so completely that the reheated 
dish will not be classified as a left-over. 

Any cooked vegetable may be creamed by adding thin 
or medium white sauce. This sauce can be made with part 
milk and part the liquid the vegetable was cooked in. 

Any cooked vegetable may be scalloped by alternating 
layers of vegetables and a medium white sauce, covering 
the top with buttered crumbs and baking until brown. 

Vegetables may be boiled in the oven as well as on top 
of the stove. If using a hot oven for a roast the vege- 
tables may be started to cook on top of the stove, then 
removed to the oven to complete cooking. Of course. 



MRS. DE GRAF'S COOK BOOK [145] 

they must be kept at the boiling point if the best flavor is 
desired, so the oven must be hot. 

When using canned vegetables, it is better to open the 
cans an hour or more before they are needed, so that the 
contents may come in contact with a fresh supply of oxy- 
gen. Of course the food should be turned from the can at 
once. All canned vegetables, except tomatoes and com, 
should be rinsed in cold water before using. This removes 
the "canned" taste so much disliked by many. 

Artichokes 

Let the artichokes soak for about ten minutes in cold 
salted water. This draws out any tiny bugs which might 
be under the leaves. Remove the tough outside leaves 
and with a sharp knife cut about an inch off the top of each 
artichoke. Drop into cold water, adding a tablespoon of 
vinegar or lemon juice and let stand half hour or more. 
This prevents discoloration. Drain and cook in salted 
boiling water until tender. 

Boiled Asparagus 

Scrape the stalks, wash well and tie in small bunches; 
cut off the tough ends. Set the bunches in boiling salted 
water with the tips upright and above the water. Cook 
until tender. Drain, arrange on buttered toast, season 
with butter and serve. Steaming is a very good method to 
use for cooking asparagus. 

Asparagus in Milk 

Scrape the stalks, cut off the tough ends and cut in inch 
lengths. Put in a double boiler, add hot milk to cover and 
cook until tender. Season with salt and butter and serve; 
or for each cup of milk allow one tablespoon of butter and 
one of flour; mix until well blended, then add to hot mix- 
ture and stir until creamy. Pour over toast points. 

Asparagus Shortcake 

Split and butter hot baking powder biscuits. Have 
prepared creamed asparagus and put the biscuits together 
with this mixture, pouring some of the creamed asparagus 
around the little shortcakes. 



[146] MRS. DE GRAF'S COOK BOOK 

Succotash 

Take equal quantities of cooked corn and cooked string 
beans or cooked lima beans. Season with a teaspoon of 
onion juice, butter and salt. 

Com Custard 

1 cup canned com. 1 tablespoon melted butter. 

J^ cup milk. J^ teaspoon salt. 

1 egg, beaten. Paprika. 

Mix ingredients in order named and pour into a greased 
baking dish. Bake in a slow oven until firm. If cooked 
too quickly the mixture will separate or curdle. 

Green Peas 

To shelled peas add about the same quantity of boiling 
water, allowing y^ teaspoon of salt and ^ teaspoon of 
sugar to each cup of water. Simmer gently until tender, 
then add a teaspoon of butter just before serving. 

Glac€ Carrots 

Boil or steam small carrots without peeling. Drain, 
plunge in cold water and remove skins. Place in a buttered 
baking dish, sprinkle with sugar, dot with butter and add 
about yi cup of water. Bake about half an hour, basting 
several times. 

Buttered Beets 

Wash beets and cook in boiling water until tender. 
Drain, plunge in cold water and remove the skins. Cut in 
cubes. Reheat in a double boiler, adding salt and a table- 
spoon of butter. 

Scalloped Onions 

Peel and slice onions about half an inch in thickness. 
Put a layer of onions in a buttered baking dish or casserole; 
season with salt, dot with butter and dredge with flour. 
Continue in layers until all the onions are used. Cover 
with hot milk or boiling water; cover and bake in a modei^ 
ate oven until tender; about one hour. Or reheat cooked 
onions. 



MRS. DE GRAF'S COOK BOOK [147] 

Onions with Peanut Butter Sauce 

Peel onions and cook in boiling water until tender. 
Make a white sauce using the proportion of 1 tablespoon of 
butter, 1 tablespoon of flour and ^ teaspoon of salt to 
each cup of milk or cream. Add 4 tablespoons of peanut 
butter to each cup of sauce and stir until well blended. 
Pour over the onions that have been drained, and serve. 

Celery au Gratin 

Two cups of celery cut in small pieces. Put in saucepan 
and add 2 cups of boiling salted water. Cook until 
tender. Drain, reserving liquid to make a sauce. For the 
sauce use yi cup of celery liquid and ^ cup of milk. Melt 
2 tablespoons shortening, add 2 tablespoons of flour, cook 
until frothy, add liquid and cook, stirring constantly, until 
creamy. Season with salt and pepper. Grease a baking 
dish and add alternate layers of celery, sauce and grated 
cheese. Cover the top with buttered crumbs and bake 
until brown. 

Fried Eggplant 

Pare eggplant and cut in ^-inch slices. Season with 
pepper and salt, then dip in slightly beaten egg, diluted 
with 1 tablespoon of cold water. After covering each slice 
with egg, roll in soft bread crumbs and fry in deep fat or 
pan fry in a small quantity of fat cooking in either case 
until a golden brown. 

Quick Cabbage 

Chop cabbage very fine. Plunge into boiling salted 
water and boil rapidly for IS minutes. Drain, season with 
salt, pepper and a little butter. 

Diced Turnips 

Peel turnips and cut in cubes; cook in boiling water 
until tender but not broken; drain. Allow 1 cup of medium 
white sauce for 2 cups of turnip, season with salt, pepper 
and 1 teaspoon of lemon juice. 



[148] MRS. DE GRAF'S COOK BOOK 

Parsnip Cakes 

Take cold mashed parsnips that have been well 
seasoned shape into small, flat, round cakes; roll in flour 
and cook in butter or butter substitute, browning on each 
side. 

Steamed Squash 

Cut squash in pieces to fit the steamer or colander in 
which it is to be steamed. Place over boiling water, 
cover closely and steam until tender, about one hour. 
Scrape the pulp from the shell and mash, seasoning with 
butter, pepper and salt and a very small amount of sugar. 

Baked Cream Squash 

Cut small, cream squash in half; remove seeds and fiber; 
sprinkle with salt and dot with small bits of butter or 
substitute. Bake in a moderate oven about f^ of an hour. 

Creamed Cabbage 

4 cups shredded cabbage. 2 cups medium white sauce. 

Add shredded cabbage to rapidly boiling, salted water. 
Cook until tender; drain, then add to the well-seasoned 
white sauce. 

Spinach 

Remove roots from spinach. Wash very well in several 
waters, then pour hot water over the leaves. This causes 
any remaining grit to go to the bottom of the pan. Place 
spinach in a kettle with a teaspoon of salt and cook until 
tender in its own juice, having the fire low and lifting occa- 
sionally to prevent burning. Drain, chop fine and add 
seasonings of salt, pepper and butter. Reheat and garnish 
with slices of hard cooked egg. Cooked in this manner, 
all of the valuable salts are retained. If the spinach is 
old and rather tough it may be necessary to use about a 
cupful of boiling water. 

Creamed Spinach 

For 2 cups of cooked, chopped spinach allow 1 cup of 
well-seasoned medium white sauce and add a dash of 
nutmeg. 



MRS. DE GRAF'S COOK BOOK [149] 

Brussels Sprouts 

Wash well and remove outer leaves of sprouts; cook in 
boiling, salted water until tender, about 20 minutes. Drain 
well, add 2 tablespoons butter to a heavy frying pan. Add 
the sprouts and cook over a slow fire until butter is all 
absorbed. Season with salt and pepper. Serve on a platter 
rounded with toast points or fried bread. 



Dainty Cabbage 

This is a somewhat novel way to cook this humble 
vegetable, but it will be found very palatable and as it is a 
hearty dish can be served when the meat course is not so 
plentiful. 

Select a firm white head of cabbage and cook in boiling 
salted water until tender. Drain. Chop and season with 
salt and pepper. Add 2 level tablespoons of butter, yi 
cup of milk and 2 beaten eggs, and 1 teaspoon of vinegar. 
Mix all the ingredients, pour into a greased baking dish, 
and bake in a hot oven until the top is a golden brown. 

Hot Slaw 

1 tablespoon sugar. 3 tablespoons vinegar, pepper. 

1 egg. 3 cups shredded uncooked 

1 tablespoon flour. cabbage. 

Yi cup milk. Yi teaspoon mustard. 

1 teaspoon salt. 

Mix ingredients and add to beaten egg and milk and cook 
in double boiler until thick. Add vinegar and cabbage 
and serve very hot. 

StufEed Green Peppers 

Cut tops and remove centers of sweet green peppers; 
cover with boiling water and let stand about 10 minutes. 
Make a stuffing of cooked rice seasoned well with butter, 
salt, finely chopped onion, moistening well with strained 
tomato. Fill peppers with mixture, cover with buttered 
crumbs and bake in a moderate oven about ^ of an hour. 



[ISO] MRS. DE GRAF'S COOK BOOK 

Creamed Spinach 

Two cups of chopped cooked spinach, 1 cup of medium 
white sauce, salt, pepper, few grains nutmeg. Combine 
ingredients and reheat. 

Green Peas Maitre d'Hotel 

2 cups green peas. 3^ teaspoon lemon juice. 

1 mint leaf. Salt and pepper. 

2 tablespoons butter or 
substitute. 

Cook peas in a small quantity of boiling salted water, 
until tender, leaving kettle uncovered. Mix butter, 
chopped mint, salt, pepper and lemon juice. Drain peas, 
add butter mixture, return to fire and melt and serve. 

Pink Beans Spanish 

2 cup beans. 1 pimento or green pepper, 

1 onion. chopped. 

2 cups strained tomato or to- 1 tablespoon butter or sub- 
mato sauce. stitute. 

1 teaspoon salt. 

Wash, then soak beans over night; drain, cover with boil- 
ing water and cook }i hour. Drain again, cover again with 
fresh boiling water and cook until tender. Melt butter, 
add onion and pimento and cook for about 5 minutes, 
then add tomato. Drain beans, add the sauce and 
simmer about half an hour. 

Stuffed Tomatoes 

Cut a thin slice from the smooth end of tomatoes. 
Scoop out the pulp and mix it with an equal quantity of 
cold cooked rice, macaroni or bread crumbs. Add season- 
ing of salt, pepper and a few drops of onion juice. Refill 
tomato shells, replace covers and bake }4 hour. A table- 
spoon or more of finely chopped ham adds variety to this 
dish. 

Boiled Cabbage 

Allow cabbage to soak in cold water for at least half an 
hour before cooking. Place in rapidly boiling water to 
which 2 teaspoonfuls of salt have been added. Boil in an 



MRS. DE GRAF'S COOK BOOK [151] 

uncovered saucepan about 25 minutes. The cabbage 
should be white and thoroughly cooked in that time. 
Longer cooking will cause it to be tough and indigestible. 
Drain and serve plain or with White, Hollandaise or 
Drawn Butter sauce. 

Celery in White Sauce 

Wash, scrape and cut celery stalks in 1-inch pieces; cook 
20 minutes or until soft in boiling salted water; drain, and 
to 2 cups of celery add 1 cup of white sauce. This is a 
most satisfactory way of using the outer stalks of celery. 

Creamed Carrots 

Cut carrots, after scraping into slices; let boil in boiling 
water until tender; drain, and add to 1 cupful of well- 
seasoned white sauce. 

Canned Vegetables 

Open and remove from can at once. Drain off all liquid 
with the exception of corn and tomatoes and let stand an 
hour or more in fresh cold water. As the vegetables have 
already been cooked they only require reheating and 
seasoning. A double boiler will be found the most satis- 
factory method for reheating. It requires about IS min- 
utes to heat thoroughly. A bit of butter and salt are 
added when the vegetables are put in the boiler. Heated 
in this manner the vegetables will not require water and 
there will be no danger of burning, as is easily the case with 
corn. Milk or cream may be added if desired. 

Stuffed Vegetables 

Onions, green peppers, tomatoes and eggplant are cooked 
in this manner: Scald the vegetables a few minutes, then 
place in cold water and remove the peel of the tomatoes 
or onions, and rub off the skins of green peppers and egg 
plants with a cloth. The centers are removed and the 
cavities filled with a stuffing made of seasoned bread 
crumbs mixed with a little melted butter, or the portion 
removed may be chopped fine and added to the crumbs. 
Place a small piece of butter on top of each and bake in a 
hot oven. Serve plain or with a sauce. 



[152] MRS. DE GRAF'S COOK BOOK 

Vegetables au Gratin 

Left-over vegetables are usually used, and almost any 
variety may be prepared in this manner: Cut vegetables 
into cubes or slices. Make a white sauce; butter a baking 
dish and arrange a layer of vegetables in it, season, then 
add a layer of white sauce. Repeat until dish is filled. 
Cover the top with a layer of soft crumbs moistened with 
melted butter. Bake in a moderate oven. Cheese may be 
added to the white sauce. 

Scalloped Vegetables

until dish is filled, having a layer of crumbs on top. Bake 
in a moderate oven until nicely browned. 

Boiled Potatoes for Mashing 

Wash potatoes with a small brush and peel as thin as 
possible, for much of the mineral salts lie next to the skin. 
Place in rapidly boiling water and cook until they may be 
pierced with a fork. Drain and shake them in the saucepan 
for a few moments to make them mealy. Mash well, being 
sure there are no lumps, and add butter and salt in pro- 
portion to the number of potatoes. Beat well, adding 
gradually enough scalded milk to make them creamy, and 
continue to beat until white and light. A potato ricer can 
be used instead of mashing them, then seasonings and 
milk can be added, and the potatoes beaten until light. 

Baked Potatoes 

Potatoes should be of uniform size. Wash well and place 
in a hot oven for 45 minutes, when they should be mellow 
when pressed between the fingers. If skins are desired soft, 
rub each potato with butter or substitute before baking. 
When baked remove at once from the oven; press between 
the hands until the skins breaks, or prick with a fork to 
release the steam; this will prevent the potato from 
becoming soggy.

Savory Sauces 



To make a really good sauce is considered an art in itself 
and one which has not always been given the careful consid- 
eration it deserves. Many common-place and otherwise 
hopeless dishes may be transformed and made most ap- 
petizing when served with a well-made sauce. If given care 
a smooth creamy, well-cooked sauce is not difficult to pre- 
pare, and may be plain or quite elaborate, as desired. 
However, it must be free from all lumps and thoroughly 
cooked and the seasoning used should be suitable for the 
food the sauce is to be served with. 

Sauces made with milk are economical, for they supply 
nutriment and increase the value of the food with which 
they are served. In using left-overs of fish, meat and vege- 
tables it is almost necessary to use a well-seasoned sauce. 

A plain white sauce is perhaps the most useful adjunct 
to good cooking and the foundation recipe may be varied in 
many appetizing ways by the addition of other ingredients. 
This white sauce is made of a different thickness, according 
to how it is to be used. For creamed soups it is quite 
thin, for croquettes very thick, and for the usual creamed 
dishes of a medium thickness. The medium sauce is made 
by using 2 tablespoons (level) of butter or butter substitute, 
2 tablesi)oons of flour to each half-pint measuring cup of 
cold liquid, which ma}^ be water, milk, thin cream or white 
orbrown stock, depending upon what kind of sauce youwish. 
With these measurements in mind you can prepare any 
quantity of sauce desired. 

There are several approved methods of preparation, but 
the one given will be found very easy and most satis- 
factory if the directions are carefully followed. Put the 
butter or butter substitute in a saucepan over a low fire 
and melt, but do not brown; when fat is melted remove 
from the fire and add flour, stirring until smooth and well 
blended; return to the fire and cook the mixture until it 
bubbles or beconies frothy, then add the cold milk gradu- 
ally, stirring until boiling point is reached and sauce thick- 
ens. Add seasoning. 

If it is necessary to keep this sauce hot for any length 



[ 160] MRS. DE GRAF'S COOK BOOK 

of time, set in a dish of hot water, add a few small pieces of 
butter and cover. This will prevent a crust from forming 
on top. Do not boil after the sauce becomes creamy and 
thick or it may separate and become oily. If this should 
happen, add 1 tablespoon of cold liquid for each cup of 
sauce, place over the fire and stir constantly until the 
boiling point is reached again. 

The secret of good white sauce is in cooking the flour 
until the starch grains burst; this removes the raw, 
pasty, unpleasant taste one so often finds in undercooked 
sauces. If the liquid is added gradually and stirred con- 
stantly there will be no diificulty in keeping the sauce 
smooth. 

A brown sauce is made in the same manner, allowing the 
fat to brown before adding the flour, then cooking these 
two ingredients together until brown, using a dark stock 
or water for the liquid. The best results are obtained if 
all the seasonings are added before the sauce is completely 
cooked. 

The more delicate sauces are thickened with the yolks 
of eggs and a quantity of butter. These sauces require 
considerable skill in preparation. 

For every-day cooking the plain sauce may easily be 
varied to form almost any sauce desired. 

Catsup, Chili sauce, Worcestershire sauce. Kitchen 
Bouquet, whole cloves, grated onion, etc., all give a variety 
of flavorings. 

Stock of some type can be used in place of milk. The 
thickness of the sauce is governed by taste. One table- 
spoonful of flour and shortening to each cupful of liquid 
gives a thin sauce. Two tablespoonfuls of each give a 
medium sauce. 



Foundation Medium White Sauce 

2 tablespoons butter or 1 cup cold milk, 

substitute. }^ teaspoon salt. 

2 tablespoons flour. Wbite pepper to taste. 

Melt shortening, add flour, mix until smooth; cook until 



MRS. DE GRAF'S COOK BOOK [161] 

frothy, then add cold milk and cook until creamy, add 
seasonings. 

This sauce is used for all plain creamed dishes such as 
vegetables, fish, meat and toast. 

Cream Sauce 

Follow white sauce recipe, using thin cream or half 
cream and half milk. 
To be used when a richer sauce is desired.

sauce when you add the cold milk. Remove the bay leaf 
before serving. Do not boil after eggs have been added or 
the mixture will curdle. This sauce is suitable for vege- 
tables. 

Poulette Sauce 

Follow white sauce recipe, using yi. cup of cream and

Salads and Salad Dressings 

While the food value of a green salad is not high, the salts 
they contain are valuable and the oil used in the various 
dressings supply the nutriment, making them a wholesome 
food. In almost any climate some green salad vegetable 
may be obtained all the year round, and with cooked or 
canned vegetables an acceptable salad can always be made. 
There are certain things essential for a good salad. First, 
it should be cold; if a green salad, it must be crisp; the 
dressing ingredients must be carefully proportioned and 
blended so the salad will be neither oily nor acid, and the 
whole well mixed. In using French dressing there should be 
just sufficient to cover the vegetables when mixed, and none 
left in the bottom of the bowl after mixing. 

If the greens are prepared several hours before wanted 
they may be placed (after dr5ang) in a tightly covered pail 
and set in a cool place until needed, when they will be very 
crisp, fresh and cool. Never cut up lettuce, but break the 
leaves, if necessary, to the desired size. Dressing should 
never be added to a green salad until time for serving, 
otherwise the salad greens will become wilted and lose the 
desired crispness. Always remove the skin from tomatoes. 
A tomato salad is quickly prepared, served skin and all, 
but the skin is indigestible. 

An easy way to remove the skins is to put the tomatoes in 
a basket or colander and plunge them into boiling (not 
just hot) water and let them remain 1 minute only; then 
plunge into cold water. The skins may then be easily 
removed. Set aside to chill before slicing. When stuffing 
raw tomatoes for salad, remove the skin, cut a slice off the 
stem and scoop out the centers, sprinkle with salt and 
invert to drain and chill. Just before serving fill centers 
with the prepared filling and set on lettuce leaves. 

Another method but not so quickly accomplished, is to 
rub each tomato over the surface with the blunt edge of a 
knife, then peel. 

Cooked vegetables for salads should be thoroughly 
drained and quite cold before using. Turn artichokes up- 
side down so that all the moisture will be drained off. 



MRS. DE GRAF'S COOK BOOK [169] 

Cabbage should be shredded very fine with a sharp, 
long knife rather than chopped. After shredding let the 
cabbage stand in cold water to become crisp and drain well 
before using. 

Peel cucumbers and cut oflF a thick slice from each end; 
soak in cold water until ready to serve, then cut in thin 
slices. Never soak cucumbers in salted water, for then they 
become tough and wilted, besides increasing their indigesti- 
bility. Green peppers should be scalded for about S min- 
utes, when the outside skin may be rubbed ofF. Cover with 
cold water until ready to use. Parsley should be kept in a 
glass of cold water, wetting only the roots. In this way it 
will keep fresh several days. 

If using canned vegetables, such as peas, lima beans, 
asparagus or string beans, open the can at least half an 
hour before wanted and drain off all the liquid. Cover with 
cold water until ready to use. Treated in this way they 
will taste more like the fresh vegetable. 

When making a salad of cooked vegetables it will be 
found an improvement to mix with a French dressing and 
allow to stand or marinate in a cool place about an hour 
before serving. With a green salad the dressing should 
never be added until time to serve, as the dressing causes 
green vegetables to become wilted. 

Meat and poultry should be freed from skin and gristle 
and cut in small cubes. Fish should have all the bones 
and skin removed and pulled apart or flaked with a fork. 
All left-over vegetables, fish or meat can be utilized in 
salads, and almost all combinations of cooked or green 
vegetables make a palatable one. 

A combination of fruits makes a pleasant change from 
the plain fruit itself and offers a good way to add the differ- 
ent helpful salts and acids into the system. Containing 
iron, tartrates, gum, pectin and fruit sugars and other 
saline qualities, a mixture of fruits is a very desirable 
dish. Use only good, firm fruit for salads and either fresh 
or cooked fruit will give equally good results. The flavor 
of a fruit salad is improved by using lemon juice instead 
of vinegar in the dressing. Almost any combination of 
fruits will be acceptable for a salad. 



[170] MRS. DE GRAF'S COOK BOOK 

The requirements for a good salad consists in having all 
ingredients cold, the greens crisp and dry. For French 
dressing select a good oil — olive od has the best flavor. Do 
not use too much dressing; there should be just enough 
to cover each bit of the ingredients, no more. Meat, fish 
and cooked vegetable salads may stand an hour in French 
dressing before serving. This is called a marinade and will 
improve the flavor of the salad. When ready to serve pour 
over any desired dressing regardless of the marinade. 
Much of the flavor of all salad dressings depends upon a 
good quality of both vinegar and oil. 

The following rules govern generally in regard to the 
serving of salads. 

1. Vegetable or fruit salads, with a simple dressing 
may be served with a meat course. 

2. More elaborate fruit and vegetable combinations 
should accompany light meats as chicken, fish, tongue, etc. 

3. Meat or fish salads with mayonnaise or boiled dress- 
ing may be used in place of the meat course. 

4. Never repeat in a salad a vegetable used in a previ- 
ous course. 

5. Hard cooked eggs combine well with fowl, fish and 
vegetables. 

6. Cream cheese combines with vegetables and nuts 
and with some fruits, pineapple preferred. 

7. Eggs, cheese and nuts should not be used in salads 
to accompany a meat course. 

8. Starchy salads should not be served when the menu 
contains much starchy food.

Different Salad Dressing for Each Day in 
the Week 

A French or Mayonnaise dressing is more often used 
plain, but by adding various flavorings, can be greatly 
changed, giving variety at a time of the year when salad 
greens are limited. Take lettuce which we always have in 
California. This popular green salad vegetable could be 
served many days in succession but with a different dress- 
ing for each day. In this manner variety is introduced 
and the family will not tire of lettuce, as would often be 
the case were the same dressing used each meal. There is 
a strong appetite appeal in variety and when the person 
who plans the meals realizes this she will have learned one 
of the most valuable lessons in menu building. 

Salad dressings have as their base, acid, oil and season- 
ings. Your base recipe may be one of the three foundation 
formulae — French, Mayonnaise or Cooked dressing. French 
dressing or variations of it is the most suitable for green 
salads and for a salad served with a heavy meal. It is less 
hearty than either the Mayonnaise or Cooked dressing, 
and will be relished more than the richer dressings. Cooked 
dressing is preferred by those who do not care for the flavor 
of oil. This dressing admits of as many variations as a 
Mayonnaise dressing. It is a very convenient salad dress- 
ing for it can be prepared in a quantity and kept for some 
time. Mayonnaise is considered by many somewhat difii- 
cult to prepare. Lack of success might be traced to two 
things — chaste in adding the oil, and not having the ingredi- 
ents used all of about the same temperature. 

If the oil is cold and the egg and acid warm, it is difiicult 
to make the egg absorb the oil; or it might be the egg was 
cold and the oil warm. It is far easier to have all ingredi- 
ents cold. If that is not possible, have them all about 
the same temperature. One egg yolk will only absorb one 
cupful of oil and remain thick and firm. If more than that 
quantity is used, the dressing may separate; if not at once, 
it will do so after standing some time. 

The seasonings and a teaspoon of acid should be added 



[172] MRS. DE GRAF'S COOK BOOK 

to the egg yolk and the whole beaten or well mixed before 
any oil is added. Add about a teaspoonful of oil, then 
beat well, using a small spoon or a very small egg beater. 
Always use a small bowl for making mayonnaise, so there 
will not be much surface at the bottom of the bowl. This 
enables you to mix the ingredients well. Add oil, a tea- 
spoonful at a time, until the mixture begins to thicken. As 
soon as this dressing has once become thick, the oil may be 
added in larger quantity, if it is beaten well or until ab- 
sorbed, between each addition of oil. An egg beater can 
be used and the dressing made very quickly after it has 
once thickened. If more acid is desired, it can be added 
during the mixing or at the last. Adding the acid to the 
egg yolk before the oil is used, lessens the liability of the 
mixture to curdle. The egg beater also aids in keeping the 
dressing from curdling, as the larger surface over which the 
oil is spread the less likelihood of separation. One point, 
most important: be sure all the oil added at any one time 
is entirely absorbed before adding more. If, after all these 
precautions, the dressing should curdle, put it aside, and 
begin the process all over again with another egg yolk. 
As soon as this begins to thicken, the curdled mixture may 
be added gradually, just as you would add oil. This 
should remedy the trouble and prevent waste. A double 
quantity of oil can be used. When well made a mayon- 
naise is smooth, thick and glossy in appearance. Dressing 
made with these proportions — 1 cupful of oil to each yolk 
of egg — ^will keep some time without separating, if kept in 
a cool place. 

Oil is the main ingredient in a French dressing, and if 
the salad is to be perfect, to have the right flavor, a good 
olive oil is required. Other vegetable oils may be used for 
mayonnaise with very good results, but French dressing 
will lack flavor if made of an inferior oil. Much depends 
on the vinegar, which sould be pure and not too sharp. 
To prepare a French dressing, put all the ingredients into 
a small glass fruit jar, adjust the cover and shake vigor- 
ously until well blended and thick. A perfect emulsion 
will result, which will remain thick for half an hour or more. 

Cooked dressing somewhat resembles mayonnaise and 
usually has butter added to supply the necessary fat. 



MRS. DE GRAF'S COOK BOOK [173] 

Cooked dressing is usually servfed to persons who do not 
enjoy the flavor of oil. However, oil may be used, as the 
flavor is scarcely perceptible after it has been heated. 

Mayonnaise Dressing 

1 cup oil. J^ teaspoon salt. 

3 teaspoons vinegar (about). yi, teaspoon of mustard. 

1 raw egg yolk. Dash of pepper or paprika. 

It is essential that everything for a mayonnaise be of 
the same temperature; not one ingredient very cold and 
the other very warm. Put the egg yolk in a small bowl and 
beat until creamy, then add the mustard, salt, pepper and 
mix until smooth; add 1 teaspoon of vinegar, then add a 
few drops of oil, using a small egg beater; add oil gradu- 
ally, beating until thick between each addition of oil. 
This can be accomplished very quickly with the egg beater. 
Add remaining vinegar when all the oil has been used. By 
adding a small quantity of acid to the egg before using 
any oil prevents a possibility of the dressing separating. If 
the dressing is not to be used at once addl tablespoonful of 
hot water and mix well. This is also a preventive of 
separation. This dressing is a base for many appetizing 
combinations.

Yeast Mixtures 

Helpful Hints on Bread Making 

READ is the most important article of food in the 

daily diet. And the many processes employed in 

making and baking gives us a great variety of 

appetizing breads, that furnish the largest amount 

of food value for the least money expended. 

The process of making these yeast mixtures is most 
interesting, and a little careful study and practice will 
surely reward you for your time and trouble. 

The first essential for perfect bread is a good flour; 
second, careful manipulation and third, proper baking. 

The longer the batter is beaten, the less kneading the 
dough will require. When dough can be lifted in a mass 
on a spoon, it is ready to knead. 

Dough is kneaded to mix the ingredients thoroughly, 
to make the gluten elastic and to work in the air. It is 
sufficiently kneaded when it can be left on the board for 
a minute or more without sticking. 

In cool weather the bowl containing the dough may 
be set in a pan of warm water. To keep the dough from 
cooling, mix and knead it quickly. 

Quick handling prevents the dough from cooling and 
hastens the process of rising. 

Always make small loaves to insure bread being baked 
through; in large loaves the heat may fail to penetrate 
to the center of the loaf. 

If bread rises much after being put in the oven, the 
heat is not great enough, but if it begins to brown in 
less than fifteen minutes, the heat is too great. During 
the first ten minutes the loaves are in the oven they 
should merely rise and perhaps begin to show a little 
brown in spots; in the second period of ten minutes they 
should become a delicate brown all over the surface and 
cease to rise; in the third period they should finish 
browning, and in the fourth they should shrink slightly 
from the pans. After the first ten minutes the oven heat 
can be decreased slightly, and as baking continues it 
may be lessened still more. 



MRS. DE GRAF'S COOK BOOK [187] 

When baking is completed, the loaves will give forth a 
hollow sound when tapped, and will shrink from the pan. 

After baking remove bread at once from the pans and 
allow to cool m fresh air, uncovered. Do not put away 
until perfectly cold. 

For all rolls, plain or fancy, use the bread formula. 
If a richer dough is desired, changes may be made in the 
following manner: 

Use milk instead of water for liquid; both shortening 
and sugar may be increased by one tablespoon or more 
to each cup of liquid. Also the white of one egg may be 
added. With these changes it may be found necessary 
to use a little more flour. 

Dark breads are valuable for their mineral salts and 
coarse texture. They should be included in the diet 
particularly that of children and elderly persons. They 
are valued mainly for their laxative qualities. 

BREAD AND ROLLS 

Note. — All measurements are level and flour Is sifted once before 
measuring. One-haU pint measuring cup is used. 

Bread 

1 cup water or milk, scalded. J^ compressed veast cake dis- 
1 tablespoon melted shortening. solved in M cup lukewarm 

1 tablespoon sugar. water. 

1 teaspoon salt. Between 3 and 4 cups flour. 

Method of Preparation: Put shortening, sugar and 
salt in scalded liquid; let it stand until lukewarm, then 
add dissolved yeast and flour gradually, beating well 
until too stiff" to stir. Turn on moulding board and knead 
in remaining flour until mixture is smooth, does not 
stick to the hands or board, and bubbles may be seen 
under the surface. Return to well-greased bowl, brush 
dough over with melted shortening, cover and allow to 
rise in a warm place to twice its original size, then knead 
down in a bowl and let rise again. This second kneading, 
after the dough has risen once, gives a much finer grain 
to bread and should always be used. When dough has 
again risen to double its size, it will be ready to shape 
into loaves or rolls. Place loaves in well-greased pans. 



[188] MRS. DE GRAF'S COOK BOOK 

having them about half full. Brush both bread and rolls 
with melted shortening, let them rise again to double 
their size and bake in a hot oven about forty-five min- 
utes for medium-sized loaves and from twenty to thirty 
minutes for rolls, according to size. 

This quantity of dough is for one large loaf of bread 
or pan of rolls. With one-half yeast cake used to each 
half-pint measuring cup of liquid, bread can be made 
and completed, if kept in a warm room, in about S hours. 
If a longer period be given to the rising process less 
yeast will be required. One-quarter yeast cake to each cup 
of liquid will be sufficient if dough is set over night. In 
either case the same method of preparation is used. 

If milk is used, scalding, while not essential, is an 
absolute test of its freshness. If scalded, cool to luke- 
warm, otherwise it will kill the yeast plant. 

For Prune or Raisin Bread 

Follow bread foundation recipe, adding 1 more table- 
spoon of sugar. When dough has risen once, add 1 cup 
of seedless raisins or pitted chopped prunes for each cup 
of liquid used and allow to double in size again, when 
the dough will be ready for loaves. Put in well-greased 
pans, let double in size, and bake in a hot oven 45 min- 
utes for a medium sized loaf. 

Another method of adding fruit: When shaping into 
loaves roll out dough for each loaf, cover with fruit and 
roll up like jelly roll. Place in greased pans and proceed 
as directed. After fruit has been added, the dough will 
take longer to rise than plain bread dough. 

Parker House Rolls 

Use bread foundation recipe. After dough has risen 
to double in size the second time, roll into a sheet about 
1 inch thick. Cut with biscuit cutter, then with the 
handle of a knife dipped in flour press lightly through 
the center of each roll, brush with melted shortening, 
fold over and place close together in a well-greased pan. 
Set in a warm place until light, then bake in a hot oven.

1 cup scalded milk. J^ cup melted butter. 

1 compressed yeast cake, dls- j2 cup sugar. 

solved In Ji cup lukewarm 1 egg, well beaten. 

water. 1 teaspoon almond flavoring. 

1}^ cups flour. J^ teaspoon salt. 

3 (about) cups flour. 

Method of Preparation: Cool milk to lukewarm, 
then add dissolved yeast cake' and \}i cups flour. Beat 
until smooth and put in warm place until light. This 
will take about one hour. Sponge is light when full of 
bubbles. Then add other ingredients, turn on board and 
knead until smooth and elastic and does not stick to 
hands or board. Place in well-greased bowl, brushing 
over top of dough with melted shortening. Allow to rise 
to 2}4 times its original size. This will take 2 hours or 
-more. Then the dough is ready for the various coffee 
cakes. 

If a richer dough is desired, double the quantity of 
shortening and eggs, using only }4 cup of milk. 

Plain Coffee Cake 

Use coffee cake foundation recipe. When light, roll 
out to about 2 inches thick, place in well-greased shallow 
pan, and brush over top with yolk of egg diluted with 2 
tablespoons of milk and then sprinkle top with following 
mixture: 

}/2 cup of soft bread crumbs. 2 tablespoons sugar. 

Cinnamon. 2 tablespoons melted butter. 

Let coffee cake stand until light and bake in a mod- 
erate oven. 

Tea Ring

shortening, sprinkle with sugar, cinnamon and seedless 
raisins, or raisins and chopped walnuts. Roll up like a 
jelly roll, join the ends, forming a ring, place on well- 
greased pan, and with scissors cut ^ through the ring 
of dough in pieces about 2 inches apart. After cutting, 
turn each piece over, brush over with yolk of egg diluted 
with two tablespoons of milk. Let rise again and bake 
in a medium oven about 25 minutes. When baked, 
brush over top with unbeaten white of egg. This gives a 
high gloss. Have oven at moderate heat. 

Wreath Cake 

Use coffee cake foundation recipe. When dough is 
light roll to yi inch thickness and spread with the follow- 
ing mixture: 

1 cup chopped seeded raisins. 1 sodacrackei rolled into 

1 lemon (juice and grated crumbs, 

rind). 1 beaten egg. 

Roll up dough as for a jelly roll and join the ends 
firmly together. Place in a well-greased pan with a 
center tube, brush over the top^with the yolk of an egg 
diluted with an equal quan|^3Fvof milk. Let rise until 
double in size and bake in a* moderate oven about 30 
minutes. Glaze with 1 egg yolk' beaten with 2 tablespoons 
milk. 

Cinnamon Rolls 

Use coffee cake foundation recipe. When light, roll 
dough into a sheet yi inch thick. Brush over with melted 
butter, sprinkle with sugar and cinnamon, and, if de- 
sired, seedless raisins. Roll up as for a jelly roll, and with 
a sharp knife cut in slices about \}4, inch thick. Place 
these slices upright in a well-greased pan and stand in 
a warm place to rise. Allow to become very light before 
baking. These can be varied by sprinkling brown sugar 
in the pan after greasing and placing thfe slices on sugar. 
When baked, turn upside down, the brown sugar form- 
ing a candied top. Care should be taken not to use too 
hot an oven for these rolls. 

They can also be baked in muffin pans and treated in 
the same way. 



[194] MRS. DE GRAF'S COOK BOOK 

Plain Sweet Rolls 

Use cofFee cake foundation recipe. When light, form 
into any desired shape, brush over with yolk af egg 
diluted with 2 tablespoons of milk. Allow to become 
light and bake. If perfect rolls are desired, do not put 
close together in pan. As soon as baked, brush over with 
egg yolk beaten with 2 tablespoons of milk to glaze. This 
should be done as soon as rolls are removed from the oven 
so the mixture will dry at once from heat of rolls. 

Rusks 

Use cofFee cake foundation recipe. When light cut off 
pieces of dough the size of a walnut and place on a greased 
cookie pan about 3 inches apart. Brush over with the 
yolk of an egg to which two tablespoons of milk have been 
added. When light, bake in a medium hot oven, and, 
when baked, glaze with confectioners' icing, which is 
made by taking 1 tablespoon of hot water and adding 
enough powdered sugar to thicken; add a few drops of 
vanilla. 

Brioche 

Use coffee cake foundation recipe. When very light 
roll in a thin sheet, spread very lightly with softened 
butter, and fold over in three layers, pressing lightly with 
the rolling pin. Cut in strips about 1 inch wide and 4 
inches long. Take these strips, one end in each hand, 
and twist in opposite directions. Then bring the ends 
together in a circle, press together, and place in a well- 
greased pan about 3 inches apart. Brush over with the 
yolk of egg and milk. Let rise and bake a delicate brown. 
When baked, brush with confectioners' sugar icing. 

Hot Cross Buns 

Use coffee cake foundation recipe, adding yi. cup of 
raisins. When light, form into balls, set on a greased pan 
some distance apart, smooth side up; brush with melted 
shortening and let rise. Before putting in a hot oven, cut 
a cross on top of each bun. When baked, brush rolls over 
with yolk^of egg diluted with 2 tablespoons of milk. 



MRS. DE GRAF'S COOK BOOK [195] 

Raised Doughnuts 

Use coffee cake foundation recipe. When light, roll to 
yi inch thickness, cut with doughnut cutter, let stand 
until light and fry in deep fat. Drain, cool and sprinkle 
with powdered sugar. 



[196] MRS. DE GRAF'S COOK BOOK 



Toast 

Cut bread in X inch slices. Place over hot coals, on a 
heated electric toaster or in a heated boiler. Do not 
place too near the heat. Toast until a golden brown on 
each side. If desired very crisp do not butter before 
serving. If liked somewhat soft, butter and set in the 
oven a few minutes. 

Milk Toast 

Milk toast seems a simple dish, and is if the bread is 
treated to just the right amount of crispness. Cut the 
bread about }4 inch thick; it should be toasted on each 
side until crisp, but not brittle. Each slice should be 
dipped, for only an instant, in hot salted water. This 
must be done quickly for the toast should not be soggy. 

Place slices on a hot platter and pour a thin white sauce 
over them. The sauce should be prepared before the 
toast is made and may be kept hot in a double boiler. 
Allow one cup of sauce to four slices of toast. Egg toast 
is made by adding one chopped, hard cooked egg to each 
cup of white sauce. Hot milk may be poured over crisp 
slices of buttered toast and served at once. 

French Toast 

Beat 2 eggs until light and creamy; add }4 teaspoon 
salt, a pinch of nutmeg and }4 cup of milk; mix well; 
cut bread in }4 inch slices, then cut in triangles; dip in 
the egg and milk mixture and then place in a well greased 
hot frying pan and cook on each side until a golden brown. 
Serve hot with generous teaspoons of jam or jelly in the 
center of each slice and sprinkle with powdered sugar. 

Croutons 

Cut dry bread into yi inch slices; then cut into cubes. 
Place in a very moderate oven to dry and become brown. 
Stir frequently. It will take about 20 minutes to dry the 
'croutons.

Wajfles and Griddle Cakes 

Iaffles, the most popular of all breakfast breads, 
are not found on the menu of the average house- 
wife due perhaps, to the general impression that 
they are difficult to make and bake and should 
be attempted only by professional cooks. So the waffle 
iron is not usually included in the general kitchen equip- 
ment, and the housewife does not have an opportunity to 
test out her ability to make satisfactory waffles. A 
waffle iron is not an expensive piece of equipment and 
should be included among the kitchen necessities. The 
pleasure the household will derive from the occasional 
Sunday breakfast of hot, crisp waffles and maple syrup 
will amply repay for both the investment and the effort 
to produce this tempting breakfast bread. 

The waffle irons are made of iron or aluminum and 
come in two styles, the low iron to be used on a coal or 
wood range and the high iron for use over a gas flame. 
Then there is the electric waffle iron, made of aluminum 
to be used right on the table, so that each person served 
is sure to receive the waffle hot from the iron. 

The iron waffle iron, being less expensive, is the one 
most commonly used, and when new needs seasoning be- 
fore it can be used satisfactorily, otherwise the waffles will 
stick to the iron. Take the upper parts of the new waffle 
iron and boil for at least half an hour in boiling water and 
washing soda or washing powder. 

Then scrub well with a stiff brush, rinse in clean hot 
water and dry over the fire. Place in the lower portion, 
which has been washed well but not boiled. Grease the 
upper part lightly on both sides with beef suet or an un- 
salted fat and let remain over a low fire for an hour or 
more, turning frequently. The iron is then ready to use. 
The aluminum irons do not require this treatment; they 
are ready for use at once and do not need greasing. 

After using, the upper part of the waffle iron may be 
rubbed clean with soft paper. This is a much better 
method than using soap and water after the iron has been 



MRS. DE GRAF'S COOK BOOK [201] 

seasoned. The lower part may be washed, but should be 
well dried before setting away to prevent rusting. 

The batter for both waffles and griddle cakes is of about 
the same consistency. Many persons prefer a somewhat 
substantial griddle cake although the very thin ones are 
considered the best by epicures. The griddle cake batter 
does not require shortening. 

Waffles require the thinnest of batters. If it is not thin 
the waffles will not be crisp. The most efficient way of 
putting a batter together is to sift all of the dry in- 
gredients, then combine with the liquids, and beat well 
with an egg beater. For a very light batter the eggs 
should be beaten separately, the yolks mixed with the 
milk, then added gradually to the dry materials, the 
melted shortening is then beaten into the mixture, and 
the stiffly beaten egg whites folded in last. 

Beating the whole egg until light, then adding the milk 
and combining with the dry ingredients, and beating 
until smooth with the egg beater is a much easier method 
and will prove just as satisfactory, although perhaps 
not quite so airy as the first method. A standard recipe 
can be used in making any quantity of batter desired. 
One egg, 1 cup of milk, 1 cup of flour, 2 level teaspoons of 
baking powder, yi teaspoon of salt and 1 tablespoon of 
melted shortening. This quantity of batter will make 3 
waffles. Now with these proportions in mind the house- 
keeper need not refer to a recipe but can make any num- 
ber of waffles desired. If sour milk is used take only one 
teaspoon of baking powder and add J^ teaspoon of bak- 
ing soda to neutralize the acidity of the sour milk. If the 
milk is quite thick it may be necessary to use a.little more 
than one cup in order to get the batter thin enough. 

When eggs are scarce or high in price 1 egg only can be 
used for 2 cupfuls of milk, flour, etc.; in that case J^ cupful 
more milk should be used to make the batter of the right 
consistency. Cooked rice or other left-over cereal may be 
added to this batter to give variety. In that case use % 
cupful of the cooked cereal, and J^ cupful of flour, in- 
stead of the full cup of flour given in the foundation 
formula. 



[202] MRS. DE GRAF'S COOK BOOK 

Any of the self-rising pancake flours may be used for 
waffles by omitting the baking powder and following the 
waffle recipe. 

The waffle iron should be well heated and just before 
adding the batter grease the iron on the side nearest the 
flame; grease thoroughly, but lightly; turn the iron so 
that the greased portion is on top. This will grease the 
ungreased side, which is usually enough after the iron 
has been used several times. Place about 5 tablespoons 
of batter in the center of the iron. This will be sufficient 
to fill it. Lower the upper half of the iron and turn at 
once. Do not have the gas too high or the waffles will 
bake too quickly and not be thoroughly cooked and crisp. 
If the waffle iron has been properly heated the waffles 
will be evenly browned on both sides. 

Waffles should be served as soon as baked to be at their 
best. If, however, it is necessary to keep them for a short 
time, place on the wire rack in a warm oven, keeping each 
waffle separate. If placed on a plate and allowed to stand, 
the waffles will become heavy and soggy on the under- 
side. Serve only 1 waffle at a time to each person. If 
placed one on top of another they will not be crisp. Served 
with either maple syrup, jam or jelly, what could make a 
more palatable breakfast than hot, crisp waffles ? 

Note. — ^All measurements are level and flour is sifted once before 
measuring. One-half pint measuring cup is used. 



Griddle Cakes 

1 cup flour. 1 egg. 

2 teaspoons baking powder. %, cup milk. 
a teaspoon salt. 

Method of Preparation: The most simple and 
efficient way to put a batter together is to mix and sift 
the dry ingredients first, then mix the liquid and the 
well-beaten yolks of eggs and combine the mixtures. If 
using shortening, add it melted, and finally fold in the 
stiffly beaten whites of eggs. 

Eggs should alwajrs be beaten separately when light- 
ness IS desired, but if time is limited the result will be 
satisfactory if eggs are beaten together. 



MRS. DE GRAF'S COOK BOOK [203] 

For griddle cakes, the griddle should be well heated, 
and, if not soapstone or aluminum, should be greased. 
Drop batter by spoonfuls, and when puffed and full of 
bubbles and cooked on the edges, turn and brown on the 
other side. Never turn griddle cakes but once. Other- 
wise they will be heavy. 

Sour Milk Griddle Cakes 
2 cups flour. 1 egg. 

Yi teaspoon salt. 2 cups sour milk. 

1 teaspoon soda.

batter by omitting an equal quantity of flour and using 
not more than 1 cupful of cereal to each cupful of flour. 

Bread Griddle Cakes 

Use the regular recipe for griddle cakes, substituting 
stale bread crumbs either wholly or in part for the flour. 
More liquid will be necessary, the quantity depending 
upon the staleness of the crumbs.

Biscuit Dough and Variations of Biscuit 
'Dough 

Just why so many housewives fail to make a good bis- 
cuit seems strange, for this dough is one of the easiest 
mixtures to make. Perhaps failure is due to inaccurate 
measurements and too slow an oven. This type of dough 
requires a hot oven. Too often the amount of ingredients 
are a matter of guess work rather than of measurement, 
and, unless one is a skilled cook, the results of guesswork 
are usually indifferent. 

When sweet milk is used always remember that 2 level 
teaspoonfuls of baking powder are used to each cup of 
sifted flour. This never changes, no matter how many 
cups of flour you are using. 

There should be no taste of baking powder in the fin- 
ished product. If there is, then your measurements have 
not been level, or you are using a very poor quality of 
baking powder. 

When using sour or buttermilk, then soda will be your 
leavening agent. In that case remember that ^ a tea- 
spoon of soda is used to each cup of sour milk. Or you can 
use yi teaspoon of soda, to neutralize the acidity of 1 cup 
of sour milk and 1 teaspoon of baking powder to each cup 
of flour. 

Do not dissolve soda in the sour milk, as that process 
releases the gases too soon and the dough will be less 
light. Always sift the soda with the flour for biscuit 
doughs. Sour milk can be substituted for sweet milk in 
any recipe if these rules are followed. 

Perhaps you have never stopped to consider the pos- 
sibilities of the ordinary biscuit dough. This mixture is 
easily adaptable to variety. 

It is quickly mixed and baked and has the advantage 
of being one of the most inexpensive mixtures to make. 
Many very palatable desserts can be prepared from this 
dough, besides several varieties of bread. 

When the berry season begins come visions of old- 
fashioned shortcake, the kind made from biscuit dough, 



MRS. DE GRAF'S COOK BOOK [207] 

covered generously with crushed strawberrie*. These 
old-fashioned shortcakes may be made of any variety of 
fruits, fresh or cooked, but the strawberry is queen of 
them all. 

However, you must bear in mind that biscuit mixtures, 
to be at their best, should be served while fresh, generally 
direct from the oven. A heavy biscuit is usually due to 
inaccurate measurements and too slow, an oven. This 
class of dough takes a hot oven. 

In the accompanying recipes the term shortening means 
fat, any kind you may prefer. Half butter and half lard 
always give satisfactory results, but as butter is very ex- 
pensive, and many people do not like lard, most any of 
the substitutes for either one will be found satisfactory. 

Desserts made of biscuit doughs will be found under hot 
desserts. 

Note. — ^AU measurements are level and flour is sifted once before 
measuring. One-half pint measuring cup is used. 

Baking Powder Biscuits

CHAPTER TEN 

PASTRY 
PIES 



[216] MRS. DE GRAF'S COOK BOOK 



Pastry and Pies 




loNTRARY to the general opinion, pastry is not hard 
jto make. In fact, once the fundamental principles 
jare understood, pastry is much easier and more 
'quickly made than cake. And if pastry is not of the 
best, crisp and flaky, then it should 'be dropped from the 
list of desserts, because tough, soggy pie crust is neither 
appetizing nor wholesome. 

Pie is not an economical dish and poor pies are a waste 
of good material, for they should not be eaten. When 
making pastry, keep these rules in mind. Fat makes a pie 
crust crisp, therefore, to economize on shortening will 
produce poor pastry. The amount of air which is incor- 
porated in the dough makes the crust flaky, so the dough 
requires careful handling. Water makes pastry tough, 
and only enough should be used to hold the dough together. 
Pastry flour is recommended because it absorbs less mois- 
ture than a strong flour. However, the regular family 
flour will give good results. 

If all the ingredients are cold the dough will be much 
easier to handle. Warm shortening absorbs the flour, 
making a dense mixture in which no air is inclosed, and 
which becomes sticky and difficult to roll on the board. 
Chopping the fat into the flour is recommended. If 
rubbed in with the finger tips the warmth of the fingers 
will heat the fat somewhat unless the manipulation is 
quick and skillful. Do not rub or chop the fat into the 
flour too thoroughly; mix until the consisteiicy of coarse 
meal. Plain crisp pastry has all the shortening added to 
the flour. For flaky pastry only half shortening is added 
to the flour and the remainder is rolled into the dough after 
the liquid has been added. 

When adding the cold water use a knife for mixing, add 
very slowly, using only enough to hold the mixture to- 
gether. If too much water is used it will be necessary to 
use more flour when the dough is rolled out, and if that is 
the case the pastry will be tough from handling and the fat 
and flour will not be in the right proportion. Use only a 
sprinkling of flour to keep the molding board dry, so that 



MRS. DE GRAF'S COOK BOOK [217] 

the dough may be rolled easily. After rolling, the pastry 
should be allowed to stand, closely covered, in a cool place. 
The moisture acts on the gluten in the flour, making it 
much easier to roll. Handle the dough as quickly and as 
lightly as possible. Bake in a hot oven, for no matter how 
carefully the dough has been made, if not properly baked 
the pie will be a failure. 

Unless carefully baked, undercrusts are often soggy. For 
this reason pastry shells baked without the filling will give 
the best results. If, however, a filled two-crust pie is 
desired, do not put the pastry and filling together until 
the oven is ready to receive them, for the moisture of the 
filling will soak into the pie crust. 

Pie crust should be rolled out to about one-eighth of an 
inch in thickness. When lining the pan. lay the crust on 
loosely and allow it to come a little over the edge. The 
scissors will be found the most convenient means of cutting 
the dough. If the pastry is stretched it will shrink and 
probably break while baking. When making fruit pies 
which may be very juicy, the undercrust can be brushed 
over with unbeaten white of an egg, which coagulates as 
soon as the heat reaches it and makes an impervious coat- 
ing. Or the bottom crust may be sprinkled with very fine 
dry bread crumbs or with a little, flour which will absorb the 
excessive moisture at once and prevent the crust from 
becoming soaked. 

After the filling is put in, the top crust is placed in 
position; this should be rolled out about one-eighth of an 
mch thick also, and should extend about a quarter of an 
inch beyond the pie plate. Then fold the top crust under 
the bottom one and flute the edge either with the fingers 
or a fork. Perforate the top crust so that the steam may 
escape — or the crust will be soggy on the under side and 
pufi^ up in the center. If a very dark brown is desired the 
top crust may be brushed over lightly with milk. When 
making very juicy pies allow one tablespoon of flour to 
each cupful of sugar used. Mix sugar and flour until well 
blended, then sprinkle over the fruit. Or the pie may be 
bound around the edge with a narrow strip of cloth which 
has been dipped in either milk or water. 



[218] MRS. DE GRAF'S COOK BOOK 

When making pastry shells for a one-crust pie, invert a 
deep pie pan and place the pastry on it, pinching the edges 
to make a deep border. Prick the pastry in several places 
with a fork. Place in a hot oven; in about ten minutes the 
shell should be a golden color. It should be watched care- 
fully until ready to take from the oven. Remove from the 
tin and place the filling in the shell. 

Pastry for several pies may be made at one time, rolled 
and set in a cool place in a well-covered utensil until 
needed. This is sometimes a great advantage for a very 
busy housewife. Always serve pastry fresh or reheat if 
the pie is a day old and it will become crisp and fresh. 

There really is no mystery, no magic possessed by a 
favored few, to make good pastry. Just follow the general 
directions and you will surely have satisfactory results. 

Note. — ^All measurements are level and flour Is sifted once before 
measuring. One-half pint measuring cup Is used. 

Plain Pastry 

114 cups flour. }4 cup shortening. 

H teaspoon salt. }4 (about) cup cold water. 

Sift flour and salt together. Chop shortening into the 
flour; add liquid gradually, using knife. This dough 
should become stiff enough not to stick to the sides of the 
mixing bowl. Place dough on molding board and roll to 
}4 inch thickness. Then fold one-third of this sheet of 
pastry over the center, fold the remaining third over the 
first fold, then fold across. Roll to one-fourth inch thick- 
ness again. 

This pastry can be used at once, but is improved if al- 
lowed to stand several hours. By folding the dough in 
this manner, layers of air are inclosed, which expand when 
the pastry is placed in the hot oven, making the pie flaky. 
While the oven should be hot at first the heat should be 
reduced after it has browned. 

Flaky Pastry 

1}4 cups flour. H cup butter. 

i^ teaspoon salt. H (about) cup of cold water. 

14: cup shortening. 

Proceed as for plain pastry, leaving out the butter, 



MRS. DE GRAF'S COOK BOOK [219] 

which should be washed in cold water until smooth and 
elastic, then dried. Roll out dough, place butter in the 
center, fold o^er dough as directed above, and roll out. 
Repeat this twice. Dough is then ready for use. If butter 
breaks through the dough, set aside until cool, when it can 
be easily handled. This pastry is for pastry shells, tarts, 
etc.

of corn starch, flour or arrowroot with enough cold water 
to make a smooth paste. Add to hot juice and cook stirring 
constantly until the mixture thickens; add to fruit and cool 
before using. One teaspoonful of lemon juice will add 
greatly to the flavor of all fruit pies. Line a deep pie plate 
with plain pastry, pour in the cold fruit mixture, place on 
upper crust and bake about IS minutes in a hot oven.

Cakes with Shortening 

iNCE cake comes on the list of luxuries, the utmost 
care should be taken both in the method of prep- 
aration and in the quality of material used. It is 
not difficult to make a good cake if good materials 
are used and care in measuring and combining ingredients 
is exercised. However, the baking requires more study 
and care than the mixing, for no matter how well you have 
put the cake batter together, if the oven is not right the 
cake will be a failure. In the first place, choose a reliable 
recipe, then assemble all necessary materials and utensils. 
Pans should be prepared and oven heated before mixing 
the cake batter. If the ingredients are all measured be- 
fore actual mixing begins the work will be much easier 
and unexpected interruptions will not create a doubt as 
to whether all the materials have been used. For success 
care must be taken in measuring, all measurements being 
level. For butter cakes there are two ways to add the 
shortening; for inexpensive cakes containing a small 
quantity of shortening the result will be found satisfactory 
if the fat is melted and added to the batter after the cake 
is all mixed. For the richer cakes, where }4 cup or more 
of shortening is used, the shortening is beaten to a cream, 
or until smooth and waxy. This can be accomplished 
easily if the mixing bowl is rinsed with hot water, then 
wiped dry before the shortening is placed in it. Add the 
sugar gradually to the creamed shortening and continue 
to beat until the mixture resembles whipped cream. 

Beating the butter to a cream first makes the creaming 
of butter and sugar an easy process. The eggs may then 
be added whole, one at a time, and beating the mixture 
thoroughly each time; or the eggs may be separated, 
beating the yolks until thick and lemon colored and the 
whites until stiff. Add the beaten yolks to the creamed 
butter and sugar mixture; add the sifted dry ingredients 
alternately with the liquid, beating the mixture well. Add 
some flour to the mixture before any of the liquid is used. 
This prevents the mixture from curdling which, while it 
does not spoil the cake, it will not be of the right texture. 



MRS. DE GRAF'S COOK BOOK [229] 

Adding the whole unbeaten egg to the batter produces a 
close textured^ moist cake, while beating the eggs sepa- 
rately gives a light dryer cake. Water may be used in- 
stead of milk, the mixture will be of a different texture. 
If eggs are beaten separately the stiffly beaten whites 
should be carefully folded into the mixture. The more the 
cake is beaten before the egg whites are added the firmer 
will be the texture of the cake. 

Cakes should be baked as soon as mixed. A great deal 
depends on the proper baking, and the best way to assure 
satisfactory results is to time the cake and divide the time 
of baking into quarters. In the first quarter the mixture 
should rise in the pan; in the second quarter it should 
continued to rise and brown in spots; in the third quarter 
the top of the cake should be uniformly browned, and in 
the last quarter the cake should shrink from the sides of 
the pan and it should be baked. 

If in doubt as to whether the cake should be taken from 
the oven test it by touching lightly in the center. If 
baked, the mixture will spring back, but if not quite 
baked it will hold the imprint of the finger. 

This rule for timing applies to all cakes, whether layer 
or loaf, or where a slow or medium oven is used. 

The time for baking will vary a little for different ovens, 
but the average time for a medium-sized layer cake is 
from IS to 20 minutes. Loaf cakes 3 inches thick will 
require about 40 minutes; sheet cakes and cup cakes 
about 25 minutes. Cakes baked in a brick shaped pan 
will require an hour or longer. A moderate oven will give 
the best results for nearly all cakes. 

If the batter rises in a cone in the center you are using 
too hot an oven, and a crust has formed before the mix- 
ture has had time to rise; or too much flour has been used. 

When the cake is baked, it should be allowed to cool 
before being turned from the pan, and it should cool so 
that there will be a circulation of air about it, to prevent 
the steam from condensing and giving a moist surface to 
the cake. 

A few formulae are all that is required to make many 
varieties of cake. Flavorings, fruits, nuts and the various 
fillings and icings will give an unlimited variety even 



[230] MRS. DE GRAF'S COOK BOOK 

though the same cake batter is used. The advantage of 
using one or two foundation recipes lies mainly in the fact 
that practice makes perfect and one can soon become 
expert in mixing and baking the cake better. 

There is a type of cake very popular that does not re- 
quire a standard cake batter. These cakes are more like 
meringues. They are very easy to make but somewhat ex- 
pensive. These require a special type of pan called a 
spring form. The rim is removable, leaving the cake on the 
bottom of the pan for it cannot be removed until cut in 
slices. Many very attractive cakes are made in these 
spring forms. 

Note. — All measurements are level and flotir is sifted once before 
measuring. One-half pint measuring cup is used. 

Foundation Cake Recipe 

J^ cup shortening. 3 eggs. 

1}4 cups sugar. }i cup milk or water.

Boston Cream Pie 

Although called a pie this dish is really a cake. Make 
the quick cake and bake in 2 layers. For one cake make 
y^ of the French cream filling. When both cake and 
filling are cold, spread the filling between the layers and 
sprinkle powdered sugar over the top. 

Lady Finger Cake 

First Part: Second Part: 

2 squares unsweetened choco- yi, cup unsalted butter, 

rlate or 1 cup ground choco- 1 cup powdered sugar, sifted, 

late. 4 egg whites stiffly beaten. 

J^ cup sugar. J^ cup finely chopped walnuts. 

M cup cold water. 1 teaspoon vanilla. 

4 eggs yolked, beaten. Yi lb. lady fingers. 

Put unsweetened chocolate in the upper part of a double 
boiler; set over hot water to melt. When melted add sugar, 
water and beaten yolks. Cook until very thick, stirring 
occasionally. Ground chocolate needs no melting. Set 
aside until thoroughly chilled then prepare second part. 
Cream the butter until waxy; gradually add sugar, beat 
until creamy, then add vanilla and chopped nuts. Com- 
bine first and second mixtures and when thoroughly 
mixed fold in the stifily beaten egg whites. It is necessary 
to have a pan with a removable rim called a spring form. 
Cover the bottom of the pan with split lady fingers, then 
place split lady fingers close together all around the sides 
of the pan. If pan is slightly buttered the lady fingers 
can be pressed firmly to the pan, the bottom layer of lady 
fingers will help keep those on the sides in place. Pour in the 
chocolate mixture, cover top closely with lady fingers and 
set the cake in a cool place for at least 12 hours before 
serving. It will become firm enough to slice. Before serv- 
ing carefully remove rim of pan and cover the top with 
whipped cream. Decorate with cream pressed through 
a pastry bag or with walnut meats or cherries. This makes 
an unusually attractive dessert and will serve 12 persons. 



MRS. DE GRAF'S COOK BOOK [235] 

Crumb Cake 

3 eggs separated. yi teaspoon baking powder. 

14 cup sugar. J^ cup chopped nuts. 

3 tablespoons cracker meal. 1 teaspoon vanilla. 

Beat egg yolks, add sugar, beat until creamy. Add 
cracker meal, baking powder and nuts, carefully fold in 
the stiffly beaten egg whites. Pour into a greased spring 
form. Bake IS minutes in a medium oven. Cool, remove 
rim of pan. To serve — cover top of cake with raspberry 
jam; cover jam with a layer of finely chopped nuts; cover 
nuts with a layer of sweetened whipped cream and gar- 
nish top with walnut meats, maraschino cherries, or 
whipped cream pressed through a pastry bag using a star 
tube. 

King Cake 

First Part: Second Part: 

1)4 cups flour. 2 eggs separated. 

)4 cup shortening. J^ cup sugar. 

}/2 teaspoon salt. K cup flour. 

M cup cold water. 1 teaspoon vanilla. 
J^ cup raspberry jam. 

Sift flour and salt and rub in the shortening as for plain 
pastry. Gradually add water using a knife for mixing. 
Roll on a very slightly floured board to fit a round cake 
pan, reserving the remaining dough to use later. Set in a 
cool place. For the second part beat egg whites until stiff 
and yolks until creamy, add sugar gradually to yolks 
beating well with the egg beater. Add flavoring and care- 
fully fold in the flour and beaten egg whites. Cover the 
bottom of the pastry lined pan with jam and pour the 
cake mixture over that. Roll the remaining pastry into 
an oblong strip and cut into lengths }4 inch wide and long 
enough to fit loosely over the top of the pan. Wet the 
edges with water and press firmly across the top of the 
pastry shell. Four strips each way crossing lattice fashion 
will be sufficient. Place in a fairly hot oven reducing the 
heat in 10 minutes to moderate. Bake until the cake 
springs back if touched lightly in the center. Cool before 
serving. This cake is like that sold in French confectioners 
under the same name.

Sponge Cakes 




Jhen eggs reach a normal price it is possible to in- 
dulge in the various types of sponge cakes and 
even angel cake does not seem impossibly extrava- 
gant. True sponge cakes are made without baking 
powder and are light, moist and delicate. They can be 
given to children and those who cannot eat rich cakes, or 
cakes containing shortening. An endless variety of small 
attractive cakes can be made from almost any good 
sponge cake formula, and are suitable for almost any 
occasion but particularly attractive for afternoon teas 
and children's parties. A true sponge cake contains no 
baking powder but is lightened entirely by the air which 
has been beaten into the eggs, and for that reason a whip 
egg-beater should be used to beat the egg whites, as this 
type of egg-beater incorporates approximately j^ more 
air than a rotary egg beater. It is the expansion of this 
air, when placed in the oven, that leavens the cake and 
the more air incorporated, the lighter the cake will be. 
Sponge cakes made with baking powder do not require 
the number of eggs necessary for a true sponge cake. 
Liquid is added also to replace eggs. These sponge cakes 
may be beaten with a rotary egg beater for the baking 
powder will make them light. Such sponge cakes are 
quickly and easily made but while light and palatable are 
never so delicate nor fine in texture as the true sponge 
cakes. 

Pans containing a center tube are the most satisfactory 
for loaf sponge cake. The cakes will bake more evenly 
and much quicker in this type of pan. In fact for the best 
results with loaf cakes made without baking powder, a 
pan should be kept for this purpose only, for it should 
never be greased. As the cake rises it will cling to the 
sides of an ungreased pan, producing a lighter cake. For 
sponge cakes made with baking powder greased pans 
should be used. A true sponge cake should be cooled in 
the pan in which it is baked; having the pan inverted; in 
this way, the moist cell walls of the cake will not settle, 
but will stretch, making the cake light. Pans come pro- 



MRS. DE GRAF'S COOK BOOK [237] 

vided with little extensions to invert them or the pan may 
be raised on two saucers. The air must circulate around 
the cake. When cool the cake can easily be removed by 
running a flat knife between the cake and the pan. 

Quickness in putting sponge cake together is one of the 
essentials to success. To mix a true sponge cake, separate 
the yolks and whites of the eggs. Beat the yolks with a 
rotary egg beater until very creamy. Add the sugar 
gradually, beating constantly; add flavoring. Beat the 
egg whites with an egg whip until the bowl can be inverted. 
Fold very carefully into the next mixture, then care- 
fully fold in the flour. Do not beat the mixture after the 
flour is added, simply fold the ingredients over and over 
until all are well mixed or blended. If beaten or stirred, 
most of the work of inclosing a large amount of air will be 
undone by breaking these air bubbles. The cake should 
be put in the pan at once and placed in a moderate oven. 

For angel cake the whites of the eggs are beaten with 
an egg whip until the dish can be inverted; the sugar is 
carefully folded into them, adding gradually; then the 
flour folded into the mixture in the same manner. Use a 
moderate oven. An average sized loaf, sponge cake will 
require about 50 minutes to bake. 

The cheaper sponge cakes where few eggs and baking 
powder is used are baked in a hotter oven than the true 
sponge cakes and may be baked in layers, a loaf, small 
cakes, or baked in a shallow pan and cut into small cakes. 

Sponge cakes are wholesome and delicate and off'er a 
number of variations to be used for almost any occasion. 



Note. — All measurements are level and flour is sifted once before 
measuring. One-half pint measuring cup is used. 

Angel Cake 

H cup whites of eggs. 1 teaspoon each almond and 

]/i teaspoon cream of tartar. lemon flavoring. 

}i cup sugar. J^ cup flour. 

Beat egg whites until foamy, using a whip egg-beater; 
add cream of tartar, then beat eggs until very stiff and 
dry. This is most important, otherwise the cake will be 
tough and leathery. Add sugar gradually, carefully fold- 



[238] MRS. DE GRAF'S COOK BOOK 

ing it in; then add flavoring and lastly the flour, folding 
in gradually. Bake in an ungreased pan about 45 min- 
utes. 

This makes a small cake; double the quantity for a 
larger one, baking from SO to 60 minutes. 

True Sponge Cake 

6 egg yolks. }/2 teaspoon cream of tartar. 

1 cup sugar. 1 teaspoon each lemon and va- 
1 cup flour. nilla. 

6 egg whites. 

Beat the yolks of eggs until thick; add sugar gradually, 
beating with the egg-beater; add flavoring. Beat the 
whites of the eggs until stiffs and firm, using a whip egg- 
beater; fold carefully into the egg yolk mixture, then 
gradually fold in the flour. Pour into an ungreased tube 
cake pan and bake in a slow oven about 50 minutes. 

This formula will make two dozen small cakes. 

Plain Sponge Cake 

3 eggs. 1 teaspoon baking powder. 

1 cup sugar. ]4, teaspoon salt. 

3 tablespoons water. 1 teaspoon vanilla. 

1 cup flour. 1 teaspoon lemon. 

Beat the eggs without separating until light and creamy, 
add sugar gradually and beat again till thick and very 
light colored. Add water, beat again, add sifted dry in- 
gredients. Beat well, then add flavoring. Pour into a 
greased cake pan, one with center tube preferred, and bake 
about 30 minutes in a moderate oven, or bake in layers. 

Chocolate Sponge Cake 

Use either sponge cake recipe, omitting 2 tablespoons 
of flour and substituting 1 tablespoon of cocoa or 2 of 
ground chocolate. Use vanilla flavoring only. 

JeUy RoU 

Use plain sponge cake foundation, but separate the 
eggs, beating each well. Proceed as above, adding 1 
tablespoon of melted shortening and folding in the stiflly 
beaten whites of eggs last. Have a shallow pan well 



MRS. DE GRAF'S COOK BOOK [239] 

greased and covered with greased paper. Pour in cake 
mixture and bake in a hot oven between 10 and 12 min- 
utes. Turn at once onto a cloth which has been sprinkled 
with powdered sugar, remove paper, cut off crusts, spread 
with jelly and roll. (This must be done quickly.) Wrap 
in cloth until cool and sprinkle with powdered sugar. 

Chocolate Roll 

6 eggs, beaten separately. J^ cup ground chocolate. 

K cup granulated sugar. 1 teaspoon vanilla. 

Beat yolks until creamy with a rotary egg-beater; add 
sugar and chocolate gradually, beating well; add flavor- 
ing. Whip egg whites until very stiff, and fold carefully 
into the mixture. Line a well greased pan with greased 
paper and pour in the mixture. Bake in a moderate 
oven 25 minutes. Turn out on a towel, remove paper and 
roll as for jelly roll. Set aside to cool. Whip 1 cup of 
cream, add 2 tablespoons of powdered sugar and 1 table- 
spoonful of vanilla. Unroll cake, spread with whipped 
cream, reroU and serve with a chocolate sauce.

Icings and Fillings 



Cake icings and fillings have improved greatly both 
in quality and variety from those used a generation 
ago. Now many of these frostings are as delicate and 
fine as the creamy French confectionery. A few founda- 
tion recipes form the basis for most of these icings 
and fillings, and when these are once mastered it will 
be possible to produce almost any variety. The de- 
velopment of these foundation recipes is both interest- 
ing and simple. The uncooked icings are the easiest, 
for very little skill is necessary in their preparation. 

The plain confectioner's icing is made of hot water, 
powdered or confectioner's sugar and flavoring. 

Other liquids than water oflFer a number of variations 
of this plain recipe. Cream, with vanilla or mocha flavor- 
ing, makes a rich, creamy icing; lemon juice may replace 
a portion of the hot water for lemon icing; pure fruit 
juices, such as orange, pineapple, etc., make excellent 
icings and will be found particularly good for sponge 
cakes. Strong, hot coff'ee or mocha extract may replace 
the hot water, making the mocha icing. 

When using other liquids than water it is not necessary 
to heat them. Confectioners' icing will become firm and 
glossy soon after being spread on the cake. It never be- 
comes hard and "sugary" and keeps for some time, and 
does not crumble when cut. 

Chocolate confectioners' icing may have }4 cup of 
chopped nuts added or equal quantities of chopped nuts 
and chopped raisins. It may also be changed somewhat 
by using either vanilla or cinnamon to flavor. This plain 
foundation recipe has many possibilities for variety and 
is so quickly and easily made, there need be no waste. 

The quantities given in the recipe will ice an average- 
sized cake. If this quantity is not right for the size cake 
you wish, a little practice will soon teach you the right 
proportions. One of the best features of this type of frost- 
ing is that you are really unable to spoil it If you have 
not been accurate in your measurements and the icing is 



MRS. DE GRAF'S COOK BOOK [241] 

too thick add more liquid until of the right consistency, 
or if the icing is too thin more sugar may be added. 

Butter icings are also uncooked and are very easily 
prepared. This type of icing is more often used as a cake 
filling, and is very popular. Unsalted butter will give the 
best flavored icing, but if salted butter is used it should 
be well washed in cold water to remove all the salt. 

The cooked icings are not quite so easily made. This 
class of icing has much greater possibilities for variety 
than the uncooked icing. There are several varieties of 
boiled icings, but this usually applies to a sugar syrup 
which has been boiled until the mixture will form a "soft 
ball" when tested in cold water (about 238 degrees F. on 
a sugar thermometer), then the syrup is added gradually 
to the well-beaten white of egg. To test carefully dip a 
teaspoon into the syrup and drop into cold water. Roll 
between the fingers under the water. If syrup is sticky 
it is not cooked enough; if hard it is cooked too long. It 
should roll in a soft ball. Always use a fresh cup of cold 
water for each testing. 

This icing will never prove a failure if the rules and de- 
tails of the process are carefully followed. Sugar has a 
tendency to crystallize and to overcome this, care must 
be taken when mixing the water and sugar. First add 
the sugar to the saucepan, then carefully pour over the 
water, which should be boiling hot, so that the sugar will 
dissolve at once. Do not stir and cause crystals of sugar 
to adhere to the sides of the saucepan; simply mix suffi- 
ciently to dissolve the sugar, then cover the saucepan and 
when the syrup reaches the boiling point remove the 
cover and cook to the soft-ball stage without stirring. 

By covering the mixture until boiling point is reached, 
the steam will wash down any grains of sugar which may 
have gathered on the sides of the pan. This may sound 
complicated, but is really very simple, and if these pre- 
cautions are taken and the syrup cooked to the "soft- 
ball" stage, the finished icing will be creamy. If these 
rules are not followed, if the syrup is stirred while cook- 
ing, or if cooked too long, the icing will be hard and 
"sugary." 



[242] MRS. DE GRAF'S COOK BOOK 

A very much easier cooked icing is made by cooking 
the syrup over hot water or in a double boiler. This is 
called quick icing. 

This is a very simple and satisfactory method and if 
the directions are followed exactly this icing may be used 
for filling and icings in place of the more complicated 
boiled frosting. 

Note. — ^AU measurements are level and floviT Is sifted once before 
measuring. One-lialf pint measuring cup is used. 

Boiled Icing 

114 cups granulated sugar. }4 cup hot water. 

Whites of 2 eggs. 

Add hot water to sugar, being careful not to stir so 
there will be no sugar on sides of saucepan, cover until 
boiling point is reached, then remove and cook syrup 
until it will form a soft ball when rolled between the fingers 
in a cup of cold water. Pour on well-beaten whites of eggs 
and beat until stiff, then flavor. 



Quick Icing 

M cup sugar. 1 egg white. 

3 tablespoons cold water. 

Put sugar, water and unbeaten egg white into a double 
boiler, place over boiling water and beat with an egg 
beater for 6 minutes. Remove from the fire and beat 
until thick enough to spread; add flavoring. 



Confectioner's Icing 

2 tablespoons hot water. H teaspoon lemon flavoring. 

Confectioner's sugar. 

To the hot water add enough confectioner's sugar to 
make stifF enough to spread. Do not use this icing on a 
hot cake or it will melt. Any fruit juice may be used in- 
stead of water. Orange juice and grated rind are partic- 
ularly satisfactory.

Chocolate Confectioner's Icing and Filling 

2 squares unsweetened choco- 1}4 cups powdered sugar, 
late or 14 cup ground chocolate. }4 cup hot water. 
1 teaspoon butter. 1 teaspoon vanilla. 

Melt chocolate and butter over hot water. When 
melted add sugar, then hot water gradually, beating until 
smooth, then add flavoring. Let stand until thick enough 
to spread between layers. If used for icing only, can be 
used at once. 

This filling may be varied by using cinnamon as flavor- 
ing or by using hot coff^ee instead of water. 

Also, either chopped walnuts or raisins may be added. 
Do not put between layers while they are hot or the 
filling will melt. 

Caramel Icing and Filling

boil cook 3 minutes. Take from the fire at once, add 
butter, turn into a cold bowl and beat until creamy; then 
add vanilla. 

This may be used as an icing or filling. One-third cup of 
chopped walnuts may be added for the filling. 

Creole Icing 

Make the quick icing. Beat until thick and pile on top 
of a loaf cake. When firm, pour over the top melted, un- 
sweetened chocolate, or make half the chocolate icing and

Small Cakes and Cookies 

Little cakes and cookies are so attractive and easy to 
serve. They make nice gifts, too, for those who do not 
have the time or the facilities for baking at home. And how 
the children love cookies or cakes which have been made 
especially for them I The mother who is always too busy 
or lacks the imagination and skill to cater to children: 
who never makes wonderful animal cookies or fat, dumpy 
gingerbread or doughnut men, has really deprived her off- 
spring of untold pleasure. Not only the eating of these 
mysterious, delightful creations, but to stand and watch 
them being made and to wait impatiently what seems 
ages before these miracles come out of the oven, all brown 
and fragrant. The memory of these childish joys is never 
forgotten. 

Any household department can supply inexpensive 
cookie cutters. They come in most attractive shapes — 
all sorts of animals, chickens, birds, stars, diamonds and 
hearts. So, if time is limited, animal cookies can easily 
take the place of the gingerbread man. 

Any rolled cookie recipe will be satisfactory. Only 
after the dough is mixed, set aside in a cool place for at 
least one hour, longer, if possible, to allow the dough to 
stiffen so it can be easily handled. Try not to work in a 
warm room when rolling and cutting and the process will 
be much easier. Lay the gingerbread man on a greased 
cookie sheet as you make him — then he won't have to be 
moved. Use whole allspice for the eyes, the star of a clove 
for the nose; a pointed knife will make a slit for the mouth 
— upturned, or not, as you wish — and dried currants or 
seedless raisins will answer for buttons down the front. 
The doughnut man is made by simply putting the round 
parts taken from the center together in the shape of a 
man and patting and joining them together. Or fry these 
centers; they make golden brown balls that can be rolled 
in sugar. The children will call them fried holes — which 
is really the right name after all. 

Muffin pans can be used to advantage for a variety of 
little cakes. Almost any cake batter may be used — Cup 



MRS. DE GRAF'S COOK BOOK [249] 

Pound, Devil's Food or Nut Cakes or Sponge Cake batter. 
Baked in this form the cakes may be decorated in many 
ways without requiring much time or effort. Turn up- 
side down (cutting a small piece ofFof the base so they will 
stand level) and either ice all over or just on top. Half a 
nut meat or chopped nuts may be placed on the fresh 
icing before it hardens; or cocoanut, candied fruits or 
marshmallows. They can be elaborately trimmed with a 
pastry bag, or the top may be cut off completely, then 
scoop out a small portion of the center and fill the space 
with whipped cream (using a pastry bag, if possible). 

- Now cut the top or lid in two in the center and replace, 
pushing down the center edges, and let the outside look 
like a half opened basket filled with whipped cream. 
Shallow sponge cakes are very attractive when baked in 
muffin pans, then iced, split half way through the center 
and filled with whipped cream, French cream or a me- 
ringue. Any favored cake recipe may be used to make 
these little cakes, and there is no form in which to make 
them that requires so little skill to make decorative. 

Cream puffs and eclairs are not difficult to make and 
can be made any size desired. For gift boxes, make about 
as big as a chocolate cream, place each small cream puff 
in a little paper case such as candy is packed in, then 
place in boxes and they will look wonderfully tempting. 

Dropped cookies are very easy to make and offer great 
variety. Any cake batter may be used. Drop from the 
tip of a spoon on a greased cookie pan, several inches 
apart, and bake in a medium oven. An ordinary cake 
recipe will make a good many cookies. They may be 
sprinkled with nuts or candied fruit, cocoanut, etc. Filled 
cookies are very rich and are made by spreading a filling 
on top of one cookie, then placing another on top, press- 
ing the edges firmly together. 

Little cakes and cookies are even more attractive than 
home made candies. Packed neatly in gay little boxes and 
tied with ribbons, they will prove a very acceptable gift. 
And for the informal social gatherings, always so popular 
during the holidays, little cakes and cookies offer many pos- 
sibilities.

[256] MRS. DE GRAF'S COOK BOOK 

Custards and Custard Desserts 

ILK and eggs are probably the most important foods 
in the diet. Either milk alone or milk and eggs 
constitute the diet of children and invalids and 
also are an important factor in the nutrition of 
healthy adults. The desirable qualities in milk are in no 
way destroyed by ordinary cooking. Whole milk con- 
tains all the food principles — protein, carbohydrates, water 
and minerals. Milk should be scalded not boiled as boiling 
renders it somewhat indigestible. Eggs also contain all 
the necessary food principles and are very easily digested 
if cooked at moderate heat. The combination of milk and 
eggs, furnish many palatable wholesome desserts. Custards 
are divided into two classes, the boiled or liquid custards 
which are steamed or cooked over hot water on top of the 
range; the baked or solid custard which is steamed in the 
oven. All custard mixtures should be set in hot water to 
cook and the water kept just under the boiling point. This 
gives the moderate heat required for all custards and pre- 
vents the custard reaching the boiling point. If cooked 
too fast or directly in a dry heat the mixture will separate 
and curdle. Certain rules govern the making of custards 
whether they are to be cooked in the oven or on top of the 
stove. Milk should be heated in a double boiler or over hot 
water, when bubbles appear on the surface the milk is 
scalded. Eggs shouldbe beaten slightly just enough to mix 
the yolk and white. When eggs are used as a thickening 
medium as in custards, they are not beaten until light. Sugar 
is gradually added to the eggs and the hot milk poured over 
the egg and sugar mixture. Eggs should not be added to a 
hot mixture; the hot liquid should be added to the eggs, 
otherwise the eggs would cook as they were added to the 
milk and the mixture would not be smooth. The custard 
is now ready to steam or bake. All custard puddings, pies, 
etc., are first mixed in this manner. The type of custard 
desired depends upon the number of eggs used to each cup 
or half pint of milk. One egg to a cupful of milk will give 
a liquid custard; or two yolks of eggs will give the same 
results as to consistency; a custard made entirely of egg 



MRS. DE GRAF'S COOK BOOK [257] 

yolks is much richer than one made of whole eggs. Two 
eggs to a cupful of milk will give a solid custard if baked 
and served in individual custard cups. But if the custard 
is to be unmolded and hold its shape perfectly, it will re- 
quire three eggs for each cupful of milk. A custard pie 
filling will be firmer if three eggs are used for each cupful of 
milk. When custards are to be served from the dish in 
which they were baked two eggs to each cupful of milk 
is sufficient. 

Junkets are a form of custard. They are very wholesome 
and digestible. They are made of milk thickened with ren- 
net. Rennet is supplied in the form of Junket Tablets. 
Junket desserts and custards are particularly good for 
children and can be given to babies who are just beginning 
to eat solid food. 

The cooking of custards requires care especially the 
liquid or soft custard. It must be stirred constantly until 
it thickens which can be determined by a thin coating that 
will cling to the spoon. Remove from the fire at once, stir 
for a few seconds as the heat of the utensil will finish the 
cooking. Turn at once into a cold bowl and when partly 
chilled add the flavoring. If by any chance the custard 
has been over cooked and looks curdled pour at once into 
a cold bowl and beat with a rotary egg beater. This will 
probably restore it but it will not be quite as creamy. The 
inexperienced cook will find that for each cupful of milk 
one-half teaspoonful of corn starch may be added to the 
sugar; this will usually prevent separation or curdling. 
However the custard will not be quite so delicate. All 
delicate puddings made with a custard foundation or with 
many eggs, require a moderate heat and should be set in 
a pan or hot water to cook, the water being kept under the 
boiling point. 

Soft Custard 

1 egg or 2 egg yolks. }4 cup sugar. 

1 cup milk. 1 teaspoon vanilla. 

Scald milk in a double boiler; beat eggs slightly . add 
sugar gradually. Pour hot milk over the mixture and stir 
until sugar is dissolved. Then set over hot water and stir 



[258] MRS. DE GRAF'S COOK BOOK 

gently, over a low fire until custard thickens and coats 
the spoon. Remove from the fire at once, stir a few seconds 
and turn into a cold bowl. Add flavoring when partly 
cold. This custard is used as a sauce. 



Baked Custard 

4 eggs. 1 teaspoon vanilla. 

2 cups milk. Nutmeg. 

J^ cup sugar. 

Scald milk in a double boiler; beat eggs slightly, add 
sugar, then pour hot milk over mixture. Add vanilla and 
pour into custard cups or a baking dish, sprinkle top with a 
little nutmeg and set dish in a pan of hot water and place 
in a moderate oven. Bake until firm in the center which 
can be determined by plunging a knife through the center. 
If the knife comes out clean the custard is baked. Indi- 
vidual custards will bake in about 20 minutes. If baked in 
a large dish about 45 minutes. 

Caramel Custard 

Yi cup granulated sugar. Baked custard recipe. 

Put the dry sugar in a saucepan over a low fire and stir 
constantly until it forms a golden syrup. The sugar goes 
through several stages before it melts and great care must 
be taken not to burn it or there will be a bitter taste. As 
the sugar melts remove the pan from the fire and stir letting 
the heat of the pan accomplish some of the melting. This 
prevents the chance of burning. When sugar is melted 
pour into warm custard cups or baking dish. If cups are 
warm, the syrup can be spread before it hardens. Pour 
in the prepared custard and bake. The caramel forms a 
sauce for the custard. 

Chocolate Custard 

Add yi cup of ground chocolate to the sugar wheri 
making the custard, or melt 2 squares of unsweetened 
chocolate and add to the mixture. This applies to both 
soft and baked custards.

Junket 

2 cups milk. 1 junket tablet. 

Vi. cup sugar. 1 teaspoon vanilla. 

\i teaspoon salt. 

Heat the milk to luke warm only; add sugar and salt. 
Crush the junket tablet, add to mixture and stir until 
dissolved; add vanilla (which may be omitted for young 
children). Pour into a serving dish and let stand in a 
warm place until thick. Junket is quite different from 
the usual form of dessert as it is kept warm in order to 
thicken. The rennet will not thicken the milk if it is cold 
or hot, it must only be luke warm. Junket may be served 
plain or with thin or whipped cream.

HOT PUDDINGS— STEAMED AND BAKED 

The secret of light steamed pudding is having the water 
constantly boiling during the entire period of steaming. 
The water should be two-thirds the depth of the mold. A 
kettle of boiling water should be kept to replenish the 
water as it boils down. If the water in which the pudding 
is cooked is not constantly boiling the pudding will be 
heavy. Grease the mold and cover well, and dredge gener- 
ously with sugar. This makes the dark puddings glossy 
on the surface. The time allowed for steaming is approxi- 
mately an hour for each cupful of flour or bread crumbs 
used. The pudding may be tested by removing the cover 
after it has cooked about the required time. If it springs 
back when pressed in the center the pudding is cooked; 
if not replace cover and steam longer. Steamed or baked 
puddings made of a batter provide a substantial dessert.

BREAD PUDDING VARIATIONS MANY AND 

TEMPTING, WITH HUMBLE DESSERT 

GLORIFIED 

The humble bread pudding is, perhaps, the most 
familiar of all hot desserts. However, it is not always 
a popular favorite, and, sad to say, not always palat- 
able, because too much bread is used in its making. 
The bread in a bread pudding is used merely to hold 
the other ingredients together and to supply a back- 
ground for flavors, not as a means of using a quan- 
tity of dry bread. A well-made bread pudding is a 
very palatable dessert and is capable of an almost endless 
number of variations. 

Remember, a pudding of this kind forms a hearty, sub- 



[272] MRS. DE GRAF'S COOK BOOK 

stantial dessert and is also easily digested. The following 
rules, if carefully adhered to, will enable anyone to make 
a delicate, smooth pudding: Always soak the bread in 
water, scald the milk, add other ingredients, and bake the 
pudding slowly. The bread must be soaked in water to 
produce lightness and delicacy. The milk is scalded be- 
cause scalded milk makes the pudding smoother than raw 
milk. 

The pudding is baked slowly in order that the eggs and 
milk will not curdle, as they might if baked in too hot an 
oven. The bread should be soaked in the cold water to 
cover for 20 minutes or more. Then press out all the 
water and crumble the bread into small pieces. Scald the 
milk and add salt, sugar, shortening, the well-beaten eggs 
and flavoring. Pour the mixture over the bread and stir 
well. Pour all into a well-greased pudding dish, and bake 
about 40 minutes in a slow oven for a medium sized pud- 
ding. If the dish containing the pudding is placed in a pan 
of hot water and baked, there will be less danger of too 
much heat. All custard mixtures are better baked in this 
manner. The mixture will appear thin, but will thicken 
sufficiently when baked. 

If a very thick pudding is desired more eggs may be 
added, or a teaspoon of cornstarch may be mixed to a thin 
paste with cold milk and added to the scalded milk. Use 
this quantity of cornstarch for each pint or two cups of 
milk. More bread will also thicken the pudding, but it 
will not be so delicate. 

All of these puddings may have a meringile added and 
in that case use only the yolks of the eggs in the foundation 
recipe, reserving the white for the meringue; or use 2 egg 
yolks and 1 whole egg for the pudding. After the pudding 
is baked spread with jelly or jam and then the meringue. 
A well-made meringue is light and adds much in appear- 
ance and taste to any dessert. But a poor, tough meringue 
is a waste of good material. 

For the bread pudding meringue use 2 egg whites, 4 
tablespoons of granulated sugar, j^ teaspoon of vanilla 
flavoring. Eggs should be beaten until the bowl can be 
inverted without fear of their slipping from it; then add 
sugar, 1 tablespoon at a time, beating well or until mix- 



MRS. DE GRAF'S COOK BOOK [273] 

ture will hold its shape. Flavor and spread over pudding 
and place on the top grate in a very moderate oven. The 
meringue should not begin to color for at least S minutes 
and will take 8 minutes to cook suiEciently and become a 
delicate brown. The meringue may be varied by adding 
1 tablespoon of ground chocolate. Powdered sugar never 
gives as satisfactory meringue as granulated sugar. 

Marshmallows may be used instead of the meringue. 
When the pudding is baked set 6 or 8 marshmallows on 
top, return to the top grate of the oven and cook until 
slightly melted and a golden brown. The plain bread 

fudding may be served with various pudding sauces, 
f individual puddings are liked, bake the bread pudding 
in custard cups or ramekins. 

Custard Bread Pudding 

1 thick slice of bread. 2 eggs. 

2 cups scalded milk. 1 teaspoon vanilla. 
J4 cup sugar. Grating of nutmeg. 

Soak bread in cold water to cover IS minutes, then 
press dry and measure 1 cupful. Beat eggs, add sugar, 
hot milk, bread crumbs and flavoring. Pour into a buttered 
baking dish, sprinkle with nutmeg. Set in a pan of hot 
water and bake in a moderate oven until firm. Or, omit 
1 egg for a meringue. When pudding is baked, spread 
with jelly or jam, add meringue and brown in a slow 
oven. Serve hot or cold. 

Cocoanut Bread Pudding 

Follow above recipe, using 1 cup of cocoanut in place 
of the raisins. 

Butterscotch Bread Pudding 

Butterscotch bread pudding is made by substituting 
brown sugar for the granulated sugar, using the custard 
bread pudding recipe. Place the brown sugar iii a sauce- 
pan, add the butter and cook until all the sugar is melted; 
then add the scalded milk and stir until dissolved. The 
brown sugar may cause the milk to curdle slightly, but 
when the pudding is baked this will disappear and the 
pudding will be smooth and fine in texture. 



[274] MRS. DE GRAF'S COOK BOOK 

Fruit Bread Pudding 

Fruit bread pudding is made by adding a cup of seed- 
less raisins and y^ teaspoon cinnamon to custard bread

Caramel Bread Pudding 

Make the custard bread pudding using 1 cupful of 
sugar instead of ^ of a cup. Take half of the sugar and 
cook in a saucepan over the fire until melted and a golden 
brown. This will require constant stirring. When cooked 
add the milk very slowly and cook until carameled sugar 
is dissolved; then follow the foundation recipe. 



Cliocolate Bread Pudding 

Chocolate bread pudding is made by adding 1 square 
of unsweetened chocolate to the milk, while it is heating 
or by using only yi cup of sugar and ^ cup of ground 
chocolate. Follow the custard bread pudding recipe.

vanilla and pour over the bread; cover and bake in a mod- 
erate oven about 20 minutes. Uncover and brown. Serve 
with a caramel sauce. 



[276] MRS. DE GRAF'S COOK BOOK 



Baked Apple 



A baked apple can be a real treat if properly cooked. 
For the best results in cooking select a rather sour apple 
not too ripe. If the apples are of fine flavor no other sea- 
soning is necessary, but if somewhat tasteless a small 
piece of stick cinnamon, a little freshly grated nutmeg, a 
few cloves, a slice of lemon or orange, any one of these 
flavorings may be used. A little butter adds greatly to 
any dish made of apples. 

Be sure the core has all been removed, for it is both un- 
pleasant and dangerous to get a piece of the tough core 
in the throat. 

Either granulated or brown sugar may be used to 
sweeten baked apples, each giving a diflferent flavor. For 
variety the fruit can be stuff'ed before baking with raisins 
and walnuts, prunes, mince meat or an uncooked custard. 
Or after baking the cores may be filled with jelly or orange 
marmalade. These are just a few suggestions for variety. 

Wash and core 6 apples. You can purchase an appliance 
which does this work quickly and well. After apples are 
cored, remove a portion of the skin, about }^ inch wide, 
from the center of the apple. Place in a pan with a cover 
or in a casserole, and pour over the fruit a syrup made of 
1 cup of boiling water and 1 cup of sugar boiled about S 
minutes. Cover tightly and bake in a moderate oven 
until apples are soft, but not broken. 

Twenty-five minutes is about the time required for bak- 
ing medium-sized apples. Remove cover, sprinkle apples 
generously with sugar and place on the top grate of the 
oven to glaze. Baste with the syrup several times and 
watch closely to prevent burning. When cooked lift each 
apple carefully to a serving dish and pour syrup around 
them. Chill before serving. 

If 1 or 2 apples are peeled, cored, sliced and placed 
around the apples while they are baking and then the 
syrup is strained through a fine sieve over the apples, a 
rich jelly should form which is even better than the apples. 
If desired, season with nutmeg, cloves and cinnamon. 

The apples can be served plain or with cream; filled in 



MRS. DE GRAF'S COOK BOOK [277] 

the manner suggested a meringue can be made of the 
white of one egg beaten very stiff, adding 2 tablespoons of 
sugar, beating again with a few drops of vanilla. Place a 
spoonful on each apple, return to a moderate Oven and 
bake about 10 minutes to a golden brown. 

Glazed Apples 

Remove the skin and core and cook partially over the 
fire in a syrup made of 1 cup of sugar and 1 cup of water 
for 6 apples. When apples are tender remove to a baking 
dish, dredge with sugar, pour the syrup around them and 
bake until glazed and a delicate brown. 

Ginger Apples 

Core and peel apples, allowing one for each service. 
For 6 apples make a syrup of 1 cup of sugar and 1 cup of 
water. Cook apples in syrup until tender, but not broken. 
Turn the apples while cooking and do not cover the dish, 
as the steam will cause them to break in pieces. When 
cooked, place apples, drained of syrup, in a buttered bak- 
ing dish, sprinkle generously with sugar and set in a mod- 
erate oven to glaze. In the meantime add yi cup of finely 
chopped preserved or crystallized ginger to the remaining 
syrup and cook about S minutes. When apples are glazed 
and slightly colored pour over the syrup. Serve hot or 
cold, with or without cream. 

Jellied Apples 

Pare and core as many apples as there are persons to 
serve. For six apples make a syrup of 1 cup of sugar and 
1 cup of water. Cook apples in the syrup very slowly, 
until they are tender, but not broken. While apples are 
cooking cut rounds of sponge cake a little larger than the 
apple. Any left-over plain cake may be used. Set a cooked 
apple on each slice of cake; add yi glass of jelly to the 
syrup the apples were cooked in; cook until melted, then 
pour over the apples. Cool and serve. This dish is at- 
tractive garnished with whipped cream, or may be served 
with plain cream if desired. 



[278] MRS. DE GRAF'S COOK BOOK 

Apple Sauce 

Peel, quarter and core apples. Slice and drop in cold 
water to prevent discoloration. Drain, place in a sauce- 
pan, cover with hot water and cook until tender. Add 
sugar to taste when apples are cooked and beat until 
smooth. The secret of a clear apple sauce is cooking with- 
out sugar. 

Glazed Apples With Raisins 

Core and peel apples. For 6 apples allow 1 cup of sugar, 
1 cup of water. Cook sugar and water about 5 minutes, 
then add apples and cook, turning often until apples are 
tender but not broken. Remove apples to a baking dish. 
Fill the centers with seeded raisins, adding 1 teaspoon of 
chopped walnuts to each apple. Dredge apples gener- 
ously with sugar and cook in a moderate oven until well 
glazed. Reduce the syrup the apples were cooked in and 
pour that around them. To be served from the baking 
dish hot or cold, with or without cream. If served cold a 
teaspoonful of jelly can be placed on top of each apple. 

Coddled Apples 

Wash and core apples. For 6 apples use 1 cup of sugar 
and IJ/^cups of water and a quarter section of orange peel. 

Cook water and sugar until sugar is dissolved, then add 
orange peel and apples. Cook slowly until apples are ten- 
der, but not broken. Turn frequently so apples will cook 
evenly. When cooked remove apples to a serving dish 
and boil down the syrup until thick, then pour over apples. 
Chill and serve with plain or whipped cream.

Gelatine 'Desserts 

With different flavors, fruits, colors and combina- 
tions, a great variety of attractive desserts can be 
made with gelatine. They are not difficult to prepare, 
although some of them appear quite complicated. 
There are a few principles to keep in mind when un- 
dertaking these dishes,, and when these are learned, 
even the most elaborate gelatine dessert will become a 
simple undertaking. Fruit-flavored jellies are the nnost 
popular, and usually form the foundation for the various 
combinations. Before preparing the dessert, soak the 
gelatine in cold water yi hour or more to soften it; then 
dissolve In hot water or the hot mixture. Do not boil the 
liquid after the gelatine has been added, or the jelly will 
be tough. Two tablespoons of granulated gelatine will 
stiffen 1 quart of liquid, if kept in a cool place. When 
fruit is added to the jelly, use less liquid or more gelatine. 
After the gelatine and sugar are dissolved, strain the mix- 
ture through a fine sieve or cheese cloth bag, and then 
turn into a wet mold to set 

In moderate weather the jelly will be firm, in from 4 to 
6 hours. The larger the proportion of gelatine to the 
liquid the sooner the liquid will become firm; but too 
much gelatine will give an unpleasant flavor and make 
the jelly tough. It is always wise to use the quantity of 
gelatine recommended by the manufacturer of the prod- 
uct. Directions for using are usually printed on the 
package. 

To mold fancy jellies, place the form in a bowl contain- 
ing cracked ice; have jelly cold, but not set. Pour in a 
layer of jelly, let set until firm, add fruit, nuts, etc., add 
another layer of jelly, allow that to become firm and con- 
tinue until all have been used; then set aside until ready 
to serve. To unmold, dip the form quickly into warm 
water (not hot), wipe perfectly dry, place a dish over 
the top of the mold and turn them over together. If the 
water is too warm the jelly will start to melt and destroy 
the appearance of the dessert. 

From a plain fruit jelly several very simple desserts 



MRS. DE GRAF'S COOK BOOK [283] 

may be prepared. A Russian jelly is made by simply 
beating the cold unset liquid of any of the fruit jelly 
foundations to a stiff froth with an egg-beater. When 
almost congealed, pour into wet molds and set aside to 
become thoroughly chilled. This form of jelly will be 
light and frothy throughout. Fruits or nuts may be 
added to the jelly after it has almost congealed, then 
mold and chill. Snow pudding is made by making the 
Russian jelly, adding for each quart of jelly the whites 
of 2 eggs. Pile in a serving dish and serve with cream or 
a custard sauce. 

Any of the plain fruit jellies or coffee jelly may be 
changed by using one of the methods just given.

Whipped Cream Desserts 

During the summer months cold desserts make a 
strong appeal to the busy housewife. Cream in com- 
bination with berries and other fresh fruits offer a wonder- 
ful variety. 

Desserts made of whipped cream and fruit are whole- 
some and very easily prepared. Cream is no more ex- 
pensive than other dessert materials and when one con- 
siders how quickly these dishes can be made, most of 
them requiring no cooking, and can be as plain or elaborate 
as one feels inclined, cream will not seem to be an extrava- 
gance. 

Whipped cream desserts should be light and frothy and 
with sufficient body to hold in shape for at least several 
hours. In order to whip easily cream should be 36 hours 
old and perfectly cold. Gelatine will keep whipped 
cream firm, and a small quantity is usually added for 
this purpose, although if the cream is properly whipped 
and chilled this should not be necessary. 

The average housekeeper does not always realize the 
possibilities of a small quantity of whipped cream, other- 
wise she would use it frequently. 

A plain and simple dessert may be transformed and 
made quite festive with a garnish or sauce of whipped 
cream, oesides being more palatable and wholesome. The 
various Charlottes and the Bavarian creams, where 
whipped cream forms the foundation, are usually enjoyed, 
and these desserts do not tax the digestion after a hearty 
meal, as will pastry or baked or steamed pudding. 

To whip cream successfully it must be thoroughly cold 
and may be easily beaten with a rotary egg-beater. 
Heavy or double cream is very quickly whipped and care 
should be taken not to beat it a moment too long, or the 
cream will turn to butter. Also bear in mind that if the 
cream has not been sufficiently chilled it may turn quickly 
to butter, which explains the oily, heavy whipped cream 
frequently seen. Thin cream may be whipped in the 
same manner, only it will take more beating and the bowl 
containing the cream should be set in a pan of very cold 



[288] MRS. DE GRAF'S COOK BOOK 

water; or, better still, cracked ice. Cream will double in 
bulk when properly whipped, and this should be taken 
into consideration when buying; also provide a bowl 
large enough to allow for this increase, otherwise the 
cream cannot be easily beaten. 

Results will be more satisfactory when sugar and flav- 
orings are added after cream has been whipped, these in- 
gredients being carefully folded into the cream with a 
spoon. 

An almost endless variety of desserts may be easily 
and quickly made using whipped cream as the founda- 
tion, or as a garnish or sauce. Charlotte russe and Bavar- 
ian creams are not difficult to make and are elaborate 
enough to use for any occasion. Mousses and parfaits 
require freezing, but as they are not turned during the 
process of freezing and do not require an ice cream freezer, 
they are not troublesome desserts to prepare. 

Fruit Bavarians 

Put sufficient canned or fresh fruit through a colander 
to make 2 cupfuls. Soak 2 tablespoons of granulated 
gelatine in ^ cup of cold water for 15 minutes, then set 
dish over hot water to slowly dissolve the gelatine. Add 
powdered sugar to fruit to taste, the amount will vary 
with different fruit; add dissolved gelatine to fruit and 
stir until well mixed and sugar is dissolved; then set bowl 
containing mixture in a pan of cold water and stir until 
it begins to thicken. Whip one cup of cream, carefully 
fold it into the fruit mixture, and turn into a mold which 
has been dipped into cold water. Set aside in a cool place 
to become firm. To serve turn out of mold and garnish 
with a sauce made of sweetened mashed fruit. 

Charlotte Russe 

A charlotte differs from a Bavarian cream in that it is 
made entirely of whipped cream with no fruit or liquid. 
Cover 1 tablespoon of granulated gelatine with yi cup of 
cold milk and soak about 15 minutes; whip 2 cups of 
cream, add ^ cup of powdered sugar and a teaspoon of 
vanilla; set the gelatine over hot water to dissolve, then 
add quickly to the whipped cream, stirring rapidly in 



MRS. DE GRAF'S COOK BOOK [289] 

order to have dissolved gelatine well mixed before it cools. 
This is most important, otherjsrise the gelatine will be in 
thick lumps and the mixture will not thicken. Stir the 
cream in a pan of cracked ice, or in a cool place until it 
begins to thicken. Place a row of split lady fingers around 
the side of the mold, leaving the bottom of the mold un- 
covered; then pour in enough of the cream mixture to 
cover the lady fingers; add another row of lady fingers and 
then the cream, repeating until the mold is filled. By this 
method the lady fingers may easily be kept in place. Set 
aside to thoroughly chill. When ready to serve turn onto 
a serving plate. If you are the possessor of a pastry bag 
the charlotte may be made very attractive by garnishing 
with whipped cream forced through the bag, using a star 
tube. Mocha Charlotte Russe is made by adding 1 table- 
spoon of coffee extract to the whipped cream and using 
coffee instead of milk to dissolve the gelatine. 

Chocolate charlotte russe is made in the same way, 
using 2 squares of unsweetened chocolate, melted over 
hot water, or 3^ cup ground chocolate added to the 
whipped cream. Fruit charlottes are made by molding 
the plain charlotte in a border mold. When ready to serve 
turn out and fill the center with fruit. 



Marshmallow Strawberry Pudding 

1 cup hulled strawberries cut 1 cup cream whipped. 

in halves. Ji cup sugar. 

14 cup marshmallows cut fine. 1 teaspoon vanilla extract. 

Cream should be beaten very stiff, adding vanilla and 
sugar. Fold in strawberries and marshmallows. Fill 
sherbet cups or tall glasses with mixture, garnish with 
whole berries and serve very cold. 



Cream Whips 

Whip cream, sweeten and flavor with vanilla; put a 
generous tablespoon of any preserve, or crushed sweetened 
fresh fruit in sherbet cups or tall glasses; pile the whipped 
cream lightly on top and sprinkle with chopped nuts. 



[290] MRS. DE GRAF'S COOK BOOK 

Molded Fruit Cream 

Peel 4 bananas, mash and rub through a sieve; add the 
juice of 1 orange and a little of the grated rind, 1 table- 
spoon lemon juice and enough powdered sugar to sweeten. 

Soak 1 tablespoon of granulated gelatine in yi cup of 
cold water about 15 minutes; then dissolve over hot 
water. Add to the fruit mixture, stirring rapidly. Set 
bowl containing mixture in a pan of cold water or cracked 
ice and stir until mixture begins to thicken. Whip 1 cup 
of cream and fold into the mixture; pour into individual 
molds and set aside to become firm. 



Rice Dainty 

IJ^ cups cooked rice. J^ cup powdered sugar. 

1 cup grated pineapple. 1 cup whipping cream.

slices of sponge cake. Whip 1 cup of whipping cream; 
add 2 tablespoons (level) of powdered sugar and 1 tea- 
spoonful of vanilla. Line sides and bottom of cake-lined 
dish with whipped cream, place cooked or fresh sweetened 
fruit in the center, then cover with whipped cream. 
Sufficient for 3 persons. 

Raisin Charlotte Russe 

Soak seedless raisins in orange juice for several hours, 
then drain off all juice. Allow 1 cup of raisins to 1 pint of 
cream. Whip cream and flavor with 1 teaspoon vanilla 
extract; add 4 tablespoons powdered sugar and the rais- 
ins. Line sherbet glasses with split lady fingers or thin 
slices of sponge cake and put the charlotte russe in the 
center. Garnish the top with raisins. 



MRS. DE GRAF'S COOK BOOK [291]

with a whip egg beater'until the consistency of whipped 
cream. This will take about IS minutes. Fold in the 
whipped cream last. Chill and serve in sherbet glasses 
with sponge cake. Other fruits may replace strawberries. 

Marshmallow Creana 

Whip 1 cupful of cream, adding 2 tablespoons of sugar; 
fold into this y^ cup of chopped nuts, any kind but pea 
nuts; 1 cup of canned pineapple out in cubes and drained 
from the juice, 1 cup of marshm allows cut fine; mix well 
until all is a creamy mass; other fruits may be substituted 
for the pineapple. Serve in sherbet cups.

Frozen Desserts 

At any season of the year frozen desserts are accept- 
able. Most housewives depend upon the confectioner 
to supply their ices and ice creams, although it is quite 
a simple matter to prepare them at home. The trouble 
of making them is no greater than that of making any 
dessert equally as attractive and palatable; and the 
question of expense is small as compared with the 
prices charged by the best caterers, and no more than 
any dish requiring the same amount of eggs, milk or 
cream. 

For example, a plain ice cream is a frozen custard or 
just plain table cream sweetened, flavored and frozen. 
With a good ice cream freezer, either ice cream or water 
ice may be made quickly, and has the advantage over 
hot desserts in that they require no attention at dinner 
time. Parfaits and mousses require no stirring while 
freezing, and this class of frozen cream is one of the best 
of the frozen desserts. 

Ice creams and water ices may be classified as follows; 
Philadelphia ice cream is a thin cream, sweetened, flav- 
ored and frozen; French ice creams are custards of different 
degrees of richness frozen; Parfaits and Mousses are 
whipped cream, with or without eggs, and frozen without 
stirring; Water Ices are frozen fruits juices, sweetened with 
a sugar syrup, with a little gelatine added to give body to 
the ice and to keep it from melting when served. Sherbet 
is a water ice with beaten white of egg added to the mix- 
ture; frozen punches are water ices with liquor mixed 
with them before or after they are frozen. 

Unless the cream is to be whipped it should be scalded, 
otheiTvise the frozen cream will have a raw taste. The 
scalding should be done in a double boiler and simply 
allow the cream to heat through; if it is boiled or cooked 
too long the cream will not increase in quantity when 
frozen. 

All frozen mixtures increase in bulk during freezing, so 
never fill the can over two-thirds full. It is an economy 
of time and ice to chill the mixture before freezing. The 



MRS. DE GRAF'S COOK BOOK [293] 

texture of ices is much better when not frozen too quickly. 
One measure of rock salt to three measures of finely 
crushed ice are the proportions to use for mixtures to be 
stirred while freezing. The ice should be pounded in a 
coarse sack and should be almost as fine as the salt for 
the freezing process; but for packing, the water should all 
be drained off and the ice broken in small lumps which 
will not melt quickly, and very little salt is required. Too 
much salt will cause the mixture to thicken too quickly 
and the cream will be coarse and granular. Do not draw 
off the salt water until cream is frozen. 

Creams and ices ripen or become blended by standing, 
so they should be made some time before serving. Water 
ices are the simplest form of frozen desserts. They are 
inexpensive, and are easily made. The sugar and water 
should always be boiled to a thick syrup, otherwise the 
ice will have a raw taste and a coarse texture. 

Mousses are made of whipped cream, flavored and 
sweetened, then poured into a closely covered mold and 
packed in finely cracked ice and coarse rock salt, and 
left to ripen 3 hours or more. Fruit drained of all juice 
may be added to the cream before freezing. 

These make very attractive desserts and can be pre- 
pared early in the day and packed in ice and allowed to 
stand. The pail or utensil containing the mold should 
be drained of water several times and the melted ice 
replaced with fresh cracked ice. 

The accompanying recipes are all the housewife will 
require for water ice or ice cream. The amounts may be 
increased and different ingredients used, but the founda- 
tion principles will remain the same. 

Frozen Custard or French Ice Cream 

2 cups scalded milk. 2 eggs. 

% cup sugar. H teaspoon salt. 

1 teaspoon com starch. 2 teaspoons vanilla. 

Mix sugar, salt and corn starch; add to beaten eggs. 
Pour hot milk over mixture. Put in a double boiler and 
stir constantly until mixture becomes thick enough to 
coat a spoon. Cool, flavor and freeze. 1 cup of thin 
cream may be added to the chilled custard before freezing. 



1294J MRS. DE GRAF'S COOK BOOK 

The yolks of eggs only may be used in the custard, and 
when cool the stiffly beaten whites may be added. To 
this foundation different flavorings or chopped nuts may 
be used. 

Fruit Ice Cream 

Crush 2 cups of berries and press through a puree 
strainer or sieve. Prepare the custard and when cool add 
the fruit, additional sugar if needed, and the cream 
whipped or plain, and freeze. 

Philadelphia Ice Cream 

4 cups or 1 quart of thin cream. 1 tablespoon vanilla. 
1 cup sugar. 

The cream should not be too thick or it may form fine 
particles of butter while being stirred. Scald the cream 
and add the sugar. When cool add flavoring and freeze. 
Pack and let ripen for an hour or more. 

Bisque Ice Cream 

Add 1^2 cups of macaroon crumbs, rolled very fine, to 
the Philadelphia ice cream just before freezing. Pack and 
allow to ripen. 

Chocolate Ice Cream 

Add }/2 cup of ground chocolate to the sugar of either 
custard or Philadelphia ice cream. 

Frozen Pudding 

Shred \}4 cups mixed candied fruit and soak in orange 
juice for an hour. Freeze Philadelphia ice cream until it 
begins to thicken, add fruit, then finish freezing. Pack 
and allow to ripen an hour or more. 

Fruit Mousses 

Whip 1 pint or 2 cups of cream; add 1 cup of any fruit 
pulp free from juice, and add powdered sugar to taste. 
Pour into a mold, cover with clean paper, adjust cover 
and pack in equal parts of crushed ice and salt. Let stand 
3 hours to ripen. Unmold to serve. 



MRS. DE GRAF'S COOK BOOK [295] 

Water Ice 

1 quart or 4 cups of water. 4 tablespoons cold water. 

2 cups sugar. 2 cups fruit juice. 
1 teaspoon gelatine. Juice of lemon. 

Boil water and sugar about IS minutes. Soak gelatine 
in cold water until soft, add to the hot syrup and cool; 
then add fruit and lemon juice and freeze. To obtain the 
fruit juice or crushed fruit mash the fruit and squeeze 
through a cheese cloth, or press through a puree strainer. 
Any fruit or fruit juice may be used. Pack and allow to 
ripen 2 hours or more. 

Sherbet 

Add 2 stiffly beaten egg whites to the water ice formula 
when partly frozen. When frozen pack and allow to ripen 
at least 2 hours. Crushed fruit makes the best sherbet. 



Maple Mousse 

1 cup maple syrup. 2 cups cream, whipped. 

4 egg yolks. 

Beat yolks until light and lemon colored; heat the syrup 
and pour over the beaten yolks. Return mixture to sauce- 
pan and cook, stirring constantly until thick. Cool the 
mixture and beat until creamy. When cold carefully fold 
in the whipped cream. Fill mold, cover, pack in equal 
parts of salt and ice and let stand at least 2 hours, while 
longer would be better. 

Biscuit Tortoni 

1 cup sugar. 1 tablespoon orange extract. 

)/i cup boiling water. 2 cups double cream, whipped. 

3 egg yolks. 1 cup macaroon crumbs. 

Boil sugar and water until soft-ball stage is reached. 
Pour slowly over the beaten yolks. Return to fire and 
cook over hot water until mixture is somewhat thick- 
ened; beat until cold, flavor and fold in the whipped 
cream. Add crumbs and pack in a mold. Pack mold in 
3 parts ice to 1 of salt and let stand 2 or 3 hours to freeze.

Pineapple Parfait 

1 cup pineapple juice. 1 cup grated pineapple. 

^ cup sugar. 1 teaspoon pistachio flavoring. 

2 egg whites. 1 cup cream, whipped. 

Boil the sugar and pineapple juice about 10 minutes 
Pour slowly over the well-beaten egg whites, using an 
egg-beater. Beat until cold, add the fruit, flavoring, and 
fold in the whipped cream. Turn into a mold, cover with 
paper and adjust cover. Pack in equal measures of salt 
and crushed ice and let stand at least 3 hours. This cream 
needs no stirring. The grated pineapple is used and the 
juice obtained by draining the fruit. The flavoring may 
be omitted.

CANNING OF VEGETABLES AND FRUIT BY THE 

COLD PACK METHOD 

PICKLES AND RELISHES 



[298] MRS. DE GRAF'S COOK BOOK 



Jellies and Jams 




|n securing fruits for making jelly, always procure 
those which are somewhat under-ripe. The jelly- 
making quality in fruit is known as pectin and is 
present when the fruit is either ripe or just turning 
ripe. If the fruit is over-ripe the pectin disappears, and it 
will be impossible to make satisfactory jelly. This pectin 
is somewhat like gelatine, as it dissolves in boiling liquid 
and stiffens upon cooling. The fruits best suited for jelly 
making are currants, plums, quinces, crabapples, grapes 
and apples. These fruits will make a perfect jelly if not 
used over-ripe. Fruits in which pectin is lacking must be 
combined with those rich in this jelly-making quality. 
The novice in housekeeping usually shrinks from jelly 
making, but if rules are carefully studied and only a small 
quantity attempted at one time the process will be found 
very simple and the results satisfactory. 

The addition of sugar to cooked fruit increases the nu- 
tritive value, and the cooking of the sugar at a high tem- 
perature, combined with the acid of the fruit, causes the 
inversion of the sugar, which is the first step in its diges- 
tion. For this reason jellies, jams and marmalades are 
considered one of the most wholesome forms in which to 
eat sugar. Children crave sweets and this desire may be 
gratified in wholesome jellies, jams and marmalades. Un- 
less combined with sugar, the actual food value of fruit 
is low; but the acids and salts it contains are most im- 
portant. They are needed to keep the blood pure. There 
IS nothing more wholesome for children and no food the 
average child enjoys more than bread and jelly or mar- 
malade. 

A good jelly should be bright in color, and clear. When 
removed from the glass it should retain the shape of the 
mold and be tender enough to quiver without breaking. 

When making currant jelly use from 2 to 4 quarts of 
fruit for 1 utensil. A great quantity takes too long to 
bring to the right heat and both the color and flavor of 
the jelly will be impaired. Wash fruit well, remove stems 
and discard all that is imperfect. With watery fruits. 



MRS. DE GRAF'S COOK BOOK [299] 

such as grapes and currants, use no water. Cut hard 
fruits into small pieces and use about 3 cups of water to 
each pound of fruit. Cook the fruit slowly until the juice 
begins to flow, then crush with a wooden potato masher. 
As soon as the fruit is tender remove from the fire and 
pour into a jelly bag to drain. A pointed three-cornered 
bag is best, as it lets the juice drain from the corner with 
the pressure of the bulk of the fruit on the small end. 
Hang the bag so the juice may drip. When nearly all the 
juice has been strained through the bag may be squeezed. 
This last juice which has been squeezed through the jelly 
bag should be kept by itself as the jelly made from this 
juice will not be as clear as that which has been allowed 
to drip. If the fruit is overcooked it will produce a cloudy 

j^l^y- . . or 

Measure the juice, and for each cup allow ^ cup of 
sugar. The sugar should be placed on shallow pans and 
warmed slightly in the oven. Reheat the fruit juice, and 
when it reaches the boiling paint add the sugar imme- 
diately. Cook rapidly about 5 minutes, removing scum as 
it appears. Long cooking will darken the jelly and tends 
to destroy the pectin, which will cause the finished prod- 
uct to be less firm. 

To determine when the jelly has cooked sufficiently, 
drop a teaspoon of the syrup on a cold plate. If the jelly 
stage is reached the syrup will thicken slightly in a few 
seconds. Remove from the fire at once and pour into hot 
sterilized jelly glasses and set aside to cool. Cool as 
rapidly as possible to avoid dust, which will cause mould. 
When cold pour melted paraffine over the top, cover, 
store in a cool, dark, dry place. 

Jelly deteriorates in color, texture and flavor if stored 
for a long period. When jelly is soft and syrupy, too much 
sugar has been used, or the syrup has not been cooked 
long enough after sugar was added. If tough or stringy, 
too little sugar has been used or the syrup was boiled 
after the jelly stage had been reached. 

The cleaner the fruit — that is, of stems or leaves, the 
brighter and clearer the jelly will be. Prepare glasses be- 
fore making the jelly. After washing well, place glasses 
in a pan of cold water, set over the fire and when boiling 



[300] MRS. DE GRAF'S COOK BOOK 

point is reached allow to boil 15 minutes. Just before 
filling glasses with the boiling syrup set them upright in 
a pan of hot water, placing a thick pad of cloth in the 
bottom of the pan. This method of handling glasses will 
prevent breakage. 

Strawberries need a heavier syrup for canning than 
other fruits, and while it is a little more expensive to 
make jam or preserves the process is simpler and for this 
particular fruit much more satisfactory. The berry sea- 
son is long in California but the berries are at their best 
in June and should be used for canning or preserving then. 
The old-fashioned method of making preserves and jams 
called for equal weights or measurements of sugar and 
fruit. But science has discovered that an equally satis- 
factory preserve can be made with only three-fourths as 
much sugar as fruit. The fruit is kept whole for preserves 
and is broken or mashed for jams. 

Either method may be used. Select only sound, ripe 
fruit for preserving; use fine granulated sugar; measure 
the ingredients accurately; sterilize containers and covers, 
and, most important of all, preserve a small quantity at a 
time. Pick over fruit carefully, wash and measure. Any 
imperfect fruit (bruised, but not in any way spoiled) may 
be crushed and strained through a jelly bag and used for 
making the syrup. Allow one-half as much water, or 
juice and water, as you have berries. Use three-fourths 
cup of sugar for each cup of berries. 

Boil the sugar and liquid 5 minutes after boiling begins. 
Skim, then add berries, a small quantity at a time and 
cook gently under the boiling point until fruit can be 
pierced with a fork. The berries will be somewhat trans- 
parent. Lift out with a skimmer or perforated spoon and 
put into the sterilized jars or glasses; add more fruit and 
repeat until all have been cooked. If much juice has 
drained from the fruit in the jars pour this back in the 
kettle and boil all the juice do\vn about 5 minutes, then 
pour over the berries and set aside to cool. Do not cover 
or seal until cold. If fruit is sealed while hot the juice 
will be less thick. 

Less perfect fruit may be used for jam than for pre- 
serves. Of course, care should be taken to exclude all 



MRS. DE GRAF'S COOK BOOK [301] 

decayed portions, but the over-ripe and somewhat bruised 
berries need not be discarded when preparing jam. The 
fruit should be carefully picked over and well washed. 

Combinations of fruits make palatable jams or con- 
serves and sometimes chopped nuts are added. 

The labor given to the preparation of jams or preserves 
is amply repaid in the appreciaton of the family. Jam is 
certainly a treat for breakfast with hot biscuits or rolls; 
for dinner as a relish with meat or for supper with hot 
buttered toast, not to mention the "between-meal" bread 
and jam for the children after school. The rules govern- 
ing the making of strawberry preserves and jam may be 
applied to all other fruits. 

Currant or Loganberry Jelly 

Pick over currants, stem and wash, discarding all the 
imperfect fruit. Place in a preserving kettle, crushing 
slightly. Cook slowly until currants are tender. Pour 
into the jelly bag and strain. Measure juice and reheat. 
When boiling point is reached add heated sugar, three- 
fourths cup to each cup of juice and cook rapidly about 5 
minutes, when the syrup may be tested by dropping a 
spoonful on a cold plate. If the jelly stage is reached, re- 
move from the fire at once and pour into hot jelly glasses. 
Cool, pour melted paraffine over the top, cover and store 
in a cool, dry place. 

Grape Jelly 

Select under-ripe fruit,, remove the grapes from the 
stems, wash and put in a preserving kettle over a slow fire 
and allow to simmer until the fruit is tender; then pour 
into a bag and drain olF all the juice. For each cup of juice 
allow ^ cups of sugar. Heat sugar in the oven. Bring 
grape juice to the boiling point, then add heated sugar and 
let boil until a little of the syrup will jelly when dropped on 
a cold plate. Pour into hot glasses and cool; pour melted 
paraffine over the top, cover and store in a cool, dry place. 

Currant and Raspberry Jelly 

Use two-thirds currants to one-third raspberries and 
proceed as for currant jelly. 



[302] MRS. DE GRAF'S COOK BOOK 

Apple Jelly 

Wipe apples, remove stems and blossoms and cut in 
quarters. Put in a preserving kettle, cover the fruit with 
cold water and cook slowly until the fruit is soft. Pour 
into a jelly bag and drain. Measure juice and allow to 
boil about 20 minutes; then add the heated sugar, allow- 
ing three-fourths cup to each cup of juice; then boil about 
5 minutes. Skim before and after adding sugar. Test and 
pour into hot jelly glasses. Apples may be combined with 
fruits which lack pectin making a satisfactory jelly. 

Apple Mint Jelly 

Follow apple jelly formula, adding a few leaves of mint 
to the apples while cooking. 

Cranbeny Jelly 

One quart of cranberries, 2 cups of hot water. Put in 
a kettle, cover and cook 10 minutes. Remove cover, add 
2 cups sugar and cook 10 minutes longer. Each berry 
should be whole when cold and embedded in jelly. 

Crabapple Jelly 

Wash and stem the fruit, and, if rather large, cut in 
halves. Cover with boiling water and cook until tender. 
Pour into jelly bag and drain. Measure juice and su^ar, 
allowing three-fourths cup of sugar to each cup of juice. 
Bring juice to the boiling point, add sugar; boil until 
syrup jellies. Pour into hot glasses; cool, and then pour 
melted paraffine over the top. Cover and store. 

Plum Jelly 

Select under-ripe jjlums; wash and cover with boiling 
water and cook until tender; pour into jelly bag and 
drain. Use equal measure of sugar and juice, finishing as 
for other jellies. 

Rhubarb Jam 

Cut off ends and remove strings of skin, but do not 
completely peel the fruit. Cut in inch slices, measure and 
cover with an- equal quantity of sugar. Let stand several 



MRS. DE GRAF'S COOK BOOK [303] 

hours; then cook about 30 minutes after the boiling point 
is reached; then allow to simmer gently for 30 minutes 
more. For each 5 pounds of fruit add the grated rind and 
juice of a lemon and X pound of blanched sliced almonds. 

Sunshine Strawberries 

Put into the preserving kettle, in layers, as many 
pounds of sugar as hulled, washed and drained straw- 
berries. When the juice is drawn out a little set over the 
fire to cook 20 minutes after boiling point is reached. Turn 
the berries into agate pans or earthenware plates, cover 
with panes of glass and set in the sun. Let stand 2 days, 
stirring 2 or 3 times each day. Store without reheating in 
jars or glasses. The time of cooking may be cut down to 
10 minutes if the fruit is to be left in the sun a day or two 
longer. 

Strawberry Jam 

Wash and hull berries; allow ^ pound of sugar for each 
pound of hulled berries. Place berries in a kettle and 
mash. Place over a slow fire and cook slowly, stirring and 
mashing fruit until it is thoroughly cooked. Then add 
sugar and cook very slowly until mixture is thick. Watch 
carefully and stir frequently to avoid burning. An 
asbestos mat under the kettle will lessen the chance of 
burning. It is never advisable to make a quantity of jam 
at any one time. Even if you have a quantity of berries 
needing immediate attention it will be found much easier 
to make the jam in small amounts. Several small kettles 
of fruit can be cooked at once more quickly and with 
much better results than cooked in one large utensil. 

Strawberry Conserve 

Use equal quantities each of pineapple, strawberries 
and rhubarb. The pineapple is peeled, then sliced, then 
cut in small cubes; rhubarb is cut in small pieces without 
peeling. Place pineapple and rhubarb over a very slow 
fire without any water being added and cook slowly until 
the fruit is tender. Add strawberries, cook slowly, stirring 
and mashing frequently. When berries are cooked add 
the sugar, using three-fourths as much sugar as fruit. 



[304] MRS. DE GRAF'S COOK BOOK 

Cook until thick. If desired a half cup of blanched shred- 
ded almonds may be added for each quart of conserve. 
Pour into sterilized glasses or jars and cool before sealing. 

Plum Butter 

Use plum pulp left after draining juice for jelly. Put 
through a coarse strainer. Use one-half as much sugar as 
plum pulp and simmer until sugar is dissolved. 

Fig Jam 

Blanch figs and remove peel. Cut in half. Add three- 
quarter measure of sugar for each measure of fruit. Sim- 
mer gently until thick. A little lemon juice can be added 
for flavor. 

Gooseberry Jam 

Stem and wash gooseberries. Mash and cook very 
slowly until fruit is tender. Add equal parts sugar and 
fruit and simmer until thick. This fruit contains so much 
acid that the additional sugar is required. 

Peach Marmalade 

Dip fruit in hot water for 2 or 3 minutes; dip in cold 
water, remove at once and take off peel and remove pit. 
Chop or slice very fine. Add three-quarters as much 
sugar as fruit and cook very slowly until thick. Seal in 
sterilized jars. 

Bar le Due Currants 

Use only large, firm fruit. Weigh and use an equal 
weight of strained honey. Heat honey, add fruit, let 
simmer very slowly about 5 minutes, remove the fruit 
with a skimmer, then cook down the syrup until thick. 
Pour it over the fruit and store in glasses as you would 
jelly. 

Apple Marmalade 

Wash apples, guarter, but retain skin and cores. Add 
a very little boiling water, just enough to prevent burn- 
ing. Cover and cook, stirring frequently, until soft. 
Press through a colander or a puree strainer. For every 



MRS. DE GRAF'S COOK BOOK [305] 

cup of pulp add three-quarters cup of sugar and the juice 
and grated rind of 1 lemon. Let cook over a slow fire 
until somewhat thickened. Remember that marmalade 
thickens considerably upon cooking. 

Raisin and Apple Conserve 

4 cups chopped apples. 1}4 cups seeded raisins. 

1 lemon sliced very thin. % cup chopped walnuts. 

3 cups sugar. 

Mix apples, raisins and lemon and heat to the boiling 
point. Add sugar and cook until thick — about ^ hour. 
Remove from the fire, add chopped nuts, pour into hot 
sterilized glasses and seal as for jelly. 

Golden Marmalade 

(Slightly Bitter) 

1 grapefruit. 10 cups cold water. 

2 oranges. 10 cups sugar. 
1 lemon. 

Wash and dry fruit; cut into quarters without peeling 
then cut quarters in very thin slices. This will take a 
sharp knife. Discard all seeds. Cover fruit with water 
and let stand over night. In the morning bring slowly to 
the simmering point and cook until fruit is tender, at 
least 4 hours, longer if necessary. Let stand over night 
again then reheat, add sugar and cook, stirring frequently 
until when a spoonful is tested on a cold dish it forms a 
jelly. Pour in sterilized glasses, cool and cover as for 
jelly. 

Orange Marmalade 

Wash and dry fruit. Cut into quarters without peeling, 
then cut each quarter into the thinnest of slices. Allow 1 
lemon to 6 oranges. Discard all seeds for they will make 
the marmalade bitter. For each cup of fruit allow 3 cups 
of cold water. Let stand over night then heat slowly to 
the simmering point and cook until the rind is tender, 
from 4 to 6 hours. If the rind is not tender the marmalade 
will not be satisfactory. Let stand over night a second 
time, reheat and when boiling add the sugar; allow equal 



[306] MRS. DE GRAF'S COOK BOOK 

measures of fruit and sugar. Cook rapidly until the mix- 
ture jellies when tested on a cold dish. , If a sugar ther- 
mometer is used the mixture should be about 218 degrees F. 

Pineapple and Orange Marmalade 

1 pineapple. 1 lemon. 

6 oranges. 

Wash and dry oranges and lemon; cut into quarters 
without removing peel. Cut each quarter into very thin 
slices, discarding all seeds. Peel and remove "eyes" from 
the pineapple. Shred fruit from the core with a silver 
fork. Measure the fruit, allowing 3 cups of cold water 
for each cup of fruit. Let stand over night then bring 
slowly to the simmering point and cook until the orange 
rind is tender, 4 to 6 hours. Let stand oyer night again, 
then measure. Reheat and when boiling point is reached 
add the sugar, allowing an equal quantity. Let cook 
until the mixture thickens when tested on a cold dish.

Canning Vegetables by the Cold Pack 
Method 

The canning of vegetables is not a complica,ted process. 
There are certain essentials for successful canning, and 
if these are carefully observed there is small chance for 
failure. Perfect sterilization is the secret of success. All 
ingredients should be clean and fresh, and all the utensils 
used should be sterilized; that is free from all mold or 
germs which cause or promote decay. To secure immunity 
from germs it is necessary to thoroughly scald and boil all 
containers, covers, rubbers, funnels, dippers, spoons and 
kettles, in fact everything which is used during the pro- 
cess. 

The materials to be canned must be carefully picked 
over and thoroughly washed. An accumulation of dust, 
mold or decayed portions on the ingredients to be canned 
even if slight, will affect the result. These essentials are 
necessary, no matter what method of canning is used, 
whether by the old-fashioned open-kettle method or by 
the more modern cold-pack process. 

There are three kinds of plant life which cause foods 
to spoil, mold, yeasts and bacteria, and these organisms 
are floating everywhere in the air. To preserve food it 
must be put into a condition which is free from all organ- 
ism and be put where these germs can not reach it. Molds 
are the only visible plant life and thrive in dampness and 
darkness. They grow more frequently where acid is 
present, so are more often found on tomatoes or fruits. 
The invisible spores causing molds are in the air every- 
where and develop upon foods which are left exposed. 
Moist heat will kill molds, so the method of sterilizing 
food in jars or cans and sealing at once prevents trouble 
with mold. Yeast is abundant in the air and on the sur- 
face of fruit and vegetables. When canned food ferments, 
yeast is present. Moist heat at the simmering point will 
usually kill all yeasts. 

Bacteria are not so easily destroyed as molds and 
yeasts and can only be killed by subjecting them to a 



[308] MRS. DE GRAF'S COOK BOOK 

moist heat at the boiling point for different lengths of 
time. Experience has proved that when the vegetables 
are sterilized until thoroughly cooked they are usually 
ready to seal and all organisms killed. Very little loss has 
followed this rule where the vegetables were in good con- 
dition and not withered or old. Only young, tender, 
fresh vegetables can be successfully canned. 

For the cold pack method of canning the food is cooked 
in the jars until sterilized. This is called processing. 
When processing is complete the jars or containers must 
be sealed immediately to prevent the entrance of germs. 
Vegetables require a much longer, period of sterilization 
than fruits. The cold-pack method requires five pro- 
cesses: Scalding or blanching, cold dipping, packing in 
jars, sterilizing and sealing. 

Scalding or blanching consists of plunging the fruit or 
vegetables into boiling water for a short time. The in- 
gredients should be placed in a wire basket or a square of 
cheese cloth. This process gives the food a more thorough 
cleansing; makes peeling, when necessary, an easy matter; 
improves the texture and produces a clearer liquid. Be- 
sides all this it shrinks either fruits or vegetables, making 
them more flexible and much easier to pack solid in the 
jars. The length of time for blanching depends upon the 
age of the food. 

Cold dipping is placing the vegetable for an instant 
only into cold water. This makes the food crisp and 
further aids in shrinkage; also preserves color and flavor. 

The food is then packed as closely as possible in the 
sterilized jars. Cover the vegetables (except tomatoes) 
to overflowing with boiling water and allow a teaspoon of 
salt to each quart jar of vegetables. 

Cleanse rubbers by standing for a minute in boiling 
water, allowing 1 teaspoon soda for each quart of water. 
Adjust rubber, then screw top partially on jar. If using 
a glass top jar with wire clamp place the cover on and 
raise both clamps. The upper one will hold the top in 
, place. Place the jars on a rack in a boiler or deep kettle. 
Have water about the temperature of the jars and fill 
boiler to about 2 inches of the tops of the jars. Cover 
the boiler to keep in the steam and count the time for 



MRS. DE GRAF'S COOK BOOK [309] 

processing from the time the water begins to boil and 
keep constantly at the boiling point the required length 
of time. 

At the end of this time lift jars from the water, tighten 
the covers securely at once. Return to the hot water, this 
time completely submerging them for 10 minutes. Lift 
from the water, tighten covers again and cool, avoiding a 
draft which might cause the jars to crack. Inverting the 
jars will be a final test as to whether there is a possible 
leak. 

Store in a cool, dry, dark place. Tomatoes, peas, lima 
beans and corn are greatly improved by adding a teaspoon 
of sugar to each pint of vegetables, adding the sugar and 
salt at the same time. 

Rubber rings should be new each season. To open a 
jar of food easily, immerse the cover in warm water and 
gradually add boiling water, letting jars stand a few min- 
utes; then remove and cover can easily be removed. 

In the following recipes no definite period is given for 
sterilizing the vegetables. When cooked through, or 
suitable for serving, they are ready to seal, or the food 
may be tested to see if it is cooked. Be sure this jar is 
filled to overflowing with boiling water before resealing. 
The time for processing depends upon the age of the 
product, and time tables usually apply to fresh, tender 
products. 

The following table may be used as a guide: 

Vegetables Blanching Cooking 

Asparagus S to 10 min 2 hours 

Peas 8 minutes 3 hours 

String Beans 8 minutes 2 hours 

Lima Beans S to 10 min 3 hours 

Beets 5 to 10 min 2 hours 

Corn 5 to 10 min 4 hours 

Peppers S to 10 min 2 hours 

Tomatoes \}4 minutes 20 min. 

String Beans 

Remove the stems and strings from tender fresh beans; 
cut in two if desired. Blanch from S to 8 minutes, or until 



[310] MRS. DE GRAF'S COOK BOOK 

the pod will bend without breaking; then plunge in cold 
water for an instant. Drain, pack quickly into a jar, add 
salt and cover to overflowing with boiling water; adjust 
rubbers and covers. Place jars on racks in boiler, cover 
to within one inch of top with warm water; cover boiler, 
and when water reaches the boiling point sterilize about 
1}4 hours, keeping water continuously boiling. This 
recipe also applies to wax beans and green lima beans. 
When cooked remove and adjust covers. 

Asparagus 

Asparagus for canning must be fresh. Wash, cut the 
proper length for jars, scrape off tough outer skin and tie 
in bundles. Blanch by immersing the lower ends in boil- 
ing water for 3 minutes; then lower all and blanch 1 to 2 
minutes longer. Plunge into cold water, then pack in 
jars. Add salt, fill to overflowing with boiling water; 
place on rack in boiler and cover to 1 inch of top with 
warm water. Cover boiler, and when water boils cook 
about 1^ hours, keeping water constantly boiling. Re- 
move from boiler and adjust covers. 

Peas 

Peas should be canned as soon as shelled. Blanch from 
1 to 4 minutes, in boiling water. Dip in cold water for an 
instant, adding 1 teaspoon of salt to each quart of water. 
Drain and pack to }4 inch of top of jar, add 1 teaspoon 
each of sugar and salt for each pint jar, cover with boiling 
water, and adjust rubbers and covers. Place on rack in 
boiler, cover with warm water to within 1 inch of top. 
Cover boiler, bring to boiling point and cook about l}4 
hours or until tender. Remove from boiler and adjust 
covers. 

Tomatoes 

Select firm tomatoes of uniform size. Blanch for 1 min- 
ute, dip into cold water and remove skins quickly and 
pack closely into jars. Add salt, and fill jars with hot 
strained tomatoes. Adjust rubbers and covers, place in 
boiler, cover with warm water to within 1 inch of the top 
of jars. Cover boiler and when boiling point is reached 



MRS. DE GRAF'S COOK BOOK [311] 

cook about IS minutes. Remove from boiler and adjust 
covers. 

Lima Beans 

Lima beans should be canned as soon as shelled. Blanch 
from 1 to 4 minutes, depending on the age of the beans. 
Dip in cold water for an instant, adding a teaspoon of 
salt to each quart of cold water. Drain and pack beans 
to within ^ inch of the top of jar; add salt, cover to over- 
flowing with boiling water. Adjust rubbers and covers; 
place in boiler; cover to within an inch of top of jars with 
warm water; cover boiler and when boiling point is 
reached cook about an hour or until tender. One jar may 
be tested, then put back and sterilized before sealing. 
When cooked, remove and adjust covers. 



[312] MRS. DE GRAF'S COOK BOOK 



Canning Fruit 



Fruit for canning should be ripe and fresh for the best 
results. Over-ripe fruit is difficult to sterilize. 

By the cold pack method the fruit is placed in the jar 
and all cooking or sterilization is done in the jar. In this 
way all bacteria is destroyed and as the jar is not opened 
again until the fruit is required for use, no bacteria can 
enter, providing the jars and covers are perfect, and the 
jar completely sealed. If air can enter the jar the food 
will mold and spoil. 

All fruits except berries are blanched for the cold-pack 
method of canning. By blanching is meant immersing 
fruit in a pan of hot water for a certain period, the length 
of time depending upon the type of fruit. 

Blanching gives a thorough cleansing, loosens the skin, 
improves the tecture and shrinks the product. After 
blanching the fruit is immediately dipped in cold water. 
This hardens the pulp under the skin, making it easy to 
remove the skin, leaves the fruit firm and sets the color. 
It also enables handling of the fruit at once so that it 
may easily be packed into jars. Do not allow the fruit 
to remain in the cold water; dip it in and then remove at 
once. Peel and pack into jars immediately. It is necessary 
to handle the fruit rapidly at this stage. Many failures 
in canning can be traced to allowing the fruit to stand 
after blanching instead of packing in jars at once. It can 
easily be understood why it is both easier and better in 
every way to blanch only a small quantity of fruit at a 
time. It is necessary to exercise judgment as to the length 
of time required for blanching, as the condition of the 
fruit will govern that somewhat. 

The time tables which will follow this article can be 
followed exactly if the fruit is fresh and in perfect condi- 
tion. The time for blanching fruits is much easier to 
determine than that for vegetables. 

After packing the fruit in the jar, fill to one-fourth inch 
of the top with hot syrup, adjust the rubbers and place 
the covers in position. Do not seal completely. Leave 
the clamp up, if glass top jars are used; for screw-top jars 



MRS. DE GRAF'S COOK BOOK [313] 

do not screw down entirely. The tops of the jars should 
be tight enough to fit down so that no water can seep 
into the jar, but not be so tight that they can be forced 
off by the expanding process. 

The density of the syrup may be varied according to the 
variety of fruit used, but a general rule which may be 
used for all fruit canning is: Three parts sugar to two 
parts water; boil down to a thin syrup; very sour fruits 
may need a heavier syrup. Use any kettle in which a 
rack may be placed so that the jars will be at least ^ 
inch above the bottom, and deep enough for the water 
to come 1 inch above the tops of the jars. The water 
must come above the jars in order to prevent the liquid 
inside the jars boiling out in the form of steam. The 
water from the boiler will not get into the jars, as all 
force is outward, not inward. Jars not completely filled 
with fruit will keep perfectly because the remaining air 
in the jar will be completely sterilized by the processing 
or cooking. 

Do not count the length of time for cooking until the 
water is actually boiling. It is the boiling temperature 
that does the sterilizing. 

The quality of jar used plays an important part in 
successful results of canning. This does not mean the 
type of jar. Select any style you fancy, but be sure there 
are no flaws. The jars, and covers also, should be per- 
fectly smooth where the two come together; there should 
be no cracks, rough edges or chipped spots. 

Jar covers must fit so tight that there is no possible 
chance of a leak after the jar is sealed. Thorough steri- 
lization is a necessity both for jars and covers. Wash 
jars in warm soapy water; rinse well, then put into a pan 
of cold water and bring slowly to the boiling point, and 
boil not less than 5 minutes. Allow jars to stand in the 
boiling water until ready to fill. Covers my be dropped 
into boiling water a few minutes before required. Another 
very important point is to have new rubbers each time a 
jar is used. It is false economy to use old rubbers. 

In order to withstand the boiling during the period of 
cooking the fruit for the cold-pack method, rubbers must 
be firm and elastic. Sterilize rubbers by covering with 



[314] MRS. DE GRAF'S COOK BOOK 

boiling water, then dry in a clean cloth and use at once. 
The essential point is to kill all bacteria by heat, so every- 
thing that comes in contact with food to be canned must 
be sterilized by boiling. 

When the fruit has cooked the required time take jars 
from the boiler and seal tightly at once. Invert jars and 
let stand until cool. If there should be a flaw in a jar or 
cover it will be discovered if the jar is allowed to cool 
inverted. Set the jars in a cool place, but be careful not 
to let a draft of cold air strike them while cooling or they 
might crack. Also keep plenty of space between jars so 
that there will be a free circulation of air. Store fruit in a 
cool, dry, dark place. 

Use only perfect fruit for canning. The bruised, over- 
ripe fruit may be used for jam. Of course, this does not 
mean fruit that is in any way decayed. 

The cold-pack method described is by far the simplest 
and most satisfactory way to can food. The following 
tables, which are universally used, will be helpful to the 
home canner:

Apricots 1 to 2 minutes 16 m:

PICKLES AND RELISHES 

Pickles and relishes are not classed as strictly hygienic 
foods, but as the home-made products are undoubtedly 
pure, there really seems no reason why these foods should 
not be used in moderation. To make pickles quite harm- 
less as well as palatable, care must be taken to have the 
vinegar absolutely pure. Either malt or a white wine vine- 
gar may be used. Brine in which articles for pickles are to 
be stored should be strong enough to hold up an egg. A 
pint or 2 cups of salt to 1 gallon of water will usually be 
found the right proportion. 

Vegetables for pickling are only to remain over night 
in a brine; 1 cup of salt to 1 gallon of water is sufficient. 
Articles to be pickled lose some of their crispness if scalded, 
but they will absorb the vinegar more easily. 

Pickles stored in stoneware jars will keep for months if 
the vinegar and spices are of good quality; or they may be 
packed in fruit jars. Spices and horseradish are an aid in 
keeping pickles in good condition. And green or red pep- 
pers will give a better flavor than peppercorns. 

When removing pickles from the jar use a wooden, 
porcelain or agate spoon or ladle, as the vinegar attacks 
metal, causing dangerous compounds. 

A spiced vinegar is excellent for any kind of pickles. It 
may be prepared by boiling 1 (juart of vinegar with 1 
ounce each of cloves, allspice, gmger, mace, bay leaves 
and chopped red pepper. Cool before using. 

Vinegar should always be just boiled up, either with or 
without the spices, then allowed to cool before using. 
Raw vinegar never gives the same mellow flavor as that 
obtained when the vinegar is scalded. 

Sugar has a tendency to harden fruits and vegetables, 
and too heavy a syrup may toughen and spoil fruit made 
into sweet pickles. Some varieties of peaches and all 
melons should be cooked tender in water before the pick- 
ling syrup is added to them. 

Pickled Cantaloupe or Watermelon 
Peel the fruit, cut into strips, cover with cold water, 



[316] MRS. DE GRAF'S COOK BOOK 

adding 1 tablespoon salt to each 2 quarts of water and 
boil gently until very tender, then drain well and pack in 
sterilized jars. 

Boil vinegar enough to cover the fruit, adding 2 table- 
spoons of sugar for each quart of vinegar and 2 table- 
spoons of whole mixed spices tied in a muslin bag. Let 
the spices and vinegar boil for 10 minutes, then pour over 
the fruit in the jars until overflowing. Seal tightly and 
store in a cool place. 

Sweet Pickled Pears 

Cut 6 or 8 medium-sized pears in halves, remove core 
and press 1 or 2 cloves into each half-pear. Put ^ cup of 
vinegar, 3 inch piece of cinnamon bark, broken in small 
pieces, and 2 cups of brown sugar in a saucepan over the 
fire. 

When boiling point is reached, add several pieces of the 
pears and cook until tender, but not broken. Place in a 
sterilized jar and when all are cooked fill jar to overflowing 
with the syrup, adjust rubber and covers, and set aside in 
a cool place. The amount given above is for a 1 quart jar. 
This recipe also applies to peaches, except that for this 
fruit the peel should be removed. 

Pickled String Beans 

Remove ends and strings from beans, but keep them 
full length. Cover with boiling water and cook about IS 
minutes; drain, rinse in cold water and drain again. 

Pour over them scalding hot vinegar enough to cover. 
These beans will be ready to serve in 24 hours. 

Sour Cucumber Pickles 

Select small cucumbers, wash, sprinkle with salt and 
cover with cold water. Use 1 cup of salt for each gallon 
of water. 

Allow to stand over-night or about 12 to 14 hours, then 
rinse and pack in fruit jars or crocks. Add green or red 
peppers, also whole spices. Cover with scalding vinegar. 
If using fruit jars, sterilize and seal carefully. If stored 
in an earthenware crock, place a plate with a weight on 



MRS. DE GRAF'S COOK BOOK [317] 

top to keep the pickles in the vinegar, then cover the jar. 
These pickles should keep almost indefinitely. 

Ginger root, horseradish and mustard seeds may be 
added to the hot vinegar. 

Sweet Cucumber Pickles 

Prepare as for sour pickles, adding sugar to taste to the 
hot vinegar. 

Piccalilli 

4 cups green tomatoes. ^ cup salt. 

2 cups red tomatoes. 4 cups vinegar. 

Yi small cabbage^ 4 cups brown sugar. 

2 onions. 1 teaspoon mustard. 
1 green pepper. 1 teaspoon pepper. 

1 small red pepper. 1 teaspoon celery seed. 

3 cucumbers. 1 teaspoon mustard seed. 

Chop the vegetables, cover with salt, and allow to 
stand over night. Drain and press in a cloth to remove 
all liquid; add vinegar, sugar and spices and let simmer 
until clear. This will take about an hour. Store in hot 
sterilized jars. Canned tomatoes may be used instead of 
the green ones. 

Chilli Sauce 

12 ripe tomatoes. 3 tablespoons sugar. 

}^ teaspoon pepper. 2 tablespoons salt. 

3 onions. 2 cups vinegar. 

3 green peppers. 1 teaspoon cinnamon. 

Peel tomatoes and onions and chop all vegetables 
separately very fine. Combine ingredients and cook 
slowly about an hour and a half. Two quarts of canned 
tomatoes may replace the raw ones. If liked highly sea- 
soned, little red chili peppers may be added. 

Tomato Catsup 

4 cups cooked tomatoes. 3^ teaspoon pepper. 

1 tablespoon salt. ^ teaspoon each cinnamon, 

1 onion grated. cloves and nutmeg. 

2 tablespoons sugar. % cup vinegar. 

Combine and cook slowly until thick. Put through a 
sieve, reheat and bottle. If liked a clove of garlic may be 
added to the catsup. 



[318] MRS. DE GRAF'S COOK BOOK 

Dill Pickles 

Fill a jar with small cucumbers. Between them place 
a small piece of dill. For each jar add 1 tablespoon salt. 

Pour cold water over the pickles, place a piece of dill 
on top and seal tightly as for canned fruit. Place in a 
warm place or in the sun until the liquid becomes cloudy. 
Then it will become clear again and by that time the 
pickles are ready for use. 

Mustard Pickles 

4 cups small cucumbers. 6 large green peppers. 

4 cups small onions. 1 head cauliflower. 

1 green tomato. 3 stalks celery. 

Cut in suitable pieces and soak in weak salt water 24 
hours. Then cook in same water until tender and drain. 
Make a dressing of 

6 level tablespoons ground 1 cup flour, 

mustard. 2 quarts vinegar. 

lyi cups sugar. 

Mix dry ingredients, add vinegar slowly. Cook in 
double boiler until thick. Pour over pickles and seal in 
jars. 

Apple Chutney 

Pare, core and cut in quarters about a dozen very sour 
apples. Peel and slice 3 medium-sized onions; chop fine 
or put through the food chopper 1 pound of seeded rais- 
ins. Mix these ingredients and add 3 cups of cider vine- 
gar in which ^ cup of salt and 4 cups of sugar have been 
dissolved. In a cheese cloth bag tie 1 tablespoon each of 
mustard seed, whole cloves and small dried chili peppers. 
Cook all together over a slow fire until the apple and 
onions are tender and the chutney is a rich brown color. 
Seal in sterilized bottles. 

Spiced Apples 

Peel, core and quarter 4 cooking apples; prepare a 
syrup of 2 cups of sugar, 1 cup of water and l}4 cups of 
vinegar; add to this whole spices, tied in a cheese cloth; 
cloves and cinnamon will be sufficient. Cook until sugar 
is dissolved, add apples and cook until transparent, but 
not broken. Chill thoroughly before serving. These will 
take the place of spiced peaches. To be served as a relish.

Holiday Dinners 




HEN arranging the holiday menu, plan so that it 
will be possible to prepare many of the dishes a 
day or two in advance. Christmas and Thanks- 
giving are family gathering days. Try to man- 
age so that the family and guests will not feel that the 
dinner has been too great an effort for the person who 
prepared the menu. 

There are so many things which may be prepared some 
time in advance. The mince meat and plum pudding are 
improved with age. Pumpkin may be steamed and sealed, 
while hot, in jars as any canned fruit, or the canned 
pumpkin may be purchased ready for use. The mayon- 
naise can be prepared and set aside in a covered jar. 
Salted nuts and those needed for salad can also be pre- 
pared. The day before Christmas clean and prepare the 
turkey or chicken, but do not wash until just before cook- 
ing or the flavor will be impaired. The dressing can be 
made and set aside in a covered bowl. It is a very easy 
task to wash the bird and add stuffing just before putting 
in the oven. Simmer the liver, heart and gizzard in 
enough water to cover, until tender. Drain, chop very 
fine, add the liquid they were cooked in and set aside for 
the gravy. 

Pastry may be made for pies, and if the pies are to be 
reheated they may be completed a day in advance. 

If vegetables are to be freshly cooked, wash them, but 
do not remove peel or let them stand very long in cold 
water before cooking as much of the valuable mineral 
salts would be lost. If the vegetables are to be reheated 
in a sauce or in fritters, they may be cooked and set aside 
until needed. 

Other meats may easily be substituted for those called 
for in the following menus. Chicken may be roasted in- 
stead of turkey; a chicken pie or fricassee will be found 
appetizing. A crown roast of pork or lamb is very de- 
licious as well as attractive; roast leg of lamb boned and 
stuffed; roast goose or duck. Turkey is sometimes almost 
prohibitive in price, which makes it necessary for many 



MRS. DE GRAF'S COOK BOOK [321] 

families to forego the traditional Christmas and Thanks- 
giving dinner. 

When planning the holiday dinner, do not forget that 
the turkey is the piece de resistance and do not have too 
many courses to precede the main one or the appetite 
will be satisfied before the turkey appears.

SUGGESTIONS FOR THE MIDNIGHT SUPPER; A 

SERIES OF RECIPES FOR AFTER 

THEATER OR PARTY 

The late supper is usually a meal of luxury, not at all 
a necessity; in fpct, we would be much better off if we did 
not indulge in rich food before retiring. But refreshments 
offer a pleasing way to extend hospitality and the hostess 
usually takes pride in her ability to exhibit her skill in 
providing a tempting supper. 

This additional meal must not be too heavy, not have 
too great a variety of dishes; it should be carefully planned, 
well cooked and daintily served. If one is the proud 
possessor of a chafing dish the main course may be pre- 
pared at the table. As this type of cookery takes place 
before an audience, it requires planning; all necessary 
preparatory cooking should be done in advance; the in- 
gredients all assembled and measured before being placed 
on the table. If this is all arranged ahead of time, the 
actual cooking is not difficult. However, if preferred, the 
food may be cooked just before the guests are called to 
the table and then served from the chafing dish. 

Creamed fish or chicken dishes are easily made and 
suitable for these late suppers. They are rather sub- 
stantial and should be followed by a very light sweet 
course, preferably fruit in some form. 

A considerable part of chafing dish cookery depends 
upon the preparation of sauces and it is essential that one 
first master the art of making savory sauces before at- 
tempting any great variety of chafing dish cookery. For 
those persons who do not possess a chafing dish the food 
may be cooked on the stove or over hot water. 

If numbers are too numerous for a hot course, sand- 
wiches are always acceptable and may be of many varie- 
ties. Sandwiches should be made of bread not too fresh 
to cut well; nor so old that it is dry; they should be soft 
but not moist. If meat is used it is much better chopped 
fine and mixed to a paste with cream, softened butter or 
very thick mayonnaise. If this is not desired than cut the 
meat in very thin slices, and cut each slice in several 



[324] MRS- DE GRAF'S COOK BOOK 

pieces, place on buttered bread and season before cover- 
ing with the second slice of bread. It is never desirable 
to use large slices of meat, even if cut very thin, because 
it is difficult to eat gracefully. Always creani the butter 
well to spread on sandwiches. It will then spread easily 
and the merest suggestion of butter is all that is necessary. 

Cheese dishes are usually relished by the majority of 
persons and there are numerous ways in which cheese can 
be used to supply the main ingredient. If cheese is com- 
bined with other foods, such as in sauces, and cooked only 
long enough to melt, it will not be found harder to digest 
than many other popular dishes. 

However, as cheese is a highly concentrated food, use 
only enough for flavor, and the best results are obtained 
by grating. 

Most of the hot dishes used for late suppers are also 
suitable for luncheon dishes. 

Salad is always popular. Its presence at any meal is 
welcome and for the m aidless household it offers a very 
easy course for the midnight supper. Accompanied by 
rolls (reheated) or freshly baked biscuits, almost any 
variety of salad will be relished. The essentials are to be 
able to make a well-seasoned salad dressing and to serve 
the salad cold. 

If meat or poultry is to be used for the salad, it should 
be cut into dice (not chopped) and mixed with a well- 
seasoned French dressing for several hours before being 
combined with the remaining salad ingredients. Use only 
enough of the dressing to season the meat. Fish should 
be flaked and treated in the same manner. 

All combinations of fruit are palatable in a salad. 
Regardless of what type of dressing is to be used, a little 
lemon juice should always be added to a fruit salad. Mix 
fruits lightly with a silver fork and chill thoroughly be- 
fore serving. 

From a hygienic standpoint the late supper is hardly 
to be encouraged; however, this will have to be deter- 
mined by the individual. And in order to overcome the 
possibility of an unpleasant aftermath keep this extra 
meal as simple as possible. If the main course is to be 
rich in sauces or cheese, do not plan an elaborate dessert, 



MRS. DE GRAF'S COOK BOOK [325] 

but keep to fruits and attractive light but not nutritious 
desserts. Fruit cocktails are always refreshing and may 
be used as dessert for the late supper. For that matter 
the informal supper does not demand a sweet course. Or 
the sweet course, if rich with cream in any form, and 
served with little cakes and a beverage, may constitute 
the entire supper. It is not the variety that makes a de- 
lightful supper party, but the daintiness of table and ser- 
vice, the excellence of the food that is offered and the 
general informality of the occasion. Above all, if one is 
both hostess and maid, plan dishes that can be prepared 
in advance. Keep everything simple, for nothing so mars 
the enjoyment of guests than to be conscious of a very 
busy hostess.

Easy To Carry Hints in Camp Cookery 
for Outdoor Enthusiasts 

For the week-end camper cooking is comparatively 
easy. Most of the food is prepared at home or purchased 
en route, and boiled meat, boiled or fried eggs, tea and 
coffee constitute most of the necessary cooking. The 
week-end camping trip is sort of a prolonged picnic, and 
if spiace is not too much of a factor and the party not too 
large, very appetizing meals can be planned, containing 
canned goods, bread, cake or cookies, which will require 
very little preparation for satisfactory meals. 

The regular camping trip of a week or more presents an 
altogether diflFerent problem and necessitates considerable 
cooking. Everyone is hungry. Out-of-door life certainly 
develops an appetite and the amount of food a party of 
healthy persons can consume is sometimes appalling to 
the cook. 

The success of an outing of this character depends 
largely upon good meals. Poor cooking on a camping trip 
has caused more unpleasantness among friends than any 
other discomfort or inconvenience. No matter how 
patient one is under extreme heat, mosquitoes, or the 
many annoyances which are apt to arise, everyone will be 
happy and forget their troubles if the "eats" are good and 
plentiful. Regardless of how smoothly other things run, 
if the food is not satisfactory, the trip will be somewhat 
of a failure. There is one comforting thought, however, 
which will encourage camp cooks — ^we all know genuine 
hunger is not critical and food will taste most appetizing 
under camping conditions which would not be tolerated 
at home. 

The simplest food is the most appetizing and also the 
best to eat and prepare. Good coffee will cover a multi- 
tude of shortcomings, and put everyone in good humor. 
To make really good coffee in camp is an art. One of the 
first essentials is to have the coffee pot thoroughly washed 
each time it is used. Let it stand open in a sunny place 
when not in use. This is most important, otherwise the 



[330] MRS. DE GRAF'S COOK BOOK 

coffee will be bitter. Allow 1 rounding tablespoon of 
ground coffee for each cup of water used, then allow 1 
extra tablespoonful in the pot for good measure. Use 
cold water and set the pot in a hot place and allow to 
reach boiling point and boil three minutes, no longer; set 
in a warm place, but not over the fire, add % cupful of 
cold water and let stand S or 10 minutes before using. 
The pot should be tightly covered, even taking care to 
stop up the spout so that none of the aroma will be lost. 
The yi cup of cold water is added last to clear the coffee. 
Egg may be added instead, and if used should be mixed 
with the ground coffee before adding any of the cold 
water. 

A clear, golden coffee will reward your efforts, which, 
with canned cream and sugar will be hailed with joy. No 
matter how weary and tired from a day's tramp, a good 
cup of coffee -will stimulate and rest one. 

Baked beans, well cooked, make a good dinner. Dig a 
hole large enough to hold several stones; heat them very 
hot, also have a bed of coals. The beans should be soaked 
over night in sufficient cold water to cover. In the morn- 
ing drain off all water cover with fresh cold water and 
bring to the boiling point and cook about yi hour. Drain 
again. Put a piece of salt pork or bacon in the bottom of 
the bean pot or iron kettle, add beans, another piece of 
salt pork or bacon. Mix seasoning of mustard (may be 
omitted) salt, pepper, and either sugar or molasses, the 
latter giving the best flavor; add a pint of hot water and 
pour over beans; then cover beans entirely with hot water; 
cover closely and set on top of hot coals; put the heated 
stones on top, pack with dirt and make as nearly air-tight 
as possible. Let cook all day-^about 8 or 10 hours. Be 
sure and have a kettle or pot large enough to hold suffi- 
cient water to completely cook the beans; otherwise they 
will taste scorched. 

If brown beans are preferred, they should be soaked 
over night also, but they will not require so long a time to 
cook, and the seasonings should be tomato sauce and 
onions. A small fireless cooker is a great help on a long 
camping trip. 

A self-rismg pancake flour is easy to carry and is most 



MRS. DE GRAF'S COOK BOOK [331] 

convenient for outing trips. These flours only require 
an equal quantity of cold water and they are ready to 
bake. With a small bed of coals, a griddle or heavy frying- 
pan can be kept at a uniform heat, and if different per- 
sons take a turn at frying them, this type of pancake will 
make an easily prepared meal. 

Perhaps the hardest task of all is to make the camp 
bread, and to be able to make it well is one of the tests of 
a good outdoor cook. The best utensil for baking in camp 
is a shallow iron kettle with an iron cover, commonly 
known as a "Dutch oven." Have a bed of coals, but rake 
them to one side and set the kettle in the center; put in 
the bread, cover and heap the coals on top and let bread 
cook about ^ hour. One of the commonest faults with 
camp cooking is having too much heat; the inexperienced 
camper builds a big fire which creates a quantity of smoke 
and makes cooking impossible. Hot coals are needed and 
a well-built campfire will soon produce them. Avoid hav- 
ing left-overs, for it is not easy to utilize them in camp 
cookery. Have simple meals, but aim to have food well 
prepared. Variety at each meal is not essential, but 
variety is desirable each day. Beans served for several 
meals in succession are certainly not appetizing. 

Potatoes and fish may be wrapped in clean wet paper 
and cooked in hot ashes. 

If canned milk is used allow J^ milk to ^ water for 
cooking purposes. When milk is mentioned in a recipe it 
means fresh milk or canned milk diluted in this propor- 
tion. 

Any food which is cooked in a frying-pan or kettle can 
easily be managed over a campfire. If each person will do 
their share of the cooking and the inevitable dish washing, 
a camping trip will work no hardship on any one indi- 
vidual.

Pour boiling water over corn meal and let stand until 
cool; then add remaining ingredients. Beat well and pour 
into a heated iron kettle or frying-pan. Set over hot ashes 
or heated coals until done. If baking powder and eggs are 
not used you will have corn pone. 

Camp Pot Pie 

Any kind of meat may be used. Cut in medium-sized 
pieces and dip in flour. Heat drippings or shortening in 
a heavy kettle or frying-pan, add meat and brown on all 
sides. If there is a quantity of meat, fry only a portion at 
one time so all will be brown, then cover with boiling 
water; cover tightly and set over hot ashes or a low bed of 
coals for 2 or 3 hours. The meat should cook under the 
boiling point, otherwise it will be tough. About an hour 
before serving add seasonings and vegetables. 

Camp Dumplings 

2 cups flour. ^ 1 teaspoon salt. 

1 tablespoon (level) baking 1 cup milk,

These dumplings are very acceptable at the camp dinner. 
Success depends upon having the liquid constantly boil- 
ing and keeping kettle closely covered. 

Camp Shortcake 

Prepare one-half the camp bread mixture. Bake as 
directed for bread. When cooked, split open, butter and 
spread with sweetened fruit. A very easy dish to prepare.

Suggestions for the Picnic Lunch 

The picnic lunch affords an opportunity for much 
thought and display in one's ability to prepare an appe- 
tizing cold meal. The fact that the food must be in such 
form that it may be easily carried limits the variety. 

Sandwiches play the most important part on the picnic 
menu. 

Everyone is hungry, and while fruit is refreshing and 
sweets are relished, after all it is the sandwich which 
makes the lunch, and there should be several varieties. 

Bread is better which is a day old. The dark breads, 
such as graham, rye, Boston brown bread, and the various 
nut breads made with baking powder, all offer variety. 
Always cream butter well before putting upon the bread. 
It will spread evenly and there will be no waste. It is 
easier to spread butter on the bread before cutting each 
slice. But if the sandwiches are to be cut in various 
fancy shapes do not butter the bread until after it is cut, 
otherwise there will be a waste of butter. 

Cut bread very thin and try to put the slices together 
in pairs if the filling is not added at once. If sandwiches 
are to be cut in various fancy shapes, do not butter the 
bread until after it has been cut or there will be a waste of 
butter. Wrap sandwiches in waxed paper or wring a napkin 
out of hot water and wrap around the prepared sandwiches; 
then pack in a box closely covered and keep in as cool a 
place as possible. If the crusts of bread are to be removed 
set aside and later dry them out in a moderate oven, roll 
and put in covered jars to be used for breading croquettes, 
fish, etc., or for scalloped dishes. To make rolled sand- 
wiches remove all the crust from a fresh loaf of white bread 
and wrap the loaf in a damp cloth for several hours, keep- 
ing in a cool place. 

Cut in thin slices lengthwise, spread with creamed 
butter and whatever filling desired and roll as for a jelly 
roll, fastening together with a toothpick. If the loaf of 
bread is large, 1 slice will make 2 sandwich rolls. Wrap 
it in a waxed paper. If sliced, cooked meat is to be used 
as a filling, it should be very tender and be sliced as thin 



[334] MRS. DE GRAF'S COOK BOOK 

as possible, and then each slice of meat should be cut in 
several pieces. However, finely chopped meat is the best, 
put through a food chopper or chopped in a chopping 
bowl. All meat sandwich fillings should be well seasoned. 
For corned beef use prepared mustard; for roast beef, 
either Worcestershire sauce or horseradish; for tongue, a 
thick mayonnaise and finely chopped pickles; for mutton 
or lamb, add tomato catsup and chopped capers; for 
chopped ham, a thick mayonnaise well seasoned with 
mustard. 

The different relishes make excellent seasoning for meat 
sandwiches. Picalilli, chow-chow, chopped olives, walnut 
catsup, etc., all add flavor and variety. For salad sand- 
wiches make a very thick well-seasoned mayonnaise and 
have the salad ingredients cut fine. Lettuce should be 
very crisp and each leaf well dried before placing on the 
bread. Relishes such as olives, pickles, radishes, celery or 
salted nuts are very easy to carry. Sweets may be pro- 
vided in cake, cookies, doughnuts or sweet sandwiches. 

If the sandwiches are to be kept several hours before 
serving, wrap them in oiled paper, or wring a napkin as 
dry as possible out of hot water and wrap about the pre- 
pared sandwiches, keeping them as cool as possible. 

Coffee is easily managed by using the powdered, pre- 
pared type which needs only hot water to make. Sugar 
and powdered or canned milk are easily carried. If 
lemonade is to be used, extract the lemon juice, make a 
syrup of sugar and water, allowing ^ cup of sugar for 
each lemon and enough hot water to dissolve it; boil 1 
minute and add lemon juice, bottle. Add cold water when 
wanted. Never pack fish sandwiches near other food, 
and be sure each article of food is well wrapped or packed 
so that it will not come in contact with other foods. 
Much of the success of the picnic lunch depends upon the 
appearance of the food, so careful packing is a necessity. 

Olive Sandwich Filling 

Chop olives, mix with enough thick mayonnaise to 
make a paste, then spread on bread. Lettuce leaf may 
also be added.

milk and cheese and stir until creamy. Cool and spread 
between unbuttered slices of bread. The filling should be 
as thick as the bread. 

Prune Sandwich Filling 

Drain and rub pitted cooked prunes through a coarse 
sieve. For each cup mashed prunfes add 1 teaspoon lemon 
juice and 1 tablespoon orange marmalade. 



MRS. DE GRAF'S COOK BOOK [337] 

Candies 

The base, or foundation, of all cream candies is fondant. 
If directions are carefully followed fondant can easily be 
made, and from this foundation an almost endless variety 
of combinations. As sugar syrups are easily affected by 
atmospheric conditions, it will be advisable to select a 
clear day for making candies. 

The following rules should be constantly kept in mind 
when cooking syrup for fondant: Scald the saucepan be- 
fore using, to be sure no odor or taste is left from previous 
use. Never stir the syrup after the sugar has dissolved 
and cooking has commenced. If stirred the finished 
product will be granular. When testing the syrup, reduce 
the heat under the saucepan or carefully remove from the 
fire in order to prevent further cooking. Always cover 
the saucepan until the boiling point is reached. If any 
sugar has gathered on the saucepan, the steam created by 
covering the utensil will remove it. Wash the hands in 
cold water before kneading the fondant. Never attempt 
to make a larger quantity at one time than recipe calls 
for; even half that amount might be easier at first. If a 
quantity is desired, make the recipe several times — it will 
be much more successful. 

Fondant 

To 4 cups of granulated sugar, J^ teaspoon of cream 
of tartar, add 2 cups of boiling water. Mix carefully until 
sugar is dissolved, to avoid any possibility of sugar grains 
gathering on the sides of the saucepan. This is most im- 
portant, and if sugar has gathered on the kettle carefully 
wash it off with a damp cloth. If the saucepan is not kept 
free of sugar the fondant will become grainy. Cover kettle 
until boiling point is reached, then uncover and cook until 
the syrup will form a soft ball (238 deg. F.) when dropped 
in cold water. This will take about 10 minutes. When 
cooked remove from the fire at once and set aside to cool 
in the kettle in which it was cooked. The syrup should 
cool evenly, so must not be poured into a cold dish. When 
cool, but not cold, stir well with a flat wooden spoon until 



[338] MRS. DE GRAF'S COOK BOOK 

the syrup has changed to a white, creamy mass, too stiff 
to stir. Turn on to a moulding board and knead just as 
you would bread. The lightness of the fondant depends 
upon the amount of kneading it has received. Place in a 
bowl or jar, cover with a damp cloth and set aside in a 
cool place for several hours, when it will be ready for the 
various types of cream candies. If well made, fondant 
will be very white, glossy and satiny in appearance, and 
should be as smooth as butter when rolled between the 
fingers. Sometimes fondant will become grainy, or sugary, 
and if this condition should happen put it in a saucepan, 
add hot water to cover, stir until dissolved and cook again 
to the soft-ball stage. 

Maple Fondant 

Maple fondant is made with 2 cups of brown sugar, 1 
cup of maple syrup, ^ teaspoon cream of tartar and 1 
cup of boiling water. Mix carefully and cook in the same 
manner as the white fondant. 

Cream Drops 

Divide the fondant into several portions, using about 
yi cupful for each portion; place one part in a cup or 
bowl and set in a pan of hot water until fondant is melted, 
then flavor, color and drop from the tip of a teaspoon on 
to a slightly greased paper. Each part should be flavored 
and colored difi^erently. These creams will harden at 
once, but should not be removed from the paper for an 
hour or two. Peppermint, wintergreen, chocolate, lemon 
and orange are the best flavors to use. Perfectly harmless 
vegetable colorings come in a paste form, and it remiires 
only a small amount to produce a delicate color. They 
come in tiny jars and will last for several years, so are not 
expensive. 

Stuffed Prunes 

A very satisfactory candy, easily made and good for 
the children. Wash prunes well, then place in a steamer 
over hot water until they become plump, but not soft or 
broken. Cool, remove pit and stuff with vanilla or choco- 
late flavored fondant. Roll the fondant in balls before 



MRS. DE GRAF'S COOK BOOK [339] 

stuffing prunes. Or fill prunes with marshm allows. For a 
dinner confection, stuff prunes with salted almonds or 
walnut meats. 

Chocolate Creams 

Flavor fondant and roll into small balls; set aside to 
dry for an hour or more. Use a dipping or an unsweetened 
chocolate for coating. Melt the chocolate over hot water 
and do not keep over the fire after it has melted. Dip 
each ball of fondant into the chocolate, using a candy 
dipper or a fork. Do this quickly, so that too much choc- 
olate is not coated to the fondant, for it will only run off 
and spread as the candy dries. Set each cream on a 
slightly greased or waxed paper to dry. 

Walnut Creams 

Flavor fondant, roll into small balls, then press half a 
walnut meat on each side; set aside to dry. Pecans or 
almonds may be used in the same manner. 

Nut Bars 

Knead chopped nuts into flavored fondant and make 
into a roll about 2 inches thick and 5 or 6 inches long. 
Cut off pieces about ^ inch thick and set aside to dry. 

Cocoanut Bars 

Knead cocoanut into flavored fondant; roll about 2 
inches thick and several inches long and cut into yi inch 
slices. 

Candied Orange Peel 

Remove the skin from oranges in quarters; put in a 
saucepan, cover with cold water and bring to the boiling 
point. Simmer until tender. Drain; remove all the white 
portion; cut in thin strips with the scissors; boil 1 cup of 
sugar with yi cup of hot water until it spins a thread when 
dropped from the tip of a spoon; add the orange peel, 
cook 5 minutes, drain from syrup and roll in granulated 
sugar.

Add milk to sugar, stir until dissolved and boil until 
syrup will form a soft ball when dropped in cold water. 
Add nuts and flavoring and beat until creamy. Pour into 
a buttered pan and when cool cut in squares. 

Peanut Brittle 

Take equal parts of sugar and peanuts which have been 
roasted, shelled and broken. Melt sugar in an iron frying 
pan over a slow fire until a golden syrup is formed. It 
will be necessary to stir this constantly. As soon as the 
syrup begins to color remove from the fire; the heat of the 
pan should finish the cooking; then add the peanuts, mix 
and pour on an ungreased platter. When cold and hard 
break into pieces. 

Glace Nuts 

Halves of walnuts, pecans, almond or Brazil nuts are 
dipped into the melted sugar just before it turns brown. 
Drop each coated nut on a greased plate to cool and 
harden.

Invalid Cookery 




|ooD for the sick and convalescent should be care- 
fully prepared and daintily served. The attractive 
appearance has much to do towards tempting a 
capricious appetite. In severe cases of sickness 
the physician in charge usually prescribes the diet, and 
regardless of the wishes or cravings of the patient the 
doctor's orders should be carried out implicitly. In mild 
cases of sickness or during convalescence, nutrious and 
easily digested food is required to bring the body back to 
its normal condition. 

While there is no effort on the part of the patient that 
would seem to require energy foods, nevertheless the body 
requirements are almost the same during illness as in 
health. After a long acute illness a convalescing patient 
may require more food than when perfectly well in order 
to bring the body back to its normal condition, and also 
supply the daily food requirements. If insufficient fuel 
food is supplied during illness the body will have to draw 
upon its own reserve which will weaken the patient and 
make recovery slow. 

The foods selected should be easily digested and assimi- 
lated in order to place no undue tax upon the system. 

Milk in some form, either plain or in combination with 
cereals, eggs, etc., is one of the most valuable foods for 
the invalid's tray. 

Gruels are easily digested and assimilated but unless 
taken in quantities will not supply sufficient nutriment. 
Their chief value is to allay hunger, often imaginary on 
the part of the patient. 

Beef juice has very little fuel value unless taken in 
(}uantity. As it is not as palatable as broth or beef tea 
it is usually served in small portions. 

Broths and clear soups contain little nutriment but are 
relished for their soothing qualities if served hot, and 
refreshing if served cold. When some thickening medium 
such as eggs or cereals are added to any of these gruels 
or broths their food value increases. 



MRS. DE GRAF'S COOK BOOK [343] 

Gluten Bread

H cake compressed yeast. 

Soak yeast cake in lukewarm water until soft. Scald 
water and cool to lukewarm, then add yeast; salt, and grad- 
ually beat in the flour until dough is too stiff to handle, 
then knead thoroughly, using more flour if necessary. Be 
sure the water is only lukewarm otherwise the mixture 
will be sticky and hard to handle. Shape into a loaf and 
place in a greased pan. Let stand in a moderately warm 
place until the loaf doubles in size. Bake about 45 min- 
utes in a hot oven. 

Oatmeal Gruel 

J^ cup rolled oats. J^ teaspoon salt.

smooth paste, then add to the rapidly boiling water, 
stirring constantly. Cook over a low fire about 2 hours. 
Dilute to desired consistency with hot milk or cream, 
then strain. 

Farina Gruel 

2 tablespoons Farina. 1 cup hot milk. 
^ cup cold water. }^ teaspoon salt. 
1 cup boiling water. 

Mix Farina with cold water, then add to salted boiling 
water. Cook directly over the fire 5 minutes, then over 
hot water 30 minutes. Add the hot milk and serve. The 
gruel may be poured over 1 well-beaten egg. 

Beef Tea 

1 pound of round steak. H teaspoon salt. 

2 cups cold water. 



[344] MRS. DE GRAF'S COOK BOOK 

Wipe steak with a damp cloth. Remove all fat and cut 
into half-inch cubes. Put meat into a quart glass fruit-jar, 
add cold water and let stand half an hour to extract the 
juice. Adjust rubber band and cover tightly on jar and 
set on a rack or plate placed in the bottom of a large 
kettle. Surround with cold water and gradually heat 
until water is hot but not boiling. Keep hot for about 
2 hours. Strain and cool. Remove all fat, reheat, season 
and serve in hot cups. 

Beef Juice 

1 pound of top round steak. 

Wipe meat and remove all fat. Broil about 1 minute 
on each side to start the juices, then slash meat both 
lengthwise and crosswise that more juice may be extracted. 
Squeeze out the juice in a press, lemon squeezer or potato 
ricer. Pour into a hot cup, season slightly with salt and 
serve. Very little of this juice can be relished at one time, 
one-half a cupful or less. 

Mutton or Beef Broth 

The cheaper cuts of meat should be used. For each 
pound of meat and bones allow 4 cups or 1 quart of cold 
water, 1 teaspoon of salt. Wipe the meat, remove skin 
and cut into small pieces. Have bones well-cracked, and 
broken. Put into a kettle, add cold water, and let stand 
30 minutes to extract the juices. Add salt and gradually 
heat to simmering point. Keep below boiling point about 
4 hours or until meat is very tender. Strain and cool. 
Remove fat. Reheat in a double boiler or over hot water, 
season and serve. Broths should be made a day before 
serving so that aill the fat may be easily removed. Cooked 
rice or pearl barley may be added to the strained broth. 

Chicken Broth 

Dress chicken and remove all skin and fat. Cut as for 
a fricassee, then proceed as for mutton broth. 

Scraped Beef 

Secure top round steak. Lay meat on a board and with 
a silver spoon scrape off the soft part until nothing re-

MRS. DE GRAF'S COOK BOOK [13] 

Measurements 

I HE first essentials for uniform results in cookery 
are knowledge of the proper methods to use and 
accuracy of measurements. All cook books and 
tested recipes call for measuring cups and level 
measurements, and flour is sifted once before measuring. 
This will insure uniform results, providing the oven heat 
and the methods used are correct. Most failures in cooking 
can be traced to careless measuring, not following the 
recipe accurately, or lack of proper heat regulation. 

Experience in teaching housewives the fundamentals 
of cookery have brought out the information that com- 
paratively few women provide themselves with standard 
half pint measuring cups. All tested recipes call for a 
cup of this type. For flour mixtures the ordinary house- 
hold cup is not satisfactory, as it seldom holds a half pint. 
The baking powder, salt, etc., will be out of proportion to 
the other ingredients if a standard measuring cup is not 
used. It may not mean failure, but it will mean indifferent 
results. Careless measuring of salt will render a dish most 
unpleasant, if not entirely useless. Too much baking 
powder will cause a cake to be dry and coarse in texture. 
My own experience as a teacher has shown me that the 
average housewife does not measure ingredients carefully, 
and to be accurate in measurements is one of the first steps 
to success. Divided recipes often fail because not care- 
fully divided. 

A standard measuring cup holds just one-half pint of 
liquid or half a pound of butter or sugar, or one-fourth 
pound of flour. A level cup of any material is all the cup 
will hold. Fats should be packed solid or weighed. 
The cups are marked to indicate halves, fourths, and 
thirds. Kitchen equipment should include at least two of 
these cups. 

Measuring spoons come in sets containing tablespoons, 
half tablespoon, teaspoon, half and quarter teaspoons. 
The standard tablespoon or teaspoon may be used, but be 
sure measurements are level. 



[14] MRS. DE GRAF'S COOK BOOK 

Culinary Terms and Methods 

The term mixing is a general one, and may mean stir- 
ring, beating, kneading, or folding and cutting, according 
to the dish under preparation and the quality and texture 
of the materials to be used. Stirring is the most general 
method used. Liquids are stirred while cooking; thin 
batters, such as pancakes, are mixed by stirring with a 
spoon. Cereals, jams, sauces, etc., are all mixed by 
stirring. 

Beating is the method used to lighten eggs, mix cakes, 
whip cream, etc. Beating may be done with a rotary egg 
beater, fork, egg whip or perforated wooden spoon. If 
using an egg whip, fork, or wooden spoon, the mixture is 
beaten to inclose a quantity of air. When using a rotary 
egg beater the ingredients are well mixed and light, but 
not nearly so much air is beaten into the mixture as when 
using the egg whip. 

Folding and cutting are usually applied to the manner 
in which eggs are added to cake, muffin, or waffle batters, 
souffles or puffy omelets. Sponge cakes made without 
baking powder depend upon the air beaten into the egg 
whites for lightness and texture, the air beaten into the 
eggs expanding with the heat of the oven. 

This rule also applies to souffles, prune whip, and 
puffy omelets. But unless extreme lightness is desired, 
eggs do not need to be beaten separately for muffin or 
waffle batters. By folding and cutting, eggs are added 
carefully to the mixture, the batter being turned over the 
beaten eggs until all have been folded in. If the eggs are 
stirred or beaten into the mixture, the result will not be as 
spongy and light. When the white of eggs and cream are 
beaten light and then added to a mixture, they must be 
carefully folded into the ingredients; otherwise it is use- 
less to beat them light; stirring or beating them into the 
mixture will undo all the previous beating. This method 
seems to be one of the least understood. 
H. Kneading is applied to the manner in which stiff doughs 
are handled. This term usually refers to yeast mixtures. 
After the ingredients have been mixed, the dough is turned 



MRS. DE GRAF'S COOK BOOK [15] 

out on the molding board and kneaded. This is accom- 
phshed by slightly flouring the board and hands, then one 
half the dough is folded over the other half, pressing down 
with the ball of the hand. 

The dough is turned constantly, and in this manner a 
new portion of dough is brought uppermost to fold over 
each time. This process is continued until the dough is 
smooth and elastic. Baking powder or soda raised doughs 
should be kneaded very lightly, if at all; otherwise they 
will not be light. 

Rolling is quite different from all other processes, and 
is used in making pies, biscuits, cookies, doughnuts, rolls, 
tarts, etc. Pastry should be rolled and handled quickly, 
and should always be rolled in one direction, and the rolling 
done as lightly as possible. 

Eggs and crumbs are used for croquettes, fish and other 
foods cooked in deep fat. The food to be fried is first 
dipped in fine bread or cracker crumbs, then in eggs, and 
in the crumbs a second time. The egg should be slightly 
beaten and one tablespoon of cold water added; or the egg 
white slightly beaten may be used instead of the whole egg. 

Molding is used for charlotte russe, blanc mange, and 
gelatine mixtures. It also applies to certain types of 
frozen desserts. The mixture is poured into a wet mold or 
form, chilled, and then turned into the serving dish. The 
mold should stand perfectly level during the chilling, and 
when ready to remove, run a sharp knife or spatula around 
the edge of the form, turn over on a flat serving dish, 
shake the mold or tap lightly on the bottom, when the food 
should unmold. The form should always be thoroughly 
wet and cold when the mixture is poured into it. Dipping 
the mold in warm water for a second is another method of 
unmolding gelatine mixtures, or dipping in cold water to 
unmold frozen puddings. Warm water will soften the 
geletine mixture just enough to unmold it easily, and 
the cold water is so much warmer than the frozen mixture, 
it will have the same effect. 



[16] MRS. DE GRAF'S COOK BOOK 



Cooking Processes 



Boiling 

Every housewife should possess a thorough knowledge 
of the various methods of applying heat to food. There 
is, for instance, a vast difference between boiling and sim- 
mering, and yet much good food has been completely 
ruined in the cooking because this difference was not 
understood. 

Boiling is the most generally used method of cooking; 
it is also one of the simplest and most economical. It 
means cooking the food in water at 212° Fahrenheit. 
Foods when properly boiled are both wholesome and 
digestible. 

There is also an impression that food will cook faster if 
the water boils violently. This is not the case, however, 
for as soon as water bubbles, it has reached the boiling 
point and it does not become any hotter because it boils 
violently. There is a waste of fuel in unnecessarily fast 
boiling, particularly when gas, electricity, or oil is used. 
When the boiling point has once been reached, it can 
easily be maintained with a reduced heat. 

Simmering 

Simmering food is keeping the liquid under the boiling 
point — a long, slow cooking process. This method is used 
for meat soup stocks and for making tender the cheaper, 
tough cuts of meat and old fowls. Boiling meat or fowl 
only toughens it; keeping at the simmering point will 
gradually make the meat tender and palatable. 

If soup stock is boiled, the stock will lack flavor, for 
boiling seals the surface, and if continued, keeps the juices 
in the meat; simmering will draw out the juices necessary 
in a good soup stock. 

The term "boiled meat" is really incorrect. While the 
meat is plunged into boiling water to seal the surface and 
keep the juices from escaping, it is cooked at the simmer- 
ing point. 

The housekeeper who learns the value of simmering will 
always be able to serve well cooked meats at comparatively 



MRS. DE GRAF'S COOK BOOK [17] 

small cost, for the less tender cuts of meat are just as high 
in food value as the more expensive parts. 

Steaming 

By this method food is cooked in the vapor arising from 
boiling water, and it is the most gradual of all methods. 
The water under the food must be kept constantly boiling 
and the steamer containing the food should be closely 
covered so as to retain all the steam. This gradual heat 
renders many foods more digestible than when boiled. 
None of the nutriment is lost, as when food is immersed in 
water. Steamed foods retain all their food value and 
flavor. 

Stewing 

Stewing is cooking food in a small amount of liquid at 
the simmering point, closely covered, until it becomes 
tender. Stewed meat or chicken is a sort of combination 
meat and soup, for the gravy is always served as part of 
the dish. Food is cut in small pieces for stewing, and the 
cooking takes less time than for one large piece of meat or 
a whole fowl. Stewing is an economical method of cook- 
ing, because the cheaper tough cuts of meat may be used. 
All the nutriment is retained, and the slow cooking renders 
the food entirely digestible. 

Braising 

Braising Is a combination of stewing and roasting, and 
is used for meats — usually the less tender roasts. The 
meat is cooked with less liquid than for boiling, and is 
cooked in one solid piece. Braising may be accomplished 
on top of the fire, using a heavy kettle, closely covered, or 
in the oven in a covered pan. The meat is first browned 
in drippings, or other fat; then a small quantity of liquid is 
added, which is slowly reduced to a rich gravy. Occasional 
basting is required if the meat is to be juicy and fine in 
flavor. The toughest cut of meat will become tender by 
this method. When meat is braised in an iron kettle 
over the fire, it is frequently called a pot roast. 

Roasting 

Roasting really means cooking over hot coals, or In hot 



[18] MRS. DE GRAF'S COOK BOOK 

ashes. Oven roasting is the more modern method of 
cooking meats, although the open fire and hot coals are 
still preferred by many cooks. 

The oven should be hot when the meat is put into it, 
and kept hot for about fifteen minutes. By that time the 
surface of the meat should be seared to prevent the escape 
of the juices. The heat should then be reduced and the 
cooking continued. Frequent basting is essential, as it 
prevents the meat becoming dry. 

Broiling or Grilling 

Broiling is one of the quickest methods of cooking 
foods. It is really a form of roasting, but is used for meat 
with greater surface but seldom more than two inches in 
thickness — often less. Red-hot coals or the well-heated 
broiler of a gas or electric range are required. The object 
is to sear over both sides as quickly as possible without 
burning, in order to retain the rich juices. After searing, 
the heat should be reduced and the cooking continued as 
long as desired, turning once or twice if beef, chops, or 
chicken are being broiled. 

Planking 

Planking meat or fish is practically a form of broiling. 
The food is first seared on both sides in the broiler, then 
finished on the heated plank in a hot oven. The wood 
imparts a pleasing flavor, and the plank itself offers an 
opportunity for attractive garnishes. 

Baking 

Baking is accomplished in the oven with various degrees 
of heat. The difference between baking and broiling food 
is that one is cooked in a dry heat, and the other is cooked 
in moist heat. 

Frying 

There are three methods of frying foods: immersing in 
deep, hot fat; sauteing, or cooking in a small amount of 
fat in a frying pan; or pan broiling, which is done in a very 
hot pan without fat, but turning frequently to avoid 
burning.

Everyday Mistakes in Cooking 

When strong flavored vegetables, such as cabbage, 
cauHflower, or onions, lose their color, are rather strong in 
flavor and throw ofi^ an unpleasant odor while cooking, the 
vegetable has not been put to cook in boiling water and 
the kettle in which it was cooked has been covered. Never 
start vegetables cooking in water under the boiling point. 
For the strong flavored vegetables use a quantity of water, 
but for the green, more delicate flavored ones use little 
water; add salt before the vegetables and cook in an un- 
covered kettle and they will retain their full flavor and 
bright green color. When a quantity of water is used to 
cook such vegetables as peas, spinach, string beans, etc., 
much of the valuable properties of the food are lost and 
thrown away. Many vegetables are overcooked until the 
best flavor is entirely destroyed. Cabbage is an example; 
it is usually cooked until limp and heavy, and while it may 
taste palatable, is most indigestible. Cabbage cooks very 
quickly and is done when tender. 

Mayonnaise dressing separates if the oil is added too 
quickly or if all the ingredients are not of the same temper- 
ature. 

A teaspoonful of vinegar or lemon juice added to the egg 
yolks before any of the oil is used will aid in keeping the 
dressing smooth. If the dressing should curdle add it very 
slowly to another egg yolk. 

French dressing should be thick. This is easily accom- 
plished by putting all the ingredients in a small covered 
fruit jar and shaking until the mixture thickens. 

Fried foods, as croquettes, fritters, doughnuts, etc., be- 
come soaked with fat if the oil or lard they are fried in was 
not sufficiently heated. The temperature of the fat should 
be tested before any food is fried, and this should be re- 
peated each time food is added, as the fat usually cools 
somewhat with each addition of cold food. Heat fat until 
a faint trace of smoke can be seen over the surface, then 
test. It should never be heated until the kitchen is filled 
with an unpleasant haze of smoke. If properly done, deep 



[20] MRS. DE GRAF'S COOK BOOK 

fat frying will be more satisfactory and food will absorb 
less fat than when cooked in a frying pan. 

Sauces and gravies have a layer of fat on top when more 
fat is used than flour. The flour and fat should be in equal 
quantities; allow from 1 to 2 tablespoonfuls of each to a 
cupful of liquid, according to the thickness desired for the 
sauce. 

Omelets are tough when cooked too rapidly. Dump- 
lings are heavy if the liquid is not kept constantly boiling 
and if the cover of the kettle does not fit closel}/^ or has been 
removed before the dumplings are cooked. They should 
be dropped into rapidly boiling liquid, covered closely and 
cooked 12 minutes before cover is removed. 

True sponge cakes (those made without baking powder) 
are coarse in texture and dry if eggs are not carefully beaten 
with a whip egg beater to inclose all the air possible, then 
baked in a very moderate oven. 

Baking powder biscuits, muffins and all quick breakfast 
breads require a hot oven or they will not be light. 

Popover and cream puff's fall when they have not been 
baked long enough. 

Cakes that rise in the center and crack have been baked 
in too hot an oven or contain too much flour. 

Cakes that are soggy in the center have not been 
thoroughly baked. The center is the last part to bake, and 
before removing from the oven touch the center lightly; 
if the finger makes an imprint the cake is not baked 
sufficiently; if it springs back the cake is done. 

To prevent milk from separating when making a cream 
of tomato soup, heat milk and add the thickening. Com- 
bine milk and tomatoes just before serving. 

Boiled or baked custards that have curdled have been 
cooked too fast or too long. A boiled custard that has 
curdled may be redeemed by pouring the mixture imme- 
diately into a cold bowl and beating until smooth with a 
rotary egg beater. It will never be quite so creamy, how- 
ever. Baked custard and all forms of custard puddings 
should be set in a pan of hot water to bake. This will 
usually prevent too rapid cooking. The water is kept 
below the boiling point. 



MRS. DE GRAF'S COOK BOOK [21] 

Fruit cake is light in color if baked too rapidly; it is also 
apt to be bitter. 

Cereals should be cooked in boiling water. They should 
cook directly over the fire for 5 minutes; then cook over 
hot water (in a double boiler) for the time required. Cereal 
cannot be completely cooked directly over the flame, as it 
soon thickens and then will burn. The starch requires 
cooking to be digestible, and cooking over hot water is the 
only method whereby it is possible to cook cereal suffi- 
ciently. 

These are only a few suggestions, and yet the success 
of cookery depends much upon such details, unimportant 
as they seem.

Oven Regulation 



The importance of oven regulation cannot be over- 
estimated. Good food can easily be completely ruined in 
baking. A tender, juicy roast can be changed into a tough, 
dry piece of meat. Perfectly made pastry may become 
tough and soggy in the baking. Breakfast breads will be 
light or heavy, depending upon the oven heat. All this 
has been realized by many stove manufacturers, and de- 
vices have been installed which will guide the housewife 
in the operation of the oven. Tables of temperatures refer 
to a thermometer placed inside the oven, as near the center 
as possible. These figures cannot always be followed ex- 
actly, with the attachments placed in oven doors, etc. 
But a very little study will soon enable the operator to 
know just what the indicator should register for the differ- 
ent heats. For example, biscuits require a hot oven, 450 
degrees Fahrenheit. This would mean the degrees of heat 
registered by a thermometer placed in the oven. A 
thermometer placed on the oven door would be affected 
by the colder air of the room, so it would probably be 
necessary to allow the indicator to reach 500 degrees 
Fahrenheit. This can readily be determined after a few 
trials. For these attachments the table of temperatures 
will only serve as a guide. For those who have no oven 
regulator, and who experience difficulty in managing the 
oven, I would suggest purchasing an oven thermometer. 
It will soon pay for itself in the saving of food, will give 
the inexperienced housewife more confidence, and enable 
her to attempt dishes she formerly felt were impossible. 

A gas oven should not be lighted until just before it is 
to be used, depending upon how hot an oven is desired. 
With two burners lighted, 8 to 10 minutes should make 
the oven very hot, and 5 to 6 minutes is sufficient for a 
medium heat. Of course, this will vary somewhat, 
depending on the type of range and the quality and 
pressure of the gas. 

All food materials are poor conductors of heat, and it 
takes time for the heat to penetrate. The length of time 
and temperature will depend upon the size and thickness 



MRS. DE GRAF'S COOK BOOK [23] 

of the food. A cake baked in a brick-shaped pan — pro- 
ducing a cake like a loaf of bread, high and narrow — will 
take twice as long to bake as the same cake baked in a 
shallow pan. The brick-shaped loaf also requires much 
more skill to bake than does the cake baked in a shallow 
pan. In baking flour mixtures, the larger the mass the 
lower the temperature must be in order to have the heat 
penetrate to the center before a crust has been formed. 
If a cake is placed in too hot an oven, it forms a crust 
before it has risen sufficiently. This aff'ects the texture 
of the cake and produces a cake high in the center and 
thin on the edges. It can readily be seen that it is neces- 
sary to overbake the cake at the edges in order to bake 
the center. This will mean a waste, because the edges will 
be either burned or so crisp and hard it must be removed. 

Thin loaves of bread or cake and small pieces of meat 
need much less time for cooking, because the heat pene- 
trates quickly. Mixtures containing much sugar or molasses 
burn easily. Foods containing a large proportion of eggs 
require a low temperature, or they will become tough. An 
oven filled with food from which a quantity of steam is 
being given off requires more heat than when only one 
small dish of food is being baked. 

When roasting meat, the careful housewife will plan to 
utilize the heat for other foods, too — potatoes, pudding, 
or even vegetables. If the meat is to be broiled, then 
advantage should be taken of the hot oven, having bis- 
cuits, cornbread, or a shortcake. A little study will work 
out all these problems and lessen both the fuel bills and 
labor. 

Most housewives use too hot an oven, particularly when 
gas is used. One must bear in mind that if the gas is 
left burning high, the oven heat will increase very rapidly. 
After the oven has reached the heat desired — hot, medium, 
or slow — turn the gas down until just a small flame is 
visible. The oven will then maintain an even heat. Of 
course, it will be necessary to vary this rule somewhat, 
depending upon the size and quantity of the food and how 
long it is to be baked. Very few foods require a hot oven 
for any length of time. A tender roast of meat needs a 
hot oven to cause it to brown at once, so as to form a 



[24] MRS. DE GRAF'S COOK BOOK 

crust which will keep the juices from escaping. As soon 
as this crust is formed (10 to 15 minutes), the heat should 
be reduced and only a medium oven is necessary for the 
remainder of the cooking. Biscuits require a hot oven for 
the entire time of baking — about 18 minutes for the 
medium-sized ones. All other breakfast breads need a 
fairly hot oven. Cakes need only a medium oven, and the 
richer the cake batter, the slower the mixture should bake. 

Wood and coal ranges are regulated in about the same 
manner, the oven being heated to the right temperature 
beforehand and adding more fuel in small quantities only 
as required to keep an even heat. 

To test the oven without a thermometer, take a piece 
of white paper. Place in the oven after it has been heated 
10 minutes, reducing the heat, if using gas. If the paper 
burns black in 5 minutes, the oven is very hot; if it burns 
a deep brown, it is hot. For the medium oven the paper 
should be a golden brown in 5 minutes. For a slow oven 
it should barely turn the most delicate brown in 5 minutes. 

All of these tests need a little study, and each person 
will have to work out their own problem, but these guides 
are an aid in regulating the oven.

Menu Building 



Planning meals day after day is one of the most difficult 
tasks for the housewife, and this particular branch of the 
housekeeping system needs as much skill and judgment as 
the preparation and cooking of foods. With an almost 
unlimited variety of foods to choose from, the housewife 
should know how to select those foods which will prove 
nutritious and give the greatest return of energy to the 
body for the money she has to spend. Wise economy 
demands that foods should be so combined that there will 
be no waste of either material or energy. 

In order to plan foods wisely, the housewife should 
understand how the various foods differ in nutritive values. 
The foods selected depend largely upon climate and season. 
In localities where the summer months are warm, foods 
which would be very acceptable in winter would prove 
anything but appetizing served on a hot day. 

A generous amount of fat and starch may be served 
when the weather is cold, but these must be avoided during 
the summer, green salads, jellied soups, and light cold 
desserts or fruits taking their places. 

Dishes containing the food principles in the same pro- 
portion should not be served together. A well-balanced 
meal contains neither too much protein, starch, sugar, or 
fat. 

To meet this requirement, the housewife must have 
some knowledge of food values. The substances found in 
foods have been divided into five classes, called food 
principles. These are water, fat, mineral matter, starch 
and sugar (called carbohydrates), and protein. Scarcely 
any food is made up of any one of these food principles, 
almost all containing several in combination. Most of the 
fat is obtained in butter, olive oil, other oils, and fat of 
meats, etc. The use of fat to the body is to give energy 
and heat. If more fat is taken than is required for im- 
mediate use, it is stored in the body ready to use when 
sufficient fat has not been consumed. 

Mineral matter is found in most of the vegetables, and 
in all fruits; also in meat and milk. In fact, nearly all 



[26] MRS. DE GRAF'S COOK BOOK 

foods contain some mineral salts. As a rule this require- 
ment is taken care of in the diet of the average adult, but 
food for growing children should contain a quantity of 
mineral matter. 

Sugar and starch comes under one heading, as starch is 
changed into sugar in the process of digestion. These foods 
supply heat and energy to the body, and the amount 
necessary for an individual will depend largely upon the 
kind of work he does. For heavy, muscular labor and for 
active, growing children, more starch and sugar are re- 
quired than for the clerk, student, or elderly person. 

Protein is the most important food principle, and the 
foremost protein foods are meat, fish, eggs, milk, cheese, 
and most varieties of nuts. There are a few vegetables 
rich in protein as well as starch. These are peas, beans, 
and lentils. When planning a meal with a limited serv- 
ing of meat, as when using left-overs, any one of these 
vegetables will supply the necessary protein. Beans, 
cooked with some fat, may entirely take the place of meat. 

If the menu is rich in starch, select a vegetable contain- 
ing a high percentage of water. Do not serve two dishes 
at one meal where a cream sauce has been used — for 
example, a creamed soup and a creamed vegetable, or 
creamed fish or meat and creamed vegetable or soup. 
Never serve strong flavored vegetables together, such as 
onions, cauliflower, cabbage, turnips, or parsnips. Do not 
have rice, macaroni, or potatoes served at one meal. 

A green salad should be served with a heavy dinner. A 
hearty salad of fish or meat, combined with mayonnaise 
dressing, supplies the main course at luncheon or supper, 
but is much too heavy for a dinner where meat and 
vegetables are served. With a main dish of macaroni and 
cheese, prepared with a cream sauce (a dish ricli in protein 
and starch), such vegetables as spinach, a green salad, or 
tomatoes, cooked or raw, will prove appetizing, while any 
of the beans, dried or green, would make the meal too 
heavy.

Food Value of Fat 



Fat is one of the most important foods, as it is the 
greatest source of reserve energy. It is also required to lu- 
bricate the body and when taken in reasonable quantities 
is easily digested by persons in normal health. Starch is 
digested mainly in the mouth; protein (lean meat, eggs, 
cheese, fish) in the stomach; fats are changed but little 
until they reach the small intestine, then they are divided 
into tiny portions and are carried to the blood. Fats rank 
in digestibility as follows: first butter and cream, then 
olive oil; other vegetable oils such as cottonseed, corn and 
peanut oil; oleomargarine, beef fat and last the various pork 
fats. Margarines are used as butter substitutes and rank 
with butter in fuel value in proportion to fat content. But 
butter contains the valuable fat soluble vitamines so 
necessary to growth, especially of children. Margarines do 
not possess this quality, so are not as desirable to use in 
children's diet, although the adult may use margarine in 
place of butter, as the diet for the normal grown person will 
include these vitamines in other foods. 

Nature has taught us to take fats in combination with 
other foods, as it is more palatable in that form. We 
spread butter on bread, or steak, and add it to boiled 
vegetables, potatoes, etc., or cut with an acid we pour oils 
over lettuce. Anything which aids in the division of the 
oil, helps in its digestion and assimilation. From this it 
would seem that pastry might not be indigestible. But as 
already stated starch is digested mainly in the mouth, and 
if the starch or flour in pastry be mixed with layers of fat, 
how can the saliva permeate through these layers and 
digest the starch? Well made, light flaky pastrv can be 
eaten in moderation without causing indigestion, but 
pastry should not be served too frequently. 

When using fat for cooking do not allow it to become 
over-heated. Fats heated to the smoking point become 
decomposed; when such fat is eaten it can be an irritation 
which produces indigestion. The temperature of diflPerent 
fats vary. Butter when heated to the point when it 
bubbles and foams is about the heat of boiling water. If 



MRS. DE GRAF'S COOK BOOK [29] 

heated beyond the bubbling point, it is considerably 
hotter than the boiling point of water. If fat bubbles when 
heated, there is water present and it is the water which is 
boiling; when the fat ceases to boil the water has been 
evaporated and the fat is ready to use. Since fat when 
over-cooked is very unwholesome, it is essential to know 
how to use this important food so that it will be beneficial 
and not a detriment by daily use. 

As fats have more than twice the energy value of the 
other food principles, there is no reason to question their 
general wholesomeness. The housewife will need to 
consider how much and in what form fats should be given 
to her family. Only a certain amount is needed for im- 
mediate use in the body, the excess consumed being stored 
for future use. Butter, cream and quantities of whole milk 
are the best fats for children, and foods cooked in hot fat 
should not be given children at all. 

How to Render Fat 

Remove all skin and membrane. Put leaf lard or beef 
suet through the food chopper then place in the upper part 
of a double boiler and set over boiling water. This is a 
quick method and the fat will remain white. A very good 
combination is to use 1 part leaf lard to 2 parts beef suet. 
When the fat is rendered drain through a fine sieve or 
cheese cloth and set aside to cool. When cold but still 
in liquid form beat with a whip egg beater until the fat is 
firm and white. This mixture if beaten in this manner 
does not become tallowy and hard. If lard is not liked use 
3^ corn oil. This fat can be used as a shortening for pastry 
or biscuit doughs or for frying.

Composition of Tea 




XCEPT for the sugar and cream that may be taken 
with it, tea possesses no nutritive qualities. It 
is somewhat stimulating and very mildly exhila- 
rating. The stimulating principle, theine, and 
the essential oil, which gives fragrance, are the desirable 
elements. Tannin, a bitter astringent substance, is the 
undesirable element. The problem in making tea is to 
bring out the stimulating qualities and fragrant oil, and 
to avoid the tannin. This can only be accomplished by 
pouring freshly boiling water over the tea for fiv^ minutes. 
Water under the boiling point will not develop the flavor, 
and if the leaves remain in the water over five minutes, 
the tannin is apparent. If the leaves are boiled, tannin 
will be extracted in quantity. 

Making of Tea 

By freshly boiling water is meant water freshly drawn 
and boiled at once. Using a tea ball is one of the best 
methods to make tea. It can be attached to the cover or 
nozzle of the tea pot by the chain, and at the end of five 
minutes, be withdrawn. Scald the pot before setting 
away, and again before using. The proper proportion of 
tea will vary with the quality and taste. Usually one 
teaspoonful will be ample for each cup of freshly boiled 
water. Earthenware, china, silver, or aluminum are all 
satisfactory materials for a tea pot. 

Coffee 

CofFee has no food value except when milk and sugar 
are used. Tannin is also present in coffee, but in less 
quantity than in tea, and is not extracted so readily as 
from the more delicate tea leaves. When roasting, the 
beans throw off moisture and develop flavor. Coffee also 
possesses a mildly stimulating effect, due to caffeine and 
the essential oil. To make good coffee requires a pure 
brand of coffee and a perfectly clean coffee pot, free 
from discoloratlons. 



MRS. DE GRAF'S COOK BOOK [33] 

To Make Cofifee in a Coffee Pot 

Allow 1 tablespoon of medium ground coffee for each 
cup of boiling water. Heat the pot, add coffee, then pour 
over the boiling water; set over the fire, bring to the boiling 
point, and remove from the fire. Let stand in a warm 
place for 5 minutes. Add 34 cup of cold water to make the 
coffee clear. When made by this method, coffee contains 
a minimum amount of caffeine and tannin. 

Percolator Coffee 

The old fashioned coffee pot has been replaced by the 
more modern percolator. For this method of coffee 
making, the beans should be ground very fine. Allow 
1 tablespoonful of the finely ground coffee for each cupful 
of water used. Set over the fire and let percolate about 
5 minutes, according to the strength desired. Hot or 
cold water may be used. 

Filtered Coffee 

This method of making coffee is preferred by many 
persons. It requires a special pot, and full directions for 
making are furnished with each pot. The essentials are 
a heated pot and boiling water. 

Cocoa and Chocolate 

Theobromine is the stimulating element in cocoa beans, 
and is much less pronounced in its effect than the corre- 
sponding principles in tea and coffee. The high percentage 
of fat, together with other food principles, places this 
beverage in the class with foods. As a rule, when making 
cocoa or chocolate, follow the recipes found on the package. 
It will be well to bear in mind, however, that boiling will 
greatly improve it. Beating constantly with an egg 
beater while cooking will thoroughly mix the ingredients 
and prevent a thin skin from rising to the surface. 

Beef Tea 

Like tea, coffee, and chocolate, there is a principle in 
meat which is stimulating. These are soluble in 
water, and when extracted, make a beverage which 
stimulates the appetite. Being easily digested, beef tea is 
good for convalescents and beneficial when one is tired. 



[34] MRS. DE GRAF'S COOK BOOK 

How to Make Beef Tea 

Yi pound of rotind of beef. 34 teaspoon of salt. 

2 cups of cold water. 

Put meat through the food chopper. Cover with water, 
add salt, and let stand an hour. Put in the upper part of a 
double boiler, fill the under part with cold water, set the 
meat over it, and cook over the water about 2 hours, 
keeping the water underneath below the boiling point. 
Strain and serve. 

Cool, Refreshing Drinks 

All fruit juices make refreshing drinks and punches. 
The fruit syrups may be made and some kinds can be pur- 
chased ready for use. The best lemonade is made from 
prepared syrup in the proportion of two cups each of water 
and sugar and a thin shaving of lemon peel boiled for 
about ten minutes, removing any scum which may gather 
on the surface; cool and add the juice of six to eight lemons. 
Allow two tablespoons of the lemon syrup for each glass 
of water. 

Partially fill each glass with shaved or crushed ice be- 
fore pouring in the lemonade. If one does not possess an 
ice shaver have a small, stout canvas bag and pound the 
ice to the consistency of snow. This insures the mixture 
cooling at once and adds greatly to the attractiveness of 
the drink. This only applies to cool drinks served in tall 
glasses, and not those served from a punch bowl. 

Chocolate syrup is made by taking 3^ cup of ground 
chocolate, two cups of sugar and one cup boiling water. 
Mix and boil about 5 minutes. Cool, add 1 teaspoon 
vanilla and store in a tightly covered jar or bottle. For 
iced chocolate use 1 tablespoon syrup to ^ cup of milk; 
pour over shaved or pounded ice and put a tablespoon 
whipped cream on top. 

A chocolate eggnog is particularly refreshing and nour- 
ishing as well, and can be given to both old and young. 
Beat 1 egg white very stiff, then add gradually, while 
constantly beating, 1 tablespoon ground chocolate and a 
few grains of salt; take out about 3^ of this mixture, and 
to remaining portion add gradually 1 cup cold milk, con- 



MRS. DE GRAF'S COOK BOOK [35] 

stantly beating. Put the remainder of the mixture on top 
and serve. 

Coffee syrup is useful to have on hand also. Make 1 
pint of strong coffee; strain, add 2 cups sugar and boil 
about 5 minutes. Cool and store in a bottle or tightly 
covered jar. Use 2 tablespoons of the coffee syrup to ^ 
cup milk, pour over shaved ice and add 1 tablespoon cream 
either whipped or plain; a little nutmeg may be sprinkled 
over the top. Both the iced chocolate and coffee make 
excellent warm-weather luncheon drinks and offer a change 
from the usual iced tea. And, by the way, iced tea should 
be made fresh and used at once if it is to be at its best. 
Always make tea with water which has been freshly 
boiled. For iced tea make a little stronger than usual, 
and steep only 4 minutes, then pour in tall glasses 3^ full 
of shaved or crushed ice. Add thin slices of lemon and 
pass powdered sugar. For a tea punch chill tea; add 3^ 
as much lemon juice as tea. Keep very cold and just 
before serving add 1 small bottle of ginger die for every 2 
quarts of tea. 

For those persons who enjoy the flavor of chocolate, but 
do not care to indulge in fattening foods, cocoa may be 
freely used. Cocoa is almost free of the rich fats contained 
in chocolate. 

Orange Julip 

3 oranges. 2 cups boiling water. 

1 grapefruit. 1 pint ginger ale. 

1 cup sugar. 1 spray fresh mint. 

Extract orange and grapefruit juice. Boil sugar and 
water 5 minutes; cool and add to fruit juice. Just before 
serving add ginger ale. Fill bottom of glass with crushed 
ice, add a small bit of the bruised mint, then fill glasses 
with liquid. Thin quartered slices of orange or cherries 
may be added. 

Honolulu Fizz 

For each service allow: 3^ cup pineapple juice, ^ cup 
sparkling cider, 1 egg white, tiny spray mint crushed. 
Put ingredients into a shaker or jar and shake vigorously 
for 3 or 4 minutes. Pour at once over crushed ice. 



[36] MRS. DE GRAF'S COOK BOOK

1 quart cooked sweetened 1 cup sugar. 

loganberries. 1 cup water (ice water). 

3 lemons (juice only). 

Boil sugar and water 5 minutes; cool, add fruit and 
lemon juice and let stand about 2 hours. Strain and 
dilute with ice water to the desired strength. 

Lemon Whey 

1 cup hot milk. 1 tablespoon sugar.

Fruit Essential in the Daily Diet 

Fruit is really indispensable in a well regulated diet. 
Formerly it was considered an accessory, rather than an 
essential food, and was eaten mainly for its flavor and re- 
freshing qualities. The food value of most fruits is not 
high, but the mineral salts they contain are necessary to 
good health. A person who eats quantities of fruit is 
usually in excellent health and has a clear complexion, due 
to the body regulating qualities of the various mineral 
salts and organic acids contained in fruit. These organic 
acids impart an agreeable acid flavor and help to keep 
the blood in good condition. Most fruits contain a large 
proportion of water, also of value in the diet. 

The digestibility of fruit depends upon both the nature 
of the fruit and its degree of ripeness. Neither under nor 
over ripe fruits are fit to eat raw. The over-ripe fruit 
should be discarded, as it is unfit to use under any condi- 
tion; the under-ripe fruit may be cooked and then is 
easily digested. Starch is present in unripe fruit, but is 
changed in the ripe fruit into sugar and gums. 

Uncooked starch is not easily digested, while just the 
opposite is true of the fruit sugars, which very seldom cause 
digestive troubles, such as may be produced from cane 
sugar. Eating under-ripe fruit often causes serious results, 
especially when eaten by children. In the unripe condition 
the starch has not been changed to sugar, and the fruit, 
being very firm, is probably not masticated completely, 
making it still harder to digest. A ripe peach would be 
more easily digested than a firm apple, even though the 
apple were perfectly ripe. 

Prunes, figs, dates, raisins, and bananas have a higher 
food value than other fruits. All these, excepting the 
banana, contain a quantity of sugar, as well as mineral 
salts. Bananas are largely starch, and for this reason 
should be perfectly ripe or cooked before eating. All 
children are especially fond of bananas, but it is much safer 
to bake this fruit than to allow them to eat it raw, for it is 
usually sold under-ripe. When the banana is in a fit con- 
dition to eat raw, the skin has become dark and the 



MRS. DE GRAF'S COOK BOOK [39] 

pulp dry and mealy. Cooking is really a ripening process, 
and fruits not sufficiently ripe to eat raw are wholesome 
after cooking. 

Raw fruits have a much greater tonic value than the 
cooked fruit, but to many persons the raw fruit is indigest- 
ible; and as cooking softens the fruit and converts the 
starch into sugar, it is then more easily digested. As the 
cooking process drives out the mineral salts and acids into 
the liquid in which the fruit is cooked, this juice must be 
served with the fruit, or much of its value is lost. Many of 
the valuable mineral salts are found just beneath the skin, 
so these should be retained as far as possible. 

Most children naturally crave fruit, and this desire 
should be gratified and not considered an indulgence. It is 
nature's way of demanding this health-giving, bone-build- 
ing material. Even babies, after three months old, are 
given small quantities of orange or prune juice, gradually 
increasing the amount as the child grows older. Fruit 
beverages offer an opportunity to introduce acids and salts 
into the system. These are always found refreshing. Do 
not serve too sweet, or they will not quench the thirst. 

Uncooked acid fruits should not be served in combi- 
nation with starchy foods, as this frequently causes indi- 
gestion. If cereal is to be served in combination with fruit, 
the fruit should be cooked, or of a variety which is sweet, 
not acid. As fruit contains a quantity of water, very little 
should be used when cooking. Sugar should not be added 
until the fruit is cooked. 

Dried fruits should be thoroughly cleaned, then soaked in 
water to cover for several hours, in order to regain the mois- 
ture which has been evaporated. They should be cooked 
in the liquid in which they were soaked, heating very 
slowly and keeping under the boiling point until tender. 
The slow cooking develops the natural fruit sugars. Prunes, 
raisins, and figs will require no sugar. Other dried fruits 
may need a small quantity. 

Fruit salads offer splendid opportunities for serving both 
fresh and cooked fruits. Such salads may be served as a 
salad course or used for dessert. Fruit cocktails are pala- 
table and serve as an appetizer for dinner. 



[40] MRS. DE GRAF'S COOK BOOK 

The addition of sugar to cooked fruit greatly increases 
its nutritive value and cooking sugar at a high temperature 
in conjunction with the acid of the fruit brings about the 
inversion of the sugar, which is one of the first steps in its 
digestion. 

For this reason jams, marmalades, and preserves are 
considered one of the most wholesome ways in which sugar 
may be eaten. 

If the family does not care for fruits between meals, which 
is really one of the best times to eat them, see that fruit in 
some form is furnished for at least one meal a day, for it is a 
necessary part of the daily diet. Do not consider fruit an 
extravagance and an accessory. If we are to have healthy 
bodies, fruit is an essential, and although its actual food 
value, if fresh, is not high, its health-giving properties are 
a necessity. 

Orange or Grapefruit in Sections 

Cut the orange peel in eighths from the stem nearly to 
the blossom end. Carefully loosen the peel, then the sec- 
tions of orange. Place on a serving plate, placing a table- 
spoon of powdered sugar in the center. The peel may be 
made to form a border by rolling the points inward around 
the base of the orange. 

Oranges and Grapefruit 

Cut fruit in halves crosswise. Cut a small slice from the 
end so fruit will stand level. Loosen the pulp with a sharp 
knife, or grapefruit knife. Remove center pith and mem- 
brane with scissors. 

To Remove Pulp of Orange and Grapefruit for 
Salads and Cocktails 

Peel the fruit with a sharp knife, cutting close enough to 
thefruitso that the juice will run. Cut out each section with 
a sharp pointed knife. There will be very little waste and 
each section should be whole. 



MRS. DE GRAF'S COOK BOOK [41] 

Fresh Fruit Cocktail 

Select grapefruit, oranges, bananas, pineapple and white 
grapes when in season. Use about equal portions of each. 
Remove all seeds, membrane and skin. Chill thoroughly, 
sweeten if necessary or add maraschino syrup. Arrange in 
cocktail glasses; place a cherry on top of each glass. Serve 
very cold. 

Strawberries Au Naturel 

Wash berries carefully but do not hull. Drain until 
dry. Place a tablespoon of powdered sugar in the center 
of individual service plates. Arrange strawberries around 
the sugar and serve. 

Melon Cocktail 

Have equal quantities of chilled cantaloupe and water- 
melon. Cut into balls with a small French vegetable 
cutter or cut into half-inch cubes. Arrange in cocktail 
glasses; sprinkle lightly with salt. 

Melons 

Serve all varieties of melons very cold. Cut watermelon 
in halves and remove the fruit of each in one piece. Cut in 
sections the shape of a piece of pie, remove seeds and 
serve. This method disposes of much of the water so 
awkward if served on the rind. 

Sliced Oranges 

Peel oranges with a sharp knife; slice very thin cross- 
wise. Arrange on individual plates, sprinkle with powdered 
sugar and serve very cold. 

Sliced Peaches 

Scald fruit 1 minute with boiling water. Dip in cold 
water and remove skins. If to stand before serving, 
sprinkle with sugar and lemon juice to prevent discolora- 
tion. 



[42] MRS. DE GRAF'S COOK BOOK 

Sliced Bananas 

Select ripe fruit. Remove skin and scrape outside of the 
fruit. Slice very thin. Do not prepare until shortly before 
being served. 

Fruit Cocktail, with Sauce 

Remove the pulp from grapefruit and mix with diced 
pineapple, diced apple and sliced banana. Allow 3^ cup of 
mixture to each serving. Chill thoroughly, add cocktail 
sauce, also chilled, and serve in grapefruit or red apple 
shells or glasses. 

Sauce for Fruit Cocktail 

}/i cup tomato cocktail sauce or 2 tablespoons orange juice- 
catsup, y^ teaspoon each of salt, pa- 
\i cup white grapejuice. prika, sugar and cloves. 
1 tablespoon lemon juice. J^ teaspoon cinnamon. 

Mix thoroughly and chill. 

Prunes — Stewed 

Wash prunes, cover with warm water and soak for 
several hours, over night if possible. Heat slowly in water 
(in which they were soaked) to simmering point and cook 
under boiling point until tender. Rapid cooking destroys 
the flavor and appearance of the fruit. Prunes may be 
flavored with a small stick of cinnamon or a little lemon 
or orange peel. Slow cooking develops the natural fruit 
sugars and little if any sugar is required; if sugar is used, 
add after prunes are cooked but while still hot; or remove 
prunes, add sugar to juice and simmer until juice is some- 
what thickened. A fireless cooker is excellent for cooking 
prunes. Soak as directed above; then heat to the boiling 
point and set in the fireless (without a heated stone) for 
several hours. 



MRS. DE GRAF'S COOK BOOK [43] 

Prune Juice 

Wash prunes, cover with warm water and let stand over 
night. Heat very slowly to simmering point, cook until 
tender; don't boil. No sugar is required. Pour off juice, 
straining through fine sieve. The prunes left can be used 
for prune desserts requiring prune pulp. 



[44] MRS. DE GRAF'S COOK BOOK 

Garnishes 

To garnish a dish attractively or serve it in an appealing 
form adds very little to its cost, takes no very great amount 
of time, and makes the food so much more pleasing in 
every way. There is nothing which so quickly indicates 
the interest the housewife takes in cooking as the manner 
in which she serves food. One who has no pride in her 
work seldom gives thought to garnishing. Daintily 
served foods encourage appetite and aid digestion. This is 
why an invalid's tray should always have special atten- 
tion, for the tastefully decorated, carefully prepared food 
may tempt a delicate appetite. Convalescent children can 
often be induced to eat food which appeals to their imagi- 
nation, where otherwise the dish would be rejected. A 
marshmallow in a hot cup of cocoa, chocolate or milk may 
be just the thing to make the beverage desirable. 

Many busy home makers are unable to give either time 
or thought to elaborate garnishings, but all food may be 
arranged with some sort of symmetry which enchances its 
appetite appeal. Mashed potatoes may be easily arranged 
in a ring on a flat serving dish and the center opening left 
large enough to hold buttered peas, string beans, or 
asparagus tips. The dish looks attractive and is as quickly 
done as arranging in two separate dishes, and there is one 
less dish to be washed. 

Chops or cutlets can be placed on the platter, one over- 
lapping the other in the center of the dish; or placed in a 
circle on the platter and the center filled with buttered 
peas or mashed potatoes. If roasted potatoes are on the 
menu use as a garnish on the platter surrounding the meat. 
Or perhaps boiled rice is to take the place of potatoes; if so 
butter a custard cup, fill with hot rice, turn out at once 
on the meat platter and repeat until all the rice is used, or 
arrange in a ring. Thin slices of fried bacon make a good 
relish as well as garnish for meat or egg dishes. For 
special occasions mashed potatoes can be shaped into 
individual cup-shaped forms, brushed over with beaten 
egg and then browned nicely on the top grate of a rather 
hot oven; fill the center with a cooked vegetable. If 



MRS. DE GRAF'S COOK BOOK [45] 

stuffed tomatoes are to be the vegetable, use these as a 
garnish for the roast. Fried eggplant may be used in the 
same manner. Slices of tomato, raw or dipped in crumbs 
and fried, are nice served with fried or baked fish or broiled 
chicken. In fact, these are only a few suggestions as to 
the possibilities for serving food in an appealing way, for 
everyday use, which will not require additional labor, such 
a factor in these days when there are so many interesting 
things to do. 

If food is prepared especially for garnishing, it should 
always be eatable. Sandwiches tied with ribbons and 
attractive bows may make a pretty table, but are certainly 
not practical. Have all the decorations desired on the 
table, but not on the food unless it is edible. 

Slices of hard cooked eggs surrounding a mold of 
spinach; radishes cut attractively or plain olives, ripe, 
green, stuffed; slices of lemon, sprinkled with paprika for 
fish; potato balls dipped in melted butter and finely 
chopped parsley. 

Vegetable borders are very attractive and offer a 
palatable way to use left-overs. The center can be filled 
with creamed fish, chicken or veal. 

Pork or lamb chops may be served on a thin layer of 
tomato sauce or surrounded with spaghetti cooked in a 
tomato sauce. Pork chops or sausage may be accompanied 
by rings of fried apples. 

Small croquettes of rice, fried a golden brown, and cubes 
of currant jelly may be served with roast game or fowl. 

Fried or baked bananas add greatly to Salisbury steak 
(chopped raw beef). 

Fruit fritters such as apple, pineapple, orange and 
banana may be served with both steak and fried chicken. 
Corn fritters can be cooked on a griddle like pancakes, and 
are acceptable with almost any kind of meat course. Very 
small portions of left-over corn may be made into these 
fritters. 

For more elaborate garnishing a pastry bag and tube will 
be required. Very little practice is required to handle a 
pastry bag skillfully enough for these simple decorations. 
It takes only a second to fill the bag with creamy mashed 
potatoes and when forced through a large star tube, either 



[46] MRS. DE GRAF'S COOK BOOK 

in a border or cup shape, to be filled with vegetables or 
creamed fish or meat, an otherwise commonplace dish will 
assume a festive appearance. The pastry bag can be made 
at home of heavy canvas, in a cornucopia shape, and the 
tubes can be purchased at any household appliance de- 
partment. One or two tubes are all that are needed, so it 
is not necessary to buy an expensive outfit. 

A garnish may be used for appearance only, such as 
parsley or slices of lemon; or for a food such as hard cooked 
eggs, toast, fritters, etc. Chopped parsley adds flavor as 
well as a garnish to many dishes. If lemons are to serve a 
double purpose, garnish and for flavor, they should be cut 
so the pieces can be handled without soiling the fingers. 
Bread for a garnish should be cut the desired shape (tri- 
angles, diamonds or rounds) before toasting. Toast is 
usually used as a garnish with creamed dishes. French 
fried potatoes or potato balls rolled in minced parsley look 
and taste well with croquettes, chops, steaks or filets of 
fish. Garnishes from hard cooked eggs are numerous; 
they may be cut in rings or quarters; or the yolks pressed 
through a sieve and the whites finely chopped. Figures 
cut from pickled beets or just sliced beets or pickles add an 
attractive touch, both as a relish and for contrast of color. 
One point to remember is that the garnish should be appro- 
priate to the dish and it should not crowd the food it 
accompanies. 

Savory appetizers or relishes are not difl&cult to prepare. 
Canapes, fish and fruit cocktails, raw oysters or clams are 
all used as appetizers to begin the meal, while olives, salted 
nuts, spiced fruits, celery, etc., are passed between courses 
at the formal meal or with the roast at the informal family 
meal. 

Canapes are always attractive and very easy to make 
and add a pleasing touch to the company dinner. The 
foundation is bread cut in small triangles or fancy shapes 
and either spread with butter on one side only and deli- 
cately browned in the oven, or toasted on one side, or 
fried in deep fat. The filling is spread on the untoasted 
side of the bread if the first or second method is used. A 
garnish of some kind is added for the general appearance; 
it may be olives, ripe, green or stuflFed; or pickles cut to 



MRS. DE GRAF'S COOK BOOK [47 ] 

look like a fan; or tiny cheese balls rolled in chopped pars- 
ley; bits of hard cooked egg; minced green pepper or 
pimento or almost anything your fancy dictates. Serve 
these canapes on small plates with or without doilies. 

Fish cocktails may be served in long stemmed wine or 
cocktail glasses or small sherbet cups; fish and fruit cock- 
tails should be served very cold. Each cocktail glass 
should be set on a small plate and a doily under each 
glass adds to the general appearance. 

Whipped cream forced through the pastry bag, using a 
star tube, makes a very tempting decoration for desserts. 
All gelatin puddings can be attractively served in this 
manner; also fruit salads, and even the more humble 
stewed prunes or apple sauce, will look more dainty and 
tempting garnished, and may be served as a dinner dessert. 
Whipped cream not only adds to the appearance of a dish, 
whether a pastry bag is used or it is arranged with a spoon, 
but also adds to the food value of the dish with which it is 
served. 

Very thick mayonnaise may garnish a salad or fish, either 
forced through a pastry bag or used plain. 

Cold meats are improved in appearance if served with 
rings of green peppers or pimento or crisp lettuce leaves, 
with a spoonful of some relish, such as chutney, chili 
sauce, horseradish, or pickles placed in the center of each 
leaf. Olives, radishes or fringed celery also add to the 
appealing appearance of many meat and fish dishes, as 
well as salads. 

Cakes can be very effectively decorated with candied 
fruits, walnuts, blanched almonds and pecans. Angelica 
or thinly sliced citron may be soaked in warm water, dried 
thoroughly, then cut into leaves of any desired form. Tiny 
colored candies and marshmallows may be used to trim 
cakes for children. Also the pastry bag and star tube will 
be found useful for decorating small cakes, even if the 
operator has very little skill in the manipulation of this 
implement. 

Chopped nut meats sprinkled over fruit salads, coffee 
cakes, or cake icings all add to the dainty appearance of 
the food. 

Immaculate linen, attractive dishes, shining glassware, 



[48] MRS. DE GRAF'S COOK BOOK 

all add to the attractive appearance of the table, and these 
need not necessarily be of the expensive variety. 

One important thought to keep uppermost is the fact 
that pleasing looking food creates an appetite and starts 
the digestive fluids, thereby making food more easily 
digested, so the subject of appearance is well worth some 
consideration, not just for occasions, but for every day. 

How to Prepare Radishes for a Garnish 

Wash well, cut a thin slice off the tip and remove the 
root; with a sharp knife score the skin into six or seven 
sections, extending about two-thirds of the way down the 
radish. Then loosen the skin on each section, place in cold 
water and the sections will stand out like the sections of a 
flower. 

How to Prepare Pickles for a Garnish 

Select pickles of uniform size; cut lengthwise, beginning 
at the top, into very thin slices without cutting com- 
pletely through at the end; spread out like a fan. 

To Render Uncooked Vegetables Crisp 

Put into very cold water, adding a slice or two of lemon 
and allow to stand an hour or more. 



MRS. DE GRAF'S COOK BOOK [49] 



Appetizers 



Cream Cheese Canape 

Spread rounds of bread with softened cream cheese, 
place a slice of tomato over it; put thick mayonnaise 
forced through a pastry bag with a star tube, to form a 
border around the tomato. Garnish with tiny cheese balls 
rolled in minced parsley. 

Grated Cheese Canapes 

Spread rounds of bread lightly with French mustard, 
sprinkle with finely grated cheese and minced stuffed 
olives. Sprinkle with paprika. 

Crab or Lobster Canape 

Cut out rounds, diamonds or hearts of bread }/^ inch 
thick and 2 inches in diameter. Brush with butter and 
brown, on one side only, in the oven. When cold spread 
untoasted side with minced crab or lobster mixed with 
mayonnaise. Garnish with minced green peppers or 
chopped olives. 

Shell Fish Canape 

Lobster, crab or shrimps minced very fine and mixed to a 
paste with a well-seasoned mayonnaise. Spread on the 
prepared bread and garnish with stuffed olives. Or for a 
more elaborate canape, the bread may first be spread with 
a thin layer of caviare, then the fish mixture. Any cooked 
fish such as halibut, salmon or tuna may be used in place of 
crab or lobster. 

Sardine Canape 

Bone and mash sardines; season with lemon juice and 
Worcestershire sauce. Mix to a paste and spread on the 
prepared bread. Garnish with hard cooked eggs pressed 
through a sieve or gherkins cut in fan shapes. 



[50] MRS. DE GRAF'S COOK BOOK 

Anchovy Paste 

Cut slices of bread into desired shapes; brush with butter 
and toast on one side. When cold spread untoasted side 
with anchovy paste; garnish with rings cut from whites of 
hard cooked eggs and grated yolks. Stuffed olives may 
also be used as a garnish. 

Caviare and Egg Canapes 

Cut thin slices of graham or whole wheat bread. Butter 
each side and brown delicately in the oven. Allow half a 
hard cooked egg for each service. Remove yolk, mash and 
mix with an equal quantity of caviare. Fill each half of 
egg white with the mixture, heaping it high in the center. 
Chop equal quantities of pimentoes and onions cut very 
fine. Season with a little mayonnaise. Spread on the 
bread, set the stuffed egg in the center and garnish with 
slices of stuffed olives. 

Smoked Salmon Canapes 

Cut fresh bread in half inch slices, then cut round with a 
biscuit cutter. Spread both sides with butter and brown 
in the oven or fry in a frying pan. Allow one hard cooked 
egg for two persons. Chop the white fine and press the 
yolks through the potato ricer or coarse sieve. Place thin 
slices of smoked salmon on each round of bread; arrange 
a border of the egg white around the edge of the bread 
and sprinkle the sifted yolk over the top of the salmon, 
keeping most of it in the center. Serve on individual 
plates. 

Anchovy Eggs 

Cook eggs under boiling point at least 30 minutes. 
The yolks will then be crumbly. When cooked place in 
cold water to chill and prevent yolks turning dark. Cut in 
halves lengthwise. Remove yolks, mash and moisten with 
thick mayonnaise and season with anchovy paste. Fill 
the egg white halves with this mixture, completely cover- 
ing the top and heaping it in the center. Set each half on 
a round of bread which has been lightly toasted on one

CHAPTER THREE 

SOUPS WITH STOCK 
SOUPS WITHOUT STOCK 
CREAM SOUPS 
PUREES 
CHOWDERS 




[54] MRS. DE GRAF'S COOK BOOK 

Good Soup the Best Stimulus to a Good Dinner 

HE best type of soup to use for a dinner menu is 
one made of a meat stock foundation. These 
soups should not be confused in food value with 
heavy chowders, purees or the various cream 
soups and should be classed as accessories instead of 
foods. The foundation for this type of soup is a meat 
stock. Clear soup has its place at the beginning of the 
dinner because it is a valuable appetizer, acting as a 
stimulant rather than as a nutrient, and being quickly 
assimilated, prepares the way for the dishes which are 
to follow. 

Under the ordinary conditions of a dinner, a soup is 
intended to gratify, not satisfy, hunger. It stimulates 
the flow of the digestive juices. When the dishes which 
follow soup are of a hearty nature, the soup should be 
light and clear, not necessarily nutritious. Water cannot 
dissolve the fiber of meat, and as the fiber holds most 
of the nourishment, a meat stock has little food value. 

Where a soup is to form the main dish for luncheon it 
should always be of a nourishing character, such as cream 
soup, puree or chowder. 

The flavor of a good stock depends upon the amount of 
"extractives" that have been obtained during the cooking 
process. "Extractives" are that part of animal food which 
gives distinctive flavor and acts as a stimulant to the 
appetite and as an aid to digestion. 

Meat stock should always be made the day before it is 
required, as a good result can only be obtained by long, 
slow cooking. It is only by this means, too, that the fat 
can be removed from the top of the stock. A good stock 
is strong, well flavored and free from grease. There are a 
number of kinds of stock. 

The first and best stock is made from uncooked meat 
and bones, well flavored. This forms the foundation for 
consomme, bouillon, etc. A second stock may be made 
of the meat and bones left from this first stock by recook- 
ing with water and a quantity of vegetables. This soup 
depends mainly upon the vegetables for flavor. 



MRS. DE GRAF'S COOK BOOK [55] 

Stock may be made from the left-overs of cooked meats, 
bones and vegetables. Such stock can be used not only for 
soup but as a foundation for gravies and savory sauces. 
Stock may be made of vegetables, water and seasonings. 
This makes a very palatable and easily prepared soup. Fish 
stock is made from fish, shellfish or from the trimmings of 
fish, and well flavored with vegetables. This stock forms 
a base for soup or fish sauces. 

Stock made of the left-overs of poultry is quite satis- 
factory. Brown stock is made principally of beef bones and 
meat, while white stock is made of mutton, lamb, poultry, 
veal or rabbit. Glaze is a stock which has been reduced in 
quantity by slow cooking, and when cold forms a solid 
jelly. Freshly made soup stock may be poured into 
sterilized jars sealed and set aside for future use. It will 
keep the same as any canned fruit or vegetable. 

Consommes are made from the first stock, which has 
been made clear by adding the whites and shells of eggs; 
usually some characteristic flavoring is added to give a 
distinguishing name, such as Consomme Julienne (with 
shredded vegetables), or it may be served plain, but 
should be well seasoned. Broths are made from the first 
stock; they should be well flavored with vegetables, and 
may be thickened slightly by adding sago, rice, pearl 
barley, etc. Bouillon is a broth made from beef. It is not 
cleared, as for consomme; it should be well flavored with 
vegetables and may be served plain or with the vegetables 
finely diced or with rice, sago or pearl barley. Thick soups 
are made from meat stock which has been thickened by 
adding corn starch, arrowroot or a quantity of sago, 
tapioca, rice, pearl barley, etc. These thickening sub- 
stances add somewhat to the food value of the soup, but 
not sufficient to place them in the same class with cream 
soups and chowders. 

The meat from which soup is made lacks flavor, but still 
contains most of the necessary food value. It should be 
well seasoned to supply the flavor which has been extracted 
and may be used for croquettes, timbales, or minced and 
served with savory sauces. 

To obtain the flavor of the meat and bones they should 
be cut in small pieces and all but a small portion of the lean 



[56] MRS. DE GRAF'S COOK BOOK 

meat should be covered with cold water and allowed to 
soak for at least an hour. The meat which has been re- 
served should be dredged with flour and browned in hot 
fat. Add the cooked meat to that which is soaking in cold 
water; pour over one cupful of water and simmer for a few 
minutes to obtain all the browned material, which adds 
color and flavor to the stock. 

Set the soup kettle over the fire, add the seasoning and 
bring slowly to the boiling point only, then simmer gently 
several hours. Soup stock should never boil, as that would 
make the meat tough and would keep most of the juices in 
the meat instead of extracting them, as desired; also the 
salt has a tendency to draw out the juices and may be 
added to the cold water when soaking the meat. 

The vegetables added for flavor should be finely chopped 
and sauted, in beef dripping or a portion of the suet, for 
about 5 minutes, then added to the stock. When cooked 
the soup should be strained and set aside to cool; the coat 
of fat which will cover the top should be removed and then 
the stock is ready for use for the various soups. Pearl 
barley, rice, etc., should be previously cooked or partially 
cooked, then added to the stock. Vegetables should be 
finely diced or cut in thin strips, so that a very short length 
of time only will be required to cook them. The vegetables 
used to flavor the stock when first preparing will not take 
the place of vegetables served in the soup. The first are 
used for flavor only. The second to serve in the soup and 
to give additional flavor.

How to Prepare Nourishing Soups Without 

Stocks 

Soups without stock include all cream soups, chowders 
and purees. This type of soup is both substantial a d 
nourishing and is served at luncheon or where the meal to 
follow is not hearty. Or cream soups may be served for 
informal dinners to furnish a substantial dish so that the 
dinner itself will not require so generous an amount of the 
more expensive meat or meat substitute. Cream soups 
and chowders are both popular and very easily made. 

The foundation of a cream soup is a thin white sauce; 
cooked vegetable pulp or puree is added for flavor. The 
careful housewife will plan in advance to cook sufficient 
vegetables at a previous meal to prepare these soups. 
Many times left-over vegetables are improved by further 
cooking, since in order to make really good cream soup the 
vegetables should be so soft that they will easily pass 
through a sieve or puree strainer. The outer leaves of 
celery, the tough ends of asparagus, the discarded leaves of 
lettuce, will all give sufficient flavor to make a delicate, 
appetizing cream soup. Vegetables that would otherwise 
be thrown away may be utilized most satisfactorily in this 
manner. When possible use the liquor in which the 
vegetables were cooked, together with milk when making 
the foundation white sauce, as it adds more flavor. Strictly 
speaking, cream soups should contain only pureed vege- 
tables, meats or fish, but are more substantial if a part 
of the ingredients used are chopped very fine and added to 
the soup. When using canned vegetables for making soups 
the liquor should be discarded whenever possible, as it 
usually imparts a "canned" taste not at all palatable. The 
exceptions would be corn and tomatoes. These soups are 
improved if a small quantity of whipped cream is added 
just before serving, or a teaspoon of the whipped cream 
may be used as a garnish for each service. 

When preparing cream soups the vegetables should be 
rubbed through a coarse seive and heated before making 
the white sauce. The sauce should be made just before 



[58] MRS. DE GRAF'S COOK BOOK 

serving time and then the two ingredients combined. 
Cream soups will not curdle if made by this method. If 
allowed to stand any length of time they are apt to 
separate, so should not be made until required. 

Purees are usually made of vegetables such as dried 
beans, dried peas or potatoes and are a form of cream soup 
and very nutritous. 

A puree should be about as thick as a cream soup, there- 
fore but little thickening is needed ; but it will separate if no 
thickening is used. 

Bisques are made of fish, usually shell fish. They have 
as a base a thin sauce. Clams, oysters or diced lobster or 
crab are added to a white sauce and the whole well 
seasoned. 

Chowders are very substantial and are almost a meal in 
themselves when served with bread and butter. These 
soups make a very satisfactory luncheon or supper dish.

[64] MRS. DE GRAF'S COOK BOOK 

Breakfast One of the Important Events 
of the Day 

REAKFAST in most homes is, without doubt, the 
simplest meal of the day and one requiring the 
least thought and effort in preparation. But 
when we consider the fact that breakfast is 
also the first meal of the day and is the one that should 
furnish the necessary food principles to the body to aid it 
in starting and carrying on the work for the day, we can 
readily understand the importance of this meal and why 
it is necessary to begin the day with proper food. By 
this is meant a meal containing the essential food ele- 
ments to furnish heat and energy and to repair and build 
the muscles and tissues that are constantly being worn out. 

The right food leads to efficiency in one's work, for the 
body, like an engine, must have fuel, which is furnished 
by the food we eat. And if the food is not of the proper 
kind to supply the bodily needs it is going to suffer from 
lack of fuel. 

Of course, several factors, such as age, sex, muscular 
activity and climate, determine to a large extent the 
amount and kind of food required by different individuals. 
For instance, a man doing hard, muscular labor out of 
doors would require more food and food containing more 
of the muscle building qualities, such as meat or eggs; 
while a man doing office work would need less food be- 
cause his muscular activity is not so great and, working 
indoors, he does not require so much of the heat pro- 
ducing foods. It is often remarkable the amount of food 
growing children eat, but the active child requires energy 
giving foods, particularly if much time is spent out of 
doors in active play. 

The right kind of food, properly prepared, keeps the 
body in a healthful condition. And a healthy body is 
able to resist and throw off disease; an undernourished 
body is very susceptible to germs and will not recover 
from a severe illness so readily as one that is properly 
nourished and kept in a resistant condition. 



MRS. DE GRAF'S COOK BOOK [65] 

Many persons consider breakfast of so little importance 
that they omit this meal entirely. This seems a mistake, 
for in the morning the stomach is practically empty and, 
in order "to start the day right," some food should be 
taken unless for some good reason a physician has advised 
otherwise. 

Again, breakfasts are often eaten very hurriedly, which 
is wrong. In order to receive the greatest benefit from 
the food, it should be thoroughly broken up in the mouth 
so that the digestive juices may begin their action. If 
food is not broken up before entering the stomach it 
must be done there, and this means a strain on that organ; 
overwork will gradually cause it to weaken; so in time the 
stomach will not be able to perform its functions properly. 

It may seem difficult to get the variety in our breakfast 
menus that the large number of luncheon and dinner dishes 
afford, because there is a limited number of so-called 
typical breakfast dishes. But there is an endless variety 
of methods of preparing these different foods, so that there 
is really no need of monotony at this meal. 

Fruit, toast, cereal and coffee is the breakfast of the 
average city dweller; eggs, creamed dishes, ham, bacon, 
etc., for those who require a hearty meal. 

Fruit is valuable in the diet for the acid and minerals 
it furnishes the body, and also to act as body regulators. 
Taking fruit on an empty stomach is more effective than 
when eaten after a heavy meal. The acids in fruits act as 
a stimulant and aid digestion. When cereal is served it 
may furnish the principal part of the meal, for it furnishes 
starch, the heat and energy producing food, as well as 
the minerals that are so necessary to the body. If properly 
cooked cereals are very palatable and very easily digested. 

Cocoa, chocolate or milk supplies a food drink and taken 
with toast or rolls and butter constitutes a light meal. 

Eggs and meat furnish the tissue building elements. 

With the many different kinds of fruits and cereals and 
the various methods of preparing them the housewife 
should be able to have almost as wide a variety of dishes 
for her breakfast menus as for luncheon and dinner. 



[66] MRS. DE GRAF'S COOK BOOK 

Cereals the Fuel 

Cereals are fuel foods and when properly cooked about 
90 per cent of the organic matter is assimilated. They 
supply actual nutriment to the body more economically 
than any other class of food. 

Wheat, corn, rice and oats are the most widely used; 
oats and cornmeal, having more fat than other cereals, 
are particularly desirable for winter foods, although ex- 
perience has proved that oatmeal mush is acceptable for 
active children all the year round. Cornmeal and oats 
are valuable when the menu lacks meat. Many cereals 
contain protein, which, together with the starch, make 
them of great food value; in fact, they contain in varying 
proportions all the essential qualities to support life. 
One of their greatest values lies in the mineral salts they 
supply. These salts are essential in the diet of growing 
children for their bone building qualities. 

Because they are rich in starch, cereals must be thor- 
oughly cooked. It is safe to double the time for cooking 
as directed on the package. When they are not sufficiently 
cooked it is difficult for the digestive juices to penetrate 
the raw starch, and the body will not get the full benefit 
of the heat and energy this food contains. 

Cereals should be cooked in a quantity of boiling water, 
the amount varying with the kind of cereal to be cooked. 

The coarser the grain, the more water required for 
cooking. Whole or coarse grains are improved and require 
less time for cooking by soaking in cold water; very fine 
grains may be mixed with cold water before adding to the 
boiling water to prevent the formation of lumps. All 
others should be added slowly to the boiling water, stirring 
constantly. Cook directly over the flame until boiling 
point is reached and boil five minutes. Then place over 
hot water, cover closely and cook the required length of 
time. A double boiler is a necessity when a fireless cooker 
is not used. It is impossible to cook cereal properly 
directly over the flame for any length of time, for it will 
burn before the cereal has cooked sufficiently. Cereals 
should be cooked stiffs enough to chew. The fireless cooker 



MRS. DE GRAF'S COOK BOOK [67] 

is an excellent medium for cooking cereals. The longer 
they are cooked the more digestible and palatable they 
will be. 

When cereals are to be used in the form of gruels for 
children and invalids the cooking is more important than 
when used by people in normal health. It should be 
cooked much longer, then strained to remove all of the 
tough outer coat of the grains. To this strained mush is 
added milk to make the desired consistency — a very thin 
gruel for young children, and of a thicker consistency for 
invalids or elderly persons if to be eaten from a spoon. It 
is most important that the cooking be long enough to 
change the starch to a nearly soluble condition, otherwise 
it will be indigestible. A good rule is to cook them until 
the cereal forms a jelly-like mass. If cereals are to be 
eaten every day offer a variety. The family may easily 
tire of one kind served too often. Most cooked cereals 
may be molded, sliced and fried, and served with syrup 
or eaten with meats to take the place of vegetables. A 
portion of cooked cereal may replace an equal amount of 
flour in making muffins or griddle cakes. 

Uncooked cereals are often used as a base for steamed 
puddings or cookies. 

Keep cereals in a cool dry place, closely covered to 
protect them from dust. 

General Directions for Cooking All Breakfast Cereals 

Put water in upper part of a double boiler; add salt 
and when boiling rapidly slowly add the cereal so as not 
to retard boiling Stir constantly, cooking directly over 
the flame for 5 minutes; then set over the hot water or in 
the fireless and cook without stirring and closely covered 
for the required length of time.

Boiled Rice 

Wash rice in several waters until, when rubbed between 
the hands in clear water, no further cloudiness appears. 

Cook in an abundance of rapidly boiling water, using at 
least four times as much water as rice. Add the rice to the 
boiling water a little at a time so as not to lower the tem- 
perature. Boil from 15 to 30 minutes, or until the rice 
is tender, then add salt. The time required for cook- 
ing depends upon the age of the rice. The older the rice 
the longer it will take to cook until soft. The boiling 
should be so violent as to keep the rice agitated and the 
grains well separated from one another. 

To test, press a few grains between the fingers, and when 
it is soft all through drain the rice through a colander and 
set over steam or in a moderate oven for a few minutes to 
dry. If it is found necessary to stir while boiling, use a 
fork, stirring gently so the kernels will not be broken. If the 
rice has been well cooked, even when cold each kernel 
should be dry and distinct. Before adding boiling water 
to the kettle, grease the bottom of the utensil and the 
rice will never stick. 

The water left from boiled rice has far too much starch 
to be wasted. It makes a very good starch for very sheer 
materials. Cooked down until thick, it makes a good 
foundation for all kinds of soups or sauces. If allowed to 
cool, it will form a jelly. This water should be used at 
once, for it sours very quickly.

Food Value and Various Ways of 
Serving Eggs 

Eggs contain water, mineral and two chief elements of 
nutrition, protein and fat. The protein of eggs is more 
easily digested than that of meat. For that reason eggs 
should be used freely during the summer, particularly 
in sections where the weather is hot. 

Being a highly concentrated food, eggs lack bulk, so 
should be served with foods that supply this need. 

Eggs are really a necessity with the average family, and 
there is no other article of food more indispensable to the 
art of cookery. They are used to thicken sauces and 
custards; to clarify soups; to keep a coating of crumbs on 
all breaded foods, such as cutlets, croquettes, etc.; to leaven 
sponge cakes; to make souffles puffy and light; doughs and 
batters firm in texture — in fact, the use is almost limit- 
less. It may seem a very ordinary process just to boil eggs; 
however, comparatively very few people do this correctly. 

Cooking at a low temperature is absolutely essential if 
eggs are to be rendered digestible. Raw eggs are very 
easily and quickly digested. Heated to about 134 degrees 
F. the white of the egg will be a semi-liquid, the yolk 
liquid, very easy to digest. Heated to 160 degrees F. 
the white of the egg will be of a tender jelly-like consist- 
ency, the yolk soft, also easily assimilated. Heated to 
212 degrees F., or the boiling point, and kept at this 
degree of heat for several minutes, the yolk becomes hard, 
the white tough and difficult to digest. Cooked for any 
length of time at the boiling point they become very 
hard and tough and decidedly indigestible. These facts 
are worthy of consideration, particularly if you are cooking 
for children, elderly persons or those with weak stomachs. 
These principles will apply to all egg cookery. 

When other ingredients are used in combination with 
any number of eggs the heat must be moderate if the 
result is to be successful. Custards, timbales, sponge 
cakes, ometlets, etc., all are tough if cooked at a high 
temperature. During the spring and summer when eggs 



MRS. DE GRAF'S COOK BOOK [71] 

are not so high in price the thrifty housewife will pack them 
for use during the winter months. Of course, perfectly 
fresh eggs have the best flavor and for table use the packed 
eggs will never be as palatable as fresh ones. But for 
making cakes, muffins, griddle cakes, custards, puddings, 
etc., the packed eggs will be just as satisfactory as the 
fresh and at one-half the price. With a case or more of 
packed eggs, a small family may have, at a moderate cost, 
their favorite cake or pudding, the crisp, tempting waffles, 
cream puff's, popovers or omelets with just as satisfactory 
results as if made from fresh eggs. There is a prejudice 
against packed or cold storage eggs which should not 
exist. 

The practical housekeeper realizes their value for cook- 
ing purposes and knows that it is not logical to use these 
eggs for the table, for their flavor is impaired; but, com- 
bined with other ingredients, this lack of flavor has no 
disadvantage. 

Eggs may also be used to replace meat. There are few 
persons who do not like them, but if served in the same 
way too often, egg dishes become monotonous. There are 
many dishes, ofi^ering unlimited variety, which should be 
found on the weekly menu. 

Soft and Hard Cooked Eggs 

To cook eggs soft they should be dropped into a kettle 
containing enough boiling water to completely cover them 
and allow them to stand in the hot water for 10 minutes, 
having the kettle closely covered and no fire under the 
kettle. This will give you the soft egg with the white 
cooked to a jelly-like consistency. If desired cooked 
longer, keep a very low fire so that the water will not reach 
the boiling point and cook 12 to 15 minutes. Cooked in 
this manner the egg will be firm but mealy, not tough, and 
is digestible. 

Or cover eggs with cold water and when boiling point 
is reached remove from the fire. They will be just right 
for soft cooked eggs. If desired medium or hard, let stand 
from 10 to 15 minutes in the hot water. Keep kettle 
closely covered and in a warm place on the stove or over 
the lowest heat possible sufficient to keep the water hot 



[72] MRS. DE GRAF'S COOK BOOK 

only. If eggs are to be used for salad or garnishes, let 
them cook under the boiling point half an hour. Plunge 
into cold water at once so the yolk will not turn dark. 

Poached Eggs 

To poach eggs, fill a deep frying pan ^ full of water, add 
}4 teaspoon of salt. When water is boiling, break egg in a 
saucer and carefully lower into the water. Baste the yolks 
once or twice to cook the tops. The water should not boil 
after the eggs have been added, but kept at the simmering 
point. Cook until the white is firm, then remove carefully 
with a perforated spoon or skimmer to slices of buttered 
toast. 

Poached Eggs with Spinach 

2 cups of cooked spinach, 4 poached eggs. 

chopped fine. 2 tablespoons grated cheese. 

3^ cup of medium white sauce. 

For sauce melt 1 tablespoon of butter or substitute, add 
1 tablespoon of flour; mix until smooth and free from 
lumps; set over fire and cook until frothy; add 3^ cup cold 
milk and cook, stirring constantly until thick; season with 
}/2 teaspoon salt, 3^ teaspoon pepper; mix spinach and 
white sauce and heat thoroughly; turn onto a serving 
platter and flatten down with spoon. Place poached eggs 
on top, sprinkle with grated cheese, set in the oven a few 
seconds to partially melt cheese. Garnish with toast 
points and serve. 

Scrambled Eggs 

Scrambled eggs, when properly cooked, are a delicious 
creamy dish; if cooked at a high temperature they become 
a stringy mass which is neither palatable nor easily di- 
gestible. A very easy way to prepare scrambled eggs is 
to use the double boiler and cook the eggs over hot water. 
If the result is to be a creamy mixture, care must be taken 
not to cook them too long. 

Scrambled Eggs with White Sauce 

H cup of medium white sauce. Salt and pepper. 
4 eggs. 

Make sauce, then add eggs. Cook slowly, stirring 
constantly until creamy. Serve on toast.

Eggs and Asparagus 

1 cup of asparagus tips. 4 hard cooked eggs. 

1 cup medium white sauce. 

Add asparagus tips to the white sauce; remove shell from 
eggs and cut in quarters; pour white sauce and asparagus 
tips on serving plate and arrange hard cooked eggs 
around the edge. Serve very hot. 



Fried Eggs 

To fry eggs use enough hot fat to baste the eggs as 
they are cooking, so that a delicate film will be formed 
over each egg. The fat should be hot, but not hot enough 
to brown the eggs at once or they will have a bitter, 
unpleasant flavor. 

Eggs Benedict 

For each egg allow 1 slice of cooked ham and 1 toasted 
English muflSn or round slice of toast. Poach eggs. Put 
ham on toast, then poached egg; pour over all a well- 
seasoned white sauce. 



Eggs Baked in Potato Cases 

Bake medium sized potatoes. When cooked split down 
the center lengthwise and remove the pulp. Beat until 
creamy or press through a potato ricer; season with salt, 
pepper and butter, adding a little milk to moisten. Break 
an egg in each potato case, then heap the mashed potato 
mixture on top with a spoon or force through a pastry 
bag. Bake in a moderate oven about 20 minutes. 

Baked Eggs with Mashed Potatoes 

Butter a casserole or baking dish. Fill with hot mashed 
potatoes. With a tablespoon make 4 depressions, each 
to hold an egg; brush over with melted fat, and drop an 
egg into each. Set in a medium hot oven until eggs are 
set and potatoes brown. 



[74] MRS. DE GRAF'S COOK BOOK 

Shirred Eggs Creole 

Make the Spanish omelet mixture. Put a tablespoon- 
ful of this mixture in either a greased individual baking 
dish, or a large one; place the eggs on top of this sauce, 
season and place buttered crumbs over top of egg. Bake 
in a medium hot oven. 

Eggs Marine 

For each service allow 1 egg and 1 tablespoon of finely 
chopped cooked fish; grease custard cups, add fish, 
sprinkled with salt and chopped parsley. Beat egg, add 1 
tablespoon of milk; pour over fish; set cups in a pan of 
boiling water and place in a moderate oven until eggs are 
firm. Turn out on a serving plate and pour a well-seasoned 
white sauce over all. Lemon juice should be added to the 
sauce for fish. Any cooked meat may be used for this dish. 

Curried Eggs 

4 hard cooked eggs. 1 teaspoon curry powder. 

1 cup of medium white sauce. 1 teaspoon onion juice. 

1 tablespoon shredded green 2 cups cooked rice, 
pepper. 

Prepare the sauce, adding peppers, onion juice, rice 
and curry powder, which has been moistened and mixed 
with a little cold milk. Heat thoroughly. Remove eggs 
from shell, cut in quarters. Pour hot mixture into a 
serving plate and garnish with the eggs. 

Stuffed Eggs 

Hard cooked eggs (as many as desired); cut in halves 
lengthwise, remove yolks; to the yolks add salt, pepper, 
chopped, stuffed or ripe olives, and thick mayonnaise 
dressing. Re-fill the whites, place on lettuce leaves and 
garnish with mayonnaise. Serve as a salad or appetizer. 

Eggs a la King 

6 hard cooked eggs. 2 tablespoons shredded green 

)/2 cup finely minced chicken pepper. 

or ham. 2 tablespoons shredded 

13^ cups medium white sauce. pimento. 

Prepare the white sauce; to this add the pimento and 
green pepper; cut eggs in halves lengthwise, remove yolk; 
mash, season and add the minced chicken; refill the egg 



MRS. DE GRAF'S COOK BOOK [75] 

white, piling the mixture high. The mixture can be easily 
forced through a pastry bag. Place stuffed eggs on a 
platter and pour the hot sauce over them. Serve at once. 

Creole Eggs 

1 cup tomato sauce. 1 teaspoon butter. 

1 tablespoon chopped olives. Yi teaspoon salt. 

1 teaspoon onion juice. \i teaspoon pepper. 

Mix well and simmer gently about 10 minutes. Grease 
4 custard cups, break an egg into each one, sprinkle 
with finely chopped parsley and set the cups in a saucepan 
of boiling water; cover and steam about 10 minutes, turn 
onto a heated serving dish and pour sauce around them. 

Baked Eggs with Cheese 

Allow 1 thin slice of bread for each egg. Grease a 
baking pan, set slices of bread on bottom of pan, break 
egg into a saucer and carefully slip onto a slice of bread. 
Sprinkle egg generously with grated cheese, season with 
salt and pepper and bake in a moderate oven until eggs 
are set. 

To Pack Eggs 

Fresh, clean eggs covered with water glass solution and 
stored in a cool place will keep in good condition for about 
a year, and if not perfect for boiling, poaching or frying, 
will prove an economy during the winter for all other 
purposes. Eggs packed in a solution of water glass are 
much better than the cold storage eggs. For packing se- 
cure large fresh eggs. They must be clean, but do not 
wash them, as this removes the natural coating on the 
outside of the shell. The water glass commonly used is a 
syrup-thick liquid about the consistency of molasses. 
Only pure water should be used in making the solution, so 
it is best to boil it. Then cool before mixing with the 
water glass, using 1 part of the thick water glass to 
9 parts of water. Measure accurately. Have the 
eggs carefully packed in clean earthenware crocks, glass 
jars, large kettles or wooden kegs or barrels. Be sure the 
container is sweet and clean. Cover with solution then 
cover container and store in a cool place. If kept in too 
warm a place silicate deposits on the shell, and the eggs 
will not keep well.

Omelets 

The muscle building qualities of eggs are utilized to the 
fullest extent in omelets, and, prepared in this manner, 
furnish sufficient bulk to satisfy the appetite. Omelets of- 
fer an unlimited opportunity for variety in combination 
with other foods, and are suitable for the main course at 
luncheon or the informal home dinner, as well as for 
breakfast. 

There are two classes of omelets, the French and the 
pufFy. The last named is best suited for substantial 
omelets. This type of omelet is considered somewhat 
difficult to make, and for that reason few housewives 
attempt to make them. Only a few precautions are 
necessary, however, and when these are thoroughly 
understood there should be no difficulty in preparing a 
variety of attractive, palatable omelets. The foundation 
omelet will always be the same, but it will take its name 
from whatever food is used in combination. 

For the foundation omelet there are a few points to 
carefully follow, and, if this is done, even the most inex- 
perienced housewife may be successful in producing a 
light, puffy omelet, which is delightful to behold, as well 
as to eat. Do not prepare the omelet until everything 
else to be served at the meal is in readiness, so that it can 
be carefully watched and served as soon as cooked. Put 
the frying or omelet pan over a very low fire to heat while 
preparing the omelet. For the "puffy" omelet a heavy 
pan will give better results, and do not allow the pan to 
get so hot that when the fat is added it will smoke and 
burn. The mixture is first cooked in the frying pan over 
a low flame. When a golden brown on the bottom finish 
cooking in a medium oven or in the broiler. 

Never use more than 4 eggs for a "puffy" omelet. If a 
larger one is needed, make two omelets. Unless your pan 
is very large, you will not be able to cook a larger omelet 
successfully. 

The main point to observe is to cook the omelet at a 
low temperature, otherwise it will not be thoroughly 
cooked, and if burned or even browned too much will have 



MRS. DE GRAF'S COOK BOOK [77] 

a bitter flavor. If not sufficiently cooked it will fall and 
be heavy, and if over-cooked it will shrink and become 
tough. The omelet should continue to rise and become a 
golden brown after going into the oven. 

When cooked remove from the oven, cut across the 
center halfway through, then fold over and turn on a 
heated platter. 

This gives the foundation omelet, which may be varied 
in a dozen different ways. 

When eggs are beaten separately as for the puffy 
omelet, the result will be a lighter but dryer omelet than 
when eggs are only slightly beaten together. For this 
reason a filling of creamy sauce or a tablespoonful of 
butter added just before folding add the desired moisture. 

Small bits of left-overs can be folded into the mixture to 
give flavor; a tablespoon of chopped ham or other meats, 
free from fat, bone or gristle; shredded green pepper; 
cooked peas, asparagus tips, flaked fish, cooked rice, etc. 
When eggs are very high a cupful of soft bread crumbs may 
be soaked in milk, then added to the omelet to give a 
substantial dish, making the number of eggs used serve 
more persons. 

A French omelet is cooked entirely in the frying pan 
over moderate heat. It is more of a breakfast omelet and 
does not lend itself to the variety possible with the puffy 
omelet. It requires some skill to cook properly. 

Water or milk may furnish the liquid. Water will 
produce a more tender omelet, while milk furnishes more 
nutriment. 

Foundation Puffy Omelet 

4 eggs, separated. }4 teaspoon salt. 

4 tablespoons water or milk. 2 tablespoons shortening. 

Beat egg whites until stiff; yolks until creamy; add liquid 
and salt to yolks, mix well; combine mixtures, folding 
carefully together. Melt fat in a warm frying pan and 
when medium hot, pour in omelet. Cook until brown on 
the under side, then finish cooking in a medium hot oven 
or in the broiler until firm in the center. Cut across 
the center about halfway through, fold and turn onto a 
serving dish.

CHAPTER FIVE 

FISH 

MEAT 

POULTRY 



84] MRS. DE GRAF'S COOK BOOK 



Fish Cookery 




jiSH must be well cooked to be palatable and 
wholesome. It is cooked sufficiently when the 
flesh separates easily from the bones. Fish is 
always tender. It is most essential that fish 
should be perfectly fresh, thoroughly cooked, and care- 
fully cleaned. If under-done, it is not eatable; if cooked 
too long, it is dry and loses most of its flavor. 

When perfectly fresh, the eyes of fish are bright and 
clear, the flesh is firm and odorless. 

Fish may be divided into three clases, namely, white, 
oily and shell fish. The white and oily fish may be served 
in place of meat; and in general, the methods of cooking 
fish are the same as those used in meat cookery. 

Slices of fish require but little attention. They should 
be carefully wiped with a damp cloth, or let the cold 
water from the faucet run over them, then wipe dry. 
Never allow fish to stand in water after it has been 
sliced. Whole fish, even when cleaned at the market, will 
require a thorough washing to remove all the blood from 
the inside of the backbone. 

White fish is not so nourishing as oily fish. In this 
type of fish all of the oil is contained in the liver, making 
the flesh somewhat dry. A rich sauce usually accompanies 
fish of this kind to supply the lacking fat. 

The oily fish, such as salmon, mackerel, etc., have the 
oil distributed throughout the flesh. Therefore this type 
of fish is more nourishing than the white fish. Both 
kinds are useful in the diet of the convalescent or persons 
suff^ering from indigestion, although the white fish is 
preferable for an invalid. 

In composition, fish is much like meat; but unlike meat 
in that it must be eaten soon after it is killed, as it deteri- 
orates very quickly. It is difficult to keep fish in the house 
either before or after cooking, as the odor is very pene- 
trating and other foods absorb it. If put into the refriger- 
ator uncovered it contaminates all other foods. But if 
placed in a covered pail which is kept for this purpose, the 
odor will not penetrate to the other foods. 



MRS. DE GRAF'S COOK BOOK [85] 

All of the various methods of cooking may be applied 
to fish — baking, frying, sauteing, boiling, steaming and 
broiling. The principal thing is to be sure that the fish 
is thoroughly cooked and still not over-cooked. It is 
really important to keep a set of utensils to use for cooking 
fish only, as the flavor is so distinct that even the most 
careful washing does not always remove it. A frying pan 
seems to be the most difficult utensil from which to remove 
this odor. 

Frying, sauteing and broiling are the most popular 
methods of preparing fish. All fish are greatly improved 
for serving if the bones are removed. A boned fish, stuffed 
and baked, and served with a suitable sauce, is most 
appetizing and will usually be relished even by persons 
who ordinarily refuse fish. 

Then, too, many attractive dishes can be made from the 
left-over fish, and to many persons these dishes appeal 
more than when the fish is freshly cooked. 

It is less wasteful to steam fish than it is to boil it. 
However, it is possible when boiling to add flavoring 
which will make the fish more palatable. In boiling a 
fish add 1 teaspoon of salt and 1 tablespoon of vinegar 
to every 2 quarts of water and use enough water to 
entirely cover the fish. Vinegar tends to make the flesh 
firm. Soup vegetables, a clove or a bit of bay leaf may 
also be added to the water in which the fish is cooked. Do 
not pour cold water over the fish, as it will draw out the 
juices; have the water hot but not boiling, then bring to 
the boiling point and simmer gently until the flesh will 
leave the bones and is tender. Ten minutes' cooking may 
be allowed for each pound of fish, after the water has 
reached the simmering point. 

Fish will hold its shape and can be handled easier if 
wrapped in a piece of cheese cloth before placing in the 
hot water. A rack or plate should be placed on the bottom 
of the kettle to prevent the fish from sticking and possibly 
burning. Always serve a salad (green preferred) with a 
French dressing or slices of lemon with all fish dishes. 
If sauces are used, they should be seasoned with lemon 
juice. 



[86] MRS. DE GRAF'S COOK BOOK 

Shellfish 

Shellfish are divided into two classes. Clams, oysters, 
scallops and mussels belong to one class, and lobsters 
crabs, shrimps and crawfish belong to another class. 

Oysters are the most important of the shellfish, although 
shrimps are higher in food value. Both clams and oysters 
are more easily digested if eaten raw. With the exception 
of the lobster all fish are easy to digest, although the lean 
fish is more readily assimilated than the fat. The flesh of 
the lobster is coarse, dense and difficult of digestion. 

Escalloped Fish 

Place alternating layers of fish and soft bread crumbs in 
a buttered baking dish, covering the whole with milk or 
a thin white sauce. Season with salt and pepper and 
bake until firm. Variety may be given this dish by 
using tomato sauce instead of milk. 

Fish Pie 

Fill a baking dish with well-seasoned creamed fish, 
then cover with mashed potatoes and bake until potatoes 
are a golden brown. 

Baked Fish with Stuffing 

Prepare a bread stuffing, fill the opening two-thirds 
full and then sew firmly. Cut two or three gashes in the 
side of the fish and lay a piece of salt pork in each gash. 
Dredge fish with flour, sprinkle with salt and pepper, 
lay on a rack or a piece of cheese cloth in a baking pan. 
Bake 15 minutes for each pound of fish, basting fre- 
quently. The pork should supply sufficient fat for 
basting; if not, add a very little water. 

Baked Fish 

Chop 1 small onion and yi green pepper very fine, 
brush fish over with melted fat, place in the baking pan, 
pile the onion and green pepper on top, season well and 
bake. By baking on a piece of cheese cloth the fish can 
easily be removed from the pan without breaking. 



MRS. DE GRAF'S COOK BOOK [87]. 

Fillets of Fish 

Wash and dry fillets. Season, roll in fine bread or 
cracker crumbs, dip in slightly beaten egg diluted with 
1 tablespoon of cold water; dip in crumbs again, then 
fry in deep fat. Prepare all the fillets before beginning 
to cook any of them. Vegetable oil is the best fat to use 
for frying fish. Heat until a very slight trace of smoke 
can be seen, then test with a cube of bread. Drop bread 
in the fat and count 40. If the fat is right the bread will 
be a golden brown; if too hot it will be burned; if not 
hot enough it will not be brown. Test the fat each time 
before adding fish. Drain fried fish on brown paper. 
This is the best method for fr3nng fish. It will be crisp 
and if the fat has been properly tested the fish will not be 
oily. Serve with Tartar sauce or slices of lemon. 



Pan Fried or Sauteed Fish 

Prepare the fish as for deep fat frying, then cook in a fry- 
ing pan in a small quanity of fat. If sauteed without crumb- 
ing, the fish will break easily and will not present an appe- 
tizing appearance. Salt pork adds flavor to the fish and 
is the best fat to use for sauteing. 

Butter adds flavor but burns too easily. 



To Boil Fish 

Have water boiling. Add 1 teaspoon of vinegar to 
a quart of water, also a tablespoon each of chopped onion 
and carrot, a tiny bit of bay leaf and thyme. Lower the 
fish gently into the water and cook at the simmering point 
until tender. The time required is usually from 6 to 10 
minutes for each pound of fish. 

To Steam Fish 

Season fish with salt, pepper, cover top with thin strips 
of salt pork and place on a plate. Set in a steamer over 
boiling water, cover closely and steam 10 to 12 minutes 
for each pound of fish. 



[88] MRS. DE GRAF'S COOK BOOK 

To Boil Fish 

Wash fish, wipe dry and brush it over with melted 
butter or olive oil. Place on a double wire toaster or 
broiler and cook over hot coals or in the gas broiler. 
Turn every minute until both sides are a delicate brown. 
If gas broiler is used heat well before cooking fish, reducing 
the heat as soon as fish is placed in the broiler. Season 
with salt, pepper, a little onion or lemon juice. 

Creamed Fish 

For each cupful of diced or flaxed fish allow 1 cupful 
of well-seasoned white sauce. Sprinkle with finely 
chopped parsley or hard cooked egg. Serve in a casserole, 
ramekins or poured over toast points. Garnish with 
thin slices of lemon sprinkled with paprika. 

Fish Croquettes 

1 cup flaked or diced cooked 1 teaspoon lemon juice.

cold milk. Stir constantly until very thick. Season, add 
fish and pour onto a platter, spreading about an inch 
thick. Set aside to cool. When chilled shape into oblong 
croquettes, dip in crumbs, then in beaten egg diluted with 
1 tablespoon of cold water; dip in crumbs again, then fry 
in deep fat. To test fat drop in a cube of bread; it should 
become a goden brown while you count 40. Drain on 
brown paper and serve with a tomato or white sauce. 

Oyster Stew 

2 cups of oysters. 2 cups of thin white sauce. 

Cook oysters in their own liquor or water until the edges 
slightly curl. 

Have white sauce prepared and combine just before 
serving. 

For white sauce melt 2 tablespoons of butter, add

cook until forthy and add 2 cups of milk or half milk 
and half oyster liquor. Season and serve. 

Fried Oysters 

Drain and dry oysters. Sprinkle with salt and pepper. 
Beat 1 egg, add 1 tablespoon of cold water. Dip oysters 
in fine dry bread crumbs, then in the beaten egg, then 
in crumbs and fry in deep fat or pan fry in a hot frying 
pan in 2 tablespoons of fat. Test the deep fat with a 
cube of bread. It should become a golden brown while 
you count 60. Serve with lemon slices. 

Oysters and Bacon 

Drain and dry oysters. Roll each oyster in a slice of 
bacon and fasten with a tooth pick. Cook in a hot frying 
pan until bacon is crisp. Serve on toast. 

Creamed Oysters or Clams

frying pan. Add 2 cups of drained oysters. Season 
with salt, pepper and lemon juice. Shake the pan con- 
stantly until the edges of the oysters are curled. Serve 
on buttered toast. 

Steamed Clams 

Clams should be bought alive in the shell. Wash well 
in several waters to remove all sand. Put into a large 
kettle. Allow ^^ cup of boiling water for 2 quarts of 
clams. Cover kettle closely and steam until the shells 
are partially open. If liked a clove of garlic or an onion 
may be added for flavor. Serve with melted butter.

Meat 

Meat is one of the chief sources of tissue building (pro- 
tein) food. Its food value is high, and so unfortunately is 
the price. The average American housewife serves meat at 
least once a day. If the amount of meat is reduced, other 
food equally nutritive must be substituted. The problem 
with most housekeepers at present is how to keep the meat 
bill down and still serve palatable meals. This requires 
careful study and should include a knowledge of the 
different cuts of meat, the amount of waste and quality. If 
these points are not understood, it is not possible to pur- 
chase to the best advantage. And most important, the 
marketing should be "personally conducted," if the best 
results are to be obtained. To order by telephone often 
adds to the cost due to lack of details, such as thickness, 
exact weight or choice cuts, etc., which the dealer will not 
observe as carefully as the purchaser. Then again, the 
market man will probably take a personal interest in hold- 
ing your trade if he finds you know what you want, that 
you are familiar with the different cuts of meat and under- 
stand their qualities. 

The best method of cooking meat depends entirely upon 
the tenderness, texture and flavor. The tenderness will 
depend upon the connective tissue; tender, fine grained 
meats are taken from the least muscular parts of the 
animal and tough, coarse fibered sections come from 
portions which are most used. One-fourth of the weight 
of a dressed beef consists of the tender meat, and all of 
these cuts are expensive. The less tender cuts are just as 
nutritious; in fact, many of the cheaper cuts have more 
food value than the tender meat, but require more atten- 
tion in their preparation. If cooked properly, these 
cheaper cuts will be found juicy and palatable. 

The value of any cut of meat depends upon the quantity 
of waste, bone, gristle, etc. For example, the prime ribs 
are even higher than they seem, because the purchaser has 
to pay for so much bone; while some of the cheaper meats 
have so much waste in gristle, fat and bone that they 
would be equal in price to more tender cuts. 



[92] MRS. DE GRAF'S COOK BOOK 

All meat cookery is governed by two general principles. 
For tender, fine grained meats there should be intense heat, 
no liquid, and the meat should be seasoned after cooking. 
The high temperature sears the surface and keeps the 
juice from escaping. The meat is cooked quickly because, 
being tender, it would harden and become dry if it were 
allowed to remain in too great a heat for a long period. It 
is seasoned after cooking because the salt would tend to 
draw out the juices, which with tender meats is not de- 
sirable. Water is not added because it would cause steam, 
which would affect the brown, crisp surface of the meat. 
Plenty of fat instead of liquid should be used for basting. 

Coarse, tough meats require quick surface searing, long, 
slow cooking and a small amount of water. The meat is 
seared in order to retain the greater part of the juices, and 
then cooked slowly in a small amount of water and closely 
covered; it may be seasoned during the cooking process. 
The meat when cooked should be juicy, due to searing, and 
tender because of the slow cooking. 

To understand which method to use is the secret of 
economy in meat cookery. The best and most expensive 
cuts of meat are selected for roasting, broiling or pan 
broiling. The cheaper or coarser portions are made into 
stews, soups, pot roast, braised or boiled. The cheaper 
cuts of meat are just as high in food value as the more 
tender ones, thus offering the housewife the necessary 
variety. 

Meat which is dry and lean is much improved by the 
addition of pork fat, either salt or fresh. This may be 
added by placing thin strips over the upper surface of the 
meat, or strips of fat about half an inch thick can be in- 
serted through cuts made with a sharp pointed knife and 
extended clear through if possible. Or a larding needle 
may be used and strips of pork drawn through in stitches 
about an inch long. These stitches are taken at regular 
intervals over the entire surface of the meat. Take the 
strips of pork as near the rind as possible and cut length- 
wise with the rind. 

Red meats, such as beef and mutton, are more stimulat- 
ing than the white meat of poultry or veal. Beef is the 
most nutritious, mutton being second. Lamb and veal are 



MRS. DE GRAF'S COOK BOOK [93] 

less nutritious than the flesh of full-grown animals. Dried 
or smoked beef contains as much nutriment as the fresh 
meat, while corned beef loses in food value, the brine 
drawing out some of the juices. Aleat is too expen- 
sive a food to be thoughtlessly purchased or carelessly 
cooked, and the meat bill may be reduced by making more 
use of the less expensive cuts. 



Roast Meat 

Only the tender cuts of meat should be roasted. The 
following rules will apply to all roast meats: 

Wipe meat with a damp cloth, do not wash. Dredge 
with flour and if the meat is not fat some fat should be 
added. 

Place in a hot oven to sear the outer surface as soon as 
possible, thus preventing rich juices from escaping. 

When the surface of the meat is brown, the heat of the 
oven should be reduced and the cooking continued more 
slowly. 

A medium sized roast should be basted at least four 
times during the cooking, and at the last basting the salt 
and pepper may be added. 

Beef and mutton are roasted 15 minutes to the pound, 
veal and lamb 20 minutes. 

Pork from 20 to 25 minutes. 

An additional 15 minutes must be added to the cooking 
for the length of time it takes to heat the meat through, so 
that the time allowed for each pound is really after the 
meat is thoroughly heated. 

Perfectly roasted meat will be a rich brown on the sur- 
face. Beef and mutton should show a pinkish tint when 
sliced. Veal and lamb should show no pink. Mutton is 
encased in a thick skin which should be removed, as it will 
impart that peculiar flavor so objectionable to many. This 
skin is tough and when loosened at the edges can easily 
be pulled off. 



[94] MRS. DE GRAF'S COOK BOOK 

Yorkshire Pudding to Accompany Roast. 

y^ cup milk. y2 cup sifted flour. 

y teaspoon salt. 1 egg. 

Add salt and flour to milk and beat with an egg beater 
until mixture is smooth; then add egg unbeaten and con- 
tinue to beat about 2 minutes. Do not prepare until 
roast is cooked. Remove meat from pan and place in a 
warming oven or cover to keep hot. Pour batter in pan 
and bake about 15 minutes in a hot oven, basting with 
the fat in the pan after the first 5 minutes of cooking. Cut 
in squares, and use as a garnish with roast. This will not 
interfere with making a gravy if desired, although a fine 
cut of roast beef should be cooked so that the juice of the 
meat provides all the gravy needed. 

Broiled Meat 

Tender steaks, chops and cutlets, all fine grained meats 
may be broiled. They are cooked on the same general 
principles that apply to roast meat. They, too, must be 
subjected to an intense heat in order to sear the outer sur- 
face to prevent the loss of the rich juices. Have the 
broiler of a gas or lectric range very hot. If coal is used 
have a bed of hot coals with no flame. Rub broiler over 
lightly with fat. Wipe meat with a damp cloth; trim off^ 
all excessive fat and remove the skin from chops if the 
butcher has not done so. Reduce the heat of gas so there 
will be no danger of the meat catching fire. Place meat 
about 1 inch from the flame at first so that the meat will 
sear quickly. Cooking may be finished farther from the 
flame. Allow about 5 minutes for each side of a steak 1 
inch thick if desired rare; longer if to be well done, or if the 
steak is more than an inch thick, watch very closely. Have 
the rest of the dinner completely cooked and ready to 
serve so that the meat can be served at once. Place on a 
hot platter, pour melted butter over the top and sprinkle 
lightly with salt and pepper. 

Pan Broiled Meats 

Select only the tender cuts of meat. Heat a heavy 
frying pan very hot. Do not add fat; that on the meat is 



MRS. DE GRAF'S COOK BOOK [95] 

sufficent. Turn every 2 minutes until cooked. Place on 
a hot platter, pour over a little melted butter and season 
with salt and pepper. 

Planked Steak 

The meat is broiled just enough to sear the surface then 
placed in the center of a well-heated, slightly buttered 
plank. Mashed potatoes, vegetables, etc., must be pre- 
pared before the steak is broiled. Make a border on the 
edge of the plank of mashed potatoes forced through a 
pastry bag with a star tube, or arrange potatoes with a 
spoon. Brush potato with beaten egg. Place vegetables 
inside the potato border around the steak. Boiled onions, 
cauliflower, stuffed tomatoes or peppers, asparagus tips, 
almost any vetegable is suitable. Place in a very hot oven 
until the potatoes are a golden brown and the steak has 
finished cooking. Chopped meat may be shaped like a 
steak, broiled and cooked on a plank. Put bananas cut 
in thirds lengthwise over the top of the meat and garnish 
as for steak. 

Stuffed Steak 

1 flank steak. K teaspoon sage. 

1 cup soft bread crumbs. H teaspoon pepper. 

3^ teaspoon salt. 2 tablespoons grated onion. 

Mix crumbs and seasonings with 3^ cup of melted butter 
or substitute. Place dressing in center of steak, roll and 
tie or skewer in shape. Dredge with flour, place a few 
strips of bacon or salt pork over the top and place in a 
moderately hot oven; baste several times. Serve with a 
brown gravy, to which a few dried mushrooms have been 
added; or serve with a horseradish sauce. 

Broiled Flank Steak 

Purchase a flank steak. Place a few strips of thinly 
sliced bacon over it, then roll up like a jelly roll and tie 
firmly every 2 inches. Cut into slices about an inch 
thick, so that each slice will be tied in the center. Broil on 
each side about 4 minutes in a hot broiler, then finish in a 
hot oven. Garnish with banana fritters or sauted bananas. 



[96] MRS. DE GRAF'S COOK BOOK 

Pounded Round Steak 

Wipe meat with a damp cloth. Cut into portions for 
individual service. With a wooden potato masher pound 
a tablespoonful or more of flour into each portion. The 
pounding breaks the tough connective tissue and the flour 
absorbs the juices. Cook in a hot frying pan in beef 
drippings. 

Pot Roast 

This method of cooking meat is for the less tender cuts. 
It is really a type of braising, only a heavy, closely covered 
kettle is used on top of the stove instead of using the oven. 
Wipe meat and dredge with flour. Heat the kettle 
thoroughly, add 2 or more tablespoonfuls of drippings; 
some of the beef suet may be rendered for this purpose. 

Sear the entire surface of meat until crust is formed. 
Set a small wire rack on the bottom of the kettle, place 
the meat on the rack, add 1 cup of boiling water and cook 
under the boiling point for 3 or 4 hours or until meat is 
tender, about 40 minutes for each pound. When half 
cooked season with salt, pepper and an onion may be added 
or a bit of bay leaf and 2 or 3 whole cloves. Remove meat 
to a hot platter. If any liquor remains pour off". Add 2 
tablespoons of drippings to the kettle, add 2 tablespoons of 
flour, cook until brown, then add 2 cups of liquid; that 
which was left from the roast, and enough stock or water 
to make the required amount. Season with pepper, salt 
and a teaspoonful of kitchen bouquet, a liquid for seasoning 
and giving gravies and sauces a rich color. 

Braised Beef 

Braising is steaming meat in its own juices in the oven — 
a method suitable for solid pieces of meat not tender 
enough for roasting, but of better quality than those 
utilized in soups and stews. The retention of steam under 
a cover, together with basting with the broth, keeps the 
meat moist enough to permit the juices to flow, while the 
oven heat is intense enough to develop a rich flavor in both 
meat and broth. 

Three pounds of beef from the lower part of the round. 



MRS. DE GRAF'S COOK BOOK [97] 

2 thin slices of fat salt pork, or drippings, ^ cup of carrot, 
turnip, onion and celery, or onion only if other vegetables 
are not available. Try out pork and remove scraps or melt 
drippings. Wipe meat, sprinkle with salt and pepper, 
dredge with flour, and brown entire surface in hot fat. 
When turning meat, avoid piercing with fork or skewer, 
which allows the inner juices to escape. Place in deep 
heavy kettle or casserole, surround with vegetables and 3 
cups of boiling w^ater, add 2 whole cloves and a tiny bit of 
bay leaf; cover closely and cook about 4 hours in a very 
slow oven, basting every half hour and turning after the 
second hour. Throughout the cooking the liquid should 
be kept below the boiling point. 

When cooked remove the meat and strain the liquid 
remaining; remove vegetables, which are used for flavoring 
only. For each cupful of liquid allow 1 level tablespoon- 
ful of flour and 1 tablespoonful of beef dripping. Melt 
the fat, add flour, mix until smooth, then cook until frothy 
and add liquid and stir until mixture thickens. Several 
olives, green or ripe, or a tablespoonful of horseradish may 
be added to the sauce. If the water has not been 
allowed to boil, there should be sufficient liquid to make 
the sauce. 

Casserole of Beef 

Cut round steak or flank in pieces about 2 inches square; 
roll in flour and let brown in salt pork fat or drippings; 
remove to a casserole and add broth or hot water to cover; 
add more fat to the pan and in it brown a small onion for 
each service, add these to the casserole; cover and let cook 
about 2 hours, or until nearly tender. Cut 3 potatoes and 

3 carrots in cubes; parboil 5 minutes, then brown in a 
frying pan, add to meat yi hour before serving together 
with seasoning of salt and pepper. Serve from the baking 
dish or in individual casseroles. 



Boiled Beef 

Add meat to rapidly boiling unsalted water sufficient to 
cover. Reduce heat at once, cover closely and cook below 



[98] MRS. DE GRAF'S COOK BOOK 

the boiling point or at the simmering point until meat is so 
tender it almost breaks to pieces. Allow about 45 minutes 
cooking for each pound of meat. Drain and serve with a 
horseradish sauce. A very tough, inexpensive piece of 
meat can be made very palatable cooked in this manner. 
Sliced onions, carrots, etc., may be added to the water to 
impart flavor to the meat. 

Brown Beef Stew with Dumplings 

Remove all fat and gristle from \yi pounds of beef; cut 
into cubes. Dredge meat with flour. Heat 3 tablespoons 
of fat and add 1 small onion minced fine. Add meat and 
fry until well browned. Add 3 cups of boiling water and 
salt and pepper to taste. Cover closely and cook at 
simmering point about 2 hours. Fifteen minutes before 
stew is to be served add dumplings; cover closely and 
steam 12 minutes. For dumplings take 1 cupful of sifted 
flour, 2 teaspoons of baking powder, ^ teaspoon of salt 
and about M cupful of milk. Sift dry ingredients and add 
milk slowly, beating until smooth. Drop by spoonfuls over 
top of steaming hot stew, cover closely and steam 12 
minutes. 

Corned Beef or Boiled Dinner 

Wipe meat and put in a kettle. Cover with cold water 
and bring very slowly to the boiling point. Remove all 
scum and reduce heat to simmering. Cook until tender; it 
usually takes about 1 hour for each pound of corned beef. 
Prepare cabbage, turnips, carrots and potatoes for boiling, 
cut cabbage into eighths, removing all tough outer leaves. 
Cut carrots in halves and the turnips and potatoes in 
sizes to correspond with the carrots. Remove the cooked 
corn beef to a casserole or covered kettle to keep hot. Take 
fat off" of the top of the water the beef was cooked in; 
bring to the boiling point, add vegetables and cook until 
tender, allowing about 25 minutes. Do not overcook 
cabbage; it should hold its shape. Place meat on a hot 
platter, surround with potatoes, turnips, and carrots. 
Serve cabbage in a separate dish. 



MRS. DE GRAF'S COOK BOOK [99] 

Lamb 

Breast of lamb, while rather wasteful in appearance, is 
one of the most economical parts of the animal. It is 
always less in price than the loin or leg, and can be used in 
many different ways. The small, soft bones add flavor to 
this particular cut, which is not the case in any other cut 
of lamb. It may be stuffed and baked or breaded and 
baked, serving with a tomato sauce or made into a stew. 

Roasted Breast of Lamb 

Remove the outer skin from a breast of lamb and score 
in the direction of the rib bones, in pieces for serving. 
Dredge with flour, place 2 or 3 slices of salt pork or bacon 
over the top and place in a moderately hot oven. Turn so 
that all the surface will be well browned, reduce heat and 
cook until tender, basting several times. Serve with a 
tomato sauce. 

Lamb Stew 

Take 2 pounds of breast of lamb cut in small pieces for 
serving. Dredge with flour and fry a golden brown in hot 
drippings. Place in a covered saucepan or casserole, 
sprinkle with salt and pepper and cover with strained 
tomatoes. If one quart can is not suflnicient, add boiling 
water. Cover closely and cook slowly under boiling point 
until meat is tender. Can be cooked in the oven or on top 
of the stove. An hour before serving parboil 6 very small 
onions 5 minutes in boiling water. Add to meat, also 1 
cupful of cooked peas, cook until onions are tender. Thick- 
ening should not be necessary, but if the sauce is too thin, 
remove meat and vegetables to a hot platter and thicken 
the sauce with flour and water which has been well blended 
and strained. One tablespoon of flour should be sufficient. 

Boiled Lamb or Mutton 

Remove all the tough outside skin. Cover with boiling 
water and let boil 5 minutes, simmer until tender, about 
15 minutes for each pound; add salt and pepper when 
meat is half cooked. Serve with a caper sauce. The 
liquid remaining should be allowed to cool, then remove 
all fat. Heat slowly and simmer until reduced one-third. 



[100] MRS. DE GRAF'S COOK BOOK 

Finely chopped onion or soup vegetables may be added 
aboiit an hour before serving. Also a cupful of cooked 
pearl barley or rice. This makes a very palatable soup. 



Breaded Lamb Chops 

Wipe with a damp cloth and trim ofF all fat; sprinkle 
with salt and pepper; dip in fine bread crumbs then in egg 
which has been beaten and had 1 tablespoonful of cold 
water added. Dip in crumbs again. Fry in deep fat about 
8 minutes (see deep fat frying) or melt 3 tablespoons of 
drippings in a heavy frying pan and cook until crisp on 
both sides. 



Breaded Veal Cutlets 

Wipe with a damp cloth. Place in a frying pan, cover 
with boiling water and simmer about 10 minutes. Drain, 
dry, dip in fine bread crumbs, then in slightly beaten egg 
diluted with 1 tablespoonful of cold water; dip in crumbs 
again and fry in deep fat (see deep fat frying) or cook in 
melted drippings in a heavy frying pan until brown on each 
side. 

For cooking veal follow any of the recipes for cooking 
lamb. 

Shoulder of Pork 

Have bones removed from the shoulder of a young pig. 
Make a dressing by mixing 2 cups of soft bread crumbs, 
seasoned with ^ teaspoon each of salt, pepper, sage and 
a little chopped celery; moisten with H cup of melted 
butter and fill the space where the bone was removed. 
Take a few stitches with a larding needle to hold the dress- 
ing in place; dredge the meat with flour and place in a 
moderate oven; baste frequently. Peel an apple for each 
service. For 6 apples make a syrup of 1 cup each of sugar 
and water; cook the apples in the syrup, turning often and 
taking care not to break. When tender, remove to a pan, 
sprinkle with sugar and brown in the oven. Use as a 
garnish for the pork. 



MRS. DE GRAF'S COOK BOOK [101] 

Baked Ham 

Scrub a medium sized ham and soak in cold water over 
night. In the morning drain, cover with fresh cold water 
and bring slowly to the simmering point. Cook until 
tender or until a fork will pierce it easily. Take from 
kettle, remove all skin and trim off all undesirable portions. 
Stick the fat portion full of whole cloves and cover with 
brown sugar. Return to a moderate oven to brown. 

The ham may be boiled a day before required. It will 
take about 1 hour to reheat in the oven. A choice ham will 
of course be the best, but the small picnic hams or shoulders 
are inexpensive and cooked in this manner will be found 
very palatable. 

Tripe and Sweetbreads 

There are two varieties of meat that are first made 
tender by long slow cooking and then broiled. These are 
tripe and sweetbreads. Tripe is usually inexpensive 
while sweetbreads are considered a delicacy and bring a 
high price in most localities. Tripe may be purchased 
fresh or pickled. It should be covered with boiling water 
and slowly simmered until tender; then it is ready for the 
various methods of preparation. 

Sweetbreads spoil very quickly and should be cooked the 
day they are purchased. Soak in cold water at least an 
hour, changing the water several times; remove skin, 
veins, etc., cover with boiling salted water, add 1 teaspoon- 
ful of lemon juice or vinegar and let simmer until tender, 
about 30 minutes. Drain, cover with cold water for 10 
minutes, then wipe dry and they are ready to use for the 
various dishes. 

Broiled Sweetbreads 

Cut the cooked sweetbreads in halves lengthwise and 
brush over with melted butter and broil, having a 
moderate heat, about 5 minutes. Turn several times 
and baste with melted butter at least once. Place on a 
hot platter spread with creamed butter to which 1 tea- 
spoonful of lemon juice has been added. 



[102] MRS. DE GRAF'S COOK BOOK 

Broiled Tripe 

Cut cooked tripe In pieces for serving. Brush over with 
melted butter, dip in fine bread crumbs and set on a well- 
greased broiler. Cook about 6 minutes, turning twice. 
Spread with creamed butter seasoned with a little lemon 
juice. 

Braised Beef Tongue 

Use a fresh tongue. Place in a deep kettle, cover with 
boiling water and simmer for about 2 hours. Take from 
kettle and remove skin, roots, etc. Place in a deep baking 
pan and surround with % cupful each of diced carrots, 
onion and celery. 

Melt 3 tablespoons of drippings or butter; add 3 table- 
spoons of flour and cook together until well browned. Add 
3 cupfuls of the water in which tongue was cooked. Stir 
until thick, then season with salt, pepper, a teaspoonful 
of Worcestershire sauce and 3 tablespoons of finely 
chopped sour pickles. Pour sauce over the tongue, cover 
closely and bake in a moderate oven about 2 hours. Serve 
on a hot platter and strain the sauce into a bowl. The 
vegetables are added for flavor only. 

Kidney Saute 

Split kidneys in halves and remove all fat and tissue. 
Cover with cold water and heat over a moderate fire to the 
scalding point. Do not boil. Drain and cut into small 
pieces. Again cover with cold water and scald. Drain. 
Melt 2 tablespoons of butter or substitute, add 2 table- 
spoons of flour and cook until brown. Add 1 cup of water 
in which the kidneys were scalded or 1 cup of stock. Cook 
until somewhat thickened, then season with pepper and 
salt, 1 teaspoonful of Worcestershire sauce and the kid- 
neys. Stir until heated and pour over slices of oast cut 
in triangles. 

If kidneys are cooked rapidly, they become very tough. 
Cooked a very short time they will be tender, or they may 
be cooked a very long time and then will be satisfactory. 
They first become tough, but the long slow cooking 
makes then tender again. 



MRS. DE GRAF'S COOK BOOK [103] 

Bacon 

Have bacon cut In very thin slices and lay on the wires 
of a toaster or double broiler. This will keep each piece 
flat. Set over a pan in a moderate oven and cook until 
browned and crisp. Serve at once. The bacon may be 
fried in a frying pan. Turn often and have only a moderate 
heat. 

Liver and Bacon 

Pour boiling water over slices of calves liver and let 
stand about 5 minutes. Drain and dry each slice and dip 
in flour. Heat 4 tablespoons of bacon fat and fry the 
liver until brown on each side. Have only a moderate 
heat. If cooked too fast or too long, liver will be tough and 
tasteless. 

Broiled or Fried Ham 

Cover ham slices with boiling water and simmer 10 
minutes. Drain, dry and pan broil or cook in the broiler 
until a delicate brown. Have only a moderate heat. 
Cooked too fast and too long ham is hard and tough.

Selecting and Preparing Poultry and Game 

The proper selection of poultry is not an easy task. It re- 
quires experience, and usually it is necessary to depend 
somewhat upon the judgment and honesty of the dealer. 
In making a selection, see that the flesh is firm and that 
there is a fair amount of fat underneath the skin. The fat 
should be a yellow color. An overfat bird is not economical 
and, owing to the flesh being greasy, it is less digestible and 
delicate in flavor. 

When fresh and in good condition, the skin of a turkey 
should look clear and unwrinkled. When young, all 
poultry should have a flexible breast bone, smooth, pliable 
legs and soft feet. If the spurs are large, the legs hard, 
feet scaly, breastbone rigid and with long hairs, the bird 
is no longer young. 

The question of age and toughness aff'ect its palatability 
rather than the nutritive value. In fact, a tough old bird 
may be steamed or fricasseed and be found very delicious. 

Be careful to note that poultry is free from all dis- 
coloration and that the eyes are clear. Long, thin, 
purplish necks also denote age. Chickens and fowl have 
certain characteristics which make them easily distin- 
guishable. Chickens have soft feet, flexible breast bone, 
many pin feathers and a very small quantity of fat; fowls 
have hard and scaly feet, a rigid breast bone, long hairs and 
a large amount of fat. 

When a chicken is to be fried or roasted, the question of 
tenderness is of great importance. The size of a chicken 
usually indicates its age. The broiler will be small and 
more tender than the frying chicken, and the frying 
chicken smaller and more tender than the one for roasting. 
The more flexible the breast bone the more tender the bird. 

Young tame ducks have yellow feet and bills. As they 
become older these turn darker and become red. The wild 
duck has small reddish feet, either young or old. The legs of 
a young bird will be smooth and the webbing of the feet 
soft. 

The legs of geese should be pliable and yellow and the 
webbing of the feet soft. The bill also should be pliable, 



MRS. DE GRAF'S COOK BOOK [105] 

the breast plump and the skin smooth. Geese should always 
be eaten young. 

If the birds have not been dressed by the market man, it 
will be necessary to attend to these details. If freshly 
killed, a turkey should be kept for at least 3 or 4 days 
before cooking, or the flesh will not be white and tender. 
It should not be dressed until it is to be prepared for 
cooking. 

When dressing poultry, first of all remove all pin 
feathers. This may be easily accomplished with a pair 
of broad tweezers. Then carefully singe the bird, turning 
constantly so that it will be thoroughly singed in every 
part. Remove the head, then crop attached to the gullet, 
and the windpipe may be drawn out of the neck opening. 
It is usually not necessary to make a slit in the neck, and 
this should be avoided, as the bird will make a much better 
appearance if it is to be roasted. Cut off about 2 inches 
of the neck, so that the skin may be folded back. 

The neck trimmings should be saved for making stock 
for gravy or soup. The tendons should be removed from 
the legs, for when cooked they form a disagreeable hard 
substance. To remove, carefully make an inch slit length- 
wise through the skin below the knee joint and at one side; 
on laying open the skin, the tendons, white, shiny cords, 
will be seen. Slip a skewer or large nail under each one 
and pull them out. If the bird is old this will be found a 
little hard to do. 

Never allow the tradesman to cut off the legs of poultry, 
for then the tendons cannot be removed. 

When tendons have been removed cut off the feet. Make 
a 2-inch incision near the vent, insert two fingers and care- 
fully loosen the entrails. When all are loose, grasp the 
hardest subtance, the gizzard, and pull it out. Every- 
thing else will come with it, but be careful not to press any- 
thing; then there will be no danger of breaking the gall 
bladder. Insert the hand and remove the spongy sub- 
stances which lie under the breast in cavities; the kidneys 
will be found in similar cavities down the backbone. 

Let cold water run through the bird until it is thoroughly 
cleaned; then dry thoroughly and stuff at once. 

In cutting a bird for a fricassee, have sharp knives. Cut 



[106] MRS. DE GRAF'S COOK BOOK 

off the legs at the first joint, then separate at the second 
one. This is easily done if the legs are bent. Cut off wings 
and disjoint them. Separate breast bone from the back, 
divide back in 4 pieces, slit down the breast, cutting it in 
two. Each of these pieces may be cut in halves. 

To stuff and truss poultry for roasting, first put a little 
stuffing in the neck and fill in where the crop has been re- 
moved. Fold over the skin of the neck to the back and 
fasten with a small skewer or sew in place with a trussing 
needle. Then stuff the bird ^4 full through the incision 
made in drawing. Tuck the tail into the opening and sew 
firmly into place. Now remove the oil bag by cutting 
around it with a sharp knife. 

If too much stuffing is used there will be no allowance 
for swelling and it might burst through. 

Pinion the wing close to the side and run a skewer 
through each side or a threaded trussing needle through 
the wing and bird to the other wing. Take a stitch to hold 
firmly and then run needle back through the bird again 
and tie the thread so it may easily be removed. This will 
hold the wings in place. Fasten the legs in the same 
manner. 

To prepare the giblets wash the heart and cut it in two 
lengthwise. The gall bladder is a little green sack attached 
to the liver. Great care should be taken not to break it, 
as it contains a very bitter substance. Cut through the 
thick part of the gizzard, empty it and pull out the tough 
inside skin. Put the giblets and trimmings from the neck 
in a quart of boiling water. Cook until tender; then chop 
giblets fine, strain the stock and use for a sauce or gravy, 
adding the chopped giblets. 

To cut chicken for stewing or frying; After dressing 
remove tendons, pin feathers and the oil bag. Cut through 
the flesh at the thigh, bend back legs and cut off. Separate 
second joint and drum stick. Remove wings and cut off 
the tips. Cut through the ribs to separate back from 
breast. Cut breast in two with a heavy knife or cleaver. 

Roast Turkey 

Dress, stuff and truss a 10 to 12 pound turkey. Mix 
M cup of butter or butter substitute with ^ cup of flour, 



MRS. DE GRAF'S COOK BOOK [107] 

cream well and rub the entire surface of the turkey with 
the mixture. Place in a large roasting pan and put into 
a hot oven. When the surface of the turkey begins to 
turn a delicate brown, reduce to a moderate heat. Baste 
every 15 or 20 minutes. Add 2 tablespoons of butter to a 
cup of boiling water and use for basting. Allow about 
30 minutes' cooking for every pound of turkey. However, 
the time will depend largely upon the age of the bird. Old 
turkeys take long, slow cooking. 

Braised Turkey 

This method is suitable for an older, somewhat tough 
turkey. Prepare the bird as for roasting and with any 
desired dressing. Place several tablespoons of beef 
drippings or salt pork fat in the pan and allow it to melt. 
Then add a layer of the following vegetables cut in dice: 
Carrots, celery, onions, turnips and, if liked, one cup of 
tomato puree. Place the turkey on the vegetables and add 
enough stock or hot water to cover the vegetables only. 
Cover and cook in a moderate oven until the bird is tender. 
The time required will depend on the size and age of the 
fowl. Turn at least twice during the cooking. When 
cooked remove cover, dredge with flour and brown. 
Strain the stock, thicken and serve as a sauce. 

Roast Chicken 

Singe, dress, wash and dry a young chicken. Prepare a 
celery dressing of 2 cups dry bread crumbs, yi cup melted 
butter, Yz cup diced celery, 1 teaspoonful salt, Yz teaspoon- 
ful pepper and yi teaspoonful powdered sage. Stuff 
chicken, truss and rub over with olive oil or melted butter, 
dredge with flour and let roast until tender in a moderate 
oven, basting every 15 minutes. Add 2 tablespoons of 
butter to a cupful of hot water for basting. Serve with 
giblet sauce. As roast chicken is apt to be somewhat dry, 
it should be basted often or cooked in a double roaster. 

Chicken Fricassee 

Cut through the flesh of the chicken at the thigh; bend 
back legs and cut off. Separate second joint and drum- 



[108] MRS. DE GRAF'S COOK BOOK 

stick. Remove wings and cut off tips. Cut through the 
ribs to separate back from breast. Cut back into 3 pieces 
and breast in 2 parts. Roll each piece of chicken in flour, 
sprinkle with salt, and brown in melted chicken fat or salt 
pork. When each piece is a delicate brown remove to a 
sauce pan, add 1 cup of water to the pan and cook 5 min- 
utes. Pour over chicken with enough more boiling water 
to cover. Cook, closely covered, at the simmering point 
until chicken is tender. Remove chicken from kettle with 
a skimmer. Remove fat from liquid and add 1 cup of rich 
milk (more if needed). Allow 13^ tablespoons of flour for 
each cupful of liquid. Mix to a smooth paste with cold 
water, strain and add to stock and cook until thickened. 
Season with salt and pepper. Pour over chicken and 
serve with hot biscuits or dumplings. 

Chicken Casserole 

Cut up chicken as for fricassee. Roll each piece in flour, 
sprinkle with salt and pepper, place in a casserole and just 
cover with boiling water. Cook in a slow oven until 
chicken is tender. Add 1 cup of rich milk or thin cream, 
thicken slightly and serve. For thickening allow 1^ 
tablespoons of flour for each cup of liquid. 

Chicken Pie 

Cut chicken as for fricassee. Sprinkle with salt, pepper 
and roll in flour. Fry until a golden brown, then cover 
with boiling water or stock, and gently simmer until 
tender. Remove chicken to a baking dish, remove fat 
from stock, thicken, allowing lyi tablespoons of flour 
for each cupful of liquid. Cover chicken with gravy and 
place a flaky pastry on top. Bake in a hot oven. The 
chicken may be prepared a day in advance and set away 
in a cool place until required. If preferred all bones may 
be removed after chicken is cooked, then add to gravy and 
place on pastry. 

Stewed Chicken 

Cut chicken up and cover the pieces with boiling water. 
Simmer until tender, adding salt when half cooked. Re- 
move chicken to a hot platter and thicken the liquid, 



MRS. DE GRAF'S COOK BOOK [109] 

allowing 1^2 tablespoons of flour for each cup of stock. 
Mix to a smooth paste with cold water and strain. Cook 
10 minutes. Pour over chicken or return chicken to 
kettle and make drop dumplings. 

Oven Cooked Young Chicken 

Split young frying chicken or broilers. Dredge with 
flour. Place in a baking pan and dot with butter or 
strips of salt pork. Bake in a hot oven until a golden 
brown. 

Fried Chicken 

Unless very young and tender, chicken should first be 
stewed before frying. Drain and dry then sprinkle with 
salt and dip each piece in flour, then in slightly beaten egg 
diluted with 1 tablespoon of cold water; dip in flour again 
and fry in hot chicken fat, salt pork or butter. 

Chicken Maryland 

Prepare chicken as for fried chicken. When chicken is 
cooked remove to a hot platter. Make a sauce of 3 table- 
spoons of butter melted in the pan the chicken was cooked 
in. Add 3 tablespoons of flour. Mix until blended but not 
brown, add 2 cupfuls of rich milk or chicken stock; stir 
until creamy. Season with salt and pepper and pour 
around the chicken or serve in a separate bowl. Garnish 
with strips of bacon and corn fritters. 

Chicken Paprika 

Fry chicken and surround with paprika sauce. Garnish 
with toast points. 

Roast Duck 

Dress in the same manner as for chicken, wash well with 
salted water. Truss into shape with a larding needle or 
skewers. 

Place several stalks of celery inside the bird and set in a 
very hot oven. The time required for cooking is 18 
minutes if liked rare to 40 minutes if desired well done. 
There is a difi^erence of opinion as to whether ducks should 
be salted before or after cooking. It is really a matter of 
taste.

Souffles 




SOUFFLE is in reality a baked omelet in which the 
eggs have been beaten separately. The air which 
has been incorporated into the egg whites causes 
the mixture to pufF up. The general impression 
that they are difficult to make gives this dish a certain dis- 
tinction. However, there is no reason why anyone should 
not be able to make a perfect souffle if the oven is carefully 
managed. 

Souffles should go directly from the oven to the table, 
and it is a wise precaution to cover the souffle while carry- 
ing it to the table so that the cooler air of the room will not 
make it fall. The plain omelet souffle is the most difficult 
to make. Those made with a cooked foundation (a thick 
white sauce) do not fall so readily. The whites of eggs 
must be beaten until filled with air and should be folded in- 
to the mixture, not stirred or beaten. The souffle is then 
placed in a moderate oven, where the heated air expands 
and puffs up the whole mixture. The baking is con- 
tinued until the air cells are hardened enough to support 
its weight and the souffle must be served at once before 
the enclosed air cools, which causes the souffle to collapse. 

When sufficiently baked the souffle will feel dry and firm, 
like a sponge cake. Deep ring molds are very attractive 
for vegetable souffles. They may then be turned out 
on a serving dish and the center filled with creamed fish, 
sweetbreads, mushrooms or chicken. The vegetables are 
always previously cooked and either mashed or put through 
a puree strainer. 

Souffles may be divided into two classes, savory and 
sweet souffles. The savory souffle offers a variety of 
luncheon and dinner dishes in which many left-overs can 
be utilized. The savory souffles can be made entirely of 
eggs and vegetables or may have a thick white sauce as a 
foundation, making them much more substantial and also 
easier to bake. The fruit souffles are made of eggs and 
fruit pulp. 

All souffles, whether sweet or savory, should be served 
with a sauce of some kind. When mixtures contain a num- 



MRS. DE GRAF'S COOK BOOK [115] 

ber of eggs beaten separately, they are usually dry, and 
need a sauce to furnish moisture. 

Bake souffles in an ungreased dish (except when using a 
ring mold where it is removed from the pan), set in a pan 
of hot water, keeping water below the boiling point. Serve 
from the dish in which it was baked. 

Timbales offer a very satisfactory way to use small 
quantities of cooked food. They are really a savory cus- 
tard. Timbales are cooked by poaching and are unmolded 
before serving. 

Spinach Souffle or Ring 

2 tablespoons of butter or sub- 3^ cup grated or finely cut 

stitute. cheese. 

2 tablespoons flour. J/^ teaspoon salt. 

3^^ cup milk. }/$ teaspoon paprika. 

1 cup finely chopped spinach, or Few grains of nutmeg or mace. 

spinach puree. 3 eggs separated. 

Melt butter, add flour, mix until smooth, and cook 
until frothy; then add cold milk, stir constantly, until 
quite thick; add cheese, spinach, beaten yolks and season- 
ings; fold in stiffly beaten egg whites, pour into a baking 
dish, set dish in hot water and bake in a moderate oven 
about 30 minutes. 

Very attractive if baked in a ring mold and the center 
filled with creamed sweetbreads, shellfish, or chicken. If 
the souffle is to be unmolded it must be baked in a buttered 
form. Before unmolding let stand a few seconds after 
removing from the oven. To test run a sharp knife through 
the center. If it comes out clean, the souffle is cooked. If 
not cooked sufficiently, the souffle will fall. Any vegetable 
may replace the spinach. 

Ham, Chicken or Fish Souffle 

2 tablespoons of butter or sub- }4 teaspoon salt. 

stitute. 3^ green pepper finely chopped 

2 tablespoons flour. (may be omitted). 

1 cup milk. 3 eggs separated. 

}/2 cup soft bread crumbs. 
1 cup finely chopped ham or 

chicken or flaked fish. 

Melt butter, add flour, mix well and cook until frothy, 
then add milk and stir constantly until thickened. Add 



[116] MRS. DE GRAF'S COOK BOOK 

bread crumbs, ham, seasonings and well-beaten egg yolks. 
Remove from fire and fold in the stiffly beaten whites of 
eggs. Pile in a baking dish, set in pan of hot water and 
bake in a moderate oven about 30 minutes. Cooked vege- 
tables, such as peas or asparagus tips, may also be added to 
these souffles. In that case put a layer of the souffle 
in the baking dish, then a layer of the vegetable, then 
souffle until all is used. Serve with a suitable sauce. This 
type of souffle may also be baked in a ring, mold and the 
center filled with creamed vegetables. These combina- 
tion dishes are very attractive for guest luncheons. 

Potato Souffle 

2 cups well seasoned hot 1 teaspoon parsley, 
mashed potatoes. Few grains mace or nutmeg. 

1 tablespoon butter. 3^ cup of grated cheese. 

3 eggs separated. 

Melt butter in a saucepan, add mashed potatoes, 
seasonings and well beaten yolks; beat all together, then 
fold in the stiffly beaten egg whites. Bake in a rather quick 
oven. Cheese may be omitted. This souffle is not so 
delicate, so can be baked without the hot water. 

Asparagus Souffle 

2 tablespoons butter. 1 cup asparagus puree. 
2 tablespoons flour. 3^ cup asparagus tips. 
Yi teaspoon salt. \^ cup grated cheese. 
3/2 cup of milk. 3 eggs separated. 

Melt the butter, add flour, mix until smooth, then cook 
until frothy, add milk and asparagus puree. Cook until 
thick, then add beaten egg yolks and cheese. Fold in the 
asparagus tips, and the whites of the stiffly beaten eggs. 
Pour into a baking dish or individual molds, set in a pan 
of hot water and bake in a moderate oven until firm. 

Carrot Ring 

One cup cooked carrots rubbed through a coarse sieve; 
yz cup thick white sauce; 3 eggs, beaten separately; ^ 
teaspoon salt; }/^ teaspoon pepper. 

Combine carrots and white sauce; add seasonings. Beat 



MRS. DE GRAF'S COOK BOOK [117] 

eggs separately; add yolks, then fold in the stiffly beaten 
egg whites. Pour into a buttered ring mold; stand in pan 
of hot water and bake in a moderate oven until firm. Re- 
move from pan of hot water and let stand two or three 
minutes, then turn out on a serving platter. Fill the 
center with creamed veal, fish or chicken. Any vegetable 
pulp may be used in the same manner, adding seasoning 
suitable to the particular vegetable. 

Thick White Sauce 

Yi cup milk. 2 tablespoons flour. 

2 tablespoons butter or J^ teaspoon salt, 

substitute. 

Melt butter, remove from fire, add flour and stir until 
well blended. Set over fire, cook until frothy, then add cold 
milk and stir constantly until very thick. Add salt. 
Foundation sauce for souffles. 

Savory Timbales 

2 tablespoons butter. 1 cup milk. 

\i cup bread cnxmbs. 1 egg. 

i cup chopped meat or fish Salt and pepper. 

(veal, chicken, ham). 1 teaspoonful of grated onion. 

Melt butter, add bread crumbs and milk, cook about 5 
minutes, stirring constantly; add chopped meat and egg, 
beaten slightly; season and turn into well-greased custard 
cups or muffin pans; set in a pan of hot water and bake in a 
moderate oven about 20 minutes or until firm in the center. 
Do not allow the water to boil. 

After removing from the oven let stand a few seconds 
before turning from the molds. Serve with a sauce suitable 
for the kind of meat used. DiflTerent seasonings, such as 
chopped olives, pimentoes or mushrooms, may be added. 
Combinations of meat and vegetables also can be used. 

Vegetable Timbales 

Follow the recipe for savory timbales, using 1 cupful of 
mashed pureed vegetables. 



[118] MRS. DE GRAF'S COOK BOOK 

Meat Substitutes 

The meat course can easily be dispensed with by making 
attractive vegetable, egg or cheese dishes. Most doctors 
and dietitians claim that the average American family 
eat more meat than is required, so why not plan to have at 
least one dinner a week meatless? It will usually be found 
less expensive and the household would be benefited also. 

Of course, the family must be supplied with food fully 
as valuable to the diet as meat, and in order to accomplish 
this the housewife must understand a few fundamental 
principles governing the proper selection and combinations 
of food. 

The average housekeeper will hold up her hands in 
despair when food values are suggested, and to many the 
subject seems too scientific to grasp, and in a measure this 
is true. However, the following guide is not at all compli- 
cated, and the progressive housewife of today will do much 
better when planning meals, meatless or otherwise, if she 
thoroughly understands these principles. 

The body needs material to build up and repair the wear 
and tear caused by activity, also fuel to burn, making ac- 
tivity possible. 

Protein is a distinct repairing or tissue building material, 
and is found in quantities in meat, fish, eggs, cheese, milk 
and nuts. 

Carbohydrates (sugar and starches) and the fats furnish 
the fuel for activity, and include sugar, molasses, honey, 
ripe and dried fruits, starchy vegetables, and cereals. 

Foods rich in both protein and carbohydrates are peas, 
beans, lentils, oatmeal and wheat products; this includes 
all breads. 

The body also requires mineral salts, which are supplied 
mainly in the various green and dried vegetables, fresh and 
dried fruits. Bulk or quantity is furnished also in the last 
named foods. 

This, of course, only touches very briefly on the subject 
of food values, but a comprehensive understanding of just 
these few principles will prove helpful when planning meals, 
and a properly balanced meal need not be a complicated, 



MRS. DE GRAF'S COOK BOOK [119] 

difficult one to prepare, but may be of the greatest simplic- 
ity or may offer as great a variety as desired, provided they 
contain the proper combination of foods; in other words, 
some protein, some carbohydrates and fat, some mineral 
salts and the necessary bulk. 

The list of meat substitutes is a long and varied one. Eggs 
are fully as valuable as meat in both food value and digesti- 
bility. 

Beans or lentils may take the place of meat. Boston 
baked beans, if properly prepared, are usually popular- 
Stuffed peppers or tomatoes make satisfactory luncheon or 
supper dishes. 

The possibilities of cheese combined with other food 
materials are numerous and these combinations may be 
served in place of meat. Cheese has twice the food value 
of meat; there is comparatively no waste, and it has the 
advantage of keeping qualities and requires very little 
preliminary preparation. Even with the prevailing high 
prices, cheese will be found economical when compared 
with other foods of equal nutritive value. The different 
varieties of cheese are used chiefly for their flavor, and used 
in such small quantities, have very little value in the diet 
other than to make the meal attractive and palatable. 
Cream or soft cheese is usually served in this manner and 
is more easily digested than hard cheese. 

One reason, perhaps, why cheese is not more commonly 
used as a meat substitute is due to the fact that because of 
its concentration it is not easily digested. This, however, 
may be largely overcome by grating or cutting into small 
bits then melted with milk, or in combination with other 
ingredients. A very small quantity of baking soda is an 
aid in making cheese soluble. 

Cheese can be overcooked; it is hardened by high heat 
and care should be taken that the food materials combined 
with cheese be thoroughly cooked before the combination 
is made. If merely melted, cheese is probably as digestible, 
if used moderately, as many cooked meats; but when it has 
been overheated in cooking it usually contains burned fats. 
This causes indigestion, and the blame should not be laid to 
the composition of the food but to careless cooking. 

In planning menus of which cheese forms the main dish, 



[120] MRS. DE GRAF'S COOK BOOK 

supply crisp vegetables, such as lettuce, celery, fruit 
salads, and for desserts something light, either fresh or 
cooked fruits or gelatin, plain cookies or fruit shortcakes. 
If cheese is used in quantity it is necessary to diminish 
other protein and fat foods in order that the meal may not 
be too hearty. Vegetables and soups may be cooked with 
cheese, and in such dishes the cheese is added for both 
nutritive value and flavor. 

The housewife whose family is fond of cheese can find 
an almost unlimited variety of combinations. To keep 
cheese free from mold, wrap in a slightly damp cloth and 
keep cool. 

Boston Baked Beans 

2 cups small white beans. 2 tablespoons molasses. 

}4. pound fat salt pork. 3^ teaspoon dry mustard. 

2 teaspoons salt. 1 cup boiling water. 

Pick over beans, wash well, cover with cold water and 
soak over night. In the morning drain, cover with cold 
water and heat slowly, keeping water below boiling point, 
and cook until the skins will burst. This may be deter- 
mined by taking a few beans on a spoon and blowing on 
them. The skins will burst if beans are sufficiently cooked. 
Drain again, cut salt pork in two pieces, placing one piece 
in the bottom of the bean pot. Put beans in pot, place the 
other piece of pork on top of beans. Add seasoning to the 
boiling water and pour over beans, adding enough more 
boiling water to cover. Place the cover on bean pot and 
bake slowly about 6 hours. Add more boiling water as 
needed and uncover beans during last hour of baking. An 
earthenware bean pot produces the best results. 

Pink Beans, Spanish 

2 cups beans. 2 pimentos. 

1 onion. 1 tablespoon butter. 

1 cup strained tomato or 1 1 teaspoon salt, 
can chili tomato sauce. 

Wash and soak beans over night. Drain, cover with 
fresh boiling water and cook under boiling point for half 
an hour. Drain again, cover with fresh boiling water and 
cook gently until tender, or about 1 hour. Do not allow to 
reach boiling point. Chop the onion and pimentos, and 



MRS. DE GRAF'S COOK BOOK [121] 

cook in the butter until the onion is soft, but not brown; 
then add seasoning and tomato. Drain beans, pour over 
the sauce and simmer for about 30 minutes. Serve with 
boiled rice or hominy. If using chili tomato sauce the 
pimentos may be omitted, and if desired highly seasoned. 
Use 4 or 5 tiny dried red peppers or a few drops of pepper 
sauce. 

Rissotto No. 1 

1 cup rice. 1 sweet green pepper. 

1 cup grated cheese. 1 teaspoon salt. 

i°cip°* strained tomatoes or 1 tablespoon shortening, 
tomato sauce. 

Wash rice well and add slowly 4 cups of rapidly boiling 
water; boil 5 minutes, drain well and add to 4 cups fresh 
boiling water. Cook rice until tender, drain and dry in a 
moderate oven. While rice is cooking melt shortening, 
add chopped onion and pepper, and cook until heated 
through; then add tomatoes. Have a well-greased baking 
dish and put in a layer of rice, then sprinkle with cheese, 
and add a layer of the tomato mixture. Repeat, having the 
last layer cheese. Cover the baking dish and place in a 
moderate oven until cheese is melted. 

Rissotto No. 2 

Wash rice well and drain until very dry. Heat 2 table- 
spoons olive oil in a heavy frying pan; add rice and cook, 
stirring constantly until rice is somewhat golden in color. 
Cover with tomato sauce, add chopped onion and green 
pepper, and cook over a very low fire until rice is tender. 
Turn onto a serving dish and sprinkle with grated cheese. 
Serve at once. 

Cheese Croquettes 

2 cups any cooked cereal. 1 teaspoon mustard. 
1 egg yolk. 2 teaspoons salt. 

1 cup Eastern cheese (grated). 
1 teaspoon Worcestershire 
sauce. 

Mix well and cook 10 minutes, cool thoroughly and 
form into croquettes. Add 1 tablespoon of cold water to 
white of egg and beat slightly. Roll croquettes in bread- 



[122] • MRS. DE GRAF'S COOK BOOK 

crumbs, then in egg mixture, then crumbs again. Fry 
until brown in deep fat. To test fat for frying drop a cube 
of dry bread into fat and count forty. If bread is a golden 
brown by then, fat is ready to use for croquettes. Fry 
until brown, drain on paper. Serve with a tomato sauce. 
Green peppers may be stuffed with this mixture and baked. 



Poached Eggs with Cheese Sauce 

Prepare medium white sauce allowing one cup of sauce to 
four persons. Add one-half cup of grated cheese to sauce 
while hot. Toast rounds of bread on both sides; dip the 
edges in hot salted water and spread with butter. Set a 
poached egg on each slice of toast; pour the cheese sauce 
over the eggs and surround the whole with asparagus tips, 
or tomatoes which have been sliced rather thick, and 
dipped in batter or crumbs and fried. 



Macaroni and Cheese

small pieces. 1 cup milk. 

6 cups boiling water. Yi cup grated cheese. 

Yi teaspoon salt. Yi teaspoon salt. 

2 tablespoons butter or Y cup bread crumbs, 
substitute. 

Wash macaroni and cook in salted boiling water until 
tender. Melt butter, add flour; cook until frothy; add 
cold milk, stirring constantly until thick. Season. Put 
macaroni, sauce and cheese in layers in a buttered baking 
dish, cover with crumbs moistened with melted butter 
and bake in a moderate oven until crumbs are brown. 



Cheese Toast and Bacon 

Melt 2 tablespoons butter, add 2 tablespoons flour and 
cook until frothy, then add 1 cup cold milk, stirring until

The Use of Left-Overs 

Every housewife faces the problem of "left-overs." To 
utilize and prepare them into satisfactory dishes requires 
more skill and inventiveness than to cook the raw food, 
and this branch of cookery is an art in itself. The thrifty 
home-maker uses all the left-overs. Living has been much 
too high for the average person to ignore this type of 
cookery. 

Food can so easily be spoiled by reheating. Take meats 
for example. A tender piece of roast beef reheated for 
ten minutes will be tough. This applies to almost all 
cooked meats. If sliced very thin and hot sauce or gravy 
poured over the slices, the meat will be tender; but if 
added to the hot gravy in an attempt to reheat it will 
invariably toughen. Meat must be cooked a long time 
when reheating if it is to be tender, the theory being that 
it will toughen at first, but will become tender by long, 
slow cooking. For this reason the covered casserole dishes 
have become almost indispensable. 

A casserole is used for cooking foods that require slow 
cooking for either a short or long period. The dish is 
covered to keep in all the steam, and to retain flavor. 
Dicing food takes more time than chopping or putting 
through a food grinder, but if one has the time, diced meat 
will present a much more attractive appearance, as well 
as being more palatable. Diced meat or fish may be com- 
bined with a white sauce, adding cubes of cooked potatoes, 
several tablespoons of cooked peas and diced carrots. If 
meat is used, salt, pepper and onion juice can be the season- 
ing; if fish, add a little lemon juice also, or a finely chopped 
sour pickle. Or add the diced meat to a tomato sauce, 
seasoning well with onion and chopped green peppers, 
adding six or eight ripe or green olives. A meat pie is 
always acceptable. Dice meat, add to thickened, well 
seasoned gravy or sauce, adding cooked potatoes cut in 
cubes, and small boiled onions and any other left-over 
vegetables, such as peas, carrots, turnips or cauliflower. 
Place in a casserole or baking dish. Make a plain pie 
crust or biscuit dough for top and bake in a moderately 



[128] MRS. DE GRAF'S COOK BOOK 

hot oven. This may be prepared in the morning, and the 
crust made, but not added until the pie goes into the oven. 

Smaller quantities of left-over meat or fish may be 
chopped and made into souffles, timbales or croquettes, 
or added to a well-seasoned white sauce and served on 
toast, or in ramekins or a baking dish, the top covered 
with buttered crumbs and then browned in the oven. The 
white sauce, made of butter or substitute and milk, supply 
additional food value to take the place of the smaller quan- 
tity of meat or fish. 

One most important factor in the success of these dishes 
is in careful preparation. All bones, gristle, skin or tough, 
undesirable portions should be removed and discarded. If 
there are large meat bones, as in a roast of lamb, these may 
be broken — adding two or three cupfuls of cold water, also 
an onion. Simmer for an hour or more and use as a base 
for gravy or sauce. 

A cupful of chopped meat or fish will make a souffle, 
croquettes, timbales or creamed meat in ramekins for four 
persons. 

Left-over vegetables can be reheated in a white sauce, 
used for cream soups or chowders; scalloped, made into au 
gratin dishes, added to a fritter batter and fried in deep fat 
or used in salad. 

Almost any combination of vegetables makes an attrac- 
tive salad, providing it is accompanied with a well-made 
salad dressing. The left-over breakfast cereal may be 
molded, sliced, dipped in flour and fried a delicate brown, 
or half a cupful may replace the same quantity of flour in 
the breakfast griddle cakes or muffins; any fresh or cooked 
fruit can be mashed and poured over molded cold cereal 
for the children's dessert. 

Stale broken pieces of bread may be dried in a very slow 
oven, then rolled or put through the food grinder and stored 
in covered fruit jars. To be used in scalloped dishes, to 
bread cutlets, fish or croquettes. Or cut into very small 
cubes, dried in a slow oven for croutons for soup; made 
into dressing for stuffed poultry, meat, fish, tomatoes or 
eggplant. Any of the bread puddings are palatable, pro- 
vided too much bread has not been used. The old- 
fashioned custard bread pudding should not be made just 



MRS. DE GRAF'S COOK BOOK [129] 

to save bread, for that would not be an economy, as the 
other ingredients needed are too expensive merely to use 
up left-overs of bread. 

Small portions of cooked or raw tomatoes may make 
savory sauces. 

Sour milk should never be wasted. It can always be 
substituted for fresh milk in flour mixtures, using one-half 
teaspoonful of soda to each cupful of sour milk, omitting 
the baking powder; or the sour milk can be made into 
cottage cheese. 

All pieces of beef or chicken fat should be cut fine and 
carefully rendered to be used for frying. Fat left from fry- 
ing bacon or ham should be saved, but kept in a separate 
jar, as the smoked flavor is not desirable for all frying. 

Left-overs of fruit may be combined and used for salads 
or for dessert. Stale cake may be served for pudding, with 
the addition of a custard or chocolate pudding sauce; or 
the cake may be cut in finger lengths and used for char- 
lottes or charlotte russe. 

The greatest care should be given left-overs, so that 
they will be in proper condition to use later. Jelly glasses 
with covers are convenient for small portions of vegetables 
or fruit. 

The use of left-overs is unlimited, and while such cook- 
ery requires both consideration and time, the results will 
amply repay for the additional labor. 



[130] MRS. DE GRAF'S COOK BOOK 

Twice Cooked Meats 

Meat which is reheated or twice cooked is less nourishing 
than when first prepared because no matter how careful 
the cooking process, a certain amount of the nutritive 
juices will escape in the first cooking, although usually a 
portion of this is retained and served as a sauce or gravy. 
So the wise housewife prepares various savory sauces when 
reheating meat or fish, to overcome this loss of flavor and 
add to the palatability of these warmed over dishes. 

Twice cooked meat, if properly prepared, is very appe- 
tizing and not hard to digest — unless reheated in such a 
fashion as to render it tough and leathery. It is also neces- 
sary to bear in mind when preparing these various dishes, 
that the meat should never be actually twice cooked, but 
merely reheated. 

Whenever vegetables, sauces, etc., are to be added to 
cooked meat or fish, they should be thoroughly cooked 
before being combined with the ingredients to be reheated. 
The cooked meat or fish, when reheating, should be pro- 
tected if possible from coming in direct contact with the 
heat of the fire, oven or fat; which means that the reheat- 
ing process should be accomplished by adding the cooked 
food to a hot sauce, or be combined with other materials. 

The finer these cooked ingredients are the less time re- 
quired for reheating, and the more quickly will they absorb 
the sauce which is to give flavor to the dish. However, 
this does not mean to mash the meat or fish, but carefully 
chop it; also be careful to remove all bone, gristle and 
undesirable portions before chopping, and if cutting in 
cubes or slicing, have the pieces of uniform size, which will 
add greatly to the appearance of the finished dish. 

Any kind of cooked fish, meat and some vegetables may 
be used in making croquettes. Meat and fish croquettes 
are simply a finely chopped mixture combined with a 
thick sauce, then crumbed, shaped, dipped in egg, then in 
crumbs again and fried in deep fat. Whatever variety of 
meat or fish the rules for the sauce, molding and frying 
are the same. 



MRS. DE GRAF'S COOK BOOK [131] 

Lamb Curry 

Cut cold roast lamb in thin slices. Prepare a sauce by 
melting 4 tablespoons of shortening, add % slice onion and 
fry until a golden brown; remove onion from fat and add 
4 tablespoons of flour, yi teaspoon of salt, and 1 teaspoon 
of curry powder. Mix until smooth and add gradually 
2 cups of stock or warm water. Stir constantly until thick, 
then pour over sliced lamb. Stock can be made by adding 
a bouillon cube to water or using left-over gravy and water 
steamed before using. Garnish platter with hot cooked 
rice, molded in custard cups. 

Reheating Roast Beef 

Slice cold roast beef very thin and arrange on a warm 
platter. Just before serving pour a hot meat sauce or gravy 
over the slices of meat. If the beef is reheated and allowed 
to stand over the fire in the gravy it becomes tough. 

Corned Beef Hash 

Chop rather fine, equal quantities of cold corned beef, 
free from all fat and gristle, and cold boiled potatoes; heat 
about 3 tablespoons of shortening in a frying pan; turn 
in the chopped ingredients and add one-quarter cup of 
stock or milk and season with paprika; mix together, cover 
and let allow to brown, watching very carefully and stirring 
occasionally. Fold over and turn on a hot platter; pour a 
well-seasoned tomato sauce around the hash and garnish 
with baked bananas. 



Cottage Pie 

2 cups of diced cooked meat. 1 tablespoon of grated onion. 

1 cup of gravy or sauce. 2 cups of mashed potatoes. 

1 cup of cooked peas.

2 cups gravy or sauce. 2 onions sliced and cooked. 

]/2 cup sliced cooked carrots. 

Pour all ingredients in a casserole or baking dish. Cover 
with Yi of the biscuit dough recipe or with a plain pastry. 
Bake in a hot oven. 

Creamed Dried Beef with Spaghetti 

1 cup dried beef. 2 hard cooked eggs. 

2 cups white sauce. 2 cups cooked hot spaghetti. 

Cover dried beef with cold water and slowly bring to the 
boiling point and drain. Cut the hard cooked eggs in 
slices. Prepare the white sauce, season and add the 
dried beef. Arrange the macaroni on a hot platter and 
pour over the creamed beef and garnish with the slices of 
hard cooked eggs. 

Chicken and Oyster Pie 

Arrange slices of cooked chicken and oysters in layers 
in a large or individual baking dish. Add a little 
chicken broth or oyster liquor and season. Cover the 
top with flaky pastry. Prick pastry to let out the steam. 
Bake in a hot oven. 



MRS. DE GRAF'S COOK BOOK [133] 

Rissoles 

Make any croquette mixture and set aside to cool. Pre- 
pare flaky pastry, roll out and cut in 3-inch rounds with a 
biscuit cutter. Place a spoonful of the croquette mixture 
in the center of half of the rounds of pastry, brush the edge 
of the pastry with cold water and place a round of pastry 
on top, pressing the edges firmly together. Prick each 
rissole with a fork and bake in a hot oven. 

Meat, Chicken or Fish au Gratin 

1 cup meat cut in cubes. }/i cup bread crumbs. 

J^ cup grated cheese. J^ teaspoon salt. 

1 cup tomato sauce. 1 cup cooked rice. 

Butter a baking dish, place a layer of rice and diced 
meat alternately until all is used. Add salt to tomato 
sauce and pour over the mixture. Mix cheese and bread 
crumbs and spread over the top. Place in a hot oven to 
brown. 

Tongue Piquante 

Make a piquante sauce. Place thin slices of cooked 
tongue in a casserole or baking dish, pour over the piquante 
sauce and set in the oven to heat. 

Creamed Sweetbreads 

Two cups blanched sweetbreads cut in dice. One small 
can button mushrooms; make a sauce with 4 tablespoons 
of melted butter, 4 tablespoons flour, mix well and cook 
until foamy; add 2 cups rich milk or thin cream and stir 
well until thick and creamy; season with ^ teaspoon salt, 
a dash of cayenne pepper and ground nutmeg. Add sweet- 
breads and mushrooms. Serve in ramekins. 

To blanch sweetbreads soak 1 hour in cold water, drain, 
cover with cold water, add 1 tablespoon of lemon juice 
or vinegar, 2 or 3 cloves, dash of pepper and a tiny piece of 
bay leaf; simmer about 15 minutes; drain and remove 
fibers.

Deep Fat Frying 



Deep fat frying is a method of cooking by immersing 
food in very hot fat. If properly fried, foods cooked in 
this manner should not be unwholesome to persons in 
normal health. Vegetable oils are the best fats to use for 
deep fat frying because they can be heated to a higher 
temperature before the burning point is reached than 
animal fats. Fat should be heated until just an indication 
of a delicate blue smoke or vapor arises. If the smoke is 
decidedly perceptible, the fat is too hot for use. Heated to 
the point when the smoke can just be noticed and the food 
to be fried added to the fat, the temperature will be 
immediately reduced to the right degree of heat. To test 
the fat have several cubes of bread when the fat is hot, 
but not smoking. Drop in one of these cubes of bread and 
count 40, about as the clock ticks. If the bread turns a 
golden brown in that time, the fat is ready for mixtures 
that require heating through, such as croquettes, fish balls, 
fritters of cooked fruit or vegetables which have only a 
coating of thin batter. If the foods to be fried are un- 
cooked mixtures, such as doughnuts or fillets of fish, the 
bread should take 60 seconds to brown. The fat should 
be tested each time before the food is added. 

To heat, place the fat in the kettle, cover and allow to 
heat gradually, watching carefully. 

A heavy kettle is always an advantage, as it may be 
kept at a more even temperature than a light-weight one. 
Any fat may be used, the vegetable oils now on the market 
proving very satisfactory. This includes both corn and 
cottonseed oil, all of the lard substitutes, and, of course, 
the pure leaf lard. 

Unless a strong-flavored food has been cooked in the 
fat, such as onions, etc., it may be used over and over again 
if clarified after using. 

Frying baskets are a great convenience, particularly with 
delicate frying, as it saves handling. The articles to be 
fried are placed in the basket then submerged in the hot 
fat. When the food is brown, the basket is lifted out. In 
this way each article is perfect. 



MRS. DE GRAF'S COOK BOOK [135] 

If the fat bubbles or sputters while heating it denotes the 
presence of water, and it will be impossible to fry the food 
successfully, for the fat will not become hot enough. To 
overcome this condition, allow the water to evaporate, 
and then it will heat to the right temperature for frying. 

Fat which has been overheated at any time is unwhole- 
some and should not be used. It has become decomposed, 
and cooling and reheating will not restore it. The fat 
absorbed by food cooked in such fat will be irritating. 
After using fat for frying let stand until somewhat cool to 
allow any particles of food to settle. Then strain through 
a double thickness of cheese cloth to remove all remaining 
particles. If not overheated and carefully strained, vege- 
table fats can be used over and over a number of times. 
If fat becomes dark in color add a few slices of raw potato 
and heat very slowly. This will quickly absorb the various 
impurities and clarify it. To prevent food from absorbing 
fat have fat heated according to the test already given, 
using cubes of bread. Forty seconds for cooked mixtures, 
60 seconds for uncooked articles. Do not put too many 
cold articles in the fat at once, thereby reducing the heat 
too much. Test fat each time before food is added. Do 
not have mixtures to be fried too rich. Do not use too 
much baking powder. And, except for flour mixtures, 
have food well coated with eggs and crumbs. The egg 
forms a coating which prevents the food absorbing fat if 
the temperature of the fat is correct. The flour mixtures 
should contain enough egg to prevent the mixture absorb- 
ing fat if the fat is of the right heat. 

Sauteing is cooking food in a small quantity of fat; 
however, the term frying is more commonly used. Many 
experiments have been carried on to determine which 
method of cooking was preferable, deep fat frying or saute- 
ing, and it has been decided that if properly done the 
deep fat method will absorb less fat than sauteing or cook- 
ing in a small amount of fat. 



[136] MRS. DE GRAF'S COOK BOOK 

Fritter Batter 

To be used for vegetables or fruit. 
y^ cup flour. 1 egg beaten. 

34 teaspoon salt. Yi cup milk. 

Mix ingredients with an egg beater until very smooth 
and free from lumps, beating with a rotary egg beater. 
Let stand an hour or more in a cool place before using. 

Take slices of pineapple, banana or any cooked fruit or 
cooked vegetable such as cauliflower, egg plant, etc., dip 
in batter to completely coat, then fry in deep fat until a 
golden brown. 

Swedish Timbale Cases 

1 egg. yi teaspoon salt. 

y^ cup milk. 1 teaspoon olive or other vege- 

yi cup flour. table oil. 

Beat eggs, add remaining ingredients and beat until 
very smooth, using the egg beater. The mixture should 
be very thin. Set aside in a cool place for an hour or more. 
Have fat deep enough to completely cover the timbale iron. 
Heat the iron with the fat. When fat is hot remove iron, 
drain and dip into the batter a little more than half its 
depth. Dip iron into fat at once, completely covering it 
with fat. The cases are cooked when a delicate brown. It 
may be necessary to test one or two before the batter is 
the right consistency. If the cases are not crisp the mix- 
ture is too thick and should be thinned with a little milk. 
If the batter does not cling to the timbale form, it is too 
hot. It requires a little skill to get them just right. 

To Shape Croquettes 

Allow one rounding tablespoon of the mixture for each 
croquette. Form into a ball, dip in sifted bread crumbs 
and form into any shape desired. This is a very simple 
process and requires very little practice to shape very 
attractive croquettes. 

When all the croquettes have been molded, dip in beaten 
egg diluted with one or two tablespoons of cold water, 
roll in crumbs again and set aside to fry. The item of first 
importance in frying is the temperature of the fat. When 



MRS. DE GRAF'S COOK BOOK [137] 

frying mixtures covered with egg and crumbs, the fat 
should be hot enough to stiffen this coating the instant it 
comes in contact with it, and the final browning should 
not take but a few seconds. The frying process should 
encase the croquettes in a crisp, delicately browned crust 
while being reheated. To accomplish this the fat should 
not be smoking hot but hot enough to turn a cube of 
bread a golden brown while you count 40. If you have 
made the croquettes the size suggested, a rounding table- 
spoon for each croquette, they should be a golden brown 
and well heated through. 

Frying Process 

Fry only four or five croquettes at one time, and be sure 
to test the temperature of the fat between each frying. 
When fried, drain the croquettes on several folds of soft 
paper, laid on a pan in a warm oven, having the oven door 
open. 

Thick White Sauce for Croquettes 

4 tablespoons shortening. 1 cup cold milk. 

4 tablespoons flour. 

Melt shortening, add flour, stir until smooth; set over a 
fire, cook until frothy, then add cold milk and cook, stirring 
constantly until thick. Add seasonings and chopped food 
to the sauce; then cool. 

Thick Brown Sauce for Croquettes 

Brown sauce is made from stock, or stock can be made 
in a minute's time by dissolving a bouillon cube in a cup 
of hot water. Use 4 tablespoons drippings for the short- 
ening, and when this is melted add several slices of onion 
and cook until a golden brown; then remove onion, add 4 
tablespoons flour and cook the flour in the fat until brown; 
then add a cup of stock, stir until thick, season. 

Croquettes of Meat, Ham or Fish 

1 cup thick white or brown ]/^ teaspoon salt, 
sauce. 1 teaspoon onion juice. 

2 cups minced meat or fish. 

Mix ingredients and set aside to become cold. Make 
into small round or oblong forms. Dip in crumbs, then in 



[138] MRS. DE GRAF'S COOK BOOK 

slightly beaten egg, then in crumbs. When all are made 
fry in deep fat until a golden brown. Drain on brown paper 
and serve with a tomato or other sauce. 



Chicken Croquettes 

Chop chicken very fine, season with salt, pepper, onion 
juice and lemon juice. Chopped ham, tongue, sweetbreads, 
veal or mushrooms all combine with chicken, and any 
of these foods, even a small portion, will improve the flavor 
of the croquettes. For each cup of chopped meat use 1 
cup of thick white sauce. The sauce for chicken croquettes 
may be made with either chicken stock or milk. 

Rice Croquettes 

2 cups boiled rice. 1 egg. 

1 tablespoon butter. Y^ teaspoon salt. 

To hot boiled rice add butter and well-beaten egg; spread 
on a shallow plate and when cold shape in balls, roll in 
soft crumbs, dip in egg slightly beaten, then in crumbs 
again and fry in hot fat. For sweet rice croquettes add 2 
tablespoons sugar and the grated rind and juice of a lemon. 

Potato Croquettes 

2 cups hot mashed potatoes. 1 teaspoon onion juice. 

2 tablespoons butter. 1 teaspoon finely chopped 

Yi teaspoon salt. parsley. 

Yi teaspoon pepper. 

Add ingredients in order given to potatoes and prepare 
as for rice croquettes. 

Cheese Croquettes 

1 cup thick white sauce. Y2 cup grated cheese. 

Y teaspoon salt. 1 cup cheese, cut in dice. 

Paprika. 2 egg yolks. 

To white sauce add beaten yolks and cheese; stir until 
cheese is melted; cool, then shape and crumb as for rice 
croquettes. 



MRS. DE GRAF'S COOK BOOK [139] 

Macaroni Croquettes 

2 cups finely chopped cooked J^ teaspoon salt. 

macaroni. Paprika. 

1 cup thick white sauce. 

Add chopped macaroni to the thick white sauce; also 
seasoning. Set aside to cool. Shape into croquettes, dip in 
crumbs, then in slightly beaten egg, then crumbs. Fry in 
deep fat until a golden brown. Serve with a cheese sauce. 



Com Fritters 

1 egg beaten separately. 1 teaspoon baking powder. 

1 cup com. 3^ teaspoon salt. 

}/i cup flour. Paprika. 

Beat egg yolk; add corn, flour sifted with baking powder 
and salt; then fold in stiffly beaten egg white. Fry in 
deep fat or on a well greased griddle. 



Celery Fritters 

Cut celery in lengths of about 3 inches. Parboil until 
tender, but not broken; drain, season with salt and pepper. 
Prepare fritter batter; dip celery in batter and fry in deep 
fat; use as a garnish or with a tomato sauce. This is a 
good way to use the outer stalks of celery. 

Banana Fritters 

Dip each piece of banana in the batter and fry in hot fat; 
drain on brown paper. For a dessert or sweet entree serve 
with a sweet sauce; as a garnish for meat serve plain. 
Apple or pineapple fritters are prepared in the same 
manner. 

Tripe Fried in Batter 

Tripe is usually cooked or pickled as purchased in the 
market. It requires more cooking to make it tender. Cut 
into pieces for serving and cook in equal parts of milk 
and water until tender, about half an hour. Drain, dry, 
dip in fritter batter and fry in deep fat.

Vegetable Cookery 




EGETABLE cookery is very often slighted because it 
seems too simple to require much attention. Hot 
or cold water is poured over them, regardless of 
the type of vegetable. Sometimes they are cooked 
so long and in such quantities of water that the finished 
dish is anything but palatable. 

Vegetables are made up of countless little cells contain- 
ing water, sugar, starch, mineral salts, etc., and are valu- 
able to the diet as bulk food and for these mineral salts. 
The careful housewife will see that vegetables are cooked 
so as to retain most of these valuable elements. All vege- 
tables should be cooked in boiling water, as this bursts the 
starch grains at once, which will hold the nutriment of 
the vegetable. If cold or just warm water is used, the 
starchy frame of the vegetable will become soaked with 
water, and in the case of very starchy vegetables, such as 
potatoes, they will become water-soaked and soggy — an 
unappetizing and indigestible dish. The vegetables de- 
ficient in starch should be cooked in boiling hot water also, 
in order to retain the flavor, and delicate vegetables should 
not be cooked in a quantity of water or the flavor will be 
impaired and much of the mineral salts lost. Steamed 
vegetables retain nearly all the valuable qualities and is a 
very satisfactory method for cooking many vegetables. 

Foods containing starch must be well cooked. Such 
vegetables as potatoes, turnips and those containing starch 
in the form of woody. fiber must be thoroughly cooked or 
they will be unwholesome. Green peas and asparagus 
contain sufficient starch to require thorough cooking, but 
in order to retain the flavor (sugar and other elements) 
there should not be a quantity of water used, and while 
the water should be at the boiling point it should not be 
allowed to boil violently; in the case of peas all water should 
either be absorbed, or whatever liquid remains should be 
served with the vegetables. 

The liquid from asparagus can form the base for a cream 
soup or can be used to make a sauce to pour over the vege- 
table. Spinach, after being carefully cleaned, should be 



MRS. DE GRAF'S COOK BOOK [143] 

cooked in the water which clings to the leaves, or if any 
water is added it should be only sufficient to cover the 
bottom of the kettle. The length of time required to cook 
vegetables depends upon their age and how long they have 
been gathered. 

Some vegetables are strong flavored and for this type a 
quantity of water may be used. Cabbage, onions, etc., 
come under this class. These vegetables may be blanched. 
By that is meant placing the vegetables in a quantity of 
cold water and then brought quickly to the boiling point, 
boiled not more than 5 minutes, drained and cooked in 
boiling water as directed. 

Hard water has a tendency to toughen and harden 
woody fiber, and thus keep the sweet juices and other 
valuable compounds within the article cooked; soft water 
acts in just the opposite manner. For that reason we salt 
the water for all green vegetables, which assists them in 
retaining flavor and color. Vegetables containing much 
woody fiber are better cooked in soft water, adding salt 
when half cooked. 

If you will bear in mind that vegetables growing above 
the ground require salted water and those growing below 
the ground can be salted later in the cooking process, there 
will be no mistake. 

Some cooks advise using a small quantity of baking soda 
in the water in which woody fibered vegetables are cooked. 
This is not an advisable process, for the soda is an alkali, 
and while it will certainly soften the water it will also 
destroy certain essential elements in the vegetables and 
will give green vegetables a faded, unappetizing appear- 
ance. 

In the case of dried vegetables, where soda is often 
suggested to soften the cellular structure, soaking over 
night will be found to give much better results. 

Green vegetables will retain their color better if cooked 
in an uncovered kettle. Strong flavored vegetables, such 
as cabbage and cauliflower, will not give off^ as unpleasant 
an odor if cooked in an uncovered kettle. 

Although it is customary to boil vegetables, they may be 
either steamed or baked. To steam be careful to keep 
water constantly boiling and saucepan closely covered. 



[144] MRS. DE GRAF'S COOK BOOK 

Steam until vegetable is tender. This will take a little 
longer than boiling, but they will be of a good flavor and 
there will be scarcely any loss of mineral salts or other 
nutritive content. This method of cooking may be used for 
all vegetables firm in texture. Where possible, steam vege- 
tables without removing the skins. The flavor o the food 
will be greatly improved and the skins may be more quickly 
and easily removed after cooking. In baking there is very 
little loss of material except water, which is driven oflF by 
the heat. Baked potatoes, both white and sweet, are 
among the most easily digested and wholesome vege- 
tables. 

When baking raw vegetables always use a medium hot 
oven. Potatoes will not be mealy and satisfactory if placed 
in a cool oven and allowed to heat through gradually. 

The time required for cooking vegetables depends 
largely upon the age of the vegetable. They should be 
cooked until tender, but no longer. Peas overcooked are 
ruined, and cabbage, so commonly cooked until soggy and 
heavy, is certainly unappetizing and indigestible. 

For seasonings, just salt, pepper and butter or any of 
the well-made white or drawn butter sauces. The wise 
housekeeper will master the art of making simple sauces 
and will vary the kind to suit the vegetable the sauce is to 
be served with. If the vegetable is to be fried be sure the 
fat is hot and drain off all fat before serving. Fat soaked 
foods are unwholesome and indigestible. 

Cold cooked vegetables may be scalloped or served au 
gratin. Any of these methods will entirely change the 
flavor and appearance so completely that the reheated 
dish will not be classified as a left-over. 

Any cooked vegetable may be creamed by adding thin 
or medium white sauce. This sauce can be made with part 
milk and part the liquid the vegetable was cooked in. 

Any cooked vegetable may be scalloped by alternating 
layers of vegetables and a medium white sauce, covering 
the top with buttered crumbs and baking until brown. 

Vegetables may be boiled in the oven as well as on top 
of the stove. If using a hot oven for a roast the vege- 
tables may be started to cook on top of the stove, then 
removed to the oven to complete cooking. Of course, 



MRS. DE GRAF'S COOK BOOK [145] 

they must be kept at the boiling point if the best flavor is 
desired, so the oven must be hot. 

When using canned vegetables, it is better to open the 
cans an hour or more before they are needed, so that the 
contents may come in contact with a fresh supply of oxy- 
gen. Of course the food should be turned from the can at 
once. All canned vegetables, except tomatoes and corn, 
should be rinsed in cold water before using. This removes 
the "canned" taste so much disliked by many. 

Artichokes 

Let the artichokes soak for about ten minutes in cold 
salted water. This draws out any tiny bugs which might 
be under the leaves. Remove the tough outside leaves 
and with a sharp knife cut about an inch off the top of each 
artichoke. Drop into cold water, adding a tablespoon of 
vinegar or lemon juice and let stand half hour or more. 
This prevents discoloration. Drain and cook in salted 
boiling water until tender. 

Boiled Asparagus 

Scrape the stalks, wash well and tie in small bunches; 
cut off the tough ends. Set the bunches in boiling salted 
water with the tips upright and above the water. Cook 
until tender. Drain, arrange on buttered toast, season 
with butter and serve. Steaming is a very good method to 
use for cooking asparagus. 

Asparagus in Milk 

Scrape the stalks, cut off the tough ends and cut in inch 
lengths. Put in a double boiler, add hot milk to cover and 
cook until tender. Season with salt and butter and serve; 
or for each cup of milk allow one tablespoon of butter and 
one of flour; mix until well blended, then add to hot mix- 
ture and stir until creamy. Pour over toast points. 

Asparagus Shortcake 

Split and butter hot baking powder biscuits. Have 
prepared creamed asparagus and put the biscuits together 
with this mixture, pouring some of the creamed asparagus 
around the little shortcakes.

water, allowing ^4, teaspoon of salt and ^ teaspoon of 
sugar to each cup of water. Simmer gently until tender, 
then add a teaspoon of butter just before serving. 

Glac6 Carrots 

Boil or steam small carrots without peeling. Drain,

Drain, plunge in cold water and remove the skins. Cut in 
cubes. Reheat in a double boiler, adding salt and a table- 
spoon of butter. 

Scalloped Onions 

Peel and slice onions about half an inch in thickness. 
Put a layer of onions in a buttered baking dish or casserole; 
season with salt, dot with butter and dredge with flour. 
Continue in layers until all the onions are used. Cover 
with hot milk or boiling water; cover and bake in a moder- 
ate oven until tender; about one hour. Or reheat cooked 
onions. 



MRS. DE GRAF'S COOK BOOK [147] 

Onions with Peanut Butter Sauce 

Peel onions and cook in boiling water until tender. 
Make a white sauce using the proportion of 1 tablespoon of 
butter, 1 tablespoon of flour and ^ teaspoon of salt to 
each cup of milk or cream. Add 4 tablespoons of peanut 
butter to each cup of sauce and stir until well blended. 
Pour over the onions that have been drained, and serve. 

Celery au Gratin 

Two cups of celery cut in small pieces. Put in saucepan 
and add 2 cups of boiling salted water. Cook until 
tender. Drain, reserving liquid to make a sauce. For the 
sauce use ^ cup of celery liquid and yi cup of milk. Melt 
2 tablespoons shortening, add 2 tablespoons of flour, cook 
until frothy, add liquid and cook, stirring constantly, until 
creamy. Season with salt and pepper. Grease a baking 
dish and add alternate layers of celery, sauce and grated 
cheese. Cover the top with buttered crumbs and bake 
until brown. 

Fried Eggplant 

Pare eggplant and cut in 3<4-inch slices. Season with 
pepper and salt, then dip in slightly beaten egg, diluted 
with 1 tablespoon of cold water. After covering each slice 
with egg, roll in soft bread crumbs and fry in deep fat or 
pan fry in a small quantity of fat cooking in either case 
until a golden brown.

Chop cabbage very fine. Plunge into boiling salted 
water and boil rapidly for 15 minutes. Drain, season with 
salt, pepper and a little butter. 

Diced Turnips 

Peel turnips and cut in cubes; cook in boiling water 
until tender but not broken; drain. Allow 1 cup of medium 
white sauce for 2 cups of turnip, season with salt, pepper 
and 1 teaspoon of lemon juice. 



[148] MRS. DE GRAF'S COOK BOOK 

Parsnip Cakes 

Take cold mashed parsnips that have been well 
seasoned shape into small, flat, round cakes; roll in flour 
and cook in butter or butter substitute, browning on each 
side. 

Steamed Squash 

Cut squash in pieces to fit the steamer or colander in 
which it is to be steamed. Place over boiling water, 
cover closely and steam until tender, about one hour. 
Scrape the pulp from the shell and mash, seasoning with 
butter, pepper and salt and a very small amount of sugar. 

Baked Cream Squash 

Cut small cream squash in half; remove seeds and fiber; 
sprinkle with salt and dot with small bits of butter or 
substitute. Bake in a moderate oven about ^ of an hour. 

Creamed Cabbage 

4 cups shredded cabbage. 2 cups medium white sauce. 

Add shredded cabbage to rapidly boiling, salted water. 
Cook until tender; drain, then add to the well-seasoned 
white sauce. 

Spinach 

Remove roots from spinach. Wash very well in several 
waters, then pour hot water over the leaves. This causes 
any remaining grit to go to the bottom of the pan. Place 
spinach in a kettle with a teaspoon of salt and cook until 
tender in its own juice, having the fire low and lifting occa- 
sionally to prevent burning. Drain, chop fine and add 
seasonings of salt, pepper and butter. Reheat and garnish 
with slices of hard cooked egg. Cooked in this manner, 
all of the valuable salts are retained. If the spinach is 
old and rather tough it may be necessary to use about a 
cupful of boiling water. 

Creamed Spinach 

For 2 cups of cooked, chopped spinach allow 1 cup of 
well-seasoned medium white sauce and add a dash of 
nutmeg. 



MRS. DE GRAF'S COOK BOOK [149] 

Brussels Sprouts 

Wash well and remove outer leaves of sprouts; cook in 
boiling, salted water until tender, about 20 minutes. Drain 
well, add 2 tablespoons butter to a heavy frying pan. Add 
the sprouts and cook over a slow fire until butter is all 
absorbed. Season with salt and pepper. Serve on a platter 
rounded with toast points or fried bread. 



Dainty Cabbage 

This is a somewhat novel way to cook this humble 
vegetable, but it will be found very palatable and as it is a 
hearty dish can be served when the meat course is not so 
plentiful. 

Select a firm white head of cabbage and cook in boiling 
salted water until tender. Drain. Chop and season with 
salt and pepper. Add 2 level tablespoons of butter, 1/2 
cup of milk and 2 beaten eggs, and 1 teaspoon of vinegar. 
Mix all the ingredients, pour into a greased baking dish, 
and bake in a hot oven until the top is a golden brown.

1 egg. 3 cups shredded uncooked 

1 tablespoon flour. cabbage. 

Yi cup milk. Y^ teaspoon mustard. 

1 teaspoon salt. 

Mix ingredients and add to beaten egg and milk and cook 
in double boiler until thick. Add vinegar and cabbage 
and serve very hot. 

Stuffed Green Peppers 

Cut tops and remove centers of sweet green peppers; 
cover with boiling water and let stand about 10 minutes. 
Make a stuflftng of cooked rice seasoned well with butter, 
salt, finely chopped onion, moistening well with strained 
tomato. Fill peppers with mixture, cover with buttered 
crumbs and bake in a moderate oven about ^ of an hour. 



[150] MRS. DE GRAF'S COOK BOOK 

Creamed Spinach 

Two cups of chopped cooked spinach, 1 cup of medium 
white sauce, salt, pepper, few grains nutmeg. Combine 
ingredients and reheat.

1 mint leaf. Salt and pepper. 

2 tablespoons butter or 
substitute. 

Cook peas in a small quantity of boiling salted water, 
until tender, leaving kettle uncovered. Mix butter, 
chopped mint, salt, pepper and lemon juice. Drain peas, 
add butter mixture, return to fire and melt and serve. 

Pink Beans Spanish 

2 cup beans. 1 pimento or green pepper, 

1 onion. chopped. 

2 cups strained tomato or to- 1 tablespoon butter or sub- 
mato sauce. stitute. 

1 teaspoon salt. 

Wash, then soak beans over night; drain, cover with boil- 
ing water and cook ^ hour. Drain again, cover again with 
fresh boiling water and cook until tender. Melt butter, 
add onion and pimento and cook for about 5 minutes, 
then add tomato. Drain beans, add the sauce and 
simmer about half an hour. 

Stufifed Tomatoes 

Cut a thin slice from the smooth end of tomatoes. 
Scoop out the pulp and mix it with an equal quantity of 
cold cooked rice, macaroni or bread crumbs. Add season- 
ing of salt, pepper and a few drops of onion juice. Refill 
tomato shells, replace covers and bake yi hour. A table- 
spoon or more of finely chopped ham adds variety to this 
dish. 

Boiled Cabbage 

Allow cabbage to soak in cold water for at least half an 
hour before cooking. Place in rapidly boiling water to 
which 2 teaspoonfuls of salt have been added. Boil in an 



MRS. DE GRAF'S COOK BOOK [151] 

uncovered saucepan about 25 minutes. The cabbage 
should be white and thoroughly cooked in that time. 
Longer cooking will cause it to be tough and indigestible. 
Drain and serve plain or with White, Hollandaise or 
Drawn Butter sauce. 

Celery in White Sauce 

Wash, scrape and cut celery stalks in 1-inch pieces; cook 
20 minutes or until soft in boiling salted water; drain, and 
to 2 cups of celery add 1 cup of white sauce. This is a 
most satisfactory way of using the outer stalks of celery. 

Creamed Carrots 

Cut carrots, after scraping into slices; let boil in boiling 
water until tender; drain, and add to 1 cupful of well- 
seasoned white sauce. 

Canned Vegetables 

Open and remove from can at once. Drain ofF all liquid 
with the exception of corn and tomatoes and let stand an 
hour or more in fresh cold water. As the vegetables have 
already been cooked they only require reheating and 
seasoning. A double boiler will be found the most satis- 
factory method for reheating. It requires about 15 min- 
utes to heat thoroughly. A bit of butter and salt are 
added when the vegetables are put in the boiler. Heated 
in this manner the vegetables will not require water and 
there will be no danger of burning, as is easily the case with 
corn. Milk or cream may be added if desired. 

Stuffed Vegetables 

Onions, green peppers, tomatoes and eggplant are cooked 
in this manner: Scald the vegetables a few minutes, then 
place in cold water and remove the peel of the tomatoes 
or onions, and rub off the skins of green peppers and egg 
plants with a cloth. The centers are removed and the 
cavities filled with a stuffing made of seasoned bread 
crumbs mixed with a little melted butter, or the portion 
removed may be chopped fine and added to the crumbs. 
Place a small piece of butter on top of each and bake in a 
hot oven. Serve plain or with a sauce. 



[152] MRS. DE GRAF'S COOK BOOK 

Vegetables au Gratin 

Left-over vegetables are usually used, and almost any 
variety may be prepared in this manner: Cut vegetables 
into cubes or slices. Make a white sauce; butter a baking 
dish and arrange a layer of vegetables in it, season, then 
add a layer of white sauce. Repeat until dish is filled. 
Cover the top with a layer of soft crumbs moistened with 
melted butter. Bake in a moderate oven. Cheese may be 
added to the white sauce. 

Scalloped Vegetables 

This is also an excellent way to use left-over vegetables. 
Cut vegetables in slices or cubes. Butter a baking dish, 
arrange a layer of vegetables, season, then add a layer of 
soft crumbs, dotted over with a little butter. Repeat 
until dish is filled, having a layer of crumbs on top. Bake 
in a moderate oven until nicely browned. 

Boiled Potatoes for Mashing 

Wash potatoes with a small brush and peel as thin as 
possible, for much of the mineral salts lie next to the skin. 
Place in rapidly boiling water and cook until they may be 
pierced with a fork. Drain and shake them in the saucepan 
for a few moments to make them mealy. Mash well, being 
sure there are no lumps, and add butter and salt in pro- 
portion to the number of potatoes. Beat well, adding 
gradually enough scalded milk to make them creamy, and 
continue to beat until white and light. A potato ricer can 
be used instead of mashing them, then seasonings and 
milk can be added, and the potatoes beaten until light. 

Baked Potatoes 

Potatoes should be of uniform size. Wash well and place 
in a hot oven for 45 minutes, when they should be mellow 
when pressed between the fingers. If skins are desired soft, 
rub each potato with butter or substitute before baking. 
When baked remove at once from the oven; press between 
the hands until the skins breaks, or prick with a fork to 
release the steam; this will prevent the potato from 
becoming soggy. 



MRS. DE GRAF'S COOK BOOK [153] 

Steamed Potatoes 

Wash potatoes well. Do not remove skins. Place in a 
steamer over boiling water, cover closely and cook for 
about 45 minutes, or until potatoes are tender. 

Potato Puffs 

1 teaspoon salt. 1 tablespoon melted butter. 

2 cups of hot mashed potatoes. 1 tablespoon finely chopped par- 
1 egg yolk. sley. 

Shape mashed potatoes into small balls and place on a 
greased baking pan. Beat egg yolk, add butter and brush 
the potato balls with the mixture. Sprinkle with parsley 
and set in a hot oven to brown. 

French Fried Potatoes 

Wash and peel potatoes. Cut into thin, lengthwise 
strips and let stand in cold water an hour or more. Drain, 
dry on a cloth and fry in deep fat. Heat fat until a piece 
of bread will brown in 1>^ minutes. Have kettle half 
full of the fat. Do not add many potatoes at a time. Drain 
on soft paper and sprinkle with salt. Test the fat each 
time before fresh potatoes are added. 

Potato Balis 

Wash and peel potatoes and cut into balls with a French 
vegetable cutter. Cook in boiling water until tender but 
not broken. Drain, roll in minced parsley and serve. 

Ducliess Potatoes 

To 3 cups of hot riced or mashed potatoes add 2 table- 
spoons of butter, 1 teaspoon of salt and 1 egg slightly 
beaten. Mix well, beating until light. Put through a 
pastry bag with a star tube or shape into pyramids with 
a spoon. Brush over with beaten egg (yolk only preferred) 
and brown in a rather hot oven. 

Franconia Potatoes 

Peel and prepare as for boiled potatoes; parboil 10 
minutes, drain and either place in pan with roast beef, 



[154] MRS. DE GRAF'S COOK BOOK 

basting often with fat in the pan, or cook in a heavy frying 
pan with plenty of fat. Cover closely. Turn often so that 
potatoes may be a deep golden brown. 

Potatoes en Casserole 

Wash and peel potatoes. Cut into quarters crosswise. 
Place in a baking dish, sprinkle lightly with salt and add 2 
tablespoons of butter for 5 medium sized potatoes Cover 
closely and bake in a moderate oven about 45 minutes. 

Fried Summer Squash 

Pare and slice the squash. Beat 1 egg, add 2 tablespoons 
of water or milk and season with salt and pepper. Dip the 
slices of squash into the egg mixture, then into fine dry 
bread crumbs or flour. Heat a heavy frying pan, add short- 
ening and when hot add the slices of squash, cooking until 
a golden brown on each side. 

French Fried Onions 

Peel and slice onions very thin, cutting cross-wise. Soak 
in milk for about 1 hour then drain and dredge with flour. 
Have fat heated until a piece of bread will turn a golden 
brown in 1^ minutes. Drain on soft paper. Further 
information regarding fat will be found under deep fat 
frying. 

Green Com 

Silk should be brown and sweet and juicy, milk should 
flow from the kernels when pricked with a fork. Corn is 
easily spoiled by overcooking. Have a quantity of rapidly 
boiling unsalted water; add the ears of corn a few at a 
time so as not to reduce the temperature of the water. 
Fresh corn should cook in about 10 minutes. Cooking in 
salted water hardens and wrinkles corn. 

Kohl Rabi 

Kohl rabi is a variety of cabbage, but the flavor and 
nutriment are stored mainly in the stem; this looks some- 
what like a turnip and grows just above the ground. It 
should be used when young and tender or when it is not 



MRS. DE GRAF'S COOK BOOK [155] 

more than 3 inches in diameter. When old it is tough and 
fibrous. To boil, wash and peel and cut in cubes or slices.

sprinkle with 1 tablcspoonful of flour, 3^ teaspoonful of 
salt and a little pepper, and dot with butter or substitute. 
Repeat with a second layer of potatoes and so on until all 
are used, and then pour over the hot milk, until it barely 
shows through the potato slices. Cover and bake an hour 
in a moderate oven until potatoes become brown. 

Escalloped Potatoes with Bacon 

Prepare escalloped potatoes according to the preceding 
recipe, omitting the fat. Cut the rind from 6 slices of 
bacon and let bacon stand 5 minutes in boiling water. 
Drain, then place the bacon strips over the potatoes 20 
minutes before the latter are cooked. The bacon fat will 
drain over the potatoes. 

Potatoes in the Half Shell 

Select smooth, medium sized potatoes, wash and bake. 
Remove from oven. Cut in halves, scoop out inside, mash. 
For 6 potatoes use 2 tablespoonfuls butter, 3 tablespoon-

Savory Sauces 



To make a really good sauce is considered an art in itself 
and one which has not always been given the careful consid- 
eration it deserves. Many common-place and otherwise 
hopeless dishes may be transformed and made most ap- 
petizing when served with a well-made sauce. If given care 
a smooth creamy, well-cooked sauce is not difficult to pre- 
pare, and may be plain or quite elaborate, as desired. 
However, it must be free from all lumps and thoroughly 
cooked and the seasoning used should be suitable for the 
food the sauce is to be served with. 

Sauces made with milk are economical, for they supply 
nutriment and increase the value of the food with which 
they are served. In using left-overs offish, meat and vege- 
tables it is almost necessary to use a well-seasoned sauce. 

A plain white sauce is perhaps the most useful adjunct 
to good cooking and the foundation recipe may be varied in 
many appetizing ways by the addition of other ingredients. 
This white sauce is made of a different thickness, according 
to how it is to be used. For creamed soups it is quite 
thin, for croquettes very thick, and for the usual creamed 
dishes of a medium thickness. The medium sauce is made 
by using 2 tablespoons (level) of butter or butter substitute, 
2 tablespoons of flour to each half-pint measuring cup of 
cold liquid, which may be water, milk, thin cream or white 
orbrown stock, depending upon what kind of sauce you wish. 
With these measurements in mind you can prepare any 
quantity of sauce desired. 

There are several approved methods of preparation, but 
the one given will be found very easy and most satis- 
factory if the directions are carefully followed. Put the 
butter or butter substitute in a saucepan over a low fire 
and melt, but do not brown; when fat is melted remove 
from the fire and add flour, stirring until smooth and well 
blended; return to the fire and cook the mixture until it 
bubbles or becomes frothy, then add the cold milk gradu- 
ally, stirring until boiling point is reached and sauce thick- 
ens. Add seasoning. 

If it is necessary to keep this sauce hot for any length 



[160] MRS. DE GRAF'S COOK BOOK 

of time, set in a dish of hot water, add a few small pieces of 
butter and cover. This will prevent a crust from forming 
on top. Do not boil after the sauce becomes creamy and 
thick or it may separate and become oily. If this should 
happen, add 1 tablespoon of cold liquid for each cup of 
sauce, place over the fire and stir constantly until the 
boiling point is reached again. 

The secret of good white sauce is in cooking he flour 
until the starch grains burst; this removes the raw, 
pasty, unpleasant taste one so often finds in undercooked 
sauces. If the liquid is added gradually and stirred con- 
stantly there will be no difficulty in keeping the sauce 
smooth. 

A brown sauce is made in the same manner, allowing the 
fat to brown before adding the flour, then cooking these 
two ingredients together until brown, using a dark stock 
or water for the liquid. The best results are obtained if 
all the seasonings are added before the sauce is completely 
cooked. 

The more delicate sauces are thickened with the yolks 
of eggs and a quantity of butter. These sauces require 
considerable skill in preparation. 

For every-day cooking the plain sauce may easily be 
varied to form almost any sauce desired. 

Catsup, Chili sauce, Worcestershire sauce, Kitchen 
Bouquet, whole cloves, grated onion, etc., all give a variety 
of flavorings. 

Stock of some type can be used in place of milk. The 
thickness of the sauce is governed by taste. One table- 
spoonful of flour and shortening to each cupful of liquid 
gives a thin sauce. Two tablespoonfuls of each give a 
medium sauce. 



Foundation Medium White Sauce 

2 tablespoons butter or 1 cup cold milk, 

substitute. 3^ teaspoon salt. 

2 tablespoons flour. White pepper to taste. 

Melt shortening, add flour, mix until smooth; cook until 



MRS. DE CtRAF'S COOK BOOK [161] 

frothy, then add cold milk and cook until creamy, add 
seasonings. 

This sauce is used for all plain creamed dishes such as 
vegetables, fish, meat and toast. 

Cream Sauce 

Follow white sauce recipe, using thin cream or half 
cream and half milk. 

To be used when a richer sauce is desired. 

Celery Sauce

Cheese Sauce 

Follow the white sauce recipe. For each cup of tauce 
add }/2 cup of grated cheese. Season with paprika, 
cayenne, salt and Yi teaspoon of mustard, which should be 
blended with the flour to prevent lumping. This is a very 
nice sauce to serve in place of Welsh rarebit. 

Onion Sauce 

Follow white sauce recipe. Slice 1 small onion and cook 
in boiling water until tender. Press through a sieve and 
add to the white sauce.

celery salt, and a small piece of bay leaf. Add these to the 
sauce when you add the cold milk. Remove the bay leaf 
before serving. Do not boil after eggs have been added or 
the mixture will curdle. This sauce is suitable for vege- 
tables. 

Poulette Sauce 

Follow white sauce recipe, using ^ cup of cream and 
^ cup of chicken stock, or to 1 cup of white sauce add yi 
cup of cream. When boiling point is reached pour the

Salads and Salad Dressings 

While the food value of a green salad is not high, the salts 
they contain are valuable and the oil used in the various 
dressings supply the nutriment, making them a wholesome 
food. In almost any climate some green salad vegetable 
may be obtained all the year round, and with cooked or 
canned vegetables an acceptable salad can always be made. 
There are certain things essential for a good salad. First, 
it should be cold; if a green salad, it must be crisp; the 
dressing ingredients must be carefully proportioned and 
blended so the salad will be neither oily nor acid, and the 
whole well mixed. In using French dressing there should be 
just sufficient to cover the vegetables when mixed, and none 
left in the bottom of the bowl after mixing. 

If the greens are prepared several hours before wanted 
they may be placed (after drying) in a tightly covered pail 
and set in a cool place until needed, when they will be very 
crisp, fresh and cool. Never cut up lettuce, but break the 
leaves, if necessary, to the desired size. Dressing should 
never be added to a green salad until time for serving, 
otherwise the salad greens will become wilted and lose the 
desired crispness. Always remove the skin from tomatoes. 
A tomato salad is quickly prepared, served skin and all, 
but the skin is indigestible. 

An easy way to remove the skins is to put the tomatoes in 
a basket or colander and plunge them into boiling (not 
just hot) water and let them remain 1 minute only; then 
plunge into cold water. The skins may then be easily 
removed. Set aside to chill before slicing. When stuffing 
raw tomatoes for salad, remove the skin, cut a slice off the 
stem and scoop out the centers, sprinkle with salt and 
invert to drain and chill. Just before serving fill centers 
with the prepared filling and set on lettuce leaves. 

Another method but not so quickly accomplished, is to 
rub each tomato over the surface with the blunt edge of a 
knife, then peel. 

Cooked vegetables for salads should be thoroughly 
drained and quite cold before using. Turn artichokes up- 
side down so that all the moisture will be drained off. 



MRS. DE GRAF'S COOK BOOK [169] 

Cabbage should be shredded very fine with a sharp, 
long knife rather than chopped. After shredding let the 
cabbage stand in cold water to become crisp and drain well 
before using. 

Peel cucumbers and cut off a thick slice from each end; 
soak in cold water until ready to serve, then cut in thin 
slices. Never soak cucumbers in salted water, for then they 
become tough and wilted, besides increasing their indigesti- 
bility. Green peppers should be scalded for about 5 min- 
utes, when the outside skin may be rubbed off. Cover with 
cold water until ready to use. Parsley should be kept in a 
glass of cold water, wetting only the roots. In this way it 
will keep fresh several days. 

If using canned vegetables, such as peas, lima beans, 
asparagus or string beans, open the can at least half an 
hour before wanted and drain off all the liquid. Cover with 
cold water until ready to use. Treated in this way they 
will taste more like the fresh vegetable. 

When making a salad of cooked vegetables it will be 
found an improvement to mix with a French dressing and 
allow to stand or marinate in a cool place about an hour 
before serving. With a green salad the dressing should 
never be added until time to serve, as the dressing causes 
green vegetables to become wilted. 

Meat and poultry should be freed from skin and gristle 
and cut in small cubes. Fish should have all the bones 
and skin removed and pulled apart or flaked with a fork. 
All left-over vegetables, fish or meat can be utilized in 
salads, and almost all combinations of cooked or green 
vegetables make a palatable one. 

A combination of fruits makes a pleasant change from 
the plain fruit itself and offers a good way to add the differ- 
ent helpful salts and acids into the system. Containing 
iron, tartrates, gum, pectin and fruit sugars and other 
saline qualities, a mixture of fruits is a very desirable 
dish. Use only good, firm fruit for salads and either fresh 
or cooked fruit will give equally good results. The flavor 
of a fruit salad is improved by using lemon juice instead 
of vinegar in the dressing. Almost any combination of 
fruits will be acceptable for a salad. 



[170] MRS. DE GRAF'S COOK BOOK 

The requirements for a good salad consists in having all 
ingredients cold, the greens crisp and dry. For French 
dressing select a good oil — olive oil has the best flavor. Do 
not use too much dressing; there should be just enough 
to cover each bit of the ingredients, no more. Meat, fish 
and cooked vegetable salads may stand an hour in French 
dressing before serving. This is called a marinade and will 
improve the flavor of the salad. When ready to serve pour 
over any desired dressing regardless of the marinade. 
Much of the flavor of all salad dressings depends upon a 
good quality of both vinegar and oil. 

The following rules govern generally in regard to the 
serving of salads. 

1. Vegetable or fruit salads, with a simple dressing 
may be served with a meat course. 

2. More elaborate fruit and vegetable combinations 
should accompany light meats as chicken, fish, tongue, etc. 

3. Meat or fish salads with mayonnaise or boiled dress- 
ing may be used in place of the meat course. 

4. Never repeat in a salad a vegetable used in a previ- 
ous course. 

5. Hard cooked eggs combine well with fowl, fish and 
vegetables. 

6. Cream cheese combines with vegetables and nuts 
and with some fruits, pineapple preferred. 

7. Eggs, cheese and nuts should not be used in salads 
to accompany a meat course. 

8. Starchy salads should not be served when the menu 
contains much starchy food. 



MRS. DE GRAF'S COOK BOOK [171] 

Different Salad Dressing for Each Day in 
the Week 

A French or^Mayonnaise dressing is more often used 
plain, but by adding various flavorings, can be greatly 
changed, giving variety at a time of the year when salad 
greens are limited. Take lettuce which we always have in 
California. This popular green salad vegetable could be 
served many days in succession but with a different dress- 
ing for each day. In this manner variety is introduced 
and the family will not tire of lettuce, as would often be 
the case were the same dressing used each meal. There is 
a strong appetite appeal in variety and when the person 
who plans the meals realizes this she will have learned one 
of the most valuable lessons in menu building. 

Salad dressings have as their base, acid, oil and season- 
ings. Your base recipe may be one of the three foundation 
formulae — French, Mayonnaise or Cooked dressing. French 
dressing or variations of it is the most suitable for green 
salads and for a salad served with a heavy meal. It is less 
hearty than either the Mayonnaise or Cooked dressing, 
and will be relished more than the richer dressings. Cooked 
dressing is preferred by those who do not care for the flavor 
of oil. This dressing admits of as many variations as a 
Mayonnaise dressing. It is a very convenient salad dress- 
ing for it can be prepared in a quantity and kept for some 
time. Mayonnaise is considered by many somewhat diffi- 
cult to prepare. Lack of success might be traced to two 
things — haste in adding the oil, and not having the ingredi- 
ents used all of about the same temperature. 

If the oil is cold and the egg and acid warm, it is diflttcult 
to make the egg absorb the oil; or it might be the egg was 
cold and the oil warm. It is far easier to have all ingredi- 
ents cold. If that is not possible, have them all about 
the same temperature. One egg yolk will only absorb one 
cupful of oil and remain thick and firm. If more than that 
quantity is used, the dressing may separate; if not at once, 
it will do so after standing some time. 

The seasonings and a teaspoon of acid should be added 



[172] MRS. DE GRAF'S COOK BOOK 

to the egg yolk and the whole beaten or well mixed before 
any oil is added. Add about a teaspoonful of oil, then 
beat well, using a small spoon or a very small egg beater. 
Always use a small bowl for making mayonnaise, so there 
will not be much surface at the bottom of the bowl. This 
enables you to mix the ingredients well. Add oil, a tea- 
spoonful at a time, until the mixture begins to thicken. As 
soon as this dressing has once become thick, the oil may be 
added in larger quantity, if it is beaten well or until ab- 
sorbed, between each addition of oil. An egg beater can 
be used and the dressing made very quickly after it has 
once thickened. If more acid is desired, it can be added 
during the mixing or at the last. Adding the acid to the 
egg yolk before the oil is used, lessens the liability of the 
mixture to curdle. The egg beater also aids in keeping the 
dressing from curdling, as the larger surface over which the 
oil is spread the less likelihood of separation. One point, 
most important: be sure all the oil added at any one time 
is entirely absorbed before adding more. If, after all these 
precautions, the dressing should curdle, put it aside, and 
begin the process all over again with another egg yolk. 
As soon as this begins to thicken, the curdled mixture may 
be added gradually, just as you would add oil. This 
should remedy the trouble and prevent waste. A double 
quantity of oil can be used. When well made a mayon- 
naise is smooth, thick and glossy in appearance. Dressing 
made with these proportions — 1 cupful of oil to each yolk 
of egg — will keep some time without separating, if kept in 
a cool place. 

Oil is the main ingredient in a French dressing, and if 
the salad is to be perfect, to have the right flavor, a good 
olive oil is required. Other vegetable oils may be used for 
mayonnaise with very good results, but French dressing 
will lack flavor if made of an inferior oil. Much depends 
on the vinegar, which sould be pure and not too sharp. 
To prepare a French dressing, put all the ingredients into 
a small glass fruit jar, adjust the cover and shake vigor- 
ously until well blended and thick. A perfect emulsion 
will result, which will remain thick for half an hour or more. 

Cooked dressing somewhat resembles mayonnaise and 
usually has butter added to supply the necessary fat. 



MRS. DE GRAF'S COOK BOOK [173] 

Cooked dressing is usually served to persons who do not 
enjoy the flavor of oil. However, oil may be used, as the 
flavor is scarcely perceptible after it has been heated. 

Mayonnaise Dressing 

1 cup oil. H teaspoon salt. 

3 teaspoons vinegar (about). Yi teaspoon of mustard. 

1 raw egg yolk. Dash of pepper or paprika. 

It is essential that everything for a mayonnaise be of 
the same temperature; not one ingredient very cold and 
the other very warm. Put the egg yolk in a small bowl and 
beat until creamy, then add the mustard, salt, pepper and 
mix until smooth; add 1 teaspoon of vinegar, then add a 
few drops of oil, using a small egg beater; add oil gradu- 
ally, beating until thick between each addition of oil. 
This can be accomplished very quickly with the egg beater. 
Add remaining vinegar when all the oil has been used. By 
adding a small quantity of acid to the egg before using 
any oil prevents a possibility of the dressing separating. If 
the dressing is not to be used at once add I tablespoonful of 
hot water and mix well. This is also a preventive of 
separation. This dressing is a base for many appetizing 
combinations.

Yeast Mixtures 

Helpful Hints on Bread Making 

JREAD is the most important article of food in the 
daily diet. And the many processes employed in 
making and baking gives us a great variety of 
appetizing breads, that furnish the largest amount 
of food value for the least money expended. 

The process of making these yeast mixtures is most 
interesting, and a little careful study and practice will 
surely reward you for your time and trouble. 

The first essential for perfect bread is a good flour; 
second, careful manipulation and third, proper baking. 

The longer the batter is beaten, the less kneading the 
dough will require. When dough can be lifted in a mass 
on a spoon, it is ready to knead. 

Dough is kneaded to mix the ingredients thoroughly, 
to make the gluten elastic and to work in the air. It is 
sufficiently kneaded when it can be left on the board for 
a minute or more without sticking. 

In cool weather the bowl containing the dough may 
be set in a pan of warm water. To keep the dough from 
cooling, mix and knead it quickly. 

Quick handling prevents the dough from cooling and 
hastens the process of rising. 

Always make small loaves to insure bread being baked 
through; in large loaves the heat may fail to penetrate 
to the center of the loaf. 

If bread rises much after being put in the oven, the 
heat is not great enough, but if it begins to brown in 
less than fifteen minutes, the heat is too great. During 
the first ten minutes the loaves are in the oven they 
should merely rise and perhaps begin to show a little 
brown in spots; in the second period of ten minutes they 
should become a delicate brown all over the surface and 
cease to rise; in the third period they should finish 
browning, and in the fourth they should shrink slightly 
from the pans. After the first ten minutes the oven heat 
can be decreased slightly, and as baking continues it 
may be lessened still more. 



MRS. DE GRAF'S COOK BOOK [187] 

When baking is completed, the loaves will give forth a 
hollow sound when tapped, and will shrink from the pan. 

After baking remove bread at once from the pans and 
allow to cool in fresh air, uncovered. Do not put away 
until perfectly cold. 

For all rolls, plain or fancy, use the bread formula. 
If a richer dough is desired, changes may be made in the 
following manner: 

Use milk instead of water for liquid; both shortening 
and sugar may be increased by one tablespoon or more 
to each cup of liquid. Also the white of one egg may be 
added. With these changes it may be found necessary 
to use a little more flour. 

Dark breads are valuable for their mineral salts and 
coarse texture. They should be included in the diet 
particularly that of children and elderly persons. They 
are valued mainly for their laxative qualities. 

BREAD AND ROLLS 

Note. — All measurements are level and flour is sifted once before 
measuring. One-half pint measuring cup is used. 

Bread 

1 cup water or milk, scalded. H compressed yeast cake dis- 
1 tablespoon melted shortening. solved in M cup lukev?arm 

1 tablespoon sugar. water. 

1 teaspoon salt. Between 3 and 4 cups flour. 

Method of Preparation: Put shortening, sugar and 
salt in scalded liquid; let it stand until lukewarm, then 
add dissolved yeast and flour gradually, beating well 
until too stiff^ to stir. Turn on moulding board and knead 
in remaining flour until mixture is smooth, does not 
stick to the hands or board, and bubbles may be seen 
under the surface. Return to well-greased bowl, brush 
dough over with melted shortening, cover and allow to 
rise in a warm place to twice its original size, then knead 
down in a bowl and let rise again. This second kneading, 
after the dough has risen once, gives a much finer grain 
to bread and should always be used. When dough has 
again risen to double its size, it will be ready to shape 
into loaves or rolls. Place loaves in well-greased pans, 



[188] MRS. DE GRAF'S COOK BOOK 

having them about half full. Brush both bread and rolls 
with melted shortening, let them rise again to double 
their size and bake in a hot oven about forty-five min- 
utes for medium-sized loaves and from twenty to thirty 
minutes for rolls, according to size. 

This quantity of dough is for one large loaf of bread 
or pan of rolls. With one-half yeast cake used to each 
half-pint measuring cup of liquid, bread can be made 
and completed, if kept in a warm room, in about 5 hours. 
If a longer period be given to the rising process less 
yeast will be required. One-quarter yeast cake to each cup 
of liquid will be sufficient if dough is set over night. In 
either case the same method of preparation is used. 

If milk is used, scalding, while not essential, is an 
absolute test of its freshness. If scalded, cool to luke- 
warm, otherwise it will kill the yeast plant. 

For Prune or Raisin Bread 

Follow bread foundation recipe, adding 1 more table- 
spoon of sugar. When dough has risen once, add 1 cup 
of seedless raisins or pitted chopped prunes for each cup 
of liquid used and allow to double in size again, when 
the dough will be ready for loaves. Put in well-greased 
pans, let double in size, and bake in a hot oven 45 min- 
utes for a medium sized loaf. 

Another method of adding fruit: When shaping into 
loaves roll out dough for each loaf, cover with fruit and 
roll up like jelly roll. Place in greased pans and proceed 
as directed. After fruit has been added, the dough will 
take longer to rise than plain bread dough. 

Parker House Rolls 

Use bread foundation recipe. After dough has risen 
to double in size the second time, roll into a sheet about 
1 inch thick. Cut with biscuit cutter, then with the 
handle of a knife dipped in flour press lightly through 
the center of each roll, brush with melted shortening, 
fold over and place close together in a well-greased pan. 
Set in a warm place until light, then bake in a hot oven. 
When baked, brush over with melted shortening or the

gloss. 

Tea Rolls 

Use bread foundation recipe. When dough is light, 
knead slightly and cut in pieces about the size of a wal- 
nut. Brush with melted shortening; place close together 
in a well-greased pan.

improves these rolls. 

Clover Leaf Rolls 

Use bread foundation recipe. When dough is light, 
shape into balls about the size of a large marble, place 
in groups of three in well-greased muffin pans. Brush

hands or board. Place in well-greased bowl, brushing 
over top of dough with melted shortening. Allow to rise 
to 2}4 times its original size. This will take 2 hours or 
more. Then the dough is ready for the various coffee 
cakes. 

If a richer dough is desired, double the quantity of 
shortening and eggs, using only ^ cup of milk. 

Plain Coffee Cake 

Use coffee cake foundation recipe. When light, roll 
out to about 2 inches thick, place in well-greased shallow 
pan, and brush over top with yolk of egg diluted with 2 
tablespoons of milk and then sprinkle top with following 
mixture: 

}/2 cup of soft bread crumbs. 2 tablespoons sugar. 
Cinnamon. 2 tablespoons melted butter. 

Let coffee cake stand until light and bake in a mod- 
erate oven. 

Tea Ring 

Use coffee cake foundation recipe. When light, roll 
out to about yi inch thickness. Brush over with melted 



MRS. DE GRAF'S COOK BOOK [193] 

shortening, sprinkle with sugar, cinnamon and seedless 
raisins, or raisins and chopped walnuts. Roll up like a 
jelly roll, join the ends, forming a ring, place on well- 
greased pan, and with scissors cut ^ through the ring 
of dough in pieces about 2 inches apart. After cutting, 
turn each piece over, brush over with yolk of egg diluted 
with two tablespoons of milk. Let rise again and bake 
in a medium oven about 25 minutes. When baked, 
brush over top with unbeaten white of egg. This gives a 
high gloss. Have oven at moderate heat.

sired, seedless raisins. Roll up as for a jelly roll, and with 
a sharp knife cut in slices about \yi inch thick. Place 
these slices upright in a well-greased pan and stand in 
a warm place to rise. Allow to become very light before 
baking. These can be varied by sprinkling brown sugar 
in the pan after greasing and placing the slices on sugar. 
When baked, turn upside down, the brown sugar form- 
ing a candied top. Care should be taken not to use too 
hot an oven for these rolls. 

They can also be baked in muffin pans and treated in 
the same way. 



[194] MRS. DE GRAF'S COOK BOOK 

Plain Sweet Rolls 

Use coffee cake foundation recipe. When light, form 
into any desired shape, brush over with yolk of egg 
diluted with 2 tablespoons of milk. Allow to become 
light and bake. If perfect rolls are desired, do not put 
close together in pan. As soon as baked, brush over with 
egg yolk beaten with 2 tablespoons of milk to glaze. This 
should be done as soon as rolls are removed from the oven 
so the mixture will dry at once from heat of rolls. 

Rusks 

Use coffee cake foundation recipe. When light cut off 
pieces of dough the size of a walnut and place on a greased 
cookie pan about 3 inches apart. Brush over with the 
yolk of an egg to which two tablespoons of milk have been 
added. When light, bake in a medium hot oven, and, 
when baked, glaze with confectioners' icing, which is 
made by taking 1 tablespoon of hot water and adding 
enough powdered sugar to thicken; add a few drops of 
vanilla. 

Brioche

raisins. When light, form into balls, set on a greased pan 
some distance apart, smooth side up; brush with melted 
shortening and let rise. Before putting in a hot oven, cut 
a cross on top of each bun. When baked, brush rolls over 
with yolk of egg diluted with 2 tablespoons of milk. 



MRS. DE GRAF'S COOK BOOK [195] 

Raised Doughnuts 

Use coffee cake foundation recipe. When light, roll to 
yi inch thickness, cut with doughnut cutter, let stand 
until light and fry in deep fat. Drain, cool and sprinkle 
with powdered sugar. 



[196] MRS. DE GRAF'S COOK BOOK 

Toast 

Cut bread in y^ inch slices. Place over hot coals, on a 
heated electric toaster or in a heated boiler. Do not 
place too near the heat. Toast until a golden brown on 
each side. If desired very crisp do not butter before 
serving. If liked somewhat soft, butter and set in the 
oven a few minutes. 

Milk Toast 

Milk toast seems a simple dish, and is if the bread is 
treated to just the right amount of crispness. Cut the 
bread about ^2 inch thick; it should be toasted on each 
side until crisp, but not brittle. Each slice should be 
dipped, for only an instant, in hot salted water. This 
must be done quickly for the toast should not be soggy. 

Place slices on a hot platter and pour a thin white sauce 
over them. The sauce should be prepared before the 
toast is made and may be kept hot in a double boiler. 
Allow one cup of sauce to four slices of toast. Egg toast 
is made by adding one chopped, hard cooked egg to each 
cup of white sauce. Hot milk may be poured over crisp 
slices of buttered toast and served at once. 

French Toast 

Beat 2 eggs until light and creamy; add }4 teaspoon 
salt, a pinch of nutmeg and ^ cup of milk; mix well; 
cut bread in ^ inch slices, then cut in triangles; dip in 
the egg and milk mixture and then place in a well greased 
hot frying pan and cook on each side until a golden brown. 
Serve hot with generous teaspoons of jam or jelly in the 
center of each slice and sprinkle with powdered sugar. 

Croutons 

Cut dry bread into ^ inch slices; then cut into cubes. 
Place in a very moderate oven to dry and become brown.

Waffles and Griddle Cakes 

AFFLES, the most popular of all breakfast breads, 
are not found on the menu of the average house- 
wife due perhaps, to the general impression that 
they are difficult to make and bake and should 
be attempted only by professional cooks. So the waffle 
iron is not usually included in the general kitchen equip- 
ment, and the housewife does not have an opportunity to 
test out her ability to make satisfactory waffles. A 
waffle iron is not an expens ve piece of equipment and 
should be included among the kitchen necessities. The 
pleasure the household will derive from the occasional 
Sunday breakfast of hot, crisp waffles and maple syrup 
will amply repay for both the investment and the effort 
to produce this tempting breakfast bread. 

The waffle irons are made of iron or aluminum and 
come in two styles, the low iron to be used on a coal or 
wood range and the high iron for use over a gas flame. 
Then there is the electric waffle iron, made of aluminum 
to be used right on the table, so that each person served 
is sure to receive the waffle hot from the iron. 

The iron waffle iron, being less expensive, is the one 
most commonly used, and when new needs seasoning be- 
fore it can be used satisfactorily, otherwise the waffles will 
stick to the iron. Take the upper parts of the new waffle 
iron and boil for at least half an hour in boiling water and 
washing soda or washing powder. 

Then scrub well with a stiff brush, rinse in clean hot 
water and dry over the fire. Place in the lower portion, 
which has been washed well but not boiled. Grease the 
upper part lightly on both sides with beef suet or an un- 
salted fat and let remain over a low fire for an hour or 
more, turning frequently. The iron is then ready to use. 
The aluminum irons do not require this treatment; they 
are ready for use at once and do not need greasing. 

After using, the upper part of the waffle iron may be 
rubbed clean with soft paper. This is a much better 
method than using soap and water after the iron has been 



MRS. DE GRAF'S COOK BOOK [201] 

seasoned. The lower part may be washed, but should be 
well dried before setting away to prevent rusting. 

The batter for both waffles and griddle cakes is of about 
the same consistency. Many persons prefer a somewhat 
substantial griddle cake although the very thin ones are 
considered the best by epicures. The griddle cake batter 
does not require shortening. 

Waffles require the thinnest of batters. If it is not thin 
the waffles will not be crisp. The most efficient way of 
putting a batter together is to sift all of the dry in- 
gredients, then combine with the liquids, and beat well 
with an egg beater. For a very light batter the eggs 
should be beaten separately, the yolks mixed with the 
milk, then added gradually to the dry materials, the 
melted shortening is then beaten into the mixture, and 
the stiffly beaten egg whites folded in last. 

Beating the whole egg until light, then adding the milk 
and combining with the dry ingredients, and beating 
until smooth with the egg beater is a much easier method 
and will prove just as satisfactory, although perhaps 
not quite so airy as the first method. A standard recipe 
can be used in making any quantity of batter desired. 
One egg, 1 cup of milk, 1 cup of flour, 2 level teaspoons of 
baking powder, % teaspoon of salt and 1 tablespoon of 
melted shortening. This quantity of batter will make 3 
waffles. Now with these proportions in mind the house- 
keeper need not refer to a recipe but can make any num- 
ber of waffles desired. If sour milk is used take only one 
teaspoon of baking powder and add 3<C teaspoon of bak- 
ing soda to neutralize the acidity of the sour milk. If the 
milk is quite thick it may be necessary to use a little more 
than one cup in order to get the batter thin enough. 

When eggs are scarce or high in price 1 egg only can be 
used for 2 cupfuls of milk, flour, etc.; in that case 3^ cupful 
more milk should be used to make the batter of the right 
consistency. Cooked rice or other left-over cereal may be 
added to this batter to give variety. In that case use % 
cupful of the cooked cereal, and ^ cupful of flour, in- 
stead of the full cup of flour given in the foundation 
formula. 



[202] MRS. DE GRAF'S COOK BOOK 

Any of the self-rising pancake flours may be used for 
waffles by omitting the baking powder and following the 
waffle recipe. 

The waffle iron should be well heated and just before 
adding the batter grease the iron on the side nearest the 
flame; grease thoroughly, but lightly; turn the iron so 
that the greased portion is on top. This will grease the 
ungreased side, which is usually enough after the iron 
has been used several times. Place about 5 tablespoons 
of batter in the center of the iron. This will be suflScient 
to fill it. Lower the upper half of the iron and turn at 
once. Do not have the gas too high or the waffles will 
bake too quickly and not be thoroughly cooked and crisp. 
If the waffle iron has been properly heated the waffles 
will be evenly browned on both sides. 

Waffles should be served as soon as baked to be at their 
best. If, however, it is necessary to keep them for a short 
time, place on the wire rack in a warm oven, keeping each 
waffle separate. If placed on a plate and allowed to stand, 
the waffles will become heavy and soggy on the under- 
side. Serve only 1 waffle at a time to each person. If 
placed one on top of another they will not be crisp. Served 
with either maple syrup, jam or jelly, what could make a 
more palatable breakfast than hot, crisp waffles.'' 

Note. — All measurements are level and flour is sifted once before 
measuring. One-half pint measuring cup is used. 



Griddle Cakes 

1 cup flour. 1 egg. 

2 teaspoons baking powder. M cup milk. 
3^ teaspoon salt. 

Method of Preparation: The most simple and 
efficient way to put a batter together is to mix and sift 
the dry ingredients first, then mix the liquid and the 
well-beaten yolks of eggs and combine the mixtures. If 
using shortening, add it melted, and finally fold in the 
stiffly beaten whites of eggs. 

Eggs should always be beaten separately when light- 
ness is desired, but if time is limited the result will be 
satisfactory if eggs are beaten together. 



MRS. DE GRAF'S COOK BOOK [l203 ] 

For griddle cakes, the griddle should be well heated, 
and, if not soapstone or aluminum, should be greased. 
Drop batter by spoonfuls, and when puffed and full of 
bubbles and cooked on the edges, turn and brown on the 
other side. Never turn griddle cakes but once. Other- 
wise the}' will be heavy.

Biscuit Dough and Variations of Biscuit 
^ough 

Just why so many housewives fail to make a good bis- 
cuit seems strange, for this dough is one of the easiest 
mixtures to make. Perhaps failure is due to inaccurate 
measurements and too slow an oven. This type of dough 
requires a hot oven. Too often the amount of ingredients 
are a matter of guess work rather than of measurement, 
and, unless one is a skilled cook, the results of guesswork 
are usually indifferent. 

When sweet milk is used always remember that 2 level 
teaspoonfuls of baking powder are used to each cup of 
sifted flour. This never changes, no matter how many 
cups of flour you are using. 

There should be no taste of baking powder in the fin- 
ished product. If there is, then your measurements have 
not been level, or you are using a very poor quality of 
baking powder. 

When using sour or buttermilk, then soda will be your 
leavening agent. In that case remember that ^ a tea- 
spoon of soda is used to each cup of sour milk. Or you can 
use }i teaspoon of soda, to neutralize the acidity of 1 cup 
of sour milk and 1 teaspoon of baking powder to each cup 
of flour. 

Do not dissolve soda in the sour milk, as that process 
releases the gases too soon and the dough will be less 
light. Always sift the soda with the flour for biscuit 
doughs. Sour milk can be substituted for sweet milk in 
any recipe if these rules are followed. 

Perhaps you have never stopped to consider the pos- 
sibilities of the ordinary biscuit dough. This mixture is 
easily adaptable to variety. 

It is quickly mixed and baked and has the advantage 
of being one of the most inexpensive mixtures to make. 
Many very palatable desserts can be prepared from this 
dough, besides several varieties of bread. 

When the berry season begins come visions of old- 
fashioned shortcake, the kind made from biscuit dough, 



MRS. DE GRAF'S COOK BOOK [207] 

covered generously with crushed strawberries. These 
old-fashioned shortcakes may be made of any variety of 
fruits, fresh or cooked, but the strawberry is queen of 
them all. 

However, you must bear in mind that biscuit mixtures, 
to be at their best, should be served while fresh, generally 
direct from the oven. A heavy biscuit is usually due to 
inaccurate measurements and too slow an oven. This 
class of dough takes a hot oven. 

In the accompanying recipes the term shortening means 
fat, any kind you may prefer. Half butter and half lard 
always give satisfactory results, but as butter is very ex- 
pensive, and many people do not like lard, most any of 
the substitutes for either one will be found satisfactory. 

Desserts made of biscuit doughs will be found under hot 
desserts. 

Note. — All measurements are level and flour is sifted once before 
measuring. One-half pint measuring cup is used.

Pastry and Pies 




JONTRARY to the general opinion, pastry is not hard 
jto make. In fact, once the fundamental principles 
jare understood, pastry is much easier and more 
'quickly made than cake. And if pastry is not of the 
best, crisp and flaky, then it should be dropped from the 
list of desserts, because tough, soggy pie crust is neither 
appetizing nor wholesome. 

Pie is not an economical dish and poor pies are a waste 
of good material, for they should not be eaten. When 
making pastry, keep these rules in mind. Fat makes a pie 
crust crisp, therefore, to economize on shortening will 
produce poor pastry. The amount of air which is incor- 
porated in the dough makes the crust flaky, so the dough 
requires careful handling. Water makes pastry tough, 
and only enough should be used to hold the dough together. 
Pastry flour is recommended because it absorbs less mois- 
ture than a strong flour. However, the regular family 
flour will give good results. 

If all the ingredients are cold the dough will be much 
easier to handle. Warm shortening absorbs the flour, 
making a dense mixture in which no air is inclosed, and 
which becomes sticky and difficult to roll on the board. 
Chopping the fat into the flour is recommended. If 
rubbed in with the finger tips the warmth of the fingers 
will heat the fat somewhat unless the manipulation is 
quick and skillful. Do not rub or chop the fat into the 
flour too thoroughly; mix until the consistency of coarse 
meal. Plain crisp pastry has all the shortening added to 
the flour. For flaky pastry only half shortening is added 
to the flour and the remainder is rolled into the dough after 
the liquid has been added. 

When adding the cold water use a knife for mixing, add 
very slowly, using only enough to hold the mixture to- 
gether. If too much water is used it will be necessary to 
use more flour when the dough is rolled out, and if that is 
the case the pastry will be tough from handling and the fat 
and flour will not be in the right proportion. Use only a 
sprinkling of flour to keep the molding board dry, so that 



MRS. DE GRAF'S COOK BOOK [217] 

the dough may be rolled easily. After rolling, the pastry 
should be allowed to stand, closely covered, in a cool place. 
The moisture acts on the gluten in the flour, making it 
much easier to roll. Handle the dough as quickly and as 
lightly as possible. Bake in a hot oven, for no matter how 
carefully the dough has been made, if not properly baked 
the pie will be a failure. 

Unless carefully baked, undercrusts are often soggy. For 
this reason pastry shells baked without the filling will give 
the best results. If, however, a filled two-crust pie is 
desired, do not put the pastry and filling together until 
the oven is ready to receive them, for the moisture of the 
filling will soak into the pie crust. 

Pie crust should be rolled out to about one-eighth of an 
inch in thickness. When lining the pan, lay the crust on 
loosely and allow it to come a little over the edge. The 
scissors will be found the most convenient means of cutting 
the dough. If the pastry is stretched it will shrink and 
probably break while baking. When making fruit pies 
which may be very juicey, the undercrust can be brushed 
over with unbeaten white of an egg, which coagulates as 
soon as the heat reaches it and makes an impervious coat- 
ing. Or the bottom crust may be sprinkled with very fine 
dry bread crumbs or with a little flour which will absorb the 
excessive moisture at once and prevent the crust from 
becoming soaked. 

After the filling is put in, the top crust is placed in 
position; this should be rolled out about one-eighth of an 
inch thick also, and should extend about a quarter of an 
inch beyond the pie plate. Then fold the top crust under 
the bottom one and flute the edge either with the sfinger 
or a fork. Perforate the top crust so that the steam may 
escape — or the crust will be soggy on the under side and 
puff^ up in the center. If a very dark brown is desired the 
top crust may be brushed over lightly with milk. When 
making very juicy pies allow one tablespoon of flour to 
each cupful of sugar used. Mix sugar and flour until well 
blended, then sprinkle over the fruit. Or the pie may be 
bound around the edge with a narrow strip of cloth which 
has been dipped in either milk or water. 



[218] MRS. DE GRAF'S COOK BOOK 

When making pastry shells for a one-crust pie, invert a 
deep pie pan and place the pastry on it, pinching the edges 
to make a deep border. Prick the pastry in several places 
with a fork. Place in a hot oven; in about ten minutes the 
shell should be a golden color. It should be watched care- 
fully until ready to take from the oven. Remove from the 
tin and place the filling in the shell. 

Pastry for several pies may be made at one time, rolled 
and set in a cool place in a well-covered utensil until 
needed. This is sometimes a great advantage for a very 
busy housewife. Always serve pastry fresh or reheat if 
the pie is a day old and it will become crisp and fresh. 

There really is no mystery, no magic possessed by a 
favored few, to make good pastry. Just follow the general 
directions and you will surely have satisfactory results. 

Note. — All measurements are level and flour is sifted once before 
measuring. One-half pint measuring cup is used. 

Plain Pastry 

IK cups flour. y% cup shortening. 

J^ teaspoon salt. 3^ (about) cup cold v/ater. 

Sift flour and salt together. Chop shortening into the 
flour; add liquid gradually, using knife. This dough 
should become stiffs enough not to stick to the sides of the 
mixing bowl. Place dough on molding board and roll to 
yi inch thickness. Then fold one-third of this sheet of 
pastry over the center, fold the remaining third over the 
first fold, then fold across. Roll to one-fourth inch thick- 
ness again. 

This pastry can be used at once, but is improved if al- 
lowed to stand several hours. By folding the dough in 
this manner, layers of air are inclosed, which expand when 
the pastry is placed in the hot oven, making the pie flaky. 
While the oven should be hot at first the heat should be 
reduced after it has browned. 

Flaky Pastry 

V/2 cups flour. y^ cup butter. 

K teaspoon salt. K (about) cup of cold water. 

34 cup shortening. 

Proceed as for plain pastry, leaving out the butter, 



MRS. DE GRAF'S COOK BOOK [219] 

which should be washed in cold water until smooth and 
elastic, then dried. Roll out dough, place butter in the 
center, fold over dough as directed above, and roll out. 
Repeat this twice. Dough is then ready for use. If butter 
breaks through the dough, set aside until cool, when it can 
be easily handled. This pastry is for pastry shells, tarts, 
etc.

GENERAL RULES FOR MIXING AND 

BAKING CAKES

DOUGHNUTS 




[228] MRS. DE GRAF'S COOK BOOK 

Cakes with Shortening 

INCE cake comes on the list of luxuries, the utmost 
care should be taken both in the method of prep- 
aration and in the quality of material used. It is 
not difficult to make a good cake if good materials 
are used and care in measuring and combining ingredients 
is exercised. However, the baking requires more study 
and care than the mixing, for no matter how well you have 
put the cake batter together, if the oven is not right the 
cake will be a failure. In the first place, choose a reliable 
recipe, then assemble all necessary materials and utensils. 
Pans should be prepared and oven heated before mixing 
the cake batter. If the ingredients are all measured be- 
fore actual mixing begins the work will be much easier 
and unexpected interruptions will not create a doubt as 
to whether all the materials have been used. For success 
care must be taken in measuring, all measurements being 
level. For butter cakes there are two ways to add the 
shortening; for inexpensive cakes containing a small 
quantity of shortening the result will be found satisfactory 
if the fat is melted and added to the batter after the cake 
is all mixed. For the richer cakes, where ^ cup or more 
of shortening is used, the shortening is beaten to a cream, 
or until smooth and waxy. This can be accomplished 
easily if the mixing bowl is rinsed with hot water, then 
wiped dry before the shortening is placed in it. Add the 
sugar gradually to the creamed shortening and continue 
to beat until the mixture resembles whipped cream. 

Beating the butter to a cream first makes the creaming 
of butter and sugar an easy process. The eggs may then 
be added whole, one at a time, and beating the mixture 
thoroughly each time; or the eggs may be separated, 
beating the yolks until thick and lemon colored and the 
whites until stiff. Add the beaten yolks to the creamed 
butter and sugar mixture; add the sifted dry ingredients 
alternately with the liquid, beating the mixture well. Add 
some flour to the mixture before any of the liquid is used. 
This prevents the mixture from curdling which, while it 
does not spoil the cake, it will not be of the right texture. 



MRS. DE GRAF'S COOK BOOK [229] 

Adding the whole unbeaten egg to the batter produces a 
close textured, moist cake, while beating the eggs sepa- 
rately gives a light dryer cake. Water may be used in- 
stead of milk, the mixture will be of a different texture. 
If eggs are beaten separately the stiffly beaten whites 
should be carefully folded into the mixture. The more the 
cake is beaten before the egg whites are added the firmer 
will be the texture of the cake. 

Cakes should be baked as soon as mixed. A great deal 
depends on the proper baking, and the best way to assure 
satisfactory results is to time the cake and divide the time 
of baking into quarters. In the first quarter the mixture 
should rise in the pan; in the second quarter it should 
continued to rise and brown in spots; in the third quarter 
the top of the cake should be uniformly browned, and in 
the last quarter the cake should shrink from the sides of 
the pan and it should be baked. 

If in doubt as to whether the cake should be taken from 
the oven test it by touching lightly in the center. If 
baked, the mixture will spring back, but if not quite 
baked it will hold the imprint of the finger. 

This rule for timing applies to all cakes, whether layer 
or loaf, or where a slow or medium oven is used. 

The time for baking will vary a little for different ovens, 
but the average time for a medium-sized layer cake is 
from 15 to 20 minutes. Loaf cakes 3 inches thick will 
require about 40 minutes; sheet cakes and cup cakes 
about 25 minutes. Cakes baked in a brick shaped pan 
will require an hour or longer. A moderate oven will give 
the best results for nearly all cakes. 

If the batter rises in a cone in the center you are using 
too hot an oven, and a crust has formed before the mix- 
ture has had time to rise; or too much flour has been used. 

When the cake is baked, it should be allowed to cool 
before being turned from the pan, and it should cool so 
that there will be a circulation of air about it, to prevent 
the steam from condensing and giving a moist surface to 
the cake. 

A few formulae are all that is required to make many 
varieties of cake. Flavorings, fruits, nuts and the various 
fillings and icings will give an unlimited variety even 



[230] MRS. DE GRAF'S COOK BOOK 

though the same cake batter is used. The advantage of 
using one or two foundation recipes lies mainly in the fact 
that practice makes perfect and one can soon become 
expert in mixing and baking the cake better. 

There is a type of cake very popular that does not re- 
quire a standard cake batter. These cakes are more like 
meringues. They are very easy to make but somewhat ex- 
pensive. These require a special type of pan called a 
spring form. The rim is removable, leaving the cake on the 
bottom of the pan for it cannot be removed until cut in 
slices. Many very attractive cakes are made in these 
spring forms. 

Note. — All measurements are level and flour is sifted once before 
measuring. One-half pint measuring cup is used.

Boston Cream Pie 

Although called a pie this dish is really a cake. Make 
the quick cake and bake in 2 layers. For one cake make 
y^ of the French cream filling. When both cake and 
filling are cold, spread the filling between the layers and 
sprinkle powdered sugar over the top. 

Lady Finger Cake

late. 4 egg wliites stiffly beaten. 

K cup sugar. 3^ cup finely chopped walnuts. 

|4 cup cold water. 1 teaspoon vanilla. 

4 eggs yolked, beaten. Yi lb. lady fingers. 

Put unsweetened chocolate in the upper part of a double 
boiler; set over hot water to melt. When melted add sugar, 
water and beaten yolks. Cook until very thick, stirring 
occasionally. Ground chocolate needs no melting. Set 
aside until thoroughly chilled then prepare second part. 
Cream the butter until waxy; gradually add sugar, beat 
until creamy, then add vanilla and chopped nuts. Com- 
bine first and second mixtures and when thoroughly 
mixed fold in the stiflfly beaten egg whites. It is necessary 
to have a pan with a removable rim called a spring form. 
Cover the bottom of the pan with split lady fingers, then 
place split lady fingers close together all around the sides 
of the pan. If pan is slightly buttered the lady fingers 
can be pressed firmly to the pan, the bottom layer of lady 
fingers will help keep those on the sides in place. Pour in the 
chocolate mixture, cover top closely with lady fingers and 
set the cake in a cool place for at least 12 hours before 
serving. It will become firm enough to slice. Before serv- 
ing carefully remove rim of pan and cover the top with 
whipped cream. Decorate with cream pressed through 
a pastry bag or with walnut meats or cherries. This makes 
an unusually attractive dessert and will serve 12 persons.

pastry. Gradually add water using a knife for mixing. 
Roll on a very slightly floured board to fit a round cake 
pan, reserving the remaining dough to use later. Set in a 
cool place. For the second part beat egg whites until stiflF 
and yolkfe until creamy, add sugar gradually to yolks 
beating well with the egg beater. Add flavoring and care- 
fully fold in the flour and beaten egg whites. Cover the 
bottom of the pastry lined pan with jam and pour the 
cake mixture over that. Roll the remaining pastry into 
an oblong strip and cut into lengths ^ inch wide and long 
enough to fit loosely over the top of the pan. Wet the 
edges wit)i water and press firmly across the top of the 
pastry shell. Four strips each way crossing lattice fashion 
will be sufficient. Place in a fairly hot oven reducing the 
heat in 10 minutes to moderate. Bake until the cake 
springs back if touched lightly in the center. Cool before 
serving. This cake is like that sold in French confectioners 
under the same name.

Sponge Cakes 




|hen eggs reach a normal price it Is possible to in- 
dulge in the various types of sponge cakes and 
even angel cake does not seem impossibly extrava- 
gant. True sponge cakes are made without baking 
powder and are light, moist and delicate. They can be 
given to children and those who cannot eat rich cakes, or 
cakes containing shortening. An endless variety of small 
attractive cakes can be made from almost any good 
sponge cake formula, and are suitable for almost any 
occasion but particularly attractive for afternoon teas 
and children's parties. A true sponge cake contains no 
baking powder but is lightened entirely by the air which 
has been beaten into the eggs, and for that reason a whip 
egg-beater should be used to beat the egg whites, as this 
type of egg-beater incorporates approximately 3^ more 
air than a rotary egg beater. It is the expansion of this 
air, when placed in the oven, that leavens the cake and 
the more air incorporated, the lighter the cake will be. 
Sponge cakes made with baking powder do not require 
the number of eggs necessary for a true sponge cake. 
Liquid is added also to replace eggs. These sponge cakes 
may be beaten with a rotary egg beater for the baking 
powder will make them light. Such sponge cakes are 
quickly and easily made but while light and palatable are 
never so delicate nor fine in texture as the true sponge 
cakes. 

Pans containing a center tube are the most satisfactory 
for loaf sponge cake. The cakes will bake more evenly 
and much quicker in this type of pan. In fact for the best 
results with loaf cakes made without baking powder, a 
pan should be kept for this purpose only, for it should 
never be greased. As the cake rises it will cling to the 
sides of an ungreased pan, producing a lighter cake. For 
sponge cakes made with baking powder greased pans 
should be used. A true sponge cake should be cooled in 
the pan in which it is baked; having the pan inverted; in 
this way, the moist cell walls of the cake will not settle, 
but will stretch, making the cake light. Pans come pro- 



MRS. DE GRAF'S COOK BOOK [237] 

vided with little extensions to invert them or the pan may 
be raised on two saucers. The air must circulate around 
the cake. When cool the cake can easily be removed by 
running a flat knife between the cake and the pan. 

Quickness in putting sponge cake together is one of the 
essentials to success. To mix a true sponge cake, separate 
the yolks and whites of the eggs. Beat the yolks with a 
rotary egg beater until very creamy. Add the sugar 
gradually, beating constantly; add flavoring. Beat the 
egg whites with an egg whip until the bowl can be inverted. 
Fold very carefully into the next mixture, then care- 
fully fold in the flour. Do not beat the mixture after the 
flour is added, simply fold the ingredients over and over 
until all are well mixed or blended. If beaten or stirred, 
most of the work of inclosing a large amount of air will be 
undone by breaking these air bubbles. The cake should 
be put in the pan at once and placed in a moderate oven. 

For angel cake the whites of the eggs are beaten with 
an egg whip until the dish can be inverted; the sugar is 
carefully folded into them, adding gradually; then the 
flour folded into the mixture in the same manner. Use a 
moderate oven. An average sized loaf sponge cake will 
require about 50 minutes to bake. 

The cheaper sponge cakes where few eggs and baking 
powder is used are baked in a hotter oven than the true 
sponge cakes and may be baked in layers, a loaf, small 
cakes, or baked in a shallow pan and cut into small cakes. 

Sponge cakes are wholesome and delicate and offer a 
number of variations to be used for almost any occasion. 



Note. — All measurements are level and flour is sifted once before 
measuring. One-half pint measuring cup is used. 

Angel Cake 

^ cup whites of eggs. 1 teaspoon each almond and 

Yi teaspoon cream of tartar. lemon flavoring. 

Yi cup sugar. H cup flour. 

Beat egg whites until foamy, using a whip egg-beater; 
add cream of tartar, then beat eggs until very stiff and 
dry. This is most important, otherwise the cake will be 
tough and leathery. Add sugar gradually, carefully fold- 



[238] MRS. DE GRAF'S COOK BOOK 

ing it in; then add flavoring and lastly the flour, folding 
in gradually. Bake in an ungreased pan about 45 min- 
utes. 

This makes a small cake; double the quantity for a 
larger one, baking from SO to 60 minutes. 

True Sponge Cake 

5 egg yolks. J^ teaspoon cream of tartar. 

1 cup sugar. 1 teaspoon each lemon and va- 

1 cup flour. nilla. 

6 egg whites. 

Beat the yolks of eggs until thick; add sugar gradually, 
beating with the egg-beater; add flavoring. Beat the 
whites of the eggs until stiff and firm, using a whip egg- 
beater; fold carefully into the egg yolk mixture, then 
gradually fold in the flour. Pour into an ungreased tube 
cake pan and bake in a slow oven about 50 minutes. 

This formula will make two dozen small cakes. 

Plain Sponge Cake 

3 eggs . 1 teaspoon baking powder. 

1 cup sugar. 34 teaspoon salt. 

3 tablespoons, water. 1 teaspoon vanilla. 

1 cup flour. 1 teaspoon lemon. 

Beat the eggs without separating until light and creamy, 
add sugar gradually and beat again till thick and very 
light colored. Add water, beat again, add sifted dry in- 
gredients. Beat well, then add flavoring. Pour into a 
greased cake pan, one with center tube preferred, and bake 
about 30 minutes in a moderate oven, or bake in layers. 

Chocolate Sponge Cake 

Use either sponge cake recipe, omitting 2 tablespoons 
of flour and substituting 1 tablespoon of cocoa or 2 of 
ground chocolate. Use vanilla flavoring only. 

Jelly Roll 

Use plain sponge cake foundation, but separate the 
eggs, beating each well. Proceed as above, adding 1 
tablespoon of melted shortening and folding in the stiffly 
beaten whites of eggs last. Have a shallow pan well 



MRS. DE GRAF'S COOK BOOK [239] 

greased and covered with greased paper. Pour in cake 
mixture and bake in a hot oven between 10 and 12 min- 
utes. Turn at once onto a cloth which has been sprinkled 
with powdered sugar, remove paper, cut off crusts, spread 
with jelly and roll. (This must be done quickly.) Wrap 
in cloth until cool and sprinkle with powdered sugar. 

Chocolate Roll 

6 eggs, beaten separately.. ]/z cup ground chocolate. 

]/z cup granulated sugar. 1 teaspoon vanilla. 

Beat yolks until creamy with a rotary egg-beater; add 
sugar and chocolate gradually, beating well; add flavor- 
ing. Whip egg whites until very stiff, and fold carefully 
into the mixture. Line a well greased pan with greased 
paper and pour in the mixture. Bake in a moderate 
oven 25 minutes. Turn out on a towel, remove paper and 
roll as for jelly roll. Set aside to cool. Whip 1 cup of 
cream, add 2 tablespoons of powdered sugar and 1 table- 
spoonful of vanilla. Unroll cake, spread with whipped 
cream, reroll and serve with a chocolate sauce.

Icings and Fillings 



Cake icings and fillings have improved greatly both 
in quality and variety from those used a generation 
ago. Now many of these frostings are as delicate and 
fine as the creamy French confectionery. A few founda- 
tion recipes form the basis for most of these icings 
and fillings, and when these are once mastered it will 
be possible to produce almost any variety. The de- 
velopment of these foundation recipes is both interest- 
ing and simple. The uncooked icings are the easiest, 
for very little skill is necessary in their preparation. 

The plain confectioner's icing is made of hot water, 
powdered or confectioner's sugar and flavoring. 

Other liquids than water offer a number of variations 
of this plain recipe. Cream, with vanilla or mocha flavor- 
ing, makes a rich, creamy icing; lemon juice may replace 
a portion of the hot water for lemon icing; pure fruit 
juices, such as orange, pineapple, etc., make excellent 
icings and will be found particularly good for sponge 
cakes. Strong, hot coffee or mocha extract may replace 
the hot water, making the mocha icing. 

When using other liquids than water it is not necessary 
to heat them. Confectioners' icing will become firm and 
glossy soon after being spread on the cake. It never be- 
comes hard and "sugary" and keeps for some time, and 
does not crumble when cut. 

Chocolate confectioners' icing may have }i cup of 
chopped nuts added or equal quantities of chopped nuts 
and chopped raisins. It may also be changed somewhat 
by using either vanilla or cinnamon to flavor. This plain 
foundation recipe has many possibilities for variety and 
is so quickly and easily made, there need be no waste. 

The quantities given in the recipe will ice an average- 
sized cake. If this quantity is not right for the size cake 
you wish, a little practice will soon teach you the right 
proportions. One of the best features of this type of frost- 
ing is that you are really unable to spoil it. If you have 
not been accurate in your measurements and the icing is 



MRS. DE GRAF'S COOK BOOK [241] 

too thick add more liquid until of the right consistency, 
or if the icing is too thin more sugar may be added. 

Butter icings are also uncooked and are very easily 
prepared. This type of icing is more often used as a cake 
filling, and is very popular. Unsalted butter will give the 
best flavored icing, but if salted butter is used it should 
be well washed in cold water to remove all the salt. 

The cooked icings are not quite so easily made. This 
class of icing has much greater possibilities for variety 
than the uncooked icing. There are several varieties of 
boiled icings, but this usually applies to a sugar syrup 
which has been boiled until the mixture will form a "soft 
ball" when tested in cold water (about 238 degrees F. on 
a sugar thermometer), then the syrup is added gradually 
to the well-beaten white of egg. To test carefully dip a 
teaspoon into the syrup and drop into cold water. Roll 
between the fingers under the water. If syrup is sticky 
it is not cooked enough; if hard it is cooked too long. It 
should roll in a soft ball. Always use a fresh cup of cold 
water for each testing. 

This icing will never prove a failure if the rules and de- 
tails of the process are carefully followed. Sugar has a 
tendency to crystallize and to overcome this, care must 
be taken when mixing the water and sugar. First add 
the sugar to the saucepan, then carefully pour over the 
water, which should be boiling hot, so that the sugar will 
dissolve at once. Do not stir and cause crystals of sugar 
to adhere to the sides of the saucepan; simply mix suffi- 
ciently to dissolve the sugar, then cover the saucepan and 
when the syrup reaches the boiling point remove the 
cover and cook to the soft-ball stage without stirring. 

By covering the mixture until boiling point is reached, 
the steam will wash down any grains of sugar which may 
have gathered on the sides of the pan. This may sound 
complicated, but is really very simple, and if these pre- 
cautions are taken and the syrup cooked to the "soft- 
ball" stage, the finished icing will be creamy. If these 
rules are not followed, if the syrup is stirred while cook- 
ing, or if cooked too long, the icing will be hard and 
sugary. 



[242] MRS. DE GRAF'S COOK BOOK 

A very much easier cooked icing is made by cooking 
the syrup over hot water or in a double boiler. This is 
called quick icing. 

This is a very simple and satisfactory method and if 
the directions are followed exactly this icing may be used 
for filling and icings in place of the more complicated 
boiled frosting. 

Note. — All measurements are level and flour is sifted once before 
measuring. One-half pint measuring cup is used. 



Boiled Icing 

13^ cups granulated sugar. Yi cup hot water. 

Whites of 2 eggs. 

Add hot water to sugar, being careful not to stir so 
there will be no sugar on sides of saucepan, cover until 
boiling point is reached, then remove and cook syrup 
until it will form a soft ball v/hen rolled between the fingers 
in a cup of cold water. Pour on well-beaten whites of eggs 
and beat until stiff, then flavor. 



Quick Icing 

^/i cup sugar. 1 egg white. 

3 tablespoons cold water. 

Put sugar, water and unbeaten egg white into a double 
boiler, place over boiling water and beat with an egg 
beater for 6 minutes. Remove from the fire and beat 
until thick enough to spread; add flavoring. 



Confectioner's Icing 

2 tablespoons hot water. }/i teaspoon lemon flavoring. 

Confectioner's sugar. 

To the hot water add enough confectioner's sugar to 
make stiff enough to spread. Do not use this icing on a 
hot cake or it will melt. Any fruit juice may be used in- 
stead of water. Orange juice and grated rind are partic- 
ularly satisfactory. 



MRS. DE GRAF'S COOK BOOK [243] 

Chocolate Confectioner's Icing and Filling 

2 squares unsweetened choco- IJ^ cups powdered sugar, 
late or H cup ground chocolate, l^ cup hot water. 
1 teaspoon butter. 1 teaspoon vanilla. 

Melt chocolate and butter over hot water. When 
melted add sugar, then hot water gradually, beating until 
smooth, then add flavoring. Let stand until thick enough 
to spread between layers. If used for icing only, can be 
used at once. 

This filling may be varied by using cinnamon as flavor- 
ing or by using hot coff"ee instead of water. 

Also, either chopped walnuts or raisins may be added. 
Do not put between layers while they are hot or the 
filling will melt. 

Caramel Icing and Filling 

V/i cups brown sugar. 1 teaspoon butter. 

4 tablespoons milk. i^ teaspoon vanilla. 

Put sugar in a saucepan, add milk and stir until dis- 
solved. Place over the fire and when mixture starts to 
boil cook 3 minutes. Take from the fire at once, add 
butter, turn into a cold bowl and beat until creamy; then 
add vanilla. 

This may be used as an icing or filling. One-third cup of 
chopped walnuts may be added for the filling. 

Creole Icing 

Make the quick icing. Beat until thick and pile on top 
of a loaf cake. When firm, pour over the top melted, un- 
sweetened chocolate, or make half the chocolate icing and 
use in the same manner. This gives a chocolate cream 
top. The cake should be cut in small squares. 

Divinity Icing

Small Cakes and Cookies 

Little cakes and cookies are so attractive and easy to 
serve. They make nice gifts, too, for those who do not 
have the time or the facilities for baking at home. And how 
the children love cookies or cakes which have been made 
especially for them! The mother who is always too busy 
or lacks the imagination and skill to cater to children: 
who never makes wonderful animal cookies or fat, dumpy 
gingerbread or doughnut men, has really deprived her off- 
spring of untold pleasure. Not only the eating of these 
mysterious, delightful creations, but to stand and watch 
them being made and to wait irripatiently what seems 
ages before these miracles come out of the oven, all brown 
and fragrant. The memory of these childish joys is never 
forgotten. 

Any household department can supply inexpensive 
cookie cutters. They come in most attractive shapes — 
all sorts of animals, chickens, birds, stars, diamonds and 
hearts. So, if time is limited, animal cookies can easily 
take the place of the gingerbread man. 

Any rolled cookie recipe will be satisfactory. Only 
after the dough is mixed, set aside in a cool place for at 
least one hour, longer, if possible, to allow the dough to 
stiffen so it can be easily handled. Try not to work in a 
warm room when rolling and cutting and the process will 
be much easier. Lay the gingerbread man on a greased 
cookie sheet as you make him — then he won't have to be 
moved. Use vv^hole allspice for the eyes, the star of a clove 
for the nose; a pointed knife will make a slit for the mouth 
— upturned, or not, as you wish — and dried currants or 
seedless raisins will answer for buttons down the front. 
The doughnut man is made by simply putting the round 
parts taken from the center together in the shape of a 
man and patting and joining them together. Or fry these 
centers; they make golden brown balls that can be rolled 
in sugar. The children will call them fried holes — -which 
is really the right name after all. 

Muffin pans can be used to advantage for a variety of 
little cakes. Almost any cake batter may be used — Cup, 



MRS. DE GRAF'S COOK BOOK [249] 

Pound, Devil's Food or Nut Cakes or Sponge Cake batter. 
Baked in this form the cakes may be decorated in many 
ways without requiring much time or effort. Turn up- 
side down (cutting a small piece off of the base so they will 
stand level) and either ice all over or just on top. Half a 
nut meat or chopped nuts may be placed on the fresh 
icing before it hardens; or cocoanut, candied fruits or 
marshmallows. They can be elaborately trimmed with a 
pastry bag, or the top may be cut off completely, then 
scoop out a small portion of the center and fill the space 
with whipped cream (using a pastry bag, if possible). 

Now cut the top or lid in two in the center and replace, 
pushing down the center edges, and let the outside look 
like a half opened basket filled with whipped cream. 
Shallow sponge cakes are very attractive when baked in 
muffin pans, then iced, split half way through the center 
and filled with whipped cream, French cream or a me- 
ringue. Any favored cake recipe may be used to make 
these little cakes, and there is no form in which to make 
them that requires so little skill to make decorative. 

Cream puffs and eclairs are not difficult to make and 
can be made any size desired. For gift boxes, make about 
as big as a chocolate cream, place each small cream puff 
in a little paper case such as candy is packed in, then 
place in boxes and they will look wonderfully tempting. 

Dropped cookies are very easy to make and offer great 
variety. Any cake batter may be used. Drop from the 
tip of a spoon on a greased cookie pan, several inches 
apart, and bake in a medium oven. An ordinary cake 
recipe will make a good many cookies. They may be 
sprinkled with nuts or candied fruit, cocoanut, etc. Filled 
cookies are very rich and are made by spreading a filling 
on top of one cookie, then placing another on top, press- 
ing the edges firmly together. 

Little cakes and cookies are even more attractive than 
home made candies. Packed neatly in gay little boxes and 
tied with ribbons, they will prove a very acceptable gift. 
And for the informal social gatherings, always so popular 
during the holidays, little cakes and cookies offer many pos- 
sibilities.

meringues into round or oval shapes. Dredge with gran- 
ulated sugar, and, if desired, sprinkle with shredded al- 
monds. Bake in a cool oven about 45 minutes for medium- 
sized meringues. They should not show any color until 
the last 10 minutes of baking, and then only allowed to 
color delicately. Remove paper from the board and peel 
it from the meringues. If the under portion is still soft, 
they may be set back in the oven upside down to dry 
them off.

[256] MRS. DE GRAF'S COOK BOOK 

Custards and Custard Desserts 

|iLK and eggs are probably the most important foods 
in the diet. Either milk alone or milk and eggs 
constitute the diet of children and invalids and 
also are an important factor in the nutrition of 
healthy adults. The desirable qualities in milk are in no 
way destroyed by ordinary cooking. Whole milk con- 
tains all the food principles — protein, carbohydrates, water 
and minerals. Milk should be scalded not boiled as boiling 
renders it somewhat indigestible. Eggs also contain all 
the necessary food principles and are very easily digested 
if cooked at moderate heat. The combination of milk and 
eggs, furnish many palatable wholesome desserts. Custards 
are divided into two classes, the boiled or liquid custards 
which are steamed or cooked over hot water on top of the 
range; the baked or solid custard which is steamed in the 
oven. All custard mixtures should be set in hot water to 
cook and the water kept just under the boiling point. This 
gives the moderate heat required for all custards and pre- 
vents the custard reaching the boiling point. If cooked 
too fast or directly in a dry heat the mixture will separate 
and curdle. Certain rules govern the making of custards 
whether they are to be cooked in the oven or on top of the 
stove. Milk should be heated in a double boiler or over hot 
water, when bubbles appear on the surface the milk is 
scalded. Eggs should be beaten slightly just enough to mix 
the yolk and white. When eggs are used as a thickening 
medium as in custards,they are not beaten until light. Sugar 
is gradually added to the eggs and the hot milk poured over 
the egg and sugar mixture. Eggs should not be added to a 
hot mixture; the hot liquid should be added to the eggs, 
otherwise the eggs would cook as they were added to the 
milk and the mixture would not be smooth. The custard 
is now ready to steam or bake. All custard puddings, pies, 
etc., are first mixed in this manner. The type of custard 
desired depends upon the number of eggs used to each cup 
or half pint of milk. One egg to a cupful of milk will give 
a liquid custard; or two yolks of eggs will give the same 
results as to consistency; a custard made entirely of egg 



MRS. DE GRAF'S COOK BOOK [257] 

yolks is much richer than one made of whole eggs. Two 
eggs to a cupful of milk will give a solid custard if baked 
and served in individual custard cups. But if the custard 
is to be unmolded and hold its shape perfectly, it will re- 
quire three eggs for each cupful of milk. A custard pie 
filling will be firmer if three eggs are used for each cupful of 
milk. When custards are to be served from the dish in 
which they were baked two eggs to each cupful of milk 
is sufficient. 

Junkets are a form of custard. They are very wholesome 
and digestible. Thej?^ are made of milk thickened with ren- 
net. Rennet is supplied in the form of Junket Tablets. 
Junket desserts and custards are particularly good for 
children and can be given to babies who are just beginning 
to eat solid food. 

The cooking of custards requires care especially the 
liquid or soft custard. It must be stirred constantly until 
it thickens which can be determined by a thin coating that 
will cling to the spoon. Remove from the fire at once, stir 
for a few seconds as the heat of the utensil will finish the 
cooking. Turn at once into a cold bowl and when partly 
chilled add the flavoring. If by any chance the custard 
has been over cooked and looks curdled pour at once into 
a cold bowl and beat with a rotary egg beater. This will 
probably restore it but it will not be quite as creamy. The 
inexperienced cook will find that for each cupful of milk 
one-half teaspoonful of corn starch may be added to the 
sugar; this will usually prevent separation or curdling. 
However the custard will not be quite so delicate. All 
delicate puddings made with a custard foundation or with 
many eggs, require a moderate heat and should be set in 
a pan of hot water to cook, the water being kept under the 
boiling point. 

Soft Custard 

1 egg or 2 egg yolks. H cup sugar. 

1 cup milk. 1 teaspoon vanilla. 

Scald milk in a double boiler; beat eggs slightly, add 
sugar gradually. Pour hot milk over the mixture and stir 
until sugar is dissolved. Then set over hot water and stir 



[258] MRS. DE GRAF'S COOK BOOK 

gently, over a low fire until custard thickens and coats 
the spoon. Remove from the fire at once, stir a few seconds 
and turn into a cold bowl. Add flavoring when partly 
cold. This custard is used as a sauce. 

Baked Custard 

4 eggs. 1 teaspoon vanilla. 

2 cups milk. Nutmeg. 

Yi, cup sugar. 

Scald milk in a double boiler; beat eggs slightly, add 
sugar, then pour hot milk over mixture. Add vanilla and 
pour into custard cups or a baking dish, sprinkle top with a 
little nutmeg and set dish in a pan of hot water and place 
in a moderate oven. Bake until firm in the center which 
can be determined by plunging a knife through the center. 
If the knife comes out clean the custard is baked. Indi- 
vidual custards will bake in about 20 minutes. If baked in 
a large dish about 45 minutes. 

Caramel Custard 

K cup granulated sugar. Baked custard recipe. 

Put the dry sugar in a saucepan over a low fire and stir 
constantly until it forms a golden syrup. The sugar goes 
through several stages before it melts and great care must 
be taken not to burn it or there will be a bitter taste. As 
the sugar melts remove the pan from the fire and stir letting 
the heat of the pan accomplish some of the melting. This 
prevents the chance of burning. When sugar is melted 
pour into warm custard cups or baking dish. If cups are 
warm, the syrup can be spread before it hardens. Pour 
in the prepared custard and bake. The caramel forms a 
sauce for the custard. 

Chocolate Custard 

Add 3^ cup of ground chocolate to the sugar when 
making the custard, or melt 2 squares of unsweetened 
chocolate and add to the mixture. This applies to both 
soft and baked custards. 



MRS. DE GRAF'S COOK BOOK [259

very nice dessert if covered with a soft custard. 

Cake Pudding 

Slices of stale cake, macaroons or lady fingers can be 
served covered with a soft custard and make a most 
palatable dessert. 

Floating Island 

2 egg yolks. J^ cup sugar. 

1 egg. 1 teaspoon vanilla. 

V/i cups milk. 

Scald milk; beat yolks and egg slightly; gradually add 
sugar. Pour hot milk over mixture; stir until sugar is 
dissolved then cook over hot water until mixture is 
creamy and coats the spoon. Pour into a serving dish 
and add vanilla. Beat the whites of 2 eggs until stiflF, 
gradually add 2 tablespoons of sugar. Drop by table- 
spoonfuls into boiling water and cook under boiling point 
for about 3 minutes. Remove with a skimmer and place 
on top of custard. Set aside to cool and just before serv- 
ing place a teaspoonful of red jelly or jam in the center of 
each island. 



[260] MRS. DE GRAF'S COOK BOOK 

Prune Whip 

1 cup prune pulp. 1 teaspoon vanilla. 

3 egg whites. ]/i cup granulated sugar. 

H cup chopped walnuts. 

Put cooked pitted prunes through a coarse sieve. Beat 
whites of eggs very stiff with a whip egg-beater; fold in 
the sugar, prune pulp, chopped walnuts and vanilla. Pile 
lightly in a baking-dish and bake in a pan of hot water 
about 30 minutes in a rather slow oven until perfectly 
firm. Serve cold with whipped cream or a custard sauce 
made of 2 of the egg yolks. Any other cooked fruit may 
be used. 

Apricot Souffle 

3 eggs, separated. 2 tablespoons finely chopped 

3^ cup sugar. almonds. 

1 cup cooked mashed apricots. 1 teaspoon pineapple flavoring. 

Beat whites of eggs very stiff with a whip egg-beater; 
beat yolks with rotary egg-beater until creamy. Grad- 
ually add sugar to egg yolks, beat well, add apricots, nuts 
and flavoring. Carefully fold in the egg whites. Pile in a 
baking dish, set dish in a pan of hot water and bake in a 
moderate oven until firm in the center. Serve hot with a 
sauce made of the apricot juice. 

Junket 

2 cups milk. 1 jimket tablet. 

]/2 cup sugar. 1 teaspoon vanilla. 

Ys teaspoon salt. 

Heat the milk to luke warm only; add sugar and salt. 
Crush the junket tablet, add to mixture and stir until 
dissolved; add vanilla (which may be omitted for young 
children). Pour into a serving dish and let stand in a 
warm place until thick. Junket is quite different from 
the usual form of dessert as it is kept warm in order to 
thicken. The rennet will not thicken the milk if it is cold 
or hot, it must only be luke warm. Junket may be served 
plain or with thin or whipped cream.

dish is filled. Pour over the baked custard mixture, set 
in a pan of hot water and bake in a moderate oven until 
firm in the center.

Sweet Short Cakes 

First Part: Second Part: 

2 eggs. 1 cup whipping cream. 

1 cup sugar. 2 tablespoons powdered sugar. 

2 cups flour. Fruit. 
2 teaspoons baking powder. 

Yi cup milk or water. 
}/2, cup melted shortening. 
1 teaspoon vanilla. 
1 teaspoon lemon. 

Sift dry ingredients in first part, except sugar; beat eggs 
until very light, add sugar gradually, beating with egg- 
beater. When creamy, add dry ingredients alternately 
with liquid, mixing well. Add flavoring and melted short- 
ening. Bake in two layers in a rather hot oven. Cool. 
Just before serving beat cream and add sugar. Spread ^ 
of the cream over one layer and cover with drained cooked 
fruit or sweetened berries. Place on the second layer, 
cover with remaining cream and arrange fruit in even 
rows over the top. Sprinkle with powdered sugar. 



HOT PUDDINGS— STEAMED AND BAKED 

The secret of light steamed pudding is having the water 
constantly boiling during the entire period of steaming. 
The water should be two-thirds the depth of the mold. A 
kettle of boiling water should be kept to replenish the 
water as it boils down. If the water in which the pudding 
is cooked is not constantly boiling the pudding will be 
heavy. Grease the mold and cover v/ell, and dredge gener- 
ously with sugar. This makes the dark puddings glossy 
on the surface. The time allowed for steaming is approxi- 
mately an hour for each cupful of flour or bread crumbs 
used. The pudding may be tested by removing the cover 
after it has cooked about the required time. If it springs 
back when pressed in the center the pudding is cooked; 
if not replace cover and steam longer. Steamed or baked 
puddings made of a batter provide a substantial dessert.

BREAD PUDDING VARIATIONS MANY AND 

TEMPTING, WITH HUMBLE DESSERT 

GLORIFIED 

The humble bread pudding is, perhaps, the most 
familiar of all hot desserts. However, it is not always 
a popular favorite, and, sad to say, not always palat- 
able, because too much bread is used in its making. 
The bread in a bread pudding is used merely to hold 
the other ingredients together and to supply a back- 
ground for flavors, not as a means of using a quan- 
tity of dry bread. A well-made bread pudding is a 
very palatable dessert and is capable of an almost endless 
number of variations. 

Remember, a pudding of this kind forms a hearty, sub- 



[272] MRS. DE GRAF'S COOK BOOK 

stantial dessert and is also easily digested. The following 
rules, if carefully adhered to, will enable anyone to make 
a delicate, smooth pudding: Always soak the bread in 
water, scald the milk, add other ingredients, and bake the 
pudding slowly. The bread must be soaked in water to 
produce lightness and delicacy. The milk is scalded be- 
cause scalded milk makes the pudding smoother than raw 
milk. 

The pudding is baked slowly in order that the eggs and 
milk will not curdle, as they might if baked in too hot an 
oven. The bread should be soaked in the cold water to 
cover for 20 minutes or more. Then press out all the 
water and crumble the bread into small pieces. Scald the 
milk and add salt, sugar, shortening, the well-beaten eggs 
and flavoring. Pour the mixture over the bread and stir 
well. Pour all into a well-greased pudding dish, and bake 
about 40 minutes in a slow oven for a medium sized pud- 
ding. If the dish containing the pudding is placed in a pan 
of hot water and baked, there will be less danger of too 
much heat. All custard mixtures are better baked in this 
manner. The mixture will appear thin, but will thicken 
sufficiently when baked. 

If a very thick pudding is desired more eggs may be 
added, or a teaspoon of cornstarch may be mixed to a thin 
paste with cold milk and added to the scalded milk. Use 
this quantity of cornstarch for each pint or two cups of 
milk. More bread will also thicken the pudding, but it 
will not be so delicate. 

All of these puddings may have a meringue added and 
in that case use only the yolks of the eggs in the foundation 
recipe, reserving the white for the meringue; or use 2 egg 
yolks and 1 whole egg for the pudding. After the pudding 
is baked spread with jelly or jam and then the meringue. 
A well-made meringue is light and adds much in appear- 
ance and taste to any dessert. But a poor, tough meringue 
is a waste of good material. 

For the bread pudding meringue use 2 egg whites, 4 
tablespoons of granulated sugar, yi teaspoon of vanilla 
flavoring. Eggs should be beaten until the bowl can be 
inverted without fear of their slipping from it; then add 
sugar, 1 tablespoon at a time, beating well or until mix- 



MRS. DE GRAF'S COOK BOOK [273] 

ture will hold its shape. Flavor and spread over pudding 
and place on the top grate in a very moderate oven. The 
meringue should not begin to color for at least 5 minutes 
and will take 8 minutes to cook sufficiently and become a 
delicate brown. The meringue may be varied by adding 
1 tablespoon of ground chocolate. Powdered sugar never 
gives as satisfactory meringue as granulated sugar. 

Marshmallows may be used instead of the meringue. 
When the pudding is baked set 6 or 8 marshmallows on 
top, return to the top grate of the oven and cook until 
slightly melted and a golden brown. The plain bread 
pudding may be served with various pudding sauces. 
If individual puddings are liked, bake the bread pudding 
in custard cups or ramekins. 

Custard Bread Pudding 

1 thick slice of bread. 2 eggs. 

2 cups scalded milk. 1 teaspoon vanilla. 
]4 cup sugar. Grating of nutmeg. 

Soak bread in cold water to cover 15 minutes, then 
press dry and measure 1 cupful. Beat eggs, add sugar, 
hot milk, bread crumbs and flavoring. Pour into a buttered 
baking dish, sprinkle with nutmeg. Set in a pan of hot 
water and bake in a moderate oven until firm. Or, omit 
1 egg for a meringue. When pudding is baked, spread 
with jelly or jam, add meringue and brown in a slow 
oven. Serve hot or cold. 

Cocoanut Bread Pudding 

Follow above recipe, using 1 cup of cocoanut in place 
of the raisins. 

Butterscotch Bread Pudding 

Butterscotch bread pudding is made by substituting 
brown sugar for the granulated sugar, using the custard 
bread pudding recipe. Place the brown sugar in a sauce- 
pan, add the butter and cook until all the sugar is melted; 
then add the scalded milk and stir until dissolved. The 
brown sugar may cause the milk to curdle slightly, but 
when the pudding is baked this will disappear and the 
pudding will be smooth and fine in texture. 



[274] MRS. DE GRAF'S COOK BOOK 

Fruit Bread Pudding 

Fruit bread pudding is made by adding a cup of seed- 
less raisins and % teaspoon cinnamon to custard bread 
pudding recipe. 

Caramel Bread Pudding 

Make the custard bread pudding using 1 cupful of 
sugar instead of ^ of a cup. Take half of the sugar and 
cook in a saucepan over the fire until melted and a golden 
brown. This will require constant stirring. When cooked 
add the milk very slowly and cook until carameled sugar 
is dissolved; then follow the foundation recipe. 



Chocolate Bread Pudding 

Chocolate bread pudding is made by adding 1 square 
of unsweetened chocolate to the milk, while it is heating 
or by using only ]4. cup of sugar and J^ cup of ground 
chocolate. Follow the custard bread pudding recipe. 



Maple Bread Pudding 

Maple bread pudding is made by substituting either 
maple syrup or maple sugar for the granulated sugar in 
the custard bread pudding recipe.

meg. Repeat until all materials are used, having last layer 
crumbs; dot with butter and sprinkle with sugar. Cover 
and bake in a hot oven until apples are tender. Uncover 
and brown. Serve with cream, or hard or liquid sauce.

over the beaten egg mixture; flavor with 1 teaspoon of 
vanilla and pour over the bread; cover and bake in a mod- 
erate oven about 20 minutes. Uncover and brown. Serve 
with a caramel sauce.

Baked Apple 



A baked apple can be a real treat if properly cooked. 
For the best results in cooking select a rather sour apple 
not too ripe. If the apples are of fine flavor no other sea- 
soning is necessary, but if somewhat tasteless a small 
piece of stick cinnamon, a little freshly grated nutmeg, a 
few cloves, a slice of lemon or orange, any one of these 
flavorings may be used. A little butter adds greatly to 
any dish made of apples. 

Be sure the core has all been removed, for it is both un- 
pleasant and dangerous to get a piece of the tough core 
in the throat. 

Either granulated or brown sugar may be used to 
sweeten baked apples, each giving a diff"erent flavor. For 
variety the fruit can be stuff"ed before baking with raisins 
and walnuts, prunes, mince meat or an uncooked custard. 
Or after baking the cores may be filled with jelly or orange 
marmalade. These are just a few suggestions for variety. 

Wash and core 6 apples. You can purchase an appliance 
which does this work quickly and well. After apples are 
cored, remove a portion of the skin, about ^ inch wide, 
from the center of the apple. Place in a pan with a cover 
or in a casserole, and pour over the fruit a syrup made of 
1 cup of boiling water and 1 cup of sugar boiled about 5 
minutes. Cover tightly and bake in a moderate oven 
until apples are soft, but not broken. 

Twenty-five minutes is about the time required for bak- 
ing medium-sized apples. Remove cover, sprinkle apples 
generously with sugar and place on the top grate of the 
oven to glaze. Baste with the syrup several times and 
watch closely to prevent burning. When cooked lift each 
apple carefully to a serving dish and pour syrup around 
them. Chill before serving. 

If 1 or 2 apples are peeled, cored, sliced and placed 
around the apples while they are baking and then the 
syrup is strained through a fine sieve over the apples, a 
rich jelly should form which is even better than the apples. 
If desired, season with nutmeg, cloves and cinnamon. 

The apples can be served plain or with cream; filled in 



MRS. DE GRAF'S COOK BOOK [277] 

the manner suggested a meringue can be made of the 
white of one egg beaten very stiff, adding 2 tablespoons of 
sugar, beating again with a few drops of vanilla. Place a 
spoonful on each apple, return to a moderate oven and 
bake about 10 minutes to a golden brown. 

Glazed Apples 

Remove the skin and core and cook partially over the 
fire in a syrup made of 1 cup of sugar and 1 cup of water 
for 6 apples. When apples are tender remove to a baking 
dish, dredge with sugar, pour the syrup around them and 
bake until glazed and a delicate brown. 

Ginger Apples 

Core and peel apples, allowing one for each service. 
For 6 apples make a syrup of 1 cup of sugar and 1 cup of 
water. Cook apples in syrup until tender, but not broken. 
Turn the apples while cooking and do not cover the dish, 
as the steam will cause them to break in pieces. When 
cooked, place apples, drained of syrup, in a buttered bak- 
ing dish, sprinkle generously with sugar and set in a mod- 
erate oven to glaze. In the meantime add }4, cup of finely 
chopped preserved or crystallized ginger to the remaining 
syrup and cook about 5 minutes. When apples are glazed 
and slightly colored pour over the syrup. Serve hot or 
cold, with or without cream. 

Jellied Apples 

Pare and core as many apples as there are persons to 
serve. For six apples make a syrup of 1 cup of sugar and 
1 cup of water. Cook apples in the syrup very slowly, 
until they are tender, but not broken. While apples are 
cooking cut rounds of sponge cake a little larger than the 
apple. Any left-over plain cake may be used. Set a cooked 
apple on each slice of cake; add j^ glass of jelly to the 
syrup the apples were cooked in; cook until melted, then 
pour over the apples. Cool and serve. This dish is at- 
tractive garnished with whipped cream, or may be served 
with plain cream if desired. 



[278] MRS. DE GRAF'S COOK BOOK 

Apple Sauce 

Peel, quarter and core apples. Slice and drop in cold 
water to prevent discoloration. Drain, place in a sauce- 
pan, cover with hot water and cook until tender. Add 
sugar to taste when apples are cooked and beat until 
smooth. The secret of a clear apple sauce is cooking with- 
out sugar. 

Glazed Apples With Raisins 

Core and peel apples. For 6 apples allow 1 cup of sugar, 
1 cup of water. Cook sugar and water about 5 minutes, 
then add apples and cook, turning often until apples are 
tender but not broken. Remove apples to a baking dish. 
Fill the centers with seeded raisins, adding 1 teaspoon of 
chopped walnuts to each apple. Dredge apples gener- 
ously with sugar and cook in a moderate oven until well 
glazed. Reduce the syrup the apples were cooked in and 
pour that around them. To be served from the baking 
dish hot or cold, with or without cream. If served cold a 
teaspoonful of jelly can be placed on top of each apple. 

Coddled Apples 

Wash and core apples. For 6 apples use 1 cup of sugar 
and 13^ cups of water and a quarter section of orange peel. 

Cook water and sugar until sugar is dissolved, then add 
orange peel and apples. Cook slowly until apples are ten- 
der, but not broken. Turn frequently so apples will cook 
evenly. When cooked remove apples to a serving dish 
and boil down the syrup until thick, then pour over apples. 
Chill and serve with plain or whipped cream.

Gelatine desserts 

With different flavors, fruits, colors and combina- 
tions, a great variety of attractive desserts can be 
made with gelatine. They are not difficult to prepare, 
although some of them appear quite complicated. 
There are a few principles to keep in mind when un- 
dertaking these dishes, and when these are learned, 
even the most elaborate gelatine dessert will become a 
simple undertaking. Fruit-flavored jellies are the most 
popular, and usually form the foundation for the various 
combinations. Before preparing the dessert, soak the 
gelatine in cold water 3^ hour or more to soften it; then 
dissolve in hot water or the hot mixture. Do not boil the 
liquid after the gelatine has been added, or the jelly will 
be tough. Two tablespoons of granulated gelatine will 
stiff^en 1 quart of liquid, if kept in a cool place. When 
fruit is added to the jelly, use less liquid or more gelatine. 
After the gelatine and sugar are dissolved, strain the mix- 
ture through a fine sieve or cheese cloth bag, and then 
turn into a wet mold to set 

In moderate weather the jelly will be firm, in from 4 to 
6 hours. The larger the proportion of gelatine to the 
liquid the sooner the liquid will become firm; but too 
much gelatine will give an unpleasant flavor and make 
the jelly tough. It is always wise to use the quantity of 
gelatine recommended by the manufacturer of the prod- 
uct. Directions for using are usually printed on the 
package. 

To mold fancy jellies, place the form in a bowl contain- 
ing cracked ice; have jelly cold, but not set. Pour in a 
layer of jelly, let set until firm, add fruit, nuts, etc., add 
another layer of jelly, allow that to become firm and con- 
tinue until all have been used; then set aside until read)'^ 
to serve. To unmold, dip the form quickly into warm 
water (not hot), wipe perfectly dry, place a dish over 
the top of the mold and turn them over together. If the 
water is too warm the jelly will start to melt and destroy 
the appearance of the dessert. 

From a plain fruit jelly several very simple desserts 



MRS. DE GRAF'S COOK BOOK [283] 

may be prepared. A Russian jelly is made by simply 
beating the cold unset liquid of any of the fruit jelly 
foundations to a stiff froth with an egg-beater. When 
almost congealed, pour into wet molds and set aside to 
become thoroughly chilled. This form of jelly will be 
light and frothy throughout. Fruits or nuts may be 
added to the jelly after it has almost congealed, then 
mold and chill. Snow pudding is made by making the 
Russian jelly, adding for each quart of jelly the whites 
of 2 eggs. Pile in a serving dish and serve with cream or 
a custard sauce. 

Any of the plain fruit jellies or coffee jelly may be 
changed by using one of the methods just given.

Whipped Cream Desserts 

During the summer months cold desserts make a 
strong appeal to the busy housewife. Cream in com- 
bination with berries and other fresh fruits offer a wonder- 
ful variety. 

Desserts made of whipped cream and fruit are whole- 
some and very easily prepared. Cream is no more ex- 
pensive than other dessert materials and when one con- 
siders how quickly these dishes can be made, most of 
them requiring no cooking, and can be as plain or elaborate 
as one feels inclined, cream will not seem to be an extrava- 
gance. 

Whipped cream desserts should be light and frothy and 
with sufficient body to hold in shape for at least several 
hours. In order to whip easily cream should be 36 hours 
old and perfectly cold. Gelatine will keep whipped 
cream firm, and a small quantity is usually added for 
this purpose, although if the cream is properly whipped 
and chilled this should not be necessary. 

The average housekeeper does not always realize the 
possibilities of a small quantity of whipped cream, other- 
wise she would use it frequently. 

A plain and simple dessert may be transformed and 
made quite festive with a garnish or sauce of whipped 
cream, besides being more palatable and wholesome. The 
various Charlottes and the Bavarian creams, where 
whipped cream forms the foundation, are usually enjoyed, 
and these desserts do not tax the digestion after a hearty 
meal, as will pastry or baked or steamed pudding. 

To whip cream successfully it must be thoroughly cold 
and may be easily beaten with a rotary egg-beater. 
Heavy or double cream is very quickly whipped and care 
should be taken not to beat it a moment too long, or the 
cream will turn to butter. Also bear in mind that if the 
cream has not been sufficiently chilled it may turn quickly 
to butter, which explains the oily, heavy whipped cream 
frequently seen. Thin cream may be whipped in the 
same manner, only it will take more beating and the bowl 
containing the cream should be set in a pan of very cold 



[288] MRS. DE GRAF'S COOK BOOK 

water; or, better still, cracked ice. Cream will double in 
bulk when properly whipped, and this should be taken 
into consideration when buying; also provide a bowl 
large enough to allow for this increase, otherwise the 
cream cannot be easily beaten. 

Results will be more satisfactory when sugar and flav- 
orings are added after cream has been whipped, these in- 
gredients being carefully folded into the cream with a 
spoon. 

An almost endless variety of desserts may be easily 
and quickly made using whipped cream as the founda- 
tion, or as a garnish or sauce. Charlotte russe and Bavar- 
ian creams are not difficult to make and are elaborate 
enough to use for any occasion. Mousses and parfaits 
require freezing, but as they are not turned during the 
process of freezing and do not require an ice cream freezer, 
they are not troublesome desserts to prepare. 

Fruit Bavarians 

Put sufficient canned or fresh fruit through a colander 
to make 2 cupfuls. Soak 2 tablespoons of granulated 
gelatine in '%. cup of cold water for 15 minutes, then set 
dish over hot water to slowly dissolve the gelatine. Add 
powdered sugar to fruit to taste, the amount will vary 
with diff"erent fruit; add dissolved gelatine to fruit and 
stir until well mixed and sugar is dissolved; then set bowl 
containing mixture in a pan of cold water and stir until 
it begins to thicken. Whip one cup of cream, carefully 
fold it into the fruit mixture, and turn into a mold which 
has been dipped into cold water. Set aside in a cool place 
to become firm. To serve turn out of mold and garnish 
with a sauce made of sweetened mashed fruit. 

Charlotte Russe 

A charlotte diff"ers from a Bavarian cream in that it is 
made entirely of whipped cream with no fruit or liquid. 
Cover 1 tablespoon of granulated gelatine with yi cup of 
cold milk and soak about 15 minutes; whip 2 cups of 
cream, add 3^ cup of powdered sugar and a teaspoon of 
vanilla; set the gelatine over hot water to dissolve, then 
add quickly to the whipped cream, stirring rapidly in 



MRS. DE GRAF'S COOK BOOK [289] 

order to have dissolved gelatine well mixed before it cools. 
This is most important, otherwise the gelatine will be in 
thick lumps and the mixture will not thicken. Stir the 
cream in a pan of cracked ice, or in a cool place until it 
begins to thicken. Place a row of split lady fingers around 
the side of the mold, leaving the bottom of the mold un- 
covered; then pour in enough of the cream mixture to 
cover the lady fingers; add another row of lady fingers and 
then the cream, repeating until the mold is filled. By this 
method the lady fingers may easily be kept in place. Set 
aside to thoroughly chill. When ready to serve turn onto 
a serving plate. If you are the possessor of a pastry bag 
the charlotte may be made very attractive by garnishing 
with whipped cream forced through the bag, using a star 
tube. Mocha Charlotte Russe is made by adding 1 table- 
spoon of coffee extract to the whipped cream and using 
coffee instead of milk to dissolve the gelatine. 

Chocolate charlotte russe is made in the same way, 
using 2 squares of unsweetened chocolate, melted over 
hot water, or 3^ cup ground chocolate added to the 
whipped cream. Fruit charlottes are made by molding 
the plain charlotte in a border mold. When ready to serve 
turn out and fill the center with fruit. 

Marshmallow Strawberry Pudding 

1 cup hulled strawberries cut 1 cup cream whipped. 

in halves. M cup sugar. 

3^ cup marshmallows cut fine. 1 teaspoon vanilla extract. 

Cream should be beaten very stiff, adding vanilla and 
sugar. Fold in strawberries and marshmallows. Fill 
sherbet cups or tall glasses with mixture, garnish with 
whole berries and serve very cold. 



Cream Whips 

Whip cream, sweeten and flavor with vanilla; put a 
generous tablespoon of any preserve, or crushed sweetened 
fresh fruit in sherbet cups or tall glasses; pile the whipped 
cream lightly on top and sprinkle with chopped nuts. 



[290] MRS. DE GRAF'S COOK BOOK 

Molded Fruit Cream 

Peel 4 bananas, mash and rub through a sieve; add the 
juice of 1 orange and a Httle of the grated rind, 1 table- 
spoon lemon juice and enough powdered sugar to sweeten. 

Soak 1 tablespoon of granulated gelatine in ^4. cup of 
cold water about 15 minutes; then dissolve over hot 
water. Add to the fruit mixture, stirring rapidly. Set 
bowl containing mixture in a pan of cold water or cracked 
ice and stir until mixture begins to thicken. Whip 1 cup 
of cream and fold into the mixture; pour into individual 
molds and set aside to become firm. 



Rice Dainty 

V/i. cups cooked rice. 3^ cup powdered sugar. 

1 cup grated pineapple. 1 cup whipping cream. 

Carefully drain all juice from grated pineapple; add 
rice and sugar. Whip cream and fold into mixture. Serve 
very cold in sherbet or cocktail glasses. Garnish with 
maraschino cherries. 



Surprise Charlotte Russe 

Line individual or large dish with lady fingers or thin 
slices of sponge cake. Whip 1 cup of whipping cream; 
add 2 tablespoons (level) of powdered sugar and 1 tea- 
spoonful of vanilla. Line sides and bottom of cake-lined 
dish with whipped cream, place cooked or fresh sweetened 
fruit in the center, then cover with whipped cream. 
Sufficient for 3 persons. 

Raisin Charlotte Russe 

Soak seedless raisins in orange juice for several hours, 
then drain olF all juice. Allow 1 cup of raisins to 1 pint of 
cream. Whip cream and flavor with 1 teaspoon vanilla 
extract; add 4 tablespoons powdered sugar and the rais- 
ins. Line sherbet glasses with split lady fingers or thin 
slices of sponge cake and put the charlotte russe in the 
center. Garnish the top with raisins. 



MRS. DE GRAF'S COOK BOOK [291] 

Strawberry Whip 

1 cup hulled strawberries. 1 egg white, unbeaten. 

1 cup granulated sugar. Yi cup whipping cream. 

Put berries, sugar and white of egg in a bowl and beat 
with a whip egg beater until the consistency of whipped 
cream. This will take about 15 minutes. Fold in the 
whipped cream last. Chill and serve in sherbet glasses 
with sponge cake. Other fruits may replace strawberries. 

Marshmallow Cream 

Whip 1 cupful of cream, adding 2 tablespoons of sugar; 
fold into this ]/^ cup of chopped nuts, any kind but pea 
nuts; 1 cup of canned pineapple cut in cubes and drained 
from the juice, 1 cup of marshmallows cut fine; mix well 
until all is a creamy mass; other fruits may be substituted 
for the pineapple. Serve in sherbet cups.

Frozen Desserts 

At any season of the year frozen desserts are accept- 
able. Most housewives depend upon the confectioner 
to supply their ices and ice creams, although it is quite 
a simple matter to prepare them at home. The trouble 
of making them is no greater than that of making any 
dessert equally as attractive and palatable; and the 
question of expense is small as compared with the 
prices charged by the best caterers, and no more than 
any dish requiring the same amount of eggs, milk or 
cream. 

For example, a plain ice cream is a frozen custard or 
just plain table cream sweetened, flavored and frozen. 
With a good ice cream freezer, either ice cream or water 
ice may be made quickly, and has the advantage over 
hot desserts in that they require no attention at dinner 
time. Parfaits and mousses require no stirring while 
freezing, and this class of frozen cream is one of the best 
of the frozen desserts. 

Ice creams and water ices may be classified as follows: 
Philadelphia ice cream is a thin cream, sweetened, flav- 
ored and frozen; French ice creams are custards of different 
degrees of richness frozen; Parfaits and Mousses are 
whipped cream, with or without eggs, and frozen without 
stirring; Water Ices are frozen fruits juices, sweetened with 
a sugar syrup, with a little gelatine added to give body to 
the ice and to keep it from melting when served. Sherbet 
is a water ice with beaten white of egg added to the mix- 
ture; frozen punches are water ices with liquor mixed 
with them before or after they are frozen. 

Unless the cream is to be whipped it should be scalded, 
otherwise the frozen cream will have a raw taste. The 
scalding should be done in a double boiler and simply 
allow the cream to heat through; if it is boiled or cooked 
too long the cream will not increase in quantity when 
frozen. 

All frozen mixtures increase in bulk during freezing, so 
never fill the can over two-thirds full. It is an economy 
of time and ice to chill the mixture before freezing. The 



MRS. DE GRAF'S COOK BOOK [293] 

texture of ices is much better when not frozen too quickly. 
One measure of rock salt to three measures of finely- 
crushed ice are the proportions to use for mixtures to be 
stirred while freezing. The ice should be pounded in a 
coarse sack and should be almost as fine as the salt for 
the freezing process; but for packing, the water should all 
be drained off and the ice broken in small lumps which 
will not melt quickly, and very little salt is required. Too 
much salt will cause the mixture to thicken too quickly 
and the cream will be coarse and granular. Do not draw 
off the salt water until cream is frozen. 

Creams and ices ripen or become blended by standing, 
so they should be made some time before serving. Water 
ices are the simplest form of frozen desserts. They are 
inexpensive, and are easily made. The sugar and water 
should always be boiled to a thick syrup, otherwise the 
ice will have a raw taste and a coarse texture. 

Mousses are made of whipped cream, flavored and 
sweetened, then poured into a closely covered mold and 
packed in finely cracked ice and coarse rock salt, and 
left to ripen 3 hours or more. Fruit drained of all juice 
may be added to the cream before freezing. 

These make very attractive desserts and can be pre- 
pared early in the day and packed in ice and allowed to 
stand. The pail or utensil containing the mold should 
be drained of water several times and the melted ice 
replaced with fresh cracked ice. 

The accompanying recipes are all the housewife will 
require for water ice or ice cream. The amounts may be 
increased and different ingredients used, but the founda- 
tion principles will remain the same. 

Frozen Custard or French Ice Cream 

2 cups scalded milk. 2 eggs. 

% cup sugar. J^ teaspoon salt. 

1 teaspoon com starch. 2 teaspoons vanilla. 

Mix sugar, salt and corn starch; add to beaten eggs. 
Pour hot milk over mixture. Put in a double boiler and 
stir constantly until mixture becomes thick enough to 
coat a spoon. Cool, flavor and freeze. 1 cup of thin 
cream may be added to the chilled custard before freezing. 



[294] MRS. DE GRAF'S COOK BOOK 

The yolks of eggs only may be used in the custard, and 
when cool the stiffly beaten whites may be added. To 
this foundation different flavorings or chopped nuts may 
be used. 

Fruit Ice Cream 

Crush 2 cups of berries and press through a puree 
strainer or sieve. Prepare the custard and when cool add 
the fruit, additional sugar if needed, and the cream 
whipped or plain, and freeze. 

Philadelphia Ice Cream 

4 cups or 1 quart of thin cream. 1 tablespoon vanilla. 
1 cup sugar. 

The cream should not be too thick or it may form fine 
particles of butter while being stirred. Scald the cream 
and add the sugar. When cool add flavoring and freeze. 
Pack and let ripen for an hour or more. 

Bisque Ice Cream 

Add \y2 cups of macaroon crumbs, rolled very fine, to 
the Philadelphia ice cream just before freezing. Pack and 
allow to ripen. 

Chocolate Ice Cream 

Add 3^ cup of ground chocolate to the sugar of either 
custard or Philadelphia ice cream. 

Frozen Pudding 

Shred 1^ cups mixed candied fruit and soak in orange 
juice for an hour. Freeze Philadelphia ice cream until it 
begins to thicken, add fruit, then finish freezing. Pack 
and allow to ripen an hour or more. 

Fruit Mousses 

Whip 1 pint or 2 cups of cream; add 1 cup of any fruit 
pulp free from juice, and add powdered sugar to taste. 
Pour into a mold, cover with clean paper, adjust cover 
and pack in equal parts of crushed ice and salt. Let stand 
3 hours to ripen. Unmold to serve. 



MRS. DE GRAF'S COOK BOOK [295] 

Water Ice 

1 quart or 4 cups of water. 4 tablespoons cold water. 

2 cups sugar. 2 cups fruit juice. 
1 teaspoon gelatine. Juice of lemon. 

Boil water and sugar about 15 minutes. Soak gelatine 
in cold water until soft, add to the hot syrup and cool; 
then add fruit and lemon juice and freeze. To obtain the 
fruit juice or crushed fruit mash the fruit and squeeze 
through a cheese cloth, or press through a puree strainer. 
Any fruit or fruit juice may be used. Pack and allow to 
ripen 2 hours or more. 

Sherbet 

Add 2 stiffly beaten egg whites to the water ice formula 
when partly frozen. When frozen pack and allow to ripen 
at least 2 hours. Crushed fruit makes the best sherbet. 



Maple Mousse 

1 cup maple syrup. 2 cups cream, whipped. 

4 egg yolks. 

Beat yolks until light and lemon colored; heat the syrup 
and pour over the beaten yolks. Return mixture to sauce- 
pan and cook, stirring constantly until thick. Cool the 
mixture and beat until creamy. When cold carefully fold 
in the whipped cream. Fill mold, cover, pack in equal 
parts of salt and ice and let stand at least 2 hours, while 
longer would be better. 

Biscuit Tortoni 

1 cup sugar. 1 tablespoon orange extract. 

yi cup boiling water. 2 cups double cream, whipped. 

3 egg yolks. 1 cup macaroon crumbs. 

Boil sugar and water until soft-ball stage is reached. 
Pour slowly over the beaten yolks. Return to fire and 
cook over hot water until mixture is somewhat thick- 
ened; beat until cold, flavor and fold in the whipped 
cream. Add crumbs and pack in a mold. Pack mold in 
3 parts ice to 1 of salt and let stand 2 or 3 hours to freeze. 



[296] MRS. DE GRAF'S COOK BOOK 

Pineapple Parfait 

1 cup pineapple juice. 1 cup grated pineapple. 

% cup sugar. 1 teaspoon pistachio flavoring. 

2 egg whites. 1 cup cream, whipped. 

Boil the sugar and pineapple juice about 10 minutes 
Pour slov/ly over the well-beaten egg whites, using an 
egg-beater. Beat until cold, add the fruit, flavoring, and 
fold in the whipped cream. Turn into a mold, cover with 
paper and adjust cover. Pack in equal measures of salt 
and crushed ice and let stand at least 3 hours. This cream 
needs no stirring. The grated pineapple is used and the 
juice obtained by draining the fruit. The flavoring may 
be omitted. 

Frozen Meringues 

Fill meringue shells with sweetened, flavored whipped 
cream. Place in the freezer or any utensil with a tight 
cover. Pack in equal parts finely crushed ice and salt. 
Let stand about 2 hours.

JELLIES JAMS 

CANNING OF VEGETABLES AND FRUIT BY THE 

COLD PACK METHOD 

PICKLES AND RELISHES 



298] MRS. DE GRAF'S COOK BOOK 



Jellies and Jams 




In securing fruits for making jelly, always procure 
those which are somewhat under-ripe. The jelly- 
making quality in fruit is known as pectin and is 
'present when the fruit is either ripe or just turning 
ripe. If the fruit is over-ripe the pectin disappears, and it 
will be impossible to make satisfactory jelly. This pectin 
is somewhat like gelatine, as it dissolves in boiling liquid 
and stiffens upon cooling. The fruits best suited for jelly 
making are currants, plums, quinces, crabapples, grapes 
and apples. These fruits will make a perfect jelly if not 
used over-ripe. Fruits in which pectin is lacking must be 
combined with those rich in this jelly-making quality. 
The novice in housekeeping usually shrinks from jelly 
making, but if rules are carefully studied and only a small 
quantity attempted at one time the process will be found 
very simple and the results satisfactory. 

The addition of sugar to cooked fruit increases the nu- 
tritive value, and the cooking of the sugar at a high tem- 
perature, combined with the acid of the fruit, causes the 
inversion of the sugar, which is the first step in its diges- 
tion. For this reason jellies, jams and marmalades are 
considered one of the most wholesome forms in which to 
eat sugar. Children crave sweets and. this desire may be 
gratified in wholesome jellies, jams and marmalades. Un- 
less combined with sugar, the actual food value of fruit 
is low; but the acids and salts it contains are most im- 
portant. They are needed to keep the blood pure. There 
is nothing more wholesome for children and no food the 
average child enjoys more than bread and jelly or mar- 
malade. 

A good jelly should be bright in color, and clear. When 
removed from the glass it should retain the shape of the 
mold and be tender enough to quiver without breaking. 

When making currant jelly use from 2 to 4 quarts of 
fruit for 1 utensil. A great quantity takes too long to 
bring to the right heat and both the color and flavor of 
the jelly will be impaired. Wash fruit well, remove stems 
and discard all that is imperfect. With watery fruits, 



MRS. DE GRAF'S COOK BOOK [299] 

such as grapes and currants, use no water. Cut hard 
fruits into small pieces and use about 3 cups of water to 
each pound of fruit. Cook the fruit slowly until the juice 
begins to flow, then crush with a wooden potato masher. 

As soon as the fruit is tender remove from the fire and 
pour into a jelly bag to drain. A pointed three-cornered 
bag is best, as it lets the juice drain from the corner with 
the pressure of the bulk of the fruit on the small end. 
Hang the bag so the juice may drip. When nearly all the 
juice has been strained through the bag may be squeezed. 
This last juice which has been squeezed through the jelly 
bag should be kept by itself as the jelly made from this 
juice will not be as clear as that which has been allowed 
to drip. If the fruit is overcooked it will produce a cloudy 
jelly. 

Measure the juice, and for each cup allow ^ cup of 
sugar. The sugar should be placed on shallow pans and 
warmed slightly in the oven. Reheat the fruit juice, and 
when it reaches the boiling point add the sugar imme- 
diately. Cook rapidly about 5 minutes, removing scum as 
it appears. Long cooking will darken the jelly and tends 
to destroy the pectin, which will cause the finished prod- 
uct to be less firm. 

To determine when the jelly has cooked sufficiently, 
drop a teaspoon of the syrup on a cold plate. If the jelly 
stage is reached the syrup will thicken slightly in a few 
seconds. Remove from the fire at once and pour into hot 
sterilized jelly glasses and set aside to cool. Cool as 
rapidly as possible to avoid dust, which will cause mould. 
When cold pour melted paraffine over the top, cover, 
store in a cool, dark, dry place. 

Jelly deteriorates in color, texture and flavor if stored 
for a long period. When jelly is soft and syrupy, too much 
sugar has been used, or the syrup has not been cooked 
long enough after sugar was added. If tough or stringy, 
too little sugar has been used or the syrup was boiled 
after the jelly stage had been reached. 

The cleaner the fruit— that is, of stems or leaves, the 
brighter and clearer the jelly will be. Prepare glasses be- 
fore making the jelly. After washing well, place glasses 
in a pan of cold water, set over the fire and when boiling 



[300] MRS. DE GRAF'S COOK BOOK 

point is reached allow to boil 15 minutes. Just before 
filling glasses with the boiling syrup set them upright in 
a pan of hot water, placing a thick pad of cloth in the 
bottom of the pan. This method of handling glasses will 
prevent breakage. 

Strawberries need a heavier syrup for canning than 
other fruits, and while it is a little more expensive to 
make jam or preserves the process is simpler and for this 
particular fruit much more satisfactory. The berry sea- 
son is long in California but the berries are at their best 
in June and should be used for canning or preserving then. 
The old-fashioned method of making preserves and jams 
called for equal weights or measurements of sugar and 
fruit. But science has discovered that an equally satis- 
factory preserve can be made with only three-fourths as 
much sugar as fruit. The fruit is kept whole for preserves 
and is broken or mashed for jams. 

Either method may be used. Select only sound, ripe 
fruit for preserving; use fine granulated sugar; measure 
the ingredients accurately; sterilize containers and covers, 
and, most important of all, preserve a small quantity at a 
time. Pick over fruit carefully, wash and measure. Any 
imperfect fruit (bruised, but not in any way spoiled) may 
be crushed and strained through a jelly bag and used for 
making the syrup. Allow one-half as much water, or 
juice and water, as you have berries. Use three-fourths 
cup of sugar for each cup of berries. 

Boil the sugar and liquid 5 minutes after boiling begins. 
Skim, then add berries, a small quantity at a time and 
cook gently under the boiling point until fruit can be 
pierced with a fork. The berries will be somewhat trans- 
parent. Lift out with a skimmer or perforated spoon and 
put into the sterilized jars or glasses; add more fruit and 
repeat until all have been cooked. If much juice has 
drained from the fruit in the jars pour this back in the 
kettle and boil all the juice down about 5 minutes, then 
pour over the berries and set aside to cool. Do not cover 
or seal until cold. If fruit is sealed while hot the juice 
will be less thick. 

Less perfect fruit may be used for jam than for pre- 
serves. Of course, care should be taken to exclude all 



MRS. DE GRAF'S COOK BOOK [301] 

decayed portions, but the over-ripe and somewhat bruised 
berries need not be discarded when preparing jam. The 
fruit should be carefully picked over and well washed. 

Combinations of fruits make palatable jams or con- 
serves and sometimes chopped nuts are added. 

The labor given to the preparation of jams or preserves 
is amply repaid in the appreciaton of the family. Jam is 
certainly a treat for breakfast with hot biscuits or rolls; 
for dinner as a relish with meat or for supper with hot 
buttered toast, not to mention the "between-meal" bread 
and jam for the children after school. The rules govern- 
ing the making of strawberry preserves and jam may be 
applied to all other fruits. 

Currant or Loganberry Jelly 

Pick over currants, stem and wash, discarding all the 
imperfect fruit. Place in a preserving kettle, crushing 
slightly. Cook slowly until currants are tender. Pour 
into the jelly bag and strain. Measure juice and reheat. 
When boiling point is reached add heated sugar, three- 
fourths cup to each cup of juice and cook rapidly about 5 
minutes, when the syrup may be tested by dropping a 
spoonful on a cold plate. If the jelly stage is reached, re- 
move from the fire at once and pour into hot jelly glasses. 
Cool, pour melted paraffine over the top, cover and store 
in a cool, dry place. 

Grape Jelly 

Select under-ripe fruit, remove the grapes from the 
stems, wash and put in a preserving kettle over a slow fire 
and allow to simmer until the fruit is tender; then pour 
into a bag and drain oflF all the juice. For each cup of juice 
allow ^ cups of sugar. Heat sugar in the oven. Bring 
grape juice to the boiling point, then add heated sugar and 
let boil until a little of the syrup will jelly when dropped on 
a cold plate. Pour into hot glasses and cool; pour melted 
paraffine over the top, cover and store in a cool, dry place. 

Currant and Raspberry Jelly 

Use two-thirds currants to one-third raspberries and 
proceed as for currant jelly. 



[302] MRS. DE GRAF'S COOK BOOK 

Apple Jelly 

Wipe apples, remove stems and blossoms and cut in 
quarters. Put in a preserving kettle, cover the fruit with 
cold water and cook slowly until the fruit is soft. Pour 
into a jelly bag and drain. Measure juice and allow to 
boil about 20 minutes; then add the heated sugar, allow- 
ing three-fourths cup to each cup of juice; then boil about 
5 minutes. Skim before and after adding sugar. Test and 
pour into hot jelly glasses. Apples may be combined with 
fruits which lack pectin making a satisfactory jelly. 

Apple Mint Jelly 

Follow apple jelly formula, adding a few leaves of mint 
to the apples while cooking. 

Cranberry Jelly 

One quart of cranberries, 2 cups of hot water. Put in 
a kettle, cover and cook 10 minutes. Remove cover, add 
2 cups sugar and cook 10 minutes longer. Each berry 
should be whole when cold and embedded in jelly. 

Crabapple Jelly 

Wash and stem the fruit, and, if rather large, cut in 
halves. Cover with boiling water and cook until tender. 
Pour into jelly bag and drain. Measure juice and sugar, 
allowing three-fourths cup of sugar to each cup of juice. 
Bring juice to the boiling point, add sugar; boil until 
syrup jellies. Pour into hot glasses; cool, and then pour 
melted paraffine over the top. Cover and store. 

Plum Jelly 

Select under-ripe plums; wash and cover with boiling 
water and cook until tender; pour into jelly bag and 
drain. Use equal measure of sugar and juice, finishing as 
for other jellies. 

Rhubarb Jam 

Cut off ends and remove strings of skin, but do not 
completely peel the fruit. Cut in inch slices, measure and 
cover with an equal quantity of sugar. Let stand several 



MRS. DE GRAF'S COOK BOOK [303] 

hours; then cook about 30 minutes after the boiling point 
is reached; then allow to simmer gently for 30 minutes 
more. For each 5 pounds of fruit add the grated rind and 
juice of a lemon and % pound of blanched sliced almonds. 

Sunshine Strawberries 

Put into the preserving kettle, in layers, as many 
pounds of sugar as hulled, washed and drained straw- 
berries. When the juice is drawn out a little set over the 
fire to cook 20 minutes after boiling point is reached. Turn 
the berries into agate pans or earthenware plates, cover 
with panes of glass and set in the sun. Let stand 2 days, 
stirring 2 or 3 times each day. Store without reheating in 
jars or glasses. The time of cooking may be cut down to 
10 minutes if the fruit is to be left in the sun a day or two 
longer. 

Strawberry Jam 

Wash and hull berries; allow y^ pound of sugar for each 
pound of hulled berries. Place berries in a kettle and 
mash. Place over a slow fire and cook slowly, stirring and 
mashing fruit until it is thoroughly cooked. Then add 
sugar and cook very slowly until mixture is thick. Watch 
carefully and stir frequently to avoid burning. An 
asbestos mat under the kettle will lessen the chance of 
burning. It is never advisable to make a quantity of jam 
at any one time. Even if you have a quantity of berries 
needing immediate attention it will be found much easier 
to make the jam in small amounts. Several small kettles 
of fruit can be cooked at once more quickly and with 
much better results than cooked in one large utensil. 

Strawberry Conserve 

Use equal quantities each of pineapple, strawberries 
and rhubarb. The pineapple is peeled, then sliced, then 
cut in small cubes; rhubarb is cut in small pieces without 
peeling. Place pineapple and rhubarb over a very slow 
fire without any water being added and cook slowly until 
the fruit is tender. Add strawberries, cook slowly, stirring 
and mashing frequently. When berries are cooked add 
the sugar, using three-fourths as much sugar as fruit. 



[304] MRS. DE GRAF'S COOK BOOK 

Cook until thick. If desired a half cup of blanched shred- 
ded almonds may be added for each quart of conserve. 
Pour into sterilized glasses or jars and cool before sealing. 

Plum Butter 

Use plum pulp left after draining juice for jelly. Put 
through a coarse strainer. Use one-half as much sugar as 
plum pulp and simmer until sugar is dissolved. 

Fig Jam 

Blanch figs and remove peel. Cut in half. Add three- 
quarter measure of sugar for each measure of fruit. Sim- 
mer gently until thick. A little lemon juice can be added 
for flavor. 

Gooseberry Jam 

Stem and wash gooseberries. Mash and cook very 
slowly until fruit is tender. Add equal parts sugar and 
fruit and simmer until thick. This fruit contains so much 
acid that the additional sugar is required. 

Peach Marmalade 

Dip fruit in hot water for 2 or 3 minutes; dip in cold 
water, remove at once and take off peel and remove pit. 
Chop or slice very fine. Add three-quarters as much 
sugar as fruit and cook very slowly until thick. Seal in 
sterilized jars. 

Bar le Due Currants 

Use only large, firm fruit. Weigh and use an equal 
weight of strained honey. Heat honey, add fruit, let 
simmer very slowly about 5 minutes, remove the fruit 
with a skimmer, then cook down the syrup until thick. 
Pour it over the fruit and store in glasses as you would 
jelly. 

Apple Marmalade 

Wash apples, quarter, but retain skin and cores. Add 
a very little boiling water, just enough to prevent burn- 
ing. Cover and cook, stirring frequently, until soft. 
Press through a colander or a puree strainer. For every 



MRS. DE GRAF'S COOK BOOK [305] 

cup of pulp add three-quarters cup of sugar and the juice 
and grated rind of 1 lemon. Let cook over a slow fire 
until somewhat thickened. Remember that marmalade 
thickens considerably upon cooking. 

Raisin and Apple Conserve 

4 cups chopped apples. IH cups seeded raisins. 

1 lemon sliced very thin. % cup chopped walnuts. 

3 cups sugar. 

Mix apples, raisins and lemon and heat to the boiling 
point. Add sugar and cook until thick — about yi hour. 
Remove from the fire, add chopped nuts, pour into hot 
sterilized glasses and seal as for jelly. 

Golden Marmalade 

(Slightly Bitter) 

1 grapefruit. 10 cups cold water. 

2 oranges. 10 cups sugar. 
1 lemon. 

Wash and dry fruit; cut into quarters without peeling 
then cut quarters in very thin slices. This will take a 
sharp knife. Discard all seeds. Cover fruit with water 
and let stand over night. In the morning bring slowly to 
the simmering point and cook until fruit is tender, at 
least 4 hours, longer if necessary. Let stand over night 
again then reheat, add sugar and cook, stirring frequently 
until when a spoonful is tested on a cold dish it forms a 
jelly. Pour in sterilized glasses, cool and cover as for 
jelly. 

Orange Marmalade 

Wash and dry fruit. Cut into quarters without peeling, 
then cut each quarter into the thinnest of slices. Allow 1 
lemon to 6 oranges. Discard all seeds for they will make 
the marmalade bitter. For each cup of fruit allow 3 cups 
of cold water. Let stand over night then heat slowly to 
the simmering point and cook until the rind is tender, 
from 4 to 6 hours. If the rind is not tender the marmalade 
will not be satisfactory. Let stand over night a second 
time, reheat and when boiling add the sugar; allow equal 



[306] MRS. DE GRAF'S COOK BOOK 

measures of fruit and sugar. Cook rapidly until the mix- 
ture jellies when tested on a cold dish. If a sugar ther- 
mometer is used the mixture should be about 218 degrees F. 

Pineapple and Orange Marmalade 

1 pineapple. 1 lemon. 

6 oranges. 

Wash and dry oranges and lemon; cut into quarters 
without removing peel. Cut each quarter into very thin 
slices, discarding all seeds. Peel and remove "eyes" from 
the pineapple. Shred fruit from the core with a silver 
fork. Measure the fruit, allowing 3 cups of cold water 
for each cup of fruit. Let stand over night then bring 
slowly to the simmering point and cook until the orange 
rind is tender, 4 to 6 hours. Let stand over night again, 
then measure. Reheat and when boiling point is reached 
add the sugar, allowing an equal quantity. Let cook 
until the mixture thickens when tested on a cold dish.

Canning Vegetables by the Cold Pack 
Method 

The canning of vegetables is not a complicated process. 
There are certain essentials for successful canning, and 
if these are carefully observed there is small chance for 
failure. Perfect sterilization is the secret of success. All 
ingredients should be clean and fresh, and all the utensils 
used should be sterilized; that is free from all mold or 
germs which cause or promote decay. To secure immunity 
from germs it is necessary to thoroughly scald and boil all 
containers, covers, rubbers, funnels, dippers, spoons and 
kettles, in fact everything which is used during the pro- 
cess. 

The materials to be canned must be carefully picked 
over and thoroughly washed. An accumulation of dust, 
mold or decayed portions on the ingredients to be canned 
even if slight, will affect the result. These essentials are 
necessary, no matter what method of canning is used, 
whether by the old-fashioned open-kettle method or by 
the more modern cold-pack process. 

There are three kinds of plant life which cause foods 
to spoil, mold, yeasts and bacteria, and these organisms 
are floating everywhere in the air. To preserve food it 
must be put into a condition which is free from all organ- 
ism and be put where these germs can not reach it. Molds 
are the only visible plant life and thrive in dampness and 
darkness. They grow more frequently where acid is 
present, so are more often found on tomatoes or fruits. 
The invisible spores causing molds are in the air every- 
where and develop upon foods which are left exposed. 
Moist heat will kill molds, so the method of sterilizing 
food in jars or cans and sealing at once prevents trouble 
with mold. Yeast is abundant in the air and on the sur- 
face of fruit and vegetables. When canned food ferments, 
yeast is present. Moist heat at the simmering point will 
usually kill all yeasts. 

Bacteria are not so easily destroyed as molds and 
yeasts and can only be killed by subjecting them to a 



[308] MRS. DE GRAF'S COOK BOOK 

moist heat at the boiling point for different lengths of 
time. Experience has proved that when the vegetables 
are sterilized until thoroughly cooked they are usually 
ready to seal and all organisms killed. Very little loss has 
followed this rule where the vegetables were in good con- 
dition and not withered or old. Only young, tender, 
fresh vegetables can be successfully canned. 

For the cold pack method of canning the food is cooked 
in the jars until sterilized. This is called processing. 
When processing is complete the jars or containers must 
be sealed immediately to prevent the entrance of germs. 
Vegetables require a much longer period of sterilization 
than fruits. The cold-pack method requires five pro- 
cesses: Scalding or blanching, cold dipping, packing in 
jars, sterilizing and sealing. 

Scalding or blanching consists of plunging the fruit or 
vegetables into boiling water for a short time. The in- 
gredients should be placed in a wire basket or a square of 
cheese cloth. This process gives the food a more thorough 
cleansing; makes peeling, when necessary, an easy matter; 
improves the texture and produces a clearer liquid. Be- 
sides all this it shrinks either fruits or vegetables, making 
them more flexible and much easier to pack solid in the 
jars. The length of time for blanching depends upon the 
age of the food. 

Cold dipping is placing the vegetable for an instant 
only into cold water. This makes the food crisp and 
further aids in shrinkage; also preserves color and flavor. 

The food is then packed as closely as possible in the 
sterilized jars. Cover the vegetables (except tomatoes) 
to overflowing with boiling water and allow a teaspoon of 
salt to each quart jar of vegetables. 

Cleanse rubbers by standing for a minute in boiling 
water, allowing 1 teaspoon soda for each quart of water. 
Adjust rubber, then screw top partially on jar. If using 
a glass top jar with wire clamp place the cover on and 
raise both clamps. The upper one will hold the top in 
place. Place the jars on a rack in a boiler or deep kettle. 
Have water about the temperature of the jars and fill 
boiler to about 2 inches of the tops of the jars. Cover 
the boiler to keep in the steam and count the time for 



MRS. DE GRAF'S COOK BOOK [309] 

processing from the time the water begins to boil and 
keep constantly at the boiling point the required length 
of time. 

At the end of this time lift jars from the water, tighten 
the covers securely at once. Return to the hot water, this 
time completely submerging them for 10 minutes. Lift 
from the water, tighten covers again and cool, avoiding a 
draft which might cause the jars to crack. Inverting the 
jars will be a final test as to whether there is a possible 
leak. 

Store in a cool, dry, dark place. Tomatoes, peas, lima 
beans and corn are greatly improved by adding a teaspoon 
of sugar to each pint of vegetables, adding the sugar and 
salt at the same time. 

Rubber rings should be new each season. To open a 
jar of food easily, immerse the cover in warm water and 
gradually add boiling water, letting jars stand a few min- 
utes; then remove and cover can easily be removed. 

In the following recipes no definite period is given for 
sterilizing the vegetables. When cooked through, or 
suitable for serving, they are ready to seal, or the food 
may be tested to see if it is cooked. Be sure this jar is 
filled to overflowing with boiling water before resealing. 
The time for processing depends upon the age of the 
product, and time tables usually apply to fresh, tender 
products. 

The following table may be used as a guide: 

Vegetables Blanching Cooking 

Asparagus 5 to 10 min 2 hours 

Peas 8 minutes 3 hours 

String Beans 8 minutes 2 hours 

Lima Beans 5 to 10 min 3 hours 

Beets 5 to 10 min 2 hours 

Corn 5 to 10 min 4 hours 

Peppers 5 to 10 min 2 hours 

Tomatoes 1^ minutes 20 min. 

String Beans 

Remove the stems and strings from tender fresh beans; 
cut in two if desired. Blanch from 5 to 8 minutes, or until 



[310] MRS. DE GRAF'S COOK BOOK 

the pod will bend without breaking; then plunge in cold 
water for an instant. Drain, pack quickly into a jar, add 
salt and cover to overflowing with boiling water; adjust 
rubbers and covers. Place jars on racks in boiler, cover 
to within one inch of top with warhi water; cover boiler, 
and when water reaches the boiling point sterilize about 
\y2 hours, keeping water continuously boiling. This 
recipe also applies to wax beans and green lima beans. 
When cooked remove and adjust covers. 

Asparagus 

Asparagus for canning must be fresh. Wash, cut the 
proper length for jars, scrape off tough outer skin and tie 
in bundles. Blanch by immersing the lower ends in boil- 
ing water for 3 minutes; then lower all and blanch 1 to 2 
minutes longer. Plunge into cold water, then pack in 
jars. Add salt, fill to overflowing with boiling water; 
place on rack in boiler and cover to 1 inch of top with 
warm water. Cover boiler, and when water boils cook 
about \y2 hours, keeping water constantly boiling. Re- 
move from boiler and adjust covers. 

Peas 

Peas should be canned as soon as shelled. Blanch from 
1 to 4 minutes in boiling water. Dip in cold water for an 
instant, adding 1 teaspoon of salt to each quart of water. 
Drain and pack to }i inch of top of jar, add 1 teaspoon 
each of sugar and salt for each pint jar, cover with boiling 
water, and adjust rubbers and covers. Place on rack in 
boiler, cover with warm water to within 1 inch of top. 
Cover boiler, bring to boiling point and cook about Ij^ 
hours or until tender. Remove from boiler and adjust 
covers. 

Tomatoes 

Select firm tomatoes of uniform size. Blanch for 1 min- 
ute, dip into cold water and remove skins quickly and 
pack closely into jars. Add salt, and fill jars with hot 
strained tomatoes. Adjust rubbers and covers, place in 
boiler, cover with warm water to within 1 inch of the top 
of jars. Cover boiler and when boiling point is reached 



MRS. DE GRAF'S COOK BOOK [311] 

cook about 15 minutes. Remove from boiler and adjust 
covers. 

Lima Beans 

Lima beans should be canned as soon as shelled. Blanch 
from 1 to 4 minutes, depending on the age of the beans. 
Dip in cold water for an instant, adding a teaspoon of 
salt to each quart of cold water. Drain and pack beans 
to within ]/2 inch of the top of jar; add salt, cover to over- 
flowing with boiling water. Adjust rubbers and covers; 
place in boiler; cover to within an inch of top of jars with 
warm water; cover boiler and when boiling point is 
reached cook about an hour or until tender. One jar may 
be tested, then put back and sterilized before sealing. 
When cooked, remove and adjust covers. 



[312] MRS. DE GRAF'S COOK BOOK 

Canning Fruit 

Fruit for canning should be ripe and fresh for the best 
results. Over-ripe fruit is difficult to sterilize. 

By the cold pack method the fruit is placed in the jar 
and all cooking or sterilization is done in the jar. In this 
way all bacteria is destroyed and as the jar is not opened 
again until the fruit is required for use, no bacteria can 
enter, providing the jars and covers are perfect, and the 
jar completely sealed. If air can enter the jar the food 
will mold and spoil. 

All fruits except berries are blanched for the cold-pack 
method of canning. By blanching is meant immersing 
fruit in a pan of hot water for a certain period, the length 
of time depending upon the type of fruit. 

Blanching gives a thorough cleansing, loosens the skin, 
improves the tecture and shrinks the product. After 
blanching the fruit is immediately dipped in cold water. 
This hardens the pulp under the skin, making it easy to 
remove the skin, leaves the fruit firm and sets the color. 
It also enables handling of the fruit at once so that it 
may easily be packed into jars. Do not allow the fruit 
to remain in the cold water; dip it in and then remove at 
once. Peel and pack into jars immediately. It is necessary 
to handle the fruit rapidly at this stage. Many failures 
in canning can be traced to allowing the fruit to stand 
after blanching instead of packing in jars at once. It can 
easily be understood why it is both easier and better in 
every way to blanch only a small quantity of fruit at a 
time. It is necessary to exercise judgment as to the length 
of time required for blanching, as the condition of the 
fruit will govern that somewhat. 

The time tables which will follow this article can be 
followed exactly if the fruit is fresh and in perfect condi- 
tion. The time for blanching fruits is much easier to 
determine than that for vegetables. 

After packing the fruit in the jar, fill to one-fourth inch 
of the top with hot syrup, adjust the rubbers and place 
the covers in position. Do not seal completely. Leave 
the clamp up, if glass top jars are used; for screw-top jars 



MRS. DE GRAF'S COOK BOOK [313] 

do not screw down entirely. The tops of the jars should 
be tight enough to fit down so that no water can seep 
into the jar, but not be so tight that they can be forced 
off by the expanding process. 

The density of the syrup may be varied according to the 
variety of fruit used, but a general rule which may be 
used for all fruit canning is: Three parts sugar to two 
parts water; boil down to a thin syrup; very sour fruits 
may need a heavier syrup. Use any kettle in which a 
rack may be placed so that the jars will be at least ^2 
inch above the bottom, and deep enough for the water 
to come 1 inch above the tops of the jars. The water 
must come above the jars in order to prevent the liquid 
inside the jars boiling out in the form of steam. The 
water from the boiler will not get into the jars, as all 
force is outward, not inward. Jars not completely filled 
with fruit will keep perfectly because the remaining air 
in the jar will be completely sterilized by the processing 
or cooking. 

Do not count the length of time for cooking until the 
water is actually boiling. It is the boiling temperature 
that does the sterilizing. 

The quality of jar used plays an important part in 
successful results of canning. This does not mean the 
type of jar. Select any style you fancy, but be sure there 
are no flaws. The jars, and covers also, should be per- 
fectly smooth where the two come together; there should 
be no cracks, rough edges or chipped spots. 

Jar covers must fit so tight that there is no possible 
chance of a leak after the jar is sealed. Thorough steri- 
lization is a necessity both for jars and covers. Wash 
jars in warm soapy water; rinse well, then put into a pan 
of cold water and bring slowly to the boiling point, and 
boil not less than 5 minutes. Allow jars to stand in the 
boiling water until ready to fill. Covers my be dropped 
into boiling water a few minutes before required. Another 
very important point is to have new rubbers each time a 
jar is used. It is false economy to use old rubbers. 

In order to withstand the boiling during the period of 
cooking the fruit for the cold-pack method, rubbers must 
be firm and elastic. Sterilize rubbers by covering with 



[314] MRS. DE GRAF'S COOK BOOK 

boiling water, then dry in a clean cloth and use at once. 
The essential point is to kill all bacteria by heat, so every- 
thing that comes in contact with food to be canned must 
be sterilized by boiling. 

When the fruit has cooked the required time take jars 
from the boiler and seal tightly at once. Invert jars and 
let stand until cool. If there should be a flaw in a jar or 
cover it will be discovered if the jar is allowed to cool 
inverted. Set the jars in a cool place, but be careful not 
to let a draft of cold air strike them while cooling or they 
might crack. Also keep plenty of space between jars so 
that there will be a free circulation of air. Store fruit in a 
cool, dry, dark place. 

Use only perfect fruit for canning. The bruised, over- 
ripe fruit may be used for jam. Of course, this does not 
mean fruit that is in any way decayed. 

The cold-pack method described is by far the simplest 
and most satisfactory way to can food. The following 
tables, which are universally used, will be helpful to the 
home canner: 
Fruits Blanching Cooking 

Apricots 1 to 2 minutes 16 min. 

Peaches 2 minutes 16 min. 

Pears lyi minutes 20 min. 

Figs 3 minutes 16 min. 

All Berries No blanching 20 min. 

Grapes No blanching 16 min. 

Cherries No blanching 16 min. 

Apples \y2 minutes 20 min.

PICKLES AND RELISHES 

Pickles and relishes are not classed as strictly hygienic 
foods, but as the home-made products are undoubtedly 
pure, there really seems no reason why these foods should 
not be used in moderation. To make pickles quite harm- 
less as well as palatable, care must be taken to have the 
vinegar absolutely pure. Either malt or a white wine vine- 
gar may be used. Brine in which articles for pickles are to 
be stored should be strong enough to hold up an egg. A 
pint or 2 cups of salt to 1 gallon of water will usually be 
found the right proportion. 

Vegetables for pickling are only to remain over night 
in a brine; 1 cup of salt to 1 gallon of water is sufficient. 
Articles to be pickled lose some of their crispness if scalded, 
but they will absorb the vinegar more easily. 

Pickles stored in stoneware jars will keep for months if 
the vinegar and spices are of good quality; or they may be 
packed in fruit jars. Spices and horseradish are an aid in 
keeping pickles in good condition. And green or red pep- 
pers will give a better flavor than peppercorns. 

When removing pickles from the jar use a wooden, 
porcelain or agate spoon or ladle, as the vinegar attacks 
metal, causing dangerous compounds. 

A spiced vinegar is excellent for any kind of pickles. It 
may be prepared by boiling 1 quart of vinegar with 1 
ounce each of cloves, allspice, ginger, mace, bay leaves 
and chopped red pepper. Cool before using. 

Vinegar should always be just boiled up, either with or 
without the spices, then allowed to cool before using. 
Raw vinegar never gives the same mellow flavor as that 
obtained when the vinegar is scalded. 

Sugar has a tendency to harden fruits and vegetables, 
and too heavy a syrup may toughen and spoil fruit made 
into sweet pickles. Some varieties of peaches and all 
melons should be cooked tender in water before the pick- 
ling syrup is added to them. 

Pickled Cantaloupe or Watermelon 
Peel the fruit, cut into strips, cover with cold water, 



[316] MRS. DE GRAF'S COOK BOOK 

adding 1 tablespoon salt to each 2 quarts of water and 
boil gently until very tender, then drain well and pack in 
sterilized jars. 

Boil vinegar enough to cover the fruit, adding 2 table- 
spoons of sugar for each quart of vinegar and 2 table- 
spoons of whole mixed spices tied in a muslin bag. Let 
the spices and vinegar boil for 10 minutes, then pour over 
the fruit in the jars until overflowing. Seal tightly and 
store in a cool place. 

Sweet Pickled Pears 

Cut 6 or 8 medium-sized pears in halves, remove core 
and press 1 or 2 cloves into each half-pear. Put yi cup of 
vinegar, 3 inch piece of cinnamon bark, broken in small 
pieces, and 2 cups of brown sugar in a saucepan over the 
lire. 

When boiling point is reached, add several pieces of the 
pears and cook until tender, but not broken. Place in a 
sterilized jar and when all are cooked fill jar to overflowing 
with the syrup, adjust rubber and covers, and set aside in 
a cool place. The amount given above is for a 1 quart jar. 
This recipe also applies to peaches, except that for this 
fruit the peel should be removed. 

Pickled String Beans 

Remove ends and strings from beans, but keep them 
full length. Cover with boiling water and cook about 15 
minutes; drain, rinse in cold water and drain again. 

Pour over them scalding hot vinegar enough to cover. 
These beans will be ready to serve in 24 hours. 

Sour Cucumber Pickles 

Select small cucumbers, wash, sprinkle with salt and 
cover with cold water. Use 1 cup of salt for each gallon 
of water. 

Allow to stand over-night or about 12 to 14 hours, then 
rinse and pack in fruit jars or crocks. Add green or red 
peppers, also whole spices. Cover with scalding vinegar. 
If using fruit jars, sterilize and seal carefully. If stored 
in an earthenware crock, place a plate with a weight on 



MRS. DE GRAF'S COOK BOOK [317] 

top to keep the pickles in the vinegar, then cover the jar. 
These pickles should keep almost indefinitely. 

Ginger root, horseradish and mustard seeds may be 
added to the hot vinegar. 

Sweet Cucumber Pickles 

Prepare as for sour pickles, adding sugar to taste to the 
hot vinegar. 

Piccalilli 

4 cups green tomatoes. % cup salt. 

2 cups red tomatoes. 4 cups vinegar. 

3^2 small cabbage. 4 cups brown sugar. 

2 onions. 1 teaspoon mustard. 
1 green pepper. 1 teaspoon pepper. 

1 small red pepper. 1 teaspoon celery seed. 

3 cucumbers. 1 teaspoon mustard seed. 

Chop the vegetables, cover with salt, and allow to 
stand over night. Drain and press in a cloth to remove 
all liquid; add vinegar, sugar and spices and let simmer 
until clear. This will take about an hour. Store in hot 
sterilized jars. Canned tomatoes may be used instead of 
the green ones. 

Chilli Sauce 

12 ripe tomatoes. 3 tablespoons sugar. 

J^ teaspoon pepper. 2 tablespoons salt. 

3 onions. 2 cups vinegar. 

3 green peppers. 1 teaspoon cinnamon. 

Peel tomatoes and onions and chop all vegetables 
separately very fine. Combine ingredients and cook 
slowly about an hour and a half. Two quarts of canned 
tomatoes may replace the raw ones. If liked highly sea- 
soned, little red chili peppers may be added. 

Tomato Catsup 

4 cups cooked tomatoes. ^i teaspoon pepper. 

1 tablespoon salt. 3^ teaspoon each cinnamon, 

1 onion grated. cloves and nutmeg. 

2 tablespoons sugar. % cup vinegar. 

Combine and cook slowly until thick. Put through a 
sieve, reheat and bottle. If liked a clove of garlic may be 
added to the catsup. 



[318] MRS. DE GRAF'S COOK BOOK 

Dill Pickles 

Fill a jar with small cucumbers. Between them place 
a small piece of dill. For each jar add 1 tablespoon salt. 

Pour cold water over the pickles, place a piece of dill 
on top and seal tightly as for canned fruit. Place in a 
warm place or in the sun until the liquid becomes cloudy. 
Then it will become clear again and by that time the 
pickles are ready for use. 

Mustard Pickles 

4 cups small cucumbers. 6 large green peppers. 

4 cups small onions. 1 head cauliflower. 

1 green tomato. 3 stalks celery. 

Cut in suitable pieces and soak in weak salt water 24 
hours. Then cook in same water until tender and drain. 
Make a dressing of 

6 level tablespoons ground 1 cup flour, 

mustard. 2 quarts vinegar. 

13^ cups sugar. 

Mix dry ingredients, add vinegar slowly. Cook in 
double boiler until thick. Pour over pickles and seal in 
jars. 

Apple Chutney 

Pare, core and cut in quarters about a dozen very sour 
apples. Peel and slice 3 medium-sized onions; chop fine 
or put through the food chopper 1 pound of seeded rais- 
ins. Mix these ingredients and add 3 cups of cider vine- 
gar in which y^ cup of salt and 4 cups of sugar have been 
dissolved. In a cheese cloth bag tie 1 tablespoon each of 
mustard seed, whole cloves and small dried chili peppers. 
Cook all together over a slow fire until the apple and 
onions are tender and the chutney is a rich brown color. 
Seal in sterilized bottles. 

Spiced Apples 

Peel, core and quarter 4 cooking apples; prepare a 
syrup of 2 cups of sugar, 1 cup of water and ij^ cups of 
vinegar; add to this whole spices, tied in a cheese cloth; 
cloves and cinnamon will be suflicient. Cook until sugar 
is dissolved, add apples and cook until transparent, but 
not broken. Chill thoroughly before serving. These will 
take the place of spiced peaches. To be served as a relish.

giving are family gathering days. Try to man- 
age so that the family and guests will not feel that the 
dinner has been too great an effort for the person who 
prepared the menu. 

There are so many things which may be prepared some 
time in advance. The mince meat and plum pudding are 
improved with age. Pumpkin may be steamed and sealed, 
while hot, in jars as any canned fruit, or the canned 
pumpkin may be purchased ready for use. The mayon- 
naise can be prepared and set aside in a covered jar. 
Salted nuts and those needed for salad can also be pre- 
pared. The day before Christmas clean and prepare the 
turkey or chicken, but do not wash until just before cook- 
ing or the flavor will be impaired. The dressing can be 
made and set aside in a covered bowl. It is a very easy 
task to wash the bird and add stuffing just before putting 
in the oven. Simmer the liver, heart and gizzard in 
enough water to cover, until tender. Drain, chop very 
fine, add the liquid they were cooked in and set aside for 
the gravy. 

Pastry may be made for pies, and if the pies are to be 
reheated they may be completed a day in advance. 

If vegetables are to be freshly cooked, wash them, but 
do not remove peel or let them stand very long in cold 
water before cooking as much of the valuable mineral 
salts would be lost. If the vegetables are to be reheated 
in a sauce or in fritters, they may be cooked and set aside 
until needed. 

Other meats may easily be substituted for those called 
for in the following menus. Chicken may be roasted in- 
stead of turkey; a chicken pie or fricassee will be found 
appetizing. A crown roast of pork or lamb is very de- 
licious as well as attractive; roast leg of lamb boned and 
stuffed; roast goose or duck. Turkey is sometimes almost 
prohibitive in price, which makes it necessary for many 



MRS. DE GRAF'S COOK BOOK [321] 

families to forego the traditional Christmas and Thanks- 
giving dinner. 

When planning the holiday dinner, do not forget that 
the turkey is the piece de resistance and do not have too 
many courses to precede the main one or the appetite 
will be satisfied before the turkey appears.

SUGGESTIONS FOR THE MIDNIGHT SUPPER; A 

SERIES OF RECIPES FOR AFTER 

THEATER OR PARTY 

The late supper is usually a meal of luxury, not at all 
a necessity; in fact, we would be much better off if we did 
not indulge in rich food before retiring. But refreshments 
offer a pleasing way to extend hospitality and the hostess 
usually takes pride in her ability to exhibit her skill in 
providing a tempting supper. 

This additional meal must not be too heavy, not have 
too great a variety of dishes; it should be carefully planned, 
well cooked and daintily served. If one is the proud 
possessor of a chafing dish the main course may be pre- 
pared at the table. As this type of cookery takes place 
before an audience, it requires planning; all necessary 
preparatory cooking should be done in advance; the in- 
gredients all assembled and measured before being placed 
on the table. If this is all arranged ahead of time, the 
actual cooking is not difficult. However, if preferred, the 
food may be cooked just before the guests are called to 
the table and then served from the chafing dish. 

Creamed fish or chicken dishes are easily made and 
suitable for these late suppers. They are rather sub- 
stantial and should be followed by a very light sweet 
course, preferably fruit in some form. 

A considerable part of chafing dish cookery depends 
upon the preparation of sauces and it is essential that one 
first master the art of making savory sauces before at- 
tempting any great variety of chafing dish cookery. For 
those persons who do not possess a chafing dish the food 
may be cooked on the stove or over hot water. 

If numbers are too numerous for a hot course, sand- 
wiches are always acceptable and may be of many varie- 
ties. Sandwiches should be made of bread not too fresh 
to cut well; nor so old that it is dry; they should be soft 
but not moist. If meat is used it is much better chopped 
fine and mixed to a paste with cream, softened butter or 
very thick mayonnaise. If this is not desired than cut the 
meat in very thin slices, and cut each slice in several 



[324] MRS. DE GRAF'S COOK BOOK 

pieces, place on buttered bread and season before cover- 
ing with the second slice of bread. It is never desirable 
to use large slices of meat, even if cut very thin, because 
it is difficult to eat gracefully. Always cream the butter 
well to spread on sandwiches. It will then spread easily 
and the merest suggestion of butter is all that is necessary. 

Cheese dishes are usually relished by the majority of 
persons and there are numerous ways in which cheese can 
be used to supply the main ingredient. If cheese is com- 
bined with other foods, such as in sauces, and cooked only 
long enough to melt, it will not be found harder to digest 
than many other popular dishes. 

However, as cheese is a highly concentrated food, use 
only enough for flavor, and the best results are obtained 
by grating. 

Most of the hot dishes used for late suppers are also 
suitable for luncheon dishes. 

Salad is always popular. Its presence at any meal is 
welcome and for the maidless household it offsets a very 
easy course for the midnight supper. Accompanied by 
rolls (reheated) or freshly baked biscuits, almost any 
variety of salad will be relished. The essentials are to be 
able to make a well-seasoned salad dressing and to serve 
the salad cold. 

If meat or poultry is to be used for the salad, it should 
be cut into dice (not chopped) and mixed with a well- 
seasoned French dressing for several hours before being 
combined with the remaining salad ingredients. Use only 
enough of the dressing to season the meat. Fish should 
be flaked and treated in the same manner. 

All combinations of fruit are palatable in a salad. 
Regardless of what type of dressing is to be used, a little 
lemon juice should always be added to a fruit salad. Mix 
fruits lightly with a silver fork and chill thoroughly be- 
fore serving. 

From a hygienic standpoint the late supper is hardly 
to be encouraged; however, this will have to be deter- 
mined by the individual. And in order to overcome the 
possibility of an unpleasant aftermath keep this extra 
meal as simple as possible. If the main course is to be 
rich in sauces or cheese, do not plan an elaborate dessert, 



MRS. DE GRAF'S COOK BOOK [325] 

but keep to fruits and attractive light but not nutritious 
desserts. Fruit cocktails are always refreshing and may 
be used as dessert for the late supper. For that matter 
the informal supper does not demand a sweet course. Or 
the sweet course, if rich with cream in any form, and 
served with little cakes and a beverage, may constitute 
the entire supper. It is not the variety that makes a de- 
lightful supper party, but the daintiness of table and ser- 
vice, the excellence of the food that is offered and the 
general informality of the occasion. Above all, if one is 
both hostess and maid, plan dishes that can be prepared 
in advance. Keep everything simple, for nothing so mars 
the enjoyment of guests than to be conscious of a very 
busy hostess. 



Cream Cheese and Pineapple Salad 

Arrange slices of pineapple on crisp lettuce leaves. 
Press cottage or cream cheese through a potato ricer. 
Place on top of pineapple and place a spoonful of thick

glasses. Pour the Louis dressing over the crab and gar- 
nish with stuffed olives. 



Casaba Melon Salad 

Cut casaba melon into balls with a French potato cutter 
or cut into cubes. Peel and seed an equal quantity of 
white grapes; add to melon, arrange in crisp lettuce leaves, 
pour over all a French dressing, then sprinkle the top with 
cottage or white cream cheese which has been pressed 
through a potato ricer.

Easy To Carry Hints in Camp Cookery 
for Outdoor Enthusiasts 

For the week-end camper cooking is comparatively 
easy. Most of the food is prepared at home or purchased 
en route, and boiled meat, boiled or fried eggs, tea and 
coffee constitute most of the necessary cooking. The 
week-end camping trip is sort of a prolonged picnic, and 
if space is not too much of a factor and the party not too 
large, very appetizing meals can be planned, containing 
canned goods, bread, cake or cookies, which will require 
very little preparation for satisfactory meals. 

The regular camping trip of a week or more presents an 
altogether different problem and necessitates considerable 
cooking. Everyone is hungry. Out-of-door life certainly 
develops an appetite and the amount of food a party of 
healthy persons can consume is sometimes appalling to 
the cook. 

The success of an outing of this character depends 
largely upon good meals. Poor cooking on a camping trip 
has caused more unpleasantness among friends than any 
other discomfort or inconvenience. No matter how 
patient one is under extreme heat, mosquitoes, or the 
many annoyances which are apt to arise, everyone will be 
happy and forget their troubles if the "eats" are good and 
plentiful. Regardless of how smoothly other things run, 
if the food is not satisfactory, the trip will be somewhat 
of a failure. There is one comforting thought, however, 
which will encourage camp cooks — we all know genuine 
hunger is not critical and food will taste most appetizing 
under camping conditions which would not be tolerated 
at home. 

The simplest food is the most appetizing and also the 
best to eat and prepare. Good coffee will cover a multi- 
tude of shortcomings, and put everyone in good humor. 
To make really good coffee in camp is an art. One of the 
first essentials is to have the coffee pot thoroughly washed 
each time it is used. Let it stand open in a sunny place 
when not in use. This is most important, otherwise the 



[330] MRS. DE GRAF'S COOK BOOK 

coffee will be bitter. Allow 1 rounding tablespoon of 
ground coffee for each cup of water used, then allow 1 
extra tablespoonful in the pot for good measure. Use 
cold water and set the pot in a hot place and allow to 
reach boiling point and boil three minutes, no longer; set 
in a warm place, but not over the fire, add ^ cupful of 
cold water and let stand 5 or 10 minutes before using. 
The pot should be tightly covered, even taking care to 
stop up the spout so that none of the aroma will be lost. 
The yi cup of cold water is added last to clear the coffee. 
Egg may be added instead, and if used should be mixed 
with the ground coffee before adding any of the cold 
water. 

A clear, golden coffee will reward your efforts, which, 
with canned cream and sugar will be hailed with joy. No 
matter how weary and tired from a day's tramp, a good 
cup of coffee will stimulate and rest one. 

Baked beans, well cooked, make a good dinner. Dig a 
hole large enough to hold several stones; heat them very 
hot, also have a bed of coals. The beans should be soaked 
over night in sufficient cold water to cover. In the morn- 
ing drain off all water cover with fresh cold water and 
bring to the boiling point and cook about Y^ hour. Drain 
again. Put a piece of salt pork or bacon in the bottom of 
the bean pot or iron kettle, add beans, another piece of 
salt pork or bacon. Mix seasoning of mustard (may be 
omitted) salt, pepper, and either sugar or molasses, the 
latter giving the best flavor; add a pint of hot water and 
pour over beans; then cover beans entirely with hot water; 
cover closely and set on top of hot coals; put the heated 
stones on top, pack with dirt and make as nearly air-tight 
as possible. Let cook all day — about 8 or 10 hours. Be 
sure and have a kettle or pot large enough to hold suffi- 
cient water to completely cook the beans; otherwise they 
will taste scorched. 

If brown beans are preferred, they should be soaked 
over night also, but they will not require so long a time to 
cook, and the seasonings should be tomato sauce and 
onions. A small fireless cooker is a great help on a long 
camping trip. 

A self-rising pancake flour is easy to carry and is most 



MRS. DE GRAF'S COOK BOOK [331] 

convenient for outing trips. These flours only require 
an equal quantity of cold water and they are ready to 
bake. With a small bed of coals, a griddle or heavy frying- 
pan can be kept at a uniform heat, and if different per- 
sons take a turn at frying them, this type of pancake will 
make an easily prepared meal. 

Perhaps the hardest task of all is to make the camp 
bread, and to be able to make it well is one of the tests of 
a good outdoor cook. The best utensil for baking in camp 
is a shallow iron kettle with an iron cover, commonly 
known as a "Dutch oven." Have a bed of coals, but rake 
them to one side and set the kettle in the center; put in 
the bread, cover and heap the coals on top and let bread 
cook about ^ hour. One of the commonest faults v/ith 
camp cooking is having too much heat; the inexperienced 
camper builds a big fire which creates a quantity of smoke 
and makes cooking impossible. Hot coals are needed and 
a well-built campfire will soon produce them. Avoid hav- 
ing left-overs, for it is not easy to utilize them in camp 
cookery. Have simple meals, but aim to have food well 
prepared. Variety at each meal is not essential, but 
variety is desirable each day. Beans served for several 
meals in succession are certainly not appetizing. 

Potatoes and fish may be wrapped in clean wet paper 
and cooked in hot ashes. 

If canned milk is used allow 3^ milk to 3^ water for 
cooking purposes. When milk is mentioned in a recipe it 
means fresh milk or canned milk diluted in this propor- 
tion. 

Any food which is cooked in a frying-pan or kettle can 
easily be managed over a campfire. If each person will do 
their share of the cooking and the inevitable dish washing, 
a camping trip will work no hardship on any one indi- 
vidual. 

Camp Bread 

4 cups flour (1 quart). 2 rounding tablespoons short- 
2 level tablespoons baking pow- ening. 

der. 1^ (about) cups milk or half 
2 teaspoons salt. milk and half water. 

Mix all dry ingredients; rub in shortening with the 
finger tips, and gradually add liquid, using a knife for 



[332] MRS. DE GRAF'S COOK BOOK 

mixing. Knead a little in the bowl, pat into shape, and 
place in a greased iron kettle or heavy frying-pan; cover 
closely, set over hot ashes or heated rocks, cover with hot 
coals or rocks and bake about 30 minutes. 

Corn Bread 

4 cups corn meal. 2 cups of milk or half milk and 
4 cups boiling water. half water. 

2 teaspoons salt. 3 tablespoons melted shorten- 

3 tablespoons sugar. ing. 

2 level tablespoons baking pow- 2 eggs, well beaten, 
der. 

Pour boiling water over corn meal and let stand until 
cool; then add remaining ingredients. Beat well and pour 
into a heated iron kettle or frying-pan. Set over hot ashes 
or heated coals until done. If baking powder and eggs are 
not used you will have corn pone. 

Camp Pot Pie 

Any kind of meat may be used. Cut in medium-sized 
pieces and dip in flour. Heat drippings or shortening in 
a heavy kettle or frying-pan, add meat and brown on all 
sides. If there is a quantity of meat, fry only a portion at 
one time so all will be brown, then cover with boiling 
water; cover tightly and set over hot ashes or a low bed of 
coals for 2 or 3 hours. The meat should cook under the 
boiling point, otherwise it will be tough. About an hour 
before serving add seasonings and vegetables. 

Camp Dumplings 

2 cups flour. 1 teaspoon salt. 

1 tablespoon (level) baking 1 cup milk, 

powder. 

Mix in order named and drop by spoonfuls on top of 
boiling stew. Cover closely and cook about 15 minutes. 
These dumplings are very acceptable at the camp dinner. 
Success depends upon having the liquid constantly boil- 
ing and keeping kettle closely covered. 

Camp Shortcake 

Prepare one-half the camp bread mixture. Bake as 
directed for bread. When cooked, split open, butter and 
spread with sweetened fruit. A very easy dish to prepare.

Suggestions for the Picnic Lunch 

The picnic lunch affords an opportunity for much 
thought and display in one's ability to prepare an appe- 
tizing cold meal. The fact that the food must be in such 
form that it may be easily carried limits the variety. 

Sandwiches play the most important part on the picnic 
menu. 

Everyone is hungry, and while fruit is refreshing and 
sweets are relished, after all it is the sandwich which 
makes the lunch, and there should be several varieties. 

Bread is better which is a day old. The dark breads, 
such as graham, rye, Boston brown bread, and the various 
nut- breads made with baking powder, all offer variety. 
Always cream butter well before putting upon the bread. 
It will spread evenly and there will be no waste. It is 
easier to spread butter on the bread before cutting each 
slice. But if the sandwiches are to be cut in various 
fancy shapes do not butter the bread until after it is cut, 
otherwise there will be a waste of butter. 

Cut bread very thin and try to put the slices together 
in pairs if the filling is not added at once. If sandwiches 
are to be cut in various fancy shapes, do not butter the 
bread until after it has been cut or there will be a waste of 
butter. Wrap sandwiches in waxed paper or wring a napkin 
outof hot water and wrap around the prepared sandwiches; 
then pack in a box closely covered and keep in as cool a 
place as possible. If the crusts of bread are to be removed 
set aside and later dry them out in a moderate oven, roll 
and put in covered jars to be used for breading croquettes, 
fish, etc., or for scalloped dishes. To make rolled sand- 
wiches remove all the crust from a fresh loaf of white bread 
and wrap the loaf in a damp cloth for several hours, keep- 
ing in a cool place. 

Cut in thin slices lengthwise, spread with creamed 
butter and whatever filling desired and roll as for a jelly 
roll, fastening together with a toothpick. If the loaf of 
bread is large, 1 slice will make 2 sandwich rolls. Wrap 
it in a waxed paper. If sliced, cooked meat is to be used 
as a filling, it should be very tender and be sliced as thin 



[334] MRS. DE GRAF'S COOK BOOK 

as possible, and then each slice of meat should be cut in 
several pieces. However, finely chopped meat is the best, 
put through a food chopper or chopped in a chopping 
bowl. All meat sandwich fillings should be well seasoned. 
For corned beef use prepared mustard; for roast beef, 
either Worcestershire sauce or horseradish; for tongue, a 
thick mayonnaise and finely chopped pickles; for mutton 
or lamb, add tomato catsup and chopped capers; for 
chopped ham, a thick mayonnaise well seasoned with 
mustard. 

The different relishes make excellent seasoning for meat 
sandwiches. Picalilli, chow-chow, chopped olives, walnut 
catsup, etc., all add flavor and variety. For salad sand- 
wiches make a very thick well-seasoned mayonnaise and 
have the salad ingredients cut fine. Lettuce should be 
very crisp and each leaf well dried before placing on the 
bread. Relishes such as olives, pickles, radishes, celery or 
salted nuts are very easy to carry. Sweets may be pro- 
vided in cake, cookies, doughnuts or sweet sandwiches. 

If the sandwiches are to be kept several hours before 
serving, wrap them in oiled paper, or wring a napkin as 
dry as possible out of hot water and wrap about the pre- 
pared sandwiches, keeping them as cool as possible. 

Coffee is easily managed by using the powdered, pre- 
pared type which needs only hot water to make. Sugar 
and powdered or canned milk are easily carried. If 
lemonade is to be used, extract the lemon juice, make a 
syrup of sugar and water, allowing ^ cup of sugar for 
each lemon and enough hot water to dissolve it; boil 1 
minute and add lemon juice, bottle. Add cold water when 
wanted. Never pack fish sandwiches near other food, 
and be sure each article of food is well wrapped or packed 
so that it will not come in contact with other foods. 
Much of the success of the picnic lunch depends upon the 
appearance of the food, so careful packing is a necessity. 

Olive Sandwich Filling 

Chop olives, mix with enough thick mayonnaise to 
make a paste, then spread on bread. Lettuce leaf may 
also be added. 



MRS. DE GRAF'S COOK BOOK [335] 

Bacon Sandwich Filling 

Have bacon cut very thin, cook until crisp and put 
between slices of buttered bread while still warm. Wrap 
in waxed paper. 

Savory Ham Filling 

1 cup finely chopped ham. 2 sour pickles, finely chopped. 

14 cup thick ayonnaise. 

Mix and spread on thin slices of bread. 
Egg Sandwich Filling 

Shell hard cooked eggs; cut in two and remove yolks. 
Chop the egg whites and put yolks through a sieve, com- 
bine and add thick mayonnaise to make a paste. Chopped 
stuffed olives may be added also. 

Pimento and Cheese 

1 small Neuchatel or breakfa^st 1 pimento, chopped, 
cheese. 

Moisten with thick mayonnaise. 

Noisette Sandwiches 

Use nut bread, spread with cream cheese and butter, 
beaten together until soft enough to spread. Cover with 
orange marmalade, then place plain slice of bread on top. 
Cut in triangles. 

California Sandwiches 

Equal quantities of chopped seeded raisins and wal- 
nuts. Flavor with a little lemon juice. Spread on graham 
bread. 

Ham and Egg Sandwich 

1 cup chopped ham. 34 cup mayonnaise.

Candies 

The base, or foundation, of all cream candies is fondant. 
If directions are carefully followed fondant can easily be 
made, and from this foundation an almost endless variety 
of combinations. As sugar syrups are easily affected by 
atmospheric conditions, it will be advisable to select a 
clear day for making candies. 

The following rules should be constantly kept in mind 
when cooking syrup for fondant: Scald the saucepan be- 
fore using, to be sure no odor or taste is left from previous 
use. Never stir the syrup after the sugar has dissolved 
and cooking has commenced. If stirred the finished 
product will be granular. When testing the syrup, reduce 
the heat under the saucepan or carefully remove from the 
fire in order to prevent further cooking. Always cover 
the saucepan until the boiling point is reached. If any 
sugar has gathered on the saucepan, the steam created by 
covering the utensil will remove it. Wash the hands in 
cold water before kneading the fondant. Never attempt 
to make a larger quantity at one time than recipe calls 
for; even half that amount might be easier at first. If a 
quantity is desired, make the recipe several times — it will 
be much more successful. 

Fondant 

To 4 cups of granulated sugar, J^ teaspoon of cream 
of tartar, add 2 cups of boiling water. Mix carefully until 
sugar is dissolved, to avoid any possibility of sugar grains 
gathering on the sides of the saucepan. This is most im- 
portant, and if sugar has gathered on the kettle carefully 
wash it off with a damp cloth. If the saucepan is not kept 
free of sugar the fondant will become grainy. Cover kettle 
until boiling point is reached, then uncover and cook until 
the syrup will form a soft ball (238 deg. F.) when dropped 
in cold water. This will take about 10 minutes. When 
cooked remove from the fire at once and set aside to cool 
in the kettle in which it was cooked. The syrup should 
cool evenly, so must not be poured into a cold dish. When 
cool, but not cold, stir well with a flat wooden spoon until 



[338] MRS. DE GRAF'S COOK BOOK 

the syrup has changed to a white, creamy mass, too stiff 
to stir. Turn on to a moulding board and knead just as 
you would bread. The lightness of the fondant depends 
upon the amount of kneading it has received. Place in a 
bowl or jar, cover with a damp cloth and set aside in a 
cool place for several hours, when it will be ready for the 
various types of cream candies. If well made, fondant 
will be very white, glossy and satiny in appearance, and 
should be as smooth as butter when rolled between the 
fingers. Sometimes fondant will become grainy, or sugary, 
and if this condition should happen put it in a saucepan, 
add hot water to cover, stir until dissolved and cook again 
to the soft-ball stage. 

Maple Fondant 

Maple fondant is made with 2 cups of brown sugar, 1 
cup of maple syrup, yi teaspoon cream of tartar and 1 
cup of boiling water. Mix carefully and cook in the same 
manner as the white fondant. 

Cream Drops 

Divide the fondant into several portions, using about 
yi cupful for each portion; place one part in a cup or 
bowl and set in a pan of hot water until fondant is melted, 
then flavor, color and drop from the tip of a teaspoon on 
to a slightly greased paper. Each part should be flavored 
and colored differently. These creams will harden at 
once, but should not be removed from the paper for an 
hour or two. Peppermint, wintergreen, chocolate, lemon 
and orange are the best flavors to use. Perfectly harmless 
vegetable colorings come in a paste form, and it requires 
only a small amount to produce a delicate color. They 
come in tiny jars and will last for several years, so are not 
expensive. 

Stuffed Prunes 

A very satisfactory candy, easily made and good for 
the children. Wash prunes well, then place in a steamer 
over hot water until they become plump, but not soft or 
broken. Cool, remove pit and stuff with vanilla or choco- 
late flavored fondant. Roll the fondant in balls before 



MRS. DE GRAF'S COOK BOOK [339] 

stuffing prunes. Or fill prunes with marshmallows. For a 
dinner confection, stuff prunes with salted almonds or 
walnut meats. 

Chocolate Creams 

Flavor fondant and roll into small balls; set aside to 
dry for an hour or more. Use a dipping or an unsweetened 
chocolate for coating. Melt the chocolate over hot water 
and do not keep over the fire after it has melted. Dip 
each ball of fondant into the chocolate, using a candy 
dipper or a fork. Do this quickly, so that too much choc- 
olate is not coated to the fondant, for it will only run off 
and spread as the candy dries. Set each cream on a 
slightly greased or waxed paper to dry. 

Walnut Creams 

Flavor fondant, roll into small balls, then press half a 
walnut meat on each side; set aside to dry. Pecans or 
almonds may be used in the same manner. 

Nut Bars 

Knead chopped nuts into flavored fondant and make 
into a roll about 2 inches thick and 5 or 6 inches long. 
Cut off pieces about yi inch thick and set aside to dry. 

Cocoanut Bars 

Knead cocoanut into flavored fondant; roll about 2 
inches thick and several inches long and cut into ^ inch 
slices. 

Candied Orange Peel 

Remove the skin from oranges in quarters; put in a 
saucepan, cover with cold water and bring to the boiling 
point. Simmer until tender. Drain; remove all the white 
portion; cut in thin strips with the scissors; boil 1 cup of 
sugar with yi cup of hot water until it spins a thread when 
dropped from the tip of a spoon; add the orange peel, 
cook 5 minutes, drain from syrup and roll in granulated 
sugar. 



[340] MRS. DE GRAF'S COOK BOOK

Add milk to sugar, stir until dissolved and boil until 
syrup will form a soft ball when dropped in cold water. 
Add nuts and flavoring and beat until creamy. Pour into 
a buttered pan and when cool cut in squares. 

Peanut Brittle 

Take equal parts of sugar and peanuts which have been 
roasted, shelled and broken. Melt sugar in an iron frying 
pan over a slow fire until a golden syrup is formed. It 
will be necessary to stir this constantly. As soon as the 
syrup begins to color remove from the fire; the heat of the 
pan should finish the cooking; then add the peanuts, mix 
and pour on an ungreased platter. When cold and hard 
break into pieces. 

Glace Nuts 

Halves of walnuts, pecans, almond or Brazil nuts are 
dipped into the melted sugar just before it turns brown. 
Drop each coated nut on a greased plate to cool and 
harden.

Invalid Cookery 




ooD for the sick and convalescent should be care- 
fully prepared and daintily served. The attractive 
appearance has much to do towards tempting a 
capricious appetite. In severe cases of sickness 
the physician in charge usually prescribes the diet, and 
regardless of the wishes or cravings of the patient the 
doctor's orders should be carried out implicitly. In mild 
cases of sickness or during convalescence, nutrious and 
easily digested food is required to bring the body back to 
its normal condition. 

While there is no effort on the part of the patient that 
would seem to require energy foods, nevertheless the body 
requirements are almost the same during illness as in 
health. After a long acute illness a convalescing patient 
may require more food than when perfectly well in order 
to bring the body back to its normal condition, and also 
supply the daily food requirements. If insufficient fuel 
food is supplied during illness the body will have to draw 
upon its own reserve which will weaken the patient and 
make recovery slow. 

The foods selected should be easily digested and assimi- 
lated in order to place no undue tax upon the system. 

Milk in some form, either plain or in combination with 
cereals, eggs, etc., is one of the most valuable foods for 
the invalid's tray. 

Gruels are easily digested and assimilated but unless 
taken in quantities will not supply sufficient nutriment. 
Their chief value is to allay hunger, often imaginary on 
the part of the patient. 

Beef juice has very little fuel value unless taken in 
quantity. As it is not as palatable as broth or beef tea 
it is usually served in small portions. 

Broths and clear soups contain little nutriment but are 
relished for their soothing qualities if served hot, and 
refreshing if served cold. When some thickening medium 
such as eggs or cereals are added to any of these gruels 
or broths their food value increases. 



MRS. DE GRAF'S COOK BOOK [343]

M cup lukewarm water. 2 cups gluten flour. 

}/z cake compressed yeast. 

Soak yeast cake in lukewarm water until soft. Scald 
water and cool to lukewarm, then add yeast; salt, and grad- 
ually beat in the flour until dough is too stiff to handle, 
then knead thoroughly, using more flour if necessary. Be 
sure the water is only lukewarm otherwise the mixture 
will be sticky and hard to handle. Shape into a loaf and 
place in a greased pan. Let stand in a moderately warm 
place until the loaf doubles in size. Bake about 45 min- 
utes in a hot oven.

then strain. 

Farina Gruel 

2 tablespoons Farina. 1 cup hot milk. 
]/2 cup cold water. ]/^ teaspoon salt. 
1 cup boiling water. 

Mix Farina with cold water, then add to salted boiling 
water. Cook directly over the fire 5 minutes, then over 
hot water 30 minutes. Add the hot milk and serve. The

1 pound of roimd steak. 3^ teaspoon salt. 

2 cups cold water. 



[344] MRS. DE GRAF'S COOK BOOK 

Wipe steak with a damp cloth. Remove all fat and cut 
into half-inch cubes. Put meat into a quart glass fruit-jar, 
add cold water and let stand half an hour to extract the 
juice. Adjust rubber band and cover tightly on jar and 
set on a rack or plate placed in the bottom of a large 
kettle. Surround with cold water and gradually heat 
until water is hot but not boiling. Keep hot for about 
2 hours. Strain and cool. Remove all fat, reheat, season 
and serve in hot cups. 

Beef Juice 

1 pound of top round steak. 

Wipe meat and remove all fat. Broil about 1 minute 
on each side to start the juices, then slash meat both 
lengthwise and crosswise that more juice may be extracted. 
Squeeze out the juice in a press, lemon squeezer or potato 
ricer. Pour into a hot cup, season slightly with salt and 
serve. Very little of this juice can be relished at one time, 
one-half a cupful or less. 

Mutton or Beef Broth 

The cheaper cuts of meat should be used. For each 
pound of meat and bones allow 4 cups or 1 quart of cold 
water, 1 teaspoon of salt. Wipe the meat, remove skin 
and cut into small pieces. Have bones well-cracked, and 
broken. Put into a kettle, add cold water, and let stand 
30 minutes to extract the juices. Add salt and gradually 
heat to simmering point. Keep below boiling point about 
4 hours or until meat is very tender. Strain and cool. 
Remove fat. Reheat in a double boiler or over hot water, 
season and serve. Broths should be made a day before 
serving so that all the fat may be easily removed. Cooked 
rice or pearl barley may be added to the strained broth. 

Chicken Broth

YORKSHIRE PUDDING 94 



IN all recipes calling 
for baking powder, 
insure successful re- 
sults by using Royal 
Baking Powder (abso- 
lutely pure). 

It is conceded by do- 
mestic science teacher^ 
and baking experts the 
world over to be "the 
most healthful and 
dependable baking 
powder made." Royal 
contains no alum. 



It answers 




HOCOUTE 




purpose 



Knowing Ghirardelli's Ground 
Chocolate as I do, it is hard 
for me to understand why any 
housewife will crowd her 
pantry with cake chocolate 
for baking and cooking, and 
cocoa for drinking, when 
Ghirardelli's serves tyery pur- 
pose. 

Not only does this chocolate 
make a flavory and nutritive 
breakfast-drink but it answers 
every need for baking and 
dessert making. Cakes, pud- 
dings, icings, frozen desserts, 
sauces — you can call on Ghir- 
ardelli's for a host of dishes, 
dainty and substantial. 

Moreover, Ghirardelli's comes 
to you already ground, ready 
to use. No grating, no bother, 
no time lost- And no waste! 
You measure off exactly what 
you need — no more, no less.

Qfc key to belter meals 
in every home 



A, 



Jter all, successful menus de- 
pend as much upon the quality of 
the ingredients as upon the skill 
and knowledge of the housewife. 

Even the most ingenious cook 
cannot produce fine cakes, pies or 
breads from poor materials. In 
all my years of experience, I have 
had unusual opportunity to test 
Sperry Products thoroughly — in 
the class room, in the laboratory, 
in the kitchen. As a result, I can 
conscientiously recommend them 
all as the highest quality. Sperry 
Drifted Snow Flour can be used 
for every purpose — from the per- 
fect loaf of bread to the most deli- 
cate Angel Cake. While Sperry 
Red Package Cereals carry the same 
surety of purity and uniformity.

Celebrated for Sliced and Prepared Ahalones 
Various JVays of Preparing this Appetizing Seafood 

FRIED ABALONE STEAKS 

Sprinkle abalone steaks with salt and pepper. Beat 

1 egg slightly. Dip steaks in egg, then roll in flour or 
cracker meal. Fry in hot olive oil or butter until a 
delicate brown on both sides. Cook quickly, as long 
cooking toughens abalone. 

ABALONE CHOWDER 

Cut 1 pound of abalone into half-inch cubes. Cut 1 
slice of salt pork into several pieces, place in a deep 
kettle and cook until slightly brown. Add 1 onion 
sliced thin and cook 5 minutes. Add 2 quarts of boiling 
water, abalone, 2 medium-sized potatoes peeled and cut 
in cubes, a pinch of thyme and a bay leaf. Simmer 30 
minutes, salt and pepper to taste and just before serv- 
ing add 2 tablespoons of butter and 1 cup of cream. 

ABALONE FRITTERS 

Put 1 pound of abalone through a food chopper. Sift 
together 1 cup of flour, 3^ teaspoon salt and 1 teaspoon 
of baking powder. Add abalone and mix well, then add 

2 well-beaten eggs. Drop by spoonfuls into hot deep fat 
or fry in a well-buttered pan like pancakes. 

ABALONE SALAD 

Cut 1 pound of abalone into half-inch cubes. Simmer 
in salted hot water until tender. Drain and chill. Add 1 
cup of diced celery hearts and 2 tablespoons grated 
onion. Mix with mayonnaise and serve on crisp lettuce 
leaves. 



Mrs. DeGraf's Endorsement 

of 

Goldberg ^owen & Company 



<J>/2l 



LL my life I have purchased fine food 
products of Goldberg Bowen & Company, 
whether for household or experimental use. 
Materials from this store were used in ex- 
periments which have resulted in many of 
the productions of which the recipes are 
contained in this book. My habit of going to 
this oldest grocery house in San Francisco 
has been confirmed with every experience, 
because I have always found everything I 
have purchased there to be of high quality. 
In some instances, also, when I have had 
some doubt what product or ingredient it 
might be best to use, I have depended on 
Goldberg Bowen's advice and have always 
found such guidance most helpful and de- 
pendable. Moreover, the stock is so immense 
and of such infinite variety that long ago I 
learned to think of Goldberg Bowen & 
Company whenever I have needed anything 
unusual, any article out of the ordinary, any 
special item seldom carried by grocers, and 
never have I been disappointed in finding 
what I sought. That is why I today con- 
tinue to rely on Goldberg Bowen & Company 
for all of my finer materials and supplies. 

Belle DeGraf.
