THE PEOPLE'S COOK BOOK. 



SOUPS. 

The base of soup should be made of good lean fresh meat and bones 
— two ounces of bone to a pound of meat ; allow one quart of water to 
a pound of meat ; put it on a good fire, and when it boils skim well 
and set back where it will simmer for five hours : add a little pepper 
and salt, and then strain into a stone jar and place where it can cool 
quickly. In cold weather this stock will keej) several day§, and from 
it can be made a variety of soups, according to flavorings or materials 
used. Vegetables, tapioca, rice, etc., should be cooked before being 
added, as too much boiling spoils the flavor of the broth. 

It is best to make the broth or stock the day before it is to be used, 
BO that all the grease may be removed. 

Onions are nicer if fried until brown in hot butter before being added 
to the soup. 

Yolks of hard-boiled eggs, poached eggs, lemon slices, or croutons 
are simple additions used with soup. Place in the tureen one for each 
person, and pour the soup over them. 

Stock for Sauces and Gravies.— Place in a saucepan fresh bones of 
beef, mutton, lamb, veal, or poultry, of either or all ; also bones of the 
same meats from roasted pieces or trimmings ; with one quart of cold 
water to every pound of meat or bones, add vegetables and season- 
ings, and simmer six hours; then skim o£E all the fat, pass through a 
strainer, and set aside for use. 

To Make a Soup of the Liquor. — Remove the fat and put two 
quarts, or more if required, of the liquor into a saucepan, and put on 
the fire to boil ; when boiling, sprinkle in two ounces of tapioca or 
sago, and boil fifteen minutes, stirring occasionally. 

Force Meat Bai.ls for Soup.— Take cooked-meat or fowl and chop 
fine; season with pepper, salt, and herbs, and a little lemon ; mix 
together with an egg ; roll in crumbs, and fry in hot lard. 

Stock foe Soup.— Have a large pot on the back of the stove. Put 
in lean beef, either after having been cooked or before, in the pro- 
portion of one pound of beef to one quart of water. Add pork rinds 
with all the fat taken off. This may cook slowly two or three davs. 
When cold, skim off all the fat and put into another vessel. This 
stock may be used for all soups in which meat broth is required. By 
adding for thickening either barley, rice, sago, macaroni or vermicelli, 
it will make any of these soups. 



14 THE PEOPLE'S COOK BOOK. 

BEAN SOUP. 

1. Boil the beans and put them first through a colander and then 
through a sieve; season with butter, pepjjer and salt. 

2. Soak one and a half pints of beans in cold water over night. In 
the morning drain off the water, wash the beans in fresh water, and 
put into soup kettle, with four quarts of good beef stock, from which 
all the fat has been removed. Set it where it will boil slowly but 
steadily till dinner, or three hom's at the least. Two hours before 
dinner slice in an onion and a carrot. Some think it improved by 
adding a little tomato. If the beans are not liked whole, strain through 
a colander and send to the table hot. 

BEEF SOUP. 

Boil a soup bone about four hours, then take out meat into a chop- 
ping bowl ; put the bones back into the kettle. Slice very thin one 
small onion, six potatoes and three turnips into the soup. Boil until 
all are tender. Have at least one gallon of soup when done. It is 
improved by adding crackers rolled, or noodles, just before taking off. 
Take the meat that has been cut from the bones, chop fine while warm, 
season with salt and pepper, and one teacup of soup saved out before 
putting in the vegetables. Pack in a dish, and shce down for tea or 
lunch, when cold. 

BEEF SOUP WITH OKRA. 

Cut a round steak in small pieces and fry three tablespoonf uls of 
butter, together with one sliced onion, until very brown ; put into a 
soup kettle with four quarts of cold water, and boil slowly an hour; 
add salt, pepper and one pint of sliced okra, and simmer three and 
one-half hours longer. Strain before serving. 

COENED BEEF SOUP. 
When the liquid in which the beef and vegetables were boiled is 
cold, remove all the grease that has risen and hardened on top, and 
add tomatoes and tomato ketchup and boil half an hour — thus making 
an excellent tomato soup ; or add to it rice or sago, or pearl barley, or 
turn it into a vegetable soup by boiling in the liquor any vegetables 
that are fancied ; several varieties of soup may have this " stock" for 
a basis, and be agreeable and nutritious. 

COBN SOUP. 

1. Cut the corn from the cob, and to a pint of corn allow one quart 
of hot water ; boil an hour and pass through a colander ; put into a 
saucepan an ounce of butter and a tablespoonf ul of flour, being careful 
to stir well to prevent it being lumpy ; then add the corn pulp, a little 
cayenne pepper, salt, and a pint of boiling milk, and half a pint of 
cream. 

2. Twelve ears of com scraped and the cob boiled twenty minutes 
in one quart of water. Remove the cobs and put in the corn and boil 
fifteen minutes, then add two quarts of rich milk. Season with salt, 
pepper and butter, and thicken with two tablespoonfuls of flour. 
Boil the whole ten minutes and turn into a tureen on which the yolks 
of three eggs have been well beaten. 



^OUPS. 15 

CHICKEN SOUP. 

1. To the broth in which chickens have been boiled for salad, etc., 
add one onion and eight or ten tomatoes, season with pepper and salt ; 
boil thirty minutes ; add two well beaten eggs just before sending to 
the table. 

2. Roast or bake a chicken until turning brown ; put it in a soup 
kettle with three pints of water, and set on a slow fire ; skim off the 
scum ; add a middling-sized onion, a little celery, and simmer about 
three hours ; take out the chicken and vegetables, strain and use ; 
the chicken may be used for salad. 

3. Boil a pair of chickens with great care, skimming constantly and 
keeping them covered with water. When tender, take out the 
chicken, and remove the bone. Put a large lump of butter into a 
spider, dredge the chicken meat well with flour, and lay in (he hot 
pan ; fry a nice brown, and keep hot and dry. Take a pint of the 
chicken water, and stir in two large teaspoonfuls of curry powder, 
two of butter and one of flour, one teaspoonful of salt and a little 
cayenne ; stir until smooth, then mix it with the broth in the pot. 
"When well mixed, simmer five minutes, then add the brown chicken. 
Serve with rice. 

CLAM SOUP. 

Select five large plump clams, and after chopping them finely add 
the liquor to the meat. To every dozen allow a quart of cold water, 
and putting meat, liquor and water into a clean vessel allow them to 
simmer gently, but not boil, about one-and-a-half hours. Every 
particle of meat should be so well cooked that you seem to have only 
a thick broth. Season to taste and pour into a tureen in which a few 
slices of well-browned toast have been placed. If desired, to every 
two dozen of clams allow a teacupful of new milk and one egg. 
Beat the latter very light, add slowly the milk, beat hard a minute or 
so, and when the soup is removed from the fire stir the egg and milk 
into it. 

CELERY SOUP. 

One shank of beef, one large bunch of celery, one cup of rich 
cream. Make a good broth of a shank of beef, skim off the fat and 
thicken the broth with a little flour mixed with water. Cut into small 
pieces one large bunch of celery, or two small ones, boiling them in 
the soup till tender. Add a cup of rich cream with pepper and salt. 

EGO BALLS. 

Two hard-boiled yolks of eggs ; mix with the raw yolk of one egg a 
little flour ; roll the size of a hazel-nut. 

EGG SOUP. 
Boil a leg of lamb about two hours in water enough to cover it. 
After it has boiled about an hour and when carefully skimmed, add 
one half-cup of rice, and pepper and salt to taste. Have ready in your 
tureen two eggs well-beaten ; add the boiling soup, a little at a time, 
stirring constantly. Serve the lamb with drawn butter, garnished with 
parsley and hard-boiled eggs cut into slices. 



16 THE PEOPLE'S COOK BOOK. 

FISH CHOWDER. 

1, Take a fresh haddock, of three or four pounds, clean it well, and 
cut in pieces of three inches square. Place in the bottom of your 
dinner-pot five or six slices of salt pork, fiy brown, then add three 
onions sliced thin, and fry those brown. Remove the kettle from the 
fire, and place on the onions and pork a laj^er of fish ; sprinkle over a 
little pepper and salt, then a layer of pared and sliced potatoes, a layer of 
fish and. potatoes, till the fish is used up. Cover with water, and let 
it boil for half an hour. Povmd six biscuits or crackers fine as meal, 
and pour into the pot ; and, lastly, add a quart or pint of milk ; let it 
scald well, and serve. 

2, Take a small piece of pork, cut into squares, and put it into the 
bottom of a kettle. Then take your fish (about three pounds would 
make a good-sized chowder), cut it into pieces (larger squares than 
the pork), lay enough of this on the pork to cover well, then a layer of 
potatoes, next a layer of Boston crackers split, on this pepper and 
salt. Above this put a layer of pork, and repeat the order given above 
until the materials are all exhausted ; let the top layer be buttered 
crackers. Pour on boiling water until covered, and cover the kettle; 
keep boiling half an hour. Five minutes before dinner, dredge well 
with flour, and pour on a pint of milk. This will make the genuine 
Eyebeach fish chowder. 

T0:^L4T0 CHOTVT>ER. 
Slice a peck of green tomatoes, six green peppers, and four onions ; 
strew a teacup of salt over them. In the morning turn off the water, 
and put them in a kettle with vinegar enough to cover them, a teacup 
of sugar, one of grated horseradish, a tablespoonful of cloves, allspice, 
and cinnamon, each. Boil until soft. 

FISH SOUP. 
Slice three middling-sized onions and fry them with one ounce of 
butter till turning yellow; add three or four pounds of fish— bass, pike, 
trout, salmon, or any fish having a firm flesh ; add, also, two carrots, 
two onions sliced, a little parsley, thyme, one clove of garlic, a bay 
leaf, one clove, six pepper corns, and salt ; cover the whole with cold 
water and boil gently for two hours ; add more water, if needed ; 
strain and use. 

FRENCH VEGETABLE SOUP. 
To a leg of lamb of moderate size take four quarts of water. Of 
carrots, potatoes, onions, tomatoes, cabbage, and turnips, take a tea- 
cup each chopped fine, salt and pepper to taste. Let the lamb be 
boiled in this water. Let it cool, skim off all the fat that rises to the 
top. The next day boil again, adding the chopped vegetables. Let it 
boil three hours the second day. 

GREEN PEA SOUP. 
One peck of green peas, four tablespoonfuls of lard, heated in the 
kettle ; put in the peas and stir them until perfectly green ; add pepper 
and salt, and pour in as much water as you want soup ; boil three- 
quarters of an hour, then add one teacupful of milk, thickened with 



SOUPS. 17 

one tablespoonfol of flour ; put in the soup two or three young onions, 
cut line and fried a light brown in butter. Just as you take it up, add 
yolks of two eggs beaten in a little cream. 

GUMBO SOUP. 

Cut up a pair of good-sized chickens, as for a fricassee ; flour them 
well, and put into a pan with a good-sized piece of butter, and fry a 
nice brown ; then lay them in a soup-j)ot, pour on three quarts of 
hot water, and let them simmer slowly for two hours. Braid a little 
flour and butter together for a thickening, and stir in a little pepper 
and salt. Strain a quart or three pints of oysters, and add the juice 
to the soup. Next add four or five slices of cold boiled ham, and let 
all boil slowly together for ten minutes. Just before you take up the 
soup stir in two large teaspoonfuls of finely powdered sassafras 
leaves, and let it simmer five minutes, then add your oysters. If you 
have no ham, it is very nice without it. Serve in a deep dish, and 
garnish the dish with rice. 

PLAIN GUMBO SOUP. 

Take a piece of ham half the size of your hand, and a knuckle of 
veal ; put them into a pot with two quarts of cold water ; simmer 
slowly two or three hours, then add two quarts of boiling water. 
Twenty minutes before serving, put in one small can of okra and as 
many oysters as you please. Season to taste. 

GIBLET SOUP. 
Prepare first the vegetables, viz. : an onion, a small piece of turnip, 
and a carrot ; cut in slices, and fry in hot butter ; when hot and 
beginning to brown, dust in a tablespoonful or less of flour, and add 
the giblets, and let them all brown ; then put all into a kettle with a 
gallon and a half of water, or half water and half broth, and some 
pieces of chicken if you have them ; simmer for four or five hours ; 
season to taste, and thicken with browned flour ; serve with the yollcs 
of hard-boiled eggs, one for each person, placed in the tureen before 
pouring the soup. It will require the gilDlets of five chickens for the 
above quantity. 

GAME SOUP. 

Boast, until about one-third done, two prairie hens, and put into a 
soup kettle witli about one pound of lean beef, salt, and five pints of 
water ; set on a slow fire ; skim as needed, and add one-half a carrot,

corns ; simmer three hours, and take the birds out of the kettle ; sim- 
mer then two hours, strain and serve.

of sifted flour, with ono quart of chicken broth; in another stew-pan 
boil uj) two quarts of chicken broth, into which stir the thickening ; 
add a little salt and sugar, and one quart of fresh shelled peas jDre- 
viously weU washed; continue stirrmg with a spoon till the soup

Boil a leg of mutton from two to three hours, and season with salt, 
pepper, and about a teaspoonful of summer savory rubbed fine ; add 
rice or noodles as desired. 

TO MAKE MUTTON BROTH QUICKLY. 

One or two chops from a neck of mutton, one pint of cold water, a 
small bunch of sweet herbs, one-quarter of an onion, pepper and salt 
to taste. Cut the meat into small pieces ; put it into a saucepan with 
bones in cold water, but no skin nor fat ; add the other ingredients ; 
cover the saucepan and bring the water quickly to boil ; take the lid 
off and continue the rapid boiling for twenty minutes, skimming it 
well during the process ; strain the broth into a basin ; if there should 
be any fat left on the surface, remove it by laying a piece of thin paper 
on the top ; the greasy particles will adhere to the paper and so free 
the preparation from them. 

NOODLES FOR SOUP. 

Beat one egg light ; add a pinch of salt, and flour enough to make a 
stiff dough; roll out in a very thii> sheet, dredge with flour to keep 
from sticking, then roll up tightly. Begin at one end and shave down 
fine like cabbage for slaw. 

OKRA GUIilBO. 

Cut up one chicken, wash, dry, and flour it thoroughly ; salt and 
pepper , fry very brown in a skillet with a lump of lard large as an egg. 
Put it into your soup-kettle with five quarts of water ; add one onion 
cut up, and let it boil two hours ; add two dozen okra pods, and let it 
boil another hour. Season to taste and serve with rice. 

ONION SOUP. 

Slice two medium-sized onions and fry brown in butter with a table- 
spoonful and a half of flour ; put into a saucepan, and stir in slowly 
four or five pints of milk and water (about one-third water) ; season to 
taste, and add a teacup grated potato ; set in a kettle of boiling water 
and cook ten minutes ; add a cup of sweet cream and serve quickly. 

OX-TAIL SOUP. 

1, Take two tails, wash and put into a kettle with about one gallon 
of cold water and a little salt. Skim off the froth. When the meat is 
well cooked, take out the bones, and add a little onion, carrot, and 
tomatoes. It is better made the day before using, so that the fat can 
be taken from the top. Add vegetables next day, and boil an hour 
and a half longer. 

2. Chop the ox-tail into small pieces; set on the fire with a tablespoon- 
ful of butter, and stir until brown, and then pour off the fat ; add 
broth to taste, and boil gently until the pieces of tail are well cooked ; 
season with pepper, salt, and three or four tomatoes ; boil fifteen min- 
utes and then serve. This soup can be made with water, in which 
case season with turnip, onions, carrot, and parsley.

and add, also, one onion, into which stick three cloves ; when the vege- 
tables have he&n. in the pot two hours, add one cabbage cut in two ; 
when the contents of the pot have simmered gently four hours, remove 
the meat on to a hot dish, and garnish with the carrots, turnip, and 
parsnip, and pour over it a little of the liquor ; serve the cabbage in a 
hot vegetable dish ; strain the liquor through a colander, and put aside 
to cool ; do not remove the fat until required for use. 

TOMATO SOUP. 

1. One quart of tomatoes, one quart of milk, one pint of water ; 
boil vrater and tomatoes together twenty minutes, then add the miik

meat. When it has boiled an hour, add a few small turnips and carrots 
sliced, with a tablespoonful of salt; a little before it is served add some 
parsley. This is a favorite broth with many people. It is very nice

FISH. 

Fish when fresh are hard when pressed by the finger — the gills red 
— the eyes full. If the flesh is flabby and the eyes sunken, the fish 
are stale. They should be thoroughly cleaned, washed, and sprinkled 
with salt. 

Before broiling fish, rub the gridiron with a piece of fat, to prevent 
its sticking. Lay the skin side down first. 

The earthy taste often found in fresh-water fish can be removed by 
soaking in salt and water. 

Most kinds of salt fish should be soaked in cold water for twenty- 
four hours — the fleshy side turned down in the water. 

Fish should be fresh, and always well cooked. 

Never soak fresh fish in water, unless frozen. Clean, rinse, and 
wipe dry ; in warm weather, lay on the ice until needed. * 

In boiling, put into cold water, to which add a little salt and vine- 
gar, and allow eight minutes to the pound. If boiled whole do not 
remove the head and tail, and serve always with a sauce. 

TO FKY. 

Dredge with flour, dip lightly in beaten egg, roU in cracker crumbs, 
and fry in very hot lard. Serve with lemon slices. 

TO BKOIL. 

Eub over with olive oil ; cut in pieces or broil whole as preferred, 
over a clear, hot fire ; when done, sprinkle with pepper and salt, a 
little lemon juice, a little chopped parsley, and some melted butter. 

TO BAKE. 

Stuff with a dressing as for poultry, and sew it up ; lay strips of salt 
pork over it, sprinkle with pepper, salt, and crumbs, and bake in a 
hot oven ; baste often. 

BAKED FISH. 

Stuff it with plain dressing ; put in a pan with a little water, salt, 
pepper, and butter. Baste while baking. A fish weighing four pounds 
will bake in an hour. Garnish with hard-boiled eggs and parsley, and 
serve with drawn butter or egg sauce. 

TO BOIL FISH. 

Sew them in a cloth, and put in cold water, with plenty of salt. 
Most fish will boil in thirty minutes. 

BOILED FISH. 

Four or five pounds of fish, nearly cover with water and add two 
heaping tablespoonfuls of salt. Boil thirty minutes, and serve with 
drawn butter.

add a beaten egg. 

BAKED BLACK FISH. 

Rub a handful of salt over the surface, to remove the slime peculiar 
to the fish. For the stuffiing, two ounces of beef drippings, two 
tablespoonfuls of chopped parsley and one ounce of salt pork ; put in 
a saucepan and fry brown ; then add a tablespoonful of chopped capers, 
half a saltspoonful of white pepper, one-half teaspoonful of salt, five 
ounces of bread, and one gill of broth ; then stir until scalding hot ; 
place inside the fish ; cut a quarter of a pound of pork in thin slices 
and lay on either side of the fish, holding in place by twine wound 
around it — a generous sprinkle of salt and pepper completing it for the 
baking-pan. Bake in a hot oven one-half hour and serve on slices of 
fried bread with a sauce made of stock seasoned with one tablespoonful 
each of walnut and Worcestershire sauce, one tablespoonful of chopped 
capers and one tablespoonful of parsley. 

BROOK TROUT.

CREAM BAKED TROUT. 

Clean the trout, put in pepper and salt, and close them. Place the 
fish in the pan, with just cream enough to cover the fins and bake 
fifteen minutes. 

BAKED WHITE FISH. 

Prepare a stuffing of fine bread crumbs, a little salt pork chopped 
very fine ; season with sage, parsley, pepper, and salt. Fill the fish 
with the stuffing, sew it up, sprinkle the outside with salt, pepper, and 
bits of butter ; dredge with flour and bake one hour. Baste often. 
Serve with egg sauce or parsley sauce.

STE^VED OYSTERS. 
Take one quart of liquor oysters; put the liquor (a teacupful for 
three) in a stewpan, and add half as much more water, salt, a good bit 
of pepper, a teaspoonful of rolled cracker for each. Put on the stove, 
and let it boil; have your oysters ready in a bowl; the moment the 
liquor boils pour in all your oysters, say ten for each person, or six will 
do. Now watch carefully, and as soon as it begins to boil take out your 
watch, count just thirty seconds, take your oysters from the stove. You 
will have your big dish ready, with one and a half tablespoonf uls of 
cream or milk for each person. Pour your stew on this, and serve im-

MEATS. 

In selecting beef, choose that of a fine smooth grain, of a bright red 
color and white fat. 

The sixth, seventh, and eighth ribs, are the choicest cuts for a roast. 
Have the bones removed and the meat rolled, but have the butcher 
send the bones for soup. 

The flesh of good veal is firm and dry, and the joints stiff. 

The flesh of good mutton or lamb is a bright red, with the fat firm 
and white. 

If the meat of pork is young, the lean will break on being pinched; 
the fat will be white, soft, and pulpy. 

KuLES FOB Boiling Meat. — All fresh meat should be put to cook in 
boiling water, then the outer part contracts and the internal juices are 
preserved. For making soup, put on in cold water. All salt meat 
should be put on in cold water, that the salt may be extracted in cook- 
ing. In boiling meats, it is important to keep the water constantly 
boiling, otherwise the meat will absorb the water. Be careful to 
add boiling water, if more is needed. Remove the scum when 
it first begins to boil. Allow about twenty minutes for boiling 
for each pound of fresh meat. The more gently meat boils, the more 
tender it will be. 

To Bboil Meat well, have your gridiron hot before you put the meat 
on. 

Bboiling. — This is not only the most rapid manner of cooking meat, 
but is justly a favored one. It has nearly the same effect upon meat 
as roasting. The albumen of the outer portions is hardened, and, 
forming a skin, retains the juices. It should be turned rapidl}^ in 
order to produce an equal effect, but the meat should not be punc- 
tured with a fork. 

Salt meat should be put into cold water and boil slowly. 

A red pepper dropped into the water will prevent the rising of an 
unpleasant odor. 

Fresh meat, unless for soup, should be put into boiling water, and bo 
allowed to cook very gently; no salt to be added until nearly done. 

In Roasting — Put into a hot oven, and baste frequently. 

In Roasting Beef, it is necessary to have a brisk fire. Baste often. 
Twelve minutes is required for every pound of beef. Season when 
nearly done. 

BEEFSTEAK. 

"Farmer" Olcott, in the Hartford Coitranf, writes: "It is sometimes 
more convenient for the cook to get the beefsteak done tender without 



32 THE PEOPLE'S COOK BOOK. 

watching. I remember catching a Sacramento cook broiling his beef in 
the oven. No cook ought to be hnng for treating a steak to a hot oven 
when the other conveniences are limited, but a friend tells me of a 
better way that I think is original with him. He smothers the steak 
in corn meal and so bakes it, declaring that if there is any way of 
making a tough steak tender, that is it." 

BOILED TONGUE. 

In choosing a tongue, ascertain how long it has been dried or pickled, 
and select one with a smooth skin, which denotes its being young and 
tender; if a dried one, and rather hard, soak it at least for twelve 
hours jDrevious to cooking it; if, however, it is fresh from the pickle, 
two or three hours will be sufdcient for it to remain in soak; put the 
tongue into a stew-pan with plenty of cold water and a bunch of savory 
herbs; let it gradually come to a boil, skim well, and simmer very 
gently until tender; peel olf the skin, garnish with i,afts of cauliiiower 
or Brussels sprouts, and serve; boiled tongue is frequently sent to 
table with boiled poultry instead of ham, and is by many persons, pre- 
ferred; if to serve cold, peel it, fasten it down to a piece of board by 
sticking a fork through the root and another through the top to 
straighten it; when cold glaze it, and put a paper rucne round the root, 
and garnish with tufts of parsley; cook a large smoked tongue four to 
four and a half hours, a small one tNvo and a half to three hours, a 
large un soaked tongue three to three and a half hours, a small one, 
two to two and a half hours. 

BEOILED HAM AND EGGS. 
Cut the ham in thin slices, take off the rind, wash the slices in cold 
water, and lay them on the gridiron over quick coals; turn frequently, 
and they will soon be broiled; take them \x\) on a platter, previously 
warmed, butter and pepper the ham; have ready oq the fire a pan of 
boiling water from the teakettle; break into it as many e^s as you re- 
quire for the meal, and,when the "white" is done, dip out each egg 
carefully with a spoon, so as to keep it whole, and set it on one of the 
slices of ham; after all are arranged, sprinkle pepper over each egg 
and serve. 

BEEF HASH. 

Chop fine cold steak or roast beef, and cook in a little water; add 
cream or milk, and thicken with flour; season to taste, and pour over 
thin slices of toast. 

BEEF STEYv^ 

Cut cold beef into small piecei, and put into cold water; add one 
tomato, a little onion, chopped fine, pepper, and salt, and cook slowly; 
thicken with butter and flour, and pour over toast. 

BEEF A-LA-MODE. 
Take a round of beef, remove the bone from the middle, also all the 
gristle and tough parts about the edges. Have ready half a pound of 
fat salt pork. Cut into strips as thick and long as your finger. Pre- 
pare a nice dressing the same as for stuffing a turkey. With a thin 



MEATS. " 33 

sharp knife make perpendicular incisions in the meat about half an 
inch apart. Thrust into them the pork and work in with them some 
of the dressing. Proceed thus until the meat is thoroughly plugged. 
Put it into a baking pan with a little water at the bottom, cover 
tightly and bake slowly four hours; then uncover and spread the rest 
of the dressing over the top, and bake until a nice brown. After 
taking up, thicken the gravy and pour over the beef. It should be 
sliced horizontally. Is good either hot or cold. 

BOILEAU. 

Take a piece of beef weighing six or eight pounds, have the bone 
taken out; then rub it well with a mixture composed of ground cloves, 
allspice, black pepper, sweet marjoram, and salt, one teaspoonful of 
each rubbed fine. After the mixture is well rubbed in, roll it up 
tightly and tie it; put it into a pot half full of water, with three or 
four potatoes, a carrot, two turnips, if small, and two onions, and let 
it stew six houss. 

BKEAKFAST DISH. 
Chop fine as much cold beef or mutton as is required ; add a pint, 
more or less of good soup stock; season with pepper, salt, and ground 
cloves; thicken with browned flour and pour boiling hot over little 
bits of nicely-toasted bread. Garnish with slices of le^aori and serve 
at once. 

CKOQUETTES. 
Eaw pork chopped fine, two cups; one medium-sized onion, chopped 
fine; teaspoonful powdered sage; one cup bread, soaked until soft; 
salt and pepper to taste; two eggs beaten light; mix thoroughly into 
small flat cakes; roll in flour or crumbs, and fry in hot lard. 

CORNED BEEF. 

1. Put into cold water enough to cover well, and place where it will 
cook very slowly for three or four hours; if to be used cold, simmer 
until the bones can be easily removed, and then press in a square 
mold. 

2. Select a nice piece of fresh beef; rub over sufficient salt to 
" corn" it, but not to make it very salt; let it stand two or three days, 
judging of the time by the size of the meat; then wash thoroughly in 
cold water, and putting in the pot, cover with cold water and boil 
gently till quite tender; add such "v-egetables as are desired, like the 
old time-honored "boil dish;" judge of the quantity of vegetables by 
the strength of flavor desired in the soup to be made from the 
water in which the whole is boiled; when done, dish beef and vegeta- 
bles, and serve hot. 

DEVILED BEEF. 
Take slices of cold roast beef, lay them on hot coals and broil; season 
■with pepper and salt, and serve while hot, with a small lump of butter 
on each piece. 



34 THE PEOPLE'S COOK BOOK. 

DRIED BEEF IN CREAM. 

Shave your beef very fine; pour over it boiling water; let it stand 
for a few minutes; pour this ofi: and pour on good rich cream; let it 
come to a boil. If you have not cream, use milk and butter, and 
thicken with a very little flour; season with pepper, and serve on toast 
or not, as you like. 

FRIZZLED BEEF. 
Shave beef very fine; put into a frying pan when good and hot; put 
in the beef and shake and stir until heated through; season with pep- 
per; serve in this way, or just before serving beat one egg light and 
stir in. 

PRESSED BEEF. 
Cure a piece of brisket with salt and pulverized saltpetre for five 
days; boil gently until tender; press until perfectly cold. 

BEEF TONGUE. 

If it is corned it should be soaked for twenty-four hours before 
boiling. It wiU require from three to four hours, according to 
size. The skin should always be removed as soon as it is taken from 
the pot. An economical method is to lay the tongue, as soon as the 
skin is removed, in a jar, coiled up, with the tip outside the root, and 
a weight upon it. When it is cold, loosen the sides with a knife and 
turn it out. The slices being cut horizontally aU round, the fat and 
lean will go together. 

SAVORY BEEF. 

Take a shin of beef from the hind quarter, saw it into four pieces, 
put it into a pot and boil it until the meat and gristle drop from the 
bones; chop the meat very fine, put it in a dish and season it with a 
little salt, pepper, clove, and sage to your taste; pour in the liquor in 
which the meat was boiled and place it away to harden. Cut in slices 
and eat cold. 

SCRAMBLED EGGS WITH BEEF. 

Dried beef chipped very fine; put butter and lard into a skiUet, and 
when hot put in the beef; heat for a few minutes, stirring to prevent 
burning; break up some eggs into a bowl; season and stir in and cook 
a few minutes. 

YORKSHIRE PUDDING TO SERVE WITH ROAST BEEF. 
Three eggs well beaten, to which add nine table spoonfuls of flour, a 
small teaspooaful of salt, and beat up with milk until about the con- 
sistency of thick cream. This batter pour into a pan in which the 
beef has been roasted, having enough grease (which must be hot) to 
bake it. Bake in a quick oven. 

BEEFSTEAK SMOTHERED WITH ONIONS. 
Put in the skillet a little lard and the steak; peel and slice the onions 
and lay them over the meat till the skillet is full; season with pepper 
and ssJt, cover tightly and place over the fire. After the juice of the 



MEATS. 35 

onions has boiled away and the meat begins to fry, remove the onions, 
turn the meat to brown on the other side, then replace the onions as 
before, being careful that they do not burn. 

CHOPPED STEAK, 
Take a sirloin steak raw, remove the bone and all gristle or stringy 
pieces, and chop until a perfect mince; season with salt and pepper; 
make into a large flat cake about one-half of an inch thick; put into a 
skillet a good-sized piece of butter and when quite hot put in the steak, 
and fry brown on both sides. Make a little gravy in the skillet and 
pour over the meat. This is a nice way to use the ends from tender- 
loin steaks. The meat can not be chopped too fine. 

STUFFED BEEFSTEAK. 

Take a rump steak about an inch thick; make a stuffing of bread, 
herbs, etc., and spread it over the steak. KoU it up, and with a needle 
and coarse thread sew it together. Lay it in an iron pot on one or two 
wooden skewers, and put in water just sufficient to cover it. Let it 
stew slowly for two hours; longer if the beef is tough; serve it in a 
dish with the gravy turned over it. To be carved crosswise, in slices, 
through beef and stuffing. 

BEEFSTEAK WITH OYSTEES. 
Broil a sirloin or tenderloin steak; season; take one quart of oysters, 
drain off aU the liquor, put them into the stew-pan with half of a small 
cupful of butter, or less butter and a little sweet cream ; let them boil, 
and turn them over the steak on the platter. Oysters broiled and laid 
on the steak are very nice. 

STEAK AND OYSTEES. 

Take one pound best rump steak without any fat; put in an oval dish 
a dozen and a half oysters (taking care to remove the hard part and 
beard), with the liquor from the oysters to cover them; put the steak 
on them, cover the top of the steak with two onions cut in the thinnest 
possible manner; put another dish inverted over the steak, then put a 
paste round the edge of both dishes and put this into a gentle oven for 
an hour. Eeverse the dishes for five minutes, then take ofiE the dish 
which was originally at the top, and serve. 

BEOILED BEEFSTEAK. 

Have the choice steaks cut three-quarters of an inch thick; grease the 
gridiron and have it quite hot. Put the steak over a hot, clear fire 
and cover. When the steak is colored turn it over, which must be 
done without sticking a fork into it and thus letting out the juice. It 
should be quite rare or pink in the center, but not raw. When cooked 
sufficiently, lay on a hot platter and season with pepper and salt, and 
spread over the top some small bits of butter, and serve immediately. 

MOCK DUCK. 

Take a round steak; make stuffing as for turkey; spread the stuffing 
on the steak, roU it up and tie it; roast from half to three-quarters of 
an hour. 



36 THE PEOPLE'S COOK BOOK. 

EOAST VEAL.

veal with salt, jDepper, and a little butter; put it into a pan witiia little 
water. While roasting baste frequently', letting it cook until thorough- 
ly done, allowing two hours for a roast weighing from six to eight 
pounds. When done remove the threads before sending to the table; 
thicken the gravy with a little flour. 

FILLET OF TE.KL (EOASTED IN TEE POT). 
Eemove the bone and fill the cavity with a force-meat made of bread 
crumbs, a very little salt pork chopped fine, sage, pepper, salt, and 
ground cloves. Lay in the pot a layer of slices of salt pork, put in the 
fillet, fastc^ned with skewers, cover in the same manner, pour over a 
pint of good stock, cover down close and let it cook slowly tv/o or three 
hours, then take ofE the cover, let it brown, and serve. 

VEAL CUTLETS. 

1. Take one egg and beat it a little, roll the cutlet in it, then cover 
with rolled crackers. Have a lump of butter and lard mixed, hot in the 
BkiUet, put in the meat and cook slowly. When nicely broM-ned on 
both sides stir in one tablespoonf ul of flour for gravy ; add half joint of 
sweet milk and let it come to a boil. Season to taste and pour over the 
meat or serve in a separate dish as preferred. 

2. Cut in nice pieces, season, dip in egg, then in bread crumbs, with 
a little lemon and parsley chopped fine. Have j)lenty of grease in your 
pan, hot; fry brown on one side, then turn over. Make a rich brown 
gravy in another vessel and serve. Garnish with parsley and lemon. 

VEAL CUTLETS BROILED. 

1. Broil them on a moderate fire, basting them occasionally with 
butter and turning them often. Serve with tomato sauce. 

2. Trim evenly; sprinkle salt and pepper on both sides, dip in 
melted butter, and place upon the gridiron over a clear fire; baste while 
broiling with melted butter, turning over three or four times; serve 
with melted butter sauce or tomato sauce. 

VEAL. 

Cut two pounds of veal into thin pieces; roll wdth flour, and fry 
with hot lard; when nearly done, add one and a half pints of oysters; 
season, thicken with a little flour; serve hot. 

VEAL CUTLETS BAKED. 

Take cutlets and trim nicely; mix half a pound of sausage meat with 
two eggs; lay a buttered paper on the bottom of the dripping-pan, and 
cover with half the sausage meat, and then lay on it the cutlet, and 
cover with the remainder of the sausage meat; baste with melted but- 
ter and veal stock, and serve wdth the gravy when done, 

VEAL CUTLETS. 
Pound and season, cut the outer edges, and beat into good shape; 



MEATS. 37 

take one egg, beat it a little, roll the cutlet in it, then cover thoroughly 
with rolled crackers. Have a lump of butter and lard mixed hot in 
your skillet; put in the meat, and cook slowly; when nicely browned 
on both sides, stir in one teaspoonful of Hour for the gravy, add half 
a pint of sweet milk, and let it come to a boil; salt and pepper. 

PATE DE VEAU. 

Of veal three and one -half pounds of fat and lean, a slice of 
snlt pork about one-half pound, six small crackers powdered very line, 
two eggs, a bit of butter the size of an egg, one lablespoonful of 
salt, one of cayenne pepper, one of black nr white iJepper, one grated 
nutmeg. Chop the meat ail very line, and mix the ingredients thor- 
oughlj', put it in a dripping-pan with a little water, make it into a loaf 
pyramidical or round from a bowl. Bake about two hours, basting it 
constantly. Leave it to get cold, and slice as head-cheese. A very 
palatable and convenient lunch or tea relish. 

VEAL SCALLOP. 
Chop some cold roast or stewed veal very fine; put a layer on the 
bottom of a pudding- dish, well buttered. Season with pepper and salt. 
Next have a layer of fine powdered crackers; wet with a little milk or 
some of the gravy from the meat. Proceed until the dish is full. Spread 
over all a thick layer of cracker crumbs, seasoned with salt, and wet into 
a paste with milk and two beaten eggs. Stick bits of butter all over it, 
cover closely, and bake half an hour; then remove the cover, and bake 
long enough to brown nicely. Do not get it too dry. 

VEAL STEAKS. 
Beat them until tender, then broil over clear hot coals until a nice 
brown on both sides; season with salt, pepper, and butter; send to the 
table while hot. A gravy made by stewing in a little hot water some 
bits of veal, with a few oysters or mushrooms, seasoned, and poured 
over the steak, is very nice. 

STEWED VEAL. 

Break the shank bone, wash it clean, and put into two quarts of water 
an onion, peeled, a few blades of mace, and a little salt; set it over a 
quick fire, and remove the scum as it rises; wash carefully a quarter of 
a pound of rice, and when the veal has cooked for about an hour skim 
it well, and throw in the rice. Simmer for three-quarters of an hour 
slowly. When done put the meat into a deep dish, and the rice around 
it. Mix a little drawn butter, stir in some chopped parsley, and pour 
over the veal.

in lumps of the pounded tongue; put in another layer of veal, and 
again more tongue; press it down, and pour clarified butter on top. 
This cuts very prettily like veined marble. White meat of fowls may be 
used instead of veal. 



38 THE PEOPLE'S COOK BOOK. 

A GOOD PEEPAKATION OF VEAL. 

1. The following is an excellent mode of preparing veal to be eaten 
cold, and for keeping it on hand for several days, ready for immediate 
use: Take say three and a half pounds — the thick part of the leg is 
preferable, with the tough, tendenous parts removed— chop it fine with- 
out cooking; mix well with it four soda crackers rolled fine, three well- 
beaten eggs, one tablespoonful of salt, one tablespoonful of pepper, 
half a nutmeg, two tablespoonfuls of cream, or a small piece of butter; 
make it into a loaf, and bake in a dripping-pan without water, with 
quick heat at first, to close the outside and retain ihe juices, and con- 
tinue the baking about one and a quarter to one and a half hours; serve 
cut in thin slices; an excellent lunch in traveling. 

2, Butter a good-sized bowl, and line it with thin slices of hard- 
boiled eggs ; have veal and ham both in very thin slices ; place in the bowl 
a layer of veal, with pepper and salt, then a layer of ham, omitting the 
salt, then a layer of veal, and so on, alternating with veal and ham, 
until the bowl is filled; make a paste of flour and water, as stiff as it 
can be rolled out; cover the contents of the bowl with the paste, and 
over this tie a double cotton cloth; put the bowl into a saucepan, or 
other vessel, with water just up to the rim of the bowl, and boil three 
hours; then take it from the fire, remove the cloth and paste, and let 
it stand until the next day, when it may be turned out and served in 
very thin slices. 

PRESSED VEAL OR CHICKEN. 
Put four pounds of veal, or two chickens in a pot; cover with water, 
stew slowly until the meat drops from the bone, then take out and 
chop it; let the liquor boil down until there is a cupful; put in a small 
cup of butter, a tablespoonful of pepper, a little allspice, and a beaten 
egg; stir this through the meat; slice a hard-boiled egg; lay in your 
mold, and press in the meat; when put upon the table garnish with 
celery tops or parsley. 

SANDWICHES. 
Chop cold boiled ham very fine, and mix it with the yolks of eggs 
(beaten), a little mustard and pepper, and spread on very thin slices 
of bread, buttered on the loaf; trim off the crust, and cut into neat 
squares. 

MINCED LIVER. 

Cut liver into small pieces and fry with salt pork; cut both into 
square bits, nearly cover with water, add pepper and a little lemon 
juice; thicken the gravy with fine bread crumbs, and serve, 

VEAL CROQUETTES. 
Mince veal fine, mix one-half cup of milk with one teaspoonful of 
flour, a piece of butter the size of an egg; cook until it thickens; stir 
into the meat; roll into balls; dip in egg, with a little milk stirred in, 
roll in brown bread crumbs; fry in hot lard. 



MEATS. 39 

VEAL CHEESE. 

Take equal quantities of sliced boiled veal and sliced boiled tongue.

lunch. 

VEAL HASH. 

Take a teacupful of boiling water in a saucepan, stir into it an even 
teaspoonful of flour wet in a tablespoonful of cold water, amd let it 
boil five minutes, add one-half teaspoon of black pepper, as much 
salt, and two tablespoonfuls of butter, and let it keep hot, but not boil. 
Chop the veal fine and mix with half as much stale bread crumbs. 
Put into a pan and pour the gravy over it, then let simmer ten minutes. 
Serve this on buttered toast. 

CALF'S LIVEE STEWED. 

Cut the liver into small slices, about three inches square. Into 
your saucepan place two onions, sliced fine, a tablespoonful of sage, 
one of summer savory, a little pepper, and salt; then add your liver, 
and cover with water, and let it stew for two hours. Just before you 
serve it, dredge on a little flour, and add a tablespoonful of butter, 

TO DEESS CALF'S HEAD LIKE TUETLE. 

Let them boil an hour and a half, with salt in the water; tie the 
brains in a cloth bag, and boil half an hour; when all is done, take out 
the bones and cut in pieces. Add to your liquor a little sweet mar- 
joram, a nutmeg grated, clove, mace, and pepper, to taste, half a pint

in salt and water (a tablespoonful of salt to one quart of water) till 
very tender. The next day cut into smaller pieces, season with salt 
and pepper, dredge with flour, fry brown on both sides in a pan of hot 
lard. When done, take it out, pour nearly all the lard out, add a good 
gill of boiling water, thicken with flour mixed smooth with a table- 
spoon of vinegar; season to taste, and pour hot over the tripe. A nice 
breakfast dish. 

SPICED TRIPE. 
Take fresh tripe, cut it into pieces four or five inches square, put a 
layer of the tripe in an earthen jar, then sprinkle a few cloves, all- 
spice, and whole pepper over it; then another laj^er of tripe, then 
spice, and so on, until the jar is fall; cover it up and let it stand away 
in a cold place for a few days, until it tastes of the spice. Serve up 
cold. 

BALTIMORE MEAT PIE. 
Pare two pounds of potatoes, cover them with hot water, and let 
them simmer till done; mash them and add a little cream and salt; lay 
them in the style of paste in a dish; place on thin slices of underdone 
meat, either mutton, beef, or veal; lay them in thickly; pour over them 
some gravy, a wineglass of ketchup, then cover thick with mashed 
potatoes, and bake moderately for about forty minutes. 

CROQUETTE. 

Take cold veal, chicken, or sweetbreads, a little of each, or sepa- 
rately, cut very fine a little fat and lean of ham, half the quantity of 
the whole of bread crumbs, two eggs, butter the size of an egg, pep- 
per, salt, and a little mustard. Knead like sausage meat, adding a lit- 
tle cream; form in any shape, dip in egg, and tUen roll in cracker 
crumbs; fry in lard until a light brown. Dry them in the oven. Celery 
or mushrooms are an improvement. 

]MEAT RISSOLES. 
Chop fine the cold meat, carefully excluding every particle of fat, 
skin, and outside; pound in a mortar with a small piece of butter, 



MEATS. 41 

adding pepper, salt, and powdered fine herbs; moisten with stock; put 
this into a pan on the fire and take off as soon as hot; stir in the yolk 
of an egg beaten up with a little lemon juice, and put the mixture by 
to cool; make a paste of six ounces of liour, two ounces of butter, a 
pinch of salt, the yolks of two eggs, and a little water; roll it out, and 
cut it into small squares; put the meat in the center, and paste the 
corners over, pressing them well down ; fry in hot lard, and serve with 
parsley. 

BREADED LAMB CHOPS. 
Grate plenty of stale bread, season with salt and pepper, have ready 
some well-beaten egg, have a spider with hot lard ready, take the chops 
one by one, dip into the egg, then into the bread crumbs, repeat it, as 
it will be found an improvement, then lay separately into the boiling 
lard, fry brown, and then turn. To be eaten with currant jelly or 
grape ketchup. 

CUTLETS A-LA-DUCHESSE. 

Cut the neck of lamb, about two pounds, into cutlets, trim them and 
scrape the top of the bone clean, fry in butter and set away to cool. Put a 
piece of butter into a stew pan with three mushrooms and a sprig of 
parsley, chop fine, stir over the fire until very hot; then pour over a 
cupful of white sauce— the yolks of three or four eggs well beaten. 
Stir constantly until as thick as cream, but do not let it boil. Dip 
each cutlet into it, covering thickly with the sauce, again set away to 
cool. Then egg and bread-crumb them. Fry lightly. 

TO FRY LAMB STEAKS. 
Dip each piece into well-beaten egg, cover with bread crumbs or 
corn meal, and fry in butter or new lard. Mashed potatoes and boiled 
rice are a necessary accompaniment. It is very nice to thicken the 
gravy with flour and butter, adding a little lemon juice, and pour it 
hot upon the steaks, and place the rice in spoonfuls around the dish 
to garnish it. 

SPICED LAMB (COLD). 
Boil a leg of lamb, adding to the water a handful of cloves and two 
or three sticks of cinnamon broken up. Boil four hours. 

STEWED LAMB CHOPS. 

Cut a loin of lamb into chops, cover with water and stew them 
until tender, keeping well covered except when skimming. When 
done season with salt and pepper, and thicken the gravy with a little 
flour, stirred until smooth, with a piece of butter the size of a walnut. 
Have pieces of bread previously toasted, and pour the stew over them. 

MUTTON CHOPS. 

1. Trim neatly, season, and dip each chop into a beaten egg, and then 
in cracker-crumbs; put into the oven in a dripping-pan, with tAvo 
spoonfuls of butter and a little water; baste frequently, and bake until 
well browned. 

2. Have them trimmed from fat and skin; dip each one into beaten 



42 THE PEOPLE'S COOK BOOK. 

egg, then in pounded cracker, and fry in hot lard or dripping. It is 
still better to bake them very slowly in the oven 

HAKICOT MUTTON. 
Loin chop fried until brown, dredge with flour, put into boiling 
■water, or, if you have it, weak soup ; cut carrots into small pieces, then 
simmer for two hours. Season with pepper and salt. Steak cooked 
in the same way is very nice. 

CAPTAIN CHIKAZ KAGOUT. 

Brown four tablespoonfuls of flour in a pot, then add a piece of but- 
ter the size of a walnut, with as much water as will make it the con- 
sistency of cream, and stir well. Cut up the meat — two pounds of lamb 
or mutton — not fine, but into pieces an inch or more in thickness and 
length, one-half teaspoonful of black pepper, a pinch of cayenne, with 
salt to taste, then add one and a half pints of boiling water, and stir 
well. Then one dozen and a half of large tomatoes peeled and chopped 
up, four carrots sliced lengthwise, three onions, and one dozen pota- 
toes. Boil slowly for three hours. 

lEISH STEW. 
Take mutton chops, cover weU with water, and let them come to a 
boil; pour this off and add more water; then a lump of butter the size 
of an egg, two tablespoonfuls of flour, one teacupf ul of milk, season ; 
potatoes, and two smaU onions. Boil until the potatoes are done. 

KAGOUT. 

1. Take three pounds of veal from the neck or breast, and cut into 
small pieces, and fry in butter or dripping a light brown; remove from 
the pan, and to the butter add a tablespoonf ul of flour ; cook a few 
minutes; then add two cups of warm water, one onion, a sprig each of 
thyme and parsley, a carrot, sliced, salt and pepper, then the meat, 
and cover; when done, place the meat on the dish; strain with gravy 
around it, and garnish with small onions fried. 

2. Take pieces of mutton, veal, beef, or rabbit, cut into any size and 
and shape desired; heat a tablespoonf ul of drippings or lard in a sauce- 
pan, and when hot, fry the meat until almost done. Take out the 
meat and add a tablespoonful of flour, brown it, add a little lukewarm 
water, mix it well and then add a quart of boiling water, season with 
salt and cayenne pepper, add the meat, three or four onions, and six 
or seven potatoes — partially boiled before being put into the ragout; 
cover closely and stew until the vegetables are done. Take out the 
meat and vegetables and skim off all the fat from the gravy, season 
more, if necessary, and pour over the ragout and serve. 

A KAGOUT OF COLD VEAL. 

Cut the veal into slices, put a large piece of butter into a frying-pan, 
and as soon as it is hot, dredge the meat well with flour, and fry a nice 
brown. Kemove the meat, and put into the pan as much of your cold 
gravy as you think proper, season with pepper and salt, and a wine 
glass of tomato ketchup; then cut a few slices of cold ham, lay into the 
gravy, and add your sUces of veal. It must be sent to the table hot. 



MEATS, 43 

BAKED HAM. 

A ham of sixteen ponnds to be boiled three hours, then skin and 
rub in half a pound of brown sugar, cover with bread crumbs and bake 
two hours. 

POKE STEAKS, BROILED. 

Trim, season, and roU them in melted butter and bread crumbs; 
broil them over a moderate fire until thoroughly done. Make a sauce 
of five tablespoonfuls of vinegar and half a teacupful of stock; let it 
boil, and thicken with a little flour. Strain, and then add pepper and 
some pickles chopped fine. 

ROAST PORK. 

Select either the leg, loin, fillet, or shoulder for roasting. Make a 
stufiing as for turkey, or a stuffing seasoned with onion and sage. If 
the skin is left on it should be cut into small squares; otherwise sprinkle 
it with powdered sage. Baste frequently; and allow twenty minutes 
for each pound. 

HAM AND EGGS. 

Cut the ham into thin slices and broil, and spread over it a little but- 
ter. Poach the eggs in salted water, and lay neatly upon the ham. 

BOILED HAM. 

Soak twenty-four hours; put into a pot with cold water and boil 
gently for five or six hours; take it ofE the fire and let it remain in the 
water until cold. Peel off the skin and sprinkle with bread or cracker 
crumbs, and brown in the oven. Slice very thin for the table. 

HAM BALLS. 

Take one-half cupful of bread crumbs and mix with two eggs well 
beaten; chop fine some bits of cold boiled ham and mix with them. 
Make into balls and fry. 

HAM TOAST. 

Boil one-fourth of a pound of lean ham, mix with the yolks of three 
eggs, well beaten, one ounce of butter, two tablespoons of cream, a 
little cayenne pepper, stir over the fire until it thickens. Spread on 
hot toast. 

PIGS' FEET HASH. 

Singe and scrape the feet, then wash clean and put them into salt 
and water to soak over night, or for several hours, then scrape again 
until they are perfectly clean, and boil them till the meat falls from the 
bones, chop with a knife, season with salt and pepper; pack in a crock, 
and if the weather be cool it wiU keep some time. It can be sliced and 
eaten cold, or put into a skillet and fried until brown. 

PIG'S HEAD. 

Have the head nicely cleaned, and boil it till \erj tender. Chop it 

very fine, and season with salt, pepper, sage, and a little clove, 

while hot. Put in a deep dish, and cover with a plate that is smaller 

than the dish, that it may rest on the meat. Place on the plate a very 



44 THE PEOPLE'S COOK BOOK. 

heavy weight, and let it stand for twenty-four hours. This makes the 
famous "Pig's Head Cheese." 

PORK AND BEANS. 

Take two pounds of side pork, not too fat nor too lean, to two quarts 
of marrowfat beans; put the beans to soak the night before you boil 
them in a gallon of milk-warm water. After breakfast scald and scrape 
the rind of the pork, and put on to boil an hour before putting in the 
beans; as soon as the beans boil up pour off the water, and put on one 
gallon of fresh \vater; boil until quite tender, adding more water if nec- 
essary; great care must be taken that they do not scorch. When 
nearlj- as stiff as mashed potatoes put into a baking dish, score the 
pork, and put in the center; brown in the oven one hour. If pre- 
ferred, use corned beef instead of pork. 

BOSTON BAKED BEANS. 
Put a quart of beans to soak over night; in the morning pour off the 
water, and add fresh water enough to cover, to which add about one 
tablespoonful of molasses. Put a small piece of salt pork in ine cen- 
ter, almost covering it with the beans, and bake slowly from six to 
eight hours, adding hot water as needed until nearly done, when they 
can be allowed to cook nearly dry, or according to taste. 

TO FEY APPLES AND PORK CHOPS. 
Season the chops with salt and pepper, and a little powdered sage and 
sweet marjoram; dip them into beaten egg, and then into beaten bread 
crumbs. Fry about twenty minutes, or until they are done. Put them 
on a hot dish; j)our off part of the gravy into another pan, to make a 
gravy to serve with them, if you choose. Then fry apples, which you 
have sliced about two-thirds of an inch thick, cutting them around the 
apple, so that the core is in the center of each piece. When they are 
browned on one side and partly cooked, turn them carefully with a 
pancake turner, and let them finish cooking; dish around the choirs, or 
on a separate dish. 

SPARE RIBS BROILED. 

Crack the bones, and broil over a clear fire, taking care that the fire 
is not hot enough to scorch them. 

ROAST LAMB. 

Choose a hind quarter of lamb, stuff it with fine bread crumbs, pep- 
per, salt, butter, and a little sage. Sew the flap firmly to keep it in 
place, rub the outside with salt, pepper, butter, a little of the stuffing, 
and roast two hours. Eat with mint sauce. 

MUTTON A-LA-\TENISON. 

Take a fat loin, remove the kidney, and let it hang a week, if the 
weather permits. Two days before dressing it for cooking take ground 
allspice, clove, and pepper, mix them, and rub into the meat a table- 
spoonful of each twice a day for two days, Before cooking wash it off, 
and roast as a leg. To preserve the fat and keep it in, make a paste of 



MEATS. 45 

flour and water, and spread thickly over the meat. Over this tie a 
double sheet of coarse paper, well buttered. About a quarter of an 
hour before it is done remove the paper and paste, return to the oven, 
and baste and dredge with flour. It is equal to venison. 

BOILED LEG OF MUTTON. 
Put on in boiling water, with a little salt; boil two hours and a half; 
make a sauce of melted butter; a piece of butter the size of an egg, 
stir with a tablespoonful of flour well, then stir into a pint of boiling 
water, with a tablespoonful of capers. Put into a sauce-tureen on the 
table, and garnish the dish with boiled cauliflower and parsley. 

BEEAST OF MUTTON AND GEEEN PEAS. 

Select a breast of mutton, not too fat, cut it into smaU, square pieces, 
dredge it with flour, and fry it a fine hrown in butter; add pepper and 
salt, cover it with water, and set it over a slow fire to stew, until the 
meat is perfectly tender. Take out the meat, skim off all the fat from 
the gravy, and just before serving add a quart of young peas, pre- 
viously boiled with the strained gravy, and let the whole boil gently 
until the peas are done. 

SWEET-BREADS. 
Take two large parboiled sweet-breads, put into a stewpan with one 
and one-half gills of water, season with salt, black and cayenne pepper, 
put over a slow fire. Mix one large tablespoonful of browned flour 
with a piece of butter, stir butter and gravy well together. After stew- 
ing slowly for half an hour set the j)an in a quick oven, and when 
nicely browned place in a dish, pour the gra\'y into one-half pint 
stewed tomatoes, thicken with one dessertspoonful of flour, butter, 
salt, and pepper, strain through a sieve into stewpan, let it come to 
a boil, stir till done, pour over the sweet-bread, and send to the table 
hot. 

SWEET-BREADS BROILED. 
Parboil, after soaking in salt and water, then rub weU with butter, 
and broil. Turn often, and dip into melted butter, to prevent them 
from becoming hard and dry. 

SWEET-BREADS FRIED. 

Wash in salt and water, parboil, cut into pieces the size of a large 
oyster, season, dip in rolled cracker crumbs, and fry a light brown in 
lard and butter. 

SWEET-BREADS STEWED. 

Wash, remove all the bits of skin, soak in salt and water one hour, 
then parboil; when half cooked take from the fire, cut into small 
pieces, stew in a little water till tender, add a piece of butter, a tea- 
spoonful of salt, a teaspoonful of flour, and boil up once. Serve on 
toast very hot. Another way is to prepare as above and serve with 
tomato sauce. 



46 THE PEOPLE'S COOK BOOK. 

TRAVELING LUNCH. 

Sardines chopped fine, also a little ham, a small quantity of chopped 
pickles, mix with mustard, pepper, ketchup, salt, and vinegar; spread 
between bread nicely buttered! To be hke jelly cake, cut in slices 
crossways. 

SWEET-BREAD* FRITTERS. 
Parboil the sweet-breads; cut into small pieces, and season with salt, 
pepper, and parsley; dip into batter, and fry in hot lard. 

TO BROIL SWEET-BREADS. 

Soak an hour in salt and water; drain; parboil, then rub well in but- 
ter, and broil ; turn often, and each time they are turned roll them in a 
plate of hot melted butter, so they need not become hard and dried. 

STEWED TRIPE. 

Five pounds of tripe cut in small slices and fried in a half-pound of 
lard; put in the tripe and let it cook a little, then add a cup of vinegar, 
a bowl of beef broth, salt, pepper, and three tablespoonfuls of flour; 
mix the whole, and let it stew about fifteen minutes; this is the English 
method, but I have a simpler and more delicate way of cooking tripe, 
which I prefer : Take three pounds of fresh tripe, cut it in pieces 
about three inches square; cut u]3 about three good-sized onions in thin 
slices; place tripe and onions (after washing the former) in warm water, 
and^let it stew gently until the tripe is tender; then simmer away all 
the water; add unskimmed milk thickened with flour, butter size of an 
egg, a trifle of pepper and a little salt; when the thickened milk is well 
boiled, dish up for the table. 

BEEF HEART. 

Wash it carefully and stufE it nicely, with dressing as for turkey; 
roast it about one and a half hours, and serve with the gravy, which 
should be thickened with some of the stufi&ng. It is very nice hashed. 

MEAT CROQUETTES. 

Use cold roast beef, chop it fine, season with pepper and salt, and 
one-third the quantity of bread crumbs, and moisten with a little milk; 
have your hands floured, rub the meat into balls, dip it into beaten 
egg, then into fine pulverized cracker, and fry in butter; garnish with 
parsley. 

BEEF OMELET.

fine; salt, pepper, and a little sage, three eggs, six Boston crackers 
roUed ; make into a roll and bake. 

POUNDED BEEF. 

Boil a shin of twelve pounds of meat until it falls readily from the 
bone; pick it to pieces; mash gristle and all very fine, pick out all the 
hard bits. Set the liquor away; when cool take off all the fat; boil the 
liquor down to a pint and a half. Then return the meat to it while hot; 
add pepper and salt and any spice you choose. Let it boil a few 



GAME. - 47 

times, stirring all the while. Put into a mold or deep dish to cooL 
Use cold and cut in thin slices for tea or warm it for breakfast. 

MUTTON PIE. 
Cover the bottom of a dish with bread crumbs ; then a layer of cold 
mutton, cut in very thin slices; then a layer of tomatoes, sliced thin; 
season with pepper, salt, and small bits of butter, and so on, until the 
dish is full, or you have sufficient, having tomatoes and bread crumbs 
on top ; cover and bake about forty minutes, and serve hot. 

POT PIE. 

Cut veal, beef, or chicken into pieces and put into boiling water 
enough to cover, with two slices of bacon; cover closely and boil an 
hour, and season to taste ; make a batter of two well beaten eggs, two 
cups of milk, a teaspoonful baking powder, and flour to make a batter; 
drop in separate spoonfuls while boiling, and cook five minutes; serve 
immediately. 

TOMATO STEW. 
Two pounds of any kind of meat used for stewing; put into a sauce- 
pan with a can of tomatoes, or a quart of fresh ones; season with pepper

tablespoonfuls of butter, rubbed into a tablespoonful of flour; stew 
imtil the meat is tender, and then pour over dry toast. 



GAMH.

forty minutes; butter well and serve hot on hot dishes. 
For roasting allow thirty minutes. 
Serve with jelly. 
Garnish with lemon slices, Saratoga potatoes, or water-cresses. 

BKOILED QUAIL. 

Dress carefully, and soak a short time in salt and water; split down 
the back; dry with a cloth, and rub them over with butter, and place 
on the gridiron over a clear fire ; turn frequently, and dip in melted 
butter; season with salt; prepare a slice of thin toast, nicely buttered 
and laid on a hot dish, for each bird, and lay a bird breast upward, on 
on each slice; garnish with currant jelly. 

BKOILED PEAIEIE CHICKEN. 

"Wash thoroughly and remove the skin; put in hot water and boil 
fifteen or twenty minutes; take out and sprinkle with salt, pepper, and 
rub over with butter, and broil over a clear fire; place each on a piece 
of toast ; garnish with currant jeUy. 

BROILED PIGEONS. 

Split down the back; roll them in butter and cracker-crumbs, and 
broil; serve them on toast like quail, laying a piece of butter on each. 



48 THE PEOPLE'S COOK BOOK. 

PARTEIDGE PIE. 

Line a deep baking-dish with veal cutlets, and over them place thin 
slices of ham and a seasoning of pepper and salt; pluck, draw, wipe, 
and quarter four partridges, rub each part with a seasoning of pepper, 
salt, minced parsley, and butter; put in a baking-dish, pour over them 
a pint of strong soup-stock, line the edges of the dish wdth a light 
puff-paste, cover with the same, brush over with the yolk of an egg, 
and bake one hour. If the paste is in danger of becoming too brown, 
cover with a thick paper. 

EOAST QUAIL OR PRAIEIE CHICKEN. 
Dress carefully and wipe dry; tie a piece of salt pork over the breast 
of each bird, and put into a steamer over boiling water, covering 
closely, and steam twenty minutes; take out, remove the pork, and put 
into the oven, basting them often with butter, and brown. 

WILD DUCK. 

To Bake. — Use a stuffing or not, as preferred; place an onion in the 
pan in which they are baking, and baste at first with water, afterward 
with butter; sprinkle with salt and flour, and brow-n; half an hour will 
cook them; make a gravy of the giblets, and serve with currant or cran- 
berry jelly. 

To Bkoil. — Split down the back, dip in melted butter, and broil over 
a clear fire; garnish with lemon slices. 

\^NISON STEWED. 
Cut into small steaks; make a dressing as for duck, with bread- 
crumbs, onion, butter, pepper, and salt, thyme (or pork instead of 
butter, if preferred), and spread upon each steak; then roll and tie; 
then put into boiling water and stew ; thicken the gravy with flour. 

BROILED VENISON STEAK. 
Broil quickly over a clear fire, and, when sufficiently done, pour over 
two tablespoonsfuls of currant jelly melted with a piece of butter. 
Pepper and salt to season. Eat while hot, on hot plates. 

TO COOK VENISON. 

Broil as you would a beefsteak, rare. Have ready a gravy of butter, 
pepper, and salt, and a very little water. Heat the gravy without boil- 
ing it. Score the steak all over, put it in the gravy and cover tight; 
keep hot enough to steam the meat, and send in a covered dish to 
table. 

PIGEON COMPOTE. 

Truss six pigeons as for boiling. Grate the crumbs of a smaU loaf 
of bread, scrape one pound of fat bacon, chop thyme, parsley, an onion, 
and lemon peel fine, and season with salt and pepper, mix it up with 
two eggs, put this force-meat into the craws of the pigeons, lard the 
breasts and fry brown; place them in a stew-pan with some beef stock, 
and stew them three-quarters of an hour, thicken with a piece of but- 
ter roUed in flour. Serve with force-meat balls around the dish and 
strain the gravy onto the pigeons. 



GAME. 49 

TO EOAST WILD FOWL. 

The flavor is best preserved without stuffing. Put pepper, salt, and 
a piece of butter into each. Wild fov.i rcuuire much less dressing than 
tame. They should be served of a fine coior, and a rich, blown gravy. 
To take off the fishy taste which wild fowl sometimes have, put an 
onion, salt, and hot-water into the dripping-pan, and baste them for 
the first ten minutes with this, then take away the pan and baste con- 
stantly with butter: 

TO EOAST PARTKIDGES, PHEASANTS OR QUAILS. 

Pluck, singe, draw, and truss them, season with salt and pepper, roast 
for about a half an hour in a brisk oven, basting often with butter. 
When done, place on a dish together with bread crumbs fried brown 
and arranged in small heaps. Gravy should be served in a tureen 
apart. 

TO BROIL QUAIL OR WOODCOCK. 

After dressing, split down the back, sprinkle with salt and pepper, 
and lay them on a gridiron, the inside down. Broil slowly at first. 
Serve with cream gravy. 

TO ROAST WILD DUCK OR TEAL. 
After dressing, soak them over night in salt and water, to draw out 
the fishy taste. Then in the morning put them into fresh water, 
changing several times before roasting. Stuff or not, as desired. Serve 
with currant jelly. 

PIGEON PIE. 
Dress and wash clean, siolit down the back, and then proceed as for 
chicken pie. 

ROAST PIGEONS. 
When cleaned and ready for roasting, fill the bird with a stuffing of 
bread crumbs, a spoonful of butter, a little salt and nutmeg, and three 
oysters to each bird (some prefer chopped apple). They must be well 
basted with melted butter, and require thirty minutes' careful cooking. 
In the autumn they are best, and should be full grown. 

TO ROAST PIGEONS. 
They should be dressed while fresh. If young they will be ready 
for roasting in twelve hours. Dress carefully, and after making clean, 
wipe dry and put into each bird a small piece of butter dipped in 
cayenne. Truss the wings over the back and roast in a quick oven, 
keeping them constantly basted with butter. Serve with brown gravy. 
Dish them with young water-cresses. 

FRIED RABBIT. 

After the rabbit has been thoroughly cleaned and washed, put it into 
boiling water for about ten minutes; drain, and, when cold, cut it into 
joints, dip into beaten egg, and then into fine bread-crumbs, seasoned 
with salt and pepper. When all are ready fry them in butter over a 



50 THE PEOPLE'S COOK BOOK. 

moderate fire fifteen minutes, thicken the gravy with an ounce of but- 
ter and a small teaspoonful of flour, give it a minute's boil, stir in two 
tablespoonfuls of cream, dish the rabbit, pour the sauce under it, and 
serve quickly. 

STEWED BABBIT. 
Skin and clean the rabbit, cut into pieces, put one-fourth of a 
pound of butter into a stew-pan and turn the pieces of rabbit about in 
it until nicely browned; take out the meat, add one pint of boiling 
■water to the butter, one tablespoonful of flour stirred to a paste io. 
cold water, one tablespoonful of salt, and a little grated onion if liked, 
let this boil up, add the meat, stew slowly till the rabbit is tender. 
Serve hot. 

BOAST BABBIT. 

1. Clean and put into a dripping-pan with a small onion and carrot 
sliced; sprinkle with salt, pepper, and spread with butter; put into a 
quick oven with water enough to cover the bottom of the pan, and 
baste frequently; add more water if needed; when done, strain the 
gravy over the rabbit, and serve with cranberry sauce. 

2. Dress nicely and fill with a dressing made of bread crumbs, a little 
onion, sage, pepper and salt, and a small piece of butter; tie a piece of 
salt pork over it; put into a dripping-pan with a little water, in a 
quick oven; baste often; serve with currant jelly. 

BABBIT PIE. 

Line a deep dish with a puff paste or rich biscuit crust; stew the 
rabbit, season well, and pour into the dish; cover with an upper crust, 
and bake. 

SNIPE. 
Clean nicely and singe; put a piece of butter into each one, and tie a 
small piece of bacon over the breast, and bake, basting frequently; 
serve with water-cress. 



POULTRY. 



HOW TO CHOOSE POULTBY. 

Young, plump, and well fed, but not too fat poultry are the best. 
The skin should be fine-grained, clear, and white; the breast fuU, 
fleshed, and broad; the legs smooth. The birds must be heavy in 
proportion to their size. As regards ducks and geese, their breasts 
must also be plump; the feet flexible and yellow. For boiling, white- 
legged poultry must be chosen, because when dressed their appearance 
is by far the more delicate. But darker-legged ones are juicy and of a 
better flavor when roasted. The greatest precaution ought to be taken 
to prevent poultry from getting at all tainted before it is cooked. It 
should be killed and dressed from eight to ten hours before cooking. 
Pigeons are far better for being cooked the day they are killed, as they 



POVLTBY. 51 

lose their flavor by hanging. Care must be taken to cook poultry 
thoroughly, for nothing is more revolting to the palate than underdone 
poultry, 

PLAIN STUFFING. 

Take stale bread, cut off aU the crust, rub very fine and pour over 
it as much melted butter as will make it crumble in your hands; salt 
and pepper to taste. 

POTATO STUFFING. 

Take two-thirds bread and one-third boiled potatoes grated, butter 
size of an egg, pepper, salt, one egg, and a little ground sage; mix 
thoroughly. 

APPLE STUFFING. 

Take half a pound of the pulp of tart apples which have been baked 
or scalded; add two ounces of bread-crumbs, some powdered sage, a 
finely shred onion ; season well with cayenne pepper. For roast goose, 
duck, etc. 

CHESTNUT STUFFING. 

Boil the chestnuts and shell them, then blanch them and boil until 
soft; mash them fine and mix with a little sweet cream, some bread- 
crumbs, pepper, and salt. For turkey. 

ROAST TURKEY. 

A turkey weighing not more than eight or nine poimds (young") is the 
best. Wash and clean thoroughly, wiping dry, as moisture will spoil 
the stufiing. Take one small loaf of bread grated fine, rub into it a 
piece of butter the size of an egg, one small teaspoonful of pepper, 
and one of salt; sage, if liked. Rub all together, and fill only the 
breast of the turkey, sewing up so that the stufiing cannot cook out. 
Always put the giblets under the side of the fowl, so tliey will not dry 
up. Rub salt and pepper on the outside, put into the dripping-pan, 
with one teacupful of watei, basting often, turning it till brown all 
over. Bake about three hours. Have left in the chopping-bowl a little 
stuffing, take out the giblets, and chop fine. After taking out the tur- 
key put in a large tablespoonful of flour; stir until brown. Put the 
giblets into a gravy-boat, and pour over them the gravy. 

BOILED TURKEY. 

Soak it in salt and water for an hour and a half, to make it white. 
Make the stuffing of bread crumbs and about half the quantity of 
suet, a little parsley, and a little lemon-peel, chopped fine. Scald the 
parsley, in order to have it green. Put all these in the breast. Tie 
lightly in cloth, and boil. A young turkey will boil in two hours ; an 
older one wiU of course require a longer time. Garnish with parsley 
and lemon cut in shces. 

BOILED TURKEY. 

Stuff the turkey as for roasting. A very nice dressing is made by 
chopping half a pint of oysters, and mixing them with bread crumbs, 
butter, pepper, salt, thyme, and wet with milk or water. Baste about 
the turkey a thin cloth, the inside of which has been dredged with 



52 THE PEOPLE'S COOK BOOK. 

flour, and put it to boil in cold water with a teaspoonful of salt in it. 
Let a large turkey simmer for three hours; skim while boiling. Serve 
with oyster sauce, made by adding to a cupful of the liquor in which 
the turkej' was boiled the same quantity of milk, and eight oysters 
chopped fine; season with minced parslej^ stir in a spoonful of rice or 
wheat flour wet with cold milk; a tablespoonful of butter. Boil up 
once, and pour into a tureen. 

TUKKEY DKESSED WITH OYSTEES. 

For a ten-pound turkey take two pints of bread crujabs, half a tea- 
cupful of butter cut in bits (not melted), one teaspoonful of powdered 
thyme or summer savory, pepper, salt, and mix thoroughly. Hub the 
turkey well inside and out with salt and pepper, then fill with first a 
spoonful of crumbs, then a few well-drained oysters, using half a can 
for a turkey. Strain the oyster liquor, and use to baste the turkey. 
Cook the giblets in the pan, and chop fine for the gravy. A fowl of this 
size will require three hours in a moderate oven. 

TURKEY SCALLOP. 

Pick the meat from the bones of cold turkey, and chop it fine. Put 
a layer of bread crumbs on the bottom of a buttered dish, moisten 
them with a little milk, then put in a layer of turkey with some of the 
filling, and cut small pieces of butter over the top; sprinkle with pep- 
per and salt; then another layer of bread crumbs, and so on until the 
dish is neariy full; add a little hot water to the gravy left from the tur- 
key, and pour over it; then take two eggs, two tablespoonfuls of milk, 
one of melted butter, a little salt, and cracker crumbs as much as will 
make it thick enough to spread on with a knife; put bits of butter over 
it, and cover with a plate. Bake three-quarters of an hour. About 
ten minutes before serving remove the plate, and let it brown. 

CURRIED CHICKEN. 
Fry out in the pot you make the curry three large rasheis of pickled 
pork and three onions sliced; fry until the onions are brown; cut the 
chicken into small pieces, and slice three potatoes thin; add them to 
the pork and onions, cover well with water, cook until the chicken is 
done and the potatoes have thickened the water; salt to taste. Put two 
tablespoonfuls of curry powder in a tumbler, and mix with water; 
slice two or three more potatoes very thin; add the potatoes and mixed 
powder to the stew, and boil until the potatoes are cooked but not 
broken; serve with rice; the above is for one extra large chicken or two 
small ones. Green peas and corn are a valuable addition. 

STEWED CHICKEN WITH OYSTERS. 
Season and stew a chicken in a quart of water until very tender; 
take it out on a hot dish, and keep it warm; then put into the liquor a 
lump of butter the size of an egg; mix a little flour and water smooth, 
and make thick gravy; season well with pepper and salt, and let it 
come to a boil. Have ready a quart of oysters, picked over, and put 
them in without any liquor; stir them round, and as soon as they ar© 
cooked pour all over the chicken.

when it has boiled stir in a teacup of rich, sweet cream, and pour over 
the chicken. 

PRESSED CHICKEN OR VEAL. 
Boil three chickens until the meat comes off the bones, then remov- 
ing all bones, etc., chop, not very fine; add a piece of butter as large as 
an egg, salt and pepper to season well. Have about a pint of the 
broth, into which put one-half box gelatine until dissolved; then put 
back the chopped chicken and cook until the broth is evenly absorbed. 
Press under a weight in a pan until cold. 

JELLIED CHICKEN OR VEAL. 
Boil a chicken in as little water as possible, until the meat falls from 
the bones; chop rather fine, and season with pepper and salt; put in a 
mold a layer of the chopped meat and then a layer of hard-boiled 
eggs cut in slices; then layers of meat and egg alternately until the 
mold is nearly fall; boil down the liquor left in the pot one-half; while 
warm, add one-quarter of an ounce of gelatine, and when dissolved 
pour into the mould over the meat. Set in a cool j)lace over night to

biscuit-cutter about an inch thick; drop this into the boiling gravy, 
having previously removed the chicken to a hot platter, cover, and let 
it boil from one-half to three-quarters of an hour. To ascertain whether 
they are done or not, stick into one of them a fork, and if it comes out 
clean they are done. Lay on the platter with the chicken, pour over 
the gravy, and serve. 

BROILED CHICKEN. 
Only young, tender chickens are nice broiled. After cleaning and 
washing them, split down the back, wipe dry, season with salt and

added one-half the quantity of the water in which the chickens were 
cooked; season to taste. 

SMOTHEBED CHICKEN. 
Dress your chickens; wash and let them stand in water half an hour 
to make them white; put into a baking-pan (first cutting them open at 
the back); sprinkle salt and pepper over them, and put a lump of but-

CHICKEN SALAD. 

1. To two large boiled fowls (cold) take two large heads of celery 
or four small ones; having removed all the skin and the fat, cut the 
meat from the bones into very small pieces; it is best not to mix the 
dressing with the salad until just before it is to be eaten. Put into a 
porcelain kettle the gravy from the chicken, one-half pint of vinegar, 
one-half pint of sweet oil or melted butter, one large tablespoonful of 
Colman's mustard, one small teaspoonful of cayenne pepper, one tea-

ly into fine slices, and when cold mixed with fine olive oil. After having 
drawn with this for a little while, add salt, pepper, chopped onion, and 
mix all this by shaking it up, as using a spoon would break the pota- 
toes, and make them unsightly. Add good vinegar. 

2. Small onions sliced and cold boiled potatoes, over which pour the 
simple dreesing. 

3. Cut a dozen cold boiled potatoes into fancy shapes, one-quarter of 
an inch thick; mix with some flakes of cold boiled fish (halibut, cod,

Drain off the water, and set them for a few minutes in a tin pan before 
the fire or in the stove, that they may be well dried. Peel them before 
sent to the table. To Fry — Choose large potatoes; half boil them, and 
then, having taken off the skins, cut the potatoes into slices, and fry 
in butter or in nice drippings. To Bake— Bake as the common potato, 
except give them a longer time.

drain ; spread between the folds of a clean cloth, rub and pat until dry. 
Fry a few at a time in boiling lard- salt as yoii take them out. Sara- 
toga potatoes are often eaten cold. They can be prepared three or four 
hours before needed, and if kept in a warm place they will be crisp and 
nice. They are used for garnishing game and steaks.

up one or two eggs, and stir into them just as you dish them for the 
table ; do not leave them a moment on the fire after the eggs are in, 
for if they harden they are not half so nice ; one egg is enough for 
three or four persons, unless they are very fond of potatoes; if they 
are, have plenty, and put in two. 

POTATO BALLS OR CROQUETTES. 
Four large, mealy potatoes, cold, mash them in a pan with two ta- 
blespoonfuls of fresh melted butter, a pinch of salt, a little pepper,

STEWED POTATOES. 

Put into a frying-pan a small piece of butter, a little parsley chopped 
fine, salt, and pei)j)er, and half a cup of cream, set on the tire and let 
come to a boil. Cut cold boiled potatoes into small pieces and turn 
into the cream, let the cream boil up well around the potatoes, add 
another small piece of butter, and serve. 

LYONNAISE POTATOES. 

Into a saucepan put a large lump of butter and a small onion, finely 
chopped, and when the onion is fried to an amber color, throw in 
slices of cold boiled potatoes, which must be thoroughly stirred until 
they are turning brown; at this moment put in a spoonful of finely- 
chopped parsley, and as soon as it is cooked drain through a colander, 
so the potatoes retain the moisture of the butter and many particles 
of the parsley. Thus you may have Lyonnaise potatoes. 

FRIED OYSTER PLANT. 
Parboil oyster plant; scrape off the outside; cut in slices; dip in 
beaten egg, roll in bread crumbs, and fry in hot lord. 

SALSIFY, OR VEGETABLE OYSTERS. 
Wash and sejape them thoroughly, and as you wash throw them into 
a bowl of cold water. Cut into pieces about half an inch long, boil 
three- fourths of an hour, when tender pour off all the water, season 
with pepper and salt, a small lump of butter, and enough cream to 
almost cover them; if no cream, use milk, with more butter, and 
thicken like gravy with a little flour. They are nice served on toast. 

BAKED EGG PLANT. 

Cut in halves a nice smooth egg plant scoop out the center, leaving 
with the skin about one-third of an inch, chop the inside of the egg 
plant very fine, two ripe tomatoes, one onion, some bread-crumbs, a 
little parsley, and green pepper— onion and pepper to be chopped 
separately very fine, salt, • butter, and very little pepper, mix very 
smooth, put in the shell, butter on top, and bake about one-half hour. 

FRIED EGG PLANT.

Boil until soft, and scoop out all the inside; mash fine, and to every 
cupful add a teaspoonful of cracker crumbs, a teaspoonful of butter, 
and pepper and salt to taste; put into a dish for the table; beat an egg 
very light, and spread a part over the top of the dish, then sprinkle 
with rolled cracker, and lastly spread with the remainder of the egg, 
and set into the oven to brown. 



VEGETABLES. 71 

EGG PLANT. 
Put into water and boil until soft, then cut in two and scoop out all 

the inside; season; take a tablespoonful at a time, dip in egg and bread- 
crumbs, and fry in hot lard. 

STUFFED CABBAGE, 

Cut the heart out of a large cabbage ; take cold chicken or any cold 
meat, and chop very line, and season highly, and mix with the yolk of 
an egg; fill the cabbage with this stuffing, and then tie it firmly in a 
cloth, and boil an hour and a half or two hours. 

TO BOIL ASPAEAGUS. 
Scrape the stems lightly to within two inches of the points; throw 
them into cold water for a few minutes; tie in bunches of equal size, 
cut the ends that the}'' may be all of the same length, then throw into 
boiling water a little salted, and boil fast for twenty or twenty-five 
minutes, or until quite tender; have prepared a round of bread nicely 
toasted, which dip quickly into the boiling asparagus water, then dish 
the asjDaragus upon it, with the points meeting in the center; send 
rich melted butter to the table with it. 

BAKED BEETS. 

Wash and put into a pan; set into a moderate oven, and bake slowly; 
when soft, remove the skin, and dress to taste. 

BEANS. 

We must not forget beans, which abound so much in nourishment, 
but they must be thoroughly cooked; for bean soup they should be 
boiled about five hours seasoned then with cream or butter, and with 
salt, they ought to be relished by everybody. However I may have 
seasoned this soup, my children always wish to add milk upon their 
plates. Baked beans must be either boiled until very soft before 
baking, or must be baked a long time— from three to six hours, if not 
previously very tender— with a good deal of liquor in the jar or pan. 
Those who use pork at ail, usually put a piece of fat pork in the dish 
of beans prepared for baking, but some of us very much prefer a sea- 
soning of cream or butter. Split pea-soup or common unsplit dried 
peas, boiled five to six hours without meat, is very nutritious, and 
much liked by many; I season it with salt, and cream or milk, if I have 
it— the more the better — otherwise with butter. 

BAKED BEANS. 

Soak a pint and a half of dried beans over night; in the morn- 
ing pour off the water, cover with fresh water, and boil until they 
crack open, or are very tender; then put them with the water in which 
they were boiled, into a deep earthen dish, adding a little- salt, and, if 
agreeable, a tablesj)o nful of molasses; put on top of the dish one 
half pound of fat and lean pork or corned beef, which should be 
gashed or scored acro&s the rind; bake four hours, and longer, if con- 
venient; it will be better for it, only bake slowlj^; keep nearly covered 
with water till two-thirds done, then allow it to dry away. . 



72 THE PEOPLE'S COOK BOOK. 

GREENS. 

This is the simplest of dishes, yet it is not always a well-served one. 
Greens should be properly boiled; the water should be soft, and a 
tablespoonful of salt added to a large-sized pot of it, which should be 
boiling hot when the greens are thrown in; it should be kept boiling 
until they are done, which can be told by their sinking to the bottom 
of the pot, and then they should be skimmed out as quickly as possi- 
ble into a colander so that all the water will run out; press them with 
a small plate, and then turn upon a platter, add a large i^iece of butter, 
and cut up fine. Serve smoking hot. 

LIMA BEANS. 

They should be gathered young; shell them, lay them in a pan of 
cold water, and then boil them about two hours, till they are quite 
soft; drain well, and add to them some butter.

whites of two eggs, one-half pint of cream; white meat and ham 
chop23ed ver}' fine, three spoonsf uls of grated cheese. Season with salt 
and pepper, heat all together, stirring constantly. Mix with the maca- 
roni, put into a buttered mold, and steam one hour. 

MACARONI WITH CHEESE. 
Throw into boiling water some macaroni, with salt according to 
quantity used; let it boil one-fourth of an hour, when it will be a little 
more than half-cooked, drain off the water; place the macaroni in a 
saucepan with milk to cover, boil till done. Butter a pudding-dish, 
sprinkle the bottom with plenty of grated cheese, put in the macaroni 
a little white pepper, plenty of buttei*, sprinkle on more cheese, cover 
that with bread-crumbs, set in a quick oven to brown; serve hot. 

MACARONI WITH OYSTERS. 
Boil macaroni in salt water, after wich draw through a colander; 
take a deep earthen dish or tin ; put in alternate layers of macaroni 
and oysters; sprinkle the layers of macaroni with grated cheese; bake

STEWED ^ilACARONI. 

Boil two ounces of macaroni in water, drain well, put into a sauce- 
pan one ounce of butter, mix with one tablespoonful of flour, moisten 
with four tablespoonf uls of veal or beef stock, one gill of cream; salt 
and white pepper to taste; put in the macaroni, let it boil up, and 
serve while hot. 



VEGETABLES. . 73 

MACARONI WITH TOMATOES. 
Boil one-half pound of macaroni till tender, pour off all the water, 
then add one-halt cup of sweet cream, one-third of a cup of butter, 
pejDper, and salt; let simmer for a short time, but be careful that it 
does not become much broken; turn into vegetable dish; have ready 
one pint of stewed tomatoes; season with butter, salt, and pej)per; 
pour over the macaroni. 

BOILED ONIONS. 
Skin them thoroughly. Put them to boil; when they have boiled a 
few minutes, pour off the water and add clean cold water, and then 
set them to boil again. Pour this away and add more cold water, when 
they may boil till done. This will make them white and clear, and 
very mild in flavor. After they are done, pour off aU the water, and 
dress with a little cream, salt and pepper to taste, 

ESCALLOPED ONIONS. 

Boil till tender six large onions; afterward separate them with a 
large spoon; then place a layer of onions and a layer of grated bread- 
crumbs alternately in a pudding-dish; season with pepper and salt to 
taste; moisten with milk; put into the oven to brown. 

SCOTCH ESCALLOPS. 
Peel potatoes and slice, not quite as thin as for Samtoga chips, and 
cover the bottom of a dripping-pan with them; sprinkle with salt and 
pepper and small pieces of butter, or butter and lard mixed; continue 
this until the pan is full; lay a slice of salt pork or two on the top; 
cover closely and bake in a good hot oven. Very nice sweet potatoes 
can be prepared in the same way. They are very nice without the 
pork. 

TURNIPS. 

Pare and cut into pieces; put them into boiling water well salted, 
and boil until tender; drain thoroughly and then mash and add a piece 
of butter, pepper, and salt to taste, and a small teaspoonful of sugar. 
Stir until they are thoroughly mixed, and serve hot 

FRIED PARSNIPS. 
Scrape, cut into strips, and boil until tender in salted water; drain 
and dip into batter, made with one egg beaten light, one-half cup of 
milk, and flour enough to make a batter, and fry in hot butter or lard, 

ASPARAGUS. 

Cook only the tender green stalks; cut them of equal lengths, and 
toil in water with a little salt till tender. While the asparagus is cook- 
ing prepare some nicely toasted bread, lay the asparagus on the toast 
and season with butter, salt, and i^epper, or pour over it a little cteam 
previously .scalded. 

SPINACH. 
Spinach requires good washing and close picking. Boil twenty min- 



74 THE PEOPLE'S COOK BOOK. 

ntes in boiling water, drain, season with butter, pepper, and salt; gar- 
nish the dish with slices of hard-boiled eggs. 

FRESH CORN MUSH. 

Take several ears of green corn, grate it down; take some milk, stir 
into the corn briskly with a little salt; strain through a coarse sieve, 
and put in a hot cooking-pot with a spoonful of lard. Keep it well 
stirred for at least twenty minutes without stopping, while cooking.- 
"When thickened put into a deep dish, slice, and fry. 

PARSNIP FRITTERS. 

Four parsnips, boiled and mashed fine; add three well-beaten eggs, 
two tablespooufuls of sifted flour, butter the size of an egg, one teacup 
of milk, and salt to taste. Upon a hot buttered griddle drop the mix- 
ture, and bake after the style of flannel-cakes. Serve quite hot. 

PARSNIP STEW. 

Three slices of salt pork, boil one hour and a half; scrape five large 
parsnips, cut in quarters lengthwise, add to the pork, and let boil one- 
half hour, then add a few potatoes, and let all boil together until the 
potatoes are soft; the fluid in the kettle should be about a cupful when 
ready to take ofl:. 

GREEN PEAS. 
Put the pods into a pot, cover and boil thoroughly, then strain and 
put the peas into the same water and boil tender. Season with butter, 
pepper, a little salt, and the least bit of sugar. 

BOILED HOMINY. 

Soak one cup cf fine hominy in three cups of water and salt to taste; 
in the morning turn it into a quart pail; then put the pail into a kettle 
of boiling water, cover tightly and steam one hour; then add one tea- 
cupful of sweet milk, and boil fifteen minutes. 

CAULIFLOWER. 
Trim off all the outside leaves, and put into boiling water well 
salted; boil until tender, and then serve with a white sauce or with 
cream. 

TO FRY PARSLEY. 

This, when done as it should be, is one of the nicest as well as cheap- 
est of garnishings. The parsley should be washed and dried in a 
cloth; then if one is the happy possessor of a wire basket, put in the 
parsley and hold from two to three minutes in boiling drippings; take 
from the basket and dry until crisp before the kitchen fire. It may be 
fried without a basket, but requires more care in so doing. 

STEWED MUSHROOMS. 

Wash them, cut off the ends of the stalks and peel them; put them 
in a stew-pan without any water, and season with salt and pep j)er; add 
two ounces of butter rolled in two teaspoonfuls of flour to every pint 



VEGETABLES. 75 

of mushrooms; cover them closely and let them simmer slowly until 
they are soft. 

TOMATO TOAST. 
Eub tomatoes through the colander, and cook to taste; toast three 
slices of bread, butter^ud lay upon a hot dish; just before serving add 
a cup of cream or milk to the tomatoes and pour over the toast. 

STUFFED TOMATOES. 
Select large tomatoes of even size, and sccop out a small place in the 
top and fill with stuffing made as follows: Fry a small onion chopped 
fine in a tablespoonful of butter; when nearly done add some bread 
crumbs, moistened with a little milk or water, and seasoned with pep- 
per and salt; put a little bit of butter on each and then bake. Another 
dressing is made as follows : Chop very fine cold meat or fowl of any 
kind with a very small piece of bacon added; fry an onion chopped 
fine in a tablespoonful of butter, and when nearly done add the meat, 
some bread-crumbs, pepper and salt; cook a minute; mix well; add the 
yolk of an egg, and fill the tomatoes; place in a baking dish; sprinkle 
bread-crumbs over them with some small bits of butter, and bake. Use 
either as a garnish or as a disU by itself. 

AN EXCELLENT DISH. 
Place alternate layers of tomatoes, sliced onions, and bread and but- 
ter in a pudding dish and bake. 

PARSNIP FRITTERS. 
Boil in salted water until very tender; then mash, seasoning with a 
little butter, pepper, and salt, add a little flour and one or two eggs, 
well beaten; make into small balls or cakes and fry in hot lard. 

POTATO CAKES. 

Grate raw potatoes; season; add flour and well-beaten eggs; make 
into cakes and fry. 

BAKED POTATOES. 

Slice them and put into cold water for a time before using; then put 
into a baking-dish, with seasoning and half-pint of milk; bake slowly, 
and when done, lay a piece of butter on the top. 

POTATO- CHEESE PUFFS. 

Take some grated cheese, some cold mashed potato, and a beaten 
egg, with a little butter; mix well, adding salt and pepper; put into 
patty-pans, and bake in a quick oven. Serve hot. 

POTATO PUFF. 
Beat a pint of mashed potatoes; butter the size of an egg, melted, 
until very light; then add half a cup of cream and two eggs beaten 
separarely ; beat well and pile irregularly in a dish, and bake quicikly. 



76 THE PEOPLE'S COOK BOOK, 

CARROTS STEWED. 

Cut the carrots lengthways, and boil until soft; then slice very thin 
and put into a saucepan with two tablesiDOonfuls of butter and 'a cup 
of cream or milk; season, and stew a quarter of an hour. 

CAULIFLOWER, WITH CHEESE. 
Boil in salted water until tender; put them into a baking-dish and 
pour over them a drawn-butter sauce in which has been mixed a little 
grated cheese; sprinkle with bread-crumbs, and place in a quick oven 
for ten minutes. 

CABBAGE A-LA-CREME. 

Boil and drain the c?-bbage; put into a saucepan one cup of cream, 
two tablespoonfuls of butter, and thicken with a little flour, and season 
with salt and pepper, and then add the cabbage, and boil slowly five or 
ten minutes. 



£GGS AND OMELETS. 

PROPER WAY TO COOK EGGS. 
Butter a tin plate and break in your eggs; set in a steamer; place 
over a kettle of boiling water, and steam until the whites are cooked; 
they are more ornamental when broken into patty-tins, as they keep 
their form better; the whites of the eggs, when cooked in this manner, 
are tender and light, and not tough and leathery, as if cooked by any 
other process; they can be eaten by invalids, and they certainly are 
■very much richer than by any other method; if cooked in the shell, 
they taste of the lime contained in them, and, if broken into boiling 
water, it destroys their flavor. 

TO PRESERVE EGGS. 
Pack them when perfectly fresh, in wheat bran, the small ends down, 
and so loosely as to prevent their coming in contact with each other, or 
the sides or bottom of the vessel which contains them. Cover care- 
fully with bran, well pressed down. 

A NICE CHEESE RELISH. 
Four ounces of flour, four ounces of cheese, and three of butter, 
salt, pepper, and a dash of cayenne pepper; knead it all together, roll 
thin, cut in strips like ladies' lingers, and bake a delicate brown. 

SCRAMBLED EGGS WITH HAM. 
Put into a pan, butter, a little pepper and salt and a little milk; when 
hot drop in the eggs, and with a knife cut the eggs and scrape them 
from the bottom ; add some cold ham chopped fine, and when done 
serve in a hot dish. 



EGGS AND OMELETS. 77 

TO POACH EGGS. 
Have the water well salted, and not let it boil hard. Break the eggs 
separately into a saucer, and slip gently into the water; when nicely done, 
remove with a skimmer, trim neatly, and laj' each egg upon a small, 
thin square of buttered toast, then sprinkle with salt and pepper. 
Some i^ersons prefer them poached, rather than fried, with ham, in 
which case, substitute the ham for toast. 

STUFFED EGGS. 
Boil the eggs hard, remove the shells, and then cut in two, either 
way, as preferred. Remove the yolks, and mix with them pepper, 
salt, and a little dry mustard— some like cold chicken, ham, or tongue, 
chopped very line — and then stuff the cavities, smooth them, and put 
the halves together again. For picnics, they can simply be wrapped 
in tissue paper to keep them together. If for home use, they can be 
egged and bread-crumbed, and browned in boiling lard; drain, and 
garnish with parsley. 

EGG TOAST. 
Beat four eggs, yolks and whites together, thoroughly; put two 
tablespoonfuls of butter into a saucepan, and melt slowly; then pour 
in the eggs, and heat without boiling over a slow fire, stirring con- 
stantly; add a little saU, and when hot, spread on slices of nicely- 
browr.ed toast, and serve at once. 

CHEESE OMELET. 

Butter the sides of a deep dish and cover with thin slices of rich 
cheese: lay over the cheese thin slices of well-buttered bread, first cov- 
ering the cheese with a little red pepper and mustard; then another 
layer of cheese; beat the yolk of an egg in a cup of cream — milk will 
do— and pour over the dish, and put at once into the oven; bake till 
nicely brown. Serve hot. or it will be tough, hard, and worthless. 

OMELET WITH OYSTEES. 

Allow one egg for each person, and beat separately very light; season; 
just before cooking add the oysters, which have been previously 
scalded in their own liquor. 

TOMATO OMELET. 

One quart of tomatoes, chopped finely (after the skin is removed), 
and put into a saucepan with two finely-chopped onions, a little but- 
ter, salt, and pepper, one cracker pounded finely; cover tight and let 
it simmer about an hour; beat five eggs to a froth; have your griddle 
hot; grease it well; stir j'^our eggs into the tomato, beat together, and 
pour into the griddle; brown on one side, fold and brown on the other. 
To be served hot. 

BREAD OMELET. 

One cup of bread crumbs wet with a little milk, salt and pepper, let 
stand until soft, beat eight eggs light, heat the skiUet, adding a large 
lump of butter, mix the bread and eggs, pour into the skillet, and after 
eggs harden divide in the middle. 



78 THE PEOPLE'S COOK BOOK. 

BAKED OMELET. 

1. Beat the yolks of six eggs, and add the whites of three eggs beaten 
very Ught; salt and pepper to taste; a tablespoonful of flour mixed in 
a cup of milk; pour into a well-buttered pan, and put into a hot oven; 
when thick pour over it tiic whites of three eggs beaten light, and 
brown. Serve immediately, 

2. Set one-half pint of milk on the fire and stir in one-half cup of 
flour mixed with a little cold milk and salt; when scalding-hot, beat 
the yolks of six eggs and add them, stir in whites and set immediately 
in the oven^ bake twenty minutes, and serve as soon as done. 

OMELET. 

Beat the yolks and whites of eight eggs separately until light, then 
beat together; add a little salt and one tablespoonful of cream. Have 
in the omelet pan a piece of butter; when the butter is boiling-hot, 
pour in the omelet, and shake it until it begins to stiffen, and then 
let it brown. Fold double, and serve hot. 

APPLE OMELET. 

Eight large apples, four eggs, one cup of sugar, one tablespoonful 
of butter, nutmeg or cinnamon to taste. Stew the apples and mash 
fine, add butter and sugar; when cold, add ,lhe eggs, well beaten. 
Bake until brown, and eat while warm. 

OYSTER OMELET. 

Allow for every six large oysters or twelve small ones, one egg, 
remove the hard part, and mince the rest very fine; take the yolks of 
eight eggs and whites of four, beat till very light, then mix in the 
oysters, season, and beat all up thoroughly ; put into a skillet a gill of 
butter, let it melt; when the butter boils, skim it, and turn in the 
omelet, stir until it stiffens, fry light brown; when the under side is 
brown, turn on to a hot platter. If wanted the upper side brown, hold 
a red-hot shovel over it. 

OJklELET SOUFFLEE. 
Stir five tablespoonfuls of silted flour into three pints of milk, 
strain through a sieve; add the yolks of eight eggs; beaten very light, 
and, just as it goes into the oven, the whites beaten stiff. Bake 
quickly. 

FRENCH OJtIELET. 

One quart of milk, one pint of bread-crumbs, five eggs, one table- 
spoonful of flour, one onion chopped fine, chopped parsley, season with 
pepper and salt. Have butter melted in a spider; when the omelet is 
brown, turn it over. Double when served. 

OMELET WITH HAM. 

Make a plain omelet, and just before turning one half over the 
other, sprinkle over it some finely-chopped ham. Garnish with small 
slices of ham. Jelly or marmalade may be added in the same manner. 



EGGS AND OMELETS. 79 

BOILED EGGS, WITH SAUCE.* 
Boil hard, remove the shell, set in a hot dish, and serve with 
piquante sauce. 

BAKED EGGS. 

1. Mix some finely chopped ham and bread crumbtj in about equal 
proportions, and season with salt and pepper, and moisten with milk and 
a little melted butter; half fill some patty pans with the mixture, break 
over the top of each an egg, sjprinkle with fine bread-crumbs, and 
bake; serve hot. 

2. Break the eggs into a buttered dish and season; add small bits 
of butter and a little cream; bake fifteen minutes. 

3. Butter a cleartr smooth saucepan, break as many eggs as will be 
n«eded into a saucer, one by one. If found good, slip it into the dish. 
No broken yolk allowed, nor must they crowd so as to risk breaking 
the yolk after put in. Put a small piece of butter on each, and 
sprinkle with pepper and salt. Set into a well-heated oven, and bake 
till the whites are set. If the oven is rightly heated, it will take but a 
few minutes, and is far more delicate than fried eggs. 

HOMILY FHITTEES. 

Two teacupfuls. of cold boiled hominy; stir in one teacupful of sweet 
milk and a little salt; four tablespoonfuls of sifted flour and one egg; 
beat the white separately and add last; drop the batter by spoonfuls 
into hot lard, and fry a nice brox^n. 

BAKED CABBAGE. 

Cook as for boiled cabbage, after which drain and set aside until 
cold. Chop fine, add two beaten eggs, a tablespoonful of butter, pep- 
per, salt, three tablespoonfuls rich cream; stir well and bake in a but- 
tered dish until brown. Eat hot. 

BEETS. 
Wash thoroughly, being careful not to prick the skin, as that will de- 
stroy the color; put into boiling water and boil five or six hours; if 
served hot season with butter; pepper, and salt; if cold, cover with 
vinegar. 

EGG A-LA-MODE. 

Remove the skin from a dozen tomatoes, medium size, cut them up 
in a saucepan, add a little butter, pepper, and salt; when sufficiently 
boiled, beat up five or six eggs, and just before you serve, turn them 
into the saucepan with the tomato, and stir one way for two minutes, 
allowing them time to be well done. 

EGG BASKETS. 
Boil quite hard as many eggs as will be needed. Put into cold water 
till cold, then cut neatly into halves with a thin, sharp knife; remove 
the yolk and rub to a paste with some melted butter, adding pepper 
and salt. Cover up this paste and set aside till the filling is ready. 
Take cold roast duck, chicken, or turkey, which may be on hand, chop 
fine and pound smooth, and vvhile pounding mix in the paste prepared 



80 THE PEOPLE'S COOK BOOK. 

from the yolks. As yoti pound moisten with melted- butter and some 
gravy which may have been left over from the fowls; set this paste 
when done over hot water till well heated. Cut off a small slice from 
the end of the empty halves of the whites, so they will stand firm, then 
fill them with this paste; place them close together on a flat round dish, 
and pour over the rest of the gravy, if any remains^ or make a little 
fresh. A few spoonfuls of cream or rich milk improves this dressing. 

FRENCH EGG CAKE. 

Beat up thoroughly six eggs, a teaspoonf ul of sweet cream or milk, 
and a little salt. Fry in a pan in which there is one-half ounce of 
melted butter, over a quick fire. In order that the omelet may remain 
soft and juicy, it is necessary that the pan should be hot before the 
eggs are poured in. During the frying move the pan continually to 
and fro; continue this until a cake is formed, then let it remain still a 
moment to brown. Turn out and serve immediately. 



BREAD, BISCUIT, £TC. 

In selecting flour first look to the color. If it is white, with a 
yellowish straw-color tint, buy it. If it is white, with a bluish cast, or 
with black specks in it, refuse it. Next examine its adhesiveness— wet 
and knead a little of it between your fingers; if it works soft and sticky, 
it is poor. Then throw a little lump of dri>-;d flour against a smooth 
surface; if it falls like powder, it is bad. Lastly, squeeze some of the 
flour tightly in j'our hand; if it retains the shape given by the pressure 
that, too, is a good sign. It is safe to buy flour that will stand all these 
tests. 

Three things are indispensable to success in bread making; good 
flour, good yeast, and watchful care; a fourth might be added: experi- 
ence. 

In winter, always warm the flour for bread, and keep the sponge near 
the stove, where it will not get chilled. 

Bread should be put into a rather hot oven. An hour is the time 
•usually allowed for baking. 

Eolls and biscuits should bake quickly. To make them a nice color, 
rub them over with warm water just before putting them into the oven, 
to glaze them, brush lightly with milk and sugar. 

Baking powder and soda biscuit should be made as rapidly as possi- 
ble, laid into hot pans and put in a quick oven. 

Gem pans should be heated and well greased. 

Fritters should be made quickly and beaten very thoroughly. 

Pancakes should be weU beaten, the eggs separately, the whites to a 
stiff froth and added the last thing. 

HOP YEAST. 
Six potatoes boiled in a gallon of water with a handful of hops tied 
in a bag; put in a jar one-half cup of flour, and when the potatoes are 



BREAD, BISCUIT, ETC. 81 

done, pour the water over it, adding the potatoes when mashed; when 
lukewarm, add a cup of yeast, and when cold a half cup of sugar, one- 
fourth cup of salt, and a tablespoonful of ginger. 

POTATO YEAST. 

Take half a dozen medium -sized potatoes, boil and mash fine, and 
two cups of flour, a good tablespoonful ginger, one of salt, one-half cup 
white sugar; add two cups of boiling water, and beat until smooth; 
when lukewarm, add a cup of yeast or two yeast cakes. 

YEAST. 

1. Take two good-sized potatoes, grate them raw. Add one-half tea- 
cup of white sugar, one teaspoon of salt, a little ginger. Pour over the 
mixture one-half pint of boiling water, in which one tablespoonful of 
hops has been boiled. Save half a cup each time to start anew. 

2. To one cup of grated raw potato add half cup salt and half cup 
sugar, pour over all one quart boiling water, stirring well; it will 
thicken like starch; when nearly cold add one cup of good yeast. In 
about twelve hours it should be light. Put in jug or bottle, and cork 
tightly. 

3. A double handful of hops, one-half-dozen large potatoes; boil to- 
gether in one-half gallo#w»f water till done; strain and mash on to one- 
half cupful of ginger, small cup of flour, and one cup of brown sugar, 
and half cup of salt. Let stand until cool, then add one cuj)fui of 
good yeast. Next day cork up tight in a jug. 

YEAST AND BREAD. 

Take ten large potatoes, pare, and put them in a kettle with three 
quarts of water; put a pint of hops in a thin muslin bag in the same 
kettle with potatoes; boil until potatoes are soft, then pour the water 
from this kettle boiling hot over a pint of flour in a crock. Squeeze all 
the strength from the hops; mash the potatoes, add a quart of cold 
water to them, and put through a colander into the crock, and add one- 
half teacup of salt, a cup of sugar, one tablespoonful of ginger." Let 
this stand for two days until it stops fermenting and settles; then put 
into a jug, cork tight, and keep in a cool place. 

FOR THE BREAD, 
^are and boil six good-sized potatoes, drain ofiE the water, mash fine, 
and pour over them about three pints of cold water, and run through 
a colander; add flour until this is a thin batter, then put in a cupful of 
yeast from the jug. Let stand until it rises, and then stir into flour as 
much as you can with a spoon, and let rise again. "Work in enough 
more flour to make as stifl: as bread, and let rise the third time. When 
light this time work out into loaves, and let rise. All the flour must be 
sifted. 

VIENNA BREAD. 
The following is the recipe by which the Vienna bread was made 
that became so famous on the Centennial grounds: Sift in a tin pan 
four pounds of flour; bank up against the sides; pour in one quart of 



82 THE PEOPLE'S COOK BOOK. 

milk and water, and mix into it enough flour to form a thin batter; 
then quickly and lightly add one pint of milk, in which is dissolved 
one ounce of salt and one and three-quarter ounces of yeast; leave the 
remainder of the flour against the sides of the pan; cover the 
pan with a cloth, and set in a place, free from draught for three-quar- 
ters of an hour; then mix in the rest of the flour until the dough will 
leave the bottom and sides of the pan, and let it stand two and a half 
hours; finally, divide the mass into one-pound pieces, to be cut in turn 
into twelve parts each; this gives square pieces about three and a half 
inches thick, each corner of which is taken up and folded over to the 
center, and then the cases are turned over on a dough-board to rise for 
half an hour, when they are put in a hot oven that bakes them in ten 
minutes 

BREAD. 

The first thing is the yeast, which is made with hops, a small handful 
boiled and stirred into flour with a little salt, and sometimes a little 
ginger and brown sugar. To " set" the sponge, the flour is sifted care- 
fully, and into the center is poured the yeast, thoroughly mixed 
with water and salt, and about a peck of finely-mashed potatoes is 
needed for a baking of a dozen loaves of medium size. This mixture 
is made thoroughly fine, and the ingredientsjv'hen mixed (about new 
milk-warm in summer, and a little warmer m colder weather) poured 
slowly upon the flour, and made into a fine batter. It is at night, which 
is our plan ; the first thing in the morning it is again worked and set to 
rise before breakfast, so that by dinner time our large baking is fin- 
ished. The potatoes, without a doubt, keep the bread moist, are a 
healthful addition, and where cheap effect a saving in flour of some 
importance. 

STEAMED BROWN BREAD. 

One cup of molasses, two and a half cupfuls of sour milk, one tea- 
spoonful of soda dissolved in a teaspoonful of warm water, two cups 
of graham flour, one cup corn meal, teaspoonful of salt; steam three 
hours, and then set a few minutes in the oven, 

BUCKWHEAT CAKES. 
Take warm water, and thicken it with flour, to -which add a table- 
spoonful of molasses to make them brown well. Brewers' yeast is bo^t, 
but it cannot generally be obtained except in large towns. In the 
morning add a little soda. If the batter is of the right consistence, 
and the cakes baked quickly and eaten direct from the griddle, they will 
be quite different from the tough, heavy things too often stacked up 
before the fire. 

BREAD PANCAKES. 

Soak the bread and drain; to two cups of bread add one of flour, 
milk enough to make a thin batter, two teaspoonf uls baking powder, 
and one egg, beaten light. 

CORN MEAL PANCAKES. 
Take two eups of Indian meal and a teaspoonful of salt; pour over it 



BREAD, BISCUIT, ETC, 83 

boiling water to make a batter; stand until cool, and then add the 
yolks of three eggs beaten, flour to make the proper consistency, one 
and a half teaspoonfuls baking powder; just before baking add the 
whites, beaten stiff. 

KICE PANCAKES. 

One-half cup of cold boiled rice, mixed with one pint of milk and 
the yolks of three eggs, and flour (in which has been mixed a good 
teaspoonful of baking powder and a little salt) to make a batter; bake 
on the griddle, and while hot spread with jelly or jam; roll up, trim 
and sprinkle over with sugar; must be eaten hot. 

TOMATO PANCAKES. 

Make a batter with one cup of flour, two teaspoonfuls sugar, salt, 
teaspoonful baking powder and two cups of milk, adding last three 
eggs, beaten light; slice large tomatoes, season, cover with the batter, 
and bake on a griddle. 

YEAST WAFFLES. 

One quart of flour mixed with a pint of warm milk; add one-half 
cup of yeast, salt, two eggs (well beaten), and piece of butter size of 
an egg, melted; when light, bake. 

WAFFLES. 

Kub a large teaspoonful of baking powder and the same quantity of 
butter into a pint of flour; one-half teaspoonful of salt; beat the yolks 
of two eggs very light, and mix with a coffee-cupful of milk, and add 
to the flour; lastly, the whites of the eggs, beaten to a stiff froth. 

BKOWN BREAD. 

1. Take two cups of rye meal, two cups of Indian meal, and one- 
half cup of flour; salt, and a teaspoonful of saleratus should be added 
to this; it can be mixed with water, but is nicer when sour milk is 
used; it must be made soft enough to run; bake slow and long. 

2. Four cups sour milk, four cups corn meal, two cups rye meal, 
one-half cup New Orleans molasses, soda to sweeten milk; bake it in 
a deep dish two hours. 

BISCUITS. 
Into a quart of sifted flour put two heaping teaspoonfuls of baking 
powder and a pinch of salt; mix together while dry; then rub into it 
a piece of lard a little larger than an egg; mix with cold sweet milk; 
roll thin; cut with a tin cutter, and bake a light brown in a hot oven; 
send to the table immediately. 

CORN BREAD. 
Two cups of Indian, one cup wheat, 
One cup sour milk, one cup sweet, 
One good egg that well you beat, 
Half a cup molasses, too, 
Half cup sugar add thereto, 
» With one spoon of butter new

And only Tyndall can explain 

The links between corn bread and brain.

in the same dish to rise again, and when risen light and nice, make it 
out into rolls; put them in the tin you wish to bake them in, and let 
them be in a moderately warm place until tea-time; then, if they are

HOW TO COOK OATMEAL. 

Oatmeal is seldom cooked sufficiently. For the coarser oatmeals 
(which are by far the best for mush) measure five or six parts water 
(preferably soft) — yes, measure it, and then you will have it alike every 
time and not be at the trouble of watching it to see if it is of right 
consistency and adding more meal. As soon as the water boils, pour 
in one part meal. These coarse meals do not require stirring up. Let it 
boil up smartly until it sets or is evenly diffused through the water, then 
set it back where it will not boil so fast, and, after half an hour, place 
it where it will hardly simmer. Let it cook half an houi- at least, and 
two hours if possible. If the time is limited, put it to soak before- 
hand, and stir it when heating up. After that it requires no stirring. 
The slimyness often complained of is due to the constant stirring which 
some cooks practice. The surest way to avoid scorching is to cook it 
in a double kettle, or in a tin dish set into a kettle of boiling water, 
then aU the attention it requires is to keep water in the kettle beneath 
and to see that it boils. Disturb as little as possible when dishing, 
and allow it to stand a few minutes before serving. With the Scotch 
and other fine oatmeals, the process is much the same, only they re- 
quire much stirring while setting, and the proportion of meal is much 
greater after that. It is particularly important not to stir them until 
served. The time required to cook them is less, but an hour is none 
too much to get the best results from the Scotch (or Canadian, as it is 
sometimes called). But no amount of cooking will make them equal 
to the coarser kinds in delicacy of flavor. A coffee cup of oatmeal 
will suffice for five or six persons, as the main dish for breakfast. 

OATMEAL JklUSH IMPRO\^D. 
Much better than the old way of stirring the oatmeal into boiling 
water is the new way of cooking it in a farina-kettle. If no farina- 



PUDDINGS. 99 

kettle or steam-cooker is at hand, one may always be improvised in 
this way: Seta stone jar or a tin pail, containing the food to be 
cooked, into a kettle of water, putting a couple of sticks under the jar 
to keep it from coming in contact with the bottom of the kettle.

PUDDINGS. 

In boiling pudding, have plenty of water in the pot boiling when 
the pudding is put in, and do not let it stop; add more as it is needed. 
Turn the pudding frequently. If a cloth is used, dip the pudding 
when done into a pan of cold water, so that it can be removed easily. 

In using molds, grease well with butter, tie the lid closely, and set 
in a pot with very little water, and add more as needed. 

Fruit sauces are nice with blanc-mange and corn-starch puddings. 

Fresh red cherries, stewed, sweetened, and passed through a sieve, 
and slightly thickened with corn starch, make a good sauce. 

Beat the eggs separately. 

If a mold is used for boiling, be sure to have it well greased. 

A bag or cloth should be wrung out of hot water and well floured. 

In boiling, always put the pudding into boiling water, enough to 
cover. 

Boiled and steamed puddings require nearly twice as much time as 
baked. 

APPLE DUMPLINGS. 

Use good-sized rather tart apples, pare and remove the cores; envel- 
ope each separately in pufif-paste, and tie it in a piece of cloth; boil or 
steam for one hour; before serving, remove the cloths, cut a piece from 
each, and put in some sugar and fresh butter; replace the piece of 
paste, and sprinkle with powdered sugar; if preferred, they may be 
served with liquid sauce or sweetened cream. 

APPLE EOLL. 

One pound flour, one-fourth pound of butter, mix with sufficient 
water to make a not very stiff paste; pare and slice rather thick some 
tart apples, roll out the paste as for pie-crust, and spread the sliced 
apples to cover it, sprinkle on a little flour, and roll up as tightly as pos- 
sible without breaking the paste; cook it in a steamer, or wrap in a 
cloth and boil for an hour; serve by cutting across in thin slices, with 
sauce of butter and sugar. 

BROWN-TOP PUDDING. 

Take slices of any kind of rich cake without fruit, make a custard 
of four eggs, one quart of milk, sugar, and flavor to taste; pour over 
the cake, which wiU rise to the top ; bake like custard.

ter made with four tablespoonf uls of flour, three eggs, and one-half pint 
of milk; tie a buttered and floured cloth over the dish — which ought to 
be quite full— and boil the pudding one and a quarter hours; turn it 
out into a hot dish, and strew sugar thickly over it. 

CHARLES' PUDDING. 

One cup of sugar, one tablespoonful of melted butter, one cup 
sweet milk, one egg, one and one-half teaspoonfuls of baking powder;

sweet sauce. 

DYSPEPTICS' PUDDING. 
Boil a cup of rice until it is done soft, then take two eggs, a cup of 
sugar, and one of milk, and stir all together and add to the rice; pare 
six good cooking apples, slice small, and place in bottom of pudding- 
dish, and pour the rice custard over them; place in a moderate oven 
long enough to bake the apples. To be eaten warm, either with or 
without cream. 

DELICIOUS PUDDING. 

Two cups of fine bread crumbs, one and one-half cups white sugar, 
five eggs, one tablespoonful butter, one quart fresh milk, one-half cup 
jelly or jam; rub the butter and one cup of the sugar together; then 
add the beaten yolks of the eggs; beat all to a cream; then add the 
bread crumbs, which have previously been soaked in the milk; bake in 
a pudding-dish (not filling it more than two-thirds full) until the cus- 
tard is " set;" then draw it to the mouth of the oven, and spread over 
the jelly or jam; then cover this with a meringue made of the beaten 
whites and half a cup of sugar; put back in oven, and allow it to re- 
main until the meringue begins to color; to be eaten cold with cold 
cream. This is truly delicious.

fuls baking-powder, two tablespoons melted butter, few dried currants; 
steam three-quarters of an hour; to be eaten with sauce. One-half

and half a teaspoonful of soda, or a teaspoonful of baking-powder; 
bake in a buttered pan for twenty minutes. 

BAKED INDIAN PUDDING. 

1. Into one quart of boiling milk, stir a half pint of corn meal; when 
cold, add one-half cup of sugar, tablespoonful of butter, one cup of 
raisins, and four eggs well beaten; mix well, and bake an hour and a 
half.

spoonful of Indian meal, cool a little and add three eggs well 
beaten, one pint of cold milk, one tablespoonful of flour, one-half 
cup of sugar, one cup of molasses, one teaspoonful of ginger, one of

spoonful saleratus dissolved in the milk; then sift in dry corn meal until 
of the consistency as if for griddle-cakes— perhaps a little thicker; stir 
in a teacup of dried fruit — cherries are the best; put in a bag and boil 
one hour. For sauce, sweetened cream flavored with nutmeg. 

BROWN BETTY. 

Grease a pudding-dish; put into this a layer of nice cooking apples 
sliced, then a laj^er of bread crumbs, with sugar sprinkled over, and 
small bits of butter. For three apples use one cup of bread crumbs, 
one-half cup sugar, and a piece of butter the size of an egg. Put a 
layer of bread crumbs on top; bake. It is nice either with or without 
cream. 

HEN'S NEST. 
Make blanc mange; pour in egg-shells and set to cool; when cold 
break the egg-shells, place in a glass dish, cut strips of lemon peel, let 
them boil in a syrup of sugar and water till they are tender, and sprin- 
kle them over the egg shapes, and make a custard and pour over all. 

GOOSEBERRY CREAM. 
Take a quart of gooseberries, and boil them very quick in enough 
water to cover them; stir in half an ounce of good butter, and when 
they become soft pulp them through a sieve; sweeten the pulp while it

is hot, and then beat it up with the yolks of four eggs ; serve in a dish 
or glass cup. 

LIQUID SAUCE FOE PUDDINGS. 

One cup of sugar and one-third cup of butter rubbed to a cream: 
then stir in the well-beaten white of an egg; flavor with lemon or nut- 
meg; add one cup of boiling water, and mix just before bringing to 
the table. 

CEACKED WHEAT. 

This excellent dish is often spoiled by very good cooks, who think 
they- must stir it all the time to keep it from burning. Too much stir- 
ring makes it like paste; putting in more water when nearly done has 
the same effect. One-third of wheat by measure to two-thirds of water, 
soft if 5'ou have it, will make it about right; the water should be cold 
when the wheat is put in ; it should cook slowly and be covered closely. 
In this way scarcely any stirring will be found necessary. There is a 
deliciousness in this dish, when cooked as above, which is never found 
if stirred while cooking. The same may be said of oatmeal, only the 
latter should be quickly stirred into hoiling water; cover closely, and let 
cook for about twenty minutes. Wheat may be cooked about the same 
time, although it bears cooking longer. 

EOLEY-POLEY. 
Make a good biscuit dough, and roll about three-quarters of an inch 
thick, and spread with berries, preserves, or slices of apple; roll up,

PASTRY. 

For pastry use the best of materials. 

In warm weather keep the paste in the refrigerator until wanted, 
and bake in a hot oven. 

A well-beaten egg rubbed with a bit of cloth over the lower crust of 
pies will prevent the juice from soaking through it. 

Puff paste should always be made of sweet, solid butter. 

The juice of fruit pies, if thickened with a little corn starch, will not 
^'hoil over." 

In making a good pastry it is necessary to have the butter sweet, 
the lard fresh; the flour should be of the best quality, and sifted; the 
water for wetting as cold as possible — ice water preferable. In rolling 
the crust roll always one way, and bake in a quick oven. 

PASTEY. 
To one cup of water take one-half cup of lard, a little salt, and some 
flour; mix together with a knife. When stiff enough roll out on a 
board, spread on with a knife a layer of lard, and sift over a little flour; 
roll all together, and then roll out on the board again, repeating this 
three or four times. The entire amount of lard used for one cup of 
water should be about two cups. 

PUFF PASTE. 

1. One pound of flour, one pound of butter, one egg; mix the flour 
with a lump of butter the size of an egg, and the egg to a very stiff 
paste with cold water; divide the butter into six equal parts, roll the 
paste, and spread on one part of the butter, dredging it with flour. 
Eepeat until aU the butter is rolled in. 

2. Take one pound of sifted floui*, on which sprinkle a very little 
sugar; take the yolks of one or two eggs and beat into them a little ice 
water, and pour gently into the center of the flour, and work into a 
firm paste, adding water as it is necessary; divide three-quarters of a 
pound or a pound of firm, solid butter, as you prefer, into three parts; 
roll out the paste, and spread one part of the butter on half of the 
paste; fold the other half over, and roll out again, repeating the pro- 
cess until the butter is all roUed in; then set the paste on the ice for 
fifteen or twenty minutes, after which roll out again three times, each 
time rolling in the opposita direction; then put on the ice again until 
cold, when it is ready for use. It will keep several days in a refriger- 
ator, but should not freeze. 

APPLE TAETS. 
Pare, quarter, core, and boil in a half teacup of water untU very soft, 
ten large apples; beat till very smooth, then add the yolks of six eggs

crust, spread one cup of sugar over the lemon ; then add one cup of 
paste, made by taking four tablespoonfuls of flour, wetting it with cold 
water the same as you would do to make starch; turn boiling water on 
it, stirring while cooking on the stove for a few moments, adding a 
pinch of salt, with the grated rind of the lemons. When thickened

CAKES. 

Use the best materials, and have everything ready before you begin 
mixing the materials. Always sift the flour, adding to it the baking- 
powder and mixing weU. If it is summer weather, lay the eggs in cold 
water for a few minutes, and beat yolks and whites separately, very 
thoroughly. Mix butter and sugar to a cream, then add sugar, then 
the yolks of the eggs, then the milk and flour alternately in small 
quantities, then the whites. 

If fruit is used flour it well, and add the last thing. 

Bake slowly at first. 

Cookies, jumbies, ginger-snaps, etc., require a quick oven; if they 
become moist or soft by keeping, put again into the oven a few 
minutes. 

While the cake is baking no air must be permitted to get into the 
oven, unless when necessary to look at the cake, as it is apt to make 
it fall. The heat of the oven should be even and regular. When cake 
is done, it can be tested by sticking a clean straw into it. If nothing 
adheres to the straw, the cake is done,

spoonful of soda; lemon to flavor. After aU is well mixed, add cue- 
half cup cold water.

lump and add four eggs. Beat well, and then drop on a buttered tin 
in neat, compact little " dabs;" far enough apart not to touch when 
they rise. Have the oven about as hot as for cookies, and in turning 
them lift up the tin. If you shove them before they are set you will 
have i^an-cakes. They should be hollow balls. Bake them long 
enough so they will not fall when removed, and cool them on brown 
paper as quickly as possible, so they won't sweat. To fill them take 
one-half pint milk, two beaten eggs, one-quarter cup of flour or com 
starch wet smoothly, one cup sugar, lemon or vanilla flavor; cook it in 
a tin pail in a kettle of hot water, and stir it so it will be smooth.

sifted sugar, one cup sifted flour, one teaspoonful cream of tartar; put 
into rings, and bake quick.

bake for half an hour in oven, and with a moderate fire, in a round or 
square pan, according to taste. 

STRAWBERKY SHORT-CAKE. 

First prepare the berries by picking; after they have been well 
washed — the best way to wash them is to hold the boxes under the 
faucet and let a gentle stream of water run over them into an earthen 
bowl— then drain and pick them into an earthen bowl; now take the 
potato-masher and bruise them, and cover with a thick layer of white 
sugar; now set them aside until the cake is made. Take a quart of 
sifted flour, one-half cup of sweet butter, one egg well beaten, three 
teaspoonfuls of baking powder, and milk enough to make a rather stifE 
dough; knead well, and roll with the rolling-pin till about one inch 
thick; bake till a nice brown, and when done remove it to the table, 
turn it out of the pan, and with a light, sharp knife cut it down length- 
wise and crossways; now run the knife through it, and lay it open for 
a few moments, just to let the steam escape (the steam ruins the color 
of the berries); then set the bottom crust on the platter, cover thickly 
with berries an inch and a half deep ; lay the top crust on the fruit, 
dust thickly with powdered sugar, and if any berry juice is left in the 
bowl, pour it round the cake, not over it, and you will have a delicious 
short-cake.

♦->-4«M-* 

TEA, COFFEE, CHOCOLATE.. 

TEA. 
People must consult tlieir own taste as to kind of tea. Mixed is the 
best to use with ice. Allow one teaspoonful for each person. Use 
boiling water, but do not boil the tea, and use while fresh. Tea is 
best made in an earthen tea pot — never in tin. Iced tea should be 
made several hours before it is needed, and then set upon ice. When 
ready to use it, sweeten, and di'ink without milk or cream. Use cracked 
ice to put into the glass. 

VIENNA COFFEE. 
Leach or filter the coffee through a French filterer, or any of the 
many coffee pots that filter instead of boiling the coffee; allow one 
tablespoonful of ground coffee to each person, and one extra for the 
pot. Put one quart of cream into a milk-boiler, or, if you have none, 
into a pitcher in a pail of boiling water; put it where the water will 
keep boiling, beat the white of an egg to a froth, then add to the egg 
three tablespoonfuls of cold milk, mix the egg and cold milk thor- 
oughly together; when hot, remove the cream from the fire, and add 
the egg and cold milk; stir it all together briskly for a minute or two, 
and then ser 

COFFEE. 

Make a flannel bag, hem the top, and run through it a small wire, 

by which the bag may be suspended in the pot, so that the bottom of 

the bag comes within two inches of the bottom of the pot. Grind the 

coffee fine and put into the bag, then pour the proper quantity of 



FRESH FRUITS. 155 

water through the bag into the pot; let the water be boiling when 
poured in; then set the pot back where it can simmer gently fifteen 
minutes, and you have good coffee, without egg-shells or cold water to 
settle it. Coffee that needs settling is not properly made. The flannel 
bag should be made of flannel so fine that the coffee will not sift 
through. 

CHOCOLATE. 

1, Take one and one-half quarts of good milk, and one-half pint of 
cream, to one-fourth of a pound of grated chocolate ; let the milk and 
cream come to a scald. After mixing the chocolate with a little cold 
milk, stir it into the scalding milk and let it simmer tor fifteen minutes, 
adding one-fourth of a cup of sugar, and stirring occasionally. 

2. Scrape two sticks of chocolate, and boil in half a cup of water. 
Stir to a smooth paste. Sweeten a pint of milk with loaf sugar, and, 
when boning, pour on to the chocolate and let it boil together a few 
seconds, stirring it well. Serve immediately. Some persons prefer a 
little water instead of all milk. Sweeten a little cream and whip to a 
froth, and place on the top of each cup. 

MOCK CREAM FOR TEA OR COFFEE. 
To a pint of milk, take the yolk of one egg; put on the fire and let it 
come to a scald. It is improved by adding a little cream when it is 
cool. 



FRESH FRUITS. 

TO CRYSTAI.LIZE FRUIT. 
Pick out the finest of any kind of fruit, leave in the stones ; beat the 
whites of three eggs to a stiff froth ; lay the fruit in the beaten egg, 
with the stem upward; drain them and beat the part that drips off 
again ; select them out, one by one, and dip them into a cup of finely- 
powdered sugar; cover a pan with a sheet of fine paper, place the fruit 
on it, and set it in a cool oven; when the icing on the fruit becomes 
firm, pile them on a dish, and set them in a cold place. 

PINE- APPLES. 
Slice on a slaw-cutter, or very thin with a knife ; mix with very fine- 
ly-powdered sugar. Set on ice till ready to serve. 

ORANGES. 
Slice, mix with powdered sugar, and strew grated cocoa-nut over the 
top. Are also nice served whole, the skins quartered and turned down. 
Form in a pyramid with bananas and white grapes. 

MELONS. 
Melons are much nicer if kept on ice until time for serving. Cut off 
a slice at each end of the water-melon, then cut through the center; 
stand on end on a platter. Cantaloupe melons should have the seeds 



156 TEE PEOPLE'S COOK BOOK. 

removed before sending to the table. Eat with a spoonful of strained 
honey in each half of melon, 

BANANAS AND CEEAM. 

Peel, slice, and heap up in a glass dessert-dish, and serve raw, with 
fine sugar and cream. 



JELLIES, JAMS, PRESERVES, ETC. 

GENEEAL HINTS. 

A flannel bag is the best for straining jelly. If possible, avoid put- 
ting jelly in any stage in a metal vessel. For every pint of strained 
juice, allow a pound of sugar. Granulated sugar is the best. 

In all cases it is best to boil the juice fifteen minutes before adding 
the sugar, thus insuring the necessary evaporation, and avoiding the 
liability to burn it. 

It is well also to beat the sugar before it is added, as, in so doing, the 
boiling process will not be interrupted. 

All jelly should be made over a moderate fire, and be carefully 
watched and skimmed. 

In making preserves, there must be no economy of time and care, 
and the fruit must be fresh. 

Boil without covering, and very gently. 

Jellies and jams must not be covered and put away until cold. 

Marmalades require constant stirring. 

In making jams, boil the fruit fifteen minutes before adding the su- 
gar. Mash the fruit before cooking. 

JELLIED APPLES. 
Peel and core, whole, small-sized apples; put them into water enough 
to cover, with some lemons, and boil until tender, and then take out; 
make a syrup of one-half pound of sugar to one poimd of fruit, and 
put apples and lemons, sliced, into the s^Tup, and boil very gently 
until clear, and then skim out into a deep dish; to the syrup add an 
ounce of isinglass or gelatine dissolved in a little water, and let it boil 
a moment; garnish the apples with the lemon slices, and strain the 
syrup over them. 

APPLE JELLY. 

1. Peel two dozen golden pippins or Margills, boil them with one 
quart of water and half an ounce of isinglass; when the isinglass is 
dissolved, and the apples reduced to a pulp, strain; add the juice of a 
lemon and the grated rind with a pound and a quarter of loaf sugar; 
boil together twenty minutes, and strain. It is served at the table for 
sweetening apple pies. 

2. Quarter the apples and cover them with water; cook and strain 
them, and to a pint of juice put three-fourths of a pound of sugar; 
boil twenty minutes, and flavor with lemon or vanilla. 



JELLIES, JAMS, PBESEBVES, ETC. 157 

* 

CRAB APPLE JELLY. 

1. Procure the Siberian crab, pick out those that are perfectly firm; 
■wash in water, and pour over them just enough water to cover; let 
them cook until soft, then strain through a jelly-bag; add one pound 
of sugar to one pint of juice; let boil twenty minutes. 

2. Take good, sound crab apples; cut in half; take out stems and 
blossoms; put in preserving kettle, and pour in cold water till the 
crab apples are entirely covered; then place it over a slow fire, and 
allow it to come to the boiling point, or until the apples are quite soft; 
strain them through a colander (not the pulp, but simply the juice) 
into an earthen vessel, and let it stand over-night; in the morning 
strain with care through a flannel jelly-bag, and measure; place it 
again in the preserving kettle, and allow it to come slowly to boiling 
point; let it boil for fifteen minutes, and meanwhile skim with care; for 
every pint of this juice when strained, allow one pound of granulated 
sugar; place the sugar in a warm oven in shallow pans or plates, and 
heat; take care not to have it warm enough to melt; when the juice 
has boiled fifteen minutes pour in the warm sugar, and let all boil 
together about five minutes more; then take from the fire and pour 
into jelly-glasses or bowls. 

CURRANT JELLY. 

1. Mash the currants without heating, having removed them from 
the stems; strain through a flannel bag; measure hy pints, and place 
over the fire, in preserving kettle; let it boil fifteen minutes, carefully 
skimming; then for every pint of juice add a pound of heated sugar, 
and boil ten minutes longer, put in glasses or bowls, and seal. 

2. This recipe has three advantages: First, it never fails, as the old 
plan is sure to do five times out of eight; secondly, it requires but half 
the usual quantity of sugar, and so retains the grateful acidity and 
peculiar flavor of the fruit; thirdly, it is by far less troublesome than 
the usual method. Weigh the currants without taking the trouble to 
remove the stems; do not wash them, but carefully remove leaves and 
whatever may adhere to them; to each pound of fruit allow half the 
weight of granulated or pure loaf sugar; put a few currants into a por- 
celain-lined kettle, and press them with a potato-masher, or anything 
convenient, in order to secure sufiScient liquid to prevent burning, 
then add the remainder of the fruit, and boil freely for twenty minutes; 
stirring occasionally to prevent burning; take out and strain carefully 
through a tbree-cornered bag of strong close texture, putting the liquid 
into either earthen or wooden vessels — never in tin, as the action of 
the acid on tin materially affects both color and flavor; when strained, 
return the liquid to the kettle, without the trouble of measuring, and 
let it boil thoroughly for a moment or so, and then add the sugar; the 
moment the sugar is entirely dissolved, the jelly is done, and must 
be immediately dished, or placed in glasses; it will jelly upon the side 
of the cup as it is taken up. leaving no doubt as to the result. Gather 
the fruit early, as soon as fully ripe, since the pulp softens, and the 
juice is less rich if allowed to remain long after ripening. In our 
climate, the first week in July is usually considered the time to make 
currant jelly. Never gather currants or other soft or small seed fruit 



158 THE PEOPLE'S COOK BOOK. 

immediately after a rain for preserving purposes, as they are greatly 
impoverished by the moisture absorbed. In preserving all fruits of 
this class, if they are boiled until tender or transparent in a small qiian- 
tity of water, and the sugar is added afterward, the hardness of the 
seeds, so objectionable in small fruits, will thus be avoided. A 
delicious jam may be made of blackberries, ciarrants, and raspberries, or 
with currants with a few raspberries to flavor, by observing the above 
suggestion, and adding sugar, pound for pound, and boiling about 
twenty minutes. 

CUKEANT JELLY WITHOUT COOKING. 

Press the juice from the currants, and strain it; to every pint put a 
pound of fine white sugar; mix them together until the sugar is dis- 
solved; then put it in jars; seal them, and expose to a hot sun for two 
or three days. 

GRAPE JELLY. 
Grapes to be used before they are ripe — when just turning. Stem 
the grapes, and slightly cook them; then strain and take a pint of sugar 
to a pint of juice. It makes the jelly of a light-red color, and Diuch 
finer flavored than ripe grapes 

APPLE JAM. 

Ten pounds of best cooking apples, pare and slice; seven pounds of 
loaf sugar, the juica of three lemons, rind of one lemon, boil together 
slowh% stir, and mash well; when they become clear, put into molds. 
The apples should be put in water, to preserve their color, 

APPLE PFvESEE\^S. 
Take three-quarters of a pound of sugar to a pound of apples, make 
a syrup of the sugar and water, in which root ginger has been boiled 
until strongly flavored; add a few slices of lemon, and when the syrup 
is clear add the apples, a few at a time, and cook until transparent; 
pour the syrup over the apples when cold. 

CHEEEY JAM. 
To each pound of cherries allow three-quarters of a pound of sugar; 
stone them, and as you do so throw the sugar gradually into the dish 
with them; cover them, and let them set over night; next day boil 
slowly until the cherries and sugar form a smooth, thick mass ; put up 
in jars. 

DAMSON PEESEEYES. 

To four pounds of damsons use three pounds of sugar; prick each 
damson with a needle; dissolve the sugar with one-half pint of water, 
and put it on the fire; when it simmers put in as many damsons as 
will lie on the toj); when they oj^en take them out and lay them on a 
dish, and put others in, and so on until all have been in; then put 
them all in the kettle together and let them stew until done ; put them 
in jars, and seal them. 



JELLIES, JAMS, PRESERVES, ETC, 159 

GEEEN GAGE PKESERVES. 
When the fruit is ripe wipe them clean, and to one pound of fruit 
put one-quarter pound of sugar, which will make a fine syrup; boil the 
fruit until it is perfectly done in this syrup; then make a fresh syrup 
of one pound of fruit to one pound, of sugar; moisten the sugar with 
water; when the syrup boiis put in the fniit and leave for fifteen min- 
utes; then put the fruit in jars; boil the syrup until thick, and when 
only milk-warm pour it over the fruit; tie the jars tightly, and keep in 
a warm, J) lace. 

CITEON PEESEEVES. 

Pare, core, and slice, or cut into fancy shapes; allow one pound of 
sugar to one pound of fruit; flavor with lemon and ginger root; slice 
the lemon and boil in water until clear; save the water, and put the 
lemon in cold water until needed; put the ginger root into water, and 
boil until the water is sufficiently flavored, and then remove; put the 
sugar into the ginger water and boil and skim very thoroughly; then 
put in the citron and juice of the lemons, and boil until transparent, 
when almost done add the lemon slices; skim out the citron carefully, 
and pour the syrup over them. 

GEAPE PEESEEVES. 

Press with the fingers the pulp from the fruit; put the pulp on the 
fire and boil ; then press the whole through a colander or sieve to re- 
move the seeds; put juice, pulp, and skins together, and to every pint 
add a pound of sugar, and boil until thick. 

NONPAEIEL PEESEEVES. 

Take cucumbers, as near uniform size as possible, about half grown, 
and lay in strong brine for six or seven days; wash and soak them 
twenty -four hours in clear water, changing it three or four times; take 
a metal kettle and line it with grape leaves, lay in the cucumbers with 
some alum sprinkled in, and cover with clear water and vine leaves; 
then cover the kettle close, and green them as for pickles, but not boil 
them; when greened jDut them in ice water; after they have become 
perfectly cold slit them open on one side, and with a small knife take 
out the seeds; then stuff them with a mixture of chopped citron and 
raisins, then sew up ; weigh them, and for every pound of cucumbers 
allow a pound of sugar and a pint of water; let the water and sugar 
boil, and after thoroughly skimming it drop in the cucumbers; let 
them boil slowly for half an hour, and then take them out and put in 
the sun on a shallow dish, and allow the syrup to boil down, after which 
add some few slices of ginger root, put back the cucumbers and let all 
boil again about five minutes; take out, put in glass jars, and seal cold. 
These sweetmeats improve with age. 

PINEAPPLE PEESEEVES. 
Pare and core and cut in small slices on a slaw-cutter; to a pound of 
pineapple put one pound of sugar; let it boil twenty minutes; i)ut in 
jars, and cover with egg-papers. 



160 THE PEOPLE'S COOK BOOK. 

PINEAPPLE JAM. 

Pare, core, and grate fine on a grater; then proceed the same as for 
pineapjDle preserves. 

PLUM BUTTEK. 

One peck of plums, one-half* bushel of sweet apples; cook the ap- 
ples and plums in separate kettles until quite soft, only putting in 
enough water to prevent sticking to the bottom of the kettle; when 
soft put through a colander, and then to each pound of mixtvire allow 
three-fourths of a pound of white sugar; let it cook for a short time, 
and bottle. 

PEAR PPtESEE\TES. 
Preserve as directed for quince preserves, and flavor with ginger root 
and lemon, or with a few cloves stuck into the fruit. 

PEACH PIIESER\TES. 

Pare the fruit carefully, and remove the pits; boil the pits in water 
Tin til all the flavor is extracted, allowing one-half a pint for each pound 
of fruit; add more as it evapor^es; add the sugar; skim carefully, and 
when clear add the peaches, a Tew at a time; cook gently for twelve 
minutes, and then skim out carefully, and add more until all are done; 
then pour the syrup over the whole; the next day drain off the syrup, 
and boil a few minutes, and pour again over the fi*uit; repeat this for 
three or four daj's in succession until the fruit is clear. 

PLUM PEESEE^^ES. 
Wash and prick the plums and lay in a stone jar; allow a pound of 
sugar to a pound of fruit; make a rich syrup, and pour, while hot, 
over the plums, and cover closely; drain off and boil the syrup for 
four successive days, and put altogether in the kettle and boil for half 
an hour. 

QUINCE PEESEEVES. 
Pare, core, and quarter the fruit ; boil in clear water enough to cover 
until they are tender; make a syrup with two pounds of sugar and a 
pint of w*ter; when boiling hot, add the quinces; allow three-quarters 
of a pound of sugar to a pound of fruit; use jDarings and cores for 
jeUy. 

STEAWBEEEY OE EASPBEEEY JAM. 
To one pound of berries, allow one and one-quarter pounds of sugar; 
heat an earthen bowl hot on the stove, then remove it from the stove 
and put into it the berries and sugar, and beat them hard \sdth a 
wooden spoon for as much as an hour and a half; do not cook at aU; 
put in jars with egg papers. 

EASPBEEEY J^I. 
Allow one pound of sugar to a poufld of berries, and one pint of 
currant juice to five pounds of berries, adding one extra pound of 
sugar for each pint of currant juice; mix the berries and sugar in lay- 
ers, then mash the berries with potato-masher; add currant juice, and 



JELLIES, JAMS, PRESERVES, ETC. 161 

let boil one-half hour; put in tumblers, cover with egg-papers, while 
hot; make blackberry, strawberry, and currant jam the same way 
omitting the currant juice. 

TO PKESERVE WATEEIVIELON RINDS. 

1. _ Soak the fruit in salt water three days, in fresh water three days 
boil m alum water; soak in fi-esh water over a day and night, changin*^ 
the water several times; boil in ginger water; to one pound of fruit'' 
one and one-fourth pounds of sugar, and put in ginger and mace- flavor 
with oil of lemon. 

2. After cutting your rind properly, boil it in clean water, with vine 
leaves between each layer; a piece of alum, the size of a hickory nut 
is suflacient for a kettleful; after boiling it, put it into ice-water to 
cool; then rep.^at this a second time, each time putting it to cool; each 
time boiling one hour; prepare the syrup with one and one-fourth 
pounds of sugar to each pound of fruit; green ginger boiled in the 
water you make your sjTup with, flavors it, or three lemons to six 
pounds of fruit; if the syrup thickens too fast, add a little water. The 
rind should be boiled in the water untill clear and green. 

APPLE lilAEMALADE. 

Twelve pounds of apples, three pounds of brown sugar, three lem- 
ons; boil slowly; mash well. 

OBANGE MAEMALADE. 

Separate the pulp from the skin; boil the skins until very tender, 
then chop fine; separate as much as possible the white part from the 
yellow— using only the yellow- then to every pound of pulp and skins 
add one pound of sugar, and boil twenty minutes. 

2. Allow three-fourths of a pound of sugar to a pound of fruit; 
peel and quarter the oranges; remove carefully the inner skin from' 
the peels, and boil in a large quantity of water for two hours, changing 
the water, and renewing with hot; then cut into fine shreds; press the 
mside of oranges through a sieve; put into the preserving kettle with 
a little water, and after it has boiled a few moments, add the su- 
gar and shredded peel, and boil twenty minutes; the rind and iuice of 
lemons in the proportion of one to five is an improvement.* 

PEACH MARMALADE. 

Use three-fourths of a pound of sugar to a pound of fruit; boil the 
pits until the water is well flavored; peel and quarter the peaches and 
add to the water boiling, half an hour before adding the sugar- stir 
constantly; boil an hour after adding the sugar. ' 

QUINCE IVIAEMALADE. 

Ten pounds of ripe, yellow quinces, wash clean, pare, and core them, 
and cut them into small pieces. To each pound of quinces, allow half 
a pound of white sugar; put the parings and cores into a kettle, with 
enough water to cover them; boil slowly until quite soft; then having 
put the quinces with the sugar into a porcelain kettle, strain over them 
through a cloth, the liquid from the parings, and cover; boil the whole 
over a clear fire until it becomes quite smooth and thick, keeping it 



162 THE PEOPLE'S COOK BOOK. 

covered except when you are skimming it, and watching and stirring 
closely to prevent sticking at the bottom; when cold, put in glass jars. 

CKEAMATED APPLES. 

Choose apples that will cook nicely, that is, will cook without break- 
ing into pieces; pare and core them whole; make a syrup with a pound 
of sugar and a pint of water; put in the apjjles and boil gently until 
about three-fourths done ; skim them out, and place them for a few 
minutes in a quick oven; boil down the syruj), and when the apples 
are taken from the oven and are still hot, fill the center with marma- 
lade, and roll each apple in the syrup; put them on a dish in the form 
of a dome, or as you may desire, and poiu' over them a meringue of 
eggs and sugar, and set into the oven to brown. 

JELLIED OKANGES. 
Boil small oranges in water until they can be easily pierced with a 
straw, and then cut in quarters; allow half a pound of sugar to a pound 
of fruit, and make a clear syrup; put in the fruit and cook over a slow 
fire until the fruit is clear; then stir in an ounce of isinglass and let it 
boil again; first take out the oranges and strain the jelly over them. 

PIE PLANT. 

Cut in pieces, put into a baking-dish in layers, with an equal weight 
of sugar; cover closely and bake. 

APPLE BUTTER. 

Fill a very large kettle with cider, and boil it until reduced to one- 
half of the original quantity; then have ready some fine, juicy apples, 
pared, cored, and quartered, and put as many into the kettle as can be 
kept moist by the cider; stir it frequently, and when the apples are 
stewed quite soft take them out with a skimmer that has holes in it, 
and put them into a tub; then add more apples to the cider, and stew 
them soft in the same manner, stirring them nearly all the time with a 
stick; have at hand some more boiled cider to thin the apple butter, in 
case you ^hould find it too thick in the bottle; at night leave the apples 
to cool in a tub, covered with cloths, and finish the next day by boiling 
the apples and cider till the consistence is that of soft marmalade, and 
the color a very dark brown ; twenty minutes or one-half hour before 
you finally take from the fire, add powdered cinnamon, cloves, and nut- 
meg to your taste; if the spice is boiled too long it will lose its flavor; 
when cold put into stone jars, and cover closely; it must not be boiled 
in a brass or metal kettle, on account of the verdigi'is which the acid 
will collect in it, and which will render the aj)ple butter extremely un- 
wholesome, not to say poisonous. 

2. One-half bushel of j^ippin apples, one gallon of sweet, fresh ci- 
der; cook thoroughly, and put through a colander; place on the fire, 
and add six pounds of white sugar; stir constantly Mhile cooking, to 
prevent burning; in the course of two or three hours take a little out 
in a dish, and if it has a watery appearance it should be cooked longer, 
or until quite thick. 



CANNED FRUITS, VEGETABLES, ETC. 1G3 

LEMON BUTTER. 

The grated rind and juice of three lemons, three-fourth's of a pound 
of sugar, one-half pound of butter, five eggs; beat eggs and sugar well; 
then add the juice, rind, and butter; mix well, and set over a kettle of 
boiling water till it is as thick as honey; stir it occasionally while 
cooking. 

PEACH BUTTER. 

To one bushel of peaches allow from eight to ten pounds of granu- 
lated sugar; pare and halve the peaches, put into the kettle, and stir 
constantly, to prevent sticking to the kettle, until perfectly smooth and 
rather thick; a part of the peach stones thrown in and cooked with the 
peaches give it a nice flavor, and they can be afterward skimmed out; 
add the sugar a short time before taking from the fire; put in jars, and 
cover tight; peaches for butter should be neither too mealy nor too 
juicy. 



CANHEB FRUIT, VEGETABLES, ETC. 

All fi-uits should be fresh and ripe; granulated sugar should always 
be used, and also a porcelain kettle. Put the bottles in a pan or kettle 
of cold water, place on the stove until the water is boiling before filling 
with the fruit. Do not use an iron spoon. In preserving allow a pound 
of sugar to one pound of fruit; these can be put in jars with egg-pa- 
pers. In canning fruit great care should be taken to have the jars per- 
fectly air tight. Keep in cool, dark place. 

CHERRIES. 

Take Musilla cherries, wash and remove the pits; allow a pound of 
sugar to one pound of fruit; make a syrup of sugar with the juice and 
sufficient water to cover the cherries ; boil from five to ten minutes ; 
turn into bottles and seal. Some prefer one pint of sugar to one quart 
of pitted cherries. 

BLACK RASPBERRIES AND BLACKBERRIES. 
•To one quart of berries allow one pint of sugar; boil fifteen min- 
utes, and put in air-tight jars. 

GREEN GAGE PLUMS. 

After stemirving and washing the fruit, fill the jars full, placing them 
in a boiler of cold water, just enough not to have the water boil over 
the top of the jars into the fruit; after boiling one-half hour, or until 
the fruit begins to be tender, lift out the jars, and turn oS. the juice 
that may accumulate into a porcelain kettle, and sufficient sugar to 
make a rich syrup; when it boils fill up the jars, let them stand in the 
boiling w^ater ten or fifteen minutes longer; then lift out, one at a time, 
and seal. All kinds of plums are nice put up in the same manner. 



164 THE PEOPLE'S COOK BOOK. 

GKAPES. 

Stew, wash, and weigh the fruit. For preserves add one pound of 
sugar to a pound of fruit; for canning, one-half pound of sugar to a 
pound of fruit, and remove the pulp ; put the skins and pulp into sep- 
arate dishes, cook the pulp and strain through a sieve; then add the. 
skins and sugar. For canning cook fifteen minutes; for preserving, a 
little longer. 

TO CAN PEACHES. 
Pare and halve the peaches ; pack them in tin cans as close as they 
can possibly be put; make a syrup of six pounds of sugar to one 
gallon of cold water; let this stand until well dissolved; then pour 
the cold syrup over the peaches until the cans are even full, after which 
solder perfectly tight, place the cans in a boiler, cover well with cold 
water, set it on the fire and let the water boil five minutes, then take 
the cans out and turn them upside down; one gallon syrup will do one 
dozen cans. 

* EICH CANNED PEACHES. 
Pare and stone peaches, about enough for two jars at a time; if many 
are pared they will become dark colored standing; rinse in cold water, 
then cook in a rich syrup of sugar and water about fifteen or twenty 
minutes, or until they are clear; put into your jars all that are not 
broken; fill up with the hot syrup, about as thick as ordinary molasses, 
and seal. Same syrup will do to cook two or three more jars. After 
the syrup becomes dark this, with the broken peaches, can be used for 
marmalade or peach butter. Same rule can be used for pears, plums, 
and all light fruit that you desire rich. 

CANNED PEACHES. 
Peel and quarter choice peaches — to peel, place in a wire basket, dip 
into boiling water a moment, and then into cold water, and strip otf 
the skins — have a porcelain kettle with boiling water, and another with 
syrup made with granulated sugar; drop the peaches into boiling water 
—some previously boil the pits in the water for their flavor— and let 
them cook until tender, and then lift out carefully into a can. pouring 
over them all the syrup the can will hold, and seal immediately. Cook 
only peaches enough to fill one can at a time. Plums are canned in 
the same manner. 

QUINCES. 

Select fair, nice apple quinces (the inferior ones can be used for jelly 
or marmalade), pare and cut in quarters, removing the core; for each 
pound of them, take three-quarters of a pound of sugar, a quart of 
cold water; dissolve the sugar in the water over a moderate fire; let it 
boil, then remove from the fire; when cool, put in the quinces. If 
there is not more than enough water to cover them, more should be 
added so the syrup will be thin. If too rich, the quinces will be hard 
and shrink. Boil them gently until a broom straw will go through them 
easily. Keep them covered while boiling, that they may be light-col- 
ored. Put in bottles and seal. 



PICKLES. 165 

STRAWBERRIES. 
Procure fresh, large strawberries, when in their prime, but not so 
ripe as to be very soft; hull and weigh them; take an equal weight of 
sugar, make a syrup, and, when boiling hot, put in the berries. A 
small quantity should be done at once. If crowded they will become 
mashed. Let them boil about twenty minutes or a half an hour; turn 
into tumblers or small jars, and seal with egg papers while hot. 

CANNED STRAWBERRIES. 
Fill glass jars with fresh strawberries, sprinkled with sugar, allow- 
ing a little over one-quarter of a pound of sugar to one pound of ber- 
ries ; set the jars in a boiler, with a little hay laid in the bottom to pre- 
vent the jars from breaking, filled with cold water to within an inch or 
two of the tops of the jars; let them boil fifteen minutes; then move 
back, and wrap the hand in a towel, and take out the jars; fill the jars 
to the top before sealing, using one or more jars for the purpose. 

CORN. 

Fill the cans with the uncooked corn (freshly gathered) cut from the 
cob, and seal them hermetically; surround them with straw to prevent 
them striking against each other, and put them into a boiler over the 
fire, with enough cold water to cover them ; Jieat the water gradually, 
and when they have boiled an hour and a half, puncture the tops of 
the cans to allow the escape of gases, then seal them immediately 
while they are still hot; continue to boil them for two hours and a 
half. 

CANNED TOMATOES. 

Pour hot water over the tomatoes to remove the skins, and then 
slice; put into a porcelain kettle and cook for a few minutes; have the 
cans filled with hot water on the hearth; when the tomatoes are suffi- 
ciently cooked, empty the cans and fill them with tomatoes, and seal 
immediately. 

STRING BEANS. 

Remove the strings at the sides, and cut into pieces about an inch 
long, put them into boiling water and scald, then can them. 



PICKLES. 

CUCUMBERS. 
1. Take small cucumbers, put them in a large stone jar; to a four gal- 
lon jar full put water enough to cover; one quart of salt, and alum the 
size of a walnut; turn off the brine, and scald every day, putting it on 
boiling hot, for nine days; then wash and soak over night, if too salt; 
put into jars or bottles; add whole cinnamon, cloves, mace, allspice, 
and peppers (green peppers preferred) ; scald the vinegar, and pour on 
hot. 



1G6 THE PEOPLE'S COOK BOOK. 

2. Make a brine of salt and -water, put in the cucumbers; and kt 
tbem remain nine days, pouring off the brine and scalding it every 
second daj^; on the ninth day, take some cider vinegar, which, if very 
strong, dilute with one-third water; have it boiling hot, and pour over 
the pickles, having first covered them with vine or cabbage leaves; then 
take cider vinegar, and sweeten, saj', from one and one-half pounds 
to two and a half pounds of sugar to one gallon of vinegar; have ready 
the spices, and put all into the vinegar; while heating, turn off the 
first vinegar, and pour this over them; exclude them entirely from the 
air. If liked, add grated horse-radish. 

CUCUMBER PICKLES. 
Lay the encumbers in good brine for twenty-four hours, then take 
them out and scald them in equal parts of vinegar and water, (a brass 
kettle is best) in alternate layers of pickles and grape-vine leaves, then 
put them in a jar, and pour the hot vinegar and water over them; let 
them stand over night; then take the vinegar and water and pour over 
again for three successive days; at the end of that time, pour off the 
old vinegar and cover the pickles with fresh vinegar, and add small red 
peppers to taste. 

PICKLED PEPPERS. 
Cut the stems out in a round circle with a sharp penknife, and pre- 
serve them; fill each pepper with a mixture of fine-chopped cabbage, 
horse-radish, mustard seed, and salt; wash the peppers in cold water, 
then fill, rei^lace the piece cut out, tie with coarse thread, pack in stone 
jars, and fill up with cold, sharp vinegar. They will be ready for use 
in two weeks. 

PICKLING CAULIFLOWER. 

Take good white heads, break them into small pieces, and boil for 
ten minutes in strong salt and water; skim out the pieces, which 
should be so tender that a splint of broom corn can be run through the 
stems; lay them on a towel to drain off the water, and when thor- 
oughly cold, put them into a pickle-jar with a few whole cloves, all- 
spice, joepper, and sticks of cinnamon tied up in a cloth; boil and 
skim thoroughly, then pour it directly over the cauliflower. 

RADISH-POD PICKLES. 

Gather when young and tender, put them into brine over night, then 
boil this brine, and pour it over the pods in jars, covering closely to 
keep the steam in ; when the brine is cold, repeat this, and do so until 
the pods are green; then drain them, and pour over them boiling hot 
vinegar, with mace, ginger, long peppers, and horse-radish in it; when 
nearly cold, pour off the vinegar, boil it once more, and again pour 
over the pods; when cold, tie down, and set away. 

FRENCH PICKLES— DELICIOUS. 

One colander of sliced green tomatoes, one quart of sliced onions, 
one colander of cucumbers, pared and sliced, two good handfuls of 
salt; let all stand twenty-four hours, then drain through a sieve; one- 



PICKLES. 167 

half onnce of celery seed, one-half ounce of allspice, one teacupful of 
black pepper, one tablespoonful turmeric, one pound of brown sugar, 
two tablespoonfuls of mustard, one gallon of vinegar. 

PICKLED ONIONS. 
Select small white onions, put them over the fire in cold water, with 
a handful of salt; when the water becomes scalding hot, take them out 
and peel off the skins; lay them in a cloth to dry, then put them in a 
jar; boil half an ounce of allspice and half an ounce of cloves in a 
quart of vinegar; take out the spice, and pour the vinegar over 
the onions while it is hot; tie lap the jar when the vinegar is cold, and 
keep it in a dry place. 

SPANISH PICKLED ONIONS. 

Cut onions into sUces; put a layer of them in a jar, sprinkle with 
salt and cayenne pepper, then add a layer of onions, and season as 
before; proceed in this way until the jar is full, and pour cold vinegar 
over all till covered. Will be fit to use in a month. 

/ CHOW CHOW. 

Take six cucumbers just before they ripen, peel them, cut in strips, 
and remove the seed; four white onions, six good-sized green toma- 
toes, and half a head of cabbage; chop all fine, let them stand in salt 
water over night, then pour off the water, and add vinegar and spices 
to suit the taste. 

ENGLISH CHOW CHOW. 
One-quarter of a peck of green beans, one quart of small onions, one 
quart of green sliced tomatoes, two dozen small cucumbers, one dozen 
small green peppers, one dozen chopped red peppers, one cauliflower, 
two ounces of white mustard seed, the same quantity of black mus- 
tard seed, one-half pound of yellow ground mustard, one-fourth of a 
teacupful of sweet oil, one tablespoonful of turmeric powder, one tea- 
spoonful of celery seed; scald the beans, onions, peppers, cauliflower, 
tomatoes, and cucumbers in vinegar, and drain through a colander; 
then place in a jar; put on the fire fresh vinegar suj03.cient to cover the 
pickle, and put into it all the seed and two-thirds of the ground mus- 
tard; let it boil some minutes, then mix the remainder of the mustard, 
the turmeric, and oil together; stir in, and let it boil up once, and 
p6ur over the pickle. 

RED CABBAGE AND CAULIFLOWER. 

Pull the loose leaves, quarter the cabbage, put them in a large jar 
with alternate layers of salt and cabbage, and let them stand for sev- 
eral days; then scald some vinegar, with pepper-corns, mace and cinna- 
mon in proportion of an ounce each to a gallon of vinegar; add a small 
piece of alum, and turn this over the cabbage in the brine, which 
should remain with it; cloves and allsj)ice are good, but turn the cab- 
bage darker; the vinegar should be scalded three or four times, and 
poured over the cabbage, to make it tender. Cauliflower is pickled in 
the same way. 



168 THE PEOPLE'S COOK BOOK. 

PICKLED CABBAGE. 

Take the outside leaves off a red cabbage, cut in thin slices, place in 
a jar, pour boiling spiced vinegar over it; when cold, cover tightly; in 
ten days it will be fit for use. 

TOMATO CHOW CHOW. 
One-half bushel of green tomatoes, one dozen onions, one-half dozen 
green peppers, all chopped fine; sprinkle over the mess one pint of

fluid then obtained will be the pure nutriment of the meat, and the 
tonic effects are powerful. 

2. Cut raw beef into small pieces, cover with cold water, and set on 
the back of the stove where it will not boil, until all the juice is ex- 
tracted from the beef. When wanted for use skim off all the fat, strain,

season with nutmeg. It may also be thickened with a little flour or 
beaten egg. 

Flaxseed Tea, — One-half pound of flaxseed, one-half pound rock

used at pleasure. To one pound of sugar take one-half pint of water, 
a little white of egg, and then pour over the sugar; let it stand for a short 
time, then place over a very clear fire, and let it boil for a few mimites, 
then set it one side till the scum is subsided; clear it off, and boil the 
sugar until very thick, then strew in the nut, stir and mix it well, and 
do not quit for an instant until it is finished. The pan should not be 
placed on the fire, but over it, as the nut is liable to burn with too fierce 
a heat. 

Almond Candy. — Proceed in the same way as for cocoa-nut candy; 
let the almonds be perfectly dry, and do not throw them into the sugar 
until the}' aj^proach the candying point. 

To Candy Nuts. — Three cups of sugar, one cup of water; boil until 
it hardens when dropped in water; then flavor with lemon. It must not 
boil after the lemon is put in. Put a nut on the end of a fine knitting- 
needle, take out and turn on the needle until it is cool. If the candy 
gets cold, set on the stove for a few minutes. Malar grapes and oranges, 
quartered, may be candied in the same way. 

Chocolate Caramels. — Two cups of sugar, one cup of warm water, 
one-half cup of grated chocolate, three-fourths of a cup of butter; let 
boil, without stirring, until it snaps in water. 



ANTIDOTES FOR POISONS. ^^ 179 

2 One-half pound of grated chocolate, two teacups of sugar, one- 
halt cup of milk and water, a lump of butter, one teaspoon of alum. 

Sugar Candy.— Six cups of white sugar, one cup of vinegar, one cup 
of water, a tablespoonful of butter, put in at the last with one tea- 
spoontul of soda dissolved in hot water. Boil without stirring one- 
half hour. Flavor to suit the taste. 

Ckeam Candy.— Four cups of sugar, two cups of water, three-fourths 
of a cup of vinegar, one cup of cream or rich milk, a piece of butter 
the size of an egg, two teaspoontuls of vanilla, a pinch of soda. Let 
It boil until it cracks in water; then work very white. 

Maple Candy.— Four cups of maple syrup; boil until it cracks in 
water; and just before taking from the fire put in a piece of butter the 
size of an egg. If preferred waxy, do not let it cook so long. 

Butter Scotch.— One cup of molasses, one cup of sugar, one-half 
cup of butter. Boil until done.

ANTIDOTES FOR POISONS. 

The following list gives some of the more common poisons, and the 
remedies most iikely to be on hand in case of need: 

Acids.— These cause great heat, and sensation of burning pain from 
the mouth down to the stomach. Kemedies: Magnesia, soda pearl- 
ash, or soap dissolved in water. Then use stomach-pump or emetic. 

Alkali. — Best remedy is vinegar. 

Ammonia. — Remedy: Lemon juice or vinegar. 

Alcohol.— First cleanse out the stomach by an emetic, then dash cold 
water on the head, and give ammonia (spirits of hartshorn). 

Arsenic— Remedies: In the first place evacuate the stomach; then 
give the white of eggs, lime water, or chalk and water, charcoal, and 
the preparation of iron, particularly hydrate. 

Laudanum. — Same as opium. 

Belladonna.— Give emetics, and then plenty of vinegar and water 
or lemonade. 

Morphine. — Same as opium. 

Charcoal.— In poisons by carbonic gas, remove the patient to the 
open air, dash cold water on the head and bodv, and stimulate the nos- 
trils and lungs with hartshorn, at the same time rubbing the chest 
briskly. 

Corrosive SuBLm ate.— Give white of egg, freshly mixed with water, 
or give wheat flour and water, or soap and water "freely, or salt and 
"Water. 

Creosote. — White of eggs and emetics. 

Lead.— White lead and sugar of lead. Remedies: Alum, cathartics, 
such as castor oil and Epsom salts especially. 



180 , - THE PEOPLE'S COOK BOOK, ^ 

Mushrooms when Poisonous. — Give emetics, and then plenty of vine- 
gar and water, with doses of ether, if handy. 

Nitrate of Silver (Lunar Caustic). — Give a strong solution of com- 
mon salt and then emetics. 

Opium.— First give a strong emetic of mustard and water, then strong 
coffee and acid drinks; dash cold water on the head,

Oxalic Aged (Frequently mistaken for Epsom salts). — Remedies: 
Chalk, magnesia, or soap and water, and other soothing drinks, 

Prussic Aero. — When there is time, administer chlorine in the 
shape of soda and lime. Hot brandy and water, hartshorn and tur- 
pentine are also useful. 

Snake Bite, Etc. — Apply immediately strong hartshorn, and take it 
internally; also give sweet oil and stimulants freely; apply a ligature 
tightly over the part bitten, and then apply a cupping-glass. 

Tartar Emetic— Take large doses of tea made of galls, Peruvian 
bark, or white oak bark, 

Verdegris, — Plenty of white of eggs and water, 
"White Vitriol, — Give the patient plenty of milk and water. 
A Cure for Whisky- Drinkers. — Sulphate of iron, five grains, mag- 
nesia, ten grains; peppermint water, eleven drachms; spirit of nutmeg, 
one drachm; twice a day.

Weights and Measures. — Every family should be furnished with 
scales and weights; and it is also advisable to have wooden measures. 

Two gills make half a pint. 

Two pints make one quart. 

Four quarts make one gallon. 

Half gallon makes a quarter of a peck. 

One gallon makes half a peck. 

Two gallons make one peck. 

Four gallons make half a bushel. 

Eight gallons make one bushel. 

About sixty drops of any thin liquid will fill a common-sized tea- 
spoon. 

Four tablespoons, or half a gill will fill a common-sized wineglass; 

Four wine-glasses will fill half a pint measure, a common tumbler, 
or a large coffee-cup. 

Ten eggs usually weigh one pound before they are broken. Eight 
large ones wiU weigh one pound. 

A tablespoonful of salt will weigh about one ounce. 

One pint of water or milk will weigh one pound. 

One pint of molasses will weigh one and one-quarter poxuids. 



MISCELLANEOUS. 181

One quart of flour weighs one pound. 

One quart of Indian meal weighs one and a quarter pounds. 

Kemaeks on Carving. — Carving is now so generally practiced by gen- 
tlemen, that ladies may, in a great measure, be considered exempt. It 
is, however, a very desirable accomplishment. Every lady should be 
competent to preside at her own table, and, as expertness is best gained 
by experience, it would be very advantageous to young ladies that they, 
before leaving the parental roof, should be permitted to occasionally 
do the carving and serving at table. By acquiring, properly, early 
habits of this kind under a mother's direction, they wiU be prepared to 
operate with confidence at their own table. 

To carve with ease and elegance, it is essential to be furnished with 
a good and suitable carving-knife. These vary in size and form accord- 
ing to the purposes for which they are intended ; for carving a large 
and fleshy joint, as a round of beef, etc., a long blade will be neces- 
sary; for lamb, etc., a smaller size will answer; and for poultry and 
game, a stiU shorter blade, sharp-pointed and somewhat curved. A 
new carving-knife for poultry is now in the market, which can be used 
as shears, and is a great help in nipping off small bones, tendons, etc. 
The knife should be as light as is compatible with the size and strength 
required; the edge very keen, and a good steel or knife-sharijener 
always at hand. A guard-fork is generally used for carving which re- 
quires strength, as it is a necessary security; but, for light cutting it is 
a needless and rather cumbersome appendage. 

It is the business of the cook to see that the butcher properly di- 
vides the joint of neck and loins in all kinds of meats, as this materi- 
ally facilitates the operation of carving. The seat should be suffi- 
ciently high to command the table, and render rising unnecessary. 
For fish, a silver fish-knife or trowel is to be preferred, as preserving 
the flakes more entire, which contributes greatly to the beauty of its 
appearance. 

Although carving with ease and elegance is a necessary accomplish- 
ment, most people are lamentably deficient, not only in the art of dis- 
secting winged game and poultry, but also in the important point of 
knowing the parts most esteemed. Each person, as far as possible, 
should be served with a portion of the best parts. 

. To Clean Paint. — Tea leaves may be saved from the table for a few 
days, and when sufficient are collected, steep, not boil them for half 
an hour in a tin pan. Strain the water off through a sieve, and use 
this tea to wash all varnished paint. It removes spots, and gives a 
fresher, newer appearance than when soap and water is used. For 
white paint, take up a small quantity of whiting on a damp piece of 
old white flannel, and rub over the surface lightly, and it will leave the 
paint remarkably bright and new. 

To Eaise the Pile or Velvet. — Cover a hot smoothing-iron with a 
wet cloth; hold the velvet firmly over it; the vapor rising will raise 
the pile of the velvet with the assistance of a light whisk. 

To Take Mildew fkom Linen. — Eub the spots with soap; scrape 



182 THE PEOPLE'S COOK BOOK. 

chalk over it, and rub it well; lay it on the grass, in the sun; as it 
dries, wet it a little; it will come out with two applications. 

To Clean Makble, — Take two parts of common soda, one part of 
pumice stone, and one part of finely-powdered chalk; sift it through 
a fine sieve, and mix it with water; then rub it well all over the marble, 
and the stains will be removed; rub the marble over with salt and 
water. 

To Clean Tinware. — The best thing for cleaning tinware is common 
soda; dampen a cloth, dip it in soda, rub the ware briskly, after which 
wipe di-y. 

To Clean Cut Glass. — Having washed cut glass articles, let them 
dry, and afterx^ards rub them with prepared chalk and a soft brush, 
carefully going into all the cavities. 

Indelible Ink. — To one tablespoonful of rain water, one-half tea- 
spoonful of vinegar and a piece of lunar caustic, three inches long; 
shake well together ; put on to your cloth a little milk and soda (to a 
tablespoon of milk a piece of baking soda as large as a grain of corn) ; 
iron smooth, and write immediately. 

Ikon Rust. — This may be removed by salt mixed with a little lemon 
juice; put in the sun; if necessary use two applications. 

Mildew. — Dip the stained cloth in buttermilk, and lay in the sun. 

To Cook Poultey and Meat. — A writer says: "All kinds of poultry 
and meat can be cooked quicker by adding to the water in which they 
are boiled, a little vinegar or a piece of lemon. By the use of an acid 
there will be a considerable saving of fuel, as well as shortening of 
time. Its action is beneficial on old, tough meats, rendering them 
quite tender and easy of digestion. Tainted meats and fowls will lose 
their bad taste and odor if cooked in this way; and if not used too 
freely, no taste of it will be acquired." 

To Keep Beef. — Dry well with clean cloth; rub ground pepper plen- 
tifully over every part of it first, then flour it well, and hang it in cool 
place, where the air will come to it. 

To Pickle Meat in One Day. — Take a tub of rain or river water and 
put two pieces of thin wood across it, and set the beef on them, dis- 
tant about an inch from the water; heap as much salt as will stand on 
your beef, and let it remain twenty-four hours; then take off and boil, 
the water having drawn the salt completely through the meat. 

Testing ]\Iilk. — A well polished knitting needle is dipped into a deep 
vessel of milk, and immediately withdrawn in an upright position; 
when, if the sample be pure, some of the fluid will be found to adhere 
to it, while such is not the case if water has been added to the milk. 

Cheap Refeigeratoes. — A flower pot wrapped in a wet cloth, and 
placed over a butter plate, will keep the contents of the plate as hard 
and firm as if they were set on ice; and milk will not sour if the can 
containing it be wrapped in a wet cloth. 

To Mend Beoken Ceockeey. — We have used lime and the white of 
an egg for mending earthenware, and find it most satisfactory. It is a 



' MISCELLANEOUS. 183 

strong cement, easily applied, and generallj'- at hand. Mix only 
enough to mend one article at a time, as it soon hardens, when it can- 
not be used. Powder a small quantity of the lime and mix to a paste 
with the white. Apply quickly to the edges, and place firmly together. 
It wiU soon become set and strong, seldom breaking in the same place 
again. 

How TO Clean a Tea oe Coffee Pot.— If the inside of your tea or 
coffee pot is black from long use, till it with water, throw in a piece of 
hard soap, set on the stove, and let it boil from half an hour to an 
hour. It will clean as bright as a new dollar, and cost no work. 

Tinned Wake.— Tinned ware which speedily loses its brightness 
should be distrusted. It usually contains lead, which is dissolved by 
very feeble acids, and is very poisonous. Iodide of potassium is the 
antidote. 

To Kenew Black Cashmere. — Take half a pint of ammonia and 
enough tepid water to dij) the breadths and pieces in thoroughly up 
and down, after which hang on the line to drip, and dry partially with- 
out wringing; then iron dry on wrong side, when it wiU look like new. 

To Wash Black Cashmeee. — Take hard soapsuds, wash your goods 
thoroughly, and after you have rinsed them in warm water rinse them 
in warm coffee, with a teaspoonful of gum arable water to every pound 
of goods; take a piece of dark flannel or place a layer of flannel and 
then one of the goods, and so on until you have finished, then roll up 
tight and leave until morning, then iron on the wrong side. You can 
also wash soiled velvet in this way. 

To Polish Shiet Feonts and Weist Bands. — Starch the fronts and 
wrist bands as stifE as you can. Starch twice — that is, starch, dry, 
then starch again. Iron your shirt with a box iron, in the usual way, 
making the linen nice and firm, but without any attempt at a good 
finish; don't lift the plait; j^our shirt is now ready for polishing, but 
you ought to have a board same size as a common shirt board, made 
of hard wood, and covered with only one ply of plain cotton cloth. 
Put this board into the breast of your shirt, damp the front very 
lightly with a wet sponge, then take the polishing iron, which is flat 
and beveled at one end; polish gently with the beveled end, taking care 
not to drive the linen up into wave-like blisters. Of course this re- 
quires a little practice, but if you are careful and persevere, in a short 
time you will be able to give the enamel-like finish which is so much 
wanted. 

To Clean Straw Matting. — Wash with a cloth dipped in clean salt 
and water. Take care to wipe dry, as this prevents iis turning yellow. 

Tar may be removed from either hands or clothing by rubbing well 
with lard, and then washing well with soap and water. 

A SuEE Way to PtEMOvE Tea Stains.— Mix thoroughly soft soap and 
salt— say a tablespoonful to a teacuj) of soap; rub on the spots, and 
spread the cloth on the grass where the sun will shine on it. Let it 
lay two or three days; then wash; if the stain is not all out, it will dis- 
appear in the second washing. If the spots are wet occasionally while 
lying on the grass it will hasten the bleaching. 



134 THE PEOPLE'S COOK BOOK. 

Home-made Camphor Ice.— Melt half a teacupful of mntton tallow 
with a piece of camphor gum the size of a large hickorj'-nut; pour into 
a little cup or mold. 

Home-made Haed Soap. — Were the good qualities of this inexpensive 
soap more generally known, no family would go v.'ithout it. It is valu- 
able for washing cfothes, making them very clean and white, without 
in the least injuring them, and is excellent for Hannels or calicoes. It 
is good also for the hands, making them soft and smooth. Take six 
pounds each of salsoda and lard, three pounds of stone lime, four gal- 
lons of soft water, dissolve the lime and soda in the water, stirring, 
settling, and pouring off, then return to the kettle, using brass or cop- 
per; add the lard, and boil until it becomes soap; then pour into a 
tub; when cold, cut in bars and dry. 

A Beautiful Whitewash. — To five gallons of whitewash, made of 
well-burned lime, add a quarter of a pound of whiting, half a pound 
of loaf sugar, one quart and a half of rice flour, made into a thin and 
well-cooked paste, and half a pouad of white glue dissolved in water; 
apply warm; previously scrape off all old scaly whitewash; this is like 
kalsomine, and gives a brilliant and lasting effect. 

Moths. — Professor Riley says, in a scientific journal, that the early 
days of May should herald vigorous and exterminating warfare upon 
those subtle pests, clothes moths. Closets, wardrobes, etc., should be 
emptied, and the clothing laid open and thoroughly exposed to light 
and air, and well brushed before being replaced. Spirits of turpentine 
should be brushed in cracks, wainscots, and shelves, and camphor or 
tobacco placed among the garments, furs, plumes, etc., when laid aside 
for the summer. To secure the cloth linings of carriages from moths, 
sponge them on both sides with a solution of corrosive sublimate, or 
mercury in alcohol, made just strong enough not to leave a white mark 
on a black feather. 

Salt and Moths. — It is said, andby good authority, that after wiping 
up the floor, if salt is sprinkled over it while damp, moths will not try 
that harbor again. When making a carpet it is recommended that 
enough be allowed to fold under an inch or two, so that when it is put 
down salt can be spread between the folds, and also sprinkle salt all 
around the sides and corners of the room before nailing the carpet. 
We have never tried this, but have several good authorities who indorse 
it, and promise that moths wiU not injure carpets if this advice 
is followed. 

Chamois Skins. — To cleanse a chamois skin wash it in cold water with 
plenty of soap, and rinse well in clear cold water; thus you may wash 
as often as you please, and still keep it soft. 

Polishing Paste for Tins, Brasses, and Copper — This is com- 
posed of rotten stone, soft soap, and oil of turpentine; the stone must 
be powdered and sifted through a muslin or hair sieve; mix with it as 
much soft soap as will bring it to the stiffness of putty; to half a pound 
of this add two ounces of oil of turpentine; it may be made into balls; 
it will soon become hard, and will keep any length of time.* Method 
of using: The articles to be polished should be perfectly free from 



MISCELLANEOUS, 185 

grease and dirt; moisten a little of the paste with water, smear it over 
the metal, rub briskly with a dry rag or leather, and it will soon bear a 
beautiful polish. 

A good stove polish may be made with black lead mixed with the 
white of an egg; put on with a brush, and polish with a dry, hard 
brush. 

To make an excellent furniture polish: Take turpentine, linseed 
oil, and vinegar, in equal proportions ; apply and rub with flannel. 

A little soap put on the hinges or latch of a door will stop its creaking. 

Salt will curdle milk; hence in preparing gravies, porridge, etc., the 
salt should not be added till the dish is prepared. 

If your flat-irons are rough or soiled, lay some salt on a flat surface, 
and rub the face of the iron well over it. 

Eub your griddle with fine salt before you grease it, and your cakes 
will not stick. 

When clothes have acquired an unpleasant odor by being from the 
air, charcoal laid in the folds will soon remove it. 

Powdered charcoal placed around roses and other flowers adds to 
their richness. 

Camphor gum placed on shelves or in drawers will effectually drive 
away mice.
