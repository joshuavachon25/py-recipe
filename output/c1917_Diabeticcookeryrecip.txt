PREFACE 

The author would feel diffidence in publishing a cook 
book when so many excellent ones already exist, if it 
were not that she is here treating a special field in which 
her opportunities for observation and practice have been 
exceptional. 

Because of her own need, the author became interested in 
diabetic foods given to patients in the highly successful 
treatments at Carlsbad and Neuenahr, where she spent her 
summers for eight years. Each year she saw the prepara- 
tion of special recipes, worked out with scrupulous accuracy 
of measurement, and with unusual success in making the 
dietaries attractive to patients whose appetites were un- 
certain and difficult to satisfy. Little by little she collected 
and adapted the recipes which appear in this book. Each 
one has been cooked and tested by the author under the 
direction of a physician. 

The tastes of the normal individual have been, and are 
being, catered to in a plethora of cook books, but the needs 
of the diabetic must be met in quite a different fashion. 
Little has been done for the general public in this country 
in preparing special recipes for the diabetic, and in working 
out their food values. Inasmuch as each person's carbohy- 
drate tolerance is different, it is absolutely essential that the 
carbohydrate content of each recipe be known ; only then 
can it be safely used. Furthermore, under some conditions, 
when the carbohydrate content of the diet is reduced, 
extra protein and fat are prescribed by the doctor to meet 
the energy requirement of the individual. Accordingly 



vi PREFACE 

the author has had the protein, fat, and carbohydrate 
grams, as well as the total value in calories, computed for 
each recipe. She believes that her work should make it 
possible for those who have the problem of a diabetic dietary 
to combine each day's rations in a way to be both safe and 
attractive. 

The recipes and menus are so arranged that they are 
readily understood and directions can be easily followed. 

Thanks and grateful acknowledgment are due to the 
late Dr. Richard Stein for his unfailing interest in this 
undertaking and to Miss Helene M. Pope of Teachers 
College for her valued help in computation. The author is 
under special obligation to Mrs. Mary S. Rose whose 
Laboratory Handbook for Dietetics has been used as the 
basis of all calculations.

Diabetic Cookery 



Preliminary Remarks 

I. Breads, Cakes, etc. 

Vary bread, muffins, rolls, cakes, etc., daily. A small 
quantity, just sufficient for one or two days' use at most, 
should be baked at a time, as any bread, etc., baked with 
Casoid Flour, Aleuronat or Almond Flour grows stale and 
tasteless very quickly. 

2. Butter 

Use sweet (imsalted) butter for the table, and for cook- 
ing purposes, wherever it is possible. Serve butter with 
every meal, unless its use is forbidden. 

3. Cream 

Top milk, i. e., the milk which rises to the top of the 
bottle, should be used for preparing sauces, custards, 
etc., as it is really thin cream, 20%; it is not quite so 
heavy as thick cream, 40%, but it is more digestible, 

3 



4 DIABETIC COOKERY 

and answers all purposes, except for making ice creams, 
mousses, parfaits, etc. 

Serve sour cream, 2-3 days old, frequently in place of 
cheese. 

4. Flour 

Prepare almond flour or meal at home; this is a very 
simple process and insures absolute purity. Do not grind 
more than j^ lb. almonds at a time, as they mold quickly. 
Blanch ^ lb. Valencia almonds; dry thoroughly; grind 
very fine in an almond grinder; sift like ordinary floiu*; 
keep in a covered glass jar in a cool place. 

5. Saccharin 

When saccharin is used for sweetening, dissolve one or 

two half-grain tablets in a teaspoonful of warm water, 

and add to the mixture. In sweetening cooked fruits, 
add saccharin just before serving. 

6. Crystallose 

Dissolve 8-10 crystals in i oz. of hot water, when cool 
pour into a small bottle, cork well, keep in a dark place; 
use for sweetening as directed. 6-8 drops are generally 
sufficient. 

7. Special Articles 

The following articles have been specially tested, and 
are the preparations which should be used in cooking 
for diabetics :

CASOID PREPARATIONS 

REMARKS 

Casoid takes the first rank as a flour for diabetics, 
and therefore a special chapter is devoted to its use 
in the preparation of Bread, Muffins, Desserts, etc. 

Casoid, to a great extent, has solved the problem 
which confronts the cook as to a substitute for wheat 
bread, and, as a diabetic naturally craves bread, the sub- 
stitute must come as near to the real article as possible. 

Breads, etc., made from Casoid flour, require skillful 
handling in mixing, and, most important of all, they 
require just the right oven heat to bake them properly. 
A little care and practice will produce good results, 
satisfactory to both the patient and the cook.

Directions for Whipping Cream 

See that cream is perfectly cold; it is well to keep it on 
ice 2-3 hrs. before using. 

Half fill a pan with cracked ice, and put the bowl 
of cream in this pan; beat cream with a wire whip 
or with a Dover beater until it is very stiff; if the 
cream is cold it will take but a few minutes to become 
stiff.

NOTE 

Fish should be chosen, according to the season. They 
should be broiled, baked, boiled, or stewed; small pan 
fish may be fried, but should be used sparingly. 



DIABETIC COOKERY 69 

Broil: Bluefish, Striped Bass, Mackerel, Smelts, Shad, 

Trout; Lobsters, Oysters. 
Bake: Bluefish, Shad, Striped Bass, Sea Bass, Weak Fish. 
Boil: Cod, Black Bass, Halibut, Salmon; Lobsters, Crabs, 

Shrimps. 
Stew: Striped Bass, Pike, Halibut.

Pan Broil: Oysters. 



How TO Broil Fish 

Clean fish; wipe with a cloth wet in cold salt water, 
then with a clean dry fish towel; rub with oil or butter; 
heat and grease broiler, to keep the fish from sticking; 
broil over a clear fire, turning broiler frequently, as the 
skin burns easily. 

Time for broiling varies; if the fish is thick and there 
is fear of its being underdone, place the broiler on a roast- 
ing pan in the oven and finish cooking it. Raise the wires 
carefully, so that the fish does not break, slide on a hot 
dish; season with butter, pepper, and salt; garnish with 
slices of lemon, and serve at once. 

How TO Bake Fish 

Wash fish in cold water; drain, and season with salt; 
put in a covered bowl, and let it stand for several hours, 
in a cool place. When ready to cook the fish, drain once 
more and wipe perfectly dry; put in baking pan, dot with 
butter; sprinkle with chopped parsley, add one bay leaf, 
6 pepper corns, a clove, one small sliced onion, a slice of 
seeded lemon, and a cup of stock; bake until tender, bast- 
ing frequently; when nearly done, thicken the sauce with 
2-3 tablespf. sour cream. Serve very hot.

NOTE — 

It is unnecessary to go into details about the prepara- 
tion of meats. Boiled meats are not nutritious and 
therefore not very desirable ; they may be served occa- 
sionally with sauces, (See Meat Sauces.) Fried meats 
should be entirely cut out of the Bill of Fare. 

Steaks and Lamb Chops should be broiled, or pan broiled. 
Beef, either roasted, or cooked in a casserole. 
Veal, either roasted, or cooked in a casserole. 



78 DIABETIC COOKERY 

Veal Cutlets and Veal Chops (use very rarely) breaded, 

and fried in butter. 
Lamb roasted, braised, or cooked in a casserole. 
Pork roasted. 

Fowl, boiled and served with sauces. (See Meat Sauces.) 
Spring Chickens, broiled or braised. 
Chickens, roasted and stuffed, or cooked in a casserole. 
Turkey, Geese, Du^ks, and Capons, roasted and stuffed. 
Squabs and Pigeons, broiled, braised, and stuffed or 

cooked in a casserole. 
Small birds, i. e.. Quail, Partridge, Plover, Reed Birds, 

etc., are good either broiled,' pan broiled, or braised. 
Larger birds, such as Canvasback, or other Wild Ducks, 

Snipe, Grouse, and Wild Turkey, are best roasted. 
Venison, best roasted. 

How TO Braise Meat 

Use pan with close-fitting lid. 

Wipe meat, poultry, or game; remove most of the fat. 
Season. Heat butter or drippings boiling hot in pan; 
sear meat on both sides; add a little boiling hot stock and 
cover tightly. Draw pan to back of stove, and let the 
contents simmer until tender. 

How TO Broil Meat 

Wipe meat, poultry, or game. Remove all fat, and 
score the sides in several places. See that the fire is clear; 
grease broiler with a little fat, and broil carefully, turning 
broiler very often, so that both sides of the meat will be 
evenly cooked. 

It takes about 8 minutes to cook an inch-thick steak, 
or lo-i 2 minutes if steak be thicker, 5-8 minutes will broil 
a chop. Have platter very hot; season, and serve at once. 



DIABETIC COOKERY 79 

How TO Pan Broil Meat 

Heat a frying pap until it begins to smoke; wipe meat, etc., 
remove most of the fat ; score, put in pan ; sear on both sides, 
then draw pan to one side, and let the contents cook until done. 

Remove fat, season, and serve very hot. Time the 
same as for broiling. 

How TO Cook Meat in Casserole 

Wipe meat, etc. Season ; put in casserole and cover ; put in 
hot oven, and cook till tender, in its own juices. This is a spe- 
cially good way to cook pot roast, fowl, and other heavy meats. 

Roasting or Boiling 
No directions need to be given. 

Left-Overs 

Use left-overs for filling omelets, for force meat, etc. 

Beef, veal, and pork make good force meat for stuffing 
poultry, for scalloping, etc. Minced chicken, turkey, etc., 
are better for creaming in ramekins, for making timbals, etc. 

It would be superfluous to go into details about the pre- 
paration of these dishes.

I20 DIABETIC COOKERY 

NOTE 

Use fresh tender vegetables; clean thoroughly and 
examine carefully before cooking. Remove all the 
withered leaves, inedible parts, etc. Almost without 
exception, vegetables should be boiled in salted boil- 
ing water in an uncovered or only partly covered 
pan. When the vegetables have boiled rapidly for 
fifteen minutes, drain off the water, replace with boil- 
ing water, cook fifteen minutes again, drain, replace 
with boiling water, and cook until tender. This rule 
holds good for the herbaceous vegetables, viz., cab- 
bage, spinach, and all the green leaves, stalks, shoots, 
sauerkraut, etc. 

In using canned vegetables, drain off the water 
in the can, scald vegetables with boiling water, 
drain, then pour hot sauce over them, and serve 
at once. 

For diabetics, it is advisable that vegetables be very 
finely chopped, or, better still, strained through a 
pur6e strainer.

ARTIFICIAL MILK 

I. Williamson's Suggestion 

Found in Dr. Joslin's book Treatment of Diabetes Mellitus. 
(By Permission.) 

Mix a pint of water and 3 or 4 tablespoons cream, 40%; 
let this stand from 1 2 to 24 hotirs ; the cream floats to the 
top ; if skimmed off with a teaspoon it will be found prac- 
tically free from sugar; put this fatty matter in a glass; 
add the white of an egg to it and stir very well ; then dilute 
with water imtil a liquid is obtained which has the exact 
color and consistency of ordinary milk; if a little salt and 
a trace of saccharin be added, a palatable drink free from 
milk sugar is produced which has almost the same taste as 
milk and which contains a large amount of fatty material. 
Of course, much larger quantities than this recipe calls for 
can be employed in order to prepare a considerable amount 
of the drink at one time. 

2. Van Noorden's Suggestion 

Cream diluted with cold or hot water or mineral spring 
water; dilute with tea or coffee in the proportion of one to 
five; the taste is essentially improved by the addition of 
yolk of egg; 2% of plasmon' may be added and salt or 
saccharin. 

• Plasmon Milk Powder can be procured through any druggist.

TYPICAL DIETARIES 
NOTE 

In the division immediately following there appear 
nine bills of fare, two adapted to each of the four 
seasons, and one for an abstinence day, with the exact 
computation of their food values. 

The work done on these dietaries is typical of that 
which must be done for the diabetic, as soon as his 
carbohydrate tolerance is determined by the physician. 
Thereafter, in planning his diet, it is absolutely essen- 
tial that weights and measures be accurate; guessing 
will nt)t do. Ordinarily no one who is not thoroughly 
trained in such work can tell accurately at the end of 
a meal how many calories it furnished him; or with 
any measure of certainty, the proportion of protein, 
fat, and carbohydrate it contained — especially when 
exact recipes are not known. But the lay reader of 
this book will be spared depressing doubts as to 
whether his own computations are correct; nor will 
he constantly have to consult a dietician. For the 
work of computing carefully tested recipes has been 
done for him in the pages preceding; food values have 
been given for the edible portions per pound of meat, 
fish, vegetables, cheese, and nuts. With such data it 
is possible to reckon food values in the day's ration 
very closely, as in the typical bills of fare that follow.

When the carbohydrate tolerance is only 40 grams, 
a small allowance, it becomes necessary to raise the 
proportion of protein above 100 grams, approaching 
140, and to keep the fat about 200 grams, to produce 
an energy requirement of 2500 calories. If the carbo- 
hydrate tolerance is higher, say 60, 80, or even 100 
grams a day, the planning is less difficult. 

In examining the bills of fare here presented, it 
will be seen that one follows the plan of dinner at 
night, the other, of dinner at noon ; the former dietary, 
then, may represent a day in which luncheon might be 
eaten in a restaurant which caters only to persons of 
normal food requirements. Special care should be 
taken in such cases to keep the luncheon simple, 
avoiding pastry of all kinds, and indulging very spar- 
ingly in bread or crackers. The foods chosen should 
always be those in which protein and fat predominate, 
such as meat, fish, cheese, and nuts, with the addition 
of simple salads of lettuce, celery, romaine, or endive, 
for example, in which the amount of digestible carbo- 
hydrates is small. 

The second bill of fare in each group gives an ar- 
rangement suitable for Sunday, when all the meals 
may be eaten at home. The dietaries represent differ- 
ent possibilities in serving, with good combinations of 
foods in which the total carbohydrates for the day 
are kept close to 40 grams as a maximum allowance. 

Those interested in making the best possible use of 
this book, will be able to make excellent bills of fare 
for their own particular needs.

An ideal "Abstinence Day" would be one, of course, in which all 
carbohydrate food is eliminated. For those in business who must 
lunch away from home, such a dietary is difficult to follow; accordingly 
one typical day's rations have been planned in detail in which the 
carbohydrates are reduced to 20 grams, just half of the allowance in 
the typical dietaries for the four seasons. In this dietary some of the 
carbohydrates are in the form of cellulose and will not, therefore, be 
converted into sugar in the organism.
