'PREFACE 

THIS book is made up of old and tried 
recipes, which I have been prompted to 
compile by one of my domestics, who 
states that the recipes I give him are so clearly 
and plainly written that he never has any trouble 
in successfully making any of the dishes. 

I know how difficult it is for inexperienced 
cooks to follow the directions given in cook 
books,, and my own housekeeping has suffered 
in the past from this cause; so I take particular 
pleasure in writing out every step in the recipe 
from the time the cook begins to put the ingre- 
dients together until the dish is ready to serve. 

Ordinarily, so much of this vitally important 
detail is left to the fancy of the cook that inex- 
perienced housewives find cook-book recipes 
very trying and disappointing. 

I have selected only a few, well-tried recipes 
of common everyday things that most of us 
like; and I hope and believe that others will 
find them as useful as they have been to me. 

The proceeds from the sale of this book will 
be devoted to a charitable organization that is 
very near my heart, and with which I have been 
associated and worked for a number of years. 
I hope the personal touch in this book will appeal 
to my many good fishers and friends who have 
shown themselves so interested in my work.

WEDDING OR CHRISTMAS CAKE 

Forn^ula 

1 lb. flour (browned) 1 wine glass best 
1 lb. brown sugar sherry

10 eggs 1 teaspoon soda (dis- 

3 lbs. seeded raisins solved in the milk 

3 lbs. ciirrants and then strained 

1 lb. citron into the brandy) 

1 tablespoon molasses 1 tablespoon cinnamon 
1 wine glass best 1 teaspoon clove

1 teaspoon nutmeg 
Manner of Making 

Use an iron frying pan that is perfectly 
clean and holds no odor of other cooking. Brown 
the flour well the day before it is to be used. Do 
this very slowly and carefully, so that it will 
not burn, making it as brown as light coffee. 
The eggs must be strictly fresh. You should use 
large raisins (Muscatel if you can get them.) 
Go over the raisins veryxiarefully to be sure that 
there are no seeds in them. Citron should be 
cut thin as paper and in pieces one-inch long. 
The currants should be gone over very carefully 
and all the stems taken from them. This is all 
quite a little work and should be done the day 
before the cake is made. Cream the brown 
sugar and butter twenty minutes. Beat all 
the eggs fifteen minutes and add to the creamed

browned flour, then the milk and brandy, 
mixing all well as you go along. Next add the 
cinnamon, clove, mace and nutmeg. Then 
the sherry. Flour well the raisins, currants and 
citron, and add to the mixture. A great big pan 
must be used to mix this in — ^the bread pan 
is a very suitable vessel for this purpose. When 
you add the fruit mix with your hands. Have 
the baker bake this. It makes a cake weighing 
well over twelve pounds. After it comes from 
the baker, put it in a tin air-tight box. At the 
end of a month, frost it.

CHICKEN CREAMED 
(Enough for four people) 

Formula 

1 small chicken — not Salt to season 
necessarily a broiler 1 pint heavy cream 

2 heaping tablespoons 1 teaspoon flour 
butter 

Manner of Making 

Cut the chicken into four pieces; thoroughly 
wash and wipe — not too dry — and rub well with 
flour. Have the butter in a frying pan — being 
careful not to scorch — and when thoroughly 
melted and hot, put in the pieces of chicken 
(as many as the frying pan will hold at a time) 
and allow to cook thoroughly and slowly so that 
the meat is thoroughly cooked, but not dry. 
As the pieces are finished and taken off, place 
them in a pan and leave on the range, covered. 
As you add more pieces of chicken you will re- 
quire more butter — one and one-half tablespoons 
will be sufficient. When all the chicken is cooked 
pour on slowly half of the cream, stirring all 
the time so that the chicken will become satu- 
rated with it. Mix flour in with the other halt 
of the cream until smooth. Stir this into the 
mixture in frying pan which will make it about 
the consistency of heavy cream. Taste the 
gravy to see that you have sufficient salt in it, 
and if not, add more until it is seasoned to taste. 
If the gravy seems too thick, add a little more 
cream to thin it. Place in the frying pan the 
rest of the cooked chicken, turping it over in the 
cravy. When this is thoroughly heated remove 
from fire and serve at once. If you desire more 
gravy ,^ use more cream. Livers and hearts are 
very nice cooked with the chicken. k

the rolling pin from sticking. If there is any 
surplus flour on top when it is rolled out, brush 
off with a broad paint brush. Fold over and 
roll out again. Repeat three times, allowing 
fifteen minutes to elapse between each rolling. 
It will now show streaks of butter all through it. 
Roll up again and allow to stand all night in the 
ice box. In the morning roll out again. Sprinkle 
one-half the sheet of pastry with cheese, salt 
and pepper. Fold over onto the uncovered half 
and roll out. Sprinkle one-half again with 
cheese, salt and pepper, fold over the uncovered 
half and roll out again; continue this until the 
cheese and pepper is well sprinkled through the 
pastry. Cut into strips one-third inch wide 
and five inches long. Put 6n sheets and place

BROILING MEAT^ 

In broiling meats, be sure they do not stand 
after they are cooked. Fifteen minutes before 
dinner is time enough to cook properly. Meats 
broiled over live coals are always the best. 
Care should be taken that they are turned often 
enough so that they do not burn. 



CORNED BEEF OR TONGUE 

These should be put on in cold water and 
allowed to simmer and boil slowly for several

ROASTS 
Formula « 

Meat Flour (a little) 

Salt to season Pepper to season 

Manner of Preparing 

Meat should be well wiped off with clean, 
damp cloth and placed in the baking pan. 
Sprinkle over the entire surface with salt and 
pepper, then flour, leaving a little in the pan. 
Put in a very hot oven. A slow oven allows the 
juices to come out of the meat and toughens it, 
while a hot oven shuts in all the juice and keeps 
the meat tender. After twenty minutes, when 
the flour in the pan is slightly browned, put hot 
water in the pan — ^about a half cup full. From 
time to time baste with a large spoon. About 
fifteen minutes before removing from the oven, 
turn roast over to brown a little on the other

SPICED peaches 
Formula 

£ qts. vinegar (white S or 4 sticks cinnamon 
wine vinegar is best) broken in 1-in. pieces 

8 lbs. sugar 6 dozen peaches 

Cloves 
Manner of Making 

Put the vinegar, sugar and cinnamon into 
a kettle and allow to boil. Have good, sound 
peaches, not over-ripe, but ripe. Put them in 
the bread pan and cover with boiling water. 
Leave for about five minutes and the skins will 
then come off very easily, with no loss of fruit. 
Remove any part of the fruit that may seem a 
little too ripe. After boiling the syrup five min- 
utes, put in the peaches, first sticking six cloves 
very firmly (so that they will not come out in 
the boiling) into each peach. Cook the peaches 
slowly, so that they will not break, until they 
have taken in the juice — three-quarters of an 
hour. While these are cooking, remove any 
scum that may rise to the top. When cooked, 
remove the peaches with a skimmer and place 
on a flat dish to drain. When putting the 
peaches into the syrup to cook, put in as many 
as the pan will hold without piling the peaches 
one on another. A large preserving kettle will 
hold thirty peaches at one time. As soon as 
one lot of peaches is removed from the kettle, 
put in another. After the first lot of peaches 
has been taken out of the kettle, taste the syrup, 
and if it has not sufficient character, add a hand- 
ful of cloves and a teaspoon of ground cinna- 
mon and a little vinegar, which should be first 
dissolved in a little of the syrup. After the 
peaches have drained about five minutes put into 
jars — ^twelve peaches to a quart jar. Fill with 
syrup from stove and allow to cool. Seal.

to taste this syrup occasionally, and if 
a little too sharp add more sugar; if too sweet, 
add a little vinegar. An asbestos mat placed

THE COOK BOOK 187 



A hot custard poured over any bits of 
plain cake makes a very nice dessert. 



To cream butter and sugar, put together in 
a dish and work together with a spoon until the 
sugar is somewhat dissolved and the whole 
becomes perfectly creamy. This process takes 
from fifteen to twenty minutes, according to 
the amounts used. 



In beating the whites of eggs, beat them so 
that the bowl can be turned over without 
spilling the contents. 



Save all crusts and ends of bread. When 
stale, dry well in the oven and then roll with the 
rolling pin. These make very fine bread crumbs, 
and may be put away m a glass jar, with a screw 
top, to be used at any time. A large Mason 
jar is very nice to use for this purpose. 



When a recipe states that anything is to 
be boiled a certain length of time, it means from 
the time it actually begins to bubble and not 
from the time it is put on the stove. 



It is wise to read over recipes two or three 
times before making. 



188 THE COOK BOOK 



In preserving fruits and in making jams 
and jellies, remember that success is assured if 
the best quality fruits are used. 



Jars should be scalded before the 
peaches are put into them. 



Teaspoons and tablespoons always mean 
level unless otherwise stated. 



To keep silver in a good condition use a 
tablespoon of ammonia and tablespoon of 
cooking soda in a pan of hot water soap suds. 
With a soft brush, wash the silver quickly and 
rinse immediately in clear hot water. Dry 
with a linen towel and rub with chamois skin. 



A good tonic for the hair is one-half cup 
of kerosene oil. Stand cup in pan of boiling water 
and allow to remain there fifty minutes. It is 
then ready for use. Bub into the scalp and 
leave all night. 



For a bruise on the skin, discoloration may 
be prevented by moistening a little dry starch 
with cold water and laying it on the injured 
part. This is always at hand, and is so much 
better than the old remedy of raw beef.
