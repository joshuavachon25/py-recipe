INTRODUCTIO 

To the FIRST EDITION. 



'HE R E laving been a great Number of Publications concern- 
ing the Art of Cookery, *'/ may perhaps be thought unnecejjary 
to produce another book on the fubjefi yet, I trull that, upon tx- 
amlnatlon, this work will appear of more real utility than may be 
at firjl imagined. There are many books ^RECEIPTS, but I have 
never met with one that contained any InjlruRlons for Regulating 
a Table. The great inconvenience I experienced, on commencing 
.mljlrefs of a family, from the want of fuch ajfiflance, has fine e 
prompted me to attempt a fet of bills of fare, which, I flatter my- 
felf, will be of great ufe to ladies in general, but particularly to the 
younger part ofmyfex, vjho, on their entering into life, may not have 
acquired thofe advantages which arlfe from lnftrulion or from prac- 
tice, and who arefometimes at a lofs how to condt fl their table ivitb 
that decency and propriety, which are much >v be defired, not only 
in making dinners for company, but in a family way likewife. 

It is certain, that a woman never appears to greater advantage 
than at the head of a Well- Regulated Table , which JJjould be al~ 
ways fo fuppjied, that the unexpected vlfit of a friend, or even of a 
Jlr anger, Jhoidd occafion no inconvenience or confufion. If a dinner 
be fmall and fimple, the manner of ferving it will make it appear 
to great advantage ; and, I think, I may venture to fay, that with 
the ajfiftan'ce of the bills of fare herein infer ted, and with the va- 
riety which every perfon of moderate tajle will be able to introduce, a 
table may be fo conducted as to be of credit to the tajle and manage~ 
ment of the mijlrefs. 

In regard to the RECEIPTS They are fete ffed with great care 
from the manufcripts of an experienced houfekeeper - } they are riot 
expenfive,yet, I may wlih certainty affirm, they will prove excellent 
in their kind, if followed with exaftnej's and attention ; and I 
have given neceJJ'ary inftrufiions for a fervent in a plain way, that, 
by application, ifjhe has a common genius and a good palate, Jhe 
may be made capable of any cook's place. 

I Jhall only add, to recommend this publication, my hope that tht 
fains taken will be found to anfwer the.gnd propofed.

Directions bow to choofe Beef. 

THE fiefii of ox-beef, if young, will have a fine open 
fmooth grain, of a bright red, and very tender ; the fuet 
very white : if it is yellow, it is not good. Cow-beef, the 
grain is clofer, the fat whiter, but the lean not fo bright a 

rec |. Bull-beef is of a ftill clofer grain ; the fat is fkinny, and 

hard, the lean of a deep red, and it has a much ftronger fcent 
than any other beef. 

Different Pieces of an Ox.

SHIN, clod, fticking-piece, leg of mutton-piece, fore-rib, 
middle-rib, chuck, blade-bone, marrow-bones, briiket.

tripe, which is diftinguifhed by the names of the double, the 
roll, and the reed-tripe ; and the feet. 

General Directions for Boiling, &c. 

AS neatne, . moft material rcquifite in a kitchen, be par- 
ticularly careful to keep all the utenfils perfectly clean, the pots 
and faucepans well tinned, or lined with fi'iver; let all meat 
boil gently, and always ufc foft water, if to be had : put the 
meat into the veflcl while the water is cold, unleft it is not 
fait enough (if beef or pork) then put it into hot, or boiling 
water ; be fure always to let the vefTel be large enough, that 
the meat may be well covered with water; cover the pot, to 
prevent the foot dropping into it, and fo clofe that the fmoke 
from the fire does not get under the edgof the cover ; when it 
boils, never neglecl: to take off the feu- , as that not being at- 
tended to, fpoils the look of the mear fome fhake a fmall 
bandful of flour upon the water, which takes up all the fcum 
and others pour a little cold water in, when the put boils, to 
make the fcum rife. 

General Directions for Roajling. 

AS foon as the meat is put to the fire, pour over it form warm 
water, which throw away ; this is very necdfary to thofe who 
are nice in the drefling their meat, it being a good deal handled 
in the fpitting ; fhake fome flour over it, bafte it with butter, 
and do not put it too near the fire : this, with frequently hart- 
ing it, a brifk fire, and allowing time enough, are the only 
means of roafting in perfection : when the fteam draws to the 
fire, the meat is near done : flour and b.ifte it juft before it is 
fent to table, that it may have a nice froth : alwavs allow a, 
longer time for the meat to roaft in frofty weather : take parti- 
cular care to have the fpit clean, as nothing is moie difagreeable 
than a fpit mark ; and remember, when the meat is hall' done, 
.to remove the dripping-pan and fpit a little from the hie, and 
ftir it : if it is a good fire before the meat is laid down, once 
fiirring it will in general roalt a joint of meat. Keycr fait the 
meat before it is put to the fire, it draws out the gravy too 
much : if it is to be kept fome time before it is drefTed, as in- 
deed mutton and beef are not good frefh killed, be fure to dry 
it well with a cloth, and hang it whcie it will have a thorough 
air; look at it every day, and wipe off all the damp; it vuil 
keep a long time : fome pepper it a little. 



THE LADY*s ASSISTANT. 122 

Boiled Beef* 

BEEF muft be boiled according to the different pieces : a 
round, or a haunch-bone, ought not to be thoroughly boiled, 
as they make good * bubble and fqueak, if under-done, or the 
jnfide of a round will make a good pie ; a middling-fixed round 
will take three hours: brifket and inferior pieces ought to be 
very well boiled. For fauce cabbage, favoys, any fort of 
greens, carrots, or turnip >. 

To boil a Rump of Beef^ relijhed. 

CUT a very large handful of fweet herbs very fmall, mix 
with them fome common fait and pepper, a fmall quantity of 
faltpetre ; rub the beef all over with thefe ingredients, let it lie 
four days, but not longer ; put it into a pot with a large quan- 
tity of water, and put in with it four onions cut in quarters, 
a bunch of carrots, four bay-leaves, a large bunch of fweet 
herbs, a handful of parfley, five or fix cloves, fome whole pep- 
per, and a little fait ; boil it well, and as the fcum rifes take it 
off : do not put any of the roots into the difh with it, only ftrew 
fome frefh parfley. This is a very good way of dreffing it; the 
herbs it is rubbed with give it a good flavour. 

Roaft Beef. 

A PIECE of ten pounds will take about an hour and a half; 
of twenty pounds, three hours, if thick ; two hours and a half, 
if thin : put a piece of buttered paper on the outfide, it prevents 
the fkin from ihrinking. For fauce fall ad, pickles, potatoes, 
broccoli, cucumbers raw or ftewed, celery raw or Hewed, French 
beans, cauliflower. 

To bake a Leg of Beef. 

TAKE a large deep pan, and lay your beef at the bottom ; 
then put in a little piece of bacon, a flice or two of carrot, 
fome mace, cloves, black and white whole pepper, a large 
onion cut in flices, and a bundle of fweet herbs : pour in wa- 
ter till the meat be covered, and fend it to the oven covered 
up. When it is baked, (train it through a coarfe fieve ; take 
out all the fmews and fat, and put them into a faucepan, with 
a few fpoonfuls of the gravy, a little red wine, a fmall piece of 
kulter relied in flour, and fome muftard ; fhake your faucepan, 

* Fry'd beef and cabbage, 

often. 



J22 THE LADY's ASSISTANT. 

often, and when the faucc is hot and thick, difh it up, and fend 
it to table. 

To flew Beef. 

TAKE a pound and a half of the fat part of the brifkct, 
with four pounds of ftewing beef, cut into pieces; put thelc 
into a ftew-pan, with a little fait, fome pepper, a bunch of 
fvvcet herbs, an onion ftuck with cloves, two or three pieces of 
carrot, two quarts of water, and half a pint of good fmall 
beer : let it ftew four hours, then take fome turnips and carrots 
cut into pieces, a fmall leek, two or three heads of celery cut 
fmall, a piece of bread toafted hard ; let thefe ftew all together 
one hour more, then pour all into a tureen, and fcrve it up. 

To Jlei'j a Rump of Beef. 

TAKE a rump, and roaft it till it is half done, then put it 
into a large pot with three pints of water, one pint ot fmall 
beer, one pint of red wine, fome fait, three or four fpconfuls 
of vinegar, two fpoonfuls of ketchup, beaten mace, a bunch of 
f \vect herbs, an onion ftuck wilh cloves, a little chyan pepper ; 
], t it flew very gently till it is very tender ; it will take about 
two hours ; when it is enough, take it up, and lay it in a deep 
difh : fcum the fat off. very carefully, and ftrain the gr.ivy ; 
put in a few pickled mufhrooms, truffles, morells, and oyfters, 
if agreeable ; it is very good without : thicken the gravy, and 
pour over the beef. 

Forcemeat-balls fried are a good addition, laid round the 
beef. 



jo Beef Gobbets. 
TAKE a piece of beef, not too lean, nor too fat, cut it 
into pieces, the fize of a large egg, put them into a Itew-pan, 
and juft cover them with water ; let them ftew an hour, fcum, 
them very clean, then put in fome fait, and fome whole pep- 
per, cloves, and mace, tied in a bit of muflin, fome celery and 
carrots, turnips pared and cut into flices, a bunch of I'.VLCt 
herbs, and a large cruft of bread, a little red wine, .iccor 
to the quantity that is wanted ; cover them clofe, and let them 
ftew till they are tender; take out the fpices and the bread, 
and have a French roll ready fried and cut into four, to put 
into them when they are fent to table.

fweet herbs, half a pint of red wine, fome lemon-peel: cover 
it down very clofe, and put a wet cloth round the edge of the 
pot, to prevent the fleam evaporating ; when it is half done 
turn it, and cover it up again ; do it over a ftove, or a very flow

Directions to choofe Veal. 

* I'^HE flefh of a bull-calf is firmer than that of a cow, but 

JL then it is feldom fo white; the fillet of a cow-calf is 

. generally preferred, on account of the udder; if the head is 

frcfh the eyes are plump, but if ftale, they arc funk and 

wrinkled. 

If a (houlder is ftale, the vein is not of a bright red ; if there 
are any green or yellow fpots in it, it is very b..d. 

The breail and neck, to be good, fhould be white and dry ; 
if they are clammy, and look green or yellow at the upper end, 
they are ftale. 

The loin is apt to taint under the kidney j if it is ftale, it 
will be foft and flimy. 

A leg fhould be firm and. white; if it is limber, and the 
flifh flabby, with green or yellow fpots, it is not good.

Directions to chcofe Pork. 

PORK, if it is mcafly, is very dangerous to eat; it may be 
eafily feen, the fat being full of little kernels : if it is 
young, the lean will break if pinched, and the (kin will dent 
by nipping it with the fingers ; the fat will be foft and pulpy, 
like lard ; if the rind is thick, rough, and cannot be nipped 
with the fingers, it is old ; if the fiefti is cool and fmooth, it is 
frcfh. : if it is clammy, it is tainted ; it will be worfe at the 
knuckle than at any other part.

Different Pieces of Pork. 
Fore Quarter. 

^~> 

THE fpring and the fore-loin, the fparc-rib and grifkin, 
are cut from the fore- quarter : the fpring is generally falted 
and boiled, and the fore-loin roafted ; but lome like them 
both roaited.

T'be Bacon Hog 

IS cut very different, to make hams, bacon, and pickled 
pork, fpare-ribs, chines, and grifkins. Hog's lard is the fat of 
the bacon hog. 

Many are fond of the liver, fried with bacon. 

Bacon. 

THE fat will feel oily, and look white, and the lean of a 
good colour, and will ftick clofe to the bone, if it is good ; 
but if there are yellow ftreaks in the lean, it is or will be rufty 
very foon. 

If the rind is thin, it is young ; but, on the contrary, if it 
is thick it is old. 

Hams. 

HAMS with fhort (hanks are beft : put a knife under the 
bone of the ham j if it comes out clean, and fmells well, it is 
o-ood ; but if it is daubed and fmeared, and has a difagreeablc 
i'mell, it is not good. 

Brawn. 

IF old, the rind is thick and hard ;" if moderate, it is young : 
if the rind and fat are very tender, it is barrow or fow brawn. 

'To boil Pork. 

PORKfhould be very well boiled; a leg of Pork of fix pounds 
will take about two hours ; the hand muft be boiled till very 
tender. Serve it with peafe-pudding, favoys,or any greens. 

Roaft Pork 

SHOULD be well done ; a leg of twelve pounds will take 
three hours. Stuff the knuckle with chopped fage and onion, 
pepper, and fait : ferve it with gravy in the difh. Very young 
pork may be fkinned, and drefled in quarters. For fauce 
potatoes and apple-fauce, 

Do not fcore it, but rub it over with a feather and fome oil. 

<To barbicue a Leg of Perk.

is a general rule in choofing moft kinds of fifl) j 
if their gills are red, their eyes plump, and the whole 
fiiii ftiff, they are good : if, on the contrary, the gills are pale, 
the eyes funk, and the fifh flabby, they are ftale. 



THE LADY's ASSISTANT. 209 

Directions for boiling FijJj. 

ALL kinds of fifh fhould be boiled in hard water, as it ad^s 
a firmnefs to it, and not put in till the water boils ; there fhould 
be horfe-radifh and fome fait boiled in the water with all fifb, 
except mackarel ; with them fhould be put fait, fennel, par- 
fley, and mint. Care fhould be taken to boil the fifh well, 
but not to let it break. 

General Directions for frying Fijh. 

AFTER it is well wafted, it mud be well dried with ft 
cloth; flour it, and then put into the frying-pan as much 
lard, or beef dripping, as will cover the fifh (but lard is beft) ; 
it muft boil before the fifh is put in, that is, when it has done 
biffing ; let it fry quick, it fhould be of a light brown, not too 
dark a colour ; if there ;s occafion, turn it with the flice ; 
when it is done, take it up, a/id lay it upon a coarfe cloth in a 
difh to drain ; it may be rubbed over with a feather dipped in 
the yolk of an egg, and then rolled in crumbs of bread and 
flour mixt, or in a batter mixed up \vith ale and flour ; either

and wafh it clean from the blood in three or four waters, with 
fome fait ; cut the fins from the back, fcald and fcrape them 
clean from the fcales ; put the meat in a faucepar , with a little 
fait, and rather more water than will cover it; let it flew, but 
fcum it very clean all the time: if the turtle is large, put into 
it a bottle of white wine; if fmall, a pint will do; the wine 
muft not be put in till it has ftewed an hour and a half, and 
the fcum has done rifing ; if the wme is put in before, it will 
make the turtle hard : put into it, while it is ftewing, a"n onion 
or two fhred fine, with a little thyme, parfley, black pepper, 
and fait : when it is ftewed very tender, take it out of the 
faucepan, and cut it into fmall pieces ; wafh the back-fhell 
very clean from the blood, then rub it with pepper, fak, thyme, 
parfley, and onions fhred fine, and mixed together ; put the

layer of meat, till the fhell is full ; cover it with feafoning : 
if it is a large -turtle, two pounds of butter muft be cut into 
bits, and laid between the feafoning and the meat. The foup

entrails, which are reckoned the beft, mull: be. fplit open, 
fcraped, and made clean, cut into fmall pieces, and put into 
the other part. The paunch, or maw, muft be fcalded, fkin- 
ned, and cut into pieces, and put to the reft, with the lights, 
heart, and liver: put it all together into a faucepan, with half 
a pound of butter, a few cfchalots, a bunch of thyme, parfley, 
and fweet herbs, fome fait, white pepper, mace, beaten cloves, 
and a little chyan pepper : let it ftew half an hour over a good 
charcoal fire, put in with it as much of the broth as will cover 
it ; fcum it well, and when it is half done, put in a pint and 
a half of Madeira wine : it will take four or five hours dointr : 

o 

when it is almoft dorie, fcum it, and thicken it with fome flour 
and veal gravy, the thicknefs of a fricaflee : make fome forced- 
meat balls with the veal part, which was left, about the bignefs 
of a wain ut; fry them, and put them into the ftew : if it has 
any eggs, let them be cleaned and boiled ; if there are none, 
boil twelve or fourteen hard eggs ; then put the ftew (which 
is the callepafli) into the back-fhell, with the eggs and balls 
ov.r it, and put it into an oven to brown ; the liver, lights, and 
heart fnou!d be taken from the callcpafh : before it is put into 
the ihell, the callepy muft be flafned in fcveral places, and fea- 
foncd with butter, chopt thyme, fweet heibs, parfley, onions, 
Lit, white pepper, and a little chyan : put a piece into e.t

dripping-pan, in an oven ; the back-fhell muft be rubbed over 
with feafoning made of pepper, fait, beaten mace, fvveet herbs, 
parfley, and onion (bred fine ; bake it in a dripping-pan, which 
muft be done before the ftew is put in. 

The fins, when boiled very tender, muft be taken out and 
put into a ftew-pan, with fome good pale veal gravy, a very 
little white wine, thickened with a little of the gravy and 
Hour, and ferved in a difli by themfelves. 

The lights, heart, and liver, which were ftewed with the 
callepafti, muft have a little more feafoning added to them, and 
when warmed up, ferved in a difti by themfelves. Strain off 
the foup, and ferve it in a tureen or foup-difti.

HERRINGS. 

'To cbcQj r e Herrings. 

HERRINGS to be good, fhould have their gills of a fine 
red, their eyes full, and the whole fifh (tiff and very bright ; 
if the gills are of a faint colour, the fifli limber and wrinkled, 
they are bad. They are a falt-water filh, and are generally 
caught in the north fea. 

The goodnefs of pickled herrings confifts in their being fat, 
flefhy, and white. 

Red herrings, when good, are large, firm, and dry ; the out- 
fide of a fine yellow, with a good roe or melt. 

I'o drefs Herrings. 

THE general way of drafting herrings is to broil or fry 
them, with melted butter. 

To boil Herrings. 

THE propereft time for boiling herrings, is when they come 
before and at the beginning of the mackarel feafon ; they are by 
many people reckoned better than when full of roe : the flefh 
is much poorer than at this feafon, when their breeding time is 
over, and they have had time to feed and recover their rlefh. 

Clean half a dozen herrings, and throw them into a pan of 
cold water, ftir them about, and change the water once ; fet 
on a flew-pan, with water enough to cover them, fome fait, 
and a little vinegar ; when the water boils put in the herrings ; 
when they are enough, lay them on a fifh-plate in a warm diih.

Come fait ; mix them together, and rub it all over the nfJb ; 
lay them (trait in a pot, with fome bay-leaves between ; cover 
them over with allegar rape vinegar, or half vinegar and water 
is as well ; cover them over with a white paper, i nd over that 
a fheet of thick brown paper ; bake them in a , .derate oven. 
]f they are baked in good allegar they will ke< p two or three 
months. Some who bake them in vinegar and water, pour 
the full liquor from them, put on feme frefh, and fend them 
to the oven again. 

To pickle Herrings. 

TAKE off the heads, and take out the roes, wafh and wipe 
them ; to a dozen and a half put cloves, mace, and nutmegs 
pounded, of each a quarter of an ounce ; feafon high with fait

wings, fmge and flour them, put tnem into cold water, cover 
them clofe, and fet them over a verv How hrc ; fcum them well ;

To roaft a Hare. 

STUFF it with a pudding made of bread-crumbs, chopped 
fuet, the liver parboiled and bruifed, lemon-peel grated, flircd 
parfley, and fweet herbs, pepper, fait, nutmeg, the yolks of 
two eggs ; few up the hare ; put a quart of fmall beer into the 
dripping-pan, or three pints, according to the fize of the hare ; 
bafte it with this till the whole is ufed, then flour the hare and 
bade it with butter ; fend it to table with a fine froth. I have 
tried all the different things recommended to bafte a hare with, 
and never found any thing fo good as fmall beer. A fmall 
hare will take an hour and a half, a large hare two hours. 
For fauce gravy, melted butter, and fweet fauce. 

To drefs a Hare. 

WHEN the hare is caled, cut it in two juft below the ribs ; 
cut the fore-quarters into pieces, and put them into a clean 
ftew-pan, with a blade or two of mace, an onion ftuck with 
cloves, fome whole pepper, an anchovy, and a bunch of fweet 
herbs; cover them with water, and let them flew gently; 
make a pudding, and put into the belly of the other part ; lard 
and roaft it, flour and bafte it well with butter or fmall beer : 
when the ftew is tender, take it out with a fork into a difh, 
and ftrain off the liquor; put into it a glafs of red wine, a 
fpoonful of good ketchup, and a piece of butter rolled in flour; 
fhake all together over the fire till it is of a good thicknefs : 
take up the roaft hare, and lay it in the middle of the difh, 
with the ftew round, and fauce poured over it. Some good 
gravy jn a boat.

PHEASANTS. 

To choofe Pbeafants. 

THEY are of the English cock and hen kind, very beauti- 
ful, and of a fine flavour : the hen is much valued when with 
egg : the cock has fpurs, the hen has not : if the cock pheafant 
is young, the fpurs ihould be fhort and blunt, or round ; it 
they are long and fharp, he is old. Examine the hen at the 
vent ; if that is open and green, it is a iign fhe is ftale ; if {he 
is with egg, it will be foft ; if they are itale, and are rubbed 
hard with the finger, the (kin will peel.

SPICES, 

Ginger, 

GINGER is a root which grows in the Eaft Indies, and 
in many parts of America : the plant which fprings 
from it has leaves like flags ; it bears fmall flowers. The beft 
comes from Calcutta, but very good from many other places; 
It is dug up in autumn, then wafhed, and fpread on thin 
hurdles, fupported on treiTels. That which is found, and of 
the deepeft yellow, is beft. 

Cloves i 

WE have cloves from the Dutch. They have deftroyed 
them in the Molucca iflands, and are propagating them in the 
ifland of Ternate. They are the fruit of a large beautiful trce.j 
and are gathered before they are ripe, The tree has leaves like 
the bay. The clove is firft green ; as fooi as it begins to turn 
a little brown, it is gathered, long before it is ripe. What are 
left upon the trees grow very large, and are called the mother 
of cloves ; the fmall ones are gathered in the middle of the 
day, and- laid in a fhady, airy place to dry; 

X 2 Mase 



308 THE LADY's ASSISTANT. 

Mace and Nutmeg. 

THESE two fpices are produced from the fame tree, which 
is large and beautiful ; the leaves are long, and of a fine crcen-, 
the flower is like an apple-blofTo:n , the fruit is round, and 
the (:ze of a middling peach, which it very much refemblcs. 
The nutmeg is the kernel, and is covered by the mace. The 
fruit is cut open, the mace taken off, and that and the nutmeg 
are dried in a cool, airy place. 

Some diftintjuifh the nutmeg into male and female. The 

~ -j 

common nutmeg is the female ; the other is longer, and lefs 
valuable. They are produced from the fame tree, which is r.ot 
unlike our pear-tiee in its manner of growing. Its leaves, 
whether green or dried, have, when bruifcd, a very agiee 
fmell. It grows in the Eaft Indies. The bell mace is foft, 
oily, and fragrmt. The nutmeg ihould be found, hard, and 
heavy, of a pale colour on the outfide, and finely marbled 
within. 

The Dutch fupply us with nutmegs and mace, the whole 
fpice- trade being in their hands. 

Cinnamon. 

CINNAMON is the produce of the ifland of Ceylon. It 
is the inner bark of a beautiful tree. The leaves are like thofe 
of a bay-tree ^ of a fine fpicy taite, and moll agreeable fmell. 
The bark, when frefh, has little tatie ; its flavour grows higlu r 
as it drie-5. The rlnelt is in fmall quills, of a bright colour, a 
ftrong fmell, and a fliarp biting taftc. Sometimes they extt.i. t 
an oil from it before it is brought over ; it is then very inlipid, 
and Caflia bark is often amongtt it. The tafte is the bell way 
to judge of its excellence; that which has loft its oil, is l.K 
{harp and quick. After holding the Cailia fume time in the 
mouth, it turns to a kind of jelly. 

Pepper. 

THERE are three kinds of pepper ; the black, the white, 
and the long. The Chyan and Jamaica pepper are not of that 
kind, though called by that name. There are two forts of 
white pepper ; one is made by deeping black pepper in lea 
water, and then taking off the fkin ; the other is the fruit of a 
different plant, but very like the black pepper. Thefe are 
both long trailing plants; they have jointed {talks, and are 
fmall : the fiuit follows them. It is full green, then reddifh, 

and 



THE LADY's ASSISTANT. 309 

nod of a deep purple when ripe, but grows black and wrinkled 
when dreiling. 

Pepper is gathered in November ; the white is larger and 
milder than the black. It comes from the Eaft Indies. That 
which is largeft, and moft free from duft, is the belt. The 
long pepper is of the fame nature, but milder. 

All-fpics. 

THIS fpice is called Jamaica pepper, from the place of its 
growth ; and all-fpice, from its having the tafte of all other 
fpices. It is the fruit of a large tree : the leaves are broad ; 
the flowers are fmall, and grow in bunches ; after which comes 
the fruit, which is gathered when ripe, and dried in the fhade. 
W r hen it is good, it is large, full, and of a good colour. It is 
* very good fpice for common ufe, but not equal to the others 
in flavour. 

Turmerick. 

IS the root of a plant of an oblong figure ; it is generally 
in pieces from half an inch to an inch in length ; and at the 
utmoft furface, the thicknefs of a man's little nnger ; it is very 
heavy, hard to break, and not cafily cut with a knife : the 
outfide is of a fine whitifh grey, with a tinge of faint yellow ; 
but, when it is broke, the infide is of a fine yellow, if the root 
is frefh. It grows redder by keeping, till at laft it will be- 
come of the colour of faffron in the cake ; thrown into water, 
it foon gives it a fine yellow tinge. It is ealily powdered in 
a mortar, and, according to its different age, makes a yellow, 
an orange-colour, or rcddifa powder. It has a kind of aro- 
matic fmell, fomething like ginger; the tafte is acrid, dif- 
agreeable, and bitter. It is brought from the Eaft Indies, 
where they ufe it in fauces and foods. 

S A L T S. 

THERE are two kinds of fait; the common, and falt-petre* 
The firft is made from the fea-water, from falt-fprings, or 
elfe dug out of the ground. The other is collected from old 
walls, or the cliffs of rocks, in a rough ftate j or from certain 
earth, and afterwards refined. We have the falt-petre rough 
from the Eaft, and we refine it here. The common fait, of 
feveral kinds, is dug or made in Europe. 

Of the common (alt there are four different kinds ; fea f.ilt, 
faltj rock fait, and baCret fait. Sea fait is made by boiling 

X 3 an4 



310 THE LADY's ASSISTANT. 

and evaporating Tea water over the fire. Bay fait, by evapo- 
rating fea water, in pits clayed on the ?nfide, by the heat of the 
fun. Hafket fait is made by boiling away the water of fait 
fprings over the fire. Rock, fait is dug out of the ground, and 
when very fine, is called falt-gemme. There are only two 
kinds of falt-petre; they go by .different n.nnes; that which 
is purified is caljed falt-peire, and that which, is rough as it 
comes from abroad, is called petie-falt. The pure lalt-pctre 
is much Wronger than the other. 

SUGAR. 

SUGAR is the product of the Eaft and Weft Indies. It is 
a kind of reed, but is called a fugar-cane. The reed is of the 
nature of ours, only much larger. The fugar is made of its 
juice boiled up to a confiftence. At fir ft it is very coarfe and 
brown, but is refined, after it is brought over, by our fugar- 
ba leers. 

O I L. 

THERE are many forts of oil, but only one ufed for the 

table, which is that produced by the olive. Thcfe which \ve 

rat, are gathered before they are ripe ; but when the oil is to 

be prefled from them, they are left upon the tree till full ripe, 

and prefled when they are a) molt rotten. Wd have oil from 

moft of the warm parts of Europe, but it is different in purity 

and value, by the leller or greater care taken in the making of 

it. Italian oil is generally the fir.efr,. T hat of Lucca and 

Florence is particularly eiteemed. They make very good oil 

in France. In the choice of oil we are to judge by the fmcll 

and tafte. It fhould be free from both. In uencral any knell 

or tafte is a fault. Oil fhould be quite pure and infipid, its 

only quality being foftncfs. In cold weather, oil congeals, 

?nd its purity may be gqeffed by its appearance ; for the finer 

the oil, the Imaller are ihe lumps.

Vinegar made of Sugar and Water. 

TO two quarts of water put one pound of brown fugar, boil 
and fcum it well ; add two quarts of cold water, and work it 
with a toaft fpread with yeaft; ftir it nine days fucceflively, 
then put it into a cafk, and let it ftand from April till Septem- 
ber in the fun; the cafk not flopped, but covered with a board.

BOIL it till one-third is wafted ; while it is boiling, take 
care to fcum it very clear ; then put it into a cafk, and fome - 
chervil with it ; flop it clofe, and it will foon be fit for ufe. 
Vinegar may be made of any fruits, flowers, herbs, or- roots, 
by putting them into the vinegar, and letting them ftand till 
it fmells or taftes of them. 

Garlic Vinegar. 
A quart of vinegar, eight cloves of garlic, two diced nut- 

i r i 

megs, and iixty cloves. 

Goofeberry Vinegar. 

BRUISE fome goofeberries that are quite ripe, and to three 
quarts of water put one of goofeberries ; let it ftand twenty- 
four hours, then (train it through canvafs, and after that 
through a flannel bag; put one pound of coarfe fugar to every 
gallon of this liquor ; ftir it well together ; put it into a cafk, 
and let it (land nine or ten months, then it will be fit for ufe. 
The longer it ftands the better. 

The water muft be boiled, and {land till it is cold, before 
it is mixed with the goofeberries. This is good vinegar for 
pickling. 

Raifm Vinegar. 

TO every two pounds of Malaga raifms put four quarts of 
fpring water ; lay a tile over the bung-, and fet it in the fun,

TRUFFLES.

TRUFFLES. 

TRUFFLES grow like mufhrooms, but never appear above 
the ground in their natural ftate. They generally lie ten inches 
deep; after they are ripe, they rot in the ground, and young 
ones grow in great numbers from every old truffle which de- 
cays. The truffle has a very rich, tart, and high flavour, when 
freih, but lofes it in a great meafure when dried ; however, 
they are generally uled in made dilhcs. They are common in, 
France and Italy, and we have them in fome parts of England. 

M O R E L L S. 

MORELLS are likewife of the mushroom kind, but they 
rife above the earth about three inches, of the bignefs of an 
egg, of a dufky-whitifh colour ; they have a higher flavour 
frefh than dry. They grow in England, but are more common. 
3nd richer in flavour in the warmer parts of Europe. 

CHYAN PEPPER. 

THE plant which bears this pod, is raifed fometimes in our 
gardens. Its proper name is Capficum. From its growing in 
Africa, it is called Guinea pepper ; and Chyan pepper, from 
its growth in America. The pods are long, and when ripe, 
of a finooth fine red colour. Some call it Garden-coral. The 
powder of this is called chyan pepper, and is made as follows : 

The pods are gathered when full ripe ; they are opened, the 
feeds taken out, and the pods laid to dry in the fun ; when 
quite dry, they are beaten to a coarfe powder. This powder 
is chyan pepper in the plained way, but there are many w?ys 
of preparing it. Some mix bay-fall with it, and others powder 
of mufhrooms. 

MUSHROOMS. 

MUSHROOMS are very ufeful for fauces and made diftes, 
but great care fhould be taken to procure the right fort. Thofe 
are good which grow upon commons, but are liable to be 
mixed with bad ones ; therefore it is beft to ufe thofe from the 
hot-beds. The upper part of the right fort are of a roundifh 
form, like a button ; the ftalk white, the under part, or gills, 
of a fine pale red, but when broken, are vey white ; when they 
are left in the ground, they grow very large and flat, and the 
red part changes to a very dark colour. When they are fmall, 
they are called buttons, and are fit for pickling j but when 

they 



314 THE LADY's ASSISTANT. 

they grow large, they are called flaps, and are put to other 
ufes, which will be mentioned hereafter. Thofe which are a 
iizc between the buttons and flaps, are fit to ufe frefn. The bad 
fort, which are picked up amongft thole that ^row naturally 
on the commons and in the fields, are not fo flat at the top j 
the under part, or gills, is white, inftead of the fine red ; if 
they are rubbed with the fingers, they turn yellow, and when 
pickled are never white.

TAKE a parcel of mufiiroom-flaps, cut off the {talks, and 
fcrape out the gills ; put them into a faucepan with a little fait,

them to a Hack oven upon tin plates ; when they are quite dry, 
put them into fhallow boxes, and keep them for uie. 

The liquor will make ketchup. 

'To keep Mujhrcoms in Salt and Water. 

MAKE them very clean, taking out the gills ; boil them 
tender in water and a little fait, dry them with a cloth ; make 
a ftrong brine ; when cold put in the mufhrooms ; at the end 
of a fortnight change the brine; put them into fmall bottles, 
and pour oil on the top. 

When they are ufed in ragouts, &c. lay them firft in warm 
water,

rnufhrooms ; drain them ; bottle the fpice and liquor when 
cold : dry the mufhrooms in an oven, firll in a broad pan, then

THE LADY's ASSISTANT. 345 

To make Sour Crout. 

TAKE feme fine hard white cabbages, cut them very fmall ; 
have ready a tub, according to the quantity which is to be 
done; put the cabbages into the tub : to every four or five 
cabbages throw in a handful of fait; when they are all put in, 
lay on them a very heavy weight, to prefs them down as flat 
as pofiible ; throw a cloth on them, and lay on the cover ; let 
them ftand a month, when they may be ufed, but they will 
keep twelve months ; it muft be always kept clofe covered : a 
few carraway-feeds pounded fine, and thrown in, make it eat 
well. The way to drefs it, is with a fine piece of fat beef 
ftewed. 

Cauliflower-ftalks, and cabbage-ftalks, peeled and cut down, 
and done in the fame manner, are very good. 

The true German Way of making Sour Crout, 

or Sour Cabbage. 

TAKE white cabbages, and clean them well from all the 
green and fuperfluous leaves ; cut through the middle, and take 
the hearts out; cut and flice the cabbages as fmall as poffible, 
but cut them no longer than they are perfectly nice and fine. 
Rub the infide of the cafk well with yeaft, it will help to four 
the cabbage, and prevent the fait liquor from running out. 
When there is a quantity cut (not all which is to be done), 
fpread it upon a dry table, fait it moderately, and roll it well. 
Do not pull too much at a time, as it cannot be worked thro* 
fufficiently ; ftrew a little coriander-feed over it, if agreeable. 
Put it into the cafk, and prefs it down very hard ; repeat this 
till the cafk is quite full ; cover it with vine-leaves, put a dry 
cloth over them, and leave it till next morning, then put on 
the head of the cafk over the leaves and cloth, and put a very 
heavy weight upon it, to keep it quite clofe. October is the 
proper time to do it ; it will be fit to eat in two months. 
When the cabbage is taken out to drefs, be careful to take off 
all that looks whitifli ; it is not good till it begins to grow 
yellow ; the deeper the cabbage lies, the finer and better it 
will be. When what is wanted is taken out for one dreffing, 
cover the cabbage with vine-leaves, as long as they can be got, 
and when they fail, with a dry cloth. Take great care the 
fait liquor does not run out, if it does, the cabbage will infal- 
libly fpoil. Boil the cabbage with a good deal of butter in a 
well-tinn'd veiTel ; put no more water than juft enough to 

Z 4 cover 



344 THE LADY's ASSISTANT. 

cover if, with a flieet of paper over it, and let it boil till fuft- 
ciently done. 

$0 keep Callage Lettuce. 

AT the latter end of the feafon, take fome very dry fand, 
and cover the bottom of a barrel made on purpofe ; then put 
in the lettuces fo as not to touch each other ; there muft not 
be above two rows laid one upon another j cover them well 
with fand, and fet them in a dry place j be very careful the 
froft does not come at them : the lettuce muft not be cut, but 
pulled at the root. 



PICKLES. 

LWAYS ufe ftone jars for hot pickles, as vinegar will 
\. penetrate through all earthen veflels, (lone and glafs e\- 
ccpted. Never let. the hand touch the pickle, but tie a pickle- 
ipcon to every jar. 

'To fickle Cucumbers. 

THE fmall long fort are the belt ; let them be frefh gathered. 
Pull oft' the bioffoms, do not rub them ; pour over them a llrong 
brine of fait and water, boiling hot ; cover them clofc, let them 
fbnd all night ; the next day ftir them gently, to take off the 
fand ; drain them on a fieve, and dry them with a cloth : make 
a pickle with the beft white wine vinegar, ginger, pepper long 
and round, garlic, if not difliked ; when the pickle boils, throw 
in the cucumbers, cover them, make them boil up as quick as 
pofiible for three or four minutes ; put them into a jar with 
the pickle, and cover them very dole; when cold, put in a 
fprig of dill, the feed downward. They will be exceedingly 
crifp and green done in this manner ; but if they do not Ionic 
quite fo green as they fhould, boil up the pickle again the ne;.t 
(lay, and pour k on the cucumbers immediately. 

Another Way. 

PUT them in a {lone jar; take as much fpring-water a 
will cover them : to every gallon of water, put as much fait as 
will bear an egg; make it boiling hot, and pour it upon the 
.cumbers-, cover them with a woollen cloth, and over that a 
\ cvter difh i tie them down dole, and let them itand twenty- 
four 



THE LADY's ASSISTANT. 345 

four hours, then take them out, lay them upon a cloth and dry 
them j wipe the jar clean, put in the cucumbers, with a little 
dill and fennel ; then take fome vinegar; to every three quarts, 
put in one quart of fpring-water, till there is enough to cover 
them ; put in a little bay fait, and a little white fait ; to every 
gallon of pickle put one nutmeg cut in quarters, a quarter of 
an ounce of cloves, and the fame of mace, a quarter of an 
ounce of whole pepper, and a large race of ginger diced : boil 
thefe all up together; pour the pickle boiling hot upon the 
cucumbers, and cover them as before. Let them ftand two 
days, then cover them again; if they are not green, boil them 
again, and when cold, cover them with a bladder and leather : 
keep pickles always clofe covered, and under the pickle ; a 
wooden fpoon, with holes in it, is the beil thing to take them 
out with. 

N. B. Obferve not to boil the fpice, but to pour the boiling 
vinegar over it. 

Sliced Cucumbers. 

PARE them, and flice them a little thicker than for the 
table ; put them into a cullender, with a handful of fait; the 
next day dry them, put them into a jar with fliced onion, and 
horfe-radim in layers. Make a pickle with white-wine vinegar, 
mace, cloves, nutmeg fliced, and whole pepper; boil this half 
an hour, and pour it on the cucumbers immediately: if they 
are to look as if frefh cut, ufe double-diftilled vinfgarj but 
they eat quite as well with white-wine vinegar. 

Onions. 

PEEL (mail onions into fait and water; fhift them once a 
day for three days, then fet them over the fire in milk and wa- 
ter till ready to boil ; dry them ; pour over them the following 
pickle when boiled, and cold Double-diftilled vinegar, fait, 
mace, a bay-leaf or two; they will not look white with any 
other vinegar, 

Mujhrobms. 

PUT fome buttons into milk and water, wipe them from it 
with a piece of Hannel, and throw them into fpring-water and 
fait; boil fome fait and water, put in the buttons, boil them 
up four or five minutes; drain them q-uick ; cover them clofe 
between two cloths, and dry them well ; boil a pickle of dou- 
ble-di|Ulled vinegar and macej when cold, put in the buttons ; 

pour 



THE LADY's ASSISTANT. 

pour oil on the top : they fhould be put into fmall glafles, as 
they do not keep well after they arc opened. I always have 
them look as white as poffible done in this manner, and keep 
the year round. 

N. !* Some boil them in milk, which is a very good way. 

Walnuts. 

PUT a hundred of large double nuts into a {lone jar; take 
four ounces of black pepper, one ounce of Jamaica pepper, 
two ounces of ginger, one ounce of cloves, one pint of muftard- 
feed, a head or two of garlic, four handfuls of fait ; bruife the 
fpice and the muftard-feed, and boil them in vinegar fufficient 
to cover the nuts; when cold, put it to them : two days after 
boil up the pickle ; pour it to the nuts immediately : cover 
them clofc : repeat it three days. 

Another Way. 

TO a hundred of walnuts put half a pound of whole black 
pepper, a quarter of a pound of race ginger fliced thin, half a 
pound of flour of muftard, a handful of the tops of garlic ; fill 
the jar with vinegar; cover it ciofe with a bladder : as the 
vinegar waftes fill up the jar. 

N. B. According to the firft receipt, they arc not fit to eat 
under fix or eight months : to the latter (which is the beft) 
twelve months; but they are then exceedingly good, and never 
turn either black or foft, which they always do when done firil: 
in fait and water. 

I'o pickle Walnuts to look Green. 

TAKE the largeft double walnuts, pare them very thin, and 
put them into a tub of fpring-water as they are pared, put to 
them, if two or three hundred of nuts, a pound of bay-falt ; 
leave them in the water four-and-twenty hours, then put them 
into a ftone jar, a layer of vine-leaves and a layer of walnuts ; 
fill it up with cold vinegar, and when they have flood all night, 
pour the vinegar from them into a copper, with a good quan- 
tity of bay-falt; fet it upon the fire and let it boil, then pour it 
hot on the nuts; tie them over with a woollen cloth, and let 
them ftand a week; then pour that pickle from them, rub the 
nuts clean with a piece of flannel, and put them again into the 
jar with vine-leaves as before mentioned; boil trc(h vinegar; 
to every gallon of vinegar, four or five pieces of ginger, a quar- 
ter of an ounce of cloves, a nutmeg fliced, a quarter of an

fame four or five times; when the vinegar is cold, put in half 
a pint of muftard-feed, a ftick of horfe-radifh fliced, tie them 
down clofe with a bladder, and then with leather; they will

der fix months. 

French Beans. 

POUR over them a boiling hot brine, cover them clofe ; the 
next day drain and dry them; pour over them a boiling hot

If they are riot green enough, boil the vinegar again. 

Another Way to -pickle Mangoes. 

TAKE out the feeds of either melons or cucumbers, wipe 

them quite dry, fill them with muftard-feed, a little garlic, 

two cloves of efchalot, nutmeg and ginger diced, fome mace, 

whole pepper, and cloves, with a little fait ; then tie or few on

'To pickle green Almonds.

Capers. 

CAPERS are the flower-buds of a fmall fhrub, preferved in 
pickle : the tree which bears them is called the caper (hrub or 
buih : it is common in the weftern parts of Europe : we have 
them in fome gardens, but the principal place for pickled ca- 
pers is at Toulon : we have fome from Lyons, but they are 
flatter, and lefs firm ; and fome come from Majorca, -but they 
are" fait and difagreeable : the fineft-flavoured are from Toulon. 
They gather the buds from the blofloms before they open, then 
fpread them upon the floor in a room where no fun enters, then 
let them lie till they begin to wither; 'they then throw them 
into a tub of fharp vinegar ; and after three days they add a 
quantity of bay-falt : when this is difibived, they are fit for 
packing for fale, and are fent to all parts of Europe. 

The fineft capers are thofe of a moderate fize, firm, and 
clofe, and fuch as have the pickle highly flavoured : thofe that 
are foft, flabby 3 and half-open, are of little value. 

Olives. 

OLIVES are the fruits of trees, which grow wild in the 
warmer parts of Europe : we have thqm in fotne cf our gar- 
dens j but with us they will not ripen to any perfection. 

There are three kinds, the Italian., Spanilh, and French ; 

~* Made from four ale, 

A a we 



354 THE LADY's ASSISTANT. 

we have them therefore of various fixes and flavours : fome 
prefer one, and frmc the other. 

The fine fallad oil, as has been before mentioned, is made 
from this fruit, for which purpofe they are gathered ripe ; but 
f'>r pickling they are gathered when half-ripe, at the latter end 
of June : they are put into frefli water to foalc for two days ; 
after this they throw them into lime-water, in which fome 
pcail-afhes have been difiblved : they lie in this liquor fix-and- 
thirty hours; then they are thrown into water which has h.id 
b.iy-falt difiblved in it: this is the laft preparation, and they 
are fent over to us in this liquor: they are naturally as they 
grow on the tree very bitter, and therefore require all thefe pre- 
parations to bring them to their tine flavour. To fome olives 
they add a fmall quantity of eflcnce of fpices, which is an oil 
drawn from cloves, nutmeg, cinnamon, coriander, and fwcct 
fennel-feed diftilled together for that purpofe : twelve drops 
are enough for a bufhel of olives : fome prefer them flavoured 
with this eflence, but others like them beft plain. 

To pickle Capficum Pods. 

GATHER the pods, with the ftalks on, before they turn 
red: cut a flit down the fide with a pen-knife, and take out 
all the feeds, but as little of the meat as poflible ; lay them in 
a ilrong brine for three days, changing it every day ; th^n take 
them o"ut, lay them on a cloth, and lay another over them till 
they are quite dry ; boil vinegar enough to cover them, put 
into it fome mace and nutmeg beat fmall : put the pods into 
a glafs or jar, and when the liquor is cold, pour it over, then 
tie a bladder and leather over them. 

To pickle Purjlain Stalks. 

WASH the ftalks, and cut them in pieces fix inches long ; 
put them into water and fait, and let them boil up about a 
dozen times; then ftrain the liquor from them : make a pickle 
of ftale beer, white-wine vienegar, and fait: when they are 
cold put them in, and cover them clofe. 

To pickle Fennel. 

TAKE fome fpring-water, and when it boils put in the fen- 
nel tied in bunches, with fome fait; do not let it boil, but 
when it is of a fine green dry it on a cloth ; when it is cold 
put it in a glafs, with fome nutmeg and mace, fill it with cold

being green enough do not require a thin fugar to bring them 
to a colour ; but, on the contrary, if too much heated, they 
will turn to too dark a green ; the next day boil the fyrup and 
put it upon them ; the day after, boil it till it is very fmooth ; 
the day following give all a boil together, fcum them, and let 
them lie four or five days ; if they are to be dried, put them

evaporated. I muft obfcrve, that, in boiling, I never take off 
the fcum ; but, on the contrary, have it v/dl mixed with the 
liquor whilft boiling, by means of a jet ; when this is done, I 
draw it off into under-backs, by a cock at the bottom of the 
copper, where I let it remain till it is only as warm as new* 
milk. At this time 1 turn it up, and fuffer it to ferment in the 
vcflel, where it wiH form a thick head. As foon as it has done 
working, I ftop it down very clofe, in order to keep the air 
from it as much as poffiblc. I keep this, us well as all my 
mead, in a cellar or vault I have for the purpofc, bciiv- very 
tlccp and cool ; and the door fhuts fo clofe, as to fccep out, in 
a manner, all the outward air ; fo that the liquor is always in 
the fame temperature, being not at all affected by chane of 
\vcather ; and to this I attribute, in a great mcafurc, the ejood- 
jiefs of my mead. Another proportion I have of making mead 
is to allow eighty pounds of purified honey to one hundred and 
twenty gallons of foft water, which I manage in the makin 
in all refpefls, like that firft above mentioned } and it proves 
very pleafant, good, light drinking, and is by many preferred 
to the other, which is much richer, and has a fuller flavour - 
but at the fame time it is more inebriating, and apt to m.ikc 
the head ach, if drank in too large quantities ; therefore, 
upon the whole, I imagine the laft to be the proportion that 
makes the wholefomeft liquor for common drink ; the other 
being rather, when properly prefer ved, a rich cordial, fomc- 
thing like fine old Malaga, which, when in perfection, is 
cfleemed the belt of the Spanifh wines. I chufc, in general to 
have this liquor pure and genuine, though many love it be ft 
When it has an aromatic flavour fuch mix elder, rofemary, 
and marjoram flowers with it ; and ufe cinnamon, cloves' 
ginger, pepper, and cardamoms, in various proportions, ac- 
cording to their tafle. Others put in a mixture of thyme, 
eglantine, marjoram, and rolemary, with various fpices ; but 1 
<io not approve this laft practice at all, as green herbs arc apt 
to make mead drink flat ; and too many "cloves, bchdes in- 
fluencing it greatly in the taite, make it hi o h-colourcd. I 

never bottle my mead before it is half a year old j and when 
I do, I take care to have it well corked, and keep it in the 
fame vaulc wherein ic itood whilft in the calk, 



THE LADY's ASSISTANT. 463 

Another Way to make Mead. 

TO five quarts of honey put fixty quarts of water., eighteen 
races of fliced ginger, and one handful of rofemary ; let them 
boil three hours, and continue fcumming while they boil ; when 
it is cold put in the yeaft, and it will be fit to bottle in eight 
or ten days. 

7*0 make fmall Mead. 

TO a gallon of water, two pounds of honey, one pound of 
fagar ; boil it an hour, put in the whites of three or four eggs,

put in a toaft with honey to make it work ; then tun it, and

then ftop it cloie : in fix months it will be fit to draw. 

Cow/lip Wine. 

TO fix sallons of water put thirty pounds of Malaga rai- 
fins ; boil the water full two hours, and then meafure it out of 
the copper upon the raifins, which muft be chopped fmall, and 
put into a tub ; let them work together ten days, ftirring it 
feveral times a day ; then ftrain it off, and prefs the raifins 
hard, to get out their ftrength ; then take two fpoonfuls of 
o-ood ale yeaft, beat up with it fix ounces of fyrup of lemons, 
put in three pecks of cowflips by degrees ; let all the ingre- 
dients work together three days, ftirring it three or four times 
a day, then tun it up j bottle it at four months end. 

'To make Currant Wine.

pvv 



464 THE LADY's ASSISTANT. 

let it (land ten or twelve months you muft not flop it up 
until it hath done Tinging : when you draw it off, bottle all 
that is fine ; and let the thick run through a flannel bag, nnd 
put it into the cafk again with a little fugar, juft to keep it 
from fpoiling, and let it fland until it is fine. When you firft 
put your wine into your cafk, before it has done working, you 
muft lay a piece of paper over the bung j and when it hath 
done working, flop it up clofe. 

That which is racked off through the flannel muft be flop- 
ped up directly, when put into the ca(k. 

N. B. A pint of brandy may be put in when it is working 
(that is, in a ftate of fermentation) and another pint when 
the fermentation is flopped : the above quantity of brandy to 
about twenty gallons of wine. 

Another Way to make Currant Wine. 

TAKE five quarts of the juice of currants ; fourteen pounds 
of fugar will make a five-gallon cafk ; fill it up with water, 
and let it all work together ; when it has done working, put 
in a quart of brandy, and a hop or two. 

Orange Wine. 

TO every fix gallons of fpring-watcr, one flone of the befl 
powder fugar, and the whites of five eggs beat up to a froth ; 
let it boil near two hours flowly ; when it is quite cold, add

as much fyrup of citron, or of oranges ; let it fland two days 
and two nights ; when it is tunned, add to it two bottles of 
mountain wine ; tun up the rinds and all together. Let it 
fland fix months or more ; if it is not fine in that time, it muft 
be fined, and muft be looked at once a week : as it fomctitnes 
works in the veffel, it muft have air by a vent. 

Vino Pontificate. 

STEEP the zcft rinds of fix oranges and fix lemons twenty- 
four hours in a gallon of good brandy, clofe flopped ; boil one 
pound and a haff of loaf- fugar in two gallons of water a quar- 
ter of an hour, and clarify it with the whites of ten eggs ; 
when it is cold add the juice of twenty-four oranges and five 
lemons to the gallon of brandy ; then mix it all together, and 
flrain off" the rinds : put the liquor into a cafk well flopped ; 
after fix weeks draw it off into bottles, ic will then be fit for 
ufe, but grows better for keeping,

REMARKS 

O N 

KITCHEN-POISONS. 

CONTAINING 

CAUTIONS RELATIVE TO THE USE OF 

LAUREL-LEAVES, HEMLOCK, MUSHROOMS, 

COPPER-VESSELS, E ARTHEN.J ARS, &c. 

WITH 

Obfervations on the ADULTERATION of BREAD and 
And the NATURE and PROPERTIES of WATER, 



ON KITCHEN-POISONS. 

I. The Lauro-Cerafus, cr Common Laurel. 

TH E water diltilled from the leaves of this tree has been fre- 
quently mixed with brandy, and other fpirituous liquors, in 
order to give them the flavour of ratifia ; and the leaves are often ufed 
in cookery, to communicate the fame kind of talte to creams, cuftards. 
puddings, and fome forts of fweetmeats. But, in the year 1728, 
an account of two women dying fuddenly in Dublin, after drink- 
jng fome of the. common diftilled laurel-water, gave rife to feveral 
experiments, made upon dogs, with the diftilled water, and with 
the infufion of the leaves of the lauro-cerafus, communicated by 
Dr. Madden, phyfician at Dublin, to the Royal Society in Eng- 
land, and afterwards repeated (in the year 1731) and confirmed by 
Dr. Mortimer, F. R. S. by which it appeared, that both the water 
and the infufion brought on convulfions, palfy, and death, 

The laurus of the ancients, or the bay, is, on the contrary, of a 
falutary nature, and of ufe in feveral diforders. 

The lauro-cerafus is a plant of a very deleterious kind, and, in 
a large quantity, moft formidably poifonous ; yet, when adminif- 
tered wiih proper caution, and in fmall proportion, the leaves of 
the plant are generally thought not otherwife than innocent; and 
therefore., for kitchen purpofes, as the flavouring of cuftards, &c.

the ufe, in guarded and common moderation, may be continued in 
perfect: fafety. The bitter pares of the pia.it, in which alfo the 
71 w.v.t properties are fuppofed to reude, are determined to be the 
fame in quality, and not fenfibly difF.-Tint in degree, from the bit- 
icr almond, and the kernels of any of the Aoned fruits; and in Hol- 
land, Liunsus mentions, th.it an infufion of th\? kind of laurr! is 
ufed in the practice of the healing art. Miller alfo fayi, that 
laurel-leaves are perfectly innocent ; a nice attention is however 
certainly neceflary in the ufe of them. 

The remedy againft the poifonous laurel is from ten to forty 
drops of fal ammoniac, in a glafs of water, repealed, as . 
toms may require. 

2. Small Hemlock, or Fools ParJIey. 

Defcription. 

THE firft leaves are divided into numerous fmall part?, which 
are of a pale green, oval, pointed, and deeply indented. The lta!k 
is flender, round, upright, llriated, and about a yard high, 
flowers are white, growing at the tops of the branches in lir.lc 
umbels. It is an annual plant, common in orchards and kitchen 
gardens, and flowers in June and July. This plant has been often 
millaken for parfiey : and from thence it has received the naine of 
fools ParJIy. 

Though it feems not to be of fo virulent a nature as the larger 
hemlock, yet Boerhaave places it among the vegetable poifons, in 
his Inftitutes ; and, in his Hiilory of Plants, produces an inlHnce 
of its pernicious effect?. It is therefore n^ceflary to guard againit 
It in collecting herbs for failads, and other purpofes. 

3. Mujbrooms, 

MUSHROOMS have b^en long ufed in fauce.% in ketchup, and 
other forms of cookery. They V.T:;> highly eftecmed by the Ro- 
mans, as they are at prefent by the French, Italians, and other na- 
tions. 

Pliny exclaims againft the luxury of his countrymen in this arti- 
cle ; and wonders, what extraordinary pkvfure there can be, in 
mating fuch dangerous feed. The ancient v.;::cr; on the Materia 
M'.'dica feem to agree, that mufnrooms are in gencr.'.] unwholcfome; 
and the moderns, Lemcrv, Allen, GeofFroy, ik;.'rh.;;:v-c, Linn;cus, 
and others, concur in the fame opinion. There are numerous in- 
ftances upon record of tiu'ir fatal efl'cd?. Almoll all of them, as 
the laft-mentioned author affirms, li arc fraught with poifon." 

The common efculcnt kinds, if eaten too trrch , frequently bring 
on heart-burns, ficknefles, vomitings, di. . dyfcntcijrs, and 

other dangerous fymptonis. Jt i- t'l'-refore to be \vidied, that they 
were banifhcd from the table. But, , ..ili be indui ' 

in thrfe treacherous gratifications or, a- S :a rails thrm, this

THE LADY's ASSISTANT. 475 

collect fuch as are abfolutely pernicious; which, conndcring to 
v/hofe care this is generally committed, may, and undoubtedly has, 
frequently happened. 

The eatable mufnrooms at firft appear of a ronndifh form, like a 
button ; the upper part and the Ita'lk are very white : the under 
part is of a livid flem-colour ; but the flefhy part, when broken, 
is very white. When thefe are fuffered to remain undilcurbed, 
they will grow to a large fize, and expand themidves almoit to 
a flatnefs, and the red part underneath will change to a dark 
colour. 

Cotftr Fefils. 

COPPER, when it is hat.'died, yields an offensive fmell, and if 
touched with the tongue, a lharp pungent talle, aud even excites a 
naufea. Verdegris is nothing but a iukuion of this metal by ve- 
getable acids. And it is well known, that a very frnall quantity 
of this folution will produce cholics, vomitings, intolerable thirir, 
universal convulfions, and other dangerous fymptoms. If thefe 
efrbPcs, and the prodigious divifibility of this metal be considered, 
there can be no doubt of its being a violent and fubtile pcifon : 
we are daily expofed to this poifon by the ufe of copper veflels for 
oreffing our food. The very air of the kitchen, abounding with 
oleaginous and faline particles, penetrates and difpofes them to dif- 
folution, before they are ufeJ. Water, by Handing fome time in 
a copper veflel, is impregnated with verdegris, as may be demon- 
ftrated by throwing into it a fmall quantity of any volatile alkali,, 
which will immediately tinge it with a paler or deeper blue, in pro- 
portion to the ruft contained in the water. Vinegar, spole-fauce, 
greens, oil, greafe, butter, and almoft every other kind of food, 
will cxtracl the verdegris in a greater degree. It is true, people 
imap-ine, that the ill effects of copper are prevented by ics being 
tinned ; but the tin, which adheres to the copper, is fo extrerrv.-i v 
thin, that it is foon penetrated by the verdegris, which inlinuatf.-s 
itfelf through the pores of that metal, and appears green upon the 
furface. 

Verdegris is one of the mod violent poifons in nature : yet, ra- 
ther than quit an old cuftom, the greater part of mankind are con- 
tent to fwallow fome of this poifon every day. 

Our food receives its quantity ofpoifcn in the kitchen, by the 
ufe of copper pans and dirties. The brewer mingles poifon in our 
beer, by boiling it in a copper. Salt is difuibuted to the people 
from copper fcales, covered with vcrdegris. Pickled cucumbers 
are rendered green by an in fu lion of copper coin. The pailry- 
cook bakes our tarts in copper patty-pans. But confections and 
fyrups have greater powers of deitrudlion : for they are fet over a 
fire in copper vefiel?, which have not been tinned ; and the verde- 
gris is plentifully extracied by the acidity of the compofitinn. 
And though \ve do not, after all, fwallow death in a fingie dofe, 
yet it is certain, that a quantity of poifon, however fraall, which 

is 



476 THE LADY's ASSISTANT. 

li repeated with every meal, mud produce more fatal effects than 
is generally believed. 

Bell-metal kettles are very often ufcd in boiling cucumbers for 
pickling, in order to make them green. This is an abfurd and 
dangerous practice. If the cucumbers acquire any additional green- 
nefs by the ufe of thefe kettles, they can only derive it from the 
copper, of which they are made. 

According to fome writers, bell-metal is a compofition of tin and 
copper, or pewter and copper, in the proportion of twenty pounds 
of pewter, or twenty-throe pounds of tin, to one hundred weight of 
copper. According to others, this metal is made of copper, a 
thoufand pounds ; tin, from two to three hundred pounds ; and 
brafs, one hundred and fifty pounds. 

Spoons and other kitchen utenf:ls are frequently made of a mixed 
metal, called alchemy; or, as it is vulgarly pronounced, ockimy. 
The rufl of this metal, as well as the former, is highly pernicious. 

The author of a tract, entitled, " Serious Reflections on the 
Dangers attending the Ufe of Copper Veflels," publifhed at Lon- 
don in 1755, aflerts, that " the greater frequency of pahies, apo- 
plexies, madnefs, and all the frightful train of nervous difurders, 
which fuddenly attack us, without our being able to account for the 
caufc, or which gradually weaken our vital faculties, are the poifon- 
ous effects of this pernicious matter, taken into the body infenfibly 
v,ith our victuals, and thereby intermixed with our blood and 
juices." 

However this may be, it is certain, that thrre have been innu- 
merable inftances of the pernicious confequcnces of eating food 
(arcfled in copper vefTels, not fufficiently cleaned from this ruit. On 
this account the Senate of Sweden, about the year 1753, prohibited 
copper veiTels, and ordered, that none but fuch as were made of iron 
fhould be ufed in their fleets and armies. 

But if copper veflels are ftill continued, every cook and good 
Iioufewife mould be particularly careful in keeping them clean and, 
well-tinned: and ftiould fuffer nothing to remain in them longer 
than is abfolutely necefTary for the purpole of cookery. 

Remedy. 

" The common cure," fays Dr. Mead, " of all poifons taken into 
the ftomach, mull be by throwing them up again, by vomiting as 
toon as poflible, and defending the membranes from their pungent 
acrimony. Drinking very large quantities of warm rnilk, with oil 
of iweet almonds, till the vomiting ceafcs, will anfwcr the firll in- 
tention. The other, in mineral poifons, (for the effects of vegetable 
poifons, after they have been vomited up, generally go off by di- 
luting plentifully with foft and fat liquids) requires particular care, 
which may be in this way. The force of thefe depends upon a 
combination of metallic particles with feline crvftals : therefore the 
difuniting of thcfe mufl dcftroy their power. This may b" done by 
a quantity of a lixivium made by a folution oi'falt oJ tartar

will, after fome degree of effervefcence, kill it, as the chemifts 
fpeak ; by which means, being difengaged from the mineral glo- 
bules, it will be rendered of no efreft. 1 " 

The Solution or Sait of Lead. 

LEAD is araetal eafily corroded, efpecially by the warm fleams 
of acids, fuch as vinegar, cyder, lemon -juice, rheniih-wine, Sec, 
And this folution, or fait of lead, is a flow and infiduous, though 
certain poifon. The glazing of all our common brown pottery ware 
is either lead or lead ore. If black, it is lead ore, with a frnall 
proportion of manganefe, which is a fpecies of iron ore. If yel- 
low, the glazing is lead ore, and appears yellowifh by having fome 
pipe or white clay under it. The colour of the common pottery 
\vare is red, as the veiTels are made of the fame clay with commom 
bricks. Thcfe veffels are fo porous, that they are penetrated by all 
faits, acid or alkaline, and are unfit for retaining any faline fub- 
i?ance. They are improper, though too often ufed, for preferving 
four fruits or pickles. The glazing of fuch vefFels is corroded by 
the vinegar ; for, upon evaporating the liquor, a quantity of the 
fait of lead will be found at the bottom. A fure way of judging 
whether the vinegar, or other acids, have difTolved part of the glaz- 
ing, is, by cheir becoming vapid, or lofing their fharpnefs, and ac- 
quiring a fweetifh tafte by ftanding in them for fome time: in 
which cafe the contents are to be thrown away as pernicious. 

The fubftance of the pottery ware commonly called Delft, the 
beft being made at De-lft in Holland, is a whitifn clay when baked, 
and fcft, as not having endured a great heat in baking. The glaz- 
ing is a compofuion of calcined lead, calcined tin, fand, fome 
coarfe alkaline fait, and fandiver ; which being run into a white 
glafs, the white colour being owing to the tin, is afterwards 
ground in a mi!! 3 then mixed with water, and the veflels, after be- 
ing baked in the furnace, are dipped into it, and put into the fur- 
nace a fecond time ; by which mean?, with a f mall degree of heat, 
the white glafs runs upon the veffels. This glazing is exceedingly 
ibft; and easily cracks. What effects acids will have upon it, the 
author of thefe cbfervations cannot fay, not having tried them ; 
but they feem to be improper for infpiilating the juice of lemons. 
Oranges, or any other acid fruits. 

The moft proper vefTels ff.r thefe purpofes are porcelain or china 
ware. Thefubftance of them is of fo clofe a texture, that no faline, 
or other liquor, can penetrate them. The glazing, which is made 
likewife of the fubilance of the china, is fo firm and clofc, that no 
fait or faline fubftance can have the leaft effect upon it. It muft, 
however, be obferved, that this remark is only applicable to the 
porcelain made in China : for fome fpecies of the European manu- 
factory are certainly glazed with a fine glafs of lead, &c. 

Next to china is the ftone ware, commonly called the Stafford- 
fhire ware. The- fubifcncs of th,efe veflels is a compofition of black

REMARKS ON THE ADULTERATION OF ERE. 

AND FLOUR. 

IN tli- fop' ^n cf flour, mealmen and baker: have been known 

to ufs bean-meal, chalk, whiting, ilaked lime, alum, and even 
s of bones. The firil, bean- flour, is pcrfcftly innocent, an 
; '.: e^uai to that of wheat ; but there ii a toe 

, ,;.r, ami its colour is dufky. To remove thefe . 

cha r .led to whiten it, alum to give the whole compuuna that 

conr.ltence which is nccellary to make it knead well in the dough., 
and iahp to take off the ailringency. It may be fuppofcd, I 
tbeie horrid iniquities are only imaginary, or at leaft ej .red, 

and that fuch. mixtures muft be difcoverable even by the molt or- 
. :s (ome adulterations of this nature have certainly 
i .i.-atik-d, the following experiments may ferve to gratify cu- 
.: , .. or difcover frauds, where any fuch exilt. 

<c '-f-Q difcov r whether flour be adulterated with whiting or 

Ik, mix with it feme juice of lemon or good vinegar. If the 

/lour be pure, they will remain together at reft ; but if there be a 

mixture of whiting or chalk, a fermentation, like the working cf 

:r, will enfac. The adulterated meal is whiter and heavier than 

rood : the quantity that an ordinary tea-difh will contain h:<s 

been found to weigh more than the fame quantity of genuine flour, 

by four drahms and 19 grains Troy. 

" The regular method to detect thefe frauds in bread L this : 

Cu: the crumb of a loaf into ve:y thin flices ; break them, but no: 

into very final 1 pieces, and put ihem into a glafs cucurbit, v, ith a 

large quantity of water. Set thi:, without fluking, in a fand furnace,

THE LADY's ASSISTANT. 479 

celt : but as cucurbits, and fand furnaces, are not at hand in private 
families, there is a more familiar method. 

" Let the crumb of a loaf be lliced, as before directed, and put 
it, with a great deal of water, into a large earthen pipkin. Let 
this be fet over a very gentle nre, and kept a long time moderately 
hot ; and the pap being poured off, the bone aihes, or other ingre - 
dients, will be found at the bottom." 



ON WATER. 

T is a long-eftabHGied obfervation, that the beft waters boil and 
cool again the foorreir. ; and that they evaporate in the lead time, 
and with the leall degree of heat. 

A well-known mark of the purity of water is its foftnefs. This 
quality is difcoverable by the touch, if we only wafh, our hands in 
it : and the diitintUon between hard and foft water generally arifes 
from its difficult or eafy union with oily fubftances. 

Soft water is the moft proper for the wafhing and bleaching of 
linen, the making of paper, and for moil medicinal purpofes. It 
.mixes more uniformly with milk, and docs not curdle it, as hard 
waters frequently do. It boils peafe and beans fcfter, and mixes 
better with flour, rice, oatmeal, Sec. In boiling meat, it gives 
it a more agreeable colour than hard water, which often boils it 
red. 

There are however feme purpofes, to which hard water is more 
proper: as, in feveral kinds of dying ; in making ftarch ; and in 
the riniing of foap out of linen, after it has been warned; as it is 
obferved to give the linen a belter colour, and an agreeable firmnefs 
or crifpnefs ; but the linen thus treated requires more foap, when it 
comes to be warned again. Hard water gives a better colour to 
greens, and a firmnefs to all fjrts of fifh, efpecially cod, when boiled 
in it. 

The Burton,, Nottingharnfhire, Liverpool, and feveral other kinds 
of ale, which are much admired, are faid to be brewed with hard 
water. But Dr. Mead and others condemn the ufe of thefe liquors, 
as productive cf various diforders, and particularly the cholic. 

From thefe remarks we may reafonably infer, that hard water 
cannot fo well anfwer the purpofes of diluting and digeiting our 
food ; as it will not fo readily mix and unite with the different parts 
of it, nor afiimilate and digeft them properly. Be/ides, the large 
quantities of acid and nitrous fairs, with the loads of fclenite and 
calcareous earth, which thefe waters generally contain, will natu- 
rally difpofe them to form obilruclions, when, by the courfe of cir- 
culation, thefe folid particles come into the minuteft vefiels, more 
efpecially thofe of the glands. Hence they are often blamed, 33 
laying the foundation of fcrophulous, ftrumous, and other glandu- 



lar fwelihjgs aad obftnic~tic;is. 



It 



4 8o THE LADY's ASSISTANT. 

' It is from the quantity cf ftony matter, which the hard water. 1 ; 
generally contain, th-t moll of them leave large incruftations upon, 
the fides of the veiU-Ji in which they are boiled ; and they have bv 
fome been difapproved for this rcafon, as caufing the Rone. Hue 
the calculous concretions in the bladder and kidneys are of a very 
different nature from thefe incruftations ; and, as Dr. Heberden 
juftly obferves, " they totally differ from all foflil Hones in every 
thing except the name; and the pretended experience of the effect^ 
of certain ftony waters in breeding the Hone, may, upon the belt 
authorities, be rejected as falfe." 

The bed way of determining the hardnefs or foftnefs of water, ir> 
by fcrapingany certain quantity of ioap into it, and obferving how 
it diflblves or lathers. If water be perfectly foft, the foap will dif- 
iblve quickly, uniformly, and without curdling ; and, upon ihaking 
the glafs brifkly, will raii'c a llrong froth or lather at the top. But 
the fmallcft degree of hardnefs will fhew itfelf, either by the foap 
not diflblving fo readily, by its turning curdly and uneven, or by 
lefs froth remaining after it is agitated; and the different degree:, 
of hardnefs may hereby be very well determined. The beft way of 
making this trial is with a fmall quantity of Caftilc foap, viz. about 
2. grain to an ounce water. 

Raiit-wafert 

In fummer-time fain. water brings along with it the feeds and 
embryos of vegetables and animalcula, which render it difagreeable 
to the taile, and promote its putrefaction. If it be kept in wooden 
reflels, it will loon (link, and become unfit for ufe ; and then, if it 
be viewed with a microicope, it will be found to contain an amaz- 
ing number of various animalcula; and particularly thofe which, 
irom their form and motion, are called the wheel animals. Thefe 
animalcula are fuppofed to be the chief caufe of the water's putre- 
faction. 

Rain-water is a little hard, when it firft f*lls ; but in two or 
three days it becomes perfectly foft. 

The rain, which falls through the fmoke of large towns, is ren- 
dered foul and black ; more eipecially if it be collected, as it gene* 
rally is, from the roofs of houfcs ; when it brings with it a great many 
particles of foot, which give it a very difagreeable tafte and colour. 
Where the tiles are blackened by the fmoke of glafs-houfes, &c. the 
water which falls from them is unfit for almoft any domeftic purpofes. 
When rain-water fubfides, and is well filtered, it becomes per- 
fedtly clear and bright. If it be kept in wooden vdlels, it contracts 
a particular fmell, taite, and colour from the wood. 

Clean earthen jars are the belt for keeping water. Though leaden 
citterns may. be ufed with i.ifety, if they be kept clear from vegetable 
acids; all of which are found to corrode lead, and to produce a 
very noxious fait. The vci-lls in which water is preforved mould 
be covered, to prevent any dud or tilth from getting in ; and the 
water will be more agreeable, if kept in a cool place.

Some of the greateft philofophers and phyficians have differed 
much in their opinion of fnow- water. Hippocrates, Hoffman, and 
others, condemn it. But Boerhaave, on the other hand, is lavifh in. 
its encomiums. He aflerts, that fnow, which is collected from the 
tops of high fandy mountains, at a diftance from any towns or 
houfes, where it has fallen after a long fharp froit, in calm weather, 
and lies at a confiderable height above the furface of the earth, pro- 
duces water, " which is the pureft of all, quite immutable, ca- 
pable of being kept for many years, and is a fingular remedy for 
inflammations of the eyes." 

Dr. Rotheram having mentioned the efficacy of fnow-water la 
burns, and in fertilizing the ground, relates the following experi- 
ment; which, though it may appear of a trivial nature, he very 
juftly remarks, is not below the notice of a philofopher. 

" One effeft of fhow, of which I do not remember any where to 
have read, is, that a certain quantity of it, taken up frem from the 
ground, and mixed in a flour-pudding, will fupply the place of 
eggs, and make it equally light. The quantity allotted is two 
table fpoonfuls, inltead of one egg ; and if this proportion be much 
exceeded, the pudding will not adhere together, but will fall to 
pieces in boiling. I afiert this from the experience of my own fa- 
mily ; and any one, who choofes to try it, will find it to be a fad. 

Sp ring -water. 

AS all our fprings are originally fupplied by rain or melted. 
fnow, and hail, llrained through the pores and cavities of the earth, 
their waters will vary according to the different foils, or ftrata, 
through which they pafs. If waters meet wirh nothing in their 
fubterraneous paflages, which will unite with them, or diflblve in 
them, they iiTue out in their greatefc purity. The fprings, which 
come from gravel, fand, or fome light and porous ftones, are ge- 
nerally the pureft and beft : for the water, being filtered through 
their fmall pores, is cleared from almoft every foreign fubilance or 
impurity which it had contracted in the air, acquires an agreeable 
coolnefs, and becomes limpid, bright, and fparkling. 

But, as there are few foils, which do not contain fome kinds of 
fait, or other mineral fubitances, which are foluble in water, moft 
of our fprings are found to partake, in fome raeafure, of the na- 
ture of the foil through which they pafs ; and are innocent, falu- 
tary, or noxious, in proportion to the quantity, kind, or mixture, 
of the various ingredients of which they are compofed, and the 
conilitution of the perfon who ufes them ; and fome of them are of 
great medicinal efficacy.

Pump -water, ejjpecialty in Loader., 

It appears, from the analyfis performed by Dr. Hcberdcn, tliat 
I'cvcral pump-waters in London, which he had examined, and pro- 
bably m oft of" them, contain powder of lime-Hone, and the mine- 
ral acids of vitriol, nitre, and fea-falt, united in various propor- 
tions. Thefe waters are likewife tainted with an oilinefs, which 
gives them a remarkably yellowifli call,, when compared with pure 
diftilled water. It is rcafonablc to think, that waters impregnated 
vith fuch active fubflances, in atjuantity fufficient to render ihem 
difagreeable to the tafte, cannot always be drank with impunity. 
They have accordingly been fufpeded of occafioning pains in the 
flomach and bowels, glandular tumours, and coflivenefs, where the 
iimple lime-ftone prevails ; and diarrhceas, where much of it is 
united with the folution of acids ; and it is probable, that a con- 
tinued ufe of fuch water may be the caufe of many other diforders, 
efpecially to the infirm, and to children. From whence it follows, 
that a change of place may often be of as much ufe to weak per- 
fons, from the change of water, as of air. 

, Some obfcure notion of the unwholefomenefs of pump-water, in- 
duces many perfons to boil it, and let it ftand to grow cold ; by 
which it will indeed be made to part from molt of its unneutralized 
lime-ftone and felenite ; but at the fame time it will become more 
ftrongly impregnated with the faline matter, and therefore it will 
be worfe. 

If a fmall quantity of fait of tartar were added to the water, it 
would readily precipitate both the loofe lime-ftone, and likewife 
that which is united to the acids. Ten or fifteen grains would ge- 
nerally be enough for a pint ; but the exaft proportion would rea- 
dily be found, by continuing to add to it, by little and little, till 
it ceafed to occafion white clouds. This is an eafy way, not only 
of freeing the water from its lime-ftone, but alfo of changing the 
faline part into nitre and fal fylvii, both of which we know, by 
long experience, to be innocent. 

But the beft way of avoiding the bad effects of pump water would 
be, not to make a conftant ufe of it ; and in a place fo well fup- 
plied with river-water as London, there is very little neceflity to 
drink of the fprings r which, in fo large a city, befides their na- 
tural contents, muit collect many additional impurities from cellars, 
burying grounds, common- fewers, and many other often five places, 
with which they undoubtedly often communicate ; fo that it is in- 
weed a wt r.ucr, that we find this water at all tolerable. 

, .?' Nf-~v- River 1 filter. 

RIVER waters partake of the properties of their fprings, and 

che channels through which they run ; yet, in a wonderful man- 

ner, th-f\ TOOT free thcmfejves from their impurities. The motion

of the current *, the abforption of the foil, the fun and rain, have 
each of them a confiderable mare in this effect. 

The Thames-water, efpecially in the neighbourhood of London, 
is mixed with many impure ingredients. It is faid to become 
offenfive in feven or eight days, or fometimes fooner, if it be kept 
in unfeafoned cafks. In this ftate it generates a quantity of foul 
inflammable air, as may be feen by holding the flame of a candle 
to the bung-hole of a cafk, when it is firft opened. But by this 
fermentation it foon purifies itfelf ; and by opening the bung, it, 
will often become fweet in twenty-four hours, and fooner if it be 
poured from one veflel to another, or ventilated. 

Methods by ivbicb Water may be obtained In its greatcjt Purity. 
AS it appears, that almoft all the water ufed in cookery is taint, 
ed with impure ingredients ; rain-water, with a great variety of 
volatile bodies, fuliginous particles, exhalations, invifible feeds, 
and infecls ; river, pond, and well-water, with a mixture of foil 
and mud, decayed vegetables, and the fpawn of vermin ; it will 
be very proper to purify it, before it is uied for drinking, or any 
kitchen purpofe. This may be done by various contrivances. 

1. The water of the Thames, and that of the New River, are 
very often muddy, or tafte ftrongly of weeds and leaves. Dr. He- 
berden acknowledges, that the latter fault cannot eafily be reme- 
died ; but, he obferves, they would foon be freed from their mud- 
dinefs, if kept fome time in an open jar: and he is of opinion, that 
if the water given to very young children were thus purified, ic 
might prevent fome of their bowel-diforders,, and fo contribute a 
little to leffen that amazing mortality among the children which are 
nurfed in London. 

2. Rain-water, when grown putrid, may be eafily rendered 
wholefome again, and may be drank without being offenfive, by 
only boiling it a few moments : for by this expedient the animals 
that are in it will be deftroyed, and, with the reft of the impurities, 
will fubiide to the bottom. If then you make it moderately acid, 
by adding to it v a fmall quantity of acid that is very flrong, it will 
be fit for ufe. This is found to be of excellent fervice under the 
equator, and between the tropics, where the waters putrify in a 
horrible manner, and breed a multitude of infects, and yet muft be 
drank. For the fame reafon, a fmall quantity of the fpirit of vi- 
triol, mixed with water, will prevent its growing putrid and breed- 
ing any animals, and, at the fame time, preferve it wholefome and 
good. 

3. A common way of purifying water is by filtration. Water, 
which is filtrated through porous ftones, is extremely clear and lim- 
pid ; but fome writers have aflerted, that it acquires a petrifying 
quality in its paflage, which, at length, may produce difagreeable 
effe&s. However this may be, thefe itones are too dear for common 
ufe. 

* The moft rapid rivers contain the pureft waters. 

I i 2 Dr. 



484 THE LADY's ASSISTANT. 

Dr. Rotheram aflcrts, that one of the readieft and beft methods o 
filtrating water, is, to let it run through a bed of clean fand. This 
is, he fays, preferable to the filtering-ltone, as it performs its work 
much fooncr ; and the grains of fand are of fo many different 
figures, that they are pretty fure to Hop the progrefs of any bodies 
of fenliblc bulk in palling through them. 

" A friend of mine," fays the Doftor, " in this town [Newcaftle] 
has acillern for collcdting rain-water fo conllructed, that it both al- 
lows the water to fubfide, and the upper part of it to run through a 
bed of land, which is railed by a partition above the bottom of the 
cil!;crn ; by which means the water becomes p'.-rfeclly cle;ir and 
bright, and is preferred, by molt who have talkd it, to any other 
water in this town." 

4. Some have objected, but probably without re.ifon, to this mode 
of hltration, on a preemption that the fand has the fame cfiefl on 
the water as the filtering-Hone : for it is faid, that the fand is in- 
i'cnfibly diflblvcd by the water; fo that in four or five years it will 
have loft a fifth part of its weight. M. Amy therefore recommends 
the filtration of water through a fpunge, more or Icfs compreiTed. 
And this, he afiures us, will render it, not only more clear, but 
more wholcfome, than either a ftone or fand. 

5. As the pureft of all water is obtained by dilullation, Dr. He- 
berden recommends this method, as particularly ufcful where fuc! is 
cheap and the water is bad ; as it is in fome of our foreign fettle- 
rnents. 

The firft running of diililled water has a difagreenble mufty tafts: 
on this account, if the ttill hold twenty gallon?, it will be ncccfl^ry 
to throw away the firft gallon. The reit, though free from this 
muflinefs, will have a cMfngreeablc empyrcunuuic cr burnt tafte. 
This tafte goes oft by keeping about ?. month, by ventilation, in a 
few minutes, or by boiling the warcr in an open veflel. DilHIIed 
water rnuft be kept in perfectly clean glafs or itone bottles, v.ith 
glafs ftoppers, or metal covers ; and then, having in it no principle 
of corruption, it is incapable of being fpoilcd, and will keep j nil the 
fame for ever. But the leaft particle of any animal or vegetable 
fubitancc, will fpoil a great quantity ; and therefore the Hill and 
bottles mould be kept wholly for this life. 

This p'rocefs, though certainly attended with many good effects, 
requires too much time and attention for common ufe ; and therefore 
in general, it may be fuffirient to adopt the mode of filtration recom- 
mended by Dr. Rotheram, or that which is propofed by M. Amy. 

Thefe obicrvr.tions arc not new, they have been communicated to 
the public by others. They are difperfcd through many different 
publications. 1 hrve th-n.f.>re thrown them into a fin all com) ali. 
And I ilp.tter myielf, that in a book cf Co' k"ry they may be accep- 
table to the public ; .is m.inyof the foregoing article? r.re of infinite 
importance to the health, and ccnfetjuently to the happintJV, of 
mankind.
