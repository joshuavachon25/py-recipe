PREFACE. 



The receipts in the " Every-day Cookery Book " are chiefly intended 
for persons of moderate income ; though amongst them will be found 
some few which are expensive and elaborate. 

The instructions in cookery are given in very full detail for the con- 
venience of inexperienced housekeepers and cooks. For the same 
reason the nearest possible approximation to the time required for 
cooking the various dishes has been given ; while the coloured plates 
will educate the eye of the cook, and enable her to judge how her 
preparations should look. 

That the book may answer the purpose for which it is intended is 
the earnest hope of the Editor.

THE 



EVERY-DAY COOKERY. 



THE MISTRESS OF A FAMILY. 



The mistress of a family commands daily a 
small realm of which she is queen. Let 
her rule with justice, meekness, and quiet- 
ness. The most self-governed person will 
always govern best, and we should have 
fewer bad servants if they were all under 
the firm and patient training of an employer 
who understood what their duties really 
were, and required the best fulfilment of 
them, compatible with the frailty of human 
nature. 

Good temper, patience, and a knowledge 
of domestic matters, come first therefore in 
the list of requirements for a model house- 
wife. 

After these, we shall name early rising, 
which is very important. 

A lady will find it best to give her servants 
orders for the day, before breakfast, if con- 
venient, and, to do this well, she must visit 
the larder herself early that she may judge 
of what is required. Her cook should have 
a book-slate and pencil, and enter the orders 
for dinner on one leaf of it, that there may 
be no mistakes made in them. On the 
other leaf she should be ordered to enter 
daily the amount of milk, bread, &c., 
bought on the previous day, which the 
mistress should then transfer to her common- 
place book, to be entered in the account- 
book at the end of the week. 

She should pay all her bills, if possible, 
every week. If some few remain to be paid 
quarterly, she should not on that account 
delay to examine them weekly, and to make 
up the week's accounts. She will then be 
sure of her expenditure. 

She must take care that the butcher always 
brings a ticket of weight with the meat ; 
and have those weight tickets brought to 
her weekly in order that she may compare 
them with the entries in her book. All 
meat brought into the house should be 
weighed to see if the ticket is correct, andj 



for this purpose a pair of scales should be 
kept in the kitchen ; groceries, &c., should 
also be tested as to weight on receipt of 
them. 

She should ascertain the price of every 
article of food in her neighbourhood ; as 
prices differ with localities, and that which 
might be economical food in one place is 
frequently the reverse in another. In order 
to learn the prices, she must not disdain to 
market for herself, if she is her own house- 
keeper. She will thus be able by personal 
obser\-ation to learn which are the best shops 
for different articles, and what are the fair 
rates of payment for them. It is also 
essential that a housekeeper should know 
the average weekly consumption for food of 
each person in an ordinary family, that she 
may be able to check waste and provide 
provisions for any period she may desire. 
For this purpose we subjoin a list of the 
usual allowances, which will of course vary 
very much from differing circumstances ; 
but it will give a general idea on the subject, 
which personal experience will modify : — 

Food for one Person "Weekly. 

Tea, two ounces. 

Coffee, a quarter of a pound (if for break- 
fast only). 

Cocoa paste, a quarter of a pound, for 
breakfasts. 

Sugar, half a pound. 

Cheese, half a pound. 

Butter, half a pound. 

Milk, one quart ; varying with the taste 
of the family. 

Bread, eight pounds for a woman, sixteen 
pounds for a man or boy. 

Meat, six pounds. 

Beer, one gallon for a woman, seven 
quarts for a man. 

Potatoes, three and a half pounds. 



Hints to Housekeepers, 



Of course this estimate of quantities must 
be modified greatly by the habits and tastes 
of tlie family, and by the fact of residence 
either in the town or country. 

A large supply of vegetables, fish, or 
puddings will greatly reduce the scale of 
meat ; and making tea and coffee for num- 
bers will reduce the amount of those articles. 
We merely give this general idea of quantity 
to guide, in a measure, the inexperienced 
housewife. We should have been thankful 
for sdch knowledge ourselves, us without it 



one invariably buys more than is actually 
needed for the consumption of the house- 
hold. 

With regard to meat, an allowance must 
be made for its waste in cooking (of which 
a table is given in this work), and also for 
the weight of bone found in every joint, ex- 
cept buttock of beef. 

Having advanced thus far in our know- 
ledge of housekeeping, the next step is how 
to cJioose mettt.

HOW TO MABKET. 



We advise our lady housekeepers to 
market for themselves ; but as some skill is 
required in a purchaser (if this duty is to be 
performed to advantage), we will endeavour 
to give directions by which inexperienced 
housewives may be enabled to choose good 
articles. 

First in the list comes butcher's meat : of 



which beef is considered the best by the 
generality of English people. An ox sliould 
be kept five or six years before it is killed ; 
it is then in its prime. Ox-bee/ is the best. 
It is a fine grained meat ; the lean of a 
bright red colour, inteiTningled with grains 
of fat, when it is well fed and good. 'I'lie 
fat should be white, not yellow, and the

suet also white and firm. Beef should never 
be lean ; it is tough and bad unless there is 
a good quantity of fat. Heifer-beef is paler 
than ox-beef, and closer grained ; the fat 
whiter, and the bones, of course, smaller. 
Bull-beef is only described to be avoided. 
It is dark-coloured and coarse-grained ; has 
very little fat, and a strong meaty smell 
about ii. 

Of these joints choose the rib or sirloin, 
for roasting. If you purchase ribs of beef, 
let them be the middle ribs. You may have 



one, two, three, or four ribs, as you will ; 
but one rib is too thin to be economical, as 
it dries up in cooking. If, however, your 
family be small, a single rib, with the bones 
taken out, rolled and stuffed, will make a 
nice little roast. If you buy a sirloin, take 
care to have it cut from the chump end, 
which has a good under cut or fillet, as 
then, in addition to a roast joint, you will 
have another dish — i.e., fillets-de-ba:uf, one 
©f the best dishes ever served. 
The rump is preferred to the sirloin by

epicures ; but it is too large to ser%'e whole. 
A sufficiently large joint is cut from the 
chump end to roast. 

For the servants' hall, or as a dinner for a 
large family where economy is essential, 
the buttock of beef is excellent, and very 
profitable. It is cheaper than the other 
roasting portions of the ox, has no bones, 
and affords quantities of rich gravy. But 
it should be hung for sometime until quite 
tender. The round, aitch-bone, and silver- 
side are usually salted and boiled. The 
neck is used for making soup or gravy — ask 
for it as " gravy beef ;" the thin flank is the 
part to be collared. A"rumpsteak" is to 
be ordered for frying, &c. A "beefsteak" 
does for stewing, puddings, pies, &c. The 
inferior and cheaper parts of beef make ex- 



cellent bouilli—z. dish for which you will 
find directions in the body of the book. 

Veal should be small and pink, and the 
kidney well covered with fat. The calf 
should not be older than eight or ten weeks 
when it is killed, or the flesh will be coarse. 
If veal is large it should be cheaper, as it is 
less delicate. The flesh should be dry, 
closely grained, and pinky ; if it is moist 
and clammy it is stale, and not fit for cook- 
ing. 

The fillet, loin, shoulder, and best end of 
the neck, are the roasting joints. The 
breast is sometimes roasted in very small 
families, but it is usually stewed, as is also 
the knuckle ; or the knuckle may be boiled, 
and served with parsley and butter. A 
calfs head is a delicacy. Calf's feet are

also valuable boiled, stewed, or used for 
jelly. Vea). makes the best stock for rich j 
soups and gravies. It is a most useful meat ! 
Tor made dishes of all kinds, on account of 
its delicate flavour. 

Mutton. — Wether mutton is the best. 
It may be known by its having aknolj of fat 
on the upper part of the leg'. It should be 
dark-coloured, and have plenty of fat. The 
colour is important, as it is a proof of age, 
and tlie older mutton is the better it is. It 
should, properly, be the flesh of a sheep 
four or five years old, to be in perfection, 
but such meat is rarely to be bought at 
a butcher's ; one tastes it only at the houses 



of country gentlemen who kill their o'.vn 
animals. 

All the joints of a sheep may be roasted. 
The saddle is the best. The haunch is next 
best to the saddle ; it is the leg and loin un- 
divided. The leg and neck are frequently 
boiled. The leg and loin, separated, are 
the best joints after the haunch. Chops are 
cut from the loin ; cutlets from the thick end 
of the loin, best end of the neck, or middle 
of the leg. The leg is sometimes cured and 
smoked as a ham. The brenst of mutton is 
often salted and boiled. Tiie scrag end of 
mutton is very good stewed with rice. 

L.MiB should be small ; of a pale-coloured

red, and fat. . Lamb is generally roasted. 
The leg of "house-lamb" (which is in 
season just before Christmas), is sometimes 
boiled and served with white sauce. 

Venison is not very often bought, but 
when it is you can tell as to its being ' ' high " 
or not, by running a skewer into the shoulder, 
and observing the scent on it when with- 
drawn. The fat should be thick and clean. 
If the cleft of the haunch is smooth and 
close, the animal is young. 

Pork. — Buy pork of a respectable 
butcher ; or get it from some place where 



you know it has been carefully fed ; from a 
dairy farm is the best place, or from a 
miller's, or even from some country neigh- 
bour, as diseased or bad pork is ver\' dan- 
gerous food. The fat of pork should be 
firm, and the lean white, and finely grained. 
The rind or skin thin and smooth. If the 
flesh feels clammy to the touch, the pork is 
bad. If the fat has kernels in it, the pig has 
been measly, and the meat should not be 
eaten. Pork should be perfectly sweet to be 
good, therefore do not hang it Ibng. 
Bacon. — If bacon is good the rind is

thin, the fat firm and pinkish, the lean 
tender and adhering to the bone. Rusty 
bacon has yellow streaks in it. 

Hams are tried by sticking a knife or 

skewer into them up to the knuckle ; if 

when drawn out it has a nice smell, the 

ham is good . A bad scent will be perceived 

•if it is tainted. 

The roasting joints of pork are the spare 
rib, loin, and leg ; the other joints are 
salted ; the leg may also be cured and 
boiled. The sides or flitches are made into 
bacon. The leg makes a ham. 

Meat should be wiped with a dry, clean 
cloth as soon as it comes from the butcher's ; 
flyblows should be cut out, and in loins, the 
long pipe that runs by the bone should be 
taken' out, as it soon taints ; the kernels 
also should be removed from beef. Never 
receive bruised \o\xi\.z. If you wish to keep 
your meat hanging longer than ordinary, 
dredge it well with pepper. Powdered 
charcoal dusted over it will also prevent its 
tainting, nay, will absolutely remove the 
taint from meat already gone. We have 
seen a pair of fowls quite green from un- 
avoidably long keeping, made fresh and 
sweet as ever by being sprinkled with pow- 
dered charcoal for an hour before dressing. 
In hot summers it is very advisable to keep 
a lump of charcoal in the larder. Meat 
becomes more digestible and tender by 
hanging, but lamb and veal cannot be kept 
so well as beef and mutton. Remember 
that the best, and therefore the dearest 
joints are the most economical in the end, 
because they contain more solid meat than 
the others ; but very large joints are not 
economical for a small family ; nor are they 
as wholesome as our old-fashioned English 
prejudices once deemed them . 

Poxtltry and Game, to Choose. 

Turkey. — The cock bird, when young, 
has a smooth black leg with a short spur. 
The eyes are bright and full, and the feet 
supple, when fresh ; the absence of these 
signs denotes age and staleness ; the hen 
may be judged by the same rules. 

Fowls. — The young cock has a smooth 
leg and a short spur ; when fresh, the vent 
is close and dark. Hens, when young, have 
smooth legs and combs ; when old, these 
will be rough ; a good capon has a thick 
belly and large rump, a poll comb, and a 
swelling breast. 

Geese. — In young geese the feet and 
bills will be yellow, and free from hair. 
When fresh, the feet are pliable ; they are 
stiff when stale. 

Ducks may be selected by the same rales. 

Pigeons, when fresh, have supple feet, 



and the vent will be firm ; if discoloured 
they are stale. 

Plovers, when fat, have hard vents ; but 
like almost all other birds, may be chosen 
by the abore rules. 

Hares. — When a hare is young and 
fresh, the cleft in the lip is narrow, the body 
stiff, and the claws are smooth and sharp ; 
old and stale hares will be the opposite of 
this. Rabbits the same. In order to ascer- 
tain whether a hare is young or old, turn 
the claws sideways ; if they crack it is 
young. The ears also should be tender and 
capable of bending easily. 

Partridges. — Yellow legs and a dark 
bill are signs by which a young bird may be 
known ; a rigid vent when fresh. When 
this part is green the bird is stale. 

Pheasants may be chosen as above ; 
the young birds are known by the short or 
round spur, which in the old is long and 
pointed. 

Moor Game. — Grouse, Woodcocks, 
Snipes, Quails, Ortolans, &c., may be 
chosen by the rules above given. 

Choose white legged fowls for boiling, 
and dark for roasting. 

To Choose Fish. 

The eyes of fish, if fresh, are bright, the 
gills of a fine clear red, the body stiff, and 
the smell not unpleasant. Chloride of soda 
will restore fish that is not extremely fresh, 
but it is never so good as when it Ikis not 
been kept. 

A turbot should be thick ; the under side 
of a pale yellowish white, the colour of rich 
cream. 

The salmon and the cod should have a 
small head, very thick shoulders, and a 
small tail. The flesh of the salmon should 
be of a bright red colour, the scales very 
bright. 

Do not buy herrings, mackerel, or whi- 
tings unless quite fresh, and do not attempt 
to keep them even till the next day. Cod 
may be kept twenty-four hours. Soles the 
same. 

Eels should be bought alive. Crabs and 
lobsters should be heavy and very stiff: if 
they feel limp they are stale. They are 
often bought alive. Oysters, if fresh, will 
close forcibly on the knife when opened. 
If the shell gapes in the least degree, the 
oyster is losing its freshness. Wlien the 
fish is dead the shell remains open. Small 
"natives" are the best oysters for eating ; 
for sauces or other culinary purposes the 
larger kinds are good enough. 

To Choose Eggs. 
Shake the eggs ; if they are bad they will

rattle. But we think the best plan is to put 
them in a basin of water, and see if they lie 
on their side, down in it. If the egg turns 
upon its end, it is bad ; if it lies obliquely, 
it is only not quite fresh, but may do for 
puddings, &c. 

M. Soyer tells us that the " safest way is 
to hold them up to the light, forming a 
focus with your hand ; should the shell be 
covered with small dark spots they are very 
doubtful." . . . "If, however, in looking 
at them you see no transparency in the 
shells, you may be sure they are rotten and 
only fit to be thrown away. The most pre- 
cise way is to look at them by the light of a 
candle ; if quite fresh there are no spots 
upon the shells, and they have a brilUant 
light yellow tint." 

Eggs to be preserved for use should be 
quite fresh from the nest. 

To Choose Vegetables. 

Take care that they are fresh-looking and 
crisp. 

Potatoes. — We think the best are the 
walnut-leaf kidney for summer and the 
regents for winter use. But tastes differ so 
much with regard to potatoes, that we can 
only advise buying them of the best and 
most respectable dealere. 

To Choose Apples. 

In choosing apples, be guided by the 
weight ; the heaviest are the best, and those 
should always be selected which, on being 
pressed by the thumb, yield to it with a 
slight crackli-ng noise. Prefer Large apples 
to small, for waste is saved in peehng and 
coring them. 

Apples should be kept on dry straw in a 
dry place, and pears hung up by the stalk. 

The Store-Koom. 

Every lady should have a small closet for 
her stores if she has not a regular store- 
room. Groceries should always be bought 
in quantities, if possible ; thus the turn of 
the scale and the weight of paper, &c., is 
saved. At certain sciisons of the year some 
articles may be bought cheaper than at 
others. Advantage should be taken of any 
fall in the market. 

A book should be kept in the store-room 
to enter the date when each store is bought, 
and at what price. 

The store-room should be very dry, and 
furnished with drawers, shelves, and nails, 
with a few little nets suspended from them 
for hanging lemons in. It should contain 
also earthenware jars for sugars, and tins for 
keeping tea, coffee, and biscuits. The large 
or small tins in which biscuits are sold 



should be retained for these uses. Jams, 
pickles, and preserves should be kept in the 
coolest part of the room or closet. Coffee 
should not be bought in large quantities, 
because it soon loses its flavour ; unless, in- 
deed, it is roasted at home, which is a very 
economical plan for large families. It can 
be bought very cheaply unroasted ; if pur- 
chased by the twenty-eight pounds it can be 
had at one shilling per pound ; and there 
is a roaster (peculiar to Ireland) which is 
turned over the fire like a mop, that any one 
can use with ease, to prepare it whenever 
required. 

Loaf sugar should be very white, close, 
heavy, and glittering ; it is economy to buy 
the best, as the more refined the sugar is, 
the less the quantity required for sweetening. 

Moist or brown sugar should have a 
crystalline, sparkling look, and should not 
be too powdery or sandlike. 

Tallow candles should be bought in large 
quantities, if possible ; and purchased in 
the winter, as they keep best when made in 
cold weather. They should be kept several 
months in a cool place before they are used. 
Soap should be bought by the hundred- 
weight for cheapness, and kept long before 
it is used. It should be cut in pieces fit for 
use, and then put in a drawer to dry and 
harden slowly, without being exposed to the 
air ; for if it were to dry quickly it would be 
likely to break when used. Mottled soap is 
the most economical ; the best yellow soap 
melts much more rapidly in water. Soft 
soap for washing linen is a saving of half 
the quantity ; therefore it is economical, 
though dearer in price than hard soap. 
Soda, by softening the water, saves soap. 

Starch should be left in a warm, dry 
place. Sugar, sweetmeats, and salt, must 
all be kept very dry. 

Rice, tapioca, sago, &c., sliould be kept 
close covered, or they will get insects in 
them ; it is better itcit to have large supplies 
of these articles. 

Buy lemons in June or July when they 
are freshly imported, and hang them in 
separate nets, for if they touch they will 
spoil. 

Onions, shallots, and garlic should be 
hung in ropes from a ceiling in an out-house 
[not in the store-room) ; and parsley, basil, 
savory, knotted marjoram, and thyme should 
be dried and hung up in paper bags, each 
bag containing only one description of herb. 
They should be dried in the wind, and not 
in the sun, and when ordered in a receipt 
should be cautiously used, as a prepon- 
derance of one flavour in any seasoning 
spoils it. 

^\■hen oranges or lemons are squeezed for

juice, chop down the peel, put it in small 
pots and tie it down for use. 

Vegetables will keep best on a stone floor, 
out of the air. 

Eggs may be preseired by brushing them 
all over the shell with a thin solution of gum 
and laying them in bran. Some persons 
brush them over with oil ; in fact, anything 
which will render the shell impervious to 
the air suffices for the purpose of preserving 
them. Some friends of the author wash 
them witli a solution of two quarts of quick- 
lime, half a pound of saltpetre, and an 
ounce of cream of tartar ; but this is 
troublesome, and not so good as a more 
simple plan. 

Suet may be kept for a twelvemonth, 
tlms : choose the firmest and most free from 
skin or veins, remove all trace of these, put 
the suet in a saucepan at some distance from 
the fire, and let it melt gradually ; when 
melted, pour it into a pan of cold spring 
water ; when hard, wipe it dry, fold it in 
white paper, put it into a linen bag, and 
keep it in a dry cool place ; when used it 
must be scraped ; it will make an excellent 
pie-crust, either with or without butter. 

The trouble of housekeeping is niuch 
diminished by having a fi.xed day for giving 
out to the cook the tea, sugar, coffee, 
plums, &c., which are likely to be required 
during the coming week ; weighing out the 
quantities in proportion to the number of 
the family. Every week she should account 
for these quantities, bringing back whatever 
may chance to remain over and above her 
use. 

The spice-box in the kitchen should be 
occasionally replenished from the store- 
room. 

Keeping Accounts. 

So many good Housekeeper's books are 
now published that much need not be said 
as to the mode of entry. But we think 
daily expenses are too minute in small 
families to be entered under all the various 
headings in most of the boolcs with printed 
lists. The housewife is advised to keep a 
tiny MS. book and pencil in her pocket, 
and enters/ the ;«(7;«^;;^ everything she buys 
or receives in the course of the day. This 
little record may be examined once a week, 
and its contents (so far as they relate to 
housekeeping) entered in the family account- 
book. I'he cook should produce her slate 
to check the lady's accounts, and the amount 
should be carefully added up. 

We prefer ourselves a plain-ruled account- 
book -without printed items. Then on one 
side, the left, we enter wliatevcr money we 
receive during the week ; on the opposite 



page the outlay we have made, which, when 
added up, can be subtracted at the bottom 
of the left page from the money received ; a 
weekly check is thus placed on the expendi- 
ture, which is continually compared with 
the means of payment. 

It is well to have a fixed sum for house- 
keeping, which may not be exceeded. If 
any amount may be left, it is a good reserve 
fund for extra expenses, or for charity. 

Ready reckoners * will be found of great 
use both to save time, and also to help those 
wlio are slow at figures. One of them 
should always be kept lying next to or on 
the housekeeper's book. 

Butcher's bills require careful weekly 
supervision, even when not paid till the 
quarter has elapsed, as errors in weight, 
even of ounces, or of price, as of farthings, f 
come to a considerable item in the course 
of the year. The memoranda of weight 
should be also compared with the book. 
One morning every week will suffice for 
these accounts, and, if faithfully carried 
out, the practice will be attended with a 
constant improvement in economy and good 
housekeeping. 

Do not allow dripping or bones to become 
a perquisite of the cook. Dripping is most 
useful in a moderate family. It is an excel- 
lent medium for frying ; it will make good 
family pie-crust, and supply the place of 
suet in a dumpling. Bones are absolutely 
necessary for making graxies and stock for 
soup. 

'lake care that butter is kept in a cool 
place and covered from the air. In summer 
get some saltpetre, dissolve it in cold water, 
and stand the butter crock in it, so that the 
saltpetre water may reach well up the sides. 
Cover it over with a wet cloth, the ends of 
which resting in the saltpetre water will 
keep it constantly moist. This is nearly as 
good as icing the butter. 

Milk should be kept in scrupulously clean 
vessels, and stale and fresh milk should 
never be mixed, or the goodwill be spoiled. 

Set apart from your income yearly a small 
sum to be invested in replacing worn house- 
hold linen, Buy occasionally a tablecloth, 
a pair of sheets, &c., &c. You will feel 
these purchases much less than having to 
supply a whole stock of linen at once. 

House linen should be looked over every 
six weeks or quarter, and carefully repaired. 
We like lavender-bags among the linen, to 
give it a fresh, agreeable smell ; but some 
persons assert that they bring moth. 

If you observe iron-moulds on the linen, 
speak at once to the laundress on the sub-

Ordering Dinner. 

\\1ien economy is to be considered, or- 
dering dinner requires some foresight and 
ingenuity in making one day tell into the 
next. Many very small families will have 
a large sirloin of beef on Sunday, say, and 
go on eating it cold and badly hashed day 
after day till it is gone. Now this need not 
be. VjoX tlie housewife choose the very 
same joint with a good undercut, and we 
will see how many different fresh dinners 
may be made from it in our bill of fare for 
a week. 

ist. Let the cook turn back the fat and 
cut out the undercut, as it is called, leaving 
a little fat on it, and replacing the upper fat 
so as not to disfigure the joint. Cut off the 
flap (which will enable you to carve the 
joint more easily), and put it in pickle. 
Now cut the under part vcXo fiUets-de-bxuf, 
dress them according to our recipe, and you 
will have a delicious dish, No. I. 

The joint roasted, No. 2. 

Cold, and a few slices of the least dressed 
parts cut up for beef olives. No. 3. 

The flap-end nicely salted, boiled with a 
garnish of carrots, &c., No. 4. 

But as we all object to dinners of "/<;?/- 
jours perdrix" we advise the housewife to 
alternate these dishes thus : — 

First dinner, Saturday — Fillets-de-bceuf, 
potatoes mashed in dish, also served fried 
in curled ribbons. 

Sunday. — Roast beef, Yorkshire pudding, 
boiled potatoes or Brussels sprouts. 

Monday — Roast loin of mutton, potatoes. 

Tuesday — Cold beef and beef olives, po- 
tatoes, salad, stewed fruit or pudding. 

Wednesday — Hashed mutton, or curry, 
vegetables. 

T'/Sar.yi/av— Rumpsteak, greens, potatoes. 

Friday — Soup, any remains of cold meat 
curried, (or a little veal cutlet to make up), 
vegetables, &c. 

Or if the inevitable leg of mutton be 
ordered (and it is unquestionably a good 
joint), it may be divided : the knuckle part 
boiled, the other end stewed with green 
peas ; but it does not roast well cut in 
halves, it is always spoilt as to flavour and 
Juiciness. 

We are writing now for those who are 
compelled to be economical. Therefore w« 
m.iy observe that the bones of the sirloin 
with a small addition of meat should be put 
into the stock-pot, and thus a nice soup 
may be obtained according to our recipes. 



And do not let the housewife (hampered by 
small means) be frightened at the name of 
a sauce. Some of the best and most 
appetizing are really not expensive, if care- 
fully made, and they will often suffice to 
turn a ' ' scrap dinner" into quite a recherchi 
little repast. 

Ingenuity, care, and taste will do much 
to remedy the want of means. But if the 
wife has not a first-rate cook, let her try to 
dress any especial dish herself. Cultivated 
intellect will help her much more than she 
would suppose in mastering difficulties 
never overcome by an ordinary servant. It 
is said that cooks, as well as poets, mustbe 
to the manner born ; but we think the in- 
spiration of affection may supply the birth- 
right of talent, and the desire to add to 
home-happiness be strong enough to help 
the imsteady and unpractised hand. " Where 
there is a will there is a way." 

If means are abundant, there is no sort of 
excuse for an ill-kept table ; then the wife 
(still studying the matter) may fearlessly 
exert her taste and vary the home fare with 
equal delicacy and address. She may have 
her " fillets-de-bxuf" still, for they are "a 
dainty dish to set before the queen," but 
she may retain the rolled flap on the joint, 
and eat boiled beef in its best form, the 
round or silver-side. She may vary meat 
with poultry, add game to her second 
course, and should never be without good 
soup. Still there should be no waste ; 
economy should be practised for the sake of 
the poor, v.ho should be in every rich wife's 
thoughts. 

We will give a nice and economical bill 
of fare here for a wec^k, for six or eight per- 
sons, for the wife who can command a 
liberal sum for her table : — 

Summer. 

Sunday — Julienne soup, a sirloin of beef, 
half a calf's head, greens, potatoes, and 
cauhflower ; pudding, either balced tapioca, 
gooseberry pudding, or ramekins. 

Monday — Middle slice of salmon, cold 
beef, hashed calf's head, asparagus, pota- 
toes, salad ; pudding, apple or cold tapioca. 

T'wwifoj'— Salmon pudding, or boudin de 
saumon (from the remains of day before) 
leg of lamb, green peas, potatoes ; /wa'^/w^t 
boiled custards, or fruit tart (say currant 
and raspberry). 

Wednesday. — Green pea soup, boiled 
chicken, cold lamb ; potatoes, salad ; pud- 
ding, Brazenose College pudding, or open 
jam tart (apricot). 

Thursday. — Soles, fillet of veal, or bacon, 
asparagus, potatoes ; pudding, queen Mab's, 
or German pudding. 



12 



Ordering Dinner. 



Friday. — Small turbot, rolled loin of mut- 
ton, minced veal, potatoes, early carrots ; 
pudding, slices of German pudding fried, or 
black currant pudding. 

Saturday. — Curried turbot. rolled mut- 
ton (cold), roast duck,* green peas, pota- 
toes ; pudding, cherry tart, boiled or baked 
custard. 

This bill of fare may be varied weekly a 
multitude of ways, and let the house-wife 
remember that variety has an especial charm 
for the appetite. 

To the wife who has to provide on very 
slender means we will now resume address- 
ing ourselves. 

Take care that your table-linen is spot- 
lessly pure and white, the cloth well pressed, 
and that you have table napkins and finger 
glasses for dessert. These little elegancies 
cost next to nothing, and add immensely to 
the air of comfort and refinement which your 
table should possess. In summer, manage, 
if possible, to have a centre ornament of 
flowers, if only a cheap vase. In winter, 
the lamp will supply its place. Let the plate 
be well cleaned, the glasses very clear — in 
short, exquisite cleanliness, and everything 
which can charm the eye, will help you to 
make a poorer dinner more welcome than a 
sumptuous one would be with these delica- 
cies omitted. You will find the style of 
your table one of those unconscious home- 
influences which will form the taste and tone 
of your children's minds, and greatly act on 
their manner. If you have not a very good 
cook, study the art a little yourself. Prac- 
tise on one dish rather more frequently than 
on others, till you can do it to perfection. 

A well-dressed mutton chop, an inexpen- 
sive yet appetizing pudding, will be a good 
dinner in themselves. Whatever you have, 
let it be well-dressed, and you have the 
essential principle of a first-rate dinner. 

Dinner parties in the present day are 
rendered much less expensive affairs than 
they used to be, by the fashion of serving 
them in the Russian style. But this mode 
requires a sufficient number of servants for 
waiters, and a good carver ; also the table 
should be elegantly ornamented with fruit, 
flowers, &c. No one should attempt to give 
such dinners, who has not means to render 
them perfect. In fact, large formal dinner 
parties should not be given at all unless the 
host and hostess have good means. Even- 
ing parties are all that should be expected 
from people who are not rich, and they will 

_ * Ducks are a second course dish at first-rate 
diuiiers. 



be, in many instances, much better liked by 
the guests. 

At the same time we would not suggest 
anything like inhospitality. A few friends 
— really friends — may meet round the home 
table with probably twice the pleasure of 
the regular diners-out ; and the house-wife 
should take care that these gatherings are 
made pleasant and easy by her previous 
care. She should not attempt anything 
beyond her means, nor try any dishes which 
she is not sure of making successfully. If 
she is careful (as she ought to be) to make 
her parlour- maid wait properly, and lay the 
table nicely, every day, she will be sure of 
her performance of the daily routine cor- 
rectly, and the guests will be spared the 
anxious glances, divided attention, frowns, 
and signals of the hostess at the head of the 
table momentarily expecting catastrophes, 
and looking wretched, like a skeleton at an 
Egyptian feast. Let us advise her to have 
an ordinary but very good soup, very hot ; 
well-dressed fish ; few made dishes — two 
will be enough, handed round before the top 
and bottom dish are uncovered, and let them 
be very nicely made or not made at all. The 
joint and poultry should be plain but well 
dressed ; plates hot ; salt, water, and bread, 
within reach of each guest. The tiny six- 
penny glass salt-cellars sold now are very 
useful ; one is placed between every two 
persons. A water caraffe covered with its 
glass should stand close by the plates of 
two guests, i. e., one at each comer of the 
table, and one in the middle of each side 
will be essential. We are speaking only 
of a small friendly dinner, but these are 
essential comforts, and save waiting if they 
are ready at hand. 

Any lady may venture to give a little 
dinner party in a modified Russian style, i.e., 
put an epergne of flowers in the middle of 
the table ; arrange on each side of it a semi- 
circle of dishes of fruits and sweetmeats, 
every two fruit dishes, divided by small glass 
plates, containing on one side preserved 
ginger, on the other, damson cheese, or any 
other sweetmeat. At the top and bottom of 
the table, soup and fish. When they are 
removed, the joints and poultry. The two 
side dishes on the sideboard are handed 
before the removes are uncovered. This 
will save the delay of spreading the dessert 
after the dinner is over. The cloth may be 
swiftly brushed, the fruit dishes drawn for- 
ward, and two centre ones placed on the 
table. In this form you will require fewer, 
?. «.,only two entrees or side dishes, and 
time will also be saved— a great object when 
there is only a single waiter. 

The regular dinner rf la Russe is served

thus : — Either a silver or glass plateau runs 
down the centre of the table, or a handsome 
centre-piece of plate is placed in the middle 
of it, such as a silver tree, with figiires or 
animals at the foot of it ; or a raised centre 
dessert dish, containing fruit, flowers, &c. &c. 
(^See engravings of Desserts towards the end 
of the volume.) Round this centre are small 
glass dishes of preser\'es ; outside, alternate 
dishes of fruit, and vases of flowers with 
occasional bottles of sherry, and caraffes of 
water with their several tumblers on them, 
a finger glass holding a wine glass to each 
plate. In short, the table is made to look 
as handsome as possible with glass, plate, 
&c. &c. In each plate is a "carte" of the 
dinner. 

The dishes are brought in and placed on 
the sideboard or on a side table. The soup 



is handed round, then the fish ; then the 
side dishes or entrees. Next the removes, 
as turkey, roast saddle of mutton, &c. &c., 
ready carved, of course, and on the plate. 
Then comes the second course, i.e., game, 
or duck, or artichokes, puddings, jelly, 
cream, tarts, &c. ; next, cheese, maccaroni, 
celeiy, &c. 

The butler goes round with the wine as 
usual — sherry. Champagne, hock, &c. &c. — 
between the courses. 

Then the servants place the dessert plates, 
&c., and retire. 

A much less number of dishes is required 
for this style of dinner, tlian were needed 
when it was usual to place them on the table. 
Dinner is more rapidly served ; and each 
dish is handed hot, and at the moment i 
should be eaten.

KITCHEN UTENSILS. 



Tlie young and inexperienced housekeeper 
will, we believe, be glad of some guidance 
in the selection of the utensils needed in her 
kitchen, so that she may not be at the mercy 
of those who desire more than is really re- 
quired, or who are ignorant of the necessity 
and use of many articles of the first import- 
ance in the art. With a view to helping our 
readers to decide in this matter for them- 
selves, we offer them here three lists of the 
articles absolutely essential in the kitchen. 
The first list is for a first-rate kitchen, the 
second for a medium one, the third for the 
cottage home. Of course any one of the 
three lists may be added to, as required ; 
but they will be a guide in the matter as 
they now stand. 

Modern science has greatly aided the cook 
in the implements of her art, and in order to 
be able to recommend the newest and best 
cookingutensils we havesolicited and received 
the aid of some of the first manufacturing 
and furnishing ironmongers in London. 

The more expensive list will seldom be 
required by persons of moderate income, but 
they may select from it with profit some one 
or two articles, such as the Bain Marie pan, 
Saut^ pan, &c., which will add immensely 
to the cook's resources, and enable her to 
keep her dinner hot, or perform certain deli- 



cate culinary performances much more cer- 
tainly than she could wthout them. 

We believe that the subject is worthy of the 
housekeeper's attention, as, though some 
cooks are so ingenious and fertile in expe- 
dients that they will make few utensils suffice, 
still there are others who would well fulfil 
the duties of their position if supplied with 
all the mechanical aids they have a right td 
expect, but who fail utterly without them; 
and it is surely unfair to expect a cook 16 
prepare a good dinner without allowing her 
the needful implements. 

Some of the recent inventions, as Carson's 
Patent Salting Apparatus, Kent's Patent 
Soup Strainer, and the Patent Mincing Ma- 
chine, will be found to afford an immense 
saving of labour and time ; while the worst 
cook amongst "general servants" can 
scarcely achieve the feat of spoiUng the joint, 
if it be cooked in Captain Warren's Every- 
body's Pot, 

We have not given an engraving of every 
separate article named in the lists ; som6 
few are too well known to require illustration^ 
AH that are new or least known in ordinary kit- 
chens have been presented to the eye pic- 
torially as well as.verbally, and will, we hope, 
suffice for the full information of the inex- 
perienced housekeeper.

to keep them always clean and fresh. The I should never put one away dirty.

jams, jellies, marmalades, &c. keeping sauces and entries hot, &c. 



Stock-pot.' 



Braising Pan. — ^The food to be braised 
is put into the lower part of the pan. The lid 
is covered well with red-hot ashes or charcoal. 
Full directions for braising are given farther 
on. The stewpan is a valuable utensil ; it 
will in case of need serve as a braising-pan, 
if the lid be made to go a litde into the edge 
of the pan as some are made. 



Stock Pot. — ^Tlie stock pot receives in it 
bones, trimmings of meat, remains of cold 
game, &c., &c., in short everj'thing available 
for ordinary or good soup. It is to be wished 
that every English artizan's wife possessed 
one ; it is the pot-au-fcu of the French work- 
man, who thus obtains nourishing soup and 
well-dressed meat at the same time. 




Saucepan Digester. 



Digester, 



Slack's Patent "Digester" cannot be too 
learmly recommended to those who have 
need to practise economy. The mode of 
using it is simple and easy. Care must be 
taken in filling a digester to leave room 
enough for the steam to pass off through the 
valve at the top of the cover. This may be 
done by filling the digester only three parts 
full of water and bruised bones or meat, 
which it is to be noticed are all to be put in 
together. It must then be placed near a 
slow fire, so as only to simmer (more heat 
injures the quality), and this it must do for 
the space of eight or ten hours. After this 
has .been done, the soup is to be strained 



Stewpan Digester. 

through a hair sieve or colander, in order to 
separate any bits of bones. The soup is 
then to be put into the digester again, and 
afterwards whatever vegetables, spices, &c. , 
are thought necessary are added, the whole 
is to be well boiled together for an hour or 
two, and it will be then fit for immediate 
use. In putting on the lid ot the digester, 
take care that a mark, thus (X) on the lid,

Captain Warren's Eveiytcdy's Cccking Pot. 

This new 




and admirable 
utensil we have tested our- 
selves, and can warmly re- 
commend to the liouseUeeper. 
Meat is cooked in it by means 
of heat only, without being 
touched by any liquid, save its 
own juicfs, or even wetted by 
steam. The joint is put, with- 
out water, into the inner sauce- 
pan, B. This is put over the 
lower saucepan. A, which is 
filled with boiling water, the 
steam from which ascends 
round the sides of the inner 
pot and passes into the lid, 
which is also thus filled with 
steam. The meat remains 
cooking in its own juices 
alone for the period named ijl 
the following table :

Another and upper portion of the cooking 
pot will at the same time dress vegetables, 
&c., over the meat. They have, of course, 
to be put in seme time after the joint. The 
meat, thus dressed, is taken out (in spite of 
nn inferior cook) succulent, and scarcely at 
all reduced in weight ; as it wastes two 
ounces less in dressing tlian liy the ordinary 
.•system of boiling. The flavour is much 
better than when the meat is boiled, as it 
cannot, t)f couisc, absorb any water. For 
sick cookery this pot is admirable, as over- 
boiling, scorching, or smoking, are impos- 
sible ; and the meat is very digestible and

Scales. — As one of the great elements of success in

the cook should never be witliout a good pair of scales,

Gas Cooking. 

Gas cooking finds favour in many kitchens on account 
of the great economy of fuel obtained by it. In small 
kitchens, in the heat of sununer, the stove here repre- 
sented will (in cases of early dinner) allow the cook or 
general ser%'ant to let her fire go out and enjoy a cool 
apartment. The stove should be placed, if possible, in 
the back kitchen or scullery.

When wood is used these may be removed. 

To improve the Draught, if necessary. — 
Carry the flue-pipe a few feet up the chim- 
ney, or enclose the fireplace with an iron 
plate, in which cut out a round hole for the 
pipe to pass tlu-ough. 

To nsc the Stove in the open air, it will be 
necessary to have about ten feet of perpen- 
dicular pipe, to ensure a proper draught. 

Economy in the use of fuel is not to be 



neglected by the housekeeper. Cinders 
should be carefully sifted. The grate (if the 
ordinary one alone be possessed) should be 
screwed in as soon as the fire for cooking is 
no longer required. The fire at the back of 
the open range may then be made of small 
coals, wetted and left to cake. Cinders may 
be used for ironing stoves, and for heating 
ovens. 

The Cottager's Stove will be found an 
economical assistant to the common opea 
range in small kitchens. 



Soyer's Patent Culinary Utensils. 



It would be unjust to the memory of a 
great cook if we omitted from our list the 
culinary utensils invented by the late M. 
Soyer, to whom our gratitude as a nation is 



due. They consist of the B.aking Stew- 
ing Pan, the Improved Baking Dish, the 
Vegetable Drainer, and the Portfolio Me?' 
Screen. 





'iPiiiiiiiiiwM 




Baking Stewing Pan. — By this pan all 
the nutriment and flavour of the various in- 
gredients are preserved. It has great ad- 
vantages over the old method of boiling or 
stewing — namely, that it gives hardly any 
trouble ; and, in addition to its retaining all 
the nutriment, it cooks in one-third less time 
than by the ordinary mode. 

Improved Baking Dish. — The late M. 
Soyer thus described this invention in the 
"Shilling Cookery for the People"; "I 
have attached a moveable false grating of 
v/ire, to the middle of which is fixed a trivet, 
three inches in height. I put the pudding 



at the bottom of the dish, then put in the 
grating, on which I place the potatoes ; then 
on the trivet I put the meat. By this means 
the surplus fat, which would otherwise fall 
in the pudding and prevent its setting, 'de- 
scends on the potatoes, making them deli- 
cate and crisp. This is applicable to any 
joint, and the meat ijeing more elevated than 
usual when placed in the oven, causes it to 
partake more of the flavour of a roast joint 
than it does when put immediately over the 
pudding or potatoes; the vapourarising from 
which soddens the meat, instead of leaving 
it brown and well carbonized,

This new range is made from three feet to 
five feet wide ; it has a wrought-iron roaster

double dripping-pan and meat-stand, tho- 
roughly ventilated by means of air-tubes and 
Valves (by closing which the roaster becomes 
an excellent oven). Strong wrought-iron

Tlie top consists of a hot plate, on which 
boiling, stewing, kc, maybe done without 
injuring and soiling the vessels in use, and 
which may also be used as an ironing stove. 

The advantages offered by this stove are 
that it requires no brickwork to fix it ; it 
roasts, bakes, boils, and steams with one fire. 



and supplies a bath if required ; it carries off 
the heat and smell of the kitchen ; and it 
can be fixed in its place in a few hours, after 
the fireplace is cleared out and prepared for 
it, by local workmen if preferred. It can be 
removed, in the event of a change of resi- 
dence, being quite detached and indepen- 
dent. It is not more expensive than the 
ordTnary kitcheners ; whilst the cost of faxing 
it is much less. 

Plain Directions for Roasting, && 

Ho%o to Roast. — Roasting meat, though 
one of the commonest modes of dressing it, 
is by no means an easy task. Roast m.eat is 
too often sent to table nearly raw, or dried 
up till there is scarcely any gravy in it. 
Now good roasting consists in dressing the 



30 



How to Boil. 



joint thoroughly, and yet retaining its juices 
in it. 

The cook should prepare her fire some 
little time before she puts the meat down. 
The grate should be let out sufficiently wide 
to take in the whole size of the joint, with a 
margin to spare on each side, and the fire 
should be so good as not to require making 
up during t!ie time the joint is roasting. It 
should be sufficiently large to be of an equal 
strength all the time the meat is dressing, 
aided by a large coal put on the top of i t 
occasionally. A great deal of the success in 
rsasting will depend on the heat and good- 
ness of the fire. > 

Begin roasting by placing the meat at 
some distance from the fire (about twelve 
inches), and baste it from the first. When 
it is half done, move it gradually nearer to 
the fire for it to be well browned. If the 
meat were to be put close to the fire at first, 
it wouW diy up, and the outside would be 
dressed before the heat had penetrated the 
mass ; the juices being thus shut in, the joint 
would be under-dressed. Some persons pre- 
fer meat roasted vay slowly. That method 
is expensive, because it requires a large fire 
to be kept up for a length of time ; and also, 
unless done by a cook who understands her 
business well, and who makes a fire fit for it, 
the meat is apt to get sodden. We need 
scarcely say that the meat screen should be 
placed behind it from the first of its being 
put down. 

Cover the fat of veal or lamb with a piece 
of paper tied on with twine. 

Baste the meat very frequently, for the 
more it is basted the better it will eat. When 
it is nearly done, the paper over the fat may 
be removed, and the joint lightly dredged 
with flour, in order to give it a savoury brown 
appearance called frothing. Sprinkle a very 
httle salt on it also, but not till it is just 
ready to dish up, as salt draws out the 
^ravy. 

The usual time allowed for roasting is a 
quarter of an hour or twenty minutes for 
each pound of meat. But this rule does not 
always answer. Meat fresh killed takes 
ranger to roast than when it has been kept 
long ; and in warm weather it takes less time 
than in cold. Brown meats require less time 
than white meats do. In frosty weather it 
is better to kiy the joint before the fire to 
thaw before it is put on thespit, as, if frozen, 
it will be impossible to calculate the time 
required for dressing it, and in fact it will 
never be dressed through. The cook should 
always be careful that the spit, and also the 
hook used in the bottle-jack, be wiped before 
they are used. Slie should also be careful 
how she hangs the meat, so as to avoid dis- 



figuring it by running the spit through the 
prime parts. 

Cradle spits are much the best for large 
kitchens ; for small families, the bottle-jack 
in a tinned screen does very well, or, better 
still, the improved spring-jack and roaster. 

Let the butcher chop the joints of necks 
and loins of mutton and lamb before they 
are dressed, or they cannot be well sepa- 
rated by the carver when they are sent ts 
table. 

When the roast meat has been taken up, 
the fat which has dripped from it into the 
pan should be poured into a basin, previ- 
ously dipped in cold water. It must be left 
till the next day, when beneath the fat at the 
top will be found a fine meat jelly fit for 
gravies, &c. The cake of dripping should 
be melted and strained into cold water, from 
which it can be removed in cakes for future 
use. 

Veal, pork, and lamb should be tho- 
roughly done, not retaining any red gravy ; 
at the same time, care should be taken not 
to dry them up, or roast them till the flesh 
parts from the bones. ■ 

Mutton does not take quite the length of 
time to roast that beef does. 

A very economical way of making gravy 
is to skim the fat from the dripping in the 
pan under the meat, and pour two or three 
spoonfuls of hot water into it ; stir it, and 
pour it over the meat through a sieve. 

' How to Boil. 

Joints to be boiled should be washed ex- 
tremely clean and skewered into good shape, 
then they should be put in the saucepan and 
covered well with cold water. They must be 
set over a moderate fire and let boil slowly. 
Just before the water reaches boiling point 
the scum will rise to the top, and must be 
carefully skimmed off; if not done at the 
moment of ebullition it will fall back on the 
joint boiling and disfigure it. The pot will 
require skimming every time the scum rises. . 
The saucepan must be kept covered all the 
time, however, the lid being only removed 
for the cook to skim the pot. 

Gentle simmering, not fast boiling, is most 
desirable for meat, as by quick boiling the 
outside is hardened before the joint is done, 
and the meat becomes hard and tough, 
from the chemical reasons already given. 

Salted meat requires longer boiling than 
fresh meat ; when smoked and dried it takes 
longer still. Pickled or salted meat should 
be soaked before boiling in cold water, for a 
longer or shorter time as its saltness and size 
may require. Take care that the joint, if 
large, does not adhere to the bottom of the 
pot. To prevent this possibility cooks some*

31 



times put a few wooden skewers at the bot- 
tom under it. 

The time allowed for boiling is from a 
quarter of an hour to twenty minutes for 
each pound, supposing of course that the 
fire is kept up to an equal temperature all the 
time. Quick boiling is very much, to be 
avoided, but the pot should never be allowed 
to stop simmering. 

First-rate cooks preserve the whiteness of 
their boiled meats, and save them from in- 
sipidity, by not boiling them in water, but 
using instead a sort of broth called /i?^/^, or 
another called blanc. But these prepara- 
tions are very expensive, and are not re- 
quired for ordinary use ; however, we give 
them amongst the sauces in case they should 
be needed. For people who cannot afford 
expensive cooking, a well floured cloth 
wrapped round the meat to be boiled will 
make it white ; but the cloth must be kept 
very clean, and should be boiled in pure 
water after each time it is used ; moreover, 
it must not be suffered to get damp, or it 
will give a musty flavour to the meat. 

How to Broil. 
Many kinds of fish, steaks, chops, and 
cutlets are far better broiled than fried ; but 
much care, niceness, and skill are required 
to broil properly. First, the fire should be 
perfectly free from smoke, though brisk, and 
giving out a good heat ; secondly, the grid- 
iron should be scrupulously clean, well 
heated, and rubbed over with mutton suet 
before the meat is put on it. If the fire be 
too fierce, the meat will be hardened and 
scorched ; if it be too dead, the gravy will 
escape and the meat will be flabby. The 
gridiron should be held slopingly over the 
fire in order that the fat may run off to the 
back of the grate, for if it dropped on the 
coals it would create a blaze, and blacken 
and smoke the meat. If by chance a blaze 
should spring up during the time the steak, 
&c., is broiling, the gridiron must be caught 
off the fire and held on one side till the blaze 
i*gone ; a Uttle salt thrown on the fire will 
make it clear again. Fish should be wrapped 
in a piece of well-buttered letter-paper before 
they are placed on the gridiron, to keep 
them from smoke, and prevent their becom- 
ing too dry ; the 'gridiron may be rubbed 
with a little chalk first. Cutlets which are 
covered with z%g and bread-crumbs, must 
be dipped in a little clarified butter before 
they are put on the gridiron. The best way 
however, is to season the cutlet with pepper, 
and brush it over with a little butter before 
it is broiled. Steaks and chops should be 
turned often in order that they may be done 
in every part, but the fork used for this pur- 



pose should never be stuck into the lean of 
the steak, as it would let the gravy escape ; 
it must be put into the outer skin or fat. 
All kitchens ought to be provided with steak- 
tongs for this purpose. 

Birds when cut asunder and broiled, must 
be laid with the inside first to the fire. 

Most people prefer broiled mutton chops 
or beefsteaks rather lightly dressed, but 
lamb and pork chops should be thoroughly 
•cooked. Everything broiled should be served 
the moment it is done, very hot. The dish 
shotild be kept ready to receive it in front of 
the Are. 

When fish are broiled without paper, great 
care should be taken to have the gridiron 
very hot before they are put on it, and to 
rub the bars with grease. To preserve the 
skin of the fish entire when broiled, it should 
(after being washed and cleansed) be rubbed 
well with vinegar, dried in a cloth, and 
floured. The flour will keep it from adher- 
ing to the bars. A cinder or charcoal fire is 
best for broiling fish. While you are broil- 
ing slices of cold meat, put into a hot dish a 
piece of butter the size of a walnut and a 
teaspoonful of ketchup — melt them together, 
and lay the meat from the gridiron on the 
gravy made by these ingredients, as soon as 
it is done. 

How to Stew. 

Stewing is a wholesome, e.Kcellent, and 
economical mode of cooking. Very little 
fuel -is used for it, and meat so prepared 
is both digestible and delicious. B\xt boiling 
is not stewing, and we warn our readers that 
all we have said in praise of it may be re- 
versed if they let the stew-pan do more 
than simmer very gently. Stewing is best 
done over a regular stove ; but when a cook 
can command only an old-fashioned kitchen 
range she must place her stew- pan on a trivet 
high above the fire, and constantly watch it, 
and move it nearer to, or further from the 
fire. Stewing must of course always be done 
over a slow fire, and the stew-pan lid should 
shut quite closely. It should be kept at a 
gentle simmer, without letting it boil, and it 
must stew for several hours, according to 
the weight of the meat, which is not con- 
sidered done until it is quite tender. Some- 
times the cook stews the meat in a jar, placed 
in a stew-pan full of water, and thus extracts 
the pure gravy unmixed with water. We 
have also a recipe for stewing meat and 
vegetables together, without water being put 
in the jar with them, thus making an excel- 
lent soup from the union of the pieces of 
the meat and the water contained in tho 
vegetables.

How to Fry. — Gtasing — Boning. 



How to Fry. 

Cooks should always have two frying-pans, 
and a third, not much bigger than a large 
plate, for omelets, fritters, &c., if they have 
no sautd-pan. The pan must be kept deli- 
cately clean and nice ; the butter, dripping, 
lard, oroil in which the fish, meat, &c., is fried 
must always be boiling Ao/ before the meat is 
put into the pan. I'he rule is that a suffi- 
cient quantity of fat must be heated thus in 
the pan to cover the steak, chop, or what- 
ever is to be fried — frying being actually 
boiling in fat instead of water. Mutton 
chops do not require any fat in the pan with 
them : they have enough in themselves, but 
they must be often turned and moved about 
to prevent them from burning. Of course 
we speak only of chops cooked quite plain, 
i.e., without beingegged and bread-crumbed. 
Cut and skin the chop nicely, and season it 
with a little pepper before putting it in the 
pan. : 

Lamb cutlets, and lamb chops, must be 
egged and bread-crumbed twice, in order 
to look well. 

Steaks should be cut three quarters of an 
inch thick for frying, and should be pep- 
pered, but not have salt put on them before 
they are dressed, as it makes them hard. 
When done, a little salt is sprinkled lightly 
over them. 

Cutlets, i la maintenon, and mullet are 
fried in buttered paper covers. ■■-'. 

The first process in frying is to put enough 
dripping or butter in your pan, to cover the 
chop or steak when the butter is melted. 
Then the fat must be made to hoil in the 
pan, and when at its greatest heat the sub- 
stance to be fried must be plunged into it. 
The pan must then be lifted from the fire 
for a minute or two, to prevent the outside 
from getting black before the inside is 
dressed. 

Fish must be well dried before frying, 
in a cloth well sprinkled with flour ; or first 
they may be wiped well, thoroughly dried 
and dredged with flour. Then an egg is 
well bnished over them, and finely-grated 
bread, or biscuit, is sprinkled over them. 
The fat should be quite at boiling-point 
(when it will no longer hiss or bubble) be- 
fore the fish is put in, and it should be well 
covered by the liquid butter, or oil, the 
latter is much the best for frying fish 
in, but of course it is expensive. Hog's 
lard and dripping are also used in economi- 
cal kitchens. The frying-pan should never 
be left for a moment till the fish is done. 

In kitchens where strict economy is de- 
manded, it is usual when liver and bacon 
are to dressed to fry the bacon first, which 
will leave onou^h fat in the pan for the 



liver to be put in without either butter or 
dripping, but this mode, though economi- 
cal, is very coarse, and we do not recom- 
mend it. The liver will be more delicate if 
it be fried before the bacon. 

To Gla^e. 

Glazing is done by boiling down good 
rich beef stock till it is reduced to the con- 
sistence of a thin, bright brown paste. Of 
course, all fat and sediment must first be 
removed from the stock before it is boiled 
down for glaze. It should be done over a 
quick fire, boiled fast till well reduced, then 
changed into a smaller stew-pan, and 
should continue boiling till it is made. It 
must be kept in a jar well covered, and 
when required for use should be put into a 
stew-]ian and let stand in boiling water till 
the jelly is melted. It must be brushed over 
the tongue, chicken, or beef with a glazing 
brush once or twice till the operation is 
finished. 

Boning, Larding, and Braising. 

The three most difficult operations to 
achieve well in cookery are boning, larding, 
and braising. Boning is so little under- 
stood by inferior cooks that it is best, if 
your servant is not first-rate, to have it done 
by the poulterer with whom you deal. 
Nevertheless, it is an art which tends so 
much to economy, that it would quite repay 
the mistress of a family to pay for a few 
lessons for her domestic from a good poul- 
terer or cook. The bones of poultry and 
hares are most useful for making gravies, 
and hares are more easily carved, and look 
better when boned. Any butcher will bone 
joints when required. Although we cannot 
hope that our readers will be able to achieve 
the boning of a fowl, &c., from any verbal 
discription, we, nevertheless, give a few di- 
rections on the subject, from an excellent 
recipe of Miss Acton's for the performance 
of the operation. Turkeys, fowls, hares, 
&c., are boned, as well as joints. 

To bono a Tiukey or Fowl.— Miss Acton's. 
"Cut through the skin down the centre 
of the back, and raise the flesh carefully on 
either side with the point of a sharp knife 
until the sockets of the wings and thighs 
are reached. Till a Uttle practice has beea 
gained, it will, perhaps, be better to bone 
these joints before proceeding further ; but 
after they are once detached from it, the 
whole of the body may easily be separated 
from the flesh, and taken out entire. Only 
the neckbones and merrythought will then 
remain to be removed. The bird thus pre*

pared may either be restored to its original 
form, by filling the legs and wings with 
forcemeat, and tlie body with the livers of 
two or three fowls, mixed with alternate 
layers of parboiled tongue, freed from the 
riud, fine sausage meat, or veal forcemeat, 
or thin slices of the nicest bacon, or aught 
else of good flavour, wjiich will give a mar- 
bled appearance to the fowl when it is 
carved, and then be sewn up and trussed as 
usual ; or the legs and wings may be drawn 
inside the body, and the bird being first 
flattened on a table, may be covered with 
sausage meat and the various other ingre- 
dients we have named, so placed that it 
shall be of equal thickness in every part, 
then tightly rolled, bound firmly together 
with a fillet of broad tape, wrapped in a 
thin pudding cloth closely tied at both 
ends, and dressed.".. 

Larding. 

The cook should be provided with lard- 
ing needles of various sizes. 

Cut small smooth strips of the length re- 
quired, off the firmest part of a piece of 
bacon fat. Put these bits of bacon fat into 
a larding needle (see page 23), they are 
called lardoons. Pierce the skin and a very 
little of the flesh of the meat, fowl, sweet- 
bread, &c. , you may wish to lard with it, 1 
leaving the bacon in, and the two ends of | 
equal length outwards. These punctures ; 
fov lardoons are made in rows at any dis- 1 
tance from each other the cook pleases. | 
Tlie flavour of larding may be obtained by j 
raising the skin of the meat, and laying a j 
slice of fat bacon beneath it ; this mode is 1 
not ornamental, but gives an excellent fla- 1 
vour to the flesh, even better than when j 
larded with the needles. It requires a little ; 
practice to lard neatly, but as it is really an I 
easy operation, any cook may learn to do it ! 
with care. Cut the bacon in slices, lay them 
one on the other, and cut strips through 1 
them the size you require, in order that they ] 
may be all of the same size. i 

Lardoons (;is these pieces of bacon are j 
called) should be two inches in length, and ; 
one-eighth of an inch in width, for larding 
[poultry, game, and fricandeaux ; for fillets 
of beef and loin of veal they should be 
rather thicker. We owe, besides many an- 
other invaluable lesson, the following ad- 
mirable description of larding to Soyer : — 
' ' Have the fricandeau trimmed ; lay it 
lengthwise upon a clean napkin across 
your liand, forming a kind of bridge with 
your thumb at the part you are about to com- 
mence at. Then w ith the point of the larding 
needle make three distinct lines across, half 
an inch apart ; run the needle into the third 



line at the further side of the fricandeau, 
and bring it out at the first, placing one of 
the lardoons in it ; draw the needle through, 
leaving out a quarter of an inch of the ba- 
con at each line ; proceed thus to the end of 
the row. Then make another line half an 
inch distant ; stick in another row of lar- 
doons, bringing them out at the second 
line, leaving the ends of the bacon out all 
the same length. Make the next row again 
at the same distance, bringing the ends out 
between the lardoons of tlie first row, pro- 
ceeding in this manner until the whole sur- 
face is larded in chequered rows. Every- 
thing else is larded in a similar way, and in 
the case of poultry, hold the breast over a 
charcoal fire for one minute, or dip it into 
boiling water, in order to make the flesh 
firm." . 

Braising. 

Braising is a mode of cooking by the 
action of heat aboz'e, as well as below, the 
article cooked. A braising-pan has a deep 
cover (see engraving at Kitchen Utensils) 
on which live charcoal is placed. The pan 
is air-tight, and as all evaporation is thus 
precluded, the food braised imbibes what- 
ever flavour the cook may wish to give it ; 
in order to eflcct which, she must place in 
the pan with it whatever vegetables, &c., 
her recipe may direct. I'he ingredients 
should be very well proportioned, and the 
stewing should go on very slowly. 

We will give here one recipe for a braise, 
as an example of what is meant, 

A /owl braised. — Peel and wash a large 
Portugal onion, and one large turnip : cut 
them in thin slices, with a little celery, a 
few sprigs of parsley, and a bay leaf. Lay 
a few slices of fat bacon at the bottom of 
the pan, place the bird trussed for boiling 
on it, cover the breast with slices of fat 
I .'.icon. Lay the vegetables round it with a 
few bones or trimmings of fresh meat 
Add a pint and a half of stock, and season- 
ing to your taste. Cover the pot closely, set 
it over a slow stove, put live charcoal at 
the top, and let it cook slowly. 

When it is done keep the meat hot v.hile 
you strain the gravy and take off the fat, 
which you can do quicker by plunging the 
basin partly into cold water ; this will make 
the fat coagulate. Boil it up very quickly 
again till it thickens. Some cooks let the 
gravy adhere to the meat ; this is done by 
boiling It down till it is reduced just to the 
quantity required for the purpose. 

Saute-ing. 
To "Saute" anything means to dress it 
I quickly, in a small pan, with a very little 



34 



Steaming. — A Vocabulary of Cooking Terms. 



butter, oil, lard, or dripping, doing one side 
at a time. Two spoonfuTs of oil will be 
enough to sauii! a small chicken in. 

The art of saute-ing well consists in do- 
ing it quickly, to keep the gravy and succu- 
lence in the meat. It is an economical 
mode of dressing small things of every 
kind of food. It is, you see, very different 
from frying, which is really boiling in hot 
fat, and requires a far greater quantity of 
the butter, oil, &c., for its performance. 

Steaming. 

Steaming is an admirable mode of dress- 
ing bacon and hams. It preserves the fla- 
vour in them, and quite saves waste. Any 
one who has once eaten steamed bacon will 
never again, we think, order it to be boiled, 
so tender and succulent will it be found. 

In "Kitchen Utensils," page 21, will be 
found the engraving and description of a 
new steam saucepan, which promises to be 
a great addition to the kitchen. 

In it the meat or fowl is cooked without 
being touched by either water or steam. It 
appears to us to be a cheap and easy mode 



of braising in a new form. It is styled 
"Everybody's Cooking Pot." The noveltv 
of the process consists in cooking without 
the viands coming into actual contact with 
water or steam ; the meat, kept from water 
entirely, is cooked in an inner cyhnder, the 
outer one containing the water being kept 
at boiling-point. The food thus prepared 
is cooked in its own vapour, and none of 
its nutritious properties wasted. The well 
known fact, that meat cooked by the ordi- 
nary methods of roasting or boiling, loses 
a large portion both in bulk and weight, as 
well as some very important chemical qua- 
lities, is of itself sufficient to stamp with 
the seal of approbation any invention that 
avoids these evils. We have proved, by 
personally trying it, that meat, fish, and 
poultry, when cooked in this pot, retain 
those nourishing juices which, if cooked 
in the ordinary method, would have been 
thrown off in vapour, but by this mode 
become condensed and are returned in mois- 
ture at a temperature sufficient to cook in 
the most perfect manner. To the poor as 
well as the rich, this invention will there- 
fore prove a great boon.

CARVING. 



One of the most important acquisitions 
in the routine of daily Ufe is the ability to 
carve, not only well, but elegantly. It is 
true that the present fashion of Russian 
dinners is fast banishing tiie necessity for 
promiscuous carving from the richly-served 
boards of the wealthy ; but in the circles of 
middle life, where it is not adopted, the ne- 
cessity of skill in the use of a carving-knife 
is sufhciently obvious. 

Ladies ought especially to make carving 
a study ; at their own houses, and at the 
family dinner, they should be enabled to 
perform the task allotted to them with suffi- 
cient skill to prevent remark, or the calling 



forth of eager proffers of assistance from 
good-natured visitors near, who probably 
would far rather not be so employed. 

Carving presents no real difficulties ; it 
simply requires knowledge. All displays of 
e-xertion or violence are in very bad taste ; 
for if they are not an evidence of the want 
of ability on the part of the carver, they 
present a very strong testimony of the 
toughness of a joint, or the more than fiiU 
age of a bird : in both cases they should be 
avoided. A good knife of moderate size, 
sufficient length of handle, and great sharpn 
ness is requisite; the carving-knife for a lady 
should be light, and smaller than that used 



36 



Carviiix 



by gentlemen. Fowls are very easily 
carved ; and of joints, such as loins, 
breasts, fore-quarters, &c., tlie butcher 
should have strict injunctions to separate 
the joints. 

The dish upon which the article to be 
carved is placed should be conveniently 
near to the carver, so that he may have full 
control over it ; for if it is placed far off, 
nothing can prevent an ungracefulness of 
appearance, and a difficulty in performing 
that which if it were in its proper place 
could be achieved with ease. 

In helping fish, nicety and care must be 
exercised ; lightness of hand and dexterity 
of management are necessary, and can only 
be acquired by practice. The flakes which, 
in fish like salmon and cod, .are large, 
should not be broken in helping, for the 




FiUet of Veal. 



beauty of the fish is then destroyed, and it 
becomes less inviting to the appetite. 

In the following directions, accompanied 
by diagrams, we have endeavoured to be as 
explicit as possible ; but practice alone will 
enable any person to carve with skill and 
facility. 

Ribs of Beef. — There are two modes of 
carving this joint ; the first, which is now 
becoming common, and is easy to an ama- 
teur carver, is to cut across the bone, com- 
mencing in the centre, and helping fat from 
A, as marked in the engraving of the sirloin, 
or it should be carved in slices from A to B, 
commencing either in tlie centre of the joint 
or at the sides. Occasionally the bones are 
removed, and the meat formed into a fillet ; 
it should then be carved as a round of 
beef. 

An Aitch-Bone of Beef. — This is a 
simple joint to carve, but the slices from it 
must be cut quite even, and of a very mode- 
rate thickness. When the joint is boiled, 
before cutting it, remove a slice from the 
whole of the upper part, of sufficient thick- 
ness (say a quarter of an inch) to arrive at 
the juicy part of the meat at once. Carve 
from A to B ; let the slices be moderately 
thin — not loo thin — help fat with the lean in 
one piece, and give a little additional fat 
which you will find below C ; the solid fat 
is at A, and must be cut in slices hori- 
zontally. The round of beef is carved in 
the same manner. 

The Sirloin of Beef. — The 
under part should be first carved, as 
indicated in the engraving across the 
bone. In carving the upj^er part tlie 
same directions sliould be followed as 
for the ribs, carving either side, or in 
the centre, from A to B, and helping 
the fat from D. 

Fillet of Veal. — Cut a slice off 

the whole of the upper part in the 

same way as from a round of beef, 

this being, if well roasted, of a nice 

brown, should be helped in small 

pieces with the slices you cut for each 

person. The stuffing is skewered in 

the flap, and where the bone comes out there is 

some placed ; help this with the meat, with a 

piece of tlie fat. 

Neck of VEAL.^Were you to attempt to 
carve each chop, and serve it, you would not 
only place a gigantic piece upon the plate of the 
person you intended to help, but you would 
waste nmch time, and should the vertebras 
not have been jointed by the butcher, you 
would find yourself in the position of the un- 
graceful carver, being compelled to exercise a 
degree of strength which should never be suf- 
fe:vd to appear ; very possibly, too, splashing 
gravy in a manner not contemplated by the 



Carving. 



37 



person unfortunately near enough to 
receive it. Cut diagonally from B to A, 
and help in slices of moderate thick- 
ness ; you can cut from c to D in order 
to separate the small bones, divide and 
serve them, having first inquired if 
they are liked. 

Loin of Veal. — ^Thls joint is sent 
to table sen-ed as a sirloin of beef. 
Having turned it over, cut out the 
kidney and the fat, r-jturn it to its 
proper position, and car\-e it, as in the 
neck of veal, from b to a ; help 
with it a slice of kidney and fat. 
The kidney is usually placed upon a 
dry toast when removed from the 
joint. 

Shoulder of Veal is sent to 
table with the underpart placed up- 
f)ermost. Helj) it as a shoulder of 
mutton, beginning at the knuckle 
end. 

Thk Breast of Veal.— Sepa- 
rate the ribs from the brisket, cutting 
from a to B ; these small bones are 
the sweetest, and are mostly preferred ; 
you will cut them as at d d d, and ser\-e. 
The long ribs are divided as at C C C ; 
and ha\ ing ascertained the preference of 
the person, help accordingly ; at good 
tables the scrag is not served, but is 
found, when properly cooked, a very 
good stew. 

Calf's Head. — Tliere is much mere 
meat to be obtained from a calf's head 
by carving it one way than another. 
Carve from a to B, cutting quite down 
to the bone. At the fleshy part of the 




Breast of Veal. 




Half of Calf's Head. 



neck end you will find the throat sweet- j jjalate, which is imder the head, is by Fomc 
bread, of which you can help a slice with ■ thought a dainty, and should be proffered 
the other part ; you will remove the eye '• when carving. 



with the point of the knife and divide it in 
halves, helping those to it who profess a 
preference for it ; there are some gela- 
tinous pieces around it which are palatable. 



A Shoulder of Mutton. — This is a 
joint upon which a great diversity of opinion 
exists, many professing a species of liorror 
at its insipidity ; others finding much deli-

Carving, 



perly managed, it is an excellent joint, and 
if judiciously carved, will give satisfaction to 
all who partake of it. It should be served 
and eaten very hot. It is sent to table 
lying on the dish as shown in the annexed 
engraving. Commence carving from A to 
B, taking out moderately thin slices in the 
shape of a wedge ; some nice pieces may 
then be liclped from the blade-bone, from 
C to B, cutting on both sides of the bone. 
Cut the fat from D, carving it in thin slices. 




Saddle of Mutton. 



Some of the most delicate parts, however, 
lie on the under part of the shoulder ; take off 
thin pieces iiorizontally from Btoc, and from 
A ; some tender slices are to be met with at 
D, but they must be cut through as indicated. 
The shoulder of mutton is essentially a 
joint of tit-bits, and therefore, when carving 
it, the tastes of those at table should be 
consulted. It is a very insipid joint when 
cold, and should therefore be hashed if sent 
to table a second time. 

Leg of Mutton. — The under or 
thickest part of the leg should be ])laced 
uppermost, and carved in slices mode- 
rately thin, from B to C. Many persons 
have a taste for the knuckle, and this ques- 
tion should be asked, and, if preferred, it 
z should be sent to the guest. When cold, 
the back of the leg should be placed up- 
permost, and thus carved. If the cramp 
Ijone is requested, (some persons regard 
it as a dainty) insert your knife at D, pass- 
ing it rotuid to E, and you will remove it. 
Saddle of Mutton. — The 
tail end is divided in the engraving, 
and tlie kidneys skewered under 
each division ; this is a matter of 
taste, and is not always done. 
Carve from A to B in thin slices, 
help fat from c to D. You may 
help from the vertebra; en both 
sides of the loin, and then carve 
crosswise as marked in the engrav- 
ing, which gives, you both fat and 
lean ; help a slice of kidney to those 
who desire it. 

The Loin of Mutton, if small, 
should be carved in chops, begin- 
ning with the outer chop ; if large, 



carve slices the whole length. A neat way is to run the knife along the chine bone, and under 
the meat along the ribs ; it may then be cut in slices as shown in the engraving of the 
saddle of mutton. By this process fat and lean are served together ; your knife 
should be very sharp, and it should be done cleverly. 

Neck of Mutton, if the^crag and chine | rated from the ribs of the neck, and when 
bone are removed, is carved in the direction roasted the bones sent with the meat, 
of the bones. Haunch of Mutton is carved as haunch 

The Scrag of Mutton jhould be sepa- of venison. 

Fore Quarter of L.'Vmb. — Place your fork near the knuckle, and cut from a to c, to 

B, and on to D ; pass your knife 
under, lifting with your fork at 
the same time. The juice of 
half a lemon or Seville orange 
which has been sprinkled with 
salt and pepper, is then squeezed 

under the shoulder, and a slice 

^SC of fresh butter placed there also, 
'^'' the parts are re-united until tlie 
butter is melted, and the shoul- 
der is then placed upon a sepa-

from the ribs, from E to n, and 
then help the breast, G, or the neck, F, according to the taste of your guest.

39 



Haunxh of Venison. — Have 
tlie dish placed before )ou so that 
the loia is nearest to you, and the 
knuckle farthest ; then cut from A 
to B, sufficiently near the knuckle 
to prevent the escape of any gravy ; 
then make your first cut from A to 
C, with a slanting cut, and then let 
each succeeding slice be sloping, so 
th;it all the gravy may be retained 
in the hollow thus formed ; the fat 
will be found at the left side, and 
must be sen-ed with the meat. 

Kid, if kept until the age at which lambs 
are killed, is served and carved in the same 
m.anner ; if killed at a month or five weeks, 
it is roasted w hole, and carved in the kitchen. 

Pork. — The leg when sent to table should 
be placed with the back uppermost and the 

Ham is served as placed in the engraving, 
and should come to table ornamented. Carve 
from A to B, cutting thin slices slantingly, to 
give a wedge-like appearance. Those who 
prefer the hock carve at D, in the same 
direction as from A to B, then carve from 
D to C, in thin slices, as indicated in the 
diagiam. 

Boiled Tongue. — Carve across the 
tongue, but do not cut through ; keep the 
slices rather thin, and help the fat and kernels 
from underneath. 

Roast Pig. — The cook should send a 
roast pig to table as displayed here, garnished 
with head and ears ; carve the joints in the 
direction shown by tlie lines in the diagram, 
then divide the ribs ; serve with plenty of sauce. 
Should one of the joints be too much, it may 
be separated. Bread sauce and stuffing should 
accompany it. An ear and the jaw are favourite 
parts with many people. 

Hare.— Cut slices from B to A of moderate 
thickness. When the hare is young you can, 
after removing the shoulders and legs, cut 
across the back, and divide it into 
several pieces. This is not practicable 
with a full grown hare, unless it is 
boned. The shoulders and legs are 
easily removed by placing the knife 
between them, and turning them 
back ; the joint will disclose itself, 
and can then be separated. The 
head should not be removed until the 
last ; divide it from the neck, remove 
the lower jaw, then cut through the 
division which appears from the nose to the 
top of the skull, and lay it oi^en. The stuff- 
ing should be given with whatever portion 
may be helped. 

Ro.NST RAiiBiTS are carved in the same 
manner.

crackling be removed ; if sufficiently roasted 
this may be done with case. The meat should

cording to taste. The loins are cut into the 
pieces scored by the butcher.

1 ing it back, this is accomplished readily.

Roast Turkey. 



The most tender part is on the loins ; the 
meat there is of a very delicate flavour. 
Liver should be helped with it. 

Poultry. — Poultry requires skilful carv- 
ing. The requisites are grace of manner, 
ease in the performance, a perfect know- 
ledge of the position of the joints, and the 
most complete mode of dissecting, so as to 
obtain the largest quantity of meat. In no 
case is this ability more demanded than in 
carving a roast turkey. Unless this is done 
well, there is not only much waste, but the appearance 
of the turkey is spoiled. You will commence by carving 
slices from each side of the breast, in the same direction 
as the lines marked in the engraving, cutting from A 
to B. Then remove the legs, dividing (he thighs froni 
the drumsticks, and here an instrument termed a dis- 
jointer will be found serviceable, for unless the turkey 
be very young, and the union of the joints very accurately 
taken,' carving becomes difficult. The disjointer effects 
the separation at once, and it possesses also the advan- 
tage of enabling the car%'er to divide a thigh into two, 
thus permitting a less bulky portion to be sei-ved. The pinions and that portion of 
the body removed with it are' always a delicacy, and care should be taken to carve them 
nicely. The joint of the pinion will be found at B. The stuffing, if it be of truffles, you 
will obtain by making an opening at C. Ordinary forcemeat is found in helping the breast. 
^~~ Boiled Turkey is tnissed in a different fashion to 

the roast, but the direction given for can'ing the former 
applies to the latter. I'he legs in the boiled turkey 
being drawn into the body may cause some little diffi- 
culty at first in their separation, but a little practice will 
%~ soon surmount it. 

Roast Fowl.— This operation is a nice and skilful 
one to perform ; it requires both observation and 
practice. Insert the knife bet\<een the legs and tlie 
side, press back the leg with the blade of the knife, 
and the joint will come apart if judiciously managed, 
it will require bui a nick where the joints unite. Re- 
move the wing from D to B, cut through and lay it back 
as with the leg, separating the joint with the edge of the 
knife, remove the merrythought and neck bones next ; 
: this you will accomplish by inserting the knife and 
forcing it under the bones ; raise it and it will readily 
separate from the breast. You will divide tiie breast 
from the body by cutting through the small ribs down 
to the vent, turn the back uppermost, now put the knife 
into about the centre between the neck and rump, raise

tr.e lower part firmly yet gently, it will easily [ take oft the side bones, and the fowl is 
separate, turn the neck or rump from you, | car\cd. 

In separating the thigh from 
the drum-stick, you must insert 
the knife exactly at the joint, as 
we have indicated in the engrav- 
ing ; this, however, will be foimd 
to require practice, for the joint 
must be accurately hit, or else 
much difficulty will be experi- 
enced in getting the parts asun- 
der. There is no ditference in 
carving roast and boiled fowls, 
if full grown ; but in a very young fowl when roasted, the breast 
is sen'cd whole. The wings antl breast are preferred, "but the leg 
of a young fowl is an excellent part. Capons when very fine and 
roasted should have slices carved from the breast, like a turkey. 

Gkese. — Follow with your knife the lines marked in the engraving, A to B, and cut 
slices ; then remove the wing, and if the party be large, the legs must also be removed, 
and here the disjohiter will again prove ser\'iceable. The stuffmg will be obtained by 
making an insertion at the apron, C. 

Pheasant. — Clear the leg by inserting the edge of the knife 
between it and the body, then tgke off the wings, v, to A, but do 
not remove much of the i)reast witli them, you are thus enabled to 
obtain some nice slices ; the pheasant is then cnrvcd as a fowl. 
The breast is first In estimation, then the wings, and after these the 
merrythought ; lovers of game prefer a leg. 

Partridge.— Separate the legs, and then divide the bird into 
three parts, leaving each leg and wing together. The breast is 
then divided from the back, and helped whole, the latter being 
helped with any of the otiier parts. When the party consists of 
gentlemen only, the bird is divided in halves 
by cutting lengthwise right through from the 
centre. 

Quails, Landrail, Wiikateaes, T^akks, 
and all small biids are served whole. 

^^'ILD Ducks and Widgeon. — Tlie brcnst 
of these fowls being the best portion, is cnrvcd 
in slices, which are removed, and a glass of old 
port wine is poured in : the half of a lemon 
seasoned with Cayenne and salt should then be 
squeezed in, the slices relaid in their places, and 
fhen served, the joints being removed the same as in other fowls. 

Pigeon. — Like woodcock, these birds are cut in halves, through the breast and back, 
and the half is sent to the person helped.

Fish sliould never be touched with a steel knife. Fish slices, or a silver fish knife and 
fork, are used for carving it. It requires more 
care than knowledge to help fish — the principal 
thing is to avoid breaking the flakes. In caning 
a piece of salmon as here engraved, cut thin 
slices, as from A to P, and help with it pieces of 
the belly in the direction marked from c to d ; the 
best flavoured is the upper or thick part. 

TuRBOT. — Cut flat pieces as marked in the en- 
graving without moving the bone ; the fin, which 
is esteemed a delicacy, is always sened with if. 

All flat-fish, such as plaice, brill, Johndory, &c., are can-ed in the same manner; soles 
are cut either into halves, or, if very large, are divided into three, cutting them across right 
through. Flounders are served whole.

BREAKFAST HECIPES. 



To Eoast Coffee. 

1. Have either a Patent Roaster, or tlie 
Irish mop roaster. To every three pounds 
of coffee you put in the roaster add a piece 
of good fresh butter, a little larger than a 
marbla, and two tea-spoonfuls of jiowderod 
sugar ; then roast the berries. This little 
addition develops the aroma of the berry. 
Many people prefer having chicory added 
to their coffee— the proportion is about a 
quarter of a pound of chicory to a pound of 
coffee. 

Excellent Coffee for Three Breakfast Cups. 

2. Four tablespoonfuls of roasted coffee 
berries ; three teacupfuls of boiling water. 

Take four tablespoonfuls of roasted coffee 
berries and put them in the oven till well 
warmed through ; then grind them. Put 
the coffee in the pot, which should have a 



piece of lin over the middle strainer to pre- 
vent the coffee from filling up the holes ; pour 
in three teacupfuls of boiling water. Tlie 
breakfast-cup should be filled up with boil- 
ing milk. 

Soyer's Mode. 

3. Soyer's mode of making coffee was to 
warm the powder over the fire first, then to 
pour the boiling water over it ; co\er it 
closely for five minutes, strain it and boil it 
up again for use. This is a good way, but 
the easier plan is to make it in the percola- 
tor ; first warming the powder in a covered 
cup before it is put into the coffee-pot to be 
made. 

French coffee is made by adding a pint of 
made coffee to a pint of boiling milk, and 
warming both together, but not letting them 
boil too long.

oatmeal with your left hand, and stir with 
the right. When it is made, turn it into a 
soup-plate, adding a little salt or a little 
sugar, according to taste. Send it to table 
with a jug of hot milk, which should be 
added to it by degrees for eating. 



To Toast Muffins. 

9. Pull open the sides of the mulTin exactly 
in the centre, about half an inch in ; put the 
toasting-fork in it and toast it carefully. 
When it is done, and it should only be 
lightly toasted, pull it apart, lay a little 
butter on each s'de, and close the muffin. 
Put it on a hot plate and cut it in four. If 
more than one are required, lay them on 
the first done, but do not send in a great 
pile of muffins, as they are better served hot. 
A hot-walcr plate with a cover, — a regular 
muffin plate, — should be used, and two at 
the most only be sent in at a time. 

Cmmpets. 

10. Do not open cnimpets ; toast them 
carefully and very quickly ; butter them on 
both sides, and serve them separately on a 
hot-water plate, if you have one ; if not, 
send them in hot and hot, as they are not 
nice lukewarm. Never put one crumpet on 
the top of the other, as the under one would 
become heavy. 

Bread. 

Everybody is, I believe, of opinion that 
home-made bread is cheaper, sweeter, and 
more wholesome than that bought at the 
baker's, unless it is badly made. Heavy, 
close, bitter bread is only too well known in 
many households wliere it is home-made ; 
this is not economical, as it cannot nourish 
the eaters as good bread does, and it is, 
generally speaking, wasted. Let us see if 
it is not possible to teach how to make bread 
of all kinds, which shall be good, light, 
sweet, and appetizing. The oven plays an 
important part in this manufacture. 

A brick oven heated with wood is the 
right one for economy. It is possible to 
bake bread in the iron oven attaciiccl to a 
range, but the author, from personal experi- 
ence, can assure h.er readers that home- 
made bread thus baked is more expensive 
than bakers', on account of the quantity of 
fuel it takes to heat the oven for bread- 
baking, and the necessity of making it up in 
small loaves, which are not economical. 

The biick oven is heated by faggot wood ; 
after it is cleared out, the door should be 
shut very closely for half an hour before you 
put in your loaves. The oven will then be 
thoroughly heated, and the heat will last for 
some time, 

A brick oven for baking bread should be 
as hot as you can bear to hold your hand in 
(without touching the bi icks of course) whilst 
counting twenty ; this is an established rule 
in most farmhouses. 

Bread is longer baking in an iron oven 
than in a brick one. Next to the oven in

Recipes for Yeast and Bread. 



importance comes the yeast. We have used, 
and like, both German and patent yeast, 
but as many persons prefer their own, and 
it is always well for the house to be inde- 
pendent of external helps in this matter, we 
give receipts for making yeast, for the good- 
ness of which we can answer. 

Flour should be purchased of a miller ; 
it will be less likely to be adulterated than 
if it passed through a second hand. The 
best flour is generally used in gentlemen's 
kitchens ; nevertheless, we know several 
county families (and one nobleman's family) 
famous for excellent household bread, in 
which the " best seconds " are always used. 

There is no doubt that more nutrition is 
contained in brown bread than in white, and 
that the zvhifer the bread the less is the 
nourishment derived from it. Brown bread 
is excellent for weak digestions, and for 
many other reasons should be eaten alter- 
nately with white bread in all families ; 
moreover, it is less adulterated than the 
very white bread, when purchased from the 
baker's. 

The flour of "hard wheat," as it is called, 
is the most nutritious ; it is not so white as 
that procured from soft wheat, but has more 
gluten in it. 

Flour when kept in store should be placed 
in a warm dry room, as, if at all damp, it 
will make the bread or cakes for which it is 
used heavy. It is safest to put the quantity 
of flour you are about to make into bread 
before the fire in a large dish or pan for an 
hour or two, in order to have it warm and 
dry for use. 

Great cleanliness is required for making 
bread — a clean trough or brown earthen- 
ware pan ; very clean hands and arms, and 
nice fresh yeast. The fresher the yeast, the 
less you will require of it. 

Never leave the dough half made, nor 
allow it to get cold before it is finished ; if 
you do, it will be heavy. Too small a 
proportion of yeast will make the dough 
heavy. 

If the sponge or the dough be permitted 
to overwork itself it will become sour in 
warm weather. Do not put it too near the 
fire, but keep it warm at a gentle and equal 
degree of heat. 

Bread baked in tins will be lighter than 
when made into ordinary loaves, and is best 
for toast or sandwiches. 

Too little water will spoil the bread ; too 
much will make it too slack. If by accident 
the latter fault is perceptible, make the 
bread up in tins, and it will not much 
matter. 

The proportions given in the numerous 
recipes contained in this book, may of 



course be modified according to the quan- 
tity of bread required. 

How to maie your own Yeast. 

Time to boil, half an hour ; to make, four 

days. 

11. Two ounces of the best hops ; four 
quarts of water ; one pound of flour ; three 
pounds of good potatoes. 

Monday morning boil two ounces of the 
best hops in four quarts of water for half an 
hour ; strain it, and let the liquor cool down 
to new milk warmth ; then put in a small 
handful of salt and half a pound of brown 
sugar ; beat up one pound of the best 
flour with some of the liquor, and then mix 
all well together. On Wednesday add 
three pounds of potatoes, boiled and then 
mashed, to stand till Thursday ; then strain 
it, and put it into scltzer-water bottles, and 
it is ready for use. 

N.B. — It must be stirred frequently while 
it is making, and kept near the fire. Before 
using, shake the bottle well up. It will 
keep in a cool place for two months, and is 
best at the latter part of the time. The 
beauty of this yeast is, that it ferments 
spontaneously, not requiring the aid of 
other yeast ; and, if care be taken, it will 
ferment well in the earthen bowl in which it 
is made. 

To make Bread. 

Time, one hour to bake loaves of two 

pounds weight each. 

12. Seven pounds of flour ; two quarts of 
warm water ; a large tablespoonful of salt ; 
half a gill of yeast. 

Put the flour into a deep pan, heap it 
round the sides, leaving a hollow in the 
centre ; put into it a quart of warm water, a 
large spoonful of salt, and half a gill of 
yeast ; have ready three pints more of warm 
water, and with as much of it as may be 
necessary, make the whole into a rather soft 
dough, kneading it well with both hands. 
When it is smooth and shining, strew a 
little flour on it ; lay a thickly folded cloth 
over it, and set it in a warm place by the 
fire for four or five hours ; then knead it 
again for a quarter of an hour ; cover it 
over, and set it 1o rise again ; divide it into 
two or four loaves, and bake in a quick 
oven. It will take one hour to bake it if 
divided into loaves weighing two pounds 
each, and two hours if the loaves weigh four 
pounds each. This bread need only rise 
once, and if made of the best superfine flour 
will be beautifully white and light. 

In cold weather bread should be mi.xed in 
a warm room, and not allowed to become 
cold v/hile rising.

If there is any difficulty as to its rising, 
set the bowl or pan over boiling water. 

It is best to mix the bread at night, and 
cover it close, in a warm room should the 
weather be cold, till the morning. 

Of course, if the family be large, the 
quantities may be increased or doubled in 
proportion. 

American Mode. 

Time to balce, one hour to a loaf of two 

pounds weight. 

13. Two quarterns of flour ; four table- 
spoonfuls of fresh yeast ; one tablespoonful 
of salt ; one pint of water. 

Mix four tablespoonfuls of good fresh 
yeast with a pint of lukewarm water ; stir 
the salt well into the flour ; make a hole 
with your hand in the centre, and pour the 
yeast into it, and stir it thoroughly until you 
have made it into a rather thin batter ; 
dredge some flour over it ; cover the pan 
with a thick cloth, and set it near the fire 
for an hour ; then add a quart of water just 
warm, and knead the whole well together 
until it passes clean through your hand ; 
then let it stand, not too near the fire, for 
another hour ; divide it into loaves, and 
bake it. 

German Teast Bread. 
Time, one and a half to two hours. 

14. Two quarterns of flour ; one table- 
spoonful of salt ; two ounces of dried Ger- 
man yeast ; a cupful of water ; a pint and a 
half of warm water. 

Dissolve the yeast in a small cupful of 
cold water, and then add it to a pint and a 
half of warm water. Put the flour well 
mixed with the salt into a deep bread pan ; 
make a hole in the middle of the flour, and 
pour in the water and yeast ; knead it up 
quickly, and let it stand near the fire 
covered over with a thick cloth for one 
hour ; then divide it into loaves, and bake 
them according to their size. You may 
make up a much larger quantity of flour, 
and bake the loaves two or three at a time, 
if care is taken not to keep the dough too 
warm. 

Potato Bread. 
Time, to bake, one and a half to two hours. 

15. Two and a half pounds of mealy 
potatoes ; seven poimds of flour ; a quarter 
of a pint of yeast ; two ounces of salt. 

Boil two pounds and a half of nice mealy 
potatoes till floury ; rub and mash them 
smooth ; then mix tliem with sufficient cold 
water to let them pass through a coarse 
sieve, and any lump that remains must be 
again mashed and pressed through. Mix 



this paste with the yeast, and then add it to 
the flour. Set it to rise, well knead it, and 
make it into a stiff tough dough. 

To make Brown Bread. 

Time, one or two hours, according to 

weight. 

16. Three parts of second flour ; the 
fourth part of rye ; a little milk ; and the 
right proportion of water. 

Take three parts of second flour, and the 
fourth of rye, lay it one night in a cool place, 
and the next morning work it up with a 
little milk added to the water. Set it at a 
proper distance from the fire to rise, and 
then make into loaves and bake. 

Bice Bread. 

Time, one and a half to two hours. 

17. Half a pound of rice ; three pints of 
water ; six pounds of flour. 

Boil half a pound of rice in three pints of 
water till the whole is quite thick ; with this, 
and yeast, and six pounds of flour make the 
dough. This will make as much as eight 
pounds of flour without the rice. 

American Eecipe for Light Breakfast 

Bread. 

Time, to bake, half an hour. 

18. One quart of milk (it may be skim- 
med) ; three-quarters of a pint of flour ; one 
teacupful of hop-yeast ; half a tablespoonful 
of salt ; a small piece of butter. 

Heat one-third of the quart of milk and 
scald it with half a pint of flour. If you use 
skimmed milk, add a small piece of butter. 

When the batter thus made is cool, add 
the remainder of the milk, a teacupful of 
hop-yeast, half a tablespoonful of salt, with 
flour enough to make it quite stiff. Knead 
it on a paste-board till it is very fine and 
smooth. Leave it to rise all night. 

This will make two small loaves and half 
a dozen biscuits. 

Ti.me, half an hour. 

19. One pou-nd of flour ; one egg ; one 
ounce of butter ; one spoonful of yeast ; a 
little salt, and some milk. 

Well beat the butter into the flour, add- 
ing a little salt ; beat an e:%g, and stir it into 
the flour with the yeast, and a sufficient 
quantity of milk to make the dough ratlier 
stiff". Beat it well without kneading it ; set 
it to rise, and bake it on tins. This quantity 
will make about six rolls, and when done 
rasp them before serving. Rolls (or any 
sort of bread) may be made new by dipping

22. One pint of warm milk ; half a tea- 
spoonful of melted butter ; half a gill of 
yeast ; a teaspoonful of salt ; a bit of sale- 
ratus the size of a pea ; and sufficient flour 
to make a thick batter ; two eggs. 

Mix with a pint of warm milk two well- 
beaten eggs, the melted butter, salt, and 
the saleratus dissolved in a little hot water ; 
then stir into it sulficient wlieat flour to 
make a thick batter ; set it in a warm place 
to rise, for three hours in warm weather, or 
longer in the winter ; put a gridle over the 
fire ; when it is hot, rub it over with some 
buttor, grease the inside of the rings, set 
them on it and half fill them with the batter, 
or they may be done without rings. When 
one side is done turn the other ; bake them 
a light colour. When they are done, break 
them open, put a bit of butter into each, 
and set them before the fire until served. 
They must never be cut. If cold they must 
be picked open, toasted on each side lightly, 
and butter put into them.

Time, five minutes after the top has 

blistered. 

23. One and a half ounce of German 
yeast, or half a gill of common yeast ; a 
quart of warm milk ; a cupful of melted 
butter ; a little salt. 

Make the milk warm, and stir it info the 
yeast with a little salt. Add a sufficient 
quantity of flour to make it into a batter. 
Set it to rise for half an hour ; then add a 
cupful of melted butter. Stir it well in, and 
pour it into iron rings previously placed on 
a hot plate, and bake them very lightly on 



both sides. When required, toast them on 
each side, taking care tliey do not burn ; 
butter them nicely, cut tiiem across, and 
put them upon a hot plate ; serving them 
quickly, hot and hot. 

Devilled Biscuits. 

24. Get some very thin plain biscuits, 
pour over them a little clarified butter, and 
let them stand for a short time ; then dredge 
over them on each side a little pepper, salt, 
and Cayenne ; press it lightly over with a 
knife, and toast them on a gridiron over a 
clear fire. 

A thin layer of sardines, salmon, or an- 
chovies may be placed on the biscuits, and 
browned with a salamander, or in the oven, 
and will make a delicious relish ; but they 
are extremely nice without, served plain.

a httle salt. Make a hole in the middle of 
the flour and pour the milk into it, stirring 
it well as you do so. Put it on the paste- 
board, flour a roller, and roll it out to about 
three quarters of an inch thick. Cut it out 
into cakes, and lay them on a gridle, turning 
them oiten to prevent them from burning.

dice of the yolks, piled up in them. Cut up 
some coss lettuce very nicely ; lay it on the 
dish, and place the eggs on it. 

Brawn. 
O.xford brawn is considered the best to 
purchase. The following recipes, especially 
the first, will be- found excellent for family 
use. . 

Brawn. 

Time, three nights ; six hours to Loil, three 
hours to get cold. 

33. Pickled porker's head ; two tongues ; 
two feet, and two extra ears ; four fried sau- 
sages ; some slices of boiled ox tongue ; 
dried sage, pepper and salt, one teaspoonful 
of each for seasoning ; three tablespoonfuls 
of salt to cover the head . 

Cut the porker's head in half, and soak 
one night ; cover it with salt for one night, 
boil slowly six hours. Let it get cold. Take 
out the bones. Boil the two tongues, feet, 
and ears one hour and a half ; remove the 
bones and gristle. Cut all the meat into 
small pieces ; season with sage, pepper, and 
salt, well mixed. Cut the sausages into 
slices. Place slices of ox tongue, which 
should be of a nice red colour, in a pattern 
round the mould or tin ; put in the meat, 
and press it firmly down with a weight on 
the top. Let it stand one night. 

The tongues may be put in whole, if pre- 
ferred, about the middle of the mould. 

Plovers' Eggs. 
Time, two minutes. 

34. Plovers' eggs must be boiled hard and 
served either hot or cold. For breakfast, 
line a little basket with moss and lay them 
in it. If you have no basket, sei-ve them 
on a folded tablenapkin, or shell them and 
pour Bechamel sauce over them. 

You may manufacture a satisfactory bas- 
ket for plovers' eggs, by lining one of the 
round baskets in which strawberries are sold 
with moss, both outside and inside, and 
bending a twig or wire over it for a handle. 

This basket of eggs is a gi-eat ornament 
to a brealciast table. 

Ham Toast.

Make your forcemeat by chopping up the 
beef suet very fine ; grating the bread, chop- 
ping the parsley, and mixing the whole ; 
grate in a little lemon peel, season it with 
pepper and salt. (Soyer was wont to say 
that seasoning could not be sufficiently accu- 
rate unless it was sprinkled in by the cook's 
fingers.) Beat the yolk o'' an e^gg and bind 
the forcemeat with it ; let four eggs boil for 
ten minutes. Warm half a pint of rich 
brown gravy. When the eggs are boiled 
hard take them from their shells, and brush 
them over thickly with the forcemeat. Put 
a little butter in a stew-pan ; fry them a light

butter into an omelet-pan, and when it just 
begins to bubble, whisk up the mixture, and 
pour it into the pan, stir it with a spoon one 
way until it thickens and becomes warm, 
and then fold the edges of the omelet over 
in an oval form. Brown it nicely, and serve 
as quickly as possible, as the ligluness of an 
omelet is spoilt unless it is served imme- 
diately. It may be browned on the top with 
a salamander. 

Pigs' Kidneys

in halves, egg and bread-cnmib them, and 
broil thein. Cut the ears into fillets, put 
them into a stew-pan with two sliced onions, 
two ounces of butter, and a tcaspoonful of 
flour. When tiiey are browned, take them

three-quarters of a pint o: vinegar ; a quarter 



of a pint of the water in which they are 
boiled ; six pepper corns ; a little allspice ; 
four cloves ; a little mace. 

Scald the feet and scrape them clean ; if 
the covering of the toes will rot come off 
without, singe them in hot embers, until 
they are loose ; then take them off. Some 
persons put the feet in weak lime-water to 
whiten them. Having scraped them clean 
and white, wash them and put them into a 
pot of warm, but not boiling water, witli a 
little salt. Let them boil gently till by turn- 
ing a fork in the flesh it will easily break, 
and the bones are all loosened, lake off 
the scum as it rises. When they are done 
take them out of the water and lay them in 
vinegar enough to cover tliem, adding to it 
a quarter of a pint of the water in which 
they were boiled. Add whole pepper and 
spice with cloves and mace. Put them in a 
jar, and cover them closely. 

Soused feet may be eaten cold from the 
vinegar, split in two from top to toe ; or 
they may be split in two, dipped in flour, 
and fried in hot lard ; or they may be broiled 
and buttered. 

But, in the latter case, they should bo 
nicely browned

f)epp€r ; one ounce of butter. 

Take a large onion, parboil and drain it ; 
cat out a piece from the flat side like a lid ; 
scoop out as much of the inside as will 
suffice to leave a hollow big enough to hold 
a sheep's kidney ; then cut the kidney in 
quarters, without quite separating it ; put in 
some butter, pepper, and salt ; close it, and 
place it in the scooped-out onion. Put the 
lid on again, and lay the onion in a dish 
with a little butter. Bake in the oven.

ivith made mustard. Season them highly 
tvith salt, white and Cayenne pepper. Grill 



them over a clear fire, and serve them very 
dry on a hot table-napkin. 

Oyster Loaves CAmerica). 

Time, to stew the oysters, five to six 

minutes, 

53. Four small round breakfast rolls ; 
two dozen of oysters and their liquor ; four 
ounces of butter ; one large teaspoonful of 
salt ; half a teaspoonful of pepper ; one tea- 
spoon ful of essence of anchovies; half a 
t-;aspoonful of pounded mace. 

Have ready four small round breakfast 
loaves ; take a circular piece neatly out of 
the top of each, and carefully scoop out tlie 
crumb. Put two dozen oysters into a stew- 
pan with their liquor, four ounces of butter, 
one teaspoonful of salt, half a teaspoonful of 
pepper, one teaspoonful of essence of ancho- 
vies, and half\\\& crumbs froin the loaves.

salmon. 

54. Half to tliree-quarters of a pound of 
kippered salmon ; a litde pepper. 

Have ready a well-heated gridiron, the 
bars of which should be greased, and a nice 
clear fire. Cut the salmon into narrow bars 
of convenient size, wrap them in buttered 
writing-paper, and broil, turning them once 
or twice. Serve on a very hot dish, laying 
the pieces across each other.

with the outside downwards ; pour boiling 
water over it ; if salt be objected to, repeat 
the process. Place it on a di-.li the right 
side upwards, and spread butter on it before 
the fire. 

Finnan Haddocks. 
Time, about ten minutes. 

56. These fish, which are much esteemed, 
are dressed open on account of one side 
being thicker than the other. They are 



f I 



generally bought prepared for cooking, and 
only require a little soaking before they are 
put on the gridiron. When done, lay the 
fish on a hot dish, and put a little cold fresh 
butter on it. 

To Cook Ited Herrings and Bloaters- 
Time, five minutes. 

57. Scrape them and wipe them nicely ; 
cut them from head to tail : lay them open ; 
broil them on a grc-ased gridiron for about 
six minutes, turning them as required. 
When they are done, lay them open on a 
hot dish, and put a little butter on them. 

Herrings too dry may be rendered fit for 
use by soaking them for half an hour or so 
in warm water. 

To Broil Black Pnddings. 

Time, five minutes. 

58. Make little diagonal cuts in the skin 
of the black pudding with a knife. Broil 



it over a brisk fire, turning it often. Serve 
it very hot. 

Sausages. 
Time, twenty minutes. 

Cambridge sausages are thouglit the best 
for breakfast. But we advise our readers, 
if possible, to make their sausage meat at 
home, as they may then be sure of the ma- 
terials of which they are made. If they 
cannot be home-made they should be pur- 
chased at a very respectable shop, so that 
no doubts may be entertained of them. 

Piick the sausages with a large needle or 
fine skewer all over, this will prevent the 
skin from cracking, broil them over a gentle 
fire for about twenty minutes. Serve veiy 
hot on toast. We prefer putting them into 
hot water for one minute before dressing, to 
extract the oil from the skin. Directions 
for making sausage meat will be found 
under the head of Pork. 



FISH. 



Fisit is a delicious adjunct to the dinner- 
fable, and in some families may suffice for a 
^ood dinner by itself ; but it requires nice 
and careful dressing. What can be more 
unappetizing than a fish brought to table 
broken all to pieces, as we have seen it, or 
not half done — salmon red with blood — cod 
nearly raw — or mackerel not properly 
cleaned ? It is a wicked waste of the pro- 
vision God has made for his creatures to 
thus spoil it, when a litde attention and 
study may preserve it for us. 

And first, let great care be taken to well 
clean the fish before it is dressed. It is 
better to let the fishmonger clean it for you ; 
but if you are compelled to do it yourself, 
take care that you slit it low enough, so as 
not to leave any blood, &c., on the back- 
bone. We have been obliged to send fish 
from our own table imtasted in consequence 
of a careless cook neglecting this part of 
her duty. 

In almost all kinds of fish the portions to 
be removed are the gills, the alimentary 
organs, and the settlement of slime and 
other impurities inside and outside the fish. 
Dexterity must be used to cleanse the in- 
side thoroughly without making too large 
an incision, which disfigures the fish when 
it comes to table, and may make it, if it is 
for boiling, watery. The sound, which 
adheres to the bone, must be left undis- 
turbed, but cleansed ; the hard and soft roe 
must also be left in their places ; and care 
must be taken not to injure the liver, but. 



with most fish, to replace it. Especial care 
must be taken not to break the gall, as that 
renders the fish very bitter. 

As a medium in which to fry, there is 
nothing better than pure oil, but it is ex- 
pensive, because the fish must have abund- 
ance in the pan or it will not turn out well, 
and wear the bright gold hue that should 
characterize fried fish. 

If it be found inconvenient to use oil, 
plenty of good dripping or lard will do as 
well. Butter is apt to burn fish black, and 
make them soft. 

It is utterly useless, however, to provide 
fine oil or clear fat for frying, if the pan be 
soiled or smoked, for that will spoil the 
colour and the flavour too of the fish, be it 
dressed as carefully as it can be in other 
respects. Fish-kettles, with plates, of con- 
venient sizes, and kept scrupulously clean, 
are likewise necessary ; also a gridiron for 
broiling. These utensils are requisite for 
the methods of dressing fish which are 
generally most popular. 

For fricassees and stews, good stewpans 
of different sizes will be needed ; stewpans 
lined with enamel are best, and if they are 
of first-rate quality, and cleaned with care, 
they will last a great number of years. 
Stewpans are most convenient made of an 
oblong shape, and with the4iandle set on at 
one end. These are much more convenient 
to liandle when full, than those with the 
handles on the broad side ; and they are 
Ukewise more easy to place on tiie fire or 
4—5.

E(ove, from standing on any narrow space 
at lihrrty, instead of requiring a good width 
of fuc. Placed on the wide way, one 
stewpan will occupy a range of medium 
size ; whereas those which can be placed 
the narrow way can stand several side by 
side on the same space. Engravings of the 
fish-kettles now used are given in Kitchen 
Utensils. 

Apparatuses for cooking au gratin should 
have a place in every kitchen. The prin- 
ciple of cooking ati gratin is fo place fire 
both above and below the food to be so 
dressed, which of course effectually keeps 
in the juices of the viands, and their full 
flavour. The utensil used for the purpose 
in France is a/our de campagne, a kind of 
long-handled chafing-dish with a flat bot- 
tom — for holding hot charcoal. The thing 
which has to be dressed au gratin is put in 
a deep dish which will stand fire, and in 
which also it is served ; this is placed on a 
stove where the under side of the fish or 
meat in it \vill cook slov/ly, and the fotir de 
campagne is placed on the top of the dish, 
when the heat from the hot charcoal at the 
san>e time cooks the upper surface of the 
fish. The manner in which the steam is 
kept in renders the flavour excellent. 

Boiled fish sliould always be washed and 
rubbed carefully with a little vinegar, before 
they are put into the water, except salmon 
and trout. 

Put the fish into cold water, in which you 
have thrown a good quantity of coarse salt 
(about four ounces to one gallon of water). 
Allow for time of cooking about ten 
minutes for each pound of fish ; but when a 
fish weighs a good many pounds, allow six 
minutes a pound for the whole — i.e., a fish 
of ten pounds may be dressed in an hour ; 
or you may try if it be done by passing a 
knife next to tlie bone. If the fish parts 
easily from it, it is done ; if it adheres at all 
to the bone, it is not done. Under-dressed 
fish is very unwholesome. 

Take the fish from the water the moment 
it is done, or it will become woolly. If it is 
dressed before you are ready to serve it, 
take it out of the water, set the drainer 
across the kettle, and lay a folded napkin 
over the fish. 

Supposing you chance not to have a fish- 
keftle, and yet wish to dress fish by boiling, 
you may manage thus : put the fish in a 
circle on a dinner-plate, and fie a napkin 
over it ; then put it in a large saucepan. 
Wlien it has boiled long enough, take it up 
carefully by the cloth, drain ofl:" all the water, 
and slide the fish on a white napkin neatly 
folded on a dish. Garnish and serve. 

Fresh-water fish have often a muddy taste 



and smell, which may be got lid of I'V 
soaking them in strong salt and water before 
they are cooked. 

Salt fish should be soaked in water before 
boiling according to the time it has been in 
salt. When it is hard and dry, it will re- 
quire thirty-six hours soaking before it is 
dressed, and the water must be changed 
three or four times. When fish is not very 
salt, twenty-four hours, or even one night, 
will suffice. 

Crimped fish must be put into boiling 
water, and when it has been placed on the 
fire and re-boils, pour in a teacupful of cold 
water to check it, and let it simmer a few 
minutes. Salmon is put into warm water 
to be dressed. 

Cod, whiting, and haddock are better if 
kept a day before boiling ; just putting a 
little salt on them the night before dressing. 

But some great cooks have advocated 
dressing cod quite fresh ; from oiu" own ex- 
perience we prefer it kept for twelve hours.* 

To Fry Fish. 

59. Cleanse them thoroughly, dry them 
on a folded cloth, dredge flour lightly over 
them, brush them with a well-beaten Gg%, 
then dip them in f\ne bread-crumbs. 

Have ready enough fine oil, or melted 
lard or beef dripping (clarified), to entirely 
cover the fish. Place the frying-pan over a 
clear fire. Let the lard reach boiling-point, 
and then immerse the fish in it. You may 
try whether the fat is hot enough by letting 
a diop of cold water fall into it from the end 
of your spoon. If the hot fat spits it is 
ready for use. Then fry, turning the fish 
(when one side is browned) to the other. 
When it is done lay it on a cloth, or on 
white blotting-paper, to drain off all the 
fat ; or put it on a reversed sieve for a little 
while. Serve it extremely dry on a white 
cloth or embossed fish paper. 

To Broil Fish. 

60. A clear fire is required. 

Rub the bars of your gridiron with drip- 
ping or a piece of beef suet, to prevent the 
fish from sticking to it. Put a good piece 
of butter into a dish, work into it enough 
salt and pepper to season the fish. Lay the 
fish on it when it is broiled, and with a 
knife blade put the butter over every part. 
Serve very hot. 

Batter for Frying Fish. 

61. One egg ; a little flour ; pepper and 
salt ; mace and nutmeg ; butter or oil. 

* For a great variety of modes of dressing fish, 
see Warne's " Fish, and How to Dress 'i'xicm," 
by E. \\'atts. 



To Cook Titrhot. 



53 



Beat up an egg until it thoroughly froths, 
:icl then beat in flour enough to make the 
Latter very thick, so that a sufficiency of it 
will adhere to the fish dipped into it before 
flying. To make the dish savoury, season 
tlie batter with pepper, salt, and add mace 
and nutmeg in powder, if the flavour of 
spice is liked. Dip the fish into this batter, 
and put each piece as dipped into the 
boiling butter or oil. 

Boiled Turbot. 

Turbot is the finest of the flat fish. 
It is very expensive, but can sometimes be 
bought che.ap, if it happens to be disfigured 
by having red spots on the under side. But 
these can be removed by rubbing salt and 
lemon on them ; and in the new way of 
sending up turbot with the dark side 
garnished, they would not matter in the 
least degree. 

It has been celebrated from the days of 
ancient Greece and Rome. Its usual weight 
is from five to twenty pounds. A good fish 
sliould be thick ; the flesh is firm, and the 
fish stiff when it is fresh. 

In season from March till August. 

Time, one hour, for ten pounds, more or 
less according to weight. 

62. Empty the fish, wash the inside, rub a 
little salt over the outside to help remove 
the shme. Put it in water to cleanse it, 
change the water several times. Pour 
plenty of cold spring water into a fish- 
kettle, add to each gallon of water four 
ounces of salt, and a quarter of an ounce, 
or less, of saltpetre. Let this dissolve while 
you prepare your turbot. Make an incision 
in the skin of the back nearly to the bone, 
to prevent tlie skin of the white side from 
cracking. Do not cut off the fins, these are 
considered a delicacy. Place the turbot on 
the fish plate, and put it into the water, 
which should quite cover it. Let it boil 
slowly and skim the water very carefully. 
Then let it simmer gently for about half an 
hour if it is of great size, according to the 
proportionate weight. 

When it is done hft up the fish plate and 
let it drain ; keep it very h.ot while you 
garnish it with lobster coral (which must be 
rubbed through a fine hair sieve) ; then slide 
it gently on a hot dish, on which a folded 
damask napkin or an ornamental fish paper 
has been placed previously. 

It is usual to serve the under or white 
part of the turbot uppermost, and certainly 
the contrast of the pure white skin with the 
lobster coral ornamentation on it, makes it 
the most inviting-looking fish served. But 
epicures have lately preferred it served with 



the dark side or back upwards, on account 
of some supposed superiority of the flesh of 
the fish on that side. It is given in our 
engraving in the newest mode of serving it ; 
but not being an epicure ourselves, we 
prefer the old and more picturesque fashion. 
Garnish with sprigs of curled parsley and 
slices of lemon alternately. 

Sauce. — Lobster, shrimp, or anchovy, in 
a tureen, 

Twiee-laid Tiu-bot. - 

Time, twenty minutes. 

63. The remains of a turbot boiled the 
day previously ; two tablespoonfuls of flour ; 
one quart of millc ; a small bunch of parsley ; 
a bay-leaf and a little thyme ; a spoonful of 
salt, and a saltspuon (not quite full) of 
pepper ; a quarter of a pound of fresh 
butter. 

Pick the fish from its bones and warm it 
gently in salt and water. While it is doing 
make a sauce of the ingredients given above 
by mixing the flour and milk very smoothly, 
adding the herbs and seasoning, and stirring 
it over the fire till it is tolerably thick. Then 
lift it to the side of the fire, stir in a quarter 
of a pound of butter, and pass it througli a 
sieve. Cover the bottom of the dish with 
this simple white sauce, lay on it some of 
your fish, sprinkling it with white pepper 
and salt, then put more sauce, then more 
fish, till the whole is used up. Sprinkle 
breadcrumbs over it, and bake it in a hot 
oven for twenty minutes. Brown it, and 
serve it in the same dish. 

Fillets of Turbot. 
Time, six minutes to each pound of fish. 

64. One small turbot ; one lemon ; a little 
pepper and salt, and a large lump of butter. 

Divide a small turbot down the middle of 
the back, next separate it from the fins, and 
raise the fish clean from the bones with a 
sharp knife ; divide it into oblong pieces, 
and put them in a stewpan with a large 
lump of butter ; the juice of a strained 
lemon, and a little pepper and salt. Set 
them over the fire, and turn the fillets to 
admit of their being thoroughly dressed and 
browned on both sides. When done, drain 
them, and dish them in a similar way to 
cutlets, cover them with either lobster, 
shrimp, or maitre dh6tel sauce. 

To Dress a very Small Turbot. 

65. One small turbot ; two ounces of 
grated cheese ; half a pint of white sauce, 
or butter melted in milk ; some bread- 
crumbs. 

Coil a very sniall turbot ; pull it to pieces. 



54 



Frcsh-zvaier Brcavi. — Sahnon. 



and mix with it the grated cheese, and 
white sauce or butter. Put the mixture into 
a dish, sprinkle breadcrumbs well over the 
top, and brown with a salamander, or be- 
fore the fire in a Dutch oven. 

Cold Turbot. 

66. Three heads of coss lettuce ; two 
eggs ; two anchovies ; a teaspoonful of 
capei-s ; two or three gherkins. 

The cold turbot which remains from a 
dinner does very well for a salad. Divide 
it into pieces of convenient size, and arrange 
them in a mould in the middle of the dish ; 
put lettuce, and hard-boiled eggs cut in 
quarters round ; strew over all slices of 
anchovy, capers, and gherkins. Then pour 
over without disarrangement some salad 
mixture. Cold turbot is excellent en 
Mayonnaise, or dressed after any of the 
receipts given for cold cod. 

Water Soucliy. 

67. Two quarts of water ; one bouquet of 
parsley. 

Plaice, flounders, or any fresluvater-fish, 
are good for a souchy. Boil the fish ; stand 
aside the handsomest looking, and boil down 
one or two to rags in the liquor, of which 
there should be about two quarts ; boil in it 
also a bouquet of parsley. Pulp the fish 
which is boiled down, and chop the parsley 
fine. Return them to the liquor, heat the 
fish in it, and serve it in a deep dish accompa- 
nied by thin slices of brown bread and butter. 

THE BRILL. 

A large brill is with difficulty to be distin- 
guished from a small turbot when very well 
cooked. It is longer and not so round, 

111 season from August to April. 

Brill. 

Time, ten to twenty minutes. 

68. One brill ; four ounces of salt to each 
gallon of water ; a tablespoonful of vinegar. 

Thoroughly clean and remove the scales 
from a fine fresh brill ; do not cut off the 
fins, but rub itover wi!h the juice of a lemon 
and a httle salt ; set it in a fish-kettle with 
sufficient cold water, a handful of salt, and 
a tablespoonful of vinegar to cover it ; let it 
gradually boil, and then simmer for ten or 
twenty minutes, according to the size of the 
fish. Skim it well, as great care is required 
to preserve the beauty of its colour. Serve 
it on a napkin, and garnish with lemon, 
curled parsley, and horseradish ; send it to 
able with lofjster-sauce in a tureea 



JOHN DORY. 

A fish much esteemed by epicures, and, 
unlike all other table-fish, extremely ugly. 
It should be quite a foot long, and about 
four or five pounds in weight, and eaten very 
fresh. The thickest fish are the best. 

To Boil the Jolin Dory, 
rime, three-quarters of an hour. 

69. Four ounces of salt ; one gallon of 
water. 

Prepare the fish as you do a turbot. Put 
it into a fish-kettle with sufficient water to 
cover it, with the salt in proportion to the 
quantity of water ; bring it to the boil, and 
let it simmer gradually for about three-quar- 
ters of an hour — more or less according to 
the size of your fish. Serve it in a neatly- 
folded napkin, and garnish with curled 
parsley and slices of lemon alternately. Lob- 
ster-sauce, shrimp-sauce, or plain nie'.tcd 
butter can be sent to table in a tureen, 

FRESHWATER BREAM. 

A flat fish, very delicate, but seldom sent 
to table. 

To Bake Sea Bream. 
Time, forty minutes. 

70. One sea bream ; some veal-stuffing ; 
a quarter of a pound of butter ; a little 
pepper, salt, and Cayenne. 

Thoroughly wash and wipe the bream in 
a cloth, but none of the scales must be re- 
moved. Rub over and inside a little pepper, 
salt, and Cayenne ; stuff it with veal stuff- 
ing, sew it up, and place it in a baking-dish 
witli pieces of butter over it. Put it in a 
moderate oven for about forty minutes, and 
serve ; or it may be broiled, and served with 
white sauce. 

SALMON. 

Salmon is the king of fish, and is wel- 
come at every table. 

Salmon, like all other fish, should be stiff, 
and red in the gills ; the flesh should be of 
a bright full colour, and the, scales bright 
and silvery. Good judges prefer those which 
are small in the head, and thick in the neck. 
Before dressing the fish, scale it carefully, 
and cleanse it thoroughly. For the last 
named process, scrape away the blood and 
impurities with a knife, using washing as 
little as possible. 

It is the present fashion to dress saloion 
as fresh as possible ; but it is not really hurt, 
nay, is far more wholesome, if kept two or 
three days before it is cooked. ISIost pro- 
bably this is the case with the fish we buy at 
the fishmonger's. Salmon, when out ol 



S.r/mon. 



season, has scarlet, purple, and blue spots 
on its sides ; when in season, the salmon 
should be a silvery, pinkish grey. 

Boiled Salmon- 
Time, according to weight. 

71, One salmon ; four ounces of salt to 
one gallon of water. 

Salmon is put into warm water instead of 
cold, in order to preserve its colour and set 
tlie curd. It should be thoroughly well 
dressed to be wholesome. 

Scale it ; empty and wash it with the 
greatest care. Do not leave any blood in 
ilie inside that you can remove. 

Boil tlie salt rapidly in the fish-kettle for 
a minute or two, taking off the scum as it 
rises ; put in the salmon, first trussing it in 
the shape of the letter S, and let it boil 
gently till it is thoroughly done. Take it 
from the water on the fish-plate, let it drain, 
put it on a hot folded fish-napkin, and gar- 
nish with slices of lemon. Sauce : shrimp 
or lobster. 

Send up dressed cucumber with salmon. 

Middle Slice of Salmon- 
Time, ten minutes to the pound. 

72. Middle piece or slice. 

Boil slowly in salt and water. Salmon 
should be put into warm water, which makes 
it eat firmer. Boil gently. Serve on a 
napkin. Sauce : lobster, shrimp, or plain 
melted butter and parsley. 

Boudin de Satimon- Salmon Padding. 
Time, one hour. 

73. One slice of salmon ; an equal weight 
of butter ; two eggs, or according to the 
weight of the shoe — enough to prevent it 
from breaking ; one salt-spoonful of Cay- 
enne ; one of salt. 

Take a slice of salmon of the weight you 
require, pound it well in a mortar, and pass 
it through a sieve ; make it up into a ball. 
Pound up with it again an equal weight of 
butter. MLx with the panade sufficient eggs 
to prevent it from breaking ; season with 
salt and Cayenne. Put it into a pudding- 
mould, and steam it for an hour. Make a 
good Bechamel sauce, add a little essence of 
anchovies, and serve round it. 

Broiled Salmon- 
Time, ten to fifteen minutes. 

74. Slices from the middle of a salmon ; 
C!ie tablespoonful of flour; a sheet or two of 
oiied letter-paper ; a little Cayenne pepijcr. 

Cut slices of an inch or an inch and a hall 
thick from the middle of a large salmon ; 



dust a little Cayenne pepper over them ; 
wrap them in oiled or buttered paper, and 
broil them over a clear fire, first nibbing 
the bars of the gridiron with suet. 

Broiled salmon is extremely rich, and 
really requires no sauce ; nevertheless, one 
especially intended for it will be found 
amidst the sauces. 

'I'he slices may also be simply dried in a 
cloth, floured, and broiled over a clear fire ; 
but they require the greatest care then to 
prevent them from burning. The gridiron 
is always rubbed with suet first. 

Grilled Salmon Cutlets- 
Time, eight to ten minutes. 

75. Two or three slices of salmon ; some 
caper, tomato, or brown butter sauce ; a 
little pepper and salt. 

Cut two or three slices of salmon about 
an inch thick ; rub a little oil or butter over 
them, and a dust of pepper and salt. Put 
them on a gridiron over a very clear fire ; 
turn them occasionally until done, rubbing 
a little butter over them each time they are 
turned. When quite dressed, place them 
on a hot dish, and pour over them caper^ 
tomato, or brown butter sauce. 

Fillets of Salmon- 
Time, fifteen minutes. 

76. Some fillets of salmon ; ^gg ; and 
bread-crumbs. 

Cut about a pound and a half or two 
pounds of salmon, into small fillets, re- 
moving them from the bone with a shaip 
knife ; carefully take away all the skin ; dip 
each fillet into a well beaten egg, then into 
bread-crumbs, and fry them a light colour in 
some boiling dripping or lard. Dish them 
up, and pour over them seme Indian sauce. 

Fried Salmon. 
Time, twenty minutes. 

"jj. Half a pint of salad oil ; one tgg. 

Cut slices of salmon, sprinkle them with 
salt, and let them lie for a quarter of an 
hour ; flour them, brush them over with 
yolk of &gg, well beaten up, and fry them 
in boiling salad oil. 'I'he salmon is nice 
either hot or cold, and will keep good fur 
many days. 

Cold Salmon. 
Salmon is too good a fish, and too well 
appreciated in most houses, for that which is 
left after the first meal at which a fine one 
makes its appearance, to receive no further 
consideration. Perhaps there is no better 
v/ay of catin;i <^;<1 salmon tlian simply with 



5^ 



CcJ.^Snn Fis/i. 



a little salt and Cayenne, and well cut brown 
or white bread and butter. It makes a 
recherche dish for breakfast, luncheon, or 
croquet teas. 

Home-made Pickled Salmon. 
Time, about ten minutes ; one day to pickle. 

78. Equal parts of vinegar, and the liquor 
the fish was boiled in ; one teaspoonful of 
pepper ; one saltspoonful of salt ; a little 
allspice. 

Place the remains of cold salmon in a 
dish. Boil up together the vinegar, the 
liquor, and seasoning ; then let it get cool. 
Pour it over the fish ; keep it for a day. 

Send it to table garnished with fresh 
fennel, 

THE COD. 

There is not a more useful, nourishing, or 
wholesome fish brought to our market than 
tlie cod. It is in tl>e greatest perfection 
from October to Christmas. It may be 
bought nearly all the year round, but from 
February to July it is not so good as at other 
times. The ling is even larger than the cod, 
but inferior to it in quality. I'he hake is a 
capital fish, it frequents our south-western 
coast ; it should be all day sprinkled with 
salt before it is eaten ; and it will turn out 
good dressed in any way that does well for 
cod ; but the head is less available as food 
than that of the cod ; being long and lean. 
Haddock and whiting are excellent fish ; 
they cannot be eaten too fresh. 

Cod should have a small head and a thick 
neck. It is better dressed in slices than 
boiled whole. It should possess a flavour 
of oysters. It should be put into cold water 
when cooked. 

Cod's Head and Shoulders. 
Time, half an hour or more. 

79. Cod's head and shoulders ; four 
ounces of salt to each gallon of water; a 
little horseradish. 

Rub a little salt down the bone and the 
thick part of the fish, and tie a fold or two 
of wide tape round it, to prevent its break- 
ing. Lay it in a fish kettle with sufficient 
cold water to cover it, with salt in the above 
proportion ; add three spoonfuls of vinegar, 
and a little horseradish. Let the water be 
brought just to the point of boiling ; then 
draw the fish-kettle to the side of the fire, to 
simmer gently till the fish is done ; which 
can be ascertained by trying it with a fish 
slice, to see if the meat can be separated 
easily from the bone : skim it well and care- 
fully. Wb.en done, drain it and slip it off 
the fish strainer on a napkin neatly loldcd in 



a dish. Garnish with double parsley, 
lemon, and the roe and liver of the cod. 

Browned Cod's Head. 

Time, according to size, half an hour more 

or less. 

80. Cod's head ; butter ; flour ; bread- 
crumbs. 

Boil the head, and take it up ; take off the 
skin ; set it before a brisk fire ; dredge it 
with flour, and baste it with butter. When 
it begins to froth, sprinkle fine bread-crumbs 
over it ; and continue basting it until it is 
well frothed, and of a fine light brown, and 
serve it. Garnish with slices of lemon, and 
sauce to taste. 

It is a great mistake to use small fried fish 
as a garnish to boiled fish, as the appear- 
ance, and flavour too, of the one must be 
spoiled by the steam from the other. 

Crimped Cod. 
Time, fifteen minutes.- 

8r. One pound and a half of crimped cod, 
and a large handful of salt. 

Take a pound and a half of crimped cod, 
cut it into slices, put it into a fish-kettle of 
boiling water, with a large handful of salt, 
and let it boil over a slow fire very gently 
for rather more than a quarter of an hour. 
Boil the liver, cut it into slices, and .add it as 
a garnish to the cod, with tufts of double 
parsley. Serve it witli oyster sauce in a 
tureen. 

Picked Cod. 
Time, fifteen minutes. 

, 82. About one pound and a half of dressed 
cod ; a little oyster and egg sauce ; two 
hard-boikd eggs ; and four parsnips, or 
some mashed potatoes. 

Pick about a pound and a half of dressed 
cod-fish into flalces, and put it in layers, 
with a little oyster and egg sauce alter- 
nately, in a stew-pan. Make it thoroughly 
hot. When it is done, pile it in the centre 
of a dish, and serve with mashed potatoes 
in a wall round it, browned with a salaman- 
der ; or garnish it with slices of hard-boiled 
eggs, and parsnips cut into shapes. 

SALT FISH. 
Salt fish with a black skin are best. Fol- 
low the instructions given previously as to 
soaking it all night in water. . 

Salt Fish. 

Time, one hour. 

83. Put the cod in water the night before 
it is wanted, and let it soak all night ; boil 



Coct Soi/uJs, 



57 



it ; lay it in a dish ; separate the flakes ; 
pour egg sauce over it, and sent it up hot. 

If it be preferred, instead of tlie egg 
sauce, boil parsnips quite tender, tnashthuiu 
with biitter, cream or milk, and spread them 
round the salt fish. 

If the cod be very dry, soak it for several 
liours, lay it out to dry in a cold place, and 
tlien soak it again for a number of hours. 
This double soaking is said to soften the 
driest fish. 

Salt Fisli the Second Eay. 
Time, twenty minutes. 

84. The remains of salt fish previously 
dressed ; same quantity of mashed potatoes 
and parsnips ; a quarter of a pound of 
butter ; a iii^Ie Cayenne ; one egg. 

Pick the remains of tlie fish into small 
flakes ; butter the bottom of a pic-dish, 
place it in alternate layers with the mashed 
parsnips and potatoes ; sprinkle a little Cay- 
enne in the dish. Bake for about twenty 
minutes in the oven ; turn it out on a dish ; 
garnish with a hard-boiled egg cut in shces, 
and pour over it a little melted butter, or 
instead of the sliced egg, use egg sauce. 

Cod Sounds Boiled. 
Time, to boil, half an hour. 

85. Cod sounds ; half a pint of milk. 
Soak the cod sounds in warrn water half 

an hour, then scrape and clean them ; boil 
them in milk and water until tender ; when 
done. Serve them in a napkin w ith egg sauce. 
The salt must not be soaked out of the 
sounds, unless for fricassee. 

A Eecherclie Eish of Cod Sounds. 
Time, one hour. 

86. Cod sounds ; forcen^.cat of oysters ; 
bread-crumbs ; butter ; yolk of egg ; and 
pepper, salt, and nutmeg ; lardoons of pork 
or bacon ; butter, and flour. 

Boil some cod sounds until they are ten- 
der, but not too much done ; turn them out 
and let them stand until they are cold. 
Make forcemeat of chopped oysters, bread- 
cmmbs, butter, yolk of egg, and seasoning 
of pepper, salt, and grated nutmeg. Fill 
the sounds with the forcemeat, roll them up 
and skewer them, and lard down each side 
of each roll with pork or bacon ; dredge 
them with flour ; put tliem into a Dutch 
oven before the fire ; biiste them with butter 
until they are nicely browned, and serve 
them with oyster sauce over them. 

Broiled Cod Sounds. 
Time, three-quarters of an hour. 
87. Lay the cod sounds for a few minutes 



in hot water, rub them with a little salt, 
clean them until they look white, and give 
them a gentle boil. Take them up, dry 
them, flour them, sprinkle salt and j^eppet 
over them, and broil them. Serve them 
with melted butter and nmstard, or what 
ever sauce may be preferred. 

To Broil Cod Sounds. 
Time, three-quarters of an hour. 

88. Two cod sounds ; half a pint of brown 
gravy ; a teaspoonful of soy ; a little pepper, 
salt, and mustard. 

Scald the sounds in hot water, rub them 
well with salt, pull off the skin, and put them 
to simmer till tender ; take them out of the 
pan, flour, and broil them a nice brown. 
While this is being done, season half a pint 
of brown gravy with pepper, salt, a tea- 
spoonful of soy, and a very little mustard. 
Boil it with a piece of butter rolled in flour, 
pour it over the sounds, and serve hot. 

To Bake a Cod, 
Time, one hour and ten minutes. 

89. A small codfish ; a bunch of sweet 
herbs ; a quart of water ; some bread-crumbs; 
a pint of shrimps ; three dozen oysters ; two 
tablespoonfuls of Harvey sauce ; one ounce 
of essence of anchovies ; three ounces of 
butter, and a little pepper and salt. 

Well butter a dish, lay in the cod with a 
quart of water, a bunch of sweet herbs, and 
some pepper and salt ; dredge the fish with 
a little flour, put over it the grated crumbs, 
and about two ounces of butter cut into 
small pieces. Put it into the oven and bake 
it for an hour, or until sufficiently done. 
Then take the cod carefully out ; strain the 
gravy through a sieve, thicken it with an 
ounce of butter and a spoonful of flour ; add 
a pint of picked shrimps, three dozen oysters, 
two tablespoonfuls of sauce, and a little 
essence of anchovies. Let it boil once, pour 
it round the cod, and garnish with lemoii 
and paisley. 

Cold Cod. 

There are many ways of utilizing any re- 
mains of fine cod that there may be after the 
day it is cooked. Divided into flakes, and 
nicely seasoned with pepper, salt, and fra- 
grant herbs, it will make a good Mayon- 
naise for supper or luncheon. Similarly di- 
vided into flakes, and mixed into a good 
salad, it is no bad substitute for lobster 
salad, and it makes capital rissoles. For 
another rifacimento separate the flakes of 
the cold fish, stir it into rich new milk, 
cream, or thin rich melted butter, arrange 
it in a iiie-disli, spread mashed potatoes

over it, and put it in an oven until the top is 
nicely browned. 

Cold cod's head and shoulders may be 
made very nice and appt-'tissant. Place it 
in a deep dish, the chief bones of the head 
in the middle, and the flakes of flesh there 
may be, round. Take the liquor under the 
fish-plate, in the dish in which the fish has 
been served, and add to it liquor from the 
fish-kettle to make enough. Flavour this 
with ketchup, lemon pickle, Harvey's or 
odier sauce, tomatoes, or any flavouring 
that may be preferred. Thicken it a little, 
cover it down close with a dish or close- 
fitting cover, and put it in the oven for half 
or three-quarters of an hour, according to 
the size of the dish and the heat of the oven. 

HAKE. 

A common west-country fish, much eaten 
on the coast of Devonshire. 

It cannot be cooked too fresh, though 
some persons keep it in salt for twelve hours 
before they dress it. 

It should be stuffed and baked as had- 
dock. It is sometimes sold by the itinerant 
fishmongers round London as "White 
Salmon!" 

Baked Hake. 
Time, varying with size. 
In season from May to August. 

90. Be very careful in cleaning your hake, 
then stuff it with veal stuffing, sew it up 
with packthread, egg and bread-crumb it 
over, set it in a baking dish, and put it into 
a hot oven. Let it bake till the fish parts 
easily from the bones. It is impossible to 
fix a time, unless the size of the fish were 
stated. 

Hake Cutlets; 

91. Cutlets of hake ; egg ; bread-crumbs. 
Cut a moderate-sized hake into cutlets,

longer time should your fish be large. Dish 
them on a folded napkin, and garnish with 
bunches of double parsley. Serve with an- 
chovy sauce, or plain melted butter. 

MULLET. 

Red mullet is a very delicate fish, and has 
been justly called the woodcock of the seas. 
They are in season when the roe is just form- 
ing. Red mullet are better than grey ; tiiey 
should be very red, rather short and firm to 
the touch. Take care how you clean them. 
It is sufficient to scrape them lightly and 
pull out the gills, v/ith them all the insitlf 
necessary to be removed will come alsr

of dressing such fish as whitings, &c. ; if 
large, it may be cooked as cod or salmon. . 

TROUT. 

There are three kinds of trout : the com- 
mon trout, the white, and the salt water or 
sea trout. White trout is never very large ; 
sea trout is less, and has an excellent flavour. 
It is as beautiful a fish as the red mullet. 
Clean them as you do salmon.

Sinro^-con and Halibut. 



When you have thoroughly cleaned your 
fish, wipe it diy in a cloth, and tie it round 
with thread to preserve its shape entire. 
Then melt the butter with one tablespoonful 
of salt, and pour it over the trout till it is 
perfectly covered ; let it remain for two or 
three minutes, take it out, and put it on a 
gridiron over a clear fire, that it may do 
gradually. When done, lay it in a dish, 
and pour over it the sauce previously made, 
with an anchovy washed, boned, and cut up 
very small, a large spoonful of chopped 
capers, a little pepper, salt, and nutmeg, 
half a spoonful of vinegar, and some melted 
butter. Boil it up for a few minutes and 
pour it over your fish. 

ETUEGEON 

Sturgeon is so rare and expensive a fish 
that it seems useless to give directions for 
dressing it in an ordinary Cookery Book ; 
but as no cook can foresee what may fall into 
her hands to dress, we will not leave her the 
helpless possessor of a sturgeon — the Queen's 
very own fish. For every sturgeon caught 
in the English rivers is Her Majesty's born 
vassal, and belongs to her, except those 
wliich swim in the Thames belnw Temjile 
Ear, which belong to the civic chief, the 
Lord Mayor. 

The sturgeon is as large as a shark, but 
has no teeth. It is a very delicious fish, and 
mny be cooked like veal. 

To Ecast Shurgeon. 

Time, three-quarters of an hour to one 

hour. 

103. The tail end of a sturgeon ; some 
veal stuffing ; a glass of white wine ; juice 
of a lemon ; a cupful of beef gravy. 

'fake the tail end of a fine sturgeon, skin 
and bone it ; wash it clean, and fill the part 
from which the bone has been removed 
with veal stuffing, roll it in buttered paper, 
and tie it round to resemble a fillet of veal. 
Roast it in a Dutch oven before the fire, 
baste it constantly with butter, place it on a 
hot disJi, and serve it with a cupful of rich 
beef gravy, a little lemon juice, and a wine- 
glass of white wine, previously made hot. 
Four the sauce round the sturgeon. 

Sttirgeon Cutlets- 
Time, ten to fifteen minutes. 

104. One Qgg ; a few bread-crumbs ; pep- 
per ; salt ; thyme and parsley.

a well beaten egg ; cover them with bread- 
crumbs, pi;pper, salt, and a little tlij-me and 



parsley chopped very fine ; fry them a nice 
brown, and serve them with piquante 
sauce.

with two anchovies chopped up, a piece of 
onion, and of lemon peel, with a cupful of 
good broth. Thicken it with a piece of 
butter rolled in flour. Stir in two or three 
spoonfuls of cream, and eitlier pour the 
sauce over the fish or serve it in a tuiccn.

_ Cut a piece of sturgeon into nice sized 
pieces, dip them into vinegar, dry them, flour 
them, and broil them over a clear fire. Flour 
them again, arrange them in a stewpan of 
appropriate size, and put in enough good 
broth to cover them. Let them stew until 
they are done and the gravy diminished. 
Thicken the gravy with cream, or a piece of 
butter rolled in P.our ; stir in a tablespoon- 
ful of Harvey s sauce, and a glass of wine. 
Serve it in the gravy, garnished with slices 
of lemon, and with capers strewed over it. 

HALIBUT. 

Halibut is a flat fish of enormous size, 
being sometimes five or six feet long, and 
weighing from four to fiv'c hundred pounds. 
Being so large, it is of course sold in pieces. 
A fine piece can be boiled like cod or any 
other fish, and served with any sauce usually 
eaten with boiled fish. Nicely cut collops 
can be covered with egg and bread-crumbs 
and fried.

THE BASSE. 

The basse is a fish of a beautiful silver}' 
'appearance, which is very popular in some 
(lOcaUties. It has been called the white sal- 
mon, a fish that it rather resembles in form, 
[and in the firmness of the flesh. It is not 
very abundant in the London fish-shops. In 
the Channel Islands it is often plentiful in 
its season, but never, I believe, very cheap, 
and it abounds along our South coast, in 
St. George's and the Bristol Channel, and 
■on different parts of the Irish coast. 

It is frequently eaten simply boiled, and 
the remarks made on boiling salmon will 
apply equally well to it, proportioning the 
time allowed to tb.e size of the fish. Fish 
weighing as much as fifteen pounds have 
occasionally been caucjht, but they are usu- 
ally much smaller. Basse cut in slices may 
be boiled, filed, or fiicassecd, following the 
plan given for dressing salmon in these 
various ways. It may be collared like sal- 
mon, or, if small, cut open and fried, with 
bread-crumbs, seasoning, and minced herbs, 
following the directions given hereafter for 
frying mackerel. 

They are good dressed ait court bouillon 
dean, with a little white wine. They are 
served on a napkin. 

Basse Dressed en Casserole. 
Time, six minutes to the pound. 
109. Basse : a piece of butter rolled in 
flour ; a few sweet herbs ; pepper, salt, and 
grated nutmeg ; juice of Iialf a lemon. 



After the fish is properly cleaned and pre- 
pared, fill the inside with butter well worked 
up with flour, sweet herbs minced fine, and 
seasoned with, pepper, salt, and grated nut- 
meg. Stew it with just liquid enough to 
prevent its burning, and squeeze lemon iuice 
over it when it is taken up. 

WHITEBAIT. 

Time, one minute. 

In season, May, June, and July. 

iTO. Wash and drain them in a c<jlander, 
flour them well, and sift fine bread cnimbs 
over them ; fry them in hot lard. As soon 
as they rise, take them out ; that will be in 
about one minute. 

If you possess a wire basket, it is better 
to cook them in it instead of the pan. 

Serve them very hot, on a fish cloth, 
sprinkUng first a little salt over them. 

GRAYLING. 

In season, July and August. 

Grayling may be either baked or Ixoilcd. 
If small, they should be cut at the back, 
rubbed with butter, and a little pepper and 
salt dusted over them, then placed on a grid- 
iron over a clear fire for four or five minutes 
to broil, and served on a dish, head and tail 
together, with the juice of a lemon squeezed 
over them. 

To Fry 6raylin»3. 
Time, five minutes. 
III. Scale, gut, and well wash thetrl, 
dust some flour over them, lay them sepa- 
rately on a board before the fire ; fry the in 
of a delicate brown in fresh dripping. 

Serve garnished with crimped isarsley. 
Sauce : plain melted butter. 

CAEP. 

Carp should be of a medium size, with a 
soft roe. The gills, if fresh, will be very 
hard to pull out. Take off the scales, and 
lay the fish for an hour before you dress it in 
water, to get rid of the blood, then dry it on 
a cloth. 

Baked Carp. 
Time, one hour and a quarter. 

In season from March to October. 

ir2. One large carp ; forcemeat ; egg ; 
bread-crumbs ; a little butter, one pint of

crumbs, then drop some oiled butter over it. 
Place the carp in a deep earthen dish, with 
a pint of stock, two onions sliced, two bay- 
kaves, a bunch of herbs, half a pint of port 
wine and six anchovies ; cover the pan, and 
bake it one hour. Put a good-sized piece 
of butter into a stewpan with a dust of flour ; 
when melted, pour in the strained liquor 
from the carp, with a teaspoonful of mustard, 
one of soy, and a little salt and Cayenne ; 
boil it up again, and serve the fish on a dish, 
garnished with slices of 1-cmon and bunches 
of parsley, and the sauce in a boat. 

Fried Carp.

brown ; lay them on a cloth to drain, and 
fry some three-cornered pieces of bread and 
the roes. Serve the carp with the roes on 
each side of the dish ; garnish it with the 
fried bread and lemon in slices, and make 
anchovy sauce, with the juice of a lemon 
added, to eat with it. 

Carp au Bleu. 

Time, one hour or more. 

114. Carp : half a bottle of vinegar ; port 
wine ; three onions ; two carrots ; a sprig or 
two of parsley ; two or three laurel or bay 
leaves ; a bunch of thyme ; three cloves ; 
pepper and salt. 

Clean the carp well, but in doing so make 
as small an opening as possible ; tie up the 
nc.id, place the fish in a fish kettle of the 
right size, and pour over it half a bottle of 
boiling vinegar, and add enough port wine 
for the carp to be covered with the liquid. Put 
in three onions in slices, two carrots, a sprig 
of parsley, a bunch of thyme, two or three 
laurel or bay-leaves, three cloves, pepper, 
and salt ; put it over a slow fire, and let it 
simmer gently for about an hour (more or 
less, according to the size of the carp) ; take 
it from the fire, let it get cold in the liquor, 
and serve it upon a folded napkin. 

Any fish can be dressed au bleu from the 
same receipt. 

Carpe Frite. 

Time, twelve or fifteen minutes. 

113. A small soft-roed carp ; lemon juice ; 
flour. 



Choose a small soft-roed carp, open it

pan, and fry them of a fine colour. Serve 
them with lemon juice squeezed over them. 

To Boil Carp. 

Tim.e, thirty minutes. 

116. Scale and remove the gills from the 
carp, and rub some salt down the backbone, 
then lay it for half an hour in strong salt and 
water, which will thoroughly cleanse it ; dry 
it, and place it in a fish-kettle of boiling- 
water, with a tablespoonful of salt. Boil it 
for thirty minutes, or less time should it be 
small ; boil the roe with it, and when done 
serve it on a napkin. Garnish with parsley 
and slices of lemon. Plain melted butter 
and fish sauces must be served with it. 

Stewed Carp. 

Time, one hour and a quarter. 

117. A carp; equal parts of port wine 
and water ; a tablespoonful of lemon pickle ; 
one of browning ; one teaspoonful of mush- 
room powder ; one onion ; six cloves ; one 
stick of horseradish ; some Cayenne ; a large 
lump of butter ; a little^ flour ; juice of one 
lemon. 

Having scaled, cleaned, and taken out the 
gills, wash it thoroughly, by soaking it in 
spring water for half an hour, and dry it in 
a cloth ; dredge over it a little flour, and fry 
it a hght brown. Then put it into a stew- 
pan with half a pint of port wine, and the 
same of water (or more if desired) ; a table- 
spoonful of lemon pickle, another of brown- 
ing, a teaspoonful of mushroom powder, an 
onion stuck with six cloves, a stick of horse- 
radish, and a little Cayenne pepper. Cover 
your stewpan closely, that the steam may 
not escape, and let it stew gently over a slow 
fire until the gravy is reduced to just enough 
to cover the fish. Then take it out, and put 
it into the dish it is to be served in. Set the 
gravy again on the fire, and thicken it with 
a lump of butter rolled in flour ; boil it up, 
and then strain it over your fish, and garnish 
with sippets. 

Just before you send it to table, squeeze 
into the sauce the juice of a lemon.

cloves ; a bit of horse- radish. 

Clean and dry the fish : place them before 
the fire for a few minutes, dredge them with 
flour, and brown them in a frying-pan. Put 
them in a stewpan, cover them with red wine 
and water in equal parts ; add the lemon 
pickle, browning, walnut ketchup, mushroom 
powder, Cayenne pepper to taste, an onion 
stuck with clos-es, and a piece of horse- 
radish. 

Cover the stewpan close to keep in the 
steam, and letithe fish stew gently over a 
slow fire until the liquor is reduced to barely 
enough to cover the fish in the dish. Take 
out the fish, keep them hot, thicken the 
gravy with a lump of butter rolled in flour, 
boil it up, strain it over the fish, garnish 
with pickled mushrooms and scraped horse- 
radish. 

Either of these receipts for stewing tench 
{i.e., brown and White) will do also for carp, 
observing always to save and add the blood. 
Garnish with fried o\sters, sippets of toasted 
bread, slices of lemon, or scraped horse- 
radish, according to taste ; or with the roe

with oil, parsley, thyme, onion, and shallot 
minced fine, fait, and pepper. Fold them 
in two thicknesses of paper dipped in the 
oil, &c., in which the fish have been lying, 
and broil them. When they are done, take 
off the writing paper, pour over them sauce 
piquante, or caper sauce, and serve them. 

This is a famous receipt at Brussels, 



PLAICE. 

Plaice are rather common fish, and lack 
the delicacy and flavour of the other pisca- 
tory delicacies of our table ; hxnif.llcted they 
are veiy nice, and supply the place of better 
very well, if carefully dressed. 

In season from May to January. 

To Fillet Plaico. 
Time, about twelve minutes. 

121. Skin them, lay them flat on the table, 
and cut right down the backbone, then raise 
the fillet from head to tail. Having quite 
removed the fillets from the bones, cut them 
nicely in pieces, and fry them in two ounces 
of dripping or lard, with a little pepper and 
salt, and the juice of half a lemon. 

Drain them on a cloth to absorb the grease, 
and serve them upon a hot white table-nap- 
kin. 

To Boil Plaice or Flounders. 
Time, si.K to seven minutes. 

Flounders are in season from September 
to November. 

122. A quarter of a pound of salt to a 
gallon of water, and a very little saltpetre. 

Well clean and empty your fish, draw a 
sharp knife down the thickest part of the 
middle of the back, nearly through to the 
bone ; lay them in a fish-kettle of cold water, 
with salt in the above proportion, with a 
small piece of saltpetre ; let them simmer 
for si.x or seven minutes after the water be- 
gins to boil, or longer should your fish be 
very large, taking great care they are not 
broken. Sei-vethem (with plain melted butter) 
on a folded naokin. 

To Fry Plaice or Flounders. 
Time, five minutes. 

123. Two tablespoonfuls of vinegar ; an 
egg ; bread crumbs ; fried parsley ; and some 
anchovy sauce. 

Sprinkle the plaice or flounders with salt, 
and let them lie for twenty-four hours, then 
\yash them and wipe them dry ; brush them 
over with ^gg, and cover them with bread- 
crumbs ; make some lard or dripping mi.xed 
with two tablespoonfuls of vinegar boiling 
hot in a frying-pan ; lay the fish in, and fry 
them a nice brown colour, drain them from 
the fat on a cloth, and serve them on a folded 
napkin, gsirnished with fried paisley. An- 
chovy sauce. 

SMELTS. 
A delicate little fish which has a singular 
perfume of violets or syringa. It requires 
great care in cleaning. Pull the gills out,

Smelts and Soles. 



and tlie inside will come with them. Wipe 
and dry them gently. 

In season from October to May. 

To Try Smelts- 
Time, three or four minutes. 

124. Seven smelts ; two eggs ; bread- 
crumbs ; a little flour, and a piece of butter. 

Sinelts should not be washed more than is 
necessary to just clean them ; cut o/f the 
fms, dry them in a cloth, and dredge a little 
flour over them, melt half an ounce of but- 
ter and beat into it the yolks of two eggs. 
Dip the smelts into it, then into bread-crumbs 
finely grated, and plunge them into a frying- 
pan of boiling fat ; let them fry gently, and 
a few minutes will make them of a bright 
yellow brown. Be careful not to take <j?i 
the light roughness of the crumbs, or their 
beauty will be lost. When done, dish them 
up on a napkin, garnish with fried i^arsley, 
and serve anchovy or slirimp sauce with them 
separately. 

Fried Smelts, French Way. 
Time, three or four minutes. 

125. Smelts ; a little flour ; milk ; crisped 
parsley. 

After the smelts are prepared and dried 
dip them into milk, dredge them with flour, 
atid fry them until they are of a fine colour, 
and serve them with crisped parsley. 

BPRATS- 

Time, two or three minutes. 

126. Well clean a number of sprats, fasten 
them in rows by a skewer run through their 
gills, place them on a close-barred gridiron, 
broil tlicm a nice brown and serve them hot 
and hot. 

SOLES. 

Soles are either white soles or black soles, 
according to the colour of their back. Middle 
■iized soles are of the best flavour. When 
they ha\e roes they should be only used for 
fillets, because they have then very little fla- 
vour. A large fine roe is not so great a re- 
tommendation to a sole as inexperienced 
housewives believe. 

In season from April to December. 

Filleted Soles. 
Tiine, ten minutes. 

127. Two soles ; two eggs ; and bread- 
ciumbs. 

Take two soles, divide them from the back- 
bone, and remove the head, fins, and tail. 
Sprinkle the inside with salt, roll them up 
irom the tail end upwards, and fasten them 
with very small skewers. If small or mid- 
dling sized soles, put half a fish in each roll. 



Dip them into the yolk of one well benter, 
cgQ, and then into bread-crumbs : then into 
the eggs a second time, and again sprinkle 
them with crumbs ; fry them in hot lard or 
in clarified butter. 

Instead of rolling the fish they may be cut 
into pieces, and arranged in the form of a 
pyramid in the centre of a dish, and gar 
nished with parsley and slices of lenion. 

Cutlets of Soles. 
Time, ten minutes. 

128. Two soles ; one egg; bread-crumbs, 
and parsley. 

Cut two soles into nfllTow pieces, cross- 
wise, dredge a little flour over them, dip 
each piece in an egg well beaten, and then 
into bread-crumbs ; fry them a nice brown 
in hot fat ; drain, and serve them with fried 
parsley in tlie centre, with the slices of sole 
raised round it. 

Boiled Soles. 
Time, eight to ten minutes. 

129. Two soles ; a large handful of salt in 
one gallon of water. 

Well wash and clean the soles, cut off the 
fins, and put them into a flsh-kettle with salt 
and water. Let them boil slowly, and then 
simmer imtil done, which must be according 
to the weight of the fish, a large one re- 
quiring about ten minutes, a meditun size 
eight. When done serve them on a napkin, 
with the white side uppermost. Garnish 
with slices of lemon and parsley. Anchovy 
or shrimp sauce are usually sent to table 
with boiled soles, but may be varied at plea- 
sure. 

Fried Soles. 
Time, eight minutes. 

130. Two soles ; one egg ; a few bread- 
crumbs. 

Remove the skin from the dark side of the 
soles, clenn them, and wipe them dry, and 
dredge a little flour over them ; brush them 
over with the yolk of a well-beaten eg^, dip 
them into bread-crumbs, and fiy them of a 
light brown, in sufficient boiling fat for them 
to swim in. When done, lay tliem on a 
cloth to absorb the grease ; dish them on a 
napkin neatly folded, and garnish with fried 
parsley. Plain melted butter or sh.rimp sauce 
may be sent to table with them. 

Fillets de Soles au Gratin- 
Time, according to size, about twenty 

minutes. 

131. Fillets of soles ; veal stuffing ; apiece 
of bread ; bread-crumbs. 

Divide each side of a fine sol" in iour 



Mode of Dressing Eels, 



65 



fil'ets ; spread veal stuffing on each piece, 
and roll it up ; spread a layer of the same 
stuffing over the bottom of a dish, three- 
quarters of an inch in thickness ; arrange 
the rolled fillets on it in the form of a crown ; 
fill up the interstices with the stuffing ; and 
place a piece of crumb of bread in the 
centre ; cover the fillets with bread-crumbs, 
and cook au gratin, or put the fish into an 
oven, or in a Dutch oven before the fire ; 
and when the sole is cooked enough, and 
the outside is a nice brov.n, serve it in the 
same dish. . 

EELS. 

It is one of the most painful tasks of the 
cook to kill and skin an eel, and it is effected 
with some difficulty. By striking the head 
very hard it may be stunned, however, and 
will then probably feel less pain. We be- 
lieve that there is also a mode of killing them 
by cutting through the vertebras near the 
head. 

Take a cloth in your hand ; hold the eel 
by the head ; cut the skin round the neck, 
and turn it a little way down ; then pull the 
head one way and the skin tlie other, and it 
will come off ; open the fish, take out the 
inside, being careful not to break the gall, 
and cut off the back bristles. 

Eels are in season all the year round. 

Eels Spitclicocked. 
Time, half an hour, or till the skin turns up. 

132. Two or three eels ; some chopped 
parsley ; pepper ; salt ; a little sage ; juice 
of half a lemon ; eggs, and bread-crumbs ; 
a little mace ; and a little warmed butter. 

Skin two or three large eels, open them on 
the belly side, and clean them thoroughly ; 
remove the backbone ; and cut them into 
pieces, three or four inches long ; strew over 
them, on both sides, some chopped parsley, 
a very little sage, pepper, salt, a little mace 
pounded fine, a little w^armed butter, and the 
juice of nearly half a lemon ; dip each piece 
carefully in egg and bread-crumbs ; fry them 
in a pan of boihng fat, and serve them on a 
hot dish, in a circular form, with piquante 
sauce {or any other you like) in the centre. 

Stewed Eels. 
Time, three-quarters of an hour. 

133. One gill of port wine ; half a pint of 
stock ; two blades of mace ; two bay-leaves ; 
a few allspice ; two cloves ; half a lemon ; 
one onion ; a bunch of thyme and parsley ; 
and some pepper and salt ; a teaspoonful of 
smchovy sauce, and one of ketchup. 

Take one or two large eels, skin and cut 



them into pieces about three or four inches 
in length ; put them into a stewpan with 
some stock, half a pint of port wine, two 
blades of mace, some allspice, two cloves, a 
bunch of herbs, a very small onion, half a 
lemon cut into slices, and some pepper and 
salt to your taste. Simmer over a slow fire 
for about three-quarters of an hour, or until 
the eels are done. Strain and thicken the 
gravy with a piece of butter, and a dust of 
flour, and stir in a teaspoonful of anchovy 
sauce, and one of ketchup. Serve the eels 
with their sauce over them. 

Baked Eels. 
Time, three-quarters of an hour. 

134. Four large eels ; some veal stock ; a 
bunch of savoury herbs ; a sprig of parsley ; 
two glasses of port wine ; juice of a small 
lemon ; salt and Cayenne ; one teaspoonful 
of Worcestershire sauce. 

Skin, empty, and thoroughly wash the 
eels, cut off the heads, and divide the fish into 
rather short pieces, wipe them very dry, dip 
each piece into a seasoning of Cayenne, salt, 
minced parsley, and a little powdered savoury 
herbs ; pour them into a deep dish, cover 
them with veal stock, put a thick paper or 
cover over the dish, and set it in the oven 
until the eels are tender. 

Skim off the fat, take the pieces of fish 
carefully out on a hot dish to keep warm, 
and stir into the gravy the wine, strained 
lemon juice, and sauce ; make it just boil 
up, and pour it over the fish. Garnish with 
sliced lemon. 

Boiled Eels. 
Time, half an hour 

135. Some small eels, and a little parsley 
and butter. 

'I'he small eels are the best ; do them in 
sufficient water to cover them, add a bunch 
of parsley, when tender they are done. 
Serve them up in a shallow tureen, with 
parsley and butter sauce poured over them. 

Fried Eels. 

Time, eighteen or twenty minutes. 

T36. One large eel, or two small ones ; 
one &gg, and a few bread-crumbs. 

Prepare and wash the eels, wipe them 
thoroughly dry, and dredge over them a very- 
little flour ; if large, cut them into pieces cf 
about four inches long, brush them over with 
egg, dip them into bread-crumbs, and fry 
tliem in hot fat. If small, they should be 
curled round and fried, being first dipped 
into egg and bread-crumbs. Serve them up 
garnished with fried parslev.

Lampreys. —Garfish.— The Conger. 



Baked Eels-Stuffed. 



Time, about three-quarters of an hour, 

137. Eels ; a forcemeat of shrimps or 
oysters; a slice of bread crumbled ; peel of 
half a lemon ; yolk of one egg ; pepper ; 
salt, and nutmeg ; two ounces of butter ; a 
little flour ; one teaspoonful of lemon pic- 
kle ; one tablespoonful of walnut ketchup ; 
a glass of white wine ; one anchovy ; two 
teaspoonfuls of browning ; a little lemon 
juice. 

Cut off the heads of the eels, and clean 
them very well ; make a forcemeat with 
shrimps or oysters chopped, a good slice of 
bread crumbled, a little lemon peel shred 
fine, the yolk of an egg, salt, pepper, and 
nutmeg. Stuff the eels with this, sew them 
up, and turn them round in a dish. Put 
butter and flour over them, pour a little 
water into the dish, and bake them in a 
moderate oven. When done enough, take 
the gravy from under them, skim off the 
fat, strain it, and add to it one teaspoonful 
of lemon pickle, the walnut ketchup, one 
anchovy, two spoonfuls of browning, and a 
squeeze of lemon juice. Let it boil ten 
minutes, thicken it with butter and flour, if 
necei^sary. and sei-ve it garnished with 
slices of lemon and crimped parsley. 

LAMPREYS. 

Rich but very ugly fish, unlikely to fall 
into the hands of an ordinary cook. They 
are a very ancient delicacy, and are remark- 
able as having tempted our first great Plan- 
tagenet King to his death by eating too 
much of tliem. The city of Gloucester still 
presents the Queen with a lamprey-pie every 
Christmas. 

To Stew lamprey as at Worcester. 
Time, one hour and twenty minutes. 

138. A small quantity of mace ; cloves ; 
nutmeg ; pepper and allspice, and an equal 
quantity of beef gravy, Madeira or sherry ; 
two anchovies ; a spoonful of made mus- 
tard ; juice of a lemon ; a little butter, and 
flour. 

Thoroughly cleanse, and remove the car- 
tilage which runs down the back of the fish, 
season it with pepper, mace, allspice, and 
cloves, and place it in a closely covered 
stewpan with equal quantities of good beef 
gravy and sherry, sufficient to cover it. 
When tender, take out the lamprey, and 
keep it hot. Boil the gravy it was stewed 
in with two anchovies chopped up very fine, 
and a lump of butter rolled in a little flour. 
Strain it through a hair sieve, and squeeze 



in the juice of a lemon, and a teaspoonful 
of made mustard. Serve it with sippets 
and horse-radish. 

Note. — Cider will answer in the place of 
the wine for common purposes. 

GAEFISII. 

The garfish, called " long noses" in some 
localities, are little appreciated by some on 
account of their green bones ; but ihey are 
said to be very nice when well cooked. 
They may be boiled and eaten with shrimp 
sauce, or boiled or fried. They may also be 
cooked according to the Worcester receipts 
for stewing lampreys, using good but not 
sweet home-made wine instead of Madeira ; 
and any of the French receipts for dressing 
eels may be used for the garfish. Perhaps 
they are best of all dressed by means of the 
bain-marie jar. 

139. Cut them in pieces and lay them in 
a dish, and put over them either vinegar, 
wine, or oil, with minced sweet herbs, pep- 
per, and salt, and any flavourtng that may 
be liked ; when they have lain an hour or 
two remove them, and the marinade in which 
they lie, to the bain-marie jar ; add a little 
to the liquor if it be thought that more 
gravy will be needed, fasten the lid down 
with a cloth, put the jar in a saucepan of 
water, and let the fish cook until it is done 
enough. 

THE CONGEE. 

The conger may with justice consider 
himself an ill-used fish, since, by many, he 
is condemned untried, and loaded with hard 
names, whicli are quite undeserved; whereas 
a good conger eel, well cooked, is more 
wholesome, more nutritious, and nicer than 
more recherchi xni more lauded viands. In 
addition to being very nice, and more 
wholesome than most other kinds of fish, it 
has the merit of great abundance in our 
seas ; and if the supply of our markets with 
it were encouraged by the free use of it by 
buj'ers (which it is not, on account of the 
unfounded prejudice against itl, we might 
have in it a fish as solid and as nutritious as 
butcher's meat, at from 2d. to 4d. a pound 
in our dearest markets. This noble fish is 
fully deserving of free use, and protection 
of the immature fish, as a thing of real im- 
portance ; the best substituie for meat 
that our seas give us. Let all who are an- 
xious to aid the country's need, by lessen- 
ing the consumption of meat in times of 
scarcity, give tlie conger a fair trial. At a 
•time wlien meat may reach famine prices, 
do not let us allow tons of nutritious fish to i 
be slighted, or worse, wasted. In tlic ways 
of dressing it we have great variety, as well 



Modes of Cooking the Conger.

as other gastronomic merits, and different 
parts of the fish are adapted for different 
purposes. The head and tail are t.^o best 
for soup, because the rich gelatinous pick- 
ing about the first gives thickness to the 
soup, and the tail is too bony to be as ap- 
propriate as the centre cuts to dress other 
ways. The portions next to the head ofter 
good cuts (the number dependent on the 
length and size of the fish) for stuffing, and 
either boiling or baking. The fat adhering 
to the bone (I believe, in truth, the roe of 
the fish), is very rich, yet delicate, and 
should on no account be removed when the 
fish is cleaned. In taking this out some 
London fishmongers commit a great mis- 
take. Still further on in the conger, may 
be cut compact slices and coUops for fry- 
ing, stewing, or fricasseeing, and for making 
into pies. A long piece, boned, cut from 
near the head to within half a foot of the 
tail, one side, or both, according to the 
size of the fish, is good for collaring, and 
the end near the tail may be salted for 
breakfast. 

Boiled Conger. 
Time, half an hour. 

140. White conger eel ; bread-crumbs ; 
peel of half a lemon ; a sprig of parsley ; 
lemon thyme ; winter savory ; sweec marjo- 
ram ; a piece of butter or dripping; pepper; 
salt ; nutmeg, and a spoonful of suet. 

Cut a piece about a foot long from the 
head end of a fine conger, make a stuffing of 
the bread-crumbs, minced parsley, lemon 
thyme, winter savory, and sweet marjoram 
minced fine ; a little chopped suet, grated 
lemon peel, and butter or dripping ; season 
it with pepper, salt, and nutmeg ; stuff the 
fish, and sew it up. Put it into warm wa- 
ter, let it simmer until it is cooked enough, 
and ser\e it with any sauce usually eaten 
with boiled fish. 

A thick piece will take half an hour after 
it simmers. It may be boiled without the 
stuffing, if it be preferred. 

Stewed Conger. 
Time, according to size. 

141. A conger eel : a bunch of sweet 
herbs ; one onion ; pepper, salt, and mace ; 
water or broth ; a little flour. 

Cut the conger into pieces as for frying, 
dry and flour the pieces, and brown them in 
a frying-pan. Put them into a stew-pan 
with a bunch of sweet herbs, an onion cut 
in quarters, seasoning of pepper and salt, 
and of spice, if it be liked, and enough 
water, or broth, nearly to cover the fish. L^t 
it Stew gently until it is cooked enough, 



thicken the gravy with flour just enough to 
take off the richness that may have risen to 
the top, and serve the conger with the gravy 
round it. 

The gravy may be flavoured with tomatoes, 
chutney, or any other sauce. The stewed 
conger is nice with oysters ; open them, and 
save the liquor, mix it with a little flour, use 
it to thicken the gravy, as much as neces- 
sary, let it just boil up, and put in the oys- 
ters long enough for them to get hot. 

Baked Conger. 
Time, one hour, less in a quick oven. 

142. Take such a piece of fine conger as 
would be chosen for boiling : make a stuff- 
ing, and stuff it as mentioned for boiled 
conger. Put it into a pie dish or a baking 
dish, with a pint of water, lay pieces of 
butter over the fish, flour it well, and put it 
into a moderate oven ; baste it often with 
the liquor while it is cooking, and when it 
is almost done thicken the liquor with flour, 
just enough to correct any little richness 
that may float on the top of it ; not more. 
Baked conger may be varied in many ways. 
It is very nice with potatoes baked under it: 
but as there must be liquor in the dish with 
which to baste the fish, to prevent the skin 
from,gettingdry and hard, they will not brown 
on the outside. The gravy may be thickened 
with tomatoes, or with tomato sauce, and 
this is particularly nice. It may be taken 
from the liquor, and eaten with dressed 
cucumber and early potatoes. It may be 
flavoured with or eaten with any sauce that 
is nice, and it will be excellent any way. A 
good flavouring for a change, is a table- 
spoonful of lemon pickle, the same of 
walnut ketchup, and a dessert spoonful of 
soy. 

Fried Conger. 

Time, twenty to twenty-five minutes, 

or longer. 

143. Conger ; egg ; bread-crumbs. 

Cut the conger into slices an inch and a 
half or two inches thick, or a little thicker, 
according to the size of the fish. This is 
the best way. to cut conger for fiying, and 
most other purposes for which it may require 
similar subdivision ; because by it the solid 
back of the fish and the richer under part 
go together, which they do not when collops 
are cut longitudinally. Cover the fish with 
egg and bread-crumbs, and fry it in plenty 
of fat, made to boil before the fish is put in. 
Take care that the frying-pan is perfectly 
clean, and that the fish is fried to a bright 
colour. Serve it with lemon to squeeze over 
it, plain melted butter, oyster sauce, shrimp 
sauce, or any sauce preferred.

Modes of Cooking Perch and Pike. 



PERCH. 

It is so difficult to scale perch that some 
people have them boiled with the scalfis on, 
as they come off easily afterwards. 

Clean it carefully. A perch weighs, when 
fine, from three to four pounds. 

To Boil Perch. 

Time, half an hour, if large. 
In season from September to November. 

144. Cut off the spines from the back, 
scrape off the scales with an oyster knife, 
and thoroughly clean and wash them. Then 
boil them in cold water veiy carefully, as 
they are a most delicate fish. 

Fried Perclu 

Time, twelve minutes. 

145. Some bread-crumbs, and egg. 
Thoroughly clean and scale the perdi, 

brush them over with a well beaten egg, dip 
them into bread -crambs, and fry them a 
nice brown in boiling fat. Serve them with 
anchovy sauce or melted butter. 

Fish Scallop. 

Time, twenty minuies. 

146. Cold fish ; a teacupful of milk or 
cream ; a large teaspoonful of anchovy 
sauce; a little pepper and salt ; a little made 
mustard ; a lump of butter ; some bread- 
crumbs. 

Pick any cold fish from the bones, 'mix 
with it a teacupful of milk or cream, a large 
teaspoonful of anchovy sauce, a little pepper 
and salt, and a saltspoonful of made mus- 
tard. Put it into a stewpan over a mode- 
rate fire for two or three minutes, stirring it 
all the time, then put it into scallop shells 
or a dish, strew some grated'bread thickly 
over it, and a few thin pieces of butter ; 
brown it in a Dutch oven before tlie fire, 
and serve it very hot. 

To Fry Perch Plain. 

Time, twelve minutes. 

147. When the perch are scaled, gutted, 
and washed, dry them well with a cloth, and 
lay them out singly before the fire for a 
few minutes. Flour them well, and fry 
them a fine brown in plenty of good drip- 
ping. Serve them with melted butter and 
prisped parsley. 

PIKE. 

This voracious river fish depends greatly 
upon the manner in wl)ich it is dressed. We 



have eaten 'excellent "Jacks," as they are 
called in the midland counties, and others 
quite undeserving of approbation. It ought 
always to be baked or roasted, and not 
boiled ; but as some families dress it in the 
latter manner, we give directions for it. 
The fins are usually cut off it, and it must 
be very carefully scraped and cleaned. 
In season from September to March. 

To Boil Pike. 

Time, half an hour to one hour. 

14S. Pike ; twelve oysters ; half of a 
French roll; two eggs; lemon; sweet herbs; 
pepper ; salt ; nutmeg ; a lump of butter ; 
a wineglass of vinegar. 

When you have taken out the gills, 
cleaned and thoroughly washed the fish, 
make a forcemeat of a dozen chopped oys- 
ters, the crumb of half, or a whole French 
roll, a little lemon peel shred fine, a lump of 
butter, a few sweet iherbs, the yolks of two 
well beaten eggs, seasoned to your taste 
with pepper, salt, and nutmeg. Mix all 
together and stuff the fish : sew it up, and 
fasten it with the tail in the mouth with a 
small skewer. Put it into a fish-kettle of 
boiling water with a wineglassful of vinegar 
and a tablespoonful of salt. If it is of a 
middling size, it will be done in about half 
an hour ; or, if large, one hour. Serve it 
up with melted butter and a lemon, or with 
anchovy sauce. Garnish with pickled bar- 
berries. 

To Bake Pike. 

Time, one hour. 

149. A large pike ; some forcemeat ; two 
or three anchovies ; half the peel of a lemon; 
one glass of wine ; one tablespoonful of 
sauce ; a spoonful of capers. 

Scale and wash a large pike, fill it well with 
stuffing made as for veal, skewer the tail in 
the mouth, and place it in a deep dish. 
Season it with salt. Put a good sized piece 
of butter over it, and bake it for one hour. 
When done, add to it about half a pint or 
more of the gravy, two or three small an- 
chovies chopped very fine, the rind of half a 
lemon, grated, a spoonful of capers, a large 
spoonful of sauce, either Worcester or Read- 
ing, a glass of wine, and a little butter rolled 
in flour to thicken it. Serve the fish on a 
dish, and the sauce in a boat. 

Stewed Pike. 
Time, three-quarters of an hour. 

150. Pike ; two ounces of butter ; a little 
flour; one pint of red wine; a bunch of 
sweet herbs ; four clove* ; twelve young 



Mackerel — Haddocks. 



69 



onions ; pepper and salt ; two anchovies ; 
one spoonful of capers. 

Brown butter and flour in the bottom of 
a stewpan ; and mix into it a pint of red 
wine; add a bunch of sweet herbs, the 
cloves, and a dozen young onions boiled 
tender, and sufficient seasoning of pepper 
and salt. Cut the pike in pieces, put it in, 
and let it stew gently until it is cooked 
enough. Take it out, and keep it hot. 
Add to the sauce two anchovies chopped 
up, and a spoonful of capers minced. Let 
it boil up for a minute or two, pour it over 
the fish, and lay sippets of toasted bread 
round the dish. 

Boasted Pike, or Mackerel, 
Time, half an hour. 

151. Pike ; bread-crumbs ; four anchovies; 
one pint of oj'sters or shrimps ; a sprig of 
parsley ; one onion ; pepper and salt ; nut- 
meg ; cloves, and mace ; half a pound of

spices. Mix all well together with half a 
pound of butter, stuff the fish, and put 
some of the stuffing over the outside. Put 
the pike in a cradle, and roast it, basting it 
unceasingly all the time it is cooking. 

MACKEREL 

requires to be eaten quite fresh ; it will not, 
in fact, keep at all. Some people call it 
the " pig of the sea," as it is scaleless, and, 
like pork, disagites with some eaters. 

Mackerel Boiled. 
Time, fifteen to twenty minutes. 

152. Cut the fish open sufficiently to 
empty the inside, remove the roes, and 
thoroughly wash them and the mackerel. 
Put them into a fish-kettle of cold water 
with a large tablespoonful of salt, bring 
them gradually to a boil, and simmer for 
about twenty minutes if the fish is large, if 
small, fifteen minutes will be sufficient, or 
even less time ; but they must be taken 
carefully out when the eyes are starting. 
Remove the scum as it rises; and when 
done, serve them on a napkin, and send 
fennel sauce, plain melted butter, or goose- 
berry sauce to table with them. 

Mackerel a la Maitre d'Hotel. 
Time, twenty minutes. 

153. One mackerel ; three spoonfuls of

roughly cleansing and drying it in a cloth, 
and put in a little salt, Cayenne, and a 
spoonful of clarified butter. I,ay it on a 
well-heated gridiron rubbed ovai- with butter 
or suet, and when of a nice brown colour, 
turn the back to the fire, taking care that 
the fish does not stick to the gridiron. 
When done, put into the incision of the 
back two spoonfuls of ma'itre d' hotel batter, 
previously putting your mackerel on a hot 
dish without a napkin, then spread three 
more spoonfuls of butter over it, place it in 
the oven for a few minutes, and serve it very 
hot. 

Fillets of Mackerel Stewed. 
Time, fifteen to twenty minutes. 

154. Two mackerels ; one lemon ; two

pan with two ounces of butter previously 
melted with a little flour, Cayenne, salt, and 
the rind of half a lemon. Shake the stew- 
pan over a moderate fire for a few minutes, 
turning the fillets. Then pour in slowly 
nearly half a pint of port wine, with the 
two spoonfuls of soy and the mace, boil up 
and pour over the fish. 

HADDOCKS. 

The haddock is a delicate fish with a fine 
flavour. This fish has a superstition at- 
tached to it. On each side of the body near 
the gills it has a dark spot, fabled to be the 
impression made by the finger and thumb 
of St. Peter when taking the tribute money 
from its mouth. 

It is in season from August to February.

it. Set it in a warm oven to bake for about 
half an hour, but if a Dublin Bay haddock, 
it will require double that time. Serve it 
on a dish without a napkin, with any sauce 
you please, anchovy, melted butter, &c. 

To Broil Haddock. 
Time, fifteen minutes. 

158. Thoroughly clean and dry them in a

ciumbs, fry it a nice brown, and serve it on 
a hot table-napkin, with anchovy or shrimp 
sauce. 

SHELl-FISH— LOBSTER. 
To Choose Lobsters. 

164. The heaviest are the best, and very 
often a good small-sized lobster will weigh 
heavier than a large one. 

The male is the best for boiling, the flesh 
is firmer, the shell of a brighter red. You 
may easily distinguish the hen lobster by 
its broader tail, and the two uppermost fins 
within the tail being less stiff and hard than 
those of the male lobster. Hen lobsters are 
best for sauce or salad, on account of their 
coral. 

To Boil a Lobster. 
Time, half an hour. 

165. Boiling a lobster may be made a 
horrible operation if the advice we are 
about to give is not attended to ; and its 
cries in dying are said to be most pain- 



Scalloped Lobster. — Lobster Cutlets. 



n 



i ful. Happily it is possible to kill it imme- 
diately. 

It is done thus : — 

Put into a large kettle water enough to 
C'3ver the lobster, witii a quarter of a pound 
of salt to every gallon of water. 

When it boils fast put in the lobster, head 
first : this is a little difficult to achieve, as 
i the lobster is not easy to hold thus over tiie 
I hot steam, but we are sure any humane cook 
I will do it. If the head goes in first it is 
I killed instantly. Boil it briskly for half an 
i hour, then take it from the hot water with 
, the tongs, and lay it to drain. Wipe off all 
■ the scum from it ; tie a little piece of butter 
in a cloth and rub it over with it. 

A lobster weighing a pound takes one 
hour to boil, others in like proportion, more 
or less. 

To Dress Lobsters. 

i66. When sent to table, separate the 
body from the tail, remove the large claws, 
and crack them at each joint carefully, and 
split the tail down the middle with a sharp 
knife ; place the body upright in the centre 
of a dish on a napkin, and arrange the tail 
and claws on each side. Garnish it with 
double parsley.

thin melted butter, sufficient to moisten it. 
Spht the empty shells of the tails and the 
bodies, and fill each of them neatly with the 
pounded lobster, cover them with grated 
bread, and put them into an oven. Serve 
on a folded napkin with fried parsley. Si.x 
or seven divided shells will be sufficient for 
a dish. 

Broiled Lobsters— An American Receipt. 

Time, fifteen or twenty minutes. 

i63. After having boiled the lobster, split

To Choose Crabs. 

173. Tlie heaviest crabs are usually con- 
sidered the best, although those of a 
middling size are the sweetest, when per- 
fectly fresh and in perfection, the shell, 
whether alive or dead, should be of a bright 
red colour, and the joints of the legs stiff. 
Crabs are stale when the eyes look dull. 
They are boiled in the same manner as 
lobsters, but require a much longer time, 
and are usually eaten cold.

rather more than a quarter its weight in 
bread-crumbs, season it with pepper and 
salt, return it to the shell with sufficient but- 
ter to moisten it, squeeze in the juice of a 
lemon, and put a thick layer of bread- 
crumbs on the top, with small pieces of but- 
ter laid over them. Place the shells in the 
oven, or in a Dutch oven before the fire, to

Butter some scallop shells, or if you have 
not any, a small tart dish. Strew in a 
layer of grated bread, then put some thin 
slices of butter, then oysters enough to fill 
your shells or dish. Cover them thickly 
with bread-crumbs ; again add slices of but- 
ter. Pepper the whole well, add a little of 
the liquor kept from the oysters. Put but- 
ter over the whole surface, and bake in a 
quick oven. 

Serve them in their shells or in the dish. 

Brown them with a salamander. If you 
have not one, make the kitchen shovel red-

To Boil and Serve Prawns. 
Time, ten minutes. 

190. Prawns ; strong salt and water ; one 
large China orange, or a lemon ; sprigs of 
double parsley. 



Boil your prav/ns for ten minutes in a 
stewpan of boiling salt and water, and then 
drain them dry. Put a large China orange, 
or lemon into the centre of a dish, and stick 
the prawns thickly over it, commencing at 
the bottom, with their backs upwards. At 
the top place three with the backs down, 
and a sprig of double parsley arranged be- 
tween them and at the edge of your dish. 

To Boil Cockles and Periwinkles.

open, then take them out ; let the liquor 
settle till it is clear ; then add an equal 
quantity of wine and vinegar, a little salt, 
and a blade of mace. Boil this pickle and 
pour it over your cockles ; put them in jar;; 
or bottles, and cover them close. 

MUSSELS AND COCKLES. 

Clean the shells well with repeated wash- 
ings, but do not keep them longer than 
necessary in water, as it is not their nature 
to remain immersed, and stew them with a 
small quantity of boiiing-water. The sauce- 
pan should be covered, and shaken con- 
tinually while they cook, that they may be 
done equally ; when the shells open they are 
done. Mussels and cockles must always be 
boiled in this way (to facilitate getting them 
out of the shells) before dressing them other 
ways, as it would be too troublesome to free 
them from the shells, small as they are, with 
the knife as we do oysters. In boiling 
mussels put a silver spoon in with them, and 
if it turns black do not eat them. Eat 
boiled mussels very hot, and take care to 
pick out the beards. 

To Stew Mussels- 
Time, ten minutes. 

193. One pint of mussels ; half a pint of 
liquor ; one blade of mace ; a small piece 
of butter rolled in flour.

shells, and as you do so save the liquor that 
runs from them, and pick out Irom each one

butter rolled in flour, let them stew gently 
for a few minutes, and serve them on toast. 

HEEEING3. 

194. Herrings are the most important of 
our British fish, forming one of the sources 
of our wealth, and feeding great numbers of 
our people. 

Still we seldom see them on a gentleman's 
table ; fashion perhaps, or the absurdity of 
a dislike for that which is abundant and 
common, preventing us from using them as 
much as we do other fish. W'c have heard 
assigned as another reason tiiat the great 
number of small bones which they contain 
render them dangerous food for children or 
old people. 

The herring is a very rich and wholesome 
fish, however, and v.e recommend all good 
housewives to give it a place at their table. 

To BoU Herrings. 

Tin;e, twenty minutes. 
In season from May to October. 

195. Some scraped horseradish ; vinegar, 
and salt. 

Clean and wash the fish ; dry them in a 
cloth, and rub over them a little vinegar and 
salt. Skewer them with their tails in :heir 
mouths, lay them on a strainer in a stewpan, 
and when the water boils put them in, and 
let them continue simmering slowly for about 
twenty minutes. When they are done, 
drain and pljtce them in the dish with the 
heads turned into the centre, garnish with 
scraped horseradish, and serve with parsley 
and butter sauce. 

To Bake Herrings, 
Time, one hour. 

196. Two herrings ; a large spoonful of 
pepper ; twelve cloves ; a tcaspoonful of 
salt; two bay-leaves, and some vinegar. 

Clean and wash your herrings, lay them 
on a dish or board, and rub well over and 
into them a spoonful of pepper, one of salt, 
and twelve cloves pounded. Lay them in 
an earthen pan, cover them with vinegar, 
add two or three bay-leaves, and tie them 
over with a thick paper. Put them into a 
moderate oven, and bake them lor an hour. 
To be eaten cold. 



To Smoke Herrings. 
Time, twenty-four hours. 

197. Herrings and some sawdust. 
Clean and lay some fresh herrings in salt 

and a little saltpetre for one night ; then run 
a stick through their eyes, and hang them 
in a row. Put some sawdust into an old 
cask, and in the midst of it 3^ heater red hot ; 
hang the stick on which you have threaded 
the fish over the smoke, and let them remain 
for twenty-four hours. 

Fried Herrings. 
Tisie, si.K or eight minutes. 

198. Clean and scale the fish, and dry them 
thoroughly in a cloth. When they are quite 
dr}', fry them to a bright colour. The 
herring, being so rich a fish, should be fried 
with less butter than fish of most kinds, and 
well drained and dried afterwards. A nice 
sauce to eat with herrings is sugar, mustard, 
and a little salt and vinegar. Some serve 
melted butter, but herrings are too rich to 
eat with a rich sauce. Crisp parsley may be 
used as a garnisii. Fry sprats in the same 
way ; they require no sauce, unless it may 
bo a httlc lemon pickle or ketchup. 

Broiled Herrings. 
Time, six or eight minutes. 

199. Herrings; a spoonful of flour; a 
qi art ^r of a pint of table beer or ale ; a slice 
of onion ; six ounces of whole peppers ; one. 
ounce of butter ; a spoonful of mustard. 

Clean and dry the fish, cutoff their heads, 
flour them and broil them. Break up the 
heads and boil them for a quarter of an 
hour in a little table beer or ale, with a little 
whole pepper and a slice of onion ; si rain off 
the liquor, thicken it with butter and flour, 
beat mustard up with it, and serve it in a 
tureen to eat with the herrings. 

Home-salted Herrings. 

200. Have the fish as fresh out of the sea 
as possible, clean and scale them with 
wiping, but do not wash them. Pepper 
them slightly, and sprinkle them well over 
with salt. They are very nice for breakfast 
fried. If they are to be eaten the next 
morning they should be turned after lying in 
the salt twelve hours ; if they are for the 
morning after, turn them when they have 
lain twenty-four hours. 

GURNETS. 

There are several kinds of this fish, the 
grey, red, streaked yellow, and sappharine ; 
of these the last is the best, but they are all 
very nice flavoured.

Gurnets — Cold Fish — "Dressed Fish. 



Baked Gurnets. 
Time, thirty or forty minutes. 

201. Two gurnets ; two or three slices of 
bacon ; one onion ; half a pint of melted 
butter ; two tablespoonfuls of Harvey sauce. 

Stuff the gurnets with veal stuffing, sew 
them up with packthread, and put the tail 
round the fish's mouth, as you do the 
whiting or haddock. Put them in a baking 
dish, cover them with thin slices of bacon, 
and bake in a hot oven for about half an 
hour, or longer if they are large fish. 

When done, put them on a dish, and 
serve with sauce over them, made of the 
onion, melted butter, and Harvey sauce. 

Boiled Gurnets. 

Time, two hours. 

202. Thoroughly clean your fish, and boil 
them in a fish-kettle of very strong salt and 
water, serve them on a napkin, and send 
anchovy sauce, or plain melted butter to 
table with them. 

Fish Cake of Cold Fisli. 
Time, two hours. 



203. Tlie remains of cold fish ; cod ; soles; 
turbot, &c. ; a bunch of sweet herbs ; bread- 
crumbs ; cold potatoes ; a sprig of parsley ; 

one or two eggs ; pepper and salt; quite I ;oie3;V;XseiTrtherve1y Vot.^ 
half a pint of water. ' ■' 



Then another layer of lettuce, encircled with 
hard-boiled eggs cut into quarters, then 
more lettuce, encircled with thin slices of 
cucumber and of beetroot. 

Pour over the whole any delicate sauce 
you may have. 

Rissoles of Cooked Fish. 
Time, a quarter of an hour. 

205. Any cooked rich light fish ; an equal 
quantity of bread-crumbs ; a piece of but- 
ter ; one onion ; a small bunch of sweet 
herbs ; pepper, salt, and one or two eggs ; 
a little lemon pickle. 

Herrings and similar rich fish are espe- 
cially good for the purpose, and even cold 
salt fish will do, on account of its savouri- 
ness. Pick all the meat from the bones, 
pound it in a mortar, or pull it to pieces 
with a silver fork ; mix it well with an equal 
quantity of bread-crumbs, and some butter, 
season it with an onion chopped very fine, 
and a sprig of parsley and sweet herbs 
minced, with pepper and salt. Mix with 
it sufficient beaten egg to bind it, make it 
up into flat and rather small cakes, and fry 
the rissoles with butter or dripping. When 
they are dished, dredge into the frying-pan 
flour enough to absorb the grease ; stir in a 
very little water, add pepper and salt, with 
a little lemon pickle, or any other flavouring 
that is liked, pour the gravy round the ris- 



Pick the meat from the fish with two 
forks, and mince it very fine ; mix it well 
with equal quantities of bread-crumbs and 
cold mashed potatoes, and season it highly 
with pepper and salt. Put the bones, heads, 
and trimmings of the fish into a stewpan, 
with the sweet herbs, parsley, and a little 
pepper and salt ; pour over it about a pint 
of water, and let it simmer slowly for an 
hour and three-quarters, or longer, if not 
done enough. Make the minced fish, bread, 
and potatoes into a cake, binding it with the 
white of a beaten egg ; brush it over with 
the yolk, strew it well with bread-crumbs, 
and fry it lightly. Pour over it the strained 
gravy, and set it over a gentle fire to stew 
slowly for nearly twenty minutes, stirring it 
occasionally. Garnish it with slices of 
lemon. 

To Dress Cold Fish. 

204. Some cold fish ; fowl ; game, &c. ; 1 
some lettuce; a cucumber; beetroot, and 
hard-boiled eggs. 

Place at the bottom of a dish a layer of 1 
cut lettuce, place over it some cold picked 
fish, and any cold picked fowl, game, &c, ' 



DRESSED PISH. 
After turbot, salmon, or any other fish has 
been dressed, take it from the bone in small 
pieces. 

Time, twenty minutes. 

206. To one pound offish, half a pint of 
cream ; one dessertspoonful of mustard ; 
one tablespoonful of essence of anchovies; 
one tablespoonful of ketchup ; a little pep- 
per ; two ounces of butter ; one ounce of 
flour ; a few bread-crumbs. 

Take the fish from the bones in small 
pieces ; mix them with half a pint of cream, 
one tablespoonful of essence of anchovies, 
one tablespoonful of ketchup, with a little 
pepper and salt. Rub one ounce of flour 
into two ounces of butter, then put it into a 
stew-pan, and make it quite hot. Put it 
into the dish it is to be served in ; strew 
bread-crumbs over it, and brown with a 
salamander. 

la Bouilla.haisse- 
Time, fifteen to twenty minutes. 
207. Several different kinds of fish ; ono 
onion ; a piece of garlic ; a sprig of pars-

ley ; a piece of Seville orange peel ; pepper ; 
snlt ; spice ; a pinch of saffron ; and a little 
oil. 

This French dish should be made of 
several different kinds of fish, and the more 
variety the better; pilchards, mackerel, and 
other rich fish being excluded. The best 
kinds are haddocks, gurnet, whiting, and 
fish of that description, with any small fish 
there may be at hand. Place in a stewpan 
an onion cut into five or six pieces, a piece 
of garlic, some parsley minced fine, a piece 
of Seville orange peel, pepper, salt, spice, 
and a pinch of saffron, and water barely 
enough to cover the fish, and aftenvards to 
be put into it with a very little oil ; the oil 
and the saffron are to be measiu-ed accord- 
ing to taste. Let this mixture cook well, 
cut the fish in pieces, put it in the stewpan, 
stir all well together, and put it over a. fierce 
fire. The name bouiUabaise indicates that 
the cooking should be very quick; the 
sooner, therefore, it comes to a boil, and the 
faster it boils the better. It should cook 
enough in about a quarter of an hour, but 
some kinds of fish render it necessary to 
allow five or six minutes longer. The in- 
dispensable ingredients in a bouillabaisse 



are, onion, garlic, pepper, salt, spice, pars- 
ley, orange peel, saffron, and oil ; the quan- 
tity, of course, must depend on the quantity 
offish to be dressed. Fennel, sage, or a 
bay- leaf may be added at the option of the 
cook. If there is liver to the fish, it should 
be put in only long enough to cook. 

Pickled Ormers. 

Time, four hours. 

208. Ormers ; three bay-leaves ; a few 
white peppers ; slices of whole ginger ; salt, 
and vinegar. 

After your ormers are well cleaned, beat 
them till quite tender, put them in a stew- 
pan, cover them well with water, allowing 
for the boiling. Put in three bay-leaves, a 
few white peppers, and some whole ginger 
sliced. Boil gently for four hours, or till 
tender, then add the salt and vinegar to 
your taste. If meant to keep long, add 
more vinegar than for present use ; or take 
the whole of the water in which they have 
boiled away, wash the stewpan, put them in 
again and cover them with vinegar, leaving 
them to boil only a few minutes. 



SOUPS. 



Tl»e cook who would succeed in sending 
good soup to table must take care that she 
has strong and excellent stock ready for it, 
and the economical housewife will soon find 
that stock does not always require meat to 
be bought for its production. 

The water in which mutton has been 
boiled, the liquor left from dressing a calfs 
head, the bones taken from rolled ribs of 
beef, or from any boned joint, hare, or 
poultry, will make excellent stock for a 
family soup. Fish bones will also produce 
a gocKl jelly for it. The trimmings of large 
joints or cutlets, the shanks of mutton, the 
shank of a ham, the large bone of the sir- 
loin of beef, will all add to the stock-pot, 
and supply a good foundation for her soup. 
Ox-cheek carefully managed, and sheep's 
head and trotters, also make excellent stock 
with a flavouring of ham or anchosy for the 
soup. 

Soup should never be made wth hard 
water, unless it is of green-peas, in which 
case the water must be hard to preser\'e their 
colour. 

The rule as to quantity is : a quart of 
water to a pound of meat without bone ; 
but whenever this quantity of water is di- 
minished, the soup is increased in strength 
tmd richness. 



Meat should be put into the soup-kettle 
with very little water at first, and with a 
piece of butter to keep it from burning. It 
should be let stew very slowly till the essence 
of the meat is extracted. Very long, very 
slow stewing, is the certain way to procure 
good soup. 

"The more haste the worse speed" is 
the proverb of the soup-kettle. 

Skim the soup frequently also, and do 
not let it cool until it is quite made. Let 
the meat of which your soup is made be 
freshly killed, and very lean, every particle 
of fat should be removed from it. Onions 
should be put in the soup soon after it is 
begun to be made ; herbs, carrots, and celery 
three hours afterwards ; turnips, or any de- 
licate vegetable, just before the soup is 
finished. When celery is out of season, 
the seeds of the plant, tied up in a piece 
of clean muslin, will give the flavour equally 
well. 

To Colour Soaps. 

A piece of bread toasted very brown 
may be simmered in the soup for a short 
time before it is done, and will give it a 
browTi colour. The ordinary colouring, 
however, is done, by putting a little burnt 
brown sugar into it. fbe sugar should tje 



78 



Directions for Making Soups, 



put into a saucepan with a piece of butter 
the size of a walnut, and a glass of ketchup ; 
it should be melted together, and then 
put into the soup-kettle. Further directions 
are given in "Soups." For those who do 
not dislike them, burnt onions are an im- 
provement, both as to colour and flavour. 

Colouring to be kept for use is made thus : 
a gill of water, a quarter of a pound of 
lump sugar, and half an ounce of roll butter, 
should be set over the fire in the smallest 
frying-pan, and stirred till it is of a bright 
brown colour ; add to it half a pint of water, 
boil and skim it, let it get cold, and then 
bottle and cork it down for future use. 

The flavouring of soups must in a great 
measure depend on the cook ; her taste, 
therefore, should be discriminating and deli- 
cate. She should be careful in the use of 
ketchups and sauces, though they are both 
useful and important. Cow-heel, calf's- 
feef, and ox-tail soups, all require flavour- 
ing, and will bear a little sauce or ketchup, 
but it should never be overdone. 

Clear soups have been the fashion of late 
years : puries, such as pea-soup, &c., being 
not so often seen, except at old-fashioned 
people's tables. To clarify soup break an 
&gg, and throw the white and the shell to- 
gether into a basin, but take care not to let 
a particle of the yolk go in. 

Beat the white well to a stiff froth, and 
mix it by degrees, and very completely with 
the soup, which should then be put on the 
fire and stirred till it again boils. Take it 
off the moment it boils, cover it close, and 
let it stand for a quarter of an hour ; then 
strain it off. When a soup is clarified it will 
bear a stronger flavouring, as it loses a por- 
tion of its own in the process. Forcemeat 
balls and whole eggs are sometimes put into 
soups, but they are not as fashionable as 
they used to be. 

Summary of Directions for Slaking Soups. 

Take care that the soup-kettle or stewpan 
is perfectly clean and free from any grease 
or sand. An iron soup-pot should be washed 
the moment you have finished using it, with 
a piece of soda the size of a small nutmeg, 
dissolved in hot water, to remove all greasi- 
ness or taste of onion. A teaspoonful of 
potash will answer the same purpose. 

Remember that slow boiling is necessary 
to make good soup. 

Do not uncover the soup-kettle more 
frequently than necessary for skimming it 
clean ; but if your soup is too weak, do not 
cover the pot in boiling, as the water will 
evaporate in steam and leave your liquor 
Stronger, Skim frequently; it is important 



that every portion of scum should be re- 
moved from the soup. Pour in occasionally 
a little cold water, which will cause the al- 
bumen to rise in abundant scum, or if you 
put in the required quantity of salt with the 
meat it will cause the scum to rise ; but the 
cup of fresh water is much the better mode 
of helping the soup to clear itself. 

Always stir your soup with a wooden 
spoon. 

Let the soup be quite free from scum be- 
fore the vegetables are put in. 

Do not drown your meat in water, but 
draw the juices out slowly by putting it into 
the stewpau with only a f^/y little water and 
a piece of butter, to keep it from burning, 
and then add the given quantity of water 
to it. 

It will take six or eight hours to extract 
the essence from a few pounds of beef. 

It is better to make your soup the day 
before it is required, because then the fat 
will cake at the top of it and can be easily 
taken off, and you can judge of the good- 
ness of your soup by the consistency and 
firmness of the jelly. 

The water in which meat or fowls have 
been boiled will make good broth, but for 
soup add a little gravy beef to it. 

Vegetables to be added to soup should be 
well cleaned, washed, and picked. 

It is very difficult to give a perfect mea- 
surement of seasoning, as the tastes of 
people differ considerably with regard to it, 
and the cook must conform to that which 
suits the palates of her employers ; but, in a 
rough way, it is usual to add about a tea- 
spoonful of salt to a pound of meat, and 
pepper according to taste, some naturally 
insipid broths and soups requiring more ; 
very savoury soups less. 

It is better to season too litde than too 
highly. 

Put fresh meat into cold water to stew for 
soup. If you make soup of already cooked 
meat, pour hot, but not boiling water over it. 

Time and attention are required to achieve 
a good soup. 

Stock. 

Make your dark stock of beef ; mutton 
gives a peculiar and tallowy taste unless it 
has been previously roasted ; then it may 
help, but it will not do to inake stock alone. 

Let your meat be fresh and lean ; cut it 
in tiny pieces. Diaw the juices of tlie meat 
out before you add the water, by putting it 
in a stewpan with half a pint of water (or 
less) and a quarter of a pound of butter, 
and letting it stew till a glaze is formed on 
the pan ; then set it aside and let it simmer 



Stock for Sou^s. 



79 



for six or seven hours very slowly. The al- 
bumen wiil then rise and bring with it 
all the impurities of the meat. This is 
called the scum. By skimming it off care- 
fully, the soup is cleared. Keep your 
fire of an equal temperature, and beware 
of letting the stock boil fast ; if it does 
the scum will dissolve and part will sink 
to the bottom, and render it difficult for 
you to clarify your stock. Add cold 
water, if necessary, to make the scum rise. 
When the stock is clear of the albumen let 
it boil, and put in the broken bones in a 
bag, and the gristly part of cold meat, 
trimmings, &c., &-c. ; for, from the bones, 
as has been already said, you will get gela- 
tine, the nutritious part of the stock. They 
should be well broken up ; the smaller the 
better, so as to present the larger amount of 
surface. 

Add flavouring and vegetables, and then 
let the stock simmer again. 

Si.x or eight hours will make it fit for use ; 
to preserve its flavour it will be well then to 
remove it from the fire ; but do not let it 
cool till it is quite made. 

Let it stand during the night ; the next 
day take off the fat, and put it by in a stone 
jar for use. 

If your stock is made in an uncovered 
stewpan it will be all the stronger, fur water 
evaporates, and consequently there will be 
the less of it left with the juices of the 
meat. 

Brown stock may be made from ox-cheek, 
shin of beef, ox-tail, brisket or flank of 
beef. 

General Stock-pot. 

209. Stock, in its composition, is not con- 
fined to fresh meat only, any meat or bones 
are useful ; pieces of beef, from any part 
from which gravy can be extracted ; bones, 
skin, brisket, or tops of ribs, ox-cheek, pieces 
of mutton, bacon, ham, and trimmings of 
turkeys, fowls, veal, &c. ; and also of hare 
and pheasant, if they are old and fit for no 
other purpose ; in fact, anything that will 
become a jelly, will assist in making stock ; 
to this medley of ingredients add carrots 
cut into slices, herbs, onions, pepper, salt, 
spice, &c. ; and when all have stewed until 
the stock is of a rich consistency, take it 
from the fire and pour it out to cool. When 
cold, all the fat must be taken off, and it 
must be poured clear from the sediment. 
When tlie soup is required to be very rich, 
the jelly from a cow-heel, or a lump of 
butter rolled in flour, must be added to the 
stock. 

The stock-pot should uever be suffered to { 



be empty, as almost any meats (save salt 
meats) or fowls make stock ; the remnants 
should never be thrown anywhere but into 
the stock-pot, and should too much stock 
be already in your possession, boil it down 
to a gl.ize ; waste is thus avoided. 

Cheap Stock. 
Time, six hours. 

210. Three or four quarts of the liquor in 
which mutton or beef has been boiled ; any 
bones of dressed meat ; trimmings of poultry; 
meat, &c. ; two large onions ; five cloves ; 
pepper and salt to taste ; one turnip ; two 
carrots ; a head of celery ; a bunch of 
savoury herbs ; a sprig of parsley ; two 
blades of mace. 

Put any bones of roast beef, trimmings of 
meat and poultry into a stew-pan ; add a 
head of celeiy cut into pieces, two onions 
stuck with cloves, a turnip, carrot, savoury 
herbs, with a sprig of parsley, two blades of 
mace, a few pepper corns, and a little pepper 
and salt ; pour in four quarts of the liquor 
in which any meat has been boiled ; set it 
over a slow fire, and let it simmer gently for 
quite six liours. Remove all the scum the 
moment it rises, and continue to do so imtil 
the stock is clear ; then strain it through a 
fine hair sieve, and it will be fit for 
use. 



Sone Stock for Soup. 
Time, two to three hours. 

2X1. Bones of any meat which has been 
dressed, as sirloin bone ; leg of mutton 
bone, &c. , &c. ; two scraped carrots ; one 
stick of celery ; enough cold water to cover 
the bones, or enough of the liquor left from 
braising meat to cover them ; one spoonful 
of salt. 

Break the bones into very small pieces, 
put them into a stew-pan with the carrots 
and celery ; cover them with cold water, or 
cold braise liquor ; and let it boil quickly 
till the scum rises ; skim it off and throw in 
some cold water, when the scum will rise 
again. This must be done two or three 
times, ti.l the stock is quite clear ; then 
draw the pan from the fire and let it stew 
for two hours, till all the goodness is ex- 
tracted from the bones. Strain it oft" and 
let it stand all night. The next day take off 
the grease very carefully, not leaving the 
least atom on it, and lift it from the .sedi- 
ment at the bottom of the pan. It wiil then 
be fit for use. 



So 



Beef Soup — Soupe et Bouilli. 



Browning for Soups. 

212. Three tablespoonfuls of sugar; about 
a pint of boiling water. 

Put three tablespoonfuls of brown sugar 
into a frying-pan ; set it on the fire to brown, 
stirring it with a wooden spoon, that it may 
not burn. When sufficiently dark-coloured, 
stir into it about a pint of boiling water ; 
when it is thoroughly incorporated, put it 
aito a bottle ; and when cold, cork it closely 
over ; and use a tablespoonful or more, as 
may be required, to give a colour to your 
soup. 

A burnt onion or two can be made use of 
for the purpose of browning, and are often 
considered far better than the above receipt. 
Or onions, after the outer skin has been 
taken off, dried in a slow oven until a dark 
brown, and pressed flat like biffins, are very 
useful to keep by you, as with care they can 
be preserved good for some time. 



To Clarify Stock or Soups 

213. The whites of two eggs to about four 
quarts of stock or soup ; two pints and a 
half of cold water. 

Whisk the whites of two very fresh eggs 
with half a pint of water for ten minutes ; 
then pour in very gently the four quarts of 
boihng stock or soup ; whisking it all the 
time. Place the stew-pan over the fire ; 
skim it clear ; and when on the point of 
boihng whisk it all well together ; then draw 
it to the side, and let it settle till the whites 
of the eggs become sepaiated. Strain it 
through a fine cloth placed over a sieve, and 
it will be clear and good. 



Beef Soup. 

Time, eight hours. 

■ 214. Five pounds of shin of beef ; a quart 
of water to each pound of meat ; one head of 
celery ; one onion ; four small, or three large 
carrots ; two turnips ; a bunch of sweet 
herbs ; pepper and salt. 

Cut off the meat from a shin of beef, and 
put the bone into a stew-pan with five 
quarts of water, and let it boil slowly for 
four hours. Then strain it into a large 
basin, and when cold, remove the cake of 
fat. Cut the meat into small pieces, and 
put them into a stew-pan with the strained 
gravy, the bunch of herbs, tied together, a 
large head of celeiy, one onion, the four 
carrots, and two turnips, all cut up small. 
Let them simmer slowly for four hours, 
seasoning them with pepper and salt to your 
t^te, and adding a spoonful of browning. 



When done, take out the bunch of thyme, 
and it will be ready to serve. 

Soupe et Bouilli. 

Time, eight hours. 
215. Two pounds and a half of brisket of 
beef ; two pounds of the leg of mutton ; 
piece of beef ; one gallon of water ; one 
onion ; two carrots ; two turnips ; one leek ; 
one head of celery ; three cloves ; a little 
whole pepper ; one French roll ; one head 
of endive. 

Take about two pounds and a half of 
brisket of beef, roll it up tight, and fasten it 
with a piece of tape. Put it into a stew-pan 
with two pounds of the leg of mutton, piece 
of beef, and a gallon of water ; let it boil 
slowly, skim it well, and put in an onion 
stuck with cloves, two carrots, two turnips, 
a leek, a head of celery cut into slices, with 
some whole pepper. Cover the stew-pan 
close, and stew the whole very slowly for 
seven hours. About an hour before it is 
served, strain the soup quite clear from the 
meat. Have ready a few boiled carrots cut 
into wheels, some turnips cut into balls, the 
endive, and a little celery cut into pieces. 
Put these into a tureen with a roll, dried 
after removing the crumb. Pour the soup 
over these boiling hot, add a little salt and 
Cayenne, remove the tape from the beef, 
and serve it on a separate dish.

SAUCES AND GUAVIES. 



FISH SAUCES. 

A well made sauce is, perhaps, one of the 
best testimonies of the skill of the cook, and 
is avery essential part of a good dinner. A 
badly made sauce will spoil the food with 
which it is served, ard is a sure sign of in- 
efficiency and ignorance in both the cook 
and her mistress. 



Sauces are expensive, and a housewife 
who studies economy, and has only small 
means, v/ill not use as many nor as varied 
forms, perhaps, of the same sauce, as the 
cook in a wealthy family ; but it is econo- 
mical to be able to serve up a sauce which, 
at a trifling expense, will greatly improve a 
dinner made, perhaps, from «old remains.

Receipts for Melting Butter — Sauces, &-c. 



and for fish, sauce of some kind is absolutely 
required. 

The sauce peculiar to the English house- 
keeper is Melted Butter ; and yet, common 
as it is, we scarcely ever find it well made. 
Now, every lady should know experimentally 
howtomakeit, that she may direct her cook. 
She should also know experimentally how 
to make Bread Sauce and common White 
and Brown Sauce, on which most other 
sauces are founded. Take care that your 
sauces are delicately flavoured ; if your cook 
is not first-rate, taste them yourself. This 
is quite possible, even immediately before 
you receive your guests or sit down to your 
family dinner, as .<;auces must be made be- 
fore the fish is dressed, and kept warm till 
required in a bain-marie — or, if your kitchen 
does not possess that most useful utensil, 
the saucepan in which they have been made 
should be placed in a large stewpan of boil- 
ing water near the fire. 

The thickest saucepans should be used for 
this operation, and only w-ooden spoons 
should be used for stirring. Remember, 
also, that your saucepan must be exquisitely 
clean and fresh if you would have your sauce 
a success, especially when it is melted 
butter. Let your fire be clear and not too 
fierce.

Frencli Marinade for Flavouring Fish 
before cooking. 

281. Pepper and salt ; three cloves; three 
slices of onion; a sprig of sweet basil; a 
tcaspoonful of lemon juice or vinegar. 

A good French marinade for flavouring 
fish before cooking is to sprinkle over the 
fish, laid out on a dish, the pepper, salt, 
spice in fine powder, three cloves, the slices 
of onion, the basil minced fine, and a tea- 
spoonful of lemon juice, or a little vinegar. 
After a few hours the fish may be taken 
from this marinade, and either fried, boiled, 
or stewed. The marinade may be used in 
the cooking, or for sauce at pleasure. 

A marinade of oil and sweet herbs minced 
fine is excellent for fish before frying or broil- 
ing. When taken from the marinade, it 
can be either floured or covered with bread- 
crumbs and beaten iigg. A squeeze of 
lemon juice or similar pleasant acid, so per- 
ceptible in French cookery, is well worth our 
imitation.

MADE GRAVIES AND SAUCES. 

Plain joints roasted make their own gravy, 
except perhaps lamb. Made gravies and 
sauces are necessary for more elaborate, and 
less homely cooking. 

Two kinds of gravies are made — i.e., 
brown and white. We shall give receipts 
first for these, which are required for mak- 
ing nearly all the other more complicated 
gravies and sauces, premising that beef is 
the foundation of brown or savoury gravies, 
and veal or fowls that of the white and 
more delicate gravy ; but as you may not 
always possess gravy beef at the time you 
want to make your gravy, it will be as well 
to tell you that any kind of stock will do ; 
the trimmings of beef, veal, or mutton, and 
the bones of cold joints of meat, or uncooked 
bones, will all afford materials for it. 

Place these, whatever they may be, in a 
stewpan, lay the beef at the bottom, then 
the mutton, with a slice or two of bacon or 
ham, and any bones you have, broken up 
small ; add a few slices of carrot, an onion, 
a blade of mace, two or three cloves, a little 
black and white pepper, a bunch of sweet 
herbs, and lay over them any small pieces 
of veal you may have. Cover the stewpan 
close, and set it over a slow fire for six or 
seven minutes, shaking the pan often. Then 
dredge in a little flour, and pour in water 
till the whole is rather more than covered. 
Cover the stewpan close, and let it simmer 
for several hours until your giavy be rich 
and good ; then season it to your taste with 
a little salt, and strain it off, and you will 
have a gravy that will answer for ordinary 
purposes. Or you can make a good gravy 
from a melt, a kidney, the skirts of beef, 
the knuckle of dressed mutton, or any other 
meat cut into small pieces, and fried a nice 
brown, with onions, a bunch of sweet herbs, 
and spices. The water in which meat has 
been boiled, used instead of pure water, 
improves and adds to the richness of gravy. 
A cowheel, also, will yield a good gravy 
stock. Soak it for about twelve hours in 
cold water, and then boil it for about two 
hours and a half or three hours. When 
strained and quite cold, take the fat off with 
great care. 

'1'ri.iffles and morels thicken and improve 
the flavour of gravies or soups ; about 
half an ounce of either being simmered in 
a pint of water, and added to the gravy. 
But in all cases the proportions used, and 
their quality, should be attended to, as the

flarour of anv Rravy or sauce slionkl be 
adapted skilfully to the dishes for which it 
is required. 

White meats, and all white made dishes, 
require a smooth, delicately flavoured gravy 
or sauce ; brown made dishes, a more pi- 
quant and savoury one. 

Do not let any separate flavour predomi- 
nate in your gravy ; the different materials 
should harmonise completely with each 
other, and blend into one perfect v/hole. 

Some cooks make their gravy by first 
boiling a rich, but small quantity of stock 
to a glaze, and then pouring slowly over it 
a sufficient quantity of boiling stock or broth 
for the gravy. Flavour it with a few sweet 
herbs, mushrooms, &c., &c. 

Both Tarragon and knotted marjoram 
greatly improve the flavour of gravies. 

Directions for making colouring for soup 
have already been given ; the same may be 
used for gravies. 

Glaze. 
Time, till it becomes a jelly. 
292. Boil some very strong clear gravy or 
jelly over a quick fire to the thickness of 
cream, stirring it constantly until it will ad- 
here like jelly to the spoon. It must then 
be immediately poured out of the stewpan ; 
the greatest care is required during the time 
of thickening to prevent it from burning. 
\Vhen required for use, dissolve it by pla- 
cing the jar {or whatever it may be kept in) 
in boiling water, and brushing it over the 
meat two or three times, when it will form 
a clear varnish. Any kind of very rich 
stock can be boiled down to a glaze. To be 
used for hams, tongues, &c. 

To Brown Flour. 
Time, five minutes. 

293. Put some flour in a pan or dish, and 
Set it in the oven or over the fire. Stir it

pan, with the carrot and onion cut into 
slices, and the meat into dice. Stir it over 
a quick fire until it is lightly browned ; then 
add the herbs aud the water, aad let it all

ful of mushroom ketchup or Worcestershire 
sauce, strain it through a sieve, and it will 
be fit for use. 

Kidney Gravy.

eight minutes, and then add about a pint of 
water. Let it simmer for an hour and

ture with a whisk as quickly as possible. 
When the whole forms a sort of crenm, add 
the oil and mustard, which must be well 
mixed previously ; a pinch of parsley minced

Cut the ham or bacon into very small 
pieces, and put them into a sfevv|ian with 
about two ounces of butter at the bottom, 
a blade of mace, three cloves, a shallot, or 
onion, and a piece of parsley root ; shake it 
over the fire occasionally for half an hour, 
until the bottom of the pan has a dark glaze, 
then pour in a pitit and a half of beef broth, 
or stock, and boil all together for about an-

Savoury Jelly to put into Ccid Pies. 
Time, two or three hours. 

316. Two pounds of knuckle of veal or 
mutton ; two slices of ham ; a btmch of 
sweet herbs ; two blades of mace ; one

some whole pepper ; a little black pepper ; 
three quarts of water ; whites of two eggs ; 
salt. 

Make this jelly of a small bare knuckle of 
veal, or shoulder, or a piece of scrag of mut- 
ton ; put the meat into a stewpan, that shuts 
very closely, with two slices of ham, a bunch 
of sweet herbs, two blades of mace, one 
onion, the peel of half a lemon, a teaspoon- 
ful of Jamaica pejj'iier bruised, the same of 
whole pepper, and three i'r.ts of water. As 
soon a^i it boils skim it clean, and let it sim- 



mer slowly till quite strong and rich ; strain 
it, and when cold take off the fat with a 
spoon, then lay over it a clean piece of blot- 
ting paper to remove every particle of grease. 
When cold, boil it a few minutes with the 
whites of two well-beaten eggs, (but do not 
add the sediment), and strain it through a 
sievj, with a napkin in it, which has beev> 
dipped in boiling water. If the pie be of 
fowl, or rabbit, the carcases, necks and 
heads, added to a small piece of meat or a 
cow heel, or shanks of mutton will be better 
suited than the jelly of meat alone.

jelly when cold, then when boiling dissolve 
the isinglass in it, and set it aside to cool. 
Mix and whisk together the whites of the 
two eggs ivifh their shells, the tarragon 
vinegar, the wine, and a cupful of water 
(nearly, but not quite half a pint). Whisk 
them all into the stock, and stir it till it 
boils for about a quarter of an hour. Take 
it off the fire, let it stand to settle, and 
pour it through a jelly bag into a basin or 
plain mould which you have first dipped in 
cold water. Let it stand all night to get 
cold, and the next day you may turn it out 
of the mould, by dipping the bottom of it in 
cold water (as for sweet jelly) ; then cut it 
into small cubes for garnishing your pie, 
meat cake, or ham.

Clarified Batter. 
Time, two or three minutes. 

323. Melt some butter in a tin ."saucepan 
over a slow fire ; when it begins to simm.er 
take off the scum, and let it stand at the 
side of the fire for the buttermilk to sink to 
the bottom ; then strain it through a very 
fine hair sieve. It will keep good for some 
time, if it is potted in jars and kept in a cool 
storeroom. 

When clarified butter is melted again for 
use, it must be skimmed and strained from 
the sediment it will leave. 

To Use Dried Huslircoias. 
Time, ten minutes to a quarter of an hour. 

324. Sim'mer them in gravy ; they will 
swell to nearly their original size. 

How to use Glaze. 

325. Glaze is merely very strong gravy, 
boiled quickly down till it is of the consist- 
ency of liquid jelly. When it is of this 
thickness it must be poured out of the stew- 
pan at once, or it will of course burn. 

When you require to use it, stand the jar 
in which you keep the glaze or jelly in a 
pan of boiling water, and thus melt it 
gently. Lay it on the meat or cutlets with a 
paste brush. It soon becomes firm. When 
one layer is dry put on another, till it forms 
a clear varnish. A ham will take three lay- 
ers to look very nice. 

A glaze pot and brush are to be found in 
most well furnish.ed kitciicns, but any lady 
may make a little glaze for herself if she re- 
quires it, and a preserve jar will hold it ; a 
pan of boiUng water will dissolve it. 



FORCEMEATS, GARNISHING, FLAVOURING, &c. 



Making fcreeraeat is an essential part of 
good cookery. It depends very gjreatly, as 
sauces do, on a delicate taste in the cook, 
who should so harmonize the ingredients 
that no one flavour may predominate over 
the otl'.er. 

A selection can be made from the follow- 
ing list of meat, herbs, and spice, for any 
particular forcemeat or stuffing that may be 
required, taking care that no paiticular fia- 
vcar predominat ;:-, as thyme and lemon 



1 peel frequently overcome all otr.ers, and 
! entirely destroy the effect of the v, hole. It 
I must always be firm enough to cut with a 
knife, but not dry. 

Bacon or butter must take the place of 
suet, when the forcemeat is required to be 
eaten cold, and if required very light, the 
bread should be soaked, and well beaten 
up when the water has been thoroughly 
pressed from it, and used instead of bread- 
crumbs.

TEUFFLES. 
The tmffle is a species of mushroom fun- 
gus without roots. It is found in Hamp- 
shire, Wiltshire, and Kent, and is of a good 
size in our own country, though not so large 
as the Italian truffle is. In the New Forest, 
truffles are frequently rooted up from beneath 
the giant oak-trees which "came in with 
the Conqueror," by the hogs, who (true 
epicures) are extravagantly fond of them. 



In France they form an article of consider- 
able traffic, and have often been purchased 
at fabulous prices for the royal table. They 
are very expensive, and chiefly used for gar- 
nishings and seasoning. 

Good truffles have a pleasant flavour, and 
are light and elastic. Bad truffles have a 
musty smell. They ought to be eaten quite 
fresh, as their flavour is a good deal injured 
by drj'ing for keeping. 

To Prepare Truffles an Natnrel. 
Time, one hour. 

337. Wash them several times in luke- 
warm water and brush them carefully all the 
time to remove every particle of earth or 
grit from them. Then wrap each truffle in 
buttered paper, and bake them in a hot oven 
— or (better still) roast them in hot ashes for 
an hour. Take off the paper, wipe the 
truffles, and ser\'e them on a hot table- 
napkin, or use them for garnishing. 

Eer.soii fj; Drying Herbs for Flavonring. 

Basil is fit for drying about the middle of 
August.

Summer Savory, end of July and August. 

Tarragon, June, July, and August. 

Thyme, end of July and August. 

Winter Savoury, end of July and August. 

They must be gathered on a dry day, and 
cleaned and dried immediately by the heat 
of a stove or Dutch oven, the leaves picked 
off, sifted, and bottled. 

Crisped Parsley. 

338. Pick some handsome sprigs of curled 
parsley, wash them well, dip them into cold 
water, throw them into a pan of boiling fat, 
and take them out as soon as they are crisp. 

It should be done after the fish, &c., it is 
to go with is ready, and drained from the 
grease before the fire for a minute or two 
after it is done. 

A far better plan is to spread the pareley, 
after it is picked and washed, in a Dutch 
oven, or on a sheet of paper, at a moderate 
distance from the fire, and keep turning it 
till it is quite crisp ; lay little pieces of butter 
on it, but not enough to make it greasy. 
This is a much better plan than that erf 
frying.

when cold bottle it for use. Secure the 
bottles with new corks, and dip them in 
melted resin. 

Mushrcoin Ketchup. 

344, Be careful in selecting and testing 
the mushrooms you intend to use. The 
irue mushroom has the under side flesh- 
coloured or pink when very young, and as 
it grows old it becomes dark-brown or 
blackish. It has a very pleasant smell, 
which the toadstool has not. 

Let the mushrooms you use for ketchup 
be full grown mushroom flaps, and take 
care that they are gathered in dry weai/'ici\ 
or the ketchup will not keep long. 

Time, three hours and a half. 

To each peck of mushrooms half a pound 
of salt. 

Put a layer of mushrooms in a deep pan, 
sprinkle salt over them, cover the salt with 
another layer of mushrooms, and so on till 
all are laid in the dish. Let them remain a 
few hours, then break them in pieces. 

Let the pan stand in a cool place for 
three days. Every morning stir and mash 
them up to extract their juice. 

Measure the quantity of juice, and to each 
quart allow h.alf an ounce of allspice, halt 
an ounce of ginger, two blades of mace 
pounded, a quarter of an ounce of Cayenne, 
Put the whole into a stone jar, cover it very 
closely, set it in a saucepan of boiling water 
over the fire, and let it boil for three hours. 
Then take it up, pour it into a clean stew- 
pan, and let it simmer by the side of the 
fire for half an hour. Pour it into a jug. 
Let it stand twelve or more hours in a cool 
place. Pour it into another jug and strain 
it off for bottling. Pour it througii a 
strainer into tlie bottles, add to each quart 
of liquor thirty drops of brandy. Cork the 
bottles very closely. 

Hot Vinegar. 
345. Chop fine two cloves of garlic, put 
this into a bottle, with a pint of vinegar, a 
tablespoon ful of Worcester sauce, a tea- 
spoonful of salt, an ounce of ground white 
pepper, and half an ounce of Cayenne. 
Shal^e it up well, then let it rernain fqr a

month. Strain it through fine muslin, and 
boltle it in small bottles, which should be 
well corked down. ■ 

D3va Hot, 

346. To three quarts of the best vinegar 
put eight ounces of salt, two ounces of 
ginger, half an ounce of mace, quarter 
of a pound of siiallots, one ounce of white 
pei^er. one ounce of mustard seed, half a 
tablespoonfu! of good Cayenne pepper. Boil 
it all together, and when cold put it into 
ajar. 

Gather any fruit or vegetables you like, 
wipe them, and put them into the pick'e. 
Secure the jar by tying leather and a bladder 
over it. 

Lemon Vinegar. 

Time, nine weeks. 

347. Two dozen and a half of lemons ; 
four ounces of garlic ; one handful of horse- 
radish ; one gallon of vinegar ; one ounce 
of mace ; half an ounce of cloves ; one 
ounce of nutmeg ; half an ounce of Cayenne ; 
half a pint of mustard seed. 

Grate off the outer rinds of the lemons 
with a piece of glass, cut them across but 
do not quite separate them ; work in as 
much salt as you can with the fmgers ; 
spread dnem on a large pewter dish,'' and 
cover tiiem quite over with salt ; tiien put 
them into a cool oven three or four times, 
until the juice is dried into the peels ; they 
must be hard but not burned. Then put to 
them the garlic peeled, the horseradish 
sHced, and again place them in the oven till 
there is no moisture left. As the salt dis- 
solves work in more. Put the vinegar into 
a stewpan with the cloves pounded, the 
mace beaten fine, the nutmeg cut into slices, 
and the Cayenne and mustard slightly 
bruised, and tied in a muslin bag. Boil all 
these ingredients with the vinega-, and pour 
it boiling hot on the lemons. The jar must 
be well closed, and let stand bv the fire for 
six days, shaking it well every day. Then 
tie it down and let it stand for three months 
to take otf the bitterness. When it is bot- 
tled, the pickle must be put into a hair or 
lawn sieve two or three times, till it is as 
fine as possible. After the lemon pickle is 
cleared off", add about one quart of boiled 
vinegar to the remaining ingredients, and 
after it has stood for some time it is excel- 
lent for hashes, &c.. &c. 

This pickle may be put into white sauce, 
one spoonful being sufficient ; two spoonfuls 
for brown sauce. It is also good for fish, 
fowls, or any made dish, care always being 
taken to put it in before the sauce is mixed 
With cream, or the acid may curd!? it.

Modes of Dressing Beef. 



105 



Time to roast brown meats, a quarter of 
an hour to each pound. 

White meats, a quarter of an hour to each 
pound, and twenty minutes over ; in cold 
weather perhaps' a /////^ longer; in warm 
weather not quite so longf. 

Time to boil, about the same time 
reckoned from the moment the pot both. 

Stewing should be a very slow process. 
Time generally given in the receipts. 

Care and attention required for all 
methods. 

Beef is in season all the year ; but salt 
beef is best in winter. 

To make Tongh Meat Tender. 

360. Soak it in vinegar and water ; if a 
very large piece, for about twelve hours. 

For twenty pounds of beef use six quarts 
of water to one pint and a half of vinegar, 
and soak it for si.x or seven hours. 

Sirloin of Beef. 

Time, a quarter of an hour to each pound 

of meat. 

361. Make up a good fire ; spit or hang 
the joint evenly, at about twelve inches 
from it. Put a little clarified dripping in 
the dripping-pan, and baste the joint vvellas 
soon as it is put down to dress ; baste again 
every quarter of an hour till about twenty 
minutes before it is done ; then stir the fire 
and make it clear ; sprinkle a little salt, and 
dredge a little flour over the meat, turn it 
again till it is brown and frothed. Take it 
from the spit, put it on a hot dish, and pour 
over it some good made graw, or mix the 
gravy left at the bottom of the' dripping-pan 
with a little hot water and pour it over it. 
Garnish with fine scrapings of horseradish 
in little heaps. Serve Yorkshire pudding 
with it on a separate dish. Sauce: horse- 
radish. 

Eoast Ribs of Beef. 
Time, a quarter of an hour to the pound. 

362. The chine-bone and the upper part 
of three rib-bones should be taken off, and 
the flap-ends fastened under with very small 
skewers. The joint is roasted and served as 
the sirloin. 

Eihs of Beef Boiled. 

Time, twenty minutes to the pound, or 

fifteen minutes, and half an hour over. 

363. Order the butcher to take out the 
bones of the joint. Roll it into a round, 
and fasten it with skewers and a broad piece 
Qf tape in the shape of a round. Place it at 



the distance of twelve inches before a large 
fire till it is partly dressed ; then move it 
gradually forward towards the fire. Put 
some clarified dripping in the pan, baste it 
the moment the dripping melts, and do the 
same every quarter of an hour. Just before 
it is done — i.e., about twenty minutes be- 
fore you remove it from the spit, dredge it 
with flour and baste it with a little butter. 
Remove the tape and skewer, and fasten it 
with a silver skewer instead. Serve with 
good gravy over it. 
Horseradish sauce. 

To Boil Beef. 

Reckon the time from the water .coming to 

a boil. 

364. Keep the pot boiling, but let it boil 
'jery slowly. If you let the pot cease boiling, 
you will be deceived in your time ; therefore 
watch that it does not stop, and keep up a 
sufficiently good fire. Just before the pot 
boils the scum rises. Be sure to skim it off 
carefully, or it will fall back and adhere to 
the meat, and disfigure it sadly. When you 
have well skimmed the pot, put in a little 
cold water, which will cause the scum to 
rise again. The more carefully you skim, 
the cleaner and nicer the meat boiled will 
look. 

Put your meat into cold water. Liebig, 
the great German chemist, advises us to 
plunge the joint into boiling water, but the 
great cook, Francatelli, and others of the 
same high standing, recommend cold ; and 
our own experience and practice are in ac- 
cordance with the cook rather than the 
chemist. Put a quart of cold water to every 
pound of meat. Allow twenty minutes to 
the pound from the thne the pot boils and 
the scum rises. 

It is more profitable to boil than to roast 
meat. 

Aitchbone of Beef, 
Time, twenty minutes to the pound, 

365. Three-quarters of a pound of salt ; 
one ounce of moist sugar ; aitchbone weigh- 
ing ten pounds ; two gallons and a half of 
water. 

Dry the salt, and rub it with the sugar in 
a mortar, then rub it well into the aitchbone 
of beef. Turn the joint and rub in some 
pickle e/ery day for four or five days. Wash 
it well before you boil it. Put it into .-i 
large boiling pot, so as to let it be well 
surrounded and covered with cold water in 
the above proportion, set the pot on one 
side of the fire to boil gently ; if it boils 
fast at first nothing can prevent the meat 
from becoming hard and tough, T}jo

slower it boils the tenderer it will be and 
the better it will cook. 

The soft fat which hes on the back of an 
aitchbone of beef is delicious when hot, the 
hard fat is best cold. 

Save the liquor in which this joint is boikd 
for pea-soup. 

Garnish with slices of turnip and carrot, 

Silverside of Beef Boiled. 
Time, a quarter of an hour to each pound. 

366. Ten or twelve pounds of the silver- 
side of beef ; three gallons of water. 

After the beef has been in the pickle for 
about nine or ten days, take it out and wash 
it in water, skewer it up in a round form, 
and bind it with a piece of tape. Put it 
into a large stewpan of water, and when it 
boils remove the scum very carefully, or it 
will sink and spoil the appearance of the 
meat. Then draw the saucepan to one side 
of the fire, and let it simmer slowly until 
done, wiien ready to serve, draw out the 
skewers and replace them with a silver one. 
Pour over it a little of the liquor in whicii it 
has been boiled, and garnish with boiled 
carrots and parsnips. 

When taken from the water, trim off any 
soiled part from the beef before sending it to 
table. 

Tom Thum'b Sound of Beof. 
Time, nearly three hours. 

367. Nine or ten pounds of rib of beef ; 
two gallons and a half of water. 

Select a fine rib of beef, from nine to ten 
pounds ; have the bone removed, it will 
make a gravy for anything you may require; 
rub a little sale over the inside of the rib, roll it 
like a fillet of veal, and bind it round with a 
tape or a few wooden skewers ; place it in 
sufficient pickle to cover it, and let it remain 
in it five or six days, turning it every morn- 
ing. When it is required, place it in a stew- 
pan of very hot water (to prevent the gravy 
from being drawn out), and let it only 
simmer, not boil, according to the size of 
the joint, allowing tlie full time for each 
pound of nieat. When done, remove the 
skewers and replace them with a silver or 
plated one. 

Beef Bouilli.

part of one, tie in a neat shape with a strong 
cord, put it into a stewpan ; add to it any 
remains of meat or giblets which you have. 
Cover it with water, set it over a slow fire, 
and as it boils skim it carefully ; add the 
carrots, onion, and parsley ; then put in 
the flour and butter. Cover it for twenty 
minutes. Take up the meat, strain the 
gravy and add the wine or ketchup to it. 
Pour it over the meat. 

If you stew tlie bone which has been taken 
out with the meat, the gravy will be all the 
better. 

A Beef Stow.

inches square ; put it into a stewpan, and 
pour on it a quart of broth ; then let it boil, 
and sprinkle in pepper and salt to taste. 
When it has boiled very gently, or simmered 
two hours, shred finely the peel of a large 
lemon, and add it to the gravy. In twenty 
minutes pour in a flavouring, composed of 
two spoonfuls of Harvey sauce, the juice of 
the lemon, the flour, and a little ketchup.

We must beg our lady readers who are 
obliged to keep house economically, not to 
be frightened at the idea of having fillets de 
bcEuf (which are seldom seen in middle- 
class houses), at their table. A little ordi- 
nary care, attention, and practice, will en- 
able a tolerable cook to do them well, and 
they are especially nice dishes. Moreover, 



T08 



Fillets de Boeuf, Beef Cakes, &c. 



they give two fresh dishes from one joint. 
Use the under-cut of the sirloin, we will 
say, for example, on the Saturday for fillets 
de boeuf, and you have your sirloin still 
ready for the spit on Sunday. It is true that 
in order to have them you must order a toler- 
ably larg^e joint, but in a large family a good- 
sized joint is economical, because it wastes 
less by drying up in cooking. For small 
families a small dish of fillets de bo3uf may 
be made from a joint weighing ten pounds 
or even less. 

Fillets de Boeuf a la St. Anhyn.

the parsley to it. Then beat up the yolk of 
one egg, mix 'it with the mince to bind it. 
Wash your hands and flour them. Make

Time, eight to ten minutes. 

305. Rumpsteak ; one ounce of butter ; 
one tablespoonful of mushroom ketchup;

Rumpsteak is best for broiling and frj-ing;

Take care that the butcher cwts the steak 
the right thickness — i.e., about three-quar- 
ters or half an inch. Divide it in halves. 
Place the gridiron over a clear fire, and lub 
the bars with suet to prevent the meat from 
adhering to them. Place the two steaks on 
it and broil them, turning them frequently 
with the steak tongs, or if with a fork, care- 
fully pricking it through the fat. If the 
steak itself is pricked, the gra\->- will run out 
and it will harden. Have ready a hot dish 
on which you have placed a lump of butter 
the size of a large walnut, a tablespoonful of 
mushroom ketchup, and a little salt and 
l^epper. Lay the steaks (rubbing them 
lightly over with butter) on the dish, and 
serve as quickly as possible.

well hung ; and .served with onion sauce. 

Soast Loin of Kutton. 
Time, a quarter of an hour to die pound. 

421. This joint is not economical on ac- 
count of the weight of fat attached to it ; but 
it is very useful in small families, as it is a | 
joint that can be cut so as not to leave too ' 
much cold meat. London butchers gene- I 
rally remove the fat, ready for dressing. 
Roast it at a bright fire, and baste carefully ' 
about every quarter of an hour. Brown and 
froth it as before directed, for leg, &c.

it with small skewers to keep it in shape, 
and tie it round with a string. Roast it be- 
fore a brisk fire, allowing a quarter of an 
hour, or twenty minutes, for each pound of 
meat. Make a gravy of the bones, add- 
ing to it a glass of port wine, a tablespoon- 
ful of ketchup and a little salt. When the

and the hquor that comes from the meat; 
and throw some more of the seasoning over. 
When done enough, take it up, and lay it

Put it in a stewpan with just enough 
water to cover it, with an onion and a few 
pepper corns. Shut the cover very closely

it very slowly for nearly two hours, remove 
the string, and pour over it a little well-made 
caper sauce, the remainder of which must 
be served separately. 

BAKING 

Is not a good or economical way of cooking 
joints of mutton, but it is sometimes done 
on account of its convenience. 

A joint to be baked is put on a trivet or 
stand in a baking dish, sometimes with po-J 
tatoes under it, which are so savoury thus 
dressed that they partly reconcile us to the 
sodden taste of meat dressed in a common 
oven. A shoulder of mutton is, we believe,' 
the only one thus dressed. To do it nicely, 
cover it with two sheets of buttered paper — 
or they may be greased with dripping — to 
keep it from being dried up. Put potatoes 
under it with a little water or gravy over 
them, and a little salt. The meat should be 
occasionally basted while baking.

Put it over a clear fire, and broil it gently 
till it is of a fine brown colour, or set it be- 
fore the fire in a Dutch oven and do the

four pickled cucumbers, and a spoonful of 
capers, boil them five minutes in half a pint 
of gravy, thicken it with a piece of butter 
rolled in flour, lay the mutton on a hot disb 
and pour the sauce over it.

joint, as some necks of muttoa weigh six or 
seven pounds, in which case an extra half 
hour must be allowed for it to simmer. 

Breast of Mutton and Green Peas.

the breast. Cover the lamb with buttered 
paper, and spit it evenly, roast it before a 
quick fire according to the weight. Just 
before removing it from the spit, dredge it 
with flour and a little salt, and baste it with 
butter to make it froth up. Twist a cut 
paper round the shank bone, ]Mace it on a 
hot dish, and pour round it a little gravy

ping-pan and poured round it. Send up 
mint sauce in a tureen. 

Eoast loin of Lamb- 
Time, a quarter of an hour to each poimd. 

454. The loin is seldom roas*'-], on 
account of its small weight, but for lamilies 
of two ladies or a single person it will be 
found very delicate. Care must be taken 
that it does not burn in roasting. It is best 
to cover it with a buttered paper and remove 
it a few minutes before serving, to baste and 
froth it. Mint sauce.

122 Lamb's Fry. — Lamb Cutlets. — Lamb Chops. 



Thoroughly clean a lamb's head, and 
parboil it, then brush it over with the yolks 
of the eggs well beaten ; chop a few sweet 
herbs very fine, mix them with bread- 
crumbs and a little warmed butter, and 
spread the mixture thickly over the head, 
then put it into a Dutch oven before a 
bright and clear fire to finish dressing. 
Mince the liver and the heart very small, 
and let them stew until done, pour in three- 
quarters of a pint of good gravy, with a 
spoonful of lemon pickle, or the juice of a

it dry. Brush it over with the yolk of a 
beaten ^gg. and then cover it with bread- 
crumbs, seasoned with minced parsley, 
pepper, and salt. Fry it till it is a nice 
colour — i.e., for about five minutes— and 
serve it on a folded napkin with fried 
parsley. 

Cold lamb is so excellent that it is often 
preferred to hot-dressed joints. It is quite 
a mistake to prepare it by any of the modes 
of d'-essing up cold meat. It should be 
eaten with mint sauce and a nicely-made 
salad.

off the skin and the greater part of the fat, 
scraping the upper part of the bones per- 
fectly clean. Brush each cutlet over with 



wcll-bcaten yolk of egg, and then sprinkle 
them with fine bread-crumbs, seasoned with 
pepper and salt. After this dip them sepa- 
rately into a little clarified butter. Sprinkle 
more crumbs over them and fry them, turn- 
ing them occasionally. Have ready half a 
peck of green peas, nicely boiled, and ar- 
ranged in a pyramid or raised form in the 
centre of a hot dish. l,ay the cutlets before

into the yolk of a v,-ell-beaten agg, strew 
bread-crumbs over each, and fry them all 
nicely in butter, or in beef dripping. When 
done, arrange them in the form of a crown 
on the dish ; make a sauce of two ounces of 
butter placed in the pan seasoned with a 
little pepper and a sprig of chopped parsley, 
or a lemon sliced thin and just browned ; 
dredge into the sauce a dessertspoonful of 
flour, and stir it smooth ; put in a cupful of 
boiling water, and stir it well together over 
the fire for a few minutes ; pour this sauce 
inside the crown of cutlets, and serve. Or, 
when the cutlets arc fried, drain them ; 
place them on a dish in a crown ; glaze

chops leaning against them, and serve very 
hot. Or they may be served garnished only 
with fried parsley. 



Veal. — Fricandeaiix of Veal. 



123 



VEAL. 



Veal should be obtained from a calf of 
about two or three months old, if it is re- 
quired nice and delicate. Bull-calf veal is 
best fc- cooking in joints ; cow-calf veal for 
made dishes. 

The failing of this meat is its tendency to 
turn ; should it show symptoms of doing so, 
put it into scalding water, and let it boil for 
seven minutes with some pieces of charcoal 
or sprinkled with charcoal powder. Take it 
out of the pot, plunge it in cold water, and 
put it into the coolest spot you can find. 

The skirt should always be removed from 
the breast, and the pipe from the loin in hot 
weather, as soon as it comes from the but- 
cher's. 

Veal supplies numerous entrees or made 
dishes. 

The fillet derives much of its pleasant 
flavour from being stuffed ; veal in itself 
being nearly tasteless. The stufilng should 
be placed in the hollow place from whence 
the boue is extracted, and the joint should 
be roasted a beautiful brown ; it should be 
cooked gradually, as the meat being solid, 
will require to be thoroughly done through, 
without burning the outside ; like pork, it 
is rather indigestible. Boiled bacon or ham 
should accompany it to table, with the addi- 
tion of a lemon cut in halves and handed to 
the guests. 

In roasting veal, care must be talcen that 
it is not at first placed too near the (ire ; the 
fat of a lom, one of ihe most delicate joints 
of veal, should be covered with greased 
paper ; a fillet also should have on the caul 
umil nearly done enough ; when almost 
done, dredge with flour, and produce a fine 
froth. In grand kitchens, or where cream 
is abundant, cooks occasionally baste veal 
with it for about fifteen or twenty minutes 
before serving. 

To Ecast a Fillet of Veal. 
Time, four hours for twelve pounds. 

466. Veal ; half a pint of melted butter ; 
a lemon ; half a pound of forcemeat. 

Take out the bone of the joint, and with 
a sharp knife make a deep incision between 
the fillet and the udder. Fill it with the 
forcemeat or veal stuffing. Bind the veal 
up in a round form, and fasten it securely 
with skewers and twine. Run the spit as 
nearly through the middle as you can ; 
cover the veal with buttered paper, and put 
it at some distance from the fire at first, 
advancmg it as it becomes dressed. Baste 



it well, and just before it is done, take off 
the paper, dredge a little flour over it, and 
baste it well with butter to give it a fine 
frothy appearance. Remove the skewers, 
and replace them with a silver one ; pour 
over the fillet some meJted butter, with the 
juice of half a lemon and a little of the brown 
gravy from the .meat. Garnish with slices of 
cut lemon, and serve with either boiled ham, 
bacon, or pickled pork. 

Fricandeau of Veal. 
Time, two hours and a half or three hours. 

467. Three or four pounds of the fillet of 
veal ; a few slices of bacon ; a bunch of sa- 
voury herbs ; two blades of mace ; two bay- 
leaves ; five allspice ; one head of celery ; 
one carrot ; one turnip ; lardoons ; pepper 
to taste ; one pint of gravy or stock. 

Cut a thick handsome slice from a fillet 
of veal, trim it neatly round, and lard it 
tliickly* with fat bacon. Cut the carrot, 
turnip, and celery into slices, and put them 
into a stewpan with a bunch of savourj 
herbs, two blades of mace, five allspice, 
and two bay-leaves, v.'ith some slices of 
bacon at the top. Lay the fricandeau over 
the bacon with the larded side uppermost, 
dust a little salt over it, .and pour round it a 
pint of good gra\'y or broth. Place it over 
the fire, and let it boil, then let it simmer 
very gently for two hours and a half or 
three hours over a slow fire, basting it fre- 
quently with the gravy. Take out the frican- 
deau when done ; skim off the fat, strain 
the gravy, and boil it quickly to a strong 
glaze, cover the fricandeau with it, and 
serve it up very hot, upon a puree of green 
peas. Be careful that the gravy does not 
touch the fricandeau, but that it only covers 
the bacon and other ingredients at the bot- 
tom of the dish. 

Fricandeanx of Veal. ' 
Time, two hours to two hours and a half. 



468. Some slices of veal ; a quart of good 
gravy ; a slice of lemon ; a spoonful of 
anchovy ; two dessertspoonfuls of lemou 
pickle ; two of browning ; a little Cayenne 
pepper ; a few shreds of bacon. 

Cut some steaks from the thick part of a 
fillet of veal about half an inch thick and 
si.x or seven inches long, lard them neatly

with shreds of fat bacon, and dredge them 
with flour. Brown them in a Dutch oven 
before the fire, and then put tliem into a 
stewpan with the gravy, and let them stew 
half an hour. Add a slice of lemon, a little 
anchovy, lemon pickle, browning, and Ca- 
yenne pepper. When the fricandcau-^c are 
tender take them up, strain and skim the 
gravy, boil it to a glaze, and pour it over 
the fricandeaux, or thicken it with a piece of 
butter rolled in flour. Serve them with sor- 
rel sauce, and garnish with forcemeat balls, 
or the yolks of hard-boiled eggs. 

CALF'S HEAD. 

A calfs head may be bought ready for 
cooking from the butcher's, but as it is as 
well to give directions for the cook in all 
possible circumstances, we will say here 
that if she has a calfs head to prepare wiih 
the hair on it, she must have ready a pan of 
scalding water to remove it. She will find 
the hair easier to get off if she powders it 
with resin after letting it soak a little while 
in warm water. She must then plunge it 
into the scalding water, holding it by the 
ear, and carefully scrape off all the hair. 
Many cooks use scalding water only, but 
M. Soyer (whose name is a perfect authority) 
recommends the resin, and it certainly faci- 
litates the operation, though it is not indis- 
pensable. Then take out the eyes, saw the 
head in halves lengthways tlirough the skull. 
Take the brain and tongue out. Half a 
calf's head is generally enough to serve at 
one time, but a whole liead is a very hand- 
some dish. Break the jawbone, remove the 
gums containing the teeth, and then lay the 
head in a large panful of warm water to 
disgorge. 

Calfs Head Boiled. 

Time, to soak, one hour and a half ; to 
simmer, one hour and a half. 

469. Half a calfs head ; half a pint of 
melted butter with parsley ; one lemon ; a 
pinch of pepper and salt. 

Soak the half calf's head in cold Vi^ater for 
an hour and a half, then for ten minutes in 
hot water before it is dressed. 

Put it into a saucepan with plenty of cold 
water (enough for the head to swim), and 
let it boil gently. When the scum rises 
skim it very carefully. After the head boils, 
let it simmer gently an hour and a half. 
Sei-ve it with melted butter and parsley over 
it, and garnish with slices of lemon and tiny 
heaps of fried parsley. Ham should be 
served with calf's head, or slices of bacon. 



Or: a Savoury Calfs Head. 

470. When the head is boiled, score-Jt oE 
the surface, beat up the yolk of an egg, and 
rub it over the cheek with a feather. Pow- 
der it with some finely-powdered lemon 
thyme and parsley, pepper and salt, and 
bread-crumbs. Brown it with a salamander 
or in a Dutch oven, and when it begins to 
dry, sprinkle a little melted butter over it. 

Garnish with rashers of bacon curled 
round it. \ 

Save some of the liquor in which the calf 3 
head is boiled for a hash the next day. 

Calfs Brains and Tongue. 
Time, to boil ten or fifteen minutes. 

471. Alittle parsley and thyme; one bay- 
leaf ; a little pepper and salt ; two table- 
spoonfuls of melted butter or cream ; juice 
of a quarter of a lemon ; a pinch of Ca- 
yenne. 

Separate the two lobes of the brain with 
a knife, soak them in cold water with a little 
salt in it for an hour ; then pour away the 
cold water and cover them with hot water ; 
clean and skin them. Boil them then very 
gently in half a pint of water, take oif the 
scum carefully as it rises. Take them up, 
drain and chop,them, and put them to warm 
in a stewpan with the herbs chopped, the 
melted butter or cream, and the seasoning. 
Squeeze a little lemon juice over them ; stir 
them well together. Boil the tongue ; skin 
it ; take off the roofs ; lay it in the middle 
of the dish, and serve the brains round it. 

Hashed Calfs Head. 
Time, one hour and a half. 

472. Half a calfs head ; a bunch of sa- 
VOU17 herbs ; two blades of mace ; a little 
Cayenne ; pepper and salt ; one lemon ; a 
gill and a half of sherry, or any white wine ; 
two dessertspoonfuls of mushroom ketchup ; 
one onion ; one carrot ; one quart of broth, 
or the liquor in which it was boiled. 

Cut the meat from the remains of a boiled 
calfs head, into small round pieces of about 
two inches across. Put a quart of broth or 
the liquor in which the head was boiled into 
a stewpan with a carrot, one small onion, 
two blades of mace, and a bunch of savoury 
herbs, and boil it until reduced to nearly 
half the quantity ; then strain it through a 
hair sieve, and add a glass and a half of 
white wine, the juice of a lemon, two dessert- 
spoonfuls of mushroom ketchup, and a 
piece of butter rolled in flour. Lay in the 
slices of head, and when gradually well 
heated, let it just boil up. Then serve it on

peel of half a lemon, and the pepper and 
salt. Just cover the whole with boiling 
water, and let it simmer slowly for quite 
two hours, covered closely over. Strain the 
gravy through a sieve, and add a glass of 
sherry or white wine of any sort, the tomato 
sauce, lemon juice, and ketchup; thicken it 
with a piece of butter rolled in flour, and let 
it simmer slowly for a quarter of an hour, 
skimming it well. Serve it on a hot dish, 
and surround it with a border of green peas, 
previously boiled. Garnish with forcemeat 
balls or bacon.

have of liver ; fry the bacon lightly, take it 
out and keep it hot ; then fry the liver in the 
same pan, seasoning it with pepper and salt, 
and dredging over it a little flour. Wlien it 
is a nice brown, arrange it round the dish 
with a roll of bacon between each slice. 
Pour off the fat from the pan, put in about 
two ounces of butter well rubbed in flour to 
thicken the gravy. Squeeze in the juice of 
a lemon, and add a cupful of hot water, 
boil it, and pour it Into the centre of the 
dish. Serve it garnished with forcemeat 
balls or slices of lemon. 



FOBK 



Very great care should be used in pur- 
chasing pork, as of late years pigs have been 
subject to much disease, and the flesh of the 
animal then becomes perfectly poisonous. 
If possible, learn where and how the pork 
you eat is fattened. 

A pig is one of the most profitable ani- 
mals to keep, and will well repay any care 
and attention bestowed on it. Every part 
of it is used and is good for food. It should 
be kept scrupulously clean, the sty carefully 
cleaned out very often, and the pig washed 
and scrubbed itself. Its food should be 
always cooked for it. Skim milk, potatoes, 
and meat are its best food. 

A pig should only be six months old for 
boiling or roasting, larger and older, of 
course, for salting. A pig should be short- 
legged and thick-necked, and have a small 
head. 

A pig should not be sufteredto touch food 



for twenty-four hours before it is killed. 
Ham, bacon, pickled pork, &c., &c., are 
indispensable in an English kitchen, but 
fresh pork is seldom served in joints at the 
tables of the upper classes. For family use, 
however, and v/here people keep their own 
pigs, the leg and loin of pork are often seen. 
As many persons are unable to digest fresh 
pork, it is seldom or never part of the bill 
of fare for a dinner party. 

Modern taste is adverse to the old savoury 
stuffing of sage and 01..,:-.=;. bu' this also 
is admissible at the family repast if liked. 

The skin of young porkei-s is kept on 
when it is cooked, and is called "crack- 
ling," bemg very crisp and brown, and 
making a crackling noise when cut. 

Pork must be very much more dressed 
than all other meats, except veal. It 
should, thereiore, be placed on the spit at a 
considerable distance from the fire, and thus 



121 



To Roast Sticking Pig, &c. 



let get well warmed through before the skin 
begins to get dry and brown. 

Sucking Pig— to Scald it. 

488. A Slicking pig should be dressed the 
day after it is killed, if possible, and should 
not be more than three weeks or a month 
old. The pig is generally sent from the 
butcher's prepared for the spit, but in case 
our readers should ever have occasion to 
scald and clean it for themselves, we will 
give a few directions : — Make ready a large 
pan of scalding water. While the water is 
boiling, put the pig into cold water for ten 
minutes ; plunge it into the boiling water 
(liolding it by the head), and shake it about 
till the hairs begin to loosen in the water. 
Take it out dry it, and with a coarse cloth 
rub the hairs backwards till they are all 
removed. When it is clean, cut it open, 
take out the entrails, and \^•ash it thoroughly 
in a large pan of cold water. Dry it in a 
cloth ; remove the feet at the first joint, 
leaving a little skin to pnll over the bone. 
Fold it in a very wet cloth until you are 
ready to put it on the spit. 

To make Sage and Onion Stuffing for 
Eoast Pig or Koast Pork. 

Time, twenty-five to thirty minutes. 

489. Two large onions ; double the quan- 
.tity of bread-crumbs ; three teaspoonfuls of 
chopped sage ; two ounces of butter ; half 
a saltspoonful of pepper; one saltspoonful 
of salt; one egg. 

Boil the onions (imless they are Portugal 
onions) in two or three waters to take off 
the strong taste in them ; then drain them, 
chop them up fine, and mix them with 
double their quantity of bread-crumbs, three 
very full teaspoonfuls of minced sage, two 
ounces of butter, a good half saltspoonful 
of pepper, and double the quantity of salt. 
Mix the whole with the well beaten yolk of 
an egg to bind it. 

N.B. — Persons who prefer a strong stuff- 
ing can use half the quantity ■ of bread- 
crumbs, and chop the onions raw. 

To Eoast tlio Pig. 
Time, one ho';: and a half to two hours. 

490. ITnif a pint of melted butter; two 
ounces of fresh butter; three-quarters of a 
pint or one pint of sage and onion force- 
meat. 

When the pig is well cleaned, make a 
forcemeat according to previous directions, 
or a veal stuffing forcemeat if preferred. 
Sew it up with a strong thread ; truss it as a 



hare is trussed, with its fore-legs skewered 
back and its hind legs forward. Dry it well 
and rub it with a little flour. Set it before 
a clear brisk fire, arrange under it a dripping 
pan and basins to catch the gravy. Baste 
it with a httle pure olive oil, or with its own 
gravy, rubbing it occasionally (when you do 
not use oil) with butter. When it is done, 
cut off the head, split it in halves, divide the 
pig with a very sharp knife down the centre, 
lay the backs together, put the ears on each 
side, and the halves of the head at each end 
of the dish. Pour a little of the gravy of 
the pig, mi.xed with thin melted butter and 
a squeeze of lemon juice, over it. 

Send some of the same gravy and melted 
butter (seasoned with a little Cayenne) to 
table in a sauce tureen. 

Sauces to be eaten with it— bread sauce, 
or tomato sauce, or apple sauce, as pre- 
ferred. ; 

To Bake a Pig. 

Time, two hours. 

491. Wash the pig very nicely, rub it with 
butter, and flour it all over. Well butter 
the dish in which you intend to bake it, and 
put it into the oven. When sufficiently 
done, take it out, rub it well over with a 
buttered cloth, and pvit it in again to dry. 
When it is finished cut off the head, and 
split it open ; divide the pig down the back 
in halves. Lay it in the dish back to back, 
with one half of the head at each end, and 
one of the ears on each side. Take off the 
fat from the dish it was baked in, and you 
will find some good gravy remainjjig at the 
bottom. Add to this a little veal gravy, 
with a piece of butter rolled in flour, and 
boil it up, put it into tlie dish over the pig 
and serve. 

A stuffing of bread-crumbs, chopped sage 
leaves, pepper and salt, should be put into 
the inside before it is baked, as is done for 
roast pig. 

CHINE OF POEK. 

This joint is usually sent to table with 
turkey. It should be salted for about sixty 
or seventy hours previous to cooking, and 
then be roasted. A chine is as often sent to 
table boiled as roasted, but the latter is usu- 
ally preferred. In roasting pork, the skin 
should be cut lengthways into small strips, 
but not deep enough to reach the meat. 

Chine Eoasted. 

Time twenty minutes to the pound. 

492. Half a pint of pork stuffing ; half a 
pint of apple sauce. 



Chine, Leg, Loin, Sparerib, and Griskin of Pork. 129 



Score the skin deeply, stuff the chine with 
pork stuffing, and roast it gently by a clear 
fire. 

To Boil a CMne. 

Time, a quarter of an hour to the pound, 
and twenty minutes (mer. 

493. Lay it in brine for nine or ten days, 
turning it every day. When it is ready, put 
it into a saucepan, and more than cover it 
with water. Let it boil slowly, skimming it 
well. 

Send it to table when done, garnished 
with small well trimmed cauliflowers or 
greens. 

How to Stuff a CMne of Bacon. 

Time, two or three hours. 

494. The chine is to be soaked for a night 
in cold water, and then to be cut through the 
meat from the sward to the bones, in spaces 
of about one half or three quarters of an 
inch, the nicks made by the cutting to be 
filled as full as it is possible to get them with 
the following green herbs : parsley, pot mar- 
joram, a few green onions, a little thyme, a 
little lettuce, a little mace, or any other 
savoury herbs. Some people use also prim- 
rose and violet leaves. The whole of the 
herbs to be chopped fine and sprinkled with 
a little pepper. The chine to be tied in a 
cloth and steamed. 

This is a very favourite dish to eat when 
cold in the fens and marshes of Lincolnshire 
at feasts, sheep clippings, and other festivals, 
when green herbs can be procured. It is a 
very nice relish for breakfast. 

Ta Eoast a Leg of Pork. 
Time, twenty minutes to one pound. 
495. The leg to be roasted should not 
weigh more than six or seven pounds. 
Score the rind or skin with a sharp knife all 
round the joint, place it at some distance 
from the fire, turn it constantly and baste it 
well. It will yield sufficient dripping to 
baste itself without butter. If the crackling 
and fat are not kept on, the joint will not 
require so long a time to roast it. Sauce : 
brown gra%"y and tomato. 

To Soast a Leg of Pork the Old Fashioned 
Way with Stuffing. 

Time, twenty minutes for each pound. 

496. Sage and onion stuffing ; a piece of 
butter. 

Select a fine small leg of pork, keep the 
skin on, and score it in regular stripes of a 



quarter of an inch wide with the point of a 
sharp knife ; cut a slit in the knuckle, raise 
the skin, put under it some nice sage and 
onion stuffing, and fasten it in with a small 
skewer; put it at some distance from the 
fire, and baste it frequently. Just before it 
is done, moisten the skin all over with a 
little butter, dredge it with flour, and place 
it near the fire to brown and crisp. When 
done, put it on a hot dish, pour a little gravy 
made in the dripping pan round it, and 
serve with apple sauce. 

To Eoast a Loin of Fork. 

Time, two hours and a half. 

497. Take a loin of pork of about five 
pounds, and score it with a very sharp knife 
at equal distances, place it at a good dis- 
tance from the fire to prevent the skin from 
becoming hard, and baste it very frequently 
all the time. When done make a little gravy 
in the dripping-pan, pour it round ihe meat, 
and serve with apple sauce in a tureen. A 
loin of pork may be stuffed v/ith sage and 
onion, or the stuffing baked and served sepa- 
rately, if the flavour be not objected to by 
the family, 

To Boast a Sparerib of Fork. 

I Time, one hour and three-quarters for six 
poimds. 

498. Score the skin, put the joint down to 
a bright fire to roast, rub a little flour over 
it. if the rind is kept on, roast it without 
a buttered paper over it, but if the skin and 
fat are removed, cover it with a buttered 
paper. Keep it frequently basted. About 
ten minutes before taking it up, strew over 
it some powdered sage ; froth it with a littla 
butter, and serve witli gravy strained over it, 
and apple sauce in a tureen. 

Fork Griskin. 
Time, a quarter of an hour to each pcand. 

499. A griskin is usually very hard. It is 
well before you roast it to put it into as 
much cold water as will cover it, and let it 
just boil. Take it off the momeni it boils. 
Rub a piece of butter over it and flour it, 
then set it in a Dutch oven before the fire 
to roast a nice brown. 

To Steam a Ham. 
Time, twenty minutes to each pound. 

500. If the ham has been himg for some 
time, put it into cold water, and let it soak 
all nicjht, or let it lie on a damp stone 
sprinkled with water for two days to mellow. 
Wash it well, put it into a steamer — there 

9 



130 



To Dress Hams. — To Boil Pork. 



are proper ones made for the purpose — over 
a pot of boiling water. Steam it for as long 
a time as the weight requires, the proportion 
of time given above. 

This is by far ths best way of cooking a 
ham. It prevents waste, and retains the 
flavour. When it is done, skin it and strew 
bread-raspings over it as usual. If you pre- 
serve the skin as whole as possible and cover 
the ham when cold with it, it will prevent 
its becoming dry. 

To Soil a Ham. 
Time, four or five hours. 

501. A blade of mace ; a few cloves ; a 
eprig of thyme ; and two bay leaves. 

Well soak the ham in a large quantity of 
water for twenty-four hours, then trim and 
scrape it very clean, put it into a large stew- 
pan with more than suificient water to cover 
it ; put in a blade of mace, a few cloves, a 
sprig of thyme, and two bay leaves. Boil it 
for four or five hours, according to its weight; 
and when done, let it become cold in the 
liquor in which it was boiled. Then remove 
the rind carefully without injuring the fat, 
press a cloth over it to absorb as much of 
the grease as possible, and shake some bread- 
raspings over the fat, or brush it thickly 
over with glaze. Serve it cold, garnished 
with parsley, or aspic jelly in the dish. Or- 
nament the knuckle with a paper frill and 
vegetable flowers. 

Or, to Serve Hot. 
Time, four hours for ten pounds. 

502. Before placing your ham in soak, 
nm a small sharp knife into it close to the 
bone, and if when withdrawn it has a pleasant 
smell, the ham is good. Lay it in cold 
water to soak for twenty-four hours if it has 
hung long, changing the water twice ; but 
twelve hours is the usual time for a York- 
shire ham. 

Before boiling, wash it thoroughly, and 
trim it neatly, remcJving any rusty parts. 
Cover it well with water, bring it gradually 
to a boil, taking care that it continues to do 
so (but not too fast), and as the scum rises 
skim the pot carefully. When it is done 
draw oft the skin, and sift bread-raspings 
over the ham. Place a frill of paper round 
the knuckle, and serve. 

To Bako a Ham. 

Time, four hours. 

503. Take a medium-sized ham, and place 
it to soak for ten or twelve hours. Then cut 
away the rusty part from underneath, wipe 



it dry, and cover it rather thickly over with 
a paste of flour and water. Put it into an 
eailhen dish, and set it in a moderately- 
heated oven for four hours. When done, 
tak-e off the crust carefully, and peel off the, 
skin, put a frill of cut paper round the 
knuckle, and raspings of bread over the fat 
of the ham, or serve it glazed and garnished 
with cut vegetables. 

Some persons infinitely prefer a baked 
ham to a boiled one, but we think it better 
boiled or steamed. 

To Soil a Leg of Fork. 

Time, a quarter of an hour for each pound, 
and half an hour over. 

504. Procure a nice small compact leg of 
pork, rub it well with salt, and let it remain 
for a week in pickle, turning and rubbing 
the pickle into it once each day. Let it lie 
for half an hour in cold water before it is 
dressed to improve the colour ; then put it 
into a large pot, or stewpan, and well cover 
it with water. Let it boil gradually, and 
skim it- frequently as the scum rises. On no 
account let it boil fast, or the meat will be 
hardened, and the knuckle end will be done 
before the thick part. When done, serve it 
on a hot dish with a garnish of turnips, or 
parsnips. A peas-pudding must be served 
with boiled leg of pork and greens as vege- 
tables. It may be boiled in a cloth dredged 
over with flour, which gives it a verydehcate 
appearance, but in that case the water in 
which it was boiled, cannot be used as a 
stock for pea-soup, and is thus wasted. 

To Choose Sacon. 

505. Excellent young bacon may be thus 
known : — the lean will be tender and of a 
bright colour ; the fat firm and white yet 
bearing a pale rose tinge, and the rind thin. 
Rusty bacon has yellow streaks in it. 

To Boil Bacon. 

Time, one hour and a half for two or three 

pounds. 

506. If very salt, soak it in soft water two 
hours before cooking. Put it into a sauce- 
pan with plenty of water, and let it boil 
gently. If a fine piece of the gammon of 
bacon, it may, when done, have the skin, 
as in hams, stripped off, and have finely- 
powdered bread-raspings strewed over it. 

Bacon and Eggs. 
Time, three quarters of an hour. 

507. A quarter of a pound of streaked 
bacon ; si.x or seven eggs ; two spoonfuls of 
gravy ; a little pepper and salt. 



To Dress Bacon. — Hand of Pork. — Tongues, &c. 131 



Cut the bacon up in thin slices, put them 
in a stewpan over a slow fire, and turn them 
frequently. Then pour off and strain the 
melted fat of the bacon into a dish, take a 
tr;7 little of it, add to it two spoonfuls of 
gravy and a little pepper and salt, break 
over it six or seven eggs. Stew the whole 
over a slow fire. Brown with a salamander, 
and serve. 

To Steam Bacon. 
Time, twenty minutes to the pound. 

508. It is a mistake to boil bacon. It 
should be steamed. No waste then takes 
place as to quantity, and the flavour is quite 
preser\'ed, while the bacon is much more 
tender, as it cannot well be spoiled by too 
quick boiling. 

Scrape the outer rind or skin well, wash the 
bacon, put it in a steamer over a pot of boil- 
ing water, and steam it for as long as re- 
quired by the weight. Serve it with veal or 
fowls, or by itself with greens. 

To Salt Larding Bacon. 

509. Bacon to be used for larding should 
be very firm and fat, and should not be 
cured with saltpetre, the effect of which is to 
redden white meats. 

Rub the pieces of bacon you wish to keep 
for larding v.ith fine salt, lay them, well 
salted, one on the other, put a weight on 
them, and leave them for six weeks in pickle, 
then have them smoked quite dry. 

Directions for larding are given in this 
work, but only practice can enable the cook 
to lard nicely. 

Pickled Pork. 

Time, three-quarters of an hour to four 
pounds. 

510. The belly part is considered delicate. 
It should be nicely streaked. Boil it gently. 
Serve it with greens as a garnish round it. 

A Hand of Pork. 
Time, one hour, 

511. If the pork should be very salt, it 
will reqtiire to be soaked for nearly two 
hours before boiling. Boil it, and serve with 
greens, and peas-pudding in a separate dish. 

Pigs' Tongues. 

512. Partially boil the tongues in order to 
remove the skin. Pickle them as you do 
hams (according to previous receipts) ; lay 
them one on the top of each other under a 
heavy weight Cover the pan in which you 
place them, and let thera remain for a week, 
jUen dry them, and put them into sau£aje 



skins. Fasten them up at the ends, and 

smoke them. 

Pig's Pettitoes. 
Time, forty minutes. 

513. Feet, heart, and liver of a pig; a 
small piece of butter (size of a walnut) ; half 
a teaspoonful of pepper ; a little salt ; one 
round of toasted bread. 

Put them in just sufficient water to cover 
them, add the heart and liver, boil them ten 
minutes, then take out the liver and heart, 
and mincG them small, return them to the 
feet, and stc.v until quite tender ; thicken 
with flour and butter, season with pepper 
and salt, and serve up with sippets of plain 
or toasted bread ; make a pyramid of the 
minced heart and liver, and lay the feet 
round them. When pettitoes are fried, 
they should be first boiled, then dipped in 
butter, and fried a light brown. 

Receipts for dressing pigs' feet and ears 
will be found amongst breakfast dishes. 

To Eoast a Pig's Head, 
Time, to roast, half an hour. 

514. Half an ounce of sage ; one table- 
spoonful of salt ; one dessertspoonful of 
pepper. 

Boil it till tender enough to take the bones 
out. Tlien chop some sage fine, mi.x it with 
the pepper and salt, and rub it over the head. 
Hang it on the spit, and roast it at a good 
fire. Baste it well. Make a good gravy 
and pour over it. Apple sauce is eaten 
with it. 

Pig's Head Boiled. 

Time, one hour and a half. 

515. This is the more profitable dish, 
though not so pleasant to the palate; it 
should first be salted, which is usually done 
by the pork butcher ; it should be boiled 
gently ; serve with vegetables. 

Pig's Cheek. 
Time, three-quarters of an hour. 

516. Pig's cheek ; one ounce of bread- 
crumbs. Boil and trim in the shape of ham, 
and, if very fat, carve it as a cockleshell ; 
glaze it well, or put over it bread-crumbs 
and brown them. 

Soyer's Metliod of Dressing a Pig's 
Cheek. 

Time, to boil, one hour and a quarter ; ten 
minutes in an oven. 

517. One cheek ; half a pint of peas ; one 
ounce of butter ; a httle pepper and salt : 
four eggs ; one ounce of biead-crumbs. ' 



132 



Brawn. — Sausasres. 



" Procure a pig's cheek nicely pickled ; 
boil well until it feels very tender. Tie half 
a pint of split peas in a cloth ; put them into 
a stewpan of boiling water. Boil them 
about half an hour. Take them out, pass 
tl:rough a hair sieve, put them into a 
stewpan with an ounce of butter, a little 
pepper and salt and four eggs, stir them 
over the fire till the eggs are partially set, 
then spread it over the pig's cheek, egg with 
a paste-brush ; sprinkle bread-crumbs over, 
place in the oven ten minutes, brown it with 
a salamander, and serve." 

This is an excellent mode of dressing it. 

To Make Brawn. 

Time, two and a half or three hours. ■ 

518. A pig's head of six or seven pounds; 
one pound and three-quarters of lean beef ; 
four or five cloves ; pepper ; salt, and Cay- 
enne pepper. 

, Well clean and wash a pig's head, and 
put it into a stewpan with about a pound 
and three-quarters of lean beef. Cover it 
with cold water, and let it boil until the 
bones can be removed, skimming it fre- 
quently. Then put the meat into a hot pan 
before the fire, and mince the beef and head 
as fine as possible, and as quickly, to prevent 
its getting cold. Season it, well with the 
spice pounded, and mix with the pepper, 
salt, and Cayenne. Stir all briskly together, 
and press it into a brawn tin or cake mould 
with a heavy weight pressed on it. Let it 
remain for five or six hours, until thoroughly 
set and quite cold. When required, dip the 
mould into boiling water, and turn the' 
brawn out on your dish. 

Pork Sausages. • 

Time, ten to twelve minutes to fry. 

519. Three pounds of young pork ; two 
pounds and a half of suet ; two tablespoon- 
fuls of chopped sage ; the peel of one lemon ; 
one tablespoonful of sweet herbs ; one nut- 
meg; one tenspoonful of pcpjjer; one of salt. 

Take the pork, free from skin, gristle, and 
fat, cut it very small, and beat it fine in a 
mortar ; chop the suet and the sage as fine 
as possible. Spread the pounded meat on a 
clean pasteboard, and shake the sage over, 
it, the peel of a lemon chopped fine, and the 
sweet herbs ; grate over it one nutmeg, and 
add the pepper and salt ; then strew over it 
the suet, and mix all thoroughly together. 
Put it into a jar, and cover it over for use. 
When required, roll it up with a beaten egg, 
make it the size of sausages, and fry them in 
boiling butter or dripping, rolling them 
about in the pan ; when a nice light brown, 
serve them up hot. 



Veal sausages, or veal mixed with pork, 
can be made in this manner ; or skins may 
be filled with the sausage meat. 

Oxford Sansages. 

520. One pound of lean veal ; one pound 
of young pork ; one pound of beef suet ; 
half a pound of grated bread ; peel of half a 
lemon ; one nutmeg grated ; six sage leaves ; 
one teaspoonful of pepper ; two of salt ; a 
sprig of tliyme, savoiy, and marjoram. 

Take a pound of lean veal, and the same 
quantity of young pork, fat and lean to- 
gether, free from skin and gristle, and a 
pound of beef suet ; chop all separately as 
fine as possible, and then mix together ; add 
the grated bread, the peel of half a lemon 
shred fine, a nutmeg grated, a teaspoonful 
of pepper, two of salt, and the sage leaves, 
thyme, savory, and marjoram, all .chopped 
as fine as you can ; mix all thoroughly to- 
gether, and press it down into a prepared 
skin. When you use .them, fry them in 
fresh butter a fine brown. Serve as hot as 
possible. 

Oxford Sausages without Skins. 

521. One pound and a half of pig meat 
cut from the griskin, without any skin ; half 
a pound. of veal ; one pound and a half of 
beef suet ; the yolks and whites of five eggs; 
a dessertspoonful of sifted sage, after being 
well dried ; one teaspoonful of pepper ; two 
teaspoonfuls of salt. 

Chop the above ingredients into small 
pieces and then pound them together till 
they are short and tender ; chop the suet 
very fine, separately from the rest. When 
the eggs are well beaten together, and the 
white specks are taken out, pour them over 
the pounded meat and chopped suet ; well 
knead it together with the hand, throwing in 
the sifted sage, pepper, and salt, from a 
coarse pepper-box gradually, so as to flavour 
the whole mass. Press the meat, when well 
mixed, into a wide-mouthed jar; cover it, 
and keep it from the air in a cold place. 
Egg and roll the sausages on a floured 
board, and use little or no grease in frying 
them, as they contain sufficient without any 
addition.

Time, to fry, ten minutes. 

523. Three parts of pork to one of beef; 
four ounces of salt and one of pepper to every 
ten pounds of sausage meat. 

Chop the pork and the beef nicely to- 
gether, and mix it well up with the season- 
ing. Put tlie sausages into muslin bags, tie 
them close, and hang them in a dry, cool 
cellar. When the meat is wanted for use, 
c^^ it, cut it in slices, flour the outsides of 
each, and fiy them in hot butter. Let them 
be nicely broNvned. Serve them round 
mashed potatoes, or on sliced toast for 
breakfast.

gether, the same each of beef, pork, and 
veal, chop all very fine, and mix it with 
tliree-quarters of a pound of finely-chopped 
beef suet, sage leaves, and sweet herbs ; 
season it highly with pepper and salt. Tlien 
fill a large skin, and put it into a saucepan 
of boihng water, pricking the skin for fear of 
its bursting ; let it boil slowly for an hour, 
and then place it on straw to dry. 

Saveloys,

pickle for three days, then mince it up very 
fine, and season it with pepper, and twelve 
sage leaves chopped as small as possible ; 
add to it the grated bread, and mix it all 
well together, fill the skins, and bake them 
in a slow oven for half an liour. They may 
be eatea hot or cold. 

To Fry Sausages. 
Time, twelve minutes. 

526. Pork sausages ; and a piece of butter. 



Prick the sausages very lightly with the 
prong of a fork, and put them into a frying- 
pan with a piece of butter over a clear fire, 
shake the pan frequently, and turn the 
sausages, that they may be browned all 
over. The time depends on the size of the 
sausages, as, if very large, a quarter of an 
hour will be required to cook them. When 
done, serve them on toasted bread, or ar- 
ranged round mashed potatoes pressed into 
a mould, the sausages as a border. If pre- 
ferred, sausages may be put into a saucepan 
of boiling water and allowed to simmer 
slowly for the same time. 

Black Puddings. 

Time, to soak, one night; to boil, half an 
hour. 

527. Rather more than one quart of blood; 
one quart of whole groats ; crumb of a quar- 
tern loaf; two quarts of new milk ; a small 
bunch of winter savory and thyme, about

of salt ; one tcaspoonful of pepper ; six 
cloves ; half a tcaspoonful of allspice ; half 
a nutmeg; a httle grated ginger; three 
pounds of beef suet; six eggs; three ounces 
of pork fat. 

Stir the hot blood with salt till it is quite 
cold, put a quart of it or rather more to a 
quart of whole groats, to soak one night. 
Soak the crumb of a quartern loaf in rather 
more than two quarts of new milk made hot. 
Chop fine a little winter savory and thyme ; 
beat up and strain six eggs; cliop 'three 
pounds of beef suet ; mix the suet, the herbs, 
and the seasoning of pepper, salt, allspice, 
cloves, gmger, and nutmeg together with 
the eggs. Then add to it and beat up with 
it, the groats, and soaked bread, &c. When 
well mixed, have ready some skin-bags, as 
for sausages, but much larger (we suppose, 
of course, that they have been well cleaned 
and soaked), put the mixture into these 
bags ; but as you do so, add at regular dis- 
tances pork fat cut into large dice. Tie the 
skins_ in links only half-filled, and boil the 
puddmgs in a large kettle, pricking tliem as 
they swell, or they will burst. When boiled, 
dry them in clean cloths and hang them up. 

To cook them for eating, scaki them for 
a few minutes in water, and cook them in a 
Dutch oven. 

White Puddings. 
Time, twenty minutes. 
528. One teacupful of rose-water for soak- 
ing the skins ; half a pound of blanched 
almonds; one pound of grated bread; two 
pounds of marrow or suet ; one pound of 
currants; a httle beaten cinnamon; six

cloves ; half a blade of mace ; one quarter 
of a nutmeg ; one quart of cream ; six eggs; 
two ounces of fine white sugar ; half a lemon 
peel ; half an ounce of citron sliced. 

Take care that the skins are very nicely 
cleaned, as directed for sausages, only in 
tliis instance rinse and soak thcni also all 
night in rose-water. Mix half a pound of 
blanched almonds chopped fine with a pound 
of grated bread, two pounds of marrow or 
chopped suet, a pound of currants, some 
beaten cinnamon, cloves, mace, and nut- 



meg, a quart of cream, the yollis of six and 
the whites of two eggs, a little fine white 
sugar, and some Iciuon peel and citron 
sliced. Mix all idcll together and fill the 
skins with the mixture, not /<70 full, however, 
lest tliey should burst. Boil these puddings 
in milk and water carefully for about twenty 
minutes, prick tiiem with a small fork as 
tliey rise, to prevent the skin from cracking. 
Wiien they are done, lay them on a cloth 
to dry. 'Iliis is a nice sweet dish for lun- 
cheon. 



VENISON. 



There are three kinds of venison in Great 
Britain. The red deer, the fallow deer, and 
the roebuck, peculiar to Scotland as the red 
deer now is to Ireland. 

The flesh of the fallow deer is the best. 
Venison should be dark, finely grained, and 
llmi, with a good coaling of fat. It requires 
to be well hung in a cold, dry larder. 

Hauach of Venison. 

Time, three to four hours, 
gag. Haunch from twenty to twenty-five 
pounds. 

I'liis joint is trimmed by cutting off part 
of the knuckle and sawing off the chine 
bone, then the flap is folded over, and it is 
covered with a paste made of flour and 
water. This paste should be about an inch 
thick. Tie it up in strong and very thick 
paper, and place it in a cradle spit very close 
to the fire till the paste is well hardened or 
crusted, pouring a few ladlefuls of hot drip- 
ping over it occasionally to prevent the 
paper from catching fire. Then move it 
further from the fire, take care that your fire 
is a very good one, clear and strong. When 
the venison has roasted for about four hours 
take it up, remove the paper and paste, and 
run a thin skewer in to see if it is done 
enough. If the skev.er goes in easily it is 
dressed, if not put it down again, as it de- 
pends greatly on the strengtli of the fire for 
so large a joint. Wlien it is dressed, glaze 
the top and salamander it. Put a frill round 
the knuckle, and serve veiy hot with strong 
gravy. Red currant jelly in a glass dish or 
a tureen. Vegetables : French beans. 

Keck of Venison. 

Time, a quarter of an hour for a pound. 

530. Cover it with paste and paper as for 
the haiinch, fix it on a spit and roast. 



To Hash Venison. 

Time, one hour and a half. 

531. Some cold roast venison ; three 
tablespoonfuls of port wine ; a little mutton 
broth; half of a shallot ; a pinch of Cayenne ; 
one ounce and a half of butter ; a spoonful 
of flour; and salt to taste. 

Cut some cold venison into nice slices, 
and season them lightly with salt ; put the 
bones, trimmings, any cold gravy from the 
venison, and as much broth as you may 
require into a stewpan, and let it simmer 
slowly for quiie an hour, then stniin it off; 
stir tlie butter and flour over the fire until 
sufficiently brown to cc-lour the gravy, taking 
care it does not burn. Pour the gravy from 
the bones, add the port wine, and let it 
sinmier until it boils. Tlien draw the stew- 
pan to the side of the fire, put in the slices 
of venison, and when thoroughly hot serve it 
up, with red currant jelly in a glass dish. 
Garnish with forcemeat balls about the size 
of a marble. 

To Broil Venison Steaks. 
Time, to broil, fifteen minutes. 

532. Venison steaks ; a piece of butter 
j the size of an egg to each pound of meat; 
I pepper ; salt ; currant jelly ; two table- 
j spoonfuls of wine. 

Let the gridiron become hot, rub the bars 

I with a piece of beef suet ; then lay the steaks 

' on it, having first dipped them in flour or 

! rolled biscuits. Set it over a clear but not 

fierce fire. When one side is done take the 

steak carefully up and liold it over the steak 

dish, so that the blood may fall into it; then 

turn the other side on the gridiron, and let it 

broil nicely. Set the steak dish wliere it will 

become hot, put on it a piece of butter the 

size of an tigf, for each pound of venison, add 

a saltspooni'ul of salt, the same of black 

pepper, and a little currant jelly made liquid

with the wine, lay this mixture on the hot 
steaks, and turn them once or twice in the 
gravy ; or they may be broiled on both 
sides, well seasoned, and thin shces of lemon 
laid over them on the dish. 

Cutlets of Ve-nison. 
Time, twenty minutes. 
533. A few lardoons ; a sprig of thyme 



and parsley ; two carrots ; one onion ; a 
little glaze ; one gill of gravy. 

Cut the venison into nice shapes, and lard 
each cutlet, lay them in a stewpan with the 
herbs and the vegetables sliced. When they 
arc dressed, glaze them and serve with 
sauce piquante. 



POTTLTRY. 



In London poultry is bought ready trussed 
from tlie poulterer'; nevertheless, it often 
happens that the cook has turkeys, fowls, 
&c. &c., sent from the country to pick and 
prepare herself, and thus a knowledge of 
trassing is absolutely necessary. 

At the head of the several directions or 
receipts for dressing poultry and game which 
are here offered, there will, therefore, be 
found full and ample instmctions as to truss- 
ing and preparing the birds. 

It has been thought more convenient for 
the reader of this work, to put both trussing 
and cooking directions on the same page, 
rather than for her to have the trouble of 
turning back for the former to another part 
of the book. Tiie coloured engravings will 
serve to exemplify the verbal teaching, and 
render the art of trussing easy to every com- 
prehension. 

All poultry should be carefully picked ; 
every plug or stub removed, and the birds 
carefully singed with a piece of lighted white 
paper. French cooks hold them over a 
flame to remove the down, thinking that 
lighted paper is apt to blacken the skin. 

Poultry should be drawn carefully, taking 
care that the gall bag and the gut joining 
the gizzard are not broken. Tlie liver and 
gizzard will be required under the pinions of 
the bird ; but open the gizzard first and 
remove the contents, and detach the gall 
bladder from the liver. Fowls should be 
drawn through the vent. 

Take care to roast poultry by a brisk clear 
fire, a slow fire will spoil them. 

The time given with each receipt for 
dressing the birds, must be always under- 
stood with the modifications required by the 
different sizes of the same. 



General Table of Time for Roasting 
Foultry. 

Turkey of ten pounds' weight, stuffed, two 
hours ; larger, two hours and a half; smaller 
one; one hour and fifteen minutes. 



Large fowl, one hour; smaller, three- 
quarters of an hour. 

Chicken, from twenty minutes to half an 
hour. 

Duck, from three-quarters of an hour to 
one hour. 

Ducklings, from twenty-five to thirty-five 
minutes. 

A capon, full size, one hour. 

A goose, one hour and three-quarters ; 
small goose, one hour and a half. 

Pigeon, from twenty to twenty-five 
minutes. 

To boil, about the same time. 

Eoast Turkey. 

In season from December to February. 
Time, according to size, from one hour and 

fifteen minutes to two hours, or two hours 

and a half. 

534. Half a pint of forcemeat for veal, or 
sausage meat ; a little butter. 

To truss the bird : pick the bird carefully, 
and singe off the down with a piece of lighted 
white paper ; break the leg bones close to 
the feet ; hang it on a hook and draw out 
the strings from the thigh ; cut the neck off 
close to the back, but leave the crop skin 
long enough to turn over the back ; remove 
the crop, and with the middle finger loosen 
the lis'er and the gut at the throat end. Cut 
off the vent, remove the gut, take a crooked 
wire and pull out the gizzard, and tlie liver 
will easily follow. But be very careful not 
to break the gall bladder ; if you do it will 
spoil trie flavour of the bird entirely, by 
giving it a bitter taste, which no after effort 
of washing, &c. can remove. Do not break 
the gut joining the gizzard either, lest the 
inside slfould become gritty. Wipe the 
inside perfectly clean with a wet cloth, then 
cut the breast bone through on each side 
close to the back, and draw the legs close 
to the crop. Put a cloth on the breast, and 
beat the breast bone down with a rolling-pin 
till it lies flat. Scald the leet, peel oft the 



136 Roast Turkey— 'Boiled Turkey— Turkey Hashed. 



outer skin, and cut away the claws ; leave 
the legs on. 

■ Fill the inside with veal stuffing or sausage 
meat {see Forcemeat), and either sew the skin 
of the neck over the back with a trussing 
needle, or fasten it with a very small skewer. 
Then run a long skewer into the pinion and 
thigh through tlie body, passing it through 
the opposite pinion and thigh. On the 
other side put a skewer in tlie small part of 
the leg, close on the outside of the sidesman, 
and push it through. Clean the liver and 
gizzard and tuck them between the pinions, 
and turn the point of the pinions on the 
back. . Pass a string over the points of the 
skewers, and tie it securely at the back to 
keep the bird neat and firmly trussed. Cover 
the breast with a sheet of nicely buttered 
white paper. 

Place tlie bird on the spitpr roasting jack, 
and set it at some distance from the fire, 
which should be a very good and bright one. 
Keep the heat well to the breast. Put a 
quarter of a pound of butter in the dripping- 
paii, and baste it frequently to prevent it from 
drying too much. Just before it is finished 
dressing, remove the paper, dredge it lightly 
with flour, and baste it with the butter, 
so as to brown and froth it. Serve it with 
good brown gravy poured over it, and gar- 
nish with small fried sausages or forcemeat 
balls. Sauce : bread sauce. 

Eoast Turkey witli Chestnuts. 
Time, one hour and three-quarters to two 

hours and a half, according to size. 

535. Fifty chestnuts ; marrow from mar- 
row bones ; a htde butter; flour; and salt. 

Truss a turkey for roasting. Boil half a 
hundred of chestnuts till tender ; remove the 
shell ; peel them and chop them very fine. 
Take tha marrow of two marrow bones, cut 
it into pieces and stuff the inside of tlie 
turkey with the marrow and chestnuts. Fix 
a buttered paper over the breast ; put it 
down to a good fire, and baste it constantly 
all the time it is roasting. Tlien take off the 
paper, baste the turkey well with butter, 
sprinkle a little salt over it, and dredge it 
with flour to froth it. When done, take it 
' up, pour over it a little chestnut sauce, and 
serve it with brown gravy separately. It will 
take a quarter of an hour longer roasting 
than when dressed without the marrow and 
chestnuts. 

Sauce : bread satiee. 

Boiled Turkey. 
Hen turkeys are best for boiling; they 
should hang quite four days before they 
are dressed. 



Time, large turkey, one hour and three- 
quarters ; smaller, one hour and a half. 

536. To truss a boiled turkey. 

Cut the first joint of the legs off, pass the 
middle finger into the inside, raise the skin 
of the legs, and put them under the apron 
of the bird. 

Put a skewer into the joint of the wing 
and the middle joint of the leg, and run it 
through the body and the otlier leg and 
wing. The liver and gizzard must be put 
in the pinions. Then turn the small end of 
the pinion on the back, and tie a pacicthread 
over the ends of the legs to keep them in 
their places. Having trussed the turkey for 
boiling, put it, wrapped in a clean cloth, 
into sufficient hot water to more than cover 
it. Bring it gradually to a boil, and care- 
fully remove the scum as it rises, or it will 
spoil the appearance of the bird. Let it 
simmer very gently for an hour and a half, 
or for a longer time if of a large size. When 
done, serve it on a hot disii, with a httle 
celery sauce, oyster sauce, or with parsley 
and butter ; put a small quantity of either 
over it, and send the otlier up in a tureen . 
separately. 

Turkey Stewed with Celery. 
Time, altogether two hours and a quarter. 

537. A turkey ; four large heads of celery ; 
a cupful of cream ; a piece of butter the size 
of a walnut well rolled in florir. 

Choose a fine hen turkey, stuff it with veal 
stuffing, and truss it as for boiling. Put it 
into a large stewpan filled with water, and 
let it boil until tender. Take up the turkey 
with sufficient of the water in which it has 
been boiled to keep it hot. Wash the celery 
and put it into a stewpan with the other por- 
tion of the water in which the turkey was 
boiled, and let it stew until tender, which 
will be in about twenty-five minutes. Then 
take it out, and put in the turkey bieast 
downwards, and let it stew for a quarter of 
an hour. Place it wlien done on a hot dish 
before the fire. Thicken the sauce witli a 
lump of butter rolled in flour and a large 
cupful of cream. Put in the celery to warm 
again, and then pour the sauce and th.c 
celery o\er the turkey. 

Turkey Hashed. 
Time, one hour for the gravy. 

538. Cold roast turkey ; pepper ; salt ; 
half a pint of gra^'y ; a piece of butter the 
size of a walnut ; a little flour ; a spoonful 
of ketchup ; peel of half a lemon. 

Cut the breast of a cold turkey, or any of 
the white meat, into thin slices. Cut oft" the 



'Tiiyhey Poults— Roast Go6S6—Stmed Giblets. 137 



legs, score them, dredge lliem with pepper 
and salt, and broil them over a clear fire a 
nice brown. Put half a pint of gravy into a 
stewpan with a little piece of butter rolled in 
flour, a spoonful of ketchup, some pepper 
and salt, and the peel of half a lemon shred 
very fine. Put in the turkey, and shake it 
over a clear fire till it is thoroughly hot, 
place it in a dish with the broiled legs' on 
the top, and sippets of fried bread round it. 

Turkey Poults. 

In season from June to October. 

Time, one hour. 

i;39. Butter sufficient for basting ; a dred- 
ging of flour. 

To trass : — Take the neck out of the skin 
— i.e., cut off the neck, but leave the head 
attached to the body by the neckskin. Draw 
the bird as you do a turkey. Put a skewer 
through the joint of the pinion, with the legs 
up close, run the skewer through the middie 
of the ^eg, through the body, and do tJie 
same oh the other side. 

Cut off the under part of the bill, twist 
the skin of the neck round and round, and 
tuck the head under the wing with the bill 
end forward. Another skewer must then be 
put into the sidesman, and the legs placed 
between the sidesman and the apron on each 
side. Pass the skewer through all ; cut off 
the toe-nails. It is optional whether you use 
the liver and gizzard or not. 

Put it down to roast, placing a buttered 
paper over the breast, and keep it constantly 
basted to prevent it from becoming dry. Just 
be.'bre it is done, take off the paper, dredge 
a little flour over it, and baste it with butter 
to froth it nicely. Serve it with gravy 
poured over it, and send in some separately 
in a tureen. 

To Broil the Legs of a Turkey. 
Time, a quarter of an hour. 

540. The legs of a turkey; a little pepper, 
salt, Cayenne ; and a squeeze of a lemon. 

Take the legs from a cold roast turkey, 
make some incisions across them with a 
sharp knife, and season them with a little 
pepper, salt, and a pinch of Cayenne. 
Squeeze over them a little lemon juice, and 
place them on a gridiron well buttered, over 
a clear fire. When done a nice brown, 
put them on a hot dish with a piece of 
butter on the top of each, and serve them up 
very hot. 

Pulled Turkey. 

Time, twenty minutes. 

541. Two spoonfuls of white gravy ; one 



of cream ; grated nutmeg ; salt ; butter. ' 
and flour. 

Pull the meat with a fork from the breast 
of a cold turkey, and make it hot in a stew- 
pan with two spoonfuls of gTa\'y, one of 
cream, a piece of butter dredged with flour, 
and a seasoning of salt and nutmeg. Serve 
up hot. 

To Truss a Goose for Eoasting. ' 

542. Pick and stub it clean. Cut the feet 
off at the joint, and the pinion off at the 
first joint. 

Cut off the neck close to the back, leaving 
the skin of the neck long enough to turn 
over the back. Pull cut the throat and tie 
a knot at the end. Loosen the liver, &c., at 
the breast end with the middle finger, and 
cut it open between the vent and rump. 
Draw out all the entrails except the soal or 
soul, wipe out the inside with a clean cloth. 
Beat the breastbone flat with a rwlling-pin, 
put a skewer into the wing, and draw the 
legs up close, put a skewer through the 
middle of the legs and through the body, 
do the same on the other side. Put another 
skewer in the small of the leg, tuck it close 
down to the sidesman, run it through, and 
do the same on the other side. Cut off the 
end of the vent, and make a hole large 
enough for the passage of the rump, as by 
that means you will better secure the season- 
ing in its place. 

To Soast a Goose. 

Time, a large goose, two hours ; a smaller 
one, one hour and a half. 

543. Sage and onion stuflSng ; some good 
gravy. 

After the goose is preparad for roasting, 
fill it with sage and onion stuffing, and 
fasten it in securely at both ends by passing 
the rump through a slit made in the skin, 
and tying the skin of the neck into the back

them to secure the shape. They must not 
be drawn. Put them on a lark spit and tie 
them on another spit, v.itli a layel' of bacon 
nnd vine leaves between them and over the 
breasts, and roast them for about twenty 
minutes, or rather more, before a clear fire, 
basting them frequently with butter ; toast 
a round of bread and put it under the birds 
to receive their droppings. When done, 
serve them on the toast cut into squares ; a 
good gravy poured round them, and a 
garnish of crumbs of bread crisped before 
the fire, or with watercresses if you have 
them ; with some plain gravy or melted 
butter, with the juice of half a lemon 
squeezed into it, in separate tureens. 

TEAL. 

To Truss Teal. 

621. Pick the bird carefully ; twist each 
leg at the knuckle ; rest the claws on each 
side of the breast, and secure them by 
passing a skewer through the thighs and 
pinions of the wings. 

To Koast Teal. 
Time, ten to fifiecn minutes. 

622. Teal should not be eaten till after 
the first frost, and should be plump and fat. 
Roast them before a briglit hot fire, and 
baste them very frequently with butter. 
Serve with orange sauce. Garnish with 
watercresses. Send up a cut lemon on a 
plate with them, and a tureen of sauce or 
brown gravy. 

WIDGEONS. 

To be trussed the same as wild duck and 
teal. 



To Eoast Widgeons. 
Time, eighteen or twenty minutes. 

623. Roast these birds before a good fire ; 
flour them and baste them continuously 
with butter. Send them to table very hot 
with brown gravy round them, or the gravy 
in a separate tureen. Send up a cut lemon 
with them. 

Many persons prefer all game birds very 
under-dressed, "just shown the fire," they 
say. Our time allows for thorough dressing. 



To Keep Game &om Tainting. 

624. Game may often be made fit for 
eating when apparently spoiled, by nicely 
cleaning it and washing it with vinegar and 
water. 

If you have birds which you fear will not 
keep, pick and empty them ; rinse them, 
and rub them over with salt outside and in ; 
have in readiness a kettle of boiling water 
and plunge them in one by one, holding 
them by the legs and drawing them up and 
down, so that the water may pa?s through 
them, let them remain in it for five or six 
minutes, then hang them in a cool place ; 
when perfectly drained, rub them outside 
and inside with black pepper, or better still, 
lightly powder them wiih charcoal. The 
most delicate birds may be preserved in this 
May. I'horoughly wash them before roast- 
ing or otherwise cooking them. 

Pieces of charcoal put about meat or 
birds will preserve them from taint, and 
restore them when spoilt. Poultry or game 
drawn and wi]3ed dry, and a knob of char- 
coal put into the body and powdered over 
the outside of each, will keep them nicely, 
or they may be kept in an ice safe. Pepper 
secures them from flies. 



MADE DISHES, ENTREES, &c., &c. 



" In the hands of an expert cook," says 
^fajendie, "alimentary substances are made 
almost to change their nature, form, con- 
sistence, odour, savour, colour, chemical 
composition, &c. ; everything is so modified 
that it is often impossible for the most ex- 
quisite sense of taste to recognise the sub- 
stance which makes up the basis of certain 
dishes." 

This is especially true of made dishes. 
There is a good old story of a French gen- 
tleman laying a bet with an epicure friend 
of his that he would not detect the basis of 
a niado dish which his copk should prepare. 



The bet was accepted — and lost ! The 
basis of the dish being a pair of old white 
kid gloves. So runs the legend in honour 
of good cookery which can make the most 
intractable substances tender by skill and 
care. Made dishes require bot/t to be eat- 
able and nice-looking ; a greasy, badly- 
flavoured dish is an insult to those to whom 
it is offered. It is far better to send up 
meat or fish in its plainest form well done, 
than to serve some of the messes occa- 
sionally prepared by bad cooks — in which 
the gravy or sauce has tlie appearance of a 
paste, tastes of grease or flour, and has one

Rissoles of Lobster. — Beef au Miroton. 



predominating flavour strong enough to be 
unpleasant. 

However, it is possible to prepare made 
dishes nicely. If a lady has only an in- 
ferior cook, she should see to their prepara- 
tion herself, as a delicate palate is required, 
or an e.xperienced one, for judging of fla- 
vours and seasoning. 

In the receipts we are about to offer, the 
tifne must be considered as capable of being 
slightly modified by the degree of heat of 
either the fire or hot stove -to which the 
preparation is subjected. Pepper and salt 
should be used with caution. Soyer advised 
sprtJikltng them in from the fingers, not 
throwing them in from the spoon. 

The genius of a cook is shown in made 
dishes ; his taste, in preparing them for the 
eye as well as for the palate. All made 
dishes should be served as hot as possible. 

Bissoles of Lobster.

625. One lobster ; bread-crumbs ; two 
ounces of butter ; yolks of two eggs ;

mace, pepper, and salt, add two ounces of 
melted butter and a sufficient quantity of 
bread-crumbs to make it into balls, brush 
them over with the yolk of a well-beaten 
egg, strew bread-cnmibs thickly over them, 
and fry in boiling fat a nice brown. Serve 
them in a dish v.ith some good gravy.

into a basin, and add to it half a pint of 
milk, and two well-beaten eggs ; stir in by 
degrees flour enough to make a smooth but 
rather thin batter ; when perfectly free from 
lumps put the oysters into it. Have some 
beef dripping or butter made hot in a very 
clean frying-pan, and season with a little 
salt, and when it is boiling drop in the batter 
with a large spoon, putting one or more 
oysters in each spoonful. Hold the pan 
over a gentle fire until one side of the batter 
is a delicate brown, turn each fritter sepa- 
rately, and when both sides are done place 
them on a hot dish, and serve.

Take three or four dozen oysters and 
blanch them, and after you have taken off 
the beards and hard parts, cut the remain- 
ing parts into small pieces. Chop the same 
quantity of chicken or white meat with two 
or three mushrooms. Make some sauce 
with the liquor the oysters were blanched in, 
and reduce it till it is very thick, adding a 
little cream — in fact, make a sauce as you 
would for croquettes — add to it the oysters, 
white meat, and mushrooius ; add three 
yolks of eggs, stir it over the fire, and when 
it is done, spread the mixture on a dish to 
be put away till it is cold. When it is cold, 
roll it into pieces rather smaller than corks, 
each piece must then be rolled neatly in 
slices of fat bacon cut as thin as writing- 
paper. A few minutes before serving, you 
must dip the Kromeskies in a nice light 
frying batter, and fry them in fresh lard. 
Serve them immediately, garnished with 
fried parsley.

quite drain off. The rice ought to be stirred 
•with a fork that the grains may be separated. 
It ought to be boiled in a large quantity of 
water, and it will be sufficiently cooked when 
the grains become a little soft, and overdone 
if they at all stick together. Ricp should 
alway be served in a separate dish from the 
currie.

square; the best part for the purpose are 
cutlets fiom the leg, as there must not be 
any bone or fat. Put the pieces of meat into 
a stewpan, add an onion previously fried in 
butter, and a clove of garlic chopped fine. 
Sprinkle over the meat a spoonful (or two if 
the currie is required to be very hot) of currie

them with about two or three ounces of but- 
ter to keep them from burning. When the 
onions become soft and the ballachony dry, 
take it out and let it cool. To keep it any 
length of time, it must be put in jars with 
orange leaves on the top, and closed up with 
bladder. 

Bobotee. 
Time, half an hour. 

702. One onion ; one ounce of butter ;

in England, and it is remarkably deacate 
and nice. 



Meat Pies and Puddings.

MEAT PIES AND PUDDINGS. 



We believe that it is utterly impossible to 
teach verbally liow to make good paste or 
pie-crust ; a lesson from a good cook would 
be worth whole volumes on this subject. 
Some general directions, however, may be 
given on this important art. First, the cook 
should have smooth cold hands — very clean 
— for making paste or crust. She should 
wash them well, and plunge them in cold 
water for a minute or two in hot weather be- 
fore beginning her paste, drjing them well 
afterwards. 

The pastry slab, if possible, should be 
made of marble ; if it is a wooden paste- 
board, it should be kept scnipulously clean. 

The crust used for homely pies need not 
be as delicate as that used for company ; it 
may be made of clarified beef dripping or 
lard instead of butter. 

Be very careful about the proper heat of 
the oven for baking pies, as if it be too cold 
the paste will be heavy, and have a dtill look; 
if too hot, the crust will bum before the pie 
is done. 

Try if the oven is hot enough by holding 
your hand inside it for a few seconds ; if you 
can do so without snatching it out again 
quickly, it is too cold. It is best, however, 
to try it by baking a httle piece of the crust 
in it first. 

Always make a small hole with a knife at 
the top of the pie to allow the gases gene- 
rated in it by the cooking to escape. This 
aperture is also useful for pouring graA")' into 
the pie when it is done, if more is required. 
The hand of a pastr\-cook should be light, 
and the paste should not be wtrked more 
than is absolutely required for mi.xing it. 

We give first three plain receipts for pie- 
crust, such as people of small means can 
use, and will find good — a puff paste (by 
Soyer), and one which will be found good 
enough for all ordinary purposes, of butter, 
flour, and i^gg, the last made stiff — will also 
suit raised pies. 

We begin by giving instructions for clari- 
fying dripping, so as to render it fit for 
making pie-crusts. I 

To Clarify Beef Dripping. | 

703. Put the dripping into a basin, pour . 
over it some boiling water, and stir it round I 
with a silver spoon ; set it to cool, and then 
remove the dripping from the sediment, and 
put it into basins or jars for use in a cool 
place. Clarified dripping may be used for 
frying and basting everything except game 
or poultry, as well as for pies, &c 



To Make a Short Ci'ust with Drippiag- 
Ko. 1. 

704. One pound of flour ; three-quarters 
of a pound of clarified beef dripping ; one 
wineglassful of very cold water ; a pinch of 
salt. 

Take care that the water you use is cold, 
especially in summer. Put the flour, well 
dried, into a large basin (which should be 
kept for the purpose) with a pinch of salt ; 
break up the clarified beef dripping into 
pieces, and mi.x them well with the flour, 
rubbing them together till they are a fine 
powder. Then make a hole in the middle 
of the flour, and pour in water enough to 
make a smooth and flexible paste. Sprinkle 
the pasteboard with flour, and your hands 
also, take out the lump of paste, roll it out, 
fold it together again, and roll it out ; fold 
it again, and roll it out — i.e., roll it three 
times ; the last time it should be of the thick- 
ness required for your crust, that is, about a 
quarter of an inch, or even thinner. It is 
then ready for use. 

Or, a still Plainer Cmst for Children— 
Ko. 2. 

705. One pound of flour ; five or six 
ounces of clarified beef dripping ; and a cup- 
ful of water. 

Put the flour into a bowl, and work it into 
a smooth paste with about a cupful of water. 
Divide the clarified dripping into three parts, 
roll out the paste, and put over it, in rows, 
one portion of the dripping bioken into 
pieces the size of a bean ; flour it, fold over 
the edges, and again roll it ; repeat this fold- 
ing, spreading, and rolling three times, 
dredging a very little flour over the paste 
and rolling-pin each time. It will be fit for 
any common purpose, or for children. 

Or, Dripping Cmst— Ko. 3. 

706. One pound of flour ; five or six ounces 
of good beef dripping ; a large pinch of 
salt ; one egg ; water to moisten. 

Put the flour into a bowl, and work into 
it five or si.x ounces of good beef drivpi* g 
until as fine as the flour, add a pinch of sail, 
and mix the whole into a paste with one 
beaten &gg and enough cold water ; roll it 
out thin, and use it lor meat pies, &c. If 
for fruit or jam tarts add an ounce and a 
half of sifted loaf sugar. 

To Make Plain Crust with lard— Ho. 4. 

707. One pound of flour ; three-quarters 
of a pound Qf lard ; a pinch of salt. 



164 Modes of Making Plain Crusts and Puff Paste. 



Rub a little of the lard into the flour in 
the basin, a pinch of salt, and moisten it 
•with water till it is a stiff paste ; take it 
out, lay it on the floured pasteboard, flour 
the roller, and roll it out. Lay small knobs 
of lard dented into the paste in alternate 
rows all over the flat surface, then flour it, 
and fold over the edges all round till they 
meet in the centre; turn the roll of paste 
over, and roll it out again; repeat the 
spreading alternate rows of lard, flour it, 
and fold up the edges again. Roll it out 
a third time, spread the knobs of lard, flour 
it, fold it, and roll it out to the thickness 
required. 

A Light Puif Paste-No. 5. 

708. One pound of flour ; half a pound 
of butter; half a pound of lard; water to 
moisten it ; a pinch of salt. 

Rub a litde of the flour into the basin with 
a pinch of salt, then rub in a few knobs of 
butter ; put in the salt ; add water enough 
to make it into a stiff paste, then flour the 
pasteboard and your hands. Take out the 
paste, flour the roller, and roll it out to a 
thin flat surface. Spread over it in alternate 
rows knobs of butter and lard, fold it over 
from the edges, and let it stand in a very 
cool place for half an hour. Then roll if out 
again, sprinkle a little flour over it, and add 
another layer of alternate knobs of butter 
and lard. Let it stand for ten minutes. 
Roll and butter it twice, without letting it 
stand between the two last times. Roll it 
thinner for mince pies, which this crust suits 
very well. 

Common Puff Paste— American. 

709. One pound of sifted flour ; a quarter 
of a pound of lard; half a teaspoonful of 
salt ; half a pound of butter. 

Put one pound of sifted flour on the slab, 
or in an earthen basin, make a hollow in the 
centre, work into it a quarter of a pound of 
lard and half a teaspoonful of salt. When it 
is mixed through the flour, add as much cold 
water as will bind it together, then strew a 
little flour over the pasteboard or table; 
flour the rolling-pin, and roll out the paste 
to half an inch in thickness ; divide half a 
pound of butter in three parts ; spread one 
evenly over the paste, fold it up, dredge a 
little flour over it and the paste-slab or table; 
roll it out again, spread another portion of 
the butter over, and fold and roll again ; so 
continue until all the butter is used ; roll it 
out to a quarter of aA is«fe in tliicfeiess for 
use* 



Benton Puff Paste. 

710. Five ounces of beef dripping to one 
pound of flour, mi.xed with hot water, but 
rot boihng. Put together lightly on the 
paste-board with a knife, and with the hands 
only to finish off. If the quantity makes 
more than is required it will keep well for 
two or three days. The great secret m 
making pastry well is to mix it lightly and 
make as quickly as possible. 

Puff Paste— Very Good. 

711. A quarter of a pound of butter; 
half a pound of lard ; half a pound of flour; 
a little salt ; all to be chopped up together 
and mixed with cold water till a proper 
stiffness, roll it out, and in making, use a 
knife, and not the hand. Make it in a cold 
place. 

Suet Crust for Puddings. . 

712. One pound of flour ; six ounces of 
beef suet ; a cupful of cold water. 

Strip the skin from the suet, chop it as 
fine as possible, rub it well into the flour, 
mix it with a knife, work it to a very smooth 
paste with a cupful of water, and roll it out 
for use. 

Common Crust for Eaised Pies. 

'713. Two pounds and a half of flour; 

three-quarters of a pint of water ; four 

ounces of butter ; four ounces of lard ; 

half a saltspoonful of salt. 

Put two pounds and a half of fine flour 
on the pasteboard, and put into a stewpan 
three-quarters of a pint of water with the 
above proportions of butter and lard. When 
the water boils, make a hole in the middle 
of the flour, pour in the water, butter, and 
lard by degrees, gently mixing the whole 
with a wooden spoon. When it is well 
mixed, knead it with your hands till it be- 
comes stiff, dredging with a httle flour to 
prevent it sticking to the board. When 
thoroughly kneaded, put it into a pan, cover 
it over with a cloth, and set it before the 
fire for five or six minutes, when it will be 
fit for any home purposes. 

Salmon Pie. 
The following is an old but good way of 
making salmon pie : — 

714. Put pieces of butter at the bottom of 
the pie-dish, place in it a piece of salmon 
cut from the middle of the fish, pick out 
the flesh of a boiled lobster, chop up the 
solid parts, and mix all well with liquefied 
butter, season to taste, put on a crust, and 
;bake itfor about one hour., 



French, Potato, Beefsteak and Riivtpsteak Pics. 165 



Frencli Pie. 
Time, half an hour- 

715. Half a pound of dressed beef; half 
a pound of potatoes ; one egg ; a piece of 
butter the size of a large walnut. 

Chop the beef very small, mash and 
pound the potatoes, and mix them together 
with a well-beaten &gg, and a piece of but- 
ter ; season with pepper and salt. Put this 
mixture into a buttered mould, and balce it 
for half an hour, then turn it out, and brown 
it before the fire in a Dutch oven. 

Pie a la Don Pedro- 

There is a tin expressly made for this sort 
of pie. 

Time, to bake, two hours. 

716. Three or four pounds of mashed 
potatoes; four ounces of butter ; loin of 
mutton ; three or four slices of raw ham ; 
a bunch of parsley ; pepper and salt to 
taste. 

Mash the potatoes with butter and salt 
only. Cut a loin of mutton into very small 
deUcate cutlets, put them into a saute-pan 
on the fire, with some chopped parsley, 
butter, pepper, and salt, saut6 them like 
other cutlets, and then dish them into the 
pan in a turban, and cover them with very 
good brown gravy. Put in the middle of 
them some slices of raw ham. Put on the 
cover, which must rest on the supports, and 
cover over the cover itself with very nicely 
mashed potatoes, up to the brim of the pan, 
and garnish it with maslied potatoes made 
quite smooth. Put it into the oven and 
bake it gently as directed above. 

Fillets of sole instead of mutton are abo 
greatly approved. 
Macaroni is a good substitute for ham.

lumps of pomided sugar. Stir them over 
the fire, until sufficiently thick to pile in a 
dish, and garnish with sippets. 

To Choose Mushrooms. 
826. The greatest care is requisite in the 



choice of mushrooms, as the death of marty 
persons has been occasioned by carelessly 
using the poisonous kinds. 

The eatable ones first appear very small 
and of a round form, on a little stalk. They 
grow very fast, and the upper part and stalk 
are white. As the size increases, the under 
part gradually opens, and shows a fringy fur 
of a very fine salmon-colour, which conti- 
nues more or less till the mushroom has 
gained some size, and then turns to a dark 
brown. These marks should be attended 
to, and likewise whether the skin can be 
easily parted from the edges and middle. 
Those that have white or yellow fur should 
be carefully avoided, though many of them 
have the same smell (but not so strong) as 
the right sort. 

Stewed Mushrooms. 
Time, twenty-one minutes. 

827. Button mushrooms ; salt to taste ; a 
little butter rolled in flour ; two tablespoon- 
fuls of cream, or the yolk of one egg. 

Choose buttons of uniform size. Wipe 
them clean and white with a wet flannel, put 
them in a stewpan with a little water, and 
let them stew very gently for a quarter of an 
hour. Add salt to taste, work in a little 
flour and butter, to make the liquor about 
as thick as cream, and let it boil for five 
minutes. When you are ready to dish it 
up, stir in two tablespoonfuls of cream, or 
the yolk of an egg, stir it over the fire for 
a minute, but do not let it boil, and serve it. 
Stewed button mushrooms are very nice, 
either in fish stews or ragolits, or served 
apart to eat with fish. 

Another way of doing them is to stew them 
in milk and water (after they are rubbed 
white), add to them a little veal gravy, mace, 
and salt, and thicken the gravy with cream 
or the yolks of eggs. 

Mushrooms Grilled. 
Time, about twelve minutes, to broil. 

828. Six large mushrooms; quarter of a 
pound of butter ; pepper and salt ; juice of 
a lemon. 

Peel and score the under part of six fine 
sound fresh mushrooms, put them into an 
earthen dish, and baste well with melted 
butter ; strew with pepper and salt, and leave 
them for an hour and a half. Broil on both 
sides over a clear fire. Serve quite hot, with 
a lump of butter on each and a little pepper,

To Make a Salad (ascribed to the Sev. 
Sydaey Smith.) 
860. 
Two boiled potatoes strained through a 

kitchen sieve. 
Softness and smoothness to the salad give; 
Of mordant mustard take a single spoon. 
Distrust the condiment that bites too soon ; 
Yet deem it not, thou man of taste, a fault, 
To add a double quantity of salt. 
Four times the spoon with oil of Lucca 

crown. 
And twice with vinegar procured from town. 
True taste requires it, and your poet begs. 
The pounded yellow of two well-boiled 

eggs. 
Let onions' atoms lurk within the bowl, 
And scarce suspected animate the whole ; 
And lastly, in the flavoured compound toss, 
A magic spoonful of anchovy sauce ; 
Oh, great and glorious ! oh, herbaceo'.is 

meat ! 
'Twould tempt the dying anchoret to eat, 
Back to the world hed turn his weary soul, 
And dip his finger in the salad bowl.

rouglily beat the yolks of two new-laid eggs, 
beat in made mustard to taste, and con- 
tinuing to beat them drop in three table- 
spoonfuls of salad oil, add whatever flavour- 
ing may be preferred, a taste of Chili vinegar, 
and some salt. Mix in six tablespoon. uls of 
vinegar, and the soft part of the lobster. 
Moisten the remainder of the lobster with 
this, and lay it at the bottom of the bowl, 
cut up the lettuce, take care that it is well

well helped, with due care that each person 
has sufTicient lobster with the green. 

The lettuces should not be cut up until 
the salad is going to be eaten. If it be not 
convenient to do the final mixing then, it is 
better to mix the dressing with the lobster, 
and to let some one, when the time arrives, 
arrange the lettuce round it, cut in quarters.

inside leaves. Have a stewpan of boiling 
water, with a small teaspoonful of salt to

CXTRING BACON, HAMS, &c.— POTTING, COLLARING, &c. 



The important art of pickling or salting 
meat calls for the housekeeper's best atten- 
tion. There are many modes of doing it, 
both in England and America. In England 
North and South make bacon in a different 
manner. In Hampshire, Wiltshire, and 
Berkshire, they singe the hog. In Yorkshire, 
Lincolnshire, &c., they scald the hog. The 
Americarf mode of pickling pork we con- 
sider especially good. Great care must be 
taken in preparing the meat for salting. It 
must be carefully examined to see that it is 
fresh and good, then wiped, sprinkled with 
salt, and afterwards left to drain a few hours 
before it is rubbed with the salt. The meat 
will thus be thoroughly cleansed from the 
blood, which will prevent it from turning 
and tasting strong. It should then be placed 
in the pickling pan and turned every morn- 
ing, also should be nibbed with the pickle. 
The cover of the pickling-pan should fit very 
closely, and have a weight on it to keep it 
down. If a large quantity of salt meat is 
frequently required, the pickle may be boiled 
up, skinuned well, and when cold poured 
over any meat that has been sprinkled and 
well drained as above directed. 

To Pickle Pork. 

866. For a pig of twenty stones weight, 
half a bushel of salt ; half a pound of salt- 
petre ; four pounds of coarse moist sugar. 

Cover the bottom of the tub with salt. 
Then cut off the hams, shoulders, spareribs, 
and griskins of the pig. Rub the remaining 



part of the pork with the above ingredients, 
lay it in the tub with salt between each 
layer, and in three or four days, if the brine 
from the pork does no^ cover it, there must 
be some made, accOi^.ng to the quantities 
you may require. Put two pounds of salt 
and a quarter of an ounce of saltpetre to a 
quart of water. Boil it half an hour, and 
when cold pour it over the pork. 

The pork must on no account swim in the 
brine. To prevent it, have a piece of wood 
cut the size of the rib, and on that hiy very 
heavy stones. If done in this way, it will 
keep good for two years.

If the ham weighs Tmore than twelve 
pounds, you must let it lie in the pickle for 
more than four days before you put the 
treacle to it, and rather more than a month 
in the pickle. But, a day or two before the 
treacle^is added, the ham should not be 
touched or rubbed, only suffered to lie in 
the pickle, taking care that the salt does not 
fall off.

878. For every forty or fifty pounds of 
meat, allow one pound of bay salt ; one 
pound of saltpetre ; two ounces of salpru- 
nella ; four pounds of common salt. 

In Yorkshire and the northern counties, 
pigs are scalded ; the hams, spareribs, and 
chine cut off, and then afterwards salted 
thus : — Rub them well with common salt, 
and lay them on a board for the first brine 
(o run away, for twenty-four hoiirs ; then 



take for every side of forty or fifty pounds, 
the above quantity of bay salt, saltpetre, saU 
prunella bruised fine, and mixed with four 
pounds of common salt. Rub the pork well 
with salt, and put it in the pans at full length; 
turn and rub it in the brine every day for a 
fortnight, then take it out, strew it all 
over with bran or sawdust, and hang it in 
a wood smoke till it is dry ; place it in a 
cool dry place, taking care that it does not 
touch the wall, as that would spoil it. 

To Cure Hams by the Amsriean Mode. 

879. One ounce of saltpetre ; some mo- 
lasses ; salt and water. 

Take one ounce of saltpetre for a fourteen 
pound ham ; make it very fine, and dissolve 
it in a little molasses ; rub it well over the 
cut side of the meat, around the bone, and 
over the whole ham. Then pack as many 
hams as you have, with the small end down- 
wards, in a barrel, with fine salt sprinkled 
between and over them ; let them remain for 
two or three days ; then make a cold brine 
of salt and water, which, will bear an egg, 
and cover the hams with it. After three 
weeks they are fit to smoke, or they may 
remain in the brine three months without 
injury. Any part of pork may be salted in 
this manner. The cheeks or head split in 
two, or any other pieces for boiling or smok- 
ing, are much finer cured in this way. Beef 
tongues may also be done in this manner. 

To Pickle Pork. 

880. One-third of saltpetre ; two-thirds of 
white salt. 

Some people prefer pork pickled with salt 
alone (legs especially), others in the follow-

bottom of a tub ; then mix the salt and salt- 
petre beaten ; cut the pork in pieces, rub it 
well with the salt, and lay it close in the tub, 
with a layer of salt between every layer of 
pork, till the tub is full. Have a cover, just 
large enough to fit the inside of the tub, put 
it on, and lay a great weight at the top, and 
as the salt melts it will keep it close. When 
you want to use it take a piece out, cover the 
tub over again, and it will keep good a long 
time.

clear them from the internals, and the blood 
from the backbone, dry them well with a 
soft cloth, and lay them out on a board. 
Strew a large quantity of salt over them, and 
let them lie all night. Next day clear them 
from the salt, and wipe them dry ; pound 
some cloves, mace, and nutmeg together 
■very fine, sprinkle a little inside each fish, 
and a good deal of salt and pepper outside. 
Put them close down in deep pots with their 
backs downwards, pour clarified butter over 
them, set them in the oven, and let them re- 
luain there three hours. When they are 
taken out of the oven pour off from them as 
much butter a.s will run off, lay a board over 
the pots, and turn them upside down to let 
the gravy run from the fish. Scrape off the 
salt and pepper, lay them close in pots of 
•the right shape and size with the backs up- 
wards, and pour clarified butter over them. 
In a cold, dry place they will keep good 
sometime.

body, claws, and tail, add the spawn, and 
beat it to a paste in a mortar ; melt a quar- 
ter of a pound of fresh butter, add it to the 
meat with a seasoning of beaten mace, 
cloves, pepper, salt, and nutmee. When ail 



is beaten and well mixed, fill your pots, 
press it down as close as you can, and pour 
over them some clarified butter a quarter of 
an inch thick. When it is quite cold, tie it 
over with white paper, or you may put the 
meat from the lobster in as whole as you can. 
Take it out of the tail, claws, and body, lay 
it as close as you can together, season it as 
above, and pour clarified butter over it.

poimd of common salt ; two ounces of bay- 
salt ; two ounces of saltpetre ; one ounce of 
salprunella ; a pinch of cochineal. ■ 

For half a peck of sprats, prepare the 
above seasoning pounded together in a 
mortar. If possible, the sprats should be 
fresh from the sea, not even wiped, unless 
brought from market. Arrange them in a 
pan, with seasoning between each layer of 
fish, press them tightly down, and cover 
them close, and in about four or six months 
they will be fit for use. For anchovy toast, 
or to make anchovy paste, fry them in but- 
ter, turning them carefully, not to break 
them. Take off the heads, tails, and remove 
the bones, beat them to a paste, put them 
into pots, and pour clarified butter over 
them. 



TO lyiAEE PASTES AND PASTRY. 



In the article on meat-pies and puddings 
we have already given several modes of 
making puff paste. For tarts, tartlets, &c., 
however, we shall here insert some of a 
finer character. 

German Paste. 

914. Three-quarters of a pound of flour ; 
half a pound of butter ; half a pound of 
sugar ; peel of a lemon ; two eggs ; half an 
eggshell of water. 

Take three-quarters of a pound of fine 
flour, put into it half a pound of butter, the 



same of powdered sugar, and the peel of a 
lemon grated : make a hole in the middle 
of the flour, break in the yolks of two eggs, 
reserving the whites, which are to be well 
beaten, then mix all well together. If the 
eggs do not sufficiently moisten the paste, 
add half an eggshell of water. Mix all 
thoroughly, but do not handle it too much. 
Roll it out thin, and you may use it for all 
sorts of pastry. Before putting it into the 
oven, wash over the pastry with the white 
of the beaten eggs, and shake over a little 
powdered sugar. 



To Make Pastes and Pastry. 



197 



Feuilletage, or French Paff Paste. 

915. One pound of fresh butter; one 
pound of flour ; yolks of two eggs ; a large 
pinch of salt ; a little water. 

„" Put a pound of flour dried and sifted into 
a bowl or on the pasteboard, break into it 
about two ounces of butter, then beat the 
yolks of two eggs, stir into them a few 
spoonfuls of water, and add them gradually 
to the flour, forming the whole into a smooth 
paste. Press the moisture from the re- 
mainder of the butter, put it into the centre 
of the paste, and fold it over. Then dredge 
the board and rolling-pin with floiir, roll the 
paste out very thin, fold it in three, roll it 
out and fold it again, and put it in a cold 
place for three or four minutes. Again roll 
it out twice, taking care the butter does not 
break through the paste ; set it in a cold 
place, and repeat again. It will then be fit 
for use. 

A light Puff Paste — American. 

916. One pound of sifted flour ; one 
pound of fresh butter ; two teaspoonfuls of 
cream of tartar ; one teaspoonful of soda ; 
a little water. 

Work one-fourth of the butter into the 
floiur until it is like sand ; measure the 
cream of tartar and the soda, rub it through 
a sieve, put it to the flour, add enough cold 
water to bind it, and work it smooth ; dredge 
flour over the paste-slab or board, rub a 
little flour over the rolling-pin, and roll the 
paste to about half an inch thickness ; 
spread over the whole surface one-third of 
the remaining butter, then fold it up ; 
dredge flour over the paste-slab and rolling- 
pin, and roll it out again ; then put another 
portion of the butter, and fold and roll 
again, and spread on the remaining butter, 
and fold and roll for last time. 

Very Eich Short Crust. 

917. Ten ounces of butter ; one pound of 
flour J a pinch of salt ; two ounces of loaf 
sugar, and a little milk. 

Break ten ounces of butter into a pound 
of flour dried and sifted, add a pinch of salt, 
and two ounces of loaf sugar rolled fine. 
Make it into a very smooth paste as lightly 
as possible, with two well-beaten eggs, and 
sufficient milk to moisten the paste. 

Paste for Custards. 

918. Six ounces of butter ; half a pound 
of flour ; yolks of two eggs ; three table- 
spoonfuls of cream. 

Rub six ounces of butter into half a pound 
of flour. Mix it well together with two 



beaten eggs and three tablespoonfuls of 
cream. Let it stand a quarter of an hour, 
then work it up, and roll it out very thin for 
use. 

Light Paste, for Tartlets, &c. 

919. One pound of flour; twelve ounces 
of butter ; one tgg. 

Wash the butter in water, to take out the 
salt, and melt it without its being oiled. 
When it is cool mix with it a well-beaten 
G%g, and then stir it into a pound of flour, 
dried and sifted ; work it into a thin paste, 
roll it out thin, and line the patty-pans as 
quickly as possible with it. When putting 
the tarts into the oven brush the crust over 
with water, and sift some pounded sugar 
over them. Bake them in a lightly heated 
oven, and serve on a napkin, filHng them 
with any preserve you please. 

Croqnante Paste. 

920. One pound of flour; half a pound 
of sifted loaf sugar ; and the yolks of eggs. 

Pound and sift half a pound of loaf sugar; 
mix it with a poxmd of flour, and stir in a 
sufficient number of the yolks of eggs to 
form it into a smooth paste. Beat and knead 
it well, roll it out to the size of the croquante 
form, and about a quarter of an inch thick. 
Rub the form with butter or beef-suet, and 
press the paste closely over it to cut the pat- 
tern well through. Then lay it on a baking- 
tin, brush it lightly over vvith the white of a 
beaten egg, sift sugar over it, and bake it in a 
slow oven. When done, take it carefully 
from the tin, and cover it with any preserves. 
If kept in a dry place it can be used several 
times. 

Frangipane Paste. 

921. Half a pound of flour ; six eggs ; a 
little milk. / 

Just moisten half a pound of flour with a 
little milk, put it into a delicately clean 
ssiucepan, and beat it well together, then 
turn it out, and stir in six well-beaten eggs 
until sufficiently cold to make into a paste 
with your hand. Use it for all sorts of tart- 
lets or entremets. 

Brioche Paste. 

922. Put in a bowl four ounces of the 
finest flour, add to it half an ounce of Ger- 
man yeast, beat up in a little warm water, so 
as to make a very soft paste. Cover it with 
a floured cloth, and then with a cover. Put 
it by the fire, and let it rise till it is more 
than double its original size. Meantime, 
spread on the slab or pasteboard eight 



198 Rich Pastes for Rastry. — Icing and Glazing. 



I 



ounces of flour, make a hole in the middle 
into which put about six ounces of fresh 
butter, a little salt, five whole eggs, and two 
spoonfuls of rich cream. Mix it all well up 
with the flour till it is a paste. Work it well 
with the hands, and then rub it to and fro 
on the slab with the palm of the hand three 
or four times. Roll it out, spread the sponge 
or piece of leaven if ready over it, then tho- 
roughly but lightly mix the two, the sponge 
and paste together. The paste must be 
delicate and soft, but firm enough not to 
run on the pasteboard. If it should be too 
slack add a little flour, if too firm, add 
another egg. When it is made, flour a cloth, 
lay it in a basin, and put the paste on it, 
cover it with the cloth, and let it stay for 
twelve hours untouched. 

Then take it out of the basin on the slab, 
shake flour over it, and knead it well. Re- 
place it under its cover, and let it remain for 
two or three hours. 

It will require kneading again when used 
or foi-med into the shape or shapes intended, 
which may be just what you please. 

There is no end to the modes of using 
brioche paste. Alone, as a large brioche, in 
balls for soup, with preserves in it, or as the 
crust of sweet vols-au-vent, it is equally 
excellent. 

But it will not keep long, and should be 
made up and used the day after you have 
begun making it, according to the preceding 
directions. 

Fate ans Chonz. 

923. Half a pint of water ; four ounces 
of butter ; a little lemon peel or lemon fla- 
vouring ; two ounces of sugar ; a little salt ; 
about four ounces of flour; seven or eight 
eggs ; a pinch of salt 

Put into a stevvpan the water, the butter, 
the salt, and the sugar. Add the flavouring 
of lemon, or the peel minced as fine as pos- 
sible. As soon as the water begins to boil, 
dredge in flour with your left hand, and stir 
■with your right, till it forms a very thick paste, 
•which will be in a few minutes. Take it off 
the fire, and let it grow cold. Break an egg 
into it, beat it together, and continue doing 
so till the paste is soft and will detach itself 
easily from the spoon. 

The paste is then ready for use. 

Ifougat. 

924. Nougfat, which is a useful paste for 
forming pretty sweet dishes, may be made as 
follows : — 

Take a pound of sweet (Jordan) almonds, 
blanch them, i.e., put them in scalding 
water, and then rub off their skins .with a 



cloth. Throw them into cold water, take 
them out and dry them on a table napkin. 
Cut each almond into two or three pieces, 
or cut them in shavings. Put f hem in a slow 
oven, and let them get nicely coloured while 
you melt three-quarters of a pound of pow- 
dered white sugar over the fire, stirring it 
lightly with a wooden spoon to prevent it 
from burning. When it begins to bubble, 
and is a nice gold colour, put in the almonds 
hot. Lift the stewpan off the fire, and mix 
the sugar and almonds together. Keep the 
nougat very hot ; warm and slightly oil a 
tin sheet, and spread the nougat on it, press- 
ing it very thin with half a lemon. Have 
ready your mould or moulds nicely oiled, 
and drained after oiling, and put in the 
nougat as quickly as you possibly can, 
pressing it flat with the lemon. 

If the nougat gets cold, it will be brittle, 
and you will not be able to form it. You 
must not mind burning your fingers with it. 

When the nougat is quite cold, turn it out 
of the mould, or moulds, fill it with whipped 
cream flavoured with vanilla, and serve on 
a napkin. 

To Ice or Glaze Pastry, or Sweet Dishee. 

925. Whites of two eggs to three ounces 
of loaf sugar. 

To ice pastry or any sweet dishes, break 
the whites of some i-.ew-laid eggs into a 
large soup plate, and beat them with the 
blade of a knife to a firm froth. When the 
pastry is nearly done, take it fiom the oven, 
brush it well over with the beaten &gg, and 
sift the pounded sugar over it in the above 
proportion. Put it again into the oven to dry 
or set, taking care it is not discoloured. 

Or beat the yolks of eggs and a little warm 
butter well together, bnish the pastry over 
with it, when nearly baked, sift pounded 
sugar thickly over it, and put it into the oven 
to dry. 

For raised, or meat pies, the yolks of eggs 
must be used. 

To Glaze Pastry. — Icing another Way, 

926. White of an egg ; four ounces of 
double-refined sugar, with as much gum as 
will lie on a si.-cpence. 

Beat the white of an egg to a stiff froth, 
add by degrees four ounces of powdered 
sugar, with as much gum as will lie on a 
sixpence beaten and sifted fine ; beat or 
whisk it well for half an hour, then lay it 
over your tarts, and put them in a slow oven 
to set,

wet that also. Cover the top with puff paste, 
pressing it round the edge with your thumbs. 
Cut the overhanging edge off evenly. Then 
scallop the edge by first chopping it in lines 
all round, and then giving them a Uttle 
twist at regular intervals with the knife. 
Take the edges you have cut off, flour them, 
roll them out, and cut them into leaves to 
ornament the top. Egg it over and bake it. 
When done, dredge it with white sugar, and

BAKED AND BOILED PUDDINGS. 



For boiled puddings you will require either 
a mould, a basin, or a pudding-cloth : the 
former should have a close fitting cover, and 
be mbbed over the inside with butter before 
putting the pudding in it, that it may not 
stick to the side ; the cloth should be dipped 
in boiling water, and then well floured on the 
inside. A pudding-cloth must be kept very 
clean, and in a dry place. Bread-puddings 
should be tied very loosely, as they swell 
very much in boiling. 

The water must t)e boiling when the pud- 
ding is put in, and continue to boil until it is 
done. If a puddinar is boiled in a cloth it 
must be moved frCquently whilst boiling, 
otherwise it will stick to the saucepan. 

There must always be enough water to 
cover the pudding if it is boiled in a cloth ; 
but if boiled in a tin mould, do not let the 
water quite reach the top. 

To boil a pudding in a basin, dip a cloth 
in hot water, dredge it with flour, and tie it 
closely over the basin. When the pudding 
is done, talte it from the water, plunge what- 
ever it is boiling in, whether cloth or basin, 
suddenly into cold water, then turn it out 
immediately ; this will prevent its sticking. 
If there is any delay in serving the pudding, 
cover it with a napkin, or the cloth in Which 
it was boiled ; but it is better to serve it as 
soon as removed from the cloth, basin, or 
mould. 

Baked Puddings. 

Bread or rice puddings require a moderate 
heat for baking; batter or custard require a 
quick oven. The time needed for baking each 
particular pudding is given with the receipt. 

Eggs for puddings are beaten enough when 
a spoonful can be taken up clear from strings. 

Soufflds require a quick oven. These 
should be made so as to be done the moment 
for serving, otherwise they will fall in and 
flatten.j

Steep the thin peel of five lemons and one 
Seville orange in a pint and a half of boiling 
water, to extract the flavour and the colour ; 
then add the lemon juice strained, and the 
sugar pounded. When cold, pout it over 
three plain sponge cakes, previously placed 
in the dish in which they are to be served.

thickness. Put the mould or basin into a 
floured cloth and tie it closely over. Then

Cover the bottom of , the pan with butter, 
and turn it out again, as they will fry them- 
selves. When done, strew pounded sugar 
between the pancakes as you lay them on 
the dish.

in the middle of the dish, as it raises them 
up, gives a better effect at table, and they 
are helped better.

large spoonful of the mixture, fry it very 
quickly, put it into a dish in the oven, roll- 
" ing it as you take it from the pan, and 
putting a little grated sugar between it. The 
pancake will rise in the oven. Do not fry

fore you turn it out, as if very stiff it will 
gieiitly improve the appearance of the flum- 



mery, and it will turn out without putting 
the mould in hot water, which gives a dulness 
to the flummery.

SOTTFFLES AND OMfELETS. 



A soufH^ itiust be ready only at the instant 
it is required ; not a minute too soon, or it 
will fall. Both soufHes and omelets require 
good cooking. Take our advice and see 
them made by a good cook. The mode of 
doing them well must be taught by example, 
not by words. 

Milan Souffle. 

1266. Four lemons ; sue eggs ; half a pint 
of whipped cream ; two ounces of sugar ; 
one ounce of isinglass. 

Take four lemons, rub the peel on the 
sugar, put to it the yolks of six eggs made 
into a custard, add the juice of the lemons. 
Let it stand till cold, then add nearly half a 
pint of whipped cream and' an ounce of 
isinglass. The whites of the eggs to be well 
whipped to a strong froth, and put rotmd it 
with the whipped cream when cold. 

York Souffle. 

1267. Five eggs ; half a pound of loaf 
sugar ; peel and juice of two lemons ; two 
ounces of butter ; puff paste. 

Well beat five eggs ; stir with them half a 
pound of powdered sugar, and the juice and 
grated peel of two lemons. Melt the butter, 
pour it into the e^gs, and bake the whole in 
^ dish with pufif paste round it. 

Omelet Souffle. 

1268. Twelve eggs ; two ounces of pow- 
dered sugar ; one dessertspoonful of orange- 
flower water ; one ounce of fresh butter. 

Separate the whites from the yolks of 
twelve eggs. Put the whites into a basin 
and beat them extremely fast till they form 
a very thick snow. Then beat six yolks 
separately, with two ounces of sugar, and a 
dessertspoonful of orange-flour water, or 
just enough to flavour it to your taste. 

Before beating the eggs have ready a 



round tin, well greased all over the inside 
with fresh butter. 

When you have finished ibeating the six 
yolks, mix them very quickly with the whites, 
lest the snow should turn — that is, melt into 
water. Put it then into the buttered tin, 
and place it in the oven. It will be so thick, 
if it is well and skilfully mixed, that there 
will be no fear of its running over. Watch 
it well; glancing at it from time to time 
through a Uttle opening of the oven door, to 
see how it is going on ; as soon as it has 
risen very high, and is of a golden coloiir, 
take it out of the oven. 

Do not suffer the omelet souffld to remain 
long in the oven. If it is not watched it 
will fall in and become a mere galette. Let 
the oven be of a very gentle heat, or the 
bottom of the omelet will be burnt before 
the top is done. 

Before putting the tin in the ovot, you 
may powder the snow with fine sugar ; it 
crj'stallizes and produces a very pretty effect. 
As soon as the omelet is done it must be 
sent to table. If it waits for longer than ten 
minutes it falls in. The eggs should be 
beaten with a i: ; k or a little whisk. 

If this souffle is liked a little more solid, 
add to the yolks of the eggs when beaten 
two dessertspoonfuls of rice boiled in milk, 
and flavoured with vanilla. In this case do 
not put in the orange-flower flavouring. 
The rice must be very well cooked, and well 
sweetened before it is added to the eggs. 

Apple Souffle. 
Time, ten minutes. 
1269. Six or eight apples ; some white 
sugar ; yolks and whites of three eggs ; a

spoonful of brandy, and white sugar to 
taste. Have the apples and custard ready; 
make a ring round tlie dish w>:li the apples, 
and put the custard in the middle. Whisk 
the whites of the eggs to a sti^" froth, and 
put them over the custaid and apples ; sift 
sugar over it, and bake it ia a moderate 
oven.

out the dish carefully, and fill the inside of 
the paste with ten or twelve large apples, 
three ounces of pounded sugar, and the 
peel of half a lemon stewed until perfectly 
soft. Whisk the whites of four eggs very 
stiff, pile it on the apples, strew sifted sugar

a wall, leaving the centre hollow. Make a 
custard with the yolks of four eggs well 
beaten, a pint of milk, and sugar to taste ; 
fill the centre of the strawberry wall, and 
cover the whole with the whites of the eggs 
whisked sufficiently firm to bear an egg ;

remain twenty-four hours, and then strain 
them without bruising the" fruit. To each 
pint of strained liquor add a pound and a 
half of powdered loaf sugar; stir it frequently 
until it is dissolved, and then bottle it for 
use. This quantity fills twelve bottles, and 
the process must be cold.

If j-ou wish to make any other kind of 
jelly omit the sherry, and add for instance 
orange juice for orange jelly, or the juice of 
strawberries, cherries, pineapple, or any 
other fruit. The jelly takes its name from 
its flavouring. No jelly of several colours

be made in any pretty fancy mould (there 
are many to be had for the purpose), as in 
the coloured plates of jelly of two colours 
and riband jelly. Of course one colour

isinglass jelly ; some ripe fruit; or any pre- 
served, or brandy cherries. 

Have ready one quart of very clear jelly ; 
select ripe and nice-looking fruit, and pick 
off the stalks; commence by putting some 
jelly at the bottom of a mould, and let it re- 
main about two hours to harden, then 
arrange some fruit according to taste round 
the edge of the mould. If currants, lay 
them in as they come from the tree, on their 
stalks, and pour in more jelly to make the 
fruit adhere, and let that layer also harden, 
then add more fruit and jelly until the mould 
is full. If peaches, apples, apricots, &c., 
are used, they are better boiled first in a 
iinall quantity of syrup, but strawberries, 
grapes, cherries, or currants may be put in 
uncooked. An extremely pretty jelly may 
be made from presci-ved fruits, or brandy 
cherries. It may be garnished with any 
fruit, or an open jelly may have some straw- 
berries piled in the centre, or a whipped 
cream piled up, with strawberries stuck in 
it, which has a very good effect.

gaufres as the sheet will admit, and put 
them back again in the oven Xa just co\ovx 
them. Then take them out, and form them 
into small cornucopise. This must be done 
as quickly as poesible, as if they get cold 
they will break in doing, being very brittle. 

These tiny horns can be filled with any 
preserve you please ; or being first covered 
with white of egg and sugar, maybe dipped

ICES. 

Ice is no longer a luxury confined to the I pound, it is within the reach of the middle 
.splendid homes of the rich. Sold at the classes, and is found of the greatest service

heat of summer, when our butter threatens 
to become oil, a few lumps of ice placed 
round and on the pot (if no refrigerator is 
possessed by the housewife), will render it 
good and eatable at a very slight expense. 

And, if the outlay of a few pounds can 
be afforded, we recommend every house- 
keeper to purchase one of the new "Piston" 
Freezing Machines, invented by Mr. Ash. 
The lowest price will be only £2 10s. for 
one to be used with ice and salt only. 
These pretty little machines can be used by 
a lady herself with the greatest ease. The 



writer has assisted in the manufacture of an 
ice with one, and found it a pleasant and 
amusing task, and at a very small aKpense 
iced creams, puddings, &c., &c., can be 
produced whenever required. 

The Piston Freezing Machines may be 
had either to be used with ice and salt only, 
or it may be used with the chemical freez- 
ing mi.xture. The latter, however, is ex- 
pensive. 

There is a new icing machine recently 
patented which is said to be likely to sur- 
pass those named here. 



Receipts for Making Ices.

To Mould Dessert Ice when not Frozen 
the Patent Moulding Pots. 

1459. Dessert ices, iced puddings, &c., 
when required to be moulded, must not be 
frozen too hard, or they will not fill the cre- 
vices of the mould. 

After the mould is filled with the dessert 
ice, secure it air-tight by placing a piece of 
writing paper round the edges, and then 
shutting the top and bottom cover of the 
mould upon it. 

The mould should be immediately in- 
serted into a tub of rough ice and salt, seeing 
thai every part of the mould is well covered, 
and m contact with the ice and salt. In 
about an hour, or longer, if convenient, the 
mould may be withdrawn, and the ice turned 
out and sent to table. 

All dessert ices and puddings should con- 
tain only a certain amount of sweetness ; 
the proper richness is shown by using a sac- 
charometer. For ascertaining the correct 
amount of saccharine (or sweetness) that 
should be contained in dessert ices, iced pud- 
dings, &c., when using either iceand common 
salt, or the chemical freezing powders, as a re- 
frigerating medium, use the saccharometer. 

Directions for its Use. 

1460. Nearly fill a tumbler with the sweet 
confection ; place the saccharometer gently 
into it, and if mixed correctly, for freezing 
with ice and salt, it will sink to the lowest red 
mark. For freezing with freezing powders 
it will sink to the highest red mark. To 
make the saccharometer sink, add milk to a 
cream ice, and water to a water ice. To make 
it rise, add more sugar or sweet symp. 

Ices, &c., will not freeze well unless mixed 
by this scale. 



BAKING BISCTJITS AND CAKES. 



An oven to bake well should have a re- 
gular heat throughout, but particularly at 
the bottom, without which breiid or cakes 
will not rise, or bake well. 

An earthen basin is best for beating eggs, 
or cake mixture. 

Cake should be beaten with a wooden 
spoon, or spatula ; butter may be beaten 
with the same. 

Eggs should be beaten with rods, or a 
broad fork ; a silver fork, or one made of 
iron wire, is best, as it is broadest ; eggs 
should be clear and fresh for a cake. 

\\ is well, as a general rijle in cake making, 



to beat the butter and sugar (which must be 
made fine) to a light cream ; indeed, in the 
making of pound cake, the lightness of the 
cake depends as much upon this as upon 
the eggs being well beaten ; then beat the 
eggs and put them to the butter, and gradu- 
ally add the flour and other ingredients, 
beating it all the time. 

In common cakes, where only a few eggs 
are used, beat them until you can take a 
spoonful up clear from strings. 

In receipts in which milk is used as one 
ingredient, either sweet or sour may be used, 
but not a mixture of both. 



Making Biscuits and Cakes. — Preparation of Sugars, &c. 279 



Sour milk makes a spongy light cake ; 
sweet milk makes a cake which cuts like 
pound cake. 

To blanch almonds, pour boiling water 
on them, and let them remain in it until the 
skins may be taken off; then throw the 
almonds into cold wafer to whiten them, 
diain them from the water, but do not wipe 
them ; the moisture will prevent their oiling. 

In making cakes, if you wish them to be 
pleasing to the palate, use double refined 
sugar, although light brown sugar makes a 
very good cake. 

For icing cakes, the sugar must be rolled 
and sifted, or pounded in a mortar. 

For making lady-fingers, have a tin tube 
as long as your finger, like the spout of a 
funnel ; to the upper part of this a little bag 
must be attached, and the cake mixture put 
in, and pressed out on to the paper the 
length and size desired ; the point of the 
tube may be larger or smaller as may be re- 
quired. Savoy biscuit mixture may be baked 
as lady-fingers for making Charlotte Russe. 

To ascertain whether a cake is baked 
enough, if a small one, take a veiy fine 
splint of wood and run it through the 
thickest part ; if not done enough, some of 
the dough, or unbaked cake will be found 
sticking to it; if done, it will come out clean. 
If the cake is large, pass a small knife-blade 
through it instead of the splint. Cakes to be 
kept fresh should be placed in a tin-box 
tightly covered, in a cool dark place. 

Preparation of Sugars. 

146 1. To prepare sugars properly is a 
material point in the business of confec- 
tionery; and as some rules are undoubtedly 
necessary to be given in a work of this kind, 
we shall begin with the first process, that of 
clarifying sugar, which must be done in this 
manner : — 

Break the white of an egg into the pre- 
serving-pan, put in four quarts of water, and 
•Deat it up to a froth with a whisk. Then 
put in twelve pounds of sugar, mix all to- 
gether, set it over the fire, and when it boils, 
put in a little cold water. Proceed in this 
manner as many times as may be necessary 
till the scum appears thick on the top ; then 
remove it from the fire, and let it settle; take 
off the scum, and pass it through a strain- 
ing bag. If the sugar should not appear 
very fine, you must boil it again before you 
strain it, otherwise, in boiling to a height, it 
will rise over the pan. Having thus finished 
the first operation, proceed to clarify the 
sugar to either of the five following degrees. 

rirst Degree, called Smooth or Candy 

. Sugar. 
146a. Having clarified the sugar as above 



directed, put any quantity over the fire, and 
let it boil till it is smooth. This may be 
known by dipping the skimmer into the 
sugar, and then touching it between the fore- 
finger and thumb (previously dipped into 
cold water) and immediately opening them; 
a small thread will be drawn between, which 
will instantly break, and remain as a drop 
on the thumb. This will be a sign of its 
being in some degree smooth. Then boil it 
again, and it will draw into a larger string, 
and will have acquired the first degree above 
mentioned. 

Second Degree, called Sonffle. 

1463. To obtain this degree, boil the sugar 
longer than in the former process, and then 
dip in the skimmer, shaking off the sugar 
into the pan. Then with the mouth blow 
strongly through the holes, and if certain 
bladders or bubbles blow through, it will be 
a proof of its having acquired the second 
degree. 

Third Degree, called Feathered Sngar. 

1464. This degree is to be proved by dip- 
ping the skimmer in when the .sugar has 
boiled longer than in the former degree. 
First shake it over the pan, then give it a 
sudden flirt behind, and if it is boiled enough, 
the sugar will fly off like feathers. 

Fourth Degree, called Crackled Sugar. 

1465. Having let the sugar boil longer 
than in the preceding degree, dip a stick 
into the sugar, and immediately put it into 
a basin of iced water. Draw off the sugar 
that hangs to the stick into the water, and 
if it becomes hard, and snaps in the water, 
it has acquired the proper degree; but if 
otherwise, boil it till it answers that trial. 
Take particular care that the water used for 
this purpose is very cold, otherwise it will 
lead to errors. 

Fifth Degree, called Caramel Sugar. 

1466. To obtain this degree, the sugar 
must boil longer than in either of the former 
operations ; prove it by dipping in a stick, 
first into the sugar, and then into cold water; 
but observe, ^^hen it comes to the caramel 
height, it will, the moment it touches the 
cold water, snap like glass, which is ths 
highest and last degree of boiled sugar. 
Take care that the fire is not very fierce 
when this is boiling, lest, flaming up the 
sides of the pan, it should cause the sugar 
to burn, which will discolour and spoil it.

it up into a paste : colour the paste with 
powders and jellies according to fancy, and 
then make them up into the requisite shape. 
Moulds may be made in any shape, and they 
will be pretty ornaments placed on the tops 
of iced cakes. 

To Boil Sngar to Caramel. 

1468. To every pound of refined sugar 
allow one gill of spring water ; juice of half 
a lemon. 

Break a pound of refined sugar into a de- 
licately-clean stewpan, pour in one gill of 
spring water. Set it on a clear fire and let 
it boil very quickly, skimming it very care- 
fully as soon as it boils. 

Keep it boiling until the sugar snaps, 
which may be known by dipping a teaspoon 
into the sugar, and then letting it drop to the 
bottom of a pan of cold water. If it remains 
hard, the sugar has attained the right degree ; 
then squeeze in the juice of half a lemon, 
and let it remain one minute longer on the 
fire. Then set the pan in another of cold 
water, and the caramel will be fit for use. 

Have ready moulds of any form, rub the 
insides with oil, dip a fork or spoon into the 
sugar, and throw it over the moulds in fine 
threads or net-work. 

SjTTtip for Compotes, 

Time, a quarter of an hour to twenty 
minutes. 

1469. One pound of refined sugar ; one 
pint and a half of water. 

Boil a pound of refined sugar in a pint 
and a half of spring water, carefully remove 
the scum as it rises, and the syrup will then 
be fit for use when required. 

To Colour Sugar Eed. 

1470. Crush the sugar roughly with a 
rolling-pin, but do not pound it fine. Put 
it in a plate and drop a little prepared 
cochineal over it. Set it before the fire to 
dry. It will then be ready for use. 

Clarified Sugar or Syrup. 
Time, four or five minutes to boil. 

1471. Two pounds of double-refined loaf 
sugar ; one pint of spring water ; half of the 
white of one egg. 

Break into small pieces two pounds of 
double-refined loaf sugar, put it into a clean 
stewpan with a pint of cold spring water. 
When the sugar is dissolved, add half the 
white of an egg, which sliould be well 
beaten. Watch it, and when it boils take 
off the scum, keep it boiling till no scum 
rises, and it is perfectly clear, then mn it 



through a clean napkin, and the sugar will 
be fit for use. 

Or it may be put into a close stoppered 
bottle, when it will keep for some time. 

Spun Sugar. 

1472. Having boiled the sugar to the fifth 
degree, oil the handle of a wooden spoon, 
tie two forks together, the prongs outward, 
dip them into the sugar lightly, take them 
out and shake them to and fro. Let the 
sugar run from them over the spoon, form- 
ing fine silken threads. These you can 
form with your hands into whatever you 
may require for garnishing. Or, which is 
really better, you may do so from the lip of 
the sugar-pan. However, it requires prac- 
tice. A good cook will have sugar spinners. 

Icing for Cakes. 

1473. Whites of three eggs ; one pound 
of sugar ; flavouring of vanilla or lemon. 

Beat the whites of the eggs to a high 
froth, then add to them a quarter of a pound 
of white sugar pounded and sifted, flavour 
it with vanilla or lemon, and beat it until it 
is light and very white, but not quite so stiff 
as meringue mixture. The longer it is 
beaten the more firm it will become. Beat 
it until it may be spread smoothly on the 
cake. 

To Ice or Frost a Cake, 

1474. When the icing is made as directed, 
place the cake on the bottom of the tin in 
which it was baked. Then spread the icing 
on the sides with a piece of cardboard about 
four inches long and nearly three wide. 
Then heap what you may think sufficient 
for the top 'in the centre of the cake, and 
with the cardboard spread it evenly over. 
Set it in a warm place to dry and harden, 
after which ornament it as you please. If 
sugar ornaments are put on, it must be done 
whilst it is moist or soft ; or if the icing is 
required coloured, pink may be made with 
cochineal syrup, blue with indigo, yellow 
with saffron, green with spinach syrup, and 
brown with chocolate. 

Almond Icing for Bridecake, 

1475. The whites of three eggs ; one ]5ound 
of sweet almonds ; one pound of loaf sugar ; 
a little rosewater. 

Beat the whites of the eggs to a strong 
froth, beat a pound of almonds very fine 
with a little rosewater, mix the almonds 
with the eggs lightly together, and one 
pound of common white sugar beaten very 
fine and put in by degrees. When fbe 
cake is sufficiently done take it out, lay the 
icing on, and then put it back to brown.

gether for a few minutes, and add a tea- 
spoonful of strained lemon juice. Spread 
it all over the cake, covering the almond 
icing thickly and evenly. Dry it very slowly 
in a cool oven, or if it is put on as soon as 
the cake is taken from the oven, the icing 
will be hard by the time the cake is cold.

you may fancy. Wheels, Grecian borders 
oxflo-aiers look well, or borders of beading. 
The cake must first be covered with a plain 
frosting, which may be white, or coloured 
pink with cochineal powdered, blue with a 
little indigo, or brown with a little chocolate 
finely grated, green with a little spinach 
juice.

Lime Preserves, Damson, Cheese, Gooseberry yarn, &c. 301 



Choose the lightest sprays, and hang them will be the crystals attached to them, but 
with the stems upwards on cords stretched care must be taken that it be not hot enough 



across the top of the vessel so that they do 
not touch the* bottom. They will attract the 
alum in the process of crystallization like the 
tlireads in sugarcandy. The warmer the 
solution when they are put in the smaller 



to destroy the leaves or fronds, and if there 
be any berries like holly it must be hardly 
lukewarm. 

The same solution warmed again will do 
two or three bouquets.

cut them in very thin slices. While they 
are boiling press the inside of the oranges 
through a splinter sieve, narrow enough 
to prevent the seeds and skin from going 
through. When this is done, and the peels 
cut into the thinnest shreds, put the whole on 
the fire in a copper or brass pan, with eight 
pounds of loaf sugar broken small. Boil it 
all together for ten minutes, it may then

put a layer of pounded white sugar at the 
bottom of the jar or pot, then of pineapple, 
then of sugar, repeating this until full, but 
do not press it down. When the jar is 
lightly filled, pour in sufficient brandy to 
rather more than cover the slices, taking care 
that the pounded sugar is the last layer. 
Cover it closely over, and keep it in a dark 
cool place. 

To Prererve whole Quinces. 

1683. Six or seven pounds of apples ; one 
pound of loaf sugar to every pint of juice ; 
as many quinces as you may require. 

Cut six or seven pounds of golden pip- 
pins into slices without paring them, and put 
them into a preserving pan with four pints 
of water ; boil them quickly, covered closely 
over until the water is a thick jelly, to every 
pint of which add a pound of loaf sugar 
pounded hne. Set it over the fire to boil, 
and skim it thoroughly. Scald the quinces 
until they are tender, and then put them 
into the syrup. Let it boil quickly, skim it 
well, and when the quince is clear put a 
small portion of the syrup into a glass, and 
if the jelly is sufficiently firm put the quinces 
into jars, and pour the syrup over them. 
Set them to cool, and then cover them with 
brandy paper, and paper dipped into the 
white of an egg pressed closely over the top 
of the pots. 

Quince Uarmalade. 

1684. To every pound of pulp three- 
quarters of a pound of loaf sugar. 

Pare the quinces and well core them, 
place them in a jar, cover them, with water, 
adding half a pound of sugar. Tie down 
the jar the same as for damsons, and put 
them in the oven all night. The next day 
pulp them through a wire sieve, and to every 
pound of pulp add three-quarters of a pound 
of loaf sugar. Boil all together till they 
look a nice purple colour. When stiff 
enough, fill your pots. Keep them in a dry 
place, and cover them closely over. 

Qtiince Cheese. 

1685. A quarter of a pint of water to 
each pound of fruit ; half a pound of fine 
Lisbon sugar to each pound of quinces. 

Pare and core some ripe quinces, cut 
them vep' small, put the parings into a pre- 



serving pan, and turn a plate over them 
! large enough to cover them. Then put in 
I the cut quinces with a quarter of a pint of 
I water to each pound, cover the pan closely, 
' and set it over a gentle fire until they are 
i quite soft, and then take them out. Strain 
; the water from the parings to the sugar, set 
, it over the fire, and stir it until it is dis- 
solved. Let it boil, taking off the scum, 
until only a hght foam rises. Mash the 
! quinces, put them Into the syrup, cover it 
' over, and let them boil slowly (taking care 
that it does not burn) until it is thick like a 
I stiff jelly. Line earthen fiat dishes with 
, tissue paper, and put the marmalade or 
j cheese in to fill them. When cold, lay 
tissue paper over, and cover with earthen 
: lids. Apples or pears may be put with the 
' quinces, or done in the same manner with- 
out the quinces, lemon cut small being- 
added to pears or apples to flavour them. 

To Preserve Grapes in Brandy for Winter 
Dessert. 

1686. Grapes; white sugarcandy; brandy. 
Take some fine close bunches of grapes, 

prick each twice with a fine needle, and lay 
them carefully in jars, cover the grapes 
thickly over with pounded sugarcandy, and 
then fill up the jars with good brandy. Tie 
the jars tightly over with a bladder, and set 
them in a cool dry place. 

Greengage Jam. 
Time, one hour. 

1687. To six pounds of greengages, four 
pounds of loaf sugar. 

j Take off the skins, and stone some ripe 
greengages, and boil them quickly for three- 
quarters of an hour with sugar, keeping 
them constantly stirred ; then add four 
pounds of pounded sugar to six pounds of 
fruit. Boil the preserve for eight or ten 
minutes longer, skimming it frequently as , 
the scum rises. Put it mto pots or jars, 
cover it closely over, and keep it in a dry 
place. 

I Rules to be ohserved in Pickling. 

' 1688. Procure always the best while wine 
vinegar. Orleans vinegar, although the 
dearest, is the best. The success 0/ your 
pickles depends on the goodness of your vine- 

Use glass bottles for your pickles ; it 
earthen jars, they must be unglazed, as the 
' vinegar acting upon the glaze produces a 
mineral poison. Use saucepans lined with 
! earthenware, or stone pipkins to boil your 
I vinegar in. If you are compelled to use 
( tin, do not let your vinegar remain in it one 



314 Times to Pickle. — Indian Pickle.— Melon Mangoes, &c. 



moment longer than actually necessary, j 
Employ also wooden knives and forks in 1 
the preparation of your pickles. Fill the 
jars three-parts full with the articles to be 
pickled, and then fill the bottle or jar with 
vinegar. 

When greening, keep the pickles covered 
down, as the evaporation of the steam will 
injure the colour. A little nut of alum may 
be added to crisp pickles, but it should be 
I'ery small in proportion to the quantity, or | 
it will give a disagreeable flavour.

1712. Pick and tie some fresh parsley in 
bunches, and boil it for three or four 
minutes in boiling water in which a little 
salt has been melted and strained, drain it 
from the water on a sieve, and dry ^it very 
quickly before the fire ; put it into bottles. 
When required for use, soak it in warm 
water for a few minutes. 



BUTTER AND CHEESE. 



To Make Butter. 

1713. In order to make butter well, it is 
necessary that the vessels in which the milk 
is kept be sweet and clean, and the milk- 
room or cellar cool and airy in summer. 

Large tin pans are mostly used for milk, 
the broadest are the best, allowing a greater 
surface for the cream to rise. 

Vessels in which milk is kept, after being 
emptied, must first be washed in cold water 
to take off all the milk, and any remains of 
cream, then fill them with scalding hot 
water, which must be suffered to remain 
until nearly cold. One pan may be turned 
over another, which is filled with hot water, 
for a few minutes, then change their relative 
positions, pouring the water from one to the 
other. This will require less time and water 
than the other way. Lastly, wash them 
well in the water and turn them tipside 
down in the sun. Tin milk pails are best, 
being most easily kept sweet. White, or 
hard wood pails are generally used, and 
must be washed well in cold water and then 
scalded the same as tin pans. Occasionally, 
scour both pails and pans with soft soap 
and sand, and afterwards scald them, rinse 
them in hot water, and dry them in the sun, 
or by a fire. Or, instead of scalding the j

and having first wr,:hed them in cold water 
(turning it round that every part may get its 
due), let it remain in for a few minutes, then 
wipe them dry, and set them by for use ; 
their own heat will assist the drying. 

Milk strainers are tin basins with a fine 
sieve at the bottom, or with a ring by which 
to fasten a linen cloth over a bottomless 
basin. The ring and cloth must be taken 
off every time it is used, and first washed in 
cold water. Allow it to remain in the water 
whilst washing the tins, then wash it out, 
pour scalding water in it, and lastly, rinse it 
in cold water, and hang it to dry. 

A small frame or ladder is wanted to lay 
across the pan and support the strainer 
whilst the milk is poured tlirough. 

For taking the cream from the milk, a 
short handle tin skimmer or shell is used. 
A stone jar or pot is best for keeping cream. 
There should never be more than three days' 
gatherings for a churning ; too long- keeping 
will make bitter butter. Wash the jar in 
cold water, and scald and dry as directed 
for the tins. 

Wooden ware churns are mostly used. 
The old fashioned barrel churn is best for 
small churnings ; a larger sort, in which the 
dasher is suspended and moved back and 
forth, instead of up and down, is less tire-

clean in the same manner as the other 
vessels, exposing the inside to the heat of 
the sun until thoroughly dry, after each time 
washing. 

A wooden tray and ladle are also neces- 
sary for receiving and working the butter 
after it is made. 

Care is necessary that the churning is 
neither too fast nor too slowly performed. 
The dashes should be continued at intervals 
of about a second between them, and 
steadily, until the butter has come, when a 
slower and more girntle motion is desirable. 

Scald the tray and ladle, then fill it with 
cold water until the butter is made. 

After the butter is fairly gathered, take it 
from the buttermilk, with the ladle, pressing 
it against the sides of the churn, to free it 
from the milk ; having thrown the water 
from the tray put the butter in, pour cold 
water over to cover it, and set it in a cool 
place for half an hour to harden it ; then 
with the ladle work all the milk from it, 
changing the water until it is clear. It is 
best to have ice water in summer if possible. 

To each pound of butter put a small table- 
spoonful of fine salt, and a small teaspoon- 
ful of fine white sugar ; work it nicely info 
the butter and make it in rolls, or pack it in 
wooden or stone vessels ; put a piece of 
muslin and a cover to keep the butler from 
the air. 

Butter should be made and kept in a cool 
cellar or ice house ; this direction is particu- 
larly for the summer, when it must be done 
in the coolest part of the day, and the coolest 
possible place. Cold water poured in occa- 
sionally, in small quantities, at the dasher, 
will make butter come better in summer. 

In warm weather milk is generally ready 
for skimming after twenty-four hours' stand- 
insr. when the cream is wanted for butter. 



which time throw it out. Winter churning 
should be done in a moderately Warm room. 

The shelves and floor of a milk room 
should be washed and wiped twice a week 
in summer, and once each week in winter. 
The place should be sweet and cool, and 
free from any mustiness, which will affect 
the milk. 

Buttermilk and sour milk are used to 
make cottage cheese, as it is sometimes 
called. Buttermilk is also a cooling summer 
drink, and very palatable, sweetened with 
sugar ; a little grated nutmeg may also be 
added. Sour milk and buttermilk are kept 
for the pigs. 

To Keep Milk and Cream in Hot Weather. 

1714. In hot weather, when it is difficult 
to preserve milk from ■ becoming sour and 
spoiling the cream, it may be kept perfectly 
sweet by scalding the new milk very gently, 
without boiling, and setting it by in the 
earthen dish or pan that it is done in. Cream 
already skimmed may be kept twenty-four 
hours if scalded without sugar; and by 
adding to it as much powdered lump sugar 
as shall make it pretty sweet will be good lor 
two days, keeping it cool. Or milk may be 
preserved fresh in warm weather by placing 
the jug which contains it in ice, or very cold 
water. 

Eolled Butter. 

1715. Well wash the interior of the mould 
with cold water, and at all times the greatest 
care must be taken that they are kept deli- 
cately clean. Press the butter into the 
mould, after which it must be opened and 
the shape carefully taken out. Serve it in 
an ornamental glass butterdish, with a little 
water at the bottom ; but if for luncheon or

the milk become scalding hot without boil- 
ing 'oefore straining it. After twelve hours 
it is fit for skimming, and the milk which 
remains will be sweet and fit for common

Butter in Haste— From Winter Cream, 
or from tlie Milk of One Cow. 

1717. Take the milk fresh from the cow ; 
strain it into clean pans. Set it over a gentle 
iire until it is scalding hot; do not let it boil. 
Then set it aside. When it is cold, skim off 
the cream ; the milk will still be fit for any 
ordinary use. When you have a sufficient 
quantity of cream, put it into a clean earthen 
basin ; beat it with a wooden spoon until 
the butter is made, which will not be long ; 
then take it from the milk and work it with 
a little cold water. Put a small tablespoon- 
ful of fine salt to each pound of butter and 
work it in ; a small spoonful of fine white 
sugar worked in with the salt is also an im- 
provement. Make the butter into a large 
roll, cover it with muslin, and keep it in a 
cool place. 

To Scald Cream, as in the West of 

England. 

Time, three-quarters of an hour over the fire. 

1718. To stand in the winter twenty-four 
hours ; twelve in the summer. 

Strain the milk into large shallow pans 
about three or four inches deep, and let it 
stand twenty-four hours ; then place the pan 
very carefully upon a hot plate, or slow fire, 
to heat gently, taking care it does not boil, 
or there will be a skim instead of a cream 
upon the milk. As soon as the cream forms 
a ring round the pan, and the undulations 
on the surface look thick, it is done : then 
remove it from the fire into the dairy, and 
let it remain for twenty-four hours, 01 if in 
cold weather, thirty-six ; then skim it for 
use. The butter usually made in Devon- 
shire of cream thus prepared is very firm and 



To Prepare Eennet to Turn Milk. 

1719. Take out the stomach of a calf as 
soon as killed, and scour it inside and out 
with salt. After it is cleared of the curds 
always found in it, let it drain a few hours ; 
then sew it up with two handfuls of salt in 
it, or stretch it on a stick, well salted ; or 
keep it in the salt wet, and soak a piece for 
use, which will do over and over again by 
washing it in fresh water. 

To Make Cheese. 

1720. Pul the milk into a large tub, warm- 
ing part of it to a degree of heat equal to 



new milk ; if too hot the cheese will be 
tough. Put in as much rennet as will turn 
it, and cover it over. Let it stand till com- 
pletely turned; then strike the curd down 
several times with the skimming-dish, and 
let it separate, still covering it. There are 
two modes of breaking the curd, and there 
will be a difference in the taste of the cheese 
according as either is observed ; one is to 
gather it with the hands very gently towards 
the side of the tub, letting the whey pass 
through the fingers till it is cleared, and lad- 
ling it off as it collects ; the other is to get 
the whey from it by early breaking the curd. 
The last method deprives it of many of its 
oily particles, and is therefore less proper. 

Put the vat on a ladder over the tub and 
fill it with curd by a skimmer, press the curd 
close with your hand, and add more as it 
sinks, and it must be finally left two inches 
above the edge. Before the vat is filled, the 
cheese-cloth must belaid at the bottom, and 
when full, drawn smooth over on all sides. 

There are two modes of salting cheese : 
one by mixing salt in the curd while in the 
tub after the whey is out ; and the other by 
putting it into the vat and crumbling the 
curd all to pieces with it after the first 
squeezing with the hands has dried it. The 
first method appears best on some accounts, 
but not on all, and therefore the custom of 
the county must direct. Put a board under 
and over the vat, and place it in the press ; 
in two hours turn it out, and put a fresh 
cheese-cloth, press it again for eight or nme 
hours, then salt it all over, and turn it again 
in the vat, and let it stand in the press four- 
teen or sixteen hours, observing to put the 
cheeses last made, undermost. Before put- 
ting them the last time into the vat pare the 
edges if they do not look smooth. The vat 
should have holes at the sides and at the 
bottom to let all the whey pass through. 
Put on clean boards, and change and scald 
them. 

To Make Sage Cheese. 

1721. Red sage leaves ; leaves ofspinach. 
Bruise the tops of some young red sage in 

a mortar with some leaves of spinach, and 
squeeze the juice ; mix it with the rennet in 
the milk, more or less according as you like 
the colour and taste. When the curd has 
come, break it gently, and put it in with the 
skimmer till it is pressed two inches above 
the vat. Press it eight or ten hours, salt it, 
and turn it every day. 

Imitation of Cheshire Cheose. 

1722. The milk being set, and the curd 
come, do not break it with a dish as is custo- 
mary in making other cheeses, but draw it 



Cream, Napkin, Artificial, and Milk Cheeses, 



321 



together with your hands to one side of the 
vessel, breaking it gently and regularly, for 
if it is pressed roughly a great deal of the 
richness of the milk will go into the whey. 
Put the curd into the cheese vat as you thus 
gather it, and when it is full, press and turn 
it often, salting it at different times. 

These cheeses must be made seven or eight 
inches in thickness, and they will be fit to 
cut in nbout twelve months. 

You must turn and move them frequently 
upon the shelf, and rub them with a coarse 
cloth. At the year's end, bore a hole in the 
middle, and pour in a quarter of a pint of 
wine. Stop up the hole with some of the 
cheese, and set it in a wine cellar for six 
months to mellow. This cheese, if properly 
managed, will be exceedingly rich and fine. 

An Excellent Cream Cheese. 
Time, three days. 

1723. One quart of good cream. 

Put a quart of good cream aside to become 
sour and very thick, then lay a piece of thin 
calico inside a small hair sieve, taking care 
that the calico comes .quite to the top, and 
rather above it, in order that you may be 
able to pull out the cheese without any diffi- 
culty ; let the sieve stand upon a dish ; pour 
the cream into the sieve and leave it to drain. 
Pour away the whey from the dish every 
morning. In about three days the cheese 
will be a proper consistency and fit to eat — 
as thick as butter, and very" delicious. If 
the cream will not all go into the sieve at 
once, pour it in during the day, as the rest 
sinks from the whey leaving it. 

At Dieppe little baskets are sold (heart- 
shape) for making cream cheeses, and an- 
swer the purpose exceedingly well, being very 
open, so that the whey drains quickly 
through the calico into the dish. 

Cream Cheese. 

Time, three or four days for the cream to 
drip ; one hour to press. 

1724. Three gills of thick cream ; one 
tablespoonful of salt. 

Take three gills of thick cream, and stir 
into it a tablespoonful of salt. Tie up the 
cream in a cloth, and let it drop for three or 
four days, changing the cloth every day. 
It must be hung upon a nail to drip, and 
when ready, on the third or fourth day, put 
it into a wooden mould, and press for one 
liour. It will then be ready for eating. 



Napkin Cheese, 

Time, three days. 

1725. One pint of thick cream ; one tea- 
spoonful of salt. 

Put a pint of thick cream and a teaspoon- 
ful of salt into a cloth, which should be 
placed in a sieve the size of a teasaucer. 
Let it stand for twenty-four hours, then turn 
it. Let it stand another whole day and turn 
it. The day following it will be ready to 
serve. 

Artificial Cheese. 

1726. One gallon of new milk ; two 
quarts of cream ; six or eight eggs ; six or 
seven tablespoonfuls of vinegar j and a little 
salt. 

Boil one gallon of milk with two quarts 
of cream, add six or eight eggs well beaten, 
and six or seven large spoonfuls of wine 
vinegar. Let it simmer until it comes to a 
tender curd, then tie it in a cheese-cloth, 
and hang it to drain for several hours, after 
which open the cloth, work some salt to the 
cheese, then lay a cloth in a colander or 
cheese-hoop, put the curd in, fold the cloth 
over, and lay a heavy weight upon it for one 
hour, or longer; then turn it on a dish and 
serve. 

Milk Cheese. 
Time, fourteen hours. 

1727. Five quarts of new milk ; two table- 
spoonfuls of rennet water. 

Put five quarts of warm milk into a bowl 
with two large spoonfuls of rennet water. 
When the curd is formed break it gently 
with the hand, drawing it to the side of the 
basin or bowl. Let it stand for two hours. 
Spread a cheese-cloth over a sieve or round 
basket, put in the curd, let it drain until all 
the whey is off, and then salt it to your taste. 
Lay a cloth in a cheese-hoop, put in the 
curd, and lay a cloth over it. Put a wooden 
cover the size of the inside of the hoop over, 
place a two pounds v eight upon it, and let 
it remain for twelve hours. Then take it 
out, put it in a frame, or tie a cloth tightly 
round it, and turn it from one side to the 
other every day until dry, then rub the out- 
side with a little butter, and sprinkle pepper 
over to keep the flies from it. Put it to ripen 
between two pewter plates. If the weather 
is warm it will be ready in tliree weeks, if 
cold it will require a longer time.

Family Brewing. 

Not many persons in the present day 
brew at home ; but as some few might wish 
to do so, we give the following receipt sup- 
plied by a friend, and used in his family. 

1776. Four bushels of malt ; sixty gallons 
of water; (for small beer, after the first is 
drawn off, forty more gallons); three pounds 
of good Farnham hops ; three-quarters of a 
pint of yeast. 

The copper should hold forty gallons of 
water, which should, when boihng, be put 
into the mash vat. When it has stood until 
you can see your face in the water, then 
mash the malt in it, and stir it well till it is 
all wet. Cover it up with sacks to keep in 
the steam. To four bushels of malt put 
forty gallons of boiling water, let it stand 
one hour and a half, then add huenty g2\\an% 
more water, let it stand two hours and a 
half longer, which will make in the whole 
four hours. When you add the water to the 
malt the second time, wet the hops with a 
bucket or two of boiling water. During this 
time the brewer should scald his barrel, and 
have forty gallons of boiling water ready to 
go on the malt when the first liquor is drawn 
off, which will make good small beer. Three 
pounds of good Farnham hops will be suffi- 
cient for this quantity, which we call ale and 
small beer. Be sure to boil your first wort 
with the hops at least three-quarters of an 
hour ; keep it boiling all the time — gallop- 
ing; (boil the small beer the same time). 
Then strain oft the wort, in the shade if 
possible. When it is lukewarm, put it into 
the tun tub, and set it to work with half a 
pint of yeast. The next day draw it off into 



the barrel. When the beer has done ferment- 
ing, bung it down close; observe to paste 
brown paper over the vent hole with a little 
yeast, lest it should ferment, which is some- 
times the case, but be sure to keep it 
stopped down as soon as the fermentation is 
over. The casks should hold thirty-three or 
thirty-six gallons. You will find a small 
barrel very useful to hold the overplus of ale 
which you will sometimes have, and which 
will be fit to drink sooner. Observe the 
same rules with strong beer, only with the 
addition of one and a half bushels of malt 
more, and two pounds of hops, and then 
your second tun will be very good table 
beer, and you may make ^twenty gallons of 
small beer for common use. Be sure to 
see the barrels are well cleaned with scalding 
(not boiling) water. A yard of small chain 
is a very good thing to put into the barrels, 
to clean them. Very much depends on the 
cleanliness of the vessels. As soon as the 
casks are empty be sure to cork them close, 
or they will get musty, which can never be 
remedied. You may add yeast to the small 
beer, and tun it as soon as it is cold. You 
must not stir the mash when you add the 
water to the first beer, but pour it milk-warm 
over the top of the malt. 

Directions for Brewing in Cottages- 
Time, three or four days. 

1777. One peck of malt ; two ounces of 
hops ; six gallons of water ; a few birch 
twigs, or a little wheat straw ; one teacupful 
of yeast. 

Boil three gallons of water ; take it off as 
soon as it boils, and let it stand till you can 
see your face in it, While the water is 
heating, get ready a clean rinsing-tub with a 
small hole bored in the bottom, and stopped 
with a peg or cork. Cover it with a few 
birch twigs or some clean wheat straw, put 
a coarse bit of cloth over the bottom of the 
tub, then put in the malt. Pour the water 
on it, and stir it well for a few minutes. 
Cover it close with a sack, and let it stand 
for three days to keep warm near the fire ; 
then pull out the peg or cork, and let the 
whole run into a bucket. Put the peg in 
again immediately, and having prepared 
another three gallons of water just as you 
did before, pour it on the malt, and set it by 
the fire as before, covered close, for two 
hours. As soon as you have emptied the 
second three gallons of water out of the 
boiler, put into it the first run from the malt, 
and boil it a quarter of an hour with the 
hops. Strain it through a sieve into a shal- 
low vessel to cool as quickly as possible. 

Run off the second three gallons, and boil

COOKERY FOR THE SICK. 



A good nurse is frequently of as much im- 
portance as a skilful physician; and "kitchen 
physic, " as it has been called, is often of the 
first importance. Every mother of a family 
ought to know how to cater for the fitful 
apf)etite and weak digestion of an invalid. 
A truly loving and tender woman would 
rather prepare the food of her beloved and 
suffering child, or of her husband, than trust 
it to the care of an ordinary cook. It has 
been our fate to be much thrown with sick- 
ness, and we liave carefully garnered to- 
gether many strengthening prescriptions in 
the way of food, whiich we can assure the 
reader have had the test of use and e.xpe- 
rience. We subjoin them, with some few 
commoner preparations for the sick-room. 

Arrowroot; 

1778. Half a pint of milk; one dessert- 
spoonful of arrowroot; sugar to taste; lemon 
peel. 

Take care to get the very best arrowroot, 
as many imitations are sold. Mix a dessert- 
spoonful with a little cold water till it is 
quite smooth. Boil half a pint of milk ; 
pour it on the arrowroot, while boiling, 
stirring it all the time. Add a lump or two 
of sugar, and a little lemon peel. 

Water Arrowroot. 

1779. One dessertspoonful of arrowroot ; 
one gill of water; sugar; one tablespoonful 
of brandy, or one wineglass of wine. 

Mix a dessertspoonful of arrowroot with a 
little water very smooth. Have ready water 
in a kettle quite boiling. Pour it on the 
arrowroot till it becomes clear, stirring it all 
the time. A few lumps of sugar and the 
wine or brandy can be mixed with it before 
pouring the boiling water on it, using the 
wine or brandy to mix the arrowroot with 
instead of the water. 

Bread Jelly. 

1780. One roll ; one lemon ; one quart of 
water; sugar to taste. 

Take the crumb of a penny roll; cut it 
into thin slices, and toast them of a pale 
brown on both sides. Put them into a quart 
of spring water. Let it simmer over the 



fire till it has become a jelly. Strain it 
through a thin cloth, and flavour it imme- 
diately with a little lemon juice and sugar. 

Broth — Chicken. 

1781. Take an old fowl; stew it to pieces 
with a couple of onions. Season hghtly 
with pepper and salt; skim and strain it. 

Port Wine Jelly. 
Time, fifteen or twenty minutes. 

1782. One pint of port wine ; one ounce 
of isinglass ; one ounce of sugar; a quarter 
of a pint of water. 

Put the isinglass and sugar into a quarter 
of a pint of water. Set it over the fire till 
the isinglass is dissolved; then add the wine. 
Strain it through a jelly bag or a clean piece 
of muslin into a jar or mould, and let it set. 
It is best to put it into a jar, to cover it till 
cold, and give a piece about the size of a 
walnut two or three times a day to the 
patient. 

This jelly may be made to drink hot 
thus: — 

Put a teaspoonful of melted isinglass to 
one wineglass of port wine, adding one 
clove and a lump of sugar. Make it hot 
over an etna. 

Port Wine Jelly. 

1783. One bottle of port wine; two ounces 
of gum arable; two ounces of sugarcandy; 
two ounces of isinglass. 

Put all these ingredients into a jar, stand 
it in a saucepan of water, and keep it sim- 
mering till all is dissolved. 

Weaker Wine Jelly for Invalids. 

Time, altogether, half an hour. 

1784. The juice of two oranges ; the peel 
of one; yolks 01 four eggs; half an ounce of 
isinglass ; half a pint of sherry or white 
wine; half a pint of water; loaf sugar to 
taste. 

Put the isinglass into hot water and gra- 
dually dissolve it, then stir in as much loaf 
sugar as is approved, with the juice of the 
oranges strained, and the peel cut very thin ; 
well beat the yolks of the eggs with the

wine; put all into a saucepan and let it 
simmer for a minute or two, not boil ; stir- 
ring it all the time, then let it stand a short 
time before putting it into a mould, which 
must be previously soaked in cold water. 
This quantity makes a pint, and if good 
sherry and new-laid eggs are used, it will be 
found excellent for invalids. 

A Strong Broth. 
Time, nearly four hours. 

1785. One pound of veal ; one pound of 
b&ef ; one pound of the scrag end of a neck 
of mutton; a little salt; three quarts of water. 

Put the above quantities into three quarts 
of water, with a little salt, and a few whole 
peppers. Boil it until reduced to one quart. 

Calfs Feet. 
Time, four hours. 

1786. Two calfs feet; two pints of water; 
one pint of new milk ; a little lemon peel or 
mace. 

Put the ingredients into a jar, cover it 
down, and keep it in the oven for four hours. 
When cold, remove the fat. Flavour it with

valid's tea, morning and evening, a good

of water, one clove, a lump of sugar, and a 
little salt. Cover the saucepan as tightly as

feet, and the jelly from the sediment very 
carefully. Put the jelly into a stewpan with

is thoroughly drawn from the lemon, put in 
the whites of the eggs well beaten, and their

fire, and let it boil for twenty minutes; but 
do not stir it after the &%g has been added. 
Dip a jelly bag into hot water and squeeze 
it dry; run the jelly through it several times

Luncheons. — Croquet Tea, 



LUNCHEONS. 



Lunchpon difFers from dinner in large 
households only in the general absence of 
soup and fish, and in the mode of serving ; 
both meat, game, vegetables, puddings, 
fruit, &c., being placed on the table at the 
same time. 

Luncheons in small families (not of large 
means) generally consist of the cold meat or 
poultry left from dinner ; of cake, bread, 
cheese, &c.; but this slight repast ought to be 
properly served at all times, so that the ser- 
vant may never feel awkward at the presence 



of unexpected guests. The butter should 
be sent up in summer in a glass dish with 
water ; in winter garnished with parsley. 
The bread should be placed on the table on 
a wooden platter; the cheese on a nice cheese 
cloth. Everything must be as neat and nice 
as possible. We give two specimens of 
luncheons, such as are ordinarily sent up for 
guests. Home luncheons must be directed 
by the mistress of the family, according to 
her taste and means.

Desserts. 



The dessert is placed on the table from 
the first in the dinners i la Russe ; but 
sometimes the top and bottom dishes are 
added after the dinner is over. Even at 
family dinners this mode is the best. Be- 
tween and amongst the dishes it is usual to 
pyt small glass dishes with preserved ginger, 



damson cheese, candied apricots, or any other [ quired for the gentlemen, 



of the sweet dishes given in our dessert re- 
ceipts. Roasted chesnuts should be sent up 
hot on a folded table-napkin. We prefer al- 
monds blanched for the raisins, but some 
people like them better in their skins. A 
few wine biscuits should be put round the 
centre cake, and olives are sometimes re- 



Suppers. 



A lady has full space for exercising her 
taste at the supper table. A good eye for 
colour will give a great charm to the ar- 
rangement. With flowers, fruit, frothed 
whipped creams, coloured jellies, <ind all 
the elegance of sweet dishes, she can 
scarcely fail to offer a perfect picture of 
gastronomic beauty to the eye, if she will 
take a little care in the arrangement of the 
table herself. A plan drawn out on paper 
and given to an intelligent servant, will 



secure her from mistakes generally ; if her 
footman is inexperienced, she should first 
glance at the table herself before her guests 
are invited to it. For two or three evening 
guests, a few sandwiches, a cake, fruit, and 
wine will suffice, as people now generally 
dine late. We offer the plan of two suppers, 
not so elaborate as those provided by Gunter 
would be, but sufficient for ordinary enter- 
tainments.

XJSEFTJL RECEIPTS FOB. HOUSEKEEPERS AND 
SERVANTS. 



To Clean Ciimney Pieces. 

1819. Equal quantities of soft soap and 
pearlash. 

Put tlie soap and pearl-ash on the chimney 
piece with a soft flannel, let it lay on tiie 
marble for a few minutes. Wash it off with 
warm water not too hot ; wash it over a 
second time with cold spring water. 

For Bright Polished Grates. 

1820. Oil the bright part of the grate with 
good salad oil, dust over it some unslacked 
lime from a mus'tin bag. Let it remain one 
month, then rub it off with a fine rag. 
Polish it with a leather and a very little 
putty powder. If the grate is not in use 
put on the oil again. 

To Take Sta-ns out of Marhle. 
1S21. Mi.Ked unslacked lime in finest 
powtier with the stronger soap-lye pretty 
thick, and inslantly with a painter's brush 
lay it on the whole of the marble. In two 
months' time wash it off perfectly clean. 
Then have ready a fine thick lather of soft 
soap, boiled in soft water, dip a brush in it, 
and scour the marble with powder not as 
common cleaning. This will, by very good 
rubbing, give a beautiful polish. Clear off 
the soap, and finish with a smooth hard 
brush till the end be effected. 

To Take Rnst out of Steel. 

1822. Cover the steel with sweet oil well 
rubbed in, and in forty-eight hours use un- 
slacked lime finely powdeicd, and rub until 
ail the rust disappears. 

To Cement Broken China. 

1823. Beat lime to a very fine almost in- 
visible dust, sift it through book muslin. 
Then tie it up in a piece of thin muslin as 
powdered starch is sometimes used. Brush 
some white of egg over the edges of the 
china, dust the lime r.iridly over them, put 
the edges together, and tie a string round 
the cup, &c., till it is firm. 

Isinglass dissolved in spirits of wine, in 
the proportion of one ounce to two wine- 
glassfuls of the spirit, is also a good cement. 

For Removing Paint fi-om Wood. 

1824. One pound of washing soda ; two 
pomids of unslacked lime. 

Mix one pound of washing soda with two 



pounds of unslacked lime, and if the paint is 
very strong on the wood add half a pound 
of pofash. Mix these ingredients together, 
and dilute with water until the mixture be- 
comes rather thicker than whitewash, and 
then rub it on the paint with a piece of 
■wood folded up in rag. The person who 
uses this preparation must be careful not to 
touch it with the hands. 

To Clean Paper-hangings. 

1825. First blow the dust off with the 
bellows. Divide a white loaf of eight days 
old into eight parts. Take the crust into 
your hand, and, beginning at the top of the 
paper, wipe it downwards in the lightest 
manner with the crumb. Do not cross or 
go upwards. The dirt of the paper and the 
crumbs will fall together. Observe — you 
must not wipe abcA'e half a yard at a stroke, 
and after doing all the upper part go round 
again, beginning a little above were you left 
off. If you do not clean it very lightly you 
will make the dirt adhere to the paper. 

To Clean Glazed Chintz Furniture when 
taken down for the Summer. 

1826. Shake off the loose dust, then 
lightly brush with a small long-haired fur- 
niture brush ; after which, wipe it closely 
v/ith clean flannels, and rub it with dry 
bread. If properly done, the curtains will 
look nearly as well as at first, and if the 
colour be not light they will not require 
washing for years. Fold in large parcels 
and put carefully by. 

While the furniture remains up, it should 
be preserved from the sun and air as much 
as possible, which injure delicate colours ; 
and the dust iviay be blown off by bellow-s. 
By th.e above method, curtains may be kept 
sufficiently clean, to malce up again with new 
linings. 

To Remove Paint Stains from Glass 
Windows- 

1827. It frequently happens that painters 
splash the plate or other glass windows when 
they are painting the sills. When this is the 
case, melt some soda in very hot water and 
wash them with it, using a soft flanneL It 
will entirely remove tiie paint. 

Tahle Polish. 

1828. Half a pint of spirits of wine ; an 
ounce and a halJf of §um shellac ; h^f an 



344 



Useful Receipts. 



ounce of gum benzoin ; half an ounce of 
gum sandrac. 

Put the whole in a bottle for a day or two, 
and shake it a few times. When the gums 
are dissolved it is fit for use. 

When the polish is laid on thick enough, 
take a clean wad and cloth ; put a little 
clean spirits of wine on the wad, the same 
as you did with the polish, rub it the same 
way, but very lightly, and until quite dry. 
You must then put a little oil on the cloth, 
and rub as in laying on the polish. 

Another Fiu-niture Polish. 

T829. Three gills of cold drawn oil : one 
gill of turpentine ; one gill of varnish of tur- 
pentine ; one of vinegar. 

These quantities will fill a quart bottle. 

Pour a few drops in the middle of the 
table, add a teaspoonful of cold spring 
water, and rub with a soft cloth. 

To Clean Covers and Tins- 

1830. Half a pound of soap ; a ball of 
pounded whitening ; sufficient warm water 
to make it of the consistency of very thick 
cream. 

Shred the soap into a jug, add a large 
ball of pounded whitening, and pour in suf- 
ficient warm water to make it of the consist- 
ency of a thick cream ; rub it well over the 
tins, and when dry, polish them with a clean 
leather and powdered whitening. 

To Clean Plate. 

1831. One ounce of prepared hartshorn- 
powder ; one quart of water. 

Boil an ounce of prepared hartshorn- 
powder in a quart of water ; while on the 
fire, put into it as much plate as the vessel 
will hold ; let it boil a few minutes, take it 
out, drain it over the saucepan, and dry it 
near the fire. Then put into the water some 
pieces of linen, and let them remain to soak 
up all the water. When dry, put them aside 
to clean the plate, &c. When the plate is 
dry, rub it well with wash leather. 

To Make Blacking. 

1832. Four ounces of ivory black ; three 
ounces of treacle ; a tablespoonful of sweet 
oil; a pint and a half of small beer; one 
ounce of sulphuric acid. 

Mix with a spoonful of sweet oil the four 
ounces of ivory black, and the three ounces 
of treacle ; pour on it by degrees a pint and 
a half of small beer. Stir it well together, 
and then pour in an ounce of sulphuric acid, 
keeping it till the effervescence ceases ; 
bottle it, and it may be used immediately. | 



A Receipt for Blacking. 

1833. Two ounces of sugarcandy ; one 
ounce of sulphuric acid ; half an ounce of 
gum arable ; a quarter of an ounce of blue 
indigo ; half an ounce of turpentine ; four 
ounces of ivory black ; two tablespoonfuls 
of oil ; one quart of good vinegar. Mix all 
together. 

To Bleach Linen. 

1834. A quarter of a pound of chloride of 
lime ; one gallon of water. 

Pour a gallon of boiling water over four 
ounces of chloride of lime ; let it stand two 
days, stirring it occasionally, then pour it 
clear off into bottles. To bleach linen take 
about half a pint, and mi.x it with a quart or 
three pints of cold spring water. Mix it well 
together, and after the linen is washed and 
rinsed from the soap, steep it in the hme 
water for a few hours. 

To Take Stains out of Silk or Clotli. 

1835. Pound some French chalk fine, and 
mix it with warm water to the thickness of 
mustard. Put it on the spots, rub it lightly 
with your finger, or the palm of your hand. 
Put a sheet of blotting, and of brown paper, 
over the spots, and press it with a warm iron. 

To Take Grease out of Silk. 

1836. Take a lump of magnesia, and rub 
it wet on the spot ; let it dry, then brush it 
off, and the spot will disappear. 

To Take off Wax-Candle Grease. 

1837. Have an iron made very hot; put a 
piece of clean blotting-paper over the spot, 
and hold the iron close to it, but do not let 
it touch the paper. The grease will be 
drawn into the paper. 

To Wash Coloured Prints and Washing 
Silks. * 

1838. Put a little bran into lukewarm 
water, wash quickly through ; rinse in cold 
water also, quickly. Hang to dry in a room 
.without fire or sunshine. Iron on wrong 
side with a coolish iron. No soap to be used. 

To Clean an Old Silk Dress. 

1839. Unpick the dress, and brush it with 
a velvet brush. Then grate two large pota- 
toes into a quart of water ; let it stand to 
settle ; strain it off quite clear, and sponge 
the dress with it. Iron it on the wrong side, 
as the ironed side will be shiny.

chemist is not of easy access. 

To Cure "Warts. 

1847. Warts are very trotiblesome and dis- 
figuring. The following is a perfect cure, 
even of the largest, without leaving any scar. 
It is a Frencliman's prescription, and has 
been tested in the author's family. 

Take a small piece of raw beef, steep it all 
night in vinegar, cut as much from it as will 
cover the wart, tie it on it ; or if the excres- 
sence is on the forehead, fasten it on with

DUTIES OF HOUSEHOLD SERVANTS. 



Duties of the Maid of all Work. 

The general servant must be an early 
riser. 

Her first duty, of course, is to open the 
shutters, and in summer the windows of all 
the lower part of the house. 

Then she must clean the kitchen range 
and hearth, sifting the cinders, clearing 
away the ashes, and polishing with a leather 
the bright parts of the stove, or range. 

She must light the fire, fill the kettle, and 
as soon as the fire burns, set it on to boil. 

She must then clean the room in which 
the family breakfast. She must roll up the 
rug, spread out a coarse piece of canvas 
before the fireplace, and (if it is winter) she 
must remove the fender, clean the grate, 
and light the fire. Then she must just 
lightly rub over the fire-irons with a leather, 
replace them, and the fender, and sweep 



the room over, first pinning up the curtains 
out of the dust. 

She should let the dust settle for a few 
minutes, running meantime into the kitchen 
to get the breakfast things ready to bring in. 
In five minutes or so she must return, and 
thoroughly dust all the furniture, the ledges 
about the room, the mantelpiece, and all 
oinaments. Not a speck of dust should be 
left on any object in the room. Then she 
lays the breakfast cloth ready for breakfast, 
and shuts the dining, or breakfast-room 
door. 

Her next duty is to sweep the hall, or 
passage, shake the door-mats, clean the 
door-step, and polish the brass knocker, if 
there is one. Then she cleans the boots, 
washes her hands and face, puts on a clean 
apron, and prepares the toast, eggs, bacon, 
kidneys, or whatever is re(^uired for break- 
fast. 



Duties of the Maid of All Work. 



347 



Previously, however, she will carry in the 
urn that her mistress iv.ay make the tea. 

She then has her own breakfast, goes up 
to the bedrooms, opens the windows, strips 
the bedclothes off, and leaves the mattresses 
or beds open. 

By this time probably the bell will ring 
for her to clear away the breakfast things. 
She should do this quickly and carefully ; 
bring a dustpan, and sweep up the crumbs, 
put back tlie chairs, make up the fice, and 
sweep up the hearth. 

The china must be washed and put away, 
and the kitchen tidied a little. Her mistress 
will then give her orders about dinner. 

As soon as these are settled, she will put 
on a large clean apron in which to make 
the beds, that she may not soil the bed- 
clothes with her working dress. The mis- 
tress of the house generally assists a maid 
of all work in making the beds, but this is 
by no means a ri^ht of the servant's, and 
very frequently she has to do them alone. 

In making beds, she should carefully turn 
the mattresses every day, shake the feather 
beds well, and rub out any lumps that may 
have gathered in them. The sheets should 
always be placed with the marked end 
towards the pillow. 

When the beds are made and slops 
emptied, the rooms should be carefully 
dusted. 

Then she sweeps down the stairs, and 
dusts the banisters. She sweeps the dust 
from each stair into a dustpan, and is care- 
ful that no dust flies about the passage, or 
hall which she has already dusted. 

She now cleans the drawing-room grate 
(if a fire is burnt there), and dusts the room. 

Dusting the ornaments is often done by 
the mistress, but cannot always be expected. 

The maid of all work returns to the 
kitchen, puts on a large canvas apron which 
will tie all round her, and which has a bib, 
and proceeds to cook her dinner. While 
the meat is roasting or boiling, any little 
kitchen work which will not take her away 
from the neighbourhood of the fireplace, 
may be done. 

Half an hour before taking up her dinner, 
she will lay her cloth nicely, according to 
the directions given in " Footman's Duties," 
and will set bread, &c., &c., ready on the 
sideboard. 

She cannot, of course, be expected to wait 
at table, but she should remove her coarse 
apron, and be ready to bring in the pud- 
ding, or tart, or cheese when required. 

When she has taken away the dinner 
(she will do wisely to place the joint to 
warm before the kitchen fire for her own 
dinner), she sweeps and folds up the table- 



cloth, sweeps up the crumbs under the 
dining-table, makes up the fire (if required), 
or if the room is left vacant, opens the 
windows. 

Then she dines herself, spreading her 
own cloth nicely, and giving herself time 
for a comfortable meal. 

After dinner, she has a kettle of boiling 
water ready, washes up the dishes and plates, 
cleans the knives (washing the grease off 
carefully bt-fore she rubs them on the knife- 
board), washes the silver spoons and forks, 
and just rubs them over with the leather ; 
cleans any boots and shoes required, and 
then cleans up her kitchen, sweeps up the 
hearth, and goes to wash and dress herself. 

Her next duty is to bring in the tea, make 
the toast, &c. 

After tea, she turns down the beds, sees 
that there is water in every jug and bottle, 
shuts the windows, and draws down the 
blinds. These are the ordinary daily duties; 
but in order that the house may be well 
cleaned, every bedroom should be swept 
ojice a week, and the tins and silver must 
have weekly attention beyond that of the 
daily washing. 

A good servant will manage her work by 
division. 

For example : — On Saturday she will 
thoroughly clean the hall, i.e., wash the 
canvas, rub any mahogany, &c., and sweep 
the stairs very thoroughly, occasionally 
taking up the stair-carpets, and replacing 
them so that they may not wear out by the 
same part being always at tlie edge of the 
stairs. She must also rub and clean the 
brass rods. 

She will seldom have more than four bed- 
rooms to do. She can sweep two on 
Tuesday; the drawing-room may be 
thoroughly swept on Wednesday ; two bed- 
rooms may be swept on Thursday ; the 
mahogany furniture, &c., well polished in 
the dining-room on Friday. On Saturday 
she will clean the plate, and her tins — as 
covers, &c. — and clean up her kitchen for 
Sunday. i 

A good servant will generally wash up the 
glasses and plates after supper, and not 
leave them for the morning. She will care- 
fully fasten up the house. : 

The general servant should ask her mis- 
tress for housemaid's gloves, and endeavour, 
as much as possible, to keep her hands 
clean, so as never to leave smutty marks of 
fingers on anything she touches. Her hair 
should be banded carefully back, and be 
kept smooth, and her face clean ; and as 
she has to answer the door, she should wear 
her coarse ajwoa as much as possible, ana 
at a knock or ring exchange it for a clean

white one, kept within reach — for instance, 
in the kitchen drawer. 

She should be careful never to pour the 
water in which eggs have been boiled over 
her hands, as it will bring warts. If her 
hands get chapped in winter, she will do 
weir to rub them with a httle camphor-ball 
when she goes to bed at night. 

We insist on this care for the hands, not 
to encourage fine ways or vanity, but be- 
cause a general servant's hands are used 
both for very dirty and very clean work, 
and without care they will be unfit for the 
latter. 

Recollect, my little general servant, that 
if your place is a hard one, it is also the 
best possible one for training you for a 
better. After all, too, you have not more 
to do, nor, in fact,' so much as you would 
have as the mistress of your own home 
when married, when you would probably 
have to clean house, work for your family's 
support, and take care of children, besides 
enduring anxiety and the many cares of 
the mother and wife. 

In your place you have no care for daily 
bread or clothes. Your food and raiment 
are sure, and you have every comfort. 

If you rise early, bustle about, and waste 
no spare moments, you will get through 
your work very well — only do think about 
it. A little arrangement and thought will 
give you METHOD and habit, two fairies 
that will make the work disappear before a 
ready pair of hands. If, when you put your 
head on your pilllow, you would just//a« 
how best to get through next day's work, 
you would find it a great help. 

Try not to forget orders. Do everything 
as well as possible at once. Remember, 
"Once well done is twice done;" "A 
place for everything, and everything in its j 
place." 

Be sure always to wash china, i.e., cups, 
saucers, p'ates in very hot water, with a 
little soda occasionally (but not if they have 
gilt edges), and w'pe them dry on a very 
clean dry cloth. A wet dirty cloth will make 
them smeary and sticky, than which nothing 
can be more nasty. 

Find time for your own work of an even- 
ing, and take care to leave no holes in your 
stockings, or rents unmended. "A stitch 
in time saves nine ;" and if every Saturday 
night you mend all fractures, both in the 
clothes that return and those that are going 
to the wash, you will keep your needlework 
nicely under. 

Be personally clean. It is the great charm 
of ladies ; and a good wash all over every 
night before going to bed will refresh you, 
make you healthy, prettier, arid tppre 



cheerful than if you fell asleep still dirty 
from your daily toil. 

Be active, cheerful, good-tempered, and 
obliging, and you will find work easy 
and employers kind. 

Do your daily duties "with all your 
might," remembering Whose eye is always 
on you ; and believe that the Great King 
who gives us all our daily work to do, will 
not leave unmarked the eiforts of even a 
little maid of all work. " - 

Duties of the Housemaid. 

The duties of the housemaid require order, 
method, and great cleanliness to be well 
fulfilled. If more than one is kept, the 
work will be fairly divided between them, 
but whether divided, or done by one, its 
nature is still the same. 

A housemaid, if she wishes to get her 
work done easily and with comfort, should 
be an early riser. She should get up at six 
in summer, and half-past six or seven in 
winter ; though, of course, much must de- 
pend (as to hours) on the rules of the ser- 
vice in which she is engaged. 

Her first care on going downstairs from 
her bedroom will be to open the shutters of 
the sitting-rooms. If it is winter, she must 
take up the hearth-rugs, and move the 
fenders. She should then spread a piece of 
coarse wrapping canvas before the grates, 
and clean the latter, after which she lights 
the fire. She must have a tin cinder-pail, 
with a wire sifter to sift the cinders, a house- 
maid's box, with black-lead, and her stove- 
brushes. With a soft brush she will lay on 
the blacklead, and then polish it with a 
proper brush for that purpose. It is a great 
I credit to a housemaid when her grates are 
nicely polished. She should regularly every 
morning rub with a dry leather all the 
polished parts of a grate, and also the 
fender and fire-irons. Generally there are 
two sets of bars to a drawing-room grate- 
bright steel, for summer use, and black for 
winter. If constantly well rubbed, no rust 
will ever appear on them. Should any be 
accidentally found, a receipt for removing 
rust-spots will be found in this book. 

And now about lighting the fires. If this 
is done badly the room will be filled with 
smoke, which is very injurious to furniture. 
It is well when first winter fires are com- 
menced to hold a blazing paper up the 
chimney for a few minutes before the first 
fire is hghted. This will dispel the cold air 
in the chimney, which may otherwise beat 
the smoke down into the room. The fire is 
laid by placing first cinders, rather apart, at 
the bottom of the grate ; then a piece of

pAper — not coarse brown, which will 
smoulder — and then a few crossbars of 
pieces of wood, which should be kept well 
dried ; on the wood some rubbly coals — not 
too close together, for a draught is required 
to kindle the fuel. The coals must be well 
back in the grate. Light with a lucifer 
match — use Bryant and May's, because they 
will not ignite unless they are rubbed on 
their own Idox, and thus they are less dan- 
gerous than those which will kindle by 
stepping on. 

If the grate smokes, light the fire from 
the top. In order to achieve this properly, 
cover the bottom of the grate with a piece 
of coarse thick paper ; build a wall of rubbly 
coals round, leaving a hole in the middle; 
cover it all with a piece of dry paper ; lay 
pieces of wood crossing each other on it ; 
then put a piece more paper, and steady it 
with a few good cinders. Set light to the 
under paper. The sticks, &c., will kindle, 
and fall into the hollow centre. In about an 
hour there will be a good fire, which will not 
smoke, but must never be stirred. This is a 
very saving way of making a fire, as so j 
lighted it consumes much less fuel. 1 

Some persons light fkes with wheels made 
with resin and other combustible materials. 
They are useful, and perhaps cheaper than 
wood, but not very safe things in a house, 
as they easily ignite. The housemaid should 
be careful not to waste wood. A clever girl 
will light two fires, if the grates are not very 
large, with one good-sized bundle. One 
wheel, value one farthing, will light a fire. 
The housemaid, when she has lighted the 
drawing-room fire, does those in the bed- 
rooms, when required ; but this will be the 
work generally of the under housemaid. 
Where only two servants are kept — cook and 
housemaid — the former is generally engaged 
to do the dining-room, as well as the hall. 

The housemaid should wear proper house- 
maid's gloves for doing her grates ; and ha%'e 
a good coarse apron to tie all round her, to 
preserve her dress clean. 

If it is summer, all the labour of fire- 
making will be saved ; but the housemaid 
must look jealously to the polishing of her 
bright bars, grates, and fire-irons, lest they 
rust. Her ne.vt business is to carry away 
her boxes, &c. ; and then sweep the room. 
While the dust settles she carries hot water 
to the bedrooms, in any quantity that may 
be required. Dusting and polishing the 
furniture is the next duty, and this should 
be done very carefully with the dusting- 
brush and duster. Every ledge should be 
dusted — the window-panes, the legs of 
chairs, tables, &c., as well as their tops — 
books, pictures, &c. Cobwebs must be 



watched for; and the ceiling sometimes 
dusted with the long broom called a Turk's 
head. After her morning-room or drawing- 
room is finished, the housemaid sweeps 
down the stairs. 

She then puts on a clean white apron, and 
making herself look as nice and fresh as 
possible, lays the breakfast-table, if no foot- 
man or parlourmaid is kept. She takes 
care to place everything that can possibly be 
required on the table— sees that there are 
enough spoons, plates, knives, forks, &c. 
(the mode of arranging the cups, &c., will 
be found at " Breakfast Dishes," page 65). 
She brings in the breakfast, which the cook 
prepares and gives to her. 

As soon as all is brought in, she leaves the 
room, ties on a large clean apron, kept for 
the purpose, and goes up to make the beds 
(assisted by the cook, where only two ser- 
vants are kept). She should open all the 
bedroom windows ; strip the bedclothes off, 
placing them over the backs of two chairs ; 
then, while the beds are airing, she empties 
the slops. She washes out all the bedroom 
china with very hot water, wipes it (taking 
care to keep a separate towel for the basin 
and jug), empties the bath", and then takes 
away the pail, and scalds it out. 

It will now be time to shake the beds, 
turn the mattresses, and make them up 
again. Then she should take a hand-brush 
and dust-pan, and sweep over the carpet 
sufficiently to remove any dust. Her next 
act will be to dust and polish the furniture ; 
then to do all window-ledges, windows, 
banister-rails, &c., &c. ; after which she 
will bring up water, and fill the jugs and 
water-boules . 

She brings the bedroom candlesticks 
down, cleans them, and sets up the candles. 
The moderator lamps should then be care- 
fully trimmed, i.e., the wicks cut or re- 
newed, oil poured in all ready for lighting at 
night. 

The bedrooms must be thoroughly swept, 
I each once a week. The drawing-room twice 
a week; but the, little pieces of flue and 
j dust should be swept up every day with the 
1 short brush into the dust-pan. 
j Wlien the room is to be thoroughly swept, 
I covers should be thrown over the sofas, 
j ottomans, &c., and the window-curtains 
I should be carefully raised and pinned up till 
j the sweeping is finished, then they should be 
I well shaken out again. Highly-glazed chinta 
I curtains may be kept clean for years, if they 
! are occasionally taken down and wiped aU 
over with a very clean duster. 
i By one, or half-past one o'clock, the 
housemaid ought to be dressed for the after- 
noon, and ready to bring in the luncheon or 



3§a 



Duties of the Cook. 



early dinner. She must then lay the cloth 
for either meal, and be ready to bring in the 
dishes and wait table. 

She does not wait luncheon ; but leaving 
plates, &c.. and all that may be required on 
the dumb-waiter or waggon, goes to her own 
dinner. Though, if it is an early dinner — 
not luncheon — the servants generally dine 
after the family. 

She will then, when the dinner is re- 
moved, rub the mahogany table with a 
duster, to remove any marks of dishes, and 
sweep up the crumbs, leaving the window 
open for a time to remove the smell of din- 
ner. 

She washes up the glass and silver (the 
latter should be just rubbed with a leather 
when it is dried from the hot water), and 
sets everything to rights, and prepares for 
tea. She will, of course, have time in the 
afternoon for doing needlework, such as 
mending the stockings, &c., or the house- 
linen, if required. 

She lays the tea, removes it, washes up 
the tea-things, turns down the beds, takes 
away all slops, shuts the windows, draws 
down the blinds, and places the bedroom 
candles in the hall ready for use. 

Daties of the Cook. 

When two servants only are kept, the cook 
is expected to clean the dining-room, as 
well as the hall, passage, steps, &c. Of 
course, everything relating to the cleaning of 
the kitchen, scullery, &c., will also belong 
to you. 

When this dirty morning work is done, 
you should carefully wash your hands, and 
visit the larder. Here you should look to 
everything ; see if the hanging meat or 
game requires cookiiig, change the soup to 
prevent its getting sour, and wipe out the 
bread-pan. The larder should be scrubbed 
and cleaned out twice a week. 

Receive your mistress's orders attentively; 
and if your memory cannot be relied on, 
write them on a slate. 

Don't "scatter" in the kitchen. Clear up 
as you go, and be sure to put scalding water 
into each saucepan or stewpan as you finish 
using it. 

Weigh the joints the butcher brings you ; 
and never omit asking him for the paper of 
weight. Examine the meat, and if it is not 
good do not receive it. 

Keep a strict account of the milk, bread, 
&c. , used weekly ; and have an eye to your 
mistress's interest, not permitting waste of 
any kind in the kitchen. 

A cook who is just and honest, and does 



as she would be done by, is worthy of the 
greatest respect, and may be sure of being 
successful and happy. 

.And now let us give our good inexpe- 
rienced friend a few hints as to kitchen-work. 

Keep your sjiice-box always replenished ; 
and take care to let your mistress know if 
you are out of anything likely to be required, 
that its place may be supplied at once. 

Be scrupulously careful not to use a knife 
that has cut onions for any other purpose. 
Put it carefully aside to be cleaned. 'Take 
care if you have copper utensils to use that 
the tin does not become worn off. If so, 
have it instantly replaced. Dry your sauce- 
pans before you put them away. 

Pudding cloths and jelly bags require care. 
Wash the pudding cloths, scald them, and 
hang them to dry directly after using them, 
and keep them in a warm dry place, well 
airing them before you put them away, or 
they will smell musty. After washing up 
dishes wash out the tubs used for the pur- 
pose with soap and water, and soda. Scrub 
them often. Stand them up sideways to 
dry. Keep the sink and sink brush very 
clean, and be careful never to throw anything 
but water down the former, lest you should 
choke it up ; but never pour cabbage water 
down, as the smell is so unpleasant that it 
should always be carried outside the house, 
and thrown away where it is not likely to be 
perceived. Never have sticky, greasy plates 
and dishes. The way to avoid this is to use 
very hot water, and clean dr>' towels. Change 
the water when it is greasy. Perfectly clean 
plates and dishes are one proof of the cook 
being a good servant. Clean the coppers 
with turpentine and fine brick-dust, rubbed 
on with flannel, and polish them with a 
leather and a little dry brick-dust. Clean the 
tins with soap and whitening, rubbed on 
with a flannel. Wipe them with a dry soft 
cloth, and polish with a clean leather -and 
powdered whitening, or use the excellent 
receipt in this volume. 

Never scrub the inside of a frying-pan. 
Rub it with wet silver sand put on a leather, 
and wash it out with hot water afterwards. 
Be very particular in washing vegetables. 
Lay cauliflowers and cabbage in salt and 
water, to get out insects, &c., &c. If a 
dinner-party is m prospect, ask for the bill 
of fare, and get ready all you can the day 
before, to save worry and scrambling on the' 
day fixed. 

Whisk Ihe white of eggs for soufflds, lemon 
and sponge-cakei, till they will bear the 
weight of an egg on them. This will assure 
the lightness of your cakes and souffles ; the 
latter ought to fly up like huga bubbles to

be really excellent. Take notice of all orders 
that require time in the preparation of the 
dinner, and hurry nothing. 

Wear large aprons and close dresses, so 
that you may avoid the risk of fire, and take 
especial care to bind back your hair so that 
there may be no chance of a loose one fall- 
ing into your preparations. Exquisite clean- 
liness tells even on the taste of the dishes 
preferred. 

Be careful of fuel. It is a great recom- 
mendation to a cook to use only the neces- 
sary amount of coals. If you cook by a 
grate, screw the sides nearer to each other 
when the fire has ceased to be required. 

The Parlourmaid. 

The parlourmaid takes the duties of an 
upper housemaid, and the waiting of a foot- 
man at meals, &c. 

She cleans plate, lays the table, waits at 
meals, answers the drawing-room bell, and 
the door bell, trims the lamps, and performs 
the other minor duties of a footman. At her 
leisure she works at her needle, and keeps 
the linen in repair. 

The Nurse and Nursemaid. 

The nurse's duties are very responsible 
ones. She has to watch over the health, 
safety, and comfort of the little ones in the 
nursery. She should be a healthy woman, 
very clean in her person, of a bright, cheer- 
ful, good temper. With the assistance of a 
nursemaid, if the family is large, she must, 
at about seven o'clock, take up and dress the 
children, washing carefully and tenderly 
their faces, necks and arms ; it is best, we 
think, to give them their bath at night. The 
water of the bath should be lukewarm (un- 
less a cold bath is especially ordered). They 
maybe -washed in cold water in the morning. 
Brush the hair carefully and tenderly so as 
rot to hurt the little heads. When the 
children are dressed, and have said their 
prayers, she should give them their break- 
fast, taking care that they are well and com- 
fortably fed. 

The nursemaid cleans the nursery, sets 
the breakfast, and helps the nurse to dress 
the children ; after breakfast the nursemaid 
makes the little bsds, and cleans the night 
nursery. The nurse, directly after breakfast, 
washes and dresses the baby, if there is one 
in the nursery. 

Then the two servants take the children 
for a walk until it is time for the little ones 
to lie down for their morning nap. All 
children out of the schoolroom should lie 
down for an hour at least, to ease the spine 



of the weight of the head ; they will grc.T 
stronger and straighter for it. While they 
lie down the nurse can work at her needle. 

After dinner the children walk again. 

The nurse and nursemaid make and mend 
all the children's clothes. The nurse should 
try to get pretty patterns whenever she sees 
them for her task, and should take a pride in 
the neatness of her charges' wardrobes. 

She should rule the nursery with a gentle 
but firm authority, making the children 
obedient and tnithful, and taking care that 
she sets them a good example in all things. 
Her influence for good or evil is I'cry ^^'/'^a/, 
and she should exercise great watchfulness, 
that no word may meet young ears in the 
nursery that is unfit for them to hear. 

Whenever the children are sent for to the 
drawing-room, the nurse should take off 
their pinafores, smooth their hair, and make 
them look nice. The head nurse generally 
takes her meals with the children. 

The Laundrymaid. 

The laundiymaid should collect all the 
linen requiring washing on Monday morn- 
ing, count it, and compare it with the list 
given to her. Then she must assort it, put- 
ting the sheets and body linen in one heai), 
the muslins and fine things in another, the 
cotton and woollen in a third. Ink spots, 
fruit stains, &c., should be removed. The 
heavy linen should be soaked in hot water 
all night. The washing begins next morn- 
ing at five or six o'clock. In most large 
households where a laundrymaid is kept, 
there are now to be found washing and 
wringing machines, as well as mangles. 
Where these are not found, the old- 
fashioned labour of soaping with yellow 
soap in hot water, and rubbing well, must 
be resorted to. 

The linen .should be well washed in two 
waters, and the water should be hot and 
plentiful. Then it should be boiled in the 
copper for about an hour and a half, taken 
out, rinsed in clean hot water, then in cold 
water tinged with the blue bag, then wrung 
thoroughly, and hung out early in the sun- 
shine and air to bleach and dry. 

Coloured muslins sliould be washed in 
cold water to keep the colour, rubbed with 
yellow soap gently, and hung to dry in a 
shady place to save the colour from fading. 
A little soda added to the water will save 
mauve and lilac from washing out. New 
flannel should be washed in cold water be- 
fore it is made up ; that will prevent it from 
shrinking in the wa.sh. Only lukewarm 
water should be used for them then, and 
yellow soap. It requires a good deal of

rinsing to get the soap out of flannel before 
drying. 

To Make Starch. — Mix the starch with 
cold water, using a wooden spoon. Make 
it quite smooth and free from lumps, then 
pour boiling water over it, stirring it all the 
time. When made, stir it round three times 
with a piece of wax candle, to prevent the 
iron from sticking. 

When the washing is ended, scrub and 
put away the tubs, &c. 

Thursday and Friday the laundrymaid 
irons and mangles. She should then air 
the clothes thoroughly, and fold them neatly 
before giving them to the housemaid or 
lady's-maid to sort. 

Great care should be taken not to let wet 
clothes touch iron or a brick floor, for fear 
of iron moulds. Also, the laundress should 
be careful not to tear fine muslin or lace. 

Handkerchiefs should be ironed wet, to 
stiffen and give them a gloss. 

The Duties of a Lady's-Kaid. 

A lady's-maid is required to be a nice-man- 
nered, respectable-looking young woman. 
She should be a tolerably good dressmaker, 
know how to make a cap or trim a bonnet, 
and she must be a good hairdresser. Her 
first morning duty will be to dress her lady, 
about which it is impossible to give direc- 
tions, as ladies differ very much in their 
toilette arrangements. The housemaid 
generally takes up the warm water for the 
lady's bath, but occasionally she prefers her 
own maid doing so. After dressing her 
lady, the maid must examine her wardrobe, 
shake or iron out tumbled dresses, put away 
everything left about the room. She then 
Sits dovi-n in the housekeeper's room to 
needlework, but must be ready to answer 
her lady's bell when it is rung, and to dress 
her for a walk, drive, or ride, having every- 
thing ready — boots, gloves, &c., in perfect 
order. 

She must have everything prepared also 
for the lady's toilette for dinner, and as soon 
as that is over, and her mistress has left the 
room, she should examine the walking dress, 
brush it if it is a tweed or linsey, shake and 
wipe it, and remove mud stains if it is a silk 
or any light material. Silk dresses should 
be wijjed with a soft piece of merino or very 
fine flannel. If anything wants mending 
it should be done at once. Everything 
should be carefully dusted and put away, 
either folded or hung in the wardrobe. 

She must have the bedroom ready for her 
lady at the usual hour for retiring for (he 
night. If it is winter she must have a 
liii^ht fire, before which she should hang 



the night dress, &c. Hot water should be 
in a can or kettle ready for use, and the 
brushes put out on the toilette table. Her 
duty is then to undress the lady, and re- 
main in attendance till she is dismissed. 
During the day, when not in actual attend- 
ance, she will have to mend, make, and 
probably to wash and iron lace and fine 
clothes, as handkerchiefs, collars, cuffs, &-c. 
Very little instruction can be given verbally 
on this point. However, a few hints as to 
how best to wash Honitonlace, &c., maybe 
of some service. 

To Wash Honiton Lace. — Fold the lace 
evenly together, and tack it lightly on a 
piece of flannel ; double the flannel over it. 
Squeeze it constantly (but do not rub it) in 
very hot soapsuds. When clean, let it dry, 
then open it, spread and pin it out on a 
cloth, and carefully pick up and raise all 
the threads. It should be pressed smooth, 
but not ironed. 

To Stiffen Fine Cambric Handkerchiefs. 
— Wash them rather by squeezing them in 
hot soap and water than by rubbing them ; 
blue them slightly, rinse them again in 
cold water, and iron them wet with a box- 
heater. 

Tumbled muslin or thin dresses should be 
pressed out with an iron. 

To Wash Brushes. — Brushes should be 
washed in cold soda and water, and not left 
to soak. Shake the water well out of the 
bristles, and dry in the open air if possible. 
Brush the comb and clean it with a piece of 
thread, but do not wash it. If it is greasy 
and you are compelled to wash it, dip it in 
cold soda and water. A receipt for an ex- 
cellent wash for the hair will be found at the 
end of the book ; also a tooth-powder and 
a valuable receipt for making Eau-de- 
Cologne. Skill in these matters is of great 
service to a maid. 

Once a week the lady's-maid will have to 
send the linen to the wash and receive it 
back. She should look over the clothes, 
and mend everything that requires a stitch 
before sending it, making two lists — one in 
the book for the laundress, one in a book to 
be kept at home, comparing the clothes 
with the list when they are returned clean, 
looking at the marks to see that they have 
not been changed at the wash, sewing on 
any buttons, and not permitting bad v»'ash- 
ing, but returning any ill-washed article to 
the laundress. 

Wax spots may be removed from silk or 
woollen dresses by placing a piece of blot- 
ting paper over them and holding a very hot 
iron in the air a little distance above the 
pai>er : tiie heat draws out ttie grease. As 
soon as seen through the paper, the latter 



Duties of tJte Housekeeper and Footman. 



353 



should be removed to a cleaner part, the 
iron held over the spot again till it is out. 

To Clean a Turned Silk. — Wash the 
breadths with spirits of wine, and press 
them with a hot iron the wrong side, or 
rather the worn side of the silk. Black 
silk is best washed with gin. Spirits of 
turpentine will remove paint spots if freshly 
done. The pile of velvet when crushed by 
sitting on it may be raised by holding the 
wrong side above the steam of hot water. 

A respectful manner is required from a 
lady's-maid. She is not to keep her seat 
while her mistress is speaking to her, unless 
desired, and she is to rise when the lady 
enters the room. 

She has breakfast and tea in the house- 
keeper's room, dines in the ser\-ants'-hall, 
but retires for her cheese, &c., with the 
housekeeper. A good deal of sitting up at 
night is sometimes required from a lady's- 
maid during the London season ; she must 
Strive to get what rest she can, and good- 
temperedly support any inevitable fatigue. 

A cheerful, kindly performance of her 
duties, deference, obedience, industry, and 
Strict honesty will secure for her a friend in 
her lady, and a happy home under all ordi- 
nary arcumstances. 

The Hcusekeeper. 

The housekeeper in modern families (ex- 
cept in those of the highest nobility) is gene- 
rally also the cook ; but she has a kitchen- 
maid under her, who is abotit the same as 
an ordinary plain cook. 

Her duties as housekeeper require early 
rising, both to get business over well, and 
as an example to the servants. She has her 
breakfast with the butler, lady's-maid, and 
valet, in her own private apartment. After 
breakfast she will make out on a slate her 
bill of fare for the days luncheon and 
dinner, to be submitted to her lady's ap- 
proval. After receiving her orders for the 
day, she will go over the house to see that 
the housemaids have done their duty well ; 
that the furniture is rubbed, carpets swept, 
&c., &c. Then she has to market, give 
orders to the tradesmen, &c., &c. After- 
wards her culinary preparations will engage 
her attention. 

She heads the dinner table in the servants' 
hall, but retires to her own room with the 
butler and lady's-maid and valet, for her 
after-dinner cheese, &c. She has her tea 
with the upper servants in the same manner. 

The still-room maid cleans the house- 
keeper's room, and waits on her. Where 
there is no still-room maid the scullery-maid 
or under housemaid generally has to do so. 



It is the housekeeper's duty to look over the 
house linen and see that it is kept in good 
repair, and that it returns right from the 
wash. She also directs all cleaning, annual 
or otherwise. Once a week she should sub- 
mit her books to her lady to ba inspected 
and paid. 

A housekeeper ought to be perfectly trust- 
worthy. She has much committed to her, 
and will be respected, and will prosper in 
exact proportion to her fulfilment of the im- 
portant duties devolving on her. 

She should show a tender, motherly care 
towards the younger female sei-vants, and 
endeavour as much as possible to rule them 
wisely and well. Many opportunities of 
doing good will be open to her. Her in- 
(iuence in a large household may be great. 
She should think for all, and endeavour to 
do good to all. Especially should she con- 
sider the interests of her employers, and en- 
deavour to spend for them as she would 
wish other persons to do for her. 

Directions given to lady housekeepers at 
the beginning of this volume will also be of 
use to the professional housekeeper in many 
ways, especially if she is young and inex- 
perienced. 

The Footman. 

The footman is required to make himself 
generally useful, though, of course, the 
number of men kept will diminish or in- 
crease his work. 

He has to clean knives and shoes, rub the 
furniture, clean the plate, trim the lamps, 
brush his master's clothes, carry up coals, 
attend to tires, open the door, go on errands 
or messages, and go out with the carriage. 
The footman must get over his dirty work 
before breakfast—?.^., he must clean boots, 
shoes, knives, and lamps, and rub tables, &c. ; 
then he must make himself fit to go in to pray- 
ers., and carry in the breakfast which he lays. 
He brushes his masters clothes, and carries 
them up with his boots and hot water to the 
gentleman's dressing-room. When there is 
no butler kept, he brings in the breakfast 
urn, and afterwards removes the breakfast 
things. The footman lays the luncheon 
cloth and dinner cloth, and waits table. 

To Lay the Table for Luncheon and 
Dinner. — He lays the cloth ; puts a water 
bottle (or caraffe) with a tumbler on it at 
each corner of the table, a salt-cellar and 
two tablespoons at each corner ; a small 
knife and two small silver forks and one 
dessertsppon for each person round the 
table, a barving knife and fork at the top 
and bottom of the table, and a tablespoon 
near every side-dish ; the cruet-stand in the

Duties of the Footman. 



centre of the table, the silver sugar dredger 
on one side of it (towards the foot of the 
table), near it two decanters of wine ; a 
tumbler and wineglass to each person. At 
luncheon the meat or chickens, tarts, bis- 
cuits, cake, &c. , are all put on the table at 
the same time, but if a hot pudding is 
served the footman brings it in afterwards 
when required. The footman should be 
ready to push in the chair on which a lady 
seats herself as she sits down. He carries 
round the luncheon plates once, and then 
goes to early dinner (unless there should be 
a luncheon party). He takes the luncheon 
away. He lays the dinner either k la Russe 
or in the English fashion. On the side- 
board before dinner he must arrange the 
plate, glass, &c., so that he may have every- 
thing ready to his hand. The dessert (unless 
it is a dinner k la Russe) must be put ready 
on the sideboard, and the wine decanted ; 
the butler \if there is one) will look to the 
plate and wine. On each dessert-plate he 
must put a doyley and fingerglass (some 
people. East Indians especially, like a bay- 
leaf put at the bottom of the water), and 
the silver knife and fork, or if the finger- 
glasses or wine coolers are left from dinner 
on the table, he puts the wineglasses on the 
plate. Then he must put the butler's tray 
ready. The tablecloth should be laid very 
evenly (slips are laid down each side for 
company). At each end of the table he 
should place a carving knife and fork and 
their rests ; the same before any side-dish 
requiring it (such as bacon or tongue), a 
tablespoon at each dish's destined place. A 
large knife, two large forks, and a dessert- 
spoon by each plate, the spoon for soup, the 
extra fork for fish, where fish knives and 
forks are not used. At each corner of the 
table he puts salt-cellars, with a tablespoon 
on each side, the bowls in opposite direc- 
tions ; places a water-bottle and glass at 
each corner ; a plate to each person with a 
nicely folded table-napkin on it, holding a 
dinner roll. If laying for a large party he puts 
a salt-cellar and a water bottle, and glass be- 
tween every two persons ; the lamp in the 
centre of the table, or the dpergne as re- 
quired. The footman receives the dishes at 
the dining-room door ; the butler puts the 
first dish upon the table ; the footman 
stands behind the lady. He carries round 
plates of soup, offering one to each person ; 
he must hand it en the left hand of the 



diner, and with his own left hand. Next he 
hands the soup, then the fish, next the 
entries or side-dishes, then the removes or 
chief joints, &c. Wine is offered directly 
after soup, and frequently during dinner ; 
sherry is used at the ordinary table. Sherry 
after soup and fish at a dinner party, then 
immediately afterwards Champagne or 
Hock, or any light wine. The footman 
must stand watching the table very atten- 
tively, so that he may change every plate as 
soon as required. On every clean plate 
handed thus, he lays a clean silver fork. 
The soup ladle is always removed and put 
into the basket for the used silver, before the 
tureen is taken away. The carving knife 
and fork are also removed separately. The 
second course is brought in ; the game is 
handed first; afterwards thesweets, changing 
the plates as required. He must be careful 
to learn from the cook which are the right 
sauces to hand with the different dishes. 

Cheese, butter, &c., are next served, and 
handed round. 

When dinner is over he removes the slips 
if it is a dinner party, or the cloth only if 
the family are alone. He brushes off the 
crumbs mto a small waiter ; puts the dessert 
and wine on the table, and to each person a 
dessert-plate (already prepared) and two 
wineglasses. The fruit is handed round ; 
then the footman makes up the fire and 
leaves the room. 

He then (where no btitler is kept) proceeds 
to the drawing-room and attends to the fire 
and lamps ; then, in the butler's pantry, he 
washes up the plate ready for cleaning the 
next day. After the ladies have left the 
dining-room he carries in coffee to them ; 
and some time after he takes it into the 
dining-room to the gentlemen. 

When the gentlemen go into the drawing- 
room, he carries in the tea. At the usual 
hour he brings the bedroom candles. These 
minor arrangements, however, differ in dif- 
ferent families. 

The footman brings in letters and notes ; 
he must always hand them on a waiter. 
He must answer bells readily, especially the 
door bell, and he should speak civilly to 
visitors. He shows them in, asks the narrie 
if he does not know it, and takes care fe 
announce them properly. 

The footman should endeavour by careful 
observation and pains to fit himself for the 
place of under-butler. 



Mode of Folding Table Napkins. 



355 



FLG.2. 




To Fold the Mitre. — The nnpkin must be 
folded in three, thus : — Fold one third over, 
turn it backwards, and thus make the three 
folds. Fold both ends to meet in the middle. 
Take the left-hand corner, a, and fold it 
across in a right angle. Take the opposite 
corner, b, on the left hand at the top, and 
fold it in the same manner ; you will thus 
form figure i. Turn over and fold in halves 
lengthwise ; open tlie points, and you will 
have figure 2. Bend the point, a, towards 
the right, and tuck it in the groove, c ; turn 
the point, b, backwards towards the right 
hand, and tuck it in as at a / you will then 
have figure 3 — The Mitre. 

The Water Lily. — Have a square napkin 
and fold it like a half handkerchief. Tlien 
take the two opposite points, and make 
them meet oa the centre one, which forms 



a square. Take the bottom comer, opposite 
the points, and roll it up as at figure 4. 
Turn the napkin over, and roll point a to 
about the centre. Take point b, and tuck it 
in the groove ; raise it, and you have figure 
5 — the Water Lily. Turn the corners over, 
and tuck them in at c and d. Turn back 
the second fold at the top — figure 6. 

Napkin. Folded for s/nall Tarts at the side 
and a Cake in the middle. — Have a per- 
fectly square napkin ; turn the corners over 
so that they meet at the centre. Turn the 
four corners back to the edge, and you will 
have figure 7 ; carefully turn the napkia 
without unfolding it ; turn it over from two 
opposit^^ides itito the centre at figure 8 ; 
turn it over again and make the other two 
ends meet in the middle; you have thea 
figure 9. — 



356 Duties of the Valet and the Butler. — Servants' Characters. 



The Valet. 

The valet's duty is to wait on his master. 

He sees that the gentleman's dressing- 
roonr- fire is lighted in the morning; arranges 
the clothes, which he has brushed, en a 
table or chair, and places the linen before 
the fire. Then he fills the bath, &c. Some- 
times the valet shaves his master ; he 
brushes his hair, and should be able to cut 
it every fortnight. He hands the garments 
required to the gentleman. 

The valet then receives his orders for the 
day, puts the dressing-room straight, brushes 
clothes, and cleans combs and brushes ; he 
takes messages, posts letters, and is at his 
master's »rders whenever required. 

The Butler. 

The butler is at the head of the men ser- 
vants ; he has care of the plate and wine. 

He sees that the breakfast-table is well 
laid by the footman ; and that he brings in 
the urn, &c. 

He looks to the laying of luncheon, and 
waits at it till the family are helped; he offers 
wine or ale, and then leaves the dining- 
room and goes to dinner. If desired, he 
waits when there is company ; but few per- 
sons like to have the servants waiting at 
luncheon. 

He gives out and arranges the silver for 
dinner, annoimces dinner, and stands re- 
spectfully at the door till the family go into 
the dining-room ; sets the first dish on the 
table ; then he takes his place behind bis 
master on the left hand, near the sideboard, 
after removing the cover and handing it to 
the footman. He waits at table with general 
supervision over the other servants. When 
the soup and fish are done with, he rings 
the bell for the removes, gives the dishes to 
the footman, receives. the removes and places 
them on the table. He removes the covers, 
and again stands near the s-deboard, unless 
he is required to assist in handing the en- 
tries, which he must do if there is only a 
second man to wait. 

l- He places the dessert also on the table and 
hands it roimd. If it is winter he takes care 
to have the fire made up ; then he leaves the 
room with the footman. 



He visits the drawing-room, sees that the 
upper-housemaid has set it to rights while 
the family were dressing, makes up the fire, 
sees to the lamps, &c. 

He brings in the tea. At bed-time he ap- 
pears with the candles. He secures the 
house, and sees that the fires and lights are 
out. 

Brewing, racking, and bottling malt liquors 
— fining down and bottling wine, are duties 
which belong to him. In families where no 
groom of the chambers is kept, he should 
look occasionally into the drawing-room to 
see that the blinds are down if the sun pours 
in, &'c. &c., and to pay any little attention to 
the comfort of the lady. 

The butler also, when only a footman is 
kept, answers the hall door with the latter, 
and announces visitors. He is also ready 
when the carriage drives round to assist the 
lady of the house into it, and he is at hand 
when she returns. 

The duties of a butler single-handed are 
of course heavy ; if an under-butier is kept 
they are lighter. 



SEEVAKTS' CHAEACTEES. 

A master or mistress is not bouvd to give 
a servant a character. If a character is given 
it must be a true one, but if not a good one, 
care should be exercised in the wording, 
particularly if it is a written one, because it 
may be actionable.* If any master or mis- 
tress give a false character of a servant in 
writing, knowing the same to be false, and the 
servant unfit for a situation from dishonesty, 
drunkenness, &c., they render themselves 
liable to a penalty of 20/. and io.f. costs. 

If any person personates a master or mis- 
tress, and gives the character of a servant, 
they are liable to be fined 20/. and io.r. costs. 

A servant altering a written character or 
bringing a false one — from a person repre- 
senting the master or mistress — is liable to 
forfeit 20/. and ioj. costs upon being con- 
victed of such offence. 

• If a bad character is given thrcmgh malice 
the person givins it becomes actionable, but not 
otherwise.

Selected and Arranged by Charles Knight. 
A Companion Volume to the " Ha If- Hours with the Best Authors."
