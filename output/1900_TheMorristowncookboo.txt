torn of the pot, then a layer of the pieces of fish 
next, season well with salt, black and especial- 
ly red pepper and ground cloves ; then some of 
the potatoes ; then raw onions and pork ; then 
some of the soaked biscuit. Repeat this process 
until all your material is used up. Cover all 
these with cold water, boil very slowly until the 
potatoes are thoroughly cooked ; then add a 
bottle of claret wine ; (put in plenty of wine as 
the gravy is delicious). Let it come to a boil

afraid of your salt, pepper and cloves, for the 
higher seasoned the better and more palatable.

Crullers 

2 cups of granulated sugar; i cup of butter; 
i cup of sweet milk; 4 eggs beaten light;- 1 
small nutmeg; 2 teaspoonf uls of cream of tartar; 
1 teaspoonful of soda (even) ; first mix butter 
to a cream, then add sugar, mixing thoroughly; 
slowly add the milk in which the soda has been 
dissolved; then add eggs; 1 teacup of flour with 
cream of tartar mixed through it. Add nutmeg, 
add flour enough to make a very soft dough. 
These should be rolled out, half an inch thick, 
cut round and take out centre. This rule will 
take three pounds of lard for boiling. Please 
remember that there is as. much secret in boil- 
ing crullers as in having a good receipt. The 
lard must be very hot; drop the crullers in care- 
• fully, and turn immediately, thus preventing 
the fat from soaking in the dough. When tak- 
ing out crullers place them on a plate with a 
piece of brown paper. When cool sift powdered 
sugar over them on each side. These are de- 
licious if the receipt is carried out.
