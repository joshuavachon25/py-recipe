Foreword! 



The good ladies who compiled this book, perhaps doubt- 
ing my literary taste, did not ask me to write it. They have 
honored me all the more, however, and tacitly credited me 
with another kind of taste by asking me to pen this fore- 
word. 

It has been my privilege to eat a great deal of Methodist 
cooking in my time. Unhesitatingly, I give it a high mark. 
With the aid of this volume, it becomes possible for any 
family to enjoy the best of eating. Dr. Frost's doughnut 
recipe reads amazingly good. Even the holes in those 
doughnuts possess nutritive value. Bishop Quayle's method 
of woods-broiling a beefsteak has its appeal to the vege- 
tarian also. 

Eating is one of the oldest habits of the human race. J 
believe it antedates clothing. Eating may bring us either 
happiness or unhappiness, depending not so much upon 
what we eat as how it is prepared. Professor Scott's recipe 
for preparing apples, however, has a pre-adamic tinge to it. 

A good cook is a genius. A good recipe is an inspiration. 
The knowledge of how to follow a recipe is pure talent. 
The willingness to give one's knowledge of good cookery 
to be perpetuated in such a book as this for the benefit of 
humanity is one of the highest types of human kindness. 

This is a book you will enjoy reading, in the hammock 
in summer or before the fire during the long winter even- 
ings. One can devour the contents of this book, without 
caring much whether the hero finally marries the heroine 
or not. This book is a library in itself. In it are potato 
poems, raspberry romances, hot bread history, and a world 
of jams, jellies, cakes, pies and other joys amid which to 
travel. It truly is that splendid type of book — one we may 
read, mark and inwardly digest.

ROMAN MEAT PUDDING. 

This rule calls for cold veal, chicken, lamb or beef. To 
1 pt. of meat finely minced, add 1 cup of good stock, well- 
seasoned, 1 egg, some lemon juice or tomato sauce, a few 
bread crumbs and chopped parsley. Line a mould with mac- 
aroni previously boiled until tender. Fill with the meat mix- 
ture and steam for Yz hour. Turn out on chop dish and 
serve surrounded with white sauce. This is very nice when 
made with chicken and served with mushroom sauce, 

Mrs. B. F. Traxler. 

EVANSTON CHOP SUEY. 

Cut 1^ lbs. round steak in finger lengths, add 2 onions 
and stew very slowly 2 hours. Then add a bunch of celery 
cut in dice, pepper and salt. Stew 20 minutes, thicken the 
gravy and serve in a ring of plain rice. 

Mrs. T. F. Holgate. 

MEAT SOUFFLfi. 

Make 1 cup cream sauce, season with chopped parsley 
and onion juice. Stir 1 cup of chopped meat (chicken, 
fresh tongue, veal or lamb) into the sauce. When hot, add 
the beaten yolks of two eggs ; cook one minute and set 
away to cool. When cool stir in the whites, beaten stiff.

spoon flour, 1 teaspoon of chopped onion, and celery or 
parsley, or both. Gradually add milk and stir over the 
fire into a drawn butter sauce. Have cooked meat of any 
kind, but chicken, veal or pork tenderloin are best. Boiled

adding canned peas and mushrooms. 

Mrs. C. E. Pope. 

HAM CROQUETTES.

one lb. pork, one lb. calf's liver. Boil the meat till 
it loosens from the bone, lift it from broth or liquor, of 
which there should be about three pints, and put where 
it will become very cold. Strain the broth and when it 
jellies, skim ofif all fat. Cut the boned meat across the 
grain, into small pieces and shave the liver fine. Heat the

divided, and a finely minced onion, with vinegar to taste, be 
put into one portion. 

Mrs. Bentley Masslich. 

FRIED RABBIT. 

Select young rabbits, cut in pieces, rejecting ribs on 
which there is very little meat. Boil in water to which is 
added a large onion and salt. The onion removes a charac- 
teristic rank taste, and that, with the broth, should be 
thrown out. When the meat is tender fry in butter or lard, 
and make a flour gravy with a tablespoon of flour rubbed 
into the butter, hot water added, and stirred over the fire 
until it is a thickened gravy. 

Mrs. C. E. Pope.

DEVONSHIRE CLOTTED CREAM. 

Pour 4 or 5 quarts of fresh, or good sweet unseparated 
milk into a wide topped milk pan or earthen crock. Let it 
stand until the cream is well risen (about 12 hours in the 
icebox.) Then without disturbing the contents of the pan, 
place over a kettle of boiling water, steam gently, without 
a cover until cream starts to crinkle. Remove from fire 
and let stand until very cold, then skim. This makes a 
delicious dish whether used as cream, as is usual, or spread 
thickly over bread in place of butter for four o'clock tea.

before beginning the dressing. Separate the eggs. Mix 
the dry ingredients in the bowl, add yolks of eggs, mix 
well, then add the oil, a drop at a time in the beginning. 
Stir constantly, and as the mixture thickens, thin it with 
the lemon juice and vinegar used alternately. Then add 
more oil until all is used. Lastly add the whites of the 
eggs beaten dry. If a white dressing is desired, use all 
lemon juice, stirring very thoroughly. After half the oil 
has been used it may be added in larger quantities. If the 
mixture should curdle, it is because the oil has been added 
too rapidly. This may be remedied by taking another egg 
yolk and adding the curdled mixture to it slowly.

All of the Country's 
Best Cooks— 

Mrs. Mary J. Lincoln, Mrs. Siarah Tyson Rorer, Mrs. 
Helen Armstrong, Marion Harland, Lida Ames Willis, 
and a dozen others of national reputation — recommend 
Cottolene in preference to lard or any other medium 
for frying and shortening. 

Isn't the testimony of such experts worth something 
to you? 

COTTOLENE 

means Food Purity. The woman who fries or shortens 
her family's food with lard is doing so because she is 
unaware of the ill effects which may come. Lard-cooked 
food never has been, and never can be, as healthful as 
food cooked with Cottolene. Here's why? 

Lard is made from hog fat, and is bound to be more 
or less indigestible. 

On the other hand Cottolene comes from the cotton 
fields of the Sunny South, and is made from the choic- 
est refined cotton oil, which physicians today recom- 
mend as being fully as healthful as olive oil. 

Cottolene is guaranteed 
— Your grocer is hereby 
authorized to refund your 
money in case you are not 
pleased, after having giv- 
en Cottolene a fair test. 

Never Sold in Bulk — 
Cottolene is packed in 
pails with an air-tight top 
to keep it clean, fresh and 
wholesome, and prevent it 
from catching dust and 
absorbing disagreeable 
odors such as fish, oil, etc. 

Order a pail from your 
grocer today.

SALT RISING BREAD. 

Many think that salt-rising bread is a lost art or too slow 
a process, with too much uncertainty as to results, for the 
modern housewife to undertake. By nine o'clock (if you 
can rise at six) you can have three loaves of sweet delicious 
bread baked which will be the envy of all your friends, if 
you will follow these directions. Pour boiling sweet milk 
on a heaping tablespoon of corn-meal and stir to a smooth 
paste. Set this, snugly covered, in a real warm place over 
night. The next morning this should be swelled up light. 
Heat half a coffee cup of sweet milk and cool to a warm 
temperature (not scalding) with a coffee cup of water. 
Into this stir a pinch of salt, a pinch of soda, a level table- 
spoon of sugar, the light meal and flour for a smooth 
batter. Set this in warm water, covered, till it foams up 
twice as light as first quantity. Next, in a deep pan or 
bowl, put a coffee cup of sweet milk, a pint of warm water, 
the light sponge and flour to make a smooth stiff batter. 
Sift over this an inch of flour. Set container in warm 
water all snugly covered, and when the sponge breaks 
through all over and at the edges, sift a pile of flour on 
the moulding board and pour out on it the light sponge, 
catching it up and kneading it into a soft mass. Make into 
three loaves and put into greased pans allowing about an 
inch for rising. Grease top of loaves with butter. When 
level with the pan sides, bake in a quick oven forty min- 
utes and cool in cold or cool air. This will be the most de- 
licious bread you ever tasted. 

Mrs. C. E. Haile.

to a stiff dough, set to rise until twice the original size,

118 PICKLES AND PRESERVES 

DUNDEE MARMALADE. 

Wash thoroughly 12 oranges and 6 lemons.. With a 
sharp knife cut each crosswise in the thinnest flakes pos- 
sible. (Do not use end pieces.) Pick out the seeds, put 
them in a bowl and cover with a pint of warm water. Pour 
5 quarts of cold water over the sliced fruit and let every- 
thing soak for thirty-six hours. Then put the sliced fruit 
and water into a preserving kettle, also the water which 
has been drained off the seeds, and allow all to simmer 
for two hours. Now add 10 lbs. of sugar, which has been 
warmed in the oven, and boil until the preserve jellies, 
which ought to be in an hour or so. Pour the marmalade 
into jelly glasses and seal. This marmalade, if properly 
made, will be like an amber jelly. 

Mrs. J. McCallum. 

ORANGE MARMALADE. 

Slice very thin, rind and all, twelve good flavored, medi- 
um sized navel oranges and four lemons. Cover with four 
quarts water and let stand for 30 hours. At the end of 
that time boil for two hours; then add 8 lbs. sugar. Boil 
an hour longer and put in glasses. This is delicious and 
has no bitter taste. 

Mrs. J. E. Lukey. 

ORANGE MARMALADE. 

One dozen good sized oranges, 3 lemons, pulp and juice 
of 1 grape fruit, 8 lbs. sugar. 9 teacups water. Shave oranges 
and lemons as thin as possible, add grape fruit and water, 
leave over night in enameled kettle. Boil 2 hours or until 
the rind is very soft. (It hardens a little after sugar is 
added.) Add sugar and boil 1 hour, turn into glasses, leave 
uncovered until next day. 

Mrs. Fulcher. 

ORANGE MARMALADE. 

Four oranges, 2 lemons cut in thin slices. To 1 pint of

AMBER MARMALADE. 

Shave 1 orange, 1 lemon and 1 grapefruit very thin re-

to it three times the quantity of water. Let stand over 
night in an earthen dish and next morning boil for ten 
minutes only. Stand another night and second morning 
add pint for pint of sugar and boil steadily till it jellies. 
This rule is supposed to make 12 glasses. The product 
should have a limpid appearance, the strips of fruit being 
well defined in a clear pale jelly. To this end stir as little 
as possible during required cooking.

FRENCH DRESSING. 

The life of French dressing is the seasoning. Too often 
it is merely a tame combination of oil and vinegar. My 
friend emphasized a "clove of garlic." If one clove is 
good, a dozen must be better. Crush these in a bowl, add 
plenty of salt, paprika and Worcestershire sauce, and beat 
with the air of a connoisseur. Good for all green salads, 
especially at business luncheon. If in doubt about the 
flavor, on returning to the office ask your secretary if she 
detects any delicate odor, and if she suggests that you do 
not call on your clients for a day or two, you may know 
the seasoning was all right.

HOW TO BROIL A STEAK. 

(Recommended by Mr. William A. Dyche.) 
When you are so lucky as to get a beefsteak, don't spoil 
it in the cooking. If you have much else to see to besides 
the steak, you had better have something else for dinner, 
for it is a sin to put a nice steak on the coals, and leave 
it to squirm and warp and dry up until it is as tough as 
shoe leather. But if you have a conscience void of offence 
with all men, and are able to concentrate your energies upon 
the business, put your steak upon the fire. Now you must 
know that the outside of a broiled piece of meat must be 
crisp and (turn it) the inside juicy, to make it the most 
palatable and (turn it) nourishing. If you allow it to rest 
long with one side to the fire (turn it) the juice and flavor 
are lost. The great art (turn it) is to expose the meat at 
the start for a moment to such an intense heat, that (turn 
it) the fiber may be seared in such a manner as to seal, as 
it were, the moisture (turn it). Steak can be cooked in 
this way until it will not look bloody when cut, and (turn 
it) will satisfy fully those who like it well done. Butter 
is worse than wasted, but of course (turn it) you'll have 
it on the table for such as wish to disguise the taste of beef 
(turn it). It may not be impertinent to suggest (turn it) 
that as the steak is just done, the potatoes also just done, 
the family may gather round the table so as to receive the 
steak upon their hot plates. There will be time for grace 
before eating, and you will be thankful after, whether it 
is customary or not in your family to say so.

HOW TO SCRAMBLE EGGS. 

There are people who advocate putting the egg on a 
slippery spot and forcing it to scramble the best it may. 
But this is cruel to the egg and infelicitous in results. 

Properly scrambling eggs is an accomplishment in itself. 
Eggs should not be scrambled haphazardly. This thing of 
grabbing an egg, hurling it into a frying pan and disar- 
ranging its interior economy with a hat pin or a poker or 
a stove lid lifter may be all very well for the person who 
is in haste, but people who are in haste should not eat eggs. 

Select your eggs with care. Choose eggs that have bru- 
nette shells. Do not open them with a selection by the 



FAVORITES OF OUR FAVORITES 139 

glee club. Take a knife and kindly but firmly strike the 
Ggg on its equator. This does not fracture the shell com- 
minutedly, so to speak, and allow the inmost thoughts of 
the egg to flow over your fingers and meditate upon the 
floor. Open the egg as you would an oyster, and gently 
drop the contents into a bowl. Now have your frying pan 
ready. Have it hot. Into it gracefully toss a piece of but- 
ter the size of your gas bill for one day. When the butter 
has melted, dust some pepper and salt into the eggs in the 
bowl and pour them into the frying pan ; then at once begin 
agitating the eggs with a long-handled spoon. To do this, 
you will hold the egg bowl in one hand, the handle of the 
frying pan in the other, the long spoon in the other, and 
with the other put the pepper and salt boxes back on the 
kitchen table. Continue stirring the eggs until they are 
done just right, then turn them out of the frying pan into 
a plate and say, "There !" Eggs scrambled in this way are 
thankful; otherwise they are justly resentful.

BAKED APPLES.

BROOK TROUT A LA NATURE. 

Being noted for going away and staying until my friends 
wonder — and as man's greatest enjoyment is in eating what 
he likes best when served under congenial conditions and 
surroundings — my favorite recipe is fried brook trout. 
First catch the speckled beauties if you can. If they are 
easily attracted by one's flies, then be choice as to size 
and condition, if wary, take what you can get. As soon 
after they are out of the water as would be humane, re- 
move the parts you do not care to consume, and otherwise 
prepare for cooking. Then take the spider and in it place 



FAVORITES OF OUR FAVORITES 143 

a number of strips of "bacon what is bacon" and remove 
when nice and crisp. In order to get bacon in this crisp 
condition it is necessary to start a fire with the ever handy 
birch bark and dry wood. This is generally easily done, 
way up in nature's playground, in the beautiful Lauren- 
tides of the Province of Quebec. After the bacon is crisp, 
remove it and in the bacon grease in the spider, place 
the trout, fry and turn and turn and fry, until thoroughly 
done. Then from the larder select such other delicacies 
as will grace a meal for a king, and go at it with both 
hands, one is not enough for the delicate appetite which 
air, exercise and surroundings give to the man turned 
Indian.

RECIPE, PATENTED.

By Bishop William A. Quayle.

for fuel. Take time. Have no haste. Loaf, and invite 
your soul while the fire gets agoing. Have no skillet. A 
skillet will destroy the cooking. Have no dishes, they will 
destroy the eating. Be calm. No neurotic can do the busi- 
ness. It requires great calmness and poise in a transaction 
with beefsteak in the woods. Cook on a stick, taking plen- 
ty of time. Drop the steak in the ashes a few times — how 
many times depends on the taste of the COOKEE. When 
cooked, eat with vast deliberation, using fingers only, as 
forks are a disparagement. When eaten, stop. Say grace

liquor then skim and drain off all the liquor and add to the

A BACHELOR BREAKFAST. 

Blessed with a good appetite, on which waits a good di- 
gestion, having cultivated a somewhat discriminating taster 
and not having had an income that quite keeps the pace, why 
should I try to decide what my favorite recipe is? Canai«e to 
cheese, I enjoy viands to the full, if they be simple, tooth- 
some, and wholesome, for "the chief pleasure (in eating) 
does not consist in costly seasoning or exquisite flavor, but 
in yourself." 

How foolish then to attempt the selection of a "best" 
among so many "good." Let me rather tell you of one 
breakfast prepared and eaten alone, than which none ever 
tasted better.

Tired nature finally objected and directed me to put into 
practice some of my kitchen theories, and this is the break- 
fast. 

The percolator having been loaded with a generous charge 
of freshly grown coffee and the pump started; the peaches 
were then cut and sugared, ready for the cream, and the 
kitchen table spread, to be close by the fire, not overlooking 
a goodly supply of butter and rolls. Three or four lumps of 
sweet beef fat were well tried out in the hot frying pan, 
then a good sized beef tenderloin steak with a sprinkle of 
salt, added, and when half done a few half inch cuts of a 
beefsteak tomato. The pan and its contents were left to the 
tender mercies of the fire, while the peaches were eaten and 
the coffee poured, then I went up against the steaming fat 
steak and tomatoes, each of which had drawn richness of 
flavor from the other, as it can only be done in the despised 
skillet. Oh me ! Oh my ! !

DIVINITY CANDY. 

Two cups granulated sugar, J/^ cup water, ^ cup Karo 
corn syrup. Boil until it strings. Pour this over the beat-

Mary Harris. 

ORANGE STICKS. 

Take 3 thick skinned oranges, and remove the peel in 
sections. Cut into narrow strips with scissors or sharp 
knife. Cover with cold water, bring to boiling point, and 
cook slowly until tender. Make syrup of 1 cup sugar and 
Yz cup water. Boil until it hairs. Drain peel from water 
and add to syrup. Boil for 3 minutes, drain, and roll in 
granulated sugar. 

Eleanor Holgate. 

TO GLACE FRUITS. 

The fruit must be perfectly dry. If oranges, separate 
each section carefully without breaking the inner skin. 
Stand them in a warm place to dry. Put two cups of gran- 
ulated sugar in a granite saucepan, moisten it with Yz cup 
of water, and place over the fire to boil. Do not stir after 
the sugar is dissolved. Boil gently about 15 minutes, or 
until it will break quickly when dropped in cold water. If 
brittle without being sticky, it is just right. The syrup 
must never be stirred. Now take it quickly from the fire, 
add 1 tablespoon of lemon juice and stand in a basin of 
boiling water to keep the syrup from candying. Take fruit 
on the point of a large skewer, or with the sugar tongs; 
dip into the syrup and stand in a warm, dry place to dry. 
English walnuts and almonds are glaced the same way. Do 
not attempt to glace fruits or nuts on a damp day, or when 
there is any steam in the kitchen from other cooking. 

Irene Sargent.

OWN BLEND 

Coffee 

Here is a coffee, the most 
exquisite in taste, with no 
disagreeable after effects, guar- 
anteed always to be the same 
— at a moderate price. 
Mrs. Rorer, one of the world's 
best known cooking author- 
ities, spent months in South 
America selecting the planta- 
tions on which the berries for 
this coffee are grown — the 
blend is the result of her long experimenting — 
She considers it the finest combination possible — 
The roasting of the coffee is carried on in a mod- 
ern factory, under Mrs. Rorer's own direction. 
It is the coffee Mrs. Rorer wanted 
fof her own family and friends 

— it was at the wish of these enthusiasts that 
she arranged to sell this coffee nationally. 

Try a package today — it is sealed in a wonder- 
ful container with three paraffine layers — not 
one whit of that delicious aroma of the natural 
ber is lost. 

And send to us for Mrs. Rorer's booklet of 
recipes. We'll send it free — please mention 
whether or not your grocer carries Mrs. Rorer's 
coffee when you write.

BY MRS. ALFRED L. LINDSEY. 



Foreword! 

The good ladies who compiled this book, perhaps doubt- 
ing my literary taste, did not ask me to write it. They have 
honored me all the more, however, and tacitly credited me 
with another kind of taste by asking me to pen this fore- 
word. 

It has been my privilege to eat a great deal of Methodist 
cooking in my time. Unhesitatingly, I give it a high mark. 
With the aid of this volume, it becomes possible for any 
family to enjoy the best of eating. Dr. Frost's doughnut 
recipe reads amazingly good. Even the holes in those 
doughnuts possess nutritive value. Bishop Quayle's method 
of woods-broiling a beefsteak has its appeal to the vege- 
tarian also. 

Eating is one of the oldest habits of the human race. I 
believe it antedates clothing. Eating may bring us either 
happiness or unhappiness, depending not so much upon 
what we eat as how it is prepared. Professor Scott's recipe 
for preparing apples, however, has a pre-adamic tinge to it. 

A good cook is a genius. A good recipe is an inspiration. 
The knowledge of how to follow a recipe is pure talent. 
The willingness to give one's knowledge of good cookery 
to be perpetuated in such a book as this for the benefit of 
humanity is one of the highest types of human kindness. 

This is a book you will enjoy reading, in the hammock 
in summer or before the fire during the long winter even- 
ings. One can devour the contents of this book, without 
caring much whether the hero finally marries the heroine 
or not. This book is a library in itself. In it are potato 
poems, raspberry romances, hot bread history, and a world 
of jams, jellies, cakes, pies and other joys amid which to 
travel. It truly is that splendid type of book one we may 
read, mark and inwardly digest.

18 FISH AND OYSTERS 

BAKED FISH WITHOUT DRESSING. 

Rub the clean fish with plenty of salt and let it lie for an 
hour; then wipe off the salt and rub well with lemon juice, 
leaving it another half hour where it will keep very cold. 
Now split down the back enough so that it can be opened 
and spread out flat ; dredge with flour and put in a shallow 
tin in the oven, pouring over it about 3 tablespoons of fresh 
milk and dotting with bits of butter, or thin slices of fat 
salt pork. Bake from 20 minutes to one half hour. Serve 
in a hot platter with a few spoons of hot cream and a little 
butter poured over it, or use a Hollandaise sauce poured 
around it. This manner is equally good for halibut or 
fresh cod steaks.

before beginning the dressing. Separate the eggs. Mix 
the dry ingredients in the bowl, add yolks of eggs, mix

Stir constantly, and as the mixture thickens, thin it with 
the lemon juice and vinegar used alternately. Then add 
more oil until all is used. Lastly add the whites of the 
eggs beaten dry. If a white dressing is desired, use all 
lemon juice, stirring very thoroughly. After half the oil 
has been used it may be added in larger quantities. If the

too rapidly. This may be remedied by taking another egg 
yolk and adding the curdled mixture to it slowly.

All of the Country's 
Best Cooks 

Mrs. Mary J. Lincoln, Mrs. Sarah Tyson Rorer, Mrs. 
Helen Armstrong, Marion Harland, Lida Ames Willis, 
and a dozen others of national reputation recommend 
Cottolene in pre ference to lard or any other medium 
for frying and shortening. 

Isn't the testimony of such experts worth something 



to you? 



COTTOLENE 



means Food Purity. The woman who fries or shortens 
her family's food with lard is doing so because she is 
unaware of the ill effects which may come. Lard-cooked 
food never has been, and never can be, as healthful as 
food cooked with Cottolene. Here's why? 

Lard is made from hog fat, and is bound to be more 
or less indigestible. 

On the other hand Cottolene comes from the cotton 
fields of the Sunny South, and is made from the choic- 
est refined cotton oil, which physicians today recom- 
mend as being fully as healthful as olive oil. 

Cottolene is guaranteed 
Your grocer is hereby 
authorized to refund your 
money in case you are not 
pleased, after having giv- 
en Cottolene a fair test. 

Never Sold in Bulk 
Cottolene is packed in 
pails with an air-tight top 
to keep it clean, fresh and 
wholesome, and prevent it 
from catching dust and 
absorbing disagreeable 
odors such as fish, oil, etc. 

Order a pail from your 
grocer today.

two crusts. A large pinch of Tartaric Acid, used instead 
of the vinegar, brings out the flavor, supplies the necessary 
"tart," and gives to the berry the hue of the cherry.

SALT RISING BREAD. 

Many think that salt-rising bread is a lost art or too slow 
a process, with too much uncertainty as to results, for the 
modern housewife to undertake. By nine o'clock (if you 
can rise at six) you can have three loaves of sweet delicious 
bread baked which will be the envy of all your friends, if 
you will follow these directions. Pour boiling sweet milk 
on a heaping tablespoon of corn-meal and stir to a smooth 
paste. Set this, snugly covered, in a real warm place over 
night. The next morning this should be swelled up light. 
Heat half a coffee cup of sweet milk and cool to a warm 
temperature (not scalding) with a coffee cup of water. 
Into this stir a pinch of salt, a pinch of soda, a level table- 
spoon of sugar, the light meal and flour for a smooth 
batter. Set this in warm water, covered, till it foams up 
twice as light as first quantity. Next, in a deep pan or 
bowl, put a coffee cup of sweet milk, a pint of warm water, 
the light sponge and flour to make a smooth stiff batter. 
Sift over this an inch of flour. Set container in warm 
water all snugly covered, and when the sponge breaks 
through all over and at the edges, sift a pile of flour on 
the moulding board and pour out on it the light sponge, 
catching it up and kneading it into a soft mass. Make into 
three loaves and put into greased pans allowing about an 
inch for rising. Grease top of loaves with butter. When 
level with the pan sides, bake in a quick oven forty min- 
utes and cool in cold or cool air. This will be the most de- 
licious bread you ever tasted. 

Mrs. C. E. Haile.

DUNDEE MARMAL'ADE. 

Wash thoroughly 12 oranges and 6 lemons.. With a 
sharp knife cut each crosswise in the thinnest flakes pos- 
sible. (Do not use end pieces.) Pick out the seeds, put 
them in a bowl and cover with a pint of warm water. Pour 
5 quarts of cold water over the sliced fruit and let every- 
thing soak for thirty-six hours. Then put the sliced fruit 
and water into a preserving kettle, also the water which 
has been drained off the seeds, and allow all to simmer 
for two hours. Now add 10 Ibs. of sugar, which has been 
warmed in the oven, and boil until the preserve jellies, 
which ought to be in an hour or so. Pour the marmalade 
into jelly glasses and seal. This marmalade, if properly 
made, will be like an amber jelly. 

Mrs. J. McCallum. 

ORANGE MARMALADE. 

Slice very thin, rind and all, twelve good flavored, medi- 
um sized navel oranges and four lemons. Cover with four 
quarts water and let stand for 30 hours. At the end of 
that time boil for two hours ; then add 8 Ibs. sugar. Boil 
an hour longer and put in glasses. This is delicious and 
has no bitter taste. 

Mrs. J. E. Lukey. 

ORANGE MARMALADE. 

One dozen good sized oranges, 3 lemons, pulp and juice

the rind is very soft. (It hardens a little after sugar is 
added.) Add sugar and boil 1 hour, turn into glasses, leave 
uncovered until next day.

AMBER MARMALADE. 

Shave 1 orange, 1 lemon and 1 grapefruit very thin re-

to it three times the quantity of water. Let stand over 
night in an earthen dish and next morning boil for ten 
minutes only. Stand another night and second morning 
add pint for pint of sugar and boil steadily till it jellies. 
This rule is supposed to make 12 glasses. The product 
should have a limpid appearance, the strips of fruit being 
well defined in a clear pale jelly. To this end stir as little 
as possible during required cooking. 

Mrs. S. A. Kean. 

RHUBARB AND ORANGE MARMALADE.

FRENCH DRESSING. 

The life of French dressing is the seasoning. Too often 
it is merely a tame combination of oil and vinegar. My 
friend emphasized a "clove of garlic." If one clove is 
good, a dozen must be better. Crush these in a bowl, add 
plenty of salt, paprika and Worcestershire sauce, and beat 
with the air of a connoisseur. Good for all green salads, 
especially at business luncheon. If in doubt about the 
flavor, on returning to the office ask your secretary if she 
detects any delicate odor, and if she suggests that you do 
not call on your clients for a day or two, you may know 
the seasoning was all right.

HOW TO BROIL A STEAK. 

(Recommended by Mr. William A. Dyche.) 
When you are so lucky as to get a beefsteak, don't spoil 
it in the cooking. If you have much else to see to besides 
the steak, you had better have something else for dinner, 
for it is a sin to put a nice steak on the coals, and leave 
it to squirm and warp and dry up until it is as tough as 
shoe leather. But if you have a conscience void of offence 
with all men, and are able to concentrate your energies upon 
the business, put your steak upon the fire. Now you must 
know that the outside of a broiled piece of meat must be 
crisp and (turn it) the inside juicy, to make it the most 
palatable and (turn it) nourishing. If you allow it to rest 
long with one side to the fire (turn it) the juice and flavor 
are lost. The great art (turn it) is to expose the meat at 
the start for a moment to such an intense heat, that (turn 
it) the fiber may be seared in such a manner as to seal, as 
it were, the moisture (turn it). Steak can be cooked in 
this way until it will not look bloody when cut, and (turn 
it) will satisfy fully those who like it well done. Butter 
is worse than wasted, but of course (turn it) you'll have 
it on the table for such as wish to disguise the taste of beef 
(turn it). It may not be impertinent to suggest (turn it) 
that as the steak is just done, the potatoes also just done, 
the family may gather round the table so as to receive the 
steak upon their hot plates. There will be time for grace 
before eating, and you will be thankful after, whether it 
is customary or not in your family to say so.

HOW TO SCRAMBLE EGGS. 

There are people who advocate putting the egg on a 
slippery spot and forcing it to scramble the best it may. 
But this is cruel to the egg and infelicitous in results. 

Properly scrambling eggs is an accomplishment in itself. 
Eggs should not be scrambled haphazardly. This thing of 
grabbing an egg, hurling it into a frying pan and disar- 
ranging its interior economy with a hat pin or a poker or 
a stove lid lifter may be all very well for the person who 
is in haste, but people who are in haste should not eat eggs. 

Select your eggs with care. Choose eggs that have bru- 
nette shells. Do not open them with a selection by the 



FAVORITES OF OUR FAVORITES 139 

glee club. Take a knife and kindly but firmly strike the 
egg on its equator. This does not fracture the shell com- 
minutedly, so to speak, and allow the inmost thoughts of 
the egg to flow over your fingers and meditate upon the 
floor. Open the egg as you would an oyster, and gently 
drop the contents into a bowl. Now have your frying pan 
ready. Have it hot. Into it gracefully toss a piece of but- 
ter the size of your gas bill for one day. When the butter 
has melted, dust some pepper and salt into the eggs in the 
bowl and pour them into the frying pan ; then at once begin 
agitating the eggs with a long-handled spoon. To do this, 
you will hold the egg bowl in one hand, the handle of the 
frying pan in the other, the long spoon in the other, and 
with the other put the pepper and salt boxes back on the 
kitchen table. Continue stirring the eggs until they are 
done just right, then turn them out of the frying pan into 
a plate and say, "There!" Eggs scrambled in this way are 
thankful; otherwise they are justly resentful.

BROOK TROUT A LA NATURE. 

Being noted for going away and staying until my friends 
wonder and as man's greatest enjoyment is in eating what 
he likes best when served under congenial conditions and 
surroundings my favorite recipe is fried brook trout. 
First catch the speckled beauties if you can. If they are 
easily attracted by one's flies, then be choice as to size 
and condition, if wary, take what you can get. As soon 
after they are out of the water as would be humane, re- 
move the parts you do not care to consume, and otherwise 
prepare for cooking. Then take the spider and in it place 



FAVORITES OF OUR FAVORITES 143 

a number of strips of "bacon what is bacon" and remove 
when nice and crisp. In order to get bacon in this crisp 
condition it is necessary to start a fire with the ever handy 
birch bark and dry wood. This is generally easily done, 
way up in nature's playground, in the beautiful Lauren- 
tides of the Province of Quebec. After the bacon is crisp, 
remove it and in the bacon grease in the spider, place 
the trout, fry and turn and turn and fry, until thoroughly 
done. Then from the larder select such other delicacies 
as will grace a meal for a king, and go at it with both 
hands, one is not enough for the delicate appetite which 
air, exercise and surroundings give to the man turned 
Indian.

RECIPE, PATENTED. 
For cooking beefsteak in the woods. 

By Bishop William A. Quayle. 

Buy a beefsteak, paying for it, if that inconvenience be 
found necessary. Go valiantly to some piece of woods shut 
off from human observation. Build a fire, using last year's 
leaves for kindling and balsam-breathed broken branches

for fuel. Take time. Have no haste. Loaf, and invite 
your soul while the fire gets agoing. Have no skillet. A 
skillet will destroy the cooking. Have no dishes, they will 
destroy the eating. Be calm. No neurotic can do the busi- 
ness. It requires great calmness and poise in a transaction 
with beefsteak in the woods. Cook on a stick, taking plen- 
ty of time. Drop the steak in the ashes a few times how 
many times depends on the taste of the COOKEE. When 
cooked, eat with vast deliberation, using fingers only, as 
forks are a disparagement. When eaten, stop. Say grace 
before, during and after. 



CREAMED OYSTERS ON TOAST. 

One pint of cream, one pint of oysters, one tablespoon 
flower, salt and pepper to taste. Let the cream come to a 
boil. Mix the flour with a little cold milk and stir into the 
hot cream. Let the oysters come to a boil in their own 
liquor then skim and drain off all the liquor and add to the 
cream sauce. Add a dash of paprika. Serve hot over bits 
of buttered toast.

A BACHELOR BREAKFAST. 

Blessed with a good appetite, on which waits a good di- 
gestion, having cultivated a somewhat discriminating taster 
and not having had an income that quite keeps the pace, why 
should I try to decide what my favorite recipe is ? Canape to 
cheese, I enjoy viands to the full, if they be simple, tooth- 
some, and wholesome, for "the chief pleasure (in eating) 
does not consist in costly seasoning or exquisite flavor, but 
in yourself." 

How foolish then to attempt the selection of a "best" 
among so many "good." Let me rather tell you of one 
breakfast prepared and eaten alone, than which none ever 
tasted better. 

A long summer punctuated three times a day by hotel and 
restaurant fare, which is the bane of the traveling man.

Tired nature finally objected and directed me to put into 
practice some of my kitchen theories, and this is the break- 
fast. 

The percolator having been loaded with a generous charge 
of freshly grown coffee and the pump started ; the peaches 
were then cut and sugared, ready for the cream, and the 
kitchen table spread, to be close by the fire, not overlooking 
a goodly supply of butter and rolls. Three or four lumps of 
sweet beef fat were well tried out in the hot frying pan, 
then a good sized beef tenderloin steak with a sprinkle of 
salt, added, and when half done a few half inch cuts of a 
beefsteak tomato. The pan and its contents were left to the 
tender mercies of the fire, while the peaches were eaten and 
the coffee poured, then I went up against the steaming fat 
steak and tomatoes, each of which had drawn richness of 
flavor from the other, as it can only be done in the despised 
skillet. Oh me ! Oh my ! !

TO GLACE FRUITS. 

The fruit must be perfectly dry. If oranges, separate 
each section carefully without breaking the inner skin. 
Stand them in a warm place to dry. Put two cups of gran- 
ulated sugar in a granite saucepan, moisten it with y* cup 
of water, and place over the fire to boil. Do not stir after 
the sugar is dissolved. Boil gently about 15 minutes, or 
until it will break quickly when dropped in cold water. If 
brittle without being sticky, it is just right. The syrup 
must never be stirred. Now take it quickly from the fire, 
add 1 tablespoon of lemon juice and stand in a basin of 
boiling water to keep the syrup from candying. Take fruit 
on the point of a large skewer, or with the sugar tongs ; 
dip into the syrup and stand in a warm, dry place to dry. 
English walnuts and almonds are glaced the same way. Do 
not attempt to glace fruits or nuts on a damp day, or when 
there is any steam in the kitchen from other cooking.
