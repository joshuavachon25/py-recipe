OYSTERS' shoute always 
be fresh and never used 
after being long from 
the shell. If cooked, they 
should be just cooked and 
served instantly, as an over- 
done oyster or one that is 
allowed to stand after cooking 
is tough. 

If served raw, they should 
be taken from the shells just 
before using and be icy cold.

^ COCKTAIL ^ 

PACK the bottom of a cham- 
pagne-glass with shaved ice 
and lay on it six small oysters. 
Make a dressing of one tablespoon- 
ful of tomato catsup, one of lemon- 
juice, one of Worcestershire sauce, 
two dashes of Tabasco, pinch of 
salt and a teaspoonful of grated 
horseradish. On the top float a few 
cubes of crisp white celery. 

^ EPICURE ffj 

HAVE the oysters freshly 
opened. Scrub and dry the 
deep shell and lay an oyster 
in each one without any of their 
own juice. Sprinkle with salt and 
put a teaspoonful of mayonnaise on 
each oyster; on that a tiny bit of 
caviar. Sprinkle the caviar with 
cayenne. Serve icy cold. 

3H IN ICE BLOCK ag 

MAKE a square hollow in a 
block of ice, using a hot flat- 
iron or .brick. Stand the 
block on a folded napkin upon 
a platter, wipe out all the water 
from the cavity and decorate the 
block with smilax. Wash and wipe 
the oysters; season them with salt 
and cayenne and lay them in the 
ice hollow, with thin slices of lemon 
on top. 



3H RELISH m 

MAKE little cups by cutting 
lemons or small shaddocks in 
halves crosswise and remov- 
ing the pulp. Half bury these cups 
in shaved ice and fill them with 
small oysters, that have been care- 
fully looked over, and a few bits of 
the lemon pulp. At the latest 
moment pour over a dressing made 
of grated horseradish, vinegar, salt 
and paprika. Cover the top with 
stiffly whipped cream.

^ BALTIMORE % 

SCRUB the shells well with a 
brush and cold water; arrange 
them in a baking-pan, without 
opening, rounded side of the shell 
down, and put in a hot oven. As 
soon as the shells open, take them 
from the oven, remove the top 
shells carefully and turn the oysters 
out on small squares of toasted 
bread that have been dipped in 
cream and lightly seasoned with 
salt and pepper. Have ready a little 
melted butter mixed with lemon- 
juice and seasoned with cayenne; 
put a few drops of this on each 
oyster. 

BOILED IN THE SHELL 

WASH and scrub the shells of 
unopened oysters and pack 
them one by one, the deep 
side down, in a wire-basket; plunge 
them in boiling water and cook un- 
til the shells open. Have ready hot 
melted butter, seasoned with pap- 
rika, lemon-juice and a little salt. 
Remove the oysters, wipe the shells 
dry; lift the upper shell and put a 
half -teaspoon ful of the hot butter 
sauce on each oyster. Serve with 
the shells arranged on a folded nap- 
kin laid on a hot plate. 



HOT HALF-SHELLS 

OPEN large fresh oysters; 
clean the deep shells, arrange 
on a baking-pan and set them 
in the oven until very hot. Lift 
out the pan and put in each half- 
shell a teaspoonful of hot butter, a 
dust of cayenne and a raw oyster. 
Return the pan to the oven, turn the 
oysters over once in the butter and 
serve in the shells the moment the 
gills are crinkled. Serve with 
them thin brown-bread-and-butter 
sandwiches. 

3H RARE ROAST ^ 

PLACE the unopened oysters in 
their shells, with the deep 
side down, upon clear live 
coals and cook until the shells open. 
Take up quickly, remove the upper 
shells and season each oyster gener- 
ously with salt, pepper and butter. 
Serve at once in the shells arranged 
on a folded napkin. Pass with 
them crisp hot squares of buttered 
toast. 

REMOLINO HACIENDA 

WASH and clean the shells of 
the unopened oysters; after 
opening leave them in the 
lower deep half-shell. Pile them in 
a large, shallow pan and place the 
pan in a hot oven and cook till the 



edges of the oysters curl. Have hot 
thick cream seasoned with melted 
butter, salt and paprika ; put a tea- 
spoonful of this on each oyster, 
serve hot in the shells. 

STEAMED IN SHELLS 

WASH the shells of unopened 
oysters and pack them 
closely, deep side down, in 
a steamer. Cover tightly, pressing 
a towel closely around the lid, and 
place over boiling water until the 
shells open easily. They may be 
served in the half-shells, or opened 
and seasoned and sent to the table 
in a hot covered dish.

2H AL FRESCO % 

STRING the oysters on a small 
wire, bent like a hairpin, put- 
ting first an oyster then a very 
thin slice of salt pork, the size of 
the oysters, and so on till the wire 
is filled; sprinkle with cayenne. 
Fasten the ends of the wire into a 
long wooden handle and broil be- 
fore an open fire. 

BLUE POINT ROLLS 

CUT small shapely thin slices of 
cold rare roast beef and spread 
them sparingly with mixed 
mustard. Cover each one with a 
similarly shaped, transparently thin, 
slice of bacon and finish with a 
plump oyster, lightly dusted with 
salt and pepper. Roll and fasten 
with a tiny skewer; dip in melted 
butter, arrange on a buttered broiler 
and grill over a slow clear fire until 
the bacon and oysters are cooked. 
Turn the rolls often, every time 
dipping them in melted butter. 
Serve with brown butter to which 
lemon-juice is added; one teaspoon- 
ful of juice to four of melted butter. 

W. BROCHETTES ^ 

TAKE long skewers, string 
upon them, alternately, large 
fat oysters and wafers of 
sliced bacon, cut the size of the 
oysters. Commence each skewer 



with bacon and end with bacon. 
Broil over a clear fire until the 
oysters are firm. Have narrow but- 
tered fingers of toast on a hot plate, 
place each skewer on a "finger" and 
pour over each a little hot butter, 
seasoned with salt, white pepper 
and a few drops of Tabasco. 

3K DEVILED SJ 

|X)R a dozen large oysters, take 
X/ a half-teaspoonful of dry mus- 
tard, a saltspoonful of pepper 
and the yolks of two eggs. Mix to 
a smooth paste and coat the oysters. 
Roll in fine cracker-crumbs and 
broil over a bright fire.

oysters thoroughly. The larger 
the oysters the better they are 
for broiling. Mix pepper and 
salt with a bountiful supply of 
very fine cracker-crumbs; dip the 
oysters in melted butter and roll in 
this. Butter or grease a fine wire 
gridiron, lay the oysters in smoothly 
and closely and broil till the juice 
flows and are slightly browned. 
Serve on a hot platter with pieces 
of lemon.

and if necessary roll again in the 
crumbs, lay in a wire frying-basket 
and plunge in smoking hot lard for
