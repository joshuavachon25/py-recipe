COOKING FOR PROFIT 

PART I 



COOKING AS A PROFESSION 

COOKING is essentially woman's profession. From 
the dawn of history she has prepared the food for 
the family. Good cooking is a fine art. It is as well 
the most useful of the arts. Of the old time arts, it alone 
remains for the most part in the home. The final prepara- 
tion of food to eat only has not been nearly completely com- 
mercialized and made a factory industry. The demand for 
home-cooked food still remains well nigh universal. 

If you are about to choose a useful profession, if you are 
suddenly thrown on your own resources and need to earn 
money, then, provided you have a love for cooking and some 
proficiency in it, a wide field of service is open to you. People 
must eat to live. Everyone likes good things to eat and 
many are able and willing to pay liberally for well cooked 
food. Good cooking is the first essential to success in .all 
lines of food service. Many a woman today enjoys a good 
income because she was in the first place a good cook. 

Profitable Openings for an Expert Cook 

The following are some of the avenues open to the woman 
who can cook some particular things particularly well : 

1. Regularly cook special dishes to fill private orders. 

a. At your own home. 

b. In the home of your patrons. 

2. Sell cooked food on a commission to 

Woman's Exchange

7. Conduct a guest house, summer camp, or small hotel. 

The place where you live will in some instances determine 
the line of work to be taken up. Many women cannot leave 
their homes but can, in their own kitchens, follow one of the 
above avenues and build up a successful business. If you 
must seek a new location you should choose it with due regard 
for the thing you plan to do and the kind of patronage de- 
sired. You can do different things if you are on an auto- 
mobile road in the country than you can do in a crowded sec- 
tion of the city. 

Qualifications Essential for Success 

Do not undertake to earn money by cooking unless you 
have certain qualifications, many of which can be developed 
even though they are not very apparent in the beginning. 
Training for the work either in the home or in an accredited 

school. 
Experience — A person with training only and no experience 

cannot expect to make a great success until she has had 

experience. 
Confidence in yourself, your business, and your ability to 

succeed ; self-reliance. 
High standards — Your work should be considered as a fine 

art to be developed and improved. 
Honesty — Do the things as you advertise to do them. 
Ideals — Willingness to work steadily and diligently until the 

ideal is reached. Striving toward high ideals makes work 

more interesting as well as more remunerative. 
Love for the work, belief in it, enthusiasm for it. 
Far-sightedness in starting and developing the business. 
Progressiveness — not willing to stay -always in one place 

unless to improve or enlarge it, but ambitious to go ahead 

in your particular line or to undertake something larger. 



6 COOKING FOR PROFIT 

Executive ability — The power to do things yourself and to 
get others to do things for you. 

Intelligence in purchasing and adapting equipment and sup- 
plies. 

Ability to use time, energy and materials to the best ad- 
vantage, wasting nothing, making the best use of every- 
thing; practice thrift. 

Ability to handle money wisely — Spend it for things that 
are necessary to the business with no wasting of funds; 
be prompt in paying your bills and meeting obligations 
expect no favors, be careful to collect what is due you. 

Ability to keep simple accounts and correctly add and sub- 
tract, multiply and divide . 

Good judgment in deciding all of the many questions that 
come up ; the determination to ''never get left." 

Adaptability to conditions, including the condition of having 
poor or insufficient help, of not having the supplies on hand 
that were expected, of not having the utensils that are 
required. 

Tact in meeting people, shown in saying and doing the 
proper thing, especially avoiding what will offend or dis- 
turb. 

Skill in dealing with men or emergencies; ability to talk or 
write to people, including business people, women of 
leisure, people who are not normal, people with plenty of 
money, people with little money. 
Sympathy and consideration for employees, for trades 

people and for patrons. It is absolutely necessary to be able 

to put yourself in other people's places. Run your business 

on the Golden Rule — ''Do unto others as you would have 

them do unto you," or "Love your neighbor as yourself." 

It need not be more ; it should not be less. 
Service your standard — service to the people with whom 

you are working and for whom you are working. You are a 



COOKING AS A PROFESSION 7 

servant — one who serves — no matter what you are doing. 
Make every effort to please and satisfy your patrons ; to do 
things as they wish them done. 

Concentration on the thing in hand. Do not allow your- 
self to be turned aside to something else when you are sure 
of what your are doing. 

Pleasing personality, necessary if you are to come in con- 
tact with your patrons. 

Neatness and cleanliness — in appearance always suitably 
dressed and well-groomed. 

. Good health with a determination to maintain it. In order 
to do this you should have a hobby outside of your business. 
The person who has a hobby and rides it seldom "goes to 
smash" physically. Do not overwork ; it does not pay in the 
long run. 

Belief in the axiom ''Trifles make perfection, and perfec- 
tion is no trifle f' Perfection of flavor and texture ; attractive 
serving, garnishing and decorating; absolute uniformity; 
scrupulous cleanliness. 

These are among the trifles that make or mar one's reputa- 
tion and product. The best food will always sell the best. 

If you haven't all these characteristics, associate with you 
someone who has them. All of these qualifications are not 
necessary in every avenue that is open to the woman who can 
cook, but cultivation of those that are not natural tendencies 
will result in increased business. 

It is true that these qualifications, with a determination to 
succeed, will bring success in almost any line of work, but 
they are specially needed in the management of a business 
of your own. 



8 COOKING FOR PROFIT 

Perfecting A Specialty 

If you have the ability to cook some special thing particu- 
larly well, look around and see if there is a possibility of 
marketing it. 

You may be able to use foodstuff grown in your own 
garden or orchard or farm, or in your immediate vicinity. 

You may have a formula that has been handed down in 
your family or worked out from much experimenting that 
you can develop as your specialty. Is it a thing that appeals 
to the needs or desires of the people in your neighborhood, 
or your town, of your city? Perhaps your jellies, marma- 
lade and preserves are already famous. Instead of preserves 
it may be mincemeat, or a particular kind of cake (one 
woman I know of makes a splendid living with only a 
delicious chocolate cake as her specialty), or a cake with a 
very nice frosting or filling or attractive and unusual decora- 
tions; it may be candy, or bread, or sandwiches, or dough- 
nuts that you make so well that a market for it can be built 
up. Many such specialties will be suggested, but make a 
beginning the easiest way. 

Characteristics of Food to be Sold 

In order that you may sell any kind of food at a price suf- 
ficiently high to make a profit it must be 

Something that people want, made especially well. 

Superior to that sold in the ordinary shop. 

Made of choice materials. 

Made exactly from a definite formula so that results will 

always be the same. 
Kept up to a high standard. 

Labeled truthfully as to quality, weight, kind of product. 
Prepared systematically and efficiently. 
Always ready at the time agreed upon. 



COOKING AS A PROFESSION 9 

A specialty — Make only one or two things at first ; "special- 
ize" and again "specialize." 

How TO Market Your Specialty 

First prepare a sample of the dish in which you plan to 
specialize. Place it in the kind of a container you plan to 
use — jelly glass, or fruit jar, or paper carton, or box — ^label 
it, wrap and tie it as it should be. 

Show it and offer to prepare it for families in your im- 
mediate neighborhood, using your materials or theirs, or 
buying it in the market, or better still, from a farmer near by. 
You can charge for this so much a jar, or so much an hour or 
a day, plus the cost of all materials used — jars, rubbers, fuel, 
etc. 

Talk your plans over with your friends and tell them what 
you propose to do, and let them ask their friends to give you 
orders. 

Take your sample to a private boarding or day school and 
ask if there is a chance there for your specialty to be put on 
sale. Some people make sandwiches, cakes or candy for 
sale at schools where the children cannot go home to lunch. 

Take your samples to a shop or factory where it can be 
sold at noontime. 

Take samples to the largest grocers or soda fountain shops 
in your town or in a neighboring city. Ask them to exhibit 
and take orders for you, or rent you space where you can 
offer it for sale. 

If there is a woman's exchange show them what you can 
do and talk over with the manager the possibility of a market 
there for your wares, or ask them to suggest something that 
you could make. 

Place a sign in front of your house if you are on an auto- 
mobile road. State what you have to sell. Show samples on 
a neat, attractive stand under a large shade tree if convenient. 



10 COOKING FOR PROFIT 

AHvertise in the local or city papers. 

Send announcement cards to people whom you think would 
be most interested in the kind of thing you propose to make. 

Send business-like typewritten letters to stores, restaurants, 
hotels, boarding houses and private families whom you 
haven't time or opportunity to call upon. 

Cooperate with other people in your neigborhood who 
have products to sell similar to yours, and either hire a room 
and sell direct to automobile tourists or solicit patronage 
from some large firm in a neighboring city. 

Establishing a Reputation 

If your specialty is delicious and superior to or different 
from others, and of uniform quality, there will be purchasers 
who will tell others who will buy, and they in turn will tell 
others, and before long your reputation will be established 
and a market will have developed for your output. 

One person will write to another about it, and you will 
have orders from other places if your goods can be shipped. 
If you keep up your high standard you will be asked to make 
other similar things and then different things. Do not try 
to do too many different kinds of things. It is a mistake to 
let your business grow so large that you cannot continue to 
give your personal touch and oversight to everything that 
goes out from your home and later on, perhaps, from your 
factory. Attention to every detail, even though the work 
must be done by others, can give a home touch to even a 
large business. 

Percentage of Profit 

Before you have decided definitely on the thing in which 
you wish to specialize you should know its cost and its usual 
selling price. The difference between the cost and the price 
which you get for it will be your profit and should be suf- 



COOKING AS A PROFESSION 11 

ficient to pay you well for your time and labor. Usually the 
wholesale selling price must be about double the cost of raw 
materials. 

How TO Figure Cost 

Many women in figuring the cost of an article think only 
of the materials of which it is made. In addition to that they 
should consider the cost of conducting the business, (the 
overhead and operating expense), as well as the containers, 
wrappings, string, etc. 

The overhead includes rent of zvorkroom. If you own the 
house or building, the interest, repairs, taxes and insurance 
for a year should be estimated. If you propose to use only 
one room in an eight-room house, only one-eighth of the 
rent need be charged as overhead. If two rooms in a five- 
room apartment will be used, two-fifths of the rent will be 
your share. 

It includes interest and depreciation on the equipment. 
Equipment includes stove, tables, sink, utensils, etc., used 
chiefly in your business. Make a list of them with their 
value. Figure interest on the amount of money you could 
get if your equipment were sold and the money were placed 
in the bank. Add to this figure one-fi£th (20%) of the value 
you have put upon it as depreciation, or for a sinking fund 
with which to replace equipment. This should be counted as 
part of the overhead expense. Even though that equipment 
has been in use for years, you should consider what it is 
worth now and what it would cost to replace it. 

The cost of coal, gas, electricity, gasoline or other fuel 
which you will use in your cooking must be included; also 

Lights, if you have to work after dark. 

Water, if it is taxed. 

Ice, if used in keeping your supplies in good condition. 

Telephone; you can do little business without one. 



12 COOKING FOR PROFIT 

Advertising, if you plan to advertise in any way, including 
stationery, and postage if you send out announcements. 

Estimate the cost of help, including any assistance you plan 
to have in cooking, packing, delivering, soliciting business, 
etc. If perchance a member of your own family is your 
assistant, figure that at a definite amount, probably at what it 
would cost you to get the work done by someone from out- 
side. 

Total up estimated expenses for one year, divide by 12 or 
by the number of months you plan to work each year. This 
will give you the overhead and operating cost for one month. 

Divide by the number of working days in a month to learn 
the cost of doing business each day. 

Next estimate the amount of food that you could prepare 
in an ordinary working day of eight or nine hours. How 
many jars or loaves can you make? What will be the cost 
of the raw material, that cost being based on wholesale 
prices? What will be the cost of containers, labels, string, 
etc.? What will be the cost of commissions f 

Add these sums together, then add the overhead for one 
day. This will show you the total cost per day of what you 
propose to cook. 

Now put down what you expect to receive for the finished 
product per jar or per loaf. Then estimate the selling price 
of all that you could prepare in a day. Is this more or less 
than the total cost of the product as estimated above? If 
more, subtract the day's cost from the expected receipts. 
Is the difference (this is the profit) enough to pay you for the 
time and labor you will spend in preparing and selling it? 

The amount of profit you should receive should be not less 
than the wages or salary you would receive for doing the 
same amount or kind of work in another home or factory, 
or other place of business. Thirty to forty cents an hour is 



COOKING AS A PROFESSION 13 

the wage, paid in 1921 to houseworkers sent out from a first- 
class office. 

If there seems to be not enough profit in it after paying 
these expenses, think of some other product you might make. 
Do not cook all day without the probability of a reasonable 
profit. 

Every bit of the food material and other supplies should 
be utilized. The cost is based not alone on what goes into 
the product, but on what is wasted as well. Be careful that 
nothing is wasted. 

You may make "pin money" and gain experience without 
reckoning your overhead expense, but you cannot call it 
"Cooking for Profit." 

Necessary Equipment 

Before going very far in the production in your own 
kitchen of some special foodstuff, you want to look around 
your kitchen and think of it as a workshop where you can 
do a maximum amount of work with a minimum amount of 
time and strength. See if there are any ways in which the 
equipment in your workshop can be improved. Are the 
tables and sinks of the right height? Is the equipment that 
best adapted for the kind of work you propose to do ? Think 
of any kind of a shop in which a man works, how he has his 
tools arranged so he can get at them most easily, and plan 
your workshop so that you will save the greatest number of 
steps. 

There are some things that can be changed for a small 
am.ount of money and will mean the saving of time and much 
more money to you. If you are going to do your best work 
it is absolutely essential that you plan your workshop. Most 
efficient arrangements are described in Household Engineer- 
ing, by Christine Frederick.*

14 COOKING FOR PROFIT 

Note the lines of travel and be sure the ingredients that 
you are going to use are grouped together close to the utensils 
that you are going to use ; that these are close to the stove and 
that there is a shelf or table near the stove to which they can 
be removed from the stove and finished, wrapped or boxed, 
etc. Make your shop a model for convenience in order that 
you may get the greatest possible amount of work done. 

The equipment will depend on the product which you 
decide to make. You will need a range; use gas if it is 
available, — because it is easily regulated and saves much time. 
If electric current is very cheap it may be practical to adopt 
that. At any rate use gas or electricity if you can, depend- 
ing on which is the cheapest or most available. Coal or wood 
require more time and effort and results are not so regular. 
Vapor gasoline stoves are very successful if you cannot get 
gas. Gasoline is better than kerosene for professional cook- 
ing. 

The water supply is important. There should be hot run- 
ning water as well as cold to make your work easier, and 
the sink should be at the right height to save the strain on the 
back; i. e., bottom of sink, 30 to 33 inches from the floor. 

The work table should be of some material that does not 
need to be scrubbed. Marble, or porce-namel, or heavy glass 
are very good. 

The utensils should be of the best possible materials so that 
they will last, aluminum or agate, depending on the amount 
of work you are going to do. For some things tin is better. 
Copper or heavy steel are necessary for some kinds of cook- 
ing, as will be explained. Have assorted sizes that you may 
be able to prepare large or small amounts of food. Standard- 
ize your equipment in kind and number as quickly as possi- 
ble, and have as much as you need but no more, so that a 
minimum amount of time and energy will be used in caring

for them. Proper care should be taken of utensils that they 
may last as long a time as possible; the wrong kind of care 
will make short the life of the best utensil. 

An electric egg beater, chopper, etc., may be purchased as 
soon as your business warrants it, as well as a meat and bread 
sheer. 

Inlaid linoleums make about the best floor covering if well 
cemented to the floor. The walls should be easily cleanable 
and the color scheme attractive — light rather than dark. 
Plenty of light and cross ventilation are very necessary. A 
ventilating hood over the stove is particularly desirable. 



16 COOKING FOR PROFIT 

Do not be afraid to start in your own home in a small way, 
nor be discouraged if you do not make a lot of money at first. 
If you make a good product and are determined to succeed 
you mill succeed.

Cream Soups for Invalids up to $2.50 a quart. 

The cost of selling is 25% to 40% of the retail price, 
therefore if you put your product in a shop you will get 
less than these prices. If possible sell direct to private trade 
and get all the profit yourself. 

One woman who is putting up 28,000 jars of canned fruits, 
vegetables and jellies in a season charges $5.85 a dozen pints 
and delivers direct to housewives. She takes orders and gets 
her empty jars in the spring. 

Standardizing Recipes 

As soon as possible standardize your recipe, file all data 
on cards, and purchase or improvise a box to hold the cards 
as they accumulate. 

Amounts, cost, et cetera, may be on one side ; the method 
of preparation may be on the other side of the card, with 
other notes. Other cards may have the addresses of firms 
from whom supplies are purchased, the names and addresses 
and other data regarding your customers, the amounts of 
food prepared at different times, et cetera.

Cost of the 8 glasses of marmalade $0.92. You can add 
overhead charges, say 2 hours at 20c per hour, (40 cents) ; 
your labor, say 2 hours at 40c (80 cents), and sell the 8 
glasses for $2.12 (27 cents a glass), or, if you double the 
cost of materials, as is quite often done, you will sell for 
$1.84 and will have 92 cents or 20 cents per hour for over- 
head and 26 cents per hour for your time. 

If you sell at retail, charging 35 cents a glass or $2.80 for 
8 glasses you will have a margin of $1.88 or 20 cents per 
hour for overhead, and 74 cents per hour for your time, 
but you will have to pay for box, paper and string, and 
maybe delivery charges. 



REVERSE SIDE OF THE CARD 



Directions: Cut fruit in quarters and slice very, very 
thin, rejecting only seeds of the fruit and the core of the 
grapefruit. Add water and let stand in an earthen dish over 
night. Next morning boil until tender and again let stand 
over night. Boil 10 minutes, add sugar and boil, stirring 
occasionally that it may not burn, to 220 degrees Fahrenheit. 
Pour into sterile glasses, let stand, covered with cheesecloth 
until firm. Cover glasses and label. 



:20 COOKING FOR PROFIT 

Buying supplies in larger quantities at lower rates, slicing 
fruit with a machine instead of by hand, and otherwise 
lessening the time consumed, putting the product into larger 
or smaller jars, would decrease the cost and thus increase 
the profit. 

Hotels and Pullman dining cars are good customers for 
individual jars of marmalade. 

CANNING 

Fruits may be canned by the cold pack or the open kettle 
method. Strive for appearance, flavor and just the right 
degree of tenderness. 

The cold pack method is the best to use for vegetables. 
They must be canned within a few hours of the time they 
are picked. Be sure to use new rubbers of a make that 
will withstand the processing. For full directions send to 
U. S. Department of Agriculture, Washington, D. C, for 
Bulletins 839 and 853, also for Bulletins telling about 
"Canning Clubs," and to your State College for all bulletins 
they have issued on canning and preserving. 

Interstate Sales 

Send to your State House and to the United States 
Bureau of Chemistry, Washington, D. C, for information 
regarding the requirements of canned goods that are to be 
sold that you may not unknowingly do anything that will 
prevent the sale of your goods from one state to another. 
Briefly, the label must tell the truth and give the net weight 
in the container. 

Read everything you see that can help you in your work. 
There are several excellent books recently published, which 
are listed at the end of this lesson. 



SPECIALTY COOKING 21 

Kinds of Preserves 

In preserves the shape of the fruit should be retained. 
It is not necessary to follow the old rule — a pound of sugar 
to a pound of fruit; many people prefer them made with 
^ pound sugar to each pound of fruit. In jams the fruit 
is mashed and the same proportion of sugar used as in 
preserves. 

Spiced fruits are preserves seasoned with spices and 
vinegar. 

Conserves are preserves to which orange juice and rind, 
lemon juice, raisins and nuts are added, although nuts may 
be omitted. 

Recipe for Conserve 

An acid fruit is ordinarily used for a conserve and a formula 
something like this : 

4 to 5 pounds fruit, — rhubarb, plums, cranberries, peaches, etc. 

1 to 2 pounds raisins, stoned and put through food chopper or 
seedless raisins left whole. 

2 to 3 oranges thinly sliced as for marmalade. 
I lemon thinly sliced, if needed for flavor. 

5 pounds sugar. 

I pound nut meats. 

Water if the fruit is not sufficiently juicy. 

Cook fruit until tender, add sugar and cook until it jellies; 
add nuts just before pouring into glasses. 

Many kinds of preserved fruits can be prepared with 
rhubarb used up to 50% of the total fruit, to reduce the 
cost and the selling price. 

The greatest demand is for standard preserves and canned 
goods. You might specialize in old fashioned family recipes. 

Always use the same kind of jar and glass and cover. 

Labeling 

Have attractive printed labels after your business becomes 
established and, if you like, adopt a trade name. Labels 
are cheaper in lots oi 2}^ thousand than in thousand lots. 



22 COOKING FOR PROFIT 

Try to attend exhibitions of canned fruit and vegetables 
and to exhibit your own products, as you will learn by obser- 
vation and comparison to tell good canned products when 
you see them. When starting out to sell your products, it 
will give you confidence if you know that you have an article 
that is extra fine. 

Packing for Market 
When packing glass jars for market, the corrugated card- 
board boxes, in which the new jars come, will be found 
to be the best containers. The jars should be wrapped in 
paper and then placed in the sections of the box. If this 
box is then packed in a wooden box, there will be little 
danger of breakage. 

Canning in Other People's Homes 
Many people have large gardens and will gladly pay 
wages of three, four or five dollars a day to someone who 
will go to their homes and can fruits and vegetables and 
make their preserves, jellies and pickles. Assistance will 
be provided when necessary. The money is all clear profit. 
A small advertisement in the paper should bring all the 
customers one could assist. 

JELLIES 

Jellies and marmalades are stiffened by the pectin which 
is present in certain fruits, particularly when they are not 
quite ripe. The pectin must be cooked out of the fruit, but 
it is weakened or partly destroyed by too long boiling. Jelly 
results from boiling the pectin containing juices with the 
proper proportion of sugar, provided acid is present. Com- 
mercial pectin may be added to any kind of fruit juice and 
with sugar very quickly makes a firm jelly. 

After preparing the fruit, it is cooked gently till tender in 
its own juices or with a small quantity of water, i to 3 cups

per pound, then allowed to drip through double cheese cloth 
or through a flannel bag. The clear juice is next measured, 
boiled lo minutes or longer according to the density of the 
juice, and combined with the proper proportion of sugar, 
after which it is boiled again to the jelly point and poured 
into sterilized jelly glasses, cooled quickly and sealed. 

The amount of pectin present can be judged by adding 
a spoonful of alcohol to an equal quantity of cooled fruit 
juice. The pectin is not soluble in this mixture and forms 
a more or less dense mass. The less pectin present, the less 
sugar should be used. Three-quarters of a cup of sugar 
to one cup of juice should make a clear sparkling jelly of 
the right consistency and flavor. Use a thermometer in mak- 
ing your jellies and, after adding the sugar, boil to 220 to 
221 degrees Fahrenheit for a firm jelly. 

By covering the fruit pulp with a little water and heating 
after the first draining, a second and sometimes a third 
extraction can be made which doubles the amount of jelly 
secured from a given amount of fruit, without lessening the 
quality of the jelly. It is best to combine the second and 
third extractions and boil down until the pectin test shows 
the correct proportion of pectin present to make a jelly uni- 
form with the first lot. 

In making jellies, jams and marmalades, it is best to cook 
only small quantities at a time. Enough juice for twelve 
half pint glasses of jelly is a sufficient amount for each kettle. 
Use a broad bottom kettle filled not more than one-third full 
and work quickly for best results. By planning the work, 
at least 100 glasses of jelly can be made in a day. 

Fruit juice for jellies may be canned in glass jars during 
the fruit season, and made up into jelly with the sugar, 
later on, to fill your orders. 

The cost of materials, if all must be purchased, should 
not be more than one- third of the retail selling price or two- 



24 COOKING FOR PROFIT 

fifths to one-half the wholesale price. Unless you are near 
the source of supply and can obtain fruits at low prices, 
your costs may be too high to sell standard goods at a fair 
profit. 

The most popular jellies are currant, grape, apple, apple 
and mint, and quince. Some combinations of fruit are 
especially good as: 

Currant and raspberry, 
Quince, apple and cranberry, 
Apple and grape, 
Apple and rhubarb. 

Filling Jelly Glasses 

When filling the glasses pour the jelly first into a teapot 
or pitcher and then into the hot glasses which should be 
standing in a pan so that no jelly will be lost in case a 
glass breaks. 

When jelly is cold and firm, fasten a swab of cotton on 
a skewer, dip in pure alcohol and wipe over the top of the 
jelly, to destroy any germs that might cause fermentation. 

Cut glazed paper to fit inside the glass, dip in alcohol, 
and lay on top of the jelly. Cover each glass with a larger 
piece of glazed paper with edges clipped and paste firmly 
to outside of glass. 

Paraffin may be used for sealing but is less attractive, and 
may not prevent fermentation around the edges, and it costs 
more. If the jelly is to be shipped some distance it may be 
necessary to supply metal covers. 

Special Containers for Jellies 

Jellies may be put up in unusual sized glasses or jars. 
Boxes or baskets holding 6 2-oz. glasses of jelly, each a 
different color and flavor, are very popular as gifts. 



SPECIALTY COOKING 25 

Standardization 

Quality and appearance are of the greatest importance. 
For this the raw materials must be in perfect condition. 
Satisfy your customer at whatever cost to yourself. 

Standardize your product — 

Know how many glasses or jars of a jelly or a marmalade 
or other product you should get from a known weight of 
fruit and of sugar. 

Make every effort to secure the same results each time you 
make a batch; the difference of one glass will make much 
difference in your profit. 

Weigh a glass that is filled to the right height and be 
sure that every other glass offered for sale contains exactly 
the same amount and exactly the same quality of product. 

PICKLES AND RELISHES 

There are many delicious home made pickles and relishes 
that are seldom found in the retail stores. If your garden 
produces a surplus of small cucumbers or tomatoes and 
you can make your own cider vinegar, your specialty may 
be right there. 

The following pickle is easily prepared and very satis- 
factory. 

Saco Pickle 

Sell for $2.00 a dozen in 5J^ ounce jars. 
Wash and wipe small fresh green cucumbers, pack in 
glass jars and pour over them the following mixture. 

Sift together 
I cup sugar. 
I cup salt. 

% cup mustard. Add slowly while stirring constantly 
I quart vinegar. When smooth add 
3 quarts vinegar. Have the liquid fill jars to overflowing 

and cover closely. 

SALAD DRESSINGS 

A few years ago it was considered necessary to use pure 
olive oil in mayonnaise and French dressings, but there 



26 COOKING FOR PROFIT 

are several other vegetable oils, including cottonseed, peanut 
and corn oils, now found to be perfectly satisfactory. Do 
not, however, charge olive oil prices for a dressing made 
of a cheaper oil. Salad oil may be purchased in five gallon 
tins for much less than retail prices. 

One Gallon of Mayonnaise 

3 tablespoons salt. 

3 tablespoons powdered sugar. 

3 tablespoons mustard. 

^2 teaspoon cayenne. Mix well, add 
i^ dozen egg yolks, beat until light, add 
i}i cups vinegar. Add very slowly 

3^2 quarts salad oil. As it thickens, add, a little at a time, . 
I cup lemon juice. Add 
I cup boiling water, if desired. 

This quantity makes about g pints. The cost today is about 33 
cents a pint, and it sells for 60 cents a pint. 

You may find some sale for Sauce Tartare or Russian 
Dressing made with a basis of mayonnaise dressing. 

Sauce Tartare 

To one quart mayonnaise dressing add 3 tablespoons each capers, 
pickles, olives, parsley, shallot or onion, all finely chopped and % 
cup tarragon vinegar. 

Russian Dressing 

To one quart mayonnaise dressing add slowly 

1 cup chili sauce. 

% cup pimientos cut in small pieces. 
Ys cup tarragon vinegar. 

2 tablespoons chives cut in tiny pieces. 

4 teaspoons table sauce, Worcestershire or Escoffier. 

An electric mixer, although expensive, is a great help in 
beating mayonnaise where large quantities are to be made. 



BREADS 

There is not much profit on plain bread unless made in 
very large quantities as is done in the large bake shops and 



SPECIALTY COOKING 27 

factories. However, orders may be secured for breads that 
are delicious and unusual for use in sandwiches for after- 
noon tea and other parties. 

Yeast breads of different kinds can be developed from 
a standard formula. 

Foundation Recipe for Bread 

Put

Rolls 

If you decide to specialize in rolls, purchase as many kinds 
as are for sale in the community where you plan to sell yours. 



30 COOKING FOR PROFIT 

Experiment with the following formula and shapes until 
you achieve if possible something that is superior to any 
roll that you are able to purchase. 

Make your price, as suggested in Lesson I. It will doubt- 
less be higher than the price asked for other rolls that are 
for sale, but there should be people glad to pay what they 
are worth. 

Biscuits and Rolls 
(A good foundation recipe) 

1 cup milk scalded and cooled. Add 

2 to 4 tablespoons butter substitute 
2 to 4 tablespoons sugar 

1 teaspoon salt 

^ to I yeast cake dissolved in 2 tablespoons lukewarm water. 

Use % yeast cake if to rise overnight, i yeast cake if mixed 

in the morning. 
i^ cups flour. Mix well, let rise and add flour to knead (about 

ij^ cups). Knead, let rise again, shape and bake in hot 

oven 15 to 20 minutes. 

Experiment with different shortenings and use the cheap- 
est shortening that will give you good results. Use as 
much more as you wish up to 8 tablespoons, which will give 
a very rich roll. 

Variations 

2 tablespoons sugar give a good flavor. More may be used up 
to I cup which makes a sweet bun. 

I or more ^gg yolks, or from i to 3 whole eggs may be added 
with excellent results. 

I Qgg white beaten stiff gives a deliciously crisp crust. 

All these suggestions add to the expense of the rolls and 
should not be used unless patrons are willing to pay the 
price. 

Flavor for Rolls 

Attractive flavorings which add a distinctive touch. 

Grated rind one lemon, or 
Yz teaspoon lemon extract, or 

I teaspoon vanilla, or 

54 to I teaspoon cinnamon, or 

5^ cup seedless raisins 

Add the flavorings after the sponge is light. 



SPECIALTY COOKING 31 

Shaping of Rolls 

There are many different shapes — one, two or three balls 
baked in muffin pans, finger rolls, knots, four inches long 
with pointed ends and cuts across the top. Parker House 
and cinnamon rolls are the most popular. 

The unbaked rolls may be brushed over with melted butter, 
milk and sugar or beaten egg to soften the crust or to make 
a glaze, just before they are put into the oven or just before 
they are done. 

Coffee rolls are spread with thin confectioner's frosting 
after baking. They may be made from Brioche, a rich yeast 
mixture, or from the recipe given above with two eggs added. 

The following rules for Brioche or Coffee Cake are taken 
from the Boston Cooking School Cook Book. 

Coffee Cake I (Brioche) 

Scald 

1 cup milk; cool, and when lukewarm add 

2 yeast cakes ; when dissolved add 
4 ^SS yolks 

3 eggs 

^ cup butter 

j4 cup sugar 

}4 teaspoon lemon extract or 2 pounded cardamon seeds and 

4^ cups flour. Beat thoroughly with the hand for lo minutes and 
let rise for 6 hours. Keep in ice box over night ; in morning 
turn on floured board, roll in long rectangular piece ^ inch 
thick; spread with 

Softened butter, fold from sides toward center to make 3 layers. 
Cut off pieces ^ inch wide; cover and let rise. Take each 
piece separately in hands and twist from ends in opposite 
directions, coil and bring ends together at top of cake. Let 
rise in pans and bake twenty minutes in a moderate oven; 
cool and brush over with 

Confectioners' sugar moistened with 

Boiling water to spread and flavored with 

Vanilla. 

Coffee Cakes II

lYz cups flour. Cover and let rise, then add 

% cup melted butter 

2 eggs well beaten 

Few gratings from rind of lemon and 

2^ cups flour. Let rise again and finish like Coffee Cakes I. 

Mixing and Weighing the Dough 
Bread and rolls may be mixed by hand, in an ordinary 
bread mixer, or in an electric mixer. 

Loaves of bread and individual rolls should be weighed 
before the dough is shaped. 

Standardize the weight and size. It must not vary from 
day to day. 

Other Good Sellers 

Hot Boston brown bread and baked beans are popular 
sellers in New England on Saturday evenings. 

Bran muffins, especially with raisins, prunes or dates, 
are purchased as a laxative. 

Bran Muffins 

Sift together 
I cup flour 
I teaspoon soda and 

1 teaspoon salt. Add 

2 cups bran 

iJ4 cups milk and 

1/2 cup molasses. Bake in individual tins. This recipe will make 

one dozen muffins. 
^ cup raisins, dates or soaked prunes, stoned and cut in pieces 

may be added. 

SANDWICHES 

There is a market for sandwiches if they are supplied 
regularly to people who work in large office buildings, 
factories or schools near your home. A neat basket filled 
with sandwiches, each one freshly made and wrapped in wax 
paper, is very quickly emptied. In addition to the sand- 
wiches you may include half pint bottles of milk, homemade 



SPECIALTY COOKING 33 

cookies, cakes, turnovers and candy if you have time to 
make them. You might each day supply cooked food, sand- 
wiches, cakes, pies and doughnuts, to soda fountains where 
luncheonettes are served. Orders can be taken for sandwiches 
for afternoon teas and receptions. 

Use for sandwiches what is known as a sandwich loaf, a 
loaf of bread square at each end and about 13 inches long. 

Purchase a bread slicer to secure ease and uniformity in 
the slicing of bread. 

Learn the number of sandwiches you should get from: 

I loaf of bread 

I pound of butter or oleomargarine 

I pound of cheese 

I ham, best part sliced, poorer pieces chopped 

I roast of beef — the face of the rump will do very nicely 

I fowl 

I head lettuce 

I dozen eggs 

Use plenty of butter on your bread, especially on the 
corners. Use plenty of filling in your sandwiches. 

Moisten chopped mixtures with mayonnaise dressing. 

Use a leaf of lettuce and plenty of salad dressing with 
your chicken and egg sandwiches. 

Occasionally add a new sandwich to the list of old reliable 
ones. 

Know the cost, including butter, wax paper and seasonings, 
of each sandwich you make and fix your selling price accord- 
ingly. One slice bread, doubled and filled, may sell for ten 
cents. 

Computing the Cost of Cooked Meat 

Learn the difference in weight between a piece of meat 
raw and the same piece cooked, the amount of salable 
cooked edible meat that can be obtained from a given weight 



34 COOKING FOR PROFIT 

and cut of raw meat, and estimate the value per pound of 
the cooked meat, exclusive of the overhead and labor costs. 
You will be amazed at the shrinkage. Tabulate your results 
on a card, and be careful not to lose money if you are asked 
to sell cooked meat! 

Did you know, for example, that cooked chicken meat 
is worth $2.00 a pound when chicken sells for 50c a pound ? 

HOW TO BUY 

The amount you pay for your raw material will make 
a big difference in the profit you are able to make. As soon 
as you find your business is actually started, food stuffs and 
wrappings should be purchased at wholesale prices. The 
amount you buy should be governed by 

The size of your storage space. 
The amount that you expect to sell. 
The length of time you expect it to take to use up that 
material. 

With perishable material, order only as much as you can 
use in a day. 

Sugar should be bought in the original packages (100 
pound bags or in barrels). 

Supplies that come by the case should be bought by the 
case. 

Butter and shortening can be bought in tubs, and in time 
of plenty and cheap prices can be placed in storage and 
then taken out as required. 

Eggs should be bought by the case, and it may be possible 
to buy enough for the entire year when they are cheapest 
and most plentiful and keep them in waterglass, or in 
storage. Frozen eggs are satisfactory if contents of con- 
tainer can be used as soon as opened. 



SPECIALTY COOKING 35 

The containers that you propose to use for your product 
should be purchased in large quantities, probably after your 
business is established, in sufficient quantity to last six months 
or a year. The amount purchased at first should depend on 
the amount necessary to start your business. If you are 
starting in a small way you will not buy as much as you 
will later on when you have become known. 

Buy as many supplies as you can direct from the factory, 
in case lots, so that you will have everything that you need 
when you need it. 

The Stock Account 

There should be a check-up system for supplies. The 
stock book should usually be balanced daily. Use a double 
page for each food stuff, etc., which you purchase. On the 
left side of the book record all the stuffs that are received, 
whether paid for or not. The page may be ruled into six 
columns headed as follows : 

PASTRY FLOUR RECEIVED 

Month, Day, Purchased From, Amount, Unit Cost, Total Cost. 

On the right side of the book record food stuffs, etc., 
that are used and go out, with the cost and with the value 
of your product, so that you can check up every day and 
know whether the amount for which you are selling your 
product is more than sufficient to pay for the supplies that 
you are using each day. 

If preferred, cards may be used for the stock record, one 
column for goods received, two columns for goods used. 

A bill should come with the goods that you order which 
can be O. K.'d when they are received. You should make 
a strong point of the way bills come in and are checked up 
so you will pay for nothing that you do not actually receive. 
Mistakes are sometimes made by the most reliable concerns. 



36 COOKING FOR PROFIT 

In the front of the book you may figure what you expect 
your overhead and operating expenses are going to be, 
leaving room to figure out accurately what they are. Then 
right at hand will be the amount per day that must be taken 
in to cover your daily overhead and operating expenses. 
When you total up your expenses for the day and your 
income for the day, you can quickly reckon whether you 
are making or losing money on each day's product. 

Keep your business on a cash basis and pay bills by bank 
check. 

It is a very good plan to deposit all receipts in the bank 
and make all expenditures by check. This method, with 
the use of a Self-Accounting Check Book,* will give you a 
permanent, classified record of all expenses and receipts. 

Inventory 

The amount of material on hand should be found and 
entered in the stock book each month before the orders for 
the next month are given. These figures will be known if 
you balance daily. 

The cost of suppHes actually used can then be figured and 
the total expense, receipts and profit for the month can be 
accurately determined. 

Repairs and Equipment 

Repairs and new equipment should not be entered with 
the daily food stuffs, but should appear by themselves. They 
may follow the inventory of the equipment with which you 
start. 

At the end of the year you can estimate whether the 



* The Office or Household Accounting Check Record, which may 
he used with the checks of any bank, may be obtained from Ameri- 
can School of Home Economics, Chicago. $i.oo postpaid. 



SPECIALTY COOKING 37 

amount of depreciation as figured was sufficient to cover 
the cost of repairs and replacement. Your profit should be 
sufficiently large for you to have a new stove, work table, 
etc., if you should need them, and to keep your equipment 
up-to-date.

PART III 



COOKING FOR THE FOOD SHOP 

THE FOOD shop; DOUGHNUTS, CRULLERS, ECLAIRS, COOKIES 
(plain and fancy) ; plain pastry, — ^PIES and TURN- 
OVERS ; PUFF PASTE, — PATTY SHELLS, VOL AU VENT, FRENCH 
PASTRY ; QUANTITIES THAT PAY ; CHANGING SMALL RECIPES 
TO LARGE ONES ; THE DELICATESSEN SHOP. 

IN most cities and in many towns there is a food shop 
to which consignors may take their products, the shop 
selling the food on a commission, or buying it outright. 
If there is no food shop in your neighborhood it might be 
profitable for you to open one. Perhaps one room in your 
home can easily be arranged with tables or counters and 
shelves, and as the income increases, glass show cases and 
other equipment can be added. 

Locating a Food Shop 

A food shop should be on a main thoroughfare or good 
automobile road, where there is constant passing. If you 
rent a place for your food shop try to have it on the side 
of the street or a corner where people pass in greatest 
numbers. 

Have an attractive show window with something different 
each day, or the arrangement changed, so that there will 
be no danger of people thinking that the same food has 
been in the window for days at a time. Patrons will come 
in because the window appeals to them. 

39 



40 COOKING FOR PROFIT 

A kitchen shut off by glass partitions only from the food 
shop is very effective. For such a kitchen the best and most 
attractive equipment would be required. 

To have patrons come again and again the food should 
be beyond reproach and above criticism. 

* The Interior of the Shop 

The shop itself should be attractive with the attractive- 
ness that comes from 

The use of broom, dust cloth, soap and water. 

Simple fresh curtains at the windows. 

Neat and polite sales girls. 

Tables and counters thoroughly scrubbed. 

Glass and china clean and shining. 

Silverware thoroughly polished. 

An attractive arrangement of boxes, paper and 

twine. 
Quick, efficient and agreeable service. 

At first you may be able to prepare all the food sold and 
fill the orders that are taken. If the business grows, as it 
should, you will find other women who are glad to send in 
cooked foods, or to fill orders left at your shop. You can 
charge them a certain per cent of the selling price of the 
foods they send in, or you can pay them a stipulated price 
and sell the cake or other food at a profit to yourself, prob- 
ably an increase of 20% to 40%, depending on your over- 
head costs. 

Consignors 

The selection of the consignors should be most carefully 
made. The people themselves should be very neat and clean 
in person. Regular inspection should be made of the con- 
signor's kitchen or work shop that you may know if her 
product is made under sanitary conditions. 



COOKING FOR THE FOOD SHOP 41 

Consignments 

Have a definite time when products must be brought in. 

Be critical in passing upon consignments, — do not accept 
anything that is not up to your standard, and have that a 
high one. 

Return consigned articles that are not absolutely right. 

Wrappings 

Have the paper, boxes, twine and labels standardized for 
your shop, and supply them to the consignors. Order these 
supplies where you can get the best prices, and reorder from 
the same firm or firms if their goods are satisfactory. 

The Proprietor's Problem 

The proprietor of a cooked food shop must consider 
costs from a different angle than the consignor. You will 
have to pay for what you get, but you must make some 
arrangement for disposing of what remains unsold. You 
may be able to use it in a tea room or sell it to your em- 
ployees or to outsiders for the cost of the raw material, 
or serve it to your help. 

You must learn as soon as possible to judge accurately of 
the amount that you can sell each day. 

Good Sellers for a Food Shop 

In addition to the canned foods, breads, etc., mentioned 
in Lesson H, good sellers include doughnuts, cream puffs, 
pies and turnovers of all kinds, puff paste patties, and of 
course, all varieties of cakes, cookies and candies. It is 
wise to have but one consignor for each kind of food. 

The Special Dish 

In your food shop have special things that it is difficult 
to get anywhere else. Occasionally have something different, 
and as your business grows, find new consignors. 



42 COOKING FOR PROFIT 

DOUGHNUTS AND CRULLERS 

One woman earned enough from the sale of doughnuts 
to support herself and children and send them through col- 
lege. In some parts of the country the doughnut is called 
a cruller and in others the cruller is called a doughnut. 

This is the recipe for our newest doughnut and the one 
we like best of all. 



Best Ever Doughnuts 

Beat slightly 
I egg and 

1 tgg yolk, adding slowly 
^ cup sugar, then add 

2 tablespoons heavy cream 
y% cup milk and 

y2 teaspoon lemon extract. Sift together four times 
25^ cups bread flour 
y teaspoon salt 

3 teaspoons baking powder and 

^ teaspoon nutmeg. Combine mixtures. Toss on 
floured cloth, knead slightly, shape, fry in deep 
hot fat and drain on paper. For a richer dough- 
nut add 

2 teaspoons melted butter. 

If this doughnut is too expensive, use a cheaper recipe; 
one extra tgg yolk is a valuable addition to any recipe. The 
whites can be used in frosting, meringues or cake. 

A plain raised doughnut with jelly or jam inside is a good 
seller. 

Doughnuts sell for 40c to $1.00 a dozen. 
■ The cost of doughnuts should be figured per dozen, not 
forgetting to include in the cost the fat absorbed in the 
frying. 

The homemade doughnut is one for which people are 
willing to pay an extra price. Where large quantities of 
doughnuts are made daily, a special equipment for cutting 



COOKING FOR THE FOOD SHOP 43 

the doughnut, putting it in and taking it out of the fat 
is used. When this equipment is located in a store window, 
large numbers of patrons are attracted to buy coffee and 
doughnuts to eat on the spot, or to purchase doughnuts to 
take home. 



CREAM CAKES AND ECLAIRS 

Choux paste is the name given to the mixture from which 
cream cakes and eclairs are made. It is unlike any other 
mixture used in cooker}\ There are many sizes and shapes 
in which choux paste may be formed by means of a pastry 
bag and plain tube. It can be made into regular cream puffs 
and eclairs, into tiny cream puffs one inch in diameter with 
colored frosting that are nice for afternoon teas, into eclairs 
three inches long filled and then dipped in frosting of various 
colors. The tops when frosted can be decorated with nuts 
or with tiny candies. The filling may be a cooked cream 
filling, whipped cream or fruit, forced through a pastry bag 
and plain tube into the cake. They should not look or taste 
like the variety that can be bought in the ordinary bake shop. 
The prices charged range from 5 cents to 10 cents each. 



COOKIES 

You can have a standard formula for cookies, since many 
cookies can be made from approximately the same rule. 
The less milk used the better and richer the cookie. Tie 
them in bundles of i dozen each, with coarse thread, each 
shape by itself. Two cookies with frosting between and on 
top are attractive. Many mothers will buy oatmeal and gin- 
ger cookies for their children. Thick, rich hermits are good 
sellers. 



44 COOKING FOR PROFIT 

Cookies 

Work until creamy 

1 cup butter substitute, and add 

2 cups sugar gradually. 
4 eggs well beaten 

3 cups flour, sifted with 

4 teaspoons baking powder 
I teaspoon salt and 

I teaspoon nutmeg if desired. Add 

4 tablespoons milk and 

3 cups flour and flavoring. 

Put in ice box or in a cool place until thoroughly chilled, when 
mixture should be quite stiff. Take out a small portion at a time, 
on a floured cloth, roll until thin as paper, shape as desired. Place 
on greased tin and bake 8 minutes in a moderate oven. 

Fancy Cookies 

1. Sprinkle mixture generously with cocoanut when 
partially rolled out, finish rolling. 

2. Sprinkle mixture with cinnamon and sugar before 
cutting out. 

3. To ^ the mixture add i cup chopped nut meats, roll 
thm, shape, sprinkle with chopped nuts and bake. 

4. Put a few currants in the center of each cookie before 
baking. 

5. Put I teaspoon caraway seed in %. the mixture before 
chilling. 

6. To 34 mixture add i^ squares melted chocolate be- 
fore chilling. 

7. Use maple sugar instead of plain sugar and sprinkle 
cookies with maple sugar and chopped pecan nut meats. 

8. Flavor cookies with grated orange rind. 

9. To %. mixture add i cup chopped candied ginger. 

10. Shape cookie mixture with heart, diamond, club and 
spade cutters. When baked spread hearts and diamonds 
with frosting colored red, and clubs and spades with melted 
sweet chocolate. 



COOKING FOR THE FOOD SHOP 45 

11. Decorate frosted cookies with leaves and stem of 
green citron, and flowers made of candied caraway seeds. 

12. Cut cookie mixture in circles. On one-half the 
pieces put i teaspoon of raisin or conserve filling, cover 
with another cookie and press together. 

PASTRY 

Pastries of all kinds are very good for consigning. The 
pastry for pies should be a good plain paste, not a puff 
paste, except for the upper crust of mince pies. For shorten- 
ing use all lard, or lard and butter, or substitute for either. 
The formula must be standardized and then followed. Be 
Sure to Measure Accurately. Standardize by weight the 
amount of crust that is used for the lining of the pie plate 
and for the upper crust, so that the crust will always be of 
uniform thickness. When baking pies have a hot oven at 
first to cook under crust and prevent escape of juice. 

Quick Plain Paste 
Put 
I cup lard in a chilled bowl, work until creamy, using a wooden 

spoon. Add 
Yz cup ice water 
3 cups pastry flour and 
I teaspoon salt and mix by cutting with a knife. 

Bind a strip of wet cheesecloth around juicy pies to keep juice 
from coming out. 

Selling Price of Pies 

The price of 65c for an apple pie and 70c for most of 
the others is the ordinary charge. Mince pie is more ex- 
pensive and may have a puff paste upper crust. Individual 
pies or tartlets can be easily sold in some localities. 

Apple, mince, raspberry, pineapple, lemon and banbury 
tarts sell for from 72c to $1.08 a dozen, or from 6c to 9c each. 
They should be made of a more flaky pastry than pies, and 
may be made of puff paste if desired. They should be 



46 COOKING FOR PROFIT 

Standardized as to size and the amount of filling used in 
each. 

Puff Paste 

Puff paste patty shells, and vol au vents, which are large 
patties, can be made to order. Puff paste requires experi- 
ence in making, dexterity in handling, rapid manipulation, 
ice for chilling and an oven that can be easily regulated. 

First class puff paste must be made of real butter. 

Puff Paste Recipe 

2 cups butter, wash, and pat and shape in circular shape. 
Reserve two tablespoons and put remainder between two 
pans of ice. Work the reserved butter into 

3 cups bread flour, mix to a dough with 

1% cups ice water, knead 5 minutes, cover and let stand for 
5 minutes. Pat and roll J4 inch thick with square corners. 
Place butter in center of one side of the pastry, fold other 
side over butter pressing edges firmly together. Fold one 
end over butter, other end under butter, pressing edges 
together. Turn % way round, pat with rolling pin, lift, roll, 
fold in 3 layers and turn one- fourth way round. Repeat 
four times, chilling when necessary between pans of ice 
and folding the last time in 4 layers. Chill, roll out, shape, 
chill again and bake in hot oven, reducing heat after pastry 
has risen. 

FRENCH PASTRIES 

Among the novelties that can be made from puff paste 
are the following: — 

Marshmallow Tarts. Line small patty pan with pastry, 
then with wax paper, fill with raw rice or beans, bake, 
remove rice, put in layer of jam, fill with stiff marsh- 
mallow cream, and cover with confectioners' frosting 
flavored with lemon and colored yellow. 

Marlowe Tarts. Prepare cases as for Marshmallow Tarts 
and cut covers to fit. Bake, fill with fruit, put on cover, 
frost, and decorate with green cocoanut in narrow border 
around the top.

Apricot Tarts. Line a 2-inch round shallow tin with pastry, 
fill with marmalade, cover with lady finger mixture, 
sprinkle with chopped almonds and bake. 

Apple Boats. Cover small boat-shaped tins with pastry, 
prick and bake. Remove pastry. Fill with apple sauce, 
decorate with sections of apple, half of them cooked in 
plain and half cooked in syrup colored red. 

FiLENE Tarts. Bake 2 pieces pastry 3 inches long and ij^

tioners' frosting and sprinkle ends with chopped nuts. 

Petite Gateau. Cut pastry 2 inches in diameter. Put 
border of choux paste around edge, bake, fill centre with 
jam, and garnish with whipped cream and glace fruit. 

Marmalade Baskets. Cut oval pieces of puflf paste, score 
the top one-third inch from edge and bake. Cut strips 
of paste for handles and bake separately over a stiff piece 
of paper, the diameter of the paper roll being the same as 
the width of the oval. Remove centers from baskets and 
fill with orange marmalade mixed with ^ the amount of 
blanched and shredded almonds. Insert handles, decorate 
with whipped cream sweetened and flavored with very 
strong coffee and shredded almonds slightly browned. 

Cream Horns. Roll pastry y% inch thick, cut in strips ^

sprinkle ^ surface with powdered sugar, fold, press edges 
together, pat and roll out, using sugar for dredging board ; 
repeat 3 times. After the last rolling fold 4 times. The

the end cut pieces i inch wide; place on baking sheet, cut 
side down, i inch apart, and separate layers of pastry at 
one end to suggest a leaf. Bake 8 minutes in hot oven; 
these will spread while baking. 

Turnovers. Roll pastry ^ inch thick, and put in pieces 
6 inches long and 3 inches wide with round ends. Lay on 
tin sheet, make a i-inch cut one inch from each end, put 
jam or cooked fruit in the centre, bring one end of pastry 
through hole in other end, press edges together and bake. 

QUANTITIES THAT PAY 

Of different foods, different amounts will have to be 
made by a consignor to cover cost of overhead, cost of 
material used and value of time consumed. 

Take, for example, Mock Cherry Pies.

$2,122 



The recipe costs about $2.12 and makes 8 pies. 

This makes 26c as the cost of i pie to which must be 
added 6c as the cost of box, paper, plate and string, 32c 
as the total cost of each pie to the maker. 

Selling price of each pie, if the cost is doubled, 64c. 

Allowance per pie for overhead and labor, 32c. 

Overhead costs, are, say $1.60 per day, if you hire no 
help. 

Dividing $1.60 by 32c, the cost of i pie, shows that 5 
pies would cover the cost of overhead for i day. 



COOKING FOR THE FOOD SHOP 49 

In order to make $3.20 clear (8 hours at 40c an hour), 
to pay for your labor, woul^l take 10 pies more ; that means 
a total of 15 pies a day. 

How long does it take to make i pie? 

Could you dispose of 15 pies a day? 

Then it might be worth while to work up a business in 
pies, making different kinds according to the season of the 
year. 

If you are operating a food shop yourself, the rent, light, 
heat, depreciation, labor, advertising, etc., must be considered 
as your overhead, as explained in Lesson i. 

In your own home, with the simplest equipment, the daily 
expenses may be no more than $2.00 a day. 

Perhaps you plan to specialize in doughnuts. They will 
cost about 21 cents a dozen; box and string 6 cents more, 
which makes 2^ cents the cost. Selling price $0.60 sold direct 
to customer. Cost, 27 cents ; 33 cents margin. 

If you make 33c on each dozen it will take 6 dozen to 
pay your overhead expenses of $2.00 per day. 

If your labor for 8 hours is worth $3.20, it will take 10 
dozen to pay for your labor. 

This makes a total of 16 dozen for the day. 

Or, if you are selling doughnuts for a consignor, you may 
get I2C for each dozen you sell. Then with overhead and 
labor at $5.20, dividing by 12 gives 43% dozen which must 
be sold daily. If that is not feasible, add other consigned 
articles to your list, until you are selling enough to pay 
you for your time and trouble. 

CHANGING SMALL RECIPES TO LARGE ONES 

In making some kinds of foods for a food shop, just as 
good results can be secured by making a large quantity as 
by making a small quantity. 



50 COOKING FOR PROFIT 

Experiment with your equipment and your strength, mak- 
ing a little more each time, until you discover how much 
you can make at once without becoming overtired, or chang- 
ing the quality of your product. 

Increase the proport;ions of each thing, writing down the 
amounts on paper and verifying your multiplications to be 
sure they are correct before beginning to cook.

THERE is undoubtedly a market for cake in almost any 
community of moderate size. Many women have not 
the time or do not know how to bake cake them- 
selves, and are only too glad to purchase a superior article 
regularly or when they entertain. 

You might in the beginning make cakes to order for your 
friends and their friends. At first there may be only 3 or 4 
orders a week. Before long orders may come for cakes for 
receptions, lodge suppers, afternoon teas and parties ; orders 
which are large enough to require more than a day for their 
preparation. Perhaps this may lead to the establishment of 
an attractive cake shop on the best street of a large city, or 
to a real catering business where all the other dishes required 
for a party are provided in addition to the cakes. 

No one should expect to make cakes that are good enough 
to sell at a profit unless she has had some previous experience 
and success in making cakes. 

55 



56 COOKING FOR PROFIT 

A cake to be called successful should have these charac- 
teristics : 

1. Light when handled, except dark fruit cake. 

2. Light brown crust on all sides, showing that cake is 

neither under-baked nor over-baked. 

3. Even surface, no cracks or humps. 

4. Fine grain. 

5. Smooth velvety texture. 

6. If frosted, frosting that is attractive in appearance and 

that does not crack or stick when cut. 

Selling Cake 

Each specialty shop and home cake maker has her own 
names and variations in the style of cakes for sale, and in 
the flavor and character of the filling, frosting and decora- 
tions. 

Perfect your own specialty; the kind of cake that your 
patrons like because it is especially good and different, and 
give it an attractive name in addition to its class name, as 
pound, sponge, white, et cetera. 

In the beginning you will probably make your cakes in 
the ordinary family quantity. As your orders increase you 
can increase your quantities until you are mixing perhaps 
enough for 5 loaves at a time. 

With an electric mixer you may be able to make 20 loaves 
at once, or 40 layers. 

Standardize the size of your pans. Always use the same 
pans for the same kind of cake, unless you have orders for 
a special size. 

Individual cakes, muffin pan size, smaller cakes for after- 
noon teas, loaf and layer cakes, all are popular. 

Cakes may be sold through a food shop, a store, to a lunch 
room or directly to your customers. 



CAKES AND CAKE MAKING 57 

A card in the local paper should secure orders in a com- 
munity where much entertaining is done. 

A dainty folder listing the kinds of cakes you will make 
to order could be mailed to such people as you think would 
be interested. 

A neighborhood of high class apartment houses is a good 
field in which to start a business in cake making or other 
cooked food project. 

Quality should be your first consideration, and patrons 
will be found among people of discriminating taste, who 
have money to gratify their taste. 

After your business is started take note of customers* 
tastes, and cater to them. Some cakes will sell well, and 
others will not sell even in different sections of the same 
city. Keep watch of the sales. 

Never sell a stale cake or one that is not up to your 
standard. 

How Many Cakes Ahead 

Cakes will keep better without frosting than with it. If 
you have a large cake shop, keep about 3 dozen individual 
cakes and 2 loaf cakes a day ahead of your orders. Maca- 
roons will probably all be sold every day. 

Use for Stale Cakes 

Cakes may be sold at cost at the end of the second day, or 
stale cake, crumbs and ends of cake that result from cut- 
ting cake in fancy shapes, may be rubbed through a coarse 
sieve, or when dry, run through the food chopper. Such 
crumbs may be substituted for half the flour in hermits, 
spice cakes and Boston brown bread. 

Profit on Cakes 

The most common way of charging for cakes, if they are 
to be sold, is to estimate the cost of materials and double it. 



58 



COOKING FOR PROFIT 



If elaborately decorated, an extra charge should be made 
proportionate to the time consumed in decorating. If orig- 
inal designs are worked out the price should be proportion- 
ately graded. 

The cake shop may add an extra charge of 30% to cover 
cost of selling. This 30% you may add to double the cost 
of your materials to make your price, when you sell direct 
to the consumer. 

Cake when cut and sold in a lunch or tea room must be 
priced higher than by the loaf. 

Cake Prices 

The following list of cakes, popular in a high-class food 
shop, may help you to choose your specialty in this line. 

The small cakes are sold at from 60 cents to $1.44 per 
dozen. The loaf cakes, which vary in size from 8 by 4 
inches to 9 inches square or 9 inches in diameter, sell for 
from 50 cents to $1.75 each, according to the size and the 
variety. 

Rich dark fruit cake brings from %i.oo to $1.90 a pound. 

Small decorated cakes sell for from $1.50 a dozen up, and 
large decorated cakes up to $10.00 or more each.

Measurements and Ingredients 

Be very careful and accurate in all your measurements. 

In all our recipes measurements are level. 

A good margarine may be used in place of butter. For 
white cakes it need not be colored. It may be colored for 
yellow and dark cakes. Fewer or smaller cakes result from 
a mixture made with margarine in place of butter, and 
you may find butter more economical to use in spite of the 
difference in cost. 

Fine granulated sugar should be used unless the recipe 
specifies some other kind. 

Frozen ^gg whites and yolks may be used if the contents 
of a container can all be used in one day. They come in lo, 
20 and 30 pound tubs. Where recipes are increased several 
times, the difference in the amount of egg used, if they are 
very large or very small, will be considerable. Break the 
required number of average sized fresh eggs, measure them 
and write the amount in your recipe. Then measure eggs 
thereafter instead of counting them. 

Powdered milk dissolved in water may be used in place 
of fresh milk. It is convenient as it can always be on hand. 

Use the best pastry flour, sifted once before measuring. 

Use a high class baking powder and the kind with which 
you secure the best results. Some people prefer soda and 
cream of tartar in cake. You may use ^ as much cream 
of tartar as the amount of baking powder called for and % 
as much soda as cream of tartar if you wish. It is wise to 
use salt in all cake recipes. 

Use good flavorings. The price you charge for your cake 
should cover any difference in cost between good and poor 
extracts. 



CAKES AND CAKE MAKING 61 

Mixing Cake 

Follow directions carefully. 

With an electric cake mixer, the ingredients can be put in 
one at a time, and it is not necessary to beat the eggs sep- 
arately. Baking powder and beaten egg whites should be 
beaten or folded in by hand after other ingredients are com- 
bined by the machine. 

Add flavoring with the milk, then if whites of eggs or 
flour have to be folded in, no further mixing is necessary to 
thoroughly incorporate the extract. 

It is a safe precaution always to line your cake pans with 
paper, then grease paper and sides of pan, using a rubber 
set pastry brush and cooking oil. 

Use a spatula for cleaning your mixing bowls. Do not 
waste cake or frosting material. 

When cake mixture is put in pan, spread it a little higher 
on the sides than in the middle, so that it will rise evenly. 

Small Cakes 

Small cakes may be baked in muflin pans of different 
sizes, or may be cut from a thin sheet of fine grained rich 
cake, like the pound cake given below. 

Avoid waste in cutting cakes, and use the crumbs in mak- 
ing an inexpensive crumb cake or hermits. 

Paper cases can be purchased to use in muffin pans for 
small cakes. They should be sold in the paper, which can be 
pulled ofif when cakes are served. 

Baking Cake 

If you use an oven with a reliable thermometer, learn at 
what temperature your cakes bake best and always main- 
tain it. 



62 COOKING FOR PROFIT 

If you have a gas or electric range and no thermometer, 
you can purchase a chemical thermometer for about $5.00. 
Insert it in a large cork, which will hold the thermometer 
upright. Have a hole made in the center of the top of 
the oven of the correct size to fit the cork. The thermometer 
can be easily read on the outside and your temperature main- 
tained evenly and exactly. 

Experiment with you cakes and your thermometer until 
you learn the temperature at which you secure the best re- 
sults, then you need never fear failure in your baking. You 
will find the temperature varies with different kinds of cake. 
For most cakes the thermometer should register between 
300 and 400 degrees. 

Without a thermometer excellent results can be secured 
by lighting both burners of a gas oven for ten mintues, put- 
ting in the cake and turning off all the heat for five minutes 
with small cakes and ten minutes with large cakes. Then 
turn on one or both burners part way and regulate as neces- 
sary. 

With coal or wood ovens have a good fire when the cake 
goes in, and increase heat slightly after cake has risen. 

The time required for baking may be divided into quar- 
ters: during the first quarter the mixture should begin to 
rise ; during the second quarter it should continue rising and 
begin to brown; during the third quarter it should continue 
browning ; during the fourth quarter it should finish baking 
and shrink from pan. 

When cake is correctly baked, it should shrink from sides 
of pan, should be of an even brown color, there should be 
no sound of bubbling when held close to the ear, and a tooth- 
pick inserted in the centre should come out clean. 

When finished turn out the cake on a wire cake cooler that 
there may be a free circulation of air on all sides of the cake 
while it is cooling. 



CAKES AND CAKE MAKING 63 

Shapes for Little Cakes (Petit Fours) 

When a sheet of cake is cool it may be cut in the following 
shapes, using a sharp knife or a cookie cutter : 
Square — i^ to 2 inches square. 
Rectangular — 2 inches by i inch. 
Oval — 2 inches long. 
Circle — i to 3 inches in diameter. 
Triangle — 2 inches by i^ inches by 1J/2 inches. 
Diamond — i^ inches on each side. 
Cutlet — 2 inches long. 

Fillings and Frostings 

Cakes may be split, and a jelly, nut or frosting filling put 
in between. They may be covered with frosting on top only, 
or the sides may be covered as well. 

Cake Decoration 

Cakes are decorated for special occasions and holidays. 

Decorations may be of frosting, plain or colored, forced 
through pastry bags of cloth or paper. 

For wedding and bride cakes, white frosting is best. For 
birthday cakes and cakes for holidays and other special oc- 
casions, colored decorations on a white background may be 
used effectively. 

A cloth bag with metal tubes, the ends cut in many differ- 
ent ways, may be purchased of a dealer in kitchen furnish- 
ings. These are best when white frosting is used. 

Paper tubes may be quickly made from a sheet of firm 
letter paper 11 by 8^ inches. Cut from corner to corner 
into two triangular pieces and form each into a cornucopia by 
holding by the two sharp ends. Turn in the edges to hold 
the funnel. The point of the funnel is then clipped to leave 



64 COOKING FOR PROFIT 

a small round opening of desired size for dots, lines and 
writing. 

For leaves, press the point of the paper funnel flat, clip off 
one-fourth inch from the end, clip off the corners, making a 
V point, and make a slit one-eighth inch long in the point 
of the V. For large leaves and petals clip more from the 
end. 

For some flower petals, flatten and clip off the point of 
the funnel as before and cut two notches in the end, making 
the shape of the letter M or W. 

Paper tubes are especially satisfactory when several dif- 
ferent colors are being used. 

Color pastes or liquid colors that are certified by the 
Federal Government should be used, and all colors should 
be light and delicate. 

*'Half fill a paper funnel with frosting, bring edges of open 
end together, and fold over twice, that frosting may not come 
out at the top. Hold the funnel in the right hand with the 
little finger toward the point of the tube and the thumb and 
forefinger closed tightly above the frosting. Force the frost- 
ing gently through the hole in the end of the tube by squeez- 
ing with the right hand and guiding with the left hand. Allow 
the tube point to rest lightly on the surface to be decorated. 
Conventional designs may be attempted at first, and soon it 
will be possible to make flowers and leaves. Do not use a 
tube after it has become soft and out of shape at the point." 
— From Candy Cook Book, by Alice Bradley. 

Flowers, leaves and stems may be effectively used for 
cakes, especially the following. If possible copy from the 
fresh flowers or from good colored pictures. 

Wild roses 
Rose buds 
Chrysanthemums 
Forget-me-nots 
Brown-eyed Susans

Jonquils 

Bachelor buttons 

Violets, yellow and purple 

White wild roses with silver dragees in the centre 

Lilies of the valley 

Sweet peas 

Holly 

Poinsettias 

Butterflies 

Colored frosting is generally used for the above flowers, 
but almond paste, tiny colored candies, angelica, citron, can- 
died fruits and nuts are also effective. 

Designs can be beautifully painted with a fine brush and 
color paste on smooth white frosting. 

Frostings 

For ornamental frosting decorations you can use 
Boiled frosting 

Uncooked ornamental frosting 
Butter or mocha frosting 
Japanese frosting 

Other Decorations 

These may be used in regular or fancy designs on large or 
small cakes: 
Nuts 

Almonds, blanched and cut 

Walnuts, whole or cut in pieces 

Pecans, whole or cut in pieces 

Pistachio nuts, blanched and sliced or chopped 
Cocoanut, plain or colored. 
Candied cherries, pineapple or plums cut in small 

pieces 
Angelica 
Citron

Candies 

Candied caraway seeds 
Small red cinnamon drops 
Marshmallows, whole or cut in strips 

Almond paste colored and shaped 

Delivering Cakes 

Deliver your cakes in firm folding boxes, made to order 
if necessary, of a size to just hold the cake without crushing. 

For decorated cakes the box should be large enough to 
allow for cut or crushed tissue paper between the box and 
the cake. 

For sending fruit cakes by mail, provide tin boxes just 
the size of the pan in which the cake is baked.

FROSTINGS 

The favorite frosting on loaf and layer cakes is a boiled 
frosting, light and fluffy, beaten by hand or an electric mixer. 
This may be piled irregularly on top of the cakes. 

Sometimes it is smoothed and covered with a thin layer of 
melted bitter chocolate, or with boiled chocolate frosting, or 
it is decorated in the different ways already mentioned. 

Different cakes which are covered with the same frosting 
may be distinguished by a different kind of scroll on the 
frosting, made with the handle of a knife as soon as frosting 
is put on the cake.

CANDY MAKING 

OPPORTUNITY FOR HOME CANDY MAKING; EQUIPMENT; PUR- 
CHASING supplies; profit; using the scraps; packing for 
delivery; best sellers; fudges; fondant and its uses; 
caramels; peanut brittle; Turkish paste; butterscotch; 
chocolates; favors; nuts. 

THE consumption of candy in the United States has 
increased greatly in the past few years. The most 
conservative estimate places it at 13 pounds per 
person for the year at an average cost of 75c a pound. More 
candy is purchased in the winter than in the summer. In the 
hope of getting part of the profits on such a business, many 
women have started to make candy in their own homes, and 
have quickly built up a business as large as they could handle. 
One woman, after eight years, is supplying candy to 120 
retail stores, and at Easter sold 30,000 Easter eggs. Another 
woman, one Christmas, refused orders for 4,000 pounds of 
candy. A woman whose husband takes care of the sales, 
chiefly to workers in offices and in banks, has been able to 
purchase a seven-passenger car to use in deliveries. 

Equipment 

The equipment required in the beginning is not expensive. 

The following articles will be found sufficient at first : 

A good reliable thermometer, at least 12 inches long and 

one that registers up to 420 degrees Fahrenheit. This 

costs about $2.50. A smaller one may be used, but is 

harder to read. 

75 



76 . COOKING FOR PROFIT 

A set of scales 

Measuring cups and quart measure 

Spatula, 23^ inches wide and 6 inches long 

For large batches, spade 7 inches wide with handle 
2>^ feet long 

Case knife 

A long sharp knife 

Wooden spoon 

Tablespoons 

Teaspoons 

Saucepans of agate, aluminum or copper with straight 
sides and smooth bottom 

Double boiler 

Caramel pans, 10x13 inches square 

Mint dropper 

Bonbon dippers may be purchased or fashioned at home 
from a piece of No. 14 wire. They should be 6 inches 
long and the open bowl of dipper ^ of an inch across 

Iron bars are convenient to have and may be bought at 
a blacksmith's shop at so much a pound. They should 
be ^ of an inch square and as long as your table is 
wide. The opening between may be made of any 
size, and candy may thus be' cooled on the table with- 
out the use of a pan 

A large marble slab or table, a porceliron table or a zinc 
table are desirable to have, but a large enamel tray, 
or a large platter will be sufficient to start with, and 
as the business grows you can get what you need. Do 
not stock up with unnecessary equipment. 
As your business grows you will probably need 

Molds of plaster to make impression in starch, for shap- 
ing centres of chocolates 

Starch trays, 2 feet square 

Batch warmer, for pulled candies. 



CANDY MAKING 77 

The Thermometer 

When using the thermometer be sure each time to place it 
in a saucepan of water and bring to the boiHng point to 
see if it registers 212 degrees F. when the water boils. 

If your thermometers register 210 (iegrees F. at boiling 
point, your candy has to be cooked 2 degrees less than the 
degree given in your recipe. If the boiling point registers 
higher than 212 degrees cook your candy to a higher tem- 
perature. If tested each time there is no danger of spoiling 
your batch of candy. 

Be sure that the size of the pan is adapted to the amount 
of candy that is to be cooked, and that the bulb of the ther- 
mometer is covered by the mixture in the saucepan, other- 
wise you will not get a correct registration. 

When cooking in an aluminum saucepan, remove it from 
the fire when the thermometer registers 2 degrees below the 
temperature to which the candy is to be cooked, as aluminum 
holds the heat and candy will finish cooking after being taken 
from the stove. Remove thermometer when candy is fin- 
ished and place in boiling water. When not using keep hung 
up to prevent breakage. 

Where and What to Buy 

Get in touch with a reliable dealer in confectioners' sup- 
plies. There are several in every large city. They can fur- 
nish special articles of equipment, flavoring oils, colors, 
coating chocolate, nuts, almond paste, glucose and other sup- 
plies, and the special kinds of paper, as rice paper, chocolate 
dipping paper, and wax paper. One woman usually has 
a standing order for 600 pounds of coating chocolate weekly \ 

Buy sugar by the hundred-pound bag" or by the barrel, 
which holds between 300 and 400 pounds. 



78 COOKING FOR PROFIT 

Buy corn syrup in No. lo cans, by the case, or use glucose, 
which comes in small barrels or tubs. Use ^ -pound glucose, 
to replace i cup corn syrup called for in our recipes. It is 
usually removed from the container with the hand which 
is first dipped in cold water. Before taking out the glucose, 
place on your scales the saucepan that you are to use and 
note the weight. Then add the glucose, weighing kettle, 
glucose and all. The difference in weight indicates the 
amount of glucose added, and should be the same as the 
amount called for in the recipe, or as suggested above, J^ 
pound for each cup called for. This is added to give to 
candies the proper texture, and keep them from becoming 
*'grainy." White corn syrup is best. 

Purchase oils for flavoring. They come in i -pound con- 
tainers. Only a few drops are required for i pound of 
fondant or other candy. 

Buy vanilla by the quart or gallon. Use a first quality 
vanilla, not vanillin, in high-class candies. 

Nuts may be purchased out of the shell. Sometimes, how- 
ever, the shelled nuts are of inferior grade, and it may be 
wiser to purchase nuts in the shell, and shell them yourself. 

Profit in Candy Making 

Estimate the approximate cost of making the mixture 
which you plan to sell, the length of time required to make 
and pack the candies, the cost of paper, individual paper cups 
for holding bonbons and chocolates if you use them, and the 
cost of the candy boxes. When you estimate the cost of 
your time, materials and boxes, you will find there is a 
good profit in candy making. Sixty to ninety pounds of 
fudge a day can be made by one woman and a strong assist- 
ant. 

Many women are able to get from 85c to $1.50 for almost 
every pound of candy they make. 



CANDY MAKING 79 

The following figures will serve as an example of the profit 
on seventy pounds: 

FUDGE 

Unit Total 

To Make i lb. To Make 70 lbs. Cost Cost 

Margarine, i tablespoon 6oT=i^ lb $0.28 lb. $0.53 

Sugar, 2 cups (i lb.) I2oc=6o lb 08 lb. 4.80

Packing, i day 2.00 4.00 



Cost $0.22 lb. $18.50 

Selling price 85 lb. 59.50 

Difference 63 41.00 

When 70 pounds of fudge a day are made and sold for 85c 
a pound at an apparent profit of $41.00, it looks like a lot 
of money. If two people spend all one day making it, and 
another day packing, and someone else is spending two days 
taking orders and delivering the candy, the $41.00 divided 
by 6 days' work means $6.83 per day per person, and a good 
wage. 

If all your candy is sold to dealers to be resold, the $10.00 
which we have here figured for taking orders and delivering 
the fudge may be their profit: that is, they can pay you 
67^^ cents, or maybe 65 cents a pound and make a profit of 
25% to 30% selling it at 85 cents, leaving you a profit of 
about 50%. 

Other candies can be figured in the same way, and one 
should know just how one stands financially every day, or at 
least every week. 

Some home candy makers work three days a week making 
candy, and spend the remainder of the week packing it in 
boxes. Others keep assistants busy most of the time cutting 
up and packing for market. 



80 COOKING FOR PROFIT 

With sufficient room and equipment, and a force consist- 
ing of the woman in charge, who makes some of the can- 
dies, two other candy makers, two chocolate dippers, two 
packers, and a man who comes when needed to pack and nail 
up the wooden cases, from 700 pounds to 1,000 pounds a 
week of high-class homemade candies can be turned out. 

Chocolates can be made up ahead; other candies are best 
when freshly made. 

Using the Scraps 

Broken pieces of candy, crumbly fudges, trimmed off edges 
of candy, and scraps of all kinds should be saved in a sort of 
"stock kettle." When a sufficient amount accumulates, weigh 
it. For each pound add ^ cup milk or water and two ounces 
of chocolate, or less, according to the amount of chocolate in 
the scrap. Cook and finish like fudge. Sell at a reasonable 
price under a particular name as Belgian Fudge. 

Waste nothing — material, paper, string, boxes or time — 
and you will surely be able to clear a good profit on home- 
made candy. 

Packing and Delivery 

Boxes can be purchased from 2^ cents up. If you have 
an office trade, the cheap box is acceptable because as soon as 
emptied it goes into the waste basket. You will need better 
boxes for the home trade. These will cost from 5 cents 
to 10 cents each for the half-pound size, and from 8 cents 
to 12 cents for the pound size. Experiment with sizes 
until you have those just large enough to hold one-half or 
one pound of your own kinds of candy, then have the 
boxes made to order with your special name and trade-mark 
on the cover. 

One woman who has built up a very large business has 
always used simple, inexpensive boxes, preferring to put her 



CANDY MAKING 81 

money into first-class material instead of into fancy paper, 
ribbon and cardboard. 

Unique arrangements for packing, such as decorated tin 
boxes, boxes representing bales of cotton, and other unusual 
styles, have proved profitable to some makers. 

Paraffin paper should be used to line each candy box, and 
may be used to wrap the boxes. A paper seal may fasten 
the wrapper. 

For Christmas trade a red ribbon may be tied around the 
box under the paper. 

Boxes must be wrapped again in plain white paper for 
delivery. 

For mailing, the box should be wrapped again in corru- 
gated paper and then in strong wrapping paper, and firmly 
tied with string. Make every effort to protect the candy from 
being broken when received. 

Where many boxes go to one address they are packed in 
wooden cases and shipped by express. 

Paraffin Paper 

Paraffin paper comes in several different weights and sizes. 
It can be cut to order to fit candy boxes, and to wrap cara- 
mels, lollypops, etc. It is sold by the ream or by the pack- 
age, usually by the concern from which you get your candy 
boxes. 

Buy the quality and size that you can use without waste. 

Marketing Your Candy 

Market your things neatly and attractively and be sure 
your profit is right from the start, so that you will not have 
to raise the price. 

You will find you will have no trouble to market your 
goods if quality is your watchword. 



82 COOKING FOR PROFIT 

If your business grows so fast that you have to have 
assistants to help you fill your orders, get people who will 
do the work just as you have done it; that is, do not allow 
your candy to deteriorate in the slightest degree because you 
are not doing it all yourself. 

The motto of the efficient business person, whether man 
or woman, is "Do not do anything that you can get some- 
body else to do." There is more money in the management 
of a number of people than in doing everything yourself, 
but you must be very careful that your quality does not 
suffer in any way as your trade increases. 

Best Sellers 

There are many kinds of candy that should not be at- 
tempted by the inexperienced candy maker, but the follow- 
ing are made successfully in the home : 

Assorted chocolates 

Assorted fudges 

Cream mints 

Cream caramels 

Bonbons 

Peanut brittle 

Corn balls 

Butterscotch in different forms 

Stuifed dried fruits 

Salted nuts 

Glace nuts and fruits 

One woman who is making a great success of the candy 
business tells in these words what kinds of candies people 
like best. 

"Men's taste is quite different from that of women. Men 
do not care so much for the rich, creamy candies which 



CANDY MAKING 83 

women prefer. They like something with more 'body' to it ; 
something they can really chew on. They are fond of choco- 
late, but they want the center to be nuts, or nougat, or cara- 
mels, or molasses. And they like something that has salt 
in it.'' 

Enlarging the Recipe 

Great care must be taken not to enlarge a recipe too much, 
as often the quality of a large batch of candy is not as good 
as of a smaller one, and it is more difficult to handle. 

When wholesalers wish to put out a new candy, and sam- 
ples are to be sent out, a small batch is made, and by hand 
rather than by machinery. 

Always boil to the same degree on the thermometer, 
whether the batch be large or small. 

FUDGE AND FONDANT 

Fudges of different kinds are easily made, and when soft, 
fine grained and creamy, are good sellers. A good standard 
recipe is Chocolate Fudge, given below. For the trade, the 
recipe may be increased up to about lo pounds in a batch. 
More than this is too much to be worked by hand. 

Sour cream instead of milk makes a particularly good 
fudge. 

Part water and part condensed milk may be used for 
fudge. 

Fudges should be worked like fondants. They should be 
cooled before being worked in order to secure a rich, creamy 
consistency. If fudge becomes too hard to work easily a 
damp cloth may be laid over it for a few minutes to soften it. 

Fudge may be put into a stone crock the same as fondant, 
after being worked until creamy, and can be softened over 
hot water, then molded and cut as orders come in. 



81 COOKING FOR PROFIT 

Shape fudge between candy bars which have been placed 
upon a wooden table lined with heavy wax paper. Fudge 
cooled upon marble or in tin cools more quickly on the top 
and bottom than in the center, and when it is cut it is apt 
to crumble. 

To cut fudge use a strip of wood with straight even edges 
cut just the width you wish to have your fudge squares, say 
i^ inches wide. Lay the wood with the edge parallel with 
the edge of the fudge and cut fudge beside the ruler with a 
sharp knife. 

When fudge is made in large quantities glucose is often 
added, but this is not desirable, as it may give your fudge a 
chewy rather than a creamy consistency. 

Do not try to make divinity fudges and nougatines without 
an electric beater, as too much time is required for beating, 
and dampness affects the white of Qgg so that it takes a long 
time for the mixture to dry out. 

Chocolate Fudge 

Melt 

1 tablespoon butter and 

2 squares chocolate over hot water, add 
2 cups sugar and 

^ cup milk and stir gently until sugar is dissolved; then bring 
to boiling point on the fire and boil without stirring to 234 
degrees Fahrenheit, or until it will form a soft ball when tried 
in cold water. Remove candy from fire, pour on damp marble 
slab, let stand undisturbed until cool, add 

I teaspoon vanilla or 

J4 teaspoon cinnamon and work with a spatula until candy begins 
to get sugary. Turn immediately into a buttered pan, or be- 
tween bars, and mark in squares with a knife. The pan or 
space should be about 7 inches square, so that the fudge will 
be ^ of an inch thick when cut. 

Popular Fudge Combinations 

Opera fudges, especially with cherries and nuts 
Chocolate fudge, plain and with nuts 
Marshmallow fudge 
Maple fudge, with and without nuts 



CANDY MAKING 85 

Opera Fudge 

Put in saucepan 

2 cups sugar, add 

I cup heavy cream, stir back and forth until it boils, add 

14 teaspoon cream of tartar and boil to 238 degrees Fahrenheit, 
stirring frequently and moving thermometer about to prevent 
burning. Finish like Chocolate Fudge. When it becomes 
creamy cover with a damp cloth for half an hour, then add 

J^ teaspoon vanilla or other flavoring and color if desired, v^rorking 
it in well with the hands. Press into shape and when firm 
cut into squares. This may be used for centers for chocolates 
and for centers and coating of bonbons. 

This is a rich soft fudge made with heavy cream instead 
of milk. It may be colored and flavored in various ways. 
This is the candy on which one young woman built up a 
candy business that has been successful for many years. 

Opera fudge may be cut like other fudge or used as 
fondant is used. 

Opera Fudge Variations 

Color pink, flavor with raspberry, add if desired l4 cup blanched 

almonds cut in pieces, or shredded cocoanut 
Color green, flavor with almond and vanilla, and add if desired % 

cup pistachio nuts cut in pieces 
Color pale violet and flavor with violet 
Color pale yellow and flavor with lemon 
Color orange and flavor with orange 
Add 3 tablespoons candied cherries cut in pieces, 3 tablespoons 

citron cut in pieces and flavor with maraschino 
Add 12 marshmallows cut in pieces, flavor with 4 teaspoons orange 

flower water 
Add chopped almonds, flavor with almond 
Add chopped candied pineapple, flavor with pineapple 
Add chopped candied plums, flavor with lemon 
Add chopped candied ginger 
Add melted chocolate with or without chopped nuts 

White Fondant 

Put 

5 cups sugar and 

1% cups water in smooth saucepan, place on range, and stir con- 
stantly until boiling point is reached. With a damp cloth or 
pastry brush dipped in cold water, wash down the sides of 
the saucepan until every grain of sugar is removed. Add 

l4 teaspoon cream of tartar, cover saucepan, and allow candy to 
steam for three minutes. Remove cover, put in thermometer. 



86 COOKING FOR PROFIT 

and tx)il rapidly until candy forms a soft ball when tried in 
cold water, or until thermometer registers 238 degrees F. 

While syrup is cooking wipe marble slab or agate tray with a 
damp cloth. When syrup is ready, pour gently on the slab. 
Do not allow the last of it to drip out over what has been 
poured on the slab, and never scrape out the kettle on the first 
mixture. Do not disturb the syrup in any way until it is cold. 

Then with a broad spatula scrape and turn the syrup toward the 
center, and continue turning it over and over, working from 
the edges of the mass. Each time that the syrup is turned 
over, scrape clean and turn the spatula up and over the mass, 
occasionally scraping mixture from the spatula with a case 
knife. It will soon become white and creamy. 

Knead with the hands until perfectly smooth, cover with a cloth 
wrung out of cold water, and leave for half an hour. 

Cut in pieces and put into a stone jar and cover with a wet cloth 
and a cover. It is better to let it remain two or three days 
before using, and it may be kept for months in a dry cool place. 

This fondant may be used for centers of bonbons and chocolates 
for outside coatings of bonbons or for mints. 

Experiment first with the recipe for White Fondant given 
above. Four times this recipe or 10 pounds of sugar may 
be used for a batch after some experience. One-half tea- 
spoon glycerine is sometimes added to fondant to give a fine 
gloss for coating bonbons. 

One-third cup corn syrup put in before cooking, or i 
egg white beaten stiff and added when syrup is cold, are 
often used in fondant for centers. 



Cream Mints 

These are easily made from fondant, and are very satisfac- 
tory. 

Put plain fondant in upper part of double boiler, and melt 
over hot water, stirring constantly after fondant begins to 
soften. Thin with a few drops of cold water or simple 
syrup if necessary. Flavor with a few drops of any oil, 
such as mint, lime, clove or cinnamon. 

When you find which kind of mint your customers like 
best, you will, of course, supply them with that particular 



CANDY MAKING 87 

variety. Shape on paraffin paper or in rubber molds, using 
a heated confectioner's funnel, or drop from tip of spoon. 
They may be crystallized. 

Crystal Syrup 
Put in saucepan 

10 cups sugar and 

iK quarts water. Stir until dissolved, bring to boiling point and 
keep sides of pan washed down with pastry brush to remove 
crystals. At 2i6* F., pour some of the hot syrup into grad- 
uated tube and if the Beaume scale floats at desired degree, 
the syrup is ready. For a fine crystal the syrup should register 
32° on this Beaume scale and 34° for a coarse crystal. Pour 
syrup from graduate tube back in syrup and bring to the boil 
again because the least disturbance spoils the syrup. Let 
syrup stand until perfectly cold. Roll jelly candies such as 

Gum drops or Turkish paste in granulated sugar. Place candies 
on trays in crystal pans, and pour over them syrup to cover. 
Let stand several hours or over night, then lift candies out on 
tray and let dry. Syrup may be reheated and used over again 
if more water is added and syrup tested as before. 

Bonbons 

These are easily made, but soon grow hard and show 
white spots so that they must be made fresh more often than 
some of the other candies. 

Fondant is the base, and with nuts and candied fruits, 
and opera, coffee or maple fondant, a large assortment of 
bonbons can be made. They are more frequently used in 
making up attractive boxes than to be sold by themselves. 

Centers for bonbons may be shaped by hand or in starch 
molds. The former are best as they stay soft, and creamy 
a longer time. With the hands fondant may be shaped in 
cones, balls, short strips, oval, crescent, and mint. 

Bonbon Dipping 

For bonbon dipping a candy dipper or a two-tined fork, 
and two small saucepans, one fitting inside the other, is all 
the equipment that is necessary. A double boiler may be 
used, but experience shows that the gloss of the fondant for

the coating of bonbons can be better kept if only a small por- 
tion of fondant is melted at a time. 

If fondant seems too thick to dip in, thin very carefully 
with cold water or "simple syrup" and be very careful that 
it does not get too warm. A good test is to drop a little on 
the back of the hand, and if it is warm, not hot, it is usually 
right for dipping. 

Simple Syrup : Put in saucepan, i cup sugar, ^ cup water, 
ys teaspoon cream of tartar, and boil to 220° F. 

CARAMELS 

These are good sellers. They are best made of heavy 
cream, although light cream gives a rich caramel. They may 
be made of part milk and part cream or all milk. 

Milk caramels are rich enough if they are to be dipped in 
chocolate. 

In making caramels be sure you have a pan with a smooth 
bottom, with a large surface exposed to the flame, and 
the pan only one-third full of mixture that it may not boil 
over. 

Stir gently but firmly and back and forth rather than 
around. 

Caramels should be made in small quantities to keep up 
the quality, as they are not as satisfactory when made in 
large quantities. 

All corn syrup may be used instead of sugar, but, of 
course, will not make as good a caramel. 

Caramels 
Put 

I cup sugar 

^ cup corn syrup and 

^2 cup cream into saucepan, stir until sugar is dissolved, bring to 
boiling point, and boil until mixture will form a soft ball when 
tried in cold water. Stir gently and constantly to prevent 
burning, making the spoon reach all parts of the saucepan. 



CANDY MAKING 89 



Do not beat, as beating may cause the candy to become gran- 
ular. As soon as candy forms a soft ball add 

^ cup of cream. Boil again until it forms a soft ball in cold 
water, add 

^2 cup cream, and boil until candy will form a decidedly firm ball 
when tried in cold water. The caramels when cold will be 
of the same consistency as this firm ball. Pour caramels into 
a buttered pan or between bars 4 by 9 inches. When cool 
cut in squares, and wrap in wax paper. If caramel should get 
sugary, return it to kettle, add more cream and boil again. 
If all the cream is added at once, caramels may be made in a 
shorter time, but they will not be as rich and creamy. 

Assorted Caramels 

To Caramel Mixture add just before pouring into buttered pan 

any of the following combinations : 
I cup cocoanut 
I cup nut meats cut in pieces 
Raspberry extract and rose color paste 
8 figs cut in pieces 
^ cup raisins cut in pieces 
16 marshmallows cut in pieces. 
3 squares melted chocolate 

3 squares melted chocolate and i cup blanched almonds 
3 squares melted chocolate and i cup salted pignolia nuts 
I teaspoon vanilla 



NUT BRITTLES 

Peanut brittle is a good seller in cool weather, but will 
grow sticky in warm or damp weather. 

This is best made in a cast aluminum or Scotch iron kettle, 
as there is less danger of its burning. 

In this recipe butter is better than margarine. 

These proportions make ij4 pounds of candy. 

If large peanuts are used i^ cups are sufficient. 

The brittle may be poured out upon a greased slab and 
broken in pieces, or poured between bars and cut in three- 
inch squares, which is the better way to market it if you sell 
it by the box. 

Other kinds of nuts may be used, though more expensive.

Peanut Brittle 

Put 

iH cups sugar 

y^ cup corn syrup and 

Yz cup cold water in iron kettle, stir until mixture boils, cover, and 
boil 3 minutes. Remove cover, and boil to 275 degrees F. 
Add 

2 tablespoons butter and 

2 cups shelled raw Spanish peanuts and stir constantly about 10 
minutes or less, or until peanuts are cooked. Add 

5^ teaspoon vanilla and 

H tablespoon soda dissolved in 

^ tablespoon cold water and 

J4 teaspoon salt. Stir until thoroughly mixed, and turn on slightly 
buttered marble slab or agate tray. Spread as thinly as pos- 
sible, and lift constantly while cooling, using a spatula, and 
pull to distribute nuts evenly. Flatten with palm of hand and 
break or cut in pieces. 

TURKISH PASTE 

Turkish paste is a good seller, easily made at little cost, 
and in great variety. 

Agar agar, or Japanese gelatine, gives a paste that breaks 
apart, while a sheet gelatine pulls apart. Agar agar is for 
sale at drug stores or by wholesale confectioners. 

Recipe for Turkish Paste 

5^ ounce agar agar. Put in saucepan with 
ij^ cups boiling water and set one side. Put 

2 cups sugar and 

5^ cup corn syrup in another saucepan. Pour 

H cup warm water over agar agar, stir until it reaches the boiling 
point, remove from fire, stir until dissolved, and strain over 
sugar. Stir and cook mixture to 220 degrees Fahrenheit. Add 

3 drops oil of lime, or peppermint, cinnamon, clove, lemon or 

orange, and color appropriately. Pour on slab yi of an inch 
thick between bars. 
When firm cut in squares and roll in confectioners' sugar. 

BUTTERSCOTCH 

Butterscotch mixture can be used in different ways and is 
always popular. 



CANDY MAKING 91 

Butterscotch Wafers 

In saucepan put 
i^ cups sugar 
j4 cup corn syrup and 
J^ cup water, stir until dissolved, bring to boiling point and boil to 

270 degrees Fahrenheit, or until it is brittle when tried in cold 

water. Add 
ij4 tablespoons butter and 
I tablespoon molasses and cook to 280 degrees Fahrenheit, or until 

it cracks in cold water, stirring to prevent burning. Remove 

from fire, add 
54 teaspoon salt and 
I teaspoon vanilla. Pour from saucepan onto oiled marble slab 

into wafers the size of a coin. 

Scotch Squares 

'Make 
Butterscotch Wafer mixture and pour onto oiled marble slab be- 
tween candy bars placed in a square to make mixture one- 
fourth inch thick. Mark while cooling, with sharp knife, start- 
ing at the outside as edges cool more quickly than center, 

Scotch Mallows 
Make 

Butterscotch Wafer mixture. Prepare 

Marshmallow by brushing and leaving exposed to air for sev- 
eral hours, to form a slight crust. Drop marshmallows, one 
at a time, bottom side up, into mixture, press down that they 
may become completely coated, lift with greased candy dipper 
and put on buttered slab, bottom side down. 

Lolly Pops 

Make 

Butterscotch Wafer mixture, pour onto oiled marble slab, cool 
slighly, rool up like jelly roll, toss back and forth until cool 
enough to handle, cut off with scissors in pieces ij4 inches 
long, insert stick in one end. With palm of hand press into 
shape. Wrap in wax paper. 

Sticks for lolly pops can be purchased in lots of 5,000 from dealers 
in confectioners' supplies. 

Cream Butterscotch Balls 

In saucepan put 
I cup white sugar 
14 cup brown sugar 
y3 cup white corn syrup 
5^ cup butter 
"^ cup heavy cream, stir until well mixed, bring to boiling point, 

stir constantly back and forth, and boil like caramels to a firm 

ball. Remove from fire, add 



92 COOKING FOR PROFIT 

I teaspoon vanilla, lemon or almond extract, pour into a buttered 

pan and when cool shape into small balls, and roll in powdered 

sugar. 
^ cup walnut or pecan nut meats cut in small pieces may be added 

when candy is removed from the fire, or balls may be rolled 

in chopped nut meats. 

One woman supplies 3 or 4 large stores with this one candy 

alone. _^ 

Nougatines 

Nougatines are popular, but hard to beat without machin- 
ery if large quantities must be made. 

Esmeralda cream is a variety of nougatine that is success- 
fully made by an amateur. A sufficient quantity to use for 
dipping in chocolate can be made by the home candy maker. 

Recipes may be found in The Candy Cook Book. 

Chocolate Dipping 

Chocolate candies are undoubtedly the most popular can- 
dies that are sold, but they are difficult to make by the ama- 
teur. It is said to take a year to become an expert chocolate 
dipper, so it may be well in the beginning, if you decide to 
market chocolate candies, to hire a professional dipper for 
that part of the work, although you may make the centers 
yourself. While you are learning to dip successfully you 
could be making hundreds of pounds of other candies. 

Chocolates should cool quickly, but if placed in the ice 
chest they are apt to gather moisture. In factories they 
usually have ammonia refrigeration, and as this is a dry cold 
and not a damp cold, more satisfactory results can be secured 
than in the home. 

The room in which the dipping is to be done should be 
free from steam and of an even temperature of 65 degrees 
to 75 degrees Fahrenheit. On a hot or a rainy day chocolate 
dipping should not be attempted at home. 

Break not less than four pounds coating chocolate in 
pieces, and put into a double boiler or saucepan over hot 
water. The two pans should fit closely, that the steam may 



CANDY MAKING 93 

not escape. Set both pans over the fire until water comes 
to boiling point in the lower pan. Remove from fire, and 
stir until chocolate is melted, then remove dish from hot 
water and beat chocolate gently until it feels a little cooler 
than the hand, or registers between 80 degrees and 85 de- 
grees on the thermometer. This will take from five to twenty 
minutes, depending upon the temperature of the room and 
the amount of chocolate used. At no time should tem- 
perature of chocolate go above 125 degrees or below 80 
degrees F. 

Drop a center into melted chocolate, with candy dipper 
move it around until well covered, then lift out, upside down, 
draw across edge of pan to remove excess chocolate, and 
place on chocolate dipping paper right side up. 

Popular Centres for Chocolates 

Cream mints 
Caramels 
Opera fudge 
Nuts 

Butterscotch 
Esmeralda cream 
Apricot paste 
Fondant 

The way in which the chocolate is coiled on top of each 
piece of candy indicates to the initiated the kind of center 
used. 

Only "coating chocolate" should be used for dipping. 
There are many kinds on the market from which you can 
select the quality which your customers prefer. 

Chocolate Dipping Paper 

This may be purchased in lo-pound cases from dealers in 
confectioners' supplies. It, can be used over again many 



94 COOKING FOR PROFIT 

times to receive dipped chocolates. Table oilcloth is also 
good. 

Favor Suggestions 

If you can originate artistic and attractive favors made 
from candies or dried fruits, or if you can make candy flow- 
ers to top off a box of candy, or if you can decorate mints, 
you can take special orders for them from candy shops, 
women's exchanges, or from people who are entertaining. 
Some suggestions are given in The Candy Cook Book. 

During one winter season lollypops with painted faces and 
elaborate dresses of crepe paper, or with colored heads cut 
from magazines and butterfly bows of tulle or crepe paper, 
made popular favors. 

Salted Nuts 

Heat 
^ cup C(X>king oil in very small pan ; when hot, put in enough nuts 

to cover bottom of pan, and stir until delicately browned. 

Remove with spoon or small skimmer, taking up as little oil as 

possible. Drain on brown paper and sprinkle with 
Salt. Repeat until all are fried. Blanched almonds, raw peanuts 

with skin removed, whole pecans and other nuts may be salted 

in this way. 

Spiced Nuts 

Prepare salted nuts, and when sprinkling with salt sprinkle also 
with powdered clove, powdered cinnamon or a mixture of 
spices. Use instead of salted nuts. 

Sugared Peanuts 

Remove brown skins from 
I cup shelled roasted peanuts, put nuts in a saucepan and keep 

in a warm place. Put 
I cup sugar and 
]/2 cup water in another saucepan, stir until sugar is dissolved, and 
boil without stirring to 238 degrees Fahrenheit, or until candy 
forms a soft ball when tried in cold water. Hold pan of pea- 
nuts several inches above the fire and shake vigorously while 
slowly pouring syrup over the nuts. Occasionally stir the 
nuts, then add remaining syrup drop by drop until all is used. 



CANDY MAKING 95 

Nuts should be evenly covered with a coating of sugar. If 
coating is not thick enough, more sugar and water may be 
boiled and added as before. (One cup almonds, blanched or 
not as desired, may be used instead of peanuts.) 

If you have had little or no experience in candy making 

but wish to specialize in this line it will be well for you to 

study The Candy Cook Book carefully, then experiment with 

the recipes therein in about this order, which is the order in 

which we give lessons in candy making at Miss Farmer's 

School of Cookery.

There are many things in the candy business that you 
must learn from experience. It is impossible to cover every 
point in a lesson or in a book. 

Try to learn something every day from your work, your 
patrons, the people you meet or from the things you read. 

Do not try to market great varieties of candy at first. 
Thoroughly master one kind at a time.

CATERING FOR SOCIAL OCCASIONS 

AMOUNTS TO SERVE ; MENUS AND ESTIMATES ; AFTERNOON TEAS, 
BEVERAGES — TEA, COFFEE, CHOCOLATE, PUNCHES; SANDWICHES; 
COOKIES AND CAKES ; HIGH TEAS AND CARD PARTIES; THE 
BUFFET SPREAD, SERVICE; LAYING THE TABLE; WEDDING RECEP- 
TIONS AND breakfasts; patties and hot dishes; SALADS, 
aspics; DESSERTS, FROZEN DESSERTS; MENUS FOR SOCIAL OCCA- 
SIONS ; FIGURING COSTS ; CATERING FOR A LARGE PARTY, 

IF YOU have become successful in making cakes or rolls 
or sandwiches or patties, or all of these things, people 
may already have begun to ask you to do other things, 
and have found that you can make many other dishes 
equally well. Somebody will soon want to know if you 
won't plan for and make all the sandwiches and cakes for 
the afternoon tea she is giving. If she is pleased, she or 
her friends will ask you to serve a more elaborate spread. 
Before you know it you may be doing a catering business ! 
It is far better to let your business develop naturally in this 
way than to open a catering estabHshment unless you have 
had considerable experience in cooking for large numbers 
of people or in the executive part of such a business. Be- 
fore starting in to do a regular catering business on a large 
scale it would be well to secure a position in a well estab- 
lished catering firm to learn the many phases of this line 
of work. 

97 



98 COOKING FOR PROFIT 

Catering only would give an uncertain income at the best. 
It is usually carried on in connection with a cooked food 
shop, a lunch room, hotel or community kitchen in order to 
make it a paying proposition all the year round. 

Like most businesses, catering is service. It also means 
much testing, tasting, time, thought and hard work, and 
no wasting. 

Usually all dishes are prepared by the caterer and de- 
livered to the place where they are to be served. As a rule 
no cooking is done on the premises, although facihties for 
reheating or keeping food hot may be found or provided. 
Special insulated coffee urns can be purchased of dealers in 
hotel supplies for $20 to $30, and containers for other hot 
foods will be made up to order on the principle of the 
thermos bottle. Frozen dishes are packed in molds and in 
tubs of ice and salt. 

Experience will be your best guide as to the number of 
sandwiches, cookies and cakes, the amount of salad, ice 
cream and coffee to provide, but careful, intelligent planning 
in the beginning is also necessary. 

Make up a definite amount of the desired food and note 
the amount necessary for one portion, and the number of 
portions in the amount you have prepared. Calculate from 
this data the recipe for one and then for the whole number 
to be served. During and after the serving of refreshments 
watch carefully and correct your estimates if necessary so 
you will have more accurate data another time. 

Basic Portions 

The following figures were taken from The Soda Foun- 
tain, a monthly magazine, and may serve as a guide in your 
computations. 



CATERING FOR SOCIAL OCCASIONS 99 

Lemonade, Fruit Punch, or other similar liquid beverage served 
in lemonade or punch cups — lo quarts for each 60 people. Mineral 
glass portions — 10 quarts for each 56 people. 

Ice Cream. 6 standard portions to the quart. If bricks of ice 
cream are ordered, ready cut, they will make very satisfactory por- 
tions if each quart is divided into 8 servings. If a disher or ice 
cream scoop is used^ know exactly how many scoops to a quart and 
a gallon you can get by using dishers of different sizes, and it will 
make a difference if these scoops are leveled off or just rounded 
out with all they will hold. Sometimes the profits go into careless 
measurements. 

Frappe and Sherbet, hard frozen — 3 gallons for 50 people. Half 
frozen and beginning to melt — 2 gallons for 50 people. 

Loaf Sugar, i pound to 24 people. 

Berries, large sized ones — 10 quarts for 50 people. Medium sized 
ones — 8 quarts for 50 people. Smaller sized, sound, ripe berries — 
7 quarts for 50 people. Granulated or powdered sugar for berries — 

2 pounds for 50 people. 

Fancy Wafers. 3 boxes to 50 people. 

Bonbons. 3 pounds to 50 people. 

Olives of medium size will run about 75 to the pint. Allowing 

3 olives to a person, a pint will serve 25. 

Bouillon, hot — 12 quarts will serve 50 people, allowing about 
7 ounces to a person. Jellied, SJ^ quarts will serve 50 people. 

Whipped Cream, i quart will make 50 rounding tablespoonfuls. 
One quart refers to the unwhipped cream, and the measurement by 
tablespoonfuls to the result after it is whipped. 

Hot Chocolate. 25 to 30 cups to the gallon, depending on the 
cup measurement. This amount will take half a pound of chocolate. 

Cakes, round loaf or layer, may be made to serve eight people if 
cut in triangles from the center; or 16 people if cut in quarters and 
then sliced from the center outward toward the edge. In this case, 
the pieces are not exactly uniform in size, but the smaller pieces are 
thicker and the larger ones thinner, so each customer gets the same 
amount of cake in reality. 

Croquettes, 6 pounds of meat will make croquettes for 50 people. 

Oysters. Oysters on the half shell are apportioned at 4 to a 
customer. Solid oyster meats chopped call for 4 quarts for 50 
people. Oyster stew — allow 6 quarts to 50 people. If you wish a 
more generous allowance of oysters to a serving, allow 7 quarts. 

Chicken, Turkey or Roast Meat. Remember that raw meats 
weigh from two to two and a half times their net weight when 
cooked. This is because so much of tj\e moisture is evaporated 
when roasting. With meats which are fiSiled, or fried, or quickly 
cooked in any way, the raw meat will weigh about one and a 
half the cooked portions. Boiled meats will shrink almost as 
much as roast meats, much of the nutriment going to the gravy 
or broth. Twenty- five pounds of raw, dressed meat are allowed for 
the serving of 50 people, if the meat is hot. Cold meat goes farther 



100 COOKING FOR PROFIT 

because it can be sliced thinner, and 25 pounds can be made to serve 
from 60 to 70 people. 

Salmon Salad. This calls for 6 pounds of salmon for 50 por- 
tions. 

Chicken Salad. A 4-pound fowl combined with celery and 
the other trimmings, should make 2 quarts of salad. 2 quarts of 
salad should serve 12 people or i quart to 6 people. 8^ quarts will 
serve 50 people, and 8^ quarts of salad will call for 17 pounds of 
fowl. If larger portions are desired, and it is almost solid chicken 
meat, allow 20 pounds for 50 people. 

Sandwiches. An ordinary sandwich loaf will make 24 sand- 
wiches, or will cut into 48 thin slices of bread; or if you desire a 
little thicker slices of bread and sandwiches with more substance, 
cut each loaf into 36 slices or 18 sandwiches. Each sandwich will 
be the full size of a slice of bread. Allow 2 sandwiches to a person. 
Or if the sandwiches are cut in two or in triangles, allow 4 to a 
person. 

One pound of creamed butter should spread 3 loaves of bread. 
One quart of sandwich filling is the average allowance for one loaf 
of bread. 

Menus and Estimates 

You should plan in advance several menus with standard 
dishes, suitable for afternoon teas, buffet spreads, wedding 
receptions, or other functions for which you may be asked 
to cater, and estimate the amounts required and the entire 
cost of serving fifty or a hundred or more people with these 
different menus. Then you will be prepared when you are 
called upon for an estimate of the expense for such service. 
With a change of menu there will probably be a change in 
the price, but something to work from for your patrons will 
be helpful both to you and to them. 

When making up your estimate for any function do not 
forget to charge for transporting the food from your kitchen 
to the place where the entertainment is to be given, and 
do not neglect to charge for your own time including the 
time of consultation. The distance, the number of people 
to be served and the menu are important items that de- 
termine the price you must charge. 

Your business may "develop to such an extent that you 



CATERING FOR SOCIAL OCCASIONS ' "'^'' ■' ^lOl 

will be asked to provide waitresses to set the table and to 
serve the refreshments, and you may also be requested to 
provide the tables, chairs, china, silver and linen, and even 
the decorations. 

Equipment for Catering 

You can probably get in touch with a caterer from whom 
you can hire such equipment as is necessary, on commission. 
In the same way you can make arrangements with one of 
the best florists in your vicinity, and make a commission on 
the flowers and other decorations that you have to provide. 

If there are many people in your vicinity who entertain, 
it may be wise for you to purchase such equipment as is 
most frequently needed, as china, silver, linen, et cetera, 
that is not found in sufficient quantities in private homes. 
You can rent the equipment to your patrons, store it be- 
tween engagements, and care for it instead of hiring from 
some one, and it will soon pay for itself, and be a distinct 
asset to your business. 

Very careful figuring will be necessary to arrive at the 
proper charge to make for the equipment you lend. 

The original cost, loss by breakage, loss by theft, general 
wear and tear, cost of transporting, cost of washing, polish- 
ing, repairing, replacing, et cetera, must all be taken into 
consideration. Sometimes it is necessary to charge almost 
as much as the original cost of the china or glass each time 
it is rented. 

Fifteen per cent of the total charge for serving a tea may 
be for the dishes used, while at an elaborate banquet as 
much as 75 per cent of the charge may be for the equipment 
alone. 

Prices charged for equipment vary with conditions. At 
one successful establishment the charges are as follows: 



f^M^iyU-J il .ACOOKtNG FOR PROFIT 

One cent each for flat silver. 

Fifty cents a dozen for cups, saucers, plates, et cetera. 

One dollar and fifty cents a dozen for camp chairs. 

A very large establishment may have to furnish awnings, 
carpeting, dancing crash, tables, etc., and also furnish foot- 
men, musicians, dish washers and lumpers. 

There are special business houses in New York, Chicago, 
Cincinnati, and other large cities which will give you an 
estimate on the cost of such equipment as you find you 
need from time to time. Many of these firms advertise 
regularly in the Hotel and Caterers* Magazines. 

Until your business has given you sufficient profit to 
warrant the purchase of an auto truck, you can hire a truck 
paying by the day or by the mile, for the transportation of 
food, equipment, etc. One large concern finds that waiters 
arrive in less dusty condition at their destination if they 
go by train or trolley instead of on the truck. 

Help Required 

One waiter or waitress will probably be needed for each 
six to ten guests if an elaborate spread is provided. 

With simple refreshments and people coming and going 
during several hours, fewer waiters will be needed. 

A dish washer will be necessary to scrape and rinse dishes 
before they are put back in their containers and returned to 
headquarters. 

Waiters and waitresses should be well trained and know 
exactly what they are to do while they are in your patron's 
home. 

What to Serve 

In this lesson we are giving lists of many dishes that 
may be used for different menus and for different occasions. 



CATERING FOR SOCIAL OCCASIONS 103 

AFTERNOON TEA 

It is not necessary to set a table for an informal after- 
noon tea, but a table should be ready to receive the refresh- 
ments in the room in which the guests are to be entertained. 
The table may be covered with a dainty tea cloth or center- 
piece, spotless, unwrinkled, and as elaborate as one desires. 
A centerpiece of flowers may be in place on the table. 

Dishes Suitable for Afternoon Tea 
Beverages 

Tea with such Accompaniments as 

Lump sugar rubbed over the surface of a washed and dried 

lemon or orange 
White or red rock candy 
Lemon drops 
Cream 

Sliced lemon 

Cubes of candied pineapple 
Candied or maraschino cherries 
Whole cloves 
Orange marmalade 
Candied ginger 
Candied rose petals or mint leaves 

Coffee 

With honey and whipped cream 
Add to these lists dishes that you yourself or your patrons 

like especially, and consult these lists constantly while plan- 
ning new menus. As you note the cost of each dish and 
the amount required for a definite number of people, the 
figures may be placed in columns following the dishes. You 
will find it of the greatest help to have such Hsts to work 
from in planning meals for all sorts of occasions. 

A few notes are given to help in serving these refresh- 
ments.

How to Make Tea 

Oolong, English breakfast, and Orange Pekoe tea are used for 
afternoon tea. It may be in the teapot when the tea tray is brought 
in. The water may be almost at the boiling point in a kettle heated 



CATERING FOR SOCIAL OCCASIONS 105 

by alcohol or electricity, and should be used as soon as it actually 
boils. It should stand on the leaves from i to 3 minutes only, 
depending on the kind of tea used. The tea should never be allowed 
to boil. Fresh leaves should never be added to those that have once 
been used for tea. Two level teaspoonfuls of tea and i pint of 
boiling water will make 3 tea cups of tea. Sugar and both lemon 
and cream are provided, and each guest makes her own selection. 
Other accompaniments are suggested above. 

Where only i or 2 cups of tea are to be made at a time, a tea 
ball or perforated double teaspoon half full of tea may be used. 
Place in the cup, pour on boiling water, lift the ball up and down 
until the tea is the right strength as indicated by the color, and 
remove tea ball immediately to another cup or a small dish. Two 
to 4 cups of tea may be made without refilling the ball. 

Iced Tea 

In hot weather iced tea may have a greater appeal than the hot 
beverage. The tea should be freshly made and poured while hot 
over pieces of ice in tall glasses. Sugar and lemon are used with it. 

Cofifee 

Cofifee and cocoa are usually served from urns at which friends 
of the hostess preside. 

Filtered coffee may be made in the urn if it is provided with 
a strainer or if a linen bag is suspended in the urn. 

At a famous restaurant the rule is as follows : 

One Gallon Filtered Coffee 

Mix thoroughly 
8 ounces medium fine ground coffee 
^ of I egg white 
H cup cold water and 
% teaspoon salt; pour over 
I gallon of fresh water which is actually boiling. 

Draw off the liquid and pour over and over until of the right 
strength, then remove bag. 

If a percolator is used in which the water bubbles up and falls 
down through the coffee, it will probably take about 10 minutes to 
become of the right strength. 

Special insulated coffee urns should be provided in which coffee 
will keep hot for a number of hours if made in one place and 
served in another, or if it is served at intervals for several hours. 



106 COOKING FOR PROFIT 

Boiled Coffee for Fifty 

Put in coffee bag 
I pound ground coffee, place in container, add 
6 to 8 quarts cold water and let stand several hours or over night. 

Bring to boiling point and boil 3 minutes. Remove bag and 
serve coffee as required. 

For After Dinner Coffee use 4 to 5 quarts of cold water. 

Cocoa and Chocolate 

Cocoa or chocolate may be served from the kitchen or from a 
chocolate pot at the table. 

Be sure the cocoa or chocolate boils with the water and sugar for 
at least 5 minutes before the milk is added, and that it is then kept 
hot over hot water or in a special container. 

Mexican Chocolate 

Scald 
I quart milk with 

1 inch piece of stick cinnamon and 

3 tablespoons ground coffee. Strain through cheesecloth, add 

2 squares sweet chocolate melted over hot water and mixed with 
I/2 cup boiling water. Cook three minutes over hot water, add 

J/^ teaspoon vanilla and serve with 
Whipped cream. 

Soups 

Delicate cream soups are sometimes served at afternoon affairs, 
especially at bridge parties. A spoonful of whipped cream slightly 
salted or combined with sifted pimiento may be served on the 
soup. 

Punch 

Punch or frappe, which is a half frozen sherbet, is served with a 
ladle from a punch bowl, which should be on a small table that is 
covered with a luncheon cloth. Punch glasses should be on the 
table around the bowl. 

A block of ice should be in the punch bowl, also a garnish of 
thin slices of fruit or sometimes a bunch of mint leaves. Balls of 
lemon or strawberry ice may be used instead of ice in the punch 
bowl. 

Whipped cream may be put on each glass of some varieties of 
punch as it is served. 

Gingerale or charged water should not be added to punch until 
just before it is served.

SANDWICHES 

Five o'clock tea sandwiches should be small and dainty. 
The bread should be thinly sliced, and the crusts removed. 
The serving plate may be garnished with cress or small 
lettuce leaves. White, graham, Boston brown or nut bread 
may be used. Be careful to spread the butter and filling to 
the edges and corners of the bread. 

Sandwiches may be cut in circles, squares, rectangles, 
triangles, diamonds or strips. They should be wrapped in 
a dry cloth, then in a damp cloth as soon as made, and put 
in a closely covered metal receptacle or crock or wrapped 
in wax paper. 

Bread spread with creamed butter is always in good taste 
or the following fillings may be used. 

Fillings for Sandwiches 

Chopped olives or pimolas 

Lettuce and mayonnaise dressing 

Chopped nuts and creamed butter

Ribbon Sandwiches 

Layer sandwiches or ribbon sandwiches are made with three or 
more slices of bread l4 inch thick, put together with filling. They 
should be folded in damp cheesecloth,, pressed under a weight until 
serving time, then cut in ^ inch slices, and arranged on a doily- 
covered plate. The bread may be all white, or alternate slices of white 
and dark bread may be used. Nut bread, graham bread, and Boston 
brown bread are all attractive. The middle slice of bread should be 
spread on both sides with butter or other filling, and the outside 
slices should be buttered on one side only. The effect is like a 
slice of layer cake. 

Piquante Ribbon Sandwiches 

6 tablespoons butter, work until creamy, add 
4 tablespoons grated horseradish 
I teaspoon lemon juice 
6 pimolas finely chopped 
Few grains salt 

Spread a slice of white bread with this mixture, cover with a slice 
of graham bread, spread with the mixture and cover with a slice 
of white bread. Prepare other slices of bread in the same way. 
Wrap in damp cheesecloth, press under a board with a weight on 
top, and when ready to serve cut in thin slices. 

Mosaic Sandwiches 

Cut three slices each of white and graham bread one-half inch in 
thickness. Spread a slice of white bread with creamed butter and 
place a slice of graham on it; spread this with creamed butter and 
place on it a slice of white bread ; repeat this process, beginning 
with a slice of graham. Put both piles in a cool place under a 
light weight. When butter has become firm, trim each pile evenly 
and cut each pile in three one-half inch slices. Spread these with 
butter and put together in such a way that a white block will alter- 
nate with a graham one. Place again in a cool place under a light 
weight, and when butter has become perfectly hard cut in thin 
slices for serving. Arrange on a plate covered with a doily. 

Crackers 

Small, toasted, unsweetened crackers may be served with soup 
or tea, or with a filling in place of sandwiches. 



CATERING FOR SOCIAL OCCASIONS 109 

Cookies and Little Cakes 

These should be small and dainty for an afternoon tea. 
Cut cake with a soft frosting is difficult to handle, and had 
best be kept for some other occasion. 

Small cakes may be plain or frosted, and sometimes may 
be decorated. 

Recipes and suggestions for cookies and cakes are found 
in Chapters III and IV, or in standard cook books. 

Make up your own list of these cakes and add to it other 
small cakes that you have found popular. Use this list in 
planning your menus. 

A cross between a wafer and a cracker are the dainty 
Swedish Tea Cakes. 

Swedish Tea Cakes 

Beat slightly 
I egg, add 
14 teaspoon salt and 

Flour enough to make a very stiff dough. 

Knead, roll mixture very thin, cut out with small round 
fluted cutter, fry in hot oil and sprinkle with cinnamon and 
powdered sugar. 

HIGH TEAS AND CARD PARTIES 

At an elaborate tea you should not attempt to serve too 
many dishes, but whatever is served should be as attractive 
and appetizing as possible. 

The menu may consist of sandwiches or rolls, a hot dish, 
a salad, a jelHed or frozen dessert, cakes, bonbons, salted 
nuts and tea or coffee. If the salad is a frozen one, the 
dessert should not be frozen ; a charlotte russe, or a jellied 
or fruit dessert, will be satisfactory. 



110 COOKING FOR PROFIT 

At a card party the card tables are often covered with 
dainty cloths, and the same kind of menu as suggested 
above is served at each table. 

The salads and desserts should all be served individually. 

Refreshments at card parties and club meetings may be 
easily served from the kitchen on individual trays contain- 
ing the three or four dishes of the menu. 

THE BUFFET SPREAD 

At a formal reception, a wedding, a dance or other large 
party, a buffet spread may be served. At noon it may be 
called a wedding breakfast, at one or two o'clock a luncheon, 
in the afternoon a high tea, in the evening a spread or a 
reception. 

At any of these functions the guests may partake of the 
refreshments standing. 

Buffet Service 

When buffet service is used the food is placed upon an 
attractively laid table, usually all at the same time, although 
it may be brought to the table and served in courses. Plates, 
silver and napkins are arranged upon the table to make the 
service as quick and simple as possible. 

The arrangement and service of a buffet luncheon and a 
buffet spread or supper are practically the same, except that 
the luncheon often presents heavier and more varied courses, 
and in the evening lighted candles are used. 

The arrangement of the dishes depends largely upon the 
menu and the number of guests to be served. Rather than 
have the table appear crowded, it is better to have a maid 
replenish the dishes and supplies from the serving table or 
pantry. 



CATERING FOR SOCIAL OCCASIONS HI 

The menu may consist of one or two hot dishes, one or 
two cold dishes, hot rolls and sandwiches, one or two frozen 
desserts, or one dessert frozen and the other an attractively 
garnished mold of jelly or cream; cakes, olives, bonbons, 
nuts, coffee or chocolate and punch. All food should be 
such as can be easily eaten with a fork or spoon. 

The laying of the table should be as follows : After lay- 
ing the luncheon cloth or the silence and dinner cloth, place 
the floral decoration in the center, and the candlesticks, two 
or four, about the centerpiece (these may be omitted for a 
midday spread). Four dishes of bonbons, or two of bon- 
bons and two of salted nuts or olives should be placed just 
outside the candlesticks for an evening spread. Next, place 
two chafing dishes or platters at ends of the table in direct 
line. These should be filled just before the guests ar- 
rive. Each may contain a different mixture, or each may 
contain the same kind of mixture. The platters for the 
salad or salads are placed next, at opposite sides of the table. 
Around these platters and chafing dishes group the forks 
attractively and the plates in one or two piles. Place the 
serving silver in the most convenient position, fork at the 
left and spoon at the right of the salad platters and chafing 
dishes. 

Rolls and sandwiches are arranged on doily-covered plates 
and placed not too far in from the edge of the table; rolls 
are served with the hot course, and sandwiches with the 
salad. 

Place small napkins piled diagonally, side and corner 
alternating, not too high, on two or four opposite corners 
of the table. 

After the hot and salad courses have been served and 
removed, the ices, with serving silver, are brought in. Cakes 
arranged on doily-covered plates may be previously placed 
on the serving table, and passed or placed with ice cream 



112 COOKING FOR PROFIT 

on the dining table. Coffee alone, or coffee and chocolate, 
may be provided. Either one or both may be served from 
an urn placed at one end of the table, or the filled cups, 
either large or small, may be brought in on a tray from the 
pantry. Punch is usually served from a punch bowl placed 
with the necessary glasses on a small table in another room. 
Friends of the hostess usually serve; sometimes the host 
and hostess assist, although a waitress may do the passing, 
removing all soiled dishes, bringing fresh ones and replen- 
ishing supplies. A buffet spread for a large reception, where 
people are coming and going during certain hours, varies 
from the spread served at a definite hour to a definite num- 
ber in that all refreshments (hot, cold and frozen) and also 
the beverages are put upon the table at once. 

Wedding Receptions and Breakfasts 

The refreshments served at a wedding may be simple or 
elaborate. A Bride's Cake or a Wedding Cake or both 
may be used with a simple menu or omitted if more con- 
venient. With an elaborate menu they may both be in- 
cluded. If only ice cream and cake are served the ice cream 
may be brought from the pantry on individual plates by 
waiters, members of the family or friends, or it may be 
served in the dining room. 

A folded napkin may be under each plate and a tea- 
spoon, or an ice cream spoon may be on each plate as it is 
passed. The cakes arranged on doily-covered plates may 
then be passed. 

If served in the dining room the arrangement is the same 
as suggested under a Buffet Spread. 

The decorated Bride's Cake may be used as the centre 
piece.

DISHES THAT MAY BE SERVED AT A BUFFET 

SPREAD 

Patties and Hot Dishes 

Any delicate meat or fish, heated in a rich white or cream 
sauce, may be served in patty cases, timbale cases, ramekin 
dishes, from a chafing dish or as a croquette. 

Mushrooms, trufiies, pimientos, green pepper or cheese 
may be added for flavor and garnish. 

Timbales are made of finely chopped chicken, sweet- 
breads, ham, veal, salmon, or delicate white fish combined 
with eggs, cream and crumbs, baked in timbale molds, 
turned out and served hot with a rich sauce. They may 
take the place of patties. 

Suggestions for Hot Dishes

Rolls and Sandwiches 

The rolls served at a buffet spread should be small, light, 
a delicate brown in color, and buttered before they are 
served, or made so rich with butter that none is necessary. 
Cream fingers, Parker House rolls or luncheon rolls are 
usually served. 

Sandwiches may be the same as suggested for teas. 

Salads 

Salads may be made of vegetables, fruit, fish, meat, nuts 
or cheese, alone or in combination, mixed with salad dress- 
ing and served on lettuce or other green. 

Mayonnaise dressing, alone or combined with whipped 
cream, or a cooked dressing may be used. 

Every leaf of lettuce should be carefully washed and 
dried. The ingredients of which the salad is made should 
be cut in regular pieces of uniform size. The salad filhng 
should be most carefully placed on the green used. Avoid 
any appearance of carelessness in the arrangement. 

Salads are very attractive if the ingredients are com- 
bined with I tablespoon gelatine soaked and dissolved in 
3 tablespoons liquid for each cup of mayonnaise used. They 
may be molded in individual forms or in large decorated 
molds. 

Frozen salads are popular. For a frozen salad as much 
cream should be whipped as you will use of mayonnaise 



CATERING FOR SOCIAL OCCASIONS 115 

dressing. Combine and mix with the fruit, vegetables, lob- 
ster, chicken, or whatever is used. Put into small brick 
molds or baking powder boxes, cover, pack in i part ice to 
2 parts salt and leave about 2 hours or until frozen. Salad 
may then be sliced and served on lettuce leaves. 

For a very elaborate affair whole small salmon, boned 
chicken or turkeys may be molded in aspic jelly. The 
molds are usually elaborately decorated and when turned 
out are garnished with cress or other green and mayonnaise 
dressing and make an attractive addition to a buffet table. 

Aspics 

Highly seasoned soup stock made from beef, veal, chicken 
or fish, is used for aspic jelly. 

Gelatine is dissolved in the stock; it is then cleared, 
cooled and used in a mold with boned chicken or turkey, 
salmon, eggs, lobster, chicken salad or other delicate in- 
gredients. 

The mold may be a large one and garnished with hard 
cooked eggs, capers, olives, pickles, truffles, parsley, bits of 
cooked vegetables, et cetera. It should be well chilled be- 
fore being turned out on a platter. 

A FEW SALADS THAT MAY BE SERVED 

Lobster salad 

Pear salad — half pears on lettuce, center filled with nuts and 
mayonnaise 

Tomatoes stuffed with chicken or vegetable salad

2 tablespoons butter, and 

^ teaspoon celery seed. Cool, then fold in the stiffly beaten 
white of 

I egg ' 

Yz cup cream beaten stiff and 

V/i cups fruit, using oranges, bananas, white grapes and mara- 
schino cherries. Put in small baking powder boxes, cover 
with buttered paper, then with tin cover, and pack in 2 parts 
crushed ice to i part rock salt for 2 hours. Remove from 
molds, cut in slices and serve on lettuce leaves. 

Dessert 

The dessert served at a buffet spread is usually frozen, 
but jellies, charlotte russe, and Bavarian creams may be 
used. They should be attractively molded and decorated. 
They are frequently placed on the table on large platters 
and should be pleasing to look at as well as to taste. 

Jellies 

The jellies used are stiffened with gelatine. Powdered 
gelatine is especially satisfactory as it is quickly softened 
and dissolved. For flavor lemon juice, orange juice or al- 
most any fresh or canned fruit juice may be used except 
fresh pineapple juice which has the property of digesting 
gelatine, thus preventing the hardening of the jelly. 

Spanish Cream 

Spanish cream is boiled custard stiffened with gelatine 
and made light and fluffy by the addition of beaten tgg 



CATERING FOR SOCIAL OCCASIONS 117 

whites. The custard may be made of all milk and flavored 
as desired, or of part milk and part coffee. 

Bavarian Cream 

Bavarian creams are like Spanish creams with whipped 
cream folded in just as they are beginning to stiffen. 
Cooked fruit juices, as pineapple and apricot, may be used 
instead of milk. 

Charlotte Russe 

Charlotte russe is made of cream or fruit juice sweet- 
ened and flavored, stiffened with gelatine and combined with 
whipped cream. The mold is usually Hned with lady fin- 
gers or thin slices of sponge cake. 

Fancy Molded Desserts 

Jellied desserts may be molded in layers. The mold 
should be placed in ice water and a thin layer of jelly put 
in the bottom. This may be decorated with fruit, nuts, etc. 
Then jelly should be carefully put over the decorations to 
hold them in place. When firm, more jelly may be added, 
or beaten jelly, a whipped cream mixture or fruit may be 
used alternately with the jelly until the mold is full. 

Artificial colors, as scarlet, rose, green, orange, etc., may 
be added to the mixture before it is stiffened. 

Fruits or nuts in small pieces may be folded into the 
mixture, may be arranged in the bottom of the mold, or 
may be used as a decoration on it or around it, when the 
mold is turned out. 

FROZEN DESSERTS 

Recipes for many kinds of frozen desserts may be found 
in any good cook book. 

If two or three kinds of ice cream or ice cream and 



118 COOKING FOR PROFIT 

sherbet are to be packed in one mold they must each be 
frozen separately and then packed in alternate layers. This 
is called Neapolitan ice cream. 

Sherbet. A sherbet is a mixture of fruit juice, water 
and sugar frozen like ice cream. 

Frappes. A coarsely frozen water ice or sherbet. Equal 
parts ice and salt are used and mixture is stirred occasion- 
ally until frozen. 

Ice Cream. Ice creams are mixtures of cream, sugar and 
flavoring, turned into the can of a freezer, surrounded with 
a mixture of 3 parts ice and i part rock salt, and frozen 
while being constantly stirred. Fruit ice creams are made 
by combining thin cream with sifted fruits and sweetening 
to taste. 

An ice cream stiffened with rennet or junket requires 
less cream than most other kinds of frozen desserts. 

Sometimes flour and eggs are both used to thicken the 
custard for ice cream. 

Ice cream made with many egg yolks is called French 
ice cream. 

Many commercial ice creams contain gelatine or other 
preparations to prevent their melting too rapidly. 

When it is impossible to get cream for frozen desserts 
evaporated milk may be successfully substituted. 

When served with whipped cream and lady fingers a 
mold of ice cream becomes a charlotte glace. 

Bisque Ice Cream. Ice cream to which chopped nuts or 
pounded macaroons are added is called bisque ice cream. 

Mousses are mixtures of whipped cream, sugar and 
flavoring. The mixture is put into a mold, covered with 
greased paper and with the tin cover, and packed in 2 parts 
ice to I part salt and left for 2 hours or longer. 

Parfaits are made by pouring hot syrup over beaten yolks 
or whites of eggs and combining it with whipped cream and 



CATERING FOR SOCIAL OCCASIONS 119 

flavoring. They may be frozen without an ice cream 
freezer. Turn into a mold or empty baking powder boxes, 
cover with greased paper and with tight tin cover. Sur- 
round with 2 parts crushed ice and i part rock salt, and 
leave 2 hours or longer. The salt water that accumulates 
should be occasionally poured off to prevent the possibility 
of its getting into the mold. 

Bomhe. A bombe is made by lining a bombe, melon or 
other mold with frozen sherbet or ice cream, and filling 
the center with frozen ice cream or unfrozen mousse or 
parfait of a contrasting color. Many attractive combinations 
are possible. Pack for two hours or more before serving. 

Variations. Any plain ice cream may be served with 
whipped cream or with a sauce. Many sauces are served 
warm and stiffen when poured over the cream. Nuts may 
be sprinkled on top of the sauce. Fresh or candied fruit 
may be used in a sauce, especially with vanilla ice cream. 

Sundaes. Ice cream molded with a scoop, covered with 
a sauce and sprinkled with nuts. 

How TO Freeze Ice Creams, Etc. 

Ice cream freezers to be turned by hand come in sizes 
from I quart to 25 quarts. Where ice cream must be made 
daily and in large quantities, it is desirable to have a 
freezer that runs by electricity, and special methods for 
storing the frozen cream. Coils through which flows am- 
monia gas are frequently used instead of ice and salt in ice 
cream factories. 

The Ice Cream Scoop 

Ice cream scoops come in different sizes so that six, eight 
or twelve portions may be taken from one quart of cream. 



120 COOKING FOR PROFIT 

Some scoops are half spheres, and some are cone shaped. 
They insure uniformity in the size of the portions served. 
A large mixing spoon may also be used. 

When serving, use two scoops or spoons and change 
them frequently, keeping one in hot water, while the other 
is being used to serve the cream, so that the ice cream will 
slide easily from the hot scoop or spoon into the serving dish. 

Molded Ice Creams 

Ice cream molds come in individual shapes. The best 
ones are made of lead and cost from one to three dollars 
each. Larger molds come in sizes holding from one pint 
to two quarts or more in many different shapes, such as 
brick, melon, heart shaped, et cetera. 

Individual ices are of course served one to a person. 
Large molds should be cut in slices for serving. Molds are 
filled to overflowing with the frozen mixture, covered and 
packed in 4 parts ice and i part rock salt until time for 
serving. 

The rim where the mold and the cover join may be 
bound with a strip of cheesecloth dipped in melted fat to 
prevent the entrance of salt water into the mold. 

Turning Out a Mold of Jellied or Frozen Mixture 

A mold should be oiled and the oil wiped out with soft 
paper before a mixture is put in. Wet with cold water the 
platter on which the mold is to be served and do not dry 
it. If it does not fall directly in the center, it can then be 
easily moved into place. If the mixture does not readily 
come out of the mold, dip it for an instant in warm water 
or lay over it a cloth wrung out of hot water. A thin knife 
run around the edge will help to loosen it. 



CATERING FOR SOCIAL OCCASIONS 121

The turned out mold may be decorated with : 

Whipped cream forced through a pastry bag in which a rose tube 

has been inserted

If you have not the facilities for making or molding large 
quantities of ice cream, you can get in touch with a large 
city manufacturer who has the reputation of making the 
best ice cream of anyone about, and order from him as 
required. He will doubtless give you a commission, prob- 
ably of 125^ per cent, on all that you sell for him.

Figuring Cost of Afternoon Tea Menu 

PVom previous lessons and experience you should have 
data as to the cost of sandwiches and little cakes. In esti- 
mating the cost of a menu, use cards, ruled as in Lesson II. 

Have one card for each sandwich, each cake, for bever- 
ages, with their different accompaniments, and for nuts, 
oHves, bonbons, et cetera. 

Then copy the totals from each card onto another card 
as follows, using cost and selling price of foods. It will 
be wise to make out a card, very carefully, for each menu 
that you propose to serve.

Catering for a Large Party 

Catering for a large party may not be beyond your pos- 
sibilities. The following description of a successful dancing 
party will show a supper which was supervised by a young 
woman of little experience. It was largely prepared in her 
own home. 

This is an extract from her letter: 

"The dance hall was finished in ivory and old rose. We had 
festoons of paper vines and wistaria from each light globe and 
entirely around the room direct from the ceiling; in the space be- 
tween each window were huge shower bouquets of real roses, four 
dozen to the bouquet, and at each drape at the windows and doors 
were like bouquets of roses; at opposite ends of the room were tall 
floor lamps and at opposite sides were tall candle stands of fifteen 
cathedral candles; tall stands with bird cages were in various 
corners. The punch table was in one corner and also decorated with 
roses. 

"The supper room was decorated the same way; a huge bouquet 
of roses formed the center piece, and festoons of roses and tulle 
decorated the tablecloth. Everything was served in silver dishes. 



CATERING FOR SOCIAL OCCASIONS 12& 

There were thirteen cakes, half white frosting, half pink; they were 
8 inches wide by 12 inches long, one layer, nearly 2 inches thick; 
these were served in whole cakes, one of each color, cut 21 squares 
to a cake, in a large silver tray, just the size needed. There were 
1,000 sandwiches, 500 made of ham, ground in a meat grinder and 
mixed with sweet pickle and mayonnaise, the other 500 made of 
cream cheese, stuffed olives, pimiento, celery and mayonnaise. These 
were served on silver plates. Ten pounds of pecans and almonds 
mixed were salted after being cooked in olive oil. These were 
served in a large tall silver bowl. Coffee was served from a silver 
urn placed at one end of the table. 

"Pink mints and long slender candy sticks, and individual ice 
creams in the shape of a full blown rose completed the refreshments 
for a party of 200."

SALADS ; desserts ; children's parties ; menus for special 

and holiday parties 

MANY women vi^ho have had experience in cooking 
and serving company meals in their own or in 
other people's kitchens, find profit in preparing 
meals for special occasions at the home of the person who 
is entertaining. 

If to a knowledge of cooking is added artistic ability that 
can be displayed in planning and arranging decorations, 
favors and menus in accordance with special occasions, a 
woman will find few unengaged days during the whole 
season. 

The best way to advertise such a business is probably to 
send out an announcement card something like the follow- 
ing to women who entertain frequently. 

Almost no capital is needed in order to start such a busi- 
ness, but a very practical knowledge of all kinds of good 
cookery is essential. When no entertaining is being done, 
you can go once or twice a week to a few people and cook 
enough food to last several days.

You will probably be called on the phone and asked if 
you are free on a certain date. On replying that you are

free, a time will be set for you to go to the home of the 
hostess and discuss with her the menu she is to have. 

You must be able tactfully to make suggestions, or 
graciously to follow her ideas as to the number and kind 
of courses, the style of decorations, and other details. For 
her selection you may have a list of dishes, and combina- 
tions for each course that will be served. 



CATERING FOR LUNCHEONS AND SUPPERS 133 

After the menu is planned, a complete list of all the 
supplies required for the meal should be carefully made 
out. It will be well to go into the kitchen of the hostess 



DO YOU want a -tempting luncheon 
for company, a simple or elaborate 
dinner for guests? Let me pre- 
pare it for you while you are entertain- 
ing your friends. 

Let me come in for a day and "cook 
you up ahead" for several days. My 
rolls will keep tender, my roast will last 
for three or four meals. My pot of 
clear bouillon made up with different 
flavors will make a first course for a 
number of dinners. My pies, cakes, 
cookies and puddings will put something 
to eat on your pantry shelves and my 
luncheon dishes will be all ready for you 
to heat up and place on the table. For 
several days after a day spent with you 
dainty dishes can appear like magic at 
meal time. 

Consultations in regard to menus and 
prices may be arranged for by mail or 
phone.

and see what supplies are on hand, and if she has all the 
equipment necessary for preparing the meal as outlined. 

Most women find it necessary to take with them measur- 
ing cups and spoons, one or two sharp knives, special cutters 
and beaters and molds. 

The marketing may be done by the hostess or the person 
who prepares the meal. 



134 COOKING FOR PROFIT 

The price charged depends upon the number of persons 
to be served and ranges from five dollars a meal up, accord- 
ing to the elaborateness of the meal and the number served. 
It is all clear profit as all supplies are charged to the hostess. 

Table Decorations 

The decorations for the table usually include a center- 
piece which should be low enough or high enough not to 
obstruct the view across the table. This may be of flowers 
of appropriate colors, or tiny dressed figures suitable to the 
occasion. 

A Jack Horner Pie of crepe paper, containing favors, is 
frequently used as a centerpiece. If it is in the form of a 
huge turkey it is appropriate for Thanksgiving. 

A lovely and enormous white crepe paper rose is appro- 
priate for an engagement or a bridal luncheon. 

A stunning gray battleship of paper with tiny figures in 
uniform would grace the table at a luncheon for a navy 
man. 

A chimney of crepe paper colored to represent bricks, 
with a paper Santa Claus mounted on cardboard, and hold- 
ing on his back a brown paper bag from which protrude 
the family's presents, would be the delight of any Christ- 
mas party. 

There are yellow tulip pies, and rose pies of all shades 
to celebrate the luncheon given to the returning college girl. 

All these centerpieces contain hidden favors which are 
attached to different colored ribbons leading to the seat of 
each guest. 

Other decorations may consist of appropriate place cards, 
individual favors, a small basket of fresh flowers, a small box 
of candy or a single but very beautiful flower at each place. 

It will be to your advantage to visit or otherwise keep 
in touch with favor shops in large cities. Study the sug-

gestions found in magazines and originate or modify ideas. 
Keep a scrap book and note book. 

Candle Sticks 

Candles are not used for a luncheon but may be part 
of the supper decorations. 

Where sufficient candles are used they make the only 
light provided. 

Points for the Caterer to Remember 

Take the greatest care of the hostess' possessions. 

Show consideration for other help in the house. 

Work in harmony with the help. 

Do not demand too much of the help. 

Be neat in appearance. 

Be agreeable in demeanor. 

Waitresses 

The woman who prepares the meal is not expected to 
serve, but she may be asked to engage the waiters or 
waitresses, having one maid for each six guests. 

Luncheon Menus 

A luncheon menu may consist of five or six courses. 

1. A fruit course or shell fish or fish cocktail. 

2. A bouillon or cream soup with croutons, crackers or 

rolls. 

3. A fish or entree course if desired. 

4. A main dish in individual services with two vegetables. 

5. A salad with a cheese accompaniment or a sandwich. 

6. Dessert, nuts, bonbons and coffee. 

For special hohdays and other occasions, the color scheme 
of centerpiece and favors, and the decorations of many of 



136 COOKING FOR PROFIT 

the dishes can be such as to suggest the special emblem for 
that day. With slight changes most menus suggested in 
this chapter can be adapted to every-day affairs or for a 
different holiday. 

Supper Menus 

A supper menu may be similar to that for a buffet 
luncheon or a spread as suggested in Part VI, page no. 
Ordinarily the guests will be seated at the table rather than 
be served while standing. 

Be sure the foods you select are obtainable at the time 
the meal is to be served. 

Do not repeat flavors or foods in a menu ! 

For instance, do not serve tomato soup and tomato in 
the salad. 

Let each course be a contrast in color to the one that 
precedes or follows it, unless you are carrying out a spe- 
cial color scheme. 

The Fruit Course 

The fruit course may be of one fruit, a mixture of fruits, 
or one or several fruit juices. The fruit selected or its 
garnish may be of a color that matches the color scheme 
selected for the table decorations. 

How TO Serve the Fruit Course 

This course may be on the table when the guests enter 
the dining room. The fruit should be thoroughly chilled 
and attractively garnished. 

The fruit may be served in 

1. Single glasses similar to a champagne glass. 

2. In a double cocktail glass, the inside glass being sur- 

rounded with crushed ice. 

3. In the skin of the fruit, as grapefruit, orange or canta- 

loupe. 



CATERING FOR LUNCHEONS AND SUPPERS 137 

4. Sections of fruit or perfect whole berries, arranged on a 
small flat plate with a mound of powdered sugar in 
the center. 

Cocktails 

A cocktail glass is served on a small plate covered with 
a doily with the spoon on the right-hand side of the plate. 

Fruit cocktails, made of fruit juices or fruit, are best 
sweetened with a syrup made of equal parts of sugar and 
water cooked 3 minutes. 

A crabmeat, lobster, or a scallop cocktail may be served 
in place of fruit. The arrangement is the same, substitut- 
ing an oyster fork for the spoon if the cocktail is served 
in a glass. Other arrangements for fish cocktails will be 
given in the next lesson.

Preparation of Fruit for the Fruit Course 

Special care must always be taken to prepare fruit neatly 
and attractively when served at a company luncheon. 



FRUIT 
Grapefruit 



METHOD 

Cut the grapefruit across the sections 
in half. Loosen the pulp around the in- 
side by cutting between the pulp and the 
skin, then loosen each section by cutting 
between the pulp and the membrane. 

Loosen the membrane underneath at 
the center of the fruit with a grapefruit 
knife or a pair of scissors, and lift it 
out entirely leaving the fruit in its shell 
in its original shape. Garnish or dec- 
orate each half, or take out the sections 
of fruit, cut in two and use in a fruit 
cocktail. 



To Remove Pulp from 
Oranges and Grape- 
fruit 



Pare the fruit with a sharp knife, re- 
moving every particle of the thin inside 
membrane with the peel. This will leave 
the pulp exposed. Hold the fruit over a 
plate, so that any juice which may drop 
will be saved. Insert the point of the 
knife at the stem end of the fruit close 
to the membrane that divides the sec- 
tions. Carefully work the knife in, 
separating the membrane from the sec- 
tion. Then carefully separate the section 
of fruit from the membrane on its other 
side; remove the whole section, complete 
in shape, and entirely free from mem- 
brane. Repeat until all the sections are 
removed.

thoroughly chilled or cut in pieces qi 
uniform size. 

Dip for a moment in boiling water to 
loosen the skin, and remove skin with a 
silver knife; use as soon as chilled. 



Soups 

A clear bouillon or a cream soup may be served at a 
luncheon. The bouillon may be hot or jellied. 

The bouillon cup and saucer are placed on the service 
plate, handles directly parallel to the edge of the table. 

Fruit juice sweetened, slightly thickened and chilled is 
sometimes served and takes the place both of a cocktail 
and a soup. 



Foundation Soup Recipes 

The foundation of a bouillon is a beef, chicken or fish 
stock cleared with whites of eggs and always strained 
through double cheesecloth. 



CATERING FOR LUNCHEONS AND SUPPERS 141 

Many cream soups are a combination of thin white sauce, 
strained vegetable pulp and meat or vegetable stock. 
Recipes can be found in almost any good cook book. 

Suggestions for Luncheon Bouillons

Clam Bouillon with or without whipped cream and a 
dash of paprika.

Puree of Rice and Chicken Stock 

Andalusian Soup, (tomato soup with macaroni or tapioca) 

Cream of Brussels Sprouts 

Beetroot Soup 

Cream of Peanut Butter Soup 

Cream of Sorrel Soup

served : 



142 COOKING FOR PROFIT 

Crisp Crackers — Crackers spread with butter and delicately crisped 

in the oven. 
Imperial Sticks — Strips of buttered bread toasted in the oven 
Souffled Crackers — Crackers soaked in ice water and baked until 

puffed and brown 
Popped Corn

Oyster Crackers 
Brown Bread and Butter 
Toasted Triangles of Bread 
Mock Almonds — thin toast the size and shape of almonds 

Celery, radishes, or olives are usually served after the 
soup has been placed. 

Fish Course 

A delicate fish course is sometimes served preceding the 
meat course at luncheon, or it may take the place of the 
meat course or the entree. 

This may be arranged in the kitchen on individual plates, 
or fish plates may be placed in front of each guest and 
the fish attractively garnished may be served on a platter 
or a fish plate. 

Fish should always be very fresh, and served, if possible, 
free frOm skin and bone. Fish may be fried, steamed or 
baked and should be served vi^ith a nice sauce. 

Consult the markets as to the best fish to serve, and 
cook books for attractive methods of serving. 

Sliced tomatoes or cucumbers served in some attractive 
manner and dressed with French dressing are a good accom- 
paniment for the fish course. 

Luncheon Entrees 

An entree, which is a made dish, may take the place of 
the fish course, or may be used for the main course at a 



CATERING FOR LUNCHEONS AND SUPPERS 143 

luncheon. The hot dishes suggested in Lesson VI may be 
used or any of the following. Many other suggestions 
will be found in good cook books. A delicately flavored 
sauce is an important part of most entrees. A delicate 
vegetable with a rich sauce is sometimes served as an 
entree. 

A Few Pleasing Entrees 

Eggs, hard cooked or poached, in individual dishes with a rich 
sauce. These or other egg dishes may be used as the first 
course at a luncheon. 

Stuffed Mushroom Caps 

Shrimps and Mushrooms with a good sauce 

Scallops creamed or fried 

Oyster and Shrimp Newburg 

Lobster in a cream sauce, served in pastry boats or patty cases 

Chicken and Mushroom Timbales

may follow or be used in place of the fish or entree courses 
mentioned above. They should be attractively served. One

Luncheon Salads 

A luncheon salad may be more substantial than that 
served for a dinner. It may be arranged on individual 
plates, or on a large dish and passed that each guest may 
help herself. 

Salads suggested in Lesson VI and made of many other 
fruits and vegetables alone or in combination may be served 



146 COOKING FOR PROFIT 

at a luncheon. Mayonnaise dressing, plain or combined 
with cream, chili sauce, et cetera, may be served. 

Do not serve a fruit salad if a jEirst course of fruit has 
been served. It is not necessary to serve a dessert if a 
fresh fruit salad, or one that has been jellied or frozen 
has been served with a cream or mayonnaise dressing. 

Salad Accompaniments 

Whatever is offered should be something to bring out, 
rather than to overpower, the flavor and seasonings of 
the salad. 

Cheese croquettes — served with salad greens simply dressed 

Cheese balls — served with salad greens simply dressed 

Crackers, thin, unsweetened, buttered, sprinkled with mild paprika, 

and heated. Served with fruit salads. 
Simple sandwiches 

Baking powder biscuits, fresh and hot 
Cheese straws 
Graham bread and butter 

Desserts 

For suggestions for ice cream, cakes, bonbons, et cetera, 
consult previous lessons in this course, and standard cook 
books. Let your ingenuity suggest special decorations for 
the holidays. 

Color and arrangement of whipped cream, frosting, can- 
died fruits, tiny candies, nuts, et cetera, may be made to 
be typical of the special day, as green for St. Patrick, red 
for St. Valentine, and patriotic holidays, heart shapes for 
St. Valentine and engagement luncheons, and so on. 

Bonbons, mints and other candies, the color in keeping 
with the decorations, may be on the table during the 
luncheon and passed after the dessert. Salted nuts may 
be on the table in individual dishes or in two large dishes. 

The coffee may be brought in after the dessert or may 
be served in the drawing room. 



CATERING FOR LUNCHEONS AND SUPPERS 147 

Decorations for Finger Bowls 

Finger bowls, one-fourth full of tepid water, which are 
brought in after the fruit course, or with the dessert plates, 
may be garnished with a few petals from the same flowers 
that are used in the decoration of the table. A few drops 
of rose or violet water are sometimes added. 

Children's Parties 

For children's parties the dishes selected should be suit- 
able to the age of the child. It is a great mistake to serve 
to children such combinations of food as may make them 
ill afterward. 

If the children's party is also a birthday party, special 
pains should be taken to provide a birthday cake with favors 
inside and with the right number of candles blazing on 
the cake. 

Birthday cake boards, round, plain or decorated, with 
space for the cake in the center and holes for candles around 
the edge, may be purchased at many kitchen furnishing 
and other shops. 

Animal crackers dipped in sugar syrup which has been 
cooked to the crack, and then attached to small crackers, 
make an attractive table decoration when formed into a 
procession marching around the table just inside of the 
plates. 

Individual ice creams in animal shapes are always attrac- 
tive. Toys representing stories with which the children 
are familiar are an effective table decoration. Toy balloons 
hanging from the doors, windows and chandeliers of the 
dining room make a pretty effect. Bonbons containing toy 
hats of paper may be at each plate. 

If possible, have something for each child to take home. 
An individual basket of candy, a balloon, a toy of some 



148 COOKING FOR PROFIT 

kind, or a small musical instrument will all give much 
pleasure to the small guest. 

Entertainment for Children's Parties 

It is not easy to give a successful children's party. Many 
<:hildren demand a good deal of entertaining. Practically 
every moment of the afternoon should be planned before- 
hand so games will follow each other smoothly and with 
sufficient variety to prevent restlessness and consequent 
loss of interest. 

There are Mother Goose Parties, and Fairy Story Parties, 
May Parties, Doll Shows, and many other kinds of parties 
which appeal especially to the young members of the neigh- 
borhood. 

Most of the women's magazines issue booklets giving 
suggestions for children's parties and delightful books are 
suggested at the end of this chapter. 

"When is the party going to commence?" You should re- 
member that to a child the party means refreshments, and 
not spend too much time on entertainment before the supper 
is served.

PARE; costs; typical menus 

THERE are many opportunities for women to go 
into a patron's home and prepare dinners for par- 
ties of from two to twenty people. The price charged 
is proportionate to the number served. It should not be less 
than $5.00 and may be $10.00 to $15.00 and is all clear 
profit as suggested in Lesson VII. 

Many people find it more convenient to entertain guests 
at a tea room or hotel than in their own homes, therefore 
the manager of such a business needs to be familiar with 
the service of a formal meal as well as the preparation of 
each course. 

It has become very common for a host or hostess to 
telephone or write ahead to such a place ordering a steak 
or chicken dinner to be served at a definite hour for a 
definite number of guests. If a formal dinner is to be 
served at a tea room or hotel, a private room is desirable 
but this is not required for the informal dinner party. 
A dinner or luncheon at which there are more than twelve 

157 



158 COOKING FOR PROFIT 

guests may be called a banquet. This is usually a more 
formal meal than a dinner and may be followed by speeches. 
Special decorations and music may be provided and at 
the large hotels more than two thousand guests are some- 
times served. 

Table Service and Serving 

For formal luncheons and formal dinners the service is 
practically the same and is known as modified Russian 
service. No food, save nuts and bonbons, is on the table, 
but everything is served from the kitchen and passed to 
or placed before the guests. In a private home one waitress 
cannot satisfactorily serve more than five or six people, 
therefore two waitresses will be needed for most formal 
meals. At hotels one waiter or waitress is provided for 
every eight guests. When the work is very well systemat- 
ized two cooks can serve ten waiters and each waiter can 
serve ten guests. 

A formal dinner table is laid first with a silence cloth, 
covered with a tablecloth, which should hang not less than 
nine inches on all sides. 

A formal luncheon table should be laid with a luncheon 
set, consisting of a centerpiece and doilies, all of the same 
pattern, or with a luncheon cloth. The luncheon cloth 
should reach just to the edge of the table or hang six to 
seven inches below it. If the bare table is used the center- 
piece is laid so that the thread of the linen runs with the 
grain of the wood of the table. 

Place the table decoration in the center, having it low 
or high enough not to obstruct the view across the table. 
Candlesticks and bonbon dishes are placed symmetrically 
about the decoration. The covers are marked by placing 
handsome service plates one inch from the edge of the 



CATERING FOR DINNER PARTIES 159 

table, having them directly opposite each other. The cen- 
ters of the service plates should be twenty-four to thirty 
inches apart. The silver should be placed in the order in 
which it is to be used, beginning on the outside so that 
it will be used toward the plate. The knife or knives are 
placed at the right of the plate, half an inch from the edge 
of the table with cutting edge toward the plate. Place soup 
or bouillon spoon with the bowl facing up at the right of 
knife, teaspoon for fruit cocktail, or fork for oysters or 
clams, at the right of soup spoon. The forks are placed 
at the left, tines turned upward, one-half inch from the 
edge of the table. Do not place more than three forks. If 
more are required, they should be placed with their respec- 
tive courses. 

Goblets for dinner or tumblers for luncheon are placed 
at the tip of the knives. They are filled two-thirds full 
before the meal is announced. They may be replenished 
at right of guest without lifting them from the table. Place 
filled individual nut dishes in front of the service plate, 
place cards either in front or back of nut dishes. 

The napkin, in size from twenty- four to twenty-eight 
inches, is placed at the left of forks, folded square; how- 
ever, if covers are close, they may be folded again to save 
space. If the napkin is monogrammed, it is placed so the 
monogram may be easily read by the person at the table. 
A luncheon napkin may be folded in three-cornered shape. 
If napkin has an embroidered letter, it should be placed 
with the point of the napkin toward the plate. If there is 
no initial, place the long edge of the napkin parallel with 
the fork. 

Butter is not served at a formal dinner, or a very formal 
luncheon, but is used at informal meals. A bread and 
butter plate is placed above the service plate and a little 
to the left with the butter spreader across the upper right 



160 COOKING FOR PROFIT 

hand side with the blade turned toward the center of the 
plate. If no butter is served the knife is not used but the 
plate may be used for radishes, olives, bread, etc. The plate 
may be omitted and small baskets, as favors, filled with 
candies, may be placed above the forks. 

Salts and peppers are placed between each two covers. 
If an open salt cellar is used, place the salt spoon across the 
top or on the doily beside it. 

After the meal is announced and guests are seated the 
head waitress starts with the hostess and serves to the right, 
including the host; the assisting waitress starts with the 
lady guest of honor at the right of the host and serves to 
the right. 

Everything except beverages and extra silver are placed 
by the waitress from the left of the guest. A napkin 
squarely folded, or a serviette, should be used under all 
dishes of food to be passed. 

Formal Dinner Service 

First Course : A formal dinner menu generally consists 
of a beginning such as canape, oysters or clams on the 
half shell, or a fruit cocktail, and this first course is on 
the table when the guests come to the dining room. 

Other Courses: The first course is removed from the 
table by the waitress with the left hand from the left of 
each person before the soup is placed. The soup is served 
next from the pantry in filled soup plates and with the 
left hand placed on the service plate. One waitress then 
passes the crackers and the other follows with the olives 
and celery, etc. 

The service plates, and soup plates with silver are then 
replaced by the warm plates for fish or entree. Jf the 
plate is empty, it is placed with the right hand; if filled, 



CATERING FOR DINNER PARTIES . 161 

with the left hand to avoid accident, If empty plates are 
placed, the fish or entree is passed by the head waitress 
from the left on a platter held on a folded napkin in the 
waitress's left hand and balanced with the right. The 
serving silver should be so placed that guests can easily 
serve themselves. 

When this course is finished, the fish or entree plates 
with silver are removed with the left hand, and the empty 
warm meat plates placed immediately with the right hand. 

The head waitress serves the meat (previously carved), 
beginning with the hostess, to everyone at the table, and 
the second waitress follows with the first vegetable. The 
head waitress then passes the second vegetable and the 
second waitress follows with the rolls. Serving silver 
should be on the platter and vegetable dishes. 

At a banquet or informal meal the meat and vegetable 
may be on the plates when they are placed, or the main 
dish nicely garnished may be carved and put on plates by 
the host and passed by the waitress. 

The next course may be an entree but is usually a salad. 
It may be served on the plate, or empty plates may be 
placed and the salad passed by the head waitress on a 
platter with serving silver, the assisting waitress following 
with the accompaniment of dressing, crackers, cheese 
balls, etc. 

After the salad, plates and silver are removed, the bread 
and butter plates if used, and the salt and pepper shakers. 

The table is then crumbed, using a plate and folded nap- 
kin, forefinger placed in fold, three fingers on outside of 
napkin. 

Dessert. Dessert plates are next placed with the left 
hand. The silver may be on the dishes or may be brought 
in by one of the waitresses on a folded napkin and placed 



162 COOKING FOR PROFIT 

at the right. If the dessert is not on the plates, the mold, 
already cut, is passed with serving silver in place. Small 
cakes are then passed and finger bowls placed on a small 
plate covered with a doily are placed on table above the 
ice cream dish a little to the left. The bonbon dishes are 
then taken from the table by each waitress, passed to guests, 
and placed again on opposite ends of the table. 

Coffee is served in the drawing room or at the table; 
the cups two-thirds full are placed on a doily covered tray, 
with the spoons placed on saucers so that handles run 
parallel to handles of the cups. This tray is passed by 
one waitress. The other waitress follows, serving cream 
and sugar on a doily covered tray, the handle of tongs 
beside bowl running parallel with the handle of the pitcher. 
If the coffee is served at the table she places the cup at 
the right of each guest. 

The same method is used in serving a larger number of 
people, whether at the same table or at several tables. 
There must be enough people in the kitchen to place the 
food on the serving plates or platters, and great care must 
be taken that hot things are served hot, and cold things, 
cold, and everything as daintily and attractively as possible. 

Canapes and Other First Courses 

The first course of a formal dinner may be a canape, 
shell fish in some form, a half grapefruit, a fruit cocktail 
or assorted hors d'oeuvres. A canape is a piece of bread 
cut one-fourth inch thick, delicately toasted and spread 
with butter highly seasoned with one or more of the fol- 
lowing ingredients: 

Anchovy essence or paste. 
Lemon juice. 
Sardine paste. 



CATERING FOR DINNER PARTIES 163 

Chopped olives, pickles, capers, and parsley. 
Mustard or 
Table sauce. 

Upon the savory butter is usually arranged in an orderly 
manner caviar or small pieces of shell fish, canned fish or 
smoked fish and the top is garnished with hard cooked 
eggs, capers, pickles, olives or pimiento as the fancy dic- 
tates. The effect of the whole should be a dainty picture 
as it rests on a small fancy plate on the service plate. 

Oysters on the half shell are a popular first course, served 
on a bed of crushed ice in a soup plate on the service plate. 
A small glass of cocktail sauce may be in the center of 
the plate. Lemon cut in quarters and a bit of parsley is 
used as a garnish. 

Little neck clams on the half shell, pieces of lobster or 
crab meat or whole shrimps on heart leaves of lettuce or 
parboiled scallops on a small scallop shell may be served on 
ice instead of oysters, or the fish, covered with cocktail 
sauce, may be served in a glass surrounded with crushed 
ice. 

Cocktail sauces may be purchased ready mixed or the 
following may be used: 

Cocktail Sauce 

Mix 
I teaspoon salt 
% teaspoon pepper 
I teaspoon chopped parsley 

1 teaspoon chives, finely cut 
H teaspoon salad oil

A slice of Italian sausage 
A small stalk of celery raw or braised, with a savory stuffing in 

the groove 
^ of a lemon and a sprig of parsley as a garnish. 

A fruit cocktil may be served instead of a fish cocktail. Sugges- 
tions for these are given in lesson VII. A dinner roll, or 
small crackers are a suitable accompaniment for this course. 

Soups 

A soup is always served at a formal dinner. It may be 
a clear soup, like a consomme with a garnish of dainty bits 
of vegetable, royal custard cut in fancy shapes, macaroni 
or other paste in small pieces, bits of chicken or delicate 
quenelles. An oyster, clam, lobster, or vegetable bisque 
may be served instead of the consomme especially if a 
canape takes the place of an oyster course. Mock turtle, 
green turtle or any nice soup not too rich or thick may 
be used. For informal meals cream soups are popular. 

Accompaniments may be bread sticks, delicately toasted 
strips or triangles of toast, small rolls or crackers. 

Fish 

A fish course or an entree may follow the soup course. 
Both used to be considered necessary but now both are 
frequently omitted. It should be of a color and flavor in 
contrast with the soup. The fish should be so prepared 
that it can be easily taken from the platter or it may be 
served in the kitchen directly onto the fish plates. It 
should be as far as possible free from bones, surrounded 
or covered with a rich, well flavored sauce, and garnished 
with lemon or parsley, with fancy potatoes, cucumbers, 
tomatoes, etc. 



CATERING FOR DINNER PARTIES 165 

A few suggested fish dishes, recipes for which may be 
found in most cook books, are 

Baked stuffed smelts with Bernaise Sauce 

Smelts a la Langtry with Aurora Sauce 

Baked fillets of halibut or flounder with Hollandaise, Tartare, 

Lobster, Cheese or Mushroom sauce 
Molded fish, Normandy sauce 
Fried fillets of halibut or flounder or fried smelts, scallops or 

lobster with Sauce Tartare 
Terrapin 

Lobster or oyster patties 
Crab Meat Mornay 

Halibut Veronique (with white grapes) 
Stuffed turbans of flounder 

Fillets of sole with oysters or clams, white sauce and cheese 
Baked shad, roe sauce 

In recipes which call for wine, lemon juice to flavor or 
a little Worcestershire sauce and white or fish stock may 
be used instead. 

Entrees — Croquettes 

The entree should be a contrast in flavor and color to 
the courses that precede and follow it and may consist of 
a patty case, vol au vent, or timbale case containing creamed 
sweetbreads or mushrooms, or it may be an egg or mush- 
room croquette, timbale or souffle, braised sweetbreads, an 
egg dish, or a fancy vegetable such as mushrooms under 
glass or asparagus Mousselaine. 

Sometimes a sweet entree is served, for example a fritter 
or rice with fruit, but this generally accompanies the meat 
course and is not often served by itself.

Deep Fat. Put caps on stems and arrange on platter covered with 

a doiley. 

Meat Course 

The meat course at a dinner is almost always a roast or 
poultry or game in some form. It is usually carved in the 
kitchen and should be attractively placed on the platter or 
serving plate. Among the most suitable meats are 

Roast Beef Roast turkey 

Larded fillet of beef Roast chicken 

Beef steak Boned chicken stuffed and roasted 

Planked steak Broiled chicken 

Saddle of lamb Planked boned chicken 

Crown of lamb Roast duckling 

Roast leg of lamb Broiled duckling 

Saddle of veal Roast squab 

Stuffed cushion of veal Broiled squab 

Planked Steak 

10 potatoes, boil, pare and mash. Add 
% cup butter 

6 t.gg yolks slightly beaten 
iy2 teaspoons salt, and 

Milk to moisten. Beat until very light. Grease a plank to keep 
it from burning, put on a border of the potato, using pastry 
bag and tube, and put in hot oven until lightly browned. Wipe 
2y2 lb. Porterhouse steak and remove superfluous fat; the bone 
may or may not be removed, as preferred. Heat and grease 
a heavy frying pan; when hissing hot, put in steak, turn very 
often until seared on both sides, then occasionally until steak 
is cooked. Cream 
% cup butter, add 
I tablespoon pimiento, chopped 
I tablespoon parsley, chopped 
I teaspoon onion juice. Place steak in center of plank, spread 

with creamed butter and arrange 
8 small onions, glazed

I small bunch cooked asparagus 
M cup cooked carrot balls 
}i cup cooked turnip cones 
I cup cooked peas and 

I cup cooked string beans on the plank between the steak and 
potato border. Put in oven for a moment to be sure that 
everything is very hot; pour 
Hollandaise Sauce over the asparagus, place plank in holder and 
send to the table immediately. 

Stuffed peppers, stuffed tomatoes, stuffed onions, pimien- 
tos stuffed with eggplant, flowerets of cauliflower or spinach 
timbals may be used on a planked steak. 

A planked steak should be brought to the dining room 
before it is carved and may, after being shown, be served 
by the host or by the waiter. It should serve four people. 

Vegetables 

The potatoes and vegetables suggested for luncheons in 
Lesson VII may also be used at dinners. 

An especially nice vegetable like mushrooms, fresh as- 
paragus or French artichokes may be served as a course by 
itself, following the meat course. 

A sherbet or water ice is sometimes served with a roast 
at a hotel or a very formal dinner or banquet. It should 
be one that goes especially well with the meat, as cranberry 
ice with chicken or turkey, or mint sherbet with lamb. 

Accompaniments for Meat 

Such accompaniments and sauces as belong with certain 
meats should be served with them. For example, with 

Roast Beef — Yorkshire pudding 
Horseradish sauce 
Mushroom sauce 

Beef Steak — Maitre d'Hotel butter 
Mushroom sauce 
Oyster blanket 

Hollandaise sauce with variations

Dinner Salads 

Many of the salads suggested as luncheon salads may be

green salad with a well flavored French dressing. For the 
salad may be used 

Lettuce separated as usual or 

California or Iceland lettuce cut in halves or quarters 

Romaine heads cut in halves

Desserts 

A frozen dessert is most frequently served at a formal 
dinner or a banquet. Suggestions may be found in Lesson 
VI, in many cook books and on hotel menus. Individual 
molded ices in a nest of spun sugar are always popular and 
in good taste. 

Small cakes, macaroons, lady fingers, or pieces of pound, 
sponge, or angel cake should be serv^ed with the ice cream. 

Directions for making coffee are found in Lesson VI. 
It is served clear in small cups. Cream and loaf sugar are 
passed with it. 

Directions for making bonbons and salted nuts are found 
in Lesson V. 



CATERING FOR DINNER PARTIES 171 

How Much to Prepare 

A famous chef explaining his system of preparing and 
serving banquets said that before each banquet he or his 
assistant conducted a demonstration. He showed the size 
of portion and how it should be dished up, so as to be 
most attractive and most economical. In this way he gauged 
the quantity for each person and then multiplied by the 
number to be served. You should work on a guarantee of 
so many covers and prepare enough food for that number 
of people. In that way everyone is served and very little 
is left over. 

The allowance may be as follows : 

I gallon soup — 17 guests 

I gallon vegetables — 40 guests 

I gallon sauce — 80 guests 

%. lb. fish — each guest 

I duckling — 6 guests 

Some other quantities are given on page 99. 

If you are asked to plan a meal for a definite number of 
people at a definite price it is wise to make out a tentative 
menu and then make a list of the ingredients of the dishes 
you must serve, not forgetting coffee, cream, sugar, bread, 
butter, main dish, etc. ; after each article put in the amount 
required, figuring from what you know. For instance if 
you use the amounts for four people when your fist is com- 
plete divide by four and multiply by the number to be 
served. Put the cost of each article in a column after the 
amount required. When you have found the cost of most 
of the things you must have, add the totals and find out 
how much you have left for extras or whether the menu 
must be changed one way or another to be within the price 
quoted.

may use your knowledge in managing a so-called 
boarding house or if you have had hotel or other catering 
experience you may take charge *of a small hotel. In some 
places you may do all or part of the cooking or you may 
supervise and direct without doing any cooking at all. 
Whether you cook or not the more knowledge you have

Names 

Common usage has made the terms boarding house and 
boarder unattractive. You do not wish to "run a boarding 
house" or "keep boarders," but many people cannot have 
their own homes and must be "paying guests." The term 
"guest house" has been introduced here as a substitute. 
The word hotel usually implies bellboy service, considerable 
style and pretension and transient guests. You may call 
your establishment an inn, tavern, home, camp, club, lodge, 
guest house, or the like. It is desirable to have a name 
such as the Lincoln Tavern, Shirley Inn, Harvard Camp, 
Hilldale Farm, Oakhaven, Elmhurst, Hadley Guest House, 
Women's City Club, Longfellow Hall, West House, Stu- 
dent's Union, Hemlock Manor, Two Acres, The Gables, 
Lake View Lodge, or the like.

GUEST HOUSE MANAGEMENT 179 

Choose for your guests the class of people you can most 
acceptably feed or house or those for whom no provision 
is being made. 

Homes and Camps 

A' home for nervous, tired women should meet a need 
in some towns. Well balanced attractive meals and break- 
fast in bed if desired, would be the popular feature. An 
inn which cares for children while their parents are away 
is a boon to mothers who must work. It provides special 
children's meals, and a nurse or kindergartner to super- 
vise their play„ their naps, and their out-of-door activities. 

The students' home for boys or girls or for young men 
or women should be an attractive place with a home atmos- 
phere, an abundance of well cooked food and a person at 
the head who understands the food needs of growing chil- 
dren and can "mother" and chaperone the young people 
when they require it. 

The summer camp should serve real country cream, plenty 
of rich milk and fresh fruit, berries and vegetables and not 
too much meat. Houses in districts that are famous for 
some particular kind of food should endeavor to feature 
it on their menus. 

Institutions 

An institution is usually a home where some particular 
type of person is cared for and where special needs must 
be met. The officers' table of an institution is like that of 
a high class guest house. In the dining rooms for inmates 
and help, less expensive foods are used, but the meals should 
be carefully planned and as attractive as possible. 

The Hotel 

To be successful in the hotel business one should work 
up from a minor position until familiar with all departments 



180 COOKING FOR PROFIT 

of the hotel. In addition to the guests who stay in the 
house, most hotels must cater to outsiders who come in for 
occasional meals and the manager must be prepared to serve 
special luncheons, dinners and banquets for private parties, 
clubs and other organizations. 

In most hotels, chefs are employed who are in charge of 
the kitchen and the kitchen force but a small hotel may 
have a woman cook and in some instances she may be the 
wife of the proprietor or even the owner of the hotel. 

Hotel meals differ from family meals in that there may 
be a choice of two or more dishes for each course. Menu 
cards are provided which may be printed on a small press 
owned and operated in the hotel or they may be printed 
forms filled in each day on the typewriter or with pen and 
ink or they may be printed outside and sent in daily. There 
may be a regular a la carte menu with a special menu at- 
tached each day. Many people get tired reading a long 
menu; it is better to have few things and have them de- 
liciously cooked and the menu changed daily than to have 
more dishes and a sameness about it eachi day. You may 
make a collection of menu cards, as you go about, and on 
your own cards embody the good points and eliminate the 
bad points as you see them. 

Planning Meals 

Hotel menus are more or less standardized all over the 
world. What one gets in one city is very like what one 
finds on the menu card on the other side of the continent. 
The hotel that provides different and especially fine food is 
likely to build up a reputation that will mean profit for the 
dining room, and cause people to come from near and far 
for your special dishes. One hundred miles is not too long 
a distance to motor for an especially good dinner or a week- 
end party. 



GUEST HOUSE MANAGEMENT 181 

Quality of Food 

No matter how delightfully situated your hotel or guest 
house or how artistically and beautifully furnished, people 
will not crowd your doors if the food is not first class. 
Quality of food is of far more importance than is sometimes 
realized although cleanliness and service should receive equal 
consideration. The greatest attention must be paid to every 
detail, every source of waste, every wish of the patrons if 
one is to make a profit. 

How TO Plan Meals 

Since the planning of meals is a most important duty 
of thd manager of a guest house, a small hotel, a college, 
school or institution dining room, it is well to make a special 
study of the best methods to follow. 

There are many excellent books to study in order that 
you may know how to best meet the needs of the particular 
group of people who will live with you. You will find that 
the character of your menus should be determined by 

the age of your guests 

their sex 

their occupation 

the amount they pay 

their inherited tastes 

their food habits 

their likes and dislikes 

the time of day that meals are served 

the ability of the cook 

the amount of help in the kitchen 

the location of your house, whether in town or country 

the season of the year 

the nature of your equipment 

the method of service whether 
with waitresses 

family style, the hostess serving 
cafeteria style. 



182 COOKING FOR PROFIT 

All these things will make a difference in the type of meal 
you are to serve. For instance if the guests are women of 
leisure who are paying a large amount of money for their 
meals they will require an entirely different food and serv- 
ice from hard working men, or school boys or girls who 
can pay very little, but the fundamental principle of bal- 
anced meals should hold good in any case. 

Needs of the Body 

A well planned meal should supply: 

Fuel foods to furnish heat and energy for the activities 
of the body; these are foods rich in starch, sugar, 
and fat. 
Building foods to supply material for the growth^ and 
repair of body tissue; these are the protein foods, 
meat, fish, eggs, milk, cheese, beans, etc.; 
Foods containing mineral salts and vitamines and 
which furnish bulk or ''roughage" that so regulate 
the vital processes as to conserve health ; these are 
vegetables, fruits, milk and whole grains. 
In general all natural foods are building foods, as they all 
contain some protein and mineral salts, and all foods can 
serve as fuel. The extra refined foods like granulated sugar, 
corn starch, lard, lard substitutes and salad oils are fuel 
foods only. Fats have 2% times the fuel value of starch, 
sugar or protein per ounce or pound. 

The ''food unit" is the calorie, which indicates the fuel 
value, and the number of calories required depends on the 
age, weight, and especially the physical activity of the person 
in question. Three to four thousand calories per day are 
needed by the hard working man and active school boys. 
Men at sedentary occupations, women and girls require less 
— 2,000 to 3,000 calories. The appetite is a good guide as to 
the amount of food that people require, and a sufficient 
amount of the right kinds of food must be supplied to fill 
the demands of the appetite of the guests but not to stuff 
them to repletion. 



GUEST HOUSE MANAGEMENT 183 

What Constitutes a Well Balanced Menu 

In general the daily menus for each person should be 
composed of 

generous amounts of fruit and vegetables 

Yz pii^t or more of milk per day per person 

usually not more than ^ to ^ pound of meat or other 

protein food 
a sufficient amount of starch, sugar and fat to supply 
the required number of calories and to make the 
meals palatable. 
It is a common mistake to use too large amounts of 
cereal products, sugar and meat with too small amounts of 
fruit and vegetables and milk. 

The above foodstuffs, fruit, vegetables, milk, meat and 
fish or meat substitutes, bread and butter and sweets must 
be so combined as to make palatable and appetizing and in- 
teresting meals that do not become monotonous and that 
serve to keep your people in good health with plenty of 
pep, vitality and force. 

When to Serve What 

Fruit should be served two or three times a day, for 
instance at breakfast and at one of the other meals either 
in or for dessert, in a fruit salad,' as a cocktail, as a preserve 
or as spiced fruit with meat. 

The vegetables should include from one-half to three- 
fourths of a pound or more of potatoes which may be 
served at dinner and may also be used at the other meals 
if desired; one green and one root vegetable at dinner and 
one or two vegetables at luncheon or supper. 

The meat that is served may be used chiefly at dinner. 
There may be leftovers that can be served at breakfast or 
luncheon, but it should not often be necessary to buy meat 
for luncheon as meat substitutes may be used at this meal. 
If you buy meat for breakfast it may be bacon, dried beef. 



184 COOKING FOR PROFIT 

fish, ham or sausages. Steaks and chops are not necessary, 
although you may have to serve them under some conditions. 

Eggs may be used as freely as the price allows, for break- 
fast or luncheon and in cooking. 

MUk to drink, top milk, thin cream and whipped cream 
served with cereals and desserts, and skimmed milk used in 
soups, sauces and desserts will use up the amount of milk 
suggested. 

Bread in some form should be served at every meal and 
there is enough variety with rolls, muffins, griddle cakes, 
toasts and waffles to prevent monotony. 

Cereals, preferably the coarse kinds which supply vita- 
mines and mineral salts not present in white bread, should 
be used freely. 

Fats — ten ounces of butter or less per week per person 
for the table, oil for salad dressings, margarine and other 
fats used in cooking will supply all the fat needed in the 
diet. All fats that accumulate from cooking meat, soup, 
stock, etc., should be used in cooking or saved for soap. 

Sugar will be used in desserts and on the table and will 
average from one to one and one-half pounds a week per 
person. 

Coffee may make or mar the reputation of your house. 
You must have good coffee with good cream for breakfast 
unless your guests are children. Have it good under dl 
circumstances! If the coffee is poor the whole house will 
suffer. Have hot milk available for those who like it in 
their coffee and cereal coffee, tea, cocoa, or milk for those 
who do not take coffee. 

Three Meals a Day 

Breakfast 

The first meal of the day should be planned to suit the 
season of the year as far as possible. It should consist of 



GUEST HOUSE MANAGEMENT 185 

seasonable fruit, raw or cooked 

a choice between cooked and ready-to-eat cereal 

bread in some form 

eggs, bacon, fish or a made-over dish 

coffee or other beverage 

Dinner 

Dinner may consist of soup or chowder followed by the 
main meat course which may be steak, roast, smoked meat, 
corned meat, casserole of meat or fish of some kind. Whether 
or not you serve a choice of meats will depend on the 
number of people you are serving. It- may be profitable to 
have two kinds of meat or meat and fish from which they 
can choose. When serving fish as a main dish it is wise to 
have meat on hand for those who do not care for fish. 
With a small number of guests who do not pay a large 
amount for board it will not be wise to offer much choice. 
With meat serve gravy, potatoes and at least one hot vege- 
table. A relish, such as pickle, jelly, apple sauce, and the 
like is a pleasing addition. 

Serve some sort of salad daily either at this meal or at 
luncheon or supper or both so that the people will get some 
uncooked green; serve such desserts as your guests like, as 
well as those that are best for them. With some people a 
cold or frozen dessert is almost necessary, with other groups 
you may have to serve pie almost every day or simple milk 
puddings or fruit. There may be a choice of two or three 
desserts each day. 

Bread or rolls should be provided and coffee or tea or 
both. Such extras as are suggested in Part VIII may be 
added at your discretion. 

The time of serving dinner is determined by custom or 
the habits, age or occupation of your guests. It may be 
served at noon but is more commonly served from six to 
eight o'clock in the evening. 

The first course and the last course should be especially 



186 COOKING FOR PROFIT 

pleasing; the first to create an appetite and pleasure in the 
meal ; the last that guests may carry away a good impression. 

Luncheon or Supper 

The third meal of the day may be served at noon and be 
called luncheon or served at night and be called supper. 
This will depend, of course, on when dinner is served. In 
some houses guests do not come home at noon and a third 
meal need not be prepared except for the help. At luncheon 
or supper the food is used which is left over necessarily 
from some dinner dishes, although left-over meat may some- 
times be used for another dinner in another form. There 
may be a soup or chowder, one or more hot dishes, vege- 
tables, rolls, biscuit or muffins, salad, dessert and a beverage. 
Among the main dishes from which one may choose are 

Croquettes 

Scalloped dishes 

Stuffed peppers 

Beans baked and in other ways 

Cheese dishes 

Fish in various ways 

Egg dishes 

Salads of tgg, meat, or fish 

The luncheon dessert may be of fruit, fresh or cooked, 
cake, pudding, pie, fruit salad with wafers, custards, etc. 

The following are typical of the table d'hote meals at a 
hotel where there is a choice of dishes : 

Breakfast, 85 Cents 

grapefruit or stewed fresh plums 

cream of wheat, oatmeal and cream or grape nuts 

fried or boiled eggs

BRAIDES CELERY KNOB POTATOES FONDANT

AND DUNDAE CAKE 

DEMI TASSE 

This is not reverting to the old-style, American plan, for 
the reason that the little word "or" prevents a v^ricked waste 
of food that unlimited selection entailed. 

Left-Overs 

The use of left-overs is most important as it is one of the 
things that will help to make your guest house a financial 
success. It is a good practice for the manager each morn- 
ing soon after breakfast to look over the contents of the 
refrigerators, the fresh fruit and vegetable store closet and 
cake and bread boxes and to plan for the immediate use 
of any supplies that will not keep well. Soups, salads, 
croquettes, and other made dishes, crumb cakes and cookies 
will suggest themselves to the person of imagination who is 



188 COOKING FOR PROFIT 

familiar with the recipes for a large number of dishes. 
Foods should be used so intelligently that neither guests 
nor help will realize that they are being served with left- 
overs, but nothing except food left on guests' plates should 
be wasted. After some experience meals may be planned 
so that there will not be great amounts of left-overs to be 
used up, but no good foodstuff should be allowed to spoil 
or be thrown away. 

Menu Lists 

The planning of meals is very greatly simplified by hav- 
ing lists of dishes from which to select, not like an index 
in the back of a cook book, but such dishes as meet the 
needs of your particular family, those you can afford to 
serve, and dishes that your people like. 

Lists for different occasions have been given in previous 
lessons and many dishes if not whole lists may be used in 
these guest house lists which should have as headings 

1 Breakfast fruit 24 Hot sandwiches 

2 Breakfast cereals 25 Potatoes 

3 Breads for breakfast 26 Sweet potatoes 

4 Breads for luncheon 27 Spring and summer vege- 

5 Breakfast eggs and other tables 

main dishes for breakfast 28 Fall and winter vegetables 

6 Clear soups 29 Vegetable dishes for luncheon 

7 Cream soups 30 Salads with protein (meat, 

8 Chowders fish, cheese, etc.) 

9 Soup accompaniments 31 Salads with vegetables 

10 Beef 32 Salads with fruit 

11 Lamb 33 Dressings for lettuce, etc. 

12 Pork and ham 34 Sweet entrees (fritters, etc.) 

13 Veal 35 Puddings 

14 Poultry Z'^ Pudding sauces 

15 Fish Z7 Frozen desserts 

16 Meat sundries 38 Cold desserts 

17 Meat substitutes 39 Pies 

18 Relishes for main course 40 Winter fruit desserts (canned 

19 Made over dishes with meat preserved, etc.) 

20 Made over dishes with eggs 41 Summer fruit desserts 

21 Made over dishes with fish 42 Cakes 

22 Cheese dishes 43 Cookies 

23 Macaroni and other starchy 

dishes 



GUEST HOUSE MANAGEMENT 189 

It is wise also to have lists of dishes that can be made 
from left-overs, for example 

Dishes with Sour Cream 

Salad dressing 

Muffins 

Luncheon cake 

Ice cream (if cream is not very sour) 

Griddle cakes 

Waffles 

To moisten Cottage Cheese, etc. 

Dishes with Left-over Cereal 

Cereal muffins 
Oatmeal bread 
Oatmeal soup 
Rice and cheese 
Rice custard 
Rice and tomato 
Stuffing for peppers 
Croquettes 
Fried hominy- 
Tomato soup with macaroni 

Have one or more pages in a large note book, or a large 
card or sheet of paper, for each list. Have columns on 
the right of the list for each month; figures indicate the 
day of the month on which the dish is served. At left 
of the list of dishes, use as many headings as you like, 
such as page of Cook Book where recipe is found, number 
of people served by the recipe, the amount of food stuff 
to be used for it, as pounds of cereal or meat, number of 
times to increase the recipe for your family or amount for 
one serving; there may be a column for the cost or the 
food value or the selling price of the dish. 

With these lists at hand it is not a difficult task to plan 
menus for a week or a month in advance with very little 
repetition. 

Your Menu Book 

For your menus have a note book of about the size that 
stenographers use and a page dated for each day with 



190 



COOKING FOR PROFIT 

PAGE OF MENU BOOK 



Sunday, March 6th 
Breakfast 



Luncheon 



Dinner 



Spaces headed breakfast, luncheon or dinner, and dinner or 
supper. 

Planning Dinner Menus 

From your Hst select first and enter in your menu book 
the dinner meat or fish that you will serve on the first 
day for which you are planning ahead, then the second 
day and so on. When you have entered roast lamb for 
example in your menu book, place in the column for that 
month on your list the day of the month on which you are 
to serve it so that when you have finished your menus, on 
the list of lamb dishes for instance, the column under each 
month will show the dates on which was served roast lamb, 
lamb chops, lamb chartreuse, lamb stew, and any other lamb 
dish. 

When the meats have been entered for the week^s din- 
ners, enter the potatoes and vegetables that go best with

Planning Other Meals 

Next you can plan your lunches or suppers using up left 
overs if you can anticipate what they are going to be. If 
you cannot tell ahead leave the place open and decide about 
it later. Next enter the breakfast fruit for the week or 
month, then the cereals, then the luncheon and dinner 
desserts and salads using fruit in one or the other meal, 
both if you like but not the same fruit that you serve for 
breakfast. Desserts need not be repeated in two months. 
Next enter the luncheon breads and plan the breakfast 
breads at the same time to prevent duplication and also, so 
that you may perhaps use the same dough you make 
luncheon rolls from, with a change of shape or flavor, for 



192 COOKING FOR PROFIT 

the breakfast buns. From your lists continue until every 
meal is complete, with relishes, pudding sauces, etc. 

Contrast and Harmony in Meals 
The courses and dishes in a meal should be varied in 
their character as hot and cold, soft and crisp, dark and 
light. Avoid colors that clash, as beets and tomatoes; too 
much water, as clear soup and jelly at the same meal. Use 
sauces with tasteless and colorless foods. Do not use the 
same food more than once during the day if it is a food 
of distinctive flavor. 

Plan special meals for special occasions as birthdays and 
holidays. Use seasonable foods abundantly in their season, 
using your lists of ''special dishes to be served at different 
seasons of the year." With these lists it is possible to 
secure great variety in menus with little effort. Add to 
your lists such new dishes as your people will like and 
cross off those that are not popular. 

Variety in Meals 

Variety with a big V is of the greatest importance when 
you are catering for the same group of people day after 
day. It is no wiser to serve a thing that they like too 
often than to serve something that is not very popular. 
Do not have a definite day. for special dishes even though 
it be chicken and ice cream or corned beef and canned 
peaches. Surprises are of great value in maintaining 
interest in your table and pleasure in your meals. You 
cannot please all the people all the time, but if good whole- 
some food and well balanced meals are provided the health 
of your guests will be better than if rich and indigestible 
though popular dishes are supplied too abundantly. 

The most carefully planned menus will not be satisfac- 
tory unless food is attractively served, unless it looks well, 
and tastes good. Careful cooking is of great importance 
as well as correct seasoning. To men serve generous portions 



GUEST HOUSE MANAGEMENT 193 

and hearty foods. Women and girls as a rule prefer more 
fruit and salads, smaller amounts and greater variety. 

If possible do not serve a second time foods that are 
universally unpopular and of which the portions were 
left on the plates and wasted. Cross these dishes off 
your list or prepare them differently. Do not make it 
necessary for people to eat things they do not like. 

The Cook's Menu Book 
A menu book should hang in the kitchen where it may 
be consulted by the cooks at any time. This need not be 
the book in which you make out menus for a week or 
more in advance as those menus frequently have to be 
changed to use up left-overs or because certain foods come 
into market or are not in market or . fail to arrive in time 
to be used. The menus for the cook should be posted if 
possible two days before they are to be served as some 
dishes need to be started twenty-four hours or more in 
advance of a meal. 

How TO Buy 

If menus are planned a month in advance and you know 
approximately how many meals you will serve, an order 
for groceries and non-perishable supplies can be given for 
the entire month with little or no need for ordering goods 
of that type for another thirty days. Naturally this saves 
much time and worry. All supplies must be checked up as 
soon as they arrive and be put away where they will be 
safe from theft, mice, and spoilage. It is efficient to have 
to do this for groceries only once a month. 

Canned goods should be bought by the case and may 
be ordered in the spring for a year ahead to be delivered 
as needed. No. lo cans of most fruits and some vegetdbles 
are satisfactory for large families. It is a help to consult 
a wholesale grocers' catalogue and price list when making 
out the grocery order. Keep a variety of seasonings on 



194 COOKING FOR PROFIT 

hand to vary the flavor of your dishes; buy cherries, ange- 
lica, nuts, etc., for garnishing. Buying in original packages 
saves expense if the stuff can be used before it spoils. 

Order perishable supplies twice a week, or oftener, and a 
day before needing them. With good refrigerators most 
foods will keep well several days. It is a good policy to 
deal at the same; markets regularly. If dealers know that 
you depend on them for most of your buying they will 
take particular pains to send you the quality of supplies 
that you need and, if they issue them, will mail you weekly 
price lists. Try to buy in sufficiently large quantities to 
secure wholesale prices. Vegetables and fruits are cheaper 
in original packages, but the amount you should buy will 
depend on the number of people you are feeding, your 
storage space and distance from the market. 

Eggs may be purchased in April. Your dealer will 
store them and deliver as required or you can put them 
down in water glass. 

Butter for the year may be purchased in June and kept 
in storage. Be sure always to serve good butter. If you 
cannot secure or cannot aflford good butter, use a good 
margarine which is better than poor butter. 

The amounts to be ordered of food stuffs depend on so 
many things that it is impossible to give any special quan- 
tities. The number of guests, their food requirements, 
storage space, etc., make each person's order different from 
every other. After the first few orders it is not difficult 
to plan your orders so that you will have enough, yet no 
waste. Keep accurate record of all supplies that are ordered 
and the price. 

The sample page of my order book, used when prices 
were lower than they are now, shows how a book may be 
kept. Between 150 and 200 people were being fed. The 
names indicate dealer so bills can be easily checked up.

Storerooms 

A storeroom should be light and well ventilated with an 
abundance of shelves of the correct width and height to 
hold the things that will be put on them. For instance, 
shelves for canned goods may be wide enough to hold 
two or three cans deep and two cans high with no waste 
space. Shelves for extracts, seasonings, etc., may be nar- 
row. Never place one thing in front of another different 
thing. It is inefficient to have to move things to find some- 
thing that is wanted. Have covered receptacles, moisture 
and mouse proof, for bulk cereals, tea and coffee. Have 
• a refrigerator that is well constructed and large enough 
for your needs. 

Kitchen Equipment 

It is impossible to give here a complete list of the 
kitchen equipment required for a boarding house or a 
hotel. There are large firms whose business it is to supply 
everything necessary from cellar to garret. It will be best 
for you to visit as many establishments as you can, send 
for catalogs and, knowing how much money you wish to 
invest, decide for yourself how best to spend it. The 
equipment required differs with the number and class of 
people to be fed. One hundred to two hundred people 
can be fed with simple meals with a large double range, 
a bake oven with four or five shelves, cook's tables with 
rack overhead for utensils, large boilers of tin, copper or 
enamelware, large roasting pans that fit range ovens, agate 
pans for baking puddings, apples, etc., of size to fit bake 
oven shelves, food chopper, bread mixer, bread slicer and 
such other utensils as are found in home kitchens, but of 
larger size or in larger numbers. For a larger number of 
people it will be necessary to install a steam table, steam 
kettle for vegetables, soups, etc., power ice cream freezer, 



GUEST HOUSE MANAGEMENT 197 

power mixing machine, dish washer, bain marie, broiler, 
vegetable parer, meat sheer. 

Service 

The method of service makes a difference in the amount 
that you must charge for meals and the amount of profit 
that you will make. You may have waitresses and the serv- 
ing done as explained in Lesson VIII. In a small guest 
house the' hostess may sit at the table, do the carving and 
serving and have a waitress to take the filled plates to 
each guest. In a large establishment or institution, cafe- 
teria style may be employed. This method of serving will 
be fully explained in Lesson XII. It is more economical 
for the proprietor if food is put on the individual plates 
than if platters and serving dishes are passed or put on 
the table, where guests may help themselves to as much 
as they wish. 

Where people pay by the week a second order of the 
main dish and vegetable should be allowed and all the 
bread and butter that anyone wishes. Fruit, soup, salad, 
and dessert courses may well be limited to one serving each. 
In a hotel, people are expected to pay for extra orders of 
anything. 

Overhead Costs 

The overhead expense of running the guest house or 
hotel may be estimated as suggested in Lesson I. It is 
usually possible to separate the cost of serving meals and 
the cost of rooms. It is absolutely essential that you know 
the overhead cost of doing business in order that you may 
know whether you are making or losing money. 

The price charged for meals must cover 

1 Rent of kitchen 

2 Rent of dining room 

3 Rent of hall or public parlor 



198 COOKING FOR PROFIT 

4 All or part of rent of laundry, if table linen is laundered in the 

house 

5 Rent of rooms occupied byi cooks and kitchen help and all or 

part of rent of rooms of proprietor, waitresses, cashier, book- 
keeper, or such other help as live in the house and give all or 
part of their time to the food service 

6 Interest and depreciation, on value of furnishings and equip- 

ment in all the above rooms 

7 Renewal and replacement of equipment 

8 Cost of cleaning, painting, renovating, etc. 

9 Light used in lighting above rooms 

10 Fuel used in heating above rooms 

11 Fuel used in cooking 

12 Ice 

13 Soap and cleaiiing materials 

14 Proportionate part of telephone expense 

15 Wages of help 

16 Salary of at least $25.00 a week for proprietor 

17 Cost of laundering all linen used in dining room and kitchen 

18 Laundering maids' and cooks' uniforms, unless they pay for 

them themselves 

19 Water and other taxes, license fees,, insurance, garbage collec- 

tion, etc. 

20 Advertising and other expense peculiar to your situation 

21 Cost of food served to kitchen and dining room employees 

Cost of Meals per Day and per Week 

The cost of raw food stuffs, sufficient for one day for one 
person varies from fifty cents to two dollars or more. It is 
necessary to keep accurate account of all food purchased; 
it is worth while to make an inventory of supplies on hand 
at the beginning of, each month and their value. To cost 
of food purchased during the month, add the cost of sup- 
plies on hand the first day of the month and subtract value 
of supplies on hand the last day of the month. The result 
will show the cost of food for the month. You should 
charge up at its selling price food stuffs that you raise, 
can, etc. A record should be kept of the number of meals 
served each day to paying guests and to help and other non- 
paying people. Divide the total amount spent for food by 
the number of meals served to get the cost of food per 
meal per person. Multiply per capita cost of food by the 



GUEST HOUSE MANAGEMENT 199 

number of meals served to each guest each day or each week 
to learn the cost of raw food material per day or per week. 
Add to this the overhead cost of feeding guests per day or 
per week to learn the amount that must be taken in. 

Number. Necessary for Profit 

You should have enough paying guests to guarantee all 
the above expenses. To find the number necessary, divide 
the overhead and operating expense by the number of 
people that you serve or can easily accommodate. Add to 
this the cost of food material per person. This is what 
your guests m.ust pay for table board before there will be 
any profit for yourself more than the salary suggested 
above. People sometimes say "But no one will pay that 
much for board." If that is true you must reduce the cost 
of food or overhead expenses or both, or secure more pay- 
ing guests without increasing your overhead expenses, or 
consider that you are working hard for less money than 
you would get if you rented your furnished house and 
went to work for some one else. 

What It Costs to Run a Hotel 

The cost of raw food material will probably be more 
than fifty per cent of the total cost of doing business, al- 
though one hotel man writes: "There are few rules for 
pricing food, but you may divide the price paid by seventy- 
five guests into four parts allowing 

^4 for food cost 

% for overhead expense 

34 for service 
and the remaining fourth might be your profit."

per person or $25.05; all the salary of the manager. Learn to esti- 
mate every week or so just where you stand financially so that you 
will make a profit instead of losing money or just barely paying 
expenses. 

In a hotel the number of guests varies greatly. A sufficiently 
large staff must be kept to care for the average or the largest 
probable number of guests, therefore prices charged must be higher 
than in a guest house. 



GUEST HOUSE MANAGEMENT 201 

The average price paid for meals in eight hotels where tens of 
thousands of meals are served daily was figured as follows : 

Table d'Hote A la carte 

Breakfast $0.85 $1.42 

Lunch 1.38 1.80 

Dinner 2.08 379 

Renting Rooms 

The cost of the rooms that you rent should be figured as 
above and added to the cost of food service. When you 
know all these actual or probable costs you are in a position 
to make your price for ''meals and room by the day or 
week." This price must be based on the actual cost as 
figured above, plus enough more to give you a reasonable 
income proportionate to the size of your business and 
the amount invested in it. Prices charged by other people 
who give the same service in the same locality will help to 
determine the price that you will charge. 

Many people because they have linen, china, silver and 
a house, and are good cooks think they can make a profit 
from paying guests. They decide that they will charge for 
board what they think people will pay, and do not reckon 
at all what it is going to cost them. If you cannot charge 
the amount as estimated above and enough more to really 
pay you for being in business with its responsibility and 
its risks there is no sense in having boarders because you 
won't make anything on it. There may be some conditions 
under which it may be wise to work for just your bare 
living, but these are unusual. You must charge enough. 

Kitchen Help 

The number and duties of the employees where many 
people are fed depends on the number to be cooked tor, 
the character of the meals and the price paid. One meat 
cook, an assistant or vegetable cook and a pastry cook can 



202 COOKING FOR PROFIT 

prepare the food if it is not elaborate for from twenty to 
two hundred people or more. A kitchen man and a kitchen 
woman will be needed to prepare vegetables, freeze ice 
cream, wash pots, and keep the kitchen clean. One waitress 
can serve six to twelve people at a time. Waitresses may- 
wash all the china and silver used in the dining room and 
do all the cleaning of that room and of the serving room. 
Where much help is kept a separate dining room is reserved 
for them and special meals are prepared by a special cook. 
In many states women can not be employed for more than 
forty-eight hours a week. Hours of work therefore must 
be carefully planned with a half day off every week and 
part time on Sundays, and menus so planned that they can 
be carried out when the cook or her assistant are away. 

It is a great assistance in managing help to have the 
hours and duties of each person posted with regular time 
specified for each thing that has to be done daily and days 
for such things as are done less often. 

Saving Expense 

Where the price paid for board is not large every pos- 
sible means of reducing expense must be resorted to, except 
curtailing the food supply to the extent that people actually 
are undernourished. Qieap cuts of meat, the least expen- 
sive cereals, vegetables and fruits, are just as nutritious 
as the expensive and out of season foods. With care they 
can be made palatable and attractive. Dishes that are easily 
prepared lessen the number of cooks necessary. 

In many college boarding houses no tablecloths or doilies 
are used, save a centrepiece on each table. In a summer 
camp, paper napkins may be used and bare or oilcloth cov- 
ered tables. Meals may be given in payment for work done 
in the dining room. Many other suggestions and economies 
will occur to the woman of experience. The woman who 



GUEST HOUSE MANAGEMENT 203 

has had none should start in a small way or gain experience 
by working under a good manager before attempting a 
business of her own. 

Well-Paid Positions 

There are many excellent positions in institutions and 
hotels, open to women with training and ability. These pay 
good salaries and do not involve any money investment or 
as much care as when one is owner and proprietor of a 
business. Among these positions are those of 

Employment manager 

EHetitian 

Steward 

Cafeteria manager 

Manager of service in dining room 

Storeroom manager 

Storeroom assistants 

Cook 

Pastry cook 

Vegetable cook 

Salad maker 

Coffee woman 

Toast woman 

Cereal woman 
Many women as well as men find employment in the 
resort hotels, going south in the winter and to a summer 
hotel for the summer. 

There is much pleasure and satisfaction in so feeding 
people day after day that they enjoy their meals and remain 
in good health and spirits and stay or return to you year 
after year.

THERE are many opportunities open to the woman 
who wishes to Hve at home and have comparatively 
short hours of work elsewhere supervising or cook- 
ing one meal a day. Such a position may be found in 
schools, stores or factories. In such places a hot lunch 
at noon has proven its great superiority over the cold 
lunch carried from home. The lunch room may provide 
the entire lunch, or merely a soup, cocoa or other hot dish 
to be eaten with other things brought from home. 

In every such place the manager must be a woman 
(i) with a knoidedge of food values; (2) the foods best 
adapted to the needs of the people wha are to he served; 
(S) the foods that give the most nourishment for the least 
money; (4) how to prepare simple, inexpensive and nutri- 
tious foods so tJiut they zmll he attractive arid appetizing; 
(5) how to make comhinations tJmt will supply for little 
money a well balanced meal; (6) how to develop in the 
people fed, food habits that unll be valuable to them in their 
homes and all through their lives. 

205 



206 COOKING FOR PROFIT 

It is essential that the manager of such a business keep in 
close touch with what is in market and its cost, know what 
supplies are on hand in the storeroom and refrigerator 
every day, the dishes that are most popular with the people 
fed, the overhead costs, and the amount of money taken in 
daily, or the sum available for food each day. 

The thought of profit from cooking should not be con- 
sidered in a school, or factory lunch room, although many 
of them are self-sustaining and the manager should be 
able to keep them so. The employees are paid for their 
labor, except those who, because of their interest in the 
group that is being fed, are glad to give their services until 
such time as the project is well launched. 

School Lunches 

In the New York City schools, lunches costing only a few 
pennies furnish between 400 and 500 food units (calories). 
In Boston, lunches are provided in 18 high schools by the 
Women's Educational and Industrial Union in co-opera- 
tion with school authorities and health experts. All the 
food is prepared and cooked at the central kitchen, from 
which it is sent to the various schools. The food served 
in all the schools is the same in kind and quality. The head 
server, who is in charge at each school, makes a report of 
food sold and money received each day. The average cost 
of each student's lunch is from nine to eleven cents. Re- 
ceipts from lunch counters pay for — 

1 The charges for supervision, preparation and service of 

luncheons ; 

2 The expense for food; 

3 Rent, light, heat, and overhead expenses at the central 

kitchen ; 

4 All movable equipment in the schools. 



SCHOOL LUNCHES 207 

Each day the luncheon menu includes — 
I soup such as tomato, green pea, split pea, white or black bean 
which are nutritious and inexpensive. Four days out of the 
five it is a milk soup. 
I or 2 hot dishes, creamed or scalloped, such as spaghetti with 
tomato sauce, mashed potatoes with green peas, baked beans, 
corn pudding, a stew or hot roast beef sandwich. Meat is not 
served except in made up dishes where it flavors potato or rice 
or macaroni. Cheese and vegetables are much used. These 
dishes are baked in large round "milk" pans. 
I salad such as potato, egg, fruit or green vegetables. Most salads 
are made up at the schools, ingredients and dressing being 
sent out separately. 
5 sandwiches 

I meat sandwich, varied daily. 

I cheese sandwich, varied by using factory or cream cheese 

with olives, pimiento, catsup, etc. 
I jam sandwich. 
I peanut butter sandwich. 
I lettuce and mayonnaise sandwich. 

These are made at the central kitchen, but material for the 
three latter sandwiches is kept on hand at each school for 
use when more sandwiches are required than were sent. 
Boys like heavy meat sandwiches thickly cut. Girls prefer jam, 
lettuce, and cream cheese sandwiches thinly cut and daintily 
^ served. 
I pudding such as rice, bread, blancmange, or jellies. 
Every day there is served — 
baked custard 
ice cream 
plain cake or sweet wafers offered only in combination with 

milk or other plain food 
milk 
cocoa 

fruit such as apples, bananas, or stewed fruits of various kinds. 
Sweet chocolate and plain candies are often for sale. 

The dishes, except those specified, are not repeated oftener than 
once in ten days. 

Prices 

The price is usually put at 2 to 2^ times the cost of food 
material. It is well to figure the cost of the diflFerent soups 
that will probably be served and then make an average price 
so that soup, whatever its ingredients, will cost the same 
per cup throughout the year or, if a change must be made, 
that such a change does not occur more than twice a year. 



208 COOKING FOR PROFIT 

The same thing should be done for scalloped dishes, pud- 
dings, etc., in order that children may always know how 
much money they will need for certain types of dishes. 
Boys and girls may serve at the lunch counter and for their 
services be allowed 20 cents' worth of lunch. 

In many schools the food prepared in the cooking class 
as the regular lesson is sold in the lunch room. This elimi- 
nates the cost of food material for the class, trains the 
pupils in buying and preparing good substantial every-day 
food, in family quantities, and gives all the children an 
opportunity to purchase at cost a nourishing and satisfying 
luncheon. 

Employees who prepare and serve food in a school lunch 
room work usually from nine to^ four and are paid about 
30 cents an hour. The manager, who may do a part of the 
cooking, should receive from $20.00 a week up. 

Store and Factory Lunch Rooms 

There are many opportunities in stores and factories for 
women who can serve efficiently as managers of lunch 
rooms where one meal a day is served to employees. The 
cafeteria plan is usually followed as in schools. This 
method will be discussed in Lesson XIL The hours are 
not very long and the pay is commensurate with the work 
done. The menus may be longer than those for the school 
lunch room and generally include a well planned meal of 
meat, potato, vegetable, bread and butter, dessert and coffee, 
as well as separately priced dishes like those suggested above. 
The manager plans the menus, does the buying, engages 
and supervises cooks and waitresses and keeps the books, 
so that she knows just how she stands financially every day. 

Menus and Prices 

One large corporation, with branches in many places, has 
75 standard menus, 40 for winter, 35 for summer, which 



INDUSTRIAL LUNCHES 209 

are served in rotation. In this way employees may secure 
for the price usually charged for meat alone, meat or meat 
substitute, potato and bread and butter, which keeps them 
in better health than the lunches they might select for the 
same price if no combinations were offered. 

In addition to the combination menu, a soup, salad, sev- 
eral desserts and beverages are also provided. 

Specific cooking instructions accompany each menu, for 
the use of the cook, and a chart of food values showing the 
calories contained in each article, to help the patron order 
an adequate ration. Each branch has the same menu at the 
same time. All the buying is done from the central plant 
and supplies are sent daily to each lunch room in such 
amounts as are ordered by the matron in charge. 

The Matron's Duties 

In addition to sending in this daily requisition the 
matron's duties include the cooking of the food, selling it 
over the lunch counter, keeping track of income by means 
of a cash register and taking an inventory once a month ; 
in fact, she is responsible for the entire management of 
that particular lunch room, including supervision of the 
woman who washes the dishes and a woman to assist in 
serving if more than 200 people are served there. 

Equipment 

Oftentimes the lunch room equipment is very simple, 
scarcely more than a stove, a work table and a counter with 
shelves underneath; when the enterprise has proven its 
value more elaborate equipment may be provided costing 
up to $io,cxx). Steam kettles, a steam table, a dish wash- 
ing machine, dish warmer, coffee urns, a bake oven, bread 
and meat slicer, power mixer, ice cream freezer, vegetable 
]:)aring machine, and vegetable masher are among the larger 



210 COOKING FOR PROFIT 

things that will be needed where many people are fed daily. 
Many breads, desserts, cakes, etc., are purchased from 
concerns which specialize in making such things on a large 
scale, others go to the serving counter in the pans in which 
they are baked. There should be a large supply of these 
pans, either round or of a size about ii by 19 inches, that 
fit into the steam table and keep food hot until the last por- 
tion is served. 

Luncheonettes in Stores 

In many stores that are equipped with soda fountains 
light lunches are being served to increasing numbers of 
patrons. Hot beverages, as chocolate, bouillon, coffee, etc., 
with sandwiches and cakes, cookies, doughnuts and pies, 
are first added to the list of fountain drinks and ices. The 
cakes and sandwiches may be prepared in one's home and 
delivered daily to the store or cooking equipment may be 
installed near the store and more dishes added to the menu 
as the demand increases. 

All food served should be above the average in appear- 
ance and taste and no dishes should be listed unless there 
is a good demand for them, as the success of such a depart- 
ment depends on the call for larg^ quantities of a limited 
number of articles. There may be a hot "special" each day, 
as Chicken Pie, Hot Roast Beef Sandwich, Baked Beans 
in individual pots. Scalloped Oysters, etc. 

Community Kitchens 

Community Kitchens have been opened in many places. 
Food is prepared in a central kitchen and delivered in spe- 
cial containers^ to the homes of families that subscribe for 
the service. The original investment may be very small or 
as much as $20,000. In order to make it self-sustaining it 



COMMUNITY FOOD SERVICE 211 

should feed 250 persons daily. It pays better if 500 per- 
sons can be daily supplied. In addition to the dinners that 
are furnished regularly a general catering business or food 
shop or both should be carried on. Such a station should 
be located on a popular street, with considerable traffic, in 
order to display to advantage in an attractive window its 
catering specialties. The location should also be central 
with a desirable class of homes radiating from it. There 
must be ample room in the building or house for cold- 
storage, kitchens with ranges, dish-washing machines and 
sterilizer for containers ; pantries, and rooms for office staff. 
A garage is an important item as it saves rent outside. For 
delivering food for 250 persons four motor cars are re- 
quired. 

A station requires the following help: 

Office Staff 

Manager who makes out menus 

Purchasing agent, who reports to manager on market 
conditions so that menus shall include seasonable 
food stuffs only and omit those which are scarce 
and high priced (the manager and purchasing 
agent may be combined in one person) 

Kitchen director, chef, or cook 

Pastry cook 

2 packers in hot food department 

I packer of cold food 

Dish, pan and container washers 

4 delivery hands 

Delivering Food at a Distance 

A most important item for a community kitchen is the 
type of food container selected for transporting meals from 
the central kitchen to individual homes. One container on 
the market is composed of five parts; the base, the outer 
insulating sleeve or jacket, four insulated glass lined metal 
inserts and covers. In this container food can be kept hot 



212 COOKING FOR PROFIT 

for hours and the separate inserts may be used on the table 
in place of other platters and serving dishes. Another style 
has a high container insulated like a fireless cooker. It is 
heated with hot stones for an hour or two before being 
packed, then the stones are removed and aluminum pans 
holding hot soup, meat and two vegetables are packed in 
one upon another. Other containers hold the cold dessert 
and the salad in individual paper cups. Salad dressing, cus- 
tard sauce, etc., are sent in small glass jars. Ice cream is 
packed in molds holding the required number of orders and 
sent out in buckets of ice and salt. 

Menus may be sent out in the container one day. The 
number of portions required must be ordered before a cer- 
tain hour the next day. The entire meal is delivered piping 
hot to be opened and served when the family has assembled. 
The following is a copy of a menu used in one well-to-do 
community : 

Dinner 
tomato bouillon or consomme 

roast sirloin of beef or 

roast leg of lamb, mint sauce 

scalloped potato or rice croquettes 

lima beans or harvard beets 

pear salad 

apple pie or tapioca cream 

Supper 

lamb chop or halibut timbales 

potatoes salad dessert 

(as GIVEN ON DINNER MENU) 

To regular customers (those who subscribe to a dinner or 
supper book of twelve tickets) the price of the dinner is 
$i.oo a plate; supper 85 cents a plate; Sunday dinner $1.25 
a plate. 

In one city a kitchen has been established in the poorest 
section. Women who go out to work can send over for hot 
cooked cereal and rolls for their breakfasts, the children can 
go there from school for a nourishing ten cent luncheon and 
anybody may purchase a hot dish and dessert for supper. 



COMMUNITY FOOD SERVICE 213 

Community Centers 

In a country town, each housekeeper may contribute to 
a community center any kind of cooked or canned food or 
fresh fruit or vegetables that she does not need for her own 
family. Different townswomen may take turns in tending 
the shop and there is therefore little overhead expense to 
be deducted from the profits from sales. Automobile tour- 
ists as well as townspeople and farmers' wives patronize 
such a shop. Accurate record should be kept of each article 
received and of every sale every day and settlement made 
weekly.

214 COOKING FOR PROFIT 

A paid manager and assistants may be necessary for such 
a community kitchen. The foregoing figures are those of a 
community shop and tea room for a period of fourteen 
months as reported by the manager. 

Traveling Kjtchen 

A travehng restaurant or kitchen has been successful in 
some places. A large automobile, fitted up with steam table 
for keeping food and dishes warm, a range for cooking 
"short orders" (steaks, chops, etc.), a refrigerator to keep 
meat, milk and fruits in prime condition, storage space for 
other foods, a cook and a driver complete the outfit which 
covers a regular route at a regular time every day. 

How Much to Serve 

The proprietor of a lunch room or community kitchen 
with a number of things on her menu but'witfiout definite 
knowledge of how many people are coming in to eat, or 
what these people are going to order, must depend on statis- 
tics in order to always have enough on hand to feed every- 
one. She should keep a daily record of the number of 
people who come in and the number of orders served of 
the dishes which are provided on different days. These 
records should be so compiled that after a little experience 
she will be able to tell approximately how many orders will 
be given for sandwiches or salads, how many patrons are 
going to order meat, and how many may prefer fish, what 
desserts will be most popular, and how many whole meals 
will be served. 

You can multiply the number of chairs by the length of 
time for serving, allowing time for the quickest possible 
service, and this will give the maximum number which could 
be served. It is not likely that a new lunch room, unknown 
and unestablished, would serve to more than one-half its 



COMMUNITY FOOD SERVICE 215 

capacity the first few days. If the time of serving is ii to 3, 
the number of chairs, 50, and the minimum time for service,. 
20 minutes, the capacity of the lunch room would be ap- 
proximately 150 an hour or 600 people in the four hours. 

Of course, not all of the 600 are going to select all the 
ready-to-serve items on the menu, so that considerable 
judgment has to be shown in providing larger quantities of 
some of the hot dishes, because of their general popularity, 
and their selling price. The public will more often select a 
dish with which they are familiar, particularly in a new 
establishment, and when the price is moderate, than one 
which is unknown to them. The location and class of patrons 
must also be considered in estimating the possible number 
to be served. If the lunch room caters largely to business 
people whose lunch hours are practically the same, the rush 
of trade will be greater during those hours, and the first and 
last hour will not be likely to even approach a maximum 
number of customers. This should be considered when 
estimating the number to be served, as the figures used, 600 
for four hours, is the maximum number for the entire time. 
Where quick service is essential, a sufficient quantity of food 
should be prepared before the bulk of the trade is expected, 
but where it is possible, materials should be partially pre- 
pared, but not combined until ordered. This avoids waste 
and also makes it easier to use the left-overs, as the materials 
may be combined in different ways on successive days. 

Disposal of Left-Over Food 

In schools where a simple lunch is served to the pupils 
at noon, it is possible to make a fairly accurate estimate of 
how much food to provide. Any left-over sandwiches, etc., 
may be sold at a very small cost to the poorer children, or 
given to the very needy or used the next day for toasted 
sandwiches. 



216 COOKING FOR PROFIT 

Left-over cake may be made into cakes, cookies, and 
desserts. Melted ice cream can be utilized in bread puddings. 

In estimating the first amounts that you may have to serve 
it is better to make your estimate too low than to plan too 
much and so have a lot of food wasted. 

The portions served should be standardized as suggested 
in previous lessons. You must know how many portions 
can be served from one recipe and always secure that 
number. If one recipe fills fifteen pans and each pan con- 
tains forty portions, then 200 portions should be served 
from that recipe. 

A well-known writer talked one day with the manager 
of a restaurant where the employees of a great factory are 
fed. "The place was losing money when I took it," the 
manager said. "Now we just break even, which is all we 
want to do. And there is the machine that made the differ- 
ence." He pointed to a machine that cuts the portions of 
butter for each butter plate. "The difference between just 
enough butter and just a little too much was the difference 
between making expenses and making a loss." 

In one kitchen where six legs of lamb had been required, 
careful carving by another person made five legs serve the 
same number of people equally well. 

Prices of Food and Profit 

Lunch rooms, community kitchens, etc., are usually op- 
erated on a very small margin. The following figures were 
recently published in the Hotel Monthly. 

"The business was a lunch room system — several places 
operated in different parts of a large city and supplied from 
a central commissary with the bulk of the foods. The gross 
receipts aggregated $2,000,000 a year. The distribution of 
these receipts in the operation was, approximately: Food, 
55 cents; labor, 16 cents; rent and taxes, 5 cents; expenses 
and supplies, 4 cents; light, heat, power, fuel, ice, 4 cents; 



FOOD SERVICE 217 

laundry, 2 cents; furniture, i^^ cents; general overhead, in- 
cluding repairs, 4^ cents; depjreciation, 2 cents. These 
items figure up 94 cents, leaving 6 cents on the dollar of 
receipts for profit. 

"A business of this kind, where 'service' is a prime factor 
in its success, so that patrons will be encouraged to come 
to these places regularly, must be operated scientifically, and 
every point of expenditure watched closely; for the margin 
of the business is so small, and the gamble of the business 
is so great, that most careful and exacting management is 
demanded. When the average patron sees a busy lunch 
room, he is apt to think it a very profitable business. He 
does not see the expenses over and above the costs of food, 
which, in the above showing, are small as compared with 
the average lunch room in which the receipts are not so 
great. 

"It is volume of business that enables the average lunch 
room and restaurant to give so much as it does for the 
money." 

Summer Camp 

The cooking for a summer camp is much the same as for 
a guest house. As most camps are for boys or girls a knowl- 
edge of the best foods for children is essential. Plenty of 
milk to drink and in soups, creamed dishes and puddings, 
an abundance of fruits and vegetables, small amounts of 
meat, good bread and butter, simple desserts, but each one 
different are most important. Have an abundance of cereal 
cooked in fireless cookers over night, varying these with the 
ready-to-eat cereals. They may be served for both break- 
fast and supper. If you have your own cows be sure that 
the cream comes to the table instead of being kept in the 
kitchen. More cereal is eaten if cream is supplied, even if 
it be thin cream, and an abundance of milk should also be 
available. 



218 , COOKING FOR PROFIT 

It is well to be careful in the use of onion for flavoring. 
It is distasteful to many people and should be used sparingly 
if at all. Casserole dishes will help make left-over dishes 
so popular that many will want the recipe to send home to 
mother. 

Something for lunches should always be available. Simple 
cookies or crackers and milk to drink is sufficient. The 
younger children need it at ten o'clock in the morning and 
in the middle of the afternoon. The others all want some- 
thing when they come in from bathing. The lunch should 
be sufficiently attractive so the children will not buy and 
eat too much candy. 

Make up your menus with a few dishes only at each meal 
and enough of them, but different dishes every day. 

Sometimes an extra helper in the kitchen need not be 
hired if the girls are allowed so much an hour to prepare 
the vegetables. This money can be turned into a fund for 
the needy at home or abroad. Four or more girls may be 
allowed part payment of their camp expenses to set the 
tables, wait on table, keep the main hall tidy and wash 
glass and silver. Remember that cleanliness in the kitchen 
and dining room and speedy service of meals are essential 
to success in catering for young people. 

The housekeeper will be popular with the boys and girls 
and their counsellors if she shows a willingness to make 
special arrangements for birthdays, to plan Sunday night 
suppers so the young people can get them ready, and relieve 
the cook, ingenuity in serving fish so that it will be enjoyed 
and in using the berries that the children like to pick. 

Packing Box Lunches 

It is essential that she also know how to pack lunches for 
all day and over-night trips so that food will be appetizing 



FOOD SERVICE 219 

and satisfying. Wrap every sandwich separately in wax 
paper. Do not use messy fillings in sandwiches. A meat 
sandwich, a peanut butter sandwich and a sweet sandwich 
make a good combination. Hard boiled eggs with salt and 
pepper or devilled eggs wrapped in wax paper and packed 
in an tgg box are always popular. Turnovers instead of 
pies, cookies instead of soft cakes and firm fruit like 
oranges, apples, bananas and pears are good. A thin un- 
peeled slice of pineapple cut in quarters, wrapped in wax 
paper and accompanied by an envelope of sugar is very re- 
freshing. A small cucumber pickle and olive should be 
added to each lunch. 

Boxes of plain crackers, a jar of jam or marmalade, sar- 
dines and a package of cheese may be provided for an 
emergency, that is in case more people come than were pro- 
vided for or in case the party is delayed by accident or 
weather in their return home. Cofifee in a cheese cloth bag 
and a large kettle or boiler that can be used over an open 
fire may be sent out with the party. 

Lunches are most easily served if packed in boxes holding 
lunch for not more than four people. A discarded quart 
berry box may be used for each person in the party and 
packed in a berry crate. For breakfast after an over-night 
trip bacon to be cooked over the coals may be provided. 
Corn meal seasoned with salt and pepper, a piece of salt 
pork and a frying pan should be taken if there is a pos- 
sibility of there being fresh fish to fry. Potatoes and sweet 
corn to be cooked in the ashes and marshmallows to toast 
over the fire will make any meal interesting. 

Where conveyances are going to the camping place a hot 
dish usually of stew may be sent in one compartment of a 
fireless cooker and a frozen dessert packed in ice and salt 
in the other compartment so that the campers will have a 
real meal on their arrival. It is sometimes convenient to 



220 COOKING FOR PROFIT 

send a salad nicely packed in glass jars or wooden con- 
tainers. In such cases as these forks, spoons and paper 
plates should also be provided. Tin cups to hold coffee or 
other beverage may be strung on a rope or packed in a 
berry crate unless each camper has her own plate, cup and 
cutlery. 

For real "Camping Out" a knowledge of how to build a 
fire in the open and the best kinds of food to cook thereon, 
is essential. An open oven and few utensils mean a different 
type of cooking than is usually done in the home. Practice 
in this branch of cookery will soon make one an expert. 

A pleasant summer in an attractive location with almost 
no expense and adequate salary make catering for a summer 
camp a worth while job. 

Planning Menus 

In all these types of catering the lists of dishes from 
which to build menus, arranged as suggested in Lesson IX 
will be of great assistance in securing variety. Surprises 
appeal to young people in school or camp or factory and 
make community and lunch room meals more interesting 
than when the same things are served over and over. 

Lists of dishes to be made from left-overs are as useful 
as in a boarding house. 

The following list of desserts shows how easy it may 
be to provide a different inexpensive dessert every day for 
several months especially if a frozen dessert is served in- 
stead of pudding once or twice a week, and pies are allowed 
in the dietary.

TEA ROOM MANAGEMENT 

SELECTING THE LOCATION AND NAME; DECORATIONS, FUR- 
NISHINGS, EQUIPMENT AND PLANS; SOME THINGS TO AVOID; 
TYPICAL MENUS FOR TOWN AND COUNTRY TEA ROOMS; TEA 
ROOM SPECIALTIES ; SUGGESTIONS AND RECIPES FOR BEVERAGES, 
SANDWICHES, SALADS, HOT DISHES AND DESSERTS ; COSTS, PRIC- 
ING AND PROFITS. 

INTEREST in opening tea rooms is v^ide spread, from 
the Atlantic to the Pacific. Some people apparently 
think that little is required save an attractively furnished 
robm and a teapot or two, but we advise anybody to con- 
sider carefully, before investing the amount of money that 
must be spent, if even the simplest tea room is to be opened. 

When you have started such a business, in order to be 
profitable, it may need to be developed along any of the 
avenues suggested in previous lessons and every bit of knowl- 
edge, information and experience that you have gathered 
will be no more than you can use, no matter how simply you 
begin. 

The serving of afternoon tea, only, does not often prove 
a profitable undertaking. In connection with a tea room it 
is wise to conduct a gift shop or a cake shop, to sell home- 
made candy or preserves, operate a soda fountain, put up 
box lunches for motorists, to serve lunches and suppers or 
cater for dinner parties. 

Many a tea house has become a little motor inn, serving 

225 



226 COOKING FOR PROFIT 

dainty yet satisfying meals, and with cool attractive bed- 
rooms, and immaculate bathrooms for guests who spend the 
night, and dressing-rooms for others. 

From replies to many questionnaires sent out to the man- 
agers of successful tea rooms we list the following: 

Requisites for a Successful Tea Room 

Good location 

Unusual or expressive name 

Distinctive decorations and furnishings 

Absolute cleanliness 

Competent hostess or manager 

Wisely chosen waitresses 

Effective advertising 

Food beyond criticism and correctly priced 

Care in business management 

Location 

A tea room must have a good location, usually on or near 
a much traveled road and preferably on the first floor. In 
the city, when selecting the location for a tea room, you might 
do as the representatives of some chain stores do, stand on 
the various corners of the busy streets and count the number 
of people passing and note where the greatest number pass, 
of the type of people who might patronize a tea room. 

In the country you should note the number of machines 
passing on the various roads, and whether there are good 
tea rooms in the vicinity. It is of no use to have a beautiful 
place if your tea room is on a road where few or no autos 
travel. You should also note whether there are attractive 
surroundings about the place you decide upon, whether it 
has a pretty view at the back or at the front or in both 
places, shade trees, and a house that can be made especially 
attractive. A summer tea room may have an out-of-door 
dining porch or lawn umbrellas over painted tables. 



TEA ROOM MANAGEMENT 227 

Choosing a Name 

A tea room should have an unusual or expressive name, 
one that fits the location or the house or can be illustrated 
on the sign board or carried out in the decorations and fur- 
nishings. For example: 

The Red Squirrel Tea Room may have a painted squirrel on the 

sign and should be located where at least an occasional squirrel 

is to be seen. 
The Maple Tea Room may be under a grove of Maple Trees and 

specialize in maple sugar products. 
The Ragged Robin, 
The Sunflower, 
Ye Hollyhock Tea Room should each be surrounded by flowers 

of that name in the summer and show them in chintz, china or 

wall coverings in the winter. 
Canary Cottage Tea Room should be a yellow cottage with canaries 

in tall bird cages. 
The Green Arbor Tea Room shows tables under rose arbors, that 

invite you to tarry. 
Peggy's Tea Room, where Peggy in a crisp muslin gown is seen in 

the garden by passing motorists, is irresistible. 
The Rowley-Powley Tea Room is in the town of Rowley. 
The Bi-a-Cake Tea Room and The Gingerbread Tea Room 

specialize in delicious and unusual cakes. 
The Crooked Stairs Tea Room suggests a quaint old house. 
Polly's Place serves old time country dishes, sausages, doughnuts 

and English crumpets. 
The Sweetheart has maple sugar or praline hearts as the specialty. 
NoBSCOT Mountain Orchards specializes in jams, jellies and other 

preserves. 
The name of The Maramor, a most attractive tea room, is made 

from the proprietor's name, and has a charming cake, candy and 

favor shop in connection with it. 

It may be well to avoid the name "tea room" as done by 

Ye Bradford Arms 

The Lightship 

The Seagull 

Vanity Fair 

Sign of the Apple Tree 

Tea and Crumpet Room 

Sign of the Cross Roads 

The Five Sisters 

The White Turkey 

The Tea Shed 

Janet's Tea Garden 

These are all suggestive of location or decoration. Indian 

decorations are used in some Western tea rooms and articles 



228 COOKING FOR PROFIT 

made by the Indians are for sale in the gift shop at "The 
Sign of the Totem Pole." 

Decorations and Furnishings 

The decorations and furnishings should be distinctive and 
dainty and such as appeal to women of taste. In many 
instances the name is shown in the decorations as parrots 
of different colors painted on the walls and furniture and 
shown in the cretonne and china for a Pretty Pol Tea Room. 
The Sunbeam is an old house with several rooms in which 
meals are served. Each room is different, has beautifully 
decorated walls and painted tables and chairs, with window 
draperies and china in colors that match or harmonize with 
the walls. Painted furniture seems just now more popular 
than any other kind. One hostess purchased painted mahog- 
any so she would still have good furniture when the painted 
craze had died down. 

Quaint holders for flowers, unusual prints on the walls, 
hand-made draperies and doilies, antique treasures of dif- 
ferent kinds, local color in the shape of ocean or mountain 
or Indian curios all add interest and pleasure, distinction 
and charm, as do brightly colored quaint china, polished Rus- 
sian samovars, Sheffield silver muffin dishes, burnished cop- 
per utensils, century old pewter, trays that are different. 

Even though the furnishings are of the simplest, if every- 
thing is in good taste and immaculate, fresh flowers daily on 
each table will give the touch that is far more appealing 
than an expensive, inartistic or untidy room that does not 
show the daily presence and care of a "real lady." 

Absolute Cleanliness 

Absolute cleanliness should prevail in every part of the 
establishment. There should be no hesitancy in allowing 
guests to inspect the kitchen, refrigerator, or back yard if 
they wish. Waitresses may do the daily cleaning of the 



TEA ROOM MANAGEMENT 229 

dining room but a strong person should clean the walls and 
scrub the floor every week or oftener. The table linen 
must be immaculate whether table cloths, runners, or doilies 
are used. Glass topped or polished tables may be adopted if 
desired. Linen or crepe or paper napkins may be provided 
as suits the fancy of the hostess and the desires of patrons. 

Competent Hostess or Manager 

The hostess should have a pleasing personality, be fond 
of people, have executive ability and a knowledge of cook- 
ing. She should endeavor to create a home-like atmosphere 
in a tea room, that makes it seem different from the ordinary 
restaurant but, if it is to be a profitable undertaking, it must 
be run according to business principles. Among the many 
duties of the hostess or manager will be to 

Know, not merely guess, the financial standing of the 

tea room every day. 
See that the dining room is well aired and kept at the 

proper temperature. 
Arrange the flowers. 
Be accessible to patrons at all times. 
Look over supplies in ice box each morning and see 

that everything is on hand that may be required. 
Plan menus for the next day and place orders. 
Check up supplies as they come in. 
Know that every dish that is served is properly pre- 
pared, correctly seasoned and daintily served. 
Audit accounts daily and be sure that all food served 

has been paid for. 
Supervise the cleanliness, duties and general deportment 
of all employees. 

Wisely Chosen Waitresses 

The waitresses should be quiet, refined, well groomed, 
and with good dispositions. Their costumes should be neat 



230 COOKING FOR PROFIT 

and, if feasible, in keeping with the color scheme and name. 
Places with old fashioned names and old fashioned furnish- 
ings should have waitresses in old fashioned costumes. 
Waitresses should learn to take orders accurately, fill them 
as quickly as possible, with care to avoid accidents of any 
kind. Waitresses must be trained to remember that the 
customer is always right. This principle must be followed. 
They should have no arguments with patrons about any- 
thing. Each one should have a definite number of tables and 
definite duties in regard to the cleaning and care of the room. 
All other employees should also be selected carefully. 
They should be trained in your methods. Adjust yourself 
to them and their dispositions. Give them the work for 
which they are best fitted. Secure their cooperation. 
Make them feel that their work, no matter what it is, is an 
important contribution to the success of the tea room. 
Raise wages when business warrants it or have some profit- 
sharing plan. 

Effective Advertising 

Some advertising must be done. You may — 

Send out notices of your opening. 

Take small space in the Automobile Blue Book. 

Take small space in newspapers or magazines. 

Have cards and photographs in nearby hotels. 

Have attractive signs, at intervals, for several miles, on the 
roads leading to your tea room. 

Have post cards of your tea room for guests to send to their 
friends. 

Have a special room or porch where chauffeurs may rest, wash, 
read, smoke or be served with luncheon. (They will adver- 
tise such a place to other chauffeurs.) 

Pay special attention to the children's needs. Sometimes you 
may give them cookies or fruit to take with them for a lunch. 

Above all have everything so satisfactory that your guests will 
advertise you far and wide. 

Food Beyond Criticism and Correctly Priced 

As has been suggested in previous lessons perfection of 
cooking and a knowledge of right purchasing, apportioning, 



TEA ROOM MANAGEMENT 



231 



and pricing food is the foundation of success in all forms of 
Cooking for Profit, and tea room management is no ex- 
ception. 

Care in Business Management 

Carelessness in collecting pay for every order served 
may easily spell failure. It is a pretty custom to have bon- 
bons or mints in paper cases served for each person, on the 
tray with the check or the change. A tea room, effectively 
advertised, should very soon after being opened pay its 
running expenses. 

If a tea room is not extravagantly fitted up, the profits 
should pay off the cost of equipment in one season. 



Main Requisite 

The main requisite is good food well and quickly served, 
and in portions not too small. Tea room prices should be 
high enough to warrant the use of the best and freshest 
materials and the choicest recipes. The best for the purpose 
is the most economical in the end. Do not skimp on butter 
or eggs or cream. Get the home flavor into your dishes. 
They need not be too rich but they cannot be too good. 
The above characteristics in a tea room will cause guests to 
return again and again. 

Some Things to Avoid in Your Tea Room 



Poor entrance 

Obscure hall 

Narrow stairs 

No advertising 

Cheap pictures on wall 

Noise in kitchen 

Poor music 

Untidiness and dirt 

Unmatched or nicked china 

Unclean dishes 

Slow service 

Too small orders 



Too high prices 
Wrong temperature 



for the 



Mussy, unattractive dishes 
Poorly seasoned sandwiches and 

salad dressing 
Salads and foods that should be 

cold, served warm 
Soft butter balls or cubes 
Stale cake 
Carelessness in collecting money 

for food sold 



232

Equipment 

The cost of equipping a tea room varies from $1,500 
to many thousands of dollars. Unless it is possible to start 
in a small way under very favorable conditions, the wise 
person will seek experience in a successful tea room before 
investing her own or other people's money in a venture that 
is by no means simple. In any case, tea rooms should be 
visited, prices of furnishings and equipment should be 
studied, carpenters, plumbers and decorators should be con- 
sulted and lists and prices should be made out over and over 
until you are satisfied that they are correct. Give space 
only to efficient equipment and use that to its maximum ca- 
pacity. A tea room seating forty-eight people will require

TEA ROOM MANAGEMENT 233 

Overhead Expenses 

Before investing a cent of money you should figure what 
your overhead expenses are probably going to be and what 
your income is likely to be. 

Decide tentatively on your specialties and, if you do not 
already know from your experience, learn how to apportion 
the foods you plan to serve before you open your tea room, 
know the cost and selling price of a definite amount of each 
thing, and the number of portions you must sell in a day 
in order to pay for the food material and the overhead 
expenses as estimated. A common method of determining 
the selling price of cooked food is to double the cost 
of the raw material. Can you get this price? At this 
rate can you probably sell enough to pay expenses? You 
may need to serve smaller portions of some dishes. On 
some dishes you should charge more than double the cost 
because of the time necessary for their preparation. Some 
may have to be sold at cost or less than cost. If you feel 
confident of a reasonable profit on your investment of money 
and time, then go ahead. 

Make Plans of Kitchen and Dining Room 

Before you equip your establishment make a kitchen 
plan and a dining room plan on paper and locate the places 
for mixing cake, making frostings, salads and dressings, 
slicing and spreading bread for sandwiches, making waffles, 
and whatever else you plan to serve. Locate drain boards 
for receiving, sorting and draining dishes. Locate shelves 
near the sink for clean dishes, near the work tables for sup- 
plies and equipment. Locate coffee and hot water urns, 
a steam table for hot dishes and a chipped ice tray for salads. 

Draw in the lines of travel from refrigerator to work 
table, to range, to dicing room, to sink, etc., etc. Shorten 
these lines in every possible way, on paper, before building 



234 COOKING FOR PROFIT 

your shelves or setting up refrigerator, sink, and stove, 
that all the work of your tea room may be accomplished 
in the most efficient manner with a place for everything that 
will be needed and room for all the help you propose to have. 
Plan where the tea tables and service tables shall be 
placed; as well as shelves and drawers, window boxes, 
cashier's desk, etc. These should all be on your list of neces- 
sary equipment suggested above and should now be located 
on your paper plan. In the dining room you may care to plan 
for electric wall outlets so you can plug in table lamps, 
waffle irons, toasters, chafing dishes or percolators at each 
table. These add distinction to your service and are greatly 
appreciated as patrons are assured of having their food hot. 
If you had not thought before of the cost of this or that, 
add it to your list, learn the price of it and add to the 
probable cost of equipment. 

What to Serve 

In a small tea room it is desirable to specialize in a very 
few things and have them so attractive and distinctive and 
delicious that there will be a constantly increasing demand 
for them. The dishes most frequently ordered in tea rooms 
are tea or other beverages, sandwiches, salads, cakes and ice 
creams. 

There is danger of losing money when very many dishes 
are attempted at one time, because of wasted food or poor 
service, unless you have a great deal of help and a very 
large patronage, which you can hardly expect at first. 

Learn how many sandwiches you should get from a 
loaf of bread and from a definite amount of butter and of 
different fillings, file the data and strive to maintain this 
standard. Know how many servings you should get from 
one quart of ice cream and ice cream sauces, and one pound 
nut meats and use the same measures every day. Serve 
a definite number of salads from one fowl, one can of pine- 



TEA ROOM MANAGEMENT 235 

apple, one quart mayonnaise dressing, etc., etc. (See pages 
99, lOO.) From a standard cake mixture cut always the 
same number of pieces and make a definite number of little 
cakes or cookies. Servings may be larger for men than for 
women. 

As soon as possible after you are started learn approxi- 
mately how much food will be used in a day that there may 
be no waste of perishable material. Keep a sufficient sup- 
ply of non-perishable supplies on hand in a locked store 
room of which you hold the key, so that you may not lose 
time sending out unnecessarily and may know when things 
are getting low. Be careful not to have in the refrigerator 
too much and yet have sufficient of perishable things such 
as lettuce, lemons, chicken and cream. Accurate record 
should be kept of the number of orders served each day, 
of the different dishes listed on the menu, so that you will 
learn as soon as possible the probable number to provide 

for.

THE FOODS YOU SERVE 
Beverages 

Tea should be made as ordered in individual earthen pots. 
Tiny muslin bags holding just enough tea for one pot may 
be purchased by the thousand in six different varieties, 
orange pekoe being the favorite. Use freshly boiling water 
for each pot of tea. Many suggestions for accompaniments 
are given on page 103. Cups, saucers, tea spoons, sugar 
bowl, pitcher of cream and any desired garnish should 
accompany the tea. Make a point of never forgetting 
anything in serving an order. With each order for tea 
with toast or sandwiches a piece of candied grapefruit or 
orange peel or ginger may be served. 

Coffee must be freshly made as often as necessary. 
Electric percolators may be used and taken to the table. 
Guests may then have their coffee of the strength most 
pleasing to them. Serve real cream and enough of it, and 
loaf sugar. In Lesson VI are suggestions for making and 
serving coffee. 

Chocolate syrup for hot or iced chocolate may be kept 
on hand. 

Chocolate Syrup 

Melt 
5^ lb. unsweetened chocolate over boiling water, add 

2% cups sugar and ' 

54 teaspoon salt and stir until well mixed ; then pour on gradually 
3 cups boiling water, stir until smooth and boil five minutes. 

Cool, turn into a jar and keep in ice box or cold place. 

Hot Chocolate 

Add 2 to 3 tablespoons chocolate syrup to one cup scalded milk. 
Serve with whipped cream. • 

Chocolate Milk Shake 

Put two tablespoons chocolate syrup in tall glass and fill glass with 
ice cold milk. Shake thoroughly and serve very cold with 
whipped cream or ice cream. 



TEA ROOM MANAGEMENT 237 

A quickly prepared iced fruit drink is popular, for instance: 
Mint Cup 

Reserve tips and remove leaves from 
4 bunches of mint and bruise with the fingers. Cook 
2 cups sugar and 

2 cups water five minutes, add mint leaves, 
Juice 12 lemons, and 
Green color paste to make a delicate shade, and let stand over 

night. When ready to serve strain, fill glass of cracked ice 

half full of syrup, and add 
Gingerale to fill the glass. Garnish with reserved tips from sprigs 

of mint. Other fruit juices may be used in place of some 

of the lemon juice. * 

TOAST AND SANDWICHES 

Bread is used in tea rooms for toast of different kinds, 
sandwiches with a great variety of fillings and in several 
shapes; for ribbon sandwiches, toasted sandwiches, club 
sandwiches, hot meat sandwiches and French toast sand- 
wiches. 

White bread may be purchased in long loaves that will 
cut into fifty-six slices. These are more practical than the 
homemade loaf. Graham bread, nut bread, Boston brown 
bread, and other fancy breads suggested in Lesson II may 
be used. A bread cutting machine will insure uniformity, 
and may be regulated so that bread may be cut thin enough 
for sandwiches or thick enough for toast. 

Toast 

Toast must be fresh and hot to be popular. It may be 
made in the kitchen or on an electric toaster, on a side 
table in the dining room, where guests may watch the process 
and know that they get it as soon as it is ready. Toast may 
be served plain with butter ball, or be buttered before it is 
served. Some fancy breads are delicious toasted. Individ- 



238 COOKING FOR PROFIT 

ual jars of marmalade or jam, or small portions served on 
small dishes or butter plates, usually accompany plain toast. 

Cinnamon Toast 

Work until creamy 

3 cups butter, add slowly 

2 cups light brown sugar and 

Yi cup ground cinnamon. Keep in a cool place. Cut 

Stale bread in one-fourth inch slices, remove crusts and toast on 
one side. Spread untoasted side generously with a portion of 
the cinnamon mixture, and place under gas flame until mix- 
ture is melted. 

Making Sandwiches 

Butter for sandwiches should always be creamed, that 
it may be quickly and easily spread. A small palette knife 
or spatula is desirable for spreading the filling. It is ad- 
visable to butter both slices of bread, regardless of what 
filling is used. Fillings should be prepared before the hours 
at which the tea room is open, or the ingredients for fillings 
may be made ready and kept in separate dishes ready to be 
put together at a moment's notice. 

Crusts may or may not be removed. Sandwiches may be 
cut in squares, strips, oblongs, or triangles. Round or fancy 
cutters may be used but with considerable loss of material. 
Before the hour for opening the tea room, the sliced bread 
may be spread with butter, piled up and covered with a dry 
towel or cheesecloth and with a wet towel. Sandwich fillings 
can be put between the slices as orders are received. 

Garnishes for a Plate of Sandwiches 

Many sandwiches are more attractive if served with a gar- 
nish such as 

Lettuce leaf holding manyonnaise dressing 
Spray of cress 
Fresh flower ^ 
Cube of firm jelly 
Ball of cream cheese 



TEA ROOM MANAGEMENT 239 

Tiny cucumber pickle with croquette stab in one end 

Ring of sweet pickled cucumber 

Radish rose 

Stalk of celery curled on one end. 

Bread buttered for sandwiches and not used may be 
utilized next day for toasted sandwiches. In addition to the 
sandwich filling suggestions on page 107 we list the follow- 
ing combinations. They should be seasoned as needed with 
salt and cayenne and paprika, materials may be chopped or 
cut in pieces, and whatever will secure the best results should 
be done. You may make up your own names for these sand- 
wiches.

Rolled Sandwiches 

Use very fresh bread. Cut in very thin slices, remove crusts, 
spread with filling, roll up and serve two or three on a let- 
tuce leaf. These are very dainty and not commonly served. 
Many of the fillings suggested above, especially those with 
cream cheese, may be used for rolled sandwiches. They 
may be toasted. Chopped hard cooked egg or walnuts, 
mayonnaise dressing and watercress leaves projecting from 
each end are attractive or celery, nuts and mayonnaise and 
a celery leaf in each end.

The English Muffins that are purchased from a concern that 
makes a specialty of their manufacture are more satisfactory than 
any that can be made in a small tea room because of the type of 
oven used. However the following recipe may be satisfactory.

minutes. After twenty-four hours remove crusts, cut in 
thin slices and in finger shaped pieces. Brush with melted 
butter and toast in the oven until crisp and delicately 
brown. 

Toasted Sandwiches 

Hot sandwiches are popular in most tea rooms. Many of 
the sandwiches listed above may be made and toasted first 
on one side and then on the other, cut in two or three 
diagonally and served immediately. The best method of 
toasting is under the gas flame or on a flat electric toaster. 
Baking in a hot oven or sauteing in the frying pan may be 
substituted for toasting. The bread may be toasted on one 
side and the filling then be put between untoasted sides. 

Hot Cheese Sandwich 

Cut 
Stale bread in J4 inch slices, remove crusts; cut 
Mild cheese in slices same size as slices of bread, and sprinkle

Salt and cayenne. Put a slice of cheese, between each two 
slices of bread and toast until cheese melts or bake in a hot 
oven until cheese melts and the bread is browned; or saute 
in butter first on one side and then on the other until deli- 
cately browned.

SALADS 

Tea rooms usually feature one or more salads on their 
menus. A tea room may specialize in a few particularly 
delicious salads or if the menu is changed daily a great num- 
ber of salad combinations may be necessary. With after- 
noon tea, fruit salads are most popular. For luncheon or 
supper salads, chicken, lobster, Q.gg and potato may be 
served. 

Keep salad plates or bowls near the ice. Do not serve 
salads on plates hot from the dish pan ! Have enough 
china so such a thing will never be necessary. 

Enough lettuce should be washed before your tea room 
opens to supply the number of patrons you expect to serve. 
Put it in a large collander, over it lay pieces of ice wrapped 
in cheesecloth and keep in refrigerator or salad pan. Have 
your dressings made and kept very cold. Prepare and cut 
up the fruit, nuts, celery, chicken and all the other ingre- 
dients you may need and put in a cool place. Make up each 
salad as it is ordered. 

Many times it is well to line a shallow bowl with lettuce 
and arrange the ingredients of the salad in individual piles, 
then cover with mayonnaise or with any other prepared 
dressing. 



TEA ROOM MANAGEMENT 249 

Small amounts of salad ingredients that are left over one 
day may be used for salad sandwiches the next day. Make 
every salad a picture so that it will appeal to the eye as well 
as the palate. 

Lobster Salad 

In a bowl lined with 
Lettuce leaves make a pile each of pieces of 
Lobster meat, 

Tomato peeled and cut in eighths, 
Celery cut in one inch strips, 
Shredded lettuce leaves. Make a mound of 
Mayonnaise dressing in the center. 

Chicken Salad 

In a bowl lined with 
Lettuce leaves make one pile each of 
Chicken cut in dice, 
Celery or cucumber cut in dice and 
Hard cooked egg chopped. Serve with 
Mayonnaise dressing. 

Fruit Salad 

On a bed of 
Lettuce leaves make one pile each 
Grapefruit sections cut in pieces. 
Orange sections cut in pieces. 
Pineapple cut in dice 
Celery cut in small pieces, 
Nut meats cut in pieces or 
Cheese balls rolled in chopped nuts. Place 
Mayonnaise dressing in a lettuce cup in the center. 

Other fruits that are in season may be used instead of 
those specified. Cooked meat, fish, eggs, vegetables, rice or 
macaroni, celery, cucumbers, fresh or canned fruit, nuts and 
cheese, alone or in combination can all be used for salads. 
Use 3^our own ingenuity and you may secure some new and 
attractive salads. Maraschino cherries on fruit salads are 
popular, chopped pistachio nuts add character to many 
simple salads. The combinations suggested on page 115 may 
be used. A few more suggestions are given here:

English monkey 

Cheese toasf 

Cheese and tomato rarebit 

Cheese and scrambled eggs 

Cheese dreams 

Cheese sandwiches 

CAKES 

The most popular cakes in most tea rooms are those with 
soft flufTy frostings, such as 

Dark chocolate cake with marshmallow filling and white 

frosting with bitter chocolate on top 
White cake with chocolate frosting 

Yellow cake with chocolate frosting, and filling contain- 
ing nuts and candied fruit 
Very thin cookies, macaroons, sponge cake and angel food 

cake also have their appeal. 
Any of the cakes and frostings noted in lesson IV may be 
used. Select your specialties perhaps from pages 66 to y^ 
and maintain your standard without fail. Never serve cake 
that is more than two days old. 

Use for Stale Cakes 

Cakes may be sold at cost at the end of the second day, 

or stale cake, crumbs and ends of cake that result from 

cutting cake in fancy shapes, may be used for pudding; or, 

rubbed through a coarse sieve or when dry, forced through 



254 COOKING FOR PROFIT 

the food chopper, the crumbs may be substituted for half the 
flour in hermits, spice cakes and Boston brown bread. 

PASTRY 

French pastries on pages 46 and 47 are very popular in 
some tea rooms. Summer tea rooms had better not attempt 
to make puff paste as it is difficult to handle in hot weather. 

ICE CREAM DISHES 

Ice cream, served in different ways and with different 
sauces, may be made or purchased. Buy it, the best quality 
you can secure, if your facilities for making it are not first 
class. Sherbets and water ices are more popular than poor 
ice cream. Most people like sauces of some kind with ice 
cream. A Thermos bottle may be used to keep chocolate, 
butterscotch, and similar sauces, hot. Ice cream sandwiches 
or shortcakes are popular. 

Ice Cream Shortcake with 
Butterscotch Sauce 

Place a slice of white cake on the serving dish, cover with 
a slice of ice cream, with another slice of cake, pour butter- 
scotch sauce (page 122) over all and sprinkle with chopped 
nuts. 

Ice Cream Shortcake with 
Fresh Strawberries 

Use strawberry ice cream between two slices of white or 
angel cake and cover with fresh strawberries crushed and 
sweetened. 

Ice Cream Shortcake 
With Fudge Sauce 

Use chocolate ice cream between two slices cake and cover 
with fudge sauce. 



TEA ROOM MANAGEMENT 255 

Other popular ices are : 

Chocolate Peppermint Sundae 

Chocolate ice cream served with marshmallow sauce, fla- 
vored with oil of peppermint. 

Fudge Marshmallow Sundae 

Ice cream covered with marshmallow sauce and then with 
fudge sauce. 

Luxury Eclairs 

Eclairs filled with ice cream and with hot fudge sauce or 
fresh strawberry sauce poured over. 

Meringue Glace 

Two meringues with center removed, ice cream between 
and a few crushed strawberries, or maraschino cherries, 
over the ice cream. 

MENUS 

For luncheon, dinner, and party menus for a tea room 
many suggestions will be found in preceding lessons and it 
does not seem necessary to discuss them here. Prices must 
be carefully made and the dishes selected as specialties 
must be so standardized that they will .always taste the same 
whether the patrons come in every week or do not return 
for several months. 

Before and after opening your own place, or acting as 
manager for some one else, visit as many successful tea 
rooms as you can. Notice the dishes that are most fre- 
quently called for. Note the points that could be improved 
and then work hard in your own place and success should 
attend you.

CAFETERIA AND 
LUNCH ROOM MANAGEMENT

EQUIPMENT, ARRANGEMENT AND COST; HOW TO USE AND CARE FOR 
STEAM TABLE AND COFFEE URNS ; HELP REQUIRED ; DUTIES OF HELP ;

MENUS. 

THE small cafeteria is beginning to vie with the tea 
room in popularity as a channel through which a clever 
woman may turn her culinary ability into profit. Such 
cafeterias may be found in many small cities where the aver- 
age restaurant manager has not learned the art of supplying 
"home-cooked" food ; they also exist in tucked away corners 
of large cities where the "something different" which they 
supply brings them their necessary quota of patronage. The 
reasons which have been given for the popularity of cafe- 
teria service are: 

The saving of money to the customer since the reduced 
cost of operating expenses makes possible the charg- 
ing of moderate prices and also an absence of tips. 
The saving of time to the customer. 
The stimulation of the appetite by the tempting display 

of dishes. 
Larger profits are possible to the cafeteria owner than to 
the tea room owner as a larger volume of business can be 
taken care of for the same overhead expense. 

257 



258 COOKING FOR PROFIT 

Counter service is a more specialized task than waitress 
service, therefore the training and oversight of employees is 
simpler in the cafeteria than in the tea room or lunch room. 
Waitresses usually must price the customer's check in lunch 
rooms, a responsibility which never falls to the counter 
server. 

The careful selection of attractive furnishings and color 
schemes in the most modern cafeterias, adds to these points 
of advantage, a "tea-room atmosphere" which is an improve- 
ment over the bare and unattractive room which is usually 
associated with the name. 

Considerable noise is frequently eliminated and the rather 
unsightly view of the passing "line" by erecting, a few feet 
in front of the counter, a well designed screen. In some 
few cafeterias the counter occupies a distinct room from the 
dining room but this is not often possible. 

Arrangement and Equipment 

Equipment firms will make, without charge, blue prints 
of recommended floor plans showing the location of all fix- 
tures, but the cafeteria manager should, however, know the 
principles of operation which govern their location and have 
a sufficient knowledge of equipment to select that best suited 
to her purpose. 

Except in large cafeterias where expensive subveyor serv- 
ice is possible it is best to have dining room and kitchen on 
the same floor. The counter should be at the rear of the 
dining room to provide for the formation of a "line" dur- 
ing busy hours. There should be two points of access from 
kitchen to dining room, one for the supply of food to the 
counter, one for the removal of soiled dishes from dining 
room. Care should be taken that the latter is at the oppo- 
site side of the room from that on which the customers 
approach the counter so that there is no possibility of the 



CAFETERIA AND LUNCH ROOM MANAGEMENT 

line of customers coming in contact with employees re 
ing soiled dishes. 

The Serving Counter 

The counter is usually placed four feet in front of the 
partition wall between kitchen and dining room. A twelve 
or fifteen inch service shelf, counter height, is usually built 
on this wall, frequently with cupboards under. This leaves 
three feet of working space for employees between shelf and 
counter. When space is limited this may be shortened to 
thirty inches. An inset should be made in the service shelf 
directly behind the dessert and coffee counter for the placing 
of a small refrigerator to hold milk, cream, butter and other 
counter supplies which should be kept cold. 

Standard counters are now built by all equipment firms. 
They are thirty inches wide, thirty-six inches high and are 
made with a sanitary base. They are built of wood, galva- 
nized metal painted to match woodwork, vitrolite glass with 
nickel trimming, and enamel baked on metal. Tops may be 
of wood (heat and waterproof finish), monel metal or vitro- 
lite glass. With a wood or glass top, metal protection under 
the coffee urn must be supplied. 

Locally Built Counters 

It is possible to have a local carpenter build a counter, if 
measurements are carefully made for the insets of salad 
pan, steam table, coffee urn stand, ice cream cabinet. Wood 
panelling should be used in preference to sheathing as the 
many joints of the latter offer a harbor for vermin. Because 
of the frequent warping of a wood facing in front of a 
steam table this section of facing is frequently omitted and 
the steam table front is set flush with the counter front. 
The steam table front may then be finished in Russia iron 
with nickel trimmings or, if of galvanized iron, may be 
painted to match woodwork. 



260 COOKING FOR PROFIT 

A double or triple bar nickel tray rail supported on nickel 
brackets should extend the length of the counter. This is 
one of the expensive fittings which is well worth its cost. 
One shelf for dish storage should extend under the counter. 
Twenty feet may be considered a minimum length for the 
counter. A division which may increase proportionately 
with the length of the counter is 

Three feet for salad pan 

Two feet for bread and butter counter 

Six feet for steam table 

Three feet for dessert counter 

Two feet for coffee urn space 

Two feet for ice cream cabinet 

Two feet for checker's desk 
Usually a tray and silver stand is provided before the 
customer reaches the counter. If it is necessary to use coun- 
ter space for this purpose an additional three feet must be 
allowed and an allowance of two feet extra must be made 
if the checker is to serve also as cashier. 

A glass display shelf twelve inches wide and set twelve 
inches above the counter usually extends over salad and 
bread counter and also over dessert counter. 

The Salad Pan 

An insulated salad pan is considered today as essential in 
a cafeteria as a steam table if cold foods are to be served 
cold as well as hot foods hot. The steam table follows the 
salad pan in the counter for several reasons. 

1. By placing as late as possible in the counter there is the 

assurance that the hot foods will reach the table in 
as palatable a condition as possible. 

2. Congestion in the line is avoided, for when the steam 

table conies first in order all customers stop at that 
point; with the salad counter first many stop at that 
point but others go on at once to the steam table. 



CAFETERIA AND LUNCH ROOM MANAGEMENT 261 

3. The average customer selects the first attractive dish to 
meet his eye, therefore an early display encourages 
the purchase of healthful foods and at the same time 
brings a maximum profit to the cafeteria owner. 

(I stress the first reason as strongly as the second.) 
Usually bowls of lettuce and salad mixtures are placed in 

the salad pan and individual portions, served almost to order, 

are placed on the glass display shelf. 

The Steam Table 

The steam table should be built with a dish warmer and is 
in most cases fitted with gas connections. In large cafeterias 
and in those placed in institutional buildings or factories,

steam is frequently used for heating. The tops are made 
of monel metal, German silver, white enamel on iron, 
(named in the order of their preference). Copper is seldom 
used for this purpose today because of the difficulty of 
cleansing. Monel metal is strong, cleans easily and gives 
many years of wear. Nickel-plated copper is undesirable 
because with constant polishing the nickel wears off. White 
enamel meat pans and Hall china vegetable and gravy in- 
sets prove satisfactory. Retinned "copper pans" are in con- 
stant need of retinning and do not clean well. Aluminum 
discolors. Monel metal pans are sometimes used but are 



262 COOKING FOR PROFIT 

difficult to secure. The following plan is suggested for a 
small steam table 

2 large vegetable insets (one for soup) 

2 half size meat pans 

3 round gravy insets 

2 large vegetable insets 
2 half size meat pans 

A six inch carving board is on one side only. Entree pans 
may replace the second set of vegetable pans as they dis- 
play vegetables equally as well as meats. Macaroni and 
cheese and similar dishes are cooked in the pan in which 
they are displayed. For this reason it is well to order with 
the steam table twelve or more extra meat pans. For small 
cafeterias, it is well to order also several extra vegetable in- 
sets. The small pan assures a constant fresh display of 
foods and is also economical of space. Larger cafeterias 
use a majority of small pans but also, for popular dishes, 
some of the full sized ones. 

The Coffee Urn 

A six gallon combination coffee urn with large water 
jacket is recommended for this size counter. If this cannot 
be secured, an eight gallon hot water urn and a six gallon 
coffee urn should be provided. These may be set directly 
behind the counter or at right angles to it rather than upon 
it. 

The ice cream cabinet is sometimes provided without 
charge by the firm supplying the ice cream. When this is 
the case it should be well fitted into the counter. 

The health laws of some cities and states require glass 
protection of all foods displayed for sale. Special construc- 
tion can be recommended by local glass dealers when this 
is true. 



CAFETERIA AND LUNCH ROOM MANAGEMENT 263 
The Traffic Rail 

A traffic rail to guide customers to checker is placed about 
three feet from the counter. This may be of pipe iron 
painted or of the more expensive cord and pedestal variety. 

The Water Cooler 

A water cooler with trays of glasses on shelves adjoining 
should be centrally located in the dining room. The type is 
best in which city water passes through coils in an ice cham- 
ber and does not come in contact with the ice. 

Plumbing 

In addition to kitchen plumbing water should be piped to 
water cooler, steam table and coffee urn, gas piped to steam 
table and coffee urn, drainage provided for water cooler, salad 
pan, steam table, coffee urn and ice cream cabinet. 

Care of Steam Table and Coffee Urn 

It is surprising how frequently the proper care is not 
taken of these two expensive pieces of equipment. The 
water pan of the steam table should be drained and thor- 
oughly cleaned each day after the evening meal and left 
dry until time for its next use. A failure to do this causes 
the accumulation of rust in the bottom of the pan which in 
time causes holes in the metal. The smell of combined 
grease and rust in an uncleaned steam table water pan is un- 
mistakable. It speaks of slovenly habits which mean poor 
business management. Coffee should never be left standing 
in an urn after a meal. It leaves a sediment in the jar which 
spoils the flavor of future coffee. The coffee should be drawn 
off and the jar washed after each use, with warm water with 
an occasional addition of soda. Poor coffee is more frequent- 



2^4 COOKING FOR PROFIT 

ly caused by unclean jars than any other one thing. A fresh 
coffee bag should be used each week. It should be washed 
after use in cold water and hung to dry. 

Kitchen, dish washing space, store rooms, employees' 
dressing rooms, and manager's office do not differ from those 
of tea rooms or small restaurants of similar size. 

Kitchen Equipment 

A two section gas range with large ovens is sufficient for 
baking as well as other cooking for an attendance of less 
than two hundred and fifty. For more than this a pastry 
oven should be added. There should be a cook's table with 
a pot rack over it, bakers' table with metal bins, bread cut- 
ting table accessible to bread supply, salad preparation table 
accessible to sink and refrigerator. A standard large refriger- 
ator should be provided as well as a small one behind the 
counter. 

Three sinks are a minimum for dishwashing, pot washing, 
salad and vegetable preparation ; the latter should be used for 
tray and glass washing during meal hours. They should be 
made of galvanized iron with metal drain boards. The one 
for dishes should be double with long galvanized tables ad- 
joining for soiled and clean dishes. 

Labor Saving Machinery 

A Sterling Bread Slicer No. 50 and an Adjustable Butter 
Cutter are necessary items. A dishwashing machine, vege- 
table peeler, electric mixer may all be wisely added for 
numbers over 250. 

Store Room 

A first shelf, barrel height, and others fifteen inches wide 
and fifteen inches apart have been found to hold two rows 
of No. ID cans or three rows of No. 2 cans without waste 



CAFETERIA AND LUNCH ROOM MANAGEMENT 265 

of space. A small "day storage'^ space for the cook should 
be provided in the kitchen. 

Trays, Silver, Glass 

The following figures are based on a seating capacity of 
sixty. 

90 Wearever Aluminum trays No. 348 (i7^"xii%") 

8 doz. dessert spoons (soup) 

ID doz. medium knives 

10 doz. medium forks 

15 doz. teaspoons 

8 doz. soup bowls 

10 doz. 7 inch plates 

20 doz. 4 inch plates 

10 doz. teacups 

8 doz. saucers 

20 doz. sauce dishes (vegetables, desserts) 

8 doz. butter chips 

20 doz. water tumblers 

15 only salts, peppers, vinegar cruets 

3 doz. individual teapots 

A good grade of restaurant silver and hotel china with a 
rolled edge is recommended. Other glassware may be pur- 
chased for variety in counter display. 

Kitchen Utensils 

This can best be selected by the manager. It is wise to 
leave a portion of this appropriation to be spent as needs 
arise. Aluminum ware proves economical in usage. 

Furniture 

Oblong tables are most economical of space, those thirty 
inches wide and forty-eight inches long prove most popular. 
Bentwood or rush bottom chairs are light and durable. Cos- 
turners are considered essential. 



266 COOKING FOR PROFIT 

Menu 

A menu board having white gummed letters on black 
cards is very satisfactory. It is well to have two of these 
boards, one placed where customers may study it before 
reaching the counter, and one back of the counter. 

The small cafeteria need not offer a large variety of dishes 
daily but a variety from day to day. A cafeteria specializing 
on hot breads, fresh vegetables, moderately priced salads, and 
homemade desserts furnishes keen competition to the 
average "Meat and Potato Restaurant." One roast meat 
or fish, one made dish, as baked hash, stew, beef pie, one 
entree, as baked beans, macaroni and cheese, Italian spa- 
ghetti, one starchy vegetable, and two green vegetables should 
suffice for the steam table. Salads will vary with the sea- 
son; egg and fish salads as well as vegetable salads are pop- 
ular sellers. Two kinds of pie, one cake, baked apple 
or fruit sauce and ice cream are sufficient desserts. Prices 
vary with localities. One hundred per cent over the cost of 
raw food is usually charged to provide for overhead ex- 
pense and profit. 

Employees 

Employees are needed for several distinct types of service 

Cooking — Food production 
Counter Service — Salesmanship 
Checking, Cashiering, Bookkeeping — Clerical 
Dining room work, dishwashing — Cleaning 

A minimum number would be 

I cook 

1 helper 

2 dishwashers and cleaners 
I salad maker and server 

I steam table server 

I dessert and coffee server 

1 checker, cashier and bookkeeper 

2 dining room employees 



CAFETERIA AND LUNCH ROOM MANAGEMENT 267 

A pastry cook would be the first addition. Some of these 
workers may be part time and the duties of some may over- 
lap. Each community will determine the amount of wages 
to be paid. Fair w^ages, fair hours, and good working con- 
ditions are requisite for efficient loyal service. 

Cost of Operating a Cafeteria 

The first business problem is the amount of rent which 
can be afforded, a question dependent on possible average 
food checks and anticipated volume of business. Three to 
five per cent of gross receipts may be allowed for this item. 
A conservative estimate of receipts should be made to de- 
termine this. The second problem is the purchase of equip- 
ment. In consultation with equipment firms, lists should be 
made and estimates of cost secured and compared, before 
placing orders. 

Business Equipment 

Equipment for the transaction of business is as follows : 

Standard duplicate order book 

Bill and invoice file 

Stock and issue cards 

Requisition slips 

Columnar record book, for attendance, receipts, expenses 

Employees' record book, $2.50 

Clarenback's Inventory Book and Stock Record, $2.50 

A number of these supplies can be obtained from John 
Willy, Hotel Monthly, Chicago. 

Checks should be issued from a check register (National 
Cash Register) tjie newest variety of which issues an 
itemized check with added total amount. The record of 
checks issued and their value in money should be compared 
with number of checks received and cash received by cashier 
after each meal. 



268 



COOKING FOR PROFIT 



Store Room Management 

The store room should be in charge of one person only. 
The buyer should give the store-room keeper, who also 
receives goods, a daily list of all purchases that they may 
be checked up accurately as they come in. Every purchase 
with Date, Rec'd from, Quantity, Unit of Cost, and Total 
Cost, should be entered on cards or in a record book, having 
a separate card or page for every kind of food stuffs. 

Requisitions giving a list of materials which will be 
required the following day should be made out daily and 
signed by the head of each department, as the head cook, 
salad maker, coffee woman, pastry cook, head waitress, 
head cleaner, etc. These should be given to the person in 
charge of the store room each evening. Goods from the 
store room should be issued each morning, from these 
written requisitions. These requisitions should later be 
totalled and entered each on its individual card. Cards may 
be made out as follows. Note that twice as much space 
is allowed for foods delivered as foods received.

The Perpetual Inventory 

Balance in the last column is a record of stock on hand 
daily. This is obtained by deducting food issued from 
previous balance (on hand). This is called keeping a Per- 
petual Inventory. The perpetual inventory makes it un- 
necessary to take a monthly inventory, although it may be 
wise to check up the supplies, actually on hand at the end 
of each month, with the supplies as recorded on the cards, 
if there seems to be any question about their agreeing. 
An inventory is necessary for taking off the monthly trial 
balance and determining profit and loss. 

The cards are also of great assistance in making out daily, 
weekly, or monthly orders for food stuffs. They are used 
for making the daily comparison of food stuffs issued, with 
dishes sold as indicated on the checks. This comparison will 
show whether the foods are being sold to good advantage 
or not. Waste or theft in the kitchen or dining room can 
be quickly detected. For example ; i lb. of coffee makes 50 
cups. If 4 lbs. of coffee were issued, more than 150 cups 
should appear on the sales checks. Canned goods, fresh 
and dried fruits, sugar used in desserts and on the tables, 
can be easily checked up from these Perpetual Inventory 
cards. 

The Par Stock System 

Sometimes a ''par stock" is maintained in the kitchen of 
large establishments, i. e., so many pounds of flour, meal, 
sugar, potatoes, butter, etc. ; so many cans of fruit, packages 
of cereal, etc.; sufficient for a little more than one day. 
At the end of the day requisitions are made out on the stock 
room to bring the kitchen stock "up to par." This order 
shows exactly what materials have been used during the 
day, which with overhead, gives cost and compared to re- 
ceipts, the daily profit. 



270 COOKING FOR PROFIT 

The Record Book 

The columnar record book should have headings of at- 
tendance, noon, night, etc., with similar headings for re- 
ceipts and expenditures. Food, wages and salaries, rent, 
repairs, replacement and other expenses should all be listed. 
More expense headings may be used if desirable. 

A daily overhead expense estimate may be determined 
by dividing monthly overhead expense of a past month by the 
number of operating days in a given month. The addition 
of this daily overhead estimate to actual expense for fresh 
supplies used and for store-room requisitions will give the 
total expense of operation for one day. This amount sub- 
tracted from receipts for the day will give daily profit or 
daily loss. 

A good business manager ascertains and records this 
financial standing each day. 

A fair percentage of monthly expenditure for commer- 
cial cafeterias has been found to be 

Food ^ 55% or 50% 

Salaries and Wages 25% 25% 

Rent 3% or 5% 

Repairs and replacement 2% 2% 

Other Expense 5% 5% 

Profit 10% or 13% 

Total 100% 100% 

Ten per cent of gross receipts seems to be universally 
considered a good profit. Other percentages will vary with 
localities. A good business will repay the original invest- 
ment the first year. 

Usually an attendance of two hundred and fifty daily with 
an average check of forty cents is considered necessary for 
a profitable business but some successes have been made 
with smaller numbers. 



CAFETERIA AND LUNCH ROOM MANAGEMENT 271 
Lunch Rooms 

A lunch room or restaurant differs from a cafeteria in 
that the patron orders from a menu card or displayed 
menu, and food is brought from steam table, coffee urns, 
salad and dessert counters by waiters or waitresses. Prices 
are usually a little higher than in a cafeteria, to pay for this 
service, which will average about lo cents a person served. 
Some lunch rooms are open 24 hours a day — never closed. 

The preparation of foods, and number of employees in 
the kitchen differs but slightly, if at all, from that of cafe- 
terias. The arrangement of steam-table, salad tray, coffee 
urn and ice cream containers is similar except that they 
are all placed on the kitchen side of the partition which 
separates the kitchen from the dining room, with a shelf 
in front of them and an opening over them where the 
waitresses can give and receive their orders. All the cold 
dishes as salads and desserts may be grouped together. Tray 
and traffic rails, of course, are not necessary. It is a con- 
venient and attractive arrangement to have built-in screens 
in front of the kitchen partition and about three feet from 
it. On the kitchen side of this screen may be kept bread 
boxes on shelves at a convenient height filled with sliced 
bread in vertical piles, pans of iced butter cut for serving, and 
bread and butter plates. In this way one of the most fre- 
quently served foods is entirely eliminated from the kitchen 
service. The front of these screens may be fitted with large 
mirrors which give the impression of a larger dining room 
and more space. It is essential to have the window where 
the used dishes are left, at the extreme end of the room oppo- 
site from the serving tables. An electric dish washer is 
desirable where more than 150 people are fed daily. 

Requisites for a successful lunch room are: 

Location — ^Where there is much passing — from 3% to 15% of 
passersby should come in. 



272 COOKING FOR PROFIT 

Appearance — White tiling, and nickel finish have a strong appeal. 

Cleanliness — Apparent and genuine. In high-class restaurants, 
every part of the kitchen and dining room, walls, floors, shelves, 
and equipment are cleaned and polished daily. 

Fresh Air — Electric fans or other means of ventilation to keep 
the air fresh and free from odors. 

Equipment and Furnishings — Arranged to give efficient and rapid 
service. Chairs may be filled four times an hour during the 
noon rush. The kitchen need not be large, but should have 
room for and a special place for everything needed. There 
should be sufficient help to keep it always in perfect order. 

Management — Aiming to please and with constant oversight to 
detect leaks and improve conditions; familiarity with every 
smallest detail of the business ; knowledge of markets and knowl- 
edge of human nature are desirable. 

Courtesy — Necessary on the part of every employee toward patrons 
and toward one another. 

Good Food — Of high quality with home-cooked flavor; carefully- 
tested recipes, followed accurately; dishes giving maximum 
food value and satisfaction for smallest expense. 

Rules — For portioning all food — by weight (for meat) measure or 
thickness, according to the dish served. 

Menus — For plate dinners, vegetarian lunches and inexpensive 
meals, arranged with a knowledge of food values and dietetics 
and costs, so that patrons may be able to get what they should 
have at a reasonable price. 

Vegetables — Properly cooked and well-seasoned; served with a 
poached egg they make a meal that is inexpensive and attractive 
to many people and oftentimes difficult to find. 

Ready-To-Eat-Dishes— Essential in a lunch room that caters 
to business people who want to be served at about the same 
hour — from 12 to 2 or 5 to 7 o'clock. 
For example: 
Soups 
Stews 

Scalloped dishes

Vegetables 
Sandwich fillings— which can be mixed beforehand to be made 

up to order 
Salad materials— which can be prepared for serving and will

Coffee — This must be beyond criticism. 



CAFETERIA AND LUNCH ROOM MANAGEMENT 273 

The manager of a chain of restaurants states that 20% 
of their receipts come from coffee. For each one hundred 
dollars taken in is served :

Cost of Recipes and Portions 

The cost of every recipe used should be accurately worked 
out, and the cost of individual portions of each dish that 
is listed on your bill of fare should be known, in order that 
prices may be intelligently made. If lunches at 30c, 35c, 
40c, 60c, etc., are served, the per capita overhead cost and 
the expected profit per person should first be subtracted from 
the proposed special lunch price. The cost of bread and 
butter and coffee may be taken out; the remainder may be 
used for the special dishes. For regular customers the cost 
may vary slightly from day to day. 

Recipes for serving a large number of people are written 
by accurately increasing the amounts of each ingredient in a 
family recipe, as explained on pages 50 and 51. 

The checks received for food each day should be analyzed 
in order that the manager may know what kinds of foods 
are most popular, which pay the best, and which are losing 
money. 

Dishes that must be sold at a loss should not often be put 
on a bill of fare. Those that are not profitable should be 



274 



COOKING FOR PROFIT 



taken off. Low-priced nutritious attractive dishes should be 
featured. A daily comparison of food issued, and food sold 
should be made, to show you each day just where you 
stand — whether you are making or losing money. This can 
be known only by the most careful attention to details, the 
most accurate knowledge of costs and income. 

The following menus have been used in a lunch room 
managed by a woman, where 1,500 people are fed daily :

Preparation for Management 

Training in a home economics is the best fundamental 
preparation for cafeteria or lunch room management. This 
should if possible be followed by one year's experience as 
an employee in some well run cafeteria. 

The woman without complete technical training, but with 
a good knowledge of food and cookery and some experi- 
ence in catering to the public taste should spend at least 
three months as a worker in a well-run establishment and 
become familiar with equipment and methods of operation 
before opening a place of her own. To one who understands 
the business, the machinery of operation is simple. The 
cafeteria is a democratic method of public feeding. Excel- 
lent food, courteous service, absolute cleanliness of sur- 
roundings together with attractiveness are sign posts of suc- 
cess. Above all the home-cooked "come again" flavor of 
the food served must be maintained. 

In Conclusion 

Food service outside the home is one of our country's 
largest and most essential industries. It is estimated that 
over nine million people eat daily in lunch rooms, cafeterias 
and restaurants. Many millions of dollars are invested in 
these enterprises and the business has been highly developed. 
Apparently the demand is well supplied, but there are hun- 
dreds and thousands of eating places where the food service 
is bad, very bad. There is a wide field for expert cooking 



276 COOKING FOR PROFIT 

and service — food with the home flavor will find demand 
and, with good management, the business will give handsome 
profits. 

Beginning with the sale of home-cooked food, specialties 
and home-made candy, through catering in all its many- 
branches, to guest house, tea room, cafeteria and lunch room 
management, there is a splendid opportunity for professional 
food service — Cooking for Profit. 

It is the hope of the author that these lessons may serve 
as a guide, point the way, give courage and inspiration to 
many women to push ahead into creative work which will 
increase their value to the world and to themselves.
