MY MOTHEE AND OTHER PIONEER FARM WOMEN 
WHOSE CULINARY SKILL AND PRACTICE OF 
THRIFT KEPT THE ART OF HOMEMAKING ALIVE 
WHEN AMERICAN FRONTIERS WERE BEING WON 



PREFACE 

Practically all the recipe and homemaking books on the market 
during the last decade have been written for city women. "The 
Farm Cook and Rule Book" has been prepared especially for 
rural homemakers, to help them use intelligently the foods avail- 
able in their kitchens and to m^et with prudence the problems 
confronted in their business of housekeeping. 

When America was younger, a large proportion of the popu- 
lation lived on farms. Then every mother taught her daughters 
how to cure the meat butchered, to manufacture soaps from 
left-over fats and cracklings, to utilize surplus fruits in making 
vinegar, to tan hides, to make hominy and to put away foods 
during the harvest for use in the winter. 

City growth has been rapid. With it changes have come. 
Commercial bakeries and laundries, restaurants, cafeterias, cor- 
ner grocery stores and delicatessens have taken duties from city 
homes that remain in rural communities. The proximity of 
hospitals has even made the home nurse's role less important; 
small apartments require different methods of housekeeping than 
country houses; the nearness of beauty shops has taken the re- 
sponsibility of caring for the hair and skin from many urban 
women. 

In rural districts, even in this day and age, homemakers need 
to know how to prepare foods to cater to the appetite of the 
sick. A knowledge of old-fashioned beauty secrets, those rules 
which made pink-and-white complexions long ago, is sought by 
farm girls. Baking day is not a tradition. Saturday's work does 
not end until the cupboards are supplied with delectable pies, 
crisply browned loaves of bread, jars of sugary cookies and 
prettily iced cakes — all of the homemade variet}^ More than 
once a week the fragrance of spices and browning batters is in 
the air. 

Many of the older cooks and housekeepers do not follow

definite rules in working. Years of experience have trained 
their eyes to judge accurately the amounts of ingredients being 
used in making a cake, cookies, bread or other food combina- 
tions. These women speak of handfuls of sugar, a dash of 
spice and pinches of soda, not realizing that the young home- 
maker may add too much sugar because her hand is large or use 
too little soda and an overdose of spice. Learning to cook and 
to keep house by experience may end happily, but it brings many 
disappointments. In addition to this, there is a tremendous 
waste of fuelj food, energy and ambition which must be reckoned 
with in these days of high living costs. 

In an effort to preserve the old-time recipes and to present 
them with the newer discoveries which make cooking and home- 
making easier and more satisfactory, this book has been written. 
The old recipes have been modernized, that is, made over to 
fit present conditions in small town and farm homes, and both 
the old and the new have been standardized so that accurate 
measurements will assure success. It is my hope that these 
recipes and labor-saving suggestions will be helpful to thousands 
of homemakers as they strive to maintain the thrifty, substan- 
tial type of homes upon which the American nation has been 
built.

THE FARM 
COOK AND RULE BOOK 



CHAPTER 1 
MEASURING FOODS 

Best results are obtained from the recipes in this book by 
using level measurements. A spoonful of any dry ingredient is 
measured by leveling the surface with the straight edge of a 
knife. 

Half a spoonful is a spoonful divided lengthwise with the 
point of a knife. One-fourth of a spoonful is a half-spoonful 
divided crosswise a little nearer the handle end of the bowl. 
One-eighth of a spoonful is a fourth-spoonful divided lengthwise. 
Measuring spoons, which consist of spoons holding one, one- 
half, one-fourth and one-eighth spoonfuls fastened together on 
a ring, do away with the necessity of dividing the spoonful. 

A cupful is a cup level full. To take this measurement pile 
the dry ingredient lightly in the cup with a spoon and then 
level it off with the straight edge of a knife. 

In measuring dry food materials, such as flour, baking powder 
and soda, care should be taken not to press or pack them down. 
Flour is sifted once before ■ being measured. Fats, such as 
butter or lard, are packed tightly before being leveled. To 
measure less than a cupful, time is saved by using a tablespoon 
instead of a cup. A cupful or a spoonful of liquid is all that 
the cup or spoon will hold.

Oven Temperatures 

Slow Oven — ^250 to 365 degrees Fahrenheit 
Moderate Oven — 365 to 410 degrees F. 
Hot Oven — 410 to 450 degrees F. 
Very Hot Oven — 450 to 550 degrees F. 

These temperatures are to be used with ovens having direct 
heat, such as gas and kerosene. If oven door "thermostats/' 
like those on many wood and coal ranges, are registering the 
heat, subtract from 50 to 60 degrees from the temperatures in 
the above table. The following tabulation of temperatures for 
baking in the ordinary household range has been made by the 
United States Department of Agriculture. 

Biscuits — 400 to 500 degrees F. 

Bread— 350 to 425 degrees F. 

Angel Food Cake — 300 to 375 degrees F. 

Cookies— 350 to 400 degrees F. 

Cup Cakes — 300 to 400 degrees F. 

Gingerbread — 350 to 400 degrees F. 

Layer Cake — 300 to 400 de^ees F. 

Loaf Cake— 280 to 400 degrees F. 

Sponge Cake— 300 to 375 degrees F. 

Custard— 250 to 350 degrees F. 

Meat, roasted — 450 to 550 degrees F. for searing, then reduce to 350 

and on to 250 degrees F. 
Muffins— 375 to 425 degrees F. 
Pastry, no filling — 450 to 400 degrees F. 
Pies, uncooked filling — 500 to 400 degrees F., gradually reducing to 

the lower temperature. 
Popovers— 450 to 350 degrees F. 



CHAPTER 2 
BEVERAGES 

The most common beverages are water, milk, coffee, tea, 
chocolate, cocoa and the fruit juices. Water, the natural bev- 
erage, forms a large part of all others. Although milk is a drink, 
it also is a food. It contains the substances needed for the 
growth, development and upkeep of the body in better propor- 
tions than any other food. For this reason it should have an 
important place in the diet of everyone, especially of the child. 

Coffee and tea have a better flavor and are more wholesome 
if not allowed to stand on the grounds and leaves after being 
made. If they cannot be served at once, they may be poured 
in a warm china, silver or earthenware pot or pitcher. 

Cocoa and chocolate are cooked in a small amount of water 
until smooth and glossy before being combined with milk. This 
cooks the starch and therefore prevents the beverage from having 
a raw taste. Since sugar does not dissolve quickly in cold 
liquids, it is advisable to boil it with water to form a syrup, 
which is cooled before being added to the fruit drink. 

Percolated Coffee 

For a rather strong beverage, use from l^^ to 2 tablespoonfuls 
of coffee ground medium fine to every cup of water. The water 
may be hot or cold ; place it in the bottom part of the percolator 
and do not pour it over the grounds. Let the water percolate 
slowly for 10 minutes, but do not let it reach the boiling point. 

If a small amount of coffee is being made in a large percola- 
tor, set the percolator back on the range where there is sufficient 
heat to make the water bubble over the grounds without boiling. 

Boiled Coffee witli Egg 

1 cupful coffee 2^4 cupfuls cold water 

1 egg or 3 egg shellB 6 cupfuls boiling water 

5 



6 THE FARM COOK AND EULE BOOK 

Mir coffee, egg and 2 cupfuls of cold water together. Boil 
3 minutes. Add boiling water and allow to boil up at once. 
Draw to the back of the range, add the % cupful of cold water 
and let stand a minute to settle. Add the egg or egg shells to 
clear the decoction. 

Drip or Filtered Caffee 

Va cupful finely ground coffee 4 cupfuls boiling water 

Put coffee into strainer or pot. Gradually pour in the water, 
a half cupful at a time, keeping the pot covered between times. 
The coffee may be poured through the grounds a second time if 
desired. Another way to make this coffee is to place the grounds 
in an unbleached muslin bag and pour hot water through this 
steadily, letting this drain into a pitcher from which it may be 
served. 

After-dinner Coffee 

Make coffee double strength and serve it clear in small cups. 

Steeped Coffee 

Use 1 tablespoonful of medium fine ground coffee for every 
cupful of water. Add 1 extra tablespoonful of coffee. Place 
the coffee in the pot and pour the boiling water over it. Steep 

5 minutes or longer, according to taste, over a slow fire. Settle 
with a dash of cold water and serve at once. 

Iced Coffee 

Make a strong coffee infusion, using the recipe for Percolated 
or Boiled Coffee. Pour the beverage into a pitcher and allow to 
cool. Serve iced with cream and sugar. A tablespoonful of 
whipped cream or vanilla ice cream may be added to every glass 
filled with iced coffee. 

Tea 

6 teaspoonfuls tea 6 cupfuls water 

Scald the earthenware utensil or pot, put in the tea leaves 
and pour over them the fresh water just brought to the boiling 
point. Cover and steep 3 minutes. Strain and serve at once. 



BEVERAGES 7 

Iced Tea 

Use one-fourth more tea than is used in making hot tea and 
prepare in the same way, only steep o minutes instead of 3. 
Pour off from the leaves and let cool. When cool, dilute with 
ice water if a weaker beverage is desired and add ice. For spe- 
cial occasions a tablespoonful of lemon ice may be added to every 
glass filled with iced tea, or orange ice may be used instead. A 
few sprigs of crushed mint and slices of lemon provide other 
variations. 

Cocoa 

6 tablespoonfuls cocoa 4% cupfuls milk 

5 tablespoonfuls sugar 1% cupfuls water 

■14 teaspoonful salt % teaspoonful vanilla 

Mix cocoa, sugar and salt. Add the boiling water and boil 
until the mixture is smooth and glossy. Add milk and heat to 
the scalding point. Beat with a Dover egg beater if one is avail- 
able and add the vanilla just before serving. A marshmallow 
or spoonfuls of whipped cream may be added to every cupful of 
the hot cocoa. 

Breakfast Cocoa with Egg 

1% teaspoonfuls cocoa % cupful milk 

1% teaspoonfuls sugar % teaspoonful salt 

2 tablespoonfuls boiling water 1 egg 

Mix the cocoa, sugar and salt and add the water. Bring to the 
boiling point, stirring constantly, and boil 2 minutes. Turn into 
the scalded milk and beat. Beat an egg to a light froth and add 
the cocoa gradually, beating constantly. This makes a nutritious 
beverage for a child or a person who is ill. 

Chocolate 

1% squares chocolate 1% cupfuls boiling water 

6 tablespoonfuls sugar 414 cupfuls scalded milk 

% teaspoonful salt 

Melt chocolate over hot water. Add sugar and salt. Add the 
water gradually, stirring constantly, and boil until smooth and 
glossy. Pour into the milk, reheat and beat with a Dover egg 
beater just before serving.

ture constantly until the boiling point is reached and occasionally 
afterward. Add milk, bring to the boiling point and add 
vanilla. Beat 1 minute and serve with marshmallows or stiffly 
beaten cream. This cocoa will stand for hours and improve with 
the standing. There will be no settlings in the bottom of the 
utensil in which it is placed. This serves 10 persons. 



CHAPTER 3 

YEAST BREADS 

Good bread may be obtained by the use and careful manipula- 
tion of wholesome materials. The flour should be creamy white 
and free from contamination by molds, bacteria and insects. 
The yeast must be fresh with the well-known yeasty odor. Of 
course, it must not be sour. The shortening should have a good 
flavor. 

What is the Ideal Loaf? 

In making bread for exhibits at fairs and for use at home 
quite frequently the question is asked: What is the ideal loaf? 
The appearance of the loaf is the first factor of importance. 
The crust should be of an even golden brown color on the top, 
bottom and sides. The sides are straight and the top is slightly 
rounded. The surface is free from cracks and creases. 

One of the necessary requirements of the ideal loaf is a pleas- 
ing fresh or nutty flavor with no trace of a sour or acid taste. 
Thoroughness of baking influences both the flavor and the ap- 
pearance of the loaf. A way to determine whether the baking 
is thorough is to cut a slice from a newly baked loaf and then 
press the two crusts together. If the loaf springs back in shape 
again with no injury to the crumb, the baking is thorough. 

The crumb should be of a creamy white color and feathery in 
appearance ; the openings in it should be small and of a uniform 
size. 

Yeasts for Bread Making 

If compressed yeast is used, one should be certain that it is 
fresh. The cakes which have patches or streaks of black on them 
should be discarded. Since very high or low temperatures de- 
stroy the yeast plant, only lukewarm liquids are used in bread 
making. When liquid yeast is the form used, it should be kept 

12 



YEAST BEEADS 13 

covered and in a cool place from one baking day to another. It 
produces best results when used frequently. Water, potato 
water, whey, whole milk and skim milk are liquids suitable for 
use in bread. Milk should always be scalded and cooled until 
lukewarm before being added to the dough. 

Oaring for the Sponge and Dough 

Bread sponge should be kept at ordinary room temperature, 
around 70 degrees Fahrenheit, unless one uses the straight dough 
method and does not let the sponge stand overnight. In such 
cases a warmer temperature, one from 80 to 88 degrees Fahren- 
heit, is more satisfactory. 

The dough should be covered tightly with a lid or clean towel 
to keep a crust from forming on top due to surface evaporation. 
Sponge standing overnight may be kept in the oven of the range, 
the well of a fireless cooker with the radiator slightly heated or 
in a sponge-box ; the directions for making this device are found 
elsewhere in this book. 

After bread dough is kneaded, it is allowed to rise until double 
in bulk. Then it is kneaded lightly, cut in divisions, shaped into 
loaves and placed in the pans, taking care that it is pushed well 
into the corners. Individual bread tins produce a loaf with a 
uniform crust on all surfaces. If they are used, the tins, not the 
bread, are greased. When more than one loaf is baked in a tin, 
the bread is greased so that the loaves can be separated when 
baked. The loaves should rise double their bulk before being 
baked. 

Temperature Needs Attention 

A hot oven is desirable for the first 15 minutes of baking, but 
after that the temperature is reduced gradually so that the loaves 
wiU not be browned too much and too thick a crust will not be 
formed. If an oven thermometer is used, it should register at 
400 to 420 degrees Fahrenheit during the first 15 minutes and 
then the temperature should be reduced to 365 degrees Fahren- 
heit. These temperatures are for use with the gas and kerosene 
heated oven. Eeduce the heat from 50 to 70 degrees in the range 
oven with a thermostat in the door. When a thermometer is not 
available for judging the temperature, one can tell when the 



14 THE FARM COOK AND EULE BOOK 

oven heat is right by spreading 1 teaspoonful of flour one-fourth 
inch thick on a small tin, like a lid to a jelly glass, and setting 
this in the oven. If it is browned throughout in 5 minutes, the 
temperature is right for inserting the bread to be baked. If a 
tender crust is desired, brush the dough with melted butter, and 
if a crisp crust is wanted, brush the tops of the loaves with 
slightly beaten egg white. It requires from 50 to 60 minutes to 
bake bread. 

Storing Bread 

After the bread is removed from the oven, it is taken out of 
the pans and placed on a wire rack or across the edges of the 
pans to cool. Bread is not covered while cooling unless the 
covering is necessary for protection from flies, dirt or insects. 
When the loaves are thoroughly cool, they are placed in a clean, 
well ventilated and covered tin or aluminum box or in a stone 
crock. 

YEASTS 

Dry Yeast 

Place 2 cupfuls of strong hops or peach leaves in 2 quarts of 
water and let this boil 30 minutes. Sift 4 cupfuls of flour into an 
earthenware crock or jar and pour the boiling hop water into it, 
stirring constantly. Set the mixture in a cool place. When 
lukewarm add 1 cupful of dry yeast which has been moistened in 
lukewarm water. Set in a warm place until the batter rises, 
then stir down. Continue this process until the fermentation 
ceases, which will be about 2 days. 

Then pour the yeast into a quart of sifted cornmeal. Add 
sufficient meal to make a dough stiff enough for kneading. 
Knead well, roll 1 inch thick, cut in squares, place on a cloth. 
Cover with another cloth and set aside to dry in a room where 
there is no danger of freezing. Turn frequently until these yeast 
cakes are thoroughly dry. 

Buttermilk Yeast 

Scald 2 cupfuls of buttermilk, add 1/2 cupful of sugar, 2 table- 
spoonfuls of salt and stir in sufficient flour to thicken. When 



YEAST BREADS 15 

cool add 1 yeast cake which has been dissolved in 1/4 cupful of 
lukewarm water. Stir in cornmeal to make a stiff dough, shape 
into cakes with the hands and dry in a moderately warm room. 

Potato Yeast 

4 medium-sized potatoes 4 tablespoonfuls sugar 

4 cupfuls boiling water 2 teaspoonfuls salt 

1 cake dry yeast 

Grate the pared potatoes into the boiling water and boil until 
the starch is cooked, stirring constantly. Stir in the sugar and 
salt while the mixture is hot, cool to lukewarm, then add the 
yeast cake which has been broken up and soaked in a little luke- 
warm water. Put into a clean jar and allow to ferment 24 hours, 
then set in a cool, dark place. This will keep 2 weeks, and the 
last cupful may be used in place of a dry yeast cake in making 
a new supply. 

White Bread (Straight Dough Method) 

4 cupfuls liquid 4 teaspoonfuls salt 

3 tablespoonfuls sugar % to 1 cupful potato yeast or 

2 tablespoonfuls shortening 1 cake compressed yeast 

14 to 16 cupfuls flour 

Mix the sugar, shortening and salt in a large mixing bowl or 
a bread mixer and add the liquid. Milk, whey, potato water or 
water may be used. Milk is always scalded before being added 
to the other ingredients. Cool the mixture, stirring occasionally. 
When lukewarm, add the yeast. If potato yeast is used, shake it 
thoroughly before adding and use 31/2 cupfuls of liquid instead 
of 4 cupfuls. When compressed yeast is used, it is softened by 
being soaked in 14 cupful of lukewarm water. If one is in a 
hurry, the amount of compressed yeast may be increased to 1% 
or 2 cakes. After the yeast is added, stir in the flour gradually, 
beating thoroughly after every addition. 

Add flour until the dough can be lifted in a mass on a spoon, 
leaving the bowl or bread mixer free from dough. Turn on a 
floured board, if a bread mixer is not used, and knead lightly, 
keeping a small amount of flour on the board, until the dough 
is smooth, elastic to touch and stiff enough that it will not stick 
to a clean board or to the hands. It takes about 10 minutes to 
knead bread by hand and from 3 to 4 minutes in a bread mixer. 



16 THE FARM COOK AND EULE BOOK 

After kneading the dough, place it in a clean bowl or leave it 
in the bread mixer, cover to prevent the formation of a crust 
on top and let rise until double in bulk. Set in a place of uni- 
form temperature and away from drafts. When light, knead on 
the unfloured board or in the bread mixer long enough to dis- 
tribute the gas bubbles evenly. This takes only a few minutes. 
Shape into 4 loaves and place in oiled pans, pressing well into 
the corners. Let rise again until double in bulk and bake in a 
hot oven, decreasing the heat somewhat after the first 15 min- 
utes of baking. 

White Bread (Sponge Method) 

4 cupfuls liquid % cupful potato yeast or 

3 tablespoonfuls sugar 1 cake of dry yeast 
2 tablespoonfuls shortening 14 to 16 cupfuls flour 

4 teaspoonfuls salt 1 cupful mashed potato (if desired) 

Soak the dry yeast 30 minutes in lukewarm liquid. Add the 
potato and salt to the scalded milk or to any liquid, such as 
potato water, water or whey, which one wishes to use. If mashed 
potatoes are added, use 3% cupfuls of liquid instead of the 4 
cupfuls. When this mixture is lukewarm, add the yeast. 

In case potato yeast is used, the amount of liquid is decreased 
because the yeast is in liquid form. When liquid yeast and 
potatoes are used, the total amount of milk, whey, water or 
potato water added should be 3 cupfuls. If the liquid yeast is 
used without the addition of potatoes, 3% cupfuls of the liquid 
are added. 

Add 6 cupfuls of flour, beat until the mixture is smooth, cover 
and set to rise overnight in a place having a temperature of 
from 60 to 70 degrees Fahrenheit. Shape into 4 loaves and 
place in oiled pans, pressing well into the corners. Let rise again 
until double in bulk and bake. 

White Bread (Quick Sponge Method) 

2% cupfuls liquid 2 tablespoonfuls shortening 

4 teaspoonfuls salt % cupful potato yeast 

2 tablespoonfuls sugar 1 cupful mashed potato 

12 to 16 cupfuls flour 

Scald the milk or add the other liquids such as whey, water 
and potato water, if they are used instead, and stir in the sugar, 
salt and shortening. When the mixture is lukewarm, add the 



YEAST BREADS 17 

yeast, potato and 6 cupfuls of flour, beating until smooth. 
Cover and let rise in a warm place. When quite light and full 
of bubbles, which will be in about II/2 hours, break up the sponge 
with a spoon and add sufficient flour that the dough may be 
kneaded. Knead and follow the directions for making bread by 
the sponge method. 

If one wishes to use compressed yeast instead of the potato 
yeast, from 1% to 2 cakes will give good results. This is dis- 
solved in a small amount of the lukewarm liquid and instead of 
using 2% cupfuls of the liquid, as is the case with potato yeast, 
use 31^ cupfuls. 

Graham Bread 

Use the same ingredients as for White Bread, only substitute 
Graham or whole wheat flour for one-half of the flour. Mix 
either by the Straight Dough or Sponge Method. 

Rye Bread 

A simple and easy way to make a couple of loaves of rye bread 
when the dough for white bread is mixed stiff and is ready to 
be made into loaves is to take 6 cupfuls of the dough and add 
to it 1/^ cupful of molasses, % teaspoonful of salt and 2 cupfuls 
of rye meal. Work in the hands until the ingredients are mixed 
in the dough. If the mixture is not stiff enough to mold into 
loaves, add just enough wheat flour so it can be shaped properly. 
Let rise until light and bake.

yeast or the dry yeast, which has been soaked 30 minutes in 14 
cupful of lukewarm water. Add the salt and 1% cupfuls of 
flour. Beat until smooth, cover and set to rise overnight. In 
the morning break up the sponge with a spoon, add the sugar, 
shortening, well beaten egg and enough flour to make a dough 
that may be kneaded. Knead until the dough is smooth, elastic 
and no longer sticks to the board or the fingers. Cover and let 
rise. Then turn on a board, knead lightly and roll % inch thick. 
Cut with an oval or round floured cutter. Crease in the middle 
with a floured knife handle, rub one half with melted butter and 
fold over. Place the rolls one inch apart in an oiled tin and let

the surface of the rolls with melted butter. Have the cut side 
up. Cover and let rise until double in bulk. Bake in a moder- 
ate oven 35 minutes. 

Dinner Rolls 

Use the same ingredients as for Parkerhouse rolls. Shape 
the dough in small biscuits, place in rows on a floured board, 
cover with a cloth and let rise until very light. Flour the 
handle of a knife and make a deep crease in the middle of each 
roll. Take up and press the edges together. Place closely in a

buttered tin, after rubbing the surface of the rolls with melted 
butter, cover, let rise until light and bake 15 or 20 minutes in 
a hot oven. 

Crescents 

When the dough for Parkerhouse rolls is light, roll in a sheet 
% of an inch in thickness and cut strips about 4 inches wide; 
cut these in sharp pointed triangles, then beginning at the base, 
roll them up, bringing the ends toward each other, keeping the 
point in the middle of the roll to give the shape of a crescent. 
Place some distance apart on an oiled tin and let rise until 
light. Bake from 15 to 20 minutes.

14 inch in thickness, cut in strips % inch wide and then braid 
them in 3 or 4 strands, having the braids wider in the center 
than at the ends. When light bake 15 or 20 minutes in a hot 
oven. 

Raisin Coffee Bread 

2 cupfuls bread dough % teaspoonful nutmeg

2 tablespoonfuls butter % cupful chopped raisins 

% cupful sugar 2 tablespoonfuls powdered sugar 

Work the egg, melted butter, sugar, l^ teaspoonful of the cin- 
namon and the floured raisins into the dough. If additional 
flour is needed to make a soft dough, add it and work it in with 
the fingers. Place the loaf in an oiled round pan and sprinkle 
the top with the rest of the cinnamon which is mixed with the 
powdered sugar. Let rise until light and bake from 30 to 40 
minutes. Chopped dates or currants may be used instead of the

sponge. Let stand until small bubbles appear on the surface. 



22 THE FAEM COOK AND EULE BOOK 

Usually this takes about 1% hours. Then add sufficient flour 
to make a dough which may be kneaded. Knead until the 
dough is elastic and smooth, then place it in a covered mixing 
bowl and set in the refrigerator or some equally cool place. Do 
not let freeze, for very low temperatures destroy yeast. This 
dough may be used any time after standing 24 hours. The 
amount for biscuits or rolls is pinched off, shaped, allowed to 
rise and when light, the dough is baked in a hot oven. To pre- 
vent the formation of a crust on the dough, it should be kept 
covered, and it will spoil if not kept in a cool place.

far enough from the coals that the bread will not burn. When 
dry and a golden brown on one side, turn and brown on the 
other side. Bread may be browned in the oven but this gives 
a harder toast. 

Milk Toast

CHAPTER 7 
CAKES 

Cakes are divided into two classes, those which contain butter 
and those which do not contain butter. 

To be successful in cake making the best ingredients, accurate 
measurements and the right oven temperatures must be used. 
Loaf cakes require an oven warm enough to turn a little flour 
light brown in 4 minutes, or a temperature of about 350 de- 
grees Fahrenheit. Layer and cup cakes require a somewhat 
warmer oven, a temperature of 375 degrees Fahrenheit, while 
sponge cakes are best baked in a slower oven, or one with a 
temperature of approximately 300 degrees Fahrenheit. If a 
thermostat in the oven door is used to measure the temperature 
instead of an oven thermometer, subtract about 50 degrees from 
these temperatures. A small pan of water set in one corner 
of a kerosene or gas heated oven helps to insure even baking. 

Baking Suggestions 

The time of baking is divided into quarters. During the 
first quarter the cake should begin to rise, in the second it 
should continue to rise and begin to brown, in the third it 
should continue to brown, and in the fourth it should finish 
browning and shrink from the pan. 

Cake pans are oiled lightly or are lined with oiled paper 
before the batter is poured into them. The pans should be 
about three-fourths full of the batter which is spread evenly 
toward the sides and corners. Cake is baked as near the center 
of the oven as is possible. 

Mistakes to Avoid 

When the cake breaks open on top, it is a sign that the oven 
was too hot when the batter was inserted or that too much flour 

35 



36 THE FARM COOK AND RULE BOOK 

was used. A soggy, heavy cake contains too little flour and too 
much sugar and fat. A cake which runs over the edges of the 
pan contains too much baking powder or it was baked in an 
oven that was not hot enough. 

Since it is sometimes necessary to make substitutions in cake 
making, this table of equivalents may be helpful ■

CHAPTER 9 

CEEEALS 

Most cereals are at their best when cooked slowly several hours 
in a double boiler. When this utensil is not available, a small 
saucepan set in a kettle containing water may be used. The 
fireless cooker is well adapted to the cookery of cereals, since the 
cooking can take place during the night so the food will be ready 
for breakfast in the morning. Cereals cooked the day before 
they are to be used should not be stirred when being reheated 
over hot water at breakfast time. If 2 tablespoonfuls of cold 
water are poured on top of the cooked cereal, no crust will form 
during the standing. 

Directions for Cooking 

Add 1/2 teaspoonful of salt to every cupful of boiling water 
used. Stir i/o cupful of whole or cracked cereal, such as cracked 
wheat or barley, macaroni, rice and hominy, into 2 cupfuls of 
boiling water and cook on the stove 10 minutes, stirring con- 
stantly. Then transfer to a double boiler and cook from 1 to 3 
hours. 

Use 1 cupful of flaked cereal, such as oatmeal or flaked wheat, 
in 2 cupfuls of boiling water and cook on the stove 10 minutes, 
stirring constantly. Then transfer to the double boiler and cook 
from 1/^ to 3 hours. 

Three tablespoonfuls of granular cereal, of which cornmeal 
and cream of wheat, rye or barley are examples, are used in 1 
cupful of boiling water. Cook on the stove 15 minutes, stirring 
constantly, and then cook from 1 to 4 hours in a double boiler. 

Fruits Are Added 

For the sake of variety fruits may be cooked with the cereal. 
Quartered dates, chopped figs, raisins, shredded prunes and quar- 
tered apples are some of the favorites.

oughly washed rice slowly, stirring gently with a fork. When 
all the rice is added, let it boil until the kernels are tender. 
Then drain it through a sieve and pour cold water on the rice 
to separate the kernels. Place the cold rice in a colander or 
pan and set in the oven a few minutes to warm if it is to be 
served hot. One cupful of rice when cooked will measure almost 
4 cupfuls. 

Boiled Macaroni 

Break the macaroni in one inch pieces and cook as boiled rice.

CHAPTER 10 
CANDIES AND CONFECTIONS 

The secret of successful candy making is to keep the syrup 
from crystallizing. Several precautions may be heeded to ac- 
complish this. First of all, boil the sugar and liquid together in 
a thick kettle or saucepan. 

Stir until the sugar is dissolved and then cook without moving 
or shaking the kettle containing the boiling syrup. Wipe off 
the crystals of sugar that form on the sides of the kettle with a 
cloth moistened in water and tied over the tines of a fork. If 
one wishes, a few drops of any acid, such as vinegar or lemon 
juice, may be added to prevent crystallization. Cream of tartar 
may also be used for this purpose. If the candy contains grains, 
add water to soften it and reboil. 

Testing Candy 

If one has a candy thermometer, it is easy to determine when 
the candy is cooked. The soft ball stage is reached when the 
thermometer registers from 236 to 240 degrees F. ; the hard ball 
at 254 degrees F. ; the soft crack at 260 degrees F. ; and the hard 
crack at 290 degrees F. 

Without a thermometer the tests are made by dropping a 
small portion of the boiling syrup from the spoon into a cupful 
of cold water. If the mixture makes up into a soft ball, it is 
the soft ball stage ; if it forms a rather hard ball, it is the hard 
ball stage; if the mixture becomes crisp and too hard to form a 
hard ball when crushed between the fingers, it is the soft crack 
stage; and if it cracks or breaks when crushed between the fin- 
gers, the hard crack stage is reached. 

To Caxamelize Sugar 

When caramelized sugar is called for in a recipe, it may be 
prepared by placing granulated sugar in a frying pan and melt- 

55 



56 THE FARM COOK AND RULE BOOK 

ing it on the stove without the addition of water. The sugar 
must be stirred constantly while being melted. When it be- 
comes a light brown, or a golden brown, mass, it is caramelized. 
Caramelized syrup is made by boiling water and sugar together 
beyond the hard crack stage or until the syrup becomes a golden 
brown. The main precaution to heed in this process is to stir 
the syrup and to remove it from the stove as soon as it is cara- 
melized, in this way avoiding all traces of scorch. 

Peppermint Circles 

% cupful sugar 3 tablespoonfuls water 

5 drops oil of peppermint 

Stir the ingredients together and place on the stove. When 
the sugar begins to melt, stir for several minutes. Drop small 
spoonfuls of the syrup on oiled paper. 

Cocoanut Candy 

1^ cupfuls sugar 3 tablespoonfuls butter 

14 cupful milk % cupful shredded cocoanut 

Boil the sugar and milk together until they form a soft ball 
when dropped in cold water. Add the butter and cocoanut. Boil 
3 minutes and pour into an oiled pan. Mark in squares. Soak 
the cocoanut in a little milk before using. 

Maple Squares 

2% cupfuls maple sugar 1 teaspoonful vanilla 

% cupful water % cupful nut meats 

% pound marshmallows % cupful preserved fruit 

Boil the sugar and water to the soft ball stage. Remove from 
the stove and add the marshmallows, nuts, preserved or candied 
fruit and the vanilla. Beat until the mixture begins to harden. 
Pour into oiled pans and mark in squares.

3 cupfuls thin cream 

Put the sugar and syrup in a saucepan and add 1 cupful of 
the cream. Bring to the boiling point and cook to the soft ball 



CANDIES AND CONFECTIONS 57 

stage. Stir constantly to prevent burning, but do not beat. 
When the soft ball stage is reached, add a second cupful of cream 
and cook again until a soft ball is formed when a few drops are 
tried in cold water. Then add the third cupful of cream. Cook 
until a firm ball is made when a little of the syrup is dropped in 
cold water. Pour the hot syrup in oiled pans and mark off in 
squares. One cupful of nut meats or shredded cocoanut may be 
added to the caramel syrup just before it is poured into the pans. 
If this candy is packed, wrap every piece in oiled paper. 

Peanut Brittle 

2 cupfuls sugar 1 cupful shelled peanuts 

Melt the sugar in a frying pan, stirring constantly until the 
mixture is a golden brown syrup. Remove from the stove 
immediately, stir in the chopped peanuts and pour on a well oiled 
platter. When cold, break in pieces with the handle of a knife. 

Layer Candy 

2 cupfuls sugar 1 teaspoonful vanilla 

1 cupful milk % cupful nut meats

mixture is light and foamy and then pour it on the candy covered 
with the fruit preserves. When cold, cut in squares. 



58 THE FARM COOK AND RULE BOOK 

Chocolate Squares 

2 cupfuls sugar 1 cupful milk 

1 square chocolate 2 tablespoonfuls butter 

Boil the sugar and milk to the soft ball stage. Do not stir 
during the cooking, that is, not after the sugar is dissolved. Just 
before taking the mixture from the stove, add the chocolate and 
butter which have been melted over hot water. Cool; then beat 
until thick. Pour into a buttered pan and mark in squares. If 
one wishes, % cupful of nut meats may be added. 

Taffy

CANDIES AXD CONFECTIONS 59 

Cook syrup, sugar and water to 240 degrees Fahrenheit or 
until the syrup forms a rather firm soft ball when dropped in 
cold water. Pour a part of this on the stiffly beaten egg white, 
beating constantly. Return the rest of the syrup to the stove 
and cook to 260 degrees F. or to the soft crack stage. Pour this 
on the egg white mixture slowly, beating all the time. Add the 
vanilla and nuts. When the mixture begins to thicken so it 
cannot be beaten, pour it into a pan lined with oiled paper. 
When nearly cold, remove from the pan and cut in squares. 



Fairyland Fondant 

2y2 pounds sugar ^4 teaspoonful cream of tartar 

1^ cupfuls water flavoring 

Cook the sugar and water together slowly, stirring constantly 
until the sugar is dissolved. Then bring quickly to the boiling 
point, add cream of tartar and cease stirring. Boil until the 
syrup forms a rather firm soft ball when dropped in cold water. 
Then wipe the sides of the pan with a fork, having the tines 
wrapped with a moistened cloth. Pour the candy quickly on a 
moistened platter ; the platter should be rinsed in cold water and 
not dried. Do not let the syrup drain from the pan but pour 
quickly. Cool until the mixture is lukewarm. Then stir with a 
knife until it is creamy and white. Form into a large ball with 
the hands, place in an earthen jar or crock and cover with a 
dampened cloth. It may be left overnight or molded right away. 

When ready to mold the candy, rub some powdered sugar on 
the hands so the work may be done quickly. Work any desired 
flavoring, such as vanilla, lemon, orange, clove, peppermint and 
wintergreen into the fondant, color with a vegetable coloring if 
white candy is not desired, and mold in small pieces. Nut meats, 
candied fruits, dates or raisins may be used as centers. 



Mints 

Melt some of the fondant over hot water, flavor with a few 
drops of oil of peppermint, wintergreen, cinnamon, clove or 
orange and color delicately if desired. Drop from a spoon on to 
oiled paper. These mints may be dipped in chocolate when cold. 



60 THE FAKM COOK AND RULE BOOK 

Bonbons 

Prepare the centers for bonbons by adding flavoring, chopped 
nuts, candied fruit or any coloring desired to fondant. Shape 
this into balls and let stand overnight. Nuts, candied cherries or 
other fruits may be used as the centers if one wishes. 

To make the chocolate for dipping, cut a % pound cake of 
dipping or coating chocolate in small pieces and place in the 
upper part of a double boiler. Do not let the water below it boil. 
To the chocolate add 1 level tablespoonful of butter, olive oil or 
any good salad oil. When the chocolate is melted, pour a part 
of it in a shallow dish. If you have a candy thermometer, insert 
it in the chocolate and let the mass cool to 80 degrees F., manip- 
ulating the mixture all the time with the fingers. This distrib- 
utes the butter or oil throughout the chocolate, making it smooth 
and glossy. When the chocolate begins to harden a little on the 
sides of the dish, it is time to dip the candies, and this work 
should be done quickly. 

Roll the center in the chocolate, pick it up with the thumb and 
first finger and rub oif the surplus chocolate with the other hand. 
Place on a pan covered with oiled paper, bringing the fingers up 
over the top to form any desired design on the bonbon. When 
the chocolate becomes too cool for dipping, it is no longer smooth 
and it will not slip from the fingers easily. Add to it some of the 
chocolate in the double boiler over hot, but not boiling, water 
and proceed as before. 

Honey Kisses

Cook the sugar, syrup, water and butter to the soft ball stage, 
or until a small portion of the syrup dropped in cold water forms 
a firm soft ball. Pour this over popped corn. Mix well and 
when slightly cool press into balls. Use enough com to make 
about 18 balls from this amount of syrup. 



62 THE FAEM COOK AND EULE BOOK 

SYRUPS 
Sugar Syrup 

1 cupful sugar V2 cupful hot water 

Boil these ingredients together 5 minutes. Sen^e hot, or if the 
syrup is to be kept, bottle. 

Fruit Syrup 

Add the juice and pulp of any fresh fruit to the sugar syrup. 
Orange and lemon syrups are winter favorites. Canned pine- 
apples may be used in this way. Strawberry and raspberry 
syrups are delicious in the berry season. 

Jam Syrup 

To the sugar syrup recipe add 4 tablespoonfuls of strawberry, 
raspberry, blackberry, grape, plum or any other fruit jam. 
Orange marmalade may be used. 

Winter Fruit Syrup 

Add 1 cupful of the juice from canned apricots, peaches, 
strawberries or other canned fruit to V2 cupful of sugar. Boil 
until the syrup thickens slightly. Add a few bits of the canned 
fruit and serve warm on pancakes, fritters, biscuits or waffles. 



CANDIED FRUITS 
Candied Apples 

6 small apples 2% cupfuls sugar 

1% cupfuls water 

Pare and core the apples and cut in fourths. Make a syrup by 
boiling the sugar with the water 3 minutes. When the syrup is 
boiling, add the apples and simmer, but do not boil, 4 minutes. 
Remove from the stove and let stand overnight in the syrup. 
The next morning simmer the apples until tender, drain and roll 
in shredded cocoanut. 



CANDIES AND CONFECTIONS 63 

Taffy Apples 

Eemove the cores from red apples and fill the cavities with 
chopped nuts, raisins or dates. Fasten every apple to a small 
stick or skewer to be used in holding them while dipping and 
eating the fruit. Make a syrup by boiling 1 cupful of white 
sugar, 1 cupful of brown sugar, I/2 cupful of water and i/^ cupful 
of vinegar together. Cook until the mixture cracks when a small 
portion is dropped in cold water and pushed together with the 
fingers. Dip the apples in this, making certain that they are 
coated thoroughly. 

Candied Cherries 

Stone the cherries, saving any juice that is extracted. Place 
2 cupfuls of sugar and 2 cupfuls of water in a kettle and stir 
until the sugar is dissolved. Then add a pinch of cream of tartar 
and boil until a thick syrup is made. Skim thoroughly, add the 
stoned cherries and cook gently until the fruit is tender. Drain 
the cherries and place on platters to dry. When thoroughly dry, 
pack in boxes, lining them with oiled paper, placing this paper 
between every layer of fruit and sprinkling liberally with sugar. 
Put cover on box, wrap with paper and store in a dry place. 

Candied Pears 

Peel, core and cut the pears into halves. Make a thick syrup 
by boiling 2 cupfuls of sugar and 1 cupful of water together. 
Drop the pears in this and let them cook slowly until they are 
tender, but not broken. Eemove from the stove and let stand in 
a cool place for 2 days. Then drain and sprinkle sugar over the 
pears. Let them dry slowly in the sun or in a slow oven^ leaving 
the oven door open. Pack in glass jars, sprinkling generously 
with sugar, and cover. 

Candied Pineapple 

Peel the fruit and cut in thick slices. Remove the cores and 
cut the slices in halves. To every pound of pineapple use 1 cup- 
ful of water. Cook slowly until the fruit is clear. Then drain 
and to the liquid add 2 cupfuls of sugar for every pound of fruit. 



64 THE FARM COOK AND RULE BOOK 

Boil the syrup down until about one-third of it is gone ; then add 
the fruit and cook gently until it is transparent. Remove the 
pineapple again and spread on platters. Set in the sun to dry. 
Cook the syrup down again and pour over the pineapple. Let 
dry thoroughly and pack away in glass jarS;, placing sugar and 
rounds of oiled paper between every layer. 

Candied Orange Peel 

Cut the orange peel in long one-fourth inch wide strips, using 
the kitchen scissors for this purpose. Place in a saucepan, add a 
little cold water and bring to the boiling point. Drain off the 
liquid and add cold water and repeat the process of boiling and 
draining three times in all. 

After draining oS the liquid the third time, measure the 
orange peel and to every cupful add 1 cupful of sugar and suffi- 
cient hot water to cover. Cook until the white of the skin is 
translucent. Then remove from the syrup, roll in granulated 
sugar, place on plates to dry and when thoroughly dry, pack in 
boxes between pieces of oiled paper. This candied peel cut in 
bits makes delicious flavoring for many cakes, gingerbreads, 
cookies and puddings. 

Candied Citron 

Peel small citron melons and slice or cut into small pieces. 
Let soak in weak salt water overnight. In the morning drain 
and cover with fresh water ; add a tiny pinch of alum and simmer 
until the melon is clear. Drain and cool. When cold add 2 
cupfuls of sugar to every 2 cupfuls of melon and sufficient water 
to moisten the sugar thoroughly. Return to the fire and simmer 
2 hours. Place the citron on platters and let dry in the sunshine. 
When thoroughly dry, pack in boxes between layers of sugar. A 
few pieces of ginger root may be added with the sugar if one 
desires. 



CHAPTER 11 
CANXIXG 

The purpose of canning foods is twofold; to sterilize, which 
means to kill all living organisms, and to exclude air. Many 
bacteria, yeasts and molds, commonly called germs, are always 
present in air and unless the canned fruits, vegetables and meats 
are kept in air-tight cans, they will spoil even though the sterili- 
zation at the time of the canning is perfect. 

Only firm, wholesome materials should be canned, and best 
results are obtained by canning them as soon as possible after 
they are gathered or picked. Many vegetables, for instance, if 
stored any length of time after being gathered, even for a few 
hours, frequently develop a sour taste that sterilization cannot 
destroy. 

As a matter of safety only good rubbers should be used. A 
satisfactory one should be 1/12 inch thick and elastic enough to 
stretch 5 inches or more and rebound afterward. The color of 
the rubber is not a matter of consequence. 

Types of Canning 

Two types of canning are practised today — the open kettle 
method and the cold pack method. The open kettle method is 
much older than the cold pack system and it is used widely for 
putting up fruits. Since the organisms that attack vegetables 
and meats are more difficult to kill, the sterilization of these 
foods is usually accomplished with the cold pack method by using 
a pressure cooker or some kind of a steam canning outfit. 

If fruit which is being prepared for canning is placed in cold 
water to which 1 tablespoonful of lemon juice is added to every 
quart of water, it retains its color better than if left standing 
without heeding this precaution. 

65 



66 THE FAEM COOK AND EULE BOOK 

Sterilizing Jars and Utensils 

Since the air contains the organisms that spoil foods, all 
utensils nsed in canning, such as cups, spoons, jars, covers and 
kettles, should be sterilized. The jars also should be tested. 
This is done by filling one partly full of water, putting on the 
rubber and lid and inverting the jar. If it leaks, the jar or lid is 
imperfect and should not be used. To sterilize jars, they and 
their lids are washed. Then they are placed on a rack in a large 
kettle and are covered with cold water. This water is heated 
gradually and boiled 15 minutes. 

In filling jars when the open kettle method is used, the hot 
water is emptied out, the can is set on a hot plate and it is filled 
to overflowing with cooked fruit. The rubber, which has been 
dipped in boiling water, is put on and the sterilized lid is 
screwed on at once. The cans are stored in a dark place so the 
light will not cause their contents to fade. 

OPEN KETTLE METHOD 

Canned Peaches 

Dip peaches in scalding water and remove the skin with a 
silver knife. Cut in halves or quarters, remove the stones and 
weigh. Allow % their weight in sugar and 2I/2 cupfuls of 
water to every pound of fruit. Boil the sugar and water together 
until a syrup is made. Then add the peaches and cook them 
gently until tender. Can in sterilized jars and seal. 

Canned Pears 

Pare the fruit with a silver knife, cut in quarters or halves 
and remove the cores. Can like peaches. 

Canned Apples 

Wash, pare and core the apples. Cut in quarters and can like 
peaches. 

Canned Small Fruit 

Pick over and wash the berries or remove the pits from 
cherries or apricots. Cook with a small quantity of water until 



CANXIXG 67 

soft. Allow % cupful of sugar to 4 cupfuls of fruit. Boil a few 
minutes after adding the sugar. Pour into sterile jars and seal. 
More or less sugar may be added to suit individual tastes. 

Canned Rhubarb 

Cut the rhubarb^ after washing thoroughly, in one-inch pieces. 
Place in sterile jars, cover with water which has been boiled and 
cooled. Seal. Gooseberries may be canned in this way. 



COLD PACK METHOD 

The types of canners used in cold pack canning are described 
with other labor-saving devices in another section of this book. 
In this, as in the open kettle method, the fruits and vegetables 
should be freshly picked and sound. After being washed and 
made ready for canning, they are given a hot dip. 

Blancbing 

Blanching consists of putting the prepared food in a square of 
cheesecloth or in a wire basket and placing it in a kettle contain- 
ing enough boiling water to cover it. Count the time as begin- 
ning when the water boils again. The length of time is given in 
the chart. Best results are obtained by hot dipping enough 
vegetables and fruits to fill one or two cans at a time and by 
changing the water used for the scalding frequently. 

Dipping in Cold Water 

Blanching is followed by plunging the food in fresh cold 
water. The cold dip makes it easier to handle the food. 

Packing 

The food is packed in hot, sterile jars immediately after the 
cold dip, and as soon as one jar is packed, it is placed in the 
sterilizing utensil so that undesirable organisms will not have a 
chance to develop while the other cans are being packed. The 
food should not be pressed down very much in the jars. Place 
the rubber on the jar and then add a hot brine to the vegetables 
and a hot syrup to the fruit. The brine is made by filling the jar 



68 THE FARM COOK AND EULE BOOK 

to within % inch of the top with boiling water and adding 1 level 
teaspoonfnl of salt to every quart jar. The syrup is made by 
boiling 12 cupfuls of sugar with 8 cupfuls of water until a thin 
syrup is formed. For very sweet fruits, the syrup may be made 
by boiling 8 cupfuls of sugar with 12 cupfuls of water. The 
syrup is cooled slightly before being poured over the fruits 
packed in the jars. 

Adjusting the Covers 

The cover is put on tight enough that the steam does not 
escape. Screw tops are screwed tight and then are loosened with 
one turn back. Bail cap jars are made ready by placing the 
glass cap in position and pulling the top wire bail in place. In 
using other jar lids follow the directions which are given with 
them. 

Processing 

The time of processing is given in the table. Count the time 
from the minute the water around the cans boils or when the 
pressure is right. 

Sealing 

As soon as the jars are removed from the boiling water or 
steam, seal tightly and invert the jar to make certain that it does 
not leak. In case it leaks, remove the lid and rubber and put on 
another rubber which has been dipped in boiling water. Adjust 
the lid. If the lid is defective instead of the rubber, sterilize 
another by boiling it in water and then adjusting it. Food will 
keep if the can is not filled with the liquid when cool, but if one 
wishes, the space may be filled with boiling water. This loss of 
liquid in the processing may be due to the unevenness of the rack 
in the bottom of the boiler if a homemade canner is used. Or 
this rack may not have held the cans high enough from the 
bottom of the boiler. Some of the liquid may have spilled out 
due to placing the jars unevenly on the rack. Food which is not 
thoroughly blanched frequently is the cause of a partly filled jar, 
or if a pressure cooker is used, the loss of liquid may be caused by 
too much pressure, or improper handling of the pressure.

Sauerkraut — Fill sterile jars and add boiling water to cover. 
Sweet Corn — Remove husk and silk and cut from the cob after 

blanching and cold dipping. Corn swells in canning, so do 

not pack the jars entirely full. 
Hominy — Place in hot, sterilized jars and add boiling water to 

cover. 
Field Corn — Prepare as sweet corn, only the kernels may be put 

through a food chopper if one wishes. 
String Beans — \\^ash and string. These may be left whole or cut 

in pieces. 
Cabbage — Shred. 
Peas — Wash and shell. 
Lima Beans — Wash and shell. 
Cauliflower — Wash, break into clusters, soak in salt water 2 

hours, using 2 teaspoonfuls of salt to 1 quart of water. 
Carrots — Remove tops and scrub. 
Parsnips — Wash and scrape off the skin. 
Beets — Cut off the tops leaving on 3 inches. Wash. 
Sweet Potatoes — Wash and pare. Cut into convenient sections. 
Greens — Pick over and wash in several waters. Instead of 

blanching, steam over water until wilted thoroughly, or 

about 20 minutes. After cold dipping, cut into convenient 

lengths. A few strips of boiled bacon may be added for 

flavor. 
Soft Fruits — This includes apricots, berries, cherries, currants, 

grapes, peaches and plums. Hull, seed, stem and place in 

a colander. Wash by pouring cold water over them. Pack 

into hot jars or cans without crushing, using a spoon. Add 

the syrup. 
Hard Fruits — The common hard fruits are apples, pears and 

quinces. Remove the skin and core, cut in sections and drop 

in slightly salted water. Blanch, cold dip and pack.

72 THE FAEM COOK AND EULE BOOK 

This time schedule is based upon the one-quart pack and upon 
fresh products at altitudes up to 1,000 feet. For higher altitudes 
increase the time 10 per cent for each additional 500 feet. 

When processing fruits in steam-pressure canners, not over 
5 pounds of steam pressure should be used. 

When processing vegetables, do not use over 15 pounds of 
pressure. 

CANNING MEATS 

Meats are either partially cooked before being sterilized or 
they are raw when packed in the jars. It is somewhat easier for 
the inexperienced canner to have good results if the meat is 
cooked a little before being sterilized. This meat may be fried, 
roasted, stewed or broiled, just as it would be for immediate use, 
only it is not cooked until tender. It is seasoned to taste, heated 
throughout and cooked until about three-fourths done. Over- 
cooking, like sterilizing too long, produces a stringy meat which 
shreds when served. 

The jars and lids are boiled in water 15 minutes before the 
meat is packed; the rubbers are dipped in boiling water just 
before they are put on the cans. Raw meat is cut in convenient 
sections for canning, or if it is to be cooked first, it is cut in 
pieces of the right size for the cooking. 

One teaspoonful of salt is added to every quart jar of raw 
meat. Since the partially cooked product is already seasoned, no 
salt is added to it after it is packed in the cans. A little boiling 
water is poured around the raw meat, and the liquor in the 
utensil in which the meat was cooked is added when canning 
partially cooked meat. The rubber is put on and the lid is ad- 
justed just as it is in sterilizing any product by the cold pack 
method. Lids should never be screwed or fastened tightly or the 
glass will break. Tin cans, of course, are closed securely, or 
capped, before being sterilized. 

Time to Sterilize 

All partially cooked meat is sterilized 1% hours in boiling 
water, 1 hour with a water seal outfit, 40 minutes with a pres- 
sure cooker with a pressure of 5 pounds, and 30 minutes with a 
pressure of 15 pounds. Uncooked meat is sterilized 3 hours in 



CANNING 73 

boiling water, 3 hours in a water seal outfit, 2 hours in steam 
with a pressure of 5 pounds, and 40 minutes in a pressure cooker 
with 15 pounds of pressure. This is the length of time to 
sterilize pint or quart jars but larger ones must be given more 
time. 

The meats which are most successfully canned are : roast beef, 
corned beef, tongue, headcheese, spareribs, sausage, pork roasts, 
tenderloin, pigeons and other wild game and poultry. 

Corned Beef 

After beef has been corned the required length of time, remove 
it from the brine and soak for a few hours in clear water, 
changing the water once. Then place it in a wire basket or tie it 
in cheesecloth and boil 30 minutes. Remove from the boiling 
water, plunge into cold water and remove the gristle, bone and 
excessive fat. Cut into small pieces and place in sterilized jars. 
Put rubbers and caps of jars in position and partially seal. 
Sterilize 3 hours in a homemade or commercial water bath out- 
fit, 3 hours in a water seal, 2 hours with 5 pounds of steam pres- 
sure and 1 hour with from 10 to 15 pounds of steam pressure. 

Chicken 

If one does not wish to can the bones of poultry or wild game, 
the bird, after being dressed, cooled and cut in convenient 
pieces, may be boiled in water until the meat may be removed 
from the bones. One teaspoonful of salt is added to every quart 
jar and the broth in which the meat cooked, or boiling water, is 
added. It is sterilized like all raw or partially cooked meats. 

Fried Chicken 

Season the pieces of chicken and fry until three-fourths 
cooked. Drop the pieces in sterile quart jars, pour the drippings 
from the frying pan around the chicken. Sterilize like all par- 
tially cooked meats. 

Canned Rabbit 

Select tender cottontails, if possible, and after dressing and 
cooling, blanch or dip in boiling water. When the meat becomes 



74 THE FARM COOK AND RULE BOOK 

white, plunge in cold water and cut in convenient sections for 
packing in cans. Add 1 teaspoonful of salt to every quart jar and 
pour boiling water on the meat. Adjust the rubbers and lids 
and sterilize like all uncooked meats. 



Rabbit Sausage 

Use the backs and legs of rabbits for this purpose. To 4 cup- 
fuls of rabbit meat add 11/2 cupfuls of salt pork. Grind in the 
food chopper and add 1/2 teaspoonful of pepper and 1 teaspoonful 
of ground sage. Mix thoroughly, shape in cakes and brown in a 
frying pan. Pack in jars, pour the fat in which the sausage was 
fried into the jars and sterilize like all partially cooked meats. 



CANNING SOUPS 

Beef Stock 

Strip off the fat and meat from 15 pounds of beef joints, 
bones and hocks. Use fat and meat for some other purpose. 
Crack the bones with a hatchet and place them in a thin piece of 
cloth and tie securely. Place in a kettle containing 10 quarts of 
cold water. Simmer, but do not boil, for 5 hours. Do not salt 
while cooking. Skim off the fat, pour in hot sterilized cans and 
sterilize 90 minutes in a homemade or commercial water 
bath outfit, 75 minutes in a water seal outfit and 60 minutes in a 
pressure cooker with 5 pounds of pressure, or 45 minutes with a 
pressure of from 10 to 15 pounds. This stock may be combined 
with vegetables, canned or fresh, or with noodles, dumplings and 
a great many other foods. 

Chicken Stock 

Place 20 pounds of chicken in 7 gallons of cold water and 
simmer over the fire 5 hours. Remove meat from the bones and 
strain. Add sufficient water to make 7 gallons of stock and 
sterilize the same length of time as for beef stock. If one wishes, 
a small amount of boiled rice may be added to every can of 
chicken broth or soup stock. 



CANNING 75 

CANNING FRUIT JUICES 

Add a small amount of water to the washed, picked over and 
crushed grapes, berries or other fruit. Bring to a boil and 
simmer a few minutes or until the juice runs freely. Then strain 
the juice through two layers of cotton flannel into clean jars or 
bottles which have been boiled 15 minutes in water. Place on a 
false bottom, such as a wire rack, in a large kettle and pour 
around them sufficient water to touch the shoulders of the jars 
and the necks of the bottles. 

If the jars are used the lids are half sealed, while either a 
piece of cotton or a cork which has been boiled in water is 
inserted loosely in the bottles. Sterilize this fruit juice 30 min- 
utes, the water around it being kept simmering all the time. 
Boiling the water injures the flavor of the juice. "When the jars 
are removed, tighten the lids and remove the cotton stoppers, 
inserting tightly fitting corks and dipping these tops in paraflin. 
These juices may be used for winter jelly making, in gelatin 
dishes, pudding and other sauces. 



CHAPTEE 12 
PICKLES, CATCHUPS AND EELISHES 

Most meals are improved by the use of pickles which add zest 
and variety. On the farm where there are gardens and orchards, 
various kinds of pickles can be made during the summer and 
fall. 

In making pickles the first precaution to heed is that of using 
only sound, never over-ripe, vegetables and fruits. Unless badly 
soiled, these should be cleansed by being wiped with a damp 
cloth and then with a dry one, for even a little water may prevent 
the pickle from keeping. 

If possible, use pure eider vinegar. Some commercial vine- 
gars, other than that made from cider, frequently contain chemi- 
cals that soften the pickles, making them flabby. Cooking too 
long in vinegar also softens pickles. The purpose of heating is to 
cause the vinegar to ^^strike in^' or if there are mixed vegetables, 
cooking is an excellent way to blend the flavors. 

Precautions to Heed 

Adding a little grated horseradish or nasturtium leaves helps 
to keep the pickles from molding, while the addition of grape 
leaves is supposed to make the pickles green. A little powdered 
alum may be added to make pickles crisp, but this material must 
be used in very small quantities, if at all, since it is an astringent 
and large amounts impart an undesirable flavor. 

In making or storing pickles no metal utensils should be used. 
An enameled kettle gives best results in cooking, and for storing 
glass fruit jars or stoneware, not earthenware^ jars are best. 

As a rule, best results are obtained by sealing the pickles in 
sterilized glass jars although they may be left in the brine. If 
this is done, they must be examined frequently to make certain 
that none of them are soft. Too strong a brine causes them to 

76 



PICKLES, CATCHUPS AXD RELISHES 77 

become soft. When spices are used, they are tied in thin muslin 
or cheesecloth. 

Cucumber Pickles 

4 quarts cucumbers 4 quarts vinegar 

4 red peppers 

Wash and wipe until dry, small unripe cucumtsrs. Put into 
a stone jar and cover with a brine made by adding 1 cupful of 
salt to every quart of water used. Have the brine cool when added 
to the cucumbers. Let stand 24 hours. Heat to near the boiling 
point, drain and wipe the cucumbers dry. Cover them with 
fresh, cold water, the colder the better. Bring to the boiling 
point. Drain and cook the cucumbers, a few at a time, in the 
cider vinegar boiled with the peppers. Can in sterilized jars, 
pouring the hot vinegar over the pickles. Seal. Sweet pickles 
may be made by adding sugar and spices to the vinegar. 

Dill Pickles 

Use cucumbers about 8 inches long. Wash and wipe until 
dry and arrange in layers in a stone jar, placing between every 
layer a small red pepper cut in pieces, a large bunch of dill seed 
on the stalk and a few clean grape leaves. Repeat the process 
until the cucumbers have been used. Then add 4 cupfuls of salt 
to 3 gallons of water, boil and skim, adding suflBcient water to 
make 3 gallons of the brine after the boiling. When cool, pour 
over the cucumbers. Spread more dill, grape leaves and a clean 
cloth over the top. Cover with a plate weighted down with a 
heavy block and let stand 3 weeks before using any of the pickles. 
Wash the cloth over the top of the jar two times every week. 

Dill Pickles 

50 medium-sized cucumbers 6 quarts water 

1 large bunch dill l^^ quarts vinegar 

% cupful mustard seed IVq cupfuls salt 

^ cupful grated horseradish brine 

Wash the cucumbers and place in a brine overnight. Make 
a brine by using i/2 cupful of salt to every gallon of water. 
Drain the cucumbers in the morning and arrange them in layers 
in sterile glass fruit jars. Between every layer place some of 



78 THE FAEM COOK AND RULE BOOK 

the dill, horseradish and mustard seed. Heat the vinegar, water 
and salt together. When boiling hot, pour the liquid over the 
cucumbers and seal. 

Beet Pickles 

Wash the beets carefully, but do not cut off the roots, and 
leave at least 3 inches of the tops on to prevent "bleeding^' dur- 
ing the cooking. Boil the beets until almost tender, plunge in 
cold water, remove skins and cut or slice as desired. 

For sour pickles boil the beets in vinegar until thoroughly 
cooked. Then pour in sterilized cans, add 1 teaspoonful of salt 
to every quart and pour in the boiling vinegar. Seal. 

Sweet beet pickles are made by using a syrup instead of the 
vinegar and salt. To make the syrup boil 4 cupfuls of sugar 
with 2 cupfuls of vinegar and 2 tablespoonfuls of whole cloves 
and 1 tablespoonful of stick cinnamon. Tie the spices in a piece 
of thin muslin. Bring the syrup to the boiling point and boil 
the beets in it 5 minutes. Pour in sterilized jar^ and seal. 

Sweet Sliced Cucumber

pepper and cut in small, thin slices. Slice the onion and sprinkle 
with a little salt, and let stand overnight. In the morning, 
drain, add the other ingredients, using white mustard seed, and 
boil until tender. Can in sterilized jars and seal. 

Mustard Pickles 

Use equal quantities of cucumbers, green tomatoes, caulifiower 
and small onions. Cover with boiling brine made from 1 cupful 
of salt to every quart of water. Let stand 24 hours. Drain and 
cover with fresh boiling water. Let stand 30 minutes. Drain 
and cover with mustard sauce made by cooking 1 cupful of brown 
sugar, 1/2 pound of mustard and 1/4 pound of flour, which have 
been mixed together, with 1 quart of vinegar. Seal the pickles 
while hot in sterile jars.

Cantaloupe Pickles 

Select firm "under-ripe melons, cut in small sections and dis- 
card the seeds. Soak in a brine made by dissolving % cupful 
of salt in a quart of water. After the melon has stood in this 
3 or -i hours, drain and add the well-drained sections to a syrup 
made by boiling 4 cupfuls of sugar, 1 cupful of vinegar, 1 quart 
of water, 1 tablespoonf ul of cloves and 1 tablespoonful of allspice 
together. Boil the melon rapidly in this 10 minutes. Remove 
from the stove and let stand overnight. In the morning drain 
the syrup from the melon and boil it until the back of a spoon 
dipped in it is coated. Then add the cantaloupe and cook 
slowly 1 hour. 



CHAPTEE 13 

FRUIT PRESERVES, JAMS AND BUTTERS 

Preserves are fruits canned in a thick syrup. Usually these 
are cooked by the open kettle method. They are stored in glasses 
covered with a layer of paraffin which keeps the air from enter- 
ing. Properly preserved fruits are saturated with sugar so 
they have a transparent appearance. Uncooked fruits should 
never be dropped into a thick syrup as this causes them to 
shrivel. 

Strawberry Preserves 

Pick over, hull, wash and drain berries. Weigh and make a 
syrup by using % their weight in sugar mixed with water. Use 
1 cupful of water to every 2 cupfuls of sugar. Boil the syrup 
5 minutes. Add the berries and bring to the boiling point. Lift 
out the fruit and place in the sterilized glasses. Boil the syrup 
10 minutes longer and pour over the berries. When cool, pour 
melted paraffin over the top, cover and set away in a cool dark 
place. 

Raspberry Preserves 

Follow the directions for making strawberry preserves, sub- 
stituting raspberries for the strawberries. 

Blackberries 

Substitute blackberries for the strawberries and make like 
strawberry preserves.

5 pounds sugar % cupful nut meats 

3 oranges 

84 



FEUIT PRESEEVES, JAMS AND BUTTERS 85 

Grind the fruit and chopped nuts through the food chopper. 
Cook until as thick as desired and seal in sterile fruit jars or in 
glasses like the strawberry preserves. 

Jams 

Use sound fruit or berries. Wash carefully and stem or pare 
as is necessary. Weigh or measure the fruit. Cut large fruit in 
pieces and crush berries and place in a saucepan with just 
enough water to prevent sticking. Stir to keep from burning 
and cook until the mixture begins to thicken. Then add % as 
much sugar as fruit. Simmer until the desired consistency is 
reached, pour into hot sterilized jars, cool, seal with paraffin, 
cover and store in a cool, dark place. 

Fruit Butters 

Fruit butters are made like jams, only the cooked fruit or 
berries are rubbed through a colander before the sugar is added. 
As a rule, fruit butters are not so thick as jams. After the sugar 
is added, the butter may be set in the oven to finish cooking so 
it will not have to be stirred so much. 

Watermelon Conserve 

6 cupfuls watermelon rind 4% lemons 

5 cupfuls apples 6 cupfuls sugar 

4 oranges 5 cupfuls water 

Chop or cut the rind into small cubes, discarding the green 
portion. Peel the apples, remove the cores and chop. Chop 
oranges, peeling and all, removing the seeds. Use the juice of 
the lemons. Mix all the ingredients and boil slowly from 2 to 3 
hours. Can and seal in sterile jars. 

Splendo Marmalade 

2 pounds quinces 2 pounds peaches 

2 pounds pears 3 lemons 

y2 pound sour apples sugar 

Peel the quinces, pears, apples and peaches, removing the cores 
and pits. Cut or chop in fine bits. Slice the lemons in thin 
wafer-like slices, discarding the seeds. Weigh the combination 



86 THE FARM COOK AND RULE BOOK 

of fruits and add % as much sugar as fruit. Let stand several 
hours in a cool place. Then boil gently until the marmalade is 
very thick^ stirring frequently so the mixture will not stick to 
the pan or burn. If one wishes, 1 pound of finely ground nut 
meats may be added just before the marmalade is taken from the 
stove. Seal while hot in sterilized jars. 

Prune Marmalade 

1 pound prunes 1% cupfuls sugar 

1 cupful vinegar % teaspoonful cinnamon 

1/^ teaspoonful cloves 

Soak the prunes overnight in cold water and cook the next 
morning in the same water in which they soaked. After cooking 
slowly 45 minutes, drain, saving the liquor, and cut the prunes 
in small pieces. Discard the pits. Place the prunes and the 
liquor in a saucepan with the vinegar, sugar and spices and cook 
slowly 45 minutes, or until the marmalade is thick. 



Dried Peach Butter 

1 pound peaches 1 cupful sugar 

2 cupfuls water 

Wash the peaches carefully and soak overnight in cold water. 
Cook slowly in the same water the next morning until the fruit 
is very tender. Rub through a sieve, add the sugar and simmer 
gently until the butter is of the desired consistency. 

Winter Jam 

2 oranges 1 grapefruit 

2 lemons sugar 

Wash the fruit and cut in small pieces, discarding the seeds 
but saving all the juice. Use only the pulp of the grapefruit. 
Measure the fruit and juice and pour three times its quantity of 
water over it. Let stand overnight. Then cook 30 minutes, 
measure again and add an equal amount of sugar. Mix together 
thoroughly and let stand overnight again. In the morning sim- 
mer until the marmalade is thick. Use an enameled saucepan 
for cooking this marmalade, or if desired, a stone crock may be 
used.

adding water until the mixture is the color of rich preserves. 
Add the pineapple, cook 3 minutes and can in sterile jars. 

Cider Fruit Butters 

10 pounds fruit Cinnamon or other spices as de- 

5 pounds sugar sired 

Cider enough to barely cover 

Apples, peaches, pears, plums, grapes and other fruits may 
be used. When using the larger fruits, peel and remove the 
seeds, add sugar, cider and spices. Cook together until of a. thick 
consistency, stirring frequently to prevent burning. It is easier 
to c-ook fruit butters in the oven since fewer stirrings are re- 
quired. When using small fruits as plums and grapes, cook with 
the cider until soft and then rub through a sieve to remove the 
skins and seeds. Add sugar, return to the stove and cook like 
other fruit butters. Seal in sterile jars. 

Pumpkin Butter 

4 cupfuls pumpkin pulp % teaspoonful ground ginger 

2 cupfuls sugar % teaspoonful ground cloves 
% teaspoonful cinnamon % teaspoonful ground nutmeg

sieve. To every 4 cupfuls of the pulp add the spices and the 
juice of the lemons. Cook slowly in the oven until thick. Pour 
into glasses, cool and seal. 



CHAPTER 14 

JELLY MAKING 

The success of jelly making depends largely on three factors 
— the amount of acid in the fruit, the amount of pectin present 
and the quantity of sugar used. If the fruit tastes sweet, it 
needs acid, which may be supplied by the addition of lemon juice 
or some other tart fruit juice. An excellent way to test fruit 
juice for the acid it contains is to compare its taste with that 
of a tart apple. If the apple is more tart^ sour fruit juice is 
needed for the jelly. Another test is made by mixing together 1 
teaspoonful of lemon juice, 3 tablespoonfuls of cold water and % 
teaspoonful of sugar. If the fruit juice is not so tart as this 
mixture, it is best to add lemon juice or some other tart fruit 
juice when cooking the fruit for the jelly. 

Testing for Pectin 

Pectin may be supplied by the addition of apple juice or the 
white portion of lemon and orange peelings. Since this sub- 
stance is found more abundantly in under-ripe fruits than ripe 
ones, very ripe fruits should not be used for jellying purposes. 

To test for pectin, place 1 tablespoonful of wood alcohol in a 
cup and add to it 1 tablespoonful of fruit juice. Let stand at 
least 30 minutes. If pectin is present, a gelatinous mass will 
appear in the liquid. If this can be taken up in a spoon without 
breaking apart and if the mass is quite firm, there is an abun- 
dance of pectin present. When the mass is rather loose and 
breaks apart when shaken or lifted in a spoon or if there is little 
of it, the juice contains less pectin. When the pectin forms in 
small globules but not in a jelly-like mass, the juice needs to be 
cooked more and the test repeated. Pectin may be prepared from 
oranges or apples and kept on hand during the jelly making sea- 
son or it may be purchased at most grocery stores. 

88 



JELLY MAKING 89 

Sugar Proportions Important 

The amount of sugar required varieg with the amount of 
pectin. If the pectin test shows an abundance of pectin is pres- 
ent, 1 cupful of sugar is used to every cupful of fruit juice, but 
if the test shows a loose and less firm pectin, % cupful of sugar 
is used to every cupful of fruit juice. 

Adding too much sugar produces a soft jelly, while not enough 
produces a tough, stringy product. Experiments have shown 
that the sugar should be added gradually after the juice begins 
to boil. It does not need to be heated in the oven first if stirred 
into the juice carefully. 

Watch for Jellying Point 

Care must be exercised in watching for the jellying point, for 
jelly cooked too long is stringy and tough and frequently it is 
dark in color. Uncooked jelly is syrupy and soft and it has a 
tendency to sour. By dipping some of the jelly in a spoon, 
allowing it to cool a few minutes and pouring it gently from the 
edge of the spoon, one can determine when the jellying stage is 
reached. If the juice runs off like syrup, it is not cooked enough, 
but if it breaks in flakes or sheets off, the jellying stage is 
reached. A safe way of determining when the jelly is cooked 
enough is to use a thermometer. When the temperature of the 
boiling mass is 221 to 223 degrees Fahrenheit or 106 degrees 
Centigrade, the jellying point has been reached. 

The hot jelly is skimmed, poured into sterilized glasses which 
have been boiled in water 12 minutes and set in a warm place, 
such as a sunny window, to cool. When firm, it is sealed with 
paraffin, labeled and stored in a cool, dark place. In sealing, 
pour the hot paraffin on top of the jelly and run a small pointed 
knife around the edge of the glass while the paraffin is still hot. 
Sterilize the glass covers in boiling water before putting them 
over the jelly. Wrapping glasses in paper helps to keep out light 
and prevent fading. 

Straining the Juice 

After the fruit is cooked to a pulp, strain the juice through 
dampened flannel without squeezing. This juice makes the 



90 THE FARM COOK AND RULE BOOK 

best jelly. Then return the pulp to the stove, add cold water to 
cover and boil 20 minutes. Strain through the flannel again 
without squeezing. Make jelly as with the first extraction of 
juice, making the pectin test first to determine how much 
sugar to add. Cloudy jelly usually is the result of cooking the 
juice too long with the fruit or not using sufficient care in strain- 
ing it. 

Best results are obtained in making 8 glasses or less at a time. 
The kettle used should have a capacity four times as great as the 
volume of juice to be cooked. Cooking too much juice at one 
time frequently results in a slower cookery, thus a destruction 
of pectin and a loss of color. 

Apple Jelly 

Wipe, quarter and core apples. Cover with cold water and 
heat slowly until the apples are a pulp. Drain through damp- 
ened flannel and do not squeeze. Boil the juice about 10 min- 
utes, add % as much sugar as juice and boil 10 minutes. Skim, 
fill glasses, and when cool, seal with paraffin. After straining the 
juice from the apple pulp, return it to the stove, cover with cold 
water and boil 20 minutes. Strain this juice through flannel 
and make the pectin test to determine how much sugar will be 
needed. Make jelly with it just like the first extraction of 
juice. 

Crab Apple Jelly- 
Make as apple jelly, using crab apples instead of the apples. 

Small Fruit Jelly 

Pick over, wash and drain the fruit or berries, such as grapes, 
raspberries, currants, blackberries and cranberries, and cook with 
enough water to cover until the juice is extracted from the fruit. 
Drain through flannel cloth, but do not squeeze. Measure the 
juice and use % as much sugar as juice. Cook the juice 10 min- 
utes, add the sugar and cook 10 more minutes. Skim, pour in 
sterilized glasses and seal with paraffin when cool.

rest of the cold water and bring to the boiling point, cool and 
let stand 12 hours or overnight. Boil 10 minutes and strain 
through two layers of cheesecloth, squeezing the bag to obtain 
all the juice. Then strain through a flannel bag without squeez- 
ing. Test with alcohol to see how much pectin is present.

the batter 1 minute for every egg. When all five are added, beat 
the mixture 5 minutes. Set in a cold place, on ice if possible, 
for at least 1 hour. Then drop by spoonfuls in paper lined pan. 
Use oiled paper or grease plain wrapping paper. Bake in a hot 
oven 15 minutes. These should puff up and have cavities in the 
center. 

Make a filling for these by grating the 2 squares of chocolate 
and melting it over hot water. When melted add the sugar, 1 
tablespoonful of butter, 1 well beaten egg and the salt. Cook 
in a double boiler until the mixture thickens. Then add the 
fruit preserves and vanilla. Pear, strawberry and peach pre- 
serves make delicious fillings.

CHAPTER 16 
CUSTARDS 

A CUSTARD is a mixture of sweetened and flavored milk and 
eggs which is either baked or cooked over water. In combining 
the ingredients care should be taken not to add too much sugar 
to the egg or little yellow threads will appear through the liquid 
w^hen the milk is added. The eggs should not be beaten too light 
because overheating causes a porous custard. To prevent lumps, 
pour the milk over the eggs and stir constantly. 

Cooking a custard too long causes it to curdle. A curdled 
custard may be made smooth by beating with a Dover egg 
beater. As soon as the steamed custard coats the bowl of the 
spoon and when a knife inserted in a baked custard comes out 
clean, it should be removed from the heat to prevent overcooking. 
By stirring occasionally during the cooling, a steamed custard 
will not be coated. 

Substitutions in Custaxd Making 

Two egg yolks will thicken as much as one egg and they pro- 
duce a smoother custard. 

Two egg whites used instead of 1 egg give a white custard. 

Three-fourths tablespoonful of cornstarch may be substituted 
for one egg. 

One tablespoonful of flour may be used in place of 1 egg. 

Very thick custards are made by decreasing the amount of 
milk, and thin ones by adding more milk.

CHAPTER 17 
FEOZEN DESSERTS 

The first requirement in making good ice cream is the use of 
materials of a high quality. Smooth, rich cream or milk mix- 
tures produce velvety ice creams, while thin, watery ones make 
a coarse-grained product. As the freezing is taking place the ice 
cream expands. Therefore the freezer should never be filled 
more than three-fourths full. If it is, a coarse ice cream will be 
the result. 

One part of salt to 3 parts of crushed ice are used in freezing 
ice creams and equal parts of ice and salt are used in making 
fruit ices. Since some of the flavor is destroyed in freezing, the 
ice cream mixture is always flavored too highly and is made a lit- 
tle too sweet for taste when being poured into the freezer. 

After the cream is frozen, the salt water is drained off, the 
dasher is removed and the ice cream is packed down with a 
spoon. The cover is then adjusted and a cork placed in the 
opening in it. One part of salt to 4 parts of ice is used in re- 
packing the freezer. 

Neapolitan Ice Cream 

2 cupfuls milk 6 egg yolks 

1 cupful cream 1 cupful sugar 

% teaspoonful salt 1 tablespoonful vanilla 

Scald the milk, pour slowly on the egg yolks which have been

CHAPTER 18 
GELATIN DISHES 

Gelatin is always soaked in cold water or other liquid before 
being added to foods. It swells and then must be dissolved in 
a hot liquid or by being heated over hot water. Stirring helps 
to hasten the dissolving. 

Attractive results may be obtained by molding gelatin des- 
serts in various shapes. The molds used for this purpose are 
first dipped in cold water, and without drying them the gelatin 
mixture is poured in and allowed to stand in a cold and level 
place until firm. In unmolding a knife blade is run around the 
edge of the mold, then the mold is dipped quickly in hot water. 
An inverted serving dish is placed on top and both are turned 
over. Then the mold is lifted off carefully. 

Amounts to Use 

Allow 1/2 cupful of liquid for every person to be served. 

Use 2 tablespoonfuls of granulated gelatin to 4 cupfuls of 
water. 

Less liquid is used in the gelatin dish during the warm 
weather when fruit is added to it, that is, 3 cupfuls of liquid to 
2 tablespoonfuls of granulated gelatin. The use of more gelatin 
than this hastens the setting of the dish but produces a tough 
mixture which frequently has a disagreeable taste. 

Lemon Jelly

CHAPTEE 19 

EGGS AND CHEESE 

The whites of eggs and cheese are composed largely of protein, 
a substance which becomes hard and tough when intense heat 
is applied to it. For this reason these foods are cooked at as low 
a temperature as is possible and for as short a time as will make 
them palatable. 

Soft Cooked Eggs 

Pour boiling water over eggs, using % cupful of water to 
every egg. Draw to a cool part of the range and let stand from 
8 to 10 minutes. 

Hard Cooked Eggs 

Prepare as soft cooked eggs only let stand from 30 to 40 
minutes. 

Baked Eggs 

Cut 6 large, thin slices of bacon in one-inch squares and place 
them in a dripping pan. Set the pan in a hot oven. In 5 
minutes turn the bacon squares and cook on the other side. 
Then remove the pan from the oven and break 6 eggs, taking 
care not to break the yolks, on top of the bacon, sprinkle lightly 
with salt and pepper and cook until the eggs are set. Serve 
immediately. 

Eggs with Cheese 

Take 1 cupful of stale cheese, cut in thin slices and arrange 
% cupful of it in the bottom of a greased baking dish. Break 
6 eggs, taking care not to break the yolks, on top of the cheese,

Icing the Cake 

Unless the cake is symmetrical, trim it to obtain the desired 
shape. Then place a filling or icing between the layers and last 
of all ice the top and sides. Let the cake stand in a warm room 
until the icing is dry. In dipping small cup cakes or cookies in. 
icing, they may be placed on a knitting needle while being 
coated. 

Boiled Icing 

1 cupful sugar 1 egg white 

% cupful water % teaspoonful vanilla 

Put the sugar and water in a saucepan and stir until the 
sugar is dissolved. Then bring to the boiling point, washing 
off the sugary sides of the saucepan with a piece of soft cloth 
moistened in cold water and tied over the tines of a silver fork. 
Beat the egg white until stiff and dry and add slowly a table- 
spoonful of the boiling syrup, beating constantly. Then add 4 
more tablespoonfuls of the hot syrup and beat constantly. Allow 
the rest of the syrup to cook until it forms a long thread when 
dropped from a spoon. In making this test remove the pan of 
syrup from the stove, insert the spoon in the syrup, taking care 
not to stir it, and lift up the spoon so the syrup can drop off. 
If it spins a thread 10 inches long, it has cooked sufficiently, but 
if not, it is returned to the fire and tested frequently. The

isters 240 degrees Fahrenheit. When the syrup is ready, it is 
added in a fine stream to the egg white which is beaten con- 
stantly. The flavoring is added. The icing is beaten until 
almost stiff enough to hold its shape. 

When Icing Is Too Soft 

If the cooled boiled frosting is too thin to spread on the cake, 
the dish containing it may be set over hot water. Fold the icing

CHAPTER 21 

FRUITS 

The purpose of cooking fruits is to soften them and to pro- 
vide a change in flavor. Before cooking dried fruits they are 
soaked several hours in water. The liquid in which they are 
soaked is used in the cooking, which should be slow and gentle. 
Spices may be added to cooked fruit for variety if one wishes. 

Baked Apples 

Wash, wipe, pare and core tart apples. Put in a dripping pan 
or baking dish, fill the cavities of the apples with sugar and 
cover the bottom of the pan with water. Bake in a moderate 
oven until the fruit is soft, basting every 10 minutes with the 
syrup in the pan. Serve hot or cold with or without sugar and 
cream. 

Baked Apple Variations 

Add 1 drop of lemon juice to the cavity in every apple. 

Fill the cavity with chopped nuts, raisins and brown sugar 
instead of granulated sugar. 

Fill the center with small red cinnamon candy instead of 
sugar and serve with cream. 

Use chopped marshmallows in the cavities, adding it just be- 
fore the apples are tender and after the sugar has melted. Be- 
fore removing the fruit from the oven, place a marshmallow on 
top of every apple and have the oven slow enough to brown it 
without burning. 

Raisins and sugar may be used in the centers. 

A fruit syrup may be used. To make it, boil 1 cupful of sugar, 
2 cupfuls of water, the juice and rind of V2 lemon and 1 table- 
spoonful of butter together. Add 4 tablespoonfuls of chopped 
raisins to the syrup after it has boiled 5 minutes and let simmer

CHAPTER 22 

MEATS, POULTRY AND FISH 

Meat is either seared on the outer surfaces or plunged into 
boiling water when cooked. Then the heat is reduced during 
the rest of the cookery. In the first part of the process the outer 
surface is coagulated so the inner juices cannot be lost in the 
cooking. Since dry heat hardens the connective tissue, tough 
pieces should be boiled, stewed or cooked some other way in 
moist heat. Salt is added after the meat has been seared or 
plunged in hot water. If added before this, it extracts some of 
the juices which give meat its flavor. 

Roast Beef 

Choose a compact piece of meat and wipe with a small cloth 
moistened in water. Place on the rack in a roasting pan and 
put in a hot oven without covering. When well seared, or in 
about 15 minutes, remove from the oven long enough to sprinkle 
with salt and pepper. Put a cover on the roaster and set the 
meat back in the oven. Finish the cooking at a lowered tem- 
perature, allowing 15 minutes for rare meat, 20 minutes for 
medium and 25 minutes for well done, to each pound. If a 
roasting pan is not available, one may be made by using a drip- 
ping pan and covering it with a smaller pan. A rack may be 
made of a toaster, cake rack or kettle lid. 

Roast Pork 

Roast as roast beef, cooking until well done throughout.

2 teaspoonfuls salt % teaspoonful pepper 



MEATS, POULTEY AXD FISH 137 

Boil the chicken until tender. When cool, remove the bones 
and cut the meat into small bits. Put this back in the broth, 
add the canned tomatoes, chopped onions, pepper and seasonings. 
Simmer slowly 1 hour. 



FISH 

The way in which fish is cooked depends largely on the kind 
of fish it is. Oily ones, such as salmon and mackerel, are best 
broiled or baked, at least not cooked in fat. White fish, such as 
halibut, cod and haddock, are more dry and may be fried or 
sauted. If cooked in water, they are best served with rich sauces, 
and if baked, they must be basted and larded frequently. 

Cleaning Fish 

Fish are best when cleaned immediately after being taken 
from the water. Eemove the scales by drawing a knife over the 
fish, beginning at the tail and working toward the head. Wipe 
off the knife occasionally and brush off the scales from the fish. 
Wash thoroughly. 

To Skin a Fish 

Cut off the fins along the back and then cut off a narrow strip 
of skin down the entire length of the back. Cut the skin around 
the head, loosen it below the head and draw it off from one side 
of the fish by pulling gently with one hand and pushing with 
the back of a knife held in the other hand. Repeat the process 
with the other side of the fish. 

Boiled Fish 

Cook small fish whole but cut the larger ones in thick pieces. 
Use sufficient water to cover and add to this salt and a little 
lemon juice or vinegar. Salt improves the flavor and lemon 
juice or vinegar keeps the flesh white. The fish may be tied in a 
piece of cheesecloth when placed in the warm water, which is 
brought to the boiling point quickly, and then simmered until 
the meat separates from the bones.

142 THE FAKM COOK AND RULE BOOK 

Roasted Quail 

Dress the birds carefully, leaving them whole. Wipe outside 
and inside with a dampened cloth. Truss, leaving the legs 
standing up. Tie a thin slice of bacon around every bird. Bake 
from 15 to 20 minutes in a hot oven. Baste frequently with a 
small amount of boiling water and butter which are placed in the 
pan with the quail. Season with salt and pepper. Moisten 
crisp, brown toast in the liquor and serve the roasted quail on 
this. 

Broiled Quail 

Split the dressed birds down the back, brown in a greased pan 
on both sides, basting frequently with butter. When cooked, 
spread with butter and season with salt and pepper. Place on 
moistened toast and set in the oven long enough to melt the 
butter on the quail.

grinder, seasoning them with salt and pepper and making a 
paste by mixing it with melted butter. Spread this on thin 
brown toast, pour some of the liquid in the roasting pan over it 
and serve the grouse on the toast. 

Prairie chickens have dark meat, therefore they, like duck, are 
best when served very hot and rare. Overcooking spoils the 
flavor.

slice of bacon or salt pork and bake in a hot oven 10 or 15 
minutes. Baste with butter. Boil the hearts and livers, chop 
very fine, season with salt and pepper, onion juice and melted 
butter. Spread this on toast, keep very hot, pour on the juice 
from the pan in which the birds were cooked and place the game 
on top of this toast. Serve immediately. 

Squabs 

Split down the back, dress carefully and break the breast bone 
with a potato masher. Wipe carefully inside and out and broil 
like a spring chicken, or roast in a quick oven 1 hour. Serve on 
fried mush or on toast. Tie a piece of bacon on top of every 
squab and place a teaspoonful of butter inside before broiling. 

Potted Pigeons 

Unless the pigeons are very young, they are best stewed. 
After dressing and trussing the birds, spread a layer of thinly 
sliced bacon in the bottom of the pan, lay the pigeons on this 
with breasts up, dice 1 carrot and 1 onion and add them with 1 
teaspoonful of salt, 1 teaspoonful of chopped parsley and suffi- 
cient water to cover. Cover the pan tightly and simmer until

CHAPTER 25 
PASTRY 

The important rules to heed in pastry making are: use in- 
gredients which are as cold as it is possible to have them, avoid 
handling the pastry any more than is necessary and last, but not 
least, do not add any more water than is needed to hold the 
flaky particles of the fat and flour mixture together. 

In the cold weather or with the use of a refrigerator in the 
summer, the flour, salt and fat may be combined in large quanti- 
ties, placed in covered glass or earthenware jars and kept on 
hand. Then when pies are desired, water may be added to a 
portion of this mixture and the pastry may be rolled out quickly. 
Having this pastry mixture prepared is a great convenience when 
unexpected guests or crews of men come. 

Plain Pastry 

4% cupfuls flour 4 teaspoonfuls salt 

1^ cupfuls shortening cold water to moisten 

Mix the flour, salt and shortening together. The fat may be 
cut in with a knife. Add just enough water to make the parti- 
cles adhere together. Turn on a lightly floured board, roll thin, 
handling as little as possible. This makes 3 two-crust pies of 
ordinary size. 

Sweet Pastry 

4 cupfuls flour 1% cupfuls butter 

1 cupful brown sugar % teaspoonful salt 

Mix the flour and salt and cut in the fat with a knife. Roll 
very thin. Cut with a round cutter, using a doughnut cutter to 
make half the circles. Use jelly, orange or chocolate fllling or 
jam to fill these tarts, placing the circle with the hole in the 
center on a plain one to make a tart.

CHAPTER 26 
SALADS 

The salad is usually the most attractive dish on the table. It 
may be made from fruits, vegetables, meats, fish, eggs or combi- 
nations of these foods. Many kinds of salad dressings may be 
served with it; the two general classes are those which contain 
olive oil or a vegetable oil and those which do not contain oil of 
any kind. 

Salads are made from evenly cut fruits and vegetables. If 
meat is used, it is freed from bone, skin and gristle and is cut in 
small cubes. A garnish of some food, such as whipped cream, 
sprigs of parsley, lettuce, a curl of celerj^ or a strip of pimento, 
makes the salad more attractive. 

As a rule the salad is served on lettuce, which is not only 
attractive but also edible. To prepare the lettuce for use, it is 
examined leaf by leaf to make certain that it is free from insects. 
Then it is washed and placed in a colander to drain. It may be 
dried between folds of a towel but this process frequently 
bruises it. 

When most of the water has drained off, the leaves are piled 
lightly in a cloth or paper bag and set in a cold place, such as a 
refrigerator. If one prefers, the washed lettuce may be placed in 
a glass fruit jar, covered and set in a cold room. When time to 
serve the salad, the lettuce is crisp and ready for use. 

French Salad Dressing

1 teaspoonful salt 5 tablespoonfuls vinegar 

10 tablespooufuls olive oil 

Mix the dry ingredients and add the vinegar and olive oil 
alternately, beating constantly with a silver fork. Lemon juice

CHAPTER 27 
SANDWICHES 

There are two kinds of sandwiches — those which are cold and 
those which are hot when served. A sandwich consists of two 
thin slices of bread or cake, such as angel food or gingerbread, 
spread with butter and a filling. Usually the filling spreads 
more easily if it is put through a food grinder and combined with 
salad dressing, cream or some liquid to make it a paste. 

Bread which has been baked 24 hours cuts better than newly 
baked loaves. Before spreading the butter, it may be placed in a 
mixing bowl and creamed with a spoon just as it is in cake 
making. Creamed butter spreads smoothly and easily. 

When sandwiches must be made ready several hours before 
they are to be served, they will keep fresh and moist if placed in a 
large earthenware or stone crock which is covered with a dish 
towel wrung as dry as possible from warm water. The wet cloth 
should not touch any of the sandwiches. In case the towel 
becomes dry, it should be wrung from hot water the second time. 
For packing sandwiches in lunch boxes, a wrapping of paraffin 
paper keeps them fresh for several hours. 



SANDWICH FILLINGS 

Bean 

Mash cold baked beans and mix with a little tomato catchup or 
salad dressing. 

Peanut and Banana 

Scrape the pulp of a banana and to every banana used add %

CHAPTER 28 
SAUCES 

An old saying which has considerable truth in it is : "A cook 
is knowTL by the sauces she makes." It takes effort to prepare a 
smooth, properly blended sauce, but of all culinary creations it 
can do more toward making the ordinary dish toothsome than 
anything else. 

White sauces to combine with different foods are of great 
value, as are sweet sauces, sometimes colored with fruit juice, 
which are served with puddings, ice cream and other desserts. 
Many a meat and fish dish is lifted above the commonplace by 
the use of a savory sauce.

CHAPTER 29 
SOUPS, CHOWDERS AND DUMPLINGS 

The two most commonly used soups are those made from meat 
stock and those including white sauce (thickened milk) for a 
foundation. Broth is the liquid in which meat is cooked after it 
is strained and seasoned. A chowder is a very thick soup; it is 
in reality an unstrained stew made by combining cut fish, meat 
and vegetables with milk. 

Stock soups and broth are best adapted to use as the first 
course in a meal, while the cream soups and chowders, on account 
of their great food value, should be served as the main dish in an 
otherwise light meal. Cream soups are of great value in the diet 
of the child because they contain so much milk. 

Cream Soups 

Use equal portions of the White Sauce for Cream Soups, the 
recipe for which is given in the chapter on Sauces, and the pulp 
of the vegetable or food to be used in making the soup. Combine 
an.d heat. 

Cream of Tomato Soup 

iy2 cupfuls white sauce speck baking soda 

1^ cupfuls tomato juice and pulp 2 cloves 

1 bay leaf 

Add the cloves and bay leaf to the tomatoes and bring to a 
boil. After boiling a minute or two, add a tiny speck of soda 
and strain. Pour the tomato juice and pulp into the white sauce, 
stirring constantly. Reheat at once. Avoid bringing to a boil.

CHAPTEE 30 
VEGETABLES 

Vegetables should be firm and crisp when made ready for 
cooking. If they are wilted, they may be freshened by soaking in 
cold water a few hours or by being wrapped in a damp cloth 
and set in a cold place. The method of cooking varies with the 
different varieties, so no general rules can be given. 

The water or liquor in which vegetables are cooked should 
always be saved and used. If it is not possible to boil down the 
liquor so that it can be served with the vegetable dish, it may be 
drained off and used in soup or gravy. This liquid contains 
much food value since the soluble food substances in the vege- 
tables dissolve into it during the cookery and are lost if thrown 
away.

CHAPTER 31 
VINEGARS 

The art of vinegar making which our grandmothers knew so 
well is becoming extinct in most American homes. On farms 
where an abundance of fruit is available, the revival of this 
work is a matter of thrift. In some cases customers may be 
secured for this product and a profitable trade developed. 

Fruits used for making vinegar should be sound and ripe. 
Since ripe fruits contain more sugar than underripe ones, they 
produce a stronger vinegar. Care should be taken to have all 
the utensils used clean and to wash the fruit carefully before 
crushing it. 

Cider Vinegar 

Wash ripe apples and remove all the decayed spots. Crush in 
a cider mill or run through a food chopper. Squeeze out the 
juice in a press and strain into a clean jar, keg or barrel. For 
every 5 gallons of juice add 1 cake of yeast which is softened by 
soaking in a cupful of the liquid. Stir the juice after the yeast 
is added. Then cover it with a clean cloth to keep out insects 
and allow to ferment. Fermentation is accomplished in less 
than a week if the temperature of the room in which the juice is 
kept is from 80 to 90 degrees Fahrenheit. A second fermenta- 
tion is necessary to make vinegar. This is called the acetic acid 
fermentation. Before this starts, the juice "\;vdll cease bubbling. 
When this occurs, it is wise to add 1 gallon of a good, strong 
vinegar to every 5 gallons of the fermented juice, but this is not 
necessary. The addition of the vinegar gives more satisfactory 
and uniform results. 

After adding the vinegar, the juice is covered with a clean 
cloth and set in a dark place having a temperature of from 
70 to 90 degrees F. Air should be allowed to enter but the film 
which forms on top should not be disturbed. By tasting of the

194 THE FAEM COOK AXD EULE BOOK 

vinegar every week one can tell when it is sour enough or when 
it ceases getting more sour. Then it should be strained off in 
jugs or bottles and stoppered tightly. If air gets to it, the 
vinegar will become weak and will lose its strength or sour taste 
in time. 

Other Fruit Vinegars 

Grapes, oranges, blackberries and pineapples may be used in 
the place of the apples in the recipe for Cider Vinegar. 

Peach Vinegar 

Crush ripe, sound peaches with a potato masher. To every 
bushel of peaches use 1 cake of yeast, first dissolved in a little 
lukewarm water. Place in a clean barrel or keg, cover with a 
clean cloth and allow to ferment in a room having a temperature 
of from 80 to 90 degrees Fahrenheit. Stir the fruit every day to 
keep it from molding. After 3 days, squeeze out the juice and 
let it ferment until it stops bubbling. Then add 1 gallon of a 
strong, good vinegar for every 4 gallons of peach juice. Cover 
w4th a clean cloth and set in a dark room having a temperature 
of from 70 to 90 degrees F. Taste of the vinegar every week and 
when it is sour enough, strain it into bottles and jugs and 
stopper them tightly. If the vinegar is cloudy, allow it to stand 
in stoppered kegs until the sediment sinks to the bottom. Then 
pour it off carefully without disturbing the sediment. 

Raspberry Vinegar 

Crush 5 pounds of raspberries and add 10 cupfuls of vinegar. 
AUow to stand in an earthenware jar a week, stirring thoroughly 
every day. Then strain through a muslin bag and add 1 cupful 
of sugar to every cupful of juice. Boil this 3 minutes, cool, bot- 
tle and seal. 

Nasturtium Vinegar 

Cut the flowers, leaves and seeds of nasturtium plants in small 
pieces with kitchen scissors and place 3 cupfuls of them in a 
quart fruit jar. Cover with strong cider vinegar and let stand 2 
weeks Then add I/2 ounce of ground cloves and 14 ounce of red 



VINEGAES 195 

pepper. Let stand 5 days, shake every day, then strain through 
muslin. Bottle and seal. 



Gooseberry Vinegar 

Crush ripe berries and add three times as much cold water as 
there are berries. Bring them to the boiling point, cool and let 
stand 24 hours. Then strain through muslin and to every quart 
of the liquid add 21/4 cupfuls of brown sugar. Stir well and put 
into a barrel or jar. Add i/4 pound of honey and bung up or 
cover tightly. 

Cucumber Vinegar 

Wipe cucumbers clean and slice them without peeling into 
clean glass fruit jars. Add sufficient vinegar to cover. For 1 
quart of vinegar add 1 clove of garlic, 1 teaspoonful of white 
pepper and 1 teaspoonful of salt. After standing 2 weeks, drain 
the vinegar into clean bottles, straining it through muslio. 

Horseradish Vinegar 

Grate II/2 ounces of horseradish and add to it I/2 ounce of 
cayenne pepper and V2 ounce of minced shallots. Pour 2 cup- 
fuls of vinegar on this and let stand a week. Strain through a 
fine cloth and bottle for use. 

Molasses Vinegar 

Fill a large jug or keg with a mixture made by combining 1 
quart of Xew Orleans molasses with 2 cupfuls of homemade yeast 
and 3 gallons of rain water. Tie a cloth over the top to keep 
out the dust and insects. Place outdoors in the sun in the sum- 
mer or let stand near the stove in the winter. In a month, or 
sooner, the vinegar will be made. 

Quick Cider Vinegar 

For every gallon of cider add 2 cupfuls of N"ew Orleans mo- 
lasses and 1 cupful of homemade yeast. Place in a jug and 
leave out the cork to admit air. In about a week the vinegar 
will be made. Pour into bottles and cork tightly. 



196 THE FAEM COOK AND RULE BOOK 

White Raisin Vinegar 

Cut 4 pounds of raisins in small pieces and add 2 gallons of 
strained rain water. Place in a jug, leaving out the cork and 
stand it in a warm place. In a month, strain through cheese- 
cloth and bottle for use. 

Com Vinegar 

Boil 4 cupfuls of corn in 1 gallon of rain water until the ker- 
nels break. Then pour this mixture into a stone jar and add 
another gallon of warm rain water, making certain that there 
is approximately 2 gallons of liquid in all. Dissolve 2 cupfuls 
of sugar in 2 cupfuls of boiling water and pour this in the jar. 
Cover the top of the jar with 3 thicknesses of cheesecloth and let 
stand in a warm place, where the temperature will be about 80 
degrees Fahrenheit. In a month pour off the vinegar into a jug, 
being careful not to get any of the sediment in the jug. Cover 
the mouth of the jug and store in a warm, dry place.

QUICK MEALS 

On wash day, when returning home from a trip to town or 
whenever time is limited, it is helpful to have in mind pattern 
meals which can be prepared in 30 or 60 minutes, depending on 
the time available. The following menus for 30-minute and 60- 
minute meals can be made ready in the allotted time, provided 
the fire is built or a kerosene stove is used. Eecipes for making 
the dishes used are found in this book.

CHAPTER 35 
BUTCHERING 

Meat should be cooled at least 24 hours after butchering 
before it is cured. It should not be frozen when placed in the 
brine, for if it is, the brine will not be able to penetrate it evenly. 
As a result, the meat will not have a uniform flavor throughout. 

Any clean and tight hardwood barrel may be used to hold the 
brine, but a thoroughly washed and scalded molasses barrel is 
preferable. In case a vinegar barrel is used, it must be burned 
out on the inside as well as scalded and washed. If the barrel 
has any trace of bad odor after this treatment, a small lump of 
quicklime may be placed in a dish and set in it and a gallon 
of boiling water poured over it. The barrel is then covered 
while the fumes of the slacking lime sweeten it. After this^ the 
barrel is washed and rinsed again. 

Salt, molasses or sugar and saltpeter are the preservatives 
commonly used in curing meat. Salt has an astringent action, 
that is, it draws the moisture from the meat and hardens the 
muscles somewhat. Sugar and molasses have the opposite effect 
and are therefore used with salt. They help keep the muscles 
tender and the meat from becoming too dry. Saltpeter is used 
to retain the natural color of the meat and is always added in 
small quantities. 

Sugar Cured Pork 

Sprinkle a layer of salt on top of a clean table and pile the 
bacons, tongues and hams on this, sprinkling every piece with 
salt. This table should be in a cool and dry room. After the 
meat has stood for 10 days, the pieces are washed off with luke- 
warm water. 

Make a pickle by dissolving 2I/2 pounds of brown sugar, 2 
ounces of saltpeter and from 8 to 10 pounds of salt in 4 gallons 

210 



BUTCHERING 211 

of warm water. This amount of pickle is sufficient for 100 
pounds of meat. Pack the meat in the barrel, after trimming 
off all the rough and hanging pieces, placing the heaviest hams 
and shoulders in the bottom and the bacons and tongues on top. 
Pour the cool brine over the meat, weight it down with a heavy 
block of wood, making certain that it is kept submerged all the 
time. Leave the bacons and tongues in this pickle from 4 to 5 
weeks, the lighter hams about 6 weeks and the heavy hams from 
6 to 8 weeks. Wash the meat in lukewarm water when it is taken 
from the brine to remove the scum and crust which may have 
formed on it. Dry 2 hours, hang in the smokehouse, let stand 
overnight and the next day smoke. 

If at any time during the curing the brine does not cover 
the meat, more water should be added. In case it shows any 
sign of fermentation, it should be drained off, boiled, cooled and 
then poured back over the meat. If the brine becomes ropy, the 
barrel should be washed out with scalding water while new brine 
is being made. 

Dry Cured Pork 

Weigh out 2% pounds of granulated sugar, 6 pounds of salt, 
2 ounces of saltpeter and 4 ounces of black pepper. This is 
sufficient for curing 100 pounds of meat. Divide the sugar, salt 
and saltpeter mixture into equal parts, rub one portion over the 
cooled meat and pack it in a barrel. At the end of three days, 
take the meat from the barrel, rub with a second portion of the 
salt, sugar and saltpeter mixture, and repack. After standing 3 
more days, the meat is removed from the barrel and rubbed with 
the last portion of the mixture and then it is repacked. Let 
stand in the brine formed 2 weeks. Then take from the barrel, 
wash off with lukewarm water, dry 1 hour and smoke. 

Pickled Salt Pork 

Mix together 2 ounces of saltpeter, 8 to 10 pounds of salt and 
4 gallons of boiling water. Cool and pour over the meat which 
has been packed in a clean barrel. This is sufficient pickle for 
100 pounds of meat. Weight the meat down with a heavy block 
and keep every piece submerged all the time. Although fat 



212 THE FARM COOK AND RULE BOOK 

pieces of backs are usually cured in this way, any piece of meat 
may be, provided it is cut in narrow strips or 6 inch squares. 
The meat is left in the brine and is taken out as needed. 

Virginia Ciired Hams 

Place the hams on a table covered with salt and sprinkle them 
with saltpeter until quite frosty. Use about 5 ounces of salt- 
peter for 100 pounds of meat. Salt and pile for 3 days, then 
salt again and leave in salt a day for every pound of meat. 
Wash with warm water, partially dry and rub the entire surface 
with finely ground black pepper. Smoke for 30 or 40 days, 
watching the color so as to get a uniform tobacco brown color. 
Hickory wood is best for smoking. Re-pepper the hams after 
they are smoked. 

Pickled Pigs' Feet 

Soak the feet from which the toes have been removed over- 
night in cold water. Cover with fresh water in the morning and 
boil slowly until the meat is very tender. Salt is added for sea- 
soning during the cooking. Remove the pigs' feet from the ket- 
tle, split them and pack in a stone jar. Pour on sufficient hot 
vinegar to cover. Spices may be added if one wishes. To 1 
quart of vinegar, 1 tablespoonful of whole cloves, the same 
amount of peppercorns and 1 teaspoonful of salt are good 
amounts to use. 

Pork Sausage 

For every 3 pounds of fresh lean pork allow 1 pound of fat. 
Grind the meat and fat in a food grinder. Weigh the meat 
and spread it out in a thin layer on a flat surface and sprinkle 
with the seasonings. For every 5 pounds of ground meat, use 
1% to 2 ounces of salt, I/2 ounce of black pepper and % ounce 
of ground sage. Mix the seasonings and meat together and put 
through the grinder again. 

Sausage Casings 

Carefully cleaned intestines of sheep, hogs and cattle are used 
for casings. As a rule pork casings are used for pork sausage, 



BUTCHERING 213 

beef rounds from the small intestines are used for bologna and 
beef bungs from the large intestine are used for large bologna 
and for ham sausage. These casings may be purchased if one 
does not wish to prepare them. They are cleaned by being 
emptied and washed thoroughly inside and out. Then they are 
soaked in a solution of lye or in water to which wood ashes have 
been added. They are scraped inside and out until the slime and 
gat are removed. Then they are washed again and packed in 
salt until needed. 

Narrow muslin bags 20 inches long and 3 inches wide may be 
used in place of the casings. Melted lard is rubbed over the 
outer surface of the bags to seal the surface. 

Bologna Sausage 

To 8 pounds of lean beef use 1 pound of fat pork. Put the 
meat through a food grinder, spread it out on a flat surface and 
sprinkle with the seasonings. For every 9 pounds of meat allow 
2l^ ounces of fine salt, % ounce of black pepper and 14 ounce 
of ground mace or coriander. Mix the seasonings with the meat 
and regrind. Stuff into casings, dry 1 hour and smoke 8 or 10 
hours. Dry before putting away. 

Liver Sausage 

Add 5 pounds of well cooked pork or beef liver and 1 pound 
of flour to 8 pounds of well cooked pork from boned hogs' heads 
or jowls. Cut the meat into small pieces, mix thoroughly with 
flour and put through a food grinder. Spread out and sprinkle 
with 6 ounces of fine salt, 2 ounces of finely ground black pepper 
and 1 ounce of finely ground sage. Eegrind, adding 1 onion if 
the onion flavor is desired. Stuff the meat into round casings 
or hog bungs and cook in boiling water 10 minutes. Cool in ice, 
or very cool, water and hang up to dry. 

Headcheese 

Skin the hogs' heads, remove the brains and eyes and split 
the heads down the center of the foreheads and noses. Put the 
pieces in a kettle, cover with water and boil gently until the 



214 THE FAEM COOK AXD EULE BOOK 

meat comes off the bone easily. Then remove the meat, chop it 
finely, return it to the kettle and add a part of the liquor in 
which it was cooked, and boil 15 minutes. While this is cook- 
ing, season to taste with salt and pepper. To 12 pounds of meat 
add 14 pound of salt, % pound of pepper and if desired, a trace 
of allspice and cloves. Put the cooked meat and the liquid that 
remains in stoneware jars or crocks, place a weight on top and 
cool. When firm, it is ready to be sliced and used. 

Lard 

Eender the leaf fat, the fat from the sides, trimmings from 
hams, shoulders and neck and that from the guts separately. 
The same process is used in rendering the three kinds of fat and 
if one wishes, the leaf fat and that from the sides, hams, shoul- 
ders and neck may be rendered together. 

Either run the fat through a food chopper or cut it into 1^2 
inch cubes. Cook over a very slow fire, never letting the mixture 
reach the boiling point of water. Stir frequently with a wooden 
stick. When the cracklings are light brown in color and float on 
top, remove them and drain. Save the cracklings to make crack- 
ling bread, to feed the chickens or for soap making. Stir the 
lard as it cools. When cool enough, strain through muslin 
cloths into jars or cans and cover. 

Corned Beef 

Cut wholesome, fresh beef in pieces about 6 inches square and 
place a i/4 inch layer of salt, then a 6 inch layer of meat in an 
earthenware jar or a wooden barrel. Eepeat this process until 
all the meat is used. Be sure to have a good layer of salt on 
top. Weigh the meat before cutting it and allow 8 pounds of 
salt to 100 pounds of meat. Let the beef stand overnight in the 
salt. 

The next morning make a brine by dissolving 3 ounces of salt- 
peter, 21/2 ounces of baking soda and 5 pounds of sugar in 4 
gallons of boiling water. Pour through muslin and cool. When 
thoroughly cooled, pour the brine over the meat and salt and if 
the meat is not covered, add sufficient cold water that the meat 



BUTCHERING 215 

will be submerged. Weight it down with a heavy block of wood. 
After 5 days, overhaul the meat and repack, putting the pieces 
previously on top in the bottom. 

At any time, especially in the warm weather, that the brine 
shows signs of fermentation or becomes ropy, it should be drained 
off, boiled, strained through a clean cloth, cooled and poured 
back on the meat. Scald the barrel or jar and wash the meat 
before the brine is poured back. Keep the meat in a cool, dark 
place. It will be ready for use after standing in the brine one 
month. If kept 2 months, soaking the meat before cooking it 
will be necessary to remove some of the salt. The parts of the 
beef usually selected for this purpose are plate, rump, cross ribs 
and brisket. Best results are obtained by removing the bone be- 
fore putting the meat in the brine. 

Dried Beef 

Use the round for this purpose. To 50 pounds of cooled 
meat, weigh out 3 pounds of salt, II/2 pounds of brown sugar 
and 1 ounce of saltpeter. Mix these ingredients and divide into 
three portions. Rub one portion on the meat and place it in an 
earthenware jar. Let stand 3 days, then take the meat from 
the jar J but leave the syrup formed during the curing in it, rub 
the second portion of the mixture on the meat, return it to the 
jar and let stand 3 more days. Then take out the meat and 
rub the third portion on it and put back in the jar with the 
syrup. After standing 3 days, hang it up in the smokehouse. 
Smoke until dry and then keep in a dry place. 



Vienna Sausage 

Grind very fine 4 pounds of lean beef and 2 pounds of fat 
pork. Sprinkle with 1% ounces of salt, I/2 ounce of black pepper 
and ^ ounce of sage. Regrind until very fine. Stuff in cleaned 
casings of any desired size. Smoke until they take on a rich 
orange color, then cook in hot, but not boiling, water from 10 
to 15 minutes, depending on the size of the sausages. The use 
of too hot water or too much fire in the smokehouse will cause 
the sausages to split and be wasted. 



216 THE FAEM COOK AND RULE BOOK 

Smoking Meat 

After meat has been in the brine or pickle long enough, it 
is removed, soaked in lukewarm water 20 minutes and then 
washed in fresh lukewarm water. The pieces are then strung 
with heavy twine and hung in the smokehouse so that no two 
pieces touch. Allow to dry 24 hours. Then smoke, beginning 
with a very low fire. The fire should make as little heat and as 
much smoke as possible. Too hot a fire dries the outside of the 
meat and prevents the smoke from penetrating it. 

Any hard wood may be used for smoking meat, although 
hickory smothered in sawdust is a favorite. Maple is also satis- 
factory and when wood cannot be obtained, corncobs are an 
excellent substitute. 

Length of Time to Smoke 

Meat is smoked until it is of an even light or medium brown 
color. The shortest time meat is smoked is 2 days, but the 
flavor is usually much better if smoked slowly a much longer 
time. If meat is frozen, it should be thawed out before being 
smoked. In warm weather the fire should be allowed to die out 
every other day until the meat is smoked. This keeps the tem- 
perature from becoming too high. 

When the meat is of the right color, the door and ventilators 
of the smokehouse are opened. The meat is left hanging until 
it is cool. It is then wrapped in heavy newspapers and sewed 
up in stout muslin bags. 

Wash for Keeping Meat 

The United States Department of Agriculture gives the fol- 
lowing recipe for a wash to be applied to the muslin bags hold- 
ing the smoked and cured meat. For 110 pounds of meat use 
3 pounds of baryates, 0.06 pound of glue, 0.08 pound chrome 
yellow, which is a poison, and 0.40 pound flour. Half fill a pail 
with water and mix in the flour, dissolving all the lumps. Dis- 
solve the chrome in a quart of water and add it and the glue to 
the flour mixture. Bring to the boiling point and add the 
baryates slowly, stirring constantly. Make this wash the day 



BUTCHERING 217 

before it is needed. Stir frequently while applying it with a 
brush to the outer surface of the muslin bags around the meat. 

Grandma's Mince Meat 

8 pounds meat 4 tablespoonfuls allspice 

6 pounds currants 4 pounds suet 

6 pounds raisins 2 pounds citron 

12 pounds sugar 20 pounds raw apples 

12 tablespoonfuls cinnamon '2 gallons cider 

8 tablespoonfuls mace 4 tablespoonfuls salt 
4 tablespoonfuls grated nutmeg 

Use either boiled beef or pork for this purpose and put 
through the food grinder with the currants, seedless raisins, 
citron and apples. Add the spices and sugar. Bring the cider 
to the boiling point and add the other ingredients. Boil 1 hour, 
stirring frequently. Can while hot in air tight and sterilized 
glass fruit jars. These jars may be sterilized by boiling in water 
15 minutes.

CHAPTER 1 
HOUSEHOLD EECIPES 

Toilet Soap 

Place 10 pounds of double refined 98 per cent caustic soda 
powder in an earthenware jar or in a can with 4% gallons of 
water. Stir a few times with a stick. The powder will dissolve 
immediately and become hot. Let it stand until the lye thus 
made is cool. 

Weigh out and place in any utensil convenient for mixing 75 
pounds of linseed oil, cottonseed oil or any vegetable oil, clean 
grease or tallow. If grease is used it must be melted slowly 
until it is liquid and just barely warm, not hot. When oil is 
used, it is not heated at all. 

Pour the lye into the oil slowly, stirring with a wooden stick, 
and continue to stir gently until the oil and lye are combined 
thoroughly and have the appearance of honey. Do not stir the 
mixture longer or it will separate. The time of stirring varies 
with the temperature and the atmospheric conditions but ordi- 
narily from 15 to 20 minutes is long enough. 

Dampen the sides of pans or boxes with cold water and pour 
the soap into them. Allow this to stand in a warm room for 24 
hours. Then cut in squares. 

The addition of a few drops of oil or mirbane, artificial al- 
mond oil, just after the oil and lye are mixed provides perfume. 
Other pleasing odors are supplied by a few drops of real almond 
oil, citronella or oil of cloves. The precautions to heed in mak- 
ing this soap are : allow the lye to cool before using it, use exact 
weights of double refined 98 per cent caustic soda and grease or 
oil and stir the lye into the grease, not the grease into the lye. 

Destroying Weavils in Beans 
Place the beans in a box with a tightly fitting lid or in an old 
trunk if one is available. Pour carbon bisulphide in a saucer and 

221 



222 THE FARM COOK AND RULE BOOK 

set this on top of the beans. Close the lid of the box or trunk 
and do not open for 24 hours. Since carbon bisulphide is explo- 
sive, care must be taken not to use it near a fire. 

Re-silvering Mirrors 

Spread a sheet of tin-foil corresponding to the size of the plate 
of glass evenly on a smooth and solid table, and carefully rub 
down every wrinkle on its surface with a brush. Pour a por- 
tion of mercury and rub it over the tin-foil with a piece of very 
soft woolen cloth. Apply rulers to the edges; then pour mer- 
cury on to the depth of a dime. Carefully remove any oxide 
on the surface, remove the old coating from the glass and be sure 
it is clean and dry. Then slide the glass over the surface of the 
liquid metal so no air, dirt or oxide can possibly remain or get 
between them. 

When the glass has reached the proper position, apply gentle 
pressure and slope the table a little to carry off the waste mer- 
cury. Cover the glass with a flannel cloth and load it with heavy 
weights. After 24 hours slant the glass a little. Keep slanting 
it a little more every day until at the end of a month it becomes 
perpendicular. It is then ready to be used. 

Fly Killer 

An inexpensive and effective fly killer which can be used on 
the farm without danger to the children and livestock is made 
by mixing I/2 cupful of milk, 1 teaspoonful of formaldehyde and 
1% cupfuls of water together. This is poured into shallow pans 
and is especially effective if set in places where water is scarce. 

Cleaning Silverware 

Place the tarnished silver in an old aluminum pan or kettle 
which contains boiling water. Add 1 teaspoonful of baking soda 
and an equal amount of salt to every quart of water used. The 
silver should be covered by this solution. As the water boils the 
tarnish is dissolved. 

Paste for Wall Paper 

Mix 1 quart of flour with sufficient cold water to make a stiff 
paste or batter and then add 1% gallons of boiling water. Stir 



HOUSEHOLD RECIPES 223 

the mixture until the flour is cooked. When this has stood a 
few hours, but not overnight, it is ready for use. If the paper 
is being hung on walls which have been painted, the paste is 
thinned with ^ cupful of molasses. When very heavy paper 
is being hung, the addition of 2 teaspoonfuls of Venetian tur- 
pentine will help make it stick. 

Re-sizing Rugs 

To re-size rugs which have become flimsy, dissolve 1 quart of 
powdered dry glue in 1 gallon of boiling water. Keep this on 
the stove until the glue is dissolved. Tack the rug wrong-side 
down on the floor, spreading old newspapers around the edges to 
protect the floor. Use a brush to apply the glue solution, taking 
care to cover every inch of space. Cover the edges of the rug 
with the solution. Do not move the rug for 24 hours or until 
the sizing is dry. 

Laying Linoleum 

Spread a layer of heavy paper, frequently called builder's 
felt, or some other heavy paper on the floor. Using a brush, 
paste this to the floor with linoleum paste. This lining should 
fit closely to the baseboard, and if there is a molding, it should 
be removed. 

Next the strips of linoleum are laid on the floor; they are 
matched at the seams and cut to fit the room. Then by rolling 
one strip back half-way paste is applied to the underside to 
within three inches of the edges. Linoleum cement is then 
spread on the edges. The purpose of the linoleum paste and 
cement is to fasten the fioor covering firmly to the floor so 
water cannot get underneath to rot the fiber. The paper lining 
keeps the expansion and contraction of the wood, due to atmos- 
pheric conditions, from causing the linoleum to bulge or crack. 

Weights are needed until the cement and paste are dry. A 
good way to secure the necessary weight is to fill a wooden box 
with bricks, fasten a rope to it for a handle and then pull this 
back and forth over the surface, particularly up and down the 
seams. A board weighted down can be laid over the seams for 
24 hours to hold the cement firm. Then the molding is replaced. 



224 THE FARM COOK AND RULE BOOK 

In cold weather the rolls of linoleum should be left in a warm 
room at least 48 hours before being laid. 

Putting Down Butter 

Before the grass is gone in the fall and while cream is plenti- 
ful, butter may be put down for winter use. Work the butter 
as for immediate use, making certain that all the buttermilk is 
removed. Pack the butter in earthenware jars to within 5 inches 
of the top. Make a brine from coarse salt and water strong 
enough that an egg will float in it. Strain through fine cloth 
and pour over the butter, filling the Jar. Cover the jar tightly 
and set in a cave or cellar. This butter will keep through the 
winter. 

Keeping Cake Fresh 

If several layers of cake are baked at one time and placed 
in a tightly covered earthenware jar, they will stay fresh many 
days. Just before using two or three of the layers, cover them 
with a cooked icing, the warmth of which steams and freshens 
the cake. By using different kinds of icings, the taste of the 
different cakes made from the same batter will be varied. Or 
the batter may be divided before being baked and the different 
layers flavored with a variety of extracts. Having this cake on 
hand when guests or crews of men come is very helpful. 

Keeping Cider Sweet 

The fermentation of cider may be retarded greatly by the ad- 
dition of sodium benzoate, but it is doubtful if the addition of 
this substance or any chemical preservative at all permissible 
for this purpose will prevent fermentation under all conditions. 
Apple juice treated with 0.1 to 0.2 per cent sodium benzoate 
will, however, probably not undergo any fermentation within a 
considerable period of time if it is kept cool during storage. 
Benzoate of soda in amount not to exceed one-tenth of one per 
cent is permitted by the Pure Food and Drug's Act in juices to 
be sold, but its presence in the material must be indicated on the 
label. 



HOUSEHOLD EECIPES 225 

Making Hominy 

Dissolve 4 tablespoonfuls of lye in 1 gallon of boiling water. 
Boil the corn rapidly in this solution 30 minutes. Then drain 
and wash the kernels thoroughly several times in cold water to 
remove the lye. Eub with the hands until the husks, or cover- 
ing of the kernels, are removed. Then place the corn in an 
enamel kettle and boil in a little water until tender. Wash 
again, pack in glass jars and sterilize by the cold pack method 
of canning, following the directions given in the chapter on 
canning. 

Salt Rising Bread 

2 cupfuls milk 2 teaspoonfuls salt 

^ cupful cornmeal 2 cupfuls watar 

4 teaspoonfuls sugar flour 

Scald the milk and mix it with the cornmeal, sugar and salt. 
Let stand several hours, or overnight, in a very warm place. 
After standing it should be light. Add warm water and enough 
flour to make a drop batter. Keep at a very warm temperature, 
167 degrees Fahrenheit, until light. Then add sufiicient flour 
to make a stiff dough and shape into 2 loaves. Allow to rise and 
double its bulk, and bake. Care should be taken to keep the 
temperature higher than for ordinary bread. The milk should 
always be scalded before mixing the batter, as more uniform re- 
sults may be obtained, and a product secured which does not 
have the unpleasant odor frequently associated with salt rising 
bread. 

Making Sauerkraut 

Eemove the outside leaves and hard core of cabbage. Cut 
into fine shreds and pack in layers, 3 to 6 inches deep, in a 
crock or keg. Sprinkle every layer with salt, repeating the 
process until the cabbage is within a few inches of the top. For 
every 100 pounds of shredded cabbage use 10 to 12 cupfuls of 
salt. Press the cabbage down until the brine covers it, place a 
few leaves over the top, arrange a clean board or plate over the 
leaves and weight it down with a heavy block. Lime stones 
should not be used for weights since they are attacked by the 



226 THE FAEM COOK AND EULE BOOK 

acid of the brine. Eemove the scum which forms on top when 
it is noticed and see that the kraut is kept covered with brine. 
Keep a clean cloth over the top of the crock to make certain that 
dust, dirt and insects cannot get in. When the kraut is cured, 
which will be from 2 to 3 weeks in warm weather and from 6 
to 8 weeks in winter, it may be canned. 

Preserving Eggs 

Eggs are most abundant and lowest in price during the spring 
and early summer months. Therefore it is best to put them up 
at this season for winter use. Use only good, fresh eggs for 
this purpose. Six quarts of solution in a 3-gallon jar will pre- 
serve 10 dozen eggs. Use 1 part, about a pint, of waterglass to 
9 parts of boiled water which has been allowed to cool. Stir the 
mixture thoroughly and pour it into a crock and put in the eggs. 
Store in a cool place, such as a cellar, and be certain that the 
tops of the eggs are covered with 2 or 3 inches of the liquid. 
Add fresh water to replace the liquid which evaporates. Buy 
fresh waterglass from the druggist every year instead of keeping 
a supply on hand. The solution is not good for a second year's 
use. Infertile eggs are better for preserving than fertile ones. 

Keeping Cellar Free from Dampness 

A large open box or pan filled with fresh lime helps to dry 
and purify the air in a cellar. When the lime becomes air- 
slacked, it should be discarded and fresh lime added. 

Tanning Hides 

Wash the skin with strong soap suds to remove dirt from the 
wool, soak overnight in soapy water and tack down over a barrel 
to dry. Have the flesh side down. When nearly dry, remove 
the hide and clean off any pieces of flesh or fat that remain. 
Eub prepared chalk over the skin until no more can be rubbed 
in and then rub with powdered alum and sprinkle this all over 
the skin. This is the method used for treating sheepskins and 
goatskins. 

In preparing coon and squirrel hides for caps, sheepskins and 
goatskins for rugs and lambskins for coats and vests the hides 



HOUSEHOLD RECIPES 227 

may be nibbed with alum and saltpeter. Then they are folded 
with the flesh sides together^ rolled tightly and stored in a dry 
place a week. The flesh side is then nibbed down with a damp 
cloth dipped in rotten stone until it becomes smooth and acquires 
a polish. 

Bleaching and Re-sizing Straw Hats 

Mix the juice of 1 lemon with 1 tablespoonful of sulphur and 
apply this thick paste with a brush to the hat. It is best to re- 
move the hat band before the mixture is applied. Rub the paste 
into the straw, then rinse by moistening the brush in clear 
water, taking care not to use any more water than is necessary 
to remove all the paste. If the straw hat is flimsy, re-size by 
beating up the white of an egg and applying this to the straw 
with a fine brush. 

Waterproofing Leather 

An old-fashioned recipe for waterproofing leather is to melt 
by gentle heat 4 ounces of raw linseed oil, 5 ounces of boiled lin- 
seed oil, 4 ounces of suet and 4 ounces of beeswax. This is ap- 
plied to the leather while warm. A simple method is that of 
rubbing the leather with equal amounts of mutton tallow and 
beeswax. 

Removing Furniture Blemishes 

To remove white spots from varnished surfaces which have 
been caused by water, fill a small basin with tepid water and 
add several drops of household ammonia to it. Dip a soft cloth 
in this, wring quite dry and apply to the unsightly places. It 
may take three or four applications to remove every trace of 
whiteness. When they disappear, rub the surface gently with 
furniture polish. 

White stains on dining room tables made by hot dishes may 
be removed by being covered with baking soda. A hot iron is 
held near, taking care that the wood is not scorched. Repeating 
this process two or three times and rubbing the surface with 
furniture polish will usually restore the desired appearance. 

When scratches appear on furniture or woodwork, go over the 
surface with a cloth moistened in furniture polish to see if the 



228 THE FAEM COOK AND EXILE BOOK 

dye in it will make the scratch invisible. Another method 
which may be used is to apply a small amount of water color for 
wood to the scratch, using a shade which matches the finish of 
the wood. 

Highly polished surfaces which are marred by hairlines or 
tiny cracks may be improved by being rubbed from day to day 
with a cloth moistened in oil, 1 part lemon oil to 2 parts of 
boiled linseed oil. 

Bruises or dents may be removed with water and heat. Take 
four thicknesses of blotting paper and dip in water. When the 
superfluous water has dripped away, place the paper over the 
bruise and hold a hot flat or electric iron near it. The heat 
and moisture cause the wood to expand. More than one treat- 
ment of this kind may be required to remove a large dent. After 
removing the blotting paper, lay a cloth moistened in linseed oil 
on the surface. Several hours later, remove it and polish with 
a solution made by combining equal parts of turpentine and lin- 
seed oil. 

Removing Floor Blemishes 

Black, ink-like stains on oak floors are caused by the iron in 
water reacting with the gallic acid in the wood. They are very 
obstinate but may be dimmed and frequently are removed by 
dipping a cloth in weak oxalic acid and rubbing the spot with 
this. After it is dimmed or disappears, the surface is rinsed 
two or three times with clear water and wax or oil is applied to 
restore the finish. Care should be taken not to let the acid 
touch the hands. 

Making Lye 

Fill a wooden keg or half-barrel with wood ashes. Holes 
should be bored in the keg or barrel a few inches above the bot- 
tom. Pour water on the ashes and place a wooden trough or 
pails to catch the lye water which seeps out from the ash barrel 
or keg. 

Making Cider 

Only wholesome apples should be used. Bruised fruit need 
not be discarded but the decayed portions should be cut out or 



HOUSEHOLD RECIPES 229 

they will give the cider a disagreeable flavor. Wash the apples, 
grind them in a cider mill and place them in a press which re- 
moves the juice. Drain this in clean vessels, wooden barrels or 
kegs which have previously been scalded. Store in the coolest 
place possible. 

Since sweet cider sours so rapidly, it usually is pasteurized 
the next day after it is made. To do this sterilize glass fruit 
jars or bottles by boiling them in water several minutes. Pour 
the cider in these sterile containers and set these on a wooden 
rack in the bottom of a wash boiler. Fill the boiler with cold 
water which reaches to the necks of the bottles and hang a ther- 
mometer half its length in the water. Heat the water until it 
reaches 175 degrees Fahrenheit, but do not let the water become 
warmer. Leave the vessels containing the cider in this water 
bath 30 minutes if quart or half gallon bottles or glass jars are 
used and 45 minutes if gallon containers are used. Then re- 
move the cans or bottles and tighten the covers on the cans and 
place corks in the bottles. Place in the cellar^ cave or some cool 
dark place for storage. Watch them for a week or two ; if there 
is a froth at the top of the cider, it is fermenting. The lids of 
the jars will have to be loosened and the corks of the bottles re- 
moved and the containers placed in the water bath and given the 
same treatment as before. Before placing the cider in the wash 
boiler, place cotton in the mouths of the bottles and place rub- 
bers and lids which have been sterilized in boiling water on the 
cans. Do not screw the lids on tightly, but just give it a half 
turn so it will hold during the sterilization. The lids may be 
sterilized by being boiled with the cans and the rubbers are 
dipped in boiling water. 

The cooked or boiled taste that usually is not liked when 
canned cider is served is avoided in this method, provided a 
thermometer is used and the water is not heated above 175 
degrees F. It must be heated this much, however, or it will 
not keep. 

Sizing Walls 

Dissolve 1 pound of glue in a little hot water and then add 1 
gallon of cold water. Apply this to the wall with a brush before 
adding new paper. 



230 THE FARM COOK AND RULE BOOK 

Cleaning Shoes 

If a coarse scrubbing brush is kept near the door, the shoes 
may be cleaned with this much easier than if a knife is used. 
The knife may cut or scrape the leather. Rubbing leather 
shoes with milk once a week helps to keep them in a good con- 
dition. 

Preventing Leather Seats from becoming Sticky- 
Leather chair seats and upholstered furniture frequently be- 
come sticky. This usually is caused by the leather drying out. 
To prevent it, rub the leather every month or two with a soft 
cloth moistened in neat's-foot oil. When the stickiness occurs, 
remove as much of it as possible with gasoline and apply neat's- 
foot oil. Do not wipe the oil off for a day or two. 

Removing Mildew from Leather 

Apply vaseline with a soft cloth to remove mildew from 
leather. 

Removing Grease from Leather 

Beat the white of an egg slightly and apply to the grease spot. 
Set in the sun to dry, then brush off. 

Making Egg Candler 

Before setting eggs under hens or putting them down for the 
winter, they may be candled to make certain they are fresh. A 
simple candler consists of a pasteboard shoe box with a hole a 
little larger than a half dollar cut in one side. Slip the box 
over the lamp or electric light bulb in a dark room and hold the 
eggs, large end up, before the opening in the box. Good eggs will 
look clear and firm and the white spot, or air cell, at the end 
of the egg is small, not larger than a dime. The yolk can be 
seen as a dim spot in the center. A large air cell and a dark, 
freely moving yolk indicates that the egg is not fresh. 

Cottage Cheese 

Set a quantity of fresh sour milk in a moderately warm room 
and allow to sour naturally. Unless the milk has been con- 



HOUSEHOLD EECIPES 231 

taminated at the barn or by a soiled utensil, the curd will be 
smooth, even and free from gas bubbles. The best temperature 
to set milk for cottage cheese is 70 to 72 degrees. As soon as the 
milk is curdled throughout, stir and break it up; then heat it 
gradually to 10-i degrees Fahrenheit. If you do not have a dairy 
thermometer, set the milk on the back of the stove so it will not 
be heated too much. When the whey separates from the curd, 
pour the curd into a muslin bag and hang up to drain. It takes 
from 2 to 10 hours to drain the curd, depending on the size and 
firmness of the curd particles. When drained, it is moist and 
granular but not sticky. 

The drained curd is then salted to taste. About 1 ounce of 
salt is sufficient for 8 pounds of cheese. Two cupfuls of cream 
added to this amount of cheese will improve its flavor. Some 
homemakers also add 2 tablespoonfuls of sugar. 

Furniture Polish 

To 1 cupful of turpentine add a piece of beeswax about the 
size of a walnut. Stir into this IV2 pints of paraffine oil. Mix 
and shake well and apply to the furniture with a soft cloth, 
being careful not to use too much. Ugly stains may be removed 
by using rotten stone for scouring along with this polish. 

Cleaning the Mattress 

To remove stains from a mattress rub the soiled places with 
dry starch, moistening it with a little soap jelly or soap dis- 
solved in warm water. This will make a paste. Care should be 
taken that it is not wet enough to soak into the mattress. When 
dry, brush off the starch. Occasionally more than one applica- 
tion is necessary. When the stains have disappeared, sponge the 
surface with a little ammonia water. 

Making- Bags 

Housework is made easier by the use of convenient bags. 
After lettuce is washed, it may be stored in a cheesecloth bag 
in a cool place, such as a refrigerator. Tomatoes are prepared 
easily if placed in a tomato bag of cheesecloth and scalded. 
They can be hung up to drain. By the time they are cool, the 



232 THE FAEM COOK AND RULE BOOK 

skins can be rubbed off and the vegetables returned to the bags 
to await the serving time. A three cornered jelly bag made of 
two thicknesses of cheesecloth or of cotton flannel is helpful. 
If a canton flannel bag is tied over the broom, the walls and 
ceilings may be brushed down without being scratched. Bags 
of cheesecloth, net or mosquito netting which are filled with 
dried sweet clover, rose petals or leaves, rose geranium, lemon 
verbena, lavender or other summer sweets impart a fragrance to 
sheets, pillow slips and other household linens if placed among 
them. Large cheesecloth bags for use in blanching or scalding 
vegetables before canning them by the cold pack method sim- 
plify the work. 

Wall pockets which consist of a rectangle of heavy material 
such as cretonne, Indian head and denim on which pockets of 
various sizes are stitched, make a home for the odds and ends 
in a household. Shoe and laundry pockets may be tacked to the 
clothes press doors. The kitchen wall pocket should hold a ball 
of twine, wrapping paper, soiled tea towels, corks, rubber bands 
and other useful articles, a pocket in the bathroom holds the 
dried and soiled towels and a mending pocket near the sewing 
machine is never empty long. 

Making Old-Fashioned Rose Jar 

Gather the rose petals on a dry day after the dew is gone and 
place these 'petals in rose jars, which are vases with lids, or in 
fruit jars. Arrange the petals in thin layers, covering each one 
with a thin layer of salt. Repeat until the jar is filled. If one 
wishes, a handful of lavender flowers or rosemary leaves may be 
added. Add 3 or 4 ounces of pulverized bay salt, 1 ounce of nut- 
meg, 1 ounce of cinnamon and 1 ounce of cloves. Keep the jar 
closely covered except when the perfume is wanted in a room. 
These are especially attractive additions to old-fashioned bed- 
rooms. 

Making Money in the Farm Home 

The homemaker of the farm household who wishes to make 
money will find that there are many products which she can 
sell. The important factor is to find a market for these articles. 
An exclusive trade of city customers is the most satisfactory for 



HOUSEHOLD EECIPES 233 

these people are willing to pay for the word coimtry when ap- 
plied to a product. Eggs direct from the country, homemade 
country sausage, horseradish or cottage cheese are worth more to 
a city dweller than store eggSj sausage, horseradish and cheese. 
A few of the articles which farm women may sell with profit are 
poultry and poultry products, homemade jellies and jams, 
canned fruit and vegetables, horseradish^ cottage cheese, vin- 
egars, flowers, ferns, rhubarb and fancy fruit preserves. If the 
home is large enough, city boarders may be taken during the 
summer months when vacation season arrives. Occasionally a 
market for fancy work and other types of hand sewing may be 
found. 

Making Baby's First Bed 

Select a stout clothes basket with strong handles. A satis- 
factory length for this is 36 inches. The easiest way to make 
this basket attractive is to apply two coats of flat white paint 
to it, allowing the first coat to dry before the second one is 
added. For a finish a coat of white enamel is applied. Then 
the basket is lined so it will make a soft bed. First, take a roll 
of cotton batting and distribute it evenly on the sides of the 
basket, tacking it in place with thread. Cover this with a wash- 
able material, such as dotted swiss, mull, silkaline, cheesecloth 
or dimity. A very pretty effect is obtained by using two linings, 
the under one being of a delicate pink or blue which shows 
through the white top lining of sheer lawn, dotted net or some 
other fabric. Usually these baskets are about 10 or 15 inches 
deep. To line them cut the material, which is 36 inches vsdde 
and 2 yards long, in two strips 18 inches in width. Sew these 
together making one long piece. The raw edges are turned back 
and the strip is gathered at the top and bottom so it will fit the 
basket. A heading is allowed at the top for a finish. Then the 
gathered strip is glued or sewed at the top and bottom of the 
inside of the basket. To make the bassinet comfortable, as well 
as pretty, a mattress or pillow is placed in the bottom. 

Removing Fish Odors 

The odor of fish or cabbage may be removed from dishes by 
filling them with boiling water and dropping a piece of char- 



234 THE FAEM COOK AND RULE BOOK 

coal in the water. After standing a short time the undesirable 
odor will disappear. 

Cleaning Irons 

Wipe the flat iron with oiled or wax paper and rub it on a 
piece of fine sandpaper which is tacked on the ironing board, 
or on dry salt. 

Making Cellars Warmer 

Paste heavy paper over the rafters in the ceiling and down 
over the sills and around the frames of the windows, using the 
paste which is applied in hanging wall paper. The addition of 
2 teaspoonfuls of Venetian turpentine to the paste will help 
make the paper stick. 

Loosening Drawers Which Stick 

Rub the parts of the drawers which stick with yellow soap, 
with paste wax or with tallow. 

Pilling Cracks in Floors 

Putty may be used for filling cracks in floors but it shows 
through varnish or any finish placed on the surface. Another 
filling may be made by dissolving 1 ounce of glue in 2 cupfuls 
of boiling water. While this is hot, tiny bits of newspaper are 
stirred into it. When the mass becomes as thick as putty, it is 
placed in the cracks, being pushed in tightly with a putty knife. 
If a putty knife is not available, a blunt-edged case knife may 
be used. This filling should be put in the cracks while hot and 
finished evenly at the top. If one wishes, it may be colored to 
match the stain in the wood. 



Mending Wall Paper 

Select the right portion of the pattern in the roll for the 
patch. Then tear an irregular piece instead of cutting it. Paste 
this over the tear in the paper on the wall. 



HOUSEHOLD EECIPES 235 

Removing Grease Spots from Walls 

Fold a piece of white blotting paper and pin French chalk in 
the fold. Hold this over the grease spot, ironing it with an elec- 
tric or flat iron, taking care that the wall is not scorched. 
Change the position of the blotting paper frequently. 

Drying Herbs 

Among the herbs which may be grown in the garden or in 
window boxes are sage, parsley, thyme, chervil, basil and mint. 
The leaves from these plants may be picked, spread on paper 
and dried in a warm room, but not in direct sunlight, for use in 
the winter. 

Powdering Herbs 

The dried herbs may be placed in tightly covered cans for 
storage. If one wishes, they may be powdered by being pounded 
in a wooden chopping bowl with a wooden potato masher. 

Making Pan Holders 

The hands will be saved many burns if hot pan holders are 
kept in the kitchen for use when one is cooking. Satisfactory 
holders are made by cutting diamond shaped pieces from heavy 
table padding and covering these with removable gingham 
covers which may be washed. If an unbleached muslin pocket 
is made for these holders and hung near the kitchen stove, one 
never needs to look for them. 

Storing Vegetables 

For home use cabbage and root vegetables may be stored in the 
cellar for early winter consumption and outdoors in pits for late 
winter use. The great danger of cellar storage for these vege- 
tables is that they may wilt. This can be overcome to some 
extent by packing them in boxes with alternate layers of sand 
or earth and setting these boxes in the coolest part of the base- 
ment. The outer leaves of the cabbage are removed before the 
heads are packed in the boxes. 

Usually the pits for outdoor storage are made above the 



236 THE FAEM COOK AND EULE BOOK 

ground unless one is certain that the drainage is unusually good. 
The cabbage is pulled with roots and leaves on and the heads 
are placed in regular rows on a level stretch of ground. The 
heads are placed down. The common way is to arrange three 
heads in a row with two heads on top. Earth is piled against 
the cabbage until the plants, including the roots, are entirely 
covered. In cold climates a layer of manure is placed over this 
pile. Parsnips, salsify and horseradish may be stored in this 
same way. They are covered with 6 or 8 inches of earth. Tur- 
nips, rutabagas, potatoes, beets and carrots may be stored in 
outdoor pits, but they must be covered sufficiently so they will 
not freeze. Usually it is more convenient to store these vege- 
tables in the cellar or cave. In case there are not facilities for 
cellar or basement storage, place the vegetables on the ground 
and cover them with 8 inches of straw or hay. Then cover the 
straw with 8 inches of earth. A layer of manure is then placed 
outside the earth. 

Celery may be stored in the cellar or cave if it is cool. The 
plants are dug with the roots on and are planted in moist earth 
on the cellar or cave floor. The earth about the plant roots is 
wet occasionally, but care must be taken not to moisten the 
leaves. 

After onions are pulled, they should be allowed to dry or 
cure before being stored. If the cellar is cool, the onions may 
be placed in baskets and hung at the top of the cellar. Attic 
storage is satisfactory if there is a place near the chimney where 
it is warm enough to keep the onions from freezing. Darkness 
keeps them from sprouting. 

Sweet potatoes, pumpkins and squashes must be stored in a 
warm and dry place where there is a free circulation of air. A 
good way to keep sweet potatoes is to put them in slatted boxes 
which are set in an upstairs room which is kept warm all the 
time or in a basement where there is a furnace. 

Mending Rugs 

Select a piece of soft, flimsy woolen material or burlap and 
baste this under the hole in the floor covering. Either darn this 
down with yarn to match that used in the rug or use the yarn 
double and stick the needle through from the top. bring it up in 



HOUSEHOLD EECIPES 237 

almost the same place and tie to the end above. Eepeat this 
process until the surface of the patch is covered with loops. Trim 
these off evenly. 

Removing Varnish 

Wash the surface with strong lye water, using a scrub brush 
so the hands will not touch the water. When most of the var- 
nish disappears, rinse the surface two or three times with clear 
water. The few spots of varnish left may be removed by apply- 
ing wood alcohol or by being rubbed with sandpaper. The sur- 
face should be sandpapered before being refinished. 

Sweetening Rancid Butter 

Soak the butter in water to which a small handful of baking 
soda has been added. After soaking some little time, drain off 
the water and wash the butter with sweet milk. Work the milk 
out thoroughly and the flavor of the butter will be fresh. 

Pigments for Stains 

When staining furniture, woodwork or floors^ burnt umber 
may be added to give a black walnut color, burnt sienna for ma- 
hogany and yellow ocher for a yellow shade. Three tablespoon- 
fuls of any of these materials are added to a gallon of the stain. 

Polishes for Woodwork 

A good polish for wood surfaces is made by mixing together 
1 cupful of turpentine, 1 cupful of linseed oil and 1 cupful of 
vinegar. Another excellent polish is prepared by mixing 1 cup- 
ful of linseed oil, 1 cupful of turpentine and 1 teaspoonful of 
ammonia together. Either of these polishes is sprinkled lightly 
on a soft cloth and applied to the furniture or woodwork with 
the grain of the wood. 

Repairing Plaster 

Cut away the edges of the crack or hole with a sharp paring 
knife, making them straight. Fill the cavity with plaster of 
Paris mixed with a little vinegar. The vinegar keeps the plaster 



238 THE FARM COOK AND RULE BOOK 

of Paris from setting so quickly. A good filling for cracks in 
plaster is made by mixing II/2 tablespoonfuls of plaster of Paris 
with 3 tablespoonfuls of fine sand and moistening the mixture 
with vinegar. 

Removing Putty 

Putty may be removed from glass by applying a heated iron 
to the spot and when it becomes soft, scraping it off with a knife. 
If the putty is on the wood, either soften it with the hot iron, 
taking care not to scorch the wood, or apply a little dilute sul- 
phuric acid to it with a brush. After using the acid, wash the 
surface with soapy water and rinse two or three times in clear 
water. 

Renovating Gilt Picture Frames 

If pieces of the frame are broken off, use a bit of putty prop- 
erly shaped to build up the surface. Then apply a coat of gold 
paint. The putty should be allowed to dry before the paint is 
added. 

Packing Books and Pictures in Moving 

Since books are so heavy, pack them in several small boxes or 
barrels instead of one large one. Wrap the books in small pack- 
ages, placing a layer of paper between the bindings. Place about 
6 books in every package. Use old newspapers for the wrapping 
paper. Tie every package of books with cord so they cannot rub 
together. These packages of books are packed in the box or bar- 
rel, the open space being filled with crumpled newspaper or ex- 
celsior so the books cannot move within the box. 

Two pictures are packed together face to face with a blanket 
or quilt between them. Small ones are placed among clothes in 
bureau drawers and the large ones are crated. 

Clearing Room of Mosquitoes 

Mosquitoes may be driven from a room by hanging tender 
branches of castor beans here and there or by spreading wilted 
leaves of the castor bean in different parts of the room. The 
Entomology Bureau of the United States Department of Agri- 
culture recommends sprinkling equal parts of spirits of camphor 



HOUSEHOLD RECIPES 239 

and oil of citronella and I/2 part of oil of cedar on a towel and 
hanging this at the head of a bed in a room infested with mos- 
quitoes. 

Preparing a Dust Cloth 

Dust will collect on the furniture if too much polish is ap- 
plied. A good way to add the right amount is to place 2 table- 
spoonfuls of the polish in a glass fruit jar, rolling the can until 
its sides are coated with the polish. Then insert the tightly 
rolled dust cloth, close the fruit jar and let stand 2 days. The 
polish will be evenly distributed on the cloth. 

Making Wliitewash 

Place 10 pounds of quicklime in a container and stir in 2 
gallons of water. Cover and let stand an hour, stirring occa- 
sionally. The addition of 4% pounds of salt will make the 
whitewash stick better. 

A whitewash which will last longer is made by using 38 pounds 
of quicklime, 3 pounds of sodium phosphate, 5 pounds of caseine 
and 91^ gallons of water. Mix the lime and the water and 
when cool, add the casein dissolved in the solution of sodium 
phosphate. This is used for exterior purposes. 

Another excellent recipe for whitewash is this : mix 50 pounds 
of hydrated lime in boiling water until a thin paste is formed. 
Add 1 peck of salt, 3 pounds of rice flour, I/2 pound of Spanish 
whiting and 1 pound of clear glue dissolved in boiling water. 
The salt should be dissolved in boiling water and the rice flour 
boiled with water to a thin paste before it is added to the salt 
solution. After mixing thoroughly, the mixture is allowed to 
stand several days. When being applied^ the whitewash should 
be hot if possible.

Homemade Soap from Cracklings 

Pour 2 gallons of water into an iron kettle and empty 3 cans 
of lye into it. Let cool 1 hour. Place the lye mixture on the 
stove and add 14 pounds of fryings or cracklings. Let this boil 
until every particle of grease is dissolved. Add cold water from 
time to time, adding just enough to keep the quantity of liquid 
the same all the time. The addition of cold water also keeps the 
mixture from boiling over. 

When all the grease is dissolved, set the mixture aside to cool 
overnight. In the morning skim off the white crust and brown 
jelly, leaving the sediment in the bottom. Dispose of the sedi- 
ment and wash the kettle. Put the white crust and jelly back 
into the kettle and boil 2 hours. Then add boiling water until 
the soap becomes the consistency of honey when dropped from 
a stick. Be careful not to add too much water. Pour into molds 
or boxes, which have been wet first in cold water, and cover the 
soap while cooling. Do not let freeze before it is hard. 

Laundry Soap from Fat 

Use 1% gallons of water to every 1 pound box of lye and 5 
pounds of fat to every pound of lye. Dissolve the lye in the 
water. As soon as the solution boils, stir in the fat and boil 
until the mass becomes the consistency of honey when dropped 
from a stick. When almost done, a small portion should be 
placed in a saucer and if it solidifies, the mass should be re- 
moved from the stove, poured into wet molds and set away in 
a warm place to harden.

Soap without Boiling 

Dissolve 2 pounds of soda lye in 6 quarts of water. When 
cool, add this to 14 pounds of melted, but not heated, fat. Stir 
the mixture until it resembles the consistency of honey and is 
creamy. Pour into granite-ware pans, wet first in cold water, 
or in pasteboard boxes. When almost hard, cut in squares. 
Pack it with open spaces between pieces and allow to dry for 
at least a month before using. This makes a hard laundry- 
soap. 

Soap Jelly for Washing Woolens 

Shave 2 cakes of any mild white soap in 2 quarts of water, add 
1 cupful of borax and heat gently until the soap is dissolved. 
Pour this in fruit jars, cover and use as needed. 

Whitening Flannels and Silks 

If white woolen or silk garments, such as baby flannels, white 
serges, silk gloves and hose, become yellowed, they may be 
whitened with hydrogen peroxide. To every 10 pints of luke- 
warm water add 1 pint of hydrogen peroxide and a few drops' 
of household ammonia. Soak the clothes in this solution until 
they are white. 

Starch Making 

Mix % cupful of starch with i/4 cupful of cold water and add 
14 teaspoonful of shaved white wax and 4 cupfuls of boiling 
water. Boil a few minutes, stirring to prevent sticking, and 
cool before using. This makes a thick starch. If thin starch is 
desired, add 4 cupfuls of cold water to the thick starch and stir 
until the mixture is smooth. Salt added to starch prevents it 
from freezing in clothes hung outdoors in cold weather. To a 
quart of cooked starch add 2 teaspoonfuls of salt. Gum arable 
may be added to increase the gloss and to provide stiffness. In 
fact, starch containing gum arable gives material the appear- 
ance and body that new fabrics have. 

To prepare the gum arable for use in starch dissolve 2 ounces 
of white gum arable in 2 cupfuls of water. Place the gum 



242 THE FAEM COOK AND EULE BOOK 

arable in a fruit jar, add the water, cover tightly and shake until 
it is dissolved. After the solution has stood 2 days, drain 
through cheesecloth and bottle for future use. Just before tak- 
ing the boiled starch from the stove, add 1 tablespoonful of the 
gum arabic solution. 

Rice Starch 

Add 4 tablespoonfuls of washed rice to 1 quart of rapidly 
boiling water. Cook until the rice is a pulp, adding more hot 
water occasionally so the amount will remain the same. When 
the rice is cooked to a pulp, add 1 quart of boiling water and 
strain, without pressing, through a flannel bag. Use while hot, 
diluting with a little cool water if it is too thick. 

Tinted Starches 

A little tea may be added to the starch used with dark fab- 
rics and a few drops of bluing improve the appearance of the 
starch used with white and blue materials. 



Uncooked Starch 

To 3 tablespoonfuls of starch and 1 teaspoonful of borax add 
2 cupfuls of tepid water. Stir and use immediately. 

Setting Colors 

Add 1 pint of salt and 1 tablespoonful of powdered alum to 1 
gallon of water and use in soaking fabrics to set the following 
colors : pink, brown, red, yellow, gray, black and black and white 
mixtures. 

Green is set by soaking the garment in 1 gallon of water to 
which 1 tablespoonful of powdered alum has been added. 

If strong salt water fails to set blue dye in fabrics, 1 table- 
spoonful of powdered alum, ^2 cupful of strong vinegar and 1 
tablespoonful of sugar of lead, a poison, may be added to a gal- 
lon of water used in the soaking. 

Lavender and purple are set by being soaked in a gallon of 
water to which % cupful of strong vinegar is added.

Bleaching Yellowed WMte Fabrics 

To bleach yellowed white cotton and linen fabrics, moisten 
the material in a solution made by dissolving 2 teaspoonfuls of 
potassium permanganate in 2 quarts of water. Rinse in a clear 
warm water. The material will become brown. Then dip it in 
a dilute oxalic acid solution, made by diluting the concentrated 
acid in an equal amount of water. Rinse through several waters, 
one of which is soapy. 

If all the white clothes appear a little yellow, use a lemon or 
oxalic acid rinse when washing. Use l^ tubful of hot water 
and add the juice of 4 large lemons or 2 tablespoonfuls of oxalic 
acid crystals first dissolved in a little warm water. Put the 
clothes in this rinse a few at a time and let stand 4 or 5 minutes 
and then put through a clear hot rinse. 

Drying the clothes outdoors in the sunshine is the best way 
to keep them white. Slightly yellowed garments may be wet in 
water and spread on the grass in the sunshine to bleach. 

Washing Pillows and Feathers 

Fill a tub almost full of water and add 1 cupful of borax and 
1 tablespoonful of ammonia. Place soiled feather pillows in this 
and boil 20 minutes. Scrub the tick to make certain it is clean. 
Rinse three times in clear warm water and hang outdoors in the 
wind, but in a shady place if possible. If one wishes, the feath- 
ers may be poured through a small opening in the tick into a 
muslin bag. Then the feathers and the pillow covering may be 
washed separately. 

Javelle Water 

1 pound sal soda or pearl ash ^ pound chloride of lime 

2 quarts cold water 

Mix the ingredients thoroughly and let stand overnight. Pour 
off the clear liquid and bottle for use. Store in a cool, dark 
place. To use Javelle Water, stretch the stained article and 
rub the liquid into it. Then rinse it quickly in clear water 
and rub a little if necessary. When the stain is gone, rinse in 
a little ammonia water. Javelle water is used only in removing 
stains from white cottons and linens.

LABOR-SAVING DEVICES 

Washing Machines 

Washing machines furnish the mechanical force needed to re- 
move soil from clothing. Everything else must be supplied by 
the homemaker. 

Dirt is held in clothing by two substances, grease and albu- 
minous materials, largely skin excretions. The first purpose of 
washing is to dissolve these substances so the particles of soil will 
be loosened. 

Grease is dissolved by soapy water and for this reason soap is 
used in washing. The albuminous materials are dissolved most 
easily in tepid water; they, like the albumin in egg white, are 
set by hot water. 

If the washing machine is to accomplish excellent results, the 
water placed in it should not be scalding hot, but tepid, and it 
should contain an abundance of soap suds. A good way to 
judge the temperature of the water is to have it just hot enough 
that the hands may be placed in it with comfort. The operation 
of the machine forces the soapy water back and forth through 
the meshes of the fabrics, in this way dissolving the materials 
holding the soil. 

Types of Machines 

There are four kinds of washing machines, all of which may 
be driven by hand, electricity or gasoline engines. Vacuum 
machines have inverted cups or funnels which cleanse by moving 
up and down, forcing water through the fibers of the cloth. In 
the cylinder type the garments are placed in the cylinder of 
metal or wood. As this revolves within the tub, the clothes are 
lifted out of the water and dropped back into it so the water 
moves back and forth through the clothing. 

246 



LABOE-SAVING DEVICES 247 

The tub of the oscillator machine rocks back and forth like a 
cradle, this motion forcing the soapy suds through the fabrics 
being washed. Then there is the dolly type, so called on account 
of the agitator or disc known as the dolly which fits down on the 
clothes. This grasps the garments while turning and reversing, 
accomplishing the cleaning by this movement of the water back 
and forth through the clothing. The tubs of these machines 
usually have corrugated sides. 

Machines Rinse Efficiently 

Clothes are first placed in the machine that the dirt in them 
may be loosened. After this process, which is commonly called 
rubbing, the garments are rinsed to remove loosened particles 
of dirt. Since the water needs to be forced through the fabrics 
in this process, the mechanical force of the machine gives better 
results than rinsing the clothes by hand in a tub. Rinsing 
water should be hot, too warm for the hands to be inserted with 
comfort. 

After the clothes are rinsed, they are put through a bluing 
water and then they are hung on the line. If considerable 
moisture is left in them, the clothes will be more nearly white 
when dry. The water, wind and sunshine provide for the proc- 
ess of oxidation, nature's way of bleaching. 

The washing machine is a saver of human strength and the 
garments. With its use rubbing on the board is not necessary, 
provided moderately warm or tepid, but not hot, soapy water is 
used for the washing and hot water is used for the rinsing, which, 
of course, must be forced back and forth through the clothes 
until all traces of soil and soap are removed. 

Dehydrating Foods 

Dehydration is the outgrowth of drying foods. It is an im- 
provement over the older method of food preservation. In 
drying, foodstufi^s are either exposed 'to the direct heat of the 
sun or are placed in an evaporator which sets over the kitchen 
range. In some cases the drying process is hastened by oven 
heat. All of these methods of expelling the moisture rupture 
the plant cells. This allows the volatile materials to escape with 



248 THE FARM COOK AND RULE BOOK 

the moisture. It is in this way that the taste and appearance 
of the foods are changed and in addition all the volatile food 
value is lost. Dried fruits and vegetables are cooked to some 
extent in their own juices during the drying. 

Dehydrators are constructed so that nothing but the moisture 
is driven off during dehydration. This device has slots in the 
bottom through which air is admitted. Above these are several 
open-mesh wire shelves on which the products to be dehydrated, 
after being sliced or cut in small pieces, are placed. A kero- 
sene burner at the bottom warms the air, thereby hastening the 
evaporation of the moisture. To make certain that the right 
temperature is maintained all the time so the cells will not be 
broken by too much heat, a thermometer hangs in front of the 
shelves where it may be seen through the doors. The tempera- 
ture of this device is no more difficult to regulate than is that 
of an incubator. 

The heated air rises in and around the food on the shelves 
and escapes through an opening in the top. Fresh air enters 
through the openings in the bottom and this continual circula- 
tion of air makes it possible to dehydrate foods in a sanitary 
manner in from 10 to 12 hours. 

Dehydrated foods are stored in paraffin coated paper cartons, 
glass fruit jars wrapped in paper or heavy paper bags. The sur- 
prising factor is that when the foods are cooked, after being 
soaked several hours in cold water, they taste and appear much 
like fresh products. They are a great economy in storage space 
because the removal of the water decreases the bulk of foods 
greatly. One pound of dehydrated pumpkin, for example, makes 
18 pumpkin pies of ordinary size. 

Self-Freezing Ice Cream Freezers 

Among the labor-saving devices on the market are the vacuum 
ice cream freezers which have no crank to be turned. The cream 
mixture is simply poured into the freezer after the ice and salt 
have been placed in a separate compartment, and there is no 
stirring during the freezing process. 

The construction of this appliance is similar to that of a fire- 
less cooker. When making ice cream, the freezer is inverted and 
the ice and salt mixture are placed in their compartment. A 



LABOR-SAVING DEVICES 249 

cupful of cold water is added to start the melting and then the 
lid is adjusted. The freezer is turned right side up and the ice 
cream mixture is poured in its compartment. The lid is ad- 
justed tightly. The walls of the freezer are constructed with 
a vacuum space so that it is impossible for the cold temperature 
provided by the melting ice to escape. 

An old theory that ice cream will be coarse grained if it is not 
stirred with a dasher during the freezing has been upset by this 
appliance. Experience shows that a thin watery cream mixture 
produces a cream coarse in texture while a rich creamy one is a 
velvety, fine ice cream when frozen. 

Long-handled Plunger 

When one does not have a washing machine, a plunger may 
be used to advantage. This device consists of an inverted fun- 
nel or cone, a vacuum cup, fastened on to a handle like a broom- 
stick. The tub partly filled with soiled clothing and soapy, 
lukewarm water is set on the floor. Then the plunger is pushed 
up and down on the clothing, the movement being the same as 
that of a churn dasher. This vacuum cup forces the soapy water 
back and forth through the fabrics, loosening the dirt in them. 
In rinsing the process is the same except that the washed cloth- 
ing is placed in clean hot water, instead of soap suds. The ease 
with which the plunger is operated depends on how successful 
the worker is in keeping his back straight. Even strokes cleanse 
more quickly than uneven ones. This appliance is especially 
helpful in laundering blankets, quilts, overalls and other heavy 
articles without a washing machine. 

Kerosene Stoves 

Although kerosene stoves are used throughout the year, they 
are especially helpful in the hot weather when the heat of the 
range is objectionable. If they are given a position in the kitchen 
where breezes cannot blow upon them very often, they seldom 
smoke. There are two types of kerosene stoves; those which 
have wicks and those that are wickless. It is important that 
those without wicks be placed on a level foundation. When the 
floor slopes a little, pieces of cardboard or tiny blocks may be 
placed under the legs of the stove to level it. 



250 THE FAEM COOK AND EXILE BOOK 

Every oil stove gives better satisfaction if kept clean. It takes 
only five or ten minutes every morning to keep it in this condi- 
tion. Soap and water are the best cleansing agents, for in a rich 
suds every part of the stove may be washed. A small brush is 
helpful in scrubbing the corners a cloth cannot reach. 

A small whisk broom is efficient in cleaning the asbestos ring, 
the metal jackets and spreaders in the wickless stove. By gen- 
tle brushing the small particles of dirt which might interfere 
with the flame are removed. \ATien the stove has a wick, it 
must be kept smooth and even. Trimming with scissors brings 
disaster because it is not possible to cut it evenly. If the wick 
is new, it is well to let the uneven flame bum a few minutes 
until the edge becomes well charred. The charred surface may 
be packed down and made even. This is done best by placing 
a piece of soft tissue paper over the finger and then pressing 
down gently. Wicks cared for in this way will last much longer 
and give better results than if they are trimmed with scissors. 

If the flame becomes low when there is plenty of oil in the 
supply tank, the pipe which carries the oil to the burner is 
clogged. To clean this remove the cap at the end of the pipe 
and force oil through until it flows freely. 

There is a type of kerosene stove with an oven attached. In 
these stoves the baking is practically the same as in an ordinary 
cook stove. Most models, however, have separate ovens. These 
are not heavily insulated, and for this reason they heat and bake 
rapidly, while when there is insulation to be heated considerable 
kerosene is burned before the oven is ready for baking. It is 
advisable to buy the oven made for the particular type of stove 
being used. The main precaution, of course, is, if the flame 
comes near the top of the stove, that the floor of the oven be 
elevated at least six inches to give adequate space for combustion. 

Kerosene Water Heaters 

Oil heaters for the hot-water tank are a welcome piece of 
equipment in homes where there is running water. Its care is 
similar to that of a kerosene stove. Drafts should be avoided 
and all parts should be kept clean. The wicks will last longer in 
the heaters and in the stoves if the supply tank is kept well filled 
with oil. When there is no oil, the wick burns in its place. 



LABOE-SAVING DEVICES 251 

Pressure Cookers 

The pressure cooker is nothing more than a steam-tight kettle. 
The enclosed steam creates pressure and the pressure raises the 
temperature, cooking food quickly. In this kettle any food which 
is to be boiled or steamed can be cooked rapidly with a great 
saving of time and fuel. Foods which must be cooked a long 
time ordinarily, such as chicken and beans, may be steamed or 
boiled in the pressure cooker in a few minutes and then browned 
in the oven afterward. 

These cookers are not complicated. First, there is a steam 
gauge which registers the pressure. This must be kept clean 
and dry. Then there is a pet-cock to let out the steam when the 
cooking is completed. It is wise to leave the pet-cock open when 
the food starts to cook, giving the cold air in the cooker a chance 
to escape, but when the steam starts to come out, it is closed. 

The safety valve lets off steam. It works automatically, 
making the utensil safe. To keep it in order, loosen the valve 
when not in use so the moisture will not corrode it. If it leaks 
steam, a good cleaning, scouring and oiling of all the parts is 
needed. When the cooking begins, the safety valve must be 
closed. The cooker must always contain water when it is heated 
or it may crack or bulge. Usually 1/4 cupful of water is suffi- 
cient. After the food has been cooked long enough, the lid must 
not be opened until the steam has been let out through the pet- 
cock. 

Since most cookers have two pans which fit into them, different 
kinds of foods may be cooked at the same time. For instance, 
meat might be placed in the bottom of the cooker and the two 
pans, one holding a vegetable and the other rice pudding, could 
be cooking above. If one wishes to have the meat browned, it 
can be seared in the bottom of the cooker in a little fat before 
water is added and the lid is adjusted. Potatoes can be cooked 
with the meat. It takes from 30 to 40 minutes to cook a meat 
stew in the cooker while 3 hours are required for the same process 
on top of the stove. There is a saving of time comparable to 
this in cooking all foods. Even Boston Baked Beans may be 
prepared in 50 minutes. The beans are cooked in the pressure 
cooker 25 minutes and then they are browned in a hot oven the 
other 25 minutes. 



252 THE FARM COOK AND RULE BOOK 

Entire meals may be cooked in the pressure cooker. Here are 
some of the combinations which may be cooked at the same time : 
fried chicken, steamed potatoes and buttered carrots; Swiss 
steak, steamed squash and potatoes; ham stew and rice pudding; 
and baked beans, steamed brown bread and apple sauce. 



Fireless Cookers 

The fireless cooker is a device for conserving the heat of 
cooking foods; therefore it saves fuel. It also is economical of 
the homemaker's time and energy. Using it in the summer 
helps to keep the kitchen cool. 

This appliance consists of one or more cooking compartments 
fitted with utensils and insulated to retain the heat of foods 
introduced, thus finishing their cooking in their own heat. 

It is not difficult to manage a fireless cooker because the foods 
do not spoil if over-cooked with the constantly lowering tem- 
perature. If the food should be underdone, it may be reheated 
and placed in the cooker again. Less water is used in this type 
of cookery, since there is little evaporation after the food is 
placed in the fireless. The radiators of soapstone or metal are 
heated on the stove and placed in the cooker, then the heated 
food is added and the lid is closed. Frequently a heated radiator 
is placed on top of the container holding the food ; this is always 
done when baking. The insulated walls retain the heat of the 
food and the radiators so that the foods within cook slowly. 

A Homemade Fireless 

A fireless cooker of considerable merit can be made in the 
home. A tin lard can, wood candy box, any tightly built box or 
an old trunk may be used for the outer container in which 
insulation and a utensil for holding the food are placed. A tin 
or agate bucket with straight sides and a tightly fitting cover is 
suitable for holding the food to be cooked. 

The packing between the lard can or outer container and the 
bucket which is to hold the food should be a poor conductor of 
heat. Among the materials which are usually available in most 
farm homes for use in this way are: excelsior, shredded news- 



LABOR-SAVING DEVICES 253 

papers, straw, hay, lint cotton and wool. The lard can is lined 
with sheet asbestos about % inch thick. The nest or well, as it 
is called, in which the bucket of food is to set is also lined with 
this asbestos. The packing is placed between. If possible, have 
at least 4 inches of this insulation between the lard can and the 
bucket. If two wells or nests are to be made, such as is the case 
when an old trunk is used for the outer container, 6 inches of 
packing should be placed between the two nests. 

First Hne the lard can or other utensil used in its place with 
asbestos, then place 4 or more inches of the packing in the 
bottom. Make the nest of asbestos, being sure that it is large 
enough so the bucket can be placed in it easily. Set this in the 
lard can and stuff in the packing firmly between the nest and the 
sides of the can. Make a collar of sheet asbestos to fit between 
the sides of the can and the nest, fitting this over the top to hide 
the packing. This should fit tightly. When this is done, make 
a cushion of muslin and fill with the packing. This should be 
4 inches thick and it is fitted on top of the fireless cooker, filling 
the space between the top of the bucket and the asbestos collar 
and the top of the lard can. Place the cover on the lard can or 
other container and the fireless cooker is made. In this type of 
cooker the food is heated to the boiling point in the bucket and 
placed in the nest. The insulation retains the heat which com- 
pletes the cookery. No radiators are used. The homemade 
cooker is adapted to cooking cereals, stewed and boiled foods; 
the commercial devices with their discs which may be heated and 
placed under and above the foods may also be used for baking 
and roasting. 

Layer Steamers 

Steamers on the market nowadays have two pans which fit 
into them above the water so that two or more kinds of foods 
may be steamed at the same time. While this is being done, 
another food may be stewing or boiling in the bottom part of the 
steamer kettle. When kerosene or gas stoves are used, this type 
of a steam kettle reduces the amount of fuel used in preparing 
a meal. In addition, they provide a saving of food value. In 
boiling foods, especially the vegetables, some of the food value 
dissolves in the liquid in which they cook. If this liquor is 



254 THE FARM COOK AND RULE BOOK 

drained off, it is frequently thrown away so the food elements in 
it are lost. Steamed foods retain all of their nutritive value 
because they are not cooked in water. 

Care of Refrigerators 

Three factors are essential in caring for refrigerators. They 
must be kept cool;, dry and clean. Coolness is obtained in most 
cases by the use of ice. When ice is placed in its compartment, 
the air about it becomes cold. Since cold air is heavier than 
warm air, the cold air falls down around the shelves containing 
the food, absorbing the heat. The warm air rises and passes into 
the ice chamber where it becomes cold and heavy. Then it falls 
to the bottom of the refrigerator. It is this continual circulation 
of cold and warm air that keeps the food in a refrigerator cold. 

The old belief that it is economical to wrap paper or a blanket 
about the ice in the refrigerator to make it last longer is incor- 
rect. It takes the warm air much longer to reach the ice to be 
cooled, which interferes with the circulation of the warm and 
cold air. 

Butter, cream, milk and water should be kept on the lower 
shelf, as should other foods requiring a low temperature. The 
bottom shelf is the coldest part of the refrigerator. Meats, 
vegetables and fruits may be placed on the next shelf above and 
the top shelf should be reserved for cheese and other foods with 
a strong odor. The warm air takes up these odors as it rises and 
carries them to the ice chamber from which they should escape 
through the drain pipe. It is unwise to keep food directly on 
the ice unless tightly covered for it will absorb these odors. 
Moreover, it is cooler in other parts of the refrigerator. 

Dryness is essential in refrigeration because the micro- 
organisms which grow in foods causing them to spoil develop 
best in warm, moist and unclean places. Poor circulation of air 
or washing the refrigerator w^ith warm water so steam forms on 
the walls makes the refrigerator moist. 

The best way to keep the refrigerator clean is to wipe up 
every spot with a damp cloth as soon as anything is spilled. 
Once a week a thorough washing may be given with a little cool 
water to which a teaspoonful of baking soda has been added. 
The washed surface is dried with a clean towel. The drain pipe 



LABOE-SAVING DEVICES 255 

can be taken out and washed with hot soapy water and a long- 
handled brush. It is cooled before being placed back in the 
refrigerator. 

Making an Iceless Refrigerator 

Have a box made 3I/2 feet high, 2 feet wide and 18 inches 
deep. The top and bottom should be solid and the sides of 
screen wire. It is best to use copper or galvanized wire since it 
does not rust. The front should be hinged to make a door. 
Put in two adjustable shelves from 12 to 15 inches apart, and 
have these made of slats or of the wire screening fastened on a 
wooden frame. On top of this set a bread pan about 16 or 18 
inches square or use a shallow dish pan. Stand the whole box 
in another shallow pan. Paint the pans and box white and, 
when dry, apply a coat of white enamel. 

Then make a covering of white cotton flannel to fit over the 
box. An old blanket or grain sacks sewed together may be used 
instead of the flannel. Use the smooth side of the flannel on the 
outside and fasten the covering with hooks and eyes. Sew one 
row of hooks on the door near the fastening and another just 
opposite the door so that the hems will project over and keep out 
the warm aip-thaTbtherwise might enter. Fasten the covering at 
the top^.a:^well as at the side. Two double strips one-half the 
wkttn of the side should be sewed to the top of each side and 
ftUowed to extend over two or three inches into the pan on the 
top which contains water. 

Set this refrigerator outdoors in a shady place or in the kitchen 
under a window where there is a good circulation of air. Keep 
the wicks in the supply of fresh water in the upper pan. This 
type of refrigerator gives best results on dry, hot days. It is not 
good for use in extremely damp weather or at the seashore since 
there is not enough evaporation to cool the food within on the 
shelves. 

The Kitchen's Dumb Waiter 

A dumb waiter between the kitchen and the basement saves 
many steps. These shelves which are built like those of a cup- 
board are pulled back and forth. They are operated by a cord 
and a counter weight. To be of the greatest use the shelves 



256 THE FAEM COOK AND EULE BOOK 

should be wide enough so that crocks and other large utensils 
may rest on them and no farther apart than it is necessary to 
have them to accommodate the articles to be carried on them. 

The shaft which extends into the basement should be provided 
with a screen door if possible, so the food lowered into the base- 
ment in the waiter to be kept cool will be protected. For a 
woman of average height the upper door for the shelves should 
be about three feet from the kitchen floor. 

Mguking a Sponge Box 

In the cold weather it is frequently very difficult for the 
housekeeper to find a place to set the bread sponge at night so it 
will not chill. A sponge box may be made without much expense 
or labor for this purpose and it is the best way to keep the bread 
sponge at the right temperature. 

A box 26x20x20 inches is a good size. In this about 10 
inches from the bottom a shelf is made of slats which rests on 
cleats fastened to the sides of the box. Four inches above this a 
shelf constructed in the same way as the lower one is inserted. 

Under the lower shelf a sheet of galvanized iron slightly 
wider than the shelf is inserted. It is curved in appearance when 
in position. This helps to distribute the heat from a lamp which 
sets in the bottom of the box and to keep the heat from scorching 
the lower shelf. The door is on hinges and is fastened with a 
hook and staple. 

Bore several holes in the top of the box and the upper parts 
of the sides. In the center of the top, bore a hole and fasten in 
it securely a cork through which a hole large enough to admit a 
chemical thermometer has been made. Use a Fahrenheit ther- 
mometer, one that will register as high as 100 degrees. 

If a kerosene lamp is to be used to heat the sponge box, line 
the box with sheets of asbestos or tin to avoid danger of fire. A 
16-candle power electric light will provide sufficient heat for the 
box and it will not be necessary to line the box if this is used. 

The bread sponge is set on the top shelf, a shallow pan of 
water on the lower shelf to keep the air moist and a small lamp 
or electric light bulb below. Keep the temperature around 65 or 
70 degrees for sponge standing overnight and at 85 degrees for 
dough after it has been kneaded in the morning. If the bread 



LABOE-SAVING DEVICES 257 

is made in the quick way, that is, if the sponge is set in the 
morning, have the temperature of the box 85 degrees. 

Turning the flame of the lamp up or down or placing cold or 
hot water in the pan on the second shelf changes the temperature 
if one wishes to do so. 

Bread Mixer 

A bread mixer in which the dough can be kneaded in 3 minutes 
by turning a crank instead of 15 minutes by hand is a valuable 
labor saver. This device consists of a bucket-like utensil with a 
curved, dull blade which is turned by a handle. This mixes the 
sponge and kneads the bread. The sponge and dough can be 
allowed to rise in it and with its use any member of the family 
can knead the dough just as well as the homemaker can. In 
buying a mixer the amount of dough to be kneaded in it should 
be taken into consideration. If large batches of bread are made 
at a time, a large mixer is desirable, while if small bakings are 
made, a small one gives better results. It is impossible for a 
huge mixer to knead dough for one or two loaves efficiently. 

Cake Mixers 

Cake mixers are constructed much the same as bread mixers 
only they are smaller in size. There is an electric cake mixer 
which may be used in stirring up one cake, but those turned by 
hand are especially adapted to the mixing of more than one cake 
at the same time. 

Self-Heating Irons 

By the use of self -heating irons, many steps between the stove 
and the ironing board are saved. When the house is wired with 
electricity, of course, the electrically heated iron is desirable. 
Irons heated by gasoline, alcohol, kerosene and gas are also 
convenient and they are satisfactory if drafts that might blow 
the flame are avoided. 

Ironing Machines 

There are two kinds of ironing machines, those with heated 
roUs and those with cold rolls. The first kind is made with 
padded and covered rolls or cylinders which revolve against a 



258 THE FAEM COOK AND KULE BOOK 

heated plate or shoe. The padded roll takes the place of the 
ironing board and the heated shoe of the iron. Some ironers 
have special arrangements made for ironing rufSes, but best 
results on the padded rolls are obtained in ironing flat pieces. 
The ironer with cold rolls smoothes out the wrinkles by heavy- 
pressure. Ironing machines are operated by hand or electricity 
and the rolls are heated by gasoline, gas or electricity. 

Vacuum Cleaners 

Vacuum cleaners suck up fine dust and dirt on and in carpets 
and rugs. Many of the cleaners also have brushes which take up 
lint, thread and all types of coarse dirt. The dust and dirt is 
forced by the suction into a bag so that practically no dust is 
scattered about the room. As a rule the best vacuum cleaners 
are run by electricity or motor, although the hand cleaners which 
are not too heavy to be used with ease are very good. 

Carpet Sweepers 

Most carpet sweepers remove the surface dirt and dust on rugs 
and carpets. There are a few hand-power sweepers, which are in 
reality a combination of the sweeper and the vacuum cleaner, 
that suck up some of the dust as well as removing the surface 
dirt. 

Long-handled Dust Pan 

If a long-handled dust pan is used, it is not necessary for the 
housewife to stoop when sweeping the collected dirt into the pan. 
An excellent type is the one which has a lid that closes auto- 
matically as the pan is lifted. This keeps the dirt from being 
spilled or falling out. 

Wall Brushes 

Much climbing and stretching is avoided in cleaning the 
ceilings and w^alls by the use of long-handled wall brushes. The 
brush part may be of fine bristles which are soft, lamb's wool or 
loops of soft cotton twine. When such a brush is not available, 
the best substitute is a cotton flannel bag slipped over the bristles 
of the broom. Care must be taken not to scratch the walls with 
the bristles, that is, not to exert too much pressure on the broom. 



LABOK-SAVING DEVICES 259 

Floor Mops 

For washing a floor the ordinar}^ mop handle with a loosely- 
woven piece of cloth fastened in it is satisfactory. A dust mop 
for removing the fine particles of dust from the floors saves one 
from bending over to wipe up dusty patches. Some of these are 
constructed with soft bristles and others with loops of soft cotton 
twine which will reach the corners and remove the dust from 
them. Sometimes a soft cloth moistened slightly with liquid 
wax or oil is tied over the dust mop and rubbed over the floor to 
brighten the finish. Care needs to be taken never to apply too 
much wax or floor oil since they leave a surface which collects 
dust and dirt, and not to use oil and wax on the same floor. 
They will not mix. 

When the floors of several rooms must be waxed, a weighted 
brush with short bristles is used. This rubs in the paste wax and 
polishes the wood. Such a brush should never be used on an 
oiled floor unless it is covered with a heavy piece of flannel. 

Brushes for Cleaning 

There are brushes adapted to the cleaning of practically every 
piece of household equipment. There are stiff-bristled scrub 
brushes for cleaning vegetables, table-tops and other surfaces 
and long-handled scrub brushes for scouring floors. Eadiator 
pipes may be cleaned by the aid of a long-handled and narrow 
brush. A narrow brush with a flexible handle cleanses the drain 
pipe of the refrigerator with the aid of soap suds and hot water. 
Then there are narrow brushes with similar wire handles for use 
in cleaning out bottles, vinegar cruets, and vases. Soft bristles 
clean silverware, stiffer ones remove the soil from sinks, bathtubs 
and lavatories. Phonograph records can scarcely be cleaned with- 
out the use of soft bristles. The homemaker^s hands are pro- 
tected greatly by the use of brushes and the bristles are much 
more efficient in reaching corners and crevices than a piece of 
smooth cloth is. 

Cooking Utensils 

In buying cooking utensils the prudent homemaker considers 
for what they are to be used. Kettles or pans in which vegetables 
are to be boiled are most satisfactory if the cover rests on a 



260 THE FARM COOK AND EULE BOOK 

standard about an inch above the top of the utensil or if the lid 
rests loosely on top. This permits the water to evaporate quickly. 
Much food value is destroyed if large amounts of water in which 
the vegetables are boiled is thrown away. If cooked down, this 
may be served with the vegetable dish. 

The ideal potato kettle is one equipped with a cover which 
strains the contents without danger of spilling the cooked vege- 
table. When this is not available, a strainer which resembles a 
small kettle only that it is perforated and has a long handle is 
satisfactory. 

Cabbage and onions and all other strongly flavored food are 
best cooked in a flaring-sided pan so the water in which they are 
cooked evaporates quickly. No lid is used. Frying requires 
greater heat than other types of cookery so iron and aluminum 
utensils are best for this purpose. 

The most important point in selecting the frying pan is its 
size. The same is true of percolators. It is impossible to make 
2 cupfuls of good coffee in a large percolator. Mixing bowls are 
an essential piece of equipment. Those of enameled ware or 
other light-weight materials are satisfactory. As to shape, the 
deep bowl with a conical bottom is desirable since a small 
amount of food can be dealt with in it as well as a larger amount. 
In other words, the depth gives the capacity so that 8 eggs may 
be beaten in the bowl while the conical bottom permits the 
beating of 1 egg with just as much ease. 

Casseroles are gaining in popularity in American homes. 
These bake dishes may be of china, glass^ aluminum, steel or 
iron. If the china, earthenware and glass casseroles are used, 
the food is not only cooked in them but it also is served in the 
same dish. When the casserole is to be used in hot ovens, the lid 
should contain a small hole through which the boiling liquid 
around the food can escape as it evaporates. With a low oven 
the moisture can be retained so this hole is not necessary. If 
the lid has a hole, it may be filled with a stiff flour paste. 

Glass rolling pins are proving happy additions to kitchen 
cabinets because they can be opened and filled with crushed ice 
or ice water. This makes them cold for making pastry ; one of 
the best assurances that the pie crust will be flaky and tender is 
to have it cold when placed in the oven. 



LABOR-SAVING DEVICES 261 

A set of measuring spoons and two measuring cups, one for the 
liquids and the other for the dry ingredients, make the housewife 
more certain of success with the recipes she tries. She can be 
sure that her measurements are accurate. Long-handled spoons 
with slits in the bowls are useful in mixing foods and a straight- 
edged knife with a flexible blade, the spatula, makes it possible 
to scrape all the scraps of biscuit or cooky dough from the bowl. 

Women who have suifered from burned hands know that the 
consideration of handles is worth while when cooking utensils 
are being purchased. Tea kettles which have handles that stand 
upright and do not move are desirable. If kettles have bail 
handles, these should be easy to move and of a material which 
will not retain heat. If of wire, they should have an extra 
wooden holder in the center. Saucepans have either long or 
short handles; it is best to select those which are of non-heat 
conducting materials. The lips for pouring should be on both 
sides of the saucepan so a left-handed person can pour from 
the utensil with as great ease as a right-handed one. 

Small, but Helpful Equipment 

Apple corers, orange and lemon juice extractors, graters, vege- 
table cutters, potato ricers, a slicer for hard-cooked eggs, nutmeg 
grinders, cream ladles, pie crimpers, stainless steel paring and 
butcher knives, grapefruit knives and the Dunlap cream whipper 
are among the small pieces of kitchen equipment that are helpful. 

Knife Racks 

If sharp knives are kept in a table or cabinet drawer, it is easy 
for one to cut her fingers when getting them or some other 
equipment from the drawers. A rack on the kitchen wall near 
the kitchen table is a satisfactory way of taking care of the 
knives. These racks may be made of wood by taking a number 
of saw kerfs out of soft pine or of stiff wire coiled to resemble a 
pen holder rack. 

Dish Drainer 

It is not only less work to let the dishes dry themselves in a 
drainer than to dry them on a towel but it is also much more 



262 THE FARM COOK AND RULE BOOK 

sanitary. It is almost impossible to keep the dish towel immacu- 
late all the time. 

A satisfactory drainer may be made in the home. For this an 
ordinary large bread or biscuit pan is used. In this rests the rack 
for the dishes. This is made from No. 14 wire which is bent 
into the proper shape for holding the dishes. This rack must fit 
in the pan and hold the dishes out of the water which is poured 
over them for scalding. The silver may be placed in a tin can 
with holes in the bottom or in a nest of poultry netting that 
resembles a small bucket. 

The washed dishes are stacked in the rack and hot water 
poured over them. When they are dry, they are placed in the 
cupboard and the water in the pan is emptied. If one has a sink 
and drainboard, the rack may be placed on the drainboard and no 
pan used under it. 

Wheeled Tray 

The wheeled tray may be used in taking dishes and food to 
and fro from work table to the stove and from the kitchen to the 
dining room. They may be purchased at a furniture store, or a 
table on wheels may be used. A wheeled serving table may be 
made by placing wheels on an old washstand. 

Food Grinders Made Useful 

As a meat chopper, the food grinder is used less than it is any 
other way, simply because butchering time does not come more 
frequently. Stale bread can be ground quickly for use in pud- 
dings, scalloped dishes and other combinations. Vegetables for 
soup may be chopped more quickly than they can be cut. Sand- 
wich fillings cease to worry when ground in a food grinder and 
they spread easily. Raisins, nuts, fruits, cocoanut and practically 
all dried fruits may be ground in the chopper. Peanut butter 
may be made in it. 

Powdered sugar which contains lumps causes little delay 
on baking day if the grinder is near by. The cabbage, celery, 
onion or other vegetables for salad can be chopped quickly. 
Horseradish and cheese may be ground. And beaten biscuits are 
not difficult to make if the dough is placed through the chopper 
several times. 



LABOR-SAVIIS^G DEVICES 263 

Apples may be ground so the apple sauce will cook rapidly. 
Instead of bothering to put cranberries through a sieve to remove 
the skins, they may be ground in the chopper before being 
cooked. Quince honey may be made with ease if the quinces are 
ground instead of being grated or cut. Lemons and oranges for 
use in marmalade may be put through the grinder. It is an 
economy to grind foods that must be cut or chopped for much 
energy and time is saved. 

Narrow Shelves between Wide Ones 

When cupboard or pantry space is limited, narrow shelves 
may be placed between the wide ones to hold cups, tiny pitchers, 
salt and pepper shakers, spices and other small articles. 

Rolling Cloth 

Instead of spending time washing the bread board after rolling 
out bread, cooky, biscuit and other doughs, it may be covered 
with a piece of heavy white duck or canvas fastened down with 
thumb tacks. This may be folded up and kept in a drawer when 
not in use. It is more sanitary than the board and it may be 
washed with greater ease. 

Vacuum Bottles and Pitchers 

The vacuum bottle has an inner container with heavy walls 
and a tightly fitting lid. In this the beverage is poured. The 
outer covering of the bottle also has a heavy wall ; between it and 
the outer wall of the beverage container is an air space. This 
insulation makes it impossible for the cold or the heat of the 
beverage to get out into the room and for the heat or cold of the 
room to get into the bottle. The iced lemonade or hot coffee will 
retain its temperature several hours if placed in a vacuum pitcher 
or bottle. The pitcher differs from the bottle in that it has a 
spout which makes it easier to pour the beverage at the table. 

Vacuum Pails 

The vacuum pail is constructed like the vacuum bottle only it 
is much larger. It frequently holds a gallon or more. It is fine 



264 THE FARM COOK AND RULE BOOK 

for use in taking a cold drink to the field in the hot weather or a 
hot one in the winter. 

Electrical Appliances 

Among the electrical household appliances which are helpful 
are toasters, ovenettes, table stoves^ waffle irons, egg beaters, 
irons, heaters, curling irons, bottle warmers, bed warmers, fire- 
less cookers with electrically heated discs, coffee percolators, tea 
pots and tea kettles. 

Canning Outfits 

Perhaps the simplest type of canner is the water-bath. This 
consists of any utensil large enough to hold several fruit jars, 
fitted with a lid and a false bottom which holds the jars away 
from the bottom of the container, protecting them from over- 
heating and hitting together and allowing free circulation of the 
water underneath. These canners may be purchased or one may 
be made at home. The wash boiler or a small tub with a cover 
make excellent vessels for the water-bath. A false bottom must 
be made. This may be fashioned from narrow slats to form a 
little platform or of strong wire netting fastened on a wood 
frame. If this has handles which may be used in removing the 
cans from the water-bath, it is more convenient. 

Then there is the water-seal canner which has a double walled 
bath and a cover which extends down into the water between 
the two walls, making a third wall and two jackets of water 
between the compartment holding the jars and the outer wall. 
The advantage of this canner is that it takes less water to 
manipulate it and since there is less, not so much fuel is required 
to heat it as the larger amount in the water-bath outfits. 

Next to the water-bath in popularity is the steam pressure 
canner, which may be a pressure cooker which has been described 
in this chapter. A pressure canner does not differ much, if any, 
in construction from a pressure cooker, but it usually is much 
larger so more cans of food may be sterilized at the same time. 

Making a Table Pad 

An inexpensive pad for use in protecting the table top from 
hot dishes may be made from wall board. Saw this into four 
pieces, the size and shape depending on the table top. For a 



LABOR-SAYING DEVICES 265 

round table, saw the wall board into four pie-shaped pieces which 
fit together. Cover with white cotton flannel and the pad is just 
as satisfactory as if it were of the more costly asbestos. 

Caring for Floors 

If the paint, varnish or other floor finish is worn and ugly in 
appearance, it is an economy of time and energy to refinish it. 
Its care will be made so much easier if this is done. If varnish 
remover is applied with a brush, the old finish will soften so 
that it may be scraped off with a wide piece of glass or any broad 
spatula tool. Then the floor is cleaned and left to dry. 

The next requirement is a filler. For this equal parts of 
turpentine and linseed oil to which sufficient Japan dryer is 
added to make the mixture dry overnight may be used. For soft 
wood floors, such as maple and pine, a little umber may be 
added to stain the wood. Before applying this filler to the 
wood, it is a good plan to apply a little on boards of the same 
wood as the floor, making certain that the color is right and that 
enough Japan dryer has been added so that thf. finish will dry 
overnight. 

When the filler is applied and is dry, paste wax may be added 
to provide a glossy, beautiful surface, to repel the dust and dirt 
and to protect the wood. This is rubbed into the wood and best 
results are obtained if a weighted wax mop is used. A way to 
make a substitute mop is to fasten a brick on top of a large 
scrub brush and to attach a handle on this. 

Waxed floors may be cleaned easily. A daily dusting with a 
dustless mop removes the fine particles of dust. This mop is 
kept clean a long time if a clean cloth is tied over it every time 
it is used. Liquid wax is sprinkled on the cloth about once a 
month to help keep the floors attractive and paste wax is added 
two or three times a year. 

If the floor is painted, it may be waxed, but if varnished, wax 
is not so satisfactory. Instead of using it, a little floor oil may 
be sprinkled on the mop occasionally when dusting the floor. 

Homemade Shower Bath 

If there is no space in the house for the shower bath for 
summer use, it may be made on the back porch and screened off 



266 THE FAEM COOK AND RULE BOOK 

with curtains of canvas or heavy iinbleached muslin. A bucket 
holding 4 gallons of water is needed to hold the water. A hole is 
cut in the bottom of this and a piece of pipe 4 inches long is 
soldered in this opening. Rubber tubing 4 to 6 feet long is 
attached to this pipe and a shower head, which may be purchased 
for fifteen cents, or a sprinkler from a watering can, is fastened 
into the end of the tube. 

The bucket is raised and lowered by the use of a pulley and 
rope fastened with a staple to a joist in the ceiling. The end of 
the rope is looped over a hook in the wall. A clothespin makes a 
good stop-cock for the tubing. 

About 21/2 gallons of water are required for the shower. The 
person stands in a tub placed under the shower. One or two 
coats of white enamel make the outfit more attractive. 

Making an Ironing Board Cover 

A cover for the ironing board which is easily adjusted is made 
in the following way: hem unbleached muslin of the required 
length and width, allowing a turn of 4 inches on the sides. 
Make 8 buttonholes, 4 in each side. Then use 8 strong safety 
pins fastened through these holes and to 4 pieces of narrow 
elastic. Six inch lengths of elastic are satisfactory. This 
ironing board cover does not wrinkle as long as the elastic is 
good. 

Sewing l^chines 

Sewing machines operated by electric motors are a great 
convenience in homes where electricity is available. All machines 
prove to their operators that good care pays. The use of good 
machine oil wherever there is friction is essential. If a poor 
grade of oil has been applied by mistake, it can be removed by 
the use of kerosene. Oil the machine with kerosene. Wipe off 
the surplus oil that forms when the machine is run a few minutes 
with the needle unthreaded. Then apply good oil. 

If the machine needle is dull, it may be sharpened for tem- 
porary use by stitching a few inches through fine sandpaper. 
To keep the needle from unthreading when cloth is removed, 
raise it up to the highest point before taking out the cloth. 

When the cloth puckers, it is a sign that the tension is too 



LABOE-SAYING DEVICES 267 

tight or that there is not enough pressure on the pressure foot. 
Very thin materials frequently need to have a layer of paper 
under them when being stitched. 

Skipped stitches are usually the result of a bent needle, an 
incorrectly set needle or the use of too coarse thread. The needle 
will last longer if the thread is pulled backward under the 
pressure foot when cloth is removed. Pulling the thread forward 
frequently bends the needle. 

Baby's Summer Nest 

A convenient bed for the small baby may be made from wood 
and screen. The right dimensions for such a crib are 4 feet or 
more long, 3 feet wide and 3 feet deep. The frame is of wood 
and the sides and top are covered with screen. Either screen or 
canvas may be used for the bottom. The top is fastened on with 
hinges and casters under the legs make it easier to move the 
little bed. A mattress will make the nest soft. Baby will not 
only find protection from flies in this little bed, but since he can- 
not get out, he also is made safe from other dangers. If the 
wooden frame is painted and enameled white, the crib is much 
more attractive. 

The Kitchen Stool 

Much energy is saved if the housewife sits down on a high 
stool while ironing, washing dishes, stirring up the cake batter, 
paring potatoes and attending to other household duties. If a 
hole is made through the top of this stool through which the 
finger may be placed, it is easy to carry this device from one part 
of the room to another. 

Prop for Sick Person 

An ordinary kitchen chair placed back down at the head of the 
bed supplies a support for the pillow against which the patient 
may lean. This makes it much easier for an ill person to sit up 
in bed. 



CHAPTER 4 
GRANDMOTHER'S BEAUTY SECRETS 

Cucumber Cream 

To soothe an inflamed skin or to soften a dry one, cucumber 
cream may be used. Take 2 cucumbers that are ripe and yellow, 
wash thoroughly and cut in thin slices. Place in a saucepan 
and add barely enough cold water to cover. Simmer gently until 
the mass is soft and mushy. Rub through a fine sieve and strain 
through a cloth. To every 3 ounces of cucumber juice add 3 
ounces of almond oil and y? ounce of white wax. Heat until all 
the ingredients are melted. Then beat the mixture until it 
becomes cold^ adding a few drops of tincture of benzoin during 
the beating. 

Strawberry Lotion 

For whitening the 'skin this lotion is excellent. Crush ripe 
strawberries in a saucepan to extract the juice and boil them 
5 minutes, mashing them with a spoon during the cooking. 
Strain off the juice and cool. Measure and mix 1 part of alcohol 
with 2 parts of strawberry juice. Bottle and use a very little 
to remove tan or yellowness from the skin. 

Fresh Berry Lotion 

Mash % cupful of ripe strawberries and add the same amount 
of cold water. Before retiring and after the face, neck and arms 
have been washed, apply the strawberry mixture to the skin. 
When washed o£E in the mornings the skin will be more nearly 
white. 

Lettuce Cream 

A cream which serves for a bleach and a healing lotion is 
made from lettuce. Select large lettuce leaves and cover them 

268 



GEAXDMOTHEE'S BEAUTY SECEETS 269 

T\ith boiling water. Let stand 30 minutes; then pour off the 
water and pound the lettuce with a potato masher. Strain 
through a fine sieve. Then melt 1 ounce of white wax, 1 ounce of 
spermacetti and 4 ounces of almond oil in a double boiler or over 
water. The mixture should not boil, but just melt. Eemove 
from the stove and add drop by drop the lettuce juice, beating 
the mixture constantly with a fork until the cream is smooth, 
light and cold. 

Preventing Wrinkles 

If strawberries are ripe, they may be combined with cream to 
be used on the face to prevent wrinkles. Mash 6 large and ripe 
berries and add an equal amount of heavy cream. Pat this on 
the face with the finger tips, applying it liberally under the eyes 
and other places where wrinkles are likely to come. 

Lemon Bleach 

Squeeze the juice of two lemons in 1 cupful of water and wash 
the face with this two times daily to remove freckles. If one 
wishes, the lemon juice may be stirred into as much sugar as it 
will hold and this is rubbed on the face. 



Horseradish Bleach 

Select a medium-sized horseradish root and grate very fine. 
Cover with fresh buttermilk and let stand overnight. Strain 
through fine muslin and bottle the liquid. Wash the face with 
this night and morning for a bleach. 

Milk Remedies 

Washing the face daily with milk helps to soften, whiten and 
to make the skin smooth. Buttermilk is effective in remedying 
acne or removing pimples and it has a tendency to remove freck- 
les. Sweet cream may be used as a cure for chapped hands and 
lips, and for sunburn. If the skin is broken out slightly, the 
addition of a little grated horseradish or flowers of sulphur to 
the milk is helpful. These preparations are made immediately 
before being used since they do not keep well. 



270 THE FAKM COOK AND EULE BOOK 

For Excessive Perspiration 

If a few tablespoonfuls of baking soda are placed in the bath_, 
the water will be softened and much of the discomfort from 
excessive perspiration will be overcome. The baking soda may 
be sprinkled on the body just as talcum powder is. 

Hand Astringent 

For hands that are moist most of the time, frequent baths in 
salt water usually will check the excessive perspiration. If this 
fails, the hands may be washed occasionally in 1 cupful of water 
to which the juice of a lemon has been added. 

For Hard Hands 

Eub oatmeal on the hands after they have been washed. This 
cleanses and softens the skin. Cornmeal may be used instead of 
the oatmeal. A good cleanser is made by mixing 1 tablespoonf ul 
of powdered borax with 1 pint of cornmeal. 

Honey for the Hands 

For chapped hands rub honey on them. Put on gloves and 
leave the honey on all night. In the morning wash in bran 
water. 

Bran Water 

Boil a cupful of bran in a muslin bag. Put both the bran bag 
and the liquid in which it cooked in the wash bowl and wash the 
hands. When dry, rub a little honey on them. This is excellent 
treatment for rough, red skins. 

Honey Mask 

Dilute honey a little with water and rub on the face before 
retiring. This mask helps to prevent wrinkles and to soften the 
skin. 

Potato Mask 

For the oily skin which is subject to blackheads the potato 
mask is a joy. Wash the potato thoroughly and cut it in slices. 



GRANDMOTHER'S BEAUTY SECRETS 271 

Rub these over the skin. It removes the oil, cleanses the pores 
and whitens the skin. 

Glycerin Wash 

For skin irritations, itching or redness the addition of 1 ounce 
of glycerin to 19 ounces of soft water makes an excellent face 
wash. 

Oatmeal Wash 

Boil 1 pint of Scotch oatmeal in 2 pints of boiling water until 
a clear liquid is formed. Use a double boiler for this purpose. 
Strain the liquid through a piece of fine muslin, boil and strain 
again. Add sufficient rose water to give the liquid the con- 
sistency of milk. If one wishes, a few drops of perfume may be 
added before the liquid is bottled. 

Onion Tonic 

For very thin hair, cut an onion in halves and rub the scalp 
with these vigorously before retiring at night. The juice of 
onions invigorates the roots of the hair. 

Egg Shampoo 

Beat 2 eggs together lightly and rub into the scalp and 
through the hair which has been moistened with lukewarm 
water. Rinse out the egg with lukewarm water to which a little 
melted castile soap has been added. Then rinse in two or three 
clear lukewarm waters. 

For Dandruff 

Saturate fhe scalp every night with sulphur water which is 
made by dissolving 1 ounce flowers of sulphur in 1 quart of 
water. Shake every now and then while the sulphur is dis- 
solving. Let the solution stand until it settles and use only the 
clear liquid. 

Skin Tonic 

After cleansing the skin, apply a tonic to give a freshened 
appearance. This is made by combining 1 part witchhazel with 



272 THE FARM COOK AND RULE BOOK 

2 parts Florida water. If the skin is very oily, use equal parts of 
witchhazel and Florida water. 

For Blackheads 

Rub pure lard on the blackheads and let stand 5 or 10 
minutes. Then wipe off gently with soft cloth and rub a cake 
of a mild soap, wet in water, on the surface. Wash off with 
warm water. 

Ann and Hand Bleach 

Beat 1 egg yolk until light and add 20 drops tincture of 
benzoin, i/^ ounce glycerin, I/2 ounce rose water, 1 teaspoonful 
olive oil and enough flour to thicken or to make a soft paste. 
Cover the arms with this at night and wrap them with soft 
cloth. Wash off in the morning and repeat the process until the 
skin is smooth and white. 

Keeping Hair in Curl 

Before doing the hair up on curlers moisten it with a mixture 
made by beating the white of an egg until light and adding to 
this 1/4 cupful of cold water and 1 teaspoonful of sugar. 

For Wrinkles 

By combining 2 drams of butter, 2 drams of essence of tur- 
pentine and 1 dram of mastic, a cream is made which prevents 
wrinkles. 

Almond Wash 

Mash 4 ounces of sweet blanched almonds and rub until very 
fine and add 24 ounces of rose water. In another saucepan mix 
4 drams each of white wax^ castile or other pure soap and oil of 
almonds, 30 drops oil of lavender and 16 drops of attar of roses. 
Heat gently and combine the two mixtures by beating with an 
egg beater. Strain. 

Milk of Almonds 

To soften and nourish the skin use milk of almonds. Put 2 
oimces of sweet almonds, the thin shell variety usually found on 



GRANDMOTHER'S BEAUTY SECRETS 273 

the market, through a food grinder. Mash thoroughly and add 
2 cupfuls of clean soft water which has been boiled and cooled. 
Mix and rub "until a milky emulsion is made. Then strain 
through muslin. A few drops of perfume may be added if one 
wishes. Wash the face with this liquid. 

Complexion Sachets 

Combine 1 teaspoonful of flaxseed with an equal amount of 
bran and place in a tiny muslin bag. Moisten with water and 
apply to pimples and blackheads. Allow to remain on about 
5 minutes, then remove and squeeze out the blackhead or the 
matter from the pimple. Pat the surface with very cold water. 

Hand Wash 

Combine 2 ounces glycerin, the juice of 2 lemons, 2 table- 
spocnfuls of water and a few drops of carbolic acid. Bottle and 
shake. Use on the hands after they have been washed. 

After Dish Washing 

Make a paste by moistening 1 cupful of cornmeal with vinegar. 
Use this in cleansing the hands after dish washing instead of 
soap. This keeps the skin soft and white. 

For Oily Hair 

Beat the white of an egg as stiff as possible. Rub it into the 
hair until the locks are wet. Let dry and then brush out. 

Dry Cleaning" the Hair Brush 

Mix together equal amounts of salt and flour and rub through 
the brush. Comb out. 



To Remove Onion Odor from Breath 

A cupful of strong coffee will remove onion odors from the 
breath. 



274 THE FAEM COOK AND RULE BOOK 

To Soften Bath Water 

Fill tiny bags of cheesecloth with crystals of sequi carbonate, 
using about 3 tablespoonfuls to a bag. This prevents a dry and 
itchy feeling that the skin sometimes has after bathing. 

For Sunburn 

If encumbers are seasonable, select a ripe one and cut a slice 
from it. Eub this over the burned skin. This is cooling and 
soothing. 

To Whiten Teeth 

Kub crushed strawberries on the teeth before retiring. 

Grandmother's Complexion Clearer 

A fig paste which grandmother made to keep the complexion 
clear is one with a laxative effect. In addition it is good to eat. 
Chop 1 cupful of figs, 1 cupful of raisins and 1 ounce of senna 
leaves together. Add 1 cupful of water and 3 tablespoonfuls of 
sugar. Cook gently until a paste is made. Add 14 teaspoonful 
of lemon juice and remove the mixture from the fire. Cut in 
1 inch squares when cool and eat one before retiring. 

About Dieting" 

The foods which help a thin person to gain in weight are 
butter, cream, whole milk, eggs and olive oil. Eggnogs are fine. 
Vegetables should be served with butter or rich cream sauces 
and an abundance of cream may be used on the dessert. 

Fat persons should eat less butter, cream, bacon, pastry, cake 
and all kinds of sweets and starches if they wish to lose weight. 
A liberal use of fruits and green vegetables is desirable, but the 
vegetables should be served with very little, if any, butter and no 
cream. 

Other foods which fat persons should eat very sparingly and 
in w^hich thin ones may indulge are candies, ice creams, griddle- 
cakes with syrup, breakfast cereals with cream and rich pud- 
dings. Fat persons should also avoid macaroni, rice and large 
quantities of biscuits and bread. Some potato may be eaten 



GRANDMOTHEE'S BEAUTY SECRETS 275 

because it is filling and a slice of bread at cTery meal is not 
objectionable, especially if it is not buttered. Skim milk should 
be used instead of cream whenever possible and an egg for break- 
fast is all right. Salad dressings for fat persons should be of the 
boiled variety while thin folks wishing to put on weight will 
find the dressings with olive oil as a foundation helpful. 

Since every red blood corpuscle must contain iron, foods rich 
in this substance help to keep one in good health and to give 
one rosy cheeks and red lips. Foods containing much iron are 
spinach, cabbage, lean beef, egg yolks, raisins, prunes and most 
fruits. Milk is very wholesome. Every person requires about 
2 cupfuls a day, thin persons whole milk and fat ones skim 
milk. As a protection against scurv}^ some fresh food should 
be included in the meals every day. Oranges, tomatoes, raw 
cabbage, lettuce and raw carrots are valuable for this purpose. 
As a rule, a tonic will not be needed in the spring if there has 
been an abundance of fruit, vegetables and milk in the winter 
diet. The use of too much fat meat should be avoided by every- 
one, and the fat person should eat practically none of it. 



CHAPTER 5 
COOKING FOE THE SICK 

Since persons who are ill frequently are not hungry, it requires 
skill to prepare food to cater to their appetites, as every mother 
knows. Cleanliness of food, dishes and tray is essential. Neat 
service is helpful and broken or cracked dishes are not per- 
missible. Only an excellent quality of food simply prepared 
should be used. If a dish is supposed to be hot, serve it that 
way, not as a lukewarm combination, and if frozen desserts are 
on the menu, they should reach the patient without melting. 

An attractive tray stimulates the appetite. Pretty dishes, 
artistically molded puddings, a tiny spray of flowers or ferns in 
a small vase, a joke or quotation from a current magazine or a 
fancy garnish on one of the dishes will help put the patient in a 
happy frame of mind so he will forget himself and eat more 
heartily than he otherwise would. 

Children are especially appreciative when their food is served 
in an unique way. If oatmeal will not be eaten from a bowl, it 
frequently is relished if served in a flower pot. A tiny pot 
covered with gay crepe paper is used. In it the glass containing 
the oatmeal and milk or cream is set. A flower is inserted in 
the pot. 

A banana boat is equally enticing. This consists of an empty 
banana skin lined with oiled paper and filled with food. Tooth- 
picks are used for oars. A pig made from a hollow lemon with 
toothpicks for legs and cloves for its features delights sick 
children. If this is filled with a frozen ice which may be sipped 
through a straw, it is indeed enticing. Baskets may be fash- 
ioned from empty oranges and grapefruits lined with oiled 
paper. Toast hollowed out to hold scrambled eggs may repre- 
sent a nest and bread cut in fancy shapes with cooky cutters and 
toasted usually wins approval. 

276 



COOKIXG FOE THE SICK 277 

The recipes given in this chapter are suitable for use in cater- 
ing to the invalid's appetite. If a doctor is attending the ill 
person, it is advisable for the homemaker to suggest to the 
physician some of the dishes she wishes to prepare. This fre- 
quently is helpful to the doctor who may not have time to work 
out the menu as carefully as the housemother does. 

Rice Water 

2 tablespoonfuls rice 3 cupfuls cold water 

% teaspoonful salt 

Wash the rice thoroughly. Soak 30 minutes in the cold water, 
heat gradually to the boiling point and let boil until soft. 
Strain, reheat, season with salt, and if too thick, dilute with 
boiling water. 

Beef Juice 

Cut round steak into small portions or grind in a food chop- 
per. Place in a double boiler and add a little salt. Let stand 30 
minutes and then gradually heat, keeping the meat below the 
boiling point. Squeeze out the juice and serve either hot or 
cold. One pound of meat will make about % cupful of the 
juice. 

Fluffy Lemonade 

Eoll 1 lemon until soft and remove the juice, excluding the 
seeds. Add 2 tablespoonfuls of sugar, 1 cupful of water and 
1 tablespoonful of crushed ice. Just before serving add ^4 tea- 
spoonful of soda. 

Toast Water 

Take a thick slice of bread and cut into small cubes. Brown 
in the oven, sprinkle with I/4 teaspoonful of salt and add 1 cupful 
of hot water. Cover and let stand until cool. Strain and serve 
hot or cold. 

Beef Tea 

Wipe 1 pound of lean beef with a clean cloth moistened in 
water, cut in tiny cubes and place in a quart fruit jar. Add 2 
cupfuls of cold water and % teaspoonful of salt. Then set the 



278 THE FARM COOK AND RULE BOOK 

jar on the back part of the stove in a kettle of cold water and 
bring the water gradually to the boiling point. Strain and serve 
while hot. Sometimes this beef tea is frozen before being served. 

Coffee with Egg 

Beat the yolk of an egg until light and add to it % cupful of 
hof milk and % cupful of hot coffee. 

Slippery-Elm Tea 

Steep about 2 ounces of slippery-elm bark in 1 cupful of boil- 
ing water 30 minutes. Strain and add 3 teaspoonfuls of sugar 
and 1 teaspoonful of lemon juice. Serve hot or cold. If slippery- 
elm powder is used, dissolve 2 teaspoonfuls of it in the hot water. 

Wholesome Broth 

Beat 1 egg with % teaspoonful of sugar until the mixture is 
very light. Add 2 cupfuls of hot milk or boiling water and % 
teaspoonful of salt. Serve immediately. 

Grandmother's Eggnog 

Beat 1 egg yolk and 1 tablespoonf ul of sugar together until the 
mixture is light. Add 1 cupful of milk, 1 teaspoonful of vanilla 
and the stiffly beaten white of 1 egg. Pour over 2 tablespoonfuls 
of crushed ice and serve. If hot eggnog is desired, omit the egg 
white and heat the milk. 

Coffee Delicious 

Place 1 tablespoonful of finely ground coffee in % cupful of 
cold water and bring to the boiling point. Let stand 5 minutes, 
strain and add % cupful of hot milk. Serve at once with sugar 
if sweetening is desired. 

Scalloped Egg 

Mix 2 tablespoonfuls of cream, 2 tablespoonfuls of fine bread 
crumbs and 14 teaspoonful of salt together. Butter an egg cup 
and place one-half the mixture in it. Break 1 egg on top of this 



COOKIXG FOR THE SICK 279 

and cover with the rest of the crumb mixture. Bake 5 minutes in 
a moderate oven. Garnish with strips of bread and butter or 
buttered toast.
