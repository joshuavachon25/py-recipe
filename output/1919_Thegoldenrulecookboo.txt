INTRODUCTION 



L HE arranging of this help for those who are seeking to 
obey the call to a higher humanitarianism, which is put 
forth by non-flesh-eating men and women, has been a 
labour of love: the labour, the result of an earnest en- 
deavour to so write the receipts that "the way-faring 
woman may not err therein," the love, of a kind whose 
integrity may not be questioned, since it has inspired to 
the never easy task of going against the stream of habit 
and custom, and to individual effort in behalf of the 
myriads of gentle and amenable creatures, which an an- 
imality that defiles the use of the word has accustomed 
man to killing and eating. 

The name Vegetarian has come to mean one who 
abstains from animal flesh as food ; and, as some designa- 
tion is necessary, it is perhaps a sufficiently suitable one. 
This term did not, however, originally classify those 
who used a bloodless diet, but is derived from the Latin 
Homo Vegitus, which words described to the Romans a 
strong, vigorous man. The definition of the word Vegi- 
tus, as given in Thomas Holyoke's Latin Dictionary, is 
"whole, sound, quick, fresh, lively, lusty, gallant, trim, 
brave," and of Vegito, "to refresh, to re-create." Profes- 
sor Mayor of England adds to these definitions: "The 
word Vegetarian belongs to an illustrious family; veg- 
etable, which has been called its mother, is really its 
niece." 



12 Golden Rule Cook-Book 

The word has unfortunately become intermingled with 
various dietetic theories, but the Vegetarian who is one 
because his conscience for one reason or another condemns 
the eating of flesh, occupies a very different place in the 
world of ethics from one who is simply refraining from 
meat eating in an effort to cure bodily ills. 

Indeed, the dyspeptic frequenting the usual Vegetarian 
restaurant has little opportunity to know much about 
vegetables as food, the menu being, as a rule, so crowded 
with various mixtures which are supposedly "meat sub- 
stitutes " that vegetables pure and simple find small place. 
This book contains no meat substitutes, as such, but 
receipts for the palatable preparation of what is called by 
many "live foods," â€” that is, food which has no blood to 
shed and does not, therefore, become dead before it can 
be eaten. 

There will also be found lacking from the index such 
dishes as "Vegetarian Hamburg Steak," "Pigeon Pie, 
Vegetarian style," etc., which should repel rather than 
attract, by bringing to mind what Bernard Shaw has 
graphically spoken of as "scorched carcasses." 

It has been proven by myself and my household that 
flesh eating may be safely stopped in one day with no 
injury to health or strength, and that a table supplied 
from the receipts in this book can make those whom it 
furnishes with food well and strong as far as food can 
make them so. 

There are many reasons why thoughtful, cleanly, 
humane people should not feed upon animals, but there 
is a surprising deafness to this fact shown by the ma- 
jority of those active in humane charities. One mar- 
vels to see hundreds of consecrated workers in session, 
putting forth every effort for the enacting of laws for the 



Introduction 1 3 



amelioration of the sufferings of cattle travelling to 
slaughter by car and ship, who are still content to patronise 
the butcher shop to buy food supplied by the dead bodies 
of these tortured victims of a false appetite. Mere 
thoughtlessness can make the kindest act cruelly incon- 
sistent, for I once saw a woman presiding at a meeting 
held to discountenance the wearing of aigrettes with a 
sheaf of them decorating her bonnet. This looks much 
like receiving stolen goods while denouncing theft. 

It is well to write, and legislate, and pray for better and 
kinder treatment of these frightened, thirst-maddened, 
tortured creatures on their journey to our tables, but the 
surest, quickest way to help (and this can be done even 
while continuing to work for the alleviation of their 
sufferings) is to stop feeding upon them. 

In a recent issue of a paper devoted to humane matters 
there is an indignant protest against the sufferings en- 
dured by crated chickens in a certain market, and another 
article deplores the cruelty shown to turtles in the same 
place, but when we know the writers of these protests to 
be still willing to use these creatures on their tables, it is 
not always easy to fully credit their tender-heartedness. 
In another such paper there appear from year to year 
sentimental pictures and poems extolling the kindliness 
and virtues of "the cattle upon a thousand hills," while 
those same pages print instructions on the most humane 
way of slaying them, giving as a reason for the sudden 
and painless death described that suffering "poisons the 
meat." 

The favourite phrase, "our four-footed friends," seems 
rather an anachronism in the face of our acknowledged 
relations to them as eater and eaten, for the phrase in- 
dicates a mutual pact of friendship, which, however well 



14 Golden Rule Cook-Book 

sustained by them, is dishonoured by man ; for even canni- 
bals, we are told, sink no lower than to eat their foes. 

The demand for butcher's meat may not seem materially 
lessened because I do not eat it, but it is lessened notwith- 
standing, and I rejoice to know that in the past seven 
years my abstinence from flesh must have resulted in a 
little less slaughter, and I am glad to have reduced by 
even one drop the depth of that ocean of blood. I have 
heard the Biblical statement that man was to have 
dominion over all the earth quoted as a justification for 
the eating of the lower animals. We will some day be so 
civilised that we will recognise the great truth that 
dominion implies care, and guardianship, and protection 
rather than tne right to destroy. 

The first objection voiced against Vegetarianism is not 
usually against its principle, but its practice ; we are told 
that the refusal to eat meat causes inconvenience, and that 
it is best to "eat what is set before you, asking no questions 
for conscience's sake." I could respect the position of 
one who literally believed and consistently acted on this 
mandate, but where in Christendom can he be found? 
Few of us could or would eat the flesh of a pet lamb, or 
partake knowingly of horse flesh, or could or would feel 
called upon to dine on these lines with the peoples who 
eat dog, or with so-called cannibals. The host might 
have secured, in a broad spirit of hospitality, just the 
particular carcass which most pleased his own palate, but 
courtesy seldom forces us to eat any flesh other than the 
sorts to which our own habits have accustomed us. 

There is a well-known story of an American statesman 
who was reared by Vegetarian parents in the country, and 
taken while still a small boy to dine at a neighbour's. 
During the progress of the meal a large platter was borne 



Introduction 1 5 



into the room, on which lay something the Uke of which 
he had not seen on any table. He stared in wonder, and 
finally located the resemblance and shouted, "Why, 
mother, if that is n't a dead hen ! " Habit had not over- 
come his horror of that particular dead thing as food, as 
it would have done had he seen dead hens served as food 
all his life. 

As to the inconvenience caused my friends when I am 
at their tables, I consider it of such small consequence 
compared to the fact that even one child should be stand- 
ing almost knee-deep in blood in some slaughter-house, 
working to supply my wants, that it is not worth a second 
thought. No one need go hungry from any well-planned 
dinner, even though no extra preparation has been made 
for the non-meat-eating guest ; but if my hostess knows in 
advance that I do not eat meat, and wishes to have pre- 
pared an especial dish, I give her the benefit of the doubt, 
and believe that she is as pleased to do it as I would be 
in her place. We like to take a little extra trouble to 
entertain our friends, and the thought expended to give 
others pleasure is perhaps the real joy of hospitality. 

Another class of objector likes to remind us that we 
take life when we eat vegetables, or drink, or breathe. A 
friend, who has since ceased to consider the unnecessary 
and cruel slaughtering of thousands of creatures daily a 
fit subject for joking, once sent me in raillery a sonnet 
which rehearsed the sad death suffered by a cabbage to 
satisfy a Vegetarian's selfish cravings. I find no qualms 
in my own conscience on this subject, but should I ever 
come to feel as these over-sensitive claim I should, I hope 
I will not then eat even the "innocent cabbage." 

Again, if the germs in the water we drink and the air 
we breathe do die by reason of our drinking and breath- 



i6 Golden Rule Cook-Book 



in^ I endure no self-condemnation. Man cannot be re- 
quired to do the impossible by any Principle of Good, and 
to do each day what good he is able to do, to avoid the 
evil he can avoid, and in every diflSculty choose what he 
thinks to be the lesser of two evils, is perhaps as much as 
even Divine Love expects of him to-day. 

It is well to face the unpleasant fact that there are 
occasions when in our present state of development it 
seems necessary to kill in self-defence, as it were, moths, 
rats, etc.; but even in this we can "do our best," and it 
has been well said, "angels can do no more." We can 
by care in our households greatly reduce this necessity, 
and we can always see that no creatures, although destroy- 
ing our property, pilfering or stealing, are in meir death 
made to suffer. In this connection I would urge every one 
who reads these lines to never permit a piece of sticky 
fly-paper to be brought into the house, for of all cruel 
ways of destruction, this slow method, by which the 
unfortunate fly almost dismembers itself in its frantic 
efforts to escape, is one of the most fiendishly contrived. 

An advocate of Vegetarianism has truly said, "A 
vegetable diet is as little connected with weakness and 
cowardice as meat eating is with physical force and 
courage." That Vegetarians are not pnysical weaklings is 
no mere matter of opinion, but is proven by the giant 
Japanese wrestlers; the ancient Greek wrestlers; those 
Indian regiments of the British army showing most endur- 
ance ; by the peasantry of the world, which is seldom able 
to afford meat, and above all, by those famous Vegetarians 
who march around the globe doing the work carnivorous 
man is too weak to do, â€” the horse, the ox, the camel, and 
the elephant. One of our best-known cooking teachers 
and food experts printed this statement not long ago: 



Introduction \ 7 



"While meat seems necessary to the rapid development of 
the American, I must contend that a well-selected vege- 
table diet will give greater health, bodily vigour, and 
mental strength," which would seem contradictory, for 
even an American would not seem to require other food 
than that which will give him greatest health, bodily 
vigour, and mental strength. 

Nor have we cause to feel ashamed of the mentality of 
the guests at Ceres' table, which is graced by a goodly 
company; the list of names encircling the cover of "The 
Vegetarian Magazine" reads, "Adam, Hesiod, Gautama, 
Isaiah, Daniel, Plato, Zoroaster, Aristotle, Seneca, Ovid, 
Plutarch, Pope, Swedenborg, Leonardo da Vinci, Voltaire, 
Franklin, Westley, Linnaeus, Shelley, Tolstoi, and King 
Oscar 11." Others are Bernard Shaw, and Maurice 
Maeterlinck (who is said to have become a non-meat 
eater to gain greater endurance for his favourite pastime 
of mountain climbing), Richard Wagner, and General 
Booth. 

But after all, the one great argument for a fleshless diet 
is the humanitarian one, and it does not seem possible 
that persons exist to-day who do not know of the horrors 
of cruelty which take place hourly, in order that meat 
may be eaten by men and women who could not look 
without sickening at the process which has made possible 
the roast upon their tables, but who are nevertheless the 
employers of every fainting child in the stock-yards, and 
every brutalised man in the shambles, whose wages they 
pay with every pound of meat they buy. The real butcher 
of an animal is the one for whom it receives its death 
blow, not the one who actually deals that blow. 

A man who recently visited some stock-yards writes: 
"We were sorry to see the Thor man make mislicks at a 

2 



1 8 Golden Rule Cook- Book 



pretty heifer. His first stroke did not fell her, and she 
staggered and looked at him so wonderingly and pathetic- 
ally. He could not strike her while her head was in that 
Eosition, and after giving her two or three more ineffectual 
lows, she looked at him so reproachfully, as if pleading, 
'Why do you treat me so cruelly .? What have I ever done 
to you .?' Finally he got her down and out of her misery. 
I shall never take a bit of steak on my fork without seeing 
that pretty heifer lifting her stunned head to that awkward 
pounder." 

Perhaps nothing more revolting than this same writer's 
remarks anent pig-killing has been written, but since the 
words are accurately true, they should be fit to read, for 
if the words which tell the truth about meat as food are 
unfit for our ears, the meat itself is not fit for our mouths. 
He describes the pig-sticking, the skinning, and the 
process which makes the pig into pork, and then adds: 
'He goes into the cooling room, and the whole effort from 
that time is to keep him from crumbling back into dust, 
attacked by worms. Salt and brine and smoke and cold 
prevent the corpse from utter dissolution. The refriger- 
ator is a sort of Purgatory where the brute stays until he 
finally finds a cemetery in the human alimentary canal." 
Yet this man expects to again have meat "on his fork" ! 

The "Cosmopolitan" calls attention to the remarkable 
procession daily passing through a certain slaughter-house, 
as follows: "Imagine a procession of 10,000 cattle march- 
ing two by two, in a line fifteen miles long; let 20,000 
sheep follow them, bleating along twelve miles of road; 
after them drive sixteen miles of hogs, 27,000 strong ; then 
let 30,000 fowls bring up the rear, clucking and quack- 
ing and gobbling, over a space of six miles; and in this 
whole caravan, stretching for nearly fifty miles and re- 



Introduction 



quiring two days to pass a given point, you will see the 

animals devoted to death in the packing houses of 

& Co. in a single day. Surely a Buddhist would think 
that the head oi^that establishment had much to answer 
for. Never before in the world's history was a massacre 
of the innocents organised on such a stupendous scale or 
with such scientific system." 

People are suprisingly callous to the sufferings of those 
animals destined to become food. Recently some well- 
dressed, well-mannered men were on a train returning 
East from a Western visit, and the train coming to a stand- 
still for some reason, their conversation was plainly over- 
heard by their fellow-passengers. They were discussing 
a visit to the stock-yards, and one of them, quite convulsed 
with laughter, cried out that he really thought the most 
comical sight he had seen while away, in fact one of the 
funniest things he had seen in his whole life, was the antics 
of a pig "which had escaped out of the scalding pen!" 
The pig-sticker had evidently been as awkward that time 
as the man who missed the pretty heifer. 

It is daily less possible to buy turkeys and chickens 
minus their heads. The delicate death without the use of 
the old-time axe (which we degraded men and women 
have thought a pretty symbol to place on Thanksgiving 
Day table cards) is brought about by hanging the fowls 
up by the feet, in what fright can be imagined, an in- 
cision is then made in the roof of the mouth, and after 
bleeding to death, which, as in the case of calves or veal, 
insures solid white flesh, they are served as food to dainty 
women who can scarcely bear to kill a fly, and alas ! to 
some members of the societies for the Prevention of 
Cruelty to Animals ! 

One crate of chickens can encase more suffering than I 



20 Golden Rule Cook-Book 



want endured for me. There is first the terror in capture, 
then the suffering of being thrust, legs often tied, in the 
small over-crowded crate, then the journey in the shriek- 
ing train, and the thirst-tortured hours in the sun before 
the final twist of the neck or the blow of the axe, given in 
many cases just before natural death would render the 
fowl unfit for sale. And such food, poisoned by fear and 
suffering, is considered the most delicate, and thought fit 
to feed to invalids ! 

That all chickens do not endure the same suffering 
before death is no excuse for eating them, for some will 
have to submit to it while chicken is an article of food. 
The modern invention of fattening fowl by the machine- 
stuffing method, to make what are called in England 
"Surrey fowls," and in America are given various fancy 
names, is so revolting that it almost makes one faint to 
read a true account of it. We are selfishly prone to com- 
fort ourselves when these things are brought to our notice 
with the thought that the lower creatures do not suffer as 
we would. The fact is that no two live beings suffer the 
same in any event, physical or mental, but the lower 
animal or bird or fish suffers in its fear and death all it is 
capable of suffering, and we have no right to make any 
creature do this for our pleasure. 

Mr. E. Bell has written, "Dreadful are the revelations 
made by humane men, who, setting aside personal com- 
fort and peace of mind, have endeavoured to sound the 
depths of animal agony and bloodshed. The process of 
flaying alive, and even of dismembering animals before 
the breath has left their bodies, is far from uncommon in 
private slaughter-houses." 

When we witness the cruelty to horses on our streets, 
though they are property which the most unwise would 



Introduction 2 1 



naturally seek to care for, we can only imagine what must 
chance to the unfortunate creatures, already condemned 
to death and only regarded as food, at the hands of the 
hardened men whose miserable lot it is to be employed 
by Christendom to do its most evil work. 

In a pamphlet called "An Epitome of Vegetarianism" 
C. P. Newcombe writes: "Our opponents are quick to 
point out the supposed resemblance between the canine 
teeth of man and those of the carnivora, forgetting that 
they are even more prominent in the ape, the horse, and 
the camel. We accept the challenge and appeal for an 
authoritative statement of the facts to the great masters of 
science, among whom there is complete agreement, viz., 
that expressed by Baron Cuvier, the Professor of Natural 
History in the College of France, who wrote in 'The 
Animal Kingdom,' vol. i, page 88: 'Fruits, roots, and 
the other succulent parts of vegetables appear to be the 
natural food of man; his hands afford him a facility for 
gathering them, and his short and comparatively weak 
jaws, his short canine teeth, not passing beyond the com- 
mon line of others, and his tuberculous cheek teeth would 
not permit him either to feed upon herbage or devour 
flesh unless these aliments were previously prepared by 
the culinary process.' Similar opinions are expressed by 
Sir Charles Bell, F. R. S., Prof. William Lawrence, F. R. S., 
Sir Richard Owen, K. C. B., F. R. S., and Dr. Charles 
Darwin, with many others." 

While interesting in stating a case, this interests me as 
an argument but little, for if we were carnivorously made, 
with our minds, our hearts, our capacity for love and 
charity, and that great hope we have of finally manifesting 
the perfection of the sons of God, we still should control 
our tendencies by a higher law, and no more be carnivorous 



2 2 Golden Rule Cook-Book 

than we are apes, or marauders, or any other mental or 
physical manifestation from which spiritual evolution has 
lifted us high. 

But this humanitarianism does not consider alone the 
animals slaughtered, but the men, women, and children 
who do this revolting work. One packing-house in the 
West advertises over 18,000 employees ; multiply this by 
thousands and one can estimate the numbers of human 
beings who are thus degraded and brutalised. In my own 
household I have made it a point of honour to demand no 
labour which I would not be willing to do myself ; I might 
fail in strength, but morally I would be willing to under- 
take any work required by me, and from the day I realised 
what I required from others if I ate meat, I became an 
abstainer from it, for no surer ethical truth can be stated 
than that we have no moral right to demand from the 
hands of another, work we would not be willing to 
undertake ourselves. 

Mr. Henry Salt has written, "Of all recognised occupa- 
tions, the work which is looked upon with the greatest 
loathing (next to the hangman's) is that of the butcher â€” 
the trade of doing to death countless numbers of in- 
offensive and highly organised creatures, amid scenes of 
indescribable filth and ferocity â€” is delegated to a pariah 
class of slaughter-men, who are thus themselves made the 
victims of a grievous social wrong." 

So large a percentage of the murderers of to-day have 
been butchers, they or their fathers before them, that 
these statistics alone constitute a sufficient argument for 
Vegetarianism. 

Man's inhumanity to himself in this matter of flesh 
eating is rapidly being uncovered by meat inspectors, 
food experts, and hundreds of physicians the world over. 



Introduction 2 3 



The statistics comparing . meat-eating and non-meat- 
eating races with regard to tuberculosis, cancer, appendi- 
citis, etc., are of the greatest interest to those who care not 
only for the health but for the mere cleanness of their 
bodies. 

Dr. B. W. Richardson, in a book called "The Field 
of Disease," says: "In Jewish communities there are a 
number of men set apart to act as inspectors of animal 
food. They attend at the slaughter-houses, and after an 
animal is slain and dressed they submit it to inspection ; 
then, unless they put upon it their sign, that it is free from 
disease, it is not permitted to enter a Jewish family. It 
enters into the families outside the Jewish community, 
so that we who are not Jews actually accept into our 
bodies food which the Jews have rejected as diseased." 

The statistics taken from two small abattoirs alone, for 
one year, as given by a secretary of one Jewish ecclesiastical 
board are as follows: 

Total oxen killed 22,308 

Diseased 7,885 

Total calves killed 3,330 

Diseased 705 

Total sheep killed 41,556 

Diseased 13,019 

According to this very nearly one-third of all the meat 
sold to Christian families is tainted by parasitical disease. 
If an animal dies of cancer, tuberculosis, etc., our laws 
protect us from the carcass, but, if slaughtered, the dis- 
eased portion is cut away and the remainder is sold as fit 
for food. &w:ih blood is squeezed from beef and poured 
by the gallon by loving hands into the willing lips of 
consumptives and ansemics ! 



24 Golden Rule Cook-Book 

The true Vegetarian will not be seen adorned (?) by 
any of the reapings from a dead body, whether they be 
feathers or furs, for these have no beauty in the sight of 
those who see them in thought, dripping with the olood 
from which they can never be truly cleansed. 

Those who would "strain at gnats" while swallowing 
camels, criticise the Vegetarian for his kid gloves and his 
leather shoes; but perfect conditions do not yet prevail 
for the absolutely consistent carrying out of his principles ; 
his eflFort is to help to bring these to pass, and he does not 
refrain from beginning for the reason that he cannot yet 
do all. An adequate substitute for leather has been made 
which experiments have proven of value, but, as yet, there 
is no demand which justifies its manufacture. 

Many express the fear that, were wholesale slaughter 
abolished, the earth would be overrun by the lower 
animals; but were artificial and unnatural breeding 
discontinued we can safely trust that the animal creation 
would find its proper place in the world, as everything 
does, under the gmdance of the controlling Mind which 
is Creator. 

Stop and think for a moment what the world would be 
like to-day if it were Vegetarian. If the world were Vege- 
tarian, the endless caravans of doomed creatures would 
not be ambling to the shambles; not a man would be 
brutalised by the daily slaughter of hundreds of gentle 
creatures; not a woman would be engaged in sorting 
edible parts from the dissected carcasses, making aU 
red around her; not a child would be standing deep in 
ofiPal, seeking useful bits of dead bodies; "where sym- 
pathy is, cruelty is impossible," therefore, not a dog 
would be maltreated, not a cat selfishly deserted to starve, 
not a horse cruelly beaten, and not a vivisectionist could 



Introduction 2 5 



be found on the face of the earth ! Those who had learned 
to be just to the lower animals would not fail in their 
duties to man, and in this millennium, prophesied in 
Isaiah xi: 9, slaughter-houses, transport cars, and cattle- 
ships would be empty, and the fields and meadows would 
be filled with labourers under the clear sky, tilling the 
ground to provide the food of man.

THE KITCHEN 



T 



HERE is no room in the house which requires such 
careful furnishing as the kitchen, and much time may be 
saved there if the right thing is in the right place, for just 
as truly as "the means to do ill deeds make ill deeds done," 
do the means to do things well tend toward their being 
done. 

To house-builders I would urge that it pays to have a 
white enamelled sink, and to insist that no sand-soap or 
scouring soap be used on it, as this removes the finish and 
makes it less easy to keep it spotless. See that a package 
of one of the cleaning powders is placed near the sink, 
convenient for use the first time the maid looks about for 
materials, and over the sink on small hooks have hung 
two or three different shaped sink brushes. An enamelled 
soap-dish should be fastened above the sink, and on the left 
of it a grooved, slightly slanting draining board for washed 
dishes ; hanging under this on a large hook should be the 
enamelled dishpan and back of it a wire drainer, both 
hanging free from the wall. 

AjQy kitchen can have a chair-rail put around it, and this 
four-inch wide board should be arranged with small hooks 
placed at a distance of ten or twelve inches apart, and on 
these should hang the enamelled spoons, strainers, egg- 
beater, small jugs, and the saucepans, the bottoms of 
these being always in evidence and not out of sight in 
cupboards. The Europeans have always had their cook- 



30 Golden Rule Cook-Book 

ing utensils displayed as a part of the kitchen furnishing, 
and when this is done there is less temptation to neglect 
their absolute cleanliness. 

One of the comforts of my kitchen is a holder for 
saucepan covers; I was about to invent such a holder 
when I found that the wire ones made to display half a 
dozen handsome plates were perfectly suitable. One of 
these hangs beside the stove and the covers are con- 
veniently at hand when required. 

A cupboard built in the kitchen, sixteen inches deep 
and six feet across, will hold all the casseroles, baking-pans, 
tins for spices, etc., which the usual family requires. Mine 
was built with this conviction, and if it becomes over- 
crowded, I know it has things in it which do not belong 
there, and a few moments given to overseeing its rearrange- 
ment always leave it with all the space required. 

The table shown in the illustration is becoming well- 
known in American kitchens ; the deep drawers for flour, 
etc., are a convenience not easy to estimate, but the fact 
that two sizes of pastry boards slide snugly into their 
places under the top is its best feature. 

A ball of string in a holder hung up with small scissors 
attached, a neat calendar, a washable tablet for orders, a 
burnt-match holder, a match-box holder fastened near 
the stove, a small mirror on a door or in an inconspicu- 
ous corner, and a wall clock are things which I advise 
the young housekeeper to see securely placed in her 
kitchen before the pictures are hung in the drawing- 
room. 

A plate-rack is not only always quaint and decorative, 
but is most useful and labour-saving. A pestle and mor- 
tar should be among the utensils of every kitchen, as well 
as a vegetable mill, and a small hard-wood board, used 



The Kitchen 31 



exclusively for the cutting of fruit, vegetables, etc., which 
are to be sliced, saves many a cut finger, as the plate 
usually used is not the proper shape or texture for such a 
slippery process. 

A piece of thick glass measuring about 7x9 inches, and 
bound about the edges with heavy gummed paper or 
linen, is useful to lay upon the open pages of the cook- 
book, and serves the double purpose of holding it open at 
the required page and of protecting it from floured or 
buttered fingers. 

A plentiful supply of the small earthenware dishes, 
called casseroles, marmites, ramekins, and gratin dishes, 
is especially useful in the Vegetarian's kitchen. 

Those building homes should see that the place on 
which the stove is to stand is covered with suitable tiling, 
and this should extend for two feet or more around the 
stove. The floor itself is best covered with linoleum, 
and if a colour scheme is carried out in this room, as it 
may well be in these days of many-coloured enamelled 
ware, it can be accented by the linoleum chosen and the 
kitchen thus made as beautiful for its purpose as any 
room in the house. 



I HAVE not partaken of 
a fellow creature for fifteen 
years. â€” Bernard Shaw. 



THE DINING ROOM 



If a breakfast room is not used, a small winged table 
set in a sunny corner, or bay-window recess of the dining 
room, and used as a breakfast table, is an improvement 
upon breakfast at the large dining table, and can be 
arranged in almost any dining room. 

If pictures are hung in this room nothing less appropriate 
than those usually chosen as fit subjects for its walls can 
be imagined. Engravings showing the gentle deer hunted 
to his death, with the dog's fangs already buried in his 
flesh, stuflfed heads of the same animal, and paintings of 
dead fish, ducks or grouse, hanging by their feet, should 
not give pleasure to or improve the appetites of humane 
people. If pictures are used let us have those which 
depict life, joy, kindness, and beauty rather than cruelty, 
bloodshed, and death.

SUGGESTIVE COMMENTS 



SEASONING 

X HE subject of seasoning is indeed holy ground in 
culinary matters, and after much thought and experiment 
I have decided that the phrase so deplored by young 
housekeepers, "season to taste," is after all not the 
worst one to use. No such inaccurate directions were 
to appear in this cook-book when planned, but I have 
finally decided with the army of wiser cooks who have 
preceded me that accurate measurements in seasoning 
are dangerous to success. Not only do tastes vary, but 
much depends on the time the seasoning is added, on the 
rapidity with which the food is cooking, etc. With this in 
mind, and very long prejudice against the old phrase 
above mentioned, I have compromised and frequently 
been tempted to state quantities of salt and pepper, 
usually regretting when I nave. The truth is, unless one 
can "season to taste" one cannot cook palatable dishes, 
and my final word on the subject is that it is well to always 
use a little more salt and pepper than seems advisable, and 
then just before serving add a little more ! 

MEASURING 

Weights as a means of measuring quantities have been 
avoided in these recipes, as I can see no advantage to the 
system which uses them, and I have been able to show 



40 Golden Rule Cook-Book 

even English cooks that the scales are not the most neces- 
sary part of the kitchen furnishing, and they have become 
devoted to our simple method of using the Idtchen cup as 
the standard. It holds ^ pint, and 2 cups, therefore, hold 
1 pint ; 4 cups hold 1 quart ; and I find no fault with the 
old couplet, â€” 

" A pint 's a pound 
The world around." 

It usually is, and one cannot go far wrong in acting as 
if it always were. 

THICKENING 

In thickening sauces and soups, ordinary flour can 
always be used and cornstarch also, and as a rule I have 
said "flour" only in these recipes, but have only refrained 
from always advising potato-flour because it would have 
confused many who cannot obtain it in America. In 
Germany it is always used, and when it can be had is far 
nicer for thickening all vegetable sauces and soups than 
any other sort of flour. 



AN HERB GARDEN 

No one thing pays better for the little trouble expended 
than a small herb garden. Buy two or three tarragon 
plants, cover them in the winter, and in the autumn pick 
the leaves to make vinegar and to dry. Plant chervil, 
parsley, thyme, chives, and a plant of rosemary. 

A window-box will keep parsley and chives on hand, 
and a clump of chives from the market will grow for weeks 
if set in a bowl and watered occasionally. 



Suggestive Comments 41 



GELATINE 

Instead of the usual gelatine use must be made of arrow- 
root or a gelatine advertised to be purely vegetable. One 
tablespoon is usually allowed to 1 pint of liquid, but 
experiments must be made and there will usually be 
directions found with the package. 

FAT FOR FRYING 

The Vegetarian can well afford to do away with that 
doubtful economy, cooking butter. For ordinary frying 
use good butter ; for deep fat use a good brand of cooking- 
oil, or cocoanut butter. 

CANNED GOODS 

It seems to be a habit with many people to decry the use 
of canned vegetables, although I believe there are few 
households which subsist without them. My experience is 
that the best grades of canned vegetables are often far 
sweeter and better, fresher in fact, than vegetables that 
can be bought in city markets. The housekeeper should 
make it a point to know which brands she prefers and to 
trade where she can get them; and where no retailer 
carries them she can usually obtain cases containing two 
dozen each from the preservers themselves. A little 
trouble taken in the autumn to stock the store-room, 
instead of ordering "a can of peas" now and then at 
random, saves time and trouble in the end. Among the 
canned vegetables which are put up and sealed the day 
they are picked by the best firms are beets, peas, corn, 
spinach, nard-shelled beans, tomatoes, stringless beans. 



42 Golden Rule Cook-Boo k 

wax beans, mushrooms, pimentos, okra, okra-tomato, 
asparagus, etc. ; and the saving of time and labour in the 
preparation of beans, spinach, and beets especially, is 
worth consideration. People make the mistake of merely 
warming up canned goods and then serving them, whereas 
when the can is opened the vegetables are only ready to 
be seasoned and finished as they would be had they been 
boiled at home. Good canned vegetables are not easy 
to improve upon, and I serve them constantly to people 
who will not easily credit my statement that they are not 
so-called "fresh" vegetables.

SOUPS 



M. 



_ J.OST clear soups can be greatly improved in colour 
by using a small quantity of vegetable soup browning, or 
caramel. Do not overdo it, however, as the flavour is not 
pleasant when too pronounced. All cream soups should 
be cooked in a double boiler. 



VEGETABLE STOCK 

Few meat stocks have of themselves more flavour than 
vegetable stock, that is, the water in which vegetables 
have cooked. The water in which rice, onions, leeks, 
celery, beans, cabbage, etc., have boiled is valuable in 
Vegetarian cookeiy, and the wise cook will use it in many 
ways to enhance the flavours of soups and sauces. 



A SIMPLE CONSOMME OR STOCK 

A simple way of preparing a rich, clear consomme is to 
wash well ^ cup of German lentils, drain them and toss 
them for ten minutes in a saucepan in which 1 tablespoon 
of butter has been melted. Then pour on them 5 cups of 
cold water, set them over a hot fire, and let them boil 
rapidly about half an hour only. Drain, and strain 
through a fine cloth, and return to a clean saucepan with 
1 bay leaf, 1 slice of onion, 2 cloves, and ^ teaspoon of 



46 Golden Rule Cook- Book 

celery seed; simmer slowly for fifteen minutes, season 
with salt and pepper, and add a little sherry if liked. 

If the lentils are cooked longer, it will make a cloudy 
soup, which will be stronger but not clear. 



CLEAR BOUILLON OR CONSOMME 

There are various vegetable extracts in the market 
which, when diluted, make delicious stock, or clear soup. 
If these are not available, a clear vegetable broth may 
be made as follows: 

Wash 3 cups of any dried beans or lentils, and put them 
to soak in a covered earthenware dish with 10 cups of 
water for twelve hours or so. Then empty with that 
same water into a kettle, and let come slowly to the boil- 
ing point, skim frequently, and do not let it actually boil. 
When clear, and there seems no further need of skimming, 
add 1 cup each of cut onions, carrots, turnips, 1 table- 
spoon of parsley, 1 tablespoon of salt, 1 clove of garlic, 
and 1 teaspoon of thyme, etc., 1 tablespoon of celery seed, 
and 1 bay leaf. 

Let boil up once, and then place on the back of the 
stove to barely simmer for two hours ; then strain through 
a fine sieve, and a good broth is made. The beans, etc., 
can be utilised in a deep pie, or with brown or white sauce 
in crust cups, in a curry, or many other ways. 

To make this into a strong, clear soup put 2 table- 
spoons of butter in a saucepan, and when melted add 
\ cup each of chopped onions, carrots, turnips, and celery, 
2 cloves, and a bit of parsley ; fry until somewhat browned, 
then cover with 6 cups of the broth, and let simmer very 
quietly for two hours. Skim often, drain, let cool, remove 



Soups, 



47 



any grease from the top, and to clarify add to it, when 
cold, the slightly beaten yolk of 1 egg and the whites of 
3, then set over a hot fire and stir vigorously, watching for 
the first sign of boiling. At this, remove to a place where 
it cannot even simmer, but will be warm for half an hour, 
and strain through a fine, clean cloth. A wineglass of 
sherry may be added if to be served in cups. 



CREAM OF ARTICHOKE 

Scrape and slice enough Jerusalem artichokes to make 
2 cups, and'cover them with cold water. Let them stand 
for fifteen or twenty minutes, and put them in a saucepan 
with 2 quarts of cold water or milk, or 1 quart of each, 
and let them cook for an hour or until thoroughly soft. 
Now rub them through a sieve with 2 cups of the stock 
in which they cooked, and return to the fire. When boil- 
ing add 1 tablespoon of butter and 1 of flour, rubbed 
together, and 1 teaspoon of salt and 1 saltspoon of pepper, 
and cook about ten minutes before adding 2 cups of hot 
milk, or 1 cup of milk and 1 cup of cream. Stir well and 
let boil up once before serving. A teaspoon of chopped 
parsley or chives improves the appearance and taste of 
almost any cream soup. 



CREAM OF ARTICHOKE WITH NASTURTIUMS 

Make the plain cream of artichoke soup as in preced- 
ing recipe, and add before straining 1 handful of nasturtium 
leaves and blossoms ; or, instead, add 1 tablespoon of these, 
finely minced, to the soup before serving. 



48 Golden Rule Cook- Book 



ASPARAGUS SOUP 

Use 1 can of asparagus, cut oflf the tips, and lay them 
aside. Cut up the stalks, cover with 4 cups of cold milk 
(or use half water and half milk), and let cook slowly in 
a double boiler for half an hour ; then strain, pressing the 
asparagus well to extract the flavour. Return to the 
saucepan, add 1 teaspoon of sugar, 1 tablespoon of 
butter, into which 1 teaspoon of flour has been made 
smooth, season generously with salt and pepper, add the 
asparagus tips, 1 cup of milk, and, just before serving, 1 
tablespoon of whipped cream. A tablespoon of minced 
onion fried for ten minutes in butter is sometimes added 
to the stalks while cooking. 

BARLEY AND TOMATO SOUP 

Cook 1 can of tomatoes and 1 chopped Spanish onion 
together for fifteen minutes, then rub through a wire 
sieve; add 3 tablespoons of pearl barley, 1 tablespoon 
of butter, some pepper and salt, and cook for one hour, 
until the barley is soft. Re-season before serving. 

BLACK BEAN SOUP 

Soak 2 cups of beans for twelve hours or more, and 
then drain them and put into 8 cups of cold water ; add 3 
whole cloves, 3 whole allspice, and 3 whole peppers, salt 
well and boil gently for two hours, rub through sieve, and 
reheat. Mix 1 tablespoon of thickening flour, and 1 
tablespoon of butter and water, and stir into the soup at 
boiling point; season afresh and pour into a tureen in 
which are placed, neatly sliced, 1 hard-boiled egg and half 



Soups 



49 



a dozen seeded slices of lemon. This soup is improved 
by adding 1 wineglass of sherry, or one may substitute for 
it a few drops of Tomato Chutney or Worcestershire sauce. 



BELGIAN SOUP 

Take 4 cups of diced turnips and put them in a sauce- 
pan with 2 taolespoons of butter, and stir for ten minutes 
over a slow fire ; then stir in 2 cups of water, 2 teaspoons 
of brown sugar, and plenty of pepper and salt, and let 
simmer for another ten minutes ; add 2 cups of milk 
thickened with 1 tablespoon of flour, let boil up, stirring 
constantly, and serve with croutons. 



PLAIN BEAN SOUP 

Wash 2 cups of any sort of dried beans and soak twelve 
hours or more in cold water. Before using, strain them 
and cover with 8 cups of cold water. Put over the fire 
and let cook gently for four hours, then rub them through 
a sieve into their own stock, season with 1 tablespoon of 
salt and \ teaspoon of pepper and 1 tablespoon of butter, 
and let them cook ten minutes longer. Serve with half- 
inch squares of toast in the tureen. 



BROWN BEAN SOUP 

Take 1 cup of brown beans and \ cup of German 
lentils, wash well and put in a saucepan with plenty of 
cold water, 2 or 3 chopped onions, 1 stalk of celery, 1 
bay leaf, and simmer together for three hours, then strain. 
If a thin soup is wanted, do not press any of the pulp 

4 



5Â© Golden Rule Cook- Book 

through the strainer, but if it is liked somewhat thick, do 
so. Return the strained soup to the saucepan and thicken 
with 1 teaspoon of thickening flour. This is now deli- 
cious soup stock, and can be served plain, or varied by 
adding peas, diced carrots, spaghetti, a few drops of 
sauce, a little sherry, tomato catsup, or curry powder. 
Season well with salt and pepper before serving. 

RED BEAN SOUP 

Soak for 8 hours or more 2 cups of red beans, then put 
them in a large saucepan containing 8 cups of cold water, 
1 cup of milk, and 2 onions halved, each having 4 cloves 
stuck in it. Let cook for two hours, then press through a 
sieve, reheat, adding just before serving 1 wineglass of 
claret and fresh seasoning of salt and pepper. 1 hard- 
boiled egg chopped fine is an improvement to this soup. 

LIMA BEAN CREAM SOUP 

Soak 2 cups of dried lima beans for several hours and 
then put them in a saucepan with 1 cup of cold water and 
1 cup of milk and let them cook for two hours, adding 
salt when they have partly cooked. Put 1 tablespoon of 
butter in a frying pan, and when melted add 1 onion 
chopped fine. Let cook slowly until browned, then scrape 
the contents of the frying pan into the saucepan contain- 
ing the beans, and ^dd 1 tablespoon of tomato catsup or 
chutney and press all through a sieve, and re-season before 
serving. If liked a little thick, use 1 tablespoon of flour, 
made smooth in \ cup of milk or cream, to thicken. A 
tablespoon of whipped cream in the tureen is always an 
improvement to a cream soup.

DUTCH CABBAGE SOUP 



Make exactly like Cockie-Leekie soup, using the water 
in which a cabbage has boiled for stock and adding \ cup 
of finely chopped cabbage instead of using any of the 
barley to return to the strained soup. Those who like 
caraway seed will enjoy the addition of 1 teaspoon of these 
to the soup. If used, add them with the chopped cabbage 
after the other seasoning has been removed. 



CALCUTTA BISQUE 

Put 1 cup of tomato pulp in a saucepan and with it 1 
bay leaf. When hot add to it 1 saltspoon of soda, and as 
it foams stir slowly into it 3 or 4 cups of milk, 1 teaspoon 
of curry powder, 1 teaspoon of butter, and 1 saltspoon of 
salt. Let boil up once and serve with croutons. 

The water in which rice has boiled or any vegetable 
stock may be substituted for milk and the soda then 
omitted. 

CANTON STEW 

Put 2 cups of finely shredded cabbage in enough water 
to boil and let cook slowly until tender, which should be 
in about three quarters of an hour. When the cabbage 
has been cooking half an hour, add a cup of milk, and 
when it is nearly done put in 2 cups of muk ; let boil up 
once, then season with salt, black pepper, and pour in a 
hot tureen, in which should be laid 1 teaspoon of butter. 
Those who like oyster crackers served in or with milk 
stews can use them with this soup which greatly resembles 
an oyster stew in flavour. 



52 Golden Rule Cook- Book 



CARROT BROTH 

Scrape and cut 3 or 4 large carrots (or more of the small 
French sort) in eighths lengthwise and boil them until ten- 
der. Put 2 tablespoons of butter in a saucepan, and when 
melted add 1 scant half cup of oatmeal to it, putting in 
1 tablespoon at a time and stirring carefully with a wooden 
spoon until all the butter is taken up ; then put in 1 ladle 
of stock in which the carrots have been cooked, and con- 
tinue stirring ; then another ladle of stock, and so on until 
a cup and a half of stock has been added during ten min- 
utes' slow cooking. Now put in another cup of stock and 
let cook ten minutes ; then, as the soup will be getting too 
thick, add another cup of stock and so on, thinning the 
soup with additional stock until the oatmeal is thoroughly 
cooked. If Quaker Oats is used, the soup will only have 
to cook about forty minutes, and it is best to strain it 
before serving; fine Scotch meal will take longer, but 
does not need to be strained and thickens somewhat 
better. 

When the soup is half cooked add 1 teaspoon of salt, 
1 saltspoon of pepper, and a dash of nutmeg. (Serve the 
carrots with a plain sauce or warm them up next day in 
some of the ways mentioned under Carrots.) 



CREAM OF CARROT AND ONION 

Take 2 cups of grated carrot and 1 chopped onion and 
fry for ten minutes with 1 tablespoon of butter and then 
cover with 4 cups of cold water and let boil. Add salt and 
pepper and in twenty minutes 1 cup of milk in which 1 
tablespoon of flour has been dissolved.

CREAM OF CARROTS 



Put 2 cups of grated carrot with 1 pint (2 cups) of cold 
water in a double boiler, and when heated add 2 table- 
spoons of butter and 1 teaspoon of sugar. Let cook for 
an hour, then add \ cup of stale bread crumbs and 2 cups 
of water, and let cook half an hour longer. Rub the con- 
tents of the double boiler through a fine sieve, add 1^ cups 
of hot milk, 1 tablespoon of salt and a saltspoon of pepper, 
and return to the boiler. Beat 2 egg-yolks in ^ cup of 
milk, and when the soup boils again stir them into it. 
Stir hard for one minute and serve. 

CREAM OF CHEESE 

Put 1 quart (or 4 cups) of milk in a double boiler, and 
put with it f of a cup of grated cheese, 1 teaspoon of 
grated onion, 1 teaspoon of some piquant sauce, | tea- 
spoon of salt, a dash of cayenne pepper, and 1 tablespoon 
of flour and 1 of butter rubbed together. Stir until smooth, 
then beat the yolks of 2 eggs with 2 tablespoons of milk, 
put in the tureen, and pour the boiling soup over them, 
stirring during the process. Add a little salt and serve 
with croutons. 

CREAM OF CAULIFLOWER 

Take a good-sized cauliflower, and let it soak in cold 
water, which is slightly salted, for half an hour ; then drain 
it and put it, head upwards, in a saucepan which is not 
over large, and let it cook for half an hour uncovered. Put 
in a double boiler 1 quart of milk (4 cups), 1 onion and 
1 bay leaf, and let them cook together while the cauli- 



54 Golden Rule Cook- Book 



flower is boiling. Drain the cauliflower when done, and 
reserve \ cup of the little sprays which form the head, 
mash the remainder in a wooden bowl, and add to it 2 
cups of the stock in which it boiled and put in with the 
boiling milk; stir well, and let cook five minutes, then 
put through a sieve and return to the fire with a thickening 
of 1 tablespoon of flour rubbed together with 1 tablespoon 
of butter, season lightly with salt and pepper and a dash of 
nutmeg, add the \ cup of cauliflower as a garnish, and 
let cook ten minutes more before serving. A tablespoon 
of whipped cream is an addition if added at the last. 



CHESTNUT SOUP 

Peel and blanch 1 quart of Italian chestnuts and chop 
them fine, then boil for half an hour in 2 quarts of water. 
Strain the chestnuts and crush them to fine pulp in a 
mortar, and gradually stir on this 1 quart of the stock in 
which the chestnuts cooked, and then rub all through a 
sieve. Return to the fire in a saucepan with 1 cup of 
bread crumbs, 1 tablespoon of salt, and 1 saltspoon of 
pepper. Cook for half an hour, then strain again, and add 
2 cups of milk and a grating of nutmeg, and 1 tablespoon 
of browned butter, and reheat to boiling point. 



CREAM OF CELERY 

Wash and scrape and cut into half-inch pieces what will 
make 1 cup of celery ; put it into 1 quart of boiling salted 
water and cook for nearly an hour or until very soft, then 
mash it in the water in which it was boiled. Put 1 tea- 
spoon of chopped onion, 2 bay leaves, some mace, and 2

cloves into 2 cups of milk, let simmer for ten minutes, and 
add it to the celery pulp. Now press through a sieve and 
return to the double boiler in which the milk was cooked. 
Melt 1 tablespoon of butter and blend it with 1 tablespoon 
of flour until smooth, and stir it into the boiling soup ; then 
season with salt and pepper. Boil five minutes and strain 
into a hot tureen in which a pat of butter and 1 tablespoon 
of whipped cream have been put. The addition of 1 table- 
spoon of chopped chives is an improvement to the appear- 
ance and taste, or parsley may be used if preferred. 

CREAM OF CHESTNUT 

Shell and blanch and cut in quarters 2 cups (1 pound) 
of Italian chestnuts and cover them with 2 cups of boiling 
water. Add 1 slice of onion (or a drop of onion juice 
extract), J cup of chopped celery (or 1 teaspoon celery 
seed), 1 bay leaf, 1 sprig of parsley, and 1 saltspoon of 
paprika. Cover and boil until the chestnuts are tender, 
â€” about half an hour. Then grind in a mortar, or press 
through a colander or vegetable mill, and add 1 quart 
(4 cups) of milk, and 1 tablespoon of butter and 1 of flour 
rubbed together, and cook for three minutes ; then add 1 
teaspoon of salt, and press all through a fine sieve and 
reheat before serving. 

CREAM OF CORN 

Put 1 quart of milk and 1 can of corn in a double boiler 
and let boil ; mix 1 teaspoon of butter and 1 of cornstarch

COCKIE-LEEKIE 

Put 2 tablespoons of butter in a saucepan, and when 
melted stir in, a spoonful at a time, 1 cup of pearl barley, 
taking ten minutes to add it all ; then cover with 8 cups 
of carrot or onion broth (or use water), and add 2 bay 
leaves, 1 onion with 4 cloves stuck in it, a bouquet of herbs 
and parsley, 1 stalk of celery, and let simmer for one hour 
and a half, then strain, reserving some of the barley. 
Prepare leeks by washing and cutting into 2-inch lengths 
(using some of the green), and slicing lengthwise, and add 
them to the soup ; put in the barley, and let cook twenty- 
five minutes and season with salt and pepper. 



CREOLE SOUP 

Put 1 can of tomatoes, 1 quart of water or vegetable 
stock, 1 sliced onion, and 1 small sliced carrot, and 1

Return the strained mixture to the double boiler and put 
in 2 scant tablespoons of boiled rice, 1 teaspoon of salt, 
\ teaspoon paprika, 1 tablespoon of sugar. Cream 2 
tablespoons of butter with 1 tablespoon of flour, and stir 
into the soup ; let boil up once and serve. 



CREAM OF CURRY 

Put 1 quart (or 4 cups) of milk in a double boiler with

FLORENTINE SOUP 

Melt 2 tablespoons of butter in a saucepan, and put into 
it f of a cup of finely chopped onions and stir over a 
moderate heat about five minutes and then add 2 full 
cups of very thinly sliced turnips; stir these with the 
onions for another five minutes and then add 2 table- 
spoons of flour and gradually add 2 pints of boiled milk 
mixing all well together ; watch it till it boils and then let 
simmer gently, stirring frequently during twenty minutes 
or half an hour, until the onions are quite soft. Then add 
2 more cups of milk, and when this boils add 1 cup of 
tomato puree (either canned tomato soup or canned 
tomatoes), or \\ cups of sliced fresh tomatoes, using a 
pinch of soda to prevent curdling. Now press the contents 
of the saucepan through a fine sieve, add a heaping tea- 
spoon of butter, reheat, and serve with croutons and 
1 tablespoon of whipped cream. 



HEILBRONN SOUP 

Take 3 quarts of water in which vegetables have been 
boiled (preferably onions or leeks) and let simmer. In 
another enamelled pan put 1 tablespoon of butter; when 
melted stir in slowly with a wooden spoon \ cup of 
barley, adding a little at a time, until butter is well "taken 
up." Let it cook for five minutes, stirring constantly.

then add (a ladle at a time) 6 or 8 ladles of the hot stock, 
putting in this amount during ten minutes of stirring. 
Add J the remaining stock, and salt, pepper, and some 
nutmeg, and let simmer twenty minutes ; then the remain- 
ing stock and simmer another one-half hour. Peel \ 
pound mushrooms and cut in 4 or 6 pieces each; fry 
them in butter for five minutes, and add to soup ten 
minutes before serving and season afresh. 



JULIENNE SOUP

Soups 69 

parsley ; cover and let cook for half an hour, then mash 
the contents of the double boiler with a potato-masher, 
and add to them 6 cups of water, and when this boils add 
to the soup 2 tablespoons of butter and 2 of flour rubbed

bay leaf, and 8 cups (or 2 quarts) of cold water. Cover 
the saucepan and let the soup cook slowly three quarters 
of an hour, then strain carefully and return to the sauce- 
pan. Season with 1 teaspoon of salt, and add \ cup of 
spaghetti broken into inch-long pieces. Cover the sauce- 
pan and let the soup simmer for an hour, as this will draw 
more flavour from the spaghetti than rapid boiling, and is 
the better way for a soup, since the object is to extract 
the flavour of the ingredients. Grated or Parmesan cheese 
served with this soup is an improvement. 

SCOTCH BROTH

cutter, roll them in yolk of egg and then in fine crumbs, 
place in a frying basket, and fry in hot vegetable fat 
until a golden brown. Serve very hot, garnished with 
parsley, and with a tureen of sauce Tartare. Serve alone 
after soup. 



FRIED ARTICHOKES WITH TOMATO SAUCE 

Fry artichokes as in foregoing recipe and serve with 
hot tomato sauce. 



JERUSALEM ARTICHOKES LYONNAISE 

Boil the artichokes as directed, but do not let them 
quite finish cooking, then slice them. Put 1 tablespoon 
of butter in a frying pan, and when melted add 1 large 
onion sliced or chopped, and when onions are transparent, 
but not brown, add the artichokes and fry slowly. Sprinkle 
with chopped parsley or chives. 

JERUSALEM ARTICHOKE PUREE 

Boil 1 quart of artichokes as already directed, drain, 
mash and press through a fine sieve, and stir in 2 table- 
spoons of melted butter ; then stir over a low fire until the 
moisture is exhausted. Remove from the fire, and when 
cold add 4 eggs which have been well beaten, beating them 
briskly, and adding them slowly to the puree ; also beat in 
1 tablespoon of whipped cream. When thoroughly mixed

into individual moulds, and steam or poach with water 
half-way up the mould, and turn out and serve with some 
good sauce, tomato or HoUandaise preferred, or the sauce 
described as being made with the water in which the 
artichokes were boiled can be used ; to it should be added 
1 teaspoon of finely chopped parsley.

blanched chopped almonds. Serve on toast or in cases. 



FRENCH OR GLOBE ARTICHOKES 

The globe artichoke is a most delicious addition to a 
vegetarian menu, and it is not because it is not known to be 
edible, but because many people do not know how either 
to eat it or to serve it, that it is not oftener seen in America. 
I have had it served to me in almost every European 
country and often in restaurants in America, and have 
never encountered but one cook who knew how it should 
be sent to the table after cooking, and one waiter who 
knew how to serve it when it got there. It is usually 
served half cold with the leaves falling all about it because 
the "thistle, " and usually the best of the artichoke besides, 
has been carelessly removed in the kitchen; instead of 
which it should be served whole, as in this way only can 
it be kept hot enough to be palatable. The artichoke 



Vegetables 8 3 

should be set stem end downward on a hot, flat dish and 
wound about at the base with a small table napkin, and 
the person who serves it, holding it in the napkin, should 
reverse it and taking a small, sharp, silvered knife should 
cut through the artichoke on the bottom, using a sawing 
motion, and with the help of a serving fork ease apart 
the "thistle" and the closely knitted small leaves in the 
centre. Unless the artichokes are very large ones, a half 
of one is not too much to serve each person. The "thistle " 
should be removed by the server, and this should be done 
by carefully separating it from the "fond" or base, which 
is the fleshy part from which the leaves grow out. The 
leaves should be taken one by one, by the dry tip, in the 
fingers, and the fleshy end thus pulled from the base 
should be dipped in the sauce served, and the soft portion 
removed by drawing it between the front teeth ; when the 
leaves are finished the base should be cut up with a fork 
and eaten with the sauce. 

TO STEAM GLOBE ARTICHOKES 

Prepare for cooking as in the above recipe, place in a 
covered steamer, and let steam forty minutes or until the 
leaves, when pulled, part easily from the base. 

TO BOIL GLOBE ARTICHOKES 

Globe artichokes should not look dry and wrinkled 
when bought, but green and fresh. Put them in cold 
salted water and a little vinegar for fifteen minutes to 
cleanse and free from insects, then put them in salted 
boiling water and boil until the leaves part easily from the 
base when pulled ; this should be in about half an hour. 



84 Golden Rule Cook- Book 

but the time varies with the age and size of the arti- 
choke ; it should then be drained and the stem cut off so 
that it will stand erect on the serving dish. 

GLOBE ARTICHOKES STUFFED WITH MUSHROOMS 

Cut the stalk from fresh artichokes and trim the leaves 
to an even length, and boil them for twenty minutes, or 
until the choke or thistle can be removed neatly. Put 1 
tablespoon of butter in a frying pan, and when melted add 
2 finely minced shallots (or use chives or onion tops), and 
1 teaspoon of chopped parsley, and 1 cup of chopped fresh 
or canned mushrooms, salt and pepper, and frj' all 
together for five minutes. Fill the artichoke with this, tie 
the leaves together and set in a pan containing 1 cup of 
stock (or water), 2 tablespoons of butter or olive oil, and 
bake them half an hour, basting them thoroughly five or 
six times. Remove the strings, set upright and serve very 
hot with Dutch butter, or any sauce preferred. 

GLOBE ARTICHOKES VINAIGRETTE 

Serve cold boiled artichokes, which have been cut in 
half and the "thistles" removed, with sauce vinaigrette, 
which is French dressing to which a little chopped onion 
or onion juice and chopped parsley have been added. 

FONDS D'ARTICHAUT 

The bottom or solid part of the globe artichoke can be 
bought preserved in bottles ; heat them in their own liquid, 
drain, and serve hot with Hollandaise sauce, or cold with 
sauce vinaigrette or mayonnaise.

ASPARAGUS 

Asparagus should be carefully looked over and washed, 
and then tied into a bunch with a piece of tape, with all 
the heads level, then with a very sharp knife an inch or 
two of the stalks should be so evenly cut off that the bunch 
will stand upright. Stand the asparagus in a deep sauce- 
pan so that the tips are well out of the water, add 1 tea- 
spoon of salt, put a cover on the saucepan, and let cook 
about half an hour or twenty-five minutes. In this way 
the tips are suflBciently steamed by the time the stalks are 
cooked, and will not be cooked to pieces as when immersed 
in water. 



ASPARAGUS WITH WHITE SAUCE 

Having boiled the asparagus as directed, lift it out by 

E lunging a sharp fork into it two or three inches from the 
ottom, lay it on a hot plate on the top of the stove, cut 
the tape and arrange 4 or 5 pieces each on long strips of 
toast, and pour over each 2 tablespoons of nicely seasoned 
white sauce; arrange neatly on a long platter with the 
asparagus heads all turned one way. 



ASPARAGUS WITH DUTCH BUTTER 

Proceed exactly as in above recipe, but instead of the 
white sauce pour a little melted butter over all, and serve 
with a small tureen of Dutch butter. 



86 Golden Rule Cook-Book 



HOT ASPARAGUS TIPS 

Take a can of asparagus tips, drain and put in a sauce- 
pan with 2 tablespoons of melted butter into which some 
paprika has been shaken. When hot garnish with dia- 
monds of toast to serve, and sprinkle with salt. 

WHITE ASPARAGUS 

Open canned asparagus at the bottom, and after drain- 
ing, ease it from the can, so as to prevent the tips from 
being injured. Lay the stalks evenly in a shallow enam- 
elled pan, cover with hot water or the juice from the 
can, and let heat through over a slow fire. Remove after 
ten minutes' cooking to a heated flat dish, using a strainer 
to lift the stalks from the water. Serve with Dutch butter, 
into which a few browned crumbs have been stirred, or 
chopped chives can be used instead of crumbs. The as- 
paragus can also be served with tomato sauce. 

ASPARAGUS VINAIGRETTE 

Place the can of asparagus to be used on the ice for 
half an hour, then open and drain and rinse carefully in 
cold water. Place on crisp lettuce leaves, using 5 or 6 
stalks on each, and serve with sauce vinaigrette. 

FRIED TIPS WITH ONION BUTTER 

Put 1 tablespoon of butter in a saucepan, and when 
melted add 1 tablespoon of grated onion and the drained 
contents of 1 can of asparagus tips. Let all cook together 
slowly for five minutes, and season with salt and pepper.

ASPARAGUS TIPS WITH WHITE SAUCE 

Heat 1 can of asparagus tips with 1 tablespoon of melted 
butter, and to serve, cover with f of a cup of highly seasoned 
white sauce in which the white of 1 hard-boiled egg has 
been mixed, after being chopped fine. Sprinkle over the 
top the yolk of the egg pressed through a sieve, and serve 
with squares of toast. 



ASPARAGUS IN BREAD CASES 

Boil 2 cups of asparagus tips in salted water for fifteen 
minutes, and then drain them; while they are cooking 
put 1 cup of milk in a double boiler, and when boiling

ously meanwhile, and then put the eggs into the double 
boiler with the milk, and stir until it begins to thicken. 
Add 1 teaspoon of butter, \ teaspoon of salt, and \ salt- 
spoon of pepper, and remove from the fire. Cut the 
asparagus tops into half-inch pieces and add them to 
the sauce. Take 5 stale rolls, cut off the tops, remove the 
inside, and let them dry in the oven ; when crisp and hot 
fill each with the asparagus in sauce, replace the top and 
serve. 

ESCALLOPED ASPARAGUS 

Use either fresh green asparagus, or canned asparagus. 
Cut it into two-inch lengths, and if fresh is used cook in 
boiling water for ten minutes. Put 2 tablespoons of butter 
in a frying pan and brown in it \ cup of bread crumbs 
and \ cup of finely chopped roasted peanuts. Roll each 
bit of asparagus in beaten egg and the crumbs and nut

Put 2 tablespoons of butter in the bean-pot, or a deep 
baking dish, drain the beans, and put them in the butter. 
Pour over them slowly 4 tablespoons of dark molasses, 
1 tablespoon of salt, and add 1 tablespoon of butter ; 
then fill the bean-pot to the top with hot water and bake 
in a very slow oven for 6 or 7 hours. As the water cooks 
away replace it. This will require doing about three 
times during the baking. Serve in the dish in which they 
were cooked, and garnish with whole black pickled 
walnuts.

same dish practically with far less trouble. 



SPANISH BEANS 

Soak for eight or ten hours any sort of large dried beans, 
then drain them and put them into boiling water two hours 
or more, or until cooked. One way of testing them is to 
remove a few and blow on them ; if the skins crack they 
are done. Drain, and put them in a bean-pot or casserole

two hours. Canned Lima beans only need reheating, 
draining, and a little milk and butter and seasoning added 
to them. 



LIMA BEANS HOLLANDAISE 

Boil 1 quart of beans until tender, salting them well 
when half cooked. Beat a large tablespoon of butter to 
a cream, beat in the yolk of 1 egg, 1 tablespoon of finely

BEETS 

Great care should be taken in washing beets that the 
small rootlets are not broken or the skin of the beet bruised, 
as anything which causes the juice to escape injures both 
the taste and the colour. In the city, beets are seldom 
obtainable which require less than two or three hours' 
cooking ; but really young, small beets should not require 
more than one hour's boiling. When boiled they should 
be drained, then plunged into cold water, after which the 
skin can be rubbed off with the hand. Some, however, 
prefer that beets should be baked or steamed ; the time 
required to cook will then be somewhat longer. Canned 
beets are a great convenience. 

CREAMED BEETS 

Boil 6 or 7 medium-sized beets until tender, then re- 
move them from the saucepan and place them in cold 
water ; rub the skins off carefully with the hands, and cut 
them in half -inch cubes. Make a sauce of 2 tablespoons 
of butter creamed with 2 tablespoons of flour and \ cup of 
the water in which the beets were boiled, 2 tablespoons 
of cream, 2 tablespoons of vinegar, 2 teaspoons of sugar, 
^ teaspoon of salt, and 1 saltspoon of pepper. Pour the 
sauce over the hot beets and serve in a heated deep dish. 

VIRGINIA BEETS 

Carefully peel boiled beets, and with a sharp knife cut 
into very thin, even slices, laying them as sliced into a 
heated vegetable dish ; when a layer has been made over 
the bottom, dot it well with butter, season lightly with 



Vegetables 9 5 

salt, and sprinkle with 1 tablespoon of granulated sugar ; 
then arrange another layer of beets with butter, salt, and 
sugar, and proceed in this way until the dish is filled. 
The work snould be done near the fire in order that the 
beets may not cool, as the dish should be served very hot. 
If, however, the beets have cooled in preparation, set them 
in a hot oven for a few minutes, and turn them with a spoon 
in the dish before serving in order that they may be juicy. 

PICQUANT BEETS 

Peel hot cooked beets, cut into slices, and toss about for 
three or four minutes in a saucepan which contains 3 
tablespoons of butter to which has been added 1 teaspoon 
of plain vinegar, or a few drops of tarragon, 2 cloves, and 
1 teaspoon of sugar. 

GERMAN BEETS 

Make a sauce of 1 tablespoon of butter, when melted 
add 1 tablespoon of flour,. 2 teaspoons of onion juice, \ 
teaspoon of salt, 1 tablespoon of sugar, 1 tablespoon of 
lemon juice, and enough hot water to make the sauce the 
right consistency; then add freshly sliced cooked beets, 
and let cook together three or four minutes before serving. 

PICKLED BEETS 

Place slices of cold beets in a deep porcelain or glass 
receptacle, place some peppercorns among them, and a 
few allspice, cover with mild vinegar, and let stand ten or 
twelve hours before using.

BRUSSELS SPROUTS 

Brussels sprouts are best if laid for ten minutes, after 
trimming and looking over, in salted cold water which 
contains some lemon juice. They should then be drained 
and put in a large saucepan filled with boiling water 
containing salt and a pinch of soda. Parboil in this ten 
minutes, then lift them with a strainer and put in a steamer 
above the boiling water ; cover, and let steam half an hour 
to finish cooking. 

If sprouts are cooked by boiling instead of steaming, 
leave the saucepan uncovered, as this will keep the odour 
from being pronounced. Boil in salted water from twenty 
to thirty minutes, drain the instant they are tender, and 
serve with melted butter. 



BRUSSELS SPROUTS IN DUTCH BUTTER 

Put boiled Brussels sprouts in a saucepan with 2 table- 
spoons of melted butter, to which has been added a table-

CABBAGE 

Wash cabbage carefully after cutting it in half, and let 
it boil for five minutes in well-salted boiling water ; pour 
this water off and re-cover with fresh boiling water; let 
cook for half an hour, then add 1 teaspoon of salt, and let 
finish cooking, which will be in about another half an 
hour for a paedium-sized cabbage. 

Cabbage should never be covered while boiling, as 
covering increases the odour in cooking.

or somewhat less. 

Red cabbage can be prepared in this same way, and a 
pretty dish is made by using equal quantities of red and 
white cabbage. 

CABBAGE SARMAS 

Put 1 tablespoon of butter in a saucepan, and when 
melted add 1 onion chopped fine, and after it has cooked 
gently for ten minutes stir into it 1 cup of boiled rice,

small cabbage for fifteen minutes, then separate its leaves, 
and into each leaf roll 1 tablespoon of the force-meat; 
pack tightly in a shallow pan, dredge with salt and pepper, 
and cover with the water in which the cabbage cooked; 
lay 2 bay leaves on the top, and let simmer for fifteen 
minutes. Serve with meltea butter or tomato sauce. 

CABBAGE LICHTENSTEIN 

Cut one large cabbage into small pieces, not using the

CARROTS SAUTE 

Use boiled carrots cut in dice or fancy shapes and toss 
them for five minutes in hot butter. Season with salt and 
pepper, add a little chopped parsley, and serve very hot. 

Fancy shaped German carrots in glass bottles can be 
used instead of fresh ones. 



GLORIFIED CARROTS 

Take 2 cups of diced carrots and boil them in slightly 
sweetened water about half an hour, or until tender, and 
let them cool. Put 1 tablespoon of butter into a saucepan, 
add to it 1 teaspoon of grated onion, and toss together until 
hot; then add the diced carrots and 1 cup of well-made 
white sauce. Butter small individual gratin dishes, fill 
them with the carrot mixture, sprinkle the top with a few 
lightly browned bread crumbs, then with chopped chives, 
and set in a hot oven for five minutes. Serve alone as an 
entree, placing each dish on a small plate with a paper 
doily. 

This dish can be varied by using more chives mixed with 
the carrots and omitting the onion, or, if chives are not at 



Vegetables 103 



hand, they can be omitted when the onion is used, and 
finely chopped parsley substituted to garnish the top. 

The quantities given here can be doubled, and the 
carrots cooked in a large baking dish as an addition to 
the main course of a luncheon or dinner. 



GLAZED CARROTS 

For this, the carrots must be cut into even cones or 
ovals, and it is convenient to use the imported carrots in 
glass bottles. If these are used they are already boiled; 
if fresh carrots are used scrape and wash them and cut 
out the little shapes with a patent cutter, then boil slowly 
until tender, but not quite done, and put 2 or 3 cups of 
them in a frying pan with 2 tablespoons of butter, which 
has been melted, sprinkle with fine sugar, and stir over a 
hot fire until they begin to brown ; then add 2 tablespoons 
of the stock they boiled in, continue to stir them, add 
more stock if needed, and continue stirring until the carrots 
are nicely glazed. Serve alone or as a garnish.

CAULIFLOWER 



Leave all the green that looks fresh and palatable on the 
cauliflower, and wash it and let it stand from fifteen 
minutes to half an hour in salted water. Then put it in 
a saucepan, stem downwards, with the top barely covered 
with boiling water, and, if the saucepan is not too large, it 
will keep the cauliflower upright, so that the delicate top 
will not cook to pieces before the green stalk is tender. â€¢ 
A small cauliflower will take half an hour to cook, and 
the lower part can be tried with a fork to see when it is 
tender. Leave the saucepan uncovered in cooking cauli- 
flower, and the odour from the cooking will be very much 
lessened and the cauliflower more delicate in taste. 

CREAMED CAULIFLOWER 

Boil and drain a cauliflower and serve over it 1 cup of 
white sauce.

AMERICAN SWEET CORN 

Sweet corn on the cob, which has been picked within 
twenty-four hours of the time of using, should be dropped 
into rapidly boiling, slightly salted water, and boiled not 
more than eight or ten minutes. 

ROAST CORN 

To roast sweet corn, leave the husks on the cob, and 
put in a slow oven and let bake for half an hour. Take 
off the husks and silk and serve at once. Some think this 
method of cooking the delicate American vegetable re- 
tains the flavour of the corn more than the usual way of 
boiling it. 

CORN PUDDING 

Use 6 or 7 ears of sweet corn, and cut each row down 
the middle with a sharp knife, and then cut the grains 
from the ear, and add to them 2 cups of milk, 1 teaspoon 
of salt, 1 saltspoon of pepper, 1 teaspoon of sugar, 1 table- 
spoon of melted butter, and 2 slightly beaten eggs. Put 
this into a baking dish and bake like a custard, in a slow 
oven for half an hour, taking care it does not cook too long 
nor get too hot lest it curdle. Canned corn may be used 
when fresh is out of season.

then scrape out the potato and chop it into small bits. 
Boil 2 ears of green corn for ten minutes, run a sharp 
knife down each row of grains, cutting them in two, and 
then cut the corn from the cob and mix it with the chopped 
sweet potato. Butter six individual gratin dishes and fill 
them with the mixed corn and potato, sprinkle them with 
salt, pour 1 tablespoon of melted butter over each, cover 
with bread crumbs, and let cook for eight or ten minutes 
in the oven. The same mixture can be used to fill a baking 
dish, and enough melted butter used to moisten the potato 
thoroughly. 

STEWED CUCUMBERS 

Peel 4 or 5 cucumbers, quarter them, and cover them 
with boiling salted water, and let them cook from twenty 
to thirty minutes; then drain, saving the water in which 
they were cooked. Make a sauce of 2 tablespoons of 
butter and 2 tablespoons of flour rubbed together, and 2 
cups of the water in which the cucumbers were boiled, 
stir until smooth, and when it boils add the juice of 1 
lemon, 1 teaspoon of salt, and some paprika ; arrange the 
cucumbers on slices of toast and serve with the sauce 
poured over them.

KOHLRABI 

These are very nice if used young, when not much 
larger than an egg. Parboil them for half an hour, cut 
them in half, and put them in a frying pan containing 
melted butter, and fry for fifteen or twenty minutes. Serve 
over them the butter in which they were cooked, and 
dredge with salt and pepper. The time required to cook 
kohlrabi depends largely of course upon the age at which 
it is picked. 

KOHLRABI AU GRATIN 

Slice kohlrabi, boil twenty minutes or until nearly tender, 
and arrange iri a baking dish in layers with cream sauce. 
Season each layer with pepper and salt, sprinkle the top

then drain again. Put 2 tablespoons of butter into a 
saucepan, and when melted ada 1 large onion finely 
chopped ; cook over a very slow fire for ten minutes, then 
add the lentils and 2 scant cups of boiled rice, and stir all 
together with a large fork until very hot ; dredge well with 
salt and pepper before serving. 



GERMAN LENTILS 

Cover 2 cups of lentils with cold water and let them 
soak two or three hours; drain them and put them in 
boiling salted water with 1 leek (or 1 onion) and let them 
cook half an hour, or until tender but not broken. Put 2 
tablespoons of butter in a frying pan, and when melted 
stir into it 2 tablespoons of flour, and let brown ; then add 
2 finely chopped onions and 2 or 3 tablespoons of vinegar 
and 2 tablespoons of the water in which the lentils cooked. 
Mix this sauce with the drained lentils, put them in a 
double boiler with salt, pepper, and a dash of nutmeg, 
and serve after they have steamed slowly for fifteen 
minutes. 



LEEKS 

Cut leeks into three-inch lengths, using the tender green 
part as well as the white ; wash the pieces thoroughly in 
cold running water, then put them in a smail saucepan 
and cover them with boiling salted water, and let them 
boil for twenty minutes. 

Make a sauce by melting 1 tablespoon of butter and 
thickening it with 1 tablespoon of flour, and then adding, 
1 tablespoon at a time, enough of the water the leeks were

114 Golden Rule Cook-Book 



cooked in (about 1 cup) to make the sauce of the right 
consistency ; season with pepper and salt, drain the leeks, 
and serve the sauce over them. 



MUSHROOMS 



Mushrooms should only be used when perfectly fresh 
and firm ; in peeling them take a small knife, and, holding 
the delicate fringe at the edge of the mushroom between 
the edge of the knife and the thumb, peel the paper-like 
skin off, pulling it toward the centre of the mushroom. 
The stems should be cut or broken off without breaking 
the cup, and if sound should be scraped and used. When 
the mushrooms are white and small and freshly picked 
they can be quickly washed and used without peeling. 

STEWED MUSHROOMS 

Peel about 1 pound of mushrooms, put them in a sauce- 
pan with 2 tablespoons of butter, 1 saltspoon of pepper, 
1 teaspoon of salt, and \ cup of milk, into which 1 table- 
spoon of flour has been mixed; cover and let cook for 
five or six minutes, then add 1 cup of cream, stir all well 
together, replace the cover, and let cook gently for ten 
minutes. These mushrooms can also be cooked and 
served in an Italian casserole. 



GERMAN STEWED MUSHROOMS 

Peel 1 pound of mushrooms and put them in a saucepan, 
sprinkle with the juice of 1 lemon, add 1 cup of milk, 
cover, and let simmer gently for ten minutes. Thicken 



Vegetables 115 

with 1 heaping teaspoon of flour dissolved in a little milk, 
and add 1 tablespoon of butter and a grating of nutmeg, 
and let simmer gently for ten minutes more before serving. 
Instead of lemon juice and milk a cup of sour cream is 
often used in Germany, and is an acceptable substitute. 



MUSHROOM AND CHESTNUT RAGOUT 

Use an equal quantity of peeled mushrooms and boiled 
Italian chestnuts, and heat in a rich brown sauce. Serve, 
garnished with toast, or in cases, or use in a deep pie with 
a top crust of biscuit dough. 



MUSHROOMS NEWBURG 

Peel 1 pound of mushrooms, cover them with 2 cups of 
milk, and let them simmer gently for ten minutes. Lift 
the mushrooms out with a strainer, and make a sauce of 
the milk by adding 1 tablespoon of flour, 1 tablespoon 
of butter, the beaten yolks of 2 eggs, 1 wineglass of sherry, 
and some salt and paprika. When the sauce thickens 
replace the mushrooms in it, let them heat for two 
minutes, and serve on toast or in patty cases. 



BAKED MUSHROOMS ON TOAST 

Select as many large mushrooms as are required, and, 
after peeling them, lay each one, cup upw^d, on rounds 
of toast wmch, after toasting, have been dampened by 
being plunged quickly into not water; place the toast 
with the mushrooms upon it into a shallow buttered pan, 
put a little bit of butter in the cup of each mushroom, 



1 1 6 Golden Rule Cook-Book 



sprinkle with salt and pepper, cover with anotherpan the 
same size, and let cooik eight or ten minutes. Serve at 
once, with a garnish of parsley or watercress. 

GRILLED MUSHROOMS 

Peel or wash the mushrooms, and put them, cup up- 
ward, on a fine wire broiler and let them broil over a hot 
fire for five or six minutes, putting a pinch of salt in each 
cup. As soon as hot, remove them from the broiler and 
serve on hot plates, taking care not to spill the juice which 
has formed in the cups. Garnish with watercress or 
parsley. 

MUSHROOMS SUR CLOCHE 

Place carefully cleaned mushrooms, cup upward, on 
individual gratin dishes, salt each, and place a bit of butter 
in the cup, and set in a hot oven for ten minutes. To 
serve, place over each a glass "bell," which can be bought 
for this purpose. The heat is thus retained in the mush- 
rooms during service. 

MUSHROOMS IN CASSEROLE 

Put into a French or Italian casserole \ cup of good 
butter, and when melted stir into it | of a pound, or a 
pound, of peeled mushrooms, and dredge well with pepper 
and salt. Corer the casserole and set it in the oven ; after 
five minutes' cooking stir the mushrooms, mixing them 
well with the butter, replace the cover, and repeat the 
process in another five minutes; let cook ten minutes 
more, and serve from the casserole on rounds of toast.

FILLED MUSHROOMS 



Select 10 of the largest, most cup-shaped from 1^ 
pounds of mushrooms. Peel and lay in a shallow pan, 
cup side up. Take the cleaned stems and the remaining 
mushrooms and chop fine and put them in the cups ; add 
1 teaspoon of melted butter, some pepper and salt to each, 
and let bake ten minutes or until done. Serve on toast 
garnished with watercress, or under the glass bells already 
mentioned. 



MUSHROOMS WITH TRUFFLES 

Toss truffles in butter in a hot frying pan for five min- 
utes, sprinkle the cups of mushrooms with pepper and salt, 
fill them with the truffles, and cook for ten minutes in a 
covered pan in a hot oven ; serve on crisp lettuce leaves, 
with parsley butter. 



MUSHROOMS WITH PEAS 

Fill the cups of large mushrooms with French canned 
peas, which have been tossed for five minutes in hot butter. 
Season and set in a covered pan in a hot oven for ten 
minutes, and serve on toast with white or brown sauce, as 
preferred. 

MUSHROOMS WITH ONIONS 

Peel 2 medium-sized onions and chop them fine, and 
put them in a casserole, or saucepan, with 1 tablespoon of 



1 1 8 Golden Rule Cook-Book 



melted butter. Let them cook slowly for ten minutes, then 
add 1 pound of mushrooms, which have been carefully 
washeci or peeled, and another tablespoon of butter, and 
cover, letting cook for ten minutes. Season well with salt 
and pepper and serve very hot. 

Mushrooms thus prepared may be put in a deep baking 
dish, covered with crust and baked in a pie. 



MUSHROOMS WITH EGG 

Put 2 tablespoons of butter in a porcelain casserole, or 
in a saucepan, and when melted put with it 1 pound of 
peeled or washed mushrooms; let simmer gently for ten 
minutes, then add to them 2 hard-boiled eggs, cut in 
slices, and half a cup of cream. This recipe also is avail- 
able for a deep pie; put in a baking dish, cover with 
crust, and bake until slightly browned. 



CANNED MUSHROOMS 

Drain the mushrooms from 1 can, and cut them in half. 
Use the liquid from the can augmented with water, if 
necessary, to make brown or German sauce. Put the 
mushrooms in a saucepan with the sauce, season with 
pepper and salt, and serve very hot on toast. 

Button mushrooms can also be cooked by simply 
draining and tossing in parsley butter until hot; season 
with salt and pepper and serve on toast. 

Mushrooms cooked in these ways are suitable for filling 
peppers or tomatoes. Canned mushrooms can be bought 



Vegetables 119 



which are put up with truffles, and add variety to these 
different dishes. 



CANNED MUSHROOMS CZARINA 

Open a can of button mushrooms, drain them, and cut 
the buttons in half, if very large, and reserve the liquid. 
Put 1 tablespoon of butter in a saucepan, and when melted 
add 1 tablespoon of grated onion, 2 bay leaves, 2 cloves, 
2 peppercorns, and 2 allspice. Let all cook together slowly 
for five minutes, then pour on the liquid from the mush- 
rooms, with enough milk added to make 2 cups, season 
with salt, and let simmer for ten minutes; then add 1 
tablespoon of flour creamed with 1 tablespoon of butter, 
let bou up once, and strain. Put the sauce and the button 
mushrooms in an Italian casserole, set this in the oven to 
heat for five minutes, and serve from the dish on triangles 
of toast. 

MUSHROOM LOAF 

Pour good clear, well-strained boiling vegetable stock 
onto dissolved vegetable gelatine or arrowroot, using 
about 1 tablespoon to every 2 cups of liquid. Season 
well with salt and pepper, and add 1 can of button mush- 
rooms, halved, when the jelly is somewhat set so that they 
will remain in place evenly dispersed. Line a mould with 
chopped parsley and slices of pickled walnuts, pour the 
jelly into it, and serve, when set, ice-cold, with any 
savoury cold sauce or pickles. A few chopped nuts may 
be added if desired.

STEWED OKRA 

Cut the ends oflf the pods of young okra, boil for one 
hour in salted water, then drain and reheat in a saucepan 
with some melted butter. 

The okra can be used as a garnish to boiled rice. 
Canned okra needs only to be boiled five minutes, drained, 
seasoned, and tossed about in hot butter in a frying pan 
for two or three minutes before serving. 



OKRA AND GRILLED TOMATOES 

Cut good firm tomatoes in half, season well and broil, 
then serve with a garnish of stewed okra. 



STEWED OKRA WITH TOMATO SAUCE 

If fresh okra is used prepare as in stewed okra recipe, 
and if canned okra is used drain and heat in boiling salted 
water. Put 1 tablespoon of butter in a frying pan, and 
when melted lift the okra from the boiling water and 
place it in the frying pan ; season well with salt and pepper 
and then cover with 1 cup of tomato sauce, and, when 
thoroughly heated through, serve.

pepper and dotted with butter. Cover the top with fine 
crumbs and cook for fifteen minutes, or until browned, 
in the oven. 



BOILED ONIONS 



Peel onions under cold water and they will not bring 
tears to the ,eyes. They should then be put in rapidly 
boiling water, and this changed after the first five minutes 
of cooking; then put in fresh boiling water, salt added, 
and cooked for from half an hour to forty minutes. If 
onions are not covered when boiling the odour will be less 
noticeable. 

Serve boiled onions with parsley butter, or, after drain- 
ing, cover with milk, add butter, pepper, and salt, and let 
boil up once before serving. 



CREAMED ONIONS 

Use onions which have been boiled until tender but not 
broken, and, after draining, serve with white or parsley 
sauce, made with equal quantities of milk and the stock in 
which the onions cooked. 



BOILED ONIONS WITH BROWN SAUCE 

Serve small boiled onions, which have cooked until 
tender, but not broken, with any hot sauce, â€” tomato, 
brown, mushroom, etc. 



12 2 Golden Rule Cook-Book 



ONIONS AU GRATIN 

Prepare as for creamed onions, making a white sauce of 
the milk, or milk and water, in which the onions have 
been boiled. The onions can be left whole, or somewhat 
broken up in the sauce. Fill a buttered baking dish with 
onions and sauce, dust the top with grated cheese, and let 
heat in the oven five or six minutes. The bottled Parmesan 
cheese is convenient, but is never as delicate to the taste as 
fresh cheese grated. 



ONIONS WITH CHEESE 

Arrange boiled onions, which are not broken at all by 
boiling, m a buttered baking dish, baste well with melted 
butter, and dredge with grated cheese, and set in the oven 
a few moments to brown ; serve in the same dish or remove 
to a small platter and garnish with green, or use as a 
garnish to a dish of other vegetables. Mashed potatoes 
piled high (browned on top with salamander or under 
flame in gas oven) surrounded with these onions makes an 
attractive dish. 

ESCALLOPED ONIONS 

Escalloped onions are made like Onions au Gratin, 
except that the cheese is omitted and replaced by a layer 
of fine bread crumbs. 



BAKED ONIONS WITH CHESTNUTS 

Peel as many onions as required and parboil them for 
ten or fifteen minutes in salted water. Drain and dry, and 



Vegetables 123 



when cooled somewhat remove the inside and fill with 
chopped chestnuts which have been tossed in hot butter 
for fifteen minutes ; season well with salt and pepper, and, 
if liked, a little sage ; arrange in a buttered baking dish, 
and bake for half an hour, covering them for the first 
fifteen minutes. If they seem too dry, baste with a little 
cream or onion stock and melted butter. 



ONION SOUFFLE 

Put 1 tablespoon of butter in a saucepan, and when 
melted add 1 tablespoon of flour, stir until smooth, and 
then add gradually 1 cup of milk, and season with paprika 
and salt. Let boil, then add \ cup of stale bread crumbs, 

1 teaspoon of chopped parsley, \\ cups of cold boiled 
onions chopped fine, and the yolks of 2 eggs well beaten. 
Mix thoroughly, then add the stiffly beaten whites of the

with a fork. Put in a buttered baking dish, or in individual 
cases, sprinkle fine crumbs on top, and bake about fifteen 
minutes to slightly brown before serving.

ONION AND TOMATO ESCALLOP 

Place alternate layers of fresh onions, sliced, and fresh 
tomatoes in a buttered baking dish, covering each layer 
with crumbs, butter, pepper and salt. Put 1^ cups of 
water over and bake for about an hour in a slow oven. 
Or use boiled onions and canned tomatoes, dampen with 
the juice from the tomatoes, and cook twenty minutes. 



ONIONS BEATRICE 

Fill a large bean-pot (or a high earthenware covered 
jar marmite) with small Bermuda onions, two inches in 
diameter. The onions should be left whole, but a sharp 
knife can be used to make two cuts in the shape of a cross 
in the top of each, as this insures the cooking of the centre. 
While arranging the onions in the jar, sprinkle them well 
with salt, also with black pepper (or use \ dozen pepper- 
corns instead), put in 3 bay leaves, and distribute 1 tea- 
spoon of mixed nerbs. Cover with hot water, put the lid 
on, and set on the back of the stove or in a slow oven. The 
onions should not cook to pieces, and with the proper heat 
will be cooked through in about two hours; this time is 
named not as a rule out as a guide. Serve in the mar- 
mite in which they were cooked. 



STUFFED ONIONS 

Boil the onions fifteen or twenty minutes and then 
remove the hearts, leaving the outsides as cases for a 
filling. Make the stuflSng of bread or cracker crumbs 
mixed with the chopped centres of the onions, plenty of 



Vegetables 125 



salt and pepper, and a little chopped tomato (or tomato 
sauce), or some chopped green peppers, or canned pimen- 
tos, or use both tomato and peppers. Fill the onion cases, 
and arrange in a buttered baking dish; sprinkle with 2 
tablespoons of melted butter, set the pan in water, and 
bake naif an hour; the baking dish should be covered 
until the last five minutes, and the onions should not be 
allowed to go dry ; more butter can be added, or a little 
hot water or vegetable broth, if they cook dry. Serve in 
the baking dish, or remove to a small platter and garnish 
with sprigs of parsley. 

FRIED ONIONS 

Peel the onions and cut into thin slices, and when a 
generous tablespoon of butter has slowly melted in a frying 

gan, put the onions in and let them simmer over as low a 
re as will keep them cooking; stir them frequently and 
serve when transparent and turning a golden brown. 

Fried onions can be served alone or as a garnish to 
heaped up mashed potatoes. They are saved from their 
extreme commonplaceness by being arranged in a gratin 
dish, not over an inch high, dusted with a sprinkling of 
crumbs or grated cheese, and given three or four minutes 
in the oven. 

FRENCH FRIED ONIONS 

Peel medium-sized onions, and slice crosswise carefully; 
then separate the slices into rings. Drop these into smok- 
ing vegetable fat or oil, and let fry four or five minutes until 
cnsp and a rich brown. Lift with a strainer onto brown 
paper to drain a moment before serving. 



126 Golden Rule Cook -Book 



ONIONS IN POTATO CRADLES 

Make potato cradles as directed, dredge with salt, and 
fill with fried or French-fried onions. 



SMALL ONIONS 

Peel small, round, pickling onions, parboil them ten 
minutes, drain, roll in flour, and fry in deep fat. Serve as 
a garnish to other vegetables or in stews. 



GLAZED ONIONS 

These are nice used either as a garnish to another dish 
(vegetable croquettes, mashed potatoes, etc.) or alone. 
Small onions should be used, or onion hearts, and taken 
from the water before they are quite cooked ; then put in an 
enamelled pan in which is 1 tablespoon of butter which 
has been slowly melted; toss them about in this, and 
sprinkle with powdered sugar. When they begin to 
brown add 1 tablespoon of the water in which they were 
boiled, and as this is taken up add a little more, and pepper 
and salt. The onions will be browned and glazed. Serve 
very hot. 

ONIONS AND APPLES 

Put 1 tablespoon of butter in a frying pan, and when 
melted put in 3 sliced onions and 3 sliced apples ; let fry 
slowly until browned, and serve on toast.

BOILED PARSNIPS IN SAUCE 

Wash and scrape 6 or 7 parsnips, cut them in half, length- 
wise, and put them in cold water for half an hour. Drain 
them, ana put them in a saucepan of boiling water con- 
taining 1 teaspoon of salt, and let them boil for about three 
quarters of an hour. While they are finishing cooking, 
prepare a sauce with 1 tablespoon of butter and 1 table- 
spoon of flour rubbed together, and put in a saucepan over 
a slow fire. When melted and smooth add, a spoonful 
at a time, some of the stock in which the parsnips are 
cooking, until about 2 cups have been used ; stir until well 
thickened but not paste-like, season with salt and pepper, 
and pour over the parsnips after draining them. 

PARSNIPS IN BUTTER 

Scrape and wash the parsnips, and cut them in eighths, 
lengthwise, and then in half. Put them in boiling water, 
salt well, and let them cook for about three quarters of 
an hour. Drain and serve with \ cup melted butter poured 
over them, which contains 1 tablespoon of chopped parsley. 

FRIED PARSNIPS 

Slice cold boiled parsnips lengthwise, dredge with salt, 
and fry in buttered pan or griddle until a golden brown, 
turning with a pancake turner. 

FRENCH FRIED PARSNIPS 

Use cold boiled parsnips, cut in any shape desired, â€” 
balls, or long strips, â€” and put them in a frying basket, 
and fry in hot fat until brown. Drain, and dredge with 
salt to serve. 



12 8 Golden Rule Cook-Book 



BROILED PARSNIPS 

Use boiled parsnips, cut each in 3 slices, lengthwise, 
dip in melted butter, broil until brown, and sprinkle with 
salt before serving. 



GREEN PEAS 



Newly picked green peas should be shelled and put in 
a double-boiler with a little salt, and 1 teaspoon or more 
of sugar, and no water. Cover closely and keep water 
in under pan boiling for about three quarters of an hour. 
Add a little butter before serving. 



GREEN PEAS PAYSANNE 

Cook peas as in the above recipe adding a few lettuce 
leaves which have been washed and cut in strips. Drain 
them before adding butter and salt. 



CANNED PEAS 

Canned peas should be slowly cooked in their own stock 
for ten minutes, drained, and seasoned with butter, pepper 
and salt, and a little milk or cream added to them. 



CANNED PEAS WITH ONION 

Put 1 tablespoon of butter in a saucepan, and when

for five minutes, then add 1 can of peas, drained of their 
juice, and | of a cup of cream or milk ; season well with 
salt and pepper, and serve after ten minutes' slow cooking. 



STUFFED PEPPERS 



Slice the stem-end from sweet peppers, cut out the 
insides, and fill with a mixture made of 1 cup of fine 
crumbs, 1 grated onion, \ cup of chopped nuts, 1 teaspoon 
of salt, and 2 tablespoons of melted butter. Set in a pan 
containing a little water and melted butter, and bake from 
twenty minutes to half an hour, basting occasionally. 

Peppers can be parboiled for ten minutes before stuffing, 
but though softer they lose their colour to some extent. 



PEPPERS STUFFED WITH MUSHROOMS 

Cut the stem-end from sweet peppers, remove the inside, 
and fill with mushrooms Czarina, or mushrooms in tomato 
sauce, and bake twenty to thirty minutes, basting with 
a little butter and water, which should be in the pan in 
which they are cooked. 



PEPPERS WITH RICE 

Cut the stem-end from sweet green peppers, remove the 
inside, fill with boiled rice and chopped tomato in equal 
proportions, and season well with pepper and salt. A 
few chopped mushrooms, olives, or boiled eggs may be 
added to the filling. Bake from twenty to thirty minutes, 
basting with butter and water.

PEPPERS WITH CORN 

Cut a slice from the end of sweet peppers, remove the 
inside, and fill with canned corn, well salted ; replace the 
ends and bake. 

Peppers, like tomatoes, may be filled in so many ways 
that it is useless to endeavour to enumerate them, for the 
ingenious cook can multiply them without end. 

ESCALLOP OF PEPPERS AND CORN 

Cut enough sweet corn from the cob to make 3 cups. 
Take 2 or 3 sweet green peppers and remove the insides, 
then slice them in veiy thin circles and arrange a layer of 
the corn in a buttered baking dish, salt it, and then place 
some rings of the peppers, then another layer of corn, and 



Vegetables 131 

so on, until the dish is filled, finishing the top with peppers. 
To a cup of cream (or milk) add 1 beaten egg and 2 
tablespoons of melted butter; pour this over the whole, 
and bake for half an hour in a hot oven. Canned corn may 
be used, in which case less cream will be needed. 



FRIED PEPPERS 

Remove the seeds from 6 sweet green peppers, cut the 
pods in squares about half an inch across. Put 1 table- 
spoon of butter in a fiying pan, and when melted add 1 
sliced onion, and let simmer for two or three minutes; 
then put into the pan the cut-up peppers, and fry for ten 
minutes. Add \ cup of brown or tomato sauce and serve 
on toast with boiled rice, or on flat rice cakes. 



CREAMED PIMENTOS 



Put the pimentos from 1 can into 2 cups of white sauce, 
and let cook in a double boiler for ten minutes. Add 1 
tablespoon of chopped parsley, some pepper and salt, and 
serve on toast. 

ROLLED PIMENTOS 

Remove the pimentos from the can, and with a sharp 
knife cut them open on one side and open them out. 
Arrange the flat pieces thus made on a large plate or 
board, with the inner part up, and spread with finely 
chopped onion, sprinkle with salt and celery salt, and roll 
into firm rolls. Place these in a well-buttered tin, add a 



132 Golden Rule Cook- Book 



little hot water, cover, and set in a hot oven for ten minutes ; 
then uncover, add 1 tablespoon of butter, and when it 
melts baste the pimentos with it. Let them cook five 
minutes more, and serve with the melted butter poured 
over them, or with parsley butter. 



PIMENTOS WITH OKRA 

Split the pimentos with a sharp knife, salt the inner part, 
then roll each around a pod of freshly boiled or canned 
okra. Place in a well-buttered pan, add A little hot water, 
and let cook ten minutes covered, and five uncovered. 
Add more butter during the last five minutes, baste the 
rolls, and serve with the butter poured over them, or with 
tomato sauce. 



PIMENTOS WITH TOMATO 

Lay the large flat pimentos from a can on a platter, and 
slide into each a slice of tomato which has been sprinkled 
with salt and celery salt. Fry in a covered pan for five 
minutes, and serve plain or with caper sauce. 



POTATOES 



Between the good cooks who contend that a potato is 
never properly boiled" if it is boiled at all, and those who 
either cook potatoes in a steamer, or put them in cold water 
which is carefully watched to see that it does not actually 
boil, cooking thus until the potatoes are tender, and those 
who drop them into rapidly boiling salted water, letting 



Vegetables 133 

them boil hard until done, there is wide latitude for in- 
dividual preference. I would advise those who do not 
have potatoes served on the table which are white and 
floury and thoroughly cooked through, to see that one of 
the above-mentioned ways of cooking potatoes is carried 
out in their kitchens, rotatoes put in boiling water, or 
put in a covered steamer over rapidly boiling water, will 
cook in from twenty minutes to half an hour, the time 
depending, of course, upon the size and age of the potatoes ; 
they should always be carefully scrubbed and cooked in 
their skins, and peeled afterwards. 



MASHED POTATOES 

Having boiled or steamed the required number of 
potatoes, peel them as expeditiously as possible and break 
them up in a hot saucepan ; mash and then beat them 
vigorously with a wooden spoon or a fork, add a generous 
piece of butter, dredge with salt and a little pepper, and 
beat them until they are light ; then moisten slightly with 
a very little hot milk or cream, beat them for a moment 
more, and serve very hot. 



POTATO SOUFFLE 

Put into a saucepan 3 or 4 cups of warm mashed potato 
and 1 tablespoon butter. Add the yolks of 2 eggs, 2 table- 
spoons cream (or milk), salt and pepper, and stir over 
fire until well mixed. Remove from the fire and add the 
well-beaten whites of the eggs. Heap in a buttered baking 
dish and let brown on the top in the oven. 



134 Golden Rule Cook - Book 



MASHED POTATO SOUFFLE IN CASES 

Select large potatoes, scrub them and let them bake until 
mealy, which will be in from half an hour to three quarters, 
then cut them in half, lengthwise, and carefully scrape out 
the potato, laying aside the skins to use as cases. Mash 
the potatoes with a wire potato-masher, add 1 tablespoon 
of butter for every 5 potatoes used, and season well with 
salt and pepper. Beat the whites of eggs very stiff, allow- 
ing 2 to every 5 potatoes, and mix them lightly through 
the potato with a fork; fill the potato skins with the 
mixture, heaping them full; brown them slightly in the 
oven before serving, and garnish the dish on which they 
are served with sprigs of parsley. Five potatoes will fill 
6 or 7 cases. 



RICED POTATOES 

Break up well-boiled dry potatoes with a fork, dredge 
with salt and pepper, and press through a sieve or a so- 
called "ricer" into a hot serving dish. 



RICED POTATO FRITTERS 

Boil 6 large potatoes, press them through a sieve, and 
add 3 lightly beaten eggs, 2 teaspoons of flour creamed 
with 1 tablespoon of butter, 1 teaspoon of salt, and 2 cups 
of milk. Beat well together, and drop from a large spoon 
into deep, hot fat ; they will rise to the top a light brown 
when done. Chopped chives or chopped parsley may be 
added to the mixture if desired. 



Vegetables 135 



MASHED POTATOES WITH ONION 

To 4 or 5 cups of mashed potato add 1 cup of boiled 
onion minced to a pulp, 1 tablespoon of butter, 1 table- 
spoon of cream, some pepper and salt; beat lightly to- 
gether, and before serving brown the top for a moment 
m the oven. 

BAKED POTATOES 

Select potatoes of uniform size, scrub them well, place 
in a hot oven until they yield to pressure of the fingers, 
which will be in most cases in about three quarters of an 
hour. They should not stand after baking, and should be 
served in an open dish. A baked potato that is worked 
with the fingers while being turned in the hand a few times, 
becomes light and soft. 



ROAST POTATOES 

Pare small, round potatoes, and lay them in cold water. 
Put 2 tablespoons of butter in a shallow baking pan, and 
let it melt in the oven; then wipe the potatoes, and lay 
them in the pan, rolling each in the hot butter. Let them 
cook in a moderate oven from one half to three quarters 
of an hour, and baste them during the cooking five or six 
times with the butter. Sprinkle with salt before serving. 

DENVER POTATOES 

Peel several smooth oval potatoes and cut in half, length- 
wise. Dig out a small hole in the centre of the smooth 
side, and level the rounded parts so they will sit evenly. 



136 Golden Rule Cook- Book 

Put a lump of butter in each, and place in a pan with a 
little water, first dredging with salt and pepper, and bake 
about twenty-five minutes or until browned. 

BROILED POTATOES 

Cut cold boiled potatoes lengthwise into quarter-inch 
slices, dip each in flour, and lay in a folding broiler. Broil 
until evenly browned on both sides, sprinkle with salt and 
pepper, and serve on a hot *dish with a bit of butter on 
each, or as a garnish to other vegetables. 

FRIED POTATOES SOUFFLE 

Peel and trim the required number of potatoes to a 
uniform size, cut both ends straight across, and then slice 
the potatoes into slices about 3*5 of an inch thick, and drop 
them into cold water for about half an hour, and then 
dry them with a cloth. For the frying two kettles of fat 
are necessary, one of which must be perfectly fresh ; drop 
the potatoes into the used fat or oil and let them fry until 
about half done ; but do not let them brown at all ; drain 
them thoroughly and let them get cold. Five or six 
minutes before they are to be served drop them into the 
fresh fat which should be almost smoking, move them 
about lightly with a fork, and they will puff out to a 
considerable size; let them become a golden brown, put 
them in the oven on brown paper for a moment, and serve 
instantly. 

WHOLE POTATOES FRIED 

Use very small new potatoes, and, after boiling them, 
roll in eg'g and cracker crumbs, and fry in hot, deep fat. 
Use alone or as a garnish to baked tomatoes. 



Vegetables 137 



FRENCH -FRIED POTATOES 

Peel potatoes which are of medium size and cut into 
even eighths, lengthwise, and then let them lie in cold 
water for fifteen minutes ; then dry them between the folds 
of a clean cloth, and put in a frying basket. Immerse 
slowly in hot fat, and fry until a golden brown ; drain at 
once, and dredge with salt. 



SARATOGA CHIPS 

Cut potatoes into thin slices with a potato cutter, lay in 
cold water twenty minutes, dry, and fry in deep, hot fat

POTATOES PARISIAN 

These are cooked exactly like French-fried potatoes, 
except that the little vegetable cutter, which cuts tiny 
globes of potato, is used to form the shapes. Some care 
must be taken to use strength enough with the cutter to 
make it cut perfectly round balls. 



POTATO STRAWS 

Peel 4 or 5 potatoes and then cut them with a patent 
vegetable cutter in strings ; lay them in very cold water for 
twenty minutes, drain, and put in a frying basket, and 
slowly immerse in hot fat, and let them fry until a golden 
brown. Drain, and dredge with salt before serving.

season with pepper and salt and add the sliced potatoes, 
and let these fry slowly, turning with a knife until they are 
a golden brown ; season afresh with pepper and salt, and 
add 1 tablespoon of finely chopped parsley before serving. 
These potatoes will take a great deal of salt and pepper. 



GERMAN FRIED POTATOES 

Put 1 tablespoon of butter in a frying pan, and when 
melted add 5 or 6 cold boiled potatoes cut in slices, season 
highly with salt and pepper, fry until done, which will be

BOILED SWEET POTATOES 

As the skin of sweet potatoes does not come off well 
after cooking it is best to peel them before baking or 
boiling. 

Select large sweet potatoes, put them in boiling water, 
and let them boil from half to three quarters of an hour. 
Peel them and arrange them in a hot dish, with ^ cup 
of melted butter poured over them. 



BAKED SWEET POTATOES 

Wash and peel the sweet potatoes and put them in the 
oven. A medium-sized potato will take about forty 
minutes to bake. 



MASHED SWEET POTATOES 

Peel and boil 6 or 7 sweet potatoes, drain off all the 
water, and then mash with a wire potato-masher in the 
saucepan in which they were cooked ; mix with them while 
hot 2 tablespoons of good butter, and dredge generously 
with salt, and serve very hot. 



SWEET POTATO SOUFFLE 

Mix with mashed sweet potatoes when slightly cooled 
the beaten yolks of 2 eggs and then the stiff whites of the 
eggs. Heap in a buttered baking dish and let brown in 

the oven.

ESCALLOPED SWEET POTATOES 

Slice what will make 4 or 5 cups of cold boiled sweet 
potatoes, butter a baking dish, and arrange a layer of 
potatoes in the bottom, making it an inch thick. Sprinkle 
with salt, pepper, and dot well with butter. Then arrange 
another layer, proceed as before, and so on until the dish 
is filled. Then pour over all \ cup of water in which 2 
tablespoons of sugar are dissolved. Put the dish in the 
oven, and in ten minutes baste with 2 tablespoons of water. 
Let cook five minutes more or until browned on top. 



STUFFED SWEET POTATOES 

Bake in their skins the number of potatoes required, cut 
them in half, scoop out the inside, and mix with chopped 
celery, and minced onion, and melted butter, allowing 1 
tablespoon of celery and \ teaspoon of onion to each 
potato. Season with salt and pepper, refill the skins, 
and let brown in the oven. 



SOUTHERN SWEET POTATO PIE 

Bake 4 large sweet potatoes, then scrape the inside from 
them, and beat into it lightly with a fork 2 tablespoons of 
butter, 2 tablespoons of sugar, 3 well-beaten eggs, 1 cup

TEXAS SWEET POTATO PIE 

Boil 4 or 5 sweet potatoes for half an hour or until 
cooked. Line a large baking dish with pie-crust, slice the 
potatoes lengthwise while still hot, and put a layer of 
them on the crust, and cover this with long strips of pastry. 
Sprinkle with sugar, dot with butter, and add a little nut- 
meg ; then place another layer of potato, and another of 
pastry, and so on, until the dish is nearly filled. Pour on 
enough boiling water to almost fill the dish, and cover 
the top with pastry like any deep pie, cutting it here and 
there to let the steam escape. Bake for about twenty 
minutes, or until the crust is a little browned. 

MARYLAND SWEET POTATOES 

Peel 6 or 8 medium-sized sweet potatoes, quarter them 
lengthwise, and lay them in a large saucepan having 
rounded sides. Add to the potatoes 2 heaping table- 
spoons of butter, and 3 heaping tablespoons of granulated 
sugar, and 2 or 3 tablespoons of water, and stir until the 
sugar and butter are dissolved. Cover closely and let 
them cook for four or five minutes undisturbed, then stir 
again with a wooden spoon, being careful to see that the 
syrup is not sticking on the bottom, re-cover, and from 
now on let cook only a couple of moments at a time 
before again stirring. The water will of course soon cook 
away; let the potatoes cook rapidly in the hot syrup 
until they begin to soften, then put them where the fire is 
less hot, and let them cook slowly until done. The entire 
cooking should not take more than fifteen or twenty min- 
utes, and the thick brown sauce should be thoroughly 
scraped from the saucepan and served over the sweet 
potatoes.

SPINACH 



Spinach should be well picked over, leaf by leaf, and 
washed in several different waters, and changed to a 
different pan each time it is washed, that the sand may be 
left behind with each washing. Then put it in a large 
kettle, with a scant cup of water for a peck of spinach, and 



Vegetables 151 



let it cook over a slow fire until tender ; in this way its own 
juices will be extracted, and it will be more tasty than if 
cooked in water. It should be then drained and chopped 
extremely fine, or until as nearly a pulp as possible, and 
then mashed in a mortar or with a potato-masher. It is 
then ready to prepare in any way desired for the table. 

Delicious spinach can be had canned, and if this is used 
it needs only to be very finely chopped and mashed, then 
seasoned, and prepared in any of the following ways. 

GERMAN SPINACH 

Melt 1 tablespoon of butter in a saucepan, and in it let 
simmer for ten minutes 1 good-sized onion that has been 
finely chopped, then add 4 cups of the boiled, chopped, 
and mashed spinach to it, and stir well together, and season 
thoroughly with salt and pepper ; finish with J teaspoon of 
grated nutmeg, and 1 or 2 tablespoons of whipped cream, 
and pile high in a heated dish, covering the top with the 
chopped whites and riced yolks of 2 hard-boiled eggs. 

SPINACH WITH WHITE SAUCE 

Prepare as in the above recipe, using, instead of the 
cream, ^ cup of highly seasoned white sauce, and at the 
last add the juice of 1 lemon or 1 tablespoon of reduced 
vinegar. 

GERMAN SPINACH WITH RHUBARB 

Another German way of preparing spinach is to cook 
rhubarb leaves or flowers (or both) with the spinach for 



152 Golden Rule Cook-Book 

the puree and to add chives. If canned spinach is used 
the rhubarb leaves should be cooked and chopped and 
added to the canned spinach before it is macerated. 



ITALIAN SPINACH 

Wash \ peck spinach and cook twenty-five minutes 
without water. Drain, chop to a fine pulp, mash until 
smooth in a mortar, season with 1 tablespoon of butter, 
salt and pepper, and encircle with a garnish of well- 
scrambled eggs to which has been added 2 tablespoons of 
grated cheese. 

NOVELTY SPINACH 

Drain a can of spinach and chop it very fine, and then 
mash it until smooth. Put it in a saucepan with 1 table- 
spoon of chopped chives or grated onion, salt and pepper, 
and sprinkle the whole surface well with grated nutmeg. 
Hard boil 3 eggs, remove the yolks, and mix them 
thoroughly with the spinach. Chop the whites, and 
arrange the spinach on rounds of toast, placing 2 table- 
spoons on each piece, garnish with the whites of the eggs, 
and pour on each 2 tablespoons of cheese sauce. If the 
arrangement on toast is not desired, the cheese sauce can 
be mixed with the spinach before serving it. 



SPINACH SOUFFLE 

Take 2 cups of cooked chopped spinach, mash to a 
pulp, add 1 cup of white sauce and the whites of 2 eggs 
beaten very stiff, season well, and pile lightly in timbale

Vegetables 159 



TOMATOES CASINO 

Select large, solid tomatoes, and without cutting them 
let them boil for fifteen minutes ; then slip off the skins, 
halve them, and lay each piece, cut-side down, on a round 
of toast the same size as the tomato. Cover the top with 
warm HoUandaise, Bernaise, or Maitre d'hotel sauce, and 
in the centre lay a slice of truffle ; garnish with watercress. 



TOMATOES INDIENNE 

Halve large, solid tomatoes, and arrange them in a shal- 
low pan, cut-side up. Dredge with salt and pepper, and 
spread with curry powder and some onion juice. Put in

powder can be omitted from the filling and the tomatoes 
served with curry sauce if preferred. 

SAVOURY TOMATOES 

Cut in half rather large, solid tomatoes, allowing 2 halves 
for each person to be served, and set them, cut-side up, 
in a shallow tin ; press capers into the spaces, then dredge 
heavily with celery salt, sprinkle with salt and pepper, and 
set under the flame of a gas oven until the tops are black- 
ened. The flame should be hot so that this may happen 
as quickly as possible in order that the tomatoes may not 
become softened by the heat ; to this end it is also necessary 
to leave the door of the broiling compartment open. 

TOMATOES CREOLE 

Cut in half, crosswise, 5 or 6 solid tomatoes, and set 
them, cut halves upwards, in a buttered pan. Chop 1 or 2

water to stiffen it. The amount of gelatine cannot be 
given, as the various vegetable gelatines, arrowroot, etc., 
vary in thickening power. Instructions as to the proper 
amount for each pint of liquid will come with every pack- 
age. Set the jelly aside to cool, and arrange slices of hard- 
boiled egg on the bottom of custard cups or small plain 
moulds, and encircle these with slices of stuffed olive, 
pickled walnut, or truffles, or mushrooms. When the 
jelly is somewhat cooled, and so thick enough to hold 
down these garnishings when poured onto them, half 
fill the cups with it. Serve when set and ice-cold, turned 
out on lettuce leaves. 



TOMATOES AND HOMINY 

Take 2 cups of cold boiled hominy and 2 cups of boiled

green peppers (carefully seeded), 5 fresh tomatoes, 1 cup 
of boiled beets (| a can), and 2 raw onions. 

Put 2 tablespoons of butter in a frying pan, and when 
melted add the chopped onions, and let simmer slowly for 
five minutes, then add the tomatoes and let simmer an- 
other five minutes, then put in the potatoes, the peppers, 
and the beets. Dredge well with salt and pepper, and, 
stirring occasionally, let all cook slowly until the juices are 
nearly absorbed; then let the hash brown on the bottom, 
and turn out with the brown on top. Garnish with squares

VEGETABLE STEW 

Put 4 tablespoons of butter in a large saucepan, and 
when melted add to it \ cup of sliced onions, \ cup of 



170 Golden Rule Cook -Book 

diced carrots, 1 cup of shredded celery, and \ cup of turnips 
cut in oblong pieces, and toss them in the butter for fifteen 
minutes ; then pour over them 6 cups of cold vegetable 
broth or water, add 1 teaspoon of salt, 2 bay leaves, 6 
small onions halved, 4 carrots cut in quarters, 6 small 
squares of turnip, and let simmer slowly for half an hour ; 
then add 5 potatoes cut in half, and let cook for half an 
hour more, and add more vegetable broth to keep the 
vegetables covered. Make dumplings, and drop into the 
boiling stew, cover tightly, and cook ten minutes more; 
season well with salt and pepper, and serve with enough 
of the stock, thickened with a little flour and butter, to 
cover. 

VEGETABLE CASSEROLE 

In order that this dish should taste and appear at its 
best, it should be cooked and served in an Italian casserole 
dish from eight to ten inches in diameter. Peel 8 medium- 
sized onions, and take the layers off until a centre about 
three quarters of an inch in diameter is left; toss the 
centres in hot butter until browned, and chop the outside. 
Cut 3 medium-sized sweet green peppers in half, length- 
wise, and fill each half liberally with a mixture of bread 
crumbs, chopped tomato, chopped onion, and salt and 
pepper. Stuff 6 solid, medium-sized tomatoes in any of 
the ways described under stuffed tomatoes. Put 2 table- 
spoons of butter in a saucepan, and when melted add to it 
2 tablespoons of chopped onions ; fry these for ten minutes, 
then stir in 2 tablespoons of flour, and use vegetable stock 
or milk, 2 cups of either, to make a sauce ; add 1 bay leaf, 
and enough soup-browning to make a rich colour. Put the 
stuffed peppers in a casserole dish with the glazed onion

hearts and the sauce, cover, and let cook for ten minutes ; 
then arrange the stuffed tomatoes in the casserole, dis- 
tribute among them \ can of button mushrooms, halved, 
\ can of flageolets or peas, and leave the cover off the dish, 
letting it cook for fifteen minutes very slowly. This casse- 
role can be varied in many ways, using different filling for 
the peppers and tomatoes, and either truffles, string beans, 
or fresh mushrooms in the sauce, which should not be too 
thick. 

VEGETABLE RAGOUT 

Prepare for boiling what will make 3 cups of turnip 
when cut in inch squares, \\ cups of potatoes, and \\ cups 
of carrots. Put the carrots into slightly salted and sweet- 
ened water, let boil for ten minutes, then add the turnips 
and potato, and cook for ten minutes more. Put 2 table- 
spoons of butter in a saucepan, and when melted add 2 
tablespoons of chopped onion, and fry until slightly 
browned ; then add 2 tablespoons of flour, stir until smooth, 
and pour slowly into this 2 cups of the stock in which the 
vegetables cooked ; then add 2 teaspoons of sugar, 1 tea- 
spoon of salt, \ teaspoon of pepper ; and the diced vegeta- 
bles ; cover, and let simmer slowly for half an hour, then 
add 1 tablespoon of chopped parsley, and serve. 



BORDEAUX PIE 

Slice enough Spanish onions to fill a cup \ full, and fry

minutes ; hard boil 4 eggs, and make 1 cup of white sauce. 
Cut the vegetables in small pieces, slice the eggs, add \ 
cup of canned peas (or fresh boiled ones), 1 teaspoon of 
chopped parsley, salt and pepper well, put in a little 
grated nutmeg and 1 teaspoon of lemon juice, and mix all 
carefully with the white sauce. Line a large baking dish 
(or small individual ones) with thin crust, fill with the 
mixture, cover the top with crust, and bake until slightly 
browned. 

NEW ORLEANS STEW 

Slice 3 onions, and fry them in 1 large tablespoon of 
butter for five minutes ; then add to them 3 chopped sweet 
green peppers, stir well, and let cook together another five 
minutes ; then scrape the contents of the frying pan into a 
double boiler, add the corn cut from 3 ears of sweet corn 
(or \ can of corn) , and 3 sliced tomatoes, 1 cup of water, 
1 teaspoon of salt, 1 teaspoon of sugar, and let all cook 
together for one hour; season afresh before serving, 

INDIAN CURRY 

Put 2 tablespoons of butter in a frying pan, and add to 
it when melted 2 onions chopped fine, and let cook very 
slowly for fifteen minutes. Mix 1 tablespoon of curry 
powder, 1 tablespoon of sour apple, or tamarind-chutney 
chopped fine, 1 teaspoon of salt, and enough vegetable 
stock to make a paste. When the onions are browned add 
this paste, and after stirring well put in 1 cup of boiled 
haricot beans, 1 cup of halved boiled chestnuts, and 1 can 
of halved button mushrooms, and let all simmer together 
for ten minutes. Have ready some stock made by putting 



Vegetable Combinations 173 

2 tablespoons of desiccated cocoanut into a bowl and 
pouring over it 1 cup of boiling water, and use this to 
dampen the cooking vegetables ; then add 1 cup of vege- 
table broth, and let cook ten minutes more. We westerners 
are fond of this served in this way with chutney, but in 
India they press it through a strainer and serve it as a 
puree, adding to it 2 well-beaten eggs. Encircle with rice 
in serving. 

CURRY OF LENTILS 

Soak 2 or 3 cups of German or Egyptian lentils for two or 
three hours ; drain them, and put them in boiling water, 
and let them cook for three quarters of an hour or until 
tender but not broken. Salt well when they have been 
cooking a short time, and when done drain them, sprinkle 
with salt, and heap in a pyramid on a round flat dish; 

garnish with 3 hard-boiled eggs cut in half, encircle with 
oiled rice, and pour curry sauce over the lentils only. 
Serve extra sauce m a sauce-boat and Indian chutney. 



CURRY OF SUCCOTASH 

Heat 1 can of Lima beans and 1 can of sweet corn, and 
when hot drain, and heap on a flat dish ; cover with curry 
sauce, and serve with potato croquettes and Indian 
chutney. 

CREOLE CURRY 

Boil 1 cup of rice, and while it is cooking put 2 cups of 
okra, 2 cups of tomato, and 2 small onions cut in halves, 
and 1 teaspoon of butter in a double boiler, and when hot 
add 1 cup of hot water, into which has been dissolved 1 



174 Golden Rule Cook- Book 

heaping teaspoon of curry powder, and let all cook 
together for half an hour; remove the onions, add the 
rice, season generously with salt, and serve with Indian 
chutney. 

VARIOUS VEGETABLE CURRIES 

Almost any vegetable makes a good curry, â€” flageolets, 
carrots and peas, button mushrooms, etc., and either 
boiled rice or rice croquettes should be served. A garnish 
of Spanish pimentos looks well, and the curry sauce should 
be plentiful. Hard-boiled eggs halved are always nice 
with curry, and Indian chutney should be served with it.

tality of animals in 'Our Ani- 
mal Friends,' Charles Wagner 
says, 'Can that which comes 
from Life return to Chaos? â€” 
Can a work of God have an 
end? 



NUT DISHES 



ITALIAN CHESTNUTS 

Chestnuts can be cooked either by roasting or by boil- 
ing. If roasted, the thin brown that clings to the nut is 
removed with the outer shell; if boiled, the inner skin 
often has to be removed with some trouble. Roast chest- 
nuts by putting them in a hot oven for eight or ten min- 
utes, then use a small, sharp knife and peel them from 
the point down. 

To boil chestnuts put them, in their shells, in cold 
water and let them cook for five or six minutes after the 
water starts boiling, or put them in boiling water for ten 
or twelve minutes. Peel carefully, and serve after roast- 
ing or boiling with brown sauce or mushroom sauce, 
plain or in cases. 

CHESTNUT PUREE 

Roast or boil 6 cups of Italian chestnuts, remove the 
shell and inner skin and chop them fine or put them 
through a vegetable mill. Put them in a double boiler 
with milk enough to cover them and let them cook slowly 
for fifteen or twenty minutes, or until the milk is all ab- 
sorbed. Stir frequently, add 1 tablespoon of butter, 1 
tablespoon of cream, plenty of salt and a little pepper. 
The puree should be the consistency of mashed potato.

178 Golden Rule Cook-Boo k 



PEANUT PUREE 

Shell 3 or 4 cups of peanuts, remove the inner skin, and 
put through a vegetable mill. Piit in a double boiler with 
milk to cover them, season with salt, and let cook gently 
half an hour, or until tender. Stir frequently, and serve 
when the milk is absorbed and the peanut puree is the 
consistency of mashed potato. A tablespoon of whipped 
cream is an improvement if added during the last moments 
of cooking. 

MICHAELMAS LOAF 

Mix 1 cup of finely ground walnuts (or other nuts), 
1 cup of finely ground roasted peanuts, 1 teaspoon of 
salt, 1 saltspoon of pepper, 2^ cups of fine bread crumbs, 
1 tablespoon of mixed sweet herbs (thyme, sage, and 
summer savory), and 1 large onion or 2 small ones chopped 
fine. When well blended bind together with 2 eggs which 
have been slightly beaten, mould with the hands into a 
loaf, place in a well buttered roasting tin, and let it cook 
for ten minutes in a moderately hot oven; then add 
1 tablespoon of butter and 1 cup of hot water, and baste 
frequently during half an hour's cooking. The loaf 
should be well browned and carefully removed to a hot 

{)latter. Make a brown sauce in the pan in which the 
oaf cooked, and serve with this and cola apple sauce. 



CHRISTMAS LOAF 

Make as in foregoing recipe, omitting the chopped 
onion and adding another half tablespoon (or even more) 
of the sweet herbs. Serve with cranberry sauce. 



Nut Dishes 179 



ROAST NUT AND BARLEY LOAF 

Make a brown sauce with 2 tablespoons of olive oil, \ 
cup of browned flour, and use water or vegetable stock for 
thinning ; chop 1 large onion fine, and fry it in 1 tablespoon 
of oil or butter, and mix the onion and the sauce with 2 
cups of cold boiled pearl barlev, 1 cup of finely ground 
roasted peanuts, 1 cup of fine bread crumbs, 1 teaspoon 
of salt, and 1 saltspoon of pepper. With the hands mould 
into a loaf, place in a roasting pan which has been well 
buttered, and let cook in the oven for ten minutes ; then 
add 1 tablespoon of butter and 1 cup of hot water, and 
baste every five minutes for half an hour. Make a brown 
sauce in the same pan, or serve with Caper sauce. Garn- 
ish, if brown sauce is used, with English savoury 
croquettes. 

STEAMED NUT AND BARLEY LOAF 

Make as in the foregoing recipe, but pack into a mould, 
set this in boiling water, and let it steam for an hour and 
a half or two hours. Let cool in the mould, and turn out 
to serve cold, or to slice, or to use for nut hash. 

A brick-shaped mould will be made by any tinsmith 
to order, or the large sizes of baking-powder tins can be 
used to steam loaf. 



ROASTED NUT LOAF WITH HOMINY 

Grind 2 cups of nuts, â€” pecans, walnuts, roasted 
peanuts, etc., or use peanuts only, â€” and mix with them

hard-boiled eggs chopped fine, 1 tablespoon of chopped 
parsley, 1 tablespoon of grated onion, and 1 raw egg. 
Form into 1 large roll, or several smaller ones, put in a 
buttered tin, and let bake in a quick oven for half an 
hour;^ baste with a little butter and water a few times. 
Garnish with slices of lemon, and serve with brown 
sauce. This loaf may be steamed as directed for barley 
loaf and used hot, cold, or in hash. 



NUT AND FRUIT LOAF 

Chop mixed nuts enough to make 2 cups, and add to 
them 6 bananas chopped fine and J teaspoon of salt ; mix 
well together, and press into a plain mould. Stand the 
mould in a steamer, and let it steam for three hours. Serve 
ice-cold, sliced, with pickles or catsup. 



FOUNDATION LOAF 

This loaf can be made and kept in readiness for use, as 
it will remain fresh for several days if it is left in the covered 
mould in which it cooked and is kept in a cool place. 
Put 2 cups of water in a saucepan, and when the water 
boils stir into it 1 cup of a finely ground cereal, preferably 
gluten flour or meal, or Scotch oatmeal, and stir until 
thick ; then add 2 teaspoons of salt, ^ teaspoon of pepper, 
1 tablespoon of butter, and 1 cup of shelled peanuts which 
have been put through a vegetable grinder twice. Pack 
the mixture into a loaf-shaped mould, or large round tin 
with a tight-fitting lid, almost immerse it in water, and 
let it steam for two hours. Use when cold, either for 



Nut Dishes i8i 



nut hash or croquettes, or with an equal amount of 
bread . crumbs and the seasoning to make Michaelmas 
or Christmas loaf. 

NUT HASH 

Use cold steamed nut loaf and the same amount of 
cold boiled potatoes. Chop the potatoes and the loaf 
separately, and add to them, after mixing, \ as much 
chopped onion. Turn into a firing pan which contains 
melted butter well covering the bottom, dredge with salt 
and pepper, and stir frequently with a knife during the 
first ten minutes' slow cooking ; then let the hash brown 
on the bottom, shaking the pan vigorously from time to 
time, season afresh, and turn out with the browned por- 
tion on top. One or 2 chopped green peppers can be 
added to the hash, if the flavour is liked.

These His adorers were before 

The Kings and Shepherds thronged the door. 

And where no Angels knelt there kneeled 
The innocent creatures of the field.

and 1 tablespoon of butter, put in a saucepan, and when 



2 24 Golden Rule Cook- Book 

melted and smooth add ^ cup of milk and J of the nuts ; 
let cook slowly two or three minutes, add another ^ cup 
of milk and the remaining nuts. Salt well, and add a little 
pepper; let cook very slowly, and when the sauce is the 
proper thickness stir in 1 tablespoon of thick cream. 

The sauce can be darkened with brown colouring, or by 
browning the thickening flour in butter. 

ONION SAUCE 

Chop 4 onions very fine and brown them in 3 table- 
spoons of butter ; add 1 tablespoon of flour, let this brown 
also, and thin with 1 cup of broth or water or milk. Add 
pepper and salt, and beat 1 egg-yolk into it before serving. 
Serve either strained or unstrained. 

PARSLEY BUTTER 

Put butter in a saucepan, and when melted add finely 
chopped parsley and some salt, using 1 teaspoon of parsley 
to every tablespoon of butter used. Serve on boiled 
potatoes, asparagus, etc.

Sauces 225 



PIQUANT SAUCE 

Put 4 tablespoons of vinegar in a saucepan with 1 
tablespoon of chopped shallots or onions, and kt cook 
slowly until only 1 tablespoon remains; add to this 1 
cup of Spanish sauce, and when at boiling point put in the 
sauce 2 teaspoons of minced sour pickles, 1 teaspoon of 
chopped parsley, and some salt and pepper; serve with 
croquettes or vegetables. 

SAUCE RAVIGOTE 

Ravigote is merely the name applied to the mixture of 
herbs combined with flavouring for this sauce. These are 
chives, cress, burnet and chervil, in equal proportions. 
Use 2 tablespoons of the mixed herbs, scald them in tarra- 
gon vinegar, drain them, chop them fine, and add them 
to 1 cup of plain mayonnaise. 

SAUCE ROBERT 

This is made by adding to 1 cup of Spanish sauce 2 
tablespoons of white wine, 1 teaspoon of onion juice, and 
1^ teaspoons of mustard mixed with 2 teaspoons tarragon 
vinegar. Season, and make hot in a double boiler, letting 
all cook slowly together ten minutes. 

SPANISH SAUCE 

This is a rich sauce which is used as a basis for many 
sauces, and can be made at a leisure time and used any 
time within a few days. Any stock in which vegetables 
have been cooked may be used, but the best one is made as 

15 



2 26 Golden Rule Cook -Book 



follows : Wash 4 or 5 cups of red beans or lentils, and after 
soaking them in 2 quarts of water for ten hours or more 
empty them with the same water into a saucepan, and put 
with them 3 onions halved, 3 sprigs of parsley, 1 cup of 
carrots quartered, J cup of diced turnips, 1 tablespoon of 
salt, 2 stalks of celery cut in short lengths, and a small bag 
containing 1 teaspoon of thyme, 2 bay leaves, 6 cloves, 
6 whole peppers, and 1 teaspoon of allspice berries. Let 
boil hard for one minute, then set on the stove where it 
will simmer slowly for two hours. Strain the broth 
through a fine sieve, and use the vegetables in a stew, a 
deep pie, or a curry. To finish the Spanish sauce put 2 
tablespoons of butter in a saucepan, and when melted stir 
into it 2 tablespoons of flour and let brown, stirring con- 
stantly ; then add a little stock at a time until about 2 cups 
have been used and the sauce is the consistency of thick 
cream. Darken with 1 teaspoon of brown colouring, add 
1 tablespoon of sherry, and pepper and salt. 

SPINACH SAUCE 

Put 1 cup of freshly cooked or canned spinach, from 
which the juice has been pressed, into a basin or mortar, and 
chop or mash to a pulp. Melt 1 tablespoon of butter in a 
saucepan, add to it 1 small onion chopped fine, let cook 
slowly for five minutes, then add the spinach, and let cook 
for ten minutes more. Put 1 cup of milk into a double 
boiler with 1 bay leaf, 1 stalk of celery (or some celery 
seed) , and when it boils add 1 tablespoon of flour blended 
with 1 tablespoon of butter ; season with salt and pepper, 
and when thickened stir the spinach into this, sprinkle 
with grated nutmeg, and let cook together for ten minutes. 
Press through a sieve before serving. 



Sauces 227 



SAUCE TARTARE 



Make a plain mayonnaise sauce (see Salads), and to 
each cup add 1 teaspoon of gherkins and 2 teaspoons of 
capers, both very finely minced ; sprinkle a little cayenne 
on the sauce before serving. 



TOMATO SAUCE 

Use 6 fresh tomatoes, and after washing them slice 
them, skins and all. Put 1 tablespoon of butter in a sauce- 
pan, and when melted add 2 tablespoons of finely chopped 
onion, let cook slowly for five minutes, then put with 
them the tomatoes, 2 bay leaves, 1 clove of garlic, 1 tea- 
spoon of sugar, some pepper and salt, and let cook gently 
for fifteen minutes ; then strain, pressing through a sieve, 
and return the liquid to the fire to simmer until reduced 
to the proper consistency. 



TOMATO SAUCE WITH OTHER VEGETABLES 

Make tomato sauce, using with it chopped celery, 
chopped peppers, or chopped mushrooms, which have 
been fried for ten minutes in hot butter and added after 
the sauce is strained. 



TOMATO SAUCE WITH NUTS 

Chop 2 tablespoons of blanched nuts, fry them for ten 
minutes in 1 tablespoon of melted butter, and add these to 
strained tomato sauce. 



228 Golden Rule Cook-Book 



TOMATO SAUCE WITH EGG 

To each cup of strained tomato sauce add 2 hard-boiled 
eggs chopped fine. 



SAUCE VINAIGRETTE 

To each cup of French dressing add 1 tablespoon of 
minced onion and 1 tablespoon of macerated parsley. 



WHITE SAUCE 

Put 2 tablespoons of butter in a saucepan, and as soon as 
it is melted stir into it slowly 3 tablespoons of flour, using 
1 tablespoon at a time, then add slowly 2 cups of warm 
vegetable stock or milk, stirring all the while; then add 
f of a teaspoon of salt, 1 saltspoon of pepper, and cook 
slowly for five minutes, stirring constantly ; add 1 table- 
spoon of butter, and stir for another minute. Some flour 
thickens more than others, and if the sauce seems to thick, 
thin with a little cream or milk. 

White sauce may be varied in many ways by using onion 
juice, mushroom catsup, chopped chives, etc. 

The white sauce may be made in a double boiler. Put 
the milk in the top receptacle, and when boiling add the 
flour dissolved in a little cold milk, then the butter, etc., 
and let cook ten minutes or until thickened.

EGGS 



BOILED EGGS 



<GGS are very palatable when put in boiling water and 
cooked for three or three and a half minutes, but some 
cooks recommend that "boiled eggs" should never boil, 
but instead, be placed in a large saucepan which is filled 
with water that has boiled and just been removed from the 
fire. The instructions are to cover the saucepan closely 
after putting the eggs in the water, and let it stand on the 
back of the stove, the eggs to be removed in ten minutes 
if wanted soft, and in twenty minutes if liked well set. 
Hard-boiled eggs are certainly more palatable cooked in 
this way than when boiled for ten minutes in the ordinary 
way. 

FRIED EGGS 

Put a little butter into a small frying pan, and when 
melted break an egg into a saucer, and slide it carefully 
into the hot butter, and let it fry until the white is thoroughly 
set, cooking as many as are required, separately, in the 
same way. If a tight cover is put over the frying pan 
when the egg is put in, the yolk of the egg will be as pink 
as a nicely poached egg when done. Season with pepper 
and salt before serving. A little Worcestershire sauce or 
walnut catsup heated in the pan and poured over fried 
eggs adds variety. 



232 Golden Rule Cook-Book 



POACHED. EGGS 

Fill a deep frying pan | full of hot water, and stir into it 
one teaspoon of vinegar and 1 teaspoon of salt. When 
the water reaches boiling point break the eggs carefully 
one by one into it, remove the pan from the intense heat, 
cover it, and let the eggs cook until the whites are firmly 
set. If the water is shallow the eggs will spread and be 
more flat, in which case the boiling water must be dipped 
up over the yolks with a spoon to make them pink ; if the 
water is deep the eggs will be more round than flat. When 
the eggs are done lift them carefully from the water with a 
perforated strainer in order to drain off the water 
thoroughly, and serve them on hot toast. 



POACHED EGGS WITH GRAVY 

Poach eggs and serve them with Sauce Bernaise, or 
any piquant sauce. 



POACHED EGGS INDIENNE 

Poach the number of eggs required, and after placing 
them on toast pour over them a thin curry sauce. 



EGGS WALDORF 

Place nicely poached eggs on toast, and fit a freshly 
cooked mushroom as a cap over each yolk. Surround the 
toast with brown sauce containing quartered mushrooms. 



Eggs 



233 



SCRAMBLED EGGS 



Break six or more into a bowl, beat them lightly with a 
fork, and pour them into a frying pan into which 1 table- 
spoon of butter has been melted; stir continually over a 
very slow fire until they are well set, seasoning them 
meanwhile with pepper and salt, and adding another \ 
tablespoon of butter in small pieces during the cooking. 
Serve with a garnish of small triangular pieces of toast. 
One tablespoon of cream can be added to the eggs before 
serving if desired. Eggs may be scrambled with milk, 
using ^ cup of milk to 4 eggs, and then proceeding as 
above. 

SCRAMBLED EGGS WITH CHEESE 

Make plain scrambled eggs, and when nearly set add 
2 tablespoons of grated cheese for every 6 eggs used, and 
1 tablespoon of chopped parsley. Serve on toast. 

SCRAMBLED EGGS WITH MUSHROOMS, PEAS. ETC. 

Scramble 6 eggs, and two or three minutes before re- 
moving from the fire add to them a can of button mush- 
rooms cut in slices, lengthwise, and 1 tablespoon of finely 
chopped parsley. In the same way peas, tomatoes, as- 
paragus tips, chopped sweet peppers, etc., can be used. 

SAVOURY SCRAMBLED EGGS 

Prepare plain scrambled eggs, and just before taking oflF 
the fire add 2 tablespoons of chopped chives (or green 
stems of young onions or shallots can be used instead), 
and J a tablespoon of finely chopped parsley; serve on 
hot toast. 



2 34 Golden Rule Cook- Book 



SCRAMBLED EGGS INDIENNE 

Make plain scrambled eggs, and just before serving 
stir into tnem 1 tablespoon of cream, into which has been 
stirred 1 teaspoon of curry powder and \ teaspoon of onion 
juice. Serve on hot toast. 



SPANISH EGGS 

For 6 eggs use 1 large tomato and 1 small onion. Chop 
the onion fine, and fry it five minutes in 1 tablespoon of 
butter; then add the chopped tomato, and stir another 
minute over the fire. Now pour in the eggs and scramble 
them, adding 1 teaspoon of salt and a saltspoon of pepper. 
Garnish with small triangles of toast. 



SHIRRED EGGS 

Butter individual gratin dishes, and break into them 1 
or 2 eggs as desired. Season with salt and pepper, and a 
sprinkling of finely chopped parsley, and put into the oven 
for five minutes, or until the eggs are set. Place each dish 
on a small plate with a paper doily. 

SHIRRED EGGS WITH TOMATOES 

Use as many shallow, individual gratin dishes as there 
are persons to be served, and, after buttering each dish, 
break into it 1 egg, taking care not to break the yolk. 
Halve some small tomatoes, and set one half, cut side up, 
in each dish ; season the whole with pepper and salt, and 
set in the oven for ten minutes or less. 



Eggs 



235 



GRIDDLED EGGS 



Heat a griddle and butter it slightly, and break upon 
it 3 or 4 eggs, disturbing the yolks so as to break them. 
When a little browned on one side turn them with a cake- 
turner and fry the other side. 



PLAIN OMELET 

Put 3 or 4 eggs in a bowl and beat them ten or twelve 
times with a fork vigorously. Put 1 scant tablespoon of 
butter in a frying pan, and as soon as melted turn in the 
eggs and shake over a slow fire until they are set ; season 
with salt and pepper, turn the omelet together as it is let 
to slide from the pan, and place on a hot dish. Make 
several small omelets rather than one large one, and place 
on white paper doilies, and garnish with parsley to serve. 
The trick of shaking an omelet is the secret of making a 
good one, and the egg mixture should be not over ^ an 
inch deep in the pan. 



OMELET SOUFFLE 

Take 4 to 6 fresh eggs, separate the yolks and whites, 
and beat each until as light as possible. Butter a deep 
frying pan, mix the yolks and whites lightly together with 
a fork, and put in the hot frying pan, smoothing somewhat 
with a fork to level. Season the top with pepper and salt, 
and shake over a slow fire until the omelet is delicately 
browned on the bottom ; turn it together and serve on a 
hot platter. 



236 Golden Rule Cook- Book 



HERB OMELET 

Make like plain omelet, stirring with every 4 eggs used 
1 teaspoon each of powdered thyme, or sweet marjoram, 
sage, chopped onion tops or chives, and parsley. 



CHEESE OMELET 

For omelet souffle made with 6 eggs add \ cup of grated 
cheese to the yolks of the eggs, and \ cup to the beaten 
whites before putting them together. 

In making plain omelet with cheese add \ cup of cheese 
to 4 eggs after they are in the omelet pan. Sprinkle with 
grated cheese to serve, and garnish with watercress or 
parsley. 

RUM OMELET 

Make an omelet souffle, put on a hot dish, and pour ^ 
cup of heated rum around it, and light it with a match. 
Rum is easily made to blaze if a teaspoon is fflled with it 
and a lighted match held under the tip of the spoon. The 
rum on the platter can then be easily lighted with that in 
the spoon. 

BAKED OMELET SOUFFLE 

Beat the whites of 6 eggs very stiff and the yolks of 3. 
Mix the whites and the yolks, using a fork ; then stir in 
the juice of half a lemon and 3 tablespoons of powdered 
sugar. Heap in a buttered baking dish, and cook in a hot 
oven about fifteen minutes. 



Eggs 



237 



EGGS CARMELITE 



Prepare 1 cup of very finely chopped boiled spinach by 
adding to it 1 teaspoon of butter and 1 saltspoon of grated 
nutmeg, and put where it will keep warm. Hard boil 6 
or 8 eggs, then cut each carefully in two, lengthwise ; re- 
move the yolks and stir them into the spinach, mashipg 
them well, and mashing all together until the yolks are 
thoroughly mixed with the spinach ; then season with salt 
and pepper and neatly fill the halves of the whites of the 
eggs with the spinach. Make a sauce with 2 cups of milk, 
1 teaspoon of butter, and 2 tablespoons of flour, a dash of 
paprika, and 1 cup of grated cheese. When this has thick- 
ened arrange 2 or 3 halved eggs in each individual gratin 
dish, and pour around them some of the sauce, and set 
in the oven five minutes to make thoroughly hot, or serve 
on a large dish garnished with small triangular pieces of 
toast. 

EGG WITH MASHED POTATO 

Use a long, narrow gratin dish, and arrange cold mashed 
potato in it in ridges with a spoon, and make three or four 
hollows in the surface. Into each of these break an egg, 
and let ail bake in the oven until the eggs are set. Tomato 
or white sauce can be served with this. 



EGGS NEWBURG 

Hard boil 6 eggs, plunge them into cold water for a 
moment, then peel, and when cooled, so they will not 
crumble in cutting, cut them in half. Have ready a sauce 
made of 1 cup of cream (or milk) and 3 tablespoons of 



238 Golden Rule Cook-Book 

butter, to which when hot is added 2 tablespoons of sherry, 
2 tablespoons of brandy (the latter may be omitted), 1 
saltspoon of pepper, and 1 teaspoon of salt. Let cook 
three minutes, then beat in vigorously the beaten yolks of 
4 eggs, stir until thickened, add a dash of paprika, and 
serve over the hard-boiled eggs on toast. 

EGGS LYONNAISE 

Put 2 tablespoons of butter in a frying pan, and when 
melted add 1 finely chopped onion, and let simmer slowly 
for eight or ten minutes ; then add 1 tablespoon of flour, 
and stir well until smooth. Add to this ^ cup of milk, ^ 
teaspoon of salt, and ^ saltspoon of pepper, and let cook 
three or four minutes only. Pour into a deep gratin dish, 
and break upon it 6 eggs ; sprinkle with ^ cup of bread 
crumbs, and let cook in a moderate oven about five 
minutes, or until the eggs are set. Serve in the same 
dish. 

DEVILLED EGGS 

Hard boil the number of eggs required, halve them, and 
serve on toast with devilled sauce. 

JAPANESE EGGS 

Hard boil the number of eggs required, and, after halv- 
ing them, remove the yolks, and mix them with a little 
butter (using 1 tablespoon to 6 eggs), pepper, salt, and a 
little tomato chutney or Harvey sauce. Refill the halved 
whites with this, and use the eggs to garnish 2 cups of 
boiled rice. Pour over all 1 cup of white sauce or parsley 
sauce to serve. 



Eggs 



239 



GOLDEN ROD EGGS 



Hard boil 5 eggs, take off the shell, and separate the 
yolks from the whites, chopping the whites fine and press- 
ing the yolks through a sieve, keeping whites and yolks 
separate. Put 1 cup of milk in a double boiler, and when 
it boils add to it 1 tablespoon of butter and 1 tablespoon 
of cornstarch which have oeen rubbed together, and when 
the sauce has thickened season it generously with pepper 
and salt, and stir into it the chopped whites of the eggs. 
While the sauce is cooking prepare 5 rounds of toast, and 
place them on a hot dish. Cover each piece of toast A\dth 
a layer of white sauce, sprinkle this with a layer of the 
yolks, then more of the white sauce, and the remainder 
of the yolks, season with salt and pepper, and stand in 
the oven a moment or two before serving. 



FROTHED EGGS 

Separate the yolks and whites of as many eggs as are 
required, putting each yolk in its shell or in a separate 
dish. Beat the whites until very stiff, and fill a well- 
buttered custard cup half full of the white of egg ; make 
a hole in the centre, sprinkle with salt, pepper, and lemon 
juice, and drop a yolk in each cup. Put in a shallow pan 
of boiling water with a cover on it, and when the eggs 
are set turn out onto buttered toast. Garnish with pars- 
ley butter. 

FRIED STUFFED EGGS 

Hard boil 6 eggs and halve them carefully, removing 
the yolks. Put the yolks through a sieve, and rub to a 



240 Golden Rule Cook-Book 



paste with 1 tablespoon of melted butter, salt, pepper, 
and \ cup of cream or milk, using a little at a time, so as 
not to use it all unless needed to make the mixture of the 
right consistency for refilling the halved whites. Care- 
fully fill the places made vacant by the removed yolks, 
roll the half-egg in beaten egg and crumbs, and fry in 
deep, hot fat. Serve with 2 cups of white sauce, and add 
to it 2 tablespoons of diced pickled beets, which makes 
the sauce pink. 

This same effect may be had to some extent by simply 
using hard-boiled eggs, frying them, and serving with same 
sauce or white sauce, to which 1 tablespoon of capers has 
been added. 

SWISS EGG TOAST 

Melt 1 tablespoon of butter on a shallow or flat dish, 
and sprinkle over it \\ tablespoons of grated cheese ; then 
break into the butter 3 eggs, taking care not to break the 
yolks. Sprinkle well with salt and pepper and 1^ table- 
spoons of grated cheese mixed with 2 teaspoons of finely 
chopped parsley. Bake in the oven until the eggs are 
set, then cut each egg out round with a cutter, and serve 
on rounds of toast. 

EGGS CAROLINA 

To serve four persons hard boil 6 eggs, then put them 
in cold water for one minute, peel 2 of them, chop the 
whites, and mix with melted butter and 1 tablespoon of 
chopped parsley, and form into nests on 4 pieces of hot 
"corn bread." Then peel the other 4 eggs, and arrange 
one on end in each nest. Pour a little parsley butter on 
each, and season with salt and pepper.

and serve with a sauce made of vinegar to which is added 
salt and dry mustard. 



EGGS IN MARINADE 

Hard boil the eggs required, then remove the shells, and 
stick 4 cloves in each egg. Put 2 cups of vinegar on to boil, 
and rub together a little vinegar, ^ teaspoon of mustard, 
^ teaspoon of salt, and ^ teaspoon of pepper, and stir into 
the boiling vinegar. Place the eggs in a glass jar, and pour 
the boiled vinegar over them. They can be used in a 
fortnight, halved or sliced as a garnish or in salads. 



EGGS PARISIENNE 

Butter as many timbale moulds as are required, and dust 
the inside with chopped parsley ; then break into each an 
egg, and sprinkle with salt and pepper. Set the moulds 
in water in a shallow pan, and place m the oven until well 
set or hard. Turn out onto a flat dish, or on individual 
dishes, and with them serve bread sauce, or any sauce 
desired. 

EGGS PERIGORD 

-Butter small moulds or cups, then sprinkle them with 
chopped parsley, and on the bottom (which will be the top 
when they are turned out) place a symmetrical pattern 
made of cut beets and truffles or pickled walnuts. Drop 

16 



242 Golden Rule Cook-Book 



one egg into each mould, dredge with salt and pepper, and 
set the moulds in a pan of boiling water; cover, and let 
cook until firm. Turn out onto rounds of toast, and serve 
with a hot tomato sauce, or any savoury sauce. 

EGGS WITH CHEESE 

Into a shallow round or oval gratin dish, or small indi- 
vidual dishes, put melted butter to cover the bottom, and 
encircle the outer edge with thinly sliced, rather dry, 
cheese ; inside this break enough eggs to cover the bottom 
of the dish, taking care not to break the yolks. Season 
with salt and pepper, and put into the oven until the 
whites of the eggs are thoroughly set. 

EGGS MORNAY 

Drop eggs into a buttered baking dish, and then cover 
them with a highly seasoned white sauce to which some 
egg-yolks have been added (using 1 yolk to each \ cup of 
sauce), also salt and paprika. Sprinkle the top with grated 
cheese, and put in the oven to bake until the egg is firmly 
set. 

CREAMED EGGS 

Butter a shallow dish, pour into it 1 scant cup of milk, 
and let heat. When hot cover the surface with eggs, cover, 
and let poach on top of stove until set ; sprinkle with celery 
salt, and then cover with cream, and set in the oven for 
five minutes. Sprinkle the top with finely chopped celery 
tops to serve. This may be cooked in one large dish or 
in individual gratin dishes. 



Eggs 



243 



EGGS OMAR PASHA 



Butter individual gratin dishes, and break 2 eggs into 
each, taking care not to break the yolks. Slice small 
onions so the separate rings are unbroken, and place a 
circle of these rings on the eggs around the edge of the 
dish. Sprinkle with salt and pepper, then with grated 
cheese, and bake in a slow oven until the eggs are thor- 
oughly set. 

TURKISH EGGS 

Butter one large gratin dish or several small ones, break 
into them enough eggs to cover the bottom, taking care not 
to break the yolks; put them in a moderate oven until 
the whites are quite set, and then garnish by putting a few 
tablespoons of boiled rice on the eggs around the edge of 
the dish, alternating with button mushrooms, which have 
been cut in thin slices and mixed with brown sauce. 
Season with salt and pepper just before serving. 

EGGS BEURRE-NOIR 

These are best served in individual gratin dishes 
measuring about four inches across. Put 2 tablespoons of 
butter in a saucepan, and let it cook over a slow fire until a 
rich brown, but not burnt. Add to it 1 teaspoon of lemon 
juice, and cover the bottom of each gratin dish with the 
(black) butter; then break into each dish 1 egg, or 2 if 
required, taking care not to break the yolk. Season with 
salt and pepper and arrange 8 or 10 capers on each; put 
in the oven eight or ten minutes, or until the eggs are well 
set. Set each dish on a doily on a small plate before 
serving, with a sprig of parsley on the side. 



2 44 Golden Rule Cook-Book 



EGGS CREOLE 

Take a shallow gratin dish large enough to contain the 
eggs required, allowing 2 eggs to each person, butter the 
gratin dish, and break the eggs carefully into it, taking 
care not to break the yolks ; season with pepper and salt, 
and set in a moderate oven until the whites are stiff; 
while they are cooking prepare the following garnish 
which will be suflHcient for 6 or 8 eggs. Put 1 tablespoon 
of butter in a saucepan ; when melted add 1 onion cut into 
thin slices, and stir it about three or four minutes. Then 
add to it 1 tomato which has been peeled and chopped, 
1 sweet green pepper cut in very thin slices, each broken 
in several pieces, and ^ can of button mushrooms, which 
are prepared by draining and washing and cutting length- 
wise in 3 or 4 pieces. Let all cook slowly together for 
eight or ten minutes, stirring carefully and adding more 
butter if necessary. When nearly cooked season gener- 
ously with pepper and salt, add 1 tablespoon of tomato 
sauce, and when the eggs are removed from the oven 
place this garnish on the eggs, encircling the outer edge. 
This garnish can be varied as to quantities to suit taste, 
using more or le^s tomatoes or onions. This is very nice 
done in individual gratin dishes, 2 eggs being used in 
each dish. 

EGGS IN SAVOURY BUTTER 

Savoury butter is made by melting good butter, and 
adding to it any chopped herb, â€” chives, parsley, etc. Put 
a Httle of this in individual gratin dishes, and break into 
them 1 or 2 eggs as desired. Pour a little of the savoury 
butter over the top of each egg, season with salt and pepper, 



Eggs 



245 



and put in the oven until the eggs are thoroughly set. If 
fresh tarragon is available, two nicely shaped leaves 
crossed on the yolk of the egg make a pretty garnish, or 
two leaves of lemon verbena may be used instead. 



EGG MOULD FOR VEGETABLES 

Make egg mixture as for egg timbales, and pour into a 
buttered ring mould. Cook in pan of water in the oven 
twenty minutes or until set, and then turn out onto a hot, 
round, flat dish, and fill the centre with hot button mush- 
rooms which are mixed with tomato sauce, or with peas, 
either with or without the sauce. 



CANUCK EGG TOAST 

Sprinkle fresh toast with walnut, mushroom, or any 
savoury catsup, then heap on it nicely scrambled eggs in 
which milk has been used, and on top put a generous layer 
of grated cheese ; jseason with pepper and salt, and put 
under the oven flame of a gas stove. Let the cheese 
brown, then remove and garnish the top with slices cut 
from black pickled walnuts, or a few capers, or with thin 
strips of pimentos, or chopped chives. 



ESCALLOPED EGGS 

Hard boil 8 eggs, cut the whites into medium-sized 
pieces, and press the yolks through a sieve or ricer. Put 
1 cup of milk in a double boiler, and with it 1 tablespoon of 
finely minced onion, shallot, or chives. When the milk 
boils add to it 1 tablespoon of thickening flour dissolved 



246 Golden Rule Cook- Book 



in a little milk and stir until thickened. Season with \ 
teaspoon of salt, \ teaspoon of pepper, a dash of paprika, 
and stir in the need egg-yolks and the diced whites. 
Serve in small dishes, or covered with crumbs and browned 
in the oven, or on rounds of toast. One or 2 sweet green 
peppers finely chopped vary this dish.

X AKE 1 cup of bread crumbs and 1 cup of milk, and 
cook together until smooth; then add 2 tablespoons of 
melted butter, 1 scant teaspoon of mustard, and 6 table- 
spoons of grated cheese. Stir over the fire for one minute, 
then remove, and add salt and cayenne pepper, and the 
lightly beaten yolks of 2 eggs; afterwards stir in with a 
fork the whites of the eggs, beaten to a stiff froth. Pour 
into ramekin dishes, and bake for fifteen minutes in a 
moderate oven, or cook and serve in a baking dish. 

BAKED CHEESE AND BREAD 

Soak 1 cup of bread crumbs for two or three minutes in 
2 cups of milk, then beat in the yolks of 2 eggs thoroughly 
beaten, and 1 cup of grated cheese, and lastly the whites 
of the 2 eggs beaten to a stiff froth. Put into a buttered 
baking dish, dot the top with butter, sprinkle with bread 
crumbs, and bake until a light brown, which will be in 
from twenty minutes to half an hour. 

CHEESE FONDU 

Put 1 tablespoon of butter in a saucepan, and when 
melted add 1 cup of milk, or cream if desired, 1 cup of fine 
bread crumbs, 2 cups of grated cheese, J teaspoon of salt, 



250 Golden Rule Cook- Book 

\ teaspoon of dry mustard, and some cayenne pepper. 
Stir constantly until well heated through, and then add 2 
lightly beaten eggs, and serve on rounds of toast. 

CHEESE RELISH 

Put 1 cup of milk into a double boiler, season with 
pepper and salt, and when hot stir in 1 cup of grated cheese, 
and let cook for five minutes ; then add 3 crumbed soda 
crackers and serve on toast, with a sprinkling of paprika. 

CHEESE MERINGUES 

Beat the whites of 2 eggs to a stiff froth, and stir into 
them with a fork 2 tablespoons of Parmesan or grated 
cheese, 2 drops of tabasco, a little salt and paprika ; drop 
1 tablespoon at a time into hot fat, and fry until brown ; 
then drain and sprinkle with fresh salt and paprika before 
serving. 

CREAMED CHEESE 

Make 2 cups of well-seasoned white sauce, add a few 
drops of golden yellow colouring, stir into it J cup of cheese 
cut into dice (or grated if preferred), and when the cheese 
is softened and hot serve on rounds of toast and sprinkle 
with paprika. 

CHEESE PANCAKES 

Make small pancakes of 1 cup of milk, 1 egg, and 
enough flour to thicken, and spread them with grated 
cheese moistened with a little melted butter; sprinkle 



Cheese 251 

chopped chives mixed with parsley over the cheese, and 
a dash of any savoury catsup (if liked) , season with salt and 
pepper, roll the pancakes after cooking, and serve as a 
savoury or luncheon dish. 

COTTAGE CHEESE 

Take 2 quarts or more of sour milk or cream, and add 
to it the same quantity of rapidly boiling water, turn into 
a straining-bag, and hang up until dry. When ready to 
use, turn out of the bag and rub until smooth; add a 
seasoning of salt and pepper and a little sweet cream. 
Beat until light and serve ice-cold. A little cream can be 
served to eat upon it, if liked. 

This can also be made by heating the sour milk or cream 
and using no water, but the milk must only be heated 
enough to separate and not enough to boil. 



WELSH RAREBIT 

Cut in very small thin pieces 1 pound of American 
cheese ; put it in a chafing-dish and stir until melted, then 
add 1 teaspoon of mustard, some salt, and slowly stir in \ 
a glass of beer or ale, and season with cayenne or paprika 
just before serving on toast. 



BACHELOR'S RAREBIT 

Make Welsh rarebit, and five minutes before servins 
stir into it 1 tablespoon of chopped green peppers and 
1 tablespoon of chopped Spanish pimentos. 



252 Golden Rule Cook - Book 



DEDMONICO RAREBIT 

Cut in small pieces 1 pound of Americaii cheese, put 
it in a chafing-dish and stir until melted; then add \ a 
glass of beer or ale, some salt and cayenne or paprika, 1 
teaspoon dry mustard, the yolk of 1 egg, then the whipped 
white of the egg, and serve at once on toast. The white of 
the egg militates against any "stringiness" which is apt 
to come from cooking certain sorts of cheese, A little 
milk can be used, if desired, instead of beer. 



PINK RAREBIT 

Drain 1 can of tomatoes and put them in a saucepan 
with 1 tablespoon of butter ; season them well with pepper 
and salt, and after they have cooked fifteen or twenty 
minutes add 1 pound of fresh American cheese cut into 
thin slices, and stir until melted; season generously with 
salt and pepper, and serve on rounds of toast. 

LIPTAUER CHEESE 

Remove the paper from the smallest Neufchatel cream 
cheese, which is nearer like real Liptauer than any other 
that can be had in America, and set it in the centre of a 
plate ; surround it with 1 teaspoon of paprika, \ teaspoon 
of salt, a small mustard spoon of French mustard, a piece 
of fresh butter half the size of the cheese, 2 teaspoons of 
minced onion, and 1 teaspoon of capers. The "Liptauer" 
should be blended at the table with a silver knife. Add 
first the butter, then the capers, then the onion, then the 
seasoning, and make into a cream. Serve on brown or 
white bread, or crackers. 



Cheese 253 



ROQUEFORT CHEESE GOURMET 

Cream \ pound of Roquefort cheese with 1 tablespoon 
of butter and some salt and 1 tablespoon of sherry, and 
serve on water crackers. 



CAMEMBERT CHEESE 

A pretty way to serve Camembert cheese is to place the 
cheese, when removed from its box and paper, on a round 
paper doily on a large plate, and surround it with a heavy 
wreath of watercress and radishes cut to look like flowers. 



CHEESE "DREAMS" 

Cut fresh cheese into thin slices, spread with made 
mustard, sprinkle with paprika, lay between two trimmed 
slices of bread, and toast on both sides until nicely 
browned, using a very slow fire. 



GRATED CHEESE 

Instead of throwing away bits of dried cheese these 
should be grated and put in a wide mouthed, covered 
glass jar. 



If Plutarch's advice, that those who 
affirm that they were intended by 
nature for a diet of flesh foody 
'should themselves kill what they 
wish to eat,' were always followed, 
the question would to most take on 
a different aspect. Few can endure 
unmoved the horrible sights of the 
slaughter-house ; far less could they 
participate in the slaughter." 



SALADS 



X HERE is no end to the combinations of vegetables for 
salads ; the few here given are the best ones I have tried. 
The dressing should never be put on a fresh green salad 
until just as it is to be used; other salads, like potato, 
beans, etc., are sometimes improved by standing. Lettuce 
for salads should be carefully looked over ; and clean, inner 
leaves not washed unless they are muddy; but all the 
leaves used which are washed should be thoroughly dried 
before adding the dressing. In France the salad basket 
is one of the most used kitchen utensils, and the salad 
leaves after washing are shaken in this until absolutely dry. 
The dressing should be very well mixed with the vege- 
tables, and a little dry salt and pepper added as the salad 
is served. 

FRENCH DRESSING 

An absolute rule for making good salad dressing is an 
almost impossible thing, as this seems to be the one place 
in cookery where it is not only allowable but commendable 
to "guess" at proper proportions. The following is as 
nearly accurate as it seems well to be. Put 1 scant teaspoon 
of salt and 1 saltspoon of black pepper in a bowl, and stir 
into them with a wooden fork, very slowly, 3 or 4 table- 
spoons of fresh oil, and then add half as much or less 
â€¢vinegar, mixing it well with the oil. 

17 



258 Golden Rule Cook-Book 



TARRAGON VINEGAR 

Good tarragon vinegar can be bought in any city, but it 
is so easily prepared at home that it is worth doing. ,Put a 
handful of tarragon in a quart jar, and cover with cold or 
heated vinegar. Seal the jar and set it in a dark place for 
a month or so before using. 

Make chervil vinegar in the same way. 



PLAIN MAYONNAISE DRESSING 

Put 2 chilled egg-yolks in a cold soup plate, and stir into 
them 1 teaspoon of salt and ^ teaspoon of mustard, using 
a silvered spoon, and after these are well mixed in begin 
to add oil, actually drop by drop, from 1 scant cup of cool 
olive oil, and do this until the eggs are so thickened that it 
is not possible to make them more so ; then the remaining 
oil may be added less slowly. If this first process is not 
properly done, no amount of stirring will ever thicken the 
sauce. A fork or whisk may be used to finish the stirring. 
When the oil is added, beat in slowly 1 tablespoon of 
vinegar, and 1 of lemon juice, and J saltspoon of cayenne 
pepper. Put on the ice until wanted. 

Tarragon mayonnaise is made by substituting tarragon 
vinegar for plain vinegar. 



GREEN COLOURING FOR MAYONNAISE 

This may be made of mixed herbs or spinach. If herbs 
are used take 1 tablespoon of parsley, 1 of watercress, and 
1 of chervil, put them into boiling water, let them cook 
eight minutes, then drain and pound in a mortar, and 



Salads 259 

press the pulp through a fine sieve. Use this with mayon- 
naise to make a light delicate green colour. 

If spinach is used press 1 tablespoon of chopped 
spinach through a sieve, and use it to colour the sauce. 

SALAD CHEESE BALLS 

Use equal quantities of Neufchatel cheese and grated 
American (or Parmesan) cheese, sprinkle with cayenne, 
and dampen with a little melted butter. Shape into tiny 
balls and use very cold as a salad garnish. 

AMERICAN SALAD 

Use 1 cup of scraped thinly sliced celery, 1 cup of diced 
apples, \ cup of chopped English walnuts, and \ cup of 
seeded white grapes. Mix well with mayonnaise, and 
serve on large curled lettuce leaves. 

ARTICHOKE SALAD 

Use cold boiled fresh artichokes, remove the thistles, and 
fill the artichokes with finely minced chopped onion, apple, 
and beet, blended with green mayonnaise; serve extra 
mayonnaise in which to dip the artichoke leaves. 

GREEN BEAN SALAD 

Put a can of good "stringless" beans on the ice an hour 
before wanted, open, drain, and arrange in a salad bowl 
with 2 teaspoons of grated or finely chopped onion and 1 
cup of French dressing. Serve ice-cold. 



2 6o Golden Rule Cook- Book 



WAX BEAN SALAD 

Make like the preceding, using 1 tablespoon of chopped 
chives or shallots, or green onion tops instead of chopped 
onion. 

BEfET SALAD WITH CELERY

pineapple. Select a perfectly ripe pineapple. Put the 
celery and pineapple each by itself, and place on the ice. 
When time to serve mix them together with mayonnaise, 
garnish with celery leaves, and serve at once. 

CHERRY SALAD 

When fresh cherries are available they are best, but 
the large cherries in glass bottles are also suitable. Re- 
move the stones from fresh cherries, and in their places 
put blanched filberts or hazelnuts. Put on curled lettuce 
leaves with a tablespoon of green mayonnaise on each. 



Salads 261 



CUCUMBER SALAD 

Soak 2 unpeeled cucumbers in ice-cold water for twenty 
minutes or more, then peel and use a patent scraper on 
the sides to serrate the edges, or do this by drawing a 
silver fork firmly down the length of the cucumber ; this 
will make the slices have fancy edges. Slice, and arrange 
with small white lettuce leaves in a salad bowl. Cover 
with French dressing and add a sprinkling of paprika to 
the salad itself before serving. Some sliced radishes may 
be added if liked. 

COUNTRY SALAD 

Use 1 cup each of finely sliced firm white cabbage, diced 
celery, and chopped apple ; mix them well with mayonnaise 
dressing, and serve in the inner leaves from the cabbage. 



RUSSIAN CUCUMBER SALAD 

Prepare like plain cucumber salad, but put with the 
sliced cucumbers 1 small onion sliced thin, with the slices 
separated into rings. One tablespoon of chives may be 
added, or more chives used and the onion slices omitted. 



DENT DE LION SALAD 

Take young dandelion leaves, trim off all the stem below 
the leaf, and mix with a French dressing to which has been 
added onion juice or chopped chives ; use 1 tablespoon of 
either to each cup of dressing. Hard-boiled eggs, sliced 
or chopped, are sometimes used to garnish this salad.

GARDEN SALAD 

Take a handful of sorrel, 2 sprigs of chervil, 4 leaves of 
tarragon (or use tarragon vinegar), 1 teaspoon of chopped 
chives, and the small leaves from the heart of a head 
lettuce. Blend all well with French dressing. 

GRAPE-FRUIT SALAD 

Wash and shake dry the fine leaves from a head lettuce, 
and arrange with them in layers very thin slices of grape-

Salads 263 



ITALIAN SALAD 

Having prepared 2 nice heads of head lettuce, arrange 
them in the salad bowl with 2 seedless oranges which have 
been neatly peeled, and cut into thin slices with a very 
sharp knife. Season with salt and pepper, and then mix 
thoroughly with French dressing. The oranges and let- 
tuce should have been chilled so that the salad will be 
very cold. 

LETTUCE SALAD 

Pull apart a fresh head lettuce, breaking the leaves 
neatly from the stalk, and wash those that need it and 
shake them dry. Put in a salad bowl with French dressing 
or sauce vinaigrette, and mix well together before serving. 

MACEDOINE SALAD 

Open a glass or can of imported macedoine of vege- 
tables, drain, and cover with French dressing. Arrange 
with lettuce leaves in a bowl or on separate plates. Fresh- 
ness can be added by a tablespoon of chopped chives, or

SPECIAL MIXED SALAD 

Use 1 cup of chopped tomato, 1 cup of chopped cucum- 
ber, \ cup of thinly sliced radishes, \ cup of chopped apple, 
and 2 tablespoons of the German pearl pickled omons. 
Mix all together with 1 cup of mayonnaise, and arrange 
in a salad bowl with lettuce leaves, which should be used 
to hold the salad in serving. 



264 Golden Rule Cook-Book 



MUSHROOM SALAD 

Select fresh, firm mushrooms that are small, wash them 
carefully without peeling, and stir them in French dressing 
that contains rather more oil than usual. Put 1 crisp let-

with salt and a little paprika, and serve very cold. 



NARRAGANSETT SALAD 

Wash and shake dry the fine white centre of endive or 
chicory, and arrange with it quartered tomatoes from

PIMENTO SALAD WITH CHEESE BALLS 

Mix 2 Neufchatel cheeses with 1 cup of grated cheese, 
and when creamed together add 6 olives stoned and 
chopped fine and 1 teaspoon of chopped pimento; season 
generously with salt and pepper, moisten with cream, and 



Salads 265 

mould into balls an inch and a quarter through. Pimolas 
(which are olives stuflfed with pimentos) can of course be 
used if more convenient, and a few drops of onion ex- 
tract or a very little onion juice adds piquancy to the 
cheese balls. Take lettuce which has been in cold water 
and is therefore crisp, shake it dry, and arrange with it 
pimentos cut in long half -inch strips, mix thoroughly with 
a French dressing, and garnish with the cheese balls. 



POLISH SALAD 

Use boiled beets, sliced and mixed with French dressing, 
and over all sprinkle chopped white of hard-boiled egg. 

A little grated horse-radish is sometimes used with good 
eflFect in beet salad. 



GERMAN POTATO SALAD 

Boil 6 medium-sized potatoes, and after draining shake 
them over the fire a moment or two to dry ; then peel and 
slice while warm, and cover at once with a dressing made 
of 1 teaspoon of salt, 1 saltspoon of black pepper, 1 table- 
spoon of chopped parsley, 1 chopped onion, 5 tablespoons 
of oil, and 3 tablespoons of vinegar. Mix and let stand on 
ice for an hour or so, then put with crisp lettuce leaves in

onion. 



Salads 267 



SPANISH SALAD

with French dressing, mixing well. Let stand on ice an 
hour before serving. Serve with cheese balls. 



SUNDAY-NIGHT SALAD 

Wash 1 large head of crisp head lettuce, separate the 
leaves, rejecting all but perfect ones, and shake them dry. 
Put them in a large salad bowl, and with them put 1 onion 
chopped very fine, 5 sliced tomatoes, and the leaves from 
3 or 4 sprigs of watercress. At the table dredge the salad 
generously with salt, and sprinkle with black pepper, 
covering the entire surface ; then pour from an oil bottle 3 
or 4 tablespoons of oil over the vegetables slowly, and 
follow this with about 2 tablespoons of vinegar; add 1 
tablespoon of tarragon vinegar, then dredge with celery 
salt, and add a little cayenne, and mix all together with a 
wooden fork and spoon, turning the whole mass over 
and over ten or more times. The bowl may be well 
rubbed with garUc and the onion omitted.

and mix well with mayonnaise dressing. Serve on curly 
lettuce leaves. 



WATERCRESS SALAD WITH ORANGES 

Cut two inches off the bottom of a bunch of watercress 
with a sharp knife, wash the cress thoroughly in ice-cold 
water, drain, and arrange in a salad bowl with 3 seedless 
oranges cut in thin slices, and mix all together with a dress- 
ing made of 1 tablespoon each of tarragon vinegar, olive 
oil, and brandy; season well with salt and pepper, and

on ice until chilled and then peeled, and put with them 1 
diced sour apple, 1 tablespoon of shredded pimentos, 1 
small bunch of watercress (using the leaves only) , and 2 
tablespoons of chopped mint leaves. Mix with French 
dressing and serve on lettuce leaves. 



Salads 269 



A SALAD SUPPER 

Use large dinner plates, and on each arrange 6 of the 
large light green leaves from the inner part of head lettuce, 
putting 5 of them with the stalk-end toward the centre 
of the plate, and another small one in the centre. Fill the 
centre leaf with radishes (cut like roses) and olives, and 
fill the others as follows: In one put 2 tablespoons of 
canned green beans, well mixed, before putting on the leaf, 
with a little grated onion and French dressing, on the 
second put 3 or 4 slices of tomato and 2 teaspoons of may- 
onnaise, on the third arrange 3 stalks of canned asparagus 
(white preferred) dipped in French dressing and sprinkled 
with chopped chives, on the fourth put 2 half-lengths of 
a quartered cucumber to be dipped in salt in eating, and 
on the fifth put 1 tablespoon of tiny German pearl onions, 
2' pickled walnuts, and 2 gherkins. Serve nut or plain 
bread, or creamed cheese sandwiches, or all three. This 
supper may be varied in many ways ; one is to use potato 
salad or beet and egg instead of the beans. This as it 
stands was the result of an emergency when six persons 
were suddenly to be served to a late supper and no prep- 
aration made. A well-stocked store-room of preserved 
goods and a small kitchen garden filled the need.

dainty for late suppers. The variety is practically endless, 
and tnose given here may be altered and added to indefi- 
nitely.

fully washed but not peeled. Fill the cocktail glass three 
quarters full of sauce made of ^ cup of tomato chutney, 
1 teaspoon of lemon juice, 2 drops of tabasco (more if

the gas flame of a gas stove for five minutes to heat.

ROUNDS OF TOAST 

To make rounds of bread or toast take an empty tin 
the size required and press it firmly into a slice of bread, 
thus cutting the round evenly and neatly. 

Cutters for cutting vegetables into fancy shapes are 
convenient for savouries. 



L/NE farmer said to me, " You can- 
not live on vegetable food, for it fur- 
nishes nothing to make bones with;" 
and so he religiously devotes a part 
of his day to supplying his system, 
â€¢with the raw material of bones, walk- 
ing all the while he talks, behind his 
oxen, who, with vegetable made bones, 
jerk him and his lumbering plow 
along in spite of obstacles. 

I have found repeatedly of late years 
that I cannot fish without falling a 
little in self-respect. 

Henry David Thoreau. 



SANDWICHES 



X HE recipes given under Savouries can also be used in 
making sandwiches, and originality can have full play here 
as in the making of dainty and appetising savouries. 

SAVOURY BUTTER SANDWICHES 

Use unsalted or slightly salted butter, and with a silver 
knife press into it any flavour desired, â€” onion juice, pap- 
rika, various sauces, chopped peppers, or capers, â€” using 
1 teaspoon of minced herbs, etc., to each tablespoon of 
butter. Spread in sandwiches. 

PROVIDENCE HOUSE CLUB SANDWICHES 

Cut fresh bread in medium thick slices, trim the four 
edges, and butter it with butter somewhat softened by 
warmth. On one side of two slices which belong next to 
each other put thinly sliced peeled tomatoes, filling in 
bits to cover the bread neatly. Press 4 or 5 slices cut from 
pickled walnuts into the juicy parts of the tomatoes, lay 
6 or 7 capers also in, and use half a teaspoon of the tiny 
German pearl onion pickles to each sandwich. Sprinkle 
with salt, pepper, and celery salt, and spread with mayon- 
naise. Press the other piece of bread firmly on, and wrap 
in waxed paper for picnics. 

Vary with chopped chives, tarragon leaves, French 
dressing, etc. 



282 Golden Rule Cook-Book 



APPLE SANDWICHES 

Arrange thinly sliced, cored apples between layers of 
buttered bread from which the crust has been cut. 
Sprinkle with salt and spread with mayonnaise, into which 
a few chopped nuts have been mixed. 



CREOLE SANDWICHES 

Trim and butter squares of bread and fit to them 
thinly sliced tomatoes, and spread with thin mustard; 
slice green peppers very thin, and arrange sections of the 
rings here and there over the tomatoes. Use a little 
minced chives or shallot, or onions, and season with salt 
and pepper and lemon juice or some sauce. 

BOMBAY SANDWICHES 

Spread squares of bread with curry paste, and cover with 
chopped tomato to which is added a little chopped onion 
and the same amount of chopped sour apples. Season 
with salt. 

PEANUT-BUTTER SANDWICHES 

Spread small oblong pieces of bread, from which the 
crust is cut, with peanut butter blended with cream, and 
press firmly together. 

EGG SANDWICHES 

Break 2 eggs into a frying pan containing a little melted 
butter and let them spread, breaking the yolk with a spoon 
after they are in the pan ; let them fry until the edges begin 



Sandwiches 283 



to brown, then season with salt and pepper, and sprinkle 
with chopped chives. Cut pieces out to fit the bread 
slices to be used, and, after trimming and buttering the 
bread, arrange them on one side of the sandwich. Use 
with no other flavouring, or sprinkle with Worcestershire 
sauce, or spread with mustard. Wrap in waxed paper for 
picnics. 

NUT SANDWICHES 

Mix chopped nuts in thick cream or mayonnaise, and 
spread between slices of bread, either with or without a 
lettuce leaf. Sprinkle with cayenne. 

LETTUCE SANDWICHES 

Spread oblong slices of trimmed bread with butter, lay 
a lettuce leaf between, trimmed to size, and spread with 
plain or green mayonnaise. 



PIMOLA SANDWICHES 

Butter small squares of bread and arrange on them 
sliced pimolas or any stuffed olives, sprinkle with lemon 
juice, or spread with mayonnaise. 



PICKLE SANDWICHES 

Slice large pickles and arrange them between buttered 
bread slices. If German Dill pickles are used and Ger- 
man flavours liked sprinkle with caraway seedsj and use 
rye bread. 



284 Golden Rule Cook-Book 



CHEESE SANDWICHES 

Cut American or Swiss cheese very thin, spread with 
mustard, and place a piece, trimmed to the size of the 
bread used, between two pieces of buttered white or rye 
bread. 

GERMAN SANDWICHES 

Use rye or "black" bread, with caraway seeds baked 
in it, spread the two slices with unsalted butter, and on 
one arrange thin slices of Swiss cheese ; spread this with 
German or French mustard, and arrange on it 2 or 3 
slices of Dill pickles. 



HONOLULU SANDWICHES 

Pare and core 3 apples, stem and seed 2 sweet green 
peppers, and put them through a vegetable mill. Mix 
them into 2 Neufchatel cheeses, and use as filling for 
brown or white bread sandwiches. 



11 E prayeth well who loveth well 
Both man and bird and beast; 
He prayeth best who loveth best 
All things both great and small; 
For the dear God who loveth us. 
He made and loveth all. 

Coleridge. 



PASTRY, PATTY CASES, Etc. 



PIE-CRUST 

â–ºShortened pie-crust is made by using for one pie 
Â§ of a cup of flour, with ^ of a teaspoon of baking powder 
and I of a teaspoon of salt in it. Sift this onto ^ a cup of 
cocoanut butter or J a cup of butter, or these two in equal 
proportions, dampen with ice-water, and roll out five or six 
times. Keep ice-cold until used. 



EASY PUFF PASTE 

Use a chopping bowl for mixing the paste, and into it 
put 4 cups of flour (sifted), 1 tablespoon of sugar and 1 
teaspoon of salt, adding it a spoonful at a time. Use 2 
cups of butter, chopping it into the flour until it is as fine 
as possible. Beat 2 eggs for five minutes and add to 
them the juice of one lemon and J cup of very cold water, 
and stir this gradually into the paste. When mixed lift 
the paste to a well-floured pastry board, roll it into a 
rectangular shape, fold it over onto itself from the four 
sides, then roll again, and repeat this process four times. 
Now fold into a thin piece of linen, and place on a plate 
near the ice in the refrigerator, and let it stand half an 
hour or more. Roll out again and use for patties, or pie- 
crust. 



288 Golden Rule Cook -Book 



TIMBALE CASES 

Make a batter of | of a cup of flour, \ cup of milk in 
which 1 egg has been beaten, 1 teaspoon of sugar, 1 salt- 
spoon of salt, and at the very last add 1 tablespoon of 
olive oil. Dip the timbale iron in the batter, then in hot 
vegetable fat, taking care it does not touch the bottom of 
the pan. When a golden brown remove and place on 
paper to drain, and proceed thus until a sufficient number 
has been made. Fill with chestnuts, mushrooms, etc., in 
sauce, and reheat in the oven after filling. 



BATTER FOR FRITTERS 

Make as for timbale cases and dip the vegetables or 
fruit to be fried in it, and fry until golden brown in hot fat. 



PASTRY FOR PATTY PANS OR CASES 

Instead of frying-batter for timbale cases a paste can be 
made with \\ cups of flour, 1 egg-yolk, and 3 tablespoons 
of butter well-mixed and dampened to the proper consist- 
ency by using perhaps \ cup of cold water. Roll out very 
thin, about ^^ of an inch, and press into the small pans or 
moulds after buttering them. Trim neatly, and press a 
little cup of buttered tissue paper in each, fill this with rice 
to protect the inside from too much heat and to keep flat 
on the bottom, and bake in a rather slow oven. Do not 
turn out until cooled, and do not fill until wanted. 

Ordinary pastry may be used also to line moulds for 
patty cases, timbales, etc. 



Pastry, Patty Cases, Etc. 289 



POTATO CRUST 

Boil good-sized potatoes with the skins on, peel while 
hot, and press through a ricer or sieve, mix with an equal 
quantity of white flour or whole wheat flour and a little 
salt, and dampen with cream. Press together and roll out 
for top crust of vegetable pies. 



ESSEX PASTRY 

Mix equal parts of mashed potato and flour pasjtry, and 
use baked in small squares as a garnish, or as a covering 
for deep vegetable pie. 



DUMPLINGS 

Sift 2 cups of flour, add to it 1 heaping teaspoon of 
baking powder and J teaspoon of salt, and sift again. Stir 
into this 1 scant cup of milk, or just enough to make a 
dough that can scarcely be handled without sticking to 
the fingers. Drop in boiling vegetable stock or into a stew 
and let boil rapidly ten minutes, taking great care not to 
uncover the kettle until just as the dumplings are removed. 
Serve at once in the stew or with brown sauce. 



CROUTONS 

Cut slices \ of an inch thick of stale bread, and with a 
knife cut across both ways to make tiny squares. Dry a 
few moments, then toss in a little hot butter to brown and 
serve warm. 

19 



290 Golden Rule Cook -Book 



BREAD CRUMBS 

A jar of bread crumbs should always be kept on hand. 
Use stale bread, break it into bits, and, brown it slightly in 
the oven. Then with a roller, or in a mortar, crumble it 
and crush it to powdered crumbs. If a jar of light crumbs 
and one of goloen brown crumbs are kept ready, they will 
be found most convenient. 



^ SMALL unkindness is a 
great offence. 

Hannah More. 



A FEW HOT BREADS 



BAkiNG POWDER BISCUITS 

L AKE 2 tablespoons of butter and sift onto them 
lightly 2 cups of flour in which 1 heaping teaspoon of 
baking powder is mixed, and with freshly washed, cool 
hands mix the flour and butter thoroughly together, then 
pour on slowly, stirring with a wooden spoon, 1 cup of 
milk ; with most flours this cup of milk or a very little less 
will make the biscuit dough of the proper consistency, but 
if too thin or too thick, judgment must be used, as the 
dough should be so that with well-floured hands it can 
scarcely be handled, but can with rapid motions be made 
into a roll which will keep its shape when put on a well- 
floured bread board. It should then be rolled lightly with 
a roller to the thickness of three quarters of an inch, and 
with a biscuit cutter, the edge of which should be dipped 
in flour before using, cut the rounds quickly out and place 
them at once in a shallow buttered pan and set in the 
oven. They should be properly cooked in eighteen or 
twenty minutes. The smallest sized baking powder tin 
is exactly the right size for a biscuit cutter. 

This same recipe makes dumplings, strawberry short- 
cake, and the top of vegetable pies. 

POP OVERS 

Mix 1 saltspoon of salt with 1 cup of flour, and add 
slowly enough from 1 cup of milk to just make a smooth 



2 94 Golden Rule Cook-Book 

paste ; stir this well, then add the remaining milk and the 
beaten yolk of 1 egg, and then the white whisked to a stiff 
froth. Put the batter in buttered gem pans or earthen- 
ware cups, and cook in the oven about twenty-five minutes, 
or until browned and standing very high. Serve at once. 

GRAHAM GEMS 

Mix 2 cups of whole wheat flour, \ teaspoon of salt, 1 
tablespoon of sugar, and stir onto this 1 cup of milk con- 
taining the beaten yolks of 2 eggs, then add the beaten 
whites of the eggs, and put in hot buttered gem pans. 
Bake about twenty-five minutes. 

TENNESSEE CORN BREAD 

Beat 2 eggs in a mixing bowl, add 1 heaping teaspoon of 
granulated sugar, and 1 cup of milk ; mix \ cup of white 
flour, 1 cup of yellow corn meal, and 3 teaspoons of baking 
powder, and sift these into the milk, stirring constantly. 
The batter should be thin enough to spread readily when 
poured into the inch-deep baking pan. Just before pour- 
ing in the batter put 1 tablespoon of butter in the baking 
tin and when it melts, stir the batter into it; this is the 
secret of crisp brown bottom crust and was learned from 
an old negro cook. Bake twenty minutes to half an hour 
or until tinged with brown. 

SOUTHERN RICE MUFFINS 

With 1 cup of boiled rice put 1 cup of milk, 1 table- 
spoon of butter, the beaten yolks of 2 eggs, 1^ cups of 
flour, 1 tablespoon of sugar, \ teaspoon of salt, and 1 



A Few Hot Breads 295 

heaping teaspoon of baking powder. After mixing well 
add the well-beaten whites of the eggs, pour into hot 
buttered gem pans, and bake in a quick oven from twenty 
to twenty-five minutes. 

RICE GRIDDLECAKES 

Mix well together 2 eggs, 2 cups of milk, \ teaspoon of 
salt, 1 tablespoon of sugar, 2 cups of flour, 2 teaspoons of 
baking powder, and \\ cups of boiled rice. Bake on a hot 
buttered griddle, browning both sides. 

CORN CAKES 

In 1^ cups of sour milk put 1 teaspoon of soda, 1 
beaten egg, 1 tablespoon of sugar, 1 teaspoon of salt, 1 
scant \ cup of white flour, and thicken with enough yellow 
corn meal to make a thin batter. Fry a golden brown on 
a hot buttered griddle. 

WHEAT CAKES 

Beat 2 eggs lightly and pour over them 2 cups of milk ; 
mix 2 teaspoons of baking powder with 2 cups of flour and 
\ teaspoon of salt, and sift lightly into the milk, stirring 
constantly. Cook in small pancakes on a hot buttered 
griddle. 

GINGERBREAD 

Beat the yolks of 2 eggs lightly, melt \ cup of butter 
and add to the eggs, then stir in \ cup of milk, 1 teaspoon 
of soda, and \\ cups of dark molasses. Then add slowly 



296 Golden Rule Cook- Book 

3 cups of sifted flour and 1 tablespoon of ginger, and after 
beating the whites of the eggs to a stiff froth stir them in 
with a fork. Bake in an inch-deep baking pan in a slow 
oven for three quarters of an hour. 

SUNDAY MORNING WAFFLES 

Beat 2 eggs thoroughly, and add to them 2 cups of milk 
and 1 saltspoon of salt, and sift into the milk 2 cups of 
flour containing 2 heaping teaspoons of baking powder, 
stirring constantly. Some flour thickens more than others, 
and if more must be added sift it before stirring in. The 
secret of the excellence of waffles is not getting the batter 
too thick ; it must spread readily when put upon the iron 
but not run. Melt 1 tablespoon of butter and put it in the 
batter at the last moment. Butter the hot waffle iron, 
using a bristle brush an inch or so wide for the purpose, 
over half -fill the iron with batter (using a large spoon) , let 
one side brown, and then turn, to brown the other. Divide 
into the four parts indicated by the iron and serve with 
maple syrup.

PLUM PUDDING AND MINCE PIE 



PLUM PUDDING 

eSlANCH 1 cup of almonds and J cup of Brazil nuts, 
and put them through a fine grinder ; add to them 1 cup of 
blanched chopped walnuts, and mix with these 2 cups of 
very fine bread crumbs, Â§ cup of butter, ^ cup of brown 
sugar, the grated rind of 3 lemons (washed well before 
grating) , 2 cups of seedless raisins, 2 cups of currants, 2 
cups of light Sultana raisins, 1 cup of mixed candied 
peel finely shredded, and when well blended stir into this 
six slightly beaten eggs and 1 teaspoon of salt. Put in a 
pudding basin and steam or boil for eight hours; boil 
several hours to reheat the day it is to be used. Serve 
with brandy sauce and nun's butter. 

PLUM PUDDING SAUCE 

Beat 1 egg until very light, stir into it 1 cup of sugar, 
and when blended add 3 tablespoons of boiling water and 
cook over boiling water for five minutes, adding 1 wine- 
glass of brandy during the last two minutes' cooking. 

NUN'S BUTTER 

Beat i cup of butter until creamy, and add slowly to it 
1 cup of powdered (or granulated) sugar. Add 1 table- 
spoon of vanilla, lemon, or brandy, and a sprinkling of 
grated nutmeg. 



300 Golden Rule Cook-Boo k 



MINCE PIE 

Bake 3 large apples, and press them through a sieve to 
remove skins and cores; grate the rinds from 3 lemons, 
and add this and the juice of the lemons to the apple 
pulp; wash, pick over, and bruise in a mortar 1 cup of 
currants ; stone 2 cups of raisins, and cut them in slices. 
Mix these all well together, chop into them 1 cup of butter 
(or cocoanut butter) , a little salt, 4 cups of brown sugar, 1 
tablespoon of candied lemon peel, 1 tablespoon of candied 
citron, and 1 tablespoon of candied orange peel, all well 
minced, and after stirring well, add 2 tablespoons of orange 
marmalade and J cup of good brandy. Put in sealed glass 
jars, cover with wax or brandied paper before the jar is 
closed, and use for pies in two weeks.

MENUS 



Mi 



LENUS in a cook-book are perhaps not always worth 
the space devoted to them, but as the beginner in Vege- 
tarianism often finds the arranging of a menu in such a 
way that it does not depart too far from the accustomed 
manner of serving food the most diflScult part of the 
task she has set herself, a few menus are here given, 
more with an idea of showing what dishes are most suit- 
able as Entremets, Pieces de Resistance, and Entrees, than 
with the thought that they will be followed absolutely, 
for they can of course be changed in many ways, and 
very much simplified for ordinary use, and amplified for 
formal occasions.

2 HE wolf also shall dwell with the lamhy

And the cow and the hear shall feed; 
their young ones shall lie down together;
