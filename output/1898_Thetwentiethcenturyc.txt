PREFACE. 



Only so much of preface seems necessary, as may 
justify the publication of this volume. 

Influenced by the repeated requests of friends, and 
convinced of the merits of the recipes herein contained, 
we feel fully warranted in adding another volume to 
the many that have recently appeared on the subject. 

Of late years cooking has come to be regarded as a 
science no less than as an art, and in the preparation 
of the recipes that we herewith submit, the most scien- 
tific methods have been employed. In addition every 
recipe has been subjected to many careful tests, and 
if directions be accurately followed, success in the pre- 
paration is assured. We have also endeavored to bring 
our recipes within the scope of the most moderate in- 
come, and in many cases where elaborateness is called 
for, we have given another simpler and less expensive 
recipe for the same dish. Not only has the quantity 
of ingredients been given, but also explicit directions 
as to mixing and baking. 

Realizing the annoyance to which housekeepers are 
subjected in selecting a menu for supper and luncheons, 
we have prepared a special chapter on " Supper and 
Luncheon Dishes." We have also added a chapter on 
" Diet for Invalids," which has been prepared under 

[I] 



2 PREFACE. 

Medical Direction, and which must prove a boon to 
those hitherto inexperienced in the preparation of such 
dishes. Our " Obesity List," will also be found of use 
to many. 

Though particular attention has been given to the 
subjects of " Entries and Desserts," each department 
will be found complete, presenting in its entirety a 
book that will, we trust, commend itself to every 
housekeeper.

APPETIZERS. 

In these days of extreme luxury, one would imagine 
that diners-out required only faith in the resources of 
a hostess and her cook to whet the edges of their ap- 
petites. Nevertheless, most fashionable dinners and 
luncheons are preceded by these important vanguards 
to the feast. 

Appetizers should always be daintily served and 
garnished, as they help to decorate the table, and 
should be what their name implies, an incentive to the 
appetite. 



Oyster Cocktail. 



Have as many punch glasses as there are guests at 
table. Put in each glass 4 small oysters, season them 
with salt, pepper, tomato catsup, Worcestershire 
sauce, a few drops of lemon juice, a drop of Tobasco 
sauce and a little grated horse-radish. Serve very 
cold. 

Oysters on Half Shell, 

Serve 4 oysters in the half shells, laid on a plate 
filled with finely crushed ice. Lay a quarter of a

water from penetrating. When puddings are boiled 
in bags, a plate must be placed in bottom of pan to 
prevent burning. Only certain puddings can be boiled 
in bags. Always grease inside of bag, so puddings 
will slip out easily. A bag made of two thicknesses 
cheese-cloth, stitched together, will do. Always leave

PASTRY, PIES, CUSTARDS, ETC. 



Puff Paste. 

Sift y^i lb. flour and a pinch of salt on a biscuit 
board, make a hole in the center, put in i ounce of but- 
ter, add a scant ^ cupful ice water gradually and mix 
together. Put on ice for 5 minutes. Have ready 7 
ounces more of cold firm butter, making J^ lb. in all. 

Roll the cold dough on the slightly floured biscuit 
board to the thickness of y^ inch. 

Lay the 7 ounces of butter in the center, fold the 
edges together so as to enclose the butter, flatten with 
a roller and put on ice for 10 minutes longer. Roll 
again lengthwise on the board in a different direction 
from the last time, fold it, and put on ice 5 minutes, 
then roll once more and put on ice 5 minutes, when it 
will be ready for use. 

Roll the dough out ^ inch thick, cut it all with a 
biscuit cutter. Take one half the pieces and cut the 
center out of them with a smaller cutter or small glass. 
Lay the whole biscuits in a flat pan, lay one of the 
pieces, from which the center has been cut, on top of 
each whole piece. With a fork prick a few holes in 
the small space that is not covered to prevent puffing, 
lay the small pieces that were cut out of the center, 
in the pan, and bake all in a quick oven. When done 
fill the holes with the oysters or sweetbreads, or any 
other mixture, and cover with the small pieces, and 
serve. If the patties are baked and cold, they must 
be heated again before filling, and serving. 

This pastry can be used for patties, tartlets, pies, and 
many other things. 



200 TWENTIETH CENTURY CoOK BOOK. 

Paste for Pies. No. i. 

Put I cupful sifted flour on a biscuit board, add a 
tiny pinch of salt, and i heaping tablespoonful firm 
butter and lard mixed. Rub together until mixed, 
then make a hole in the center, pour in 2 tablespoon- 
fuls ice water, and with a knife work until well mixed 
(never use the hand). Flour the biscuit board, roll the 
dough out thin, put a thin layer of fresh butter over, 
then sprinkle a little flour on top. Fold the dough 
over, and roll out thin again ; put another layer of 
butter, then flour, roll the dough out, not too thin, 
and line a pie plate with it. 

This makes i large pie in a deep pie plate. 

If the crust is to be baked first, prick the bottom 
and sides to prevent puffing. 

Paste for Pies. No. 2. 

Sift flour, then measure 3 cupfuls. Sift again with 
yi teaspoonful salt, measure i cupful of fresh butter 
and lard mixed (or i cupful butter if preferred), and 
cut in the flour with a sharp-bladed knife. Never use 
hands or a spoon in working, and work as little as pos- 
sible. Then add ^ cupful cold water (ice water in 
summer), mix and roll out on board. If dough is stiff 
add a little more water. Much better if put on ice 
some time before using. This amount of dough will 
make 2 pies. A deep pan is better for pies than a 
shallow one. Remove pies from pan as soon as done, 
otherwise they will adhere to pan. Use wooden board 
or marble slab to roll and work dough on. When hot, 
never put pastry on china or oil-cloth, as this will cause 
crust to sweat and become moist. Press the prongs 
of a fork around the edge of pie crust before baking, 
as this gives a pretty appearance and causes them to 
come out more easily. If crust is to be baked first 
prick bottom and sides to prevent puffing. 



TWENTIETH CENTURV COOIC BOOK. 201 

Paste for Tartlets. 

Cream J^ lb. butter, ^ cupful sugar together, then 
add yolks of 4 eggs, rind of )^ lemon, and i teaspooh- 
ful lemon juice and y^ lb. flour. Mix well, then pour 
on a -thickly floured board, and roll out not too thin, 
using as little more flour as possible. Cut with a 
saucer or large tin top, and line patty cases or plain 
mufifin rings with the dough. Press into shape with 
the hands. 

This recipe makes 18 tartlets. If you do not wish 
so many, take the dough that is left over, roll out very 
thin, cut into shapes, moisten the top with some beaten 
yolk of egg, sprinkle with pounded almond and 
powdered sugar and bake. When this pastry is used 
for tartlets, it is best to let them cool a little in the 
rings before removing, as they are then not so apt to 
break. 

Charlotte Dough, 

Mix I quart of flour with i cupful shortening (lard 
or butter), J^ cupful cold water, teaspoonful salt, yolk 
of I egg, I tablespoonful sugar, and J^ teaspoonful 
baking powder. For charlotte, a deep iron pot is 
best, but a deep round pudding-pan can be used. 



Fruit Rissolettes. 

Make a rich pastry as for rich pie crust, roll it out 
very thin. Cut out in round pieces with a .small bis- 
cuit cutter. 

In the center of half of the pieces lay ^ teaspoon- 
ful of jelly or marmalade, around the edges of the 
dough wet with some beaten yolk of egg. Cover the 
pieces with the jelly on, with the other half of the 
dough that was cut and laid aside, press down around 
the edges with a small fork, to keep the two pieces to- 
gether. Put in a greased pan and bake in a moder-

the butter and flour together for a few minutes ; make 
a hole in the mixture again, pour in gradually ,^ cup- 
ful ice water and mix all together with a knife. 
Work the dough as little as possible. Roll out a 
piece of the dough y^ inch thick and large enough to 
cover a deep iron skillet on the bottom and sides. 
Grease the skillet and line with the dough. Fill the 
skillet about ^ full with apples that have been peeled, 
cored and cut in small pieces, sprinkle generously 
with white sugar, lightly with cinnamon, lay in about 
a dozen raisins, pour a thin stream of syrup over, and 
put in tiny bits of butter, sprinkle just a little water 
over the whole. Roll out another piece of the dough 
very thin and cover the apples with it. Now put in 
another layer of apples, not so thick as the first, and 
proceed with the seasoning same as for the other 
layer. Then cover with the remaining dough rolled 
about j{ inch thich. Melt a little rendered butter or 
lard on the stove, dip in the blade of the knife, and 
with it draw the dough from the sides of the skillet, 
and fasten down over the top dough so as to prevent 
-the juice from cooking through. Pour some rendered 
butter or lard around the sides of the charlotte in the 
skillet, and put it in a moderately hot, steady oven 
and bake about i%^ hours. 

In emptying the charlotte, lay a wide, flat dish over 
the skillet, and turn the skillet quickly upside down.

sheet of plain tissue or wrapping paper in top of mold 
to prevent salt from penetrating. Cover whole with a 
cloth and stand in cool place until ready to serve. 
Puddings must stand from 3 to 4 hours. The chem- 
ical action of salt and ice is entirely different, than if 
mold was simply placed on ice in ice-box. If direc- 
tions are not followed, the result will not be satis- 
factory. Some puddings are put in molds immedi- 
ately and packed away ; others frozen in freezer, then 
put in mold. Only turn them in freezer when ex- 
pressly stated.

ICING FOR CAKES. 



Meringue. 

Beat the whites of as many eggs as desired to a very 
stiff froth, then beat in 2 level tablespoonfuls granu- 
lated sugar to each white. Beat until smooth and 
stiff, and spread at once on the pudding or pie. If 
desired, a drop or two of lemon juice may be added to 
flavor. 

Raw Icing. 

Break into a bowl the whites of 4 eggs, add at once 
1 lb. sifted powdered sugar, beat until white and stiff, 
adding a few drops of lemon juice or cream of tartar 
to flavor. 

Spread over the cake, and set in cool oven to harden. 

Boiled Icing. 

Boil together 2 cupfuls granulated sugar and i 
cupful water until it threads from the spoon. Beat 
the whites of 2 eggs stiff, then pour the syrup into it, 
stirring rapidly; then beat until light and creamy. 
Flavor with a few drops of lemon or vinegar, or a tiny 
pinch of cream of tartar. This will ice i large cake. 
Use half quantity for a small one. 

Pistache Icing. 

Make a boiled icing, when creamy add i teaspoonful 
pistache flavoring, i teaspoonful orange flower water, 
a few drops of almond extract. Mix well, then add 
^ cupful chopped pistache nuts. If a smooth icing is 
preferred, the pistache nuts may be omitted. Color 



252 TWENTIETH CENTURY COOK BOOK. 

with pistache coloring, a drop at a time, mixing well 
before adding more, until the desired color is obtained. 
This is fine for layer cakes, or all nut tarts, omitting 
pistache nuts when used for the latter. 

Cream Icing. 

Put on to boil 2 cupfuls granulated sugar, and i 
cupful milk, let boil about 15 minutes, or until it will 
fall from a spoon in creaihy drops. Remove from the 
fire and beat with a fork or egg whip until it is white 
and creamy, flavor with a few drops of lemon and 
spread at once on the cake. 

If the icing cooks too long it will get sugary after 
getting cold. It can be thinned with a little milk, then 
heated and whipped again. 

If the icing does not get thick after beating and 
getting cold, it shows that it is not cooked enough. 
It can then be put back on the stove and cooked a 
little longer, stirring all the time. Remove and beat 
again same as at first. Pour quickly over the cake. 
This icing is well worth a trial, and is not as difficult 
to get right as it seems. 

Transparent Icing. 

Make a boiled icing of i cupful sugar, and i cupful 
water. Let. boil until it begins to get syrupy, then 
stir into unbeaten white of i egg. Beat until it begins 
to get creamy, add a few drops of lemon juice, and i 
teaspoonful rose water. Spread while warm and thin 
over cakes. Place cakes in oven or hot sun, for a few 
minutes to harden. Used principally for angel food 
and sponge cakes.

late, beat until thick and creamy, and spread over cake. 
This quantity will ice i large cake or 3 layers. Use 
half quantity for a small cake.

sugar. Add i tablespoonful of boiling water and a

LARGE CAKES. 

Cake Making. 

The mixing of a cake is just as importart as the 
baking. There are a few rules to be followed if one 
would be a successful cake maker. If these simple 
rules are followed one need never have a failure when 
following a reliable recipe. 

In the first place before beginning to mix a cake all 
the ingredients should be weighed or measured and put 
before you on the table so that nothing will be for- 
gotten. The pans to be used should be well greased 
with butter, from which all the salt has been cooked 
out, or lard. If desired, a piece of brown paper can 
be fitted in the bottom of the cake pan and then 
greased ; but we do not find this necessary unless the 
pan is very thin. For tarts a " spring form " should 
be used, they can be procured at any store that 
handles cake pans. 

A few necessary implements for good cake making' 
are a pair of scales, a wooden spoon, 2 wire egg whips, 
one for the yolks and the other for the whites of eggs. 

Always use an earthen crock, never use tin to make 
^ cake in. 

In winter butter should be set over hot water a few 
jnoments to warm, not melt, as it will then cream bet- 
ter. Never let a cake stand after mixing, always bake 
at once. The oven should always have a moderate 
Jieat unless mentioned otherwise, 



256 TWENTIETH CENTURY COOK BOOK. 

Flour should always be sifted twice and the sugar 
also. In measuring the butter always pack the cup, so 
as to be sure to have the proper quantity. The cup 
should hold yi pint.

^ lb. citron cut fine, ^ lb. dried figs cut fine, ^ cup- 
ful flour with y^ teaspoonful cream tartar added, and 
y^ cupful flour with ^ teaspoonful soda added. Bake 
immediately 2 J^ hours. Rub all fruit with flour. And 
mix just as it is put down.

Then beat until bowl can be turned upside down 
without eggs spilling. Have ready i^ cupfuls of 
granulated sugar, which has been sifted 5 times, and 
measured after sifted, also i level cupful of flour 
which has also been sifted 5 times, and measured after 
sifted. The cup should hold 2 gills. A tin cupful 
with divisions, can be purchased for measuring pur- 
poses. Now roll the sifted sugar in gently, folding 
over and over in the eggs, without stirring, until sugar 
is all absorbed. Then add flour, folding over in same 



258 TWENTIETH CENTURY COOK BOOK. 

way, and i teaspoonful rosewater or lemon extract. 
Have ready a tin cake pan, which has never been 
greased. Put in moderate oven. A pan of water can 
be set in upper part of oven, until cake has begun to 
rise. Bake from 35 to 50 minutes. Never remove 
from pan while hot. Ice when cold, with transparent 
icing. The angel food pan with removable slides, to 
loosen the cake without breaking, is very convenient. 
Turn cake pan upside down, until cool, but do not put 
in a draught of air. If directions are followed, the 
cake is very successful, delicate, and inexpensive, and 
after a little practice, very easy to make.

enough flour to it to enable you to keep it from stick- 
ing to the hands (be careful not to make the dough too 
stiff). Mould the dough into small biscuits, lay then\

on a flowered board or dish, and set aside until nicely 
risen. 

When risen, cover the bottom of a deep, round iron 
skillet with rendered butter, put it on top of the stove, 
let it get hot, then lay in some of the dumplings (being 
careful not to crowd them as they spread), pour a cup- 
ful of cold water or milk in immediately, put a close- 
fitting lid on the skillet and let the dumplings cook on 
one side until brown ; you can tell that they are frying 
when you hear that the water has cooked out. When 
brown, on one side, remove the lid and brown on the 
other side. Proceed in like manner until all the dump- 
lings are cooked. 

Serve with caramel sauce.

Bread Making. 

There are three important points to be observed in 
bread making, they are : good flour, good fresh yeast, 
and patience to work it well. 

Try the yeast always, by setting to rise in a cup of 
lukewarm water or milk. If it fails to rise after a cer- 
tain time, do not attempt to make bread of it, as it 
will surely fail. Bread should never be cut while very 
hot. Stand the loaves on end, so that the air can cir- 
culate freely all around. 

In using soda in biscuits, muffins, etc., the teaspoon 
should be scant or heaping, according to the sourness 
of the milk. 

It is very necessary to have rendered butter at hand, 
for greasing pans, frying doughnuts, etc. 



Rendered Butter. 



Procure as much country or Western butter as de- 
sired, you may get 20 or 30 lbs. of it when it is cheap 
during the summer, for if it is put in jars and well cov- 
ered, it will keep for six months or longer. 

Put the butter in a porcelain-lined kettle, being 
careful not to put in too much at one time or it will

boil over. Boil slowly for several hours, until it be- 
comes quite clear. Do not stir it, but from time to 
time skim it. When perfectly clear, and all the salt 
has settled at the bottom, the butter is done. Set 
aside a few minutes, then strain into stone jars through 
a fine sieve, and when cold tie up tightly with paper 
and cloth. Keep in a cool, dry place. 

Buttermilk Yeast. 

Soak I large yeast cake in i cupful warm water, not 
hot ; when dissolved, mix with i pint pearl meal, i 
cupful buttermilk, i teaspoonful salt and 2 teaspoon- 
fuls sugar. Set aside to rise. When well, risen, mix 
in enough dry corn meal to work out in cakes. Use 
as little meal as possible. Put the cakes aside to dry, 
when they will be ready for use. Keep in a tightly- 
covered box in a cool, dry place. 

Potato Yeast. 

Put on to boil 8 good-sized Irish potatoes, when 
done mash them thoroughly in the water in which they 
have been boiled, let cool, then stir in i teaspoonful 
sugar and one of salt, also stir in i large yeast cake 
that has been dissolved in lukewarm water, and 
thicken, not stiff, with corn-meal ; cover and set 
aside till morning or until it rises very light, then stir 
in enough meal to make very ^x'S. and make into 
cakes. Let the cakes get thoroughly dry, then put in 
a tightly-covered box for future use. 

Vienna Bread.

minutes without sticking to the hands or bowl. 



TWENTIETH CENTURY COOK BOCK. 30J 

Grease a bowl, lay in the dough and grease the top 
of the dough. Cover with a towel, and keep in a place 
of 75 degrees temperature. Let stand 3 hours count- 
ing from the time the first flour was added. It should 
then be twice the size it was when put in the bowl. 

Mould into loaves, put in Vienna pans, let rise i 
hour, till risen twice its size, then bake in a very hot 
oven.

more warm water can be added if necessary. Mix 
well and put aside in a warm place (not hot) to rise, 
usually I or 2 hours. 

Now take i^ quarts sifted flour, add i tablespoon- 
ful salt, I good tablespoonful butter and same quantity 
lard, mix together and pour in the risen yeast, mix 
well and set aside to rise all night, say 6 or 7 hours.

scraping skillet well. Make a small spice-bag of sev- 
eral bay leaves, a few whole spice, whole black pep- 
pers, and some cloves with the tops removed, also one 
or two red peppers. Drop this bag into the pan. 
Cook until the meat is very tender, cooking the jelly 
down to about half the quantity. It may take about 
6 hours. Season with salt, making much saltier than the 
taste would demand as it loses in hardening. Pour 
into a mold, first removing spice-bag. Let harden, 
turn out, and cut in slices. In winter will keep for 
several days. Is nice for supper or evening entertain- 
ments. In summer, it is best to keep on ice until 
ready to serve.

BEVERAGES. 



How to Roast Coffee. 

Put the coffee in an agate or tin baking pan, if you 
have no family coffee-roaster. Put in a moderately 
hot oven to get a dark golden brown, not black ; toss 
the coffee frequently with a wooden spoon, and when 
done, drop in a small lump of butter, and stir until the 
coffee is glazed. Put in an earthen jar and cover 
tightly. 

How to make Coffee. 

To each cupful, use 2 heaping tablespoonfuls coffee, 
ground neither too coarse nor too fine, and it must be 
freshly ground. Mixed Java and Mocha is best with 
a little Maracaibo. Put the ground coffee in a thin 
flannel bag inside the filter of a French coffee-pot ; 
pour I teaspoonful cold water over the grounds, then 
set the pot on the stove to heat thoroughly, then 
pour as much boiling water over the grounds as re- 
quired, not forgetting to allow 2 heaping tablespoon- 
fuls coffee to each cupful water ; let the coffee drip 
through the bagi then pour over the grounds twice more, 
being careful to keep the pot on the back of the stove, 
as the coffee will not be fit for use if it boils after 
pouring the water over it. Serve at once. 



Iced Coffee. 

Make coffee in the morning, having it a little 
stronger than usual. Sweeten to taste, and serve with 
cracked ice. If desired, a spoonful of whipped cream 
can be added to each glass. 



TWENTIETH CENTURY COOK BOOK. 347 

Chocolate. 

Put on to boil I cupful water and 3'cupfuls milk. Dis- 
solve 8 heaping teaspoonfuls grated sweet chocolate 
(the best, of course) in very little cold milk. When

Tea. 

An earthenware or copper teapot is best. Have 
the water boiling, allow i teaspoonful of tea to every 
cup of hot water, pour boiling water into teapot, let 
stand I minute, and pour off immediately and serve. 
Tea made in this way is very stimulating, but if al- 
lowed to stand longer, with the leaves, becomes poi- 
sonous. 

Iced Tea. 

Make plain tea, and keep in an earthen or china 
vessel on ice until ready to prepare. Just before serv- 
ing add lemons and sugar to taste. Put a spoonful of 
cracked ice in each glass and serve.

strained juice in glass, put J^ glass of crushed ice, i^^ 
tablespoonfuls of sugar, y^ glass of claret, and fill up 
remainder of glass with water. Serve with a slice of 
lemon or orange. If punch is to be made in large 
quantities, allow the same proportions, for as many 
glasses as needed. Sliced pineapple, sliced lemon, 
sliced orange, and candied or maraschino cherries are 
added. Do not crush the ice, but put a large lump in 
punch bowl, pour in punch, and serve as desired.

them, hang them on the inside of the pitcher from the 
top ; drop in a good-sized lump of ice, and serve at 
once in thin glasses. 



Sauterne Cup. 

Take equal parts of sauterne and apollinaris water, 
and put in a pitcher, allowing six lumps of sugar to 
every quart. Add a long paring of cucumber rind 
and a few slices of pineapple. Put the pitcher in a 
bucket of cracked ice and salt, or fill a towel with 
cracked ice and salt, and wrap around the pitcher. 
Do not put ice in the mixture. Just before serving

than the other spices. Get good whiskey and allow 
y^ as much cherries as whiskey. To a quart bottle 
allow scant yi pint sugared cherries to i^ pints of 
whiskey. Bottle and seal. Let stand at least 2 
months. Open, shake bottle well and taste, and if 



3S2 TWENTIETH CENTURY COOK BOOK.

sugar. Put the sugar in an agate boiler without a drop 
of water, let melt very carefully, and when thoroughly 
melted and brown, not burnt, remove from the stove, 
stir in the nuts at once, pour on a marble slab, and 
roll very quickly with a roller until thin as a wafer, 
then cut in strips. 



TWENTIETH CENTURY COOK. BOOK. 355 

Plarines. 

I lb. dark brown sugar, i lb. pecans weighed before 
shelling. 

Put on the sugar with just enough water to dissolve 
it ; let boil, stirring constantly until you can form a ball 
between your fingers, then add a good pinch of soda ; 
after mixing the soda well into the candy, add the 
nuts. When it begins to turn back to sugar, remove 
from the fire, and drop into cakes on a greased marble 
slab. 

Fondant, or French Creams. 

To every lb. of sugar allow J^ pt. water (granulated 
sugar No. i. is best) and i teaspoonful of glucose. 
Glucose is preferable to cream tartar and can be pur- 
chased of almost any confectioner by the ^ pint. If 
it is not obtainable, use 5i teaspoonful of cream tartar. 
Boil until when dropped in cold water it will make a 
soft ball that can be rolled between the fingers. Remove 
immediately, as it will sugar if cooked too long. Pour 
in a flat china platter (ungreased), or best of all, on a 
marble slab, and let stand until it begins to cool. Take 
a wooden paddle and begin to work, always moving 
paddle in one way. Drop a few drops of essence of 
vanilla on it. Work steadily until it becomes creamy, 
and finally hard and white. This is the foundation 
for any cream or French candy. Will keep a week. 
If too hard to mold well, put fondant in kettle, place 
kettle in boiling water, and let melt. 

Walnut Creams. 

Take a small piece of fondant, while pliable, but 
not too soft, place a half walnut on either side and 
put aside to stand for a day. A variety can be made 
by dividing a piece of fondant in 3 parts, coloring one 
green and adding a few drops of pistache flavoring. 
To the other part add a few drops of strawberry

coloring, and flavoring. Fix walnuts in same man. 
ner. 

Coffee Crea^ns. 

Melt fondant in double kettle or in saucepan over 
kettle of hot water. Flavor and color with coffee ex- 
tract. Take ^ walnut, dip in melted fondant, roll 
until it is thickly covered, and place on waxed paper 
to harden. 

Pistache Creams. 

Melt fondant in double boiler, color and flavor with 
pistache. Take a candied cherry, roll in melted fon- 
dant, and put on waxed paper until the next day. 

Date Creams. 

Remove seeds from dates, roll a piece of fondant 
oblong, half the size of a finger, place in date, and set 
aside until next day. 

Fruit Roll. 

Take a piece of fondant, roll out i inch thick. Chop 
up figs, dates, and nuts, work in fondant, and roll out 
again. Roll together in shape of jelly roll. Let stand 
until firm, then cut in thin slices crosswise. Is made 
much finer if candied fruits are used. 

Strawberry Creams. 

Place fondant in kettle, put kettle in hot water and 
set on stove. Add a few drops of strawberry flavor- 
ing, and a tiny bit of pink coloring. Have strawber- 
ries ready, carefully selected ones with stems on. 
Catch by the stem, roll in melted fondant, set on dish 
to harden, and serve same day as prepared or straw- 
berries will spoil. Can be colored and flavored with 
pistache. These are nice served as bon-bons for tea:s 
and luncheons. 



TWENTIETH CENTURY COOK BOOK. 357 

Cherry Creams. 

Prepare same way as Strawberry Creams, cut away 
part of the stem of the cherry. 

Chocolate Creams. 

Prepare fondant the day before. Sprinkle wooden 
board lightly with cornstarch, roll a small piece of 
fondant out thin, cut off a piece, and shape into cones, 
or little balls like the confectioners' drops. Set aside 
over night to harden. Next day grate ^ lb. Baker's 
chocolate, put in a sauce pan, and place over a kettle 
of boiling water. Let melt but do not add water to it. 
Add 2 or 3 drops of glycerine, and a few drops of 
vanilla flavoring. Take a needle or hat pin, stick 
through creams, roll in melted chocolate, put on 
waxed paper, and let stand until next day. 

Peppermint Creams. 

While fondant is soft, add a few drops of oil or 
essence of peppermint, and drop with a teaspoon 
on buttered paper. Let stand until next day. If 
fondant is firmer mold pieces in shape of a quarter 
dollar. Chocolate can be melted, and prepared in 
same way as for chocolate cream drops. Dip creams 
in and let dry. 

French Cream Candy. {Uncooked^ 

Break into a bowl the white of i egg, add to it an 
equal amount of water, after measuring in a table- 
spoon, and stir in confectioners' sugar until you 
have the mixture stiff enough to mould into balls with 
the fingers. Flavor with a few drops of vanilla. This 
ca,ndy will only keep fresh a few days. 



358 TWENTIETH CENTURY COOK BOOK. 

Walnut Creams. 

Make some uncooked French cream. Mould it with 
the fingers into neat round balls, about the size of a 
walnut. Crack a pound of walnuts, being careful not 
to break the meat. 

Take one of the cream balls, place half a nut on either 
side of it, pressing them firmly into the cream. When 
all are done, stand aside for a few hours to set. 



Coffee Walnut Creams. 

Make same as Walnuts Creams, only using strong 
coffee instead of water in mixing the sugar. 

Chocolate Caramels. 

Boil ^ lb. grated chocolate, i cupful cream, r cupful 
New Orleans molasses, butter the size of an egg, i cup- 
ful of brown sugar, and a few drops of vanilla extract. 
Boil until it makes a little ball in cold water, but not 
too soft. Pour in shallow greased tins, allow to cool, 
then mark off into blocks. Is best the second day. 

Cream Caramels. 

Boil 3 cupfuls of sugar with i teaspoonful' vanilla 
extract, and i cupful sweet cream. When it begins to 
boil add ^ teaspoonful cream tartar, and fresh butter 
size of an egg. When it makes a soft ball in ice cold 
water, remove immediately, pour in flat buttered pans, 
and do not stir until cold. Cut and block. If cooked 
too long, will sugar. Must be watched carefully, and 
stirred while cooking, but not after it is done. 

Taffy Buttercups. 

2 cupfuls white sugar, i cupful syrup, and ^ cup- 
ful butter. Put on in an agate boiler, and boil, not 
too fast, stirring occasionally until it candies. Test by 
dropping a little on a cold marble, if it will pull when 



TWENTIETH CENTURY COOK BOOK. 359 

cold, it is done. Remove from the fire, flavor with 
vanilla, pour on a buttered marble or platter, and when 
cool, pull like molasses candy until cold, then stretch 
and cut with a sharp scissors in blocks, i inch square. 

Glacd for Candies. 

Boil I lb. sugar with y^ pt. of water, until it ropes, 
then add ^ cupful vinegar (i gill), and boil until it 
hardens. Dip fruit in, orange slices, or nuts, and put 
aside on a buttered platter to set. Green grapes with 
the .stems on are nice glac^d. The orange slices and 
glac6 grapes are used for teas and luncheons.

PRESERVES. 

Strawberry Preserves. No. i. 

Pick and wash the berries well, then weigh them. 

To every pound of berries use i pound sugar. 

Put the sugar on a hot fire with just enough water 
to dampen it well. Let cook until it forms a syrup, 
then drop in the berries carefully. Cook until the 
berries are done, but not to pieces ; they should be 
whole, and generally require about 20 minutes to cook 
them. 

Remove the berries with a perforated skimmer and 
put them in jars. Continue cooking the syrup until 
thick, then pour over the berries, and seal tightly. 
The less of this preserves cooked at one time, the 
brighter it will be. 

If there is too much syrup to fill the jars, strain it, 
and cook a little longer. It will make nice jelly. 

Strawberry Preserves. No. 2. 

Pick strawberries, weigh, then wash carefully. Put 
berries in bottom of preserving kettle. Weigh sugar, 
allowing lb. for lb. and put over berries in kettle. 
Put whole over a slow fire, cook the berries done, re- 
move with a skimmer, and put in glass jars, nearly ^ 
full. Let syrup cook down thick, pour over berries in 
jar, filling up to the brim, put brandied paper on top, 
screw on top of jars, and seal immediately. Be care- 
ful to discard all spoiled berries and fruit will keep 
any length of time. 

Blackberry Preserves. 
Prepare the same as Strawberry No. 2, 



TWENTIETH CENTURY COOK BOOK. 361, 

Seedless Blackberry Jam. 

Get I peck ripe blackberries, wash and pick them 
well, put in an agate kettle on the back of the stove 
without water, stir often from the bottom with a 
wooden spoon until thoroughly heated all through, but 
do not boil. 

Remove the berries from the stove, and with a 
pounder mash them thoroughly ; then mash them 
through a very fine sieve, being Careful to get all the 
pulp and leave only the seeds. Sometimes it is neces- 
sary to put them through a thin cheesecloth bag. 
Measure the juice, and to i quart juice, add i pint 
sugar, put on the stove and boil slowly until thick, 
then put in jars and close tightly. 

Blackberry Jam. 

Weigh blackberries, wash carefully, put in preserv- 
ing kettle, and mash as much as possible. Put over 
slow fire and let cook about 20 minutes, stirring ber- 
ries. Weigh sugar, allowing ^ lb. of sugar to every 
pound of fruit. Heat sugar in oven, stirring con- 
stantly to prevent burning or melting, drop in with 
berries, mix well, and let cook until thick. Pour into 
glass jars, cover with brandied paper and seal while 
hot. 

Plum Preserves. No. i. 

Secure large plums that are three-quarters ripe. 
Wash and stem, then weigh them. Use i lb. sugar to 
every pound plums. 

Put the sugar in a porcelain-lined kettle, put in 
enough water to cover sugar, add a small, thin bag of 
spices (cinnamon, cloves and allspice). When the 
sugar begins to get syrupy lay the plums in carefully, 
let them cook about 15 minutes, remove to a platter 
carefully with a perforated skimmer. Continue cook- 
ing the syrup until it begins to thicken. Put the 
plums back, cook a while longer until syrup is thick, 
then put in jars and seal tightly. 



362 TWENTIETH CENTURY COOK BOOK. 

Plum Preserves. No. 2. 

Weigh plums, wash and stem, drain dry, and prick 
plums with fork, to prevent bursting. Plums should 
not be too ripe as they burst, or too green, or they 
shrivel. Weigh sugar, allowing i lb. to every pound 
of fruit. Put sugar in kettle and for every 5 lbs. of 
sugar, allow i pint boiling water. Let syrup come 
to a good boil, skim carefully, and add plums. Do not 
put all in at one time, as it is impossible to cook them 
evenly. When plums are done, which should be in a 
very short time, remove with skimmer and put in glass 
jars ^ full. Let syrup cook thick, pour over fruit up 
to the brim of jar, put brandied paper over and seal. 

Fig Preserves. 

Secure the figs with stems on, just before they are 
ripe. Pour water over them, and dry each one care- 
fully and separately with a piece of thin soft cloth. 
Weigh the figs and to each lb. of figs use ^ lb. sugar. 

Put the sugar on the stove in an agate kettle with 
barely enough water to cover it. To i pk. figs add 
to th« syrup, 2 lemons cut in slices, and 8 pieces of 
whole white ginger. Let the sugar boil until it begins 
to get syrupy, then lay in the figs, boil until the figs 
can be pierced with a straw. Remove them to a 
platter with a perforated skimmer, and put them in the 
sun. Continue cooking the syrup until it begins to get 
thick, put the figs back, and cook until the figs are 
clear and the syrup thick. Put in jars and seal tightly. 

Peach Preserves. 

Select yellow freestone peaches of the best quality. 
Pare and stone them, breaking them in half. Weigh 
them and throw them in cold water to keep from 
discoloring. 

Use I lb. sugar for every lb. of fruit. Put the sugar 
in an agate kettle with just enough water to cover it, 



TWENTIETH CENTURY COOK BOOK. 363 

add a handful of the peach kernels, and a small bag of 
spices. Boil the sugar until syrupy, skimming off all 
the scum, then add the peaches. Boil steadily, not 
too fast, until they are tender and clear, then with a 
perforated skimmer put them in jars. Continue boil- 
ing the syrup until clear and thick, then pour it over 
the fruit, and seal. 

Peach Butter. 

Secure ripe freestone peaches, yellow ones are best, 
peel and stone them. To every lb. of fruit use ^ lb. 
sugar. Put the sugar over the fruit in an agate kettle, 
add a handful of peach kernels and a small bag of 
spices, pour enough water over to cover the fruit about 
half way, boil very slowly, stirring very often, should 
cook 5 or 6 hours. 

Pear Preserves. 

Proceed same as for peach preserves. Pare, core 
and either halve or quarter them, dependent on the 
size of the fruit. The pears should cook longer than 
peaches because they are tougher. 

Sun them while the syrup is continuing to cook, and 
drop them back in the syrnp just before taking it up, 
and let them boil up once or twice. 

Crab Apple Preserves. 

Select small, yellow, sound apples with the stems 
on. 

Allow I lb. sugar for every pound fruit. Boil the 
sugar with just enough water to cover it, add a small 
thin bag of spices. As soon as the syrup begins to 
boil put in the apples, and boil until they can be 
pierced by a straw ; take them up with a perforated 
skimmer, and put in the sun on platters. Continue 
cooking the syrup until it begins to thicken, then put 
the apples back, and boil 15 or 20 minutes longer, until 
clear and thick. Seal at once. 



364 TWENTIETH CENTURY COOK BOOK. 

Citron or Watermelon Rind Preserves. 

Cut the rind of the melon in small fancy shapes, 
squares and triangles. Peel off the green outer skin 
and all inside pulp which is the least bit soft. Put in 
an earthen jar, and cover with a strong brine. Let 
stand 2 days. Wash in cold water the third day, and let 
stand in a solution of alum water until evening. Wash 
again and soak over night in cold, fresh water. The 
next morning weigh, and to every pound of fruit allow 
I lb. of sugar. Put sugar in preserving kettle, and to 
every 4 lbs. of sugar add i pint water. Let boil until 
thick and clear, and then drop in rind. Add a hand- 
ful of white ginger. Boil until melon rind can be cut 
easily with a knife. If syrup is not sufficiently thick, 
sun the rind until syrup has thickened. Do not let 
cook until sticky. Fill jars, allow plenty of syrup to 
each jar, and seal while hot. If properly made will 
keep for 2 or 3 years. If citron for cakes is not con- 
venient, this can be substituted by draining off syrup, 
wiping dry, and cutting in small pieces. 

Canteloupe Preserves. 

Secure thick rind melons, cut in halves, discard the 
seeds and all soft inner part, pare thinly and slice in 
pieces as long as your finger and 3 inches broad. 
Soak in brine over night, next morning wash and 
soak in fresh water 2 hours. Weigh the fruit and use 
I lb. sugar to i lb. fruit.' Put on the sugar in a kettle 
with just enough water to cover. Let boil until 
syrupy, add a few pieces of whole white ginger. Drop 
in the fruit, boil until tender, then remove, and sun 
until syrup has boiled thick, drop in the melon again, 
boil up once or twice, then bottle and seal hot. 

Watermelon rind can be preserved in the same way. 



TWENTIETH CENTURY COOK BOOK. 365 

Quince Preserves. 

Pare, quarter and core the quinces, saving the skins 
and cores. Put the quinces on to boil in preserving 
kettle, with just enough clear water to cover them, and 
cook until tender, but do not break. Take quinces 
out, lay on dishes to cool, keeping each piece separate. 
Put skins and cores in the water |he quinces were 
boiled in, and boil 20 minutes longer. Strain through 
a jelly bag, and to each pint of juice allow i lb. sugar. 
Put on to boil, let cook until half done, then put in the 
fruit and boil 15 minutes longer. Take fruit out, fill 
jars y^ full, and if syrup is not quite thick enough, 
cook longer, then pour while hot over fruit in jars and 
seal. It is best to put only a few of the quinces in 
the syrup at a time. Cook until done, then put more 
in, and so on. 

Ripe Tomato Preserves. 

7 lbs. tomatoes peeled, 7 lbs. sugar ; let it stand 
over night in a jar. 

Next morning drain off the syrup, boil in an agate 
kettle until clear, skim well, drop in the tomatoes, boil

366 TWENTIETH CENTURY COOK BOOK. 



JELLIES. 

Put fruit on with sufficient water to cover it, and let 
boil, until soft and mushy. Watery fruits, such as 
grapes, plums, and blackberries, require less water. 
Pour while hot in cheese-cloth bags, and let drip at 
least six hours. Can be dripped over night if weather 
is not too warm. 'To every pint of juice allow I pint 
of sugar. It is best to cook only i pint at a time, as 
the fruit jellies better and is clearer, and cooks much 
more rapidly. Heat the sugar in oven, but do not let 
melt. Put juice on to boil, then drop heated sugar 
into juice, let begin to thicken, and when juice 
thickens on the end of spoon, strain and pour into 
gla.sses. 



Apple Jelly. 



Use tart, juicy apples, not too ripe, cut them in 
quarters without peeling or coring, throw the pieces in 
cold water immediately to keep from turning brown. 
Put on with enough water to just cover. Be sure and 
use either an agate or porcelain-lined kettle. Let boil 
until the apples are soft. Pour apples and all into a 
cheese cloth bag and let juice drip through without 
squeezing, but be sure and get all substance, then drip 
through a flannel bag to get clear. 

Use 2 glasses of juice to 2 glasses sugar, always boil a 
small quantity at a time, it will be clearer and lighter. 
Boil on a quick fire until it drops from the spoon, then 
pour at once into glasses. Let ptand until cold, then 



TWENTIETH CENTURY COOK BOOK. 367 

dip a piece of writing paper in whiskey and lay on top 
of jelly, and seal tightly with the covers, or paper fast- 
ened down with the white of an egg or mucilage.

bag. Measure i cupful juice to i cupful sugar, and 
cook same as Apple Jelly. 

Strawberry Jelly. No. 2. 

Put on the strawberries with a very little water, cook 
until the berries are soft, then pour into a flannel bag, 
and let the juice drip. Use same quantity of sugar as 
berries. Cook only i or 2 glasses at a time. 

Peach Jelly. 

Use peaches not too ripe, cut them up without peel- 
ing and add a few of the peach kernels. Boil until the 
peaches are soft, then proceed same as for Apple Jelly.

Ctirrant Jelly. 

Select fresh, sound currants not too ripe. Pick and 
wash well, and place them in an agate kettle on the 
stove, stir often from the bottom with a wooden spoon. 
When they are thoroughly scalded, not boiled, pour 
into a clean bucket and mash them thoroughly with a 
pounder. Strain through a flannel jelly bag, measure 
the juice and use the same quantity of sugar. By 
boiling only 2 or 3 glasses at one time, the jelly will be 
brighter. Boil on a hot fire until it drops from a 
spoon, then pour into jelly glasses. 

Currant and Raspberry Jelly. 

Use equal parts of currants and raspberries. Wash 
and pick them, and proceed same as for Currant Jelly.

water is reduced to about i^ quarts, or less. This 
will require 4 or 5 hours. Remove from the fire, 
strain through a fine sieve, and put in the ice box in a 
bowl to jelly. Next morning, put the jelly in an 



TWENTIETH CENTURY COOK BOOK. 369 

agate boiler on the stove, when, it begins to boil, add 
the stiff beaten whites of 5 eggs, also the crushed shells. 
Boil until perfectly clear, then strain through a flannel 
bag like jelly (do not squeeze), add sugar and sherry

and place in kettle over the fire, with enough water to 
cover. When the sugar and water boil until syrupy, 
add the peaches and allow to boil until they can be 
pierced with a fork, no longer. Always use a silver fork. 

Heat air-tight jars in hot water and fill with the 
peaches and syrup to overflowing, screw on tops and 
put aside to cool gradually. When cold see that tops 
are tight, and put away in a cool, dark place. 

Canned Pears. 

Pare the fruit and leave the stems on, if large cut

hot vinegar over pickles, and seal jars. In two days, 
drain off vinegar, boil again, and pour over pickles. 
Let stand two days more, and do this the third time. 
Seal until ready for use. 

Mustard Pickles. No. 2. 

Use only large yellow cucumbers. Peel with a silver 
knife, halve, then quarter lengthwise, and scrape out 
all seeds and soft part. Salt thoroughly and leave in 
brine over night. Next morning wipe each piece with 
a dry cloth and lay in a stone jar. 

Place over the fire enough white wine vinegar to 
cover the pickles. To j/^ gallon add i cupful mustard 
seed, I tablespoonful celery seed, 2 or 3 pods red 
pepper, and yi cupful brown sugar. When this 
reaches boiling point, pour it over the cucumbers and 
cover closely until ready for use. They can be eaten 
10 days after preparing. 

Cucumber Salad. 

Peel cucumbers and slice J^ inch thick. Salt well 
and leave over night. 

Peel, slice, and salt onions, in the proportion of i 
quart of onions to i peck of cucumbers, and leave 
these also over night. The next day drain the brine 
from each and mix. 

Place over the fire white vinegar, 3 pints to the peck, 
with a generous handful of mustard seed, i tablespoon- 
ful of celery seed, 2 or 3 bay leaves, a dozen spice and 
cloves from which the heads have been taken, i cupful 
of sugar, and 3 pods of red pepper. Heat all together, 
and when boiling, drop in the cucumbers and onions 
and allow them to boil up once or twice. Then fill 
air-tight jars, which have been previously heated, 
screw on tops and put away where they will cool 
gradually. When cold, see that the tops are tight. 
Examine occasionally for a month, and if signs of fer- 
mentation appear, re-boil and put in fresh jars.

Pepper Mangoes. 

Rub thoroughly free of dust and grit ^ peck of bell 
peppers. Cut off small ends about i inch deep, and 
with a sharp knife, carefully cut out seeds and cells. 
Sprinkle well with salt and leave over night. This 
amount of peppers will require 2 large heads of hard 
cabbage, i quart of cucumbers, 2 quarts of onions. 
Cut the cabbage fine as for slaw, slice the onions, peel 
and chop the cucumbers, and salt each separately, to 
remain over night 'as the peppers. The next day press 
the cabbage, the onions and the cucumbers free of 
brine, and mix them together with a generous handful 
of mustard seed, a tablespoonful of celery seed, a 
tablespoonful of black pepper, and the seeds of two 
pepper pods. Shake the peppers and ends free of 
salt, fill with this mixture, and tie together with cord. 
Pack in layers in a stone jar and pour over enough 
hot vinegar to cover. Cover jar closely, and allow to 
stand for a week, when they will be ready for use. 



Mangoes. 

During the summer keep a five gallon keg handy. 
Make a brine strong enough to float an egg, then 
throw in it whenever convenient such vegetables as 
small sound onions, cucumbers, small sound heads of 
white cabbage, young mangoes, or small green musk- 
melons (cut a slit in them and remove seeds), cauli- 
flower, and green peppers. 

When ready to make the pickles, take from the keg 
the quantity desired. Soak in fresh water over night. 
Next morning, cut the mangoes in half, chop up the 
other vegetables, add a good quantity of mustard seed, 
less of celery seed, the seeds of 2 pepper pods. Put 
enough white wine vinegar on the fire to fill the jars, 
add just enough sugar to remove the sharp taste of 
the vinegar, add a few spice and cloves. Fill the 
mangoes with the chopped vegetables and seeds, tie

them securely and lay in stone jars. Cover with the 
heated vinegar, tie up securely and put aside for a 
month. 

Pepper Hash. 

Take equal parts of green bell peppers, discarding 
seeds, and white cabbage, chop very fine, and put in 
a kettle on stove. Add enough vinegar and water to 
cover it, allowing i pint of water to every pint of 
vinegar. Let come to a good boil, remove from fire, 
and drain off all liquor. Throw away this liquor, put 
pickle back in kettle, with sufificient strong vinegar to 
cover it, sugar and salt to taste, mustard and celery 
seed. Let come to a boil, and if not hot enough, add 
a few seeds of the bell pepper. Bottle while hot.

peppers, 4 large onions, add ^ cupful sugar, i table- 
spoonful salt, I teaspoonful each white mustard seed, 
allspice and cloves, 4 cupfuls vinegar. Boil 2 hours or 
until thick, then seal in bottles. 

Salt Water or Dill Pickles. 

Use none but perfectly sound cucumbers, have 
them as near one size as possible, the medium-sized ones 
are best. Lay the cucumbers in cold water for 4 or 5 
hours, then drain them, and put them in an earthen 
or stone jar ; first a layer of cucumbers, then a few 
pieces of " dill " or fennel, a little cayenne or black or 
whole peppers, a handful of salt, then another layer of 
cucumbers, and so on until the jar is full ; on topjof all, 
put a layer of fresh grape leaves, fill the jar with water, 
adding i cupful vinegar to every gallon jar of pickles, 
put clean stones on top of leaves to keep the pickles 
under the brine. Taste the brine, and if not strong 
enough add more salt. Cover with a cloth. Examine 
the pickles about once a week, and remove the scum 
that rises. 

It will take from one week to 10 days for these 
pickles to be good. 

How to Keep Fresh Okra all Winter.

BRANDIED FRUITS. 

Melange. No. i. 

This French brandied fruit requires no cooking, is 
very easily made, and will keep any length of time. 

Secure a round earthen crock or vessel, not too high, 
and with a close fitting top to it. 

Begin by putting in i lb. granulated sugar and i 
pint alcohol. Then add any desired fruit, always add- 
ing ^ lb. sugar for every lb. fruit. 

Cherries, peaches, pears, pineapples and plums can 
be used. I prefer the pineapples and peaches. The 
large fruit must be cut in pieces. Berries can be 
added, but I do not like them in it. The fruit need 
not be all put in atone time, but can be added when- 
ever convenient, always adding the required quantity 
of sugar the same time. Cover the jar with the top, 
tie thick brown paper over, then a clean cloth. The 
surplus juice can be cooked thick and used for pud- 
ding sauces. 



Melange. No. 2. 

Take i lb. of rock candy and i qt.of alcohol, put in 
stone jar. Every lb. of fresh fruit that is added must 
be sugared well. Pineapple is best, and peaches are 
very fine. As much more fruit may be added, each in 
season, as desired. Strawberries and raspberries are 
the only berries that should be added, but no more 
alcohol. The fruits make their own juice. Keep in a 
cool, dark place, well covered. 



380 TWENTIETH CENTURY COOK BOOK. 

Brandied Peaches. 

Weigh fruit, and to every lb. of peaches allow i lb. 
sugar. Make a strong solution of soda water, boil and 
drop peaches in, remove immediately, and wipe with a 
towel. This removes all fur, and leaves the skin 
smooth and glossy. Put sugar on to boil, with just 
sufficient water to dissolve it, and a bag of whole spice, 
cinnamon, and cloves. Let syrup boil clear, drop in 
part of peaches, let boil 20 minutes, then put fruit out 
to sun. Drop in remainder of peaches. After fruit is 
removed, let boil down thick. Remove and let cool, 
then add i pt. brandy to every 3 lbs. of sugar. Stir 
well, put peaches in jar, and cover well with syrup. 
Seal and stand in a cool place. 

Brandied Figs. 

Wash the figs in clear water, then prepare same as 
Brandied Peaches. 

Brandied Pears. 

Prepare same as Brandied Peaches, only cook the 
pears a little longer than the peaches as they are 
tougher.
