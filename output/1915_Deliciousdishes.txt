To the Housewife : 

" The proof of the pudding is in the eating." 

But upon what constitutes the pudding depends the 
verdict and in my varied experience in cooking, three essentials 
in all goods must be considered to insure delicious and palatable 
dishes and those characteristics are — first, brand, — second, 
flavor, — and third, nutrient qualities ; for unless you know your 
brand you cannot be sure of the quality. 

And in the many cities that I have given lectures on the art 
of cooking, Denver stands pre-eminently at the top of the list, 
for here I know my demonstrations are at their best because I 
simply order a complete line of Solitaire Groceries, as shown in 
the back of the book, my previous experience having shown that 
every can or package is the acme of excellence, possessing 
delicacy of flavor as well as being nutritive. From the Solitaire 
line I have been able to obtain practically all the ingredients 
necessary for my most exacting recipes. 

To the housewives desiring to excel, I would recommend 
that they use Solitaire Groceries, knowing from actual use all 
items under this label are of the finest quality and if you wish 
the verdict of your pudding to be " Best, " Solitaire will furnish 
the proper ingredients. 

Sincerely,

HOW TO MEASURE ACCURATELY 



A system of accurate measurements is absolutely necessary to in- 
sure success. Scientific training has exploded the old idea, that "with 
good judgment and experience 
measuring ingredients by sight will 
do." The exact quantity called for 
measured each time in the same 
utensil, whatever it be, cup, table- 
spoon or teaspoon, are definite 
guides that must be followed if 
success would be attained. Enam- 
eled measuring cups, marked 
plainly in quarters or thirds, each 
holding a half-pint; a teaspoon 
holding sixty drops; a tablespoon 
of ordinary size (do not mistake a 
dessert spoon for this spoon), and 
a case knife, are the few essentials 
that must be used for measuring 
ingredients in the recipes incor- 
porated in this book. These uten- 
sils may be purchased at any 
kitchen-furnishing shop for a nomi- 
nal sum. JUU TABLESPOON HALT TABLESPOON QSMRJER TABUSPOOH 




TO MEASURE INGREDIENTS 

All flour, meal, confectioners' powdered and granulated sugar, Boda 
and other dry ingredients that are put into cartons or cans that are apt 
to settle, and in some cases harden, should be sifted before measuring. 
This suggestion is not to be ignored if you would be successful, as well 
as economical, for by sifting these ingredients they are lightened and 
made to go further. 



A Cupful 



A cupful means all the cup will hold; the cup is filled with a table- 
spoon heaping full, then leveled with a knife. Great care must be taken 
not to shake the cup. All dry ingredients are tossed lightly into the 
cup, then leveled with a knife.

Measuring Liquids 



Place the cup to be filled on a saucer and fill it to the brim. A 
cupful of liquid could not be carried safely across the kitchen without 
spilling some of its contents. 



Measuring Butter, Lard, Etc, 

Fats used for shortening are packed solidly in cups, table or tea- 
spoons and leveled with a knife. A pair of measuring cups will be 
found very convenient when measuring ingredients. One for the dry 
and the other for the shortening and liquids. One cup may serve the 
purpose if dry ingredients are measured first, then liquids and fats, 
when such ingredients are called for. 



Tablespoons and Teaspoons 

Tablespoons of regulation size are filled and leveled with a knife. 
A teaspoon is filled and leveled with a knife. To measure liquids, a 
table or teaspoon means all the spoon will hold. To measure dry in- 
gredients in table or teaspoon, dip the spoon in the ingredient. When 
filled, lift and level with knife, sharp edge of blade turned toward 
handle of spoon. Dividing with knife lengthwise of the bowl of spoon 
is a half-teaspoonful. Dividing the half crosswise is a fourth, and 
dividing the fourth crosswise is one-eighth. Divisions are made in the 
teaspoon the same. Less than an eighth of a teaspoon is a few 
grains. 



Combining Ingredients 

The next very important step toward success in all cookery is in 
combining ingredients and mixtures; and one too often disregarded by 
the amateur. There are three movements considered in combining 
ingredients — stirring, beating, and cutting and folding. 

Stirring is combining ingredients by circular motions, enlarging 
and repeating these motions until all ingredients are thoroughly 
blended. This motion is most commonly used in all cookery, either 
alone or alternating with beating. 

Beating is accomplished by cutting down through ingredient or 
ingredients with a mixing spoon, or a similar utensil, from top to bot- 
tom, turning ingredients over and over, cutting through them until 

"TO THE RIM OF THE WORLD FOR THE FINEST."

Delicious Dishes 



all are thoroughly blended and lightened. By this motion ingredients 
are not only blended, but air, also, is incorporated, which increases 
the lightness of the mixture. 

Cutting and Folding means to combine two mixtures, one made 
very light by thorough beating or whipping, as heavy cream or whites 
of eggs. This is a combination of the two former motions. It is best 
accomplished with a wooden spoon made for this purpose. These re- 
peated vertical downward motions made with this spoon is called 
cutting, and turning the ingredients over and over, allowing the spoon 
with each turn to come in contact with the bottom of the bowl, is 
called folding. Repeat these motions until the ingredients are thor- 
oughly blended without destroying the air bubbles previously made by 
beating or whipping one part of the mixture. Briefly: 

To stir means blending ingredients. 

To heat means lightening the mixtures by incorporating air. 

To cut and fold is combining two mixtures (one of which has 
been made light by beating) in such a manner as to prevent the 
escape or loss of air previously introduced. 



Standard Table of Weights and Measures 

All measurements are made level. 
A teaspoon of regulation size holds sixty drops. 
Three teaspoons of liquid equal one tablespoon. 
Four tablespoons of liquid equal one-half gill or one-quarter cup. 
Two gills equal one cup. 
Two cups equal one pint. 
Two pints (four cups) equal one quart. 
Four cups of liquid equal one quart. 
Four cups of flour equal one pound or one quart. 
Two cups of butter packed solidly equal one pound. 
One-half cup of butter packed solidly equals one-quarter pound, 
or four ounces. 

Two cups granulated sugar equal one pound. 

Two and one-half cups powdered sugar equal one pound. 

Two cups of milk or water equal one pound.

Fnnrfanf boiling-point. Let boil two minutes, then strain 

1 un,u,ciri.i. through double cheesecloth. To this add 2i/o 

pounds sugar and Vl teaspoon cream of tartar. 
Place on range and stir until mixture begins to boil; then cook, with- 
out stirring, until a soft ball is formed that will keep its shape when 
a small portion is dropped into ice water. As the sugar adheres to 
sides of saucepan, wash down with a small brush dipped in cold water. 
Pour slowly on a slightly oiled marble slab or a large platter. Let 
stand for a moment or two to cool, but not long enough to harden 
around the edges. Scrape fondant from the edges with a chopping 
knife or a spatula to one end of slab, and work with a wooden spatula 
or thin-edged "paddle" until creamy. 

This work must be done quickly, for the fondant will soon become

with the hands until smooth and velvety. While kneading add 1 tea-

in until all is used. Pack in a bowl, cover with paraffin paper and let 
stand two days. Shape and dip in "Dot" chocolate, place on platter

Select a clear day for making fondant to insure success, as a moist

For White Fondant follow this method exactly, omitting the coffee.

turn to pot and add 14 cup of cold water to complete the clearing. Place 
on back of range where coffee will keep hot (but not boil) for ten 
minutes. Serve at once in warm cups with hot milk or cream. 

If coffee does not boil it will be muggy; if it boils too long the bit- 
ter principle is extracted and the delicious flavor is destroyed. 

If for any reason the coffee must stand longer, it should be drawn 
off the grounds into another hot pot and keep it at a uniform tem- 
perature.

water to complete the clearing. Remove to back of range for ten 
minutes, where coffee will keep hot (but not boil). Serve immediately 
in small, warm, after-dinner coffee cups, with or without sugar. Fil- 
tered coffee is prepared by the epicure, where hot milk or cream is 
not used, as is the invariable rule with Cafe Noir (black coffee). Owing 
to its stimulating qualities, Cafe Noir taken after a heavy meal often 
proves very beneficial.

THE BEST WAY TO MAKE TEA 

Freshly drawn water brought quickly to the boiling point is the 
first item of importance. The second is a clean agate-ware or earthen 
teapot. The third, and most important, is the quality of tea used. 

When the water has reached the boiling point, scald the teapot, 
already cleaned; put into it MOREY'S SOLITAIRE TEA, in the propor- 
tion of 2 teaspoons of tea to 2 half-pint measuring cups of boiling 
water; let it infuse three or four minutes. But do not allow it to boil. 

If the tea is too strong, dilute it with boiling water; if not strong 
enough, do not try to secure greater strength by longer steeping, but 
increase the quantity of tea to 3 teaspoons of tea to the same amount 
of water. All the tea should be drawn off the leaves at the first serving. 

The Afternoon "^^^ afternoon tea, whether served informally or 
^ '^ as a more pretentious function, has not only 

Tea grown in popularity, but it has become a per- 

manent feature of American hospitality. The 
Five o'clock Tea is an old-time custom of our English cousins. 
The TdeRl Tea,- '^^^ American hostess is rapidly becoming a con- 
rr uic> ^.~ noisseur regarding teas. She has found that the 
I Bole CyerVlCe success of the afternoon tea depends almost en- 
tirely upon the quality of tea used on her tea- 
table. Since TEA is the feature of this popular social function, her 
attention immediately turns to a careful investigation of this important 
item. 

She finds it in all its perfection of ambrosial sweetness and aro- 
matic odor in MOREY'S SOLITAIRE TEAS — the very acme of pure, 
high-grade accessions to her tea-table. 

With these delicious teas, dainty china, silver and linen, served 
with some of the following tea-table delicacies, and attractively gar- 
nished, the success of "Milady's" Afternoon Tea is assured.

of Tea in the teakettle. Fill 2 warm cups % full of the 

{Made with the Tea-Ball) water; put the ball into first one cup and then 

the other, lifting the ball up and down until the 
desired strength is obtained (which may be determined by the color 
as well as the taste). Do not allow the ball to remain in the cups more 
than four minutes. The tea-ball will be found a great convenience 
when making but one or two cups of tea. 

MoreUS Soli- MOREYS solitaire teas are made and 

^ . served in either the dining or drawing room and 

tatre Five the Five o'clock Tea-kettle (Samovar) and the 

o'eloeh Tea tea-ball or teapot are used. Other attractive tid- 

"^ ^ bits are served with the tea, such as dainty 

wafers, small, thin, sweet sandwiches, conserves, etc., etc.

Cover fruit. 

Pour brandy or whiskey over fruit, let stand over night. Add 
flour alternately to first mixture with cordial and jelly, add melted 
chocolate, then add the fruit; mix thoroughly and then cut and fold 
in the stiffly beaten whites of eggs. Continue beating until the in- 
gredients are thoroughly blended. Turn mixture into a large but- 
tered tube pan, lined with four layers of paper, buttering the last 
layer thoroughly. Put the citron in thin alternate layers with mix- 
ture, taking care that the last layer is not citron; in this way there 
will be no burnt ends of citron distributed over top of cake when 
baked. Place cake in a moderate oven and bake slowly three hours. 
Do not allow cake to brown the first hour of baking. Cake should 
begin to brown the beginning of the second hour ef baking; if neces- 
sary, cover cake with a buttered paper to prevent browning too fast. 
Remove paper the last hour of baking. Let cake stand inverted on 
a cake cooler until slightly cooled; then remove from pan, peel off 
the paper and, when cold, spread with boiled frosting and decorate 
with candied fruits.
