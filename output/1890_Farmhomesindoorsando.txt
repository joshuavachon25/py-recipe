FARM HOMES 



IN. DOORS AND OUT-DOORS. 



CHAPTER I. 
BUILDING. 



Some one has intimated that he who has eyes for seeing 
is a very wealthy man — he owns the landscape ! Whoever 
is blessed with eyes, then, owes it to God and to his fel- 
low-man that he should contribute his mite of beauty 
and cheerfulness to the world around him. 

In no way can he do this with more telling effect than 
in creating a lovely home, in building a comfortable and 
attractive house, and making the most and best of its 
surroundings. No matter how small his possessions may 
be, or how plain and cheap his materials, it is always 
possible for every farmer to make the landscape a little 
more pleasing, from the fact of his having a hand in it. 

If this seems a small achievement, and one without 
** profit," let the reader call to mind those farm-houses 
— seen too often — whose ricketty fences, unkempt door- 
yards, and scattered tools, are an ugly blot upon nature's 
fair page, and I am sure he will feel the great moral as 
well as financial meaning that lies in even the humblest 
expressions of beauty, thrift, and order — a meaning that 
(9)

announces pretty clearly, in farming regions, the differ- 
ence bet<\reen the man and the sluggard — ^between the 
genuine and worthy ^Mord of the soil" and the slack- 
Bouled pauper who makes no honorable return to the 
acres that feed him. 

It is a great thing to build the house that is to be one's 
home. There are few pleasures so unalloyed as that of 
selecting the ground, laying the foundation, and watch- 
ing day by day the growth of wall and roof that go to 
form one's own secure kingdom through the years to 
come. And it is a pleasure that cannot be entered upon 
too seriously. If there are to be but three rooms, they 
will constitute the home, and the opportunity exists to 
make them either charmingly cozy and cheerful, or de- 
pressingly ugly. Therefore, even a small hoUse-plan 
should be well considered. A house-plan is easily torn . 
down and remodelled ; it costs nothing to add a paper 
window here, or to remove a paper partition there ; a 
pencil line changes a staircase or enlarges the dining- 
room ; a few moments of inexpensive reflection lets the 
morning sunlight into a cheerless kitchen, builds a 
clothes-press, and remodels the pantry; or, if something 
better is thought of, the whole establishment can be 
easily tossed aside, and not even the shadow of the house- 
mover's bill presents itself. But, having put a plan into 
solid timber and mortar, and then coming to find how 
greatly the house might be improved — ah, woe the day ! 
It is no idle thing to meddle with the stair-cases and 
partitions, and the gloomily-lighted kitchen. 

THE SITE. 

The building site is, of course, the first thing to be con- 
sidered. One's first resolution regarding it should be to 
avoid all anxiety to jump into the road. A house crowding 
upon the highway loses all dignity and home-like repose, 
and gains nothing but dust. Such choice of location may 



BUILDIXG. . 11 

possibly be an hereditary trait, coming down from that 
long ago time, when houses grew up along the faintly- 
marked trails of emigration, and closely clung there, as 
if in mortal fear of savages and wild animals lurking in 
the back-ground. But in these peaceful days, it is in 
better taste to sit back in a leisurely and composed way, 
as if not afraid of one's own fields and woodlands, but at 
home and happy with them. Let no site be chosen be- 
cause of its proximity to the road, or because it is 
'* handy to water." Select the finest spot on the farm — 
a place combining, if possible, elevation, eastern and 
southern frontage, natural trees, a pleasant outlook, and 
make all else conform to it: 

If there is a stream of water or a lake in the vicinity, 
try to have a glimpse of it for the living-room windows. 
A landscape without a bit of water in it is almost as piti- 
ful as the face of a blind man, as any one will testify who 
has once lived by babbling brooks or near the shores of 
lake or ocean. 

There are opportunities for improving all building 
sites. The farmer priding himself upon his ^'^ good, 
hard common sense," may sneer at the term "landscape 
gardening," but properly pruned trees, a well-ktpt 
stretch of turf, and shrubberies planted in the right 
place, are just ^s much to his credit as a good barn or 
staunch fences. Landscape gardening need not neces- 
sarily mean littering one's grounds with rubbishy rock- 
eries and puny evergreens, or cutting them up with de- 
vious paths and drives. To bring the best into notice, 
and to soften or put out of sight that which is not attrac- 
tive, is all that is required. Simple but correct touches 
will tell. A light foot-bridge thrown over the brook 
where it winds into view between the willows of the mea- 
dow, two or three rustic seats grouped under some near 
shade tree, a great vase (made of a section of hollow 
^ ^Ued and surrounded with hardy, climbing vines. 



12 FARM HOMES, IN-DOORS AND OUT-DOORS. 

and placed near the curve of the carriage-way, a spacious 
sweep of beautiful turf sloping away to meet the darker 
verdure of a leafy hedge, a few firs or pines planted 
where winter sunsets may glow through them — these 
and similarly simple "landscape" touches add wonder- 
fully to the attractions of a farm-house, and mark the 
difference between the intelligent and progressive farmer 
and the dull plodder who never lifts his eyes above the 
gi'ound, and believes in letting well enough alone. 

THE PLAN. 

After the site is decided upon, and one knows the 
point of compass he is to face— which I sincerely hope is 
squarely south or squarely east, or squarely anywhere, 
rather than a disagreeable "bias," which always makes 
the sun seem out of gear and the pole-star hopelessly 
dislodged — let the plans be brought out and studied for a 
while. 

Here, among house-plans, a worthy field is open to 
women. They, who live so constantly within doors, 
should have a controlling voice in all interior arrange- 
ments. They know, or ought to know, how a certain 
number of rooms can be planned, so as to secure con- 
venience and cheerfulness to their occupants, and they 
will naturally be more thoughtful, as architects, of all 
details pertaining to comfort, and the easier carrying on 
of household routine. The man-mind always means 
well, as a general thing, but it is sometimes too grand to 
focus itself upon an easy angle in a staircase, a comer- 
cupboard, the one best place for the pantry-window, or 
the extra door that saves so many steps for tired feet. 
Things like these would be taken into consideration, if 
women would plan their own homes, or, at any rate, 
have a voice in regard to some of the details of home- 
building. It ought to enter into every woman's education 
to know how to plan a thoroughly cheerful, convenient, 



BUILDING. 13 

and healthful house ; to know how to make the best of 
even a three-roomed cottage, as well as the statelier man- 
sion which it may be her good fortune to possess. 

Young country-girls, it rests largely with you to up- 
lift and adorn and dignify farm-life ! — to so refine and 
brighten and enrich that which is now so often bleak and 
ugly and barren, that your brothers, mstead of breaking 
away to clerkships and offices, or something worse, will be 
loth to leave their noble farm-homes ; and you yourselves 
will find something better there than in the back-rooms 
of milliners' shops, or the unhealthf ul slavery of a dress- 
maker's sewing-machine. 

TJiere is a great deal of talk in the household depart- 
ments of newspapers and magazines about making homes 
attractive, and the bulk of it is in regard to barrel-chairs, 
fancy match-safes, and embroidered lambrequins. 
These things are well enough ; but, my country-, 
girl, go you much deeper than this line of decora- 
tion, and begin at the ground- work of things ! Draw 
plans of your future home, and review them with John 
or Charles — or whatever his dear name may be — until you 
have one so good, and yet so in keeping with the money 
to be invested, that life within it will be a satisfaction 
and a blessing. Build a permanent home — or the begin- 
ning of one — at the outset, and give it all possible graces, 
instead of settling down in some ugly little square box 
of a ** temporary" character, witii the intention of 
building a grand house when the '* better times" come. 
The Better Times are when youth and health and love 
join hands, and set out upon the Journey of life together. 
Build the home now, and though you commence with 
only a kitchen and a bedroom, the seasons will come and 
go, bringing their gifts of improvement and beauty, and 
thirty years hence your home will be a far sweeter and 
loA^lier abode than any grand " new house," at such a 
time, can possibly be.

THE FOUR ESSENTIALS. 

In planning a house, let four essential points be kept 
in view — Drainage, Sunlight, Ventilation, and a Bath- 
room. These features can be compassed even in the 
smallest cottage, and yet thousands of farm-houses are 
being completed to-day without a thought of them. It is 
cheering to reflect, however, that other thousands of 
farm-houses are going up wherein these vital considera- 
tions have been kept first and foremost. Progress in 
building-reform is unnecessarily slow, especially in the 
new Western States, and wives and daughters should set 
themselves to thinking and studying about these things, 
and so hasten on the millenium of right living. 

SUNLIGHT. 



The sun, if you will only open your house to him, is a 

faithful physician, who 
will be pretty constant in 
attendance, and who will 
Bend in no bills. Many 
years ago glass was some- 
thing of a luxury, but 
now we can all have good- 
sized windows, and plen- 
ty of them, at moderate 
cost, and there is no ex- 
cuse for making mere 
loop-holes, through 
which the sun can cast 
but half an eye, and from 
whicli one can gain only

narrow glimpses of the beautiful outer world.

character of many country people to know that expres- 
sions of disdain will come from some quarters when I

mention Bay Windows. Nevertheless bay mndows a,re a 
good thing. Their eSect is very mucli like letting 
heaven into one's house, at least it ought to be like that, 
for it is nothing but absurdity and wickedness to darken 
such windows with shutters or heavy curtains until only 
a struggling ray of sunlight can be seen. 

If bay windows are too expensive, a very desirable sub- 
stitute can be had by placing two ordinary sized windows 




Fig". 2. — A KITCUEN WINDOW. 

sicfe by side with a wide capacious ledge at the bottom 
for seats or for plants. 

A room with a window like this cannot fail to be 
cheery, and its effect in a simple cottage house is quite 
sumptuous. There is likewise in its favor the fact that 
it is less exposed than the deep bay window to outer heat 
and cold. 

In a kitchen or in a child's bedroom, or in an attic 
where the walls are low, two half-wmdows set side by 
side and made to slide or to open on hinges, admit a 
broad, generous light, and give an apartment a pretty 
and pleasing rustic air. 

Let the builder endeavor to have all rooms in daily use.

especially bedrooms and sitting-rooms, well lighted by 
the sun. "To sleep on unsunned beds in unsunned 
chambers, and to work day after day in Unsunned rooms, 
is the unrepented sin of half the nation," vigorously 
affirms a prominent writer. But this should not be said 
of that portion of the nation living in the country far 
from those towering brick walls whose steps take hold on 
basement kitchens, and in whose depressing shadows 
many lives must necessarily be spent. In the country, 
with a whole sky to draw from, let there be light! If 
any rooms in the house must look solely to the north for 

illumination, let them 
be the parlor and the 
spare chamber. People 
who come and go can 
be cheerful for a while 
in a north-windowed 
apartment, but the 
constant dwellers in a 
house need its sunniest 
rooms. 

Verandas are most 
desirable on the south 
and west sides of a 
house, for while they 
ward off the mid-day 
heat of summer, they 
still freely admit the 
low down winter sun. 
From east windows we can hardly have too much light 
even in summer, and bedrooms and nurseries should be 
planned to receive the full benefit of them. 

Here is an example of a farm-house, large and well 
built, so far as material and finish go, that for want of 
intelligence and forethought, or both, is almost devoid of 
sunlight in its most used rooms.

The wide veranda — very pleasant in itself — shuts off 
the winter sun by the time it is two hours high, and the 
rooms are arranged with such ingenious stupidity that 
those in common use have no sunlight whatever for the 
remainder of the day. To be sure, in summer it is "de- 
lightfully cool " in this house, (so it is in most caves 
and dungeons ! ) 
and always there 
is some one of the 
numerous family 
"ailing" within its 
walls — which is not 
at all delightful. 

In plan number 
four is a house cost- 
ing many hundreds 
less, but worth 
many thousands 
more, because it is 
so cheerfully and 
healthfully light- 
ed. The dining- 
room — which in 
my opinion should 
always have a large 
east • window — is 
the least pleasant, 
especially on rainy 
mornings ; but a fire in the open stove or fire-place, and the 
mirror above it reflecting the window opposite, make it a 
very tolerable room. On the second floor are four large 
sunny bedrooms, and above is a long, well-lighted* garret 
or attic, which makes a fine play-room for the children 
in stormy weather. 

Plan number five was designed for a young farmer of 
small family and small means, and Is found to be delight-

Number six is the ground plan of a small house perch- 
ed nest-like upon a picturesque knoll with its dark pines 
and brilliant maples. Within doors it is quite airy and 
regal because of its high walls, wide windows, and the 
graceful arch opening opposite the entrance, displaying 
the gay little dining-room with its large east window 
filled with plants. On the second floor are two capacious 
bedrooms and a small room for clothing, bedding, etc. 
Among small farm-homes one seldom sees a more 
thoroughly satisfactory plan than this — combining as it 
does comfort, cheapness, and economy. A man and wife 
just beginning house-keeping might exist very passably 
by dispensing with the upper story and adding a small 
wing for kitchen and extra bedroom, devoting the space 
occupied by the stair-case to china and linen closets. But 
the cost of the upper floor is comparatively small, and it

a young farmer's wife first 
dreamed it out upon paper 
until she had cheerfulness 
and utility successfully 
combined. Then she gave 
the plan to her husband — § 
wise and appreciative man. 
He built it to the letter, 
and neither have had cause 
to regret this little branch- 
ing out from the ordinary 

model of cheap farm-houses

anything but beds. 

Just here I want to enter my humble protest against 
any parlor that pinches and stints other rooms in order 
to exist. First secure the convenient kitchen, the pleas- 
ant dining-room, the well-sunned and well-ventilated 
bedrooms, the bath-room, the ample pantry and milk- 
room. Then, if space permits, have a parlor by all 
means — as pretty a parlor as possible — and use it. It 
is bad taste and bad morals to make " most anything " 
answer for family use day after day, while the best room 
and the best of everything is sacredly reserved for outside 
people, people who are not greatly benefited after all, for 
when we visit do we not observe that it is the cordial hos-

pitality, the friendly talk, the simple, easily served meal 
that we enjoy, and not the stiff atmosphere of a seldom 

used room, the laborious-

ly prepared dishes and 
the general feeling that 
we are creating an unusu- 
al and perhaps trouble- 
some stir in the every 
day lives of our friends ? 
Unless a home-keeper 
can afford to keep help 
and so find time to enjoy 



her parlor with her family, it is better to defer such an 
apartment. A cozy little nook off the dining-room, sepa- 
rated from it by an arched space, or a little recess with- 
out the arch, but having a 
pleasant window and an easy 
chair or two, are good sub- 
stitutes. In such a place a 
visitor can sit and feel that 
pleasurable comfort of being 
in a " home " room and giving 
no one any trouble or distress. 

So, if either the parlor or 
some one of these aforemen- 
tioned rooms must be given 
up, let the parlor go, and [~ 
make the rest of the house so 
sweet and sunny and beautiful 
that it will never be missed. 

Clean, well-kept houses 
built from plans like numbers 
seven, eight and nine can cheerfully wait until added 
parlors can be afforded. 

Sometimes in pioneer regions or in cases of very small 
means, the house-builder is obliged to dispense with both

parlor and dining-room. But even in snch instances a 
house can be attractive. I know a western farm-house 
where the parlor, dining-room, kitchen, library, hall, re-* 
ception-room and conservatory are all combined in one 
apartment, and yet such is the skill and taste of the 
woman presiding over it that sitting there in the large, 
sunshiny, orderly room, one falls in love Avith its pic- 
turesque simplicity, and feels that henceforth partitions 

and foldnig - doors 

and windmg stair- 
cases are vain and 
wearisome superflui- 
ties. Square and 
rather ugly looks the 
house outwardly, 
with its weather-

within all is bright 
and cheery, a vein of

ty-f our feet, and there are no chambers. The bedrooms are 
small but sunny, and possess no carpets or superfluous 
furniture. A small fire-place built of rough stone, but with 
good draught lights up the dining-room — the cook-stove 
retiring with the modesty of true merit toward the end 
of the apartment. Where everything pertaining to 
kitchen- work is kept is a mystery until the time for tea 
approaches, when the bright woman opens a cupboard 
here, pulls out a drawer there, whisks off the ornamental 
roof of the retiring cook-stove, and presto ! — what was a. 
few moments ago a quiet sitting-room with its work- 
basket, open book, and rocking-chair, is now an animated

coals. 

While the bright woman spreads the table she archly 
invites you to take a book from the library and find a 
seat in the conservatory until called for. So from four 
long shelves shielded from dust by a neat screen, you 
select some fresh volume or periodical that you hardly 

expected to see in such

betake yourself to the

serving its architecture 
you see that a south and 
east window are placed 
quite near each other, 
their broad sills joining 
and holding an array of 
wisely chosen and wisely 
cared for plants. Across

chair among the heliotropes and geraniums and tea-roses, 
with whose fragrance the spirit of Java and the savory 
smell of broiling chicken cheerfully mingle, and you feel 
that life has a great many mercies. 

Do I diverge from the business of building ? No, I 
am only trying to show what a builder and a builder's 
wife can do with one room. 



BUILDING. 23 

The numerous cupboards and drawers set into the wall 
and nearly covering one side of this pleasant living-room 
were devised by this bright woman herself, and formed 
some of her husband's rainy-day work in the first year of 
their pioneer life. 

There is a tiny low-down cupboard for her little girl's 
dolls and tea-sets, and a larger one above it for the 
twelve-year-old son's collection of shells and minerals, 
fish-lines, nails, strings, knives, and all those odds and 
ends dear to a boy's heart. And there are drawers for 
bed and table linen and best dresses and Sunday coats ; 
drawers for shawls, blankets, stockings and flannels ; and 
a drawer that pulled out proves to be a molding-board 
with a row of little boxes at the back holding spices, salt, 
etc. Above these are cupboards for dishes and general 
dining and kitchen ware, and the pots and kettles, brooms, 
dusters, dish-pans, and smoothmg irons find a place in a 
tall corner cupboard. Our hostess oiled and varnished 
all the wood-work in this room with her own hands, and 
its mellow rich tint brightened up with the numerous 
brass handles and fastenings of the cupboards and 
drawers, is in good keeping with the quaint fire-place and 
the homely substantial furniture. 

When I suggested that an extra large ''bump" of 
order must be required to keep so many drawers and 
cupboards at rights, the bright woman replied that main- 
taining order was the easiest thing in the world, since 
there was a place for every article, and that she could 
prepare a meal in the night without light, if no light 
could be had, almost as easily as in the day time. 

This house — to which a "wing" will be added in a 
year or two for parlor, a bath-room, and a spare bed- 
room — shows how much can be made of little, how space 
can be utilized, and what clevei magicians are order and 
taste aided by a very httle money ! 



24 FARM HOMES, IN-DOORS AND OUT-DOORS. 

HALLS. 

If one's house must be small and the rooms few, still 
a hall or some sort of pleasant vestibule ought to be 
afforded, rather than have the living-room or parlor open 
abruptly into the open air. It is good for family habits, 
too, that the children have a regular place for hats and 
caps, and an opportunity before a hall mirror to see that 
they are presentable prior to appearing in the sittmg or 
dining-room. Such little household regulations teach 
children order and seK-control. 

This moral view of the Hall brings up another con- 
sideration. There are many kind-hearted, fair-minded 
house-keepers who regard the main entrance of their 
houses as being too sacred for daily use, and prefer that 
husband and children and intimate friends should ''run 
around " to a side or a kitchen door. This is a mistake. 
Better live in a hut with but one entrance than have a 
door-way too grand for those nearest us to walk through ! 
Indeed, the burden of these chapters will be that we had 
best have nothing that is ''too good for human nature's 
daily food." 

But these same fair-minded house-keepers will exclaim, 
'' Oh, it is all very well to talk about the footsteps of 
those nearest us, but I can't afford to have my hall-carpet 
covered with mud every day and torn to tatters in six 
months !" 

Of course you cannot afford it, nor can your afford to 
have your" children acquire the careless manners and 
habits that come of the back-door principle. Have a 
door-mat at the hall door, and teach little feet to respect 
it. Have everything everywhere as fine and tasteful as 
means will permit, and lead the children to understand 
that the condition of having good and pretty things to 
use is — care ! — ^just a little thoughtful care. 

If the house is to be large enough, have a hall, and fit 



BUILDING. 25 

it up for daily use. Nothing is so dreary and uninviting 
as the ordinary little hall or "entry" that is found in 
half the houses of quite well-to-do people. It is usually 
dark, narrow, bare, and possessed of stale odors, that sug- 
gest damp umbrellas and yesterday's dinner. There 
seems among very many to be nothing expected of this 
part of the house but gloom and cold oil-cloth, and may be 
a row of pegs for stray hats. Instead of such cheerless 
entrances we ought to have halls that say at once to the 
in-comer, "Welcome!'' — that enfold him in an atmos- 
phere of quiet, comforting, sheltering hospitality. Such 
an atmosphere is possible in even a 6 by 8 room. If, how- 
ever, there are chambers in the house plan, it is good 
economy to have a hall large enough to mclude the stair- 
case and leave ample space for necessary hall furniture 
with, in winter, a stove which will warm up all the upper 
rooms of a moderately-sized house, and pay for itself 
and the fuel it consumes over and over again in the in- 
creased good health and comfort of the family. 

A hall should be pleasantly but not glaringly lighted ; 
and it is a great saving of carpets and the house-mother's 
feelings to have the floor made of alternate strips of dark 
and light wood, if the somewhat expensive process can 
be afforded. 

BATH-EOOMS. 

Bath-rooms, or good conveniences for bathing, ought to 
be found in every farm-house ; and yet it is an unpleasant 
fact that they are often entirely lacking, and that a daily 
or semi- weekly "all over" bath is something undreamed 
of by many so-called civilized people who pride them- 
selves upon their neat habits. This really religious duty 
of keeping the whole body clean does not occur to them, 
and the neglect of it is one of the numerous ways in 
which busy hard-working people abuse themselves. 

Every villa, pretty country cottage, and first-class

26 FARM HOMES, IN-DOORS AND OUT-DOORS. 

farm-house now has its well-appointed bath-room, and so 
may the little three-cornered *' shantie," or the log cabin 
of the pioneer, have its possibihties for bathing. If all 
cannot command a special room with its ample tubs, 
showers, douches, and convenient supplies of hot and cold 
water, all can have at least the seclusion of a closet — to 
which it is easy to carry a basin of water and a sponge. 

A bit of a room might be built adjoining the kitchen 
with a sliding or hinged window opening near the cook- 
stove, thus securing warmth in winter and bringing the 
"hot and cold water" within arm's reach. Then with 
the addition of a bath-tub, or even a large laundry tub, 
with a piece of rubber hose fixed in the bottom to carry 
off water to the drain, pegs for hanging towels and 
sponges, and a bracket for holding soaps — and that better 
than all soaps, a bottle of ammonia — it is a bath-room 
good enough for a king. 

A very good shower-bath can be had by suspending a 
watering-pot from a strong hook in the ceiling, the 
bather to regulate the showering by means of a string 
attached to the spout. It will be found almost as satis- 
factory as the portable ones sold in house-furnishing 
shops. 

VENTILATION. 

In the country where the purest air can be had, it is a 
pity to be denied the benefit of it. 

In kitchens and living rooms the air is generally pas- 
sable because of the frequent opening of outer doors and 
the brisk draught of cooking and heating stoves. It only 
remains to see that the bedrooms are equally well treated, 
and that too many pairs of lungs are not required to 
breathe in the same apartment. The windows should of 
course be made to let down from the top, as even a small 
opening near the ceiling of a room permits the escape of 
foul air. 



BUILDI>?^G. 27 

An open stove is an excellent feature in a bedroom, 
not only because it helps vastly to maintain a pure state 
of atmosphere, but because it makes pleasant light and 
warmth for the dressing, undressing and bathing of the 
children. Even if kitchens and dinnig-rooms must be 
scrimped a little, endeavor to have the bedrooms, at 
least the nursery-bedroom, large enough to admit a stove 
of this sort. Like the hall stove, it will pay largely. 

There is a '^ Revolving Ventilator" sold at house-fur- 
nishing shops, at one dollar and upwards, which is said to 
be very effective in removing dust and impurity from an 
apartment. The following method of cheap and sim- 
ple ventilation has also been found to be very satisfactory : 

'^Nail or screw a neat strip of wood from one to two 
inches upon the window sill just inside the sash and ex- 
tending across the window. Upon tlie top of the strip 
fasten a piece of " weather-strip "so that there will be 
formed an air-tight joint between the weather-strip and 
the lower sash of the window, whether the latter is closed 
or raised an inch or two — the lower cross-piece of the 
sash sliding on the rubber of the weather-strip as the 
sash rises. With this simple fixture in place, the lower 
sash may be raised enough to admit a stream of air 
between the lower and upper sashes, where they overlap, 
without admitting the least air at the bottom of the 
window. The air thus entering is thrown upward 
toward the ceiling, and has its "chill taken off" before 
descending upon the heads of the occupants of the room. 
The fixture, with its outlet in or near the ceiling for viti- 
ated air, ventilates a small room very satisfactorily. '' 

If it can be afforded, submit this feature of building 
to some intelligent architect, and secure your pure air on 
the latest scientific principles, but if the purse is limited, 
see that all bedrooms and sitting-rooms have some of the 
foregoing simple arrangements. Have, if possible, the 
open fire. A bedroom is never what it ought to be, if in

on which to thrive through the long nights. 

DEAIKAGE AKD PEEVEJ^TABLE FILTH. 

The cleanly care of the body and the ventilation of 
rooms avail not so much, however, if about the house 
there creep and crawl the invisible but none the less terri- 
ble impurities from damp, mouldy cellars, standing pools 
of slop-water, and neglected, barbarous privies. 

** How long we miglit live " exclaims Dr. jN'ichols, " if 
we could only get out of our dirt and that of our neigh- 
bors ! " In the better part of large cities people seem to 
have succeeded very well in "getting out" — thanks to 
the rigid enforcement of sanitary laws ! — and although a 
clogged-sewer pipe lias power to transform the most ele- 
gant mansion into an intolerable dwelling place, it re- 
mains for the country to furnish horrors that would cause 
a sanitarian's hair to stand on end. 

The cheering thing about this rural disregard for health 
laws is that it seems to be an unconscious disregard, a 
sin of thoughtlessness. The tasteful and thrifty farmer 
has his fences, outbuildings, and walks, in faultless repair, 
while in-doors his wife scrubs and polishes, and is a marvel 
of order and neatness ; and yet some villainous cesspool 
brewing its mischief in the insulted air, or some reposi- 
tory of filth — emboweled it may be, m luxuriant vines — 
breathes out its poison day and night, and mocks the 
orderly care of the farmer and the tidy pride of his good 
wife with its unspeakable pollution. 

Could the farmer be permitted to encounter these air- 
poisons in tangible shape, could he, for instance, catch a 
glimpse of diphtheria peeping into the sleepmg-room of 



BUILDIKG. 29 

his beloved little ones, or scarlet fever dogging their steps, 
or typhoid threatening the wife of his heart, would he 
not employ every means to avert them. 

There is no excuse for bad ** gases" about country 
homes. Every owner of an acre of land has the means 
at hand for maintaming a clean atmosphere, providmg 
of course there are no unconquerable marshes or miasmatic 
rivers to deal with. 

The various kinds of tiles for drains for conveying 
away slops and waste waters to points where they may be 
speedily evaporated by wind and sun, are durable, effec- 
tual, and cheap. Placed below the reach of frost at a 
pitch to create a rapid How, they will not become clogged 
and will last a life-time. 

In summers the laundry suds can be applied to the 
garden with good effect, but there should be a kitchen 
sink connecting with the dram not only for convenience 
m disposing of waste water at all times, but to prevent 
the nuisance of frozen slops and ice-clogging, which 
generally occurs when the only opening is outside the 
house. This kitchen pipe can be easily '^flushed" every 
week with boiling suds, and a semi -occasional dose of 
chloride of lime or carbolic acid will keep it clean and 
odorless. 

Kitchen waste In the country very fortunately need not 
await the round of the garbage cart, and can be disposed 
of at any time before it becomes rancid and pestilential. 
Indeed, in well-conducted house-keeping it is not 
*' waste " at all, but wholesome scraps that are well re- 
ceived by the chickens, the pigs, and the soap-fat Jar. 
The little that cannot be disposed of in these ways should 
be burned. There is nothing better than cremation for 
stuff that from neglect or accident becomes unfit for any- 
thmo: else. 

These two sorts of refuse being so easily disposed of, 
the serious thing to consider is the last and the worst, the

old-fashioned privy ; old-fashioned, because in ever new 
first-class, scientifically builded house it has given place to 
something better. This nuisance is too philosophically 
endured. It is by no means a necessary evil, and there is 
no virtue in submitting to its existence. We often see 
heroic attempts to overcome its objectionable features. 
It is made to stand afar off, but distance in this case lends 
no enchantment, and the long walks back and forth in 
all sorts of weather, and the noisome condition of the 
building itself, are often serious exposures to aged people 
and delicate children. Sometimes it is brought nearer, 
taken under the house-roof, curtained and carpeted, and 
then we have " sewer gas " all the year round, and in the 
summer months a nuisance that more or less contaminates 
the whole house. 

The best way to overcome this evil is to adopt the dry- 
earth or ashes system. Because some of the first closets 
manufactured on this principle proved rather unsatisfac- 
tory, no one should be prejudiced against the system 
itself, which is finding wide and wider acceptance 
through improved and perfected machinery. 

In the use of dry earth or ashes, one is as effectual as 
the other, the only difference being that double the 
quantity of ash is required. Both, if properly used, have 
power to completely disinfect and obliterate everything 
that is offensive. To save the small trouble of drying 
and storing earth for winter use, it might be well to use 
ashes through the cold months, but the ease with which 
earth can be had in the country, and the excellent fertil- 
izing purpose to which it can be put after it has per- 
formed its office of disinfectant, make it the most desirable. 

The *' earth closets " sold by dealers are needlessly ex- 
pensive, I think, ranging in prices from the $5 pail up to 
the $40 cabinet elaborately finished in walnut. Beyond 
$10 and $12 they vary in value merely in regard to finish, 
and a man with any gift for planning and joining boards 



BTJILDIKG. 31 

might make one for the comparatively small cost of 
materials. 

There is also a privy fixture intended for either house- 
closets or out-door buildings. It conveys dry earth or 
ashes into the vault from a reservoir of any size chosen, 
and as a disinfectant is just as effectual as the high- 
priced closet. Tlie removal of deposit from a vault is, 
however, not as easily accomplished as in the closet 
arrangement, which merely requires an occasional empty- 
ing of a small box. But in adopting the fixture the 
building can of course be remodelled with a little labor. 
The fixture is sold by closet-dealers and accompanied with 
directions enabling any carpenter to fit it into place. 
Any common privy can be made quite decent and inodor- 
ous by having a little dry earth shoveled into the vault 
every day, and the vault occasionally emptied. A box or 
barrel of earth can be kept in a corner of the building, 
and a very little answers the jmrpose. 

No privy should be used as a receptacle for slops. 
Often in villages and in the country they are, by this 
thoughtless usage, transformed into cesspools, whose far 
reaching poisons — poisoning not only the air, but de- 
scending into wells and cisterns — sooner or later bring- 
ing the doctor's carriage to the door, followed perhaps 
by that still more sombre vehicle, the plumed hearse. 

With good drains, means for promptly disposing of all 
slops, garbage, and decaying matter, the dry-earth princi- 
ple applied to the rank offenses just alluded to, pure 
water, and plenty of sun and air in all the apartments of 
the house, the farmer may safely count on having secured 
the best of "life policies" not only for himself, but for 
every member of his family.

CHAPTER IL 
FINISHING. 

There is a good deal of liglit, but effective, work in 
the finish of a house which women might interest them- 
selves in, and, with a little study and practice, perform 
with their own hands the labor tnat is either left undone 
or given over to high-priced workmen. 

I am confident a happy change would come over our 
farm-houses if the wives and daughters, dwelling in them, 
would take upon themselves the business of studying 
tasteful yet inexpensive ways for improving and embel- 
lishing their surroundings. 

The work of painting, panelling, calcimining, staining, 
varnishing, etc., is not nearly as laborious as ironing 
shirts, molding bread, or scrubbing floors ; and besides, 
when it is finished it remains finished, and, if well done, 
is a "joy forever." 

Suppose the new house cleaved of carpenters anji ma- 
sons, the floors and wood- work cleaned, and all the debris 
of building collected and carried away ; the work that 
now remains to be done should be an attractive task for 
woman-hands, and it should be left to these hands, with 
confidence in their ability to make the very best of even 
the humblest materials. 

The ceilings and walls are first to be considered. The 
mason may have left them smooth and white with the 
pride of his art, "hard-finish," but even this can be im- 
proved. In best rooms it is cold and glaring to the eye, 
while in every-day apartments, in spite of watchful care, 
it soon becomes unsightly from its ability to show every 
slight speck and spot. There are various soft and cheer- 
ful tints far more pleasing to look upon, and which will 



FINISHIl^^G. 33 

longer endure the touches of time. The tints can be 
applied in calcimine or in whitewash, made after the fol- 
lowing recipes. Calcimine is used only on hard-finish, 
while whitewash can be applied to all walls : 



CALCIMIN'E. 



I Soak one pound of white glue over night, then dis- 
ive it in boiling water, and add twenty pounds of Paris 
white, diluting with water until the mixture is of the 
consistency of rich milk. To this any tint can be given 
that is desired. 

Lilac. — Add to the calcimine two parts of Prussian 
bine and one of vermilion, stirring thoroughly, and 
taking care to avoid too high a color. 

Broion, — Burnt umber. 

Gray. — Raw umber, with a trifling amount of lamp- 

ack. 

Rose. — Three parts of vernailion and one of red lead, 
added in very small quantities until a delicate shade is 
produced. 

Lavender. — Make a light blue and tint it slightly with 
^^ermilion. 

^B Straw. — Chrome yellow, with a touch of Spanish 
brown. 

Buff. — Two parts spruce or Indian yellow and one 
part burnt sienna. 

Blue. — A small quantity of Prussian blue will give a 
soft azure tint. Dark blue is never desirable. 

Delicate tints in the foregoing varieties of color are 
always agreeable and tasteful, and so great care must J)e 
taken that they are not too vivid. The tints will always 
appear brighter than in the calcimine pot, and the work- 
man, or work-woman, must keep this fact in mind when 
dding the coloring powders. 




34 FAEM HOMES, IN^-DOORS AND OUT-DOOES. 

It is a good idea to give the ceiling a calcimine two or 
three shades lighter than that of the walls, so it may ap- 
pear merely a delicate reflection of their deeper tones. 
The ceiling can be calcimined with the lighter tint, and 
then more coloring added for the walls. 

AN" EXCELLENT WHITEWASH. 

For other walls than hard-finish, an excellent white- 
wash is made by slaking lime with boiliDg skim-milk 
and adding (for half a bushel of lime) three quarts of 
salt, half a pound of whiting, and a pound of white 
glue, previously dissolved in water. This is a hard and 
durable whitewash, does not easily rub off, and when 
tinted with any of the foregoing shades has about as 
good an effect as calcimine. 

A beginner in the art of whitewashing is apt to be- 
stow half the material on the floor, which is a needless 
waste. By taking a small quantity on the brush at a 
time all splashing is avoided, and after a little practice 
barely a drop will fall on the floor. 

A bright day should be selected for the work. The 
wash must be of the proper consistency — rich milk — or 
it cannot be applied evenly. The strokes should be 
straight and parallel with each other. After the first 
coat is dry, and never before, apply the second one across 
the first. An expert workman leaves no touch of the 
brush visible. When applying the first coat a round 
paint-brush should be used for thoroughly covering all 
comers and small spaces with the wash. 

BORDERS. 

■ If a lady has a little talent and a little leisure for the 
work, she may devote an hour or two each day to the 
coloring of borders at the top of these tinted wall». A 
leafy pattern in grape, ivy, or other trailing vines, with a 



I 



Fiis'isnii^G. 35 

bright bud or berry peeping out here and there, could be 
outlined with the aid of pasteboard patterns, and the 
colors neatly laid on with small brushes. A few feet of 
this bordering finished each day, would be no great tax 
on her time, and when all was completed she would have 
a charming artistic relief for the plain, softly-tinted 
walls. • 

Such decoration should not be attempted, however, 
unless one has a genuine *' knack" for it; but in its 
place can be laid on plain bands of color, or the common 
paper borderings can be used, taking pains to select tliose 
that will have an agreeable effect. For example, for 
gray and stone-colored walls, use warm reds and golden 
greens ; for bluish walls, dark blues and blue-greens, 
brightened with either lemon-yellow or rose-pink ; for 
lavender or lilac walls, borders of golden-yellow and rich 
green ; for buff and pale brown and straw-tinted walls, 
black and gold, with scarlet. 

Very rich and beautiful designs are now seen in wall- 
papers, the prevailing idea being imitations of the tapes- 
tries of olden times — tapestries that probably never fig- 
ured very much in farm-houses, however ; and it is 
likely these papers would seem out of place on walls that 
are at their best when they are genuinely plain and un- 
assuming, and adorned in a manner befitting quiet rural 
surroundings. 



WOOD-WOEK. 



Walls of kitchens and dining-rooms are generally 
finished in wood to the hight of two and a half or three 
feet from the floor. This is a good style, not only be- 
cause it saves the breaking and marring of plaster, but 
because it gives a look of comfort and solidity to the 
apartments. Halls, and even parlors, might be finished 
in the same way, and thus add to the warmth of the 




36 FARM HOMES, IN-DOORS A:N^D OUT-DOORS. 

house and make wall-papering and other decoration an 
easier and less expensive operation. 

An excellent way to dispose of the wood- work in kitch- 
ens, dining-rooms, halls, and pantries, is to oil and var- 
nish the natural wood. Such treatment is more durable 
and less expensive than paint, and the varnished surface 
is easily cleaned, and enriched and mellowed, rather than 
damaged, by time. 

If preferred, a walnut-stain can be applied in dining- 
rooms and halls, in place of oiling the wood. The stain 
can be bought at a drug store ready for applying, or it 
can be made by stirring the powder of burnt umber into 
hot vinegar, regulating the quantities according to the 
amount of surface to be stained. Apply it with a paint 
brush, evenly in up and down strokes, and when dry 
varnish with the best turpentine varnish. 

Mahogany color for staining book-shelves, tables, 
drawers, chests, etc., is obtained by using burnt sienna 
in place of umber. 

If one has time — and it is worth while to take time — 
a very neat hall floor can be made by staining alternate 
boards with walnut-color and then varnishing the whole. 

Or the floor may be stained in blocks by tacking down 
alternate six or eight inch squares of pasteboard and 
applying the stain between them. 

This inexpensive treatment is also desirable for dining- 
room floors — especially for borderings around them, since 
a happy fashion in carpets nowadays is to lay them in 
the form of large rugs, leaving a space of two and a half 
or three feet on all sides of the room. 

One charm of this style lies in the fact that the carpets 
are easily taken up and cleaned without much moving or 
lifting of heavy furniture, which can remain on the 
boards next the wall. In a dining or any other much 
used room, these ''rug" carpets are the only kind that 
should be endured ; and in such rooms a wide bordering 



m;risHii;rQ. . 37 

of neatly stained blocks or stripes will proye to be not 
only pretty and cheerfnl, but a great saving of carpet- 
buying and carpet-sweeping. 

If walnut-stain is thought too dark and sombre for 
parlor and bed-room wood-work, there are various delicate 
shades in paint that can be purchased of druggists or 
manufacturers already mixed, any one of which shades 
are preferable to hard, glaring white. Soft dove, wood, 
and pearl-gray tints, are desirable, and a room looks well 
when painted in two shades of the same color^providing 
the work can bo done by an expert hand. Otherwise, 
let only one shade be attempted. 

MANTELS. 

A fire-place goes farther than anything else in giving to 
a room character and beauty. Every dining-room and 
nursery, at least, should have one. In the cool weather 
of spring and fall, when the morning and evening air is 
a little sharp, or when a long cold rain-storm is making 
everything *' damp, moist and uncomfortable," there is 
nothing more delightful, both for old and young, than a 
brisk fire upon an open hearth. With what beautiful 
rosy light and a gentle warmth it fills a room, and how 
it laughs and dances and seems to say to every one "be 
glad with me !" 

And then, aside from its home-like beauty and good 
cheer, who can count, the depressing chills and miasma, 
and floating seeds of disease, that are seized by its friendly 
flames and whirled up the chimney before they have time 
to lay a finger upon us ? 

Next to the wide windows and the bath-room, dear 
house-keepers, be sure to insist upon the fire-place in 
your house plans ! 

An "imitated" fire-place appears like one of the cruel- 
lest of shams ; but if a real one cannot be afforded, a 
mantel is still a graceful and dignified feature of house-

finishing ; and an open stove selected from the several 
good and cheap ones now manufactured, will prove a very 
satisfactory substitute for the fire-place itself. 

The mantel need not be expensive. A plain strong 
shelf placed about four and a half feet from the floor, 
with three pieces of pine arranged beneath it, something 
like the accompanying cut, is about all that is required 
of the carpenter in cases where dollars and cents must be

considered. The finishing and decorative touches are all 
within the power of some painstaking wife or daughter. 

First nail a iiarrow molding along the edges, joining 
the comers neatly, and filling all nail holes with putty ; 
then paint the whole with good black paint, and when 
dry rub all over with emery paper or pumice-stone to 
remove any roughness, and apply another coat of paint. 
When dry, varnish. It can now be simply finished with 
a lambrequin for the shelf, and some sort of decorated 
fire-board, or it can be brightened up with tiles " in the 
following manner : 

Take panels, or squares, of glass, and if one is not 
artist enough to venture on original designs, select pleas- 
ing pictures of birds, flowers, grains, children, animals. 



FIKISHING. 39 

or season-landscapes, from the great chromo-field, cut 
them out nicely and gum them upon the glass face down- 
ward, covering the whole with a coat of paint in soft 
shades of blue, lavender, or sea-green. The '' right " side 
of the glass then bears a very fair resemblance to a china 
painting. These tiles are easily and inexpensively made, 
and when fastened upon the wood-work, with narrow black 
moldings, have almost as good an effect as those costlier 
ones ** from over the sea." 

For a tire-board take paper that will not quarrel with 
the prevailing color of the room, and paste it smoothly 
into the space between the wood-work and the mantel. 
This may be varnished and left plain, or a group of ferns, 
a wreath of autumn leaves, or a spray of * ' decalcomania " 
flowers may first be applied and then covered with two 
coats of varnish. If neatly and tastefully done this will 
agreeably brighten up an otherwise plain mantel. 

If one is so fortunate as to possess a long narrow mir- 
ror, of the sort that, with a green halo of asparagus bouglis 
about them, used to adorn our grandmothers' best rooms, 
it can be placed lengthways upon this mantel, neither 
tipped backward nor forward^ but fastened flatly to the 
wall, and the effect will be excellent. The frame, doubt- 
less more or less tarnished, will require a rubbing with 
sand-paper and a coat of black paint and varnish like 
the mantel ; or it maybe necessary to reframe it in black 
molding of a width to make it as long as the shelf on 
which it rests. If one has no such mirror, it will not 
cost a great sum to purchase one, without frame, and fit 
it into place. It will reflect the sunlit windows by day, 
and the lamps by night, and greatly increase the beauty 
and cheerfulness of the apartment. 

HALL WINDOWS. 

If there are glass panels in the hall-door, or windows 
above or beside it, there are ways for making them orna-

mental as well as necessary. They should not only be 
pleasing to outside inspection, but have a pretty and 
cheery look from within. By taking sheets of white 
tissue paper of the size of the panes, cutting out some 
flowery or geometrical design in the center, and pasting 
smoothly upon the glass, you have something of the effect 
of ground glass. Another way is to cut leaves and blos- 
soms, birds and butterflies, from gay furniture calico or 
cretonne, paste them on the glass — the right side toward 
the light — in wreaths or groups, and cover them with 
white net, tarleton, or thin book-muslin cut to exactly fit 
the panes. 

Autumn leaves, vines, and ferns, could be used in place 
of the cretonne figures if not exposed to strong sun-light 
— which would soon bleach them to anything but an 
attractive "living green." 

Any window from which the outlook is not desirable, 
but from which light is wanted, may be decorated in this 
way and so become a pleasing object in itself.

CHAPTER in. 

What woman, unless she is a Laplander, or wealthy 
fenough to know no wish denied, but has her daj-dreams 
in which she furnishes this or that room after her own 
heart, and makes her house so beautiful — to her own 
mind at least — that waking from her dream-work she 
sighs over the limitations of her purse, and looks wearily 
about upon the plain, perhaps shabby things that must 
*' do " until that indefinite period. Better Times, can re- 
place them with something more desirable. 

Now, for the benefit of these unsatisfied home-mothers, 
ingenious thinkers — women who have time to think — have 
hit upon many tasteful, cozy, and yet inexpensive ways 
for making rooms to appear very well furnished ; so that 
even without the upholsterer's aid, or the stockingful of 
money so vainly waited for, their apt sisters have only to 
set to work at once and have surroundings more to their 
liking. 

It is not worth while to sigh any longer for the marble- 
topped tables, flaming carpets, and slippery hair-cloth 
chairs which neighbor Luckyhand has had so long in his 
parlor, for they are ''out of fashion," and you should 
beware that no desperate local dealer induces you to take 
similar goods "at cost," that he may be rid of them. 
With the small-patterned and small-priced ingrain car- 
pets now in market, and plenty of good and cheap pic- 
tures offered on every hand, it will be found that a few 
yards of pretty chintz, a little furniture-gimp, and maybe 
a little paint and varnish, will go farther in furnishing a 
room tastefully and comfortably than a whole " set " from 
the upholsterer's — and cost, of course, a great many dol- 
lars less. 



43 FARM HOMES, IN-DOORS AND OUT-DOOES. 

The Spare Bedroom, the Boys' Koom, and even the 
Parlor — which maybe has long been a draw-back to happy 
existence because of its scanty and unlovely furniture, 
may all be made quite nice and cozy at such a small out- 
lay of money that it is not really wise to wait any longer 
for the more splendid things that may never come. 

Let us begin first with Bedrooms, for no matter how one 
may yearn to place every pretty thing where it will make 
the most display, an honest house-keeper will scrimp par- 
lor and dining-room before adorning them at the expense 
of sleeping-rooms — just as a genuine lady Avill have good 
and neatly made underclothing rather than outside silks 
and velvets, if her purse will not admit of both. 

THE SPARE BEDROOM. 

If one has good bedding and a pretty bedstead for this 
room, the expense of additional furnishing will be quite 
light. If these are lacking, then it is a more serious 
aifair. If furniture can be bought unpainted directly 
from the factory or shop where it is made, it can he had 
at comparatively low figures. Send to the manufactur- 
ers for a catalogue, if you are too far from them for a 
personal call, select something in pine or whitewood, and 
trust to your genius and the paint-pot for a respect- 
able bedstead, and some sort of small table for lamp, 
books, etc. 

First decide what the color or tone of the room shall 
be, and paint the furniture accordingly. If it is a north 
room, I suggest a delicate peach or a straw color ; if a 
south room, a soft blue, sage-green, or pale lilac. 

Suppose a light pink decided upon. Let the wood- 
work be painted with white paint, in which has been 
stirred enough vermilion powder to make a tint not 
deeper than that of a blush rose. A room having but 
one door and a window or two, presents so little wood 



FUENISHIN^G. 43 

surface that perhaps nice paint and an outer coat of var- 
nish can be afforded. 

For the walls select a light gray paper of a small flow- 
ery or geometric pattern, without color, with a border of 
pink roses and golden-gi'een leayes, or of any other 
pretty design in these colors. A cheap paper of modest 
pattern and neatly put on, has quite as good an appear- 
ance as the more expensive sorts, and there is less arsenic 
in its composition for poisoning the air. 

For the windows, plain bleached cotton shades, with a 
bordering of pink "chambrey" stitched on in bias 
bands, will look neatly. Or lambrequins may be made 
of the chambrey, with pinked ruffles about the edge and 
across the top. Fashiou journals generally send lambre- 
quin patterns for twenty or twenty-five cenfcs, and it is 
worth while to have a graceful pattern, if any. Beneath 
these lambrequins nothing can be prettier in the way of 
inexpensive fabrics than book-muslin, made to hang in 
ample folds, the bottoms of the curtains just clearing 
the floor, and finished with a wide hem. In place of 
book-muslin, plain bleached cotton cloth — the lighter in 
quality the better — can be used, with two bands of pink 
chambrey stitched across six inches from the bottom. 

For the floor there is nothing more cheerful or more 
serviceable, or freer from dnst, than straw matting. It 
is also cheap, compared with other carpetings. Direc- 
tions are given for making inexpensive carpets of wall- 
paper, but the process seems a tedious and not a very 
money-saving one. First, the floor must be covered with 
cotton cloth sewed together in breadths and tucked down 
very smoothly ; this is to be covered with a coating of 
glue or thick flour paste. Upon this is laid the wall-pa- 
per, and upon the wall-paper two coats of varnish, when 
the ''cheap" carpet is completed. In the long run, a 
good white matting would prove much less expensive, 
besides being more grateful both to vision and touch. 



44 FARM HOMES, IK-BOORS A^H OUT-DOOES. 

But if the latter is beyond the house-keeper's purse, she 
can give the floor a border of paint two shades darker 
than that of the gray wall-paper, and cover the center 
with a large rug of some home-made sort. Or the whole 
floor might be covered with the well-known '^rag" car- 
peting, if enough of pink and gray 4*ags could be evolved 
for such a fabric. Balls of pink, and balls of gray, 
loosely twisted together and woven with black warp, 
would make a neat, appropriate, and very durable carpet 
at a cost, including weaving, of less than twenty or 
twenty-five cents per yard. 

A pair of handsome and luxurious rugs can be made 
by lining two white lambs' pelts with suitable material 
and placing a pleating of pink merino or flannel under 
the edges. 

Pretty rugs, especially for summer use, are made of 
Turkish towelling (a soft, shaggy, cotton goods), lined 
with some heavier material and tied with tufts of pink 
zephyr or worsted. One yard of the yard-wide towelling 
makes two rugs. One should be placed before the toilet 
table and the other beside the 'bed. They are easily 
washed, and have a dainty and comfortable appearance 
in a sleeping room. 

A very important item is a good bed. If you cannot 
have a spring wire-mattress, a tick filled with soft, clean 
corn-husks is one of the best foundations for a bed. 
Over this, in summer, place a light mattress of cotton 
or wool. In winter very few will be found objecting to 
a soft, well-cared-for feather-bed, particularly when the 
thermometer indicates large figures below zero. Pillows 
about two feet long and eighteen inches wide are of good 
size, both for use and looks. If feathers are scarce, I 
have known quite delightful pillows made of '* new- 
mown hay," cut while the grass is young, with a hand- 
ful or two of sweet clover or vanilla grass to enhance its 
agreeable fragrance. 



FUR2!riSHING. 45 

It is a pleasing fasliion nowadays to have some color 
about a bed in place of plain white. Counterpanes of 
colored silk and satin are, of course, very elegant, but 
th^y would be out of place in the simple appointments 
of a farm-house bedroom. French dress cambric — a 
fine, glossy goods, costing about thirty cents a yard, and 
sold in all shades — rmakes very pretty counterpanes when 
thmly wadded and nicely quilted in diamonds with a 
sewing machine. In this room the color chosen should, 
of course, be pink, and the stitching should be done 
with precision. 

For pillow and sheet-shams select heavy bleached cot- 
ton cloth, and make up with a wide hem and cambric 
ri^ffles. The pillow-shams should be only the width of 
the ruffle larger than the pillows, and the sheet-sham 
wide enough to turn down two feet, or about one- third 
the length of the bed. The sheets and pillow-cases may 
have simply wide hems, as, if they are neatly made and 
white as snow, they are quite beautiful enough. They 
should be kept in a drawer with bags of rose-leaves, lav- 
ender, or the aromatic sweet briar, and not put on the 
bed until wanted, when they should be well aired to re- 
move even the faintest suspicion of dampness. Fra- 
grant snow-white *' bed-linen" is within the reach of 
almost the poorest housewife in the world, and makes 
the plainest bed an inviting couch. 

In the winter, that comfortable article, a foot-blanket, 
for wrapping up the feet on cold nights, can be made of 
two yards of white flannel, bound about the edges with 
pink cambric or ribbon. It should be folded and placed 
across the foot of the bed. 

A common dry-goods box of the right size, when pret- 
tily covered, makes a much more satisfactory toilet table 
than anything that can be had under five dollars at the 
furniture dealers. Select a box of a suitable hight, 
about three feet long and twenty-eight inches wide. 



46 FAEM HOMES, IN-DOORS AKD OUT-DOOKS. 

Let the open side come in front, to be lined witli paper 
and used as a receptacle for slop- jar, etc. Nail a strip of 
board, six inches wide and three feet long, to the top of 
the box next the wall. Buy a piece of plain white or 
marbled oilcloth, long enough to cover this, and the top of 
the box, and put it on neatly, bringing the edges low 
enough that no tacks will be displayed. Cover the ends 
of the box also with paper. Then line some coarse 
book-muslin with pink paper-cambric and drape it upon 
the box sufficiently full to hang gracefully. Make a nar- 
row plaiting or ruffling of muslin and place it around 
the top and down the opening in front, where the ends 
of the curtain or "valance" must overlap. The mirror, 
which should be at least two feet long — a larger one 
being, of course, all the better — must rest upon the oil- 
cloth-covered board that forms the back of the table, and 
have its frame covered with a ruching of the pink-lined 
muslin. At either side of the bottom of the mirror 
place small brackets, covered and draped with tiny lam- 
brequins of muslin and cambric. They can be made of 
cigar-boxes, or any light, thin 'wood, and will afford a 
place for small vases and cologne bottles. Then with 
pink and white mats for wash-bowl and pitcher, a pretty 
pin-cushion, and one or two boxes (for bi-ushes and 
combs), covered with cambric and muslin, this important 
item of furniture is completed. 

And now the husband or tho big boy of the household 
must make a lounge frame. No matter how roughly it 
is put together, if it is only reliably strong and stands 
squarely on its legs. It should be about twenty-eight 
inches wide, and not more than sixteeu inches high ; if 
higher it will lose its comfortable look, and have the ap- 
pearance of being on stilts by the time the mattress is 
added. Nail slats across tlie top, and make a mattress 
for it of fine hay or oat straw. Then buy some calico, or 
percale, or dress cambric in pink and white stripes, and 



FUEKISHIKG. 47 

make a cover and valance for the lounge, also covering a 
large square pillow to place at one end. Seven yards of 
cambric or percale will be sufficient, but if calico is used two 
or three yards more will be needed. If one is dependent 
on a small country store for supplies, it may be necessary 
to order by mail from the nearest city. No other cheap 
goods will look as well. 

Any old second-hand "light-stand," or similar article 
of furniture, can be transformed into a comely little ta- 
ble by giving it two coats of the rose-colored paint and a 
final one of varnish. Perhaps a handsome cluster of 
roses or lilies can be applied to the center. 

It will be thought that the purchase of chairs cannot 
be avoided ; but wonders can be done with the paint-pot 
and two old kitchen chairs, and perhaps the big boy just 
mentioned can make a frame for a large easy chair. He 
must be sure to have the seat broad and low, and the 
back at just the right angle. A little hay and four 
yards of percale and ingenious fingers will accomplish 
the rest, and, with a foot-stool, nothing more is needed 
in this line. 

By all means have a stove in this room, since even the 
warmest ■ hospitality can hardly counteract the chill at- 
tendant on going to bed in a fireless room in January ! 
To save the trouble of storing it in summer, it might be 
allowed to remain in the room the year round, decorated 
with evergreens and other cool foliage during those 
months when a fire is not needed. 

And now do not disfigure these pure walls with a lot 
of hap-hazard, meaningless pictures and fussy fancy 
work ! Bedroom walls, as well as others, should be se- 
rene. It is enough to have a pair of good engravings, or 
good chromos, and a " motto " that has some appropriate- 
ness about it — for instance, *'At Evening-time There 
Shall be Light," "Let Not Your Heart be Troubled,"

''Happy Dreams and a Glad To-morrow" — something 
calming and hopeful. 

Blue, sea-green, and lilac, combined with white or 
gray, are all beautiful colors for bedrooms, and with 
taste and ingenuity an inviting apartment can be made 
out of inexpensive materials. 

THE boys' room. 

The Boys' Room is often much neglected in the way 
of a little painstaking adornment, particularly in coun- 
try homes. I could never see clearly why all the pretty 
things should gravitate to the rooms occupied by the 
girls, while the boys' room goes almost as bare as the an- 
cient cupboard of Mother Hubbard. 

If the girls are to have a blue room, or a lilac room, let 
the boys also have a room distinguished by color. A 
housewife, without great outlay, can * individualize" all 
bedrooms in this way. If everything cannot be done at 
once, what is done can be in accordance with a special 
design. 

Let the boys have a room where the sunlight comes in, 
and let the walls be attractively tinted, and the floor 
nicely painted, with large, comfortable rugs before beds, 
toilet-stands, and bureaus ; and, out of regard for the 
masculine mmd's hatred of things that need constant re- 
placing, have these rugs securely tacked down ! 

Then there should be a good bed — or beds, if there are 
more than two boys — with plump pillows and counter- 
panes to match the color of the room. Common glazed 
cambric, thinly wadded and neatly quilted, looks very 
nicely, and if properly cared for will remain bright and 
unsoiled for years. 

A model house-keeper of my acquaintance has a large, 
airy room for her three boys which is very pleasant to 
look upon, and yet its appointments cost very little. 
The walls are covered with a bluish-gray paper, with a 



PUENISHIIfG. 49 

bright border of blue-flag blossoms and rich green leaves. 
The wood-work and the floor for a yard's width about the 
room was painted, by the oldest boy, a light lead color, at 
a cost of a dollar and a half. The center of the floor is 
covered with a large, square, braided rug of black and 
gray rags, with a square of blue in the middle, and there 
are smaller rugs of similar pattern before the bureau and 
the toilet-table. 

The two windows on opposite sides of the room are 
hung with graceful lambrequins of blue and gray calico 
that cost six cents a yard, being of extra quality ! 

A solid, oblong kitchen table, with neat lead-colored 
legs and a cover of gray linen, bordered with blue — 
which I mistrust is kept in place by the big Dictionary 
and a large book of birds — stands in the center of the 
room, and above it is suspended a hanging lamp, particu- 
larly bright and shining, although it is set in just a 
square of board with a wire running up from each cor- 
ner. A fleecy frilling of blue tissue paper conceals the 
board, and the plain little lamp becomes a pretty feature 
m the room. 

There are three "cot" beds at one end of the apart- 
ment. Each has a corn-husk mattress (with, in winter, 
another of wool), an oat-straw pillow, neat, plain shams, 
and a woven blue and white counterpane, like those of 
olden times. 

The somewhat elongated toilet-table — for it must ac- 
commodate three boys, who generally must dress at the 
same time — is made from a packing-box and neatly 
draped with the blue and gray print. Above it is a long 
mirror, placed lengthwise, and there are brush and comb 
boxes for each boy. , 

In one comer stands a large wardrobe for clothes, and 
opening from the room is a small closet, warmed in cold 
weather by a pipe from the winter-kitchen stove, and 
containing conveniences for washing and bathing.

The walls have two very good chromo landscapes, 
framed by the boys. A deer's head and an old Indian 
hatchet hang among the guns and fishing-tackle, that 
give a vigorous boyish tone to the room. Over the door 
is a lovely thing — to my eyes: a motto done with water- 
paints and by young hands, but it is easy enough to read 
the words "Remember Mother" among its gay leaves 
and blossoms. And in this home "mother" is remem- 
bered, and she has always remembered her boys. 

It does not follow that every farm-house mother must 
have a large room with a blue-counterpaned bed for each 
boy, although I would strongly recommend the arrange- 
ment, with a variation of color ! " Individual " beds are 
not only more conducive to health, but in this case they 
do away with a great deal of the characteristic pinching 
and squabbling of nocturnal boyhood ! They make a 
little more washing, to be sure, but the sheets a;re small 
and easily laundried. 

I quote this room to show that it is not much more 
trouble to have things comfortable and harmonious than 
it is to have them the reverse. The three boys might 
have been pitched into this room — if I may be permitted 
the expression — with one bed, a broken lookmg-glass, a 
three-legged chair, and a shelf for a tin candle-stick, 
with their only chance for washing and bathing offered 
by the kitchen sink or the mill-pond. But I do not be- 
lieve they would have liked this room for a reading-place, 
or a studio, or been proud to invite their mates there, or 
that they would have worked so laboriously to create 
that blessed motto over the door. 

The chief beauty of any room, whether richly or 
plainly furnished, is its purity and orderliness ; and the 
Boys' Room needs daily attention to make it a place they 
will look back to in after years with the keenest and ten- 
derest memories. How many grown-up hearts there are 
who can say, with Ilood :

We will not believe that Hood really wished to die — • 
for there was nothing in his good life to make him tired 
of earth — but he was tenderly in earnest when he recalled 
the scenes of his early days, even to the ** little window/' 
through which the sun smiled him Good Morning, and 
the lilac-tree ''where the robin built." Youth is such a 
rose-tinted time that perhaps a bedroom window looking 
out upon a chaotic back-yard, and looking in upon a room 
with battered walls, a lumpy bed and a couple of weak- 
legged chairs, would be something sweetly remembered 
in after years ; but I am inclined to doubt it. A window, 
brushed by the boughs of a lilac, or an apple-tree, with 
its sweet blossoms and humming bees, and beyond it 
glimpses, of hill and valley and the radiant sky, is the 
window for the Boys' Room, and there should be pleasant 
little touches of beauty and comfort within that need 
cost hardly anything but motherly thoughtf ulness. 

If help is scarce in the house, and the mother's hands 
are full, it may not be out of place in this subject of 
''furnishing" the Boys' Eoom, to suggest here that the 
boys can assist in keeping it in order. They can make 
beds and sweep floors with the most admirable neatness 
and dispatch, because their arms are so strong and their 
feet are not impeded by the long skirts the poor mother 
is doomed to wear. If a boy is ashamed to be seen doing 
"girl's work," let him be more ashamed still of being an 
unmanly shirk, and letting his over-burdened mother 
do for him work that he has time and ability for doing 
himself. I know a boy, keen and bright enough to be a

future President, and plucky enough to win more wolf- 
bounty in his county last winter than any two men hunt- 
ers, who can put a room to rights, cook a beefsteak, and 
set the table for dinner, as quickly and daintily as any 
woman, without any apparent loss of self-respect, or the 
least bit of damage to his gritty young manhood. 

THE OLD people's ROOM. 

11 you are so fortunate as to have the ''Old People " in 
the house, see to it that they have its warmest and sun- 
niest corner, and a goodly portion of the best that can 
be afforded of comfort, convenience, and beauty — that 
aged blood may be kept warm and cheerful, that failing 
limbs may have restful repose, and that the dim eyes 
that have watched over you and yours through so many 
toilsome years, may see around them the ever present 
evidences of faithful and grateful care. 

There is nothing in the world more pathetic than the 
meek, timorous, shrinking ways of certain old people — 
we have all seen them — who have given up their old home 
into younger hands and subsided into some out-of-the- 
way corner of it, to sit by fireside and at table henceforth 
as if they were mere pensioners — afraid of ''making 
trouble," afraid of being "in the way," afraid of accept- 
ing the half that is their due, and going down to their 
graves with a pitiful, deprecating air, as if constantly 
apologizing for staying so long ! 

There is no scorn too deep and sharp for the sons and 
daughters who will accept this attitude on the part of 
those to whom they owe so much I 

Sometimes, to be sure, people grow old with a bad grace. 
They become embittered by misfortune, or affliction, or 
are peevish and unreasonable under the goadings of ill- 
health. All the more do they appeal to great gentleness 
and faithfulness. Let it be borne in mind that we, too, are 
hastening on toward the sunset of life, and that it is pos- 



FURNISHING. 53 

sible we may ripen ioto very uncomfortable old people, to 
demand much more of patience and devotion than we as 
children yield. 

The Old People's room should be as pleasant and 
homelike as possible. Let the old-fiishioned furniture 
and the old-fashioned ways prevail in it. I think no one 
thing could delight the old hearts more than an open 
fire-place, with some ancient andirons, and a crane with 
its pendant tea-kettle ! These fire-places are rapidly 
becoming extinct, but to most old people living in the 
present generation they would be radiant with pictures of 
youth and early love. A fire like this is not only a de- 
light to the aged, but a pleasant care. How the old 
mother, who was such a thrifty housewife in her " day," 
enjoys polishing the brass heads of the fire-dogs, brush- 
ing the tidy hearth, and brewing the special cup of tea 
in the little old pot that looks so entirely **at home" 
upon the glowing coals ! And with what solicitude does 
grandfather prepare the wood and kindlings for this be- 
loved hearth-fire ! How he enjoys stretching his aged 
hands to the ruddy blaze, while he croons some quaint 
old hymn in concord with the singing kettle ! What a 
vast amount of poking and reconstructing the sticks 
require, and how important it is that when the early, old- 
fashioned bedtime comes, there must be just the right sort 
of coals for the morning fiie ! Think of giving the Old 
People a grim looking, air-tight stove that swallows a huge 
chunk in the morning, and then, like an anaconda, re- 
quires nothing more until its big lunch is digested I 
Provide the stove, if the severity of climate demands it, 
but have the open fire for love's sake ! Aside from the 
good cheer and the companionship which it offers, it 
swallows up the dust, assists to ventilate the room, and 
adds so much to the physical well-being of the occupants 
that it should be instituted for this reason alone — if its 
poetical side seems of little value. 



54 FARM HOMES, IN-DOORS AND OUT-DOORS. 

It is essential that the Old People should have their own 
rooms, where their quiet and retirement can be held 
sacred. If there are but two rooms in the house, the 
grandfather and grandmother are entitled to one of 
them. The confusion of a "blue Monday," or the noisy 
overflow of animal spirits in children, may be very invig- 
orating to younger nerves, but it is not always agreeable 
to the aged, who need a haven of peace and repose suited 
to the Indian Summertime of their lives. In this quiet 
comer let them gather about them the old and familiar 
treasures with which they began the world together — but 
be careful to add enough of "modern improvements" to 
insure their comfort and convenience. The old clock, 
the towering chest, the battered china, tlie dim oil- 
portraits, and even the "weeping-willow" lithographs — 
pathetic with the memory of the early lost — will seem 
like old and faithful friends to them ; but let the old- 
fashioned draught under the door be shut out with a 
patent weather-strip, and the dim candles of the past be 
replaced by a cheerful lamp. A monthly rose and a 
chrysanthemum in one of the sunny windows will be 
another pleasant charge for grandmother, and a good 
book or a fresh newspaper should often find its way to 
the mantel beside grandfather's "spectacles." 

It is well worth while to deny one's self many things 
rather than this room should be bleak and cheerless to 
these fading lives. All too soon will the fire go out on 
the hearth, and the old arm-chairs stand empty. It will be 
well for us then if no ghosts of reproach, no sad phantoms 
of lost opportunity, lean out of the chill and the silence to 
remind us of our deep sins of neglect and indifference ! 
After all, the "good will" goes farther than the great 
deeds. The scant furniture, the plain dinner, and the 
last year's almanac for reading, will all be very pleasant 
and grateful to the Old People, if faithful love and cheer- 
ful devotion sweeten the atmosphere ; and in a thousand

inexpensive ways can frugal living be tempered and 
softened to their needs. 

mother's room. 

Every good home must have its " Mother's Eoom " — • 
the pleasant half nursery, half sitting-room, that enfolds 
all the family in its affectionate atmosphere, and leads 
each member to feel that here at least is a bit of anchor- 
age ground from every storm that blows. 

In this room, also, let us all insist on sunlight and an 
open fire — things that go farther in furnishing an apart- 
ment than anything that can be found in the shops. 
Open stoves of different sizes and designs can be had at 
moderate cost. Some are designed to close into an air- 
tight stove, whenever it is desired to " keep " the fire, 
but these are more expensive than the ordinary open 
grates, like the "Franklin." 

There should be a lighted closet or small room opening 
from this apartment, containing a wardrobe and the con- 
veniences for bathing and dressing. This is very essen- 
tial — even in a primitively arranged farm-home — for 
sponges, towels, brushes, slippers, and the like, have 
rather more of prose than poetry in them, and no room 
can be properly used as a sitting-room where such very 
personal property manifest's itself. Banish these things 
to their legitimate place ; but if the house is small, and 
sleeping-space limited, a bed can remain in the room, and 
if neatly made up, will add to rather than detract from 
its air of cozy comfort. 

Since . there must bo a few healthy, blossoming plants 
in the east or south windows, and since dust is their 
natural enemy, it will be best to give the floor a three-foot 
border of paint or stain, and cover the center with a 
square of carpeting, which can frequently be taken up 
and cleaned with little time and labor. 



66 FARM HOMES, IN-DOORS AND OUT-DOOES. 

If the windows have shutters for closing at night, they 
require very little drapery. Plain white shades, with a 
border matching the color used in furnishing the room, 
will look well, and in winter small, cornice-like lambre- 
quins of a warm, bright tint might be added. Pale, sun- 
shiny buff, with a touch of scarlet here and there — in 
borders, lambrequins, cushions, and the like — will give a 
bright and cheerful tone to this room, so that, even in 
stormy weather, it will have about it hints of fair skies. 
In ceiling and walls this tint is cheaply obtained in calci- 
mine. The wood-work, if of clear pine, can be varnished 
without paint. If old and time-scarred, it had best be 
stained walnut-color, or oiled and varnished. The large 
square of carpet should be in a small leafy and mossy pat- 
tern, of dark and light brown, with a brown and scarlet 
border. Twelve yards, three breadths four yards long, 
will make an ample "rug" for a room twelve by fifteen 
feet, or even larger. 

If there are some household purses that cannot afford 
even these twelve yards, let no one be heart-broken ! I 
have known more than one charming, home-like room 
whose only carpet was of woven rags, or a glossy coat of 
"ppruce yellow," with a braided rug before its pleasant 
hearth. 

Eag-carpeting, in the manufacture of which the whole 
family might join one or two evenings in each week, can 
be made so as to be quite tasteful, as well as substantial, 
and should be preferred to the cheap, easily worn and 
easily faded hemp and cotton -ingrain carpeting. For in- 
stance, if a carpet for this buff and scarlet room is lack- 
ing, color all the old white rags and white-ground cali- 
coes a deep orange, sew them in balls by themselves, and 
then twist them with balls made of all colors, except red, 
which must be saved for the bordering. The twisting 
can be accomplished by winding a ball of each into one 
ball. Ten balls of orange, estimated at a pound each, 



FURNISHING. 67 

and ten balls of ''hit or miss" colors of the same weight, 
will make at least fifteen yards of carpeting. After the 
breadths are sewn together, and the ends hemmed, braid 
together all the old red flannel and black WQolen rags 
and sew them around the edge for a border. The result 
will be quite a neat and stylish floor-covering, of which 
no housewife need be ashamed, and costing much less 
time and labor than those dazzling rag-carpets in which 
"shaded" colors and ** feather-stripes" abound. 

Mother's Room must have a lounge — a lounge long 
enough and wide enough and soft enough for an after- 
dinner nap, and pretty enough to,, be ornamental, as well 
as of use. Like that in the spare room, the frame can 
be made at home and covered with any kind of material 
that will harmonize with the room. Take care to have 
the frame broad and low. Flowered buff and scarlet 
furniture calico, such as might be used for the lambre- 
quins, or plain dark red, will make a pretty cover. Af- 
ter the frame is covered with stout sacking, securely 
nailed m place so as not to sag, tack on a valance of the 
chintz or calico, and make a mattress of the same, filling 
it with split corn-husks or nice straw, and tying it in 
large diamonds, using tufts of scarlet yarn for buttons. 
Around the edge of the mattress place a ruffle or box- 
plaiting that will fall over the top of the valance. Then 
make two good, generous cushions of either feathers or 
oat-straw, cover them with the material, sew a ruffle or 
plaiting about the edges, and the lounge is complete, ex- 
cept for a gaily striped afghan, or small, prettily pieced 
quilt, which should be folded and laid at the foot, as a 
convenience for covering the shoulders during a nap or 
when one is resting from fatigue. 

A very comfortable easy chair can be fitted up by mak- 
ing a soft, thick cushion five feet long and eighteen 
inches wide, covering it with the lounge material, tying 
it also with tufts of yarn, and fastening it to the back 



58 FARM HOMES, IN-DOORS AND OUT-DOORS. 

and seat of some old-fashioned wooden rocker, previously 
renewed with paint and varnish. 

A low sewing chair (a kitchen chair with legs sawed off 
two inches) should be cushioned in the same way, and 
two soap boxes — one to contain rolls of sewing or mend- 
ing, and the other the baby's playthings — can be cush- 
ioned so as to be comfortable little seats, and covered 
with the same goods. 

There should be a substantial table for the center of 
the room — one on which children can lean over lessons 
or picture-books without fear of upsetting the structure. 
If one is not so fortunate as to possess some great-grand- 
mother's mahogony or cherry-wood table, have a carpen- 
ter make one of pine, about three by four feet, with 
rounded corners and turned legs, and finish it at home with 
walnut-stain and varnish. Two yards of double-width 
dark-scarlet flannel, hemmed all around with machine 
stitching m silk, will make an elegant spread, or the ta- 
ble is very well without any covering, particularly for 
children's use or for evening games. 

Above this table should be suspended a shaded lamp, 
to come down to a good reading or sewing level. It will 
impart a wonderfully pleasant and refined air to the 
room, give the best light, and be far safer than one that 
stands on the table. 

There should be a paneled bedstead, either in real or 
imitation walnut, and its furnishing should be always 
neat and fresh m appearance. Farm-mothers should 
fight against the tendency, amid their many cares, to 
neglect their own personal belongings, and to think that 
they have no time for refined comforts. Smooth, white 
shams, phimp pillows, pretty counterpanes, and laven- 
der-scented sheets, are just as becoming to Mother's 
Room as to that of the occasional guest; and no more 
time is required to make up such a bed than one where 
everything is limp and disorderly. 



FURNISHIKTG. 59 

Plain "Turkey-red" calico, or pale-buff cambric, or 
''chambrey" gingham, wadded and quilted, will make 
a suitable counterpane, and hems and ruffles will be 
sufficient finish for the shams, unless some neat-handed 
daughter is ready to put the mother's initials in the cen- 
ter with scarlet or buff embroidery cotton. 

Regarding these shams, a farmer's wife once declared 
to me that she would have no ''shams" in her house; 
that their very name was offensive, and that when her 
sheets and pillows were in such condition as to need 
hidmg, she could throw them into the wash and pro- 
vide clean ones. 

Now, this is a bit of virtuous indignation altogether 
out of place. Where a bed is used every day the pillow- 
slips and the sheet that should turn down smoothly 
across the top, become, after the first using, not soiled, 
but rumpled, and covering them with smooth, crispy, 
ruffled *' shams" that can be removed at night and kept 
immaculate for many weeks, is merely a praiseworthy at- 
tempt to make even the commonest things pleasing to 
the eye. 

And now, with a small clock for the mantel-shelf, 
which should be placed no higher than your shoulder, a 
pleasant picture or two hung so as to be level with the 
eye when one is standing, a wall-basket for newspapers, 
and a rack for the children's and other books, the 
Mother's Room is ready for occupancy. 

THE girls' room. 

Most young girls take so instinctively to refining and 
beautifying their surroundings, that it seems almost su- 
perfluous to offer them any suggestions. A writer in one 
of our home journals speaks of a country girl of sixteen 
who, with nothing but her ingenious fingers and twenty 
yards of five-cent calico, made of her bedroom " a per- 
fect bower of daintiness and purity." 



60 FAEM HOMES, II^-DOORS AND OUT-DOORS. 

Neatness and order are qualities to be had under any 
circumstances. Without them the choicest furniture 
cannot make an attractive room, and with them even the 
*'loft" in a log cabin can be made cosy and comfortable. 

Let us begin v/ith the humblest country home and see 
what things can be done with a little money. Suppose 
the wood-work unpainted, the plaster rough or broken, 
the floor bare, the chairs and bedstead old and ricketty, 
and the windows hung with rattling paper shades ? This 
seems a dreary enough groundwork for any reasonable 
reformer. Let us commence with the walls and ceiling. 
If there are any broken places and the " men-folks " are 
too busy to attend to such repairs, a few cents' worth of 
plaster of Paris mixed with water and applied in haste, 
for it hardens instantly, will neatly mend the holes. Or 
the cracks in the lath can be filled with paper and then 
stout, white cloth smoothly pasted over. Then mix a 
whitewash, coloring . it delicately with either Prussian 
blue, or vermilion, or yellow ochre, according to 
whether a blue, pink, or straw-color is desired, and do 
the ceiling, being sure to apply the last coat all in one 
direction with smooth, even strokes. Then add a little 
more of the coloring powder to make a deeper tint for 
the walls, and apply it until all stains or fractures no 
longer show. Stain the wood-work with burnt umber 
and hot vinegar after directions in the chapter on Fin- 
ishing. These dry powders or paints are generally sold 
m drug stores, and are not expensive. They can be or- 
dered by mail if need be. 

For the windows, perhaps the skirt of some old-fashioned 
lawn or cambric dress can be fashioned into graceful 1am- 
brequms. Or a cheap calico, with a white ground and a 
pink or blue or buff flower or stripe, can be used for the 
purpose. Under these lambrequins place either plain 
curtains of bleached cotton to be rolled up on sticks, or 
long full ones of coarse book-muslin, if it can be afforded. 



FUB:srisHiNa. • 61 

to be looped back at either side, and held in place by bows 
of ribbon, or. bunches of pressed leaves. 

Now arises the momentous question of a floor covering. 
Straw-matting is desirable, but it costs half a dollar, and 
more, a yard. Rag-carpeting would be neat, if made in 
blue or pink, or bulf, mingled Avith gray ; but it requires 
a good deal of time, a good deal of material, and there 
may be no weaver witlim fifty miles. The cheaj^est of 
*' ingrain " is forty or fifty cents per yard, and fades easi- 
ly, and is generally in ugly patterns. If the floor is 
smooth and close-jointed, and there is not much money 
to spend, I would send to some house-furnishing firm in 
the nearest city for a roll of wall-paper in a dark, rich 
*'tile" pattern, which might cost, includmg postage, 
fifty or sixty cents. This I would paste smoothly around 
the floor next the walls as a border, taking pains to make 
neat joints in the corners, and when dry apply a coat of 
good varnish. Over the remainder of the floor tack 
down a carpet made of heavy unbleached cotton cloth, 
sewed in neat straight seams that will not draw or pucker, 
and bound all about the edges with a braid or cloth of a 
color to match that chosen for the room. Until seen on 
the floor no one can imagine how pretty and cheerful and 
thoroughly neat such a car2)et appears. With care it can 
be used a whole summer without showing much soil, and 
when washed and tacked down again, is just as good as 
new. There should be gay little rugs of Turkish towel- 
ling or braided rags to place before bedstead and toilet 
table. 

If the bedstead is some old dingy, creaking thing that 
•would spoil all these efforts, let it be used for kindling 
wood ; or what is better, let the father or the big brother 
make from it a stout frame three feet wide by five and a 
half in length, w^ith slats nailed across the top, and not 
more than sixteen inches in hight. Drape around it a 
white valance, and make for it a thick mattress of split

com-husks or nice oat straw. Over this a thick com- 
forter of cotton or wool. No matter how coarse and plain 
the sheets and pillow slips, if they are only beautifully 
white. And the pillows must be round and plump, 
though filled with nothing more costly than fine soft hay. 
The counterpane may be of white, with rounded corners 
at the foot — else it will not hang gracefully on such a 
bedstead. It and the shams may be trimmed with bias 
bands of blue or pmk, or left plain white, as one chooses. 
Something will be added to the prettiness of this couch 
if a few yards of book-muslin, or of the lambrequin ma- 
terial, be fastened to an ornamental hook in the wall high 
above the head of the bed, and the ends made to fall 
gracefully at either side of it. 

For a cheap toilet table, and one easily made, secure a 
large three-cornered piece of board — large enough to 
comfortably accommodate a wash bowl, pitcher, boxes, etc. 
— and fasten it into a comer of the room where the light 
is best. Cover it with suitably colored cambric, and tack 
around it a slightly full flounce of the same, long enough 
to reach the floor. Over this place plain book-muslin, 
with box plaitmgs across the edge and along the bottom. 
The frame of the mirror hanging above it should also be 
draped with cambric and muslin, together with a little 
bracket at either side. Common paper boxes covered 
with fancy paper or zephyr-work should be added, for 
holding brushes, combs, etc. 

A long packing box of the right height, lined with 
paper, the cover hinged, and the whole neatly cushioned 
and draped with tastefully chosen calico, will make not 
only a pretty lounge, but an excellent place for keeping 
one's best dresses. 

If one has no bureau, another box, not so long, might 
be fixed in the same way, with partitions added, making 
" a place for everything." 

Saw off two or three inches from the le^^s of some old

kitchen chair, paint it jet black, and varnish; make a 
cushion for the seat and a square zeph3rr-tidy for the back, 
both of appropriate color, and a neat little sewing-chair 
IS the result. 

Trusting to the fates and girlish energy, for a table 
with a shelf of books above it, and some pretty pictures 
and a motto for the walls, we will leave this room, feeling 
sure that even with these humble and inexpensive appli- 
ances, there is the chance for peaceful and pleasant hours 
within that are sometimes unknown m more magnificent 
apartments. 

In homes where daughters have larger means to draw 
from, of course there will be no need of the make-shifts 
here mentioned. Delicately-toned paper can be chosen 
lor the walls, pretty chintzes or cretonnes for the furni- 
ture, and a neat, white matting or lovely ingrain for the 
floor. But whatever the fittings of a girl's room may be, 
it is the girl herself that gives it character. If she is re- 
fined and orderly, and tasteful, her room will certainly be 
an attractive little bower, whether she has five dollars or 
fifty times five to devote to its adornment. 

Two elements should never be forgotten, books and 
flowers ! They are the best and the sweetest companions. 

THE KITCHEN. 

One of the finest house-keepers in the United States 
says : ** If scrimping must be done, scrimp parlor and 
sitting-room, but have the kitchen and bedrooms as com- 
fortable as possible." Another writer observes: "The 
kitchen is to the house what the stomach is to the body, 
and should be the most spacious, best lighted, and best 
ventilated apartment in the house." This remark, how- 
ever, is aimed mainly at city homes, where the kitchen is 
too often a mere little basement cellar, badly lighted and 
illy supplied with pure air, from which it is no wonder 



64 FARM HOMES, liT-DOORS AND OUT-DOORS. 

that the servants are continually rising to the upper 
regions to give *^ warning." In the country the average 
kitchen is far more decent, but still the erring house- 
keeper, anxious to "have things like other people," is 
prone to pinch the poor kitchen in order to furnish the 
parlor its gim-cracks. 

This is all wrong. If one's house were intended for 
entertainment and continual festivity, then it would be 
well to place its parlor and dining-room first and fore- 
most ; but in a farm-house, where the house-mother's 
work lies mainly in kitchen and dairy, and where are 
needed all the aids and conveniences for making this 
work pleasant as well as profitable, it is simply silly to 
deny one's self valuable and useful every-day things for 
the sake of what-nots, upholstered chairs and Notting- 
ham-lace curtams, that must necessarily be shut up and 
of no benefit to anybody nine-tenths of the year. It is 
as if some farmer, otherwise of sound mmd, should 
deny himself reapers and seeders and good horses in order 
to keep himself well supplied with broadcloth, beaver 
hats, French boots, and fine linen I 

However, if the country house-keeper would visit one 
of the large retail hardware establishments in the nearest 
big city, with money in her pocket, I have no fear that 
she would have very much cash or inclination left for 
mere ** best room " adornments, for there is certainly no 
more captivating field offered to the eye of the home- 
woman than is found m this branch of house-furnishing. 
Before she has half surveyed the wonderful display of 
improvements in everything, from a magnificent cooking- 
range to a rotary nutmeg-grater, from an elegantly builded 
refrigerator to an apple-corer, from an oil-stove or a dish- 
washing machine to the last idea in clothes-lines and car- 
pet tacks — she will feel that ** hardware" is altogether 
too meagre a term to apply to such a world of beautiful 
and helpful things. 



FURKISHII^-G. 65 

I wish sucli articles could find their way into every 
farm-house in the land, in place of the showy and useless 
rubbish that is £0 often toiled and struggled for at the 
expense of health and household happiness. A parlor 
appropriately furnished is always desirable ; but a kitchen 
supplied with some modern conveniences and labor- 
saving implements, and so cheerfully arranged that to do 
work in it is a delight ratiier than drudgery, is of infinite 
more value, if a choice must fall between the two. 

The room should bo of good size, with windows on 
opposite sides, as they thus give a peculiarly cheerful 
light. It is a charming idea to have the windows set in 
after the manner alluded to in the Chapter on Building. 
They afford a generous view, and with sills about ton 
inches wide for fiowcr-pots, and a cornice across the top 
for a little drapery, they arc very delightful. The ceil- 
ing and walls should be whitened or calcimined in some 
cheerful tint, and the wood-work oiled and varnished. 
For the floor — if it is even, and of a decent quality of 
lumber — nothing is better than two or three coats of oil, 
put on one after the other as fast as absorbed. Such a 
floor needs no scrubbing, a weekly mopping with plenty 
of warmish water, being sufficient to keep it clean. Com- 
fortable little rugs should be placed before the sink, and 
the ironing table ; and if this room must do duty as a 
dining-room, there should be, in winter, a large square 
of carpeting under the dining-table. A neat screen, 
made by tacking chintz or furniture calico upon a light 
wooden frame, about five feet high and six feet wide, might 
be placed between the table and the cook-stove, not only 
to temper the heat, but to shut off the not always attrac- 
tive view of saucepans, spiders, and kettles used in the 
dinner-getting. 

The sink should be capacious, lined with zinc, provided 
with drain-pipe, and flanked by pumps connecting with 
cistern and well. Underneath may be a cupboard for pots 



66 FABM HOMES, IN-DOOKS AN^D OUT-DOORS. 

and kettles, and above it a row of pegs on whieli to hang 
a dishcloth -holder, a stiff brush for cleaning vegetables, 
a little mop for washing bottles and narrow-necked pitch- 
ers and jars, the lamp scissors, and such small articles 
as are in daily use in this department of the kitchen. 
Two small shelves should be placed at either end for soap- 
dishes. A large conveniently arranged sink goes a great 
way in making kitchen- work easy. 

A good-sized, substantial table of white- wood or pine 
is needed for ironing and baking days. It should have three 
drawers — a large one for ironing-sheets, shirt-board and 
holders, and two smaller ones for baking-tins, spoons and 
knives used in cooking, and boxes of spices, salt, etc. 
Having once used such a table, no house-keeper will like 
to do without it. 

Above this table can be fastened a hanging rack for 
ironed clothes. These are much more convenient than 
the sort which stand on the floor, and when not in use, 
can be folded back against the wall, entirely out of the 
way. 

For washing-days, are needed a long bench two and a 
half feet wide, and of the right hight, two or three tubs, 
a wringer, and for heavy clothes, a washer. The latter, 
which costs $5 or 16, can be fitted into any tub, and ought 
to be an indispensable article. It is to washing-day what 
a reaping-machine is to an eighty-acre wheat field ; and 
no farmer should neglect to provide one for his kitchen, 
unless he is willing to settle down to his harvesting with 
merely the sickle and the ** cradle" of his forefathers 1 
These items come under the head of ki;:chen furniture, 
but are, of course, kept in the cellar, or in a closet open- 
ing from the kitchen. 

Along with a first-class cooking-stove, for it is not 
economy to have a poor one, should be selected the fol- 
lowing quite necessary articles : — Wash-boiler, tea-kettle, 
soup-pot, frying-kettle, spider, two or three granitized 



FURKISHIl^TG. 67 

saucepans of different sizes, four bread-tins, two gem- 
irons, coffee and tea-pots, large and small iron spoons, 
wire steak-broiler, wire toaster, steamer, pudding-mold, 
patty-pans, potato- masher, skimmer, cream- whipper, 
gravy-strainer, egg-beater, half a dozen cake and pie tin?, 
large and small graters, a dozen muffin-rings, or a muffin- 
pan, which is more convenient than the rings, a colander, 
a quart measure, and a griddle. No doubt other items 
will readily suggest themselves, but these, at any rate, 
are essential, if good house-keeping is the object. A 
proper and convenient place to keep them is a large deep- 
shelved cupboard with close doors, in which the common 
crockery and glass can also be kept. 

The best arrangement is to have cupboard-room for all 
table and cooking ware, and keep food and provision 
stores in a cool, well ventilated closet, that can be effect- 
ually closed to dust and flies. 

For china and glass, and ornamental dishes, a corner 
cupboard with glass doors, in the uppe.- part, and two or 
three drawers below for table-cloths, napkins, and the 
children's bibs and clean aprons, will be found a treasure. 

There should be a closet opening from the kitchen for 
every- day coats, hats, umbrellas, water-proof cloaks, and 
the like. Nothing makes a kitchen look so forlorn and 
disorderly as a lot of nondescript garments hanging here 
and there about the walls, together with bits of rope, 
whips, and other masculine clutter. There's a place for 
these things, but it is not on the walls of a pleasant and 
tidy kitchen. The closet just mentioned should be capa- 
ble of ventilation, else overshoes and water-proofs will 
give it a too pronounced atmosphere. 

An easy little rocking-chair, and a good arm-chair, 
should be stationed by the pleasant windows, where a 
tired baby can be '* brooded " for a while, or a newspaper 
caught up for a moment's reading. 

Notwithstanding the scorn that is heaped upon

" chromes " by those who can afford to buy real oil-paint- 
ings and choice engravings, there are far prettier and 
more pleasing pictures among them than among many 
of the ''old masters," and any city acquaintance or re- 
liable dealer can send to our country homes soft-toned 
landscapes, and rich fruit and flower pieces, at a small 
expense, that will })leasantly relieve hsire walls, and often 
give really beautiful effects. There are very good en- 
gravings, too, that are not costly ; and there is no reason 
why even a kitchen wall should be without a beautiful 
face, a fair landscape, or a group of flowers glowing with 
the color of life. 

Let the farmer provide a large pleasant kitchen and 
interest himself in its conveniences for work — being as 
enthusiastic in furnishing labor-saving machines for this 
department of farming as for his outside fields — and ho 
will find that he makes an investment that pays an 
hundred fold. 

Let the farmer's wife make the kitchen a bright and 
sweet-aired realm, and be proud to be its intelligent and 
efficient queen. Let her beautify her work as much as 
possible, and lift it above the dull, discouraging slough 
of drudgery. With conveniences for work, and a cheer- 
ful, comfortable place to work in, the women are few who 
will not make their homes *' the dearest spot on earth " 
to all who dwell within them. 

THE DININQ-ROOM. 

Although there are many country kitchens so shining 
and orderly and clean-aired that it is a pleasure to break 
bread in them, there are many others which, owing to a 
large family and a pressure of work, cannot always be 
nice and orderly at meal times ; so it is well, if it can bo 
afforded, to have a small cheerful room opening from the 
kitchen, easily warmed in winter, and from which heat 



FURIs^ISHING. 69 

and flies can be excluded in summer, where meals can be 
eaten in the healthful serenity and comfort which is al- 
most as essential as the food itself. What can be more 
refreshing to the laborer than to enter from the blister- 
ing glare of a harvest day into a cool, softly-lighted room 
in which the fragrance of freshly gathered flowers, or the 
aroma of leafy boughs, mingles its poetry with the cheer- 
ful prose of the beef and vegetables ? And how pleasant 
and restful it is for his helpmate to lay aside her kitchen 
cares and kitchen-apron together, and come smiling and 
tidy to her little throne behind the tea-service. 

Such a room requires very little furniture. The walls 
should be of neat and quiet tint, with two or three pleas- 
ing pictures and sgme brackets for pots of ferns, or such 
vines as will grow prettily in the shade during the hot 
summer weather. In winter a few petunias and two or 
three foliage plants will fill the sunny windows with 
brightness and bloom. There should be a long, sub- 
stantial table, with plenty of elbow room for all, and a 
side-board or cupboard for table crockery. A small table 
will be found a convenience — ^if there is no side-board — 
for holding such dishes as are'uscd toward the end of a 
meal at dinner time, when the varieties of food have a 
tendency to crowd each other. .The window curtains 
may be plain shades of color suited to the walls of the 
room. Nothing can be better for the floor in summer 
time than an oiled surface, like that of the kitchen, 
which can be made comfortable to the feet in winter 
by a large ** crumb-cloth " of drugget or home-made 
carpeting. 

In more opulent farm-homes where the wife has liberty 
to devote more time and means to house decoration and 
furnishing, very handsome dining-rooms can be achieved 
with a moderate outlay. There should be high walls, a 
fire-place, and a fine large window looking to the south or 
east. All the rest is in the hands of the mistress. If

the floor has been laid in light and dark woods, well and 
good. It will be a thing of beauty through more than 
one life time, and always look genuine and substantial, 
as everything about a dining-room should. If, however, 
the floor is of pine, it may be stained in blocks or stripes 
in a bordering two feet in width, covered with two coats 
of best varnish, and the center adorned with three or 
more breadths of pretty carpeting. 

Supposing green and oak to have been chosen for the 
colors of this room — the ceiling calcimined with pale 
sage-green, and the wood-work either treated with oak- 
graining or oiled and varnished without paint : Select 
for the walls a flat-figared paper in oak and green tints, 
and place around the top a wide bordar or frieze in black 
and green and oak, with perhaps a touch of rich maroon. 
The carpet should be of small figure in green and oak, 
with a border of maroon. The window lambrequins 
should be of green rep with green and oak gimp and 
fringe, or of black-ground chintz with a gold and greea 
foliage pattern. A few neatly potted and luxuriant 
plants should be kept upon the sills, which can also be 
decorated with lambrequins if liked. 

Have a carpenter construct a side-board of simple but 
substantial form, faced with oak or maple, or else made 
of the best of pine. Glue artificial wood-carvings of 
fruits in the center of the top, and upon each door and 
drawer, and finish the whole with oil and varnish. 

The table may also be home-made and large and solid, 
with rounded comers and substantial turned lep^s "with 
casters. If not of real oak, the legs should be nicely 
grained to imitate it. If colored table linen is used it 
should be buff and white, with green borders, or buff and 
green in any neat, small patterns. Those cloths, how- 
ever, are generally covered with plain white ones at meal 
time. 

Above this table there should be a handsome hanging

lamp or small chandelier, with perhaps a little basket of 
Kennelworth Ivy, or other gracefully growing vine, sus- 
pended from it. Such a light glorilies the plainest tea- 
table. 

As for chairs there are a great many ways for achiev- 
ing handsome ones without paying five dollars apiece for 
them at furniture shops. If a dozen oak chairs without 
seats can be obtained *' in the rough " at the factory, they 
can be transformed into something pretty and substantial 
at small cost. They should first be oiled and varnished. 
Then with some stout sacking or canvas, some ricli, dark 
cretonne, some gimp and furniture tacks, and either hair 
or wool for stuffing, upholster the seats — bemg careful to 
fasten the canvas securely in place and to cut the cre- 
tonne to fit neatly. Even the cheap ** splint-bottoms" 
which cost much less than oak, can be made into hand- 
some chairs by painting the wood-work black, ornament- 
ing it with gilt and scarlet lines, and varnishing — the 
seats to be upholstered in cretonne, striped linen, or 
common chintz. 

For pictures, let us do away with the poor slaughtered 
innocents that have so long been selected for dmmg-room 
walls ! Why is a dead fish with its ghastly open mouth, . 
or a shot partridge hanging by one leg to a nail, consid- 
ered a pleasing object for contemplation while one is eat- 
ing ? '* Game Pieces " ought to be banished to the walls 
of butchers' shops ! In our dining-rooms let us rather 
have friendly portraits, children's faces, radiant flowers, 
and living birds and fishes. 

THE PARLOR. 

I place this room last because it is least in every genu- 
ine home — the home that is made to be used and enjoyed 
by the family. If means are small and best room furni- 
ture seems to be among the things never to be obtained. 



72 FARM HOMES, IN -DOORS AND OUT-DOORS. 

let not the whole house be made dismal because of it ; 
but rejoice that there is a kitchen, that there are com- 
fortable bedrooms, and that there is a bit of Heaven m 
the form of a flower garden under the windows ! 

I know a good woman, the wife of a hard-working and 
not very wealthy farmer, who ha:; spent years of her life 
toiling and scrimping and pinching herself and her 
family to the one end of having a handsome parlor and a 
handsome spare bedroom furnished after her own heai*t. 
She has them now — the bright Brussels carpet, the lace 
curtains, the upholstered chairs, the gilt-framed mirror, 
the glittering wall-paper, the richly bound Bible, the 
marble-topped table, the "pair" of mammoth heavily 
framed pictures, and m the bedroom the magnificent bed 
and all its appropriate surroundings. There is not even 
an embroidered sofa cushion, or fancy match safe, or 
gorgeous tidy, lacking. And over all this grandeur, for 
it is quite grand for that small farming hamlet, reigns 
profound shadow and silence. Sometimes on Sunday 
afternoon a gray-haired and rather unhappy-faced woman 
opens one of the shutters just enough to admit the ghost 
of a sunbeam and sits down by the window the solitary 
monarch of all the fine things about her. Her two boys 
have grown up and branched off into existence that has 
no "farming" in it. Her poor husband mightily pre- 
fers the kitchen or the back porch to the sacred splendors 
of the "front room," which he never enters without a 
mortal fear of doing some damage. So the parlor is her 
very own. It is too nice for the church sociable, and too 
large to throw open to "just the neighbors," and so it 
waits in shadow and silence like a very orderly sepulchre 
in which the good woman will one day lie in state, all 
unmindful of the neighbors' feet upon her sacred carpet. 
And this seems to be all that her Best Room amounts to. 

"Nevertheless, it is pleasant," exclaims some reader, 
" to have one room in the house that is always in order 



rUEKISHIN^G. 73 

and ready for visitors." So it is ! And after fitting up 
good bedrooms, comfortable and convenient kitchens, 
pleasant dming-rooms, and nice pantries and milk-rooms, 
parlors are the very next things to be considered in our 
farm-homes — unless some of the money devoted to them 
might better be used for books and magazines and news- 
papers, good fruits, shrubberies, and such essential 
things as may be lackmg. 

Even if one has but a small room to devote to this pur- 
pose it can be made very pleasing, and has the advantage 
of requiring less furniture. A fire-place with a mirror 
above it, and a large wide-ledged window opposite, make 
the room already half fitted up ! The ceiling calcimined 
with the palest blue, and the walls with a tint two shades 
deeper, will have the efEect to make the room appear more 
spacious. A border of dark and light-blue, or of bluish- 
green and gold, should be used on such walls. The 
wood-work should be stained walnut-color and varnished. 
The most suitable carpet would be an ingrain in small 
figures of blue and gray, with perhaps a bit of yellow or 
a bit of rose-color scattered through it. Plain blue or 
gray lambrequins should be used for the windows, 
trimmed with fringe of the same color. For the curtains 
beneath them, sheer Swiss muslin is always pretty and 
graceful. Sometimes they are made with a knife plait- 
ing or a fluted rufiie down the inner edges and across the 
bottom ; but they look well when finished with simple 
hems, and are much easier laundried. 

The fireplace should be treated after the manner de- 
scribed in a previous chapter, and will be found the most 
effective feature in the room, especially if furnished with 
a good sized mirror, which will reflect back all the light 
and beauty of the apartment, and, like the cool color on 
the walls and ceiling, enhance its size. Indeed, I would 
advise all those tasteful but restricted home-keepers who 
are anxious to have really attractive parlors, to aim for 
4 



74 FAEM HOMES, IN-DOORS AND OUT-DOORS. 

simply these three things — a large, wide-silled window, a 
fire-place, and a generous-sized mirror to place above it — 
letting curtains and carpet and chairs come about as they 
can ; or using for a while plam shades for the windows, 
and a neat matting for the floor. Adding two or three 
pictures, a few books, some growing vines, and an easy 
chair to such a room, it is already cosy and hospitable in 
its aspect. 

In this room, as in all. others, one should avoid a clut- 
tered, crowded appearance. Do not afflict the walls 
with a general outbreak of small pictures, brackets, and 
fancy articles, as if a notion-store were being fitted up. 
It is better to distribute such things throughout the 
house, that each room may have its two or three touches 
of graceful fancy. 

For a table obtain something in a round or oval shape. 
It may be of pine or whitewood, but must be strong and 
substantial. Paint the legs black and varnish them. 
The top can be covered with a blue or gray cloth, em- 
broidered about the edges, if one has time, with silk, or 
with zephyr wool. Above the table suspend a pretty 
hanging lamp with shade. 

Sometimes old chairs can be purchased at an auction, 
or dragged out of a garret, and transformed into beauti- 
ful things with pamt and varnish, decalcomania-gildings, 
and stuffed seats of rep or cretonne. These, with a light 
willow rocker, or a camp-chair, and a handsome foot- 
stool or two, will comfortably complete the furnishing. 



THE DAIEY-ROOM Ai^D BUTTEfi-MAKING. 75 

CHAPTER lY. 
THE DAIRY-ROOM AND BUTTER-MAKING. 

This department of the farm-house, as well as the 
kitchen and the flower-garden, should be the pride and 
joy of the country-woman's heart. 

It is stated that the best butter is now made at the 
large Creameries or Butter-Factories. It is because 
these establishments have every facility and convenience 
for the work, and maintain thorough care and attention 
in the work. There is no magic in the making of the 
high-priced delicious butter, tasting of June's own roses 
and clover fields, that finds its way to favored tables. 
The milk of healthy, well-treated cows, is given its best 
chance, and is transformed by the best methods into butter. 
That is all. And the farm-homes must be few where 
these conditions and rules cannot be maintained, if there's 
only a resolute will to lead the way. 

If butter is "made on any considerable scale, a Dairy- 
house should be built, with thick walls and deep eaves, 
over a pure running brook or cool spring, or arranged so 
that living water a foot or more in depth can be carried 
through it in troughs resting upon the floor, with ample 
space for walking between them. In these troughs the 
milk can be placed, in cans or cocks, in such quantit'e? 
that the level of the water will be a little higher than 
that of the milk. Experienced butter-makers have found 
this to be the most satisfactory arrangement possible for 
keeping the milk at a cool, even temperature, between the 
time of setting and skimming. 

Everything about this milk-house should be kept im- 
maculately sweet and clean. The building should be 
well ventilated, but not breezy, and the windows pro- 



76 FARM HOMES, IN-DOORS AXD OUT-DOORS. 

vided with wire screens and movable shutters, by which 
dust and flies can be guarded against, and the sunlight 
tempered. All animal and vegetable odors should be far 
removed, for, as every one knows, milk is very sensitive 
to the slightest taint or olfensiveness in the atmosphere. 

Nothing less sweet than clover fields or orchards should 
be near, and the current of the spring or brook should 
be swift enough to prevent any harm from standing water. 
At one end of the building should be plenty of space for 
a table, a churn, and all the utensils and appliances for 
milk and for butter-making. It would be best if this 
were separated from the main room by a partition. 

In places where the advantage of water is lacking, the 
next best arrangement for milk is a clean, dry, well- 
ventilated cellar, with screened windows, whitewashed 
walls, a brick, stone, or cement floor, and easy steps lead- 
ing down to it. A dumb-waiter might easily be intro- 
duced, and prove a great saving of time and muscle in 
carrying the milk and the pails, pans, et cetera, up 
and down. Of course a milk-cellar should be used for 
its legitimate purpose alone, fruits, vegetables, and all 
other cellar stores being kept in a strictly separate room. 

Next to a suitable dairy-room, the first step in the 
direction of good butter-making is to give the cows good 
care. No one has any moral right, and ought not to 
have any legal right, to possess cows or any other living 
creatures, unless he can treat them well. We need no 
wider insight into the meanness of a man's real nature, 
than to see his cows and horses and dogs wince at his 
approach ! 

A good farmer is good to his cows ; and well-treated 
cows yield far richer and more abundant milk than the 
poor, half-fed, worried animals, to whom milking-time is 
more or less of a terror. 

Cows should have in summer abundant pasturage, pure 
water, and plenty of shade, with no nagging from dogs 



THE DAIRY-ROOM AHD BTJTTER-MAKIKG. 7Y 

or from thoughtless boys, who are in haste to have the 
"chores" over. In winter, it is melancholy to see cows 
shrinking and crouching in a bleak, unsheltered yard, 
with no escape from a biting wind or a sleety storm, until 
they are put into ill-cared for stables at night, with the 
snow still clinging to their cold wet hides. It would be 
bad enough for a man to wear a wet over-coat all day, but 
he would consider himself decidedly ill-treated, if he were 
made to sleep in it all night in a draughty shed. Coavs 
enjoy getting into dry clothes as well as any one ! — so let 
them have a vigorous brushing when they have been ex- 
posed to snow, and give them plenty of clean dry litter 
for their nightly comfort. They should have shelter at 
all times, summer and winter, whenever they are inclined 
to seek it. In winter their food should be all the well- 
cured hay they will eat clean, plenty of water, and a little 
treat of roots or grain every morning. Do not regard it 
as silly to give them caressing pats at milking-time, and 
let them have names of their own, and learn to answer 
to them. 

The little good-natured, affectionate Jersey, if you can 
afford to pay the price asked for her, is one of the best 
cows for supplying the table with rich and delicious milk. 
Even children can milk these mites of c^ws, and they 
easily become great pets. It may be thought by those 
unfamiliar with their good qualities that their small size 
is against them, and that some big common cow will re- 
turn more milk for a much smaller investment of money. 
But what the Jersey lacks in quantity compared with our 
common cows, in their "new milch" time, she makes up 
in quality in a steady yield of milk throughout the year 
— except for^a short interval before calving, when she is 
with difficulty dried off. They arrive at maturity early, 
generally giving milk when two years old, and often when 
younger. They are as hardy as the common breeds, and 
more easily kept — as they have the inherited trait of 



78 FARM HOMES, IN-DOORS Aiq^D OUT-DOORS. 

being accustomed to, and content with, small quarters, 
and will nibble patiently about wherever a little grass 
grows, instead of hooking down bars or bounding over 
fences in search of possible better feed ; so that they 
are not only good cows on general principles, but are 
particularly good cows for village-families, or for small 
farm-homes where pasturage is limited. 

For both quality and quantity of milk, for large size, 
for good beef, and for easy keeping, the Durham stands 
high in the scale of excellence, and has been widely intro- 
duced in this country. Allen's Cattle Book says they 
have been known to give from thirty-four to thirty-six 
quarts a day on grass pasture only — being equal to from 
twelve to fifteen pounds of butter per week. Mr. Allen 
thinks the Shorthorn crosses with the native stock prove 
to be more profitable to ordinary farmers than the pure 
breed, and certainly they are far less expensive. 

But whatever the breed, rare or common, every com- 
mon-sense farmer bears in mind that there is almost as 
much in the proper treatment of cows as in their lineage. 

At milking-time, m the best dairies, the cows' bags are 
washed and wiped dry before the milk is drawn ; and if 
the weather is rainy, they are placed in shelter and their 
flanks and bags rubbed dry, before milking, that no hint 
of what IS called a "cowey" taste may be conveyed to 
the pails. Milking should be performed in a cheery and 
vigorous manner. No one is required to sing at the work 
unless he feels like it, but I've no doubt the "singing 
milkmaid," who figures in pastoral poetry, gets more 
milk in her pail than the glum and silent farm-hand 
who plumps himself down with a crossly drawn out ''so- 
0-0 !" and falls to milking as if he hated existence gener- 
ally and the dairy business in particular. 

It is hardly necessary to suggest that the pails, strainers, 
pans, and everything belonging to dairy-work should be 
perfectly clean and sweet. 



THE DAIRT-KOOM A^iq^D BUTTER-MAKING. 79 

The milk should be strained into pans as soon as pos- 
sible, and kept in a cool, even temperature until the cream 
has risen. The cream from one milking churned by it- 
self makes the very best butter, and as this necessitates 
frequent churning, so much the better — the butter is 
surer to be sweet and perfect in flavor. Twenty-four 
hours IS usually considered sufficient for the rising of 
the cream ; but in a cool dairy-room, if the number of 
cows is not too large, the milk can be allowed to stand 
enough longer to be divided into three churnings a week 
without detriment to the butter flavor. 

The *'grain" of butter, the butter-globule or cell, is 
something not considered by every dairy-woman. If it is 
destroyed, the butter is " salvey," and of inferior value ; 
if preserved, the butter is firm and solid. Too rapid 
churning is apt to crush the gram. The churning pro- 
cess should not be performed mside of forty or fifty 
minutes, and the common dash-churn has been accepted, 
as about the best in use. A swmg-churn, recently in- 
vented, which dashes the cream from one end to the other, 
and has no troublesome inside work, has been received 
with favor, and as it is worked with a crank, must be 
much easier to use than the one first mentioned. 

As soon as the butter has ^' come," it should be taken 
from the churn with a wooden ladle, and washed in pure 
cold water, using a wooden butter-worker, and never 
touching it with the hands. A capital da ry-woman in 
Wisconsin places her freshly churned butter on an inclined 
white-oak plank, about two and a half by three feet in 
size, and works and salts.it with a long flat stick made 
square at the end. On this surface — the board can be 
a larger one if needed — the butter can be spread out 
and rinsed and salted m a little time. An ounce of salt 
and a quarter of an ounce of loaf-sugar, well mixed, is 
used for every pound of butter. After salting, the but- 
ter may be set away for a few hours, and then be worked

agaii , and either made into rolls, or prints, or packed in 
jars, in the latter case being put down very firmly, and 
covered with a nice white cloth dipped in brine. When 
the jar is filled, brine is poured over it, and a cloth, cut 
to exactly fit, is placed smoothly on top. 

In winter-churning a natural June-like color can be 
given to the sweet, but rather palhd butter, by grating 
the outside of two or three well-cleaned orange carrots 
into a cup of new milk, which strain through a wet cloth 
into the cream previous to churning. 



CHAPTER V. 
CHEESE. 



"The English method of preparing rennets," says 
Prof. Hodgeboom, *'is to steep them in brine strong 
enough to float an egg, putting six rennets, a sliced lemon, 
and an ounce of saltpetre to two gallons of brine. This 
is made six weeks before it is to be used, and it is con- 
Bidered that age improves its qualities." 

Hydrochloric acid is used in Holland, where such fa- 
mous cheese is made, in place of rennet ; and the process 
of obtaining the curd is not only simplified, but more of 
it is obtained from the same quantity of milk. 

A good cheese is made by removing the cream from a 
night^s milking after it has stood ten or twelve hours, 
and adding ^he skimmed milk to the fresh morning's 
milk after warming it to new-milk heat. 

*' Stilton " and ** Cream Cheddar " — very rich cheeses 
— are made by adding the night's cream to the morning 
milk, in the proportion of one quart of cream to ten 



CHEESE. 81 

quarts of milk. A cloth strainer is placed in a tub, so 
that the bottom, and sides are covered, the warm milk 
poured in, rennet added (any good recipe book will give 
explicit directions as to the proportions used), and after 
the curd is formed it is cut in squares, carefully lifted out 
in the strainer, and placed in a cheese-basket to drain. 
After draining it is placed m a small hoop not more than 
six or seven inches in diameter and eight and nine inches 
high, with a "follower" pierced with holes at each end. 
It is then placed on a shelf and turned four or five times 
a day with no pressure. It is not salted in the curd, like 
other cheese, but when it becomes firm enough to handle 
it is bandaged and salt rubbed on externally until it is 
sufficiently seasoned. 

The * ' whole milk " cheese is the kind most commonly 
made is this country in large dairies. On farms where 
there are but few cows, the skimmed night's milk added 
to the morning milking is more frequently used. t"hese 
cheeses are made in the same way as "Stilton," except 
that the curd is salted and weights are used in pressing 
them. 

Little "Sage" cheeses are very nice. A milking from 
four or five cows will make one. Steep a large handful 
of fresh sage leaves in a pint of new milk. Divide the 
milk for the cheese in two tubs equally, and into one of 
them strain the milk from the sage, which will make it 
of a delicate green color. Add rennet to both tubs, and 
when the curds are ready for salting, mix the two together, 
and put to press in a small hoop with a weight. These 
cheeses have a peculiarly rich and pleasant flavor.

CHAPTER VI. 
THE FLOWEK GARDEN. 

A bit of Flower Garden carefully and intelligently culti- 
vated, ** yields" more to its loving possessor, than any 
other feature of a country home ; for, aside from its beau- 
tiful and fragrant blossoms, it yields the tonic of sunlight 
and pure air, the soothing balm of sweet and faithful 
companionship, and the inspiration of continually un- 
folding beauty. 

"To have a flower garden," says an English writer, 
'* is to have many friends continually near." And it is 
indeed wonderful and beautiful, the subtle sympathy 
and friendliness that seems to lean out of flowers toward 
those who love them and faithfully care for them. 

As there is nothing more melancholy before a farm- 
house door than an ill-kept yard, in which a few plants 
are pitifully struggling for life among besetting and tri- 
umphant weeds, so there is nothing more cheerful and 
fascinating than smooth turf, a tidy walk, cleanly-grow- 
ing shrubs, and luxuriant, happy-faced flowers. 

"But I have no time for such work," some weary 
home-keeper may say. Then take time ! No other in- 
vestment of twenty or thirty minutes out of the dayUglit 
hours will pay as well, unless it be twenty or thirty min- 
utes devoted to a restful nap ! Your housework is con- 
fining. Much of it is hard and monotonous, and brings 
wrinkles to your forehead, and maybe an ache to your 
spine ; and there's not much joyousness or sweetness 
about an unrelieved routine of baking and dish-washing, 
and baby-tending from Sunday morning until Saturday 
night. Then all tlie sooner sliould you come out in the 
open air and form the acquaintance of happy and health- 
ful things that would be glad to know you. 



THE FLOWER GARDEK. 83 

It is not necessary to begin on a grand scale. A little 
money for seeds and shrubs, and a little half-hour out of 
the day will go an astonishing ways, and amply repay the 
expenditure. A large garden, with a great yariety of 
flowers and shrubs, would require the constant attention 
of at least one pair of hands to keep it in suitable condi- 
tion, and this, in most farm-homes, cannot be afforded. 
It is the little plat well-tilled that the average farm-wife 
has time for ; and greater satisfaction and more splendid 
results come from a few well-chosen plants thoroughly 
cultivated, than from a great mass of things only half 
looked after. 

In the country, where congenial soils, manures, ample 
grounds, and the right sort of exposure are always easily 
secured, it is a wonder that every farm-house is not re- 
fined and adorned in this way. And yet, around thous- 
ands of country homes, flower-cultivation is either ignored 
altogether, or confined to a lilac bush more or less strag- 
gling, and maybe a tuft of striped grass or *' live-forever," 
to keep it company. This state of things is owing, not 
so much to an indifference to beautiful thiags, as to the 
feeling that there is no time for them. I am afraid, too, 
that in some instances the "good man" is answerable 
for the lack of pretty flowers and neat walks about his 
house, having a mistaken idea that a flower garden is 
nonsense, and that nothing is profitable unless it can be 
weighed or measured and toted off to market. This is 
the sort of man that makes farm-life abominable, for his 
scorn of a few lily-bulbs and roses does not end with 
them, but is apt to be poured out on other forms of every- 
day beauty and comfort. His wife's face gets the solemn 
unhopeful look seen too often on women's faces, his sons 
turn away from farming in disgust, and his daughters 
will be apt to think twice before they marry farmers. 

However, something can be done with even such a de- 
pressing curmudgeon at the head of the family. No

doubt there may be something of a conflict at the first 
outbreak in the direction of adornment, and if he is par- 
ticularly savage, several seasons of struggle may be main- 
tained before he can be brought to see that flowers and 
shrubberies are ^^profitc^ble," that the love and care of 
them lightens his wife's burdens and brightens her health, 
that their aromatic presence helps to keep the air puie 
and wholesome, and that the mere sight of the roses and 
lilies nodding to each other across the broad, neat Tvalk, 
adds ten per cent to the value of his home. 

Then do not be discouraged, my home-keeper, if along 
with your many cares and duties, an offish husband stands 
m the way of a little flower-culture. Go quietly and very 
good naturedly to work, and the beautiful things wnll 
steal upon him unawares. Or, if you are obliged to call 
upon him for assistance, be firm and fearless — and still 
good natured — and in his secret heart he will admire your 
growing ambition, though he growls and grumbles with 
every plunge of his spade, and pokes over your papers of 
long-named seeds with many a sarcasm. 

Do not make the common mistake of new beginners, 
which is to sow a great variety of seeds without regard to 
their tender or hardy qualities, and covering them all 
alike whether as large as a Castor Bean, or as tmy as a 
Petunia. Many do this, and expect to have a floral 
Paradise, when very likely only a few of the seeds will 
show themselves. A good guide like Mr. Henderson's, 
of New York, or Mr. Vick's, of Rochester, and many 
others, will tell what every flower is, and how and when 
its seeds should be planted. From them and from my 
own experience, I will condense a few facts that will be 
helpful to the amateur, and save her from a few expen- 
sive mistakes. 

A dozen varieties of good annuals, with a few bulbs and 
shrubs, are quite enough for a handsome beginning. 

A suitable soil is the first thing to be secured. A 



THE FLOWER GARDEX. 85 

too clayey, or a too sandy soil, will need to be made over 
before it will grow flowers successfully. Equal quanti- 
ties of sand, loam, manure, and well-rotted tur:- or leaves, 
makes a soil in which nearly all plants will thrive. 
Therefore, if the soil is heavy, clayey loam, lighten it 
with sand and leaf -mould. If too sandy and light, mix 
with it a little leaf or turf-mould, and peat or muck from 
rich meadows. Sand is quite an indispensable element — 
making the soil warmer and mellower, and easier drained. 
If a soil lacks sand one must take pams to obtain enough 
of it to make the ground for seed-sowing soft and friable. 

The best location for flower-borders or parterres is 
to the southeast — the sun from dawn to noon being bet- 
ter than afternoon light, which, through the summer, is 
scorching, and withering rather then invigorating to 
most plant-life. Southwestern light ranks next, while 
the north side of the house is the- very last place to be 
devoted to this purpose, although there are some varie- 
ties of plants, like Pansies, Lily of the Valley, Ferns, and 
Myrtle, that will flourish finely in such a location. 

The beds or ** borders" can be made in endless variety 
of shapes, but those simply made, and consequently 
.easier kept m order, are a greater satisfaction to the eye, 
and certainly more comfortable to the laborer. These 
fanciful crescents, hearts, stars, etc., require a great deal 
of care in bordering the edges with something that will 
keep them well defined, and in maintaining smooth, clean 
walks among them. So if one has little time, and still 
less assistance, it is best io make straight beds, not more 
than two feet wide, on either side of the walk leading to 
the gate. These, with " mounds " for Verbenas, Petu- 
nias, and such plants as like to trail about m consider- 
able space, will be sufficient field for almost any one. 

Have the beds spaded to the depth of two feet, and the 
soil properly prepared. The beds, when completed, 
should not be more than three or four inches above the

path. The path, or walk, must be wide enough for two 
people to walk side by side without brushing against the 
flowers. It should be paved with brick, or large, flat 
stones, or hardened with gi-avel, or neatly planked, 
plank being least desirable, because it so soon decays and 
becomes unwholesome from the dampness and mould be- 
neath it. Bricks set edgewise make a good border for 
the beds, or large, smooth pebbles, or narrow planking 
can be used. Narrow strips of turf, if kept in ^' living 
green," and neatly clipped, make a pretty edge, but it 
will require care. 

In February or March, according to latitude, seeds 
should be ordered, and such as require it should be 
started in boxes in the house, so that by the time spring 
is fairly begun, and the ground is warm, the young plants 
will be all ready for their out-door quarters. Nearly all 
annuals, m the Northern States, should be started m the 
house. This process makes them several weeks earlier, 
when, if they are sown late m the open ground, the Sep- 
tember frosts often come to cut them down just as they 
have unfolded into beautiful bloom. 

HARDY BULBS AND PLANTS. 

From a list of Hardy Bulbs select a few desirable ones, 
and plant them in the borders six or seven feet apart, 
which will leave space for the annuals. These phmts, 
aside from a yearly enriching of the soil, plenty of water 
dunng their flowering season, and an occasional dividing 
of roots, need scarcely any attention, which fact, com- 
bined with the great beauty and fragrance of the kinds 
here mentioned, makes them actually necessary to every 
flower-lover's happiness. Of good Lilies, especially, one 
cannot have too many. A few years ago — when fresh from 
Japan, they were sold only at very high prices, but now 
they are offered at such low figures that every garden 
should have one, at least, from this glorious family. 



THE FLOWER GARDE2!?-. 87 

Lilium auraturrif or Golden-banded Lily of Japan, lias 
a large, white, graceful blossom, with a golden band 
through the center of each petal. It sometimes puts 
forth twenty blossoms from a single stalk, and is delici- 
ously fragrant. Flowers in July and August. 

Lilium longifiorum has trumpet-shaped flowers of clear 
alabaster white, from five to eight inches in length, open- 
ing early in July. 

Lilium speciosum unfolds in August a magnificent, 
blossom of rich, rose color, spotted with crimson and 
purple, and little shining points like crystalized dew. 

These lilies rapidly put forth little bulbs below the 
surface, and should be divided every year or two and 
planted separately, about three inches deep. 

Lilium candidum, named by the florists as the ** Com- 
mon Garden Lil}^," and bearing a lower price than the 
above sorts, is not so common, but it would prove a 
lovely novelty in many a garden, especially in the West. 
It has large, white flowers, and is very fragrant, blossom- 
ing in June and July. 

Plant these lily-bulbs late in the fall, in rich, mellow 
soil, about six inches below the surface. Do not let any 
manure touch the bulbs, as it might rot them, but spread 
it upon the top. As severe weather comes on add a 
slight covering of leaves. These lilies can also be grown 
in pots as window-plants. I have started candidum 
lilies in December, and had' glorious flowers for Eastor. 

A few bulbs of Polyantlius Narcissus, cream- white 
and yellow, a fragrant, early spring flower, will be liked. 
Plant them under four inches of soil, about the first of 
November. 

Every garden should have a bed of the Lily of the Val- 
ley — ^they are such delicious little flowers ! The open 
border is not suitable for them, as they prefer a shaded, 
moist comer, and in such a place, and with no other care 
than Nature's, they will send up their rich leaves and

waxen bells before the summer flowers have even dreamed 
of blossoming. The bulbs are very small, and are sold, 
cheaply, by the dozen or the hundred. 

Among P monies, in place of the solitary double red sort 
that used to be the pride of every well-regulated country 
garden, are now found a hundred varieties. Doubtless 
three or four of the best sorts would satisfy the demands 
of a small garden. They are brilliant, showy flowers, and 
are often as fragrant as roses. 

Festiva ha3 a carmine center shading out into white. 

Virginalis, clear white. 

AmabiliSy rose, with white center. 

Pattsii, rich, deep crimson. 

Blush, large, rosy pink. 

Pceonies require three years to become of good size, but 
after that they increase rapidly, and require so much 
space that it is well to cut away some of their tubers, or 
*' toes," every spring, and present them to some one who 
is not so fortunate as to possess them. 

Hollyhochs are among the dear old standard flowers 
that should never be lost sight of. There are rich double 
sorts in all colors, and in view of their tall, sentinel air, 
they might be planted at either side of the gate, or in 
clumps in the grass plat. For three months and more 
they are in constant flower. If grown from seed they 
will not flower until the sec0d year. 

Larkspur is a desirable flower, because of its lovely 
shades of blue and its brave habit of blossoming early and 
late. 

Two or three sorts of Perennial Phlox should be chosen; 
and they will look best if planted in a cluster on the 
sward or against the leafy verdure of a hedge. White 
Lady and Chloris, the latter a vivid red, might be 
planted together. 

Lychnis is a brilliant and showy perennial, growing 



THE FLOWER GARDEN?-. 89 

two feet in hight, and is in two yarieties, scarlet and 
deep orange. 

DianthuSf^ov Pinks, should be generously chosen from. 
Every one loves '' pinks," from grandmother to the baby. 
There are many hardy sorts that are almost as delicious 
as the rich, but tender, Carnation. Alba, a double white, 
and Laciniatus, a fine fringed variety in various colors, 
are both bright and fragrant additions to the flower- 
border. 

Perennial Flax, a lovely blue flower, and Dicentra, the 
graceful Bleeding Hsart, should not be forgotten. 

From the foregoing list of bulbs and plants enough 
can be selected, with a few annuals, to plentifully sup- 
ply a smiill garden. And remember it is the small gar- 
den, well cared for, that we have in view. 

And now the seeds of a few choic§, rich Annuals are 
wanted for the ample space between the Perennials. 
Most beginners in flower-garden sow ten times the quan- 
tity of seed that is needed. By studying the catalogues 
of any good florist, choosing a few best sorts, and sowing 
the seeds carefully and properly, according to their needs, 
a greit deal of disappointment can be avoided. Three 
or four neighbors should club together when sending for 
seeds, and thus lessen the expense for all. Nearly every 
package contains seed enough to supply three gardens 
with whatever variety it contains, if only judiciously 
planted. 

A quantity of suitable boil should be placed in the cel- 
lar in the fall, that it may be in readiness for starting 
the seeds in boxes as early as the first of March. 

Transplanting, with the exception of Pansies and very 
hardy annuals, should not be attempted until all danger 
of spring frost is over and the ground is warm and mel- 
low. Cool, cloudy weather should be chosen for the 
work, and the young plants must be watered morning 
and evening, unless the rain comes to one's assistance.

AN'N'UALS. 

Asters. — A package of mixed seeds, or T\4iat is better, 
if dimes are not to be counted, half a dozen separate 
sorts of this beautiful summer and autumn flower, should 
be among the first selected. They are as brave as tliey 
■ are beautiful, and will cheer the eye with their bright 
blossoms long after *'the melancholy days have come," 
if sheltered from the frosty nights under a light blanket 
or shawl. The smaller plants can also be taken up in 
pots and boxes, and will continue to bloom in dining- 
room and parlor windows for several weeks. The dwarf 
sorts are especially pretty for potting. 

Antirrhinum^ or Snap-Dragon, is a rich and interest- 
ing flower ia nearly all colors. The seeds are so minute 
that one package will supply half a dozen gardens, and 
they should be covered very slightly with soil. 

Balsams are exquisite for flat bouquets, often equal- 
ling roses in beauty. These might be started in collar- 
boxes, which, at transplanting time, can be set directly in- 
to the ground (after removing the bottoms) without dis- 
turbing the roots. They should be given plenty of room. 

Coreopsis and the Double Buttercup should be given a 
corner, for as some one has remarked, no bouquet is 
quite complete without a '* drop of sunlight " in the form 
of a yellow flower. 

Candytuft comes in purple, white, and crimson, and 
this with Sweet Alyssum and Siveet Peas can be sown in 
the garden as soon as the frost is out of the ground. The 
two first are pretty for edging. The Peas should be 
planted under four inches of soil, and if planted in cir- 
cles, one within the other, can be easily supported by 
strings tied to a central pole. Painted Lady, Scarlet In- 
vincible, and Crown Princess are among the prettiest 
sorts of Sweet Peas. 

Cypress Vine, or Ipomoea quamoclit, as the florists call it. 



THE FLOWEB GARDEIT. 91 

is pretty for small trellises, in two varieties, scarlet and 
white. Every one should order a package of the large 
flowering Ipomoea in mixed colors. It resembles the 
Morning Glorj^, but is larger, and of rich and splendid 
colors. Seeds should be started in th3 house. They are 
great climbers, and think nothing of going up to chamber 
windows and clambering about the eaves. Do not forget 
*' Ipomoea — finest mixed," in making out the list of seeds. 

Lavender is a sweet and gentle flower that should al- 
ways be given a generous bed in our gardens. A few 
sprigs of it in a vase will fill a room with gT-ateful aroma, 
and when cut and dried, and placed in thin muslin bags, 
it will pleasantly perfume drawers and boxes of bed-linen, 
clothing, etc. 

Mignonette is a plain little flower, but very popular be- 
cause of its wild ''woodsy" fragrance and continual 
bloom. It is almost indispensable for bouquets, and, like 
the Aster, will bloom far into the fall, with a little pro- 
tection. To secure early growth the seeds can be started 
in boxes and very carefully transplanted, as the roots 
dislike disturbance. 

Nasturtiums. — These gay, free-flowering, old-fashioned 
flowers come out in all shades, from cream-color to deep 
velvety maroon. They are excellent for vases, hanging- 
baskets, rockeries, and make a very bright and luxuriant 
window-plant, if given good soil and plenty of sunlight. 
The dwarf sorts are best for windows and baskets, and 
the large climbing varieties for vases and rockeries. 

Pansies. — A group of large, rich-hued Pansies is a joy ! 
They require some care in sowing, and a good deal of 
rich-feeding, but they make full returns. Sow, in March, 
a packet of fine mixed sorts in rich, pulverized soil, sift- 
ing but a slight covering over them, placing panes of 
glass over the pots or boxes, and sprinkling the earth 
carefully every day with warm water. A lady, whose 
Pansies are particularly glorious, says she has the best

success in obtaining seedlings by sowing the seeds in 
boxes, merely pressing them into the dirt with the palm 
of her hand, sprinkling slightly, and covering them 
lightly with a white cloth dipped in warm water. She 
thinks the seeds are often baked to death under glass, 
but under this moist white cloth they are all sure to ger- 
minate. After the first tiny leaves have appeared, she 
removes the cloth and gives them direct sunlight through 
the morning hours, but takes care that it is tempered by 
fresh air, so as not to be too hot for them. When a few 
leaves have appeared, or after three or four weeks, they 
can be transplanted to the beds where they are to grow, 
if the ground is not too wet and cold. They will grow 
best when not exposed to afternoon sunlight. Soap-suds 
or liquid manures applied to the roots every two weeks 
will increase their luxuriance, and their various and beau- 
tiful colors will be a continual pleasure from June to 
November. 

Petunias, — White, white striped with carmine, and the 
delicate little white-throated crimson sort, are good kinds 
to select. They will have the best effect if transplanted 
to beds or mounds by themselves. Their constant bloom 
and delicate fragrance should never be missed from a 
country home. The small crimson, and the striped and 
blotched varieties, can be grown in windows, and will 
gladden many a dark winter day, if given a place between 
pots of Mignonette and Sweet Alyssum. Seeds should 
be treated the same as Pansies. 

Salvia, or Flowering Sage, in the scarlet, white, and 
blue varieties, is a very rich and beautiful flower, either 
for the house or garden.. They are rather tender, and 
must not be transplanted until all danger of frost is over. 
Small plants can be placed in pots in the fall, cut down 
a little, and kept for winter flowering. The roots of 
Salvia Patens, a deep rich blue sort, can be kept through 
the winter like other tubers. 



THE FLOWEE GARDEK. 93 

Verbenas. — From hundreds of varieties of this splen- 
did, free-flowering annual, half a dozen well chosen sorts 
will result in a fine display. For a small garden I 
would choose Snow Storm, Gazelle, Black Bedder, lona, 
Cupid, and Conspicua, — or else a package of the best 
mixed sorts. The seeds must be soaked in warm water 
twenty-four hours before planting. A shelf behind 
a kitchen stove, or a place on the back of the stove — if 
not too hot, is a good situation for the box or pots in 
which they are planted, as they need bottom-heat in order 
to germinate well. Sow m circles, or in regular rows, so 
as to distinguish them from the possible weeds which may 
spring up. When the Verbenas appear, keep them in a 
sunny window, being careful that the soil does not be- 
come too dry, and when they show the fourth leaf, trans- 
plant into little pots or boxes, where they can flourish 
until the spring is sufficiently established to place them m 
their garden beds. Slip plant and soil from the box with- 
out disturbing the roots, if possible, water plentifully, 
and shield from the hot sun for two or three days. Cut- 
tings, or "slips" can be taken from the best sorts in 
August or September, and potted for winter culture. 

SUMMER BULBS. 

Tuderose. — This waxen-petaled, richly-perfumed flower 
should be remembered when ordering summer-flowering 
bulbs. It is rarely seen in country gardens — a great sin 
of omission, as all will say who have enjoyed its lovely 
blossoms, of which it puts forth twenty-five or thirty, and 
sometimes more, to the single stalk. Bulbs must be 
started in pots as early as February or March, and the 
grower must not be discouraged if they take their own 
leisurely time for sending up their shoots. Iij August 
and September one will be well repaid for patient waitimr. 
The original bulb blooms only once, but creates a family 



94 FAKM HOMES, IIS^-DOOKS AKD OUT-DOOES. 

of little bulbs, which must be taken up after the tops 
have died down in the fall, and kept through the winter 
in a dry place where they will not freeze, and planted out 
separately in the spring. These will not flower the first 
year, but will grow into fine mature bulbs, which must 
be taken up in the fall, and potted very early in the spring, 
like the one first purchased. 

Jacobean Lily, or Amaryllis, is also rarely seen in farm 
gardens. It is a magnificent and graceful flower, of rich 
violet-crimson color. It can be started in pots, like the 
Tuberose, and the bulbs treated like Dahlias, Gladiolus, 
and the like. 

Tritoma Uvaria, commonly called "Red-hot Poker," 
because of its spikes of flame-colored blossoms, would 
also be a brilliant novelty to many. It grows to the hight 
of four feet or more, and makes a splendid appearance. 
Start in boxes early in March, and, in severe climates, 
keep the roots in sand through the winter. 

Dahlias. — These queenly flowers are familiar to all. 
There seems no end to their variety of color. The pom- 
pone or dwarf sorts are exceedingly pretty for bouquets. 
The roots must be taken up before the ground freezes, 
well dried, but not broken apart, and packed away for the 
winter in thoroughly dry sand. If it is damp, they will 
rot. In the spring, growers generally start whole clusters 
together, and divide them after the sprouts appear — leav- 
ing two or three to each tuber. While growing they must 
be tied to stakes from time to time, as they are inclined 
to break down before a brisk wind. Enrich the soil about 
them, and be careful to give water when needed. By 
covering them when frost threatens, they will bloom late 
into the fall. 

Gladiolus, — Solomon, in all his glory, could hardly 
have boasted the brilliant hues that appear in these flowers. 
The bulbs can be planted in the garden, about the last of 
April, and will have a splendid appearance if planted to- 



THE FLOWER GAEDEl?-. 95 

gether in groups. Do not manure the soil — the usual 
mixture of loam, sand, and leaf-mould, suits them best. 
"Unnamed" sorts are sold by florists at a low figure, and 
they often prove to be quite as fine as the named and 
more expensive varieties. When the tops die down in 
the fall, dig and dry the bulbs, wrap them in paper, and 
keep them in a cool, dry cellar. 

If from the foregoing list of seeds and bulbs, one can 
afford to choose but a limited variety, be sure to secure, 
at least, these treasures : Candid um and Auratum Lilies, 
Tuberoses, Dwarf Dahlias, one package of Aster seeds, 
one package of best mixed Pansies, one package of best 
mixed Petunias, one package of best mixed Verbenas, one 
package of Lavender, one package of Sweet Alyssum, one 
package of Sweet Peas, one package of Mignonette. 

HARDY SHRUBS. 

Aside from their intrinsic worth, shrubs are very de- 
sirable, because of the little care and trouble they impose. 
They are like generous friends, that give everything, and 
ask very little in return ; and still, like these same 
friends, they appreciate a bit of devotion now and then. 

The sweet, time-honored Syringas and Lilacs, I place 
first m the list. Once planted in good soil, all they re- 
quire is a little enriching and pruning once a year. They, 
and other tall shrubs, should be planted in well-chosen 
spots, where they will not obstruct pleasant views ; and 
if trimmed in tree-shapes, and the soil about them kept 
mellow, some bright annuals like Zinnias, Nasturtiums, 
or Petunias, will look prettily growing around them. 
Persian Lilacs, and Snowballs present a pleasing contrast, 
when allowed to grow in a group together. 

No garden should lack its Roses. There are many 
hardy sorts, and every one can afford two or three of 
them. In return for their royal blossoms, let them have 



96 FARM HOMES, IN-DOORS AND OUT-DOORS. 

the rich soil, and the annual cutting away of old wood 
that they need. Bewildering lists of names appear in the 
catalogues, but if I were beginning a garden on a limited 
scale, I would write to some standard florist, and ask him 
to ^send me three good hardy Roses — a pure white, a rich 
crimson, and a creamy blush — with, maybe, the " Gem 
of the Prairies," for a climber, sending, of course, the 
catalogue price for hardy roses, and I should be very cer- 
tain to be suited. 

Roses should have good loam, with a sprinkling of 
sand, and a generous admixture of rotted manure. Next 
to the rich soil, the pruning knife is necessary. Do not 
hesitate to use it, for the Roses like it, and quickly send 
out their new shoots and best blooms to tell you so. 
Shoots two years old should be cut away, and the one 
year growths pruned down a little, every fall. K any 
slugs, lice, or other enemies appear in the spring or early 
summer, make a strong suds of soft soap and rain water, 
and give the bushes a thorough bath, after which rinse 
with clear water. Be careful to see that the branches 
and the underside of the leaves get the benefit of the 
suds. In blossom-time, gather the Roses with a lavish 
hand. Glorify the house with them, and send them to 
friends and neighbors, especially if there are any sick 
ones among them, for their fresh summery breath is par- 
ticularly grateful to weary senses. 

Oak-Leaved Hydrangea is a showy and interesting 
shrub, and is covered in midsummer with very large 
clusters of white flowers. 

A Scarlet-floioered Japan Quince, and one or two vari- 
eties of SpircBtty with their feathery sprays of pink and 
white blossoms, should be afforded if possible. 

The Cannay or "Indian Shot," and Ricinus, or Castor 
Bean, both raised from seed, make a rich and striking 
appearance as summer shrubs. The seeds of the Canna 
must be soaked in hot water for a while before planting. 



TEE FLOWER GARDEIT. 97 

These plants can also be grown in large boxes, or vases, 
on the piazza, or elsewhere. They need rich soil and 
plenty of water. 

CLIMBIis'G VINES. 

Beautiful -are the ways of the Vine, whether it be tlie 
bold and vigorous Virginia Creeper, that finds foothold 
on the most forbidding wall, and grows the stronger and 
greater for the winds and storms that beat upon it, or 
the light and delicate Smilax, weaving its emerald-green 
tracery across the window panes, or around the portraits 
of beloved friends. 

The forests are full of beautiful vines. Convolvulus, 
Bitter Sweet, Scarlet, and Yellow Honeysuckle, Virgin's 
Bower, Grape, and other graceful wild cHmbers, are 
within the reach of almost every country home, and 
should be sought after and wooed to grow around porches, 
and over gateways, and up on the roofs of unlovely sheds. 

The Hop is a wholesome, thrifty vine, and if none other 
could be had, I would gladly and gratefully tram it over 
verandas, and across kitchen and pantry windows, and 
rejoice in its cool shade and clean fragrance. But who- 
ever has the good luck to live near a bit of wild wood- 
land, can be generally sure of finding many things that 
will add grace and beauty to the plainest little home. 

Then there are the annual climbers — whole worlds of 
verdure and bloom, springing from a few little seeds that 
are obtained almost for the asking ! Morning Glories, 
Scarlet Runners, Ipomoeas, Fancy Gourds, Cobea Scan- 
dens, Wild Cucumbers — all rapid and vigorous growers, 
that, by the time of dog-days weave grateful screens for 
porches and windows that face the glaring afternoon 
skies. 

Among climbers sold by florists are, Japan Honey- 
suckle, hardy, fragi-ant, and possessed of beautiful glossy

leaves, the different varieties of Clematis, the Chinese 
Wistaria of rapid growth and lovely blue flowers, the 
Trumpet Creeper, and young plants of Cobea Scan dens. 
The latter vine, if housed in the fall, makes a pretty 
climber for the windows, but it is too tender to survive 
even a slight frost, when left out of doors. 



CHAPTER VII. 
WINDOW PLANTS. 



South and east windows are the only ones in which 
plants will do their best ; and I would not advise farm- 
wives in extreme Northern States to keep many varieties 
unless they have a place suitably sunny and warm. A 
few good Geraniums and Pelargoniums, with Fuchsias, 
Heliotropes, and Feverfews, can be grown with very lit- 
tle trouble. Insects seldom trouble them, and they are 
profuse bloomers ; and if the " window garden " is con- 
fined to a dozen pots, it is not much trouble to remove 
them to a cellar or a frost-proof cupboard on severe 
nights, and bring them out into the sunlight again in the 
mornmg. Their cheerful verdure and brilliant blossoms 
richly reward such painstaking. 

GERANIUMS. 

The Dwarf Geraniums are pretty for ordinary win- 
dows, and the scarlet and the white Tom Thumbs are 
lovely when grown in a pot together. Christabel is a 
rosy pink, and Little Dear is rose color and white. There 
is also a dwarf salmon that is worth having. These are 
all single. 



WINDOW-PLANTS. 99 

Little Jewel is a double Dwarf Geranium, with blos- 
soms of rich cardinal red. The Ghost is a fine double 
white, also dwarf. 

A Madam Pollock will generally flourish in an or- 
dinary room, if kept in brilliant light and close to the 
window pane. Its foliage is richly variegated. 

It is hard to deny one's self a Sweet-scented Geranium, 
and Shrubland Pet is a good choice. 

The Pelargoniums, or Show . Geraniums, should be 
represented if one has plenty of sunlight for them. 
There are so many splendid varieties it is difficult to 
make a choice, but the Emperor would be mine, if I 
could have but one. 

"Daisy Eyebright," the brain-bright woman to whom 
I have been indebted for many a valuable hint in my care 
of plants, says that *^It is no more trouble to grow a 
Geranium than a Cabbage ! " I hope every reader of 
these suggestions, who has never tried house-plant cul- 
ture, will obtain a few varieties and see how they will 
glorify her room on some howling winter day when aU 
outside looks dreary and hopeless. 

Cuttings of Geraniums, Pelargoniums, Fuchsias, and 
Heliotropes can be ordered in July from florists any- 
where within two or three hundred miles, for little more 
than the cost of packing and postage ; and by early win- 
ter, if they have had good treatment, they will be ready 
to blossom. If young, well-rooted plants can be pur- 
chased, in place of the cuttings, so much the better, of 
course. Bear in mind that quite a number of pretty 
window-plants, like the Petunia, Mignonette, Verbena, 
and Sweet Alyssum, can be raised from seeds. 

If cuttings are ordered, attend to them as soon as they 
arrive, as they will be more or less wilted. I have re- 
ceived them, however, after a journey of more than two 
hundred miles, in as fresh condition as if they had 
merely been brought from a neighboring greenhouse, 



100 PAEM HOMES, IN-DOORS AKD OUT-DOORS. 

owing to the care with which they were packed. Make 
a place in readiness for them by taking a shallow box, or 
large flat pan, filling it half full of mixed loam and leaf- 
mould, or any good garden soil, sprinkling a layer of 
sand on top and making it well wet. Plant the cuttings 
two or three inches apart and place the box, or pan, in a 
north window, keeping the sand moist, but not sopping 
wet. When there are signs of new leaves starting, they 
can be transplanted into pots of suitable earth, using 
great care not to injure the just-formed roots, and keep- 
ing them out of the direct sunlight for two days. 

Through warm weather pot-plants should be watered 
morning and night, and always with water as warm as 
the air ; it has been proved beneficial when used even 
warmer. As cool weather advances they need less water. 
It is one of the serious mistakes of the inexperienced to 
drown plants to death in winter-time. Many ladies who 
are quite successful as window-gardeners, pour hot water 
into the saucers, and sometimes directly into the pots, 
where the depth of top-soil is sufficient to temper it be- 
fore it reaches the roots. Yet such a practice requires 
care and a knowledge of what plants will and won't bear. 
Water at blood-heat, however, is always safe, but should 
be given only when the soil is dry and requires it, 
aquatic plants being the exception to this rule. By stir- 
ring up the soil with a wooden fork, or any other handy 
little implement, one can easily see whether the plant is 
in need of water. 

FUCHSIAS. 

The best winter-blooming sorts are Speciosa and Serra- 
tifolia. They should be started early in the spring, 
if cuttings are used, and potted into particularly rich 
soil. Crown-of-Jewels is pretty all the year round, be- 
cause of its brightly-tinted foliage. Sometimes Fuchsias 



WI2S-D0W-PLANTS. 101 

are attacked, like the rose, by a miserable little beast of 
a red spider no larger than the dust of Cayenne pepper. 
He flourishes on the under side of the leaf, and if not 
exterminated will soon cause the foliage to curl up and 
drop oS, greatly to the wonder of those who do not 
understand the trouble. It is not often that the spider 
comes to this plant, but, as an ounce of prevention is 
easier than a pound of cure, it is a good plan to wash 
Fuchsias every Monday in warm, but not too warm, 
laundry suds, and rinse thoroughly in pure water. 

HELIOTROPES. 

These grow readily from cuttings, but a plant must be 
a year or two old before much can be expected of it ; so 
it is better to purchase those already rooted or partly 
grown. Its blossoms have a sweet, balsamic, honeyed 
fragrance, like the breath wafted from the pines on a 
sultry summer day. It is a great lover of sunlight. Its 
leaves are always clean and free from insects of all sorts, 
and with decent care it grows very fast. It can be 
pruned and trimmed into tree-shape, or it will conform 
gracefully to a trellis. The blossoms range in all the 
shades from deep violet to pale lavender. Good-sized 
plants can be purchased at from fifteen to twenty-five 
cents, and at still cheaper rates where several persons 
club together and so send larger orders. 

FOLIAGE PLANTS. 

These are cultivated for their rich and beautifully 
marked leaves, their blossoms being generally insignifi- 
cant. Among the Goleiis, the Golden Beauty, crim- 
son and yellow, and Her Majesty, bronze and green, 
are perhaps the finest. Give them a rich, warm soil to 
grow in, with plenty of root room, plenty of sunlight, 
and all the water they need. They grow easily and rap-

idly from cuttings. They are quite tender, and must be 
protected from chills. By pinching off the top shoots 
of young plants a denser growth can be obtained. 

Some varieties of Begonia are very rich and elegant in 
their leafage. Kex and Mrs. Alger are fine sorts. 

The Elegante, a variegated ivy-leafed Geranium, is 
highly ornamental, whether trailing about a window or 
drooping from a hanging basket. A cutting of it taken 
in August will be of good size by December. 

MON^THLY ROSES. 

There are many varieties to choose from, but one or 
two will be enough in a small collection. They require 
more attention than almost any other house-plant, and 
must have very rich soil and plenty of sunlight. Fre- 
quent baths are necessary, for they invite various pests, 
the little red spider being particularly fond of them. 
Roses will repay good care, however. I have found the 
pink Hermosa and the crimson Agrippina good sorts 
for window-culture. It is best to buy good-sized roses, 
grown on. their own roots. They are rather expensive, 
but are reliable, and in a year or two will be grown 
into fine trees. Roses will grow from cuttings, but the 
process is a slow one to those impatient for buds and 
blossoms. The Safrano, rich, flesh tint ; Isabella Sprunt, 
yellow, and White Daily, are also beautiful, free-flower- 
ing sorts. Good-sized Roses, full of buds and blossoms, 
can be purchased at from forty to fifty cents each, and 
smaller ones for much less. 

THE CALLA. 

This queenly Daughter of the Nile is a noble and 
showy plant for the window, requiring a congenial 
clayey soil and an abundance of water, being aquatic in 
its habits. From May to September it is usually set 



WINDOW-PLANTS. 103 

away in the shade, or the pot is turned over on ifcs side 
under some sheltering shrub or tree, to have a "-rest," 
and is not watered at all. This is the treatment it gets 
at the hands of the Kile through the dry season. In 
September it is repotted, if necessary, as it requires 
plenty of root room, freely watered, and placed where it 
is to grow. Soon the broa^, rich leaves begin to unfold, 
and before many weeks the flower stems push upward, 
bearing the pure white chalices that are a delight to all. 
A Call a must be two or three years old before amounting 
to much in size. In winter hot water should be poured 
into the saucers. 

SUGGESTIONS. 

Let the beginner in plant-culture keep these facts in 
mind : Window-plants, to be successfully grown in winter, 
require, first, as much light by day as can possibly be ob- 
tained, and utter darkness and a cooler temperature at 
night. No plant sleeps well in the glare of a lamp or 
within reach of a raging stove or furnace-heat. 

The air about them must be fresh and pure. Sleeping 
rooms and apartments in daily use are unfit for plant 
growth, as well as human growth, unless well ventilated. 

The plants must have soil suited to their needs ; leaf- 
mould, loam, sand, and rotted manure — equal parts of 
each — for Roses, Heliotropes, Fuchsias, Geraniums, Car- 
nations, Ivy, Violets, and all Foliage plants. A lighter, 
sandier soil better suits the Abutilon, Azalea, Bouvardia, 
Calceolaria, and Salvia. The Primrose and the Oxalis 
like a large admixture of leaf -mould, while the Calla is 
at home only in clayey loam. 

Lumps of charcoal placed in the bottom of the pots to 
the depth of an inch or more, according to the size of 
the pots, assist drainage and tend to keep the soil sweet. 

Judicious watering is of great importance. Some 



104 FARM HOMES, IN-DOORS AND OUT-DOORS. 

plants are constant "tipplers," but nearly all plants 
suited to window-culture in ordinary living-rooms require 
water only when the soil is dry. A Cactus and a Calla 
are apt to be deluged alike by the inexperienced, and yet 
their needs are widely unlike. 

Never crowd plants. Three or four vigorous, shapely 
plants growing in a bright, neatly-draperied window, are 
a much more refreshing and respectable sight than 
twenty pots huddled together, with a choked and spin- 
dling mass of things struggling up to get a glimpse of 
sunlight. 

New pots are better if soaked in water before being 
used, and old ones should be scrubbed clean. 

Callas, Fuchsias, Heliotropes, Roses, and Foliage plants, 
need plenty of root room. Geraniums will blossom more 
profusely if pot-pinched a little. 

The common unglazed pots are better for plant growth 
til an the china or the fancifully decorated ones ; but 
when a blossoming or foliage plant is wanted for the ta- 
ble, or for a parlor bracket, the pot in which it is grow- 
ing can be placed inside the ornamental one. 

When a plant has filled a pot with its roots, it must be 
repotted into one of larger size. Place a little fresh 
charcoal and earth in the bottom, set the plant with its 
ball of roots into it, and fill in firmly all around with 
fresh soil. Prune and trim the plant, if it is in need of 
such treatment, water thoroughly, and keep it in partial 
shade for two or three days, until the more or less dis- 
turbed roots begin to feel at homa 



THE VEGETABLE GAEDElf. 105 

CHAPTER VIII. 
THE VEGETABLE GARDEN". 

Choice varieties of vegetables and fruits are just as 
easily raised as poor ones, and are ten times more valua- 
ble. In the management of many farm-gardens, how- 
ever, seeds are saved as it may happen, here and there, 
or bought from the old collections of country stores, and 
only a small variety chosen at that. The result is a 
** garden" that would be quite put to shame by the plot 
of ground behind some ''city man's" house, or the cot- 
tage of some busy, intelligent mechanic, who appreciates 
the resources that lie in a bit of Mother Earth, and 
studies how to make the most of them. 

It must be confessed, too, that there is a great deal in 
emulation and competition. The villager, who is hu- 
man, doubtless likes his early peas and fine tomatoes for 
their intrinsic worth. And he likes mightily, also, to 
catch an occasional passer-by casting admiring eyes at 
his superior vegetables and clean walks ; at any rate, I 
have never known him to openly resent such glances ! 
The countryman, who, maybe, is too hurried in the 
morning and too tired at night for weeding walks and 
training vines, does not always feel this incentive. His 
garden ''looks about ag well as other farmers' gardens," 
and so he is content with a little seeding, a little weed- 
ing, and a good deal of rubbish. 

Here is another little field for reform in which farmers' 
wives and daughters can distinguish themselves. Far be 
it that they should become sun-burned and hand-hard- 
ened laborers, like those too patient toilers,- the peasant 
women of the old countries, who do both house- work 
and field-work ! But half an hour each day, lengthened 



106 FARM HOMES, IN"-DOORS AKD OUT-DOORS. 

to an hour occasionally, spent in giving attention to the 
growing of the best vegetables and luscious fruits, would be 
a far nobler and more beneficial use of time than devoting 
it to the ruffing and tucking of sewing-machine work, or 
the baking and frying of so many ** sorts " for the table, 
or the idle gossip about such a one's new dress, or the 
last installment of the weak serial story. The majority 
of farmers' wives and daughters are not given to this waste- 
fulness of time, but many are, and still think they have 
" no opportunity for putting their noses out of doors ! " 

Come into the garden, Maude ; and bring your mothers 
and sisters with you, and see what revolution you can 
create ! The young brothers, too, in spite of their pro- 
verbial hatred of weeding and hoeing, can have garden- 
ing made interesting to them, if they only have a share 
in the profits, as well as the work — which is simply 
fair. Let them have a piece of ground, and make their 
own selection of seeds. Let mothers study up with them 
on gardening, and let them assist in making labels, saving 
seeds, starting the early vegetables in boxes, and prun- 
ing and grafting, etc. It will be a wonder if their young 
eyes do not brighten, and their young muscles lend them- 
selv3s with a will to making "our garden" a success. 

The following is a short list of some of the best kinds 
of Vegetables — a few of which, I am certain, are often 
lacking in farm-gardens, but which no family will want 
to miss from their table, after having enjoyed them for 

one season : 

% 

ASPARAGUS. 

This delicious esculent, like all other good things, has 
to be earned, for it requires some care and painstaking 
to found an asparagus bed. Once made, it will hold its 
own for ten years or more, sending up its tender shoots 
close upon the very heels of winter, and alfording "a 



THE VEGETABLE GAEDES". 107 

taste of spring " long before other green things appear. 
A bed three feet wide and twenty feet long will supply 
an ordinary family. It must be spaded to three feet in 
depth, richly manured, and sprinkled with salt. Aspara- 
gus can be raised from the seed; or the young plants 
can be "purchased — and so hasten the harvest by a year. 
Conover's Colossal is one of the best sorts. The plants 
should be set two and a half feet? apart each way. The 
first spring after planting they should not be cut at all ; 
the second spring half the shoots can be used ; afterward, 
the whole bed can be draAvn upon. Always cut the shoots 
a little below the surface of the ground, and when they 
are three or four inches high. Every fall the bed must 
be manured, and stirred up with a fork, disturbing the 
roots as little as possible. 

BEAKS. 

Dwarf German Wax is one of the best and earliest 
of String Beans. Its pods are cream color, and are ten- 
der and rich. The Giant Wax — a later variety — will 
supply String Beans until late in the season, requiring 
more time for cooking than the dwarf variety. 

The Cranberry, or Wren's Egg, is the best Pole- 
bean extant. It is earlier than the Lima, and has a richer 
flavor. It is an excellent sort for winter cooking — being 
particularly good when mixed with canned corn as suc- 
cotash. 

BEETS. 

Sow the Dark Red Egyptian for early roots, and 
the Sea Kale for greens. The latter sends up new 
leaves as fast as the old ones are cut. 

CABBAGE. 

The Early Dwarf York, and Jersey Wakefield, for 
summer use, and the Flat Dutch, for winter, are excel- 



108 FAEM HOMES, IN-DOOBS AND OUT-DOORS. 

lent sorts. The smaller and more compact the head, 
the better the flavor. 

CAULIFLOWER. 

This is rather rare in ordinary gardens, and should be 
more generally cultivated. With a " boiled dinner" it is 
of finer and richer quality than cabbage, and is also 
excellent for pickling. Early Erfurt, and a late sort, 
Le Normand, are the best. 

CELERY. 

This is another rare edible among farmers. Besides 
being an excellent relish, and an ornament to the dinner- 
table, with its curly green leaves and white crisp stalks, 
it is very beneficial to the human system — being said to 
aid digestion and tranquilize the nerves. Celery, like 
Asparagus, needs a little extra culture. It is first sown 
in a bed, and the plants, when three inches high, are set 
out in rows six or eight inches apart. Professional gar- 
deners again transplant it, when it is a foot high, into 
"blanching trenches," but the Dwarf White, and the 
Boston Market, can be hilled up without moving, and 
so blanched without much trouble. As the stalks grow, 
the dirt must be heaped up about them, so that only the 
top leaves are exposed. A rich soil is needed for its suc- 
cessful growth. 

CUCUMBERS. 

Early White Spine is one of the best varieties, both 
for summer use and for pickling. 

SWEET CORN. 

Farmer's Club, and Moore's Early Concord, stand at 
the head in this article of good and nutritious food. 



THE VEGETABLE GARDEN". 109 

It should be planted at two or three different times, and 
so secured for the table from July to October. 

CARROTS. 

These vegetables are excellent for flavoring soups, and 
are also relished by many, if cooked like parsnips or 
squash. A few fed to a cow every day through the win- 
ter will much improve the quality and quantity of her 
milk. The prettily fringed leaves are nice for the 
"greens" m bouquets, when green leaves are scarce. 
Bliss's Improved Long Orange is the best sort. 

EGG PLAKT. 

This attractive vegetable, in the Pekin New Black vari- 
ety, bears fruit weighing from four to six pounds, and of 
most excellent flavor. In Northern States the seeds must 
be started in a hot-bed or in window boxes. 

LETTUCE. 

Giant's White Cos is a rich, tender variety, and can be 
used late into the summer. Early Curled Simpson is 
best for early use. 

MELON'S. 

Be sure to have a fine lot of Skillman's Fine Netted 
Muskmelons, the earliest and most delicious now grown. 
The best Watermelon? are the Excelsior and Black 
Spanish. 

ONIONS. 

Yellow Danvers and Early White Naples will give good 
satisfaction. The latter is of mild flavor, snow-white, 
and tender. 

PARSNIPS. 

The Student, a rather new variety, is the best. 



110 FARM HOMES, IN-DOORS AND OUT-DOOBS. 
PARSLEY. 

This is fine for flavoring soups, salads, and omelets, 
and for decorating meats and vegetables. Its beautifully 
curled leaves can also be used in bouquet-making. A 
bunch of it can be taken up in the fall, cut back a little, 
and planted in a box m a sunny kitchen window, where 
it will be convenient for use. 

PEAS. 

Laxton's Alpha and the Champion of England are both 
richly-flavored and prolific sorts. McLean's Little Gem 
is a good early sort, growing but a foot in hight, and re- 
quiring no support. It is well to plant the three varie- 
ties, and so have a succession of nice peas for the table 
— the Champion being the latest of all. 

PEPPERS. 

The Large Bell, Sweet Mountain, and Cherry, are de- 
sirable — ^the first two for pickling and the latter for pep- 
per-sauce. The seeds should be started in the house or 
in a hot-bed in severe climates. The Cherry pepper is 
very prettily grown in a large flower-pot or box. 

POTATOES. 

The Peerless, the Early Rose, the Snowflake, and St. 
Patrick are all excellent sorts. Early Rose has years ago 
establisiied itself as an early and profuse bearer. The 
Peerless is a fine potato for keeping. I have found them 
as firm and sound in June as when first ripened. Queen 
of the South is the best Sweet Potato for northern 
gardens, 

PUMPKINS. 

The Connecticut Field bears away the palm as being 
the richest and finest grained. 



THE VEGETABLE GAKDElf. Ill 

EADISHES. 

Give these early esculents a rich, warm bed, against a 
south wall, where, on chilly nights, a window-sash, or 
even an old blanket can be laid over them, and in an as- 
tonishmgly short time they will be large enough for the 
table. The Long Scarlet, Long White Naples, and Scar- 
let Olive are all good kinds. When sowing the seeds a 
thm layer of sand on the top of the bed will increase its 
warmth and hasten germination. 

SPINACH. 

This vegetable affords another early dish for spring 
dinner-tables, and should be grown in every garden. 
Broad- Leaved Flanders is the earliest and best sort. 

SQUASHES. 

The Boston Marrow is an excellent sort for fall use, 
and the old reliable Hubbard the best for winter. For 
summer use the Scolloped Bush occupies small space 
and bears profusely. 

TURN^IPS. 

Golden Ball and Buist's Improved Ruta Baga are the 
best yellow varieties. 

TOMATOES. 

The Trophy and White Apple are the finest varieties 
that have yet appeared. In Northern States start the 
seeds under glass, about the middle of March. When 
two inches high transplant into little pots or boxes, and 
when warm weather is established, set them in rows in 
good, mellow soil, four feet apart. Water them thor- 
oughly and shield from the hot sun and from hard winds 



112 FARM HOMES, I1S"-D00ES AND OUT-DOORS. 

for three or four days. As they grow top-heavy, make 
supports for them. Clip the ends a little when the fruit 
begins to appear, and early and magnificent tomatoes 
will be the result. 

HERBS. 

Anise, Balm, Horehound, Hyssop, Mint, Saffron, 
Sage, and Summer Savory, together with Dill and Cara- 
way should all be represented m the kitchen garden, and 
given good soil and care. They are all easily grown from 
seed, but in the North it is safest and surest to st^rt them 
in a hot-bed or m window-boxes. If to be sown m the 
open ground, do not put them in until the middle of 
May. Be sure to have the soil pulverized and cover but 
slightly when the seeds are very small. All herbs should 
be gathered when m flower, and when dried put into 
paper bags and labelled. Sage, Savory, Mint, and Thyme 
are especially useful m the kitchen, while Horehound, 
Hyssop, and Anise are harmless and oftentimes effectual 
medicines for mild ailments. 

HOW TO MAKE A HOT-BED. 

If it can be so arranged it should be built against a 
shed or a board fence, with its face to the southeast or to 
the south. Horse-manure is the best to use for this pur- 
pose. Make a frame of boards or plank as large as de- 
sired, and a foot and a half higher at the back than in 
front, so as to furnish a slanting support for the glass to 
rest upon. It should be two feet high m front. Place 
the manure in the bottom to the depth of a foot and a 
half. It should be well fermented and warm. Over it 
spread a few inches of good garden-soil, in which is a fair 
mixture of sand. Cover the bed with the window-sash 
and let the sun blaze in upon it through two or three 
bright days, having taken the precaution to bank the bed 



SMALL FRUITS AI^D GARDEN FRUIT TREES. 113 

on the outside with soil and manure. Plant the seeds in 
rows with labelled sticks between each kind. Sprinkle 
over warm water with a rose-sprinkler, and adjust the 
sashes. Give the bed fresh air at noon every fair day, 
and see that the young plants do not suffer for water. 



CHAPTER IX. 

SMALL FRUITS AND GARDEN FRUIT TREES. 

Without undertaking any great detour through the 
extensive field of Horticulture, I will name some fruits 
that everybody owning an acre of land, with the blessing 
of God's sunlight upon it, ought to have. As with 
vegetables, it involves no more time, labor, or space, to 
grow good fruits than to grow poor and unimproved 
sorts. And aside from the not great expense of securing 
good varieties, there is no reason why the farmer's table, 
above all tables in the world, should not be supplied, the 
year round, with these most delicious and healthful of 
foods, viz: Apples, Cranberries, and dried or canned Ber- 
ries, for winter and spring ; Currants and Strawberries 
for early summer ; Raspberries, Blackberries, and Melons 
from July to September ; Grapes, Pears, Plums and 
Peaches throughout the autumn. What a magnificent 
bill of fare ! And all, with the exception of large apple 
trees, can be grown upon an acre of ground. 

APPLES. 

Among Apples suited to garden inclosures is the Tetof- 
sky, which has this hard name because it is a Russian 



114 FARM HOMES, IN-DOORS AND OUT-DOORS. 

apple. It only requires ten feet of space, bears at an 
early age, and alfords ripe fruit in July and August. 
The apples are fair-sized, bright golden-yellow, with a 
red stripe, mildly acid, and richly aromatic. It is a 
hardy tree. 

Among Crab-apples the Montreal Beauty, Hyslop, and 
Transcendent, are the best sorts. 

Every farmer should have in his orchard the luscious 
Red Astrachan and Fall Jenneting, for early use, and for 
winter the Westfield Seek-no-Further, and the Golden 
Pippin. 

BERRIES. 

In these fruits a little investment of money brings 
prompt and large returns. Fifty Strawberry plants and 
a few "canes" of Raspberries will, in two years, load the 
family table with their generous fruitage. 

Strawberries. — Monarch of the AVest is one of the best 
berries for family use, being large, tender, mildly acid, 
and very productive. The Great American is an im- 
mense berry, being exhibited at fairs seven, eight, and 
nine inches in circumference. It is quite a new variety, 
and a few plants of it would make an interesting ** gar- 
den " for some ambitious farm-boy or girl to look after. 
For market culture the old Wilson's Seedling seems to 
be unsurpassed. 

Raspberries. — Mammoth Cluster and Gregg are tiie 
finest of the Black Caps. Turner and Herstine are good 
and hardy red sorts, and Antwerp Yellow is a creamy 
orange berry of good quality and flavor. 

Raspberries should be planted in rich, mellow soil, 
three or four canes to the hill. After the berry harvest 
is over each fall, the old stalks or canes should be cut 
out, as it is the new ones that bear the next year's fruit, 
and they will be far more vigorous and productive from 
having the field to themselves. 



SMALL FRUITS A5s"D GARDEIT FRUIT TREES. 115 

Blackberries. — The Lawton and Early Wilson bear 
fruit of enormous size, and well repay good cultivation. 

Gooseberries, — Smith's Improved is moderate and com- 
pact in growth, and largely productive, thus recommend- 
ing itself for garden culture. Eoe's Early Ruby is an- 
other excellent sort. 

Currants. — The Black Naples is a large, fine sort, ex- 
cellent for wine and jelly. The White Grape is an early 
and profuse bearer, and the Red Cherry, a sort that 
should be grown in every garden in place of the small, 
common variety. 

GRAPES. 

In Europe " grape-cures " are established, to which all 
sorts of debilitated, blood-poisoned people go, to live — 
aside from a little bread — entirely upon grapes, sunlight, 
and pure air for weeks at a time. It is one of the ** reg- 
ulations" that these happy invalids must pick their own 
grapes, and, as their appetites rapidly increase, it is no 
doubt a fact that they owe, in part, their recoveries, 
which are generally certain, to the almost constant sun- 
light and the invigorating mountain air in which they 
pass their waking hours. 

Grape-cures, or almost any kind of fruit-cures, might 
be established in our own gardens and on our own hill- 
sides. The prescription is a very simple one ; enough 
of sound, ripe fruit (eaten at regular intervals) to satisfy 
hunger, the fruit to be picked by the invalids themselves, 
thus insuring pure air, sunlight, and mild exercise. The 
grape is one of the best and purest of tonics, and eaten, 
as it is in such instances, almost exclusively, a cleansed 
and purified system is the result, with all its happy man- 
ifestations in brightened eyes, clear and ruddy complex- 
ions, tranquil nerves, and active mental and physical 
powers. Beginning with currants — which are almost

equal to grapes, medicinally — and eating one's way 
through strawberries, raspberries, and blackberries, into 
the pears, plums, and grapes of autumn, accompanying 
the course with the best of wheat-bread, morning baths, 
plenty of sleep, plenty of bright, dry, out-door air and 
pleasant exercise, would build a weakened constitution 
up *'as good as new." 

First upon my list of Grapes I should place the early 
and delicious Delaware, a single cluster of which fills a 
room with delightful, fruity aroma. It is a sweet, juicy, 
thin-skinned grape, growing in compact bunches, in color 
a light, half -transparent red. It is one of the best sorts 
for the table, and particularly suited, on account of its 
early ripening, to the extreme Northern States. 

The Lady is a new white grape, also early. It is large, 
sweet, rich, and thin-skinned. At present it is sold at a 
higher price than the more plentiful sorts. 

The Clinton is a vigorous, hardy, profuse-bearing 
grape, not so good for eating, but excellent for wine and 
jelly. 

The Catawba and Isabella are among the best varieties, 
but, being late in ripening, are sometimes cut off by 
frosts in the Northern States. 

PEARS. 

In this most desirable fruit the Bartlett and a new 
sort, the Souvenier de Congress, are the best to choose 
for summer ripening, the latter being in perfection early 
in August. Swan's Orange, Seckel, and Vicar of Wink- 
field, are splendid fall and winter sorts. 

PLUMS. 

Choose the Lombard, Golden Drop, and Imperial 
Gage. 



BEST FOODS — METHODS OF PEEPAKINQ. 117 

PEACHES. 

Barnard's Yellow Eare-ripe, Large Early York, and 
Mixon's Free, are all first-class varieties. It is a consoling 
fact to people living above the peach *^ belt "that this 
fruit is now so nicely preserved by the "evaporation" 
process. It is much cheaper than the canned fruit, and 
when gently stewed in a thin white-sugar syrup is very 
delicious. 



CHAPTER X. 



THE BEST FOODS— AND SOME BEST METHODS OP 
PREPARING THEM. 

**The best human food," writes an eminent physician, 
"I believe to be Wheat — the king of grains ! It contains 
all the flesh-forming, nerve-producing, bone-making, fat- 
creating elements of nutrition. Bread is, indeed, the 
Staff of Life, and wheat is the perfection of bread. I 
know of no article of food which so perfectly sustains all 
the powers of the human system as wheat properly cooked 
and eaten in its integrity. " 

By integrity the Doctor means in its complete and un- 
adulterated wholeness. 

There is no division as to the desirablene^ of pure 
wheat flour. No one wants to eat chalk, alum, or plaster 
of Paris, and the farmer who has his wheat ground under 
his own eyes, and his bread made at home, is happily 
spared all *' refinements " of this sort in his daily loaf. 

The open question is, whether the fine, white portion 
of the wheat alone, or the whole grain ground together, 



118 FARM HOMES, IN-DOOES AXD OUT-DOOES. 

makes the healthiest bread for the human family — the 
majority of investigators favoring the whole grain. 

Prof. Thurber says ; **In fine flour the percentage of 
starch is much greater, and that of the albuminoids and 
earthy matters less, than in the whole grain ; conse- 
quently this is not so nutritious as a flour which more 
nearly represents the wheat itself. Pure * Graham ' flour 
should consist of the whole wheat ground fine, but much 
that is sold under this name is merely bran and shorts 
subjected to a second grinding. Properly made, Graham 
flour is very nutritious, but, owing to the amount of 
crude fibre it contains, it irritates the bowels of weak 
persons. " 

New ways of grinding have been invented, by which 
simply the hull or bran is removed and the wheat then 
ground, which makes a fine, and at the same time, a 
most nutritious flour. And this must be the flour to be 
chosen by those who hold in the hollow of their hands, 
so to speak, the health of the family. 

Without waiting for the new processes any farmer can 
have his wheat ground into genuine, honest Graham, 
reserving a portion of the grist for ** fine flour " for occa- 
sional use, or for any unfortunately ** weak persons " in 
the family with whom Graham may disagree. 

Boiled Wlieat. — Wheat boiled or steamed until it cracks 
open, and eaten either cold or warm with good, rich milk, 
and sugar, if liked, makes an excellent breakfast dish, 
and also a good dessert for dinner. 

Wheat Mush, — Coarsely ground wheat stirred into 
salted boiling water, cooked for twenty minutes, and 
served with milk and sugar is, as Dr. Nichols declares, 
**one of the nicest and best forms of food, and very 
hearty." A good sized steel coffee-mill might be used 
for "cracking" the wheat, as enough for half a dozen 
persons can be ground in five minutes. 



BEST FOODS — METHODS OF PREPARING. 119 

Wheat Bread. — It would be superfluous to tell the ma- 
jority of farmers' wives how to make good bread, but 
possibly some young or inexperienced reader may derive 
benefit from these recipes : 

If dry yeast is used, dissolve one cak-e in a little warm 
water, with enough flour for a thin batter, and let it 
stand in a warm place until light and foamy before pro- 
ceeding to mix the sponge. If hop or potato yeast is 
used, be certain that it is fresh and sweet, as no good 
bread can be made with poor yoast. Use a cupful for 
four loaves of bread. 

Sift six quarts of flour into a pan or bread-bowl, 
sprinkle over it a teaspoonful of salt, make a hole in the 
center for the yeast, which pour m and stir slowly in 
enough of luke-warm water to make a soft dough of 
all the flour. Beat thoroughly with a strong iron or 
wooden spoon, cover with a pan, and set it by the stove 
or under thick cloths, until morning. Then knead 
it from twenty minutes to half an hour, and let it rise 
again in the pan. When light, divide the dough into 
four loaves, with not more than five minutes kneading, 
and place them in buttered pans to rise. When they are 
light and spongy to the touch they are ready for the 
oven. The oven should be briskly hot at first, and then 
tempered down to milder heat. From forty-five minutes 
to an hour is required for the baking. When done slip 
them from the pans and cover with a light cloth. 

Another excellent way to make bread, and one which 
always involves the freshest and best of yeast, is as fol- 
lows : Reserve three or four boiled potatoes from those 
cooked for dinner, mash them while warm with a little 
salt, pour over them three pints of boiling water, and stir 
in two large cupf uls of flour. When this batter is cooled 
to luke-warm heat, add a yeast-cake, previously dissolved 
in water, as in the first recipe, and keep it near the stove. 
In the evening stir in flour enough for a soft dough, and

let it stand, warmly coyered in winter, until morning. 
Then give it a vigorous kneading for twenty minutes, or 
more, preparing it for the oven as in the foregoing recipe. 

Graham Bread. — The best Graham bread is made by 
taking a portion of the "sponge," or thin batter, set for 
white bread, and kneading into it enough of Graham flour 
to make it into loaves. If liked a tablespoonful of brown 
sugar may be added to each loaf. 

A Good Yeast. — To six thoroughly mashed potatoes, 
add a small cupful of white sugar, a teaspoonful of ginger, 
and a teaspoonful of salt. Place all in a kettle or pan 
upon the s*ove, and pour over it three pints of boiling 
water, m which a handful of hops has been steeped. 
Stir m flour enough for a thin batter, and set aside to 
become nearly cool, when a cupful of yeast, or two dis- 
solved cakes of dry yeast, must be added. Keep the pan 
in a moderately warm place, and entirely undisturbed un- 
til it becomes light , then stir it down and let it rise again. 
It must then be poured into a jug or jar, and put away 
in as cool a place as possible. A large cupful will be 
sufficient for four good sized loaves of bread. 

When Bread IS Fit to be Eaten. — Bread cannot be said 
to be **done" until it has been out of the oven at least 
twelve hours. A mouthful of fresh- baked bread lies 
upon the stomach very much like a leaden bullet ; and 
the wise house-keeper will endeavor to keep the bread-box 
so supplied that there may be no necessity for cutting an 
unripe loaf, in which the spongy cells caused by fermen- 
tation have had no time to harden into the palatable form 
which distmguishes bread from dough. 

Substitutes for Bread. — By keeping plenty of white 
and Graham bread m readiness for the table, those miser- 
able substitutes, salaratus biscuits, short-cakes, and the 
like, will seldom be resorted to. In fact there are very 
few kinds of biscuits, rolls, muffins, and other hot breads. 



BEST FOODS — METHODS OF PREPARIN-Q. 121 

but are more beneficial to the human stomach if left off 
the bill of fare altogether. But sometimes emergencies 
arise in which it becomes necessary for the house-keeper 
to whisk up something of the sort, and I give such 
recipes as are the least pernicious, and, at the same time, 
the least trouble to follow. Besides, they have been 
found to be very palatable : 

Cream Puffs. —One cupful of sour cream, one cupful 
of sweet milk, two eggs, a little salt, and enough of sifted 
flour for a smootli, but not stiff batter. Beat all thor- 
oughly together for five minutes, and add half a teaspoon- 
f ul of soda dissolved in a little water. Stir again briskly. 
Have the oven and the gem-irons at a lively heat. Drop 
the batter into the buttered irons and bake until the 
puffs are delicately browned. Shp them from the irons 
upon a warm plate and cover with a napkin. 

Graham Puff's. — Beat one quart of sweet milk and 
one quart of sifted Graham flour together for ten min- 
utes. (An egg-whisk is excellent to use in this case, as 
the perfection of the puffs depends upon the thorough 
whipping of the batter and the proper heat of the oven.) 
Add two beaten eggs and a teaspoonful of salt. Bake 
the same as Cream Puffs. Half these quantities can be 
used for a family of three or four persons. 

WJieat or Corn Muffins. — Mix into one quart of wheat 
flour, or one pint of corn-meal, two beaten eggs, a little 
salt, and enough of rich sweet milk to make a thick bat- 
ter. Add a teaspoonful of Royal Baking Powder, beat 
well together, and bake in buttered muffin nngs, or a 
muffin pan, in a brisk oven. When done, cover them 
for a few minutes with a light cloth, then slip them from 
the rings or pan and send to the table on a warm plate 
with a napkin over them. 

Baked Corn Grits. — Stir a cupful of hominy or grits 
into a quart of boiling salted water, and cook for twenty 
6 



122 FARM HOMES, IN-DOORS AND OUT-DOOES. 

minutes. When cool, add two eggs and beat it thor- 
oughly. Bake it in a shallow, well-buttered pan for 
twenty minutes, and cut into squares for the table. 

Pioneer Johnny-Cake, — Over two cupfuls of sifted corn- 
meal sprinkle a teaspoonful of salt and two teaspoonfuls 
of sugar, and add boiling water — be sure that it is boil- 
ing — until a thick batter is formed. Place a thick- 
bottomed frying-pan or** spider" upon the stove, well 
rubbed with a piece of salt pork or suet. Pour in the 
batter, place a tin cover over, and let it bake slowly for 
twenty minutes, when turn it with a broad-bladed knife 
and bake for ten minutes more. 

Green-Corn Cakes. — Two cupfuls of grated sweet-corn, 
half a teaspoonful of salt, two beaten e^gs, one cupful of 
new milk, a large teaspoonful of Eoyal Baking Powder, 
flour enough for a thin batter. Beat all thoroughly to- 
gether and pour into gem-irons to bake. Or it may be 
baked in a tm and cut into squares. 

Corn Starch Crackers, — Three cupfuls of flour, one cup- 
ful of corn starch, half a teaspoonful of salt, and one tea- 
spoonful of baking powder. Sift all together m a pan, 
and rub in one teaspoonful of riice lard. Then add a 
sufficient quantity of sweet milk to form a dough. 
Knead it for a few minutes and let it stand covered with 
a cloth for a quarter of an hour ; ten minutes will an- 
swer in summer. Then roll the dough out \'ery thin, cut 
in round cakes, prick them with a fork, lay them on 
buttered tins, brush the tops with a cloth dipped in milk, 
and bake in a brisk oven from eight to ten minutes. 
These crackers are nice, warm or cold, and excellent for 
school lunches and pic-nic occasions. 

Sunday Morning Rolls. — One and a half pint of new 
milk, one cupful of hop yeast, half a teaspoonful of salt, 
and flour enough for forming dough, which must be cov- 
ered and bft to rise over night. In the mornmg add the 



BEST FOODS — METHODS OF PREPARING. 123 

whites of two eggs well beaten, half a cupful of butter, 
and flour enough for kneading. Knead the dough 
briskly for ten minutes, roll it out to the thickness of 
half an inch, cut in four-inch squares, brush the tops 
with sweet milk, and fold them over cornerwise ; place 
them close together in buttered pans and set in a warm 
place to rise until light, when bake in a quick oven. 

Fried Corn Mush. — This is a nice breakfast dish when 
prepared in the following way : Dip cold, firm slices of 
properly cooked mush first in beaten and salted eggs, and 
then in fine bread crumbs or rolled crackers, and fry 
them in a kettle of boiling lard until nicely browned. 
The mush does not absorb the lard, and is much nicer 
than when merely "stewed" in a frying-pan, as it so 
often is. 

Steamed Corn Bread. — This, like most preparations of 
corn-meal, is best eaten in winter, when the system is in 
need of warmth-producing foods. Pour a pint of boil- 
ing milk on half a pint of sifted corn-meal. When cool 
add a teaspoonful of melted butter, two tablespoonfuls 
of syrup, a little salt, and three well-beaten eggs. Stir 
well together and pour into a buttered bowl or granitized 
pan, place it in a steamer and steam it steadily for two 
hours and a half ; then place it in the oven for ten min- 
utes to brown. 

Rice Muffins. — Two cupfuls of cold boiled rice, two 
eggs, a little salt, a tablespoonful of melted butter, one 
cupful of sweet milk, and two cupfuls of flour in which 
is mixed a teaspoonful of baking powder. Beat all thor- 
oughly and bake in a muffin-pan, filling the rings about 
half full. A cupful of sour milk, and half a teaspoonful 
of soda, can be substituted for the sweet milk and baking 
powder, if more convenient, and the batter can be baked 
ni a common tin and cut into squares when served.

OATMEAL. 

*' Next to wheat," says Dr. Nichols, " I rank Oatmeal." 
It is very rich in nutriment, and with the accompani- 
ment of the pure milk and cream which every farmer 
has at hand, it is so nice and palatable it is a wonder it 
is not a familiar form of food in every American farm- 
house. And yet, after many visits to the country, one 
of the good things which I hail with delight on my re- 
turn to the city, is a breakfast saucer of oatmeal mush 
and real cream, surmounted with a slowly-dissolving 
lump of crushed sugar ! 

Far more expensive dishes are heaped upon the tables 
of these good and generous country friends. There is 
no lack of preserves, fruit-cake, rich pies, and the like ; 
but the good, healthful, simple offerings of nature — the 
grains cooked in their ** integrity," the noble army of 
vegetables nicely prepared, the creamy omelettes, the 
best fruits, the perfect bread, the fragrant amber coffee — 
how very queer that one finds these things on twenty ta- 
bles in the city where he finds them on one table in the 
country ! — the place where, with the exception of a very 
few foreign articles, everything necessary for the best and 
most healthful living abounds on every hand. Farm- 
homes should not be subservient, as they often are, par- 
ticularly in the West, to mere wheat and pork raising. 
They should have more fruits, larger varieties of vegeta- 
bles, and more intelligent and healthful methods of pre- 
paring foods. 

One little move in this direction might be a morning 
dish of oatmeal mush (or oat grits, as it might more 
properly be called), with an accompaniment of good, 
rich milk, and a sprinkle of sugar, in place of the almost 
universal " fried pork " with which country people break 
their fast. It is not only palatable and nourishing to 



BEST FOODS — METHODS OF PREPARING. 125 

children and ^^weak persons," but is hearty and full of 
bone and sinew to laboring men. 

Oatmeal, being now used so extensively in this coun- 
try, is much cheaper than it was years ago, and can 
always be obtained, sweet and fresh, in city and town 
markets ; but in small country places, where the demand 
for it from the farming regions around is light, it is apt 
to lie on the dealers' hands so long that it becomes stale 
and bitter, and no doubt disgusts many a country exper- 
nnenter in its merits. The genuine *^ oatmeal "of the 
markets always comes in clear, solid little grains or grits, 
and is sold at about six cents per pound. It swells im- 
mensely when cooked, one cupful of grits making mush 
enough for four or five persons. 

Oatmeal Mush. — Slowly stir a large cupful of grits into 
a little more than a quart of salted boiling water. When 
well mixed, set the dish or kettle containing it into a tin 
or a stew-pan in which there is boiling water. Cover the 
mush and let it cook, without stirring, for twenty min- 
utes. The pan of water prevents all burning or scorch- 
ing, and the grain is cooked without being mashed into a 
starchy compound by frequent stirring. In some weather 
the water evaporates rapidly, and more may be needed 
before the cooking is completed. The mush can be eaten 
warm at breakfast, or it can be poured into a pudding 
mold and eaten as dessert for dinner, with cream and 
sugar. In the latter case, a handful of raisins or nice 
dried currants might be occasionally boiled with the 
grits. Or the pudding might be served with apple mar- 
malade. It is always good, however, when perfectly 
plain. 

RICE. 

There is a good and an indifferent way to cook rice. 
The indifferent way is to throw the rice into boiling 
water, stir it to death as it cooks, and serve it in blue. 



126 FARM HOMES, IN-DOORS AND OUT-DOORS. 

soggy masses that are only rendered palatable by plenty 
of cream and sugar, or some kind of rich pudding sauce. 
The good way is to soak a large cupful of rice in cold 
water for two or three hours — or even over night ; then 
tarn off the water, put the rice into an earthen or granit- 
ized dish ; pour over it a quart of new milk sufficiently 
salted, and set the dish into another containing? boiling: 
water — the same as in cooking oatmeal. Cover it closely, 
and let it cook for an hour without any stirring. When 
served, its superiority to indifferently cooked rice will be 
decidedly apparent. Rice-boilers, which can be used for 
oatmeal, wheat, hominy, and the like, are manufactured 
expressly for cooking grains in this way ; but they are 
quite expensive, and the above method, although not quite 
so ** handy," answers very well. 

FRUITS — FRESH AND PRESERVED. 

" If every one would eat an orange or two every morn- 
ing before breakfast," says a clear-headed doctor, **I 
should soon lose all my patients !" 

Fortunately for the doctor, every one cannot have one 
or two oranges, or even half an orange, before breakfast. 
And particularly in the country are they an expensive 
luxury. 

But there are many substitutes for oranges, which are 
both delicious and plentiful, and if we can add so much 
to our stock of Good Health as this physician intimates, 
by breaking the night's fast with a little fresh fruit, we 
ought not to be slow in adopting such an agreeable pre- 
scription, and providing, as far as possible, a plentiful 
supply. Toward the end of winter, and through the 
spring months, nothing is so grateful and beneficial to 
the system as fruit — not the sweet "preserves," but the 
fresh or nicely canned article ; if these cannot be had, 
use the dried fruits stewed, and just palatably sweetened. 



BEST FOODS — METHODS OF PREPARING. 127 

"The amount of nutriment in the juicy fruits," says 
Dr. Nichols, '^ is not large, but it is excellent in quality ; 
and the juices of grapes, peaches, oranges, pears, straw- 
berries, currants, cherries, raspberries, and cranberries 
have a most benign and purifying effect upon the system." 
The more pulpy fruits, such as apples, bananas, figs, 
dates, plums, etc., are not only very nutritious, but 
exceedingly healthful. '^A dish of stewed prunes or 
apples, or a few figs, eaten daily, is a sure cure for 
constipation. Plums are certainly better than pills ! 
And even when fruit is costly, it is less costly than 
physic. There is no telling the beneficial influence of 
the annual orange crop in mid-winter upon the health 
of the large cities of the world." 

In an article on "Food Cures," Dr. Hall prescribes 
Watermelons for painful and feverish "summer com- 
plaints," and for fevers of all sorts ; the fresh juice of 
Apples for nervous dyspepsia, and the free use of raw, 
ripe, and perfectly sound fruit for both constipation and 
the opposite condition ; for sluggish livers, and for list- 
less appetites. 

So because fruit is so beneficial, as well as delicious, 
every house-keeper should adopt all possible means for 
maintaining a good variety for the table the year round. 
Aside from Good Bread, there is no item in Nature's 
"bill of fare" that will so bounteously reward one's 
labors to obtain it. 

A good variety of Apples — especially of the late-keep- 
ing sorts — with a barrel of Cranberries (that sound, clean, 
brave-keeping fruit, that is such a blessing to spring-time 
tables !) will go far in supplying the family with whole- 
some fruit, and, with a few cans or jugs of peaches, 
pears, plums, and curl-ants, and the different sorts of 
berries — particularly red and black raspberries, which 
keep their flavor so perfectly — the months between Decem- 
ber and the time of fresh fruit will be bountifully bridged 



128 FARM HOMES, IX-DOORS AisD OUT-DOOBS. 

over, and the family can have, every day, a taste of sum- 
mer-time. 

In the country one has every advantage for successfully 
canning fruits. They can be gathered at just the right 
stage of ripeness, and put up while perfectly fresh. And 
if the glass cans, wliich are, of course, nicer than jugs 
and jars, are bought in quantities, the expense is not 
great, considering that with good care they will last for 
years. 

Half- gallon jugs, with wide mouths, can be used for 
tomatoes, currants, blueberries, and, in fact, all the small 
fruits, if sufficient care is taken to seal them up com- 
pletely ; and as they will not break when the hot fruit 
is poured into them, and need no *' parboiling," like 
glass, it is considerably less trouble to use them. The 
corks should be pressed in tightly and melted sealing-wax 
poured plentifully over. 

Most house-keepers, however, will prefer glass. One 
can be sure that it is scrupulously clean. Also, it is a 
pleasure to survey the glistening rows of cans, and observe 
through their transparent sides how beautifully the 
peaches and strawberries are conducting themselves ! 
Jugs, however, might be used for tomatoes, pumpkin, 
Btring-beans, pie-plant, etc., and even if the sealing-wax 
should sometimes prove treacherous, the loss of the con- 
tents would not be so very deplorable. To have half a 
gallon of Antwerp raspberries fermenting over a cellar 
shelf would be another affair ! 

It is not necessary that the canning of fruit should be 
mide an herculean task. Jars and jugs, filled every iron- 
ing and baking-day through the fruit-season, will make 
up a large winter supply without special conflagration in 
the cook-stove, or long hours of woman-roasting. 

Always place glass jars in a pan of water with a board 
beneath them, and let the water come to scalding heat 
before pouring in the hot fruit. Quart cans are generally 



BEST FOODS — METHODS OF PREEARINQ. 129 

the best to use, as if one becomes cracked, it is not so 
great a loss. 

CANNED FEUITS. 

Pears.— Small pears can be put up whole, after being 
pared ; but the fine large ones must be cut in quarters, 
and the cores removed. Scald them in a clean syrup of 
white sugar and water, scalding a few at a time, that 
they may keep their form. When the jars are nearly 
filled, pour the syrup in until quite filled, and put on the 
covers. A few spoonfuls of clear honey poured over 
canned pears, when served, improves their flavor. 

Strawberries. — Place as much loaf or granulated sugar 
in a preserving-kettle as would make the strawberries 
sweet enough for immediate eating (this being the rule 
for all canned fruits), and add water enough to keep it 
from burning as it dissolves. When it boils, pour m the 
berries, and stir them gently two or three times, so that 
all may be evenly scalded. Then pour them into the 
jars and seal. 

Peaches. — Pear and cut them in halves. Take all the 
pits, and boil them in a little water to extract their flavor. 
Strain this water into the preservmg-kettle, and as it 
boils, pour in the peaches, sprmkling over them the 
necessary amount of sugar. When well scalded, and 
poured m the cans, place round white papers, dipped in 
brandy, over the tops, and put on the covers. 

Raspberries, Blackberries, Blueberries, and Currants, 
are all easily canned in their own juices, with a little 
water at the bottom of the kettle, to prevent burning. 

Plums. — These fruits should be canned without being 
pared — scalding them until the skins burst open, in a 
white sugar syrup. 

Apples. — Sometimes early varieties of apples decay faster 
than it is possible to use them. They can be easily stewed 



130 FARM HOMES, IN-DOORS AI^D OUT-DOORS. 

and canned, and are very good and very convenient for 
spring-time use when fresh apples are scarce. 

CHOICE PRESERVES. 

For holiday occasions there are some fruits especially 
delectable in the form of ** preserves," and to have them 
in perfection is an achievement every housewife may be 
proud of. 

If put up in self -sealing cans like the preceding fruits, 
only half a pound of sugar is required ; but if stored in 
jars and bottles, the old rule of * ' pound for pound " is 
necessary in order to prevent fermentation. 

The canned preserves are to be preferred, first, because 
they are best ; the fruit-flavor is not lost in an over- 
whelming sweetness. Secondly, they are less expensive. 

A General Rule. — For four pounds of fruit put two 
pounds of loaf sugar in a nice porcelain kettle or sauce- 
pan, with one pint of fresh, clear water. When it is dis- 
solved, and before it becomes hot, stir into it the beaten 
white of an Qg^, As it boils remove all the scum as fast 
as it rises until it is perfectly clarified. Then put in a 
little at a time of whatever fruit is to be preserved, boil- 
ing it very gently, and not allowing it to be broken. 
Only choice, sound fruit should be used. Have ready 
the glass cans in a pan of water after the usual manner 
of canning. As the first is done, place it carefully in the 
cans, until all is scalded, then pour the syrup in and seal. 

Strawberries should be hardly more than scalded m the 
syrup, while plums, peaches, apricots, and pears can re- 
main in a little longer. I think the preserve is improved 
by "boiling down" the syrup one-third before pouring 
it over the fruit. 

Marmalades — A General Rule. — This preparation of 
fruit IS excellent for eatins^ witli the morning dish of 
oatmeal and cream ; or with milk- toast ; or with rice, 



* 



BEST FOODS— METHODS OF PREPAEHS-G. 131 



sago, and tapioca puddings. And it is healthy and 
toothsome if spread on children's bread in place of butter. 

The fruit for marmalades must be fresh and well 
ripened. Plums and other pulpy fruits must be stewed 
in a little water, and then sifted through a colander. 
Peaches, apples and quinces must be pared and sliced. 
To every pound of pulp allow half a pound of coffee- 
sugar, and set it to boil gradually, that it may not be 
ruined by scorching. From half to three-quarters of an 
hour is usually long enough to boil the marmalade, but 
it is not done until it looks transparent and becomes 
quite firm and thick when cooled in a saucer. 

Apple marmalade is sometimes improved by a little 
ginger-root pounded and .tied m a thin muslin cloth, and 
boiled with it. 

Small bowls are nice for storing marmalades and jellies, 
which can be poured into them while hot, and when 
wanted for the table they come out in good form. 

All marmalades, jellies, and jams should be first cooled 
in the bowls or glasses, and then covered with papers cut 
out to fit, dipped in brandy and placed directly on the 
fruit. Then paper should be placed over the top and 
pasted down at the sides — while mother's little boy or 
girl will be proud to write labels for them. 

Currant Jelly. — Have just-ripe fruit fresh from the 
bushes. It is not necessary to remove it from the stems, 
but look it over carefully. Place about a pint of the 
fruit, afc a time, in a stout cloth, squeeze out the juice, 
and strain it through a flannel bag. Have ready some 
white sugar, measured in pints or quarts, boiling and 
clarified, in the preserving kettle. Then for every pint 
of sugar pour in a pint of the strained juice, and allow it 
to boil until it will drop m a lumpy way from the spoon. 

Twenty minutes is given as a rule, but it often becomes 
jelly in less time. 



132 FAEM HOMES, liT-DOOKS AND OUT-DOORS. 

Grape Jelly. — This is most delicious when made 
from the cultivated sorts. The little Delaware makes 
jelly of beautiful color and rich, aromatic flavor. It is 
made in the same way as currant jelly. Wild grapes 
make a jelly that is excellent for various things m 
cooking. 

Apple and Plum Jelly. — If the fresh fruit can be 
crushed in a press, and the juice carefully strained, the 
jelly will be clearer and finer than when the fruit is 
stewed m order to get the juice. The yellow Crab-apple 
makes a deep amber-colored jelly, and the blue or Dam- 
son plum a rich ruby. 

To Crystalize Cherries y Currants, and Grapes. — Select 
perfect fruits and leave them on their stems. Beat the 
whites of two eggs to a stiff froth, m which dip the fruits 
and lay them on a sieve to drain for a few minutes. Then 
roll them, cluster by cluster, m a dish of pulverized sugar, 
and lay them on white paper m a nearly cooled oven, or 
before a window where a brisk breeze is blowing. When 
dried put them away in a cool, dry closet. They make a 
very pretty and delicious dessert. 

Baked Quinces. — Bake sound, ripe ones until thor- 
oughly done. When cool, remove the skms, roll them in 
granulated sugar, place in a glass dish, and serve with 
sweet cream. 

Baked Pears. — Good pears when ripe are always best 
m their natural state, but when they are hard or of in- 
ferior quality, they can be prepared after the recipe for 
Baked Quinces. 

Steamed Sweet Apples. — These are excellent for supper. 
Pare, quarter, and core them ; place them in an earthen 
dish in a steamer, cover closely, and let them steam un- 
til tender. When cold, sprinkle with a little sugar, and 
pour over them a pint of rich milk. 

Baked Apples. — These are improved by paring, re- 



BEST FOODS — METHODS OF PREPARING. 133 

moving the core without splitting them, filling the cavi- 
ties with sugar, and baking them in. an earthen dish in. 
which is a cupful of water. 

Apple Cream. — Pare and slice six fine pleasantly fla- 
vored apples ; steam them, or stew them in a very little 
water until soft ; add four tablespoonfuls of white sugar 
and the whites of four fresh eggs ; beat together until 
light, and place m a glass or tall fruit dish with cream 
poured around. 

A Pretty Dish of Currants. — Red and white currants 
can be placed in layers m a clear glass fruit-dish ; or by 
placing pieces of pasteboard between, they can be ar- 
ranged m stripes or squares on a flat dish, and the papers 
removed after it is filled. Currant leaves should be 
placed around the edge. A dish of pulverized sugar 
should always be served with currants and berries, that 
each one may sweeten the fruit to his own taste. 

PICKLES AND CATSUPS. 

Spiced Peaches. — For seven pounds of peaches use 
three and a half pounds of good brown sugar, one quart 
of the best vmcgar, two ounces of stick cinnamon, and 
one ounce of whole cloves. Pare the peaches and stick 
three or four cloves m each. Boil the sugar, vinegar, 
and cinnamon for a few minutes, and then put m the 
peaches. AVhen tender, remove them to glass or stone 
jars, boil down the syrup nearly one-half, and pour it over 
the peaches. 

Spiced Currants, Crab- Apples, and Green Tomatoes. — 
These can be made by using the same proportions of 
sugar, \inegar, and spices named m the recipe for Spiced 
Peaches — all being good relishes to eat occasionally with 
meats. 

Tomato Catsup. — Boil one peck of npe tomatoes m a 
preserving kettle until reduced to a pulp. Add one pint 



134 FARM HOMES, lif-DOOES AND OUT-DOORS. 

of good cider vinegar, half a cupful of salt, one cupful of 
sugar, a teaspoonful of Cayenne pepper, a teaspoonful of 
cloves, two of allspice, and three of celery-salt. Boil for 
twenty minutes and then strain and bottle it. The corks 
should be pressed in tightly and the tops covered with 
melted rosin or sealmg-wax. The catsup is improved to 
many tastes by the addition of two or three onions boiled 
with the tomatoes. 

Salted Cucumbers. — If salt is added to water until an 
^g% will float in it, a brine is formed that will keep 
cucumbers for almost any length of time. They can be 
picked from the vines when of nice size, washed, and 
thrown m the brine until the keg or barrel is filled — 
always keeping them well under the brine with some 
suitable weight. 

Cucumber Pichles. — If salted cucumbers are used, 
soak them in frequently changed water for two days. 
Boil together for fifteen minutes two quarts of good vine- 
gar, one ounce of whole pepper, one cupful of brown sugar, 
and a piece of alum as large as a bean. Pour it over the 
cucumbers while hot. When cool, dram off the vinegar, 
scald it and pour it over the pickles once more. In 
twenty-four hours they will be ready for use. 

Chow-chow Pickle. — Chop one peck of green tomatoes 
with four solid little cabbages, six onions, and six green 
bell-peppers. Sprinkle over a cupful of salt and let the 
mixture stand over night m a large earthen pan or por- 
celain kettle. In the morning drain off the juice and 
add to the chop two pounds of brown sugar, one cupful 
of English mustard-seed, and a gallon of vinegar. Boil 
until it is tender and clear, and then put it away in jars 
or wide-mouthed bottles. 

Mixed Pickles. — Cauliflower, string-beans, and tiny 
onions and cucumbers, with a sprinkle of red cherry- 
peppers, can be scalded together, first in salted water and

then in vinegar, and put up in bottles, with a little sweet- 
oil poured in each to cover the tops before the corks are 
put in. 

Pickled Onions. — Remove two or three layers from 
small white onions, and lay them m a strong brme for a 
day or more. Place vinegar on the stove to boil, with one 
or two bell-peppers, or a handful of the^ cherry- peppers. 
Remove the onions from the brme and pour the hot vin- 
egar over them. 

THE VALUE OF MILK AND EGGS. 

Next to Bread and Fruit, in the scale of Best Foods, 
comes Milk in its various forms — in its fresh, foamy new- 
ness, m luscious cream, and in the concentrations of but- 
ter and cheese. In Milk and Eggs, as in Bread, exist 
nearly all the qualities needed for nutrition and growth. 
Authentic tables show that cheese is worth, as nutriment, 
three times as much as the same weight of beef ; that it 
is "precisely the same as beef in its flesh-forming quali- 
ties ; and, what is more, presents itself in a much purer 
form." Milk is not only the food for "babes," giving 
them flesh, and bone, and muscle, and blood, and making 
them, with the help of warmth and fresh air, the fair 
types of purity, health, and beauty, but it is better for 
grown-up children — if they but knew it — than the 
"strong meat " with which they think they must fortify 
themselves, and which costs so much more, both in the 
buying and in the preparation. 

Yet good meats are a requisite. It is well to take 
vegetation now and then, in the concentrated form of a 
fine roast of beef, or leg of mutton ; while a fried brook 
trout, or a broiled white fish, lying in its fringe of Sara- 
toga potatoes and parsley, is never to be passed lightly 
by ! It is only in feeling that meat is the staple, the 
indispensable basis of good living, that one goes wrong.

So many delicious things, not only delicious to the pal- 
ate, but deliciously nourishing to the whole system, can 
be placed upon our dining-room tables without slaughter- 
ing anything ! — ay, and without diving down into the 
unlovely recesses of the Pork Barrel — that **household 
god " of the country which I would like to demolish, 
no, not demolish, but cause to step down several steps 
to its proper place below bread, fruit, milk, eggs, beef, 
mutton, fish, and vegetables ! 

" Pork is a coarse food fit only for coarse people," 
snaps our good Dr. Nichols. But he lives in a large city 
where the antecedents of his pork are unknown, and he 
has unavoidable thoughts about the insidious trichina, a 
touch of measles, or the questionable diet on which so 
much fatness has been achieved. 

A clean pig — and such a thing is possible if the animal 
is given a decent place to live m — fattened on one's own 
corn, and slain and cured by one's own hands, is always 
a good item to have among one's provision stores. But 
even this perfection of pork should form an occasional 
and not an every-day article of food. 

With wheat, corn, oatmeal, milk, fruit, eggs, and veg- 
etables to draw from, country people can live on the finest 
foods that the world affords ; and that, too, without de- 
voting too much time to the art of cooking. Generally, 
the simplest things are the best, and it is just as easy to 
prepare palatable and nourishing food as the reverse. 

OMELETS. 

Cream Omelet. — Mix smoothly with a cupful of sweet 
cream, a tablespoonful of flour, and add five well-beaten 
eggs and a pinch of salt. Have ready an omelet pan or a 
thick-bottomed *' spider," in which place a small lump 
of sweet suet-fat, which is better than butter, because 
less liable to burn. Have the pan hot enough to bake. 



BEST FOODS — METHODS OF PREPARING. 137 

but not to burn the omelet. Pour in the eggs and cream, 
and when the mixture has thickened, but not hardened, 
fold one-half over the other with a broad-bladed knife, 
slip it upon a warm platter, and serve. Omelets should 
not be made until the meal is nearly ready, as they are apt 
to become tough and leathery if kept waiting too long. 

Ham Omelet. — Have ready a cupful of chopped boiled 
ham. Beat together six eggs and six tablespoonfuls of 
milk ; pour half into the pan, and sprinkle over it the 
chopped ham. When the eggs are partly thickened, 
pour In the remaining portion, and set it in the oven to 
brown on the top. Slip it upon a round platter without 
folding, and place a few sprigs of parsley, if they are to 
be had, around the edges. 

Vegetable Omelet. — Chop an onion finely together with 
two crisp heads of lettuce ; season with salt and pepper, 
and stir in six eggs and three tablespoonfuls of cream. 
Bake the same as Cream Omelet. 

Cheese Omelet. — Beat six eggs, half a cupful of grated 
cheese, and six tablespoonfuls of milk together, and bake 
rather slowly. 

Sweet Omelet. — This is a specially good edible for the 
supper table. For each person, take one Q^g, two tea- 
spoonfuls of white sugar, and one teaspoonful of flour. 
Flavor the omelet with either extract of orange, vanilla, 
or nutmeg. Beat the yolks, sugar, and flour together, 
reserving the whites to be added last. Have the omelet- 
pan at proper heat, and well buttered. Beat the whites 
to a froth, stir all lightly and quickly together, and pour 
it into the pan. When nearly done, set the pan carefully 
into the oven to brown. Then slip the omelet upon a 
plate covered with a napkin, spread over it some rasp- 
berry jam, or nice preserved fruit of some sort, fold one 
half over the other, cover with another napkin, and ring 
the tea^bell ! This recipe has a fussy sound, but the 



138 FARM HOMES, IN-DOORS AND OUT-DOORS. 

omelet is made in a very few minutes, and will be pro- 
nounced delicious by all. 

CUSTARDS AN^D PUDDINGS. 

If overdone, all custards are curdled and spoiled. 
They should be smooth and creamy, when eaten, and as 
cold as the ice-chest or cellar can make them. 

Baked Custards. — Mix one and a half pints of new 
milk, one cupful of sweet cream, four well beaten eggs, one 
cupful of white sugar, one teaspoonful of orange, lemon, 
or vanilla extract. Fill the custard-cups, or any small 
tea-cups, two-thirds full. Put them into a bakmg-pan 
containing hot water, and let them remain m the oven 
until the custard is set, remembering that it will continue 
to cook for a minute or two after being removed from 
the oven. If liked, the whites of two eggs can be whisked 
to a froth, flavored, sprinkled with a little sugar, and 
piled on top of the custards when they are partly cooled. 

Boiled Custard. — Put one quart of new milk in a 
sauce-pan over the fire, and when it begins to boil, stir 
in five beaten eggs and four tablespoonfuls of sugar ; stir 
it until it thickens slightly, then remove to a cool place, 
and add whatever flavoring is liked. 

Corn-starch Custard. — While a quart of milk is heat- 
ing, beat two eggs until light, and stir into them four 
tablespoonfuls of sugar, one tablespoonful ol corn-starch, 
and, one tablespoonful of cold milk. Pour this mixture 
gradually into the boiling milk, and let it cook gently, 
stirring it all the while, for five minutes. Flavor with a 
little extract of orange or lemon, and pour it into the 
dish from which it is to be served. 

Cocoanut Custard. — Soak a cupful of dessicated cocoa- 
nut in an equal quantity of new milk for two hours, and 
add it to the materials used in the recipe for Bakod Cus- 
tards. 



BEST FOODS — METHODS OF PREPARI]S"G. 139 

Corn-starch Pudding, — Stir two tablespoonfuls of 
corn-starch, mixed with cold milk, mto three pmts of 
boilmg milk slightly salted. Let it stand where it will 
cook without burning for ten minutes ; then stir in one 
cupful of sugar and the yolks of three eggs, with what- 
ever flavoring is liked ; pour the pudding into a mold, 
or into a large bowl, that has been dipped in cold water, 
and set it m a cool place. When it is wanted for the 
table, turn the pudding into a glass or earthen dish, and 
serve it with a fruit-sauce, or with cream and sugar. 

Tapioca and Sago Puddings, — Tapioca and sago make 
delicious puddings, especially when one has cream and 
fruit to serve with them. They are also easily made, re- 
quiring but little time either in the preparing or the 
baking, and are good whether warm or cold. Stir a cup- 
ful of sago or tapioca that has soaked several hours in 
cold water into a quart of boiling milk. Add two tea- 
spoonfuls of corn-starch mixed with a little milk, three 
beaten eggs, four tablespoonfuls of sugar, and a pinch of 
salt. Stir well, pour it into a buttered dish, and bake it 
twenty minutes. If preferred, the bottom of the dish 
may be first covered with canned apples, peaches, or 
pears ; or a handful of raisms, soaked m warm water, 
may be added. 

Steamed Corn-meal Pudding. — This is very relishable 
with a winter dinner of corned beef and vegetables. Mix 
one quart of sweet milk, two eggs, a cupful of currants, or 
chopped raisins (it is very good, however, without any 
fruit), a small cupful of brown sugar, half a teaspoonful 
of salt, one cupful of wheat flour, enough of com-meal 
to form a thick batter, and two teaspoonfuls of baking 
powder. Pour it in a pudding-dish, and steam steadily 
for three hours. 

Baked Corn- Meal Pudding. — Stir one cupful of com- 
meal into a quart of boiling milk. Set it aside to be-

come partly cooled, and then add two eggs, four table 
spoonfuls of sugar, half a teaspoonful of salt, and either 
cinnamon or ginger, as preferred. Pour it into a buttered 
dish, turn over it half a cupful of cream or rich milk, 
allowing it to remain on top, and let it bake from thirty 
to forty minutes. It should be partly cooled before being 
served. A boilmg-hot pudding or pie is a needless addi- 
tion to human woes. 

Christmas Pudding. — Mix three cupfuls of flour, one 
cupful of milk, one cupful of molasses, one cupful of raisins, 
three tablespoonf uls of finely chopped salt pork, one egg, 
half a teaspoonful of cinnamon, the same of nutmeg, and 
a pinch of cloves ; add, lastly, two teaspoonfuls of baking 
powder, beat thoroughly together, pour it in a pudding 
dish, and let it steam for three hours. 

Sauce for Christmas Pudding. — Make a smooth butter 
gravy, stir into it four tablespoonf uls of good brown sugar, 
and the juice of a lemon, letting it boil until clear. 

Boiled Fruit Pudding. — Mix one cupful of sugar, two 
cupfuls of sweet milk, one egg, a little salt, half a nutmeg, 
two cupfuls of dried currants, chopped raisms, or sliced 
sweet apples, enough of flour for a stiff batter, and two 
teaspoonfuls of baking powder. Pour the batter into a 
buttered pail, or a floured puddmg-cloth, and let it boil 
steadily for three hours in plenty of water. 

Simple Bread Pudding. — Pour a quart of hot milk upon 
a pint of bread-crumbs that have been placed in a but- 
tered dish ; add two eggs, a dust of cinnamon or nutmeg, 
a little fruit, if liked, and bake it twenty minutes. Serve 
with cream and sugar. 

Simple Bread Pudding, No. 2. — Dip slices of stale 
bread into hot water, and lay them m a buttered earthen 
dish. Into each slice, press a few fine raisins and sprinkle 
over a little cinnamon. Beat together two eggs and a 



BEST FOODS — METHODS OF PREPARING. 141 

pint of milk, which pour over the bread, and bake in a 
moderate oven for twenty minutes. 

Rice Pudding, — Make a custard of three cupfuls of new 
milk, the yolks of two eggs, and a tablespoonful of corn 
starch. Into this stir one cupful of boiled rice, four table- 
spoonfuls of sugar, a little salt, and a teaspoonf ul of orange 
or lemon extract. Pour into a pudding dish, and bake 
in a brisk oven fifteen minutes. Have the Qgg whites 
beaten, sweetened, and flavored ; spread them over the 
pudding when it is done, and return it to the oven for 
an instant, until delicately browned. It is to be eaten 
with fruit, or with cream and sugar. 

Roch Rice — A Pretty Holiday Dish. — Boil a large cupful 
of rice in one and a half pints of new milk, with a little 
salt. By keeping it closely covered it will cook evenly, 
and requires no stirring. Add more milk, if it is needed, 
before the rice is done. When it is thoroughly cooked, 
remove the cover, and let it become rather dry ; 
then sweeten it with fine white sugar, flavor it with 
lemon, and pile it in a rough, rock-like shape in a glass 
dish. Beat the whites of three eggs to a stiff froth, add 
a little sugar, a few drops of lemon extract, and a table- 
spoonful of sweet cream. Pour this all over the rice, 
and turn a cupful of cream around the base. 

Rice BinVs-Nest, for Holidays. — Boil rice as in the 
foresfoing recipe, and put a part of it to mold in six or 
eight egg-cups, previously dipped in cold water. When 
cold slip the rice ^' eggs " out into a low round dish, and 
place the remainder of the rice around them to form the 
**nest," laying over it little strips of marmalade for 
** straws." Serve with sweet cream. 

THE BEAUTIES OF CREAM. 

With a little tin cream- whipper, costing but a few cents 
at the hardware stores, and plenty of cream and fresh 
fruit, the most delicious desserts can be made ; and their 



142 FARM HOMES, IIT-DOORS AND OUT-DOORS. 

mtroduction upon farm-house tables, for a Sunday treat, 
or for little anniversary feasts, or company occasions, 
would be what Barry Gray would call ^'a good thing," 
in place of the richer and more unwholesome dishes of 
state-occasions. 

A Fine Charlotte Russe. — Make a large thin sponge- 
cake, taking care to bake it in an even sheet about an inch 
thick. When done and cooled, cut out a piece to fit the 
bottom of a round dish four or five inches deep, and then 
cut regular pieces to fit around the sides. Into this pour 
a cream, prepared as follows : Whip one pint of sweet 
cream, flavored with orange or vanilla, to a stiff froth, 
and add to it the frothed whites of two eggs and a cupful 
of pulverized sugar. Stir all lightly together, pour it 
upon the cake until the dish is filled, and set it into the 
refrigerator, or upon ice with a pan turned over it, until 
the cream is stiffened. 

A Simpler Charlotte Russe. — A simpler dessert of this 
sort is made by laying lady-fingers or squares of sponge- 
cake around the sides of a glass dish, filling it w4th 
whipped cream, and putting it in a cool place to harden. 

Bavarian Cream (Mrs. Henderson). — Set a pint of cream 
upon ice until chilled, then whip it to a stiff froth. Boil 
a pint of rich milk, flavored with extract of vanilla ; re- 
move it from the fire and add half a box of "Cox's Spark- 
ling Gelatine," that has soaked for an hour in a cupful of 
warm water at the back of the stove. When the milk 
is partly cooled, stir in the beaten yolks of four eggs. 
When cold and beginning to thicken, stir in the whipped 
cream lightly, put it in a mold, and set it on ice or in 
some cool place. 

Wliipped Cream with Fruits. — Whipped cream is palat- 
able served with an kind of fresh fruit, turning the cream 
from a mold upon a handsome dish, and surrounding it 
with the fruit. 



BEST FOODS — METHODS OF PREPARI]S^G. 143 

Cream Shells. — Bake nice little s]3onge cakes in gem 
irons until quickly and delicately done. When partly 
cool, open them at the sides, and put in a teaspoonful of 
whipped cream, flavored with orange or vanilla. 

Cream Gravy for Toast and VegetaUes. — For a family 
of six, pour one and a half pints of milk and one cupful of 
cream in a saucepan, with half a teaspoonful of salt. Mix 
a large tablespoonf ul of flour with three of cold milk, and 
stir into it the boiling milk ; when thickened, remove it 
from the fire, and stir in the beaten yolk of an Qgg. This 
is very much liked by children as a *' gravy" for baked 
and boiled potatoes, or when poured over slices of toasted 
bread. It is also a nice dressing for asparagus, green 
peas, and string beans. 

A Substitute for Cream. — When cream is not plenty, 
a very passable substitute can be made by pouring a pint 
of hot milk upon the well-beaten yolks of two eggs, and 
adding a teaspoonful of white sugar. 

PIES. 

There has been a great outcry among food-reformers 
over *^pie." But there are pies and pies ; and the latter 
sort are still worth perpetuating. There is that pie of the 
dark ages, a thin layer of spiced fruit between two sodden, 
greasy layers of ** crust." And there is the pie of the 
skilled cook of to-day, rich, juicy, self-flavored fruits, en- 
closed in a pastry as delicate and tender as congealed 
foam ! Ah ! sad the fafce of such pie, when it finds it- 
self alone with a knife and fork and a " crowned head !" 

One important objection to pie-making, is that it re- 
quires a good deal of time, compared with other prepara- 
tions of food ; and a busy house-keeper had better rely 
on a good variety of puddings and fruit desserts, as a 
general thing, in place of tliese elaborations. But, if pies 
are made, let them be worth while — let them be good 



144 FARM HOMES, IN-DOORS AND OUT-DOORS. 

forms of food, rather than laboriously concocted worri- 
ments to the digestive powers. 

A Good Paste or ^^ Crust, ^^ — Mix four cupfuls of sifted 
flour, one and one-half cupfuls of butter, the yolks of two 
eggs, and a little ice-water, or else water directly from th 
well. Beat the yolks, add a little cold water to them, 
and mix slowly with the flour until a smooth, firm dough 
is formed. Eoll it out, taking pains to keep it in square 
shape. Have the butter as hard and firm as possible, and 
divide it into three equal parts. Spread one part over 
one half the paste, fold the other half over, and roll out to 
the same size as before ; lay on the second portion of but- 
ter, fold and roll ; then use the remaming butter in the 
same way. Have the fruit in readiness, and the oven at 
a brisk, but not scorching heat. Work rapidly and handle 
the dough as little as possible, setting a part of it near 
the ice until it is wanted. The secret of tender and 
** fluffy" paste is to have it as cold as possible, and the 
oven briskly hot when the pie is put in to bake. The 
best of butter should be used for this purpose. Poor 
butter cannot be used successfully in any branch of 
cookery. 

Another Paste. — If it is warm weather, and one has no 
ice, this paste can be made. It will be found light and 
tender. First prepare the fruit, and have the oven heated. 
Mix a large teaspoonful of Royal Baking Powder in three 
pints of sifted flour. Into this rub one cupful of butter, 
and add enough of cold sweet milk to form the dough. 
Put it on the plates with as little handling as possible. 
If the fruit is very juicy, sprinkle a little flour over the 
bottom-crust before the fruit is put in, to prevent it be- 
coming soaked and sodden. 

Apple Pie, No. 1. — Slice nice tart apples, and make the 
•pies with upper and under-crusts, merely putting a table- 
spoonful of water in each. When baked, remove the top- 



BEST FOODS — METHODS OF PREPARIKG. 145 

orust, sprinkle over the apples half a cupful of sugar, a 
few bits of butter, and, if liked, a dust of cinnamon. 
Replace the crust, cover with a napkin, and serve, when 
partly cooled, with a white cream over each piece. 

Apple Pie, No. 2. — Stew about a dozen pippins, or green- 
ings, in a very Uttle water. When soft, stir in a cupful 
of sugar, and a teaspoonful of butter. Prepare two 
pie-plates with an under-crust and rimmed edges, fill 
them with apples, and bake. 

Custard Pie. — Use deep earthen plates, and line them 
with a rather thick paste. For one pie, beat two eggs 
and three tablespoonfuls of sugar together, add two cof- 
fee cupfuls of rich milk, and grate a little nutmeg over the 
top after it is poured in the paste. Remove it from the 
oven a minute or two before it is quite firm, as it will con- 
tinue to thicken with its own heat, and three minutes 
over-cooking spoils it. 

Cream Pie. — For one pie, use the yolks of two eggs, 
two cupfuls of sweet cream, and two tablespoonfuls of 
sugar, beaten thoroughly together. Bake it in an under- 
crust only. 

Mock-Cream Pie. — Make a quart of corn-starch custard, 
stir into it a tablespoonful of butter, and a little vanilla 
or orange extract, and bake the same as Custard and Cream 
Pie. 

Orange Pie. — Cream half a cupful of butter, with one 
of sugar ; add the yolks of three eggs, and the juice and 
grated rind of a fine orange. Just before filling the paste, 
stir in the egg-whites beaten to a froth. 

Lemon Pie. — Mix a tablespoonful of corn-starch 
smoothly with a little cold water, and pour into half a 
pint of boiling water, stirring it to prevent burning. Add 
a bit of nice butter, and a cupful of sugar. Remove from 
the fire, and when it is partly cooled stir into it a beaten 
Qg^, and the juice and rind of a lemon. Bake the same 

^ 7 



146 FARM HOMES, IN-DOORS AND OUT-DOORS. 

as Custard and Cream Pie. Some cooks whisk and flavor 
the whites of three eggs, and spread them on the top when 
the pie is done, letting it remain in the oven a moment 
to brown. 

Rhuharl) Pie. — Have deep plates for this pie, and 
sprinkle the under-crust with a little flour before filling 
with fruit. Peel and cut the stalks into small bits, and 
fill the plates, first with a layer of fruit and then a layer 
of sugar, until they are well heaped up in the center. 
Sprinkle more flour over the top, and pinch -the top crust 
well down over the edges, as the charm of this pie, aside 
from plenty of sugar, consists in its retainment of all its 
juice. 

Pumphin Pie. — This, like the celebrated little girl in 
the rhyme, can be "very good, indeed," or it can be 
" horrid." When I want to make the richest, creamiest, 
and altogether loveliest pumpkin pies, I use squash. But 
as squash pies are never celebrated in rhyme, or made to 
figure in country romances, I permit them to be called 
Pumpkin Pies. One can be sure of sweet fine-grained 
squashes always ; while, on the other hand, even the best- 
intentioned pumpkins will sometimes prove stringy and 
flavorless. • 

Stew the squash in just enough water to prevent burn- 
ing, and pass it through a colander. For each pie, beat 
together one egg^ three tablespoonf uls of sweet cream, four 
tablespoonfuls of squash, half a cupful of light-brown 
sugar, a coffee-cupful of new milk, half a teaspoonful of 
mixed ginger and cinnamon, and a dust of nutmeg. 

Have rather deep plates, lined with good, tender, but 
not too rich paste. Fill them to the depth of an inch, or 
a little more, and bake in a rather moderate oven until 
slightly browned. 

If pumpkin is used, I would advise another egg to each 
pie, and less pumpkin. 



BEST FOODS — METHODS OF PREPARING. 147 

Mince Pie. — Even a mince pie can be made that will 
not bring to one's slumbers painful visions of great grand- 
mothers. Suet, and citron, and brandy, are all abomina- 
tions, and really add nothing to the good flavor of the pie. 

For one quart of finely chopped beef, use three quarts 
of finely chopped tart apples, two cupfuls of raisins, cut 
in halves, one cupful of currants, washed and dried, two 
teaspoonfuls of ground cinnamon, one teaspoonful of nut- 
meg, and a scant teaspoonful of cloves. If the meat was 
not salted when boiled, add one teaspoonful of salt. 
Place the chop in a preserving-kettle, or large earthen 
pan, upon the stove, and mix v ith it two cupfuls of good 
syrup, one cupful of either boiled cider, or currant or grape 
jelly, one cupful of brown sugar, and enough of water in 
which the beef was boiled to make the mixture sufficiently 
juicy. Let it scald up together, and it will be ready for 
filling the pies. Pastry recipe. No. 2, will be good to use 
on this occasion. 

Hasty Pie. — For a good and easily prepared dessert, 
place any kind cf fresh or canned fruit in the bottom of 
an earthen dish, to the depth of two inches. Beat to- 
getlier one q^^, two tablespoonfuls of melted butter, a 
small cupful of sweet milk, a cupful of flour, and a tea- 
spoonful of baking powder. Pour or spread this evenly 
over the fruit (which, to hasten matters, may set on the 
stove while the batter is being prepared), and bake until 
the crust is well done. It may be eaten with a pudding- 
sauce, or with milk and sugar. 

CAKE. 

Sponge Cake. — It is no easy matter to make perfect 
sponge cake, but on holidays or company occasions it is 
worth while to make it. It is not only delicious, but it 
is entirely wholesome, something which can not be said 
of all cake. Beat the whites and yolks of ten eggs sep- 



148 FARM HOMES, IN-DOORS AKD OUT-DOOSS. 

arately for half an hour [the cook must have an assistant 
in this part of the formula], one and a half cupful of 
fine pulverized white sugar to be mixed with the j^olks. 
Beat the yolks and whites lightly together, and stir in 
another cupful and a half of sugar, two and a half cup- 
f uls of sifted flour, and the grated rind and half the juice 
of a good-sized lemon. Have ready a smooth, deep bis- 
cuit-pan, lined with white, buttered paper, and the oven 
moderately hot. Pour in the batter, and, if possible, do 
not move it after placing it in the oven until it is done. 
The heat may be increased after the first ten minutes. 
When removed from the oven, spread over it a thin icing 
flavored with a little extract of lemon. 

Orange Cake. — Mix two cupfuls of sugar, two cupfuls 
of flour, one-half cupful of water, the yolks of five eggs, 
and the whites of three, a little salt, the juice and grated 
rind of an orange, and a teaspoonful of baking powder. 
Beat all thoroughly together, with the exception of the 
flour and baking powder, which add lastly. Bake this 
in four jelly-tins, and spread between the cakes an icing 
made of the whites of two eggs, the grated rind and a 
little juice of an orange, and enough of powdered white 
sugar to make it rather stiff. 

Roll Jelly Cake. — This can be made and baked in a few 
minutes, and is sometimes eaten warm, with a pudding 
sauce, as a dessert for dinner. Beat four eggs with a 
teacupful of white sugar, a scant tcacupful of sifted 
flour, a teaspoonful of vanilla or orange extract, and a 
teaspoonful of baking powder. Bake it in a thin, even 
sheet in a quick oven ; turn it out, bottom side up, on a 
napkin ; spread it with thick grape or currant jelly, and 
roll it, beginning at the end. 

Corn-starch Cake. — This is very nice if not eaten later 
than twenty-four hours after it is baked. Cream one 
cupful of powdered white sugar, with half a cupful of 



BEST FOODS — METHODS OE PREPARING. 149 

butter, and stir into it half a cupful of sweet milk and 
two-thirds of a cupful of corn-starch. Then add the well- 
beaten whites of five eggs, a teaspoonf ul of extract of 
rose, and a cupful of flour in which is mixed a large tea- 
spoonful of baking powder. Bake rather gradually in a 
paper-lined cake-tin. A thin icing, flavored with a few 
drops of rose, may be spread on top. This delicate, snow- 
white cake looks nicely along with contrasting squares of 
golden sponge oake. 

Lady Fingers, — Mix eight tablespoonfuls of powdered 
white sugar, four eggs — the yolks and whites beaten 
separately — six tablespoonfuls of flour, a little salt, and 
a teaspoonful of lemon, orange, or vanilla. Beat the 
batter for ten minutes ; roll some rather stiff paper into 
a tunnel, and pour the batter through it upon buttered 
pans in long, slender little cakes. Dust a little sugar 
over them, and bake as quickly as possible without 
scorching. 

Alum Gingerhread. — Put a bit of alum the size of a 
walnut in a cake-bowl, and pour upon it a cupful of boil- 
ing water. When nearly cool, add half a cupful of but- 
ter, two cupfuls of syrup, a tablcspoonful of ginger, a 
large teaspoonful of so^a, and enough flour for rolling. 

Flai7i Gingerbread. — Mix one cupful of molasses, one 
of boiling water, a tablcspoonful of butter, two teaspoon- 
fuls of ginger, two cupfuls of flour, and a teaspoonful of 
Boda. Pour the batter in a thick tin, and bake slowly. 

Bread Cake. — Mix three cupfuls of light and sweet 
bread-sponge, one small cupful of butter, two cupfuls of 
light brown sugar, two eggs, one cupful of chopped rais- 
ins, a teaspoonful of nutmeg and cinnamon, and a coffee- 
cupful of flour, to which is added a large teaspoonful of 
baking powder. Let it stand near the stove for a quar- 
ter of an hour before placing it in the oven, and let it 
bake rather slowly. 



150 FARM HOMES, IN-DOORS AND OUT-DOORS. 

Tea Cakes.— ^^^t three eggs with half a cupful of 
sweet cream, a pinch of salt, and half a teaspoonful of 
cinnamon. Add a teaspoonful of baking powder, and 
flour enough to roll out easily in a very thin sheet ; cut 
in squares, fry in boiling lard, and sprinkle over a little 
fine, white sugar. 

Doughnuts — These will not absorb fat. They are 
made with two eggs, a scant cupful of sugar, a coffee- 
cupful of sweet milk, a little salt, half a nutmeg, two 
teaspoonfuls of baking powder, and just flour enough to 
roll out ; avoid a stiff dough. Fry in boiling lard, in 
twists or rings. 

Cream Cake. — Set upon the stove a saucepan contain- 
ing a cupful of cream and a cupful of milk ; when the 
milk boils, stir into it three teaspoonfuls of flour, mixed 
with the yolk of an egg, a teaspoonful of orange extract, 
a pinch of salt, and a little cold milk. Stir the milk un- 
til the flour is well cooked, and set it aside to cool. Make 
a batter after the recipe for Corn-starch Cake ; bake it 
in four or five jelly-tins, and spread the above cream be- 
tween. 

Christmas Cookies. — Mix one cupful of white sugar 
and half a cupful of butter creamed together ; one cupful 
of sweet milk, one tedfepoonful extract of rose, and one 
teaspoonful of baking powder. When flour is added, and 
the dough rolled out in a thin sheet, sprinkle all over it 
some granulated sugar (a flour-dredge should be used) ; 
cut out the cookies, and bake them without browning. 
If the sugar is properly coarse, they will sparkle like 
frost-work. 

HOME-MADE CANDIES, ETC. 

Cream Candy. — Place a large cupful of white sugar in 
a porcelain or granitized kettle, with three tablespoonfuls 
of water, and let it dissolve at the back of the stove ; then 



BEST FOODS — METHODS OF PREPARING. 151 

set it forward, and let it boil until it will crisp in water. 
Stir in a teaspoonful of rose or vanilla extract, and half a 
teaspoonful of cream- of -tartar. Pour it into a buttered 
pan or platter, and when cool, work it until it is per- 
fectly white ; cut it in little squares, and set it away to 
dry. 

Horehound Candy. — Dissolve one pound of white sugar 
in half a pint of water, and boil until it threads or crisps. 
Flavor it with extract of horehound, pour it into buttered 
pans, and finish like Cream Candy. 

Molasses Candy. — Mix one pint of molasses, a small 
cupful of white sugar, a tablespoonful of vinegar, and a 
lump of butter the size of a walnut. If flavored with 
ginger or horehound, it is good for children's coughs. 
Boil, and finish the same as the above. 

Peppermint Drops. — A cupful of white sugar and two 
tablespoonfuls of water should be boiled briskly, stirring 
it all the while, until it is nearly ready to grain, when 
add a small teaspoonful of essence of peppermint ; boil a 
moment longer, and drop it in littb pats on buttered 
white paper. 

CrystaUzed Pop-corn and Nuts. — Boil one cupful of 
white sugar with three tablespoonfuls of water, and one of 
butter, until it shows threads when dropped from the 
spoon. Then pour in three quarts of freshly- made pop- 
corn ; stir until the sugar is thoroughly distributed, 
and then set it away to cool. Nut-meats can be used in 
place of pop-corn, and will be found delicious. — From 
** Golden Rule." 

Pop-corn Balls. — Grind rather finely two quarts of 
popped corn, and stir it into a boiling syrup made of a 
cupful of white sugar and three tablespoonfuls of water. 
When partly cooled, form into balls, and roll them in 
pulverized sugar.

SOUPS. 

Soup is another form of food rarely seen on farm-house 
tables, partly because of the distance from butchers' 
stalls, and partly because the people have a vague idea 
that it IS *' sloppy " and of no account. Doubtless many 
a farmer would turn away from a bowl of delicious broth, 
but would cheerfully tackle the joint or the fowl that 
made the broth, and gave up the greater part of its best 
qualities to it. 

In boiling meat, the farm-wife often throws out most 
of its nutriment to the pigs or into the slop-drain, and 
triumphantly carries to the dining-room the impover- 
ished joint now despoiled of half its worth. 

Let these people think twice about this matter. 

Various kinds of palatable and nutritious soups can be 
made without any meat whatever, although nearly all 
soups are improved by the addition of a little *^ stock," 
as the water in which fresh meats have been boiled is 
called. Nearly all children like soup, and with good 
bread and fruit it is far healthier for them than fried or 
fat meats, with the too common accompaniments of pie 
and cake. 

Green-corn Soup. — Take about ten fine, tender ears of 
sweet-corn ; grate them, not too closely to the cob, and 
scald up cobs and corn together in a quart of boiling, 
salted water. This secures the milk that otherwise 
would remain in the cobs. After ten minutes, remove 
the cobs, and pour in a quart of new milk ; season with 
Bait and butter and a little pepper, and let it cook gently 
for ten minutes more. 

Pea Soup. — In the morning, put a pint of split peas in 
two quarts of water, and let them stew about four hours, 
or until soft ; then throw in these vegetables, cut iri 
email pieces : Two carrots, two parsnips, half a ruta- 
baga, a small onion, and three potatoes, adding water 



BEST FOODS — METHODS OF PEEPAEIN^G. 153 

enough to make good the quantity that has evaporated 
during the four hours. Let the soup boil for half an 
hour, then strain it through a colander, mashing the 
peas and vegetables through with a spoon. Season it 
with salt and pepper, and add a cupful of sweet cream 
just before carrying it to the table. 

Becm Soup. — Put a pint of beans, with a shin or a 
pound of lean beef, in a kettle with cold water, and let 
them stew gently all the forenoon. An onion can be 
added if it is liked. At noon, remove the meat, mash 
the beans if they are not already pulpy, add enough water 
to make two quarts of soup, season with salt and a little 
pepper, and pour it in a tureen upon slices of toasted 
brown bread. 

Potato Soup. — Thinly slice four or five nice potatoes ; 
pour upon them a pint and a half of boiling water. After 
stewing ten minutes they will be soft. Then add a pint 
of rich milk, salt, pepper, a bit of butter, and two table- 
spoonfuls of rolled crackers. Let it boil up, and serve. 

Vegetable Oyster, or Salsify Soup. — Make the same 
as Potato Soup, and serve with little crackers and mixed 
pickles. 

Tomato Soup, — Peel and slice ten ripe tomatoes; boil 
them three-quarters of an hour ; add three tablespoon- 
fuls of rolled cracker or fine bread crumbs, a bit of soda 
the size of a bean, half a cupful of butter ; salt, pepper, 
and a quart of rich milk. Let it simmer for ten minutes. 

Mutton Broth. — Remove the fat from a quart of water 
in which a leg of mutton or lamb has been boiled, and 
add two cupfuls of clear water, a handful of rice, a stalk 
of celery, and an onion cut in halves. Simmer half an 
hour, remove vegetables, and serve. 

Chicken Soup, — Cut up two chickens, or one good- 
sized fowl, and place in a kettle with a pound of veal 
and three pints of water. Boil gently for two hours. 



154 FARM HOMES, IN-DOOKS AND OUT-DOORS. 

Take the kettle to the kitchen table, and remove the fat 
from the top ; strain the soup through a colander, and 
add to it half a cupful of rice and a little parsley. Let it 
simmer for half an hour, adding water to replace what 
may have boiled away ; season with salt and a little white 
pepper, and just before it is served, pour in a cup/ul of 
sweet cream. The chickens can be used for a salad. 

PalataUe Soup for a Sick Person. — Cut a pound of 
lean beef or mutton in small bits, and put it in a sauce- 
pan with three pints of cold water ; cover it, not too 
closely ; let it come to simmering heat, and remain cook- 
ing until the water is reduced to little more than a pint. 
Toast a slice of bread slowly, until it is browned clear 
through, but not at all burned ; put it in the sauce-pan 
with the meat, and let it remain ten minutes ; then strain 
the soup, and season it with salt and a very little Cayenne 
pepper. 

Veal Soup. — Put one onion, half a cupful of rice 
or pearl barley, and a knuckle of veal, with the bones 
broken, in two quarts of cold water, to simmer slowly 
for two hours and a half. At the end of that time, beat 
the yolks of two eggs in half a pint of cream, with a tea- 
spoonful of salt and a little Cayenne pepper. Pour this 
into the soup ; let it boil up once, then pour it through 
a colander into a tureen, and serve. 

Plain Beef Soup. — This soup requires longer time than 
any other. Six hours or more of gentle simmering (and 
soup-meats should never be boiled in any other way) will 
do it no harm. Put a good beef shin, or three pounds 
off the neck, in a gallon of cold water, and when it comes 
to a boil, set the kettle at the back of the stove where it 
will cook very moderately through the forenoon. About 
forty minutes before it is wanted, add six potatoes, one 
turnip, two carrots, and an onion, cut in small pieces. 
Just before serving, mix two tablespoonf uls of flour very 



BEST EOODS — METHODS OF PREPARIN-G. I55 

smoothly in a little cold water, with a teaspoonful of salt 
and some pepper, and stir it mto the soup, letting it boil 
two or three minutes longer. The meat should be placed 
on a platter, in this instance, and the soup and vegeta- 
bles poured into a tureen. 

Oyster Soup. — Put the oysters, with their own liquor, 
in the soup kettle, with butter, salt, and pepper in pro- 
portion with the quantity of soup to be made. When 
they begin to bubble, pour boiling milk and water over 
them, and let the soup simmer for ten minutes. 

Seasonings for Soups. — The best kind of pepper to use 
for soups, or nearly everything else in which pepper is 
used, is pure Cayenne, which is a tonic in itself ; and 
next to Cayenne, the white pepper, which even a country 
house-keeper can obtain if she will keep it in her mind 
when she does her next town shopping. It is rarely sold 
in country stores. Celery-salt is another excellent item 
to remember ; while parsley, onions, and salsify can be 
kept always at hand. 

SALADS. 

Salads are appetizing, wholesome, and refreshing. Be- 
sides, they cost next to nothing. But are they not almost 
as rare in the country as Bavarian creams and soups ? 

Simple salads can be made by every one. If of vegeta- 
bles, they should always be placed on the table freshly 
made ; and it takes but an extra minute to arrange them 
in pretty form. 

Plain Dressing for Salads. — Beat the yolks of three 
eggs with five tablespoonfuls of good vinegar, a table- 
spoonful of sugar, and a teaspoonful of mixed mustard. 
Add a little salt, a bit of butter, or, if liked, a tablespoon- 
ful of olive oil, and stir all together in a saucepan over 
the fire, until a smooth dressing is formed of the consis- 



loG PARM HOMES, IN-DOORS AND OUT-DOORS. 

tency of cream. This is good with chopped cabbage, 
fresh lettuce, and various kinds of salad. 

French Salad Dressing. — Mix.a saltspoonful of salt with 
one of pepper ; add a teaspoonful of grated onion, three 
tablespoonfuls of olive oil, and two of vinegar. When 
well mixed put in the salad, and stir well together. 

Lettuce Salads. — Choose tender little heads, and lay 
small radishes or nasturtium blossoms around them. 
Plain dressing. 

2. Lettuce and young onions, cut finely, and mixed 
with plain salad dressing will be generally liked. 

3. A pretty salad is made by laying slices of cold boiled 
beets around the edge of a dish, and filling the center 
with fresh lettuce heads. 

4. Another variation is a dish of lettuce, with hard- 
boiled eggs sliced and laid over the top. 

Cabbage Salad , No. 1. — Place a saucepan on the stove 
containing one cupful of good vinegar, half a cupful of 
white sugar, a bit of butter, a teaspoonful of salt, and a 
teaspoonful of mixed mustard. When it boils up, pour 
it over five cupf uls of chopped cabbage. 

Cabbage Salad , No. 2. — Mix chopped cabbage, lettuce, 
pepper-grass, and a small onion together, sprinkle with 
sugar and salt, place in a broad bowl or salad-dish, lay 
sliced eggs on the top, and pour over a cupful of vinegar. 

Raw cabbage, chopped fine and agreeably seasoned, is an 
appetizing and healthful relish ; but when cooked, and 
especially when boiled along with fat meats, it is quite the 
reverse, and the human stomach should not often be bur- 
dened with it. 

Potato Salad. — Mix thinly-sliced cold, boiled potatoes 
and young onions, sometimes adding a little chopped 
parsley, and pour over them a French Salad dressing. 

Ham Salad. — Mix cold, boiled ham with liar ^-boiled 



BEST FOODS — METHODS OF PREPARIifG. 157 

eggs, in the proportion of about half and half. Pour over 
it a plain salad dressing, an(i place around the edges fresh 
lettuce or leaves of parsley. 

Sjnnach, No. 1. — Boil the spinach twenty minutes, drain 
off the water and chop finely with a knife. Return the 
kettle or saucepan to the fire, with a little butter and salt, 
and let it remain, without scorching, until it is quite dry. 
Dip a deep dish, a bowl will answer, in cold water, press, 
the spinach into it, and then turn it out upon a plate, and 
place sliced eggs over and around it. 

Spinach, No. 2. — After boiling, chopping, and season- 
ing the spinach, as aljove, remove the saucepan to the 
kitchen- table, and stir into it a dressing made of one 
cupful of cream, yolks of two eggs, a little pepper, and 
half a teaspoonful of mixed mustard. 

Spinach is very good with nearly all kinds of meat, and 
is particularly good with boiled ham and corned beef. 

Chicken Salad. — Cut the meat neatly from two tender 
roasted chickens, and chop with a bunch of celery and 
some sprigs of .parsley. Sprinkle over salt, a little white 
or Cayenne pepper, and half a cupful of vinegar and oil. 
Let this stand two or three hours, then place it on a plate 
or salad dish in the midst of fresh lettuce or parsley leaves, 
and pour over it a salad-dressing, 

FISH. 

BaTced Fish. — A good-sized fish of any sort is especially 
fine when baked. Cut the fish open from head to tail ; 
clean and wipe it dry ; fill it with a stuffing made of chop- 
ped bread, seasoned with butter, pepper, salt, and two tea- 
spoonfuls of powdered sage ; wind it with twine ; lay it 
in a baking-pan on a grate or tin, to keep it from touch- 
ing the water, and pour salted water into the pan with 
which to baste it. The ove.n must be hot enough at first 
to crisp the fish ; afterward it may bake more moderately 



158 FARM HOMES, IN-DOORS AND OUT-DOORS. 

from half to three-quarters of an hour, according to the 
size. Serve it with a butter-gravy, to which is sometimes 
added two tablespoonfuls of chopped boiled eggs. 

Boiled Fish. — If one lives in the vicinity of the sea, 
lakes, or streams, where fine fish abound, a *' fish-kettle" 
should be added to one's kitchen supplies. They are of 
oval shape, and have stramers fitting the mside, in which 
a fish can be boiled or fried (immersed in boiling lard) 
without being broken in the least. A passable subst^Ai te, 
in boiling fish, is to lay it in a circle upon a plate, and 
tie the plate in a napkin, by which it can be lifted out 
without breaking the fish. 

Fresh- water fish are improved by being soaked for a 
while in cold salted water, and being boiled with a bag 
containing sliced carrots, an onion, a little celery, and some 
cloves and peppers. Some cooks add half a cupful of 
vinegar to the water. 

Fried Fish. — Wipe the fish, brush it over with the 
white of an egg, roll it in grated crackers, corn-meal, 
or fine bread-crumbs, and lay it in a kettle of boiling lard. 
The lard must be hot enough to immediately crisp the 
fish, and deep enough to float it. None of the fat will 
be absorbed, and the fish will come out beautifully browned, 
and well done in every way. If care is taken not to scorch 
the lard, it can be used for several fish-days. This man- 
ner of cooking is far superior to the commoner frying- 
pan method. 

Broiled Fish. — A double wire broiler is best for fish, 
as it can be turned without disturbing it. A large fish 
should be split, or have gashes cut across its sides. 
The coals should be clear and hot, and the broiler turned 
in time to prevent all burning. (The fish may first be 
rubbed inside with salt, and sprinkled with a little lemon- 
juice). Have a warm platter ready, with a bit of butter, 
and some salt and pepper in the bottom of it. As soon 



BEST FOODS — METHODS OF PREPARING. 159 

as the fish is done, lay it upon the platter, sprinkle over 
it some salt, and a few bits of butter, and set in the oven 
until the butter is melted. 

Boiled Fresh Cod. — Cut it in slices, and boil it in salted 
water, in which is a cupful of vinegar, and half a cupful 
of grated horse-radish. Serve with drawn butter, or with 
an oyster sauce. 

Codfish Calces. — Mix one cupful of boiled and mashed 
salt codfish with three cupfuls of mashed potatoes, a small 
chopped onion, the yolks of two eggs, and a large table- 
spoonful of flour. Form into small cakes, and brown 
them on a griddle, or drop them into boiling lard. 

Codfish arid Cream. — Pick the codfish into small feathery 
bits, removing all particles of bone, and let it soak in cold 
water for two hours. If for breakfast, it can stand all 
night. Drain off the water, pour over the fish a pint and 
a half of new milk, and set the saucepan at the back of the 
stove, where it may slowly arrive to simmering heat. After 
it has gently cooked for ten minutes, add to it a table- 
spoonful of flour mixed smoothly in half a cupful of sweet 
cream, and let it boil up for a moment. Then remove it 
from the stove, stir into it the beaten yolks of two eggs, 
and it is ready to dish. 

Broiled Salt Cod. — Soak nice white strips of the fish 
for several hours, in cold water, dry them with a cloth, 
and lay them over clear hot coals on a broiler that has 
been rubbed with suet. Brown the fish nicely on both 
sides, remove it to a warm platter, and lay upon each piece 
a little fresh butter. A fringe'of fried potatoes is a good 
accompan iment. 

Scalloped Oysters. — Put two quarts of oysters in a col- 
ander to drain. Roll a dozen crackers fine, or grate half 
a loaf of stale bread. Butter a deep earthen dish, and 
fill it with alternate layers of oysters and crumbs, season- 
ing the oysters with salt, pepper, and butter, and leaving 



160 FARM HOMES, IN-DOORS AND OUT-DOOES. 

bread crumbs on top. Pour over the oyeter liquor, and 
half a cupful of cream or new milk. Bake half an hour. 

Fried Oysters. — Sprinkle pepper and salt over two 
dozen large oysters, and set them in a cool place for 
twenty minutes. Have ready beaten eggs, rolled crackers, 
and a kettle of boihng lard. Roll the oysters first in 
crumbs, then in the egg, then in crumbs again [this 
makes an adhesive coating], and drop them into the boil- 
ing lard. When well browned, lemove them with a 
skimmer, letting them drain a moment, and carry them 
to the table on a warm platter. 

Roasted Canned Oysters. — These are very "comfort- 
ing," in winter, after a long sleigh-ride, or on coming 
home chilled — and, as a general thing, hungry — from a 
concert or lecture. They can be cooked on the dining- 
room coals, and a plate of crackers and a pint of bottled 
cider, gently warmed before the fire, form an accompani- 
ment that gives no one any trouble. 

Make an opening in the end of the can, put in salt and 
pepper, bend the tin back into place, and set the can upon 
the coals. When it has bubbled over for two or three 
minutes, the oysters are done, and can be emptied out 
upon a hot platter, and have a little lemon juice sprinkled 
over them. If well roasted, they will be found delicious. 

Steiued Oysters, — Have ready a quart of boiling milk. 
Scald one quart of oysters in their own liquor, skim them, 
season wuth salt, pepper, and butter, put them in a tureen, 
and pour milk over. 

A FEW GOOD SAUCES FOR FISH AND MEATS. 

Horse Radish Sauce, for Roast Beef and Beefsteahs.-^ 
Mix half a cupful of grated horse-radish, the same oi 
grated cracker, one cupful of cream, and a little salt and 
pepper. Simmer together for twelve minutes. 



BEST FOObS — METHODS OF PREPARING. 161 

Sauce for Broiled Meats and Fish. — Mix together a little 
chopped parsley, the juice of half a lemon, three table- 
spoonfuls of butter, and some pepper and salt. Pour it 
over steaks while they are hot, and place in the oven for 
a moment. 

Mint Sauce for Roast Lamb. — Put one cupful of vine- 
gar, two tablespoonfuls of sugar, and four of chopped 
mint in the gravy-boat, and let it stand two hours before 
it is used. 

Oyster Sauce for Roast Turkey. — Boil up two dozen 
small oysters m a pint of drawn butter. 

Drawn Butter. — Put two tablespoonfuls of butter in a 
saucepan, and when it has melted, sprinkle in a table- 
spoonful of flour, and stir it, without browning, until it 
is well cooked ; then slowly add boiling water until it is 
of the right consistency. Pour it through a gravy- 
strainer, and add a little salt and another tablespoonful 
of butter. This is the basis for a variety of sauces, and 
should always be made with care. Scorched or lumpy 
drawn butter may not materially shorten life, but it is an 
evidence of either carelessness or ignorance, or of ** too 
many irons in the fire " on the part of the cook. 

Boiled Egg Sau^e for Baked and Boiled Fish. — Add to 
half a pint of drawn butter, three hard-boiled eggs cut in 
small pieces. 

Parsley Sauce for Boiled Fish or Fowl. — Add two 
tablespoonfuls of chopped parsley to half a pint of hot 
drawn butter. 

Holland Sauce for Boiled Fish, Cabbage, Asparagus, 
and Cauliflower. — Stir into half a pint of hot drawn but- 
ter, the beaten yolks of three eggs, and a Httle lemon- juice 
and Cayenne pepper. 

Brown Sauce for Cutlets, Steaks, and Potted Meats. — 
Put a small chopped onion and a tablespoonful of butter 
in a saucepan over the fire. Brown, but do not scorch

it ; stir in a tablespoonful of flour, and then add a pint 
of stock. Let it boil for three minutes, and then strain 
it into the gravy-boat. 

Roast Beef Gravy. — When a sauce or gravy is made 
from the drippings of a roast of beef, be careful to re- 
move all the fat, thicken, not too thick, with a little flour 
mixed smoothly with cold water, and pour it through a 
gravy strainer. 

Tomato Sauce for Mutton Chops. — Mix half a can of 
tomatoes, a little Cayenne pepper, a sliced onion, and some 
salt. Stew slowly for half an hour ; strain, and add one 
tablespoonful of butter and two of vinegar. 

Cold Sauce for Cold Roast Beef. — Mix one tablespoon- 
ful of gi'ated horse-radish, one of sugar, two of vinegar, 
and four of sweet cream. This is sometimes relished 
with hot steaks. 

Currant Jelly Sauce for Roast Venison. — Mix half 
a lemon peel, one tablespoonful of sugar, a teaspoon- 
f ul of cinnamon, and a few cloves, six or eight, pounded 
together, and a cupful of water. Simmer for half an hour, 
and add a glassful of currant jelly. When the latter is 
melted, strain the sauce into a gravy-boat or bowl. 

BEEF, MUTTON, FOWLS, ETC. 

Roasting is the best method of cooking nearly all 
meats, but as very few country kitchens have conveni- 
ences for roasting, the next best method is baking, and 
when the meat is well basted, and removed from the oven 
at the right time, it is almost as good as when roasted. 
Twelve minutes to the pound is a very good rule for bak- 
ing beef. 

Roast Beef. — If it is a rib-roast, remove the bones so 
that it can be rolled compactly together, and kept so by 
a piece of twine. Dredgs the meat all over with flour m

which salt and pepper has been mixed ; place it in the 
dripping pan, raised from the bottom by a grate or tin, 
and put it m a brisk oven. After a quarter of an hour, 
or when the meat is crisped on all sides, pour a pint of 
salted water in the pan, and baste it often. 

Corned Beef. — Allow half an hour to each pound of 
beef. Boil it very gently, the cooking process is not at 
all hastened by a furious fire, and if it is to be eaten 
cold, set it off, and let it remain in the water until partly 
cooled ; then place it in an earthen dish, lay a plate over 
it, and press it with a three-pound weight. 

Stuffed Beefsteak. — Even the toughest beef becomes 
good when served m this way : Take a round steak, and 
spread it an inch thick with a stuffing made of chopped 
bread and butter, seasoned with salt, pepper, and sage. 
A little onion may be added, if liked. Roll the steak up, 
tie it with twine, lay it in a pan with a few thin slices of 
salt pork on top, pour around it a pint of water, cover 
closely, and bake it in a moderate oven for three hours. 

Roast Larrib. — Rub it with salt and pepper ; place it 
in a brisk oven, and baste it frequently until it is done. 
Ten minutes to each pound is about the time required. 

Potted Beef. — Put the beef m a kettle, with some lit- 
tle slices of salt pork at the bottom ; sprinkle with salt 
and a little Cayenne paper, pour over two tablespoonfuls 
of vinegar, and set the kettle over the fire, covering it 
closely. When it has fried a little at the bottom, turn 
the meat, and in ten minutes add half a pint of water. 
Do not let the meat boil dry, but add a little water occa- 
sionally, letting it cook slowly, and keeping it closely 
covered. 

Roast Porh. — Allow twenty minutes in the oven to 
every pound of pork. A stuffing made of bread and bat- 
ter, and seasoned with salt, pepper, and sweet herbs, is 



164 FARM HOMES, Il^^-DOORS Al^D OUT-DOORS. 

an improvement to all pork roasts, and apple sauce and 
cabbage salad should be served with them. 

Good form for Cold Meats. — Remnants of boils and 
roasts are very good if chopped with twice their quantity 
of bread, seasoned with salt, pepper, and herbs, moist- 
ened with eggs and a little melted butter, and either 
baked in a loaf, or in small cakes on a griddle. 

Boiled Ham. — A neat and relishable dish for a com- 
pany tea is a platter of nicely sliced boiled ham, with the 
fat mostly trimmed off, and a slice of lemon placed on 
each slice of meat. 

Dried Beef and Cream. — This is a delicious breakfast 
or supper dish. Put thin shavings of dried beef m a 
saucepan, with a pint of cold water, and let it slowly come 
to simmering heat and cook for ten minutes ; then drain 
away the water and add a small lump of fresh butter ; 
when it is bubbling hot, and fries a little, pour in one 
cupful of milk and one cupful of cream. When it has 
simmered awhile m the milk, add two teaspoonfuls of 
flour, mixed with a little cold milk, and let it boil up for 
a moment, after which remove it from the stove. Stir in 
the yolk of an egg, and pour it into a warmed tureen. 

Boiled Leg of Mutton. — Wash the leg and put it into 
a kettle containing enough- boiling water to cover it, and 
let it simmer gently without stopping for two hours and 
a quarter — if of large size. At the end of the first hour 
throw in a tablespoonful of salt. Let the mutton remain 
in the water, after it is removed from the stove, until 
nearly cold — in this way it takes back some of its juices ; 
then drain and dry it with a cloth, and set it in a cool 
place. Tomato sauce should accompany it to the table. 

Salt Pork, No. 1. — Cut the pork in thin slices and let 
them soak in cold water for an hour or two ; drain, broil 
them in a frying-pan until slightly crisp, and place them 
in a tureen. Turn out nearly all the fat in the frying-

pan (it can be used for frying fish), and make a gravy of 
a pint of milk and a tablespoonful of flour, which pour 
over the meat m the tureen. 

Salt PorlCf No. 2. — Boil four or five pounds of pork 
having *' streaks of lean " in it, in plenty of water for an 
hour and a half. Take it out, remove the skin, cut 
gashes across the top, sprinkle over a little powdered sage, 
pepper, and rolled crackers, and set it m the oven until 
browned a little. It is to be eaten cold. 

Roast Turkey. — The perfection of this bird depends 
first upon its age and condition, and next upon its being 
frequently basted and thoroughly cooked. From two 
and a half to three hours should be allowed for a com- 
mon-sized turkey ; a large one requires from three and 
a half to four hours. In cool weather, or if one has a 
refrigerator, the fowl should be prepared for the oven the 
day before it is to be roasted. Fill it with a stuffing 
made of a loaf of soaked white bread, a small cupful of 
chopped salt pork, a minced onion, a tablespoonful of 
powdered summer-savory, a little pepper, and two raw 
eggs. Before placing it in the oven, lay thin slices of salt 
pork on top, baste it with salted water, and sprinkle over 
it flour and pepper. See that its wings and legs are tied 
closely to the body in good shape. Let it rest upon a 
tin or grate, so as not to be stewed in the water that 
must be poured in the baking pan. Baste it half a dozen 
times an hour, at least. It can be served with Oyster 
Sauce, or with a gravy made from the drippings, after 
the turkey is removed from the oven. In the latter case, 
the liver and heart of the fowl should be boiled, chopped 
finely, and added i6 the gravy, after it is strained. Cran- 
berries, stewed in a little water, sweetened, and partly 
frozen in a mold, are good with turkey ; so also is plum 
marmalade. 

Fried Chichens. — Chickens are admirable when, after

being cut up and boiled in salted water for half an hour, 
they are fried in a pan, with a little salt pork, until nicely 
browned, placed in a tureen, and a gravy made of milk 
and cream, and a little flour poured over them. 

Roasted Quails. — Place the birds in a baking-pan, with 
half an inch of boiling water slightly salted. Lay a thin 
slice of bacon or of salt pork over each breast, cover the 
pan closely, and set it m the oven for a quarter of an 
hour to steam and *^ plump" the birds. Then remove 
the cover and bake three-quarters of an hour, basting 
them often. 

Roast Goose. — Do not attempt to roast any but a young 
goose. Make for it a stuffing of bread and butter, sea- 
soned with chopped onions, sage, salt, and pepper, and 
moistened with an egg or two. Like turkey, it must be 
basted often and well cooked. From two to two hours 
and a half is a sufficient time. Apple sauce should ac- 
company roast goose. 

Stewed Pigeons. — Place a bit of salt pork in each, and 
lay them breast upward in a stew-pan along with a carrot, 
an onion, and a little parsley, and pour over enough boil- 
ing water to cover them. Cover closely and let them 
simmer until tender. Place them on pieces of toasted 
bread ; remove the vegetables from the broth, thicken it 
with a little flour and water, adding a little pepper and 
salt, and pour it over the pigeons. 

Pressed Veal. — Boil a loin of veal in as little water as 
possible. When done and cooled, chop it rather finely, 
seasoning it with salt, pepper, and sage, and pour over it 
a pint of the water in which it was boiled. Put it in a 
deep, oval dish, lay a platter on top, and press it with a 
weight. 

Calf^s Liver, — Fry thin slices of salt pork until crisp ; 
lay them upon a platter and keep warm. Dip thin slices 



f

of liver in boiling water, dredge them with flour, and fry 
them in the pork fat, turning them often until done, 
when place on the platter with the pork, and ser^^e with 
a lettuce or spinach salad. This dish is improved for 
some tastes if an onion is sliced and browned with the 
pork. 

Baked Beans vjitli Pork. — Beans are mtich more pal- 
atable and much more nutritious when they are not sat- 
urated with the fat of pork or any other ^* grease." Any 
one who tries this recipe will recognize the superiority of 
the dish to the usual method of preparing it. If the 
beans are more than a year old, let them soak over night 
and scald them in the morning in water containing half 
a teaspoonful of soda. (If they are of the year's harvest, 
twenty minutes gentle parboiling in soda water will an- 
swer.) Then put them mto clear water with a leanish 
piece of salt pork, neatly cleaned of brine, and gashed in 
slices across the top, half way to the bottom. After boil- 
ing slowly for an hour, or a less time if the beans become 
tender, skim them from the water into an earthen dish, 
leaving the meat to continue cooking in the kettle. Pour 
upon them three tablespoonfuls of syrup, a small cupful 
of clear hot water, and sprinkle over them a little Cayenne 
pepper and salt ; if it is a small mess the meat will have 
salted sufficiently. Set them in a moderately hot oven 
to bake from half to three-quarters of an hour. An 
onion sliced over the top and removed when they are 
done, improves the flavor for many. Take the pork from 
the kettle when it is sufficiently cooked, and set it in the 
oven until it is crisped a little. 

Cranberry or Wren's Egg beans are very nice, cooked 
and seasoned in the above way, without any pork, but 
with an addition of plenty of salt, pepper, and an ounce 
of butter.

VEGETABLES. 

It is proverbial that only one cook in a thousand knows 
how to cook a potato. In nine cases out of ten the best 
portion of this vegetable is thrown away m thick parings, 
and in ninety-nine times out of a hundred they are boiled 
instead of steamed. Thus this common viand has slim 
chances, in many kitchens, of reaching the table in its 
perfection. None but old potatoes should be pared at 
all ; and even old potatoes, if they have just a strip taken 
off the longest way around them, to facilitate the process 
of peeling, will prove better for having had their Jackets 
mostly left on. Potatoes buried in earth or powdered 
charcoal never become old, and by using good methods 
of cooking, excellent preparations of this largely eaten 
vegetable may always be had. 

Steamed Potatoes, — Thinly pare and cut in halves as 
many potatoes as are wanted. Lay them in ice-water for 
ten minutes. Have a close-covered steamer ready upon 
a kettle containing plenty of boiling water ; place the 
potatoes in it, and they will, if steadily steamed, be done 
in half an hour. Then set the steamer off to the back of 
the stove and open the cover slightly, that all moisture 
may evaporate. 

When a pudding or a loaf of corn-bread is being steam- 
ed, the potatoes can be put in at their proper time 
around the pudding or bread dish, and so two birds se- 
cured with one stone. 

Boiled Potatoes, — If one prefers to pare the potatoes, let 
the paring be as thin as possible, and put them in a ket- 
tle with enough of cold salted water to cover them. 
When they are done, pour off nearly all the water, set 
the kettle at the back of the stove, keeping it closely 
covered, and let them steam until dry and flaky. 

Potato Snow, — For a handsome dish, and one that is 



BEST FOODS — METHODS OF PREPARIi^^G. 169 

also delicious, press a dozen hot nicely-boiled *' Snow- 
flake " potatoes through a wire sieve into a vegetable dish 
previously warmed, and carry to the table immediately. 
A bowl of hot cream, seasoned with salt and a little white 
pepper, should accompany it. 

Breakfast Potatoes. — Place a pint of new milk, a table- 
spoonful of butter, and half a teaspoonf ul of salt, in a 
saucepan. When it boils stir in a tablespoonful of flour 
mixed with a little cold milk. As it boils up again pour 
in a quart of sliced, cold, boiled potatoes, and set the 
saucepan on the back of the range or stove, where the 
potatoes may be thoroughly warmed without any scorch- 
ing of the milk. 

Baked Potatoes. — The charm of a baked potato con- 
sists in its being served at exactly the right stage of 
" doneness." A few minutes waiting detracts much from 
its good qualities. So something depends upon those 
who come to dinner as well as on those who prepare it. 
Baked potatoes are very comfortable for winter suppers, 
with cream gravy. 

Ruta-haga Turnips. — Pare, slice thinly, and either 
steam them or boil them in salted boiling water. When 
done, drain away the water, dry out the moisture, mash 
finely, and season with plenty of butter, salt, white pep- 
per, and a little white sugar. ' 

Cauliflower. — Have salted boiling water ready ; cut 
away all outer leaves, and put the cauliflower in the ket- 
tle. In a short time it will have cooked enough. Re- 
move it to a vegetable dish, being careful to keep it 
unbroken, and pour over it a pint of milk and cream 
seasoned with salt and pepper, and thickened slightly 
with flour. 

Parsnips. —When boiled and seasoned with salt, but- 
ter, and pepper, for one dinner ; prepare enough, so that 
a part can be reserved for next day's fritters.

Pars7iip Fritters. — To half a dozen boiled, mashed 
parsnips, add two tablespoonfuls of flour, two eggs, and a 
little pepper and salt. Form into little cakes, and brown 
them in a little suet in a frying-pan. 

Egg Platit. — Cut this vegetable into slices about half 
an inch thick, which dip in salted beaten eggs and rolled 
crackers, alternately, and fry until richly browned in hot 
lard or suet. Serve on a warm plate. 

A Nice Variation of Sweet Corn. — Grate the com from 
a dozen fresh, tender ears ; season it with salt and pep- 
per, and cook it with an ounce of butter in a frying-pan, 
being careful that it gets no scorching. 

Boiled Onions. — Peel them with the hands under 
water, and no "idle tears" will accompany the process. 
Put them in boiling salted water, and let them cook un- 
til nearly done, when pour away the water, and replace 
it with a cupful of rich milk and some salt and pepper, 
letting them simmer until tender. 

Boiled Winter Squash. — Remove the seeds, and place 
it without paring in a steamer, with the rind uppermost. 
When tender, scrape the squash from the rind, mash 
smoothly, and season with salt, butter, and a little sugar. 

Squash Fritters. — Mix cold boiled or baked winter 
squash with an Qgg, salt, pepper, and a little flour ; form 
into little cakes, dredge them with flour, and brown them 
nicely on both sides in a frying-pan containing a little 
Buet or lard, and pile them on a warm plate, with bits of 
butter between. 

Celery. — After cutting away the roots, remove the outer 
tough stalks, wash thoroughly, and place it in cold water 
until wanted for the table. Women having the care of 
large houseliolds should eat freely of this savory esculent, 
for it gives strength to the nerves, and brings sound and 
healthful repose at night. It has also been announced 
lately as a remedy for rheumatism. Ordinarily, it is 



A FEW SIMPLE LUXURIES. 171 

dipped in salt, and eaten as we eat radishes ; but as a 
cure for rheumatic twinges, it must be steeped in water, 
and the water, seasoned with salt and pepper, may be 
drank either warm or cold.

AI^ ICE HOUSE. 

Select or make a level space of ground near the house, 
where least exposed to the summer sun, and cover it with 
any kind of cheap boarding — odds and ends answering 
just as well as selected lumber ; leave spaces between the 
boards for drainage. Place stout posts at each corner, the 
two at the front being two feet higher than those at the 
back, to support the slanting roof. Nail rough boards 
all round to the hight of two and a half feet, and then 
nail similar ones on the inside ; fill up this space on all 
sides with sawdust or tan-bark, and cover the floor to 
the depth of ten inches with the same. Select a freezing 
day, when the ice is in its best condition for storing this 
summer luxury. Have the ice cut in as large squares as 
can be handled, and pack it as closely and evenly as pos- 
sible, filling up all gaps with pounded ice, and turning 
water over each layer. Nail on more boards when the 
space is filled, and put in more layers of ice until enough 
is stored for a summer's use ; then cover the top two feet 
deepVith the tan or sawdust, and build over it a roof of 



172 FARM HOMES, IK-DOORS AND OUT-DOORS. 

boards covered with slabs. When ice is removed from it, 
care must be taken to replace the covering as completely 
as possible. Of course, a more elegant receptacle can be 
builded if a farmer has time and money to devote to it ; 
but if completely builded and shaded by trees or graceful 
vines, even this arrangement will not be an eye-sore, 
especially when dog-days shall have arrived ! 



A HOME-MADE REFRIGERATOR. 

A good refrigerator from the shops costs anywhere 
from il8 to $50, according to the size and finish. Every 
house-keeper may not be able to possess one, and so it is 
worth while to see what can be done m the way of a de- 
cent substitute : Secure two dry-goods boxes, the more 
substantial the better, one of them to be three or four 
inches smaller than the other on all sides, and fix the 
tops to open on hinges of iron, or stout leather. The 
larger the boxes, of course, the more convenience and 
comfort is afforded. Place an inch or two of sawdust 
over the bottom of the larger box, and set the smaller one 
into it. Bore three-quarter-inch lioles through both 
boxes at either end, near the top, and insert a roll of stiff 
pasteboard in each to act as ventilators. Then fill in all 
the space between the boxes with sawdust. Put in shelves 
at either end, leaving space in the center for the large 
deep pan or pail that is to hold the ice. There can also 
be two or three pegs, on which to hang pails of milk or 
fruit. A large tin pail, with a thin round board at the 
bottom to prevent its being bruised, would be the most 
convenient thing for holding the ice. Such a refrigerator, 
placed in the pantry, or some cool room, and covered m 
the hottest days with a folded blanket over the top, which 
is not protected with sawdust, would keep ice for twenty- 
four hours ; and in half a dozen such days, pay f8r its 



A FEW SIMPLE LUXURIES. 173 

slight cost many times over in the amount of food it would 
help to preserve. 

A WATER FILTER. 

Serious sicknesses would often be averted from the 
household if, among other sanitary regulations, none but 
filtered water was drank by its members. Water may 
look and taste like the purest, and still contain disease- 
germs that we would retreat from m horror if they but 
presented themselves duly labelled. Wells, cisterns, and 
springs that occupy ground lower than that of drains, 
vaults, or barn-yards, within a hundred feet or more, 
should be regarded with suspicion, no matter how *• splen- 
did * the water may appear. 

A good and elScient filter can be made in this way : 
Take a cask, rem'ove one end and set it upright, the open 
end at the top. At one third of the distance from the 
bottom place a round partition, pierced with small holes. 
On this arrange a layer of clean, small pebbles, and over 
them a layer of charcoal and another of sand, topping it 
with more pebbles. Over this put another partition with 
holes 111 it, or a layer of good-sized stones, to prevent the 
pebbles from being disturbed when water is poured in. 
A faucet is to be placed in the bottom to draw off the 
water. A pail of water and a lump of ice, placed in the 
top of the cask and closely covered, supplies the perfec- 
tion of drinking water for twenty-four hours. 

ICE-CREAM WITHOUT A FREEZER. 

Make a smooth, thin custard of one pint of milk, one 
pint of cream, one cupful of white sugar, two eggs, a tea- 
spoonful of lemon or vanilla extract, and a dessert-spoon- 
ful of corn-starch. When cool, pour it m a tin pail with 
a close cover, which set m a large pail or tub containing 



174 FARM HOMES, IN'-DOORS AND OUT-DOORS. 

ice and salt. Heap the ice about and over the tin pail, 
and in about an hour the cream will be nicely frozen. 

COOL HOUSES IIT SUMMER. 

During severe heat, close the doors and windows of 
lower rooms* after eight o'clock in the morning, witli 
the exception of some north door or window, and 
open the doors leadmg into the hall or the stair- 
way. Upper rooms not being in use until night will 
naturally be left open to sun and breeze, as all sleep- 
ing rooms should be. From these, the cooler air will 
descend to the rooms below, while the warmer current 
will ascend. Toward the middle of the afternoon, 
four or five o'clock, east and south windows can bo 
opened ; and at sunset all can be flung wide, and, if there 
are screens, remain so through the night. In the morn- 
ing, the house will seem to have absorbed coolness enough 
to last until the relief of another sunset. 

BOOMS WITHOUT FLIES. 

Farm-house rooms m daily use are generally found 
swarming with flies. It is only now and then that 
the visitor in rural districts enjoys the luxury of a 
dining-room where there are screens at windows and 
doors, and a delightful absence of these buzzing and 
somewhat filthy annoyances. If farm-Avives only realized 
how easy it is to get the upper hand of flies, they would 
not submit to them as they do. Fifty cents worth of 
mosquito netting, if the wire screening can not be pur- 
chased, securely tacked on plain pine frames, and placed 
in the doors and windows of the dining-room, before the 
flics have taken possession of the house, will keep the 
room almost entirely free of them all summer. If there 
13 a baby in the house who likes to poke his fingers

•through the door-screen^ the lower half can have slats 
nailed across, or be composed of boards entirely. A bit 
of coiled wire spring will keep the door from being left 
ajar. There should also be netting at bedroom and pan- 
try windows. If these screens are all put in place before 
the flies make their appearance, there will be very few 
intruders. Flies know enough to become " wonted " to 
places, and it is not so easy driving them away after they 
have once made themselves at home. 

A POT-POURRI, OR SCENT-JAB. 

Some of the *' decorated " jars which l^ve given pleasant* 
occupation to so many young fingers the past two years, 
can be put to appropriate use by filhug them alternately 
with layers of salt and any fragrant leaves or blossoms that 
can be obtained. Spices should also be sprinkled on the 
leaves. Sweet clover, rosemary, lemon verbena, rose gera- 
nium, June roses, sweet briar, lavender, and as many more 
as can be found may be used. Cinnamon, clove, and nut- 
meg ground together add greatly to the strength of the 
perfume. After filling, keep the jar closely covered for 
three months. After that, if the contents are occasion- 
ally stirred with a stick, and the cover left off for a few 
moments, the room will be filled with a delightful fra- 
grance. 

Another scent-jar that will keep its perfume for years 
is made chiefly of materials from the drug store. Bruise 
together four oimces of orris root and sweet flag. Add 
three ounces of sandal wood, one ounce of cedar, one 
ounce each of gum benzoin, styrax, and nutmeg, pow- 
dered, half a drachm of essence of lemon, one drachm of 
millefleurs, twenty drops of oil of lavender, ten grains of 
musk, and three ounces of rose leaves. Mix all together, 
and add a pound of fine salt. Mrs. ** Daisy Eyebright" 
finds this mixture excellent for perfuming linen, furs. 



176 FARM HOMES, IN'-DOORS AND OUT-DOORS. 

and woollen goods, as well as for filling scent-jars. It 
should be kept covered. When used for drawers and 
boxes, the salt and rose leaves are omitted, ten drops of 
otto of rose substituted, and the powder placed in silk or 
flannel bags. 

GRAPES AI^D PEARS FOR THE HOLIDAYS. 

Select the choicest and soundest specimens, and lay them 
on shelves in a cool, dark, and well-ventilated closet, or a 
darkened upper room, where there will be no danger of 
freezing, and where they can have plenty of space so as not 
.to touch each otl^r. Clusters of grapes should have the 
ends of their stems dipped in melted wax, and will keep 
best if hung up on slats to prevent any contact with the 
wall. Choice fall apples and pears, that otherwise might 
not appear at Christmas, should be wiped and placed on 
white paper. The cooler the room is, without freezing, 
the better the fruit will keep, and good ventilation is 
strictly necessary. The Concords, Isabellas, and other 
late-npening grapes are excellent for such storing, and 
when freezing weather arrives can be packed in sawdust, 
and kept nearly all winter. 

WARMED BEDROOMS. 

There is no surer pathway to the tomb, says Mrs. 
**Eyebright," than cold bedrooms and cold beds. 
"Neuralgia, pneumonia, and consumption itself can 
often be traced to the comfortless room m which child- 
ren and delicate persons are forced to sleep." It is not 
at all true that "cold bedrooms are healthy." This 
favorite idea should cease to be held by people who lay 
claims to common sense. The less we are roasted in 
summer and frozen in winter, the nearer we approach a 
climate most conducive to health. It should be the 



A FEW SIMPLE LUXURIES. 177 

home-keeper's study to secure as far as possible a tem- 
perate climate for the house. Nothing can be better for 
bedrooms in winter than fresh air, with the chill re- 
moved from it. Any one who can afford to have such an 
atmosphere, and still permits himself and family to go 
shivermg to bed to breathe over and over again the same 
icy air, the impurity of which is not at all ^'healthy," 
because it is so cold, ojiight to be prosecuted for at least 
an attempt to commit murder. By a happy provision of 
nature, most people live either where coal is cheap or 
where wood is plenty ; and in ordinary houses, such as 
are not warmed throughout by furnaces, a hall-stove, 
burning either hard coal or chunks of oak and hickory, 
will give to the upper rooms in winter an atmosphere 
that has the bite taken out of it ; while a window in each 
bedroom, if there is no better method of ventilation, can 
be let down an inch at the top, to feed sleeping lungs 
with a comfortable amount of oxygen. 

If economy in fuel must be used, the stove through the 
day need not be fed, but at night right-minded economy 
will see that it sends out and sends up its comforting 
cheer.

CHAPTER XII. 
FARM NEIGHBORHOODS. 

Just as where two or three are met together in His 
name, there reigns in their midst the blessed Spirit, so 
where two or four farms front each other, exists the pos- 
sibility of Neighbokhood. And a neighborhood is an 
excellent thing m the country. It is only the work- weary, 
noise-deafened, and perhaps slightly dyspeptic city mind 
that ever sings in earnest of the charms of solitude, and 
the all-satisfying companionship of nature. '^If I must 
choose between men and trees," says a wise and witty 
somebody, " I must say that I prefer men." Transplant 
your weary city-ite to the quiet and solitude of some farm 
lying five miles from its little country post-office, give 
him the sighing of the breeze and the chirp of the crickets 
night and day, with an Agricultural Report for reading, 
and the chickens and calves for companions, and in less 
than a year's time you will probably have on your hands 
a man gratefully ready to return to the cheerful activities 
and §ocial advantages of his city home. 

No one wants too much of anything, even of the serene, 
compunionless quiet of a beautiful country region, and 
the happiest existence must be that which can command, 
along with green fields and singing streams, something 
of the good cheer and inspiration of congenial fellowship, 
both in social and business life. 

A jocose city friend, who is more than half in earnest, 
however, says life can never possess its full meaning for 
her until she can have a fine fruit and dairy farm within 
ten minutes walk of the post-office ! And so, while we 
recognize the stern fact that we cannot combine all the 



FAEM JTEIGHBORHOODS. 179 

advantages of the city with all the beauty and freshness 
of the country, we can, in either situation, combine a 
little of the good in both. 

It is characteristic of some farmers to jeer more or less 
at citie? and city-hfe, and to regard city-people with a 
sort of derisive compassion. Visitors from cities to the 
country 7\'ill grow familiar with such expressions as this : 
'* So you've concluded to come out where you can live for 
a while !" Now if farm-people did but know it, it is an 
undeniable fact that, as farm-life now is, it is in these 
same derided cities that one often lives most and lives 
best, providing one is not crushed within the narrow 
groove of poverty. While farmers shrug their shoulders 
at cities, let them remember that cities are drawing their 
sons and daughters away from them ! that culture, so- 
ciety, and the pleasant clash and sparkle of immense 
business activities, often make lonesome, monotonous 
farm-work very distasteful in comparison. 

And whose fault is it that farm-work is lonesome and 
monotonous ? Certainly not the fault of the cliildren 
born to it. Nor can the trouble be attributed to Dame 
Nature, who has given such lavish materials for beautiful 
homes. If farmers want to fortify their lofty position in 
regard to real *' living," and if they want to keep their 
children near them, they must make an effort to lighten 
the loncsomeness and the monotony, and to create homes 
from which the children will not ghde away as they grow 
older. 

Let them try, among other things, the Neighboehood 
cure. Half a dozen families, settled iu neat houses within 
"calling" distance of each other, with spacious fruit and 
flower-gardens, snug bams and granaries, and a single 
wide street adorned with shade trees and neat walks, 
would form a community richly productive of good. And 
what a charming contrast it would be to the same number 
of houses strung lonesomely a mile or more apart ! 



180 FARM HOMES, IN-DOORS AJfD OUT-DOOES. 

In the West, where land lines are drawn with geometric 
precision, and the comparative newness of the country 
makes the plan easily practicable, it is a wonder that farm- 
neighborhoods have not sprung naturally mto existence. 
Four '' forties," or four '' eighties," or even larger farms, 
touching each other at a central point, might have all 
their houses, barns, and other buildings collected in a 
social and picturesque little settlement at this center. 
The cross-roads running through, might be set Avith shade 
trees, and fenced with neat and thrifty hedges. It would 
not be a great expense to make narrow gravel or flag 
walks on either side of these streets, with pretty rustic 
gateways leading into the grounds of each home. In the 
center of the small square formed by the intersecting 
roads, a well might be sunk, and a pump placed, shaded 
by a light rustic roof, and provided with drinking-cup and 
trough. Enough blessings, both from man and beast, 
would descend upon such an effort, in even one hot and 
dusty summer day, to pay the cost of it. One of these 
corner homes might maintain a good croquet-ground ; 
another, a capital swing — large enough to send fathers 
and mothers into the air, as well as their children. 
Another could furnish a smooth and capacious stretch of 
turf for foot-ball and other games ; while the ambition of 
the remaining corner might perhaps unfold beautifully 
in a comfortable and pleasant reading and club-room, 
where, m long winter evenings, the little community might 
gather sometimes for the reading and discussion of things 
of interest. 

An attractivejiucleus like this once formed, a portion, at 
least, of the sons and daughters growing up would be apt 
to build homes near at hand, and so the growth and 
beauty of the neighborhood would increase rather than 
diminish under the touch of the swift years. 

Where four or fi ve friendly families are gathered together, 
it would be no great task for some one of the fathers to 



FARM NEIGHBORHOODS. 181 

collect the children, in winter weather, into a generous 
sleigh-box (I would suggest plenty of sleigh-bells and 
warm robes), and take them to school, some other father 
going for them at night. The dreariness and inefficiency 
of the average country school is bad enough, without sub- 
jecting children to the added misery of wading through 
miles of snow, and facing biting winds in order to reach 
its portal. And just here it may not be out of place to 
assert that if even these four or five families would but 
take hold of their country school, and resolve to make it 
something worthy of the name, a great reform would take 
place. If they would see that their school-building is 
capable of being decently warmed and decently ventilated ; 
that it is kept clean and wholesome, and also free from 
the scribblmgs and scrawlmgs which are now its inevi- 
table characteristic ; if they would take one brief day, 
and set out a few shade trees and hardy shrubs, and en- 
courage the *^ big scholars " to take care of them ; if they 
would cultivate the acquaintance of the teacher ; if they 
would visit the school, not on the last day, but every two 
or three weeks ; and if every Saturday evening they would 
give five or twenty minutes to a review of their children's 
progress, the '^District School" would speedily become 
an institution fit to take in hand the plastic minds and 
hearts of mnocant children. 

Many more or less important advantages would spring 
from such a community. Each family subscribing for one 
or two first-class magazines and newspapers, a profitable 
" circulating library," full of instruction and entertain- 
ment, would be the result. Clothes, groceries, and farm- 
supplies, could be purchased at wholesale rates, and 
divided according to individual orders. Some happy boy, 
with a pony and stout leather satchel, could be chosen 
mail-carrier to and from the, perhaps, distant post-office, 
and there would follow the luxury of a daily paper for 
the reading-room, and letters delivered at the door. A

blacksmith's forge might be maintained, and save many 
trips to the village for simple repairs. A large easy 
wagon and four horses could occasionally convey the lec- 
ture or church-going portion of these families to town, 
when there should be something specially worth hearing ; 
and the same vehicle would be fine for pic-nic expedi- 
tions and harvest frolics. A good sermon, out of the many 
now reported in the newspapers, might be selected for 
reading at some neighbor's house on rainy or snowy Sun- 
days ; and it would be strange if, even in so small a vil- 
lage, there might not be an organ and two or three good 
voices for the accompanying hymns. Such things do 
good, sometimes more good than is obtained in some 
stately church, with its imposing fashion and formality. 
Sewing-Bees might be held, and the women expeditiously 
help each other through the huri:y of spring and fall 
sewing. Husking-frolics and Wood-sawing Socials would 
occur ; and what to both men and women is often hard 
and monotonous drudgery, would prove almost a recrea- 
tion, because of the good cheer of humanity's helpful and 
inspiring c ^mpanionship. 

Such a Neighborhood would be worth while, if only 
for its interchange of friendly lights on a stormy Decem- 
ber night ! What mother's heart but would beat braver 
as she rocks her sick baby in her arms, to know that 
three minutes distant, were other mother-hearts ready 
with their sympathetic aid and worthy counsel ? What 
children but would grow up happier, and better, and more 
intelligent from having daily companionship with other 
happy, good, and intelligent children ? What man but 
would enjoy and profit by the neighborly chat over farm 
matters, and political aspects, the neighborly help and 
the pleasant competition in making neat and thrifty 
homes ? 



TO farmers' wives. 183 

CHAPTER XIIL 
TO FARMERS' WIVES. 

A vigorous and truthful English writer declares that 
" unless a woman lives with a sister or a faithful woman- 
friend, it must be scored one against her chances for 
good health, that she has no wife to take care of her ! 
There is seldom any one to do for her what she does for 
her husband. Nobody reminds her to change her boots 
when they are damp, or tenderly jogs her attention as to 
draughts, or gives her the little cossetings which so often 
ward off colds, headaches, and similarly small ills." 

When she is half sick from any of these same petty 
ills, she can not, or at any rate will not, turn her back 
upon the kitchen and the children, and go off to the com- 
fort and quiet of half a day's repose in her bedroom, with 
no notion of being intruded upon. Her husband would 
do this and come out refreshed, and perhaps cured ; but 
for herself such * * laying off " is generally out of the 
question. The bread-sponge will be rising up in judg- 
ment against her, the baby will be falling down stairs, or 
tumbling into the well ; the morning dishes will be all the 
harder to do if left standing ; and then there is the inevita- 
ble dinner, and the roaring lions coming home to it by and 
by ! Of course, she can not rest. She "drags around" 
through the day, and, by leaving a few things undone, gets 
to bed by nine o'clock for the much needed rest and sleep, 
if she is not too ill to sleep, or if the possible baby does 
not disturb her. 

It is because of this lack of time for self -nursing that 
farmers' wives ought to take the best precautions against 
having any illness. "An ounce of prevention" is par- 
ticularly valuable to those who have no one to take care 
of them when they become ill. 



184 FARM HOMES, IN-DOORS AND OUT-DOORS. 

Maternity is womanhood's shadow ; and, whether glad 
or sorrowful in its possession, women are generally fol- 
lowed by it into all their professions, whether they be 
farm- wives, missionaries, or editors of fashion magazines. 
Man seldom has the care of children added to his business 
work. It would strike us as a very melancholy sight to 
see a man devoting the energies of one arm to a reaper, 
while he holds a worrying baby in the other ; or planting 
rows of potatoes in the hurry of spring work, while a small 
infant follows close at his heels crying to be taken ! Such 
a man would expect half the town to rush to his rescue ; 
and yet these are like the sights we see in women's work 
every day. 

It is because of this double burden, so patiently and 
often so joyously borne, that women deserve happier lives 
and longer lives than they often experience. And the 
fault IS largely their own that they do not experience them. 
Pour upon me no torrent of reproaches, dear reader, but 
it is a fact. You do not take care of yourself. In addi- 
tion to care of children and husband and the housework, 
you have to be mother and nurse to yourself, or else suf- 
fer more or less from neglect. Did you ever reflect upon 
this fact ? Years ago the blessed mother-hands cared 
for you ; you were not over- worked ; you had plenty of 
sleep, you had *'good times" now and then with your 
friends, and, above all, you had something happy and 
beautiful to look forward to. Now, you are away from 
the brooding mother- wings, and have a brood of your own ; 
cares and duties have quite banished the little festivals 
and jollifications of the old days ; and the hope and 
dream of your life, husband and home, having been 
achieved, you have lost the healthful stimulus of a great 
hope, and settled into an endless round of housework — 
seeing away off somewhere a vague glimmer of sweet-by- 
and-by rest, with the children grown up into talented 
men and women, and still clinging to you with the whole- 



TO farmers' wites. 185 

hearted love of their childhood. Dear woman, do not 
longer be given up to the endless round of dull, unrelieved 
labor, or else take you gaze quite away from that distant 
glimmer ! Ten to one you will not live to realize such 
pleasant hopes ; or, if your life is prolonged, you will find 
that talented sons and daughters can not turn with the 
old clinging love of their early days to the mother they 
have so completely outgrown and distanced — to the poor, 
old, self-sacrificed mother, shrivelled, both in body and in 
mind, with only her faithful, loving heart to feel vaguely 
hurt and unsatisfied over the pitying love which her 
children can not help showing for her ! Very few of us 
can enjoy a regard in which is mixed the element of com- 
passion, and such regard, coming from child to parent, 
is as painful as anything life affords. 

There may be a deep and touching beauty, to some 
minds, in such complete body and mind sacrifice of the 
mother to housework and child-care ; but it is all wrong, 
nevertheless. We may be pardoned for throwing our- 
selves into whirlpools, or into the jaws of lions and tigers, 
to lose our lives in saving our children ; but to slowly sink, 
until we are buried, in the slough of broken-down health 
and mental stagnation, is something not to be condoned. 

Busy mother, you who are not ** taking care " of your- 
self, you who are toiling early and late for husband and 
children, and bestowing less attention on yourself than 
you would naturally give to the commonest four-footed 
beast of burden, reflect a moment, and see if it is not a 
solemn duty you owe to yourself and to your husband 
and children, that you make sure no such future opens 
before you ! If you have thus far made a cipher of your- 
self, turn a new leaf at once, and commence caring a little 
for the wife of your husband and the mother of your 
children ! You had a fair stocli of good health and happy 
spirits to begin with. What right have you to squander 
such precious capital ? If attention to one's own health 



186 FARM HOMES, IN-DOORS AND OUT-DOOES. 

and well-being looks ** selfish," it looks otherwise when 
you reflect that upon your health and well-being depends 
the happiness and best welfare of the household. 

I saw a blessed sight the other day. A lady on the 
shady side of fifty (why ** shady ?" we ought to say the 
golden side of fifty !) going to her bedroom mirror to 
fasten some pink and white asters in her hair and at her 
collar, before summoning her husband and son to the 
neatly spread tea-table that awaited them — no sombre 
purple tints, such as somehow seem to be chosen by peo- 
ple of "years," if any are chosen at all, but the bright, 
delicate coleiir de rose that youth likes to select ! And 
how sweetly they looked m her half-silvered hair, and in 
the soft white ruffle under her chm ! Her dress was merely 
a striped print, and her white apron of that ample shape 
that makes aprons worth while ; but what neatness, and 
what faint bewitching scents of lavender and rose-leaves 
enveloped her person ! I am afraid she thought she saw 
surprise mingled with my glance of admiration, for she 
said " Do you think they are too gay for me ?" and added, 
as if half apologizing, "The boys like to see me wear 
something pretty." 

When the "boys" came in to supper I thought to my- 
self that the mother's neat, personal ways must have in- 
fluenced the other members of the household, for the 
working jackets had been exchanged for clean linen coats; 
and though very richly tanned, their faces and hands 
were clean enough to be kissed by queens, while one look- 
ed in vain for the proverbial "hay-seed" in their well 
cut and well-brushed hair and beards. And what intel- 
ligent and up-to-the-times talk there was from the lips of 
these three plain farm-people ! — the mother not one whit 
behind her " boys," and as dextrous in her views of the 
Presidency and Black's n»w story, as m pouring the tea 
and dispensing the stewed pears. 

I fancied it must have been from a home like this, or 



TO farmers' wives. 187 

what it was before the pretty daughters married and went 
away, that our Whittier caught that song of **Life 
Among the Hills." 



'Twere well if often 



To rugged farm-life came the gift 
To harmonize and soften. 

If more and more we found the troth 

Of fact and fancy plighted ; 
And culture's charm and labor's strength 

In rural homes united. 

The simple life, the homely hearth, 

With beauty's sphere enshrouding, 
And blessing toil where toil abounds, 

With graces more abounding." 

Is not this a pleasanter home-woman to look at than 
she who as some one says, "begins by being worth more 
than a hired girl at twelve dollars per month, and ends 
in a nervous, fretful, empty-minded, * broken-down ' old 
woman at forty-five " ? • 

Eeligiously consider, then, a few little rules and regu- 
lations that will help you to maintain health and to pre- 
serve in yourself the beauty and freshness of mind, and 
looks that will make you not only a comfort to yourself, 
but a cheering comrade to your husband and the fond 
friend and genial companion of your children. • 

Fresh air, cleanliness of person, comfortable clothing, 
nourishing food, sufficient sleep, and occasional recreation 
and diversion, are six indispensable requirements for 
Good Health. If I were addressing any but a farmer's 
wife, or an active home-keeper anywhere, I should add 
** plenty of exercise," which you already have. 

In summer, where a farm-house is favorably situated, 
the morning work m kitchen and dairy, and I trust a 
bit of flower garden, is all done in "fresh air." For 
the afternoon there is generally a shady porch or a pleas- 
ant open window, where pure, blood-sweetening air can 



188 FARM HOMES, IN-DOORS AlfD OUT-DOORS. 

still be enjoyed ; and at night there should be a window 
or two let down from the top in as spacious a sleeping 
room as the house will admit of. Small bedrooms ought 
never to enter into a house plan. In winter, fresh air is 
not so easily obtained, or its absence so easily detected. 
Shut up in the house the greater part of the time, you 
fail to notice its vitiated atmosphere ; but go out for a 
walk or a ride, and you will discover on returning to the 
unventilated living-room (it ought to be called a dying- 
room !) a '* close," impure taint m the air. And this is 
the kind of stuff you breathe all the time, unless you 
make some arrangements for letting the foul air escape. 
You must not tolerate its presence any more than you 
would that of toads and snakes. A window let down a 
little from the top will permit great quantities of bad air 
to escape, and the fresh air will find a way to replace it 
somehow. Your husband and school-going children 
will find a good deal of their air out of doors, and you 
are entitled to the besf you can make of the in-door at- 
mosphere. 

A room with a warm floor, plenty of sunlight, and an 
outlet for impure air, is the only one fit to be chosen for 
a winter living or working room. 

If you have a bath-room in the house capable of being 
con^'ortably warmed m winter, and affording its cool 
showers and douches m summer, with pipes to bring and 
carry away water, you have one of the greatest luxuries 
of civilization. If you have not such a room, fit up some 
closet for the purpose, and have a stovc-pipe run through 
it from the kitchen or living-room stove— or perhaps the 
bedroom stove may be placed near enough to warm it 
through the open door. If you must depend upon your 
own resources for its arrangements, you may be obliged 
to content yourself with a common tub large enough to 
stand and bathe in without slopping the floor, and a large 
tin pail for bringing and carrying away the water. I 



TO FAKMERS' WIVES. 189 

have seen a half -barrel cut down and, with cushioned 
edges, made into a very good sitz-bath tub. (Those made 
of zinc or tin cost three or four dollars.) There should 
be a sponge for each individual, and always plenty of dry 
towels. A bottle of ammonia and some good Castile 
soap should never be wanting. If there is a window for 
sunlight to come pouring through for half the day, so 
much the better ; the place can then be easily kept dry 
and well aired. 

And now, after making sure of your fresh air, will you 
try, if you have not tried, the rejuvenating influence 
of a daily bath ? You may thmk you have no time for 
it. I often notice that those mothers who have **no, 
time " have houses and children in spic and span order, 
while they themselves look neglected and jaded, and 
sometimes, alas ! just a little negligent in their dress. 
It IS like the vine-leaves and blossoms dancing high up in 
the air and sunlight, while low down in the darkness and 
shadow grows the unlovely, unnoticed mother-root that 
gives them life. Such maternity is more beautiful in 
vines than it is in human life. Take a few moments 
from your housework and your child-care for yourself. 
Once in the habit of a daily bath, it comes as natural and 
requires almost as little time as washing your face and 
hands. Just before going to bed is the best time for it. 
You are not only certain of being uninterrupted, but you 
will find yourself so refreshed and "rested" that good 
sound sleep will at once follow. Quickness and thor- 
oughness will always prevent any "catching cold" or 
any disagreeable chill ; and so five minutes is ample time 
for an all-over bath. The water should be nearer warm 
than cold, and there need not be an ocean of it ; two 
quarts in the washbowl, with a few drops of aromatic 
ammonia and a large, soft sponge, constitute all that is 
needed where baths are taken every day. After the bath 
a well-aired night gown of cotton or flannel should be put 



190 FARM-HOMES, IN-DOOES AND OUT-DOORS. 

on, and the flannels and chemises worn through the day 
hung where they will be accessible to air. Our clothes 
are continually absorbing waste and putrid matter through 
the pores of the skin, and it is strictly necessary to per- 
sonal cleanlmess, that day-garments should not be worn 
through the night, but be given a chance to throw off 
something of the invisible impurities they have collected. 

In the morning, the busy morning, when so many 
things to be done confront your waking eyes, you have 
only to take a dash of cold water on your face, chest,, and 
arms, and proceed to dress. For this morning ablution 
a bottle of brine made from sea-salt is excellent to have 
at hand. Pour a little upon a wet cloth, or sponge, and 
rub face, breast, and arm-pits. It purifies and invigo- 
rates the skin. Sitz-baths in blood- warm water should 
be taken once a week for the space of five or ten minutes. 
They help prevent many of the diseases and weaknesses 
that woman-flesh seems to be heir to. 

Secure another five minutes from your twonty-four 
hours, and devote it to your hair and teetli. If the scalp 
is washed once or twice a week in water in which is dis- 
solved a little borax, or in which is mixed a few drops of 
ammonia, it will need no raking from ivory teeth, and 
the hair will be clean and glossy, especially if thoroughly 
brushed with a stiff brush once a day. Never use oils or 
pomades. If the hair is too dry and fluffy for comfort 
(it cannot be too much so for fashion — at present !), ap- 
ply to it a little of the mixture of bay-rum and glycer- 
ine, which druggists will put up for twenty-five cents. 
Every new moon, clip the ends of your hair ; this may be 
a "notion," but it is one that repays adoption. 

If you have sound teeth, you^ cannot be too grateful 
for such a possession, and should not grudge giving them 
such care as will preserve them, if possible, into old age. 
Brush them thoroughly at night in soap and water, in 
which is a drop of the ever useful ammonia, and rinse 



TO FAKMEKS' WIVES. 191 

mouth and throat in clear water. After each meal but 
half a minute will be required to rinse the mouth, so that 
no particle of food may remain in the teeth to breed tar- 
tar and decay. If there are bad teeth that are past filling, 
summon a little grit and have them removed at once ; 
as besides being unsightly they are like constant ma- 
laria to the lungs. If one is afflicted with bad breath, 
even if the teeth are sound, the stomach needs atten- 
tion, and a series of charcoal powders with plain diet 
will soon correct its evil ways. 

White and soft hands are not always compatible with 
big ironings and all the miscellaneous work of a farm- 
kitchen, but your hands can receive better treatment 
than you perhaps give them. *^My mamma's hands 
are white, and she wears a pretty ring," boasted one 
little four-year old to a playmate who, with ;^tifully 
downcast eyes and mute lips, was realizing the fact 
that her mamma's hands were nothing to brag of. 
Both these mothers were busy workers, but oi^e **took 
care" of herself a little, while the other did not, and 
kept her rings in a box. 

It is not vanity or silliness to make the best of even 
our hands. In sweeping floors, polishing stoves, and in 
garden work, old gloves should always be worn ; and 
there should be plenty of holders about the stove for 
managing kettles, and saucepans, and taking things from 
the oven. An excellent thing in winter is a thick flan- 
nel mitten made large enough to slip on easily, and hung 
handily at the back of the stove, to be used in opening 
the stove and putting in wood. At night a little glycer- 
ine thinned with lemon juice and rubbed on the hands 
will tend to keep them goft and prevent roughness and 
chapping. This mixture is also excellent for burning 
from wind and sun. 

Glycerine, borax, ammonia, sea-salt, and lemon juice, 
are all cheap and excellent ** cosmetics" and aids to 



IdZ FARM HOMES, IX-DOORS AND OUT-DOORS. 

cleanliness ; and if to these can be added a bottle of some 
pure, delicate perfume, like essence of English violet, or 
white rose, your toilet table is quite plentifully supplied. 

The next question to consider is comfortable and be- 
coming clothing, for notwithstanding the seeming im- 
possibility of the task, they can be combined. There 
is a happy medium between the grotesque ''bloomer" of 
thirty years ago and the peacock tails of the present day, 
that brave women can and do adopt everywhere, and still 
are within that very proper region that is bounded by 
the pales of fashion. There is a woman living who years 
ago very quietly made for herself some under garments 
somewhat like close-fitting basqumes, so that with ro»ws 
of buttons around the waists and ruffles at the bottom, 
they answered for four articles of dress, viz. , chemise, cor- 
set, skirt-supporter, and underskirt. She has worn them 
ever since with great comfort and satisfaction, and has 
never thought of being strong-minded or blowing a ''re- 
form " tfumpet over her self-emancipation. 

If you Hve anywhere withm our so-called temperate 
zone, you should wear under flannels throughout the year. 
It IS not necessary to proclaim their great comfort m 
winter, for you are well aware of it ; but you may not 
know that you will be cooler and more comfortable in 
summer for wearing them, and greatly protected from 
chilly morning and evening air, and from sudden changes 
in the weather. Summer flannel can be of light quality, 
and that made of half wool and half cotton is less liable 
to shrink, and answers every purpose of protection. 
Those for winter wear should be of all-wool flannel and 
made high in the neck, and with sleeves coming below 
the elbow. Whether for summer or winter wear, they 
should be made long enough to cover the hips. A great 
many ladies now wear winter flannels in vest and drawers 
combined in one garment, with another "union suit" in 
cotton worn over it ; then with a warm balmoral skirt 



TO FARMEES' WIVES. 193 

and sensible woollen stockings, no more underwear is ro^ 
quired. 

This is such an improvement on the old regulation of 
separate under flannels, chemise, drawers, corset, under- 
skirt, overskirt, and perhaps a dress divided into a basque 
and two additional skirts, that no woman who has once 
tried the delightful comfort of dressing so sensibly will 
go back to the irksome and complicated toggery she used 
to wear. 

Let us dress as comfortably and at the same time as 
becomingly as we can. How much of our nervousness, 
and irritability, and weariness, might be traced to a drag- 
ging skirt, or the compression of half a dozen bands 
about the waist, or a "hateful" corset, or an ill-fitting 
or out-of -fash ion dress ! To be clean and to be comfort- 
ably and tastefully dressed is the condition that is indeed 
**next to godliness." Have we not often seen the good 
effect of a bath and a clean, nicely-ironed frock or apron 
upon some tired, dirt-demoralized little child ? And 
what are we but children, to be overcome now and then 
by the dust and grime of our work and the depressing 
influence of a faded calico ! When we find ourselves m 
such sloughs, let us lose no time in getting out of them. 

Being a farm-wife, and not accustomed to the more 
leisurely mornings of ** eight-hour" workers, you must 
have clothes into which you can jump, as it were. 
And is it not just as easy to jump into a pretty, nicely- 
fittmg percale or gingham working-costume, with its 
clean collar or ruff already basted m the neck, as it 
is to jump mto a limp, stringy calico *' wrapper" of 
some dark, ugly pattern, and having about as much 
comeliness as a meal-sack with a string tied around 
its center ? Percales and ginghams cost a trifle more 
at the start, but they will outwear and out wash half 
a dozen cheap prints ; and besides will always look 
fresh and new if light, firm colors are selected.

^ There are always to be found neat and simple, and at 
tne same time stylish patterns for making up these work- 
ing suits in one garment, the trimming being put on to 
simulate jackets or sacques. The skirts should be made 
short enough to escape dust and dew, say within four or 
five inches of the floor, and one cannot realize until she 
wears a dress so shortened, the increased ease and dis- 
patch with which work can be accomplished. 

Always maintain a good supply of collars and ruffles. 
Their cost ready made is trifling, and they are still 
cheaper when made at home ; half a yard of linen, 
the same of book-muslin or organdy, and a little edg- 
ing, will make up a year's supply for every-day wear; 
and no '* trifle" adds so much to woman's dress as 
something pure and white about the neck, fastened 
with a becoming knot of ribbon or an inexpensive little 
brooch. 

If you make it a rule to baste or pin something of 
this sort in the neck of your dress after undressing 
at night, it will be something of a help toward exj^e- 
ditious dressing m the morning. 

Morning caps of book-muslin, cambric, or lace — a cir- 
cular piece of the material gathered into a band of velvet 
or ribbon to fit the head — are exceedingly convenient, and 
can be made very becoming; besides, they protect the 
hair from dust when sweeping. 

Remember that you are to be "mother" to yourself ! 
You do not permit the children to leave the warm room 
and go out in the cold or damp to play without an extra 
tfecarf or cape. You do not let them keep on their wet 
shoes and damp stockings when they come home from 
school on a stormy day. If they have sore throats, and 
colds, and little bad feelings, you wrap up their necks, 
give them simple remedies, and try to keep them from 
getting worse. See that you are half as considerate to 
yourself — unless you are anxious to leave them mother-

less ! Don't run out of the heated kitclien to wrestle 
with the line full of frozen clothes, bare-heiided and 
thinly shod. Don't sit up sewing at night and let the 
fire go out, thinking it silly to burn wood just for your- 
self. Don't sit up at all beyond bedtime iiours, unless 
it is a case of sickness or some strictly necessary sew- 
ing, and then do not go cold and shivering, or faint 
and hungry, to bed ; but keep a comfortable fire, and 
before retiring take a cup of hot milk and tea, and 
some bread and butter, or a bowl of chicken broth or 
oyster soup. Never keep damp stockings and shoes on 
your feet or sit in a room where you feel chilly. If you 
have headache, or backache, or a *' wretched cold" 
(you will not be troubled with these ills very much if you 
take good sanitary precautions against them), do not 
try the sometimes too smart remedy of "working it off," 
but coddle yourself to the best of your ability, and let at 
least a part of the work await the sure coming of another 
day, and do not **fret" about it, else the shirking will 
do no good; but just rest a little and get well. Do 
not wear tight or dragging clotlies. When going to ride 
in winter, put on an extra pair of stockings and button 
a newspaper or a piece of flannel inside your dress over 
your chest and lungs. 

Be friendly and good to your stomach. Do not live 
on hot biscuits, incessant pork, pie-crust, cake, and del- 
uges of tea and coffee. The farm generally affords plenty 
of milk, eggs, poultry, wheat, fruit, and vegetables. You 
are surrounded with a world of delicious and healthful 
foods. As for tea and coffee, they are not food at all, 
except for the accompanying sugar and cream. But 
one cup of good coffee, or one cup of good tea, does 
no one any great harm, and is often the gentle stimulant 
and "care-breaker" that a woman needs. It is an out- 
rage on the stomach to drown it at meal times with any 
kind of fluid, ice-water being the most hurtful of all. 



196 FARM HOMES, IN'-DOOnS AND OUT-DOORS. 

It is your right to have eight or nine hours out of the 
twenty-four for sleep. Let nothing but sickness shove 
aside this important corner-stone of health. It is all 
wrong to rise at day-dawn in summer, and long before 
sunrise in winter, feeling only half rested, and as if you 
would **give the world" for one more hour of sleep. 
Nothing is gained by lashing nature on to extraordinary 
feats of endurance. Sooner or later she will show that 
she does not submit to such things without ample re- 
venge. If there are portions of the year when farm- 
work, and consequently housework, must be rushed, or 
it seems necessary to use the **cool of the day," viz., be- 
tween four and six o'clock a. m. , an afternoon nap, even 
if it lasts but ten minutes, will go far to soothe the nerve- 
weariness that comes of lost sleep. Indeed, my home- 
keeper, a ten-minute nap is always beneficial to you ; and 
when you lay your baby down for his after-dinner repose, 
remember that you, too, are in need of a little refreshing 
rest. Lie down beside him, or what is better, lie down 
away from him, and resolutely close your eyes for fifteen 
minutes, whether you sleep or not. You will rise feeling 
stronger and clear-headed, and the afternoon work will 
come easier to you than if you had plodded on without 
stopping. 

Plan easily-prepared breakfasts and suppers, and have 
the brunt of the day's work in the forenoon, when you 
will naturally feel most like grappling with it. There 
are some women who are always in a whirlpool of work, 
yet they do not accomplish as much as their calmer and 
more systematic sisters, who find time for a little reading 
or out-door recreation now and then. To rise in the 
morning and cook potatoes, bake biscuits, fry or broil 
meats, spread the table, attend to small children, and 
strain and set away the morning milk, as I have seen 
more than one farm-wife do, is enough to tire one out in 
the very beginning of the day. A breakfast of white and 



TO farmers' wives. 197 

graham bread, cold roast or boiled meat, hashed pota- 
toes, oat or wheat grits, and some kind of fruit, is good 
enough for kings and emperors, and it almost cooks itself. 
The same bill of fare, varied by an omelet, or milk-toast, 
or baked potatoes, or an easily-made johnny cake, an- 
swers equally well for supper, and what a vast amount of 
flurry and fluster might be saved by its adoption. 

Do not neglect that world within your head ! — that 
brain-world wherein you used to dream fine dreams, and 
build many an airy castle ! Do not give up hopes and 
aspirations and special tastes. If you once loved to 
"twang the guitar," or "sweep the dulcimer," or had a 
talent for drawing, or writing for the newspapers, or pos- 
sessed a gentle taste for botanizing, and collecting shells 
and minerals and butterflies, continue to cultivate the 
faculty. A gratified longing for such things is just as 
necessary for the mind's welfare as gratified hunger for 
beef and vegetables is necessaiy for the physical well- 
being. Interest your children in these things, and 
among them you will be sure to find more than one eager 
and sympathetic co-worker. 

Above all, do not turn your back upon good reading. 
Subscribe to nothing weak and trashy. A good practical 
newspaper, such as treats of the household, the garden, 
and the farm, and some first-class journal filled with 
stories, poems, sketches, and science articles, by talented 
and scholarly authors, are worth tons of "pictorials" 
and cheap romances. 

Have something "going forward," if it is nothing 
more than the cultivation of new kinds of strawberries 
and chickens, a winter reading club of three or four 
neighbors, or a pleasant little annual excursion, or 
"camp-out," on some lake-side or mountain-top with 
your children. Beware of the " all work and no play " 
that breaks down health and spirits, and starves the 
mind." And do not depend entirely upon your husband 



198 FARM HOMES, IN'-DOORS AND OUT-DOORS. 

for all the happiness and good cheer of your life, else yon 
will sometimes be disappointed and disheartened. Di- 
verting occupations, friendship, good books, and the care 
and companionship of children, will healthfully fill any 
voids in your heart that otherwise might ache ; and at 
any rate you will be cared for none the less if you prove 
yourself able to worry along without constant adoration. 
In a word, take care of yourself physically, mentally, 
and spiritually, and we shall see fewer sad-faced, hope- 
less-eyed women in our farm-homes, and fewer bereaved 
husbands casting about for their second and third wives. 



CHAPTER XIV. 
REARING AND TRAINING OF CHILDREN. 

Every mother should bear in mind that it is easier to 
keep children well than it is to cure them after they be- 
come ill. A few simple rules, faithfully and unflinch- 
ingly observed, would banish nine-tenths of the sicknesses 
among children that too often lead to fatal results. 

Give them in the first place plenty of love — expressions 
of love ! Oftentimes fathers and mothers deeply love 
their children, yet show such little evidence of affection 
that the children are apt to have a forlorn feeling that it 
doesn't exist at all. An occasional word of praise, a 
caress, an expression of sympathy — these are necessary to 
healthy and happy child-life as summer-showers to grow- 
ing vines. Especially bear this in mind, they should never 
go to bed cold, or hungry, or unhappy. 

Let them have plenty of healthy and palatable food, 
at regular hours. Small children should have a slice of 
bread and butter, or an apple, or some simple *'bite," 
half way between meals, and nothing more in the v^ay of 



REARING AND TRAINING OF CHILDREN. 199 

lunclies. It is the constant nibbling and '^ piecing " that 
does harm. Never force a child to eat anything he has 
a real dislike for. When plain food is declined because 
of the more tempting dessert ahead, it is a different 
affair ; but I have seen little children compelled to eat 
things, when every mouthful would be swallowed vrith 
tremendous eifort and genuine disgust. Some of us have 
an utter abhorrence of onions or tomatoes, or codfish, or 
some article of food that ought to be relished. How would 
we like to have some mighty giant put such food upon 
our plates, and compel us to eat it amid wild flourishes 
of his knotted club ? Would we sweetly feel that the 
dear giant knew what was best for us, and proceed to 
swallow every mouthful ? or would we say to ourselves — 
*' We'll eat it, because we must, but we hate it all the 
same, and we hate you, too !" Children have as much 
right to their likes and dislikes as we have to ours. 

Thorough, all-over baths should be given to the little 
people once a week, at least, and in summer oftener. 
They should be given in comfortable rooms, out of 
draughts, and the water should never be colder than new 
milk. Rub the skin thoroughly dry with coarse soft 
towels, and put on the night-dresses or clothing imme- 
mediately. Often severe colds and fever attacks can be 
broken up by giving the bath as warm as it can bo borne, 
putting the child comfortably to bed, laying a handker- 
chief wrung from cold water on the forehead, or where- 
ever the ache is, and giving him- all the cold water and 
pounded ice that he wants. One mother writes that she 
has never had any serious sickness in her family of five 
children. At first complaints of headache, thirst, weari- 
ness, and *^ toothache in the legs," as our little girl 
called it, she undresses and gently bathes the child, puts on 
a warm, comfortable wrapper, and lays him in bed, rub- 
bing the " toothache " with her hands for a few minutes, 
and perhaps staying to tell a pleasant story, or to sing a 



200 FAEM HOMES, IJ^^-DOORS At^B OUT-DOORS. 

lullaby, if the child is small. If she must attend to 
housework, she leaves the bedroom door open, so that 
while the patient is composed and quiet, he still has the 
feeling of not being left alone. In almost every instance 
a sweet, restful slumber follows ; and, by extra attention 
to diet and out-door wraps, the child is as weU as ever in 
twenty-four hours.'" This modest mother does not lay any 
stress on her pleasant stories and lullabys, but no doubt 
her gentle and cheerful "way "with her children goes 
far to banish the demons of serious sickness. 

Children should always wear flannel vests — thin and 
light for summer, and of heavier quality, long sleeved 
and high-necked, for winter, and always long enough to 
cover the hips. Flannel over the bowels, especially for 
teething children, is very beneficial. It is no wonder 
that the ** second summer " is a trying one for the babies, 
since they are often clad in thin, short, cotton garments, 
in which they are exposed to all the variations of atmos- 
phere between sunrise and bedtime. 

Be sure that children have comfortable clothing — cloth- 
ing that never pinches or scratches, or feels as if slipping 
off. It is not in human nature, young or old, to tran- 
quilly endure irritable clothing, and boots or shoes that 
torture. Make the clothes, firstly, to be comfortable ; 
secondly, to be neat and becoming. Flannels should 
always be loose, and waists well fitting, but not in the 
least tight, and provided with buttons for drawers and 
skirts. The only garters fit to be worn are those of elastic 
that fasten to the waist and top of the stockings. They 
cost fifteen or twenty cents, and by supplying fresh elastics 
now and then, will last through a whole childhood. It is 
said to be beneficial for children to go barefooted during 
hot weather, but a good lookout must be maintained for 
the broken glass, nails, and the rubbish that sometimes 
abounds on uncivilized premises ; and no expedition to 
field or woods should be entered upon without long stock- 



EEARIi^^G A^D TRAINIIS^G OF CHILDREjq-. 201 

ings and stout boots or shoes. In winter some inside 
soles of felt, or even of thick paper, add much to the 
warmth and dryness of the feet ; and ear-muffs and wrist- 
lets, though small enough in themselyes, are big rein- 
forcements against chills and frost-bites that otherwise 
will come. 

Never hamper and torment childreS^ with clothes that 
are *'too nice "to be anything but wretched in. They 
may be taught reasonable care in regard to soiling their 
clothes, but to see a child in a constant spiritual straight- 
jacket, for fear the mud-cakes, or the game of marbles, 
or the jolly romp will soil the knees, or *'muss" the 
apron, or dissarrange the hair, is an indication of idiotic 
parentage. There are cheap, light, half-wool fabrics, 
sold in gray, and in brown plaids and stripes, that, piped 
with bright colors, make up into excellent dresses or 
blouses for little folks, being just as cool as print and 
gingham, requiring no starching when washed, and not 
soiling or rumpling easily. 

Let the children have plenty of sleep. I have seen 
young children, almost infants, wakened and made to 
get up two hours before their natural sleep was finished, 
merely because it was thought best that they should '^eat 
breakfast with the others." Again, imagine yourself 
in the hands of a giant, and being hauled out of bed 
while in the midst of profound and refreshing slumber, 
just for the privilege of eating breakfast with a lot of 
other giants who grin at you if you are cross, and per- 
haps vigorously spank you, some one of them, if you say 
or do anything expressive of your wretched feelings. 
There are no healthy children who take more sleep than 
they need; and yet we often see young boys ** routed" 
before sunrise and set to work, with empty stomachs and 
dizzy heads, at chores that might just as well await the 
coming of a decent haur. Let us all pray to be preserved 
from that slashing, mule-headed, and generally ignorant 



202 FARM HOMES, IN-DOORS AKD OUT-DOOES. 

farmer who ** drives" everything before him, including 
his wife and children ! In the long run he comes out a 
good ways behind his more eflBicient and more enlight- 
ened neighbor, who takes things easily and does things 
pleasantly, and steers clear of that kind of haste which 
makes waste. The first step toward making boys **hate 
the farm " is to cut down their rightful hours of sleep, 
and make the beginning of every day thoroughly wretched 
to them. 

Children can hardly be too much in the *'open air." 
We all observe how much healthier and happier they are 
in the bright dry weather with which we are blessed for 
a portion of the year. With the long, cold rains of 
autumn begins the dismal time for birds and children ; 
and even we grown people, in spite of our work and our 
mental resources, feel depressed and saddened. To the 
children's loss of soft breezes, warm sunlight, and the 
freedom of all out- doors, is added the crushing knowledge 
that they ''make tracks," that they "litter the carpet," 
and they "kill people with their noise." In our North- 
ern States there will be five or six months of this sort of 
thing. Now, much of the winter discomfort to all par- 
ties might be saved if children had such clothes as would 
enable them to be out at play a part of the time even in 
forbidding weather. No matter how coarse and plain 
the clothes if they are warm and stout, and as waterproof 
as possible. An investment in thick, high-buttoned 
over-shoes, and extra cloaks and jackets is, of course, 
pleasanter and less expensive than an investment in 
doc tor- visits. To be sure doctor-visits are not alwa3'S the 
alternative, but the better the regimen under which 
children live, the fewer visits of this sort. As for 
"toughening" children by sending them half -dressed in 
the damp or biting air, none but ignorant and stupid 
parents do such things, our churchyards are already suf- 
ficiently full of little graves. Give the children warm 



BEARING AND TEAINING OF CHILDEEN. 203 

feet, something over their ears, and good staunch flannels 
between them and Jack Frost, and they will grow up 
far stronger and " tougher " than the poor little shiver- 
ing ones who have to pull their heads into their shoulders 
and huddle themselves together like calves in a winter's 
storm, for lack of sensible clothes. 

It is a fact that country children suffer for want of 
pleasant and improving amusements. Says a writer in 
one of our farm monthlies : 

"A small dwelling, stable, cornfield, working team, 
farm tools, and the usual farm stock comprise the home 
companions and articles connected with the employment 
and every-day life of seventy-five per cent of farmers' 
children. Day by day they meet with these or some of 
them, their monotonous life goes on ever the same, and 
their love for the beautiful lies undeveloped and dormant ; 
their opinions and tastes are unheeded, or are not brought 
out, and finally that which might be developed into 
something really praiseworthy, becomes seared and hard- 
ened until at last, when more mature, they find employ- 
ment only in the commonest and cheapest pursuits of 
life. No kind of stock possesses so many attractions for 
the little chaps as poultry ; the hidden nest, the smooth 
white eggs daily renewed, the waiting and watching for 
the hatching day, the dozen little downy chicks running 
about the coops, their change to full-grown chanticleers, 
with brilliant garb and prolonged crows, all have their 
influence and tend to inspire the youngsters with love 
and admiration, and to develop a lasting fondness for 
the beautiful throughout the brute creation." 

To the chickens there might be added, with little ex- 
pense, a few handsome ducks and. a pair of rabbits. 
And if the home be near a brook, a trout pond might be 
manufactured, which would be not only a joy to the boys, 
but a very good thing for the breakfast-table, occasion- 
ally, during the trout season. 



204 FARM HOMES, IN'-DOORS AND OUT-DOORS. 

A genuine shepherd dog, a good-natured and a faithful 
animal who knows almost everything, would be a capital 
companion for the children in their sports and wander- 
ings, and very useful for watching and for bringing up 
the sheep and the cows. 

Every farmer should possess a workshop, with a fa^r 
supply of tools. He will find it a great convenience in 
case of simple mechanical jobs to be done ; and it will 
seem marvellous, the amount of attraction a few boards, 
a plane, and hammer and nails, will have for an ingenious 
boy on a stormy day ! The garret might be fitted up for 
a ''carpenter's shop," or a small comfortable lean-to 
might be added to the woodshed, or a part of the wood- 
shed itself marked off for this use. The shop should be 
well lighted, and have conveniences for a fire in cold 
weather ; and an ungrudged supply of lumber and neces- 
sary tools will weigh but lightly in the scales against 
the useful occupation and the self-teaching in mechanical 
ideas which will be afforded the boys, and the added at- 
traction they will find in their farm 'homes. 

All work and no play not only makes Jack a dull boy, 
but it is very apt to make him a surly and unpleasant 
boy. We are all surly and unpleasant when we are put 
to work week in and week out, with no breaking away 
from the tread-mill, into the green fields of restful, happy 
recreation, no pleasant hope or kindling aspiration fling- 
ing its radiance over the dull, every-day things about us. 

Give Jack a share in the wheat-crop, or in the corn- 
field, in which he has toiled. Give it to him to do as he 
likes with, instead of spoiling the deed with the stingy 
proviso that it must be "laid out" in brown-drilling, 
brogans, and winter shirts 1 

Let him and his brothers and chums try a week or two 
of ''camping out " in the pleasant fall weather ; and go 
sometimes yourself, my farmer, and try the taste of 
broiled quail and squirrel-stew under the forest trees. A 



REAKTN^G AND TRAINING OF CHILDREN. 205 

capital, and at the same time very practical, little book on 
'* Camping Out" was published two or three years ago. 
It is full of helpful instruction about making tents, 
building camps, what supplies are needed, how to cook 
game, and how to make the whole business a comfortable 
and jolly recreation, instead of a laborious pursuit of 
bad colds ! Every boy should have this book. 

If you wish your children to love you, and also to 
respect you, do not be constantly scolding and nagging 
them. Calm, earnest rebuke is one thing, and snappish, 
angry scolding is another. We often see children in- 
stantly and cheerfully obey the father, while the mother 
drives them with little pushes and repeated commands, 
and sometimes a shake or a blow, before her wishes are 
acceded to. Why is there this difference ? Because the 
father is of few words and means what he says, and the 
poor mother is a worried, nervous, fluttering woman, 
without dignity or self-control, and consequently unable 
to control others. 

A scolding tongue is worse than a hornet's nest or a 
drizzling rain in the house. It irritates, embitters, and 
discourages. It never softens and convinces, and gently 
conquers. If we grown-up people endure " scolding " 
with such bad grace, consider its effect on the still more 
sensitive soul of childhood. Better a good rousing tem- 
pest, followed by clear deep skies of love and joy and 
peace, than a continual dripping of fine but excessively 
dampening sleet, and a perpetual east- wind of rebuke and 
fault-finding ! 

Do not break your promise to the children, no matter 
how trifling they may seem to you, any more than you 
would evade some sacred pledge to a cherished friend. 
What should the children be but cherished friends ? If 
you would have them true and loyal, and **as good as 
their word," you must be perfectly true to yourself in 
your dealings with them. There is too much of tricky 



FAEM HOMES, IN-DOOKS Al<fD 0UT-D00E8. 

deception and mean "putting off" in our conduct with 
the confiding, earnest-hearted children. They are not 
slow to see through sham excuses and lying subterfuges ; 
and woe unto you as a parent, if you succeed in estab- 
lishing yourself in their clear judgment as a ** humbug." 

Do not shame and humiliate a child before strangers, 
or even before other members of the family. Punish- 
ment or rebuke ought to be between just the two persons, 
the parent and the child. Yet it is a common thing to 
Bee ill-bred parents ** showing off " their authority before 
•visitors, and making children perfectly wretched and 
overwhelmed with confusion about little misdemeanors 
that need but a word, and that word privately addressed 
to them. 

I shall never forget the sight of a sensitive little girl to 
whom her mother called the attention of a tea-tableful of 
Tisitors, because she had taken a too large bite of some 
very nice jelly-cake she was eating. The child first 
glanced appealingly at her mother, with eyes that might 
have pierced the heart of a savage, then turned her shy 
gaze around upon the circle of smiling faces, and dropping 
her face into her napkin, began to sob as if her heart was 
breaking. There are plenty of children who would not 
have mmded such speech and such looks directed to them, 
and would have serenely munched on. But this little 
lady, being so sensitive to rudeness, felt differently. I 
expected that the mother would at least leave her to her- 
self, or allow her to leave the room, now the mischief was 
done ; but, no, she was compelled to stop crying, hold up 
her head, and finish her supper. The feat required some 
time, it seemed as if the poor thing would burst a blood- 
vessel in trying to swallow her sobs and appear calm, but 
in three or four minutes she was indeed holding her head 
up and ** finishing" her supper, fumbling through a blur 
of silent tears for the toothsome cake that was now no 
more to her than so much saw-dust. The mother^ with 



BEARING AND TRAINING OF CHILDREN. 207 

a toss of triumph, then graciously consented to change 
the subject. Such treatment of children is nothing less 
than brutal. 

The " awkward age " in boys renders them often deeply 
sensitive to being rebuked or criticised before visitors, 
and especially before their own friends. If you are a true 
and sympathetic mother, you will gracefully help your 
boy out of little mishaps, and quietly pass over his faults 
and blunders, until you can speak to him at the right 
time. A boy wants a reliable, faithful, kind-hearted 
friend in you, and not an anxious, constantly-nagging gov- 
erness. Somebody has said " There is nothing so beauti- 
fully chivalrous as the love of a big boy for his mother. 
I never yet knew a boy to ' turn out ' badly, who began 
by falling in love with his mother." It would very much 
brighten and reform our social world, if we could see 
more of this happy, trustful, thoughtful devotions of boys 
for mothers. And how is it to be had unless the mothers 
are wise, faithful, high-minded, yet tenderly sympathetic 
friends of their boys ? 

Angry punishments are always avoided by the best 
parents. Very few of us, while m our right minds, will 
fly at a child and give him furious, unexplamed blows. 
We should choose people of our own size for such out- 
breaks, and then we may possibly receive what we richly 
deserve in return. There are not many children that are 
improved by being whipped ; and angry whippings, such 
as are often given, lower and belittle the parent, and 
make him hateful, not only to the child, but to himself, 
if he has any conscience. There are ways of punishment 
that spare the self-respect and dignity of the child, pos- 
sessions to which he has a divine right, and at the same 
time detract nothing from the self-respect and dignity of 
the parent. 

, The child can be deprived, not of his supper, for that 
would be a physical injury, but of some special privilege 



208 FAEM HOMES, IX-DOORS AI^TD OUT-DOORS. 

or amusement, or to some expected good thing to which 
he was looking forward. Such a punishment is felt all 
through, is well remembered, and need not occur but 
rarely. 

Never put children into dark closets or cellars as a 
means of punishment. Nervous children have been per- 
manently injured by such stupid cruelty. Spare them as 
far as possible, all ghost-stories, practical " scares " and 
evil shocks of all kinds. 

Finally, since we cannot be perfect in any of the offices 
to which we are ''elected " in this life, since with earnest 
effort, and hour-by-hour striving, we can only not repeat 
the blunders and short-comings of yesterday, and try to 
make fewer to-day, let us be as just and gentle as we 
know how to be to the children who are with us now. 
And when moments come in which we almost forget our- 
selves, and give way to impatience and anger, and harsh 
vengeance that will leave their ugly shadows upon us, let 
us think how swiftly the years are bearing our children 
away 1 let us think how surely the time will come when, 
in the still, orderly autumn of life, we will be yearning 
to give all our possessions for one of those same hard- 
working, noisy, nerve-trying blessed old days with " The 
Children." 



CHAPTER XV. 
RULES FOR RIGHT LIVING. 

1. Keep the body clean. The countless pores of the 
skin are so many little dram-tiles for the refuse of the 
system. If they become clogged and so deadened in 
their action, we must expect to become the prey of iU- 
health in some one at its countless forms. Let us not 



BULES FOR RIGHT LIVII?"G. 209 

be afraid of a wet sponge and five minutes brisk exercise 
with a crash towel every night or morning. 

2. Devote eight hours out of the twenty-four to sleep. 
If a mother is robbed of sleep by a wakeful baby, she 
must take a nap sometime during the day. Even ten 
minutes of repose strengthens and refreshes, and does 
good *4ike a medicine." Children should be allowed to 
sleep until they awake of their own free will. 

3. Never go out to work in early morning in any 
locality subject to damps, fogs, and miasms, with an 
empty stomach. If there is not time to wait for a cup 
of coifee, pour two-thirds of a cup of boiling water 
on two teaspoonfuls of cream, or a beaten egg, season it 
with salt and pepper, and drink it while hot before going 
out. This will stimulate and comfort the stomach, and 
aid the system in resisting a poisonous or debilitating 
atmosphere. 

4. Avoid over-eating. To rise from the table able to 
eat a little more is a proverbially good rule for every one. 
There is nothing more idiotic than forcing down a few 
mouthfuls, because they happen to remain on one's 
plate, after hunger is satisfied, and because they may be 
"wasted" if left ! It is the most serious waste to over- 
tax the stomach with even half an ounce more than it 
can take care of. 

5. Avoid foods and drinks that plainly "disagree" 
with the system. Vigorous out-door workers should 
beware of heavy, indigestible suppers. Suppers should 
always consist of light, easily-digested foods, being, in 
the country, soon followed by sleep, and the stomach 
bemg as much entitled as the head to profound rest. 
The moral pluck and firmness to take such food and no 
other for this last meal of the day can be easily acquired, 
and the reward of such virtue is sound sleep, a clear 
head, a strong hand, and a capital appetite for breakfast. 



210 FAKM HOMES, IX-DOORS AND OUT-DOOES. 

6. Never wear at night the undergarments that are 
worn through the day. 

7. Cultivate sunlight and fresh air. Farmers' wives 
''fade" sooner than city women, not alone because they 
work harder and take no care of themselves, but because 
they stay so closely in-door s, and have no work or re- 
creation that takes them out into the open sunlight. It 
is a singular fact that women in crowded cities generally 
get more sunshine and pure air than their hived up 
country sisters. 

8. Have something for the mind to feed upon, some- 
thing to look forward to and live for, beside the round 
of daily labor or the counting of profit and loss. If we 
have not any talent for writing splendid works on politi- 
cal economy or social science, or the genius of creating a 
good story or a fine poem, the next best thing, and in 
fact almost as good a thing, is to possess an appreciation 
of these things ! So have good books and good news- 
papers, and read them, if only in snatches, and talk about 
them at dinner-time or by the evening fire. Cultivate 
choice flowers and fruits, and help some poor neighbor 
to seeds and cuttings, or take an interest in bees, or fine 
poultry, or trout culture. And study always farm and 
household science, and take advantage of the new and 
helpful things that are every little while coming to light. 

9. Live in Peace ! Fretting, worrying, fault-finding, 
borrowing trouble, giving away to temper, and holding 
long, bitter grudges, all those things affect the liver, 
poison the blood, enlarge the spleen, carve ugly lines on 
the face, and shorten life ! Try to be half as wise at that 
little creature, the bee, who takes all the honey she can 
find, and leaves the poisons to themselves.
