PREFACE 

This book of Southern recipes and many contributed 
by friends in other sections of the country, is designed 
to meet the demand of numberless friends whom it 
has been my good fortune and pleasure to teach 
during my tours through the United States. 

It has been a great pleasure and gratification to me 
to see the growth of interest in cookery and house- 
hold efficiency. Fifty years ago, women of refinement 
were prone to declare almost boastingly that they 
had never cooked a meal in their lives, and today 
we note with interest their granddaughters cooking 
wholesome meals without becoming degraded in 
the work. 

These recipes have been tested and changed to meet 
the modern necessity for economy. 

I desire to thank the many housewives all over the 
country for the kindness and encouragement that 
have spurred me on to launching in the world my 
"mid-channel" effort.

Accurate measurements are necessary to uniform success 
in cookery. Standard measuring cups hold one-half pint. 
All measurements should be heaped up and leveled off with 
knife or spatula. All dry ingredients should be sifted before 
measured and put in lightly, never packed. One-half spoon 
is measured by cutting lengthwise a spoon, and for one-fourth 
dividing that again.

CHAPTER I 

FOOD 

Anything taken into the body to repair waste, build mus- 
cle and tissue, or give heat and energy for the performance of 
functions of the body, may be called food. Food is taken raw 
and cooked, and cookery is simply the application of heat to 
kill bacteria, add flavor, and aid digestion. In applying heat, 
it is necessary to know just what changes are necessary to 
perfect the special food to the individual needs. 

The body is composed of about 16 different elements, as 
oxygen 62^%, hydrogen 10%, carbon 21^%, nitrogen 3%. 
Sulphur, silicon, iron, sodium, calcium, phosphorus, potassium, 
magnesia, fluorine, chlorine and iodine make up the remaining 
3%, and these are combined in an aggregation of cells, tissues, 
organs, muscle, blood and bone. The cells and tissues are 
being constantly worn out and new ones are built up to repair 
this waste out of food we eat. Food is made over in the body 
to form bone, nerve and blood, muscle and tissue. 

We divide food according to its function in the body; viz., 
proteins, carbohydrates, fats. Foods burn in the body by pro- 
cess of oxidation. Proteins contain carbon, oxygen, hydrogen, 
nitrogen, and sulphur; and we find these elements in meat, 
fish, eggs, milk, cheese, cereals, beans, peas, and lentils; and 
we find that proteins, water, and mineral matter build tissue 
and muscle and liberate heat and energy. 

Carbohydrates in form of sugars and starches yield heat 
and energy, but add little to the body weight. Carbohydrates 
contain oxygen, carbon and hydrogen, and these are found in 
maple, cane and beet sugar, honey, molasses and preserves, 
starch in potatoes, cereals, rice pastes and vegetables. 

Fats contain carbon, hydrogen and oxygen, and when 
burned in the body liberate heat and energy; this when not 
utilized in muscular exercise is stored in the body as adipose 
tissue. Nuts, oils, cream and butter produce fat. 

Complete food must contain in right proportions all the 
elements of which the tissues and all the fluids of the body 
are composed. Every element represented has a special need 
in the body and a deficiency of any one will cause an impair- 
ment. 



Food 

The foods are taken in the form of compounds; for instance, 
albumen is composed of carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, 
sulphur, phosphorus — and albumen enters into the structure 
of brain, nerves, muscles and blood. Fat, composed of 
oxygen, hydrogen and carbon, is found all over the body, 
covering the muscles, surrounding the internal organs. 

Sugar, composed of carbon, hydrogen and oxygen, is found 
in the blood, liver and tissues. Lime, composed of calcium 
and oxygen, is found in the bone, blood and nerve. Salt, com- 
posed of sodium and chlorine, is found in the tissues and fluids 
of the body. Iron is found in the haemoglobin of the red 
blood corpuscles. 

Food, raw or cooked, is taken into the body through the 
mouth and carried into the stomach and intestines, and meets 
within the body chemicals which convert the foods eaten into 
the elements required by the body. 

The well balanced menu contains the elements in proper 
proportion for the average family, and the housekeeper must 
take into consideration the season of year, exercise, individual 
health, predominating sex, etc., in selecting food. The hearty 
food sufficient for a farmer's family will be out of order for 
the family of a banker, not because the banker can afford more 
expensive food, but because on account of environment, 
occupation, etc., they require different food. 

Properly balanced meals will maintain a person in perfect 
health, provided sunshine, fresh air and water are plentifully 
supplied, and waste matter properly eliminated from the 
system. 

Meals should supply all the body needs and satisfy hunger. 
They should be attractive, appetizing and planned to demand 
no unusual serving. Cost should be borne in mind and an 
average maintained. The meal consisting of a few well pre- 
pared foods, well served, is worth more than a meal of many 
courses badly prepared and slovenly served. In giving menus 
we can only speak in general terms and the suggestions may 
be used to prepare menus with modifications as desired. 

BREAKFAST 

1. Fruit, fresh preferably, but canned, dried or concentrated will answer. 

2. Cereal — oatmeal, rice, grits, cream of wheat, best — can be varied by 

prepared breakfast foods occasionally. 

3. Protein food as eggs, fish, meat. Eggs are an ideal breakfast dish, and 

left-over meat can be utilized as hash. 

4. Bread in some form. Toast, biscuit, griddle cakes or waffles. 

5. Beverage for stimulation, cocoa, coffee or tea. 



Food 

LUNCH 

1. Cream soup. 

2. Protein food, chops, steak, macaroni and cheese, or a salad, 

3. Potatoes, rice or bread 

4. Beverage: tea, cocoa or milk. 

DINNER 

1. Clear soup, consomme or bouillon. 

2. Meat or fish. 

3. Potatoes or rice and one other vegetable. 

4. Salad: light salad with heavy dinner and more substantial where meat 

course is light. 

5. Dessert: when meat course is heavy, serve very light dessert. 

6. Tea or coffee. 

Many people find two meals sufficient for body needs, but 
three simple meals taken at regular intervals will be productive 
of good health and long life. Children easily digest and assim- 
ilate four meals a day. 



CHAPTER II 

LIVING ON THE BUDGET PLAN 

How to get life in its best sense out of our present income, 
is one of the questions of today, and has transferred the center 
of discussion from the field of production to the field of con- 
sumption, and it is the change which involves a revolution in 
the attitude of economics to the functions of woman. The 
factory may be the seat of production, but it is not true that 
only there are foods and comforts produced, nor is it strictly 
true that man is alone the producer. The home produces 
wealth, the work of cook and nurse and chambermaid is pro- 
duction. The food is worth more prepared for table than as 
brought from the store, etc., but it is true that man, on a 
large scale, is a producer, and woman defines how wealth shall 
be expended. 

Standard of living, and what life means to the individual, 
determines success. Every individual has his standard of 
decent living, good work, family pride, honesty, pleasure, etc., 
and it should be easy for each to define just what sort of stand- 
ard we have set for ourselves. Falling below this standard, 
ethically or economically, may be defined as unhappiness. 

Today many women are unhappy because they are dis- 
satisfied with being unequal to the successful administration 
of homes. If the dissatisfied housewife will stop and take an 
inventory of her assets and liabilities in the way of talents 
and inability — revise her home and adjust her knowledge — 
each will find some way to happiness and content. 

Economy, as applied to the home, means a plan for 
administration by which the resources of the home may be 
expended or distributed to the best advantage. It means 
arranging, proportioning, or expending, the family's resources 
of time, strength, knowledge, and money, so that the greatest 
possible harvest is reaped. 

Whatever the conditions of a family, wherever situated, 
it is a fact that the successful spending of money in acquiring 
needs and wants, depends more upon the brains than the 
dollars. Poverty and riches are but relative terms. Two women 
may be given £5Q.QQ each, and with this one can buy shelter 

4 



Living on the Budget Plan 

and food, while the other one will so adjust hers that with it 
she buys food, shelter, clothes and some of the attributes of 
higher life, and so she is richer than her neighbor. Standard 
of living will control as to how expenditures will be made. 

A business man runs his factory on a sound business basis, 
and his accounts will quickly show the disbursement of his 
income, and what percent is spent for operating, advertising, 
etc., and when the margin of profit is unsatisfactory, a study 
of statistics will point to a weak place. Disbursements will 
be properly adjusted, and the manufacturer starts out with 
renewed courage. 

This is just the sort of management that makes the house 
a successful business. To make proper divisions of income 
depends so largely on circumstances, that I can only deal with 
it in a general way. 

Division of Income 

Twenty-five percent for food, twenty percent for rent, 
fifteen percent for operating expenses, fifteen percent for 
clothes and twenty-five percent for higher life — education, 
benevolence, entertainments, and savings. If it varies too 
greatly in any division, that class of expenditure should be 
analyzed so as to find the trouble and remove the cause. 
Sometimes the divisions will be improper. 

As the income of a family increases, a smaller percentage 
will be expended for food. 

As the income of a family increases, the percentage of 
expenditure for clothing remains approximately the same. 

As the income of a family increases, the percentage for 
shelter and fuel remains the same. 

As the income increases, a constantly increasing percent- 
age will be spent for education, health, recreation, which we 
group as higher life. 

We find the retail cost of foods steadily rising and it has 
for twenty years. Our incomes do not correspondingly in- 
crease, and with this steady rise on the one side, we find more 
and more of this fixed amount of money has to go for food, 
leaving less for the balance of expenses. We have to re- 
adjust the expenditure so that we still get out of it those 
things which mean our better life, and still save for the day 
when we should rest from our labor. 



CHAPTER III 

KITCHEN CONVENIENCES 

The successful business man has the proper equipment for 
factory, store and office; the successful farmer has up-to-date 
machinery and implements for accomplishing results with a 
view to saving time and labor. The dissatisfied housekeeper 
is usually the one who needs must spend most of her time in 
accomplishing her kitchen duties, leaving no time for equally 
important and more interesting tasks. 

The illogical training of our girls in the past has made the 
furnishing of the kitchen the last consideration in equipping a 
home. With the introduction of Home Economics in our 
schools, has come a change, and today the housewife has all 
the necessary equipment in the best manner her means afford 
and gets satisfaction out of a systematized household. 

The efficient workman has his shop arranged with a view 
of saving steps, and as important to the woman is a study of 
kitchen arrangement, relative position of kitchen machinery, 
viz., stove, sink, work table, cupboard and cabinet, so that as 
little walking as possible will be necessary in preparation of 
meals or cleaning up afterward. 

Ideal kitchens differ with architecture of house. The best 
kitchens have cupboards, etc., built in so that much floor space 
is saved. Where this was not thought of ahead, the kitchen 
will require to be about 10 x 12. A large sink and hot and 
cold water faucets, with an adjustable draining board, that 
may be fastened to wall when not in use, will be found most 
convenient. The stove is probably the most important factor 
in pleasure of kitchen work. There is never any economy in 
buying a cheap stove; facility of heating and regulating and 
ease with which it is cleaned, and the convenience of ovens are 
the things to consider. Nickel trimmings and gingerbread 
work on stoves add to their cost, count for nothing in general 
utility and demand much care to keep them in good appear- 
ance. The ovens should be at a height that will not demand 
reaching or stooping. 

A good tireless cooker is an economy of time and fuel. 
Cheaper cuts of meat foods that require long cooking will be 

6 



Kitchen Conveniences 

found possible without constant watching. The whole meal 
may be prepared in the cooker while the housekeeper sews or 
reads. 

Things to Remember in Buying Cooker. 

A cheap cooker is an extravagance, as poor results tend to 
dissatisfy the cook. A metal body cooker will assure against 
fire. Seamless aluminum wells wear longer and are easily 
kept clean. I use a thin steel radiator manufactured by the 
Diller Manufacturing Company of Bluffton, which heats most 
readily, requiring less than 10 minutes gas flame for perfect 
roasting heat and retaining that heat the desired length of 
time. These will be more popular than soapstone radiators, 
as less care is required to keep them in good condition. An 
adjustable valve for the escape of surplus steam is necessary for 
good baking. When not in use leave cooker open and often put 
the radiators in strong sunshine to air. 

The work table should be strong and covered with some 
material that requires no great energy to keep clean. White 
enameled tables cost more initially but pay in the end. The 
tin or zinc-top table is excellent and in case it is necessary to 
use an ordinary oilcloth-covered table, linoleum cut to fit and 
securely tacked will be more economical and more satisfactory. 
Much backache may be attributed to the height of a work 
table, and a little care given to this particular is necessary. 
Strong casters adjusted to the work table will allow it to be 
moved according to desire. When well planned cupboards 
are lacking, the kitchen cabinet will be found indispensable. 
Here there is a place for everything and a few minutes taken 
to replace utensils in their respective places, assure the cook 
an easy task in preparing the next meal. 

A good supply of utensils is necessary and there is no 
economy in cheap utensils. Aluminum and heavy white 
enamel are in the long run very satisfactory. Seamless mixing 
bowls with no sharp corners for holding batters, doughs, etc., 
save much time in washing. Steel wool and Ivory Soap will 
be found the best cleansing agencies for aluminum. 

Well defined menus planned for the day, and supplies 
ordered early in the morning, thereby insuring a prompt 
delivery, mean a good start. When entering the kitchen the 
housewife should have a definite knowledge of the process 
involved and order of procedure. The first step should be 
regarding fire if coal or wood is used, and while the stove is 

7 



Kitchen Conveniences 

heating supplies can be taken out and placed in order. Cook 
according to schedule for each dish, so that there will be no 
confusion or waiting on a dish for any course. After a meal is 
served dishes should be removed, bits of food and articles of 
grease removed with soft paper. If the dishes are washed 
immediately, the dining room and kitchen put to rights, much 
less time will be consumed in this work. 

As far as possible work by schedule, but don't worry when 
something unexpected interferes with the schedule. Some 
too conscientious housekeepers keep busy all the time, doing 
many unnecessary things. Decide just what must be done to 
make the family comfortable, and prorate the duties to 
the members, and duties that may be eliminated mean just 
that much time for rest, recreation and study for the house- 
wife. This is most important and on it depends the success- 
ful administration of the home. 

RULES FOR KITCHEN EFFICIENCY 

1. Conveniently arranged kitchen. 

2. Convenient utensils of best make. 

3. Elimination of everything unnecessary or decorative in kitchen. 

4. Well defined menus, and supplies ordered in time. 

5. Preparation for meals — get out all supplies and prepare in the order of 

their serving (length of time for cooking taken into consideration). 

6. Serving meals and washing dishes, putting to rights the dining room and 

kitchen without delay. 

7. Eliminate every unnecessary duty. 

8. Realization of importance of rest and improvement as an incentive for 

expedition in necessary work. 



CHAPTER IV 

SOUPS 

Soups are divided into two classes: soups with stock, and 
soups without stock. 

Soups made with stock have as foundation beef, veal, 
mutton, fish, and poultry, and are classified as: 

(1) Bouillon, lean beef seasoned and strained. 

(2) Consomme, with several different kinds of meats, highly 
seasoned, with vegetables and spices, and strained. 

(3) Soup stock, made from beef, vegetables and spices. 

(4) White stock soup, made from chicken, veal, or mutton, 
with delicate seasoning, rice or macaroni. 

Cream soups, made of vegetables and white sauce com- 
bined with milk or cream. 

Purees, made usually from vegetables (fish sometimes used) 
forced through a strainer and retained in milk or white sauce. 

Bisques, made from shellfish seasoned and milk or cream 
added. 

Clear soups are served for dinner, where they act as stimu- 
lants and expand the stomach to accommodate the full dinner. 

Cream soups sometimes separate, and paste made from 
butter and flour is added to boiling stock or milk and is called 
the binder. 

Stock for Bouillon 

3 lbs. lean beef (shin bone) 2 c. vegetables cut in dice, tur- 

\yi qts. cold water nip, onion, celery, carrot in

kettle with cold water and let stand ]/ 2 hour, at which time 
add browned cubes and bring gradually to boiling point. 
Skim often, for short time. Cover and cook slowly for 4 
hours, simmering. Add vegetables the last hour; strain and 
cool.

pints, strain. 

To Clear Soup 

Remove fat from stock and put amount to be cleared in a 
saucepan, allowing the white and shell of 1 egg to each quart. 
Mix egg and shell with the cool soup stock, adding more 
seasoning if needed; beat well and set on stove over a medium 
flame. Stir until hot, to keep egg from settling. Let it boil 

2 minutes; then lower the flame so that it will just simmer for 
10 minutes. Remove scum and strain through a double 
thickness of cheesecloth over a fine wire strainer. The albu- 
men in egg and meat draws to itself the juices extracted from 
the meat and which have coagulated.

CHAPTER V 

FISH 

Fish, with the exception of salmon, mackerel, and eels, will 
be found very easily digested, giving to brain workers and 
those of sedentary habits proteins in easily digested forms, and 
in many parts of our country, it is more economical than meat. 
Fish is less nutritious and stimulating than meat. Fish has 
often been called brain food, not because it contains large 
portions of phosphorus, an element found abundantly in nerve 
tissue, but because of the ease with which it is digested. 

Boiling and baking are the best methods to employ in 
cooking fish. Fish if lacking in fat may be fried or boiled. 
Before purchasing, examine the fish. The eyes and gills 
should be bright and the flesh firm. Fish should never be 
put in a refrigerator, as the strong odor contaminates delicate 
foods. When it is necessary to store in a general refrigerator, 
place in a covered pail. 

How to Bake Fish 

Have a good-sized whitefish well cleaned, stufF and sew 
up the opening; brush over with butter and dredge with flour, 
sprinkle with salt and pepper, place around the fish slices of 
pork and lay in a baking pan with a little water. Allow IS 
minutes to the pound and baste frequently. Serve with sauce 
and garnish with lemon and parsley. 

How to Broil Fish 

Always have a tin sheet for lifting and turning broiled 
fish. Before broiling rub with salt and pepper, and then 
grease with crisco. Lay the fish on the gridiron, well greased, 
and lay the tin sheet over it. When you wish to turn, take 
the gridiron from the fire, holding the tin sheet on the fish. 
Hold them together, then lay them on a table with the tin 
sheet down and the gridiron uppermost. Carefully raise 
the gridiron, leaving the fish lying unbroken on the tin sheet. 
It is easy now to slide the fish back on the gridiron, put it 
again on the fire and brown the other side, putting the tin 
sheet back on top of it. When done lay it on a dish and pour 
over it melted butter, in which have been stirred pepper, salt 
and minced parsley.

Fish 

Fillet of Trout 

Wipe each piece of fish with a damp cloth, then coat with 
beaten eggs (diluted with water) and seasoned bread crumbs. 
Place in frying basket and cook in deep crisco. Slices of other 
fish may be cooked in the same way to perfection. 

Fried Halibut 

For frying, the fish should be a little over yZ inch thick. 
Wash, dry well, dip first in flour which has been seasoned, 
then in egg, and then in bread crumbs or cracker dust, which 
must also be salted. Fry in deep hot crisco 20 minutes. This 
kind of fish can be served hot or cold. 

Baked Haddock 

About 4 pounds is a good size to bake. Clean fish, sprinkle 
with salt, stuff" and stew. Cut four or five slits each side the 
backbone and insert narrow strips of fat salt pork. Place in 
pan, sprinkle with a few grains of pepper, brush over with 
melted butter, dredge with flour, and place around fish small 
bits of pork. Bake 1 hour in a medium oven, basting every 
10 minutes. In case fish seems to bake too fast, lower the 
flame. Serve with drawn butter or hollandaise sauce.

Planked Fish 

When using a gas range, one is enabled to serve planked 
shad or whitefish, delicacies which only the possessors of gas 
ranges can indulge in. 

Have a piece of hardwood (oak or hickory) about \}4 
inches thick and as large as your broiling oven will accom- 
modate, made expressly for planking. Have both sides planed 
very smooth so that it may be easily cleaned. 

Prepare the fish by splitting down the back and cleaning 
carefully. About 10 minutes before it is needed place the 
plank in the heated broiling oven; when well heated through 
remove and place the fish upon it, skin-side down. Sprinkle 
with salt and pepper, and baste lightly with melted butter and 
lemon juice. 

Run the plank into the broiling oven so that the fish will 
come about 6 inches from the flame, which should be a moder- 
ate one. Allow it to remain until a nice brown and tender, 
which usually requires from IS to 20 minutes. Watch care- 
fully, and if there seems danger of scorching, reduce the flame 
or move the tray one slide lower down. 

When done (which may be ascertained with a silver fork), 
remove from the oven, baste again with melted butter, gar- 
nish with lemon and parsley. Arrange the plank on a tray 
and send at once to the table. Never use any soap or alkali 
in cleaning the plank, which should be carefully covered when 
not in use, to prevent dust from settling on it.

CHAPTER VII 

MEATS 

Meat is one of the most important articles of diet, and of 
all meats beef is the most nutritious. It is composed of fibrin, 
albumen, gelatin, fat, mineral salts and water. It is necessary 
to know something of the divisions of a side of beef, and to 
apply proper methods of cooking to attain good results from 
different cuts. The expensive cuts come from that part of 
beef where muscles are little used and, therefore, we find meat 
fine grained and tender. These cuts require less time for 
cooking. 

Best beef is secured from cattle 4 or 5 years old, and flesh 
should be firm, fine grained, bright red, or with goodly quantity 
of fat. Cold storage beef, or that which has hung 4 or 5 
weeks, is best. Remove meat as soon as delivered, wipe with 
clean, damp cloth, wrap loosely in oil paper and place in re- 
frigerator. Never wash meat. To do so withdraws the juices. 

In soup making, cover the meat with cold water and allow 
to heat gradually, simmering for a long time till the meat is left 
tasteless. Cheaper cuts, flank, round, rump, ribs, brisket and 
neck, are equally rich in nutriment, but require long, slow cook- 
ing to render them digestible and bring out the flavor. Roast- 
ing and broiling methods that develop a fine and distinctive 
flavor can be applied to expensive or tender cuts. Liver, 
heart and kidneys are of close texture and very difficult to 
digest. Tripe, or the lining of the first stomach, is easily 
digested, but on account of the large amount of fat not 
desirable. 

Boiled meat is prepared by placing it in boiling water and 
allowing to boil for 5 minutes; the juices on the outer surface 
are quickly coagulated and the inner juices prevented from 
escaping. The temperature is reduced and held at simmering 
point: this preserves flavor and nutriment. 

Broiled steaks should be cut at least 1 inch in thickness 
and may be cut 2 inches; the steak should be wiped with 
damp cloth, and trimmed of bone and skin. Porterhouse and 
sirloins are tender and full of flavor, but they are expensive 
on account of loss of bone, fat, etc. 

38 



Meats 

Broiled Steak and Chops 

Sirloin, porterhouse, cross-cut of rump and top of the round 
are all good cuts of steak. The steak should be cut at least 
one inch thick. Wipe with a cloth wrung out of cold water, 
and remove superfluous fat. Place steak, or chops, on grill 
of broiler. Use highest flame. Remove steak to a hot platter, 
spread with butter, and sprinkle with salt and pepper. Have 
broiler oven well heated, turn often. Season after cooked. 

Start lamb or mutton chops the same way; then lower the 
flame and finish cooking. Season chops with salt and pepper 
after serving. 

The time required for broiling steak, chops, etc., varies 
from 17 to 25 minutes, according to the thickness of the meat. 

Roast Beef 

For roasting the best cuts are top or middle of sirloin, back 
of rump or first three ribs. Wipe meat, put on a rack in 
dripping pan, skin side down, in a very hot oven without salt 
or water; let it remain until seared, then reduce heat. Season 
meat with salt, dredge meat with flour and return it to oven. 
When flour in pan is browned, reduce heat, baste every 10 
minutes with the fat in the pan. If necessary, a small quantity 
of water may be added. When about cooked, turn meat over 
and dredge with flour for final browning. 

Roast Beef Gravy 

Remove all but 3 tablespoons of fat from the pan. Place 
over flame and add 3 tablespoons flour, stirring until well 
browned. Add gradually \y£ cups boiling water, cook 5 
minutes, season with salt and pepper, and strain. 

Pot Roast I 

Melt in a hot frying pan a tablespoon crisco; while very 
hot put in roast and brown it on all sides by rolling it over in 
the pan. Do not insert a fork, as that will cause juices to 
escape. Put browned meat in a kettle, preferably an iron pot, 
which has been heated; put water in frying kettle to obtain any 
juice which may have escaped, and pour over the meat. Cover 
closely and place over flame until boiling point is reached; 
then simmer and cook slowly 3 hours, turning meat occasion- 
ally. Keep about 1 cup of water under meat, and IS minutes 
before removing from kettle, sprinkle over the meat a little 
flour and salt. Remove meat and thicken gravy. Browned 

39 



Meats 

potatoes may be served with a pot roast. Boil either white 
or sweet potatoes until nearly done, roll in flour and place in 
gravy in the kettle after meat has been removed; when well 
browned, remove them and place them in a hot oven while 
the gravy is being thickened. 

Pot Roast II 

Wipe the meat with a damp cloth and put into an iron pot 
with a little fat. Place over a moderate heat and brown slowly, 
turning it frequently; this will take about 20 minutes. When 
the roast is well browned, season with salt and pepper, put in 

1 cupful of boiling water, cover closely, and set the pot back 
where the meat will cook slowly. As the water evaporates add 
a little more, j4 cupful at a time. Allow 25 minutes to each 
pound. Take up the meat, and add a small quantity of water 
to the juices in the pot. Thicken the gravy with a little flour 
stirred to a thin paste with a little water, and serve in a gravy 
boat.

CHAPTER VIII 

POULTRY AND GAME 

To determine the age of poultry, examine the feet and 
cartilage at the end of the breastbone. If both are soft it is 
a young chicken; if hard, a fowl of more than a year's age. 

To prepare a bird for cooking, singe it by holding over a 
flame and turning it until hairs are removed. Remove pin 
feathers. Cut the skin around the leg an inch and a half 
below the leg joint, taking care not to cut the tendons, then 
place leg at that point over the edge of a board or table and 
snap the bone; then pull off foot and tendons. In a fowl 
tendons may have to be pulled one at a time. Make a cut 
below the breastbone and remove the entrails, heart, gizzard 
and liver. Remove gall bladder from liver. Remove the 
lungs from either side of backbone and the kidneys, which lie 
near the hollow. Remove windpipe from neck and crop. Cut 
off the neck close to the body, leaving the skin. Remove oil- 
bag. Wash outside carefully and run water through the 
inside to cleanse it. The heart, liver and gizzard are called 
giblets. Remove veins and blood from heart and fat and 
membrane from gizzard. Cut through the thick part of 
gizzard and remove the part inside. Wash giblets and neck 
and cook together in a little water. 

Roast Chicken 

Having dressed a chicken, stuff it. Truss it by crossing 
the drumsticks, tying them with a long string and then 
tying to the tail. Fasten the wings close to the body with 
a skewer and draw the skin at the neck under the back 
and pin with another skewer. Then turn the bird on its 
breast and draw string which is fastened to tail around skewers, 
fasten it and cut it. Rub chicken with salt and rub breast 
and legs with butter and flour worked together. Place in 
pan and sprinkle bottom of pan with flour. Place in oven 
over a medium flame till flour is browned. Then lower the 
oven and baste often. Melt butter half the size of an egg in 
24 cup hot water and use it for basting while it lasts. Then 
use fat in the pan. Turn bird occasionally that it may brown 
alike on all sides. Cook until breast meat is tender,

Chicken a la Stanley 

When the chicken has been cut up, season the pieces with 
salt and pepper. Place them in a shallow saucepan in which 
you have heated 2 tablespoonfuls of crisco. As soon as the 
meat has begun to cook, but has not taken a color, add 3 
medium-sized onions, chopped fine, and a tablespoonful of 
curry. Cover the saucepan and let it cook on a very gentle 
fire. As soon as the pieces of chicken are cooked remove them 
and put them in a deep earthenware dish, or any other suitable 
deep dish. Keep the chicken hot and add to the onions which 
have remained in the saucepan a glass of fresh cream. Let 
this simmer for 7 to 8 minutes and then pass the mixture 
through a strainer and put it into another saucepan. Heat 
this puree well and pour it over the chicken. 

Some truffles peeled with care and cut in slices may be added 
to the sauce, and will greatly increase the richness of the dish. 

Chicken Stewed with Dumplings 

Cut up and lay in salt and water, then put on the fire with 
water enough to cover and some slices of bacon. 

When the chicken is thoroughly tender, put in some dump- 
lings, made like biscuit but rolled thinner. Lay them over 
the top of the stew and cover tightly, boil until done — about 
IS minutes. 

Mix a tablespoonful of crisco in a tablespoonful of flour, or 
less if not liked very thick; add salt and pepper to taste, a 
little parsley and celery, or celery seed. Put this in the gravy 
and when it has thickened pour in a teacupful of cream or 
milk and let it boil up once. Take off the fire and serve hot. 

How to Cook a Turkey 

A turkey should be killed at least two or three days before 
cooking. This can be easily done, as the turkey season 
always begins the last of November and ends the latter part 
of the winter. Wash thoroughly when ready to cook, not 
before, as they are not apt to keep after having water used 
about them. After they have been washed, dry with a cloth, 
rub a little butter over them, salt and pepper, and sift a little 
flour over them to make brown nicely. Some hot water should 
be put in the pan, with salt and pepper and a little butter to 
use for basting.

Poultry and Game 

The stuffing is a matter of taste, for, although chestnuts 
are the regulation stuffing for Thanksgiving Day, some prefer 
a little onion, oysters, etc. One thing should be observed, 
however, never to fill a fowl entirely full, as the bread that is 
used always swells, and consequently the stuffing is pasty. 

Chestnut Stuffing for the Thanksgiving Turkey 

Shell SO chestnuts, blanch them and boil in salted water 
until tender; chop fine and mix with half the amount of bread 
crumbs, season highly with salt and pepper, and moisten with 
melted butter. 

Roast Turkey 

Dress the turkey carefully and rub thoroughly inside and 
out with salt and pepper. Stuff with a dressing prepared as 
follows: take a loaf of stale bread, cut off crust and soften by 
placing in a pan, pouring on warm water (never boiling), squeez- 
ing out with the hand all the water; add yi pound of melted 
butter and a teaspoon of salt and ]4 teaspoon of pepper; drain 
off liquor from a quart of oysters, bring to a boil, skim, and 
pour over the bread crumbs; mix all thoroughly and, if dry, 
moisten with a little sweet milk; [lastly, add the oysters, being 
careful not to break them. 

Sew up the openings, spread the turkey over with butter, 
salt and pepper, place in a dripping-pan in a well heated oven, 
add yi. pint of hot water, and roast, basting often. Turn until 
nicely browned on all sides, and about yi. hour before it is done, 
baste with butter and dredge with a little flour. 

When making the gravy, if there is much fat in the pan 
pour off most of it and add the chopped giblets previously 
boiled until tender, and the liquor in which they were cooked; 
place 1 heaping tablespoon of flour in a pint cup, mix smooth 
with a little cream; fill up cup with rich milk, and add to the 
gravy in the pan; boil several minutes, stirring constantly, 
and pour into sauce bowl. Serve with cranberry sauce. 

Roast Goose 

Singe, draw, wash, stuff and truss a goose. Dredge with 
flour and salt, and lay strips of fat pork over the breast. Roast 
in a hot oven 2 hours, basting frequently with butter and hot 
water. 

56 



Poultry and Game 

Stuffing 

Chop finely 2 onions, mix with J4 cupful of finely chopped 
pork, and combine with 2 cupfuls of hot mashed potato and 
\yi cupfuls of soft, stale bread crumbs. Add y£ cupful of 
butter, 1 beaten egg, \yi teaspoonfuls of salt, 1 teaspoonful 
of sage, and yi teaspoonful of black pepper. 

Russian Apple Stuffing for Roast Goose 

Chop 2 cupfuls of tart apples, greenings or Baldwins pre- 
ferred, with 1 cupful of seeded raisins. Stuff goose and truss 
as usual. The flavor is delicious and quite different. 

Grouse 

Pluck with care not to tear the skin. Draw and wipe, but 
do not wash. Cut off the head and truss like fowl. They 
are much improved by larding, but if that is not convenient 
fasten thin slices of salt pork all over the breast and thighs. 
Baste every 5 minutes. About 10 minutes before taking up 
lay a thick slice of toast under each and serve on this. Fry 
coarse bread crumbs till brown in butter and strew them 
on the platter or over the bird. Send either bread sauce or 
brown gravy to table with them. The Scotch fashion is to 
put 3 tablespoons of butter into each bird instead of larding it. 
Parboil the liver and pound it to a paste with butter, salt and 
cayenne and use this to spread on the toast on which the birds 
are to be served. 

Potted Grouse 

Prepare as if for roasting; season rather highly and put 
plenty of butter inside, pack them in a deep pie-dish and dot 
butter on top. Pour over a small glass of claret for each pair 
of birds and tie two or three folds of buttered paper over. 
Bake in a moderate oven 1 hour. Pack them by twos in small 
pots, cover with clarified butter and set away to keep till 
wanted. They will keep for three or four weeks and are 
excellent for breakfast or lunch. 

Fillets of Grouse 

If the birds are badly shot to pieces or much disfigured in 

dressing, it is sometimes better to serve them filleted. After 

they have been removed separate the large from the small 

fillet. Season them with salt and pepper and dip them in a 

6 57 



Poultry and Game 

mixture of 1 tablespoon chopped parsley, 1 tablespoon lemon 
juice and }4 cup melted butter. Let the butter cool on them, 
then dip in a beaten egg, then in bread crumbs and fry in deep, 
hot fat. Six minutes is enough for the large. 

Canvas-back, Red-head and Mallard 

Should be carefully picked, singed, drawn and wiped with a 
wet cloth, trussed with the neck twisted around to close the 
opening in the breast, and the rump turned down to close the 
opening through which it was drawn. Season with salt and 
roast rare from 18 to 25 minutes. Place them on a hot dish 
and put a tablespoon of cold water inside to prevent the 
coagulation of the juice. Send a glass of currant jelly or wild 
plum jelly to table with it, or serve with essence of celery. 

Red-head, Teal or Widgeon Broiled 

After cleaning, split down the back and flatten a little with 
a heavy cleaver. Pare off the neck, pinions and ends of the 
legs, baste well with butter and broil rare over a quick fire. 
Dish on dry toast. Melt 2 tablespoons of maitre d'hotel 
butter with a little brown gravy, pour it over the ducks and 
serve with any sharply acid jelly, or orange, or olive sauce. 

Teal 

Teal when roasted sometimes has a plain, dry stuffing as for 
chicken. Sometimes it is filled with a chopped onion and 
celery stuffing. Serve with slices of fried hominy and water- 
cress or with green grape jelly. 

Fillets of Widgeon 

Roast quick and rare 4 widgeons; slip off the fillets with 
a sharp knife, lay them on pieces of buttered toast and place 
in a dish sprinkled with Parmesan cheese; place 2 fillets of 
anchovy on each fillet of duck, sprinkle with more cheese, 
grated bread crumbs, chopped parsley and melted butter. 
Bake in very hot oven about 2 minutes. Squeeze the juice 
of 2 lemons over and serve hot. 

Chicken, Southern Style 

Disjoint "frying size" chicken night before using. Let 
stand in cold water for hour before cooking. When ready to

flour. Dip in well beaten egg, roll in cracker or toast crumbs, 
fry in deep fat. Place in dripping-pan and cover, place in

become crisp and brown. If desired, pour the cream gravy 
over chicken on chop dish or serve separately in gravy boat. 
Delicious. 

Fried Chicken, Virginia Style 

Clean a fat young chicken and disjoint it as for a fricassee. 
Wipe, dredge with salt, pepper and flour and spread out on a 
platter. In a deep frying-pan try out }4 pound of fat bacon, 
add 1 cupful of crisco; when hot put in the pieces of chicken, 
cooking only enough at one time to allow plenty of room for 
turning over. As fast as nicely colored lift from the pan to a 
platter, set where the chicken will keep hot. When all of the 
chicken is cooked, pour off the greater part of the fat, leaving 
about 2 tablespoonfuls in the pan. Dredge in sufficient flour 
to absorb the grease, stir until browned, then add gradually 
1 pint of milk and cook until thick and smooth. Season to 
taste, carefully lay in the fried chicken and simmer for 3 
minutes, then dish and serve.

Tartare Chicken 

Have three chickens, each weighing about 4 pounds. Split 
them down the back, as for broiling. Singe them, and then 
wipe with a clean towel. Dredge generously with salt and 
lightly with pepper. Lay them on a board, the split side 
down, and then press the legs upon the body. Skewer 
them in this position, using long steel skewers. Skewer the 
wings in place also. Now spread the breast, wings and 
legs thickly with soft butter; sprinkle with a thick layer of 
dried, pounded and sifted bread crumbs. Place them in a 
large dripping-pan, split side down, being careful not to disturb 
the crumbs. Set away in a cool place. When it is time to 
cook them place in a hot oven and cook SO minutes. After 
they have been cooking IS minutes reduce the heat. When 
they are done take out the skewers and place the chickens on 
a large platter. Garnish with parsley and serve with tartare 
sauce. Remember that after the chickens have been put in 
the pan nothing is done except to put them in the oven. The 
chickens should be cooked early in the day, if the oven cannot 
be spared at dinner time, and then heated when wanted. 

Fried Chicken 

Select young, tender chickens and disjoint. Wash care- 
fully, dry, and let stand over night in refrigerator. Then 
cook by one of the following methods : 



Drain the chicken but do not wipe dry. Season with salt 
and white pepper and dredge well with flour. Fry in deep 
crisco hot enough to brown a crumb of bread in 60 seconds. 
It will require from 10 to 12 minutes to fry chicken. Drain 
on paper and place in oven or warmer until ready to serve. 
Place on platter garnished with parsley and rice croquettes.

but do not dry. Dip each joint separately in batter and fry in 
deep crisco until a golden brown. It should take from 10 to 
12 minutes. Serve on a folded napkin, garnished with parsley. 



Drain chicken but do not wipe dry. Season with salt and 
pepper and dredge well with flour. Put 3 tablespoonfuls 
crisco in frying pan and when hot place chicken in pan, cover 
and allow chicken to steam for 10 minutes. Remove the cover 
from the pan and allow the chicken to brown, taking care to 
turn frequently. Serve on platter, garnish with parsley, and 
serve with cream gravy. 

Creamed Chicken 

2 tb. flour \yi t. onion juice 

2 tb. crisco 1 tb. Worcestershire sauce 

2 c. hot sweet milk 2 c. tender chicken, chopped fine 

Rub crisco and flour together. Add to hot milk and stir in 
double boiler until thick. Season with salt, white pepper, a 
dash of paprika and the onion juice and Worcestershire sauce. 
Add chicken and remove to back of range. Allow chicken to 
stand 20 minutes to ripen and serve in rice border on toast, in 
timbale molds, or fill a hollow loaf of bread. 

Chicken Souffle 

Make 2 cups of cream sauce and season with chopped 
parsley and onion juice. Stir 2 cups of chopped chicken into 
the sauce. When hot, add the beaten yolks of 4 eggs; cook 1 
minute and set away to cool; when cool, stir in the whites, 
beaten stiff. Bake in a buttered dish about 20 minutes and 
serve immediately. Any meat may be substituted for chicken. 

Chicken Livers 

Take chicken livers which have been stewed gently in 
butter and a little water in the morning, and cut into small, 
even squares. Mix with }4 pound of butter, the yolks of 3 
hard-boiled eggs, put into the chafing dish and add seasoning 
of salt, a very little cayenne pepper, and a pinch of dry mus- 
tard. When heated, put in the livers and part of a can of

Fricassee of Chicken 

Disjoint a good-sized chicken, season with salt and pepper 
and saute in hot crisco, frying to a delicate brown. Remove 
to a saucepan in which 1 tablespoon of flour and 1 tablespoon 
crisco have been blended, and to which add 1 tablespoon 
finely minced onion, 1 tablespoon parsley chopped fine, }4 
button garlic and 1 teaspoon chili powder, and cook for few 
minutes, stirring well and adding gradually 1 quart of water. 
Simmer for $4 hour or until chicken is tender. One tomato 
chopped fine, or a can of mushrooms, may be added to the 
above with good effects. 

Rice and Chicken a la Valenciana 

Fry in hot fat to a golden brown a chicken cut in pieces 
When half fried add a peeled button of garlic and onion 
chopped fine and 1 teaspoon of salt. With this is served rice 
prepared as follows: Take 1 cupful of rice well washed, 
a scant teaspoonful of salt, 3 cupfuls of boiling water and 
a small spoonful of crisco. The rice should be washed in 
cold water until all cloudiness is removed, for which five 
or six waters will be necessary. While washing bring to a 
boiling point 3 cups of water, add a teaspoonful of salt 
and a small spoonful of butter. When water is boiling add 
the rice and let boil from 10 to IS minutes, keeping the 
cover partially over. At the end of 15 minutes the water 
should be absorbed and the grains of rice soft and separated 
instead of the soggy mass so often seen. Remove the cover 
and let the rice dry in the pot for about 5 minutes, then place 
on the back of the stove and continue the drying out for 
about 20 or 30 minutes longer. A couple of large, sweet 
green Spanish peppers may be added to the rice while it is 
still boiling. 

Chicken Croquettes 

Open a can of chicken some hours before using if fresh 
chicken is not at hand. Chop the meat fine, seasoning it 
with celery salt and white pepper. Cook together in a sauce- 
pan a tablespoonful, each, of butter and flour, and when they 
thoroughly blend pour upon them a cup of rich milk — part 
cream if you have it — to which a pinch of baking soda has 
been added. Stir to a smooth white sauce, then add the 

64 



Poultry and Game 

minced chicken, season to taste, adding a pinch of nutmeg and 
a dash of lemon juice. When the chicken is smoking hot add 
to it gradually a beaten egg and take from the fire. Set aside 
until cold, and form into croquettes of uniform size. Roll 
each of these in beaten egg, then in cracker dust and set in the 
ice-chest until they are very cold and the coating on them has 
stiffened. Fry in deep fat to a golden brown. Arrange on 
a platter and pour about the croquettes a white sauce into 
which a tablespoonful of minced parsley has been stirred. 

Scalloped Chicken 

Cut, not chop, 2 cups of chicken into small pieces. Make 
a white sauce as directed in the last recipe, adding to it a 
gill of oyster liquor. Butter a pudding dish and put in the 
bottom of it a layer of cut-up chicken, well seasoned, 
and scatter over this a layer of fine crumbs, then cover with the 
white sauce. Put in another layer of chicken, more crumbs 
and more sauce. Proceed in this way until all the ingredients 
are used. Sprinkle the surface of the scallop with fine crumbs, 
dot with bits of butter, and set in the oven. Cook until well 
browned. 

Chicken Salad 

Open a can of boneless chicken, or use 2 cups of boiled 
chicken, and turn the chicken into a bowl. Set this on the 
ice until chilled, first cutting the chicken into pieces yi inch 
square. Measure the amount of chicken and to 2 cups of it 
allow a generous cup of crisp celery cut into bits. Mix the 
chicken and the celery together, seasoning with salt, pepper 
and a French dressing. Line a salad bowl with lettuce 
leaves, put the salad into it and pour over all a good mayon- 
naise dressing. Garnish with slices of hard-boiled eggs. 

Chicken a la Normande 

Having cut up the chicken, season the pieces with salt and 
pepper and put them in a shallow saucepan in which you have 
heated 2 tablespoonfuls of crisco. As soon as the flesh begins 
to grow firm, but without taking color, add a large onion, 
chopped fine, and allow this to cook on a gentle fire for several 
minutes, the saucepan being covered. At the end of 8 or 10 

65 



Poultry and Game 

minutes cooking add a cup' of very fresh cream and finish 
cooking the chicken. When it is done to a turn arrange the 
pieces on a dish. If at this point the sauce appears too liquid, 
boil it down, then pass it through a fine strainer, after which 
you pour it over the chicken and serve. You may vary 
the flavor of this dish by adding some small mushrooms 
or sliced truffles. You may also add shrimp tails, artichoke 
bottoms or little sticks of cooked egg plant. You may even 
serve the chicken a la creme with hard-boiled eggs sliced t up. 

Curry of Chicken 

Cut up the chicken in rather small pieces, brown it gently 
in a saucepan in which you have previously heated 2 soup- 
spoonfuls of butter. Add an onion of good size, chopped fine, 
and as soon as the onion begins to take a good light brown 
color add a soupspoonful of curry and 2 tablespoonfuls of flour. 
Let the whole cook for several minutes, stirring frequently 
with a wooden spoon. When the ingredients are well cooked, 
add yi cup of hot water and a pinch of salt, cover the sauce- 
pan and let it cook on a gentle fire for IS or 20 minutes. Serve 
very hot and accompany it by a plate of rice, cooked simply 
in boiling water with salt for 16 or 18 minutes, and then drain.

CHAPTER IX 

EGGS 

Eggs contain all the elements in right proportion necessary 
for the support of the body, but their highly concentrated 
nutritive value renders it necessary to use them in connection 
with other foods containing starch, as potatoes or bread, in 
order to secure the necessary bulk. Nine eggs are equivalent 
to a pound of beef. 

They are easier to digest raw, and as albumen coagulates 
at a temperature of from 134 degrees to 160 degrees F., the 
importance of cooking at a low temperature to insure their 
easy digestion will be seen. 

Boiled Soft 

Into a saucepan of boiling water sufficient to cover them, 
dip carefully the number of eggs to be boiled. Cover sauce- 
pan and remove to back of range where they will keep the 
same temperature. Cook 8 minutes. 

To hard-boil follow same directions for 45 minutes, plunge 
into cold water to prevent discoloration. 

Scrambled Eggs, San Juan 

Mince 2 green peppers, 2 sweet red peppers, fry in butter 
10 minutes, add 1 tomato peeled and cut into quarters, salt 
and pepper. Let simmer for 10 minutes more. At the same 
time scramble your eggs and mix above preparation with them, 
serve on toast with a little tomato sauce around it. 

Shirred Eggs a la Creole 

Fry 1 tablespoonful of chopped onions, as much cut-up 
green peppers, a peeled tomato cut in quarters, let simmer 
for 10 minutes, add 2 tablespoonfuls cooked rice, salt and a 
dash of paprika. Cover bottom of dish, break eggs carefully 
on top of preparation, and cook in moderate oven 5 minutes. 

Cheese Omelet 

4 eggs 1 tb. grated cheese 

1 tb. crisco }4 t. salt 

1 tb. water Pinch of pepper 

Beat eggs with water. Add the grated cheese, salt and 
cayenne. Melt the crisco, stir in the mixture until it just 

67 



begins to set. The omelet must be quite soft in the middle. 
Turn onto a hot dish and serve. 

Tomato or other sauce may be poured around if desired. 

Omelet 

Yolks of 3 eggs well beaten, 1 teaspoonful salt, pepper, 
3 tablespoonfuls hot water, added gradually, then beaten 
whites folded in heated omelet pan, grease bottom and sides, 
then turn in the mixture and cook slowly. When browned 
nicely on the bottom, put on the shelf of the oven to cook top. 
Fold and turn out on hot platter. White sauce may be poured 
around this, or 1 cup canned peas may be beaten in sauce and 
poured around omelet. 

Hold pan by handle with left hand. With a case knife 
make 2 yi-mch incisions opposite each other at right angles 
to handle. Place knife under part of omelet nearest handle, 
tip pan to nearly vertical position; by carefully coaxing the 
omelet with knife, it will fold and turn without breaking. 

Plain Omelet 

4 eggs 4 tb. water 

4 t. crisco Few grains pepper 

yi t. salt 

Separate the yolks and whites. Beat the yolks until 
creamy and thick. Add water, salt, pepper, mix thoroughly. 
Beat the whites until stiff and dry, and fold in lightly. 
Put crisco into the omelet pan, and when hot, turn into the 
mixture. Let it stand for 2 minutes, where there is moderate 
heat. When brown on the bottom and slightly firm on the 
top, fold and serve hot on a hot platter. 

French Omelet 

To 4 eggs allow yi cup of cold water, salt and pepper. Beat 
the eggs light, then add the water and mix thoroughly. Pour 
into hot greased frying-pan, run the spatula around the edges 
and lift slightly to allow the thin part underneath. Dish 
onto a hot platter. Serve at once. 

Cheese Omelet 

Make omelet as above and on top put cup grated cheese 
before folding. 

68 



Eggs 



Puffy Omelet 



To make a puffy omelet, beat the whites of the eggs until 
dry; beat the yolks until light colored and thick; add to the 
yolks a tablespoonful of water for each yolk, and % teaspoonful 
salt and a dash of pepper for each 3 yolks; mix together 
thoroughly and turn over the beaten whites, then cut the 
whites into the yolk mixture. Have the pan buttered and 
hot, turn in the mixture, spreading it evenly over the pan. 
Let stand for about 2 minutes, where there is a moderate heat, 
then set in the oven to cook the top slightly. Just as soon as 
a knife — thrust in the center of the omelet — comes out nearly 
clean, remove from the oven, cut across the center of the top, 
at right angles to the handle, fold the part nearest the handle 
over the other part, and turn onto a hot platter. 

Either the plain French omelet or the puffy omelet may be 
varied by the use of a filling, or a garnish, or both. The fill- 
ing, if finely chopped, as parsley or other herbs, may be 
mixed with the body of the omelet, though by "filling" we 
usually mean a little of the desired article chopped fine or 
cut in small cubes, perhaps mixed with a sauce, sprinkled 
onto the surface of the omelet before it is folded. When used 
as a garnish the article is mixed with a sauce and poured about 
the omelet. Green or canned peas, in white sauce, mushrooms, 
fresh or canned, macaroni in tomato sauce, oysters in cream 
sauce, fine chopped ham or chicken, asparagus tips, and 
tomatoes are among the favorite fillings and garnishes. 

The pan should be thin, as quick cooking is of importance; 
it should not be large, as one of the first requisites in a perfect 
omelet is thickness. The greatest care and skill are needed to 
secure an omelet in which the eggs are not liquid, but barely 
set. 

A spoon or fork is the proper utensil for serving. If a knife 
needs be used, the omelet is a failure. 

Omelet Souffle 

Whites of 6 eggs; yolks of 3 eggs; 2 tablespoons powdered 
sugar; the grated yellow rind of yi lemon; >£ teaspoon lemon 
juice. Beat the whites of the eggs until stiff and frothy; sift 
over the sugar and beat again until fine and dry; add the yolks 
slightly beaten, the lemon rind and juice. Mix quickly, put 
at once into a baking dish, sprinkle on top with powdered 
sugar, and bake in an oven at 400 degrees Fahrenheit, 5 

69 



Eggs 

minutes. The oven must be ready before you begin the souffle. 
If it is stringy inside it has been baked too long. To be right, 
it must be hot but soft. It must be served immediately in 
the dish in which it was baked. 

French Omelet 

To make a French omelet, break the eggs into a bowl; add 
as many tablespoonfuls of water as eggs, counting 2 yolks as a 
whole egg, and for each 3 eggs, a dash of pepper and )4 tea- 
spoon of salt. Beat the eggs with a spoon or fork until a 
spoonful can be taken up; then strain into another bowl. If a 
mild flavor of garlic be agreeable, rub the inside of the bowl 
into which the eggs are to be broken with a clove of garlic. 
Have ready, in the cleanest, smoothest and thinnest of frying- 
pans, a tablespoonful of melted butter, into this pour the egg 
mixture, set on a hot part of the range for a minute, then with 
a thin knife, or spatula, separate the cooked portion from the 
side of the frying pan, and gently rock the pan back and forth, 
the side next the handle raised as the pan is pushed forward 
and the opposite raised as it is brought back, that the 
uncooked part may run down next the pan. When creamy 
throughout, begin at the side of the pan next the handle and 
roll the omelet, letting the pan rest on the stove a moment, 
until the omelet is browned slightly, adding a little butter if 
needed, and turn onto a hot platter. 

Spanish Omelet 

Cook together 1 tablespoonful butter, 1 chopped green 
pepper, }4 sliced onion; add \}4 cups tomatoes; add salt and 
cook slowly for IS minutes. Make an omelet by your usual 
rule and just before folding spread with part of the tomato 
mixture. Turn out on a hot platter and serve with the rest of 
the sauce poured around it. 

Sardine Omelet 

Three eggs, 1 tablespoonful cream or milk, 1 teaspoonful 
of anchovy essence, 3 sardines, free from skin and bone, 1 
heaping tablespoonful of butter, pepper and salt to taste. 
Break the eggs into a basin, add the cream and milk and beat 
up well, cut the sardines into small dice, add these and the 
anchovy essence, and mix thoroughly. Season with a pinch 
of pepper. Melt the butter in a frying or omelet pan, pour in

salt, pepper, red pepper and slices of buttered toast. Wash 
and peel the mushrooms, chop them finely and fry in a 
little butter. Break up the eggs into a basin, whisk up 
well, and pour into a saucepan. Add the mushrooms, butter, 
pepper, salt, red pepper to taste. Stir over the fire with a 
wooden spoon until the eggs are lightly set. Have the toast 
neatly trimmed on a hot plate or dish, pour the egg mixture

is put in the water in which they are boiled, the flat taste 
to which many persons object in using sweetbreads as salads,

and stir constantly. As mixture thickens, thin with vinegar 
until that is used, then use lemon juice. Add oil alternately 
with vinegar or lemon juice until Y\ teaspoon lemon juice, 
yi teaspoon vinegar and ^3 cup of oil have been used, stirring 
or beating constantly. After the mixture is well thickened 
the oil may be added in a slow, steady stream, while the 
beating is continued vigorously. 

During the Making of Mayonnaise 

If the conditions are not right, the mixture becomes 
curdled. The same thing may take place if too long a time 
is taken in its preparation. Should it become curdled, a 
smooth consistency may be restored by taking remaining 
half of egg yolk and adding mixture slowly to it, beating con- 
stantly. A mayonnaise, when done, should be stiff enough 
to hold in shape.

CHAPTER XII 

RICE 

Steamed Rice 

Look the rice over carefully, and place in a strainer set 
in a bowl of cold water. Wash it with the hands, changing the 
water as often as is necessary until all cloudiness disappears. 
Soak for 1 hour. Have the water boiling vigorously, add 
salt, drain the rice and sprinkle it in so slowly that the water 
does not stop boiling. Boil violently for IS minutes but be 
careful not to overcook; when no hard core can be felt on 
pinching the kernel between the thumb and finger, it is done. 
Pour into a colander, saving the rice water for soup. Set the 
colander over a pot containing a little boiling water or in a 
cool oven and let it steam until ready to serve. Each grain 
should be large and perfectly distinct. 

To Boil Rice 

Pick out all discolored grains; wash it well in two waters; 
drop it into a kettle of boiling water previously salted; then 
set the kettle on the back of the stove over a slow fire, and let 
the rice simmer until done. One cupful of rice will require 1 
quart of water. Never stir it and when it is thoroughly cooked, 
each kernel will stand apart by itself, plump and whole. When 
done pour immediately into a colander, and set it upon the 
coolest part of the stove. Toss it up lightly when put in the 
colander. It should be boiled in an open stew-pan. A table- 
spoon of lemon juice added to the water in which rice is 
boiling will aid in making the rice whiter and keeping the 
grains separate. 

Rice Omelet 

Beat a cup of boiled rice and 2 cups of milk to a smooth 
paste. Add 2 eggs well beaten, salt and pepper to taste. 
Fry until brown; cover with powdered sugar and serve at once.

CHAPTER XIII 

DEEP FAT FRYING 

The most objectionable thing in most frying is the fact 
that the intense heat required for frying develops in animal 
fats, such as lard or butter, fatty acids which greatly irritate 
the digestive organs. It is for this reason that many families 
avoid using fried meats. 

The art of frying is commonly misunderstood, and the 
products of the skillet are usually indigestible, ordinarily 
greasy, sometimes unsightly and generally unpalatable. 
When the fats are overheated, which is often the case with 
lard or butter (which burn at a low temperature), the foods 
themselves are rendered indigestible and sometimes posi- 
tively injurious. To avoid this overheating, the cook fre- 
quently has the lard or butter too cool and the food cooked 
is rendered greasy and underdone. 

An article well fried should come out as free from grease 
as though it had been cooked in water. This result can be 
obtained by immersion in hot crisco. Crisco may be heated 
to a temperature much hotter than lard without burning, 
and is therefore, on this account, as well as for other reasons, 
far more desirable than any animal fat. 

The principle of deep fat frying lies in the fact that the 
articles to be cooked, when dropped into the very hot fat, 
form a crust on the outside of the food, which prevents the 
fat itself from penetrating the interior of the food. Cooked 
in this manner, chops, cutlets, fish, oysters, poultry, potatoes, 
croquettes, etc., will be found to be perfectly digestible, 
delicious in flavor and most appetizing in appearance. It 
is a maxim of cooks of the highest class that croquettes which 
will soil the fingers are unfit for food. When fried by immer- 
sion in deep fat, each article should come out dry and crisp. 

Another characteristic of crisco is worthy of special men- 
tion in this connection. The fat itself is impervious to odors 
or flavors. Every one knows that lard, even boiling lard, 
takes up both odors and flavors, and when used for fish can 
not be used for anything but fish. The same pot of fat should 
be used over and over again for frying different foods and not 
one of them taste of the other. 

104 



Deep Fat Frying 

Owing to this neutral quality of crisco, the same fat may 
be used over and over again until it is exhausted. This 
means a great saving in the quantity required. 

All warmed-over foods, such as croquettes, should be 
dipped in egg and rolled in bread crumbs before frying. 
The egg, which is very rich in albumen, coagulates, forming 
a thin, grease-proof covering over the outside as soon as put 
into the fat. 

In this manner these articles can be cooked without taking 
up any of the fat. 

Directions for Frying 

Use a deep frying pan or kettle. A wire frying basket 
to hold the articles to be fried, hung on a crook attached to 
kettle, is convenient, but they may be lowered into the fat 
and taken from it with a spoon-shaped wire egg-beater. 

Put fat into frying kettle (cold) and bring slowly to the 
right degree of heat. Test it, and if of right temperature 
dip the basket or wire spoon into the fat to heat and grease 
it. If the basket is used, lay the articles in it and lower 
them until the fat covers them. When they are a delicate 
brown, shake a little and let the food drain for a moment 
before removing it to the paper. Reheat the fat, testing if 
necessary, and fry another batch of articles. When all the 
grease has been absorbed by the paper, arrange the food on 
a platter and garnish it. 

TESTS 

For deep frying, heat fat until a crumb of bread becomes a golden 

brown in 
60 seconds for raw dough mixtures, as crullers, fritters, etc. 
40 seconds for cooked mixtures, as croquettes, codfish balls, etc. 
20 seconds for French fried potatoes. 
Seconds may be counted thus: one hundred and one, one hundred 

and two, etc.

CHAPTER XIV 



BREAD 

Back of the loaf is the snowy flour 

And back of the flour is the mill, 

And back of the mill is the wheat and shower 

And the sun and the Father's will. 

— Good Housekeeping. 

Bread has been called the staff of life and from this indi- 
cation of its importance it would seem unnecessary to call 
attention to the great wrong done by poor bread. It would 
seem as though we could have no poor bread. Many fam- 
ilies are underfed, because they consume large quantities of 
bakeshop products, or products made of inferior flour, and 
do not take sufficient protein food. Whole wheat bread 
spread with butter is a perfect food and next in point of 
nutrition comes rye bread, which is always combined with 
white flour, as rye used alone will be found heavy and gluey 
and hard to digest. Graham flour is nutritious and excel- 
lent for those of sedentary habits, or those who, for any 
reason, suffer from constipation. 

In selecting flour for bread, spring wheat will be best 
when yeast is used and winter wheat may be used for biscuit. 
We use several methods in making bread, such as leavening 
it with soda and sour milk or baking powder, which pro- 
duces carbon dioxide, and this is unfermented bread. Many 
consider soda and sour milk the most wholesome hot bread. 
Those who object to high priced baking powder may make 
excellent baking powder by using the following proportions: 
1 teaspoon of soda, 2 teaspoonfuls of cream of tartar sifted 
together; to each 12 tablespoonfuls of this mixture add 4 
tablespoonfuls of cornstarch. 

Baking powder mixtures are made light by the liberation 
of gas in dough and as soon as moisture is added gas will be- 
gin to escape and for that reason all baking powder mixtures 
should go into hot oven immediately. Soda is combined 
with cream tartar, yi teaspoon soda to 1 cup sour milk and 
1 part soda to 2 parts cream tartar. Acids found in molasses, 
brown sugar and lemons act in the same way as sour milk. 

US 



Bread 

Another form of unfermented bread is aerated bread, 
where by some process, air is enclosed, as beating in popovers, 
or pounding air into beaten biscuit. Yeast is the lowest 
form of vegetable life: it consists of spores, or germs which 
grow by budding, requiring moisture and heat and ferment 
for propagation or fermentation. 

Dry, liquid or compressed yeast may be used. Fleisch- 
mann's compressed yeast is prepared under most hygienic 
conditions in a sanitary factory and is universally used. 

Points well to remember about yeast are as follows: 
Yeast germ is killed by using water at 212° F. and retarded, 
if not totally killed, at 32° F. 

A fresh cake of yeast is necessary for well flavored bread. 
A fresh cake will be light colored, crumbly and give slightly 
sour odor. When yeast is soft and very sour it should not 
be used. 

More bread would be made and consequently less money 
spent for other articles of diet, if a short process of making 
was employed. Use a method whereby the bread may be 
raised and baked within six hours. For that purpose we 
would add sugar to our sponge, as that hastens the fermenta- 
tion, and set out of draughts at a temperature of 68 degrees 
or 70 degrees. 

The ferment in the yeast converts the starch into sugar 
and that in turn into alcohol and carbon dioxide and thereby 
lightens the mass by filling it with bubbles. By the time this 
has been accomplished we add more flour, salt and shorten- 
ing and knead well to break the bubbles and distribute the 
air cells. 

To knead push dough with the palm of the hand and fold 
forward with fingers. Use as little flour on board as possible, 
as soft dough makes more tender bread. The more carefully 
it is kneaded, the finer the grain and this means until it is 
smooth and elastic. 

When bread is allowed to rise over night, less yeast is used: 
% cake to a pint of liquid will be sufficient. If the dough 
has a yeasty, sour taste, dissolve j4 teaspoon soda in 3 table- 
spoonfuls warm water, add 2 tablespoonfuls sugar and work 
into dough. 

Bread should be baked in a pretty hot oven. Loaf should 
not continue to rise in the oven after 10 minutes and for that 

116 



Bread 

reason care is taken not to allow crust to form too soon be- 
fore heat has reached center of loaf and killed the fermenta- 
tion. Bread that continues to rise too long in oven will be 
coarse grained. After bread completes rising in oven reduce 
heat. It will require from 50 to 60 minutes for loaf weighing 
a pound. To determine that bread is baked thoroughly, 
you will find it is easily removed from pan as it shrinks and 
should give off hollow sounds on being tapped with finger. 

Rolls require more heat than loaves, and should be baked 
in from 12 to 20 minutes according to size. If very crusty 
bread is desired, brush over with milk or white of an egg. 
If tender crust is desired brush with cream or butter before 
removing from oven. As much depends on manner of cool- 
ing bread as making and baking. Loaves should be im- 
mediately removed from pans to cool on wire trivet, or if 
one is not convenient, use rack out of refrigerator and elevate 
it above the table by placing at four corners cups or glasses. 
A free circulation of air is necessary to prevent bread from 
sweating and cooling unevenly. A stone jar, or a tin cake 
or bread box with few perforations in end of the box is the 
best receptacle for keeping bread fresh and moist.

Griddle Cakes 

All batter cakes are better baked on an ungreased griddle, 
as they rise and keep their shape, and do not follow the grease. 
Your griddle need not necessarily be of soapstone. If you 
have an old griddle and clean it thoroughly, being sure to 
remove all burned fat or batter, it can be used in this way.

1 pt. milk (scalded) 3 t. salt 

1 pt. boiling water 1 cake yeast mixed with }i c. 

2 tb. sugar lukewarm water 

2 tb. butter or crisco Flour to make a dough 

Steps in the Process of Bread Making 

I. Mixing. — 1. Scald milk and boil water. 2. Put 
salt, sugar, and crisco into mixing bowl and add hot liquids. 
3. While these are cooling separate yeast in lukewarm water 
and add to lukewarm liquids. 4. Add flour to make a drop 
batter, and beat well. 5. Add more flour to make dough. 

II. First Kneading. — (a) Objects: 1. To work air in. 2. 
To make gluten elastic. 3. To blend ingredients, (b) 
Time about 20 minutes. 

III. First Rising. — (a) Precautions when put to rise: 
1. Grease top to prevent formation of crust. 2. Shield from 
draughts of air. (b) Time dependent upon (1) amount of 
yeast used; (2) temperature. 

Note. — Use about one yeast cake to every quart of liquid 
when bread is to rise over night. If set in a warm place, and 
double the amount used, bread should be ready to knead 
in a few hours. Regardless of the time allow bread to rise 
until dough is double in bulk. 

IV. ' Second Kneading. — The object of the second knead- 
ing is to break up gas bubbles so that bread will be fine grained. 

V. Shaping. — Shape into loaves or rolls. 

VI. Second Rising. — Put to rise in the pans. Allow 
loaves to rise about 45 minutes, or until double in bulk. 

VII. Baking. — Loaves should be baked from 45 to 60 
minutes, rolls 10 to 20 minutes.

This bread can be mixed, raised and baked in 5 hours. 
It is usually mixed in the morning and the cook is able to 
watch the' dough while rising and keep it at a uniform temp- 
erature. It is often desirable to place bowl containing 
dough in pan of water, keeping the water at a temperature 
of from 95 to 100 degrees F.

1 cake Fleischmann's com- 1 tb. melted crisco 

pressed yeast 2 eggs 

2 c. milk, scalded and cooled 2yi c. sifted flour 
1 tb. sugar 1 t. salt 

Dissolve the yeast and sugar in the lukewarm liquid, add 
shortening, flour, salt, and eggs well beaten. Beat thor- 
oughly until batter is smooth; cover and set aside to rise in 
a warm place, free from draft, for about 1 hour. When light, 
stir well. Have waffle iron hot and well greased, fill the cool 
side. Brown on one side, turn the iron and brown on the 
other side. If the batter is too thick, the waffle will be tough. 

Bread Sticks 

Take rusk or bread dough — rusk is better — and when 

light cut pieces from the side and roll under the hands to the 

length of the pan and the thickness of a lead pencil. Let 

rise until light, bake in a hot oven and when nearly done 

glaze with egg. _ ^,. , _

and the salt. Knead thoroughly; roll out and shape as 
Parker House rolls. Place in well greased, shallow baking 
pans, cover and set to rise in a warm place, free from draft, 
for about 2 hours. When light, bake in a hot oven 10 
minutes. 

TIMBALES 

To make timbales you must have a timbale mold of iron. 
This is dipped into batter and is then held in hot fat until 
the coat of batter is cooked. Then this crust is slipped off 
the iron and another timbale case is cooked in the same way. 
The timbale irons are heart-shaped, star-shaped, round, 
square or oval. 

For the Batter 

The following recipe for timbale batter has been tried 
with success: Take $4, cup of flour and mix with a teaspoon 
of sugar and yi teaspoon of salt. Add to it yi cup of milk, 
a well beaten egg, tablespoon of melted butter or olive oil 
and whip until it is all blended. This batter should be placed 
in a cup or bowl into which the timbale iron may be dipped, 
so that the outside of the mold will be covered with the 
preparation. 

Timbale Cases 

Put a kettle of fat on the fire. It should get as hot as is 
required for baking doughnuts. Dip the timbale iron into 
the fat and let the mold heat. Then dip into the batter 

io 137 



Bread 

and lift it out again. A film of the batter will cling to the 
iron. Submerge this in the pan of fat, and when it is cooked 
lift it and set on a folded napkin or absorbent paper to drain. 
Then proceed to cook more timbale cases in the same way. 
Creamed mushrooms, chicken, veal, oysters or fish may be 
served in the cases. 

A Rich Combination — Mutton Timbales 

Take }4 pound of finely minced cold mutton, a teaspoon 
of chopped parsley, a tablespoon of bread crumbs, a dessert- 
spoonful of chopped mushrooms, 1 egg, a gill of stock, a little 
pepper and salt. Mix all the ingredients and steam for 20 
minutes. If canned mushrooms are used for this recipe 
they should be cooked in butter for a few minutes. Buttered 
timbale cases should be filled with the mixture set on a silver 
dish to serve and covered with a good, thick gravy with 
fried mushrooms in it. 

Chicken Timbales 

Cook together, till a paste is formed, y£ cup of stale bread 
crumbs and yi cup of milk. Add 2 ounces of butter, the 
stifHy beaten white of 1 egg, salt to taste, a few grains only 
of cayenne, and a pinch of ground nutmeg. Add to this 
yi cup of raw chicken breast, which has been beaten to a 
paste in a mortar and forced through a fine strainer. Fill the 
timbale cases with this and garnish with mushrooms cut in 
fancy shapes.

CHAPTER XV 

PASTRY 

We have, for the last decade, been trying to exclude pies 
and substitute delicate puddings and fresh fruit in our dietaries, 
but there are some with whom nothing takes the place of pies. 
It is vastly important to know that the chief constituents of 
pastry are entirely antagonistic in their mode of digestion, and 
wherever used shortening with a low melting point free from 
odor and flavor and pastry flour of the soft winter wheat get 
best results. Use nothing but fresh, ripe fruit or delicate 
custards. 

In order to make good pie crust, everything must be ice- 
cold — the shortening, flour, water and utensils used in the 
preparation of the dough should all be chilled beforehand, 
— cutting the shortening into the flour with two silver knives 
chilled in ice water gives an even distribution of the shorten- 
ing and flour without melting the shortening. It is necessary 
to work rapidly and with a light touch. A heated kitchen is 
not productive of best pastry. Its lightness depends upon the 
amount of air enclosed and the expansion of that air in the 
baking. Its flakiness depends upon the kind and amount of 
shortening used. Crisco will give a tenderer crust than butter. 
Where the flavor of butter is desired, one tablespoonful may 
be added. In rolling pastry use a light motion rolling from 
you, as less force is expended on the outward stroke than on 
one where the hands are drawn back towards the body. 
Utensils best adapted are a small enamel mixing bowl, alumi- 
num measuring cup, two silver knives, one spatula, tablespoon, 
sifter, glass rolling pin, aluminum bread board and pastry 
wheel. 

Plain Pastry 

1 c. flour Just enough cold water to 

5 t. crisco hold dough together 

j£ t. salt (This makes two crusts) 

Sift the flour and the salt and cut the crisco into the flour 
until it is finely divided. Then add the water sparingly, 
mixing it with a knife through the dry materials. Form into 
a dough, roll out on a floured board, about % inch thick. Use 
a light motion in handling the rolling pin, and roll from the 
center outward. 

139 



Pastry 

The crisco should be of a consistency such that when 
scooped out with a spoon it rounds up egg shape. Crisco will 
always be in excellent condition for use if kept at the usual 
room temperature. 

Flake Pastry 

1 c. flour Just enough cold water to 

4 tb. crisco hold dough together 

yi t. salt (Two tb. should be sufficient) 

Sift the flour and the salt and cut half the crisco into the 
flour with a knife until it is finely divided. The finger tips 
may be used to finish blending the materials. Then add the 
water sparingly, mixing it with a knife through the dry materi- 
als. Form with the hand into a dough and roll out on a floured 
board to y^ inch in thickness. 

Spread one-third of the remaining crisco on the two- 
thirds of the dough nearest you; fold twice, so as to make 
three layers, folding in first the part on which the crisco has 
not been spread. Turn dough, putting folded edges to the 
sides; roll out, spread and fold as before. Repeat once more. 
Use a light motion in handling the rolling pin, and roll from 
the center outward. 

Plain Pie Crust 

\}4 c. flour Enough ice water to make a 

yi c. crisco dough 

yi t. salt 

Cut the shortening into the flour with silver knife and roll 
the dough out. Dot over with crisco, fold several times and 
roll out again, line pans and cover with the same, or use the 
flake pastry for covering the pie. Crust for pie should be 
about yi inch thick and rolled larger than pans to allow for 
shrinkage. Perforate top crusts to allow steam to escape. 



German Paste 

5 c. flour 2 yolks of eggs 

\yi c. crisco \yi t. salt 

yi c. ground almonds Water 

1 c. sugar 

Sift flour and almonds into basin, rub crisco into them, add 
salt, sugar, eggs well beaten and water to make stiff paste. 
Leave in cool place 2 hours, then roll out and use for pies. 

140 



Pastry 
Fruit Turnovers 

(Suitable for Picnics) 

Make a nice puff paste; roll it out the usual thickness, as 
for pies; then cut it out into circular pieces about the size of a 
small tea saucer; pile the fruit on half of the paste, sprinkle 
over some sugar, wet the edges and turn the paste over. Press 
the edges together, ornament them and brush the turnovers 
over with the white of an egg; sprinkle over sifted sugar and 
bake on tins, in a brisk oven, for about 20 minutes. Instead 
of putting the fruit in raw, it may be boiled down with a little 
sugar first and then enclosed in the crust; or jam of any kind 
may be substituted for fresh fruit. 

Hot Water Paste 

1 c. flour J A t. salt 

4 tb. crisco yi t. baking powder 

3 tb. boiling water 

Sift flour, salt and baking powder into basin, rub crisco 
lightly into them, then stir in boiling water. Cool paste be- 
fore using or it will be too sticky to handle. 

French Pastry 

yi lb. flour Grated peel yi lemon 

2 tb. sugar yi lb. butter 
4 egg yolks yi t. salt 

Sift together the flour, sugar and salt. Cut in the butter 
and lemon rind, then add the slightly beaten yolks. One or 
2 tablespoonfuls ice water may be needed. Set on ice to chill. 
Roll about yi inch thick, glaze top with beaten egg (white and 
yolk) sprinkle sugar, chopped nuts, or crystallized fruits. Bake 
in a moderate oven after cutting into desired shapes. 

To Glaze Pastry 

To glaze pastry, break an egg, separate the yolk from the 
white and beat the former for a short time. Then, when the 
pastry is nearly baked, take it out of the oven, brush it over 
with the beaten yolk of egg, and put back in the oven to set 
the glaze. 

When making pies tuck the upper crust under the lower 
crust and then press down with a fork. You will never have 
any trouble with juice running out, and in this way pies slip 
off the plate without trouble. 

141 



Pastry 

Rhubarb Pie 

Chop 2 cupfuls rhubarb, and let stand 10 minutes in water 
poured over it boiling hot. Drain, and mix with it the fruit, 
a cupful of sugar, the yolk of an egg, a tablespoon of butter, 
and 1 of flour, moisten with 3 tablespoohfuls water. Bake in 
one crust, covering the top with narrow strips of pastry 
crossed, or with meringue. 

Fruit-Rhubarb Pie 

Take 3 heaping cups chopped rhubarb, 1 of chopped and 
seeded raisins, and 3 plain crushed crackers, powdered. Mix 
and add ^3 cup of molasses, l}4 cups sugar, 1 teaspoon butter, 
spice and salt to taste. This amount will make three pies. 
Bake in two crusts. 

Lemon Meringue Pie (Lettie) 

4 eggs 2 c. rich milk 

2 c. sugar 2 tb. butter 

2 tb. flour yi t. salt 

3 large lemons 

Cream sugar and yolks of eggs, add salt, flour, then butter 
and milk. Add lemon just before baking. Put meringue on 
when pie is cool. 

Chess Cakes 

4 eggs 2 c. rich milk 

3 tb. cornmeal 4 tb. butter 
\yi c. sugar X *• nutmeg 

Cream the yolks of eggs and sugar. Add cornmeal. Scald 
the milk and add gradually to the custard. Add the flavoring 
and butter and fill pastry shells, using plain pastry. 

Recipe for the shells: Make a meringue of the white of 
egg, using 1 tablespoonful confectioner's sugar for each egg 
white. After the custard is well set, cover with meringue and 
place in moderate oven until nicely browned. 

Chess Cakes 

7 eggs 2 c. sugar 

%i c. butter yi t. salt 

2 tb. cornstarch 2 tb. water 

1 c. jelly, apple or grape 

Mix cornstarch with sugar and cream with butter. Beat 
egg yolks with salt and add to mixture, stirring in warm jelly. 
After thoroughly mixed, add beaten whites. If too stiff, 2 

142 



Pastry 

tablespoonfuls water may be added. Line mold with plain 
pastry and fill with mixture. Cook 20 to 30 minutes. This 
filling is sufficient for 24 cakes. 

Apple Pie 

Sprinkle lower crust with flour, then add 1 cup sugar. Pare 
apples, slice thin and place in orderly manner. Add yi tea- 
spoon salt and yi teaspoon cinnamon or nutmeg and yi table- 
spoon butter. Cover with upper crust and bake in moderate 
oven 1 hour. Use plain pie crust. 

Note — If juice boils out, lower temperature of oven. 

Pie Crust 

1 c. flour yi t. salt 

5 tb. crisco 2 tb. water 

Combine ingredients as for plain pastry. Roll paste very 
thin. For all pies made with one crust, use a deep pie plate 
and line it without stretching the paste in the least. Remember 
that all pastry shrinks in the baking and allow for this shrink- 
age. Trim the edges with a fork or by fluting, and prick 
every part of the center and sides with a fork before placing 
at once in a quick oven. If gas range is used, place pastry on 
lower shelf; if a coal range, where a good bottom heat can be 
obtained. 

Note — Pastry burns readily and these crusts are very thin. 

Raisin Pie 

Boil 2 cups raisins, juice 1 lemon and yi cup sugar with 1 
cup water until raisins are tender. Line pie-pan with pastry, 
put in raisins and dot over with butter and spice, cover with

Cream yolks and sugar, add crisco and sorghum, beaten 
whites of 4 eggs. Use balance of the whites for meringue. 

143 



Pastry 

Pineapple Pie 

Pare the pineapples and chop as finely as possible. To 1 
cup of pineapple use 2 eggs, 1 cup milk, 2 tablespoons sugar, 
pinch salt, mix as custard and bake in rich pastry crust. 

Raisin and Apple Pie 

Line pie-tin with pastry, and place first one layer thin apple 
slices, a sprinkle of sugar and cinnamon; then a layer of raisins 
and so on until pan is full. Put on top crust and bake.

3 tb. butter 6 eggs 

7 tb. flour 

Cream sugar or butter and eggs together, add molasses and 
flour. Bake in pastry lined pans and make meringue of whites 
and 2 tablespoonfuls sugar. 

Blackberry Pie 

. s 'Line a pie-plate with plain paste; carefully look over a pint 
of ripe blackberries; put them in a pie-dish, keeping them a 
little in the middle of the dish; dust with 2 tablespoonfuls 
flour, and add a cupful of sugar. Make a paste of a teaspoon- 
ful flour and little water, with which brush over the edge of the 
under crust to prevent the juice from escaping; add the upper 
crust and trim the superfluous crust from the edge with a 
knife. Bake in a quick oven. Dust with powdered sugar or 
cover with a meringue made of the white of 1 egg and a table- 
spoonful of pulverized sugar, or omit both and eat plain. 

Cherry Pie 

Prepare the requisite quantity of cherries by removing the 
pits; line a pie-plate with crusts, fill with cherries; sprinkle 
with a few bits of butter, about 2 tablespoonfuls flour, and ^ 
cupful of sugar if white cherries are used, but if red, sour ones, 
a whole cupful of sugar will be required. Cover with an upper 
crust, making a few short gashes in the center. Bake until the 
crust is done and of a delicate brown. 

144 



Pastry 

Lemon Raisin Pie 

One cupful chopped raisins, seeded; the juice and grated 
rind of 1 lemon, 1 cupful cold water, 1 tablespoonful of flour, 
1 cupful sugar, and 2 tablespoonfuls butter. Stir lightly to- 
gether and bake with upper and under crust. 

Coconut Pie 

One cupful grated fresh coconut, \}4 cupfuls sweet milk, 
the yolks of 4 eggs, a little salt, 1 tablespoonful melted butter 
and sugar to taste. Beat the whole about 5 minutes and 
put into shell previously prepared. Set into the oven and 
bake until the crust and filling are done, then cover with the 
whites (which have been beaten to a stiff froth) and browned 
before removing from the oven. If desiccated coconut is 
used soak it in milk over night. 

Meringue 

Beaten white of egg and 1 tablespoonful powdered sugar to 
make tender. One-sixteenth teaspoonful cream tartar. Place 
in very slow oven until biscuit colored. 

Clear Lemon Pies 

Dissolve 4 tablespoonfuls cornstarch in a little cold water 
and stir it in with \}4 pints boiling water until it thickens. 
Just before setting it away to cool, add 1 dessertspoonful of 
butter. Grate the rind and squeeze the juice of 3 lemons, and 
add with it about 1}4 cups of sugar — the quantity of sugar 
must be governed largely by taste, as lemons vary so much in 
size and juiciness. Before the cornstarch is fairly cold, add 
it to the lemon and sugar. 

Line two pie-plates; prick it to prevent its rising unevenly 
and bake it. Fill these crusts with the mixture, return them to 
the oven till thoroughly heated, then spread over them a 
meringue of the whites of 3 eggs. Brown it delicately, and 
cool the pies gradually. They should be entirely cold when 
served. 

Butter-Scotch Pie 

Mix 1 cupful dark brown sugar with 3 tablespoonfuls flour 
and a pinch of salt; add the yolks of 2 eggs, 1 teaspoonful 
melted crisco and 1 cupful milk. Cook in double boiler until 
thick and pour into baked crust. Cover with meringue and 
bake in oven.

Wash the bacon and fry for a few minutes in the pot in which 
you are to cook the beans. Add the water and when boiling 
put in the beans. Cook about 2 hours until tender. Add 
the salt, if the meat does not make the beans salty enough, 
and serve. 

Leftovers Dish 

Put any cold meat you may have through the meat chop- 
per, add pepper, salt and 1 teaspoon kitchen bouquet; add 
to this enough boiling water to make gravy. Have some 
rice nicely boiled in slightly salted water; put the meat in a 
deep dish (keeping back as much as possible of the gravy), 
cover the meat with the rice and pour the gravy over it. 

Fried hominy or cornmeal mush may be used in the same 
way to serve with meats or for breakfast with syrup. Cook 
% cupful in 1 pint of boiling water until it thickens, then 
place over boiling water to finish cooking for about an hour, 
adding salt and more water if too stiff, also an egg yolk or

CHAPTER XVIII 

SANDWICHES AND RAREBITS 

"Bread is the staff of life; bread and butler is a gold-headed cane." 

There is a knack about making really good, appetizing 
sandwiches, just as there is about making anything else. 
One of the most important things to be considered is the bread. 
Any kind may be used, depending on the kind of filling put 
in. For the very best sandwiches, however, it should be at 
least one day old and should be cut into the very thinnest 
possible slices. Then, after the filling is in, the crusts should 
be trimmed ofF and the sandwiches cut, either in strips, 
triangles, or halves, or in fancy cookie shapes. Should the 
sandwiches not be wanted for immediate use, they should 
be wrapped up in a clean, dampened cloth and put in a cool 
spot until needed. 

A list of the very best known fillings would include: (1) 
cold meats, such as ham, beef, roast, or lamb laid on the 
bread in very thin slices, with a leaf of lettuce, or finely 
chopped and worked with sufficient mayonnaise, cream or 
butter to form a smooth paste; (2) cheese; (3) jam or mar- 
malade; (4) salad, as lettuce or water-cress covered with a 
thin layer of mayonnaise. All sandwiches should be made 
with creamed butter. To prepare it place the butter in a 
bowl and work it with a silver fork until it is soft and creamy. 
Then drain off the moisture at the bottom of the bowl, and 
with a knife spread the butter thinly and evenly on the bread. 

Salmon Sandwiches 

Drain a can of salmon, remove the bones, and flake the 
fish very fine. Dip a lettuce leaf in mayonnaise dressing, lay 
on a thin slice of buttered bread from which the crust has 
been cut, put a layer of the flaked salmon on this, cover 
with another lettuce leaf, and put on the upper half of the 
sandwich. 

Tomato Sandwiches 

Drain whole or canned tomatoes, and cut in thin slices. 
Make a French dressing and dip each slice into it, then lay 
on a lettuce leaf between two slices of Boston brown bread.

Sandwiches and Rarebits 

Spinach Sandwiches 

Drain the liquor from canned spinach, cover with boiling 
water, salting slightly, and boil for 5 minutes, after which 
drain very dry, pressing out all moisture. When cold chop 
the spinach as fine as possible, seasoning with a little may- 
onnaise and pickled cucumber, minced into tiny bits. Spread 
between buttered bread-slices. 

Spinach and Anchovy Sandwiches 

Drain canned spinach as above, squeezing out every drop 
of juice, after boiling for 5 minutes. While hot heat in a 
cup of spinach a heaping tablespoonful of melted butter, 
salt to taste, and a dash of white pepper. Rub in now a 
tablespoonful of anchovy paste, or an equal quantity of 
chopped and boned anchovies. If the paste is used do not 
put the suggested salt into the spinach. When you have a 
smooth paste, spread it on the crustless slices of bread. 

French Cheese Sandwiches 

Brown bread Cream cheese 

Jam, marmalade or preserved ginger 

Slice the bread thinly and spread with a layer of the 
marmalade or jam. Strawberry or peach flavor should be 
used for the best results. Spread a layer of very fine cream 
cheese over the jam and cover it with another slice of bread. 
Press and serve for afternoon tea. 

Vera Cruz Club Sandwiches 

Between 2 slices of hot toast, spread a crisp lettuce leaf, 
thin slices of turkey or chicken and a thin slice of hot, crisp 
bacon that have been sprinkled with chili powder before 
frying, and 2 slices of dill pickle. Then sprinkle with a few 
drops of lemon juice or vinegar. Add a teaspoonful of olive 
oil and serve while hot. 

Chili Sandwiches 

Slice bread thin and butter. Lay between the slices 
crisp lettuce leaf and sprinkle well with chili powder and a 
few drops of lemon juice.

Mayonnaise dressing Bread and butter 

Chop the nuts finely and mix them with the mayonnaise. 
Spread between slices of bread and place a lettuce leaf be- 
tween the parts of each sandwich. Sprinkle over with a bit 
of cayenne pepper. Variations may be obtained by first 
mixing the nuts with very finely chopped celery, with chicken, 
with olives or with figs. First mix the ingredients finely 
and add the nuts; then soften with sweet cream or may- 
onnaise to a paste that will spread easily before putting it 
on the bread. Season with salt and pepper or paprika.

Cuban Sandwiches 

This sandwich may be described as a club sandwich 
with cheese. It is usually made large so that it is necessary 
to eat with a knife or fork. It may be made in such pro- 
portions as to supply a large amount of nourishment. 

Cut the crusts from the slices of bread. Between two 
slices lay first lettuce with a little salad dressing or salt on it, 
then a slice of soft, mild cheese and finally thin slices of 
dill pickles or a little chopped pickle.

CHAPTER XIX 

CAKES 

Cake baking is an art, and may be acquired by industry 
and accuracy. We divide cakes into two classes: sponge 
cakes, which have no butter nor shortening of any kind, and 
cakes containing shortening sufficient to. make them tender. 
In sponge cakes, or those lacking shortening, the eggs and sugar 
are thoroughly beaten together and dry ingredients folded in, 
and baked in a moderate oven from 40 to 60 minutes. 

We divide the making of cakes into three divisions, each 
one of which is important. 

1. Having decided upon a recipe, the first step is to 
prepare, on the work table, all ingredients accurately measured 
to insure against the possibility of leaving out some important 
factor of success. Sugar is sifted not only to take out foreign 
particles, but to insure even grain to the cake, as it is more 
difficult to cream coarse sugar than fine, granulated sugar. 
The coarse grains left in sifter may be used for sweetening 
or cooking. Shortening should be creamed and measured, 
flour should be sifted before being measured, replaced in 
sifter along with the required amount of baking powder, or 
soda and cream of tartar, and salt and sifted several times, 
using two sheets of heavy paper and sifting from one to the 
other, holding the sifter balanced twelve inches above the 
paper, thereby incorporating a larger amount of air in the 
flour than could be gotten by sifting at closer range. Eggs 
should be separated and whites be placed in cool, dry vessel, 
and if not used immediately placed in the refrigerator. 

2. Shortening and sugar are thoroughly creamed until 
we have a soft, flufFy mass free from grains. Too much 
importance cannot be attached to this particular point, as 
the care with which the sugar has been dissolved will be 
reflected in the texture of the cake after baking. One half 
the liquid (and for delicate cakes I recommend water instead 
of milk), should be added before sifting in any of the dry 
ingredients, care being taken, however, that not enough 
liquid is put in at any one time to cause a separation of the 
creamy mass. Alternate the flour and the balance of the 
liquid, until all have been incorporated in the batter. Add 
flavoring, and best results are gotten by using a small quan- 
tity of the best on the market rather than a great deal of the 

191 



Cakes 

cheaper grade. Beat the whites of the eggs well with a wire 
whisk, when stiff but not dry fold in the batter, place imme- 
diately in well floured aluminum or good block tin cake-pans, 
and bake at once. 

3. The baking of a cake is quite important. Layer 
cakes should go into a quick oven so that they may rise and 
set immediately before forming a hard crust on the outside. 
Loaf cakes should be baked in a very moderate oven, so 
that they will rise well before being baked, keeping the oven 
heat steady, though slow, and opening the oven door as little 
as possible, lest the small bubbles formed by action of the 
baking powder break, and cause the gas to escape. Place 
a heavy paper over loaf cake until well risen. 

4. Cakes should be removed from tins at once to wire 
trivet, thereby securing a free circulation of the air about 
the cake. Sponge cakes and cakes containing a large amount 
of egg whites should be inverted and allowed to shrink from 
the pans, thereby there will be no weight on the delicate 
walls of the air cells of these eggy batters. In baking cake, 
we seldom consider the amount of nutriment to be given 
thereby, inasmuch as an individual will at any one time 
eat but a small portion. This usually comes at the end of 
a hearty meal, served as dessert, or taken between meals. 
Wherever economy, therefore, is necessary, I recommend its 
observance in cake making, reserving liberal use of eggs, 
milk and butter where they will enter into their true position 
in the dietary. Every cake in this book with the exception of 
a few fruit cakes, is planned on an economical basis, and has 
been thoroughly tested by years of usage in my own kitchen. 

Crisco, I find, makes a lighter cake with better texture 
than butter, at less than half the cost; however, more industry 
is necessary in the creaming of crisco — butter, containing 
20% of moisture and casein, requiring less creaming. The 
difference in prices, however, will recommend crisco for 
cake making. Swansdown prepared flour will be found 
economical in delicate white cakes and sponge cakes. For 
flavoring, I use and heartily recommend Burnett's extracts. 

Royal baking powder will be found wholesome and reliable. 
Crisco has been used in all cake recipes, principally because 
of its uniform results; however, if it is desired to use butter 
instead, substitute }4 more butter than quantity given here 
of crisco; in the Emily white cake $4 cup butter will take the 
place of yi cup of crisco.

Icings and Fillings 

to the cream icing, you can make a chocolate cream icing. 
Almonds ground fine may also be used with the cream 
icing, or with the chocolate cream icing. To prepare the 
almonds, first drop the nuts in boiling water and let them 
stand until thoroughly heated so they may be easily blanched. 
Drain and blanch with the fingers. While still warm and 
moist grind them with the finest blade of meat grinder. If 
nuts are allowed to dry before grinding, the oil and the sub- 
stance of the nuts will separate. When ground, put in the 
oven in a shallow tin and brown to a delicate shade. Sprinkle 
over the cake after it has been frosted with cream icing or 
chocolate cream icing.

CHAPTER XXV 

CONDIMENTS 

There are certain kinds of foods which have little or no 
value as nutrition or to sustain the body, such as is possessed 
by meats, and vegetables; and yet they are very important 
and very necessary for existence. 

Chief among such foods are the condiments, salt, pepper, 
mustard, vinegar, spices, and the like; these have flavors 
which suggest pleasures in eating and therefore excite the 
excretion of the digestive juices. If one ate pork and boiled 
potatoes always, eating would be a tiresome affair, without 
any relish, and such a sameness of food would fail to excite 
the subsequent digestion merely from monotony of the 
affair. 

Indeed, the human body craves salt and could not get 
along any length of time without it. While the exact value 
of salt in the human body is not known, a certain amount of 
it must be produced. The wild tribes of Africa, when away 
from salt deposits, consider it their most valuable possession, 
and will go to any length to procure it. In the old Roman 
civilization the salt cellar had a most dignified place on the 
table; and when one dined with his neighbor and ate salt, 
this was symbolic of undying friendship. It is well known 
that animals go great distances to "salt licks" for their sup- 
plies of this necessary condiment; their bodies crave it and 
they must have it, even though they put themselves in 
danger of the sportsman. 

It is an old saying that hunger is a good sauce; but the 
condiments are by no means to be neglected, if food is to be 
relished. The various flavoring seeds and leaves, truffles, 
mushrooms and the like, even if they have no food value, 
render food more palatable. Every housewife should get 
acquainted with a variety of them.

of green ginger root, for every pound of fruit. Allow 1 cup of 
water to every pound of sugar, make a syrup of these and 
cook the ginger in this for IS minutes. The ginger may either

in the syrup. Stew the apples until tender, in just enough 
water to cover them. Lift from the water and lay in ginger 
syrup and bring to a boil. 

Guava Jelly 

Pick oyer, wash and pare guavas. Slice fruit and put 
over to boil with just enough water to cover. Simmer until 
fruit is soft and seed drop from the pulp. Strain over night 
through jelly bag. In the morning measure and add the 
juice of 1 lime to each quart of juice. Boil rapidly until 
juice has boiled down about one-fourth, which can be told 
by the lowering ring on the inside of the kettle. Then add 
sugar, 1 cup for each cup of juice, and boil until it drops thick 
from the spoon and is ready to jell. 

Crab Apple Jelly 

Wash and quarter large crabs, but do not core. Cover 
to the depth of an inch or 2 with cold water. Cook to a mush. 
Pour into a coarse cotton bag or strainer, and when cool 
enough press or squeeze hard to extract juice. Allow juice 
to drip without forcing strain. Allow the strained juice of 

4 lemons to a peck of apples and $4 pound of sugar to each

boiling sift in the sugar slowly, stirring constantly, and boil 

5 minutes longer, or until ready to jell.

quart of water. Cover the kettle; boil for 20 minutes; drain 
carefully from the pulp and strain through a cloth. Put 
the juice back in the kettle, boil hard for IS minutes; add 
one half the quantity of sugar; stir until dissolved, and if 
you have been careful and the fruit is just right, jelly may 
be formed at once. Begin testing by putting a teaspoonful 
in a saucer and setting it on the ice, and test every few minutes

until it does jell, when it must be set off the fire at once. 
No definite time for boiling can be set, for so much depends 
upon the fruit used. If it boils too long it will be ropy or sticky. 
In measuring the liquid before putting it over the fire it is well 
to measure half the quantity of sugar at once, so that there 
can be no mistake. 

Quince Honey 

One cup of grated quince; 2 cups sugar; 2 cups hot water; 
Dissolve sugar in water. Add quince. Boil, and stir for IS 
minutes. 

Currant Jam 

Pick from stems and wash thoroughly. Put into a pre- 
serving kettle, and boil IS or 20 minutes, stirring often, and 
skimming off any scums that may arise. Then add sugar 
in the proportion of $4 pound of sugar to 1 pound of fruit, 
or 1 coffee cup of sugar to 1 pint of mashed fruit. Boil 
30 minutes longer, stirring almost constantly. When done, 
pour into glasses or jars, and seal or cover like jelly. 

Rhubarb Jam 

To 6 pounds rhubarb add 6 pounds of sugar and 6 lemons. 
Cut the rhubarb in small pieces. Slice the lemons very thin. 
Put the fruit in a large bowl and cover with the sugar, letting 
it stand for 24 hours. Boil for about $4 hour. Do not stir 
more than is necessary, as its great beauty is not being broken 
up. Put in glasses and cover with paper. 

Pear and Quince Preserves 

Take pears and quinces in the proportion of two-thirds 
pear to one-third quince. Pare, cut in halves, core and 
weigh. If the fruit is hard, boil in water until tender and use 
water for the syrup; allow $4 pound of sugar to each pound 
of fruit; boil a few moments until the sugar is thoroughly 
dissolved; skim, and cool until the syrup is lukewarm. Then 
add the fruit and boil gently until the syrup has penetrated 
and the fruit looks clear; some pieces will cook before the 
rest and must be removed first. When all are done, take 
out, boil down the syrup a little and pour over the fruit. 
Put in jars tightly covered.

California Marmalade 

Six navel oranges, and 3 large seedless lemons, sliced 
very thin, and leaving out the thick top and bottom of the 
peel. The juice of 4 lemons squeezed over the above. Weigh, 
and to each pound of fruit add 3 pints of water. Let stand 
another 24 hours, then boil an hour. Let stand another 
24 hours, then weigh water, pulp and all. To each pound 
add 1 pound of sugar, and boil rather fast for an hour. After

standing a few days it will turn to a quivering jelly, is not 
bitter, and I think you will agree to the assertion that it is 
the most delicate and delicious orange marmalade you ever 
tasted. It will not jelly perfectly if made too late in the 
season, when the oranges are at their sweetest. 

Lemon Marmalade 

To each pound of lemons allow 1)4 pounds sugar. Peel half 
of the lemons and grate the rind from the others; chop the 
fruit, removing the seeds before doing this. Press out all the 
juice you can in a vegetable-press and put it with the sugar. 
Set over the fire, stirring until the sugar is dissolved. 

Orange Marmalade 

Five oranges (sour) and 1 lemon, slice thin and remove 
all seeds. Weigh and to each pound of fruit add 3 pints of 
water. Let stand 24 hours and then boil for 45 minutes. 
Remove from the fire and let stand 12 hours. Weigh and 
to each pound add \}4 pounds sugar. Then boil 45 minutes. 
Then put in glasses. 

Tutti Frutti 

One pint best alcohol, and 5 cents worth salicylic acid. 
Put in 2-gallon jar, stone a quart of cherries, and add from 
time to time any fresh fruit during the season, red and black 
raspberries or fine peaches, stir well frequently. This is a 
fine addition to puddings, custards and creams.

CHAPTER XXVI 

CANDIES 
Fondant 

2 lbs. granulated sugar yi t. cream of tartar (scant) 

1 pt. water 

Place sugar and water in a kettle over a slow fire until 
it almost reaches the boiling point; then, with a wet cloth, 
wash down the sides of the kettle to remove all sugar crystals. 
Add the cream of tartar, dissolved in a little water, and boil 
until the syrup will form a soft ball in ice-water, or to be more 
accurate, use a candy thermometer and cook to 238° Fahren- 
heit. Never stir after it reaches the boiling point, and avoid 
shaking the kettle, as sugar grains very easily. Pour the syrup 
onto a marble or slate slab, or a large platter that has been 
placed in a level position, where it can remain until cold. Pour 
slowly, retaining the last bit of syrup in the kettle, as a few 
drops might cause the whole to crystallize. Moistening the 
slab and sprinkling the top of the syrup with water will help it 
to cool more quickly. When cold, stir with a paddle or wooden 
spoon until white and creamy. In about 10 minutes it will 
form a stiff mass. When you find it beginning to set, place 
immediately in a bowl, and cover with oil paper. Set aside 
for 24 hours, and it will be in splendid condition for use. 

Bonbons 

Save about two-thirds of the fondant for coating and use 
the remainder for centers. These can be made by mixing the 
cream with jams of different flavors, chopped nuts, raisins, 
figs, dates, etc. It will only be necessary to give directions for 
making one kind, as others may be made in the same way. 
Chocolate coating is similar to bonbon coating, if you use a 
dipping-fork, but the majority of fine candies are hand dipped. 
Use any good confectioners' bitter coating chocolate. The 
ordinary sweet chocolate will not do. Melt slowly in a double 
boiler, removing from the fire when partly melted, as care 
must be taken not to get the chocolate too hot.

add the cream, and cook until it will form a hard ball when 
tested in the same way. Add the extract just after removing 
from the fire. Pour into buttered plates, and when cool pull. 
Cut into pieces of desired length. This candy should be set 
aside for about 24 hours, as in that length of time it becomes 
flaky and will simply melt when put into the mouth. If a 
larger amount of the candy is desired double proportions may 
be used with equal success.

IN all recipes in this book calling for 
baking powder use "Royal." Better 
and finer food will be the result, and 
you will safeguard it against alum. 

In recipes calling for one teaspoonful 
of soda and two of cream of tartar, use two 
spoonfuls of Royal, and leave the cream of 
tartar and soda out. You get the better 
food and save much trouble and guesswork. 

Look out for alum baking powders. 
Do not permit them to come into your 
house under any consideration. They add 
an injurious substance to your food, destroy- 
ing in part its digestibility. All doctors 
will tell you this, and it is unquestionable. 
The use of alum in whiskey is absolutely 
prohibited; why not equally protect the 
food of our women and children ? 

Alum baking powders may be known 
by their price. Baking powders at a cent 
an ounce or ten or twenty-five cents a pound 
are made from alum. Avoid them. Use 
no baking powder unless the label shows it 
is made from cream of tartar. .,
