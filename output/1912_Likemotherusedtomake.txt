"LIKE MOTHER USE TO MAKE" 

I 

BREADS OF VARIOUS SORTS 

In the first place the mother did not make all the 
things herself. At least, my mother did not, ex- 
cept when an emergency arose in the kitchen. But 
she knew how it all ought to be done, and when a 
dish came to the table and was not what it should 
have been she could go out to the cook afterwards 
and tell her just what was the matter and how the 
trouble was to be avoided the next time. If the 
failure occurred again she would make the dish her- 
self and let the cook follow her movements and see 
what had caused the difficulty. 

There were certain things that she always made 
with her own hands or else had done directly under 
her personal supervision. She never dreamed of 
entrusting pickling or preserving to the unassisted 
efforts of Aunt Lucindy or Mammy Rachel or who- 
ever else reigned in the kitchen, but presided over 
every step in the operations until the finished prod- 



2 "LIKE MOTHER USED TO MAKE" 

ucts were sealed, marked and safely stowed in the 
storeroom under lock and key. 

Likewise she made or superintended the sponge- 
cake and the pound-cake and the mince-meat and 
the salad and the syllabubs and the calves'-foot jelly 
and like dainties. Even if she did not compound 
personally the varieties of hot bread that came to 
the table she knew the ins and outs of the proc- 
esses from start to finish, — a knowledge eminently 
desirable in the days when a cook might " get her 
han' out " on light bread for a month at a time. 

Every one knows the reputation of the Southern 
cook for " hot breads," as they call them down in 
the Old Dominion. Nowadays digestions are con- 
sidered to an extent which prescribes toast and cold 
bread for the first meal of the day, but in the times 
" befo' de wah," — and since then, too, — it was a 
common thing to have four or five varieties of 
warm bread on the breakfast-table. The tall loaf 
of rolls, muffins or beaten biscuit or both, batter 
bread, " egg bread," Sally Lunn, waffles, " batter 
cakes!" That was what they called them, — not 
" griddle cakes " or " pancakes." We ate of them 
all as though there were no gastronomic hereafter! 

The old time darky cook is practically extinct, 



"LIKE MOTHER USED TO MAKE" 3 

alas! but her secrets live in the memory of the 
mothers of some of us, and should be put into con- 
crete form for the benefit of all daughters. That, 
with befitting diffidence, I shall try to do in this 
and the following chapters. 

MOTHER'S BREAD 

Boil three potatoes and mash them fine while hot. 
Work into them a tablespoonful each of lard and 
sugar and stir in a pint of the water in which the 
potatoes were boiled. This should be lukewarm. 
Wet up a pint of flour with a little of the potato 
water, and add this to the water, sugar, lard and 
potatoes. Whip or stir until the batter is smooth 
— ■ with no lumps. Then add half a cake of yeast, 
dissolved in four tablespoonfuls of warm water and 
a pinch of soda. (In the old time three tablespoon- 
fuls of home-made yeast would have been used.) 
Turn into a deep bowl and cover and set to rise 
over night in a warm corner. 

Early the next morning sift a quart of dry flour, 
slightly scalded, into the bread-tray and turn the 
sponge into this, and with the hands work the two 
together. The dough should be just as soft as it 
can be molded, and can be stiffened or softened by 



4 " LIKE MOTHER USED TO MAKE " 

the addition of lukewarm water or a little more 
flour. Flour the hands lightly to keep them from 
sticking. When you can make the dough into a 
ball, lift it out on a well-floured board, rinse out the 
bowl in which it was mixed with a little warm 
water, so as to get all the sponge, and work this 
into the dough. Knead it well then, from the out- 
side towards the center, turning the ball often. 
Twenty minutes is none too much to give. Put 
the dough back into the bowl, cover, and leave in a 
place of even temperature. It should rise to three 
times its original size and will take from four to 
six hours in the process. At this stage knead it 
again for five or six minutes and make into loaves. 
Each pan should be about half-full. In an hour, 
if the pans are left in a moderate warmth, the bread 
will have risen to nearly twice its original size and 
may be baked. If you can hold your bare arm in 
the oven while you count thirty the heat is right. 
Keep it steady during the hour the bread takes to 
bake. If the top crust browns too quickly, cover 
with a sheet of white or brown wrapping paper un- 
til about ten minutes before the loaf is done. 

BREAKFAST ROLLS 

Mix together three-quarters of a cup of mixed 



" LIKE MOTHER USED TO MAKE " 5 

lard and butter melted with one quart of milk, 
slightly warmed. Add a couple of tablespoonfuls 
of white sugar, a teaspoonful of salt and half a 
yeast-cake dissolved in warm water, stir in enough 
flour to make a soft dough, work all together well 
and set to rise at night. In the morning, knead 
thoroughly and make up into rolls ; set these closely 
together in a tin, — it should be a round tin to be 
" like mother used to make," — let them rise to 
twice their original bulk, and bake in a steady oven. 

SALLY LUNN 

Beat four eggs stiflf, add to them half a cupful of 
melted butter, a teaspoonful of salt and a pinch of 
soda, a cupful of warm milk and a cupful of warm 
water in which has been dissolved half a yeast-cake. 
Into this stir four cupfuls of flour, beating hard, 
and set to rise in a well-greased tin. Mother used 
to bake it in a pudding-dish and it was sent to table 
in this, but it looks uncommonly well when turned 
out of a well-buttered pan. Cover it closely and 
set it to rise for from six to eight hours — the latter 
if it is kept in a cool place. Bake steadily for forty 
minutes, keeping it covered for twenty-five minutes. 
Eat hot with butter — and thank Heaven for the 
gift of cooks. 



6 "LIKE MOTHER USED TO MAKE" 

RAISED APPLE BISCUIT 

Scald a cupful of milk, put into it a tablespoonful 
of butter and set aside until lukewarm. Add a ta- 
blespoonful of sugar and half a yeast-cake dissolved 
in warm water. Sift a teaspoonful of salt in a cup- 
ful of flour and stir the liquid into this. Beat into 
a batter and set aside to rise. At the end of four 
hours add to it a cupful of apple, pared and grated, 
and another cupful of flour, through which half a 
teaspoonful of baking soda has been twice sifted. 
Let this rise an hour in a warm place, then form 
into round, flat cakes, put them close together in a 
pan, let them rise to twice their bulk, and bake in a 
steady oven. Split while hot and eat with butter 
and sugar. 

MOTHER'S MUFFINS 

Melt a tablespoonful of butter and one of lard 
and put with a quart of milk. Add two beaten eggs 
and half a compressed yeast-cake, dissolved in warm 
water. Stir in flour to make a rather stiff batter, 
and a teaspoonful of salt. Set to rise overnight 
and in the morning turn int6 muffin-tins, let 
them rise twenty minutes in a warm corner and 
bake. 



" LIKE MOTHER USED TO MAKE " 7 

EGG MUFFINS 

Beat the yolks and whites of three eggs separ- 
ately and very stiff. Add three cupfuls of milk and 
a quart of flour. Beat very hard, and bake in 
greased and warmed muffin-tins, 

HOME MUFFINS 

Make a batter of four cupfuls of milk, two ta- 
blespoonfuls of sugar and one of butter, a teaspoon- 
ful of salt, half a yeast-cake dissolved in warm 
water, and flour. Let this rise overnight. In the 
morning whip in four eggs. Bake about twenty 
minutes. 

RISEN WAFFLES 

Mix a quart of milk, two tablespoonfuls of 
melted butter, a teaspoonful of salt, a quart of flour 
and half a yeast-cake overnight. Let them rise un- 
til morning, add two beaten eggs and bake in a reg- 
ulation waffle-iron. 

MOTHER'S WAFFLES 

Sift two heaping teaspoonfuls of baking-powder 
and half a teaspoonful of salt into three cupfuls of 
flour. Put together two cupfuls of milk, a table- 
spoonful of melted butter and two well-beaten eggs. 



8 " LIKE MOTHER USED TO MAKE " 

Add the flour and beat light, putting in a little more 
milk if the batter is too stiff to pour easily. Bake 
in waffle-irons. 

RICE WAFFLES 

To one cupful of cold boiled rice add half a table- 
spoonful of melted butter, two cupfuls of milk, a 
teaspoonful of salt, two teaspoonfuls of baking- 
powder, two eggs whipped light, and flour to make 
a thin batter. Beat all the ingredients well to- 
gether, and bake as you would other waffles, taking 
pains to grease the irons very thoroughly, so that 
the rice may not stick. 

RAISED BUCKWHEAT CAKES 

To four cupfuls of buckwheat flour add one cup- 
ful of corn meal and a teaspoonful of salt, two ta- 
blespoonfuls of thick molasses, half a cake of yeast 
dissolved, and warm water enough to make a thin 
batter. After beating it thoroughly set in a warm 
place overnight. Sometimes the batter has the 
least sour taste in the morning which can be rem- 
edied by the addition of a pinch of soda dissolved in 
hot water. 

CORN-MEAL CAKES 

Four cupfuls of milk, a teaspoonful of salt, half 



" LIKE MOTHER USED TO MAKE " 9 

a yeast-cake and flour for a batter should be put 
together overnight and left to rise. In the morn- 
ing a tablespoonful of butter melted, and two eggs, 
should be added to it. For some reason I have 
never understood, these were sometimes called 
" flannel cakes " — perhaps because they were 
warming in their effect ! 

BREAD-AND-MILK CAKES 

Two cupfuls of stale bread crumbs worked 
smooth with four cupfuls of milk, a tablespoonful 
of melted butter, three eggs, a teaspoonful of salt 
and just enough flour to bind the mixture. More 
milk can be added if the batter is too thick. Bake 
on a very well-greased griddle. 

BEATEN BISCUIT 

Work a tablespoonful of lard into three cupfuls 
of flour, to which has been added a scant teaspoon- 
ful of salt. Stir into this milk and water in equal 
parts to make a stiff dough — as stiff as can be han- 
dled. Lay this on a block of wood and beat stead- 
ily fifteen minutfes with rolling-pin or with the flat 
side of a hatchet. Cut into round cakes, prick on 
top and bake in a rather quick oven.

Oysters and Terrapin 

Show me the man or woman of Virginia birth or 
breeding who believes it is possible to get as good 
oysters at the North as you can find at the South! 
In vain may you dilate upon the merits of Shrews- 
burys or Blue Points or Buzzard's Bay oysters. 
Arguments and proofs go for naught. At the end 
of the discussion the reply will match the statement 
made at the beginning : " There are no oysters I 
have ever eaten equal to York River and Chesa- 
peake Bay oysters." And there is likely to be the 
further statement, "They don't know how to cook 
them up North as they do down home." In other 
words, they don't taste " like mother used to make." 

I do not hold a brief for the Virginia oysters, 
although it is my own private opinion that there 
are no others like them! But I do know that the 
Northern and Southern ways of cooking them are 
entirely different and to make them taste as they 
should to me you must either have a Southern cook 



"LIKE MOTHER USED TO MAKE" ii 

at the stove or mother or mother's directions to 
guide you. 

How I recollect Virginia oysters and Virginia 
cookery thereof since my childhood, — stewed oys- 
ters, fried oysters, roast oysters, scalloped oysters, 
broiled oysters, pickled oysters ! There was no talk 
in that time of " milk stew " and " water stew." 
Oysters were just stewed, that was all. Of course 
they had milk with them. Mother would not have 
thought of stewing them without milk — > or cream. 
And broiled oysters were not smothered in batter, 
either, nor was batter used in cooking fried oysters. 
It would have seemed an- outrage. But now I have 
to go all the way to Virginia to get real fried oys- 
ters, — and I am told that even in the Old Dominion 
are to be found cooks who have forsaken old cus- 
toms and fry their oysters in a coating of batter. 

Terrapin was not so everyday an affair as oys- 
ters, by any means, but the " diamond backs " were 
plenty in the low grounds along the James River 
and no one could consider herself an experienced 
cook who did not know one or two ways in which 
to prepare it. 

STEWED OYSTERS 

Not oyster stew, if you please! It was never 



12 " LIKE MOTHER USED TO MAKE " 

called that in the old times and I don't believe it has 
that name applied to it at the South even now, ex- 
cept by outsiders. 

Add a half pint of hot water to the liquor drained 
from two quarts of oysters. Put a little salt and 
pepper with it, set over the fire and let it boil up 
once. Turn in the oysters and let them cook for 
not more than five minutes or until the gills begin 
to crimp. Watch carefully for this stage, as every 
second beyond it means injury to the flavor of the 
oyster. Add two tablespoonfuls of butter and a 
large cupful of boiling milk. Take from the fire 
immediately and serve as soon as possible. Never 
let them stand at the back of the stove and keep 
warm unless you prefer them tough and tasteless. 

FRIED OYSTERS 

For this you must select fine large oysters and 
have them nearly uniform in size. Discrepancies 
in dimensions may be permitted with stewed oys- 
ters that could not be tolerated with the fried bi- 
valves. Drain them from the liquor and lay them 
on a soft cloth to dry, pressing them lightly with 
another to remove all the moisture possible. 

Roll each oyster in fine cracker crumbs, coating 



" LIKE MOTHER USED TO MAKE " 13 

it fully and lay them carefully in the frying pan, 
where there should be enough good butter, boiling 
hot, to immerse the oysters. Fry quickly to a deli- 
cate brown and take at once from the pan, with a 
fork or a split spoon and lay on a hot plate. These 
too should be eaten promptly, although they are not 
as irretrievably spoiled by standing as is the stewed 
oyster. Pass sliced lemon with fried oysters. 

BROILED OYSTERS 

For these too you must select large oysters, as 
you would if you were to fry them. Wipe them, 
dry as you would the oysters for frying, sprinkle 
salt and pepper lightly upon them and broil them on 
a small gridiron which has the bars close together. 
Special oyster broilers are made. If you cook them 
over the fire be careful they do not smoke if any of 
the drippings from them catch fire. Cook quickly 
and after you have laid them on a hot plate put a 
bit of butter on each one. 

PANNED OYSTERS 

For this we had special small pans at home, made 
to order and of a size to accommodate six or eight 
good sized oysters comfortably. You can, how- 



14 " LIKE MOTHER USED TO MAKE " 

ever, use nappies of the right size or small casse- 
roles, a little deeper than those sold for cooking 
shirred eggs. Cut a round of bread to fit the bot- 
tom of your pan, trimming oflf the crust. Toast 
and lay in the pan and moisten with a little oyster 
liquor. Lay the oysters on the toast, sprinkle 
lightly with salt and pepper and put over the oys- 
ters half a dozen bits of butter. Set the pans 
in an oven of steady heat and cook until the oysters 
" rufHe " or crimp, take from the fire and serve at 
once in the pans in which they are cooked. Pass 
lemon with these. They are an excellent supper 
or luncheon dish. 

ROAST OYSTERS 

Have the shell oysters carefully washed. If you 
have a coal stove you may roast them on the top or 
in the oven as you choose, but if you cook by gas, 
the oven will have to be used. In either case they 
will declare when they are done by opening. Pile 
on a large dish, taking care not to turn them on one 
side lest the juice run out. It takes a stout knife 
and some dexterity to open them entirely without 
spilling the liquor. Season as you eat with salt, 
pepper and butter. Those who shrink from the 



" LIKE MOTHER USED TO MAKE " 15 

"messiness" of opening the cooked oysters may 
have the work done while they are raw by a pro- 
fessional hand and may then set the opened oysters 
in the lower shell in a baking pan and put these into 
the oven to bake in their own liquor, serving them 
in the shell as soon as they are done. In either 
case have a big platter of thin brown and white 
bread and butter to eat with the oysters. 

VIRGINIA CREAMED OYSTERS 

Down on the Eastern Shore they have big clam 
shells, — at least, I suppose they are clam shells, for 
they are broad and shaped like a clam shell, al- 
though much larger than those we usually see, — 
and in these the oysters should be creamed if one 
would compass perfection in this dish. In default 
of these shells, however, one may use nappies or 
ramequins. Lay three or four oysters in each 
nappy or shell. Have ready a sauce made by cook- 
ing together two tablespoonfuls each of butter and 
flour until they bubble and pouring on them than a 
cup of oyster liquor and one of cream, — add a tiny 
pinch of baking soda to the cream, — and stir over 
the fire in a double boiler until you have a thick 
smooth sauce. Season to taste with salt and white

pepper, beat up hard once and pour over the oyg'- 
ters in the shells or the nappies. Set in the oveji, 
and after the shells or dishes are hot bake for ab(^ut 
five minutes. Serve in the dishes in which they are 
cooked. 

SCALLOPED OYSTERS. NO. i 

Butter a pudding dish and cover the bottom of it 
with a layer of crushed cracker crumbs and moisten 
them with oyster liquor and a little milk. On this 
put a layer of oysters, dotting it with bits of butter 
and seasoning with salt and pepper. Cover these 
with another layer' of crumbs, repeat that of the 
oysters, continuing in this order until the dish is full 
and making the top layer of crumbs. Strew thickly 
with bits of butter, bake covered for twenty min- 
utes and brown. 

SCALLOPED OYSTERS. NO. 2 

Make a cream sauce by cooking together a heap- 
ing tablespoonful of flour and two of butter until 
smooth and then adding to them a cupful of cream 
or rich milk and a half cupful of the oyster liquor. 
Stir until it thickens, put at the side of the stove, 
add a beaten egg, the raw oysters, and salt and white 
pepper to season sufficiently. Turn into a greased 



" LIKE MOTHER USED TO MAKE " 17 

pudding dish, strew crumbs thickly over the top, 
dot with flakes of butter, put in the oven and brown. 
As all the ingredients are hot, — except the oysters 
and crumbs, — 1 ten or twelve minutes in a good oven 
will be enough to cook the oysters and to brown the 
crumbs. 

OYSTER PIE 
In the old time a shallow pudding dish was lined 
with good puff paste, filled with crusts of bread, 
these covered with a top of the paste and baked. 
The edges of the dish were well buttered so that 
the crust would not adhere to them too closely and 
when the pastry was baked this top was lifted off 
carefully, the bread crusts removed and in their 
place were put oysters, prepared just as for oyster 
scallop in the preceding recipe, except that the oys- 
ters were allowed to cook in the sauce for three 
minutes after they went in. Then the crust was 
laid back on the dish and the whole sent to table. 
The argument against lining the pie dish with raw 
paste, putting in the uncooked oysters and baking 
all together was that by the time the paste was ready 
to eat the oysters were overdone and insipid. 

OYSTER FRITTERS 

Make a thin batter of flour, two beaten eggs and 



i8 " LIKE MOTHER USED TO' MAKE " 

equal quantities of milk and oyster liquor, adding! 
a little salt. The batter should be just thick enougW 
to mask the back of a spoon. Chop oysters fine/ 
in the proportion of two cups of the oysters to one 
of the batter, stir the oysters into the batter and 
drop it by the spoonful into deep boiling fat. Do 
not have less than a pound of lard in your frying 
pan and try one fritter first to see if the heat is 
right. The fritter should not take more than two 
minutes to cook and should not be too brown. 
Move a little away from the fiercest heat of the 
stove, so that the inside of the fritter may have a 
chance to cook before the outside is over brown. 

PICKLED OYSTERS 

Put two quarts of stewing oysters over the fire 
in their own liquor and leave them there until just 
before the liquor comes to a boil. Take them off 
and put to one side to cool, removing the oysters 
from the liquor with a strainer. Put the liquor back 
on the stove with a cupful of white vinegar, twelve 
whole cloves and as many whole black peppers, 
half a dozen blades of mace and a red pepper broken 
into small pieces. Boil up well and turn over the 
oysters. Cover and set aside. If you wish to keep 



" LIKE MOTHER USED TO MAKE " 19 

them for more than a day or two put them into 
glass jars with screw tops and set in a cool dark 
place. Exposure to the light changes their color. 
They will keep for a week or so but to my mind 
are at their best two or three days after they have 
been pickled. 

These are excellent for late suppers or for cold 
collations and will probably be welcomed by those 
who are tired of endless salads and sandwiches. 

TERRAPIN. NO. i 

Plunge the terrapin head downwards into boiling 
water, as you would a live lobster, and let him cook 
until the meat begins to loosen from the skin. Take 
the terrapin from the water, let him drain until cool 
enough to handle and then remove from the shell, 
taking great pains not to break the gall, as the least 
particle of this would ruin the meat. Remove the 
gall and entrails. All the rest of the terrapin is 
eatable. 

Cut him up into small pieces. Keep the juice 
that runs from the meat, put with it a tablespoon ful 
of currant jelly, two tablespoonfuls of butter, a 
wJneglassful of sherry and two wineglassfuls of 
port, a teaspoonful of Worcestershire sauce and a 



20 " LIKE MOTHER USED TO MAKE " 

pinch of cayenne and salt to taste. Stew all to- 
gether for fifteen minutes, put in the terrapin and 
cook for ten minutes longer. At the last add a cup- 
ful of rich cream, boil up once and serve. 

TERRAPIN. NO. 2 

Prepare the live terrapin as already directed and 
cut up into small pieces. Stew the juice with the 
meat for fifteen minutes, add to it a large table- 
spoonful of butter rolled in one of browned flour, 
and two tablespoonfuls of sherry, salt and pepper 
to taste and last stir in the beaten yolk of an egg, 
taking care that it does not curdle. Boil up once 
and serve. 

TERRAPIN. NO. 3 

After taking the terrapin from the shell and cut- 
ting it up put it into a saucepan and cover closely. 
Simmer fifteen minutes. Rub three tablespoonfuls 
of butter and the yolks of six hard boiled eggs to 
a smooth paste. Have ready in another saucepan a 
cupful of cream to which has been added a wee 
pinch of soda and work this into the egg and butter 
paste, a little at a time. Season to taste with salt 
and pepper and add the sauce to the hot terrapin. 
Cook two minutes, add a gill of sherry and serve. 



" LIKE MOTHER USED TO MAKE " 21 

TERRAPIN IN CHAFING DISH 

Cut up the cooked meat and put into the double 
boiler of a chafing dish with three tablespoonfuls of 
butter, and pepper and salt to taste. Cover and al- 
low it to simmer for ten minutes. At the last mo- 
ment, you may, if you wish, add a couple of table- 
spoonfuls of sherry, but you get the flavor of the 
terrapin better without it. 

"CHAD'S" TERRAPIN 

I cannot in this connection refrain from quoting 
from that delightful book, " Colonel Carter of Car- 
ter sville," the directions given by the old negro cook 
Chad for the proper enjoyment of terrapin. He 
had removed the upper shell from the terrapin to 
serve as a dish for the Major's meal. 

" Tar 'pin jes like a crab. Major, on'y got mo' 
meat to 'em. But you got to know 'em. Now dis 
yer shell is de hot plate, an' you do all yo' eatin' 
right inside it," said Chad, dropping a spoonful of 
butter, the juice of a lemon, and a pinch of salt into 
the impromptu dish. 

" Now, Major, take yo' fork an' pick out all dat 
black meat an' dip it in de sauce, an' wid ebery 



22 " LIKE MOTHER USED TO MAKE " 

mou'ful take one o' dem little yaller eggs. Dat's 
de way we eat tar'pin. Dis yer stewin' him up in 
pote wine is scan'lous. Can't taste nuffin but de 
wine. But dat's tar'pin."

"Hog and Hominy" 

The phrase " hog and hominy " has been em- 
ployed more or less in contempt by those who do 
not know how wide a scope the two words may 
possess. To the Southerner, who includes spare- 
rib, shoat, sausage, chine, ham — 'boiled, baked or 
barbecued — and like dainties under " hog," and 
who knows that batter bread, egg bread, corn 
bread, com pone, johnny-cake, ash-cake and a va- 
riety of griddle-cakes " like mother used to make " 
are among the products rather scornfully summed 
up as " hominy," the classification is a synonym for 
savory and appetizing food combinations little 
known north of Mason and Dixon's line. 

In point of fact, it was impossible in the old times 
to get most of these dishes at the North. For one 
thing, they do not cut pork at the North as they 
do at the South. The chine, instead of being 
cut as a saddle of mutton would be, is split 
lengthwise. All the meat, except one thin layer, is 

23 



24 " LIKE MOTHER USED TO MAKE " 

taken from the inside of the sparerib for bacon, — 
although I am told that in what is called " country 
sparerib " this is not done. This cut is seldom 
found in city markets, however, and the sparerib, 
as usually sold, is a poor, dry thing. Still, in some 
places it may yet be possible to find the old-fash- 
ioned chine and sparerib. 

In the former days it was also out of the question 
to buy the Southern meal at the North, and the 
products of the two sections are entirely different. 
I have heard the yellow corn-meal described by 
Southern housekeepers as " chicken feed," and I 
have known a few Northerners who cared little for 
the fruit of the Virginia mills and kitchen. To 
the Virginia " raised " child or the one who is for- 
tunate enough to have had Virginia cookery in her 
home there are no hot breads quite likfe those with 
the corn-meal foundation. 

To-day it is possible to obtain the Southern meal 
at the North and the gospel of batter bread is 
spreading. 

ROAST CHINE 

Although you cannot generally find the whole 
chine in the Northern markets, you can purchase a 
fair substitute in half a chine. The spine has been 



" LIKE MOTHER USED TO MAKE " 25 

split and the cut has a one-sided look, but it makes 
an excellent roast. Lay the meat in your baking- 
pan, brush it over with raw egg and strew thickly 
with cracker-crumbs, which you have seasoned well 
with pepper and salt, and bake in a good hot oven. 
When the meat is heated through, baste it with but- 
ter and water. The basting after that, which 
should be tolerably frequent, may be done with the 
gravy from the meat. After you take up the meat, 
set the gravy in cold water and remove the fat 
which rises to the top. Thicken the gravy which is 
left with browned flour, boil up once, season with 
catsup or Worcestershire sauce and send to the 
table in a gravy boat. 

ROAST SPARERIB 

It may be possible, in some market where they 
cut their own pork, to secure a sparerib from which 
most of the meat on the inside has not been re- 
moved. If so, this recipe is worth trying. Cover 
the meat closely until it is about half done, then un- 
cover and dredge with flour. Baste it often, the 
first time with butter and water, and after that with 
its own gravy. Five minutes before taking it out 
strew it thickly with fine bread-crumbs, to which 



26 "LIKE MOTHER USED TO MAKE^ 



you have added a teaspoonful of onion minced very 
fine, salt, pepper and a very little powdered sage. 
Let the meat cook five minutes longer, basting again 
with butter. Proceed with the gravy as directed in 
the recipe for roast chine. Both with chine and 
sparerib it is well to have the butcher cut the joints 
before it is sent home, as this will simplify carving. 

BOILED HAM 

Put the ham to soak over night in cold water and 
in the morning wash and scrub it well. Put it 
over the fire in plenty of cold water to cover it, and 
let it boil slowly fifteen minutes to the pound. It 
is a mistake to buy too large a ham, as the smaller 
hams usually come from younger pork. 

The best grade of Virginia hams are those which 
come from the county of Smithfield, where the pigs 
are fattened upon peanuts. The printed directions 
sent out with these hams by one firm which makes 
a specialty of them order that the ham shall be put 
into cold water with the skin side downwards, and 
that when it is cooked enough the ham will turn 
over of its own accord. Of course this sounds in- 
credible, and savors a bit- of the black art, — but the 
prediction comes true ! At the time when it should 
be taken from the fire the ham does turn over in the 



" LIKE MOTHER USED TO MAKE " 27 

water. I have never tried this with any ham but 
the Smithfield, but I dare say the same plan would 
work in the same way with pork that was not pea- 
nut-fed ! 

Let the ham get cold in the water and then re- 
move the skin. If you choose you can send it to 
table, " naked," as I have heard one housekeeper 
describe hams served with the fat uncovered, or 
you may brush it over with beaten egg, and cover it 
with a crust made by working cracker-crumbs into 
a thick paste with milk or cream and a little melted 
butter. This should be spread over the ham 
smoothly in a coating about a quarter of an inch 
thick, and the crust then lightly browned in the 
oven. 

BARBECUED HAM 

Cut rather thick slices of cold boiled ham and 
lay them in a frying-pan. Cook on both sides un- 
til they begin to crisp at the edges and then put on a 
hot dish. Add to the fat in the pan four table- 
spoonfuls of vinegar, a saltspoonful of English 
mustard, a teaspoonful of white sugar and a few 
dashes of black pepper. Boil up once, pour over 
the ham, let it stand covered for a couple of minutes 



28 "LIKE MOTHER USED TO MAKE" 

and send to the table. There is no more savory 
method of cooking ham than this, and it wins al- 
most universal approbation. 

BACON AND APPLES 

Have the bacon cut very thin, lay it in a hot pan 
and fry it quickly in its own fat. Keep it hot on 
a plate after taking it up, and fry in the fat left in 
the pan thick slices of cored but unpeeled apples. 
When cooked tender, serve in the dish with the 
bacon, the latter laid about the edge of the platter. 
If the apples are very tart sprinkle a little granu- 
lated sugar upon them just before taking them from 
the pan. Sweet or semi-sweet apples are best for 
this dish. 

PORK POTPIE 

Use lean pork for this, that from the chine by 
preference, and have the bones well cracked. 
Choose a wide pot, grease it thoroughly that the 
crust may not stick, and line it with a good plain 
paste. Parboil and slice potatoes; put a layer of 
pork in the pot on the paste, then a layer of potatoes. 
Season each layer judiciously with pepper and salt. 
When the materials are all used, pour a quart of 
cold water into the pot, lay a round of paste over 



" LIKE MOTHER USED TO MAKE " 29 

the top, leaving a hole in the middle of the round 
through which more water may be added if the 
gravy cooks away too rapidly. If you desire 
dumplings you can mingle small squares and strips 
of the paste with the meat and potatoes. Cover 
the pot and boil slowly for two hours. At the end 
of the time take off the crust, pour the meat and 
gravy into another dish and remove the lower crust 
carefully. Put this on a hot platter, arrange the 
meat and potatoes upon it and pour the gravy over 
all, last putting on the top crust. This may have 
been browned by laying it on the top grating of the 
oven while dishing the meat and the lower crust. 

ROAST PIG 

Almost always one may procure a small pig by 
ordering it in advance from a butcher, who will 
clean and prepare and deliver it ready for stuffing. 
The roasting pig should never be more than a month 
or six weeks old. 

The dressing may be made by seasoning a cupful 
of dry bread-crumbs with two teaspoonfuls of pow- 
dered sage, a tablespoonful of chopped onion, half 
a teaspoonful of salt, a saltspoonful of pepper and 
three tablespoonfuls of melted butter. Mix all well 



30 " LIKE MOTHER USED TO MAKE " 

together and add two eggs well beaten. Stuff the 
pig, doing your best to give him his original figure. 
Sew up the opening by which the dressing went in 
and truss him for cooking, tucking his fore legs 
under him bent backward, and his hind legs drawn 
forward. Skewer and bind them in place. Wipe 
the pig off, dredge him well with flour and put him 
in the dripping-pan with a little hot water poured 
about him. Baste him three or four times with 
butter and water and afterwards with the gravy. 
When the skin shows signs of beginning to brown 
rub him over with a cloth dipped in melted butter 
and repeat this process every five or ten minutes 
in order to keep the skin tender. Your pig will 
require about two hours in a steady oven and the 
skin, when done, should be crisp " crackling." 

" The first one of these weaklings and flowers " 
— to quote Charles Lamb — " that I ever saw was 
at my grandfather's when I was a small child; and 
to this day I recall the impression he made as he 
lay in his bed of parsley, cranberries for eyes and a 
lemon in his mouth." 

For a gravy you can skim the dripping in the pan, 
thicken with browned flour and season with cat- 
sup, lemon juice and wine. But, to my mind, he 



" LIKE MOTHER USED TO MAKE " 31 

is better cold than hot, and he is good as long as 
there is a bit of him left ! 

JOHNNY-CAKE 

Mix a teacupful of sweet milk with one of sour 
or buttermilk, add a teaspoonful of baking-soda 
dissolved in hot water, a teaspoonful of salt and a 
tablespoonful of melted butter. Stir into this 
enough corn-meal to make a soft dough which can 
be handled. Roll it out in a sheet about half an inch 
thick and lay in a biscuit-tin. Bake in a rather slow 
oven for forty minutes, brushing it over frequently 
with a bit of cloth dipped in melted butter. This 
should be done four or five times after the bread 
begins to brown. 

In the old days this bread was baked on a hard- 
wood plank in front of the open fire. The board 
was tipped up at such an angle that the full heat 
was secured, but not far enough to permit the dough 
to slip off. The basting with butter was performed 
so frequently that the bread when done was deli- 
ciously crisp. 

VIRGINIA CORN PONE 

Stir a teaspoonful of salt and a tablespoonful of 
melted lard into a quart of corn-meal and add 



32 "LIKE MOTHER USED TO MAKE" / 

/ 

enough cold water to make a soft dough. Shape 
with the hands into oblong rolls like little loaves and 
bake quickly in a well-greased pan. Serve hot, 
break open and eat with butter. 

BATTER-BREAD 

Sift two cups Southern corn-meal — that in com- 
mon use at the North will not answer at all — stir 
into it a good teaspoonful of salt and work into it 
a tablespoonful of melted butter. Beat two eggs 
light, put with them a quart of milk, stir in the meal 
and bake in well-greased tin pie plates. The bread 
is cut into triangles, split open and buttered and 
eaten very hot. It may also be baked in muffin- 
tins, but the genuine Virginia batter-bread of my 
childhood was always baked in the shallow pie 
dishes. 

EGG BREAD 

Beat three eggs light and add to three cups of 
milk, stir into this two cups of the Southern water- 
ground corn-meal, a teaspoonful of salt, a tiny pinch 
of soda, a tablespoonful of melted butter and a cup^ 
ful of well-boiled cold rice. Whip all together for 
two or three minutes and bake like the batter-bread. 



" LIKE MOTHER USED TO MAKE " 33 

RAISED CORNBREAD 

Dissolve a yeast-cake in a pint of lukewarm 
water. Measure three pints of Southern corn- 
meal, add to this a teaspoonful of salt and a table- 
spoonful of melted butter and stir into it the warm 
water in which the yeast-cake has been dissolved. 
Turn into a greased baking-tin, set to rise overnight 
and in the morning bake, covering it until done 
through and then uncovering to brown. 

Or you may set the dough in a bowl overnight 
and the next morning bake in muffin-tins. 



IV 
Chicken Cookery 

Poultry was no special treat in the Old Domin- 
ion, but was rather a staff of life. " Butchers' 
meat," so-called, was not always attainable, but the 
chicken supply was plentiful and cheap; you could 
buy a pair of roasting chickens in the market for 
fifty cents. 

The birds were always ready dressed. The old- 
fashioned Southern housekeeper held that the craw 
and intestines absolutely poisoned the meat if al- 
lowed to remain ip long after the fowl was killed. 
Nowadays we are told that poultry keeps better 
when the internal arrangements are not exposed to 
the air. Both theories may be true, and the dis- 
crepancy is possibly due to the difference in climate. 
But the poultry my mother used to supervise in 
preparation was cooped up for a day or two before 
it was to be killed, and was picked and dressed as 
soon as possible after its execution. It must not be 
cooked, however, for six or eight hours after this, 

34 



" LIKE MOTHER USED TO MAKE " 35 

and I well recall the disgust of my mother, when 
as a child I read her a story in which a New Eng- 
land housekeeper tells her husband to hurry out into 
the yard and kill a chicken, as supper must be ready 
in an hour. 

Fried chicken is, of course, my chief recollection 
of the poultry dishes mother used to make. We 
had roast chicken, besides, and barbecued and 
smothered and boiled chicken, and roast and boiled 
turkey and roast duck. But fried chicken was as 
regular an article on the Virginia bill of fare as 
beefsteak is in some Northern homes, — chicken 
fried plain or with cream gravy, with bacon or with- 
out. Broiled chicken appeared pretty often, — we 
always had it for breakfast Sunday morning, — 
but it was not such a real Virginia dish as fried 
chicken. The Southern cook of old time might 
fail on anything else in the culinary line, but I don't 
believe I ever heard of one who got her " han' 
out " in cooking poultry. 

FRIED CHICKEN WITH CREAM GRAVY 

For this you must have young chickens, broiling 
size, and they must be cut apart as for fricassee, 
rinsed, wiped dry, peppered lightly and then rolled 



36 " LIKE MOTHER USED TO MAKE " 

in flour, a piece at a time. Meanwhile half a pound 
of salt pork should have been sliced and cooked in 
a frying-pan long enough to make the fat flow, but 
not enough to brown the pork. In this fat lay the 
pieces of chicken and fry to a good brown, turning 
the pieces as they cook. When all are done take 
out with a fork, so as to free from grease, and lay 
in a hot dish. Set this in the open oven and pour 
into the gravy left in the frying-pan a cupful of 
rich milk, — half cream is better, — add a table- 
spoonful of flour rubbed smooth with a tablespoon- 
ful of butter, stir until the sauce has boiled smooth 
and thick, add a tablespoonful of minced parsley 
and pour over the chicken. 

THE OLD-FASHIONED SMOTHERED 
CHICKEN 

Split young chickens as you would for broiling, 
washing and wiping them inside and out. Lay 
them then skin downwards on the grating of the 
covered roaster. Put on the cover and set in a very 
hot oven. After ten minutes, uncover and baste 
the chickens with spoonfuls of melted butter. A 
half-cupful is none too much. When they begin to 
color on the inside turn them over and baste again. 
In about twenty-five minutes dredge them well with 



^ LIKE MOTHER USED TO MAKE " 37 



flour, baste again and cook five or ten minutes 
longer. If they are young and tender less than 
three-quarters of an hour should suffice for making 
them brown and juicy. Frequent basting is essen- 
tial. Put on a hot dish, thicken the gravy in the 
pan with a tablespoonful of browned flour, add half 
a cupful of boiling water, boil up once and pour 
over the chicken. 

Before the days of covered roasters, my mother 
used to lay a small gridiron in the dripping-pan, to 
serve as a grating, and turn another pan over the 
top. She herself can remember that in her childish 
days the cooking was all done before a huge open 
fire. Then there was a metal oven standing on feet 
which raised it high enough from the ground to per- 
mit of fire being put under it. The coals were put 
on top and the chicken was cooked in this. If there 
was no gridiron small enough to fit into the pan, 
clean hickory sticks were laid in it to make a grating 
on which to raise the chicken from the surface of 
the pan. She says smothered chicken tasted better 
in those days than when cooked in a stove, but it 
is good enough for any one now, whether it comes 
from a wood or a coal or a gas range, if cooked by 
mother's recipe. 



38 " LIKE MOTHER USED TO MAKE " 

DELICIOUS CHICKEN POTPIE 

For this you will need a tender roasting chicken, 
which should be cut up as for fricassee. Have 
sliced also half a pound of salt pork. Make a pie- 
paste, butter the bottom and side of a pot thor- 
oughly, — • be careful with this, to prevent sticking, — 
and line the pot with your paste. Have some of the 
paste cut into squares for dumplings. Put a layer 
of the sliced pork in the bottom of the pot, on the 
paste, sprinkle it with pepper and put in a layer of 
the chicken. Mix with this the pastry squares. 
Follow this with another layer of pork, then more 
chicken and so on until all are used. Cut a round 
of pastry quite thick, make a couple of slits in it and 
lay it over the top of the contents of the pot. Let 
these contents heat very slowly and cook from two 
to three hours. 

Sometimes the bottom crust — i which had a trick 
of burning — 'was omitted and only a top crust 
used. When this was the case, mother heated the 
shovel red hot and held it over the top of the pot 
until the paste was well browned and then lifted it 
off carefully and put it to one side until the chicken 
was dished; then the crust was laid on top of the 
chicken.

HOW TO FRICASSEE CHICKEN 

Young chickens were used for this dish and were 
cut up in the usual fashion, and laid in cold water 
for half an hour before they were put in a saucepan 
with just enough cold water to cover them. Half 
a pound of salt pork, cut into strips, was fried 
crisp, chopped fine and put into the pot with the 
chicken, and into the fat in which the pork had been 
fried was put a good-sized onion, sliced. When 
this had been fried it, too, was added to the chicken, 
as well as a saltspoonful each of allspice and cloves. 
The pot was covered and all stewed together very 
slowly for about an hour. When the test of a fork 
proved that the chicken was tender it was taken out 
and closely covered in a dish. A spoonful of wal- 
nut or mushroom catsup was added to the gravy, 
two heaping tablespoonfuls of browned flour, a lit- 
tle chopped parsley, and last of all a glassful of 
brown sherry or madeira. The gravy was boiled 
up once, all floating bits of pork or onion removed 
with a strainer, the chicken put back into it for a 
minute and all brought to a boil and then dished. 

THE FAMOUS BRUNSWICK STEW OF 
CHICKEN 

Cut into joints a large fowl. Have ready a 



40 " LIKE MOTHER USED TO MAKE " 

broad pot or saucepan, — one of generous size. In 
the bottom of this put a layer of chopped salt pork, 
and upon this strew a teaspoonful of minced onion. 
Next should come a layer of thinly sliced, parboiled 
potatoes, one of green corn, cut from the cob, one 
of lima beans, and last the chicken. Begin then 
again with the salt pork and continue in the same 
order as before, repeating the process until all the 
materials are used up. There should have been 
half a dozen potatoes, three large onions, three ears 
of corn, a pint of lima beans and a half-pound of 
salt pork. Pour over all three quarts of boiling 
water, cover closely and stew steadily and slowly 
for three hours. Uncover then and put in a quart 
of peeled and sliced tomatoes, two teaspoonfuls of 
white sugar, a tablespoonful of salt and a half tea- 
spoonful of black pepper. Cook an hour more, put 
in four tablespoonfuls of butter rubbed smooth with 
two of flour, boil five minutes longer and serve. 

This is, in reality, the famous squirrel stew 
named for the county of Brunswick in Virginia, 
where it had its birth, — or its discovery, or its in- 
vention, or whatever is the correct name to apply 
to a work of culinary genius. But squirrels were 
not always attainable in our home and chickens 



" LIKE MOTHER USED TO MAKE " 41 

made so admirable a substitute that we were in dan- 
ger of forgetting the real genesis of our favorite 
dish. I have never known any one to eat Bruns- 
wick stew, properly made, who did not enjoy it. 



Salads and Vegetables 

In the old times in the South they knew little of 
green salads, and a French dressing was in many- 
regions practically an unknown quantity. Mayon- 
naise, too, was not to be reckoned with then, al- 
though I was quite a young girl when I first rec- 
ollect its appearance. 

But the chicken salad " mother used to make " 
was better to rpe than any compounded by modern 
methods, good as this often is. The cold slaw of 
those days also was different from that which we 
have now, and more appetizing, and I recall a po- 
tato salad which was delicious and not in the least 
like the dish which is usually served under that 
name in the North. 

All of these were made with special dressings 
and had their appointed place on the supper-table, 
although they were sometimes served as a side dish 
at dinner. This was where lettuce and cucumbers 
and tomatoes appeared. The idea of making a 

42 



" LIKE MOTHER USED TO MAKE " 43 

separate course of lettuce or of any one of the other 
salads, and breaking for it the sequence of the 
heavy, old-fashioned dinner, would have been 
deemed absurd. 

Vegetables, too, were cooked in different style 
under mother's regime of that day and that place. 
They had longer cooking, for one thing, which to 
my mind is an improvement, and green vegetables 
nearly always had a bit of pork or bacon boiled with 
them. There was not so large a variety then as we 
have in our markets now, but those in use were 
cooked so differently that they seemed like other 
products. The methods then in service might be 
introduced with advantage by those housekeepers 
who wish diversity and can not afford forced veg- 
etables. 

Both of salads and vegetables there are too many 
to attempt to give anything like all, but I have made 
a selection of certain ones which stand out in my 
memory as of especial excellence. 

CHICKEN SALAD 

Cut the white meat of cold roast chicken or tur- 
key into neat small pieces (never chop it), picking 
out all bits of skin or gristle. When it is all cut, 



44 "LIKE MOTHER USED TO MAKE" 

measure it and allow three-quarters as much celery 
as you have meat, cutting the celery, too, into small 
bits. Mix them and put them into a large dish. 
Make a dressing by rubbing smooth the yolks of 
two hard-boiled eggs with a teaspoonful each of 
salt, pepper and white sugar. Add a half -teaspoon- 
ful of made mustard and then four tablespoonfuls 
of salad oil, a drop at a time and stirred in thor- 
oughly, the yolk of a raw egg, well beaten, and 
then a scant half-cupful of vinegar, a little at a time, 
beating well while this is going in. After you have 
sprinkled the meat and celery with a little salt and 
pepper, pour the dressing over them and stir it in 
well and then put into the salad bowl, garnishing 
the top with the rings of the boiled whites of eggs 
and celery tops. 

LOBSTER SALAO 

For the dressing of lobster salad put the yolks 
of four hard-boiled eggs in a china bowl and rub 
smooth and free from lumps with the back of a 
spoon. Work into them two teaspoonfuls of white 
sugar, one teaspoonful of salt and one of made 
mustard, a saltspoonful of red pepper, two table- 
spoonfuls of salad oil, one teaspoonful of anchovy 



" LIKE MOTHER USED TO MAKE " 45 

sauce and the coral from the lobster. This coral 
should have been broken fine. Cut the mixture 
with vinegar until it is thin enough to pour. Ar- 
range the lobster, cut with a sharp knife in pieces 
of convenient size, on lettuce leaves, and pour the 
dressing over it just before sending to table. 
Have dressing and salad alike ice cold. 

COLD SLAW OR CABBAGE SALAD 

Put into a saucepan a cup of vinegar, a table- 
spoonful each of sugar and of butter, a pinch of 
pepper and a teaspoonful of salt. Set over the fire 
and stir until the ingredients come to a boil. Have 
shredded fine a head of white cabbage, rejecting 
the green outer leaves, and pour the dressing over 
the cabbage while scalding hot. Set it aside to 
cool and when chilled put it on the ice. Just before 
using stir into the salad two tablespoonfuls of sour 
cream, beaten light with a fork. 

LETTUCE SALAD 

Rub to a paste the yolks of two hard-boiled eggs, 
half a teaspoonful each of salt and made mustard, 
a teaspoonful each of sugar and of white pepper, 
and two teaspoonfuls of salad oil. If you do not 
care for the oil substitute melted butter. Beat in 



46 "LIKE MOTHER USED TO MAKE" 

four tablespoonfuls of vinegar and after cutting the 
lettuce up with a sharp knife, pour the dressing 
over it. A better way to present-day ideas would 
be to tear the lettuce or break it into small pieces, 
but in the old time it was always cut into strips with 
the help of a knife and fork. Do not let it stand 
after the dressing is poured over it, but have both 
lettuce and dressing well chilled before mixing 
them. 

COLLARDS 

For this dish the tender shoots of the cabbage 
are taken in the spring when the roots which have 
been left in the ground over winter begin to send 
up leaves and stalks. Pick them over carefully 
and lay in salted cold water for half an hour. 
Drain and put in a saucepan with boiling water and 
cook them fast until they are tender. Often a piece 
of pork or bacon is boiled with them. Put the meat 
in first and let it boil ten minutes before adding the 
vegetables. Drain and chop the coUards and dress 
with butter, pepper and salt. 

BEET TOPS 

To prepare this dish young beets must be sacri- 
ficed. While little thicker than the finger they 



" LIKE MOTHER USED TO MAKE " 47 

must be pulled, shaken from the dirt, well washed 
and put over the fire in salted boiling water. Boil 
until the beets are tender, drain and serve hot, 
dressed with salt and pepper and plenty of butter. 
A delicious dish, and, while not attainable by dwell- 
ers in the city, is within reach of those who own gar- 
dens. 

ASPARAGUS 

Wash and scrape the asparagus and throw into 
cold water. Tie up loosely with a soft string and 
put over the fire in boiling salted water. Cook until 
tender, take from the stove and drain. Trim the 
crust from slices of stale bread, toast and butter it 
and lay it in the bottom of a vegetable dish. Soften 
it with a few spoonfuls of the liquor in which the 
asparagus was boiled ; lay the asparagus evenly upon 
this and butter it plentifully. In the old times white 
sauce was the exception rather than the rule for as- 
paragus — at least, in Virginia. 

BUTTERED PARSNIPS 

Boil the parsnips tender and scrape of? the skin, 
slice lengthwise less than half an inch thick and put 
into a saucepan. Add to them three tablespoonfuls 
of melted butter, a little chopped parsley, and salt 



48 " LIKE MOTHER USED TO MAKE " 

and pepper to taste. Shake over the fire until the 
butter bubbles and boils, then take out the parsnips 
carefully, add a tablespoonful of cream to the sauce 
left over the fire, boil up once and pour on the pars- 
nips in the dish. 

SALSIFY FRITTERS 

Scrape the skin ofif the salsify (which in the old 
days at the South no one dreamed of calling oyster- 
plant) and throw into cold water for twenty min- 
utes. Put over the fire in boiling salted water, stew 
until tender, drain and set aside to cool. When 
cold, mash smooth, removing the fibrous portions, 
and moisten with a little milk. To every cupful of 
this paste add one egg and a tablespoonful of butter, 
beating the eggs light before putting them in. Salt 
and pepper to taste, make the paste into cakes of 
uniform size, dredge them with flour and fry to a 
good brown in shallow fat. 

CORN PUDDING 

Grate corn from the cobs of a dozen good-sized 
ears and put with it the well-beaten yolks of five 
eggs. Stir well, add two tablespoonfuls of melted 
butter, beat in a quart of milk, a tablespoonful of 
sugar and a teaspoonful of salt. Beat hard and at 



" LIKE MOTHER USED TO MAKE " 49 

the last put in the whites of the five eggs, whipped 
to a stiff froth. Turn into a buttered baking-dish, 
bake covered for twenty-five minutes, uncover and 
brown. A delicious vegetable. 

CORN FRITTERS 

To every two cupfuls of corn, grated from the 
ear before cooking, allow two eggs and three table- 
spoonfuls of cream or milk. Whip the eggs light, 
beat in the corn a little at a time, add a tablespoon- 
ful of butter for two cupfuls of the corn. Salt to 
taste, add the cream or milk, and lastly, put in a 
couple of tablespoonfuls of flour, — enough to hold 
the fritters together. Cook upon a griddle as you 
would pancakes or by the tablespoonful dropped in 
boiling fat. 

SCALLOPED EGG PLANT 

Cut the egg plant into slices, peel and boil until 
soft, then arrange in a bake-dish with alternate lay- 
ers of crumbs, pepper, salt and butter. Bake cov- 
ered half an hour, uncover and brown. 

STRING OR " SNAP " BEANS 

String carefully, trimming off the ends and sides, 
cut into inch lengths and lay in slightly salted water

for ten or fifteen minutes. Drain the beans and put 
them in a saucepan of boiling water with a cube of 
salt pork or of bacon, cooking half an hour if the 
beans are young and tender, from an hour to two 
hours if they are older and firmer. The long boil- 
ing improves them. Drain them, dress with a little 
butter, pepper and salt, and serve. 

TURNIP TOPS 

These are the young shoots the turnips put up in 
the Spring when they have been left in the ground 
all Winter, as is done at the South. Even in the 
North the turnips sprout in the root cellar, and these 
shoots make excellent eating. Cut them off, wash 
them well and put them over the fire in a plenty of 
boiling water. Cook in this ten minutes. In an- 
other vessel have a piece of corned pork stewing, 
and when you have drained the turnip tops or " tur- 
nip salad " as it was called in Virginia, put them in 
with the pork and let them simmer twenty minutes 
longer. Drain again, lay the pork in the middle of 
the dish and arrange the greens about it. Eat with 
the addition of lemon juice or vinegar. 

Care must be taken to use an abundance of water 
in the first boiling, to rid the turnip tops of the 



"LIKE MOTHER USED TO MAKE" 51 

slight bitter flavor that would otherwise cling to 
them. 

BLACK EYED PEAS 

When these are green they will not require pre- 
liminary soaking, but when they are dry they must 
be soaked overnight. Put them over the fire in hot 
water with a piece of " middling " or bacon, and 
boil until tender, — half an hour about for the green 
peas, an hour and a half for the dry. Drain, mash 
slightly with the back of a spoon, fry half a dozen 
thin slices of bacon in a frying-pan, take them out 
and lay to one side and put in the half mashed peas. 
Cook until they are slightly crisped and browned on 
one side and turn out on a dish. Lay the strips of 
bacon about the beans. 

LARGE HOMINY, BOILED 

At the North this is termed samp. Soak it over- 
night and in the morning put it over the fire with 
plenty of water and boil three or four hours until 
soft. Drain, turn into a vegetable dish and eat as 
a vegetable with butter, salt and pepper. 

LARGE HOMINY, FRIED 

Put a large tablespoonful of bacon dripping or of 



52 " LIKE MOTHER USED TO MAKE " 

butter into the frying pan, and as soon as this is hot 
turn in enough of the large hominy, boiled as in the 
preceding recipe, to cover the bottom of the pan two 
or three inches deep. Cook until it is browned on 
the under side and turn it out so that the browned 
part is uppermost. This may be garnished with 
fried bacon, if desired.

Southern Sweet Dishes 

" Why do I never get such pound-cake as this any- 
where but from a Southern kitchen? " I asked a 
friend the other day. 

The cake in question was even brown without, a 
clear gold within, fine in texture and delicious in 
flavor. 

" I don't know why," she answered, " except that 
I think the Northern cooks are not generous enough 
with their eggs and butter. You know you just 
can't be stingy when you are making pound-cake." 

" It tastes * like mother — and grandmother — 
used to make,' " I sighed, taking another piece. 

Not only the pound-cake was better in those old 
days, but sponge-cake and layer-cake and, indeed, 
all cakes. I don't eat any gingerbread now like that 
of the old time. Nor do I find such wine jelly, such 
syllabubs, such whips, such pies! Those who are 
on the lookout for new sweets might do worse than 
takd a lesson from the dishes mother used to make 

S3 



54 " LIKE MOTHER USED TO MAKE " 

and set forth as a novelty something that seems new 
just because it is so old. I can vouch for the ac- 
curacy of the directions. 

POUND-CAKE 

One pound of eggs, one pound each of flour, of 
butter, of sugar; half teaspoonful grated nutmeg, 
one tablespoonful of best brandy. Wash the salt 
out of the butter, and cream it with the sugar. Beat 
the yolks and whites of the eggs separately and very 
light. Work the spice and brandy into the creamed 
sugar and butter, stir in the yolks of the eggs, and 
when well mixed add the sifted flour alternately 
with the whipped whites. Beat them in lightly, but 
do not stir them after they have been added. Make 
the batter for pound-cake as stiff as it can be stirred. 
Bake in a steady oven in either brick or melon tins. 

This is the genuine old-fashioned pound-cake and 
is very rich. A simpler cake may be made by using 
only three-quarters of a pound of butter, but the 
other ingredients the same as in the recipe given. 

OLD-TIME SPONGE-CAKE 

Weigh ten eggs and take their weight in sugar 
and half their weight in flour. Grate half the peel 
of a lemon and put with it all the juice of the lemon. 



" LIKE MOTHER USED TO MAKE " 55 

Beat the yolks until thick and smooth and add the 
sugar. Stir in the lemon- juice and peel, then the 
flour and, last of all, the stiffly-beaten whites. Bake 
in a steady oven, and take care that the kitchen is 
not jarred and that the oven door is opened and 
closed carefully while the cake is baking. 

SOFT GINGERBREAD 

One cupful each of butter, molasses, sugar and 
sour milk, two eggs, one tablespoonful of ginger 
and one teaspoon ful each of cinnamon and baking- 
soda, four and a half cupfuls of flour. Put the but- 
ter, molasses, sugar and spices together in a bowl 
and set them where they will warm gradually. 
When the butter softens, beat the contents of the 
bowl to a cream. Dissolve the soda in a little boil- 
ing water and stir this into the milk. Put this with 
the warmed mixture, add the eggs, beaten light with- 
out separating, and then put in the flour. If the 
amount given does not bring the mixture to the 
thickness of cup-cake batter, add a little more. Beat 
very hard before turning into well-buttered pans. 
Bake in a loaf or, if preferred, in small tins. 
CHEESE-CAKES 
Cream a half-pound of butter with a pound of 



56 " LIKE MOTHER USED TO MAKE " 

sugar, beat in the yolks of six eggs, the grated rind 
of two lemons and the juice of one, a grated nutmeg 
and a tablespoonful of brandy; last of all, stir in the 
whipped whites of the eggs. Line open patty-pans 
with good puff-paste and fill with the mixture. Lay 
strips of pastry in a lattice pattern across the top, 
and bake. Eat cold. 

TRANSPARENT PUDDINGS 

Prepare your filling as for cheese-cakes and bake 
in pie plates lined with rich pastry. Make a me- 
ringue by beating together the whites of four eggs, 
four tablespoonfuls of powdered sugar and the juice 
of a lemon. Spread this over the tops of the pies 
when they are baked and leave them in the oven long 
enough to brown the meringue lightly. 

SWEET POTATO PIE 

Parboil a pound of good sweet potatoes and when 
quite cold, grate them. Cream half a cupful of but- 
ter with three-quarters of a cupful of white sugar, 
stir in the beaten yolks of four eggs, a teaspoonful 
each of cinnamon and grated nutmeg and the juice 
and grated rind of a lemon. Whip in the grated 
potato, a cupful of milk and two tablespoonfuls of 
brandy, and, last, the beaten whites of the four eggs. 



" LIKE MOTHER USED TO MAKE " 57 

Bake in open pastry shells or as a pudding in a deep 
baking-dish without a crust. Eat cold. 

GOOSEBERRY TART 

Pick over your gooseberries, " top and tail " them 
and put into a saucepan with enough water to pre- 
vent burning. Simmer until they break, and 
sweeten to taste. If the gooseberries are green 
they will stand a great deal of sugar. Set them 
aside to cool and when cold pour into pastry shells. 
Cover with a thickness of puff-paste and bake well. 

SQUARE TURNOVERS 

For these, cut squares of good pastry. Make 
ready a filling by thickening a cupful of hot milk 
with three tablespoonf uls of flour wet to a paste with 
cold water. Let it boil for a minute, see that it is 
free from lumps, take from the fire and pour on 
three eggs, beaten well with a half cupful of pow- 
dered sugar. Return to the fire and stir to a thick, 
smooth cream. Flavor to taste. When cold put it 
by the spoonful in the middle of a square of the 
paste and fold the corners to the middle, pinching 
them together there. Bake to a good brown and 
eat cold. 



58 " LIKE MOTHER USED TO MAKE " 

SYLLABUBS 

Sweeten a pint of rich cream with a half cupful of 
fine sugar, stirring until the sugar is thoroughly dis- 
solved. Whip the cream light and then flavor with 
a glassful of sherry and a teaspoonful of vanilla. 
Serve at once, either in individual glasses or in a 
big bowl. 

WINE JELLY 

Soak one box of gelatin in one cupful of cold wa- 
ter for an hour, and then add to it three cupfuls of 
sugar, the juice of two lemons and the grated peel 
of one and a good pinch of cinnamon. Let all stand 
together in a cool place for an hour. Turn over 
them, then, a quart of boiling water, stir until the 
gelatin is entirely dissolved; add a pint of good 
sherry, strain through a flannel — do not squeeze it 
— and turn into a mold wet with cold water. If 
the gelatin does not dissolve, put it over the fire for 
a moment until the liquid comes to a boil. Do this, 
of course, before the wine goes in. 

GOOSEBERRY FOOL 

Stew a quart of ripe gooseberries in just enough 
water to cover them, and when soft rub them 
through a colander. Take the pulp that goes 



"LIKE MOTHER USED TO MAKE" 59 

through and beat into it a tablespoonful of butter, 
a cupful of sugar and the yolks of four eggs, well 
beaten. Heap in a glass dish and put on top a me- 
ringue made by whipping the whites of four eggs 
stiff with three tablespoonfuls of powdered sugar. 



VII 
Pickling and Preserving 

My grandmother, who was a notable housekeeper, 
did much of her conserving after dark. When the 
heat of the Southern day was past she would cook 
her jellies and preserved or pickled fruit in an out- 
door kitchen. My mother practiced the same phi- 
losophy and studied coolness of dress and conditions 
when preparing and putting up provisions for her 
jelly closet and preserve pantry. The example is 
worth following, for even at the North there are 
torrid days to be avoided when hot work over a 
stove must be done. 

MIXED PICKLES 

For this you must lay the vegetables in brine. 

The gherkins or small cucumbers should be packed 

in a crock with alternate layers of salt, and left in 

this, after pouring in water enough to cover the top 

layer, for a full week, stirring them up from the 

bottom every day or two. To keep the top layer 

from floating, place a weighted plate on it. When 

60 



"LIKE MOTHER USED TO MAKE" 6i 

ready to put up the pickles, go over the cucumbers 
carefully, rejecting all that are soft, and leave the 
others in fresh water forty-eight hours, changing 
the water once. 

The cauliflower for your pickles may be cut into 
small clusters and boiled in strong brine for three 
minutes, taken out, sprinkled with salt, and, when 
dry, brushed off and thrown into cold vinegar for 
two days. Select young string-beans, radish pods 
that are young and green, and " green " all the veg- 
etables together by laying them in a broad kettle 
which you have lined with vine leaves, sprinkling 
the pickles with a very little alum ; fill with cold wa- 
ter, covering with more vine leaves, and, after put- 
ting a close top on the kettle, steam for five or six 
hours. The water should not be allowed to boil. 
After the pickles are well greened they may be 
thrown into very cold water and left there half an 
hour. 

The vinegar for the pickles may be prepared by 
allowing a cupful of sugar, three dozen each of 
whole cloves and black peppers, a dozen blades of 
mace and eighteen whole allspice to each gallon of 
vinegar. Cook all together foi: five minutes, keep- 
ing at a steady boil, and then, having arranged your 



62 " LIKE MOTHER USED TO MAKE " 

prepared vegetables in a stone crock, pour the boil- 
ing vinegar upon them, cover, and set aside. The 
next day but one drain off the vinegar, make it 
scalding hot again and pour over the pickles, and 
do this on alternate days three times more. Close 
tightly the crock or jars containing the pickles and 
let them ripen for at least two months before you 
serve them. 

PEACH MANGOES 

Select large free-stone peaches. Use them be- 
fore they begin to mellow. Lay the fruit in a strong 
brine for a week. Dry them, cut a slice from the 
side of each peach and remove the stone, saving the 
slice to replace after the peach is stuffed. Make a 
stuffing of one teaspoonful each of ground nutmeg, 
mustard, mace, white sugar, celery seed and salad 
oil, a clove of garlic, chopped, a pinch of ginger, a 
dozen whole pepper-corns, and a tablespoonful of 
scraped horseradish. Mix all well and stuff into 
the hole in the peach. Make it as full as it will 
hold, replace the slice cut out, sew in with strong 
linen thread and put the peaches into pickle. Make 
this by adding a cupful of brown sugar to a gallon 
of vinegar and a half-teaspoonful of cayenne. 



" LIKE MOTHER USED TO MAKE " 63 

Bring this to a boil and pour, while scalding hot, 
over the peaches. 

PEPPER MANGOES 

Use large green peppers, cut a slit in the side and 
remove the seeds with a knife or an oyster-fork. 
Be careful not to touch them with your fingers at 
the risk of a burning. Prepare a stuffing by the 
same recipe as that for the peach mangoes ; fill the 
peppers with this, sew up the slit, lay them in a 
deep stone jar and pour boiling vinegar on them. 
This must be drained off, reheated and poured over 
the peppers again three times, with an interval of 
two days between each scalding. Four months will 
be required to ripen these for the table. 

SLICED CUCUMBER PICKLE 

Slice twelve large green cucumbers and boil them 
in vinegar for an hour. Put aside in the vinegar 
and prepare a further pickle as follows: allow a 
half-tablespoonful each of sliced garlic, grated 
horseradish, turmeric, ground black pepper, ginger, 
cinnamon and celery seed, a teaspoonful each of 
ground cloves, allspice and mace, a half-teaspoon- 
ful of red pepper and a half-pound of sugar to each 
half-gallon of vinegar; put in the cucumbers and 



64 " LIKE MOTHER USED TO MAKE " 

simmer for two hours. Take from the fire and put 
into jars. 

GREEN TOMATO PICKLE 

Slice without peeling four quarts of green to- 
matoes; peel and slice a quart of onions and put 
with these two cupfuls of sugar, a quart of vinegar, 
a tablespoonful each of salt, ground mustard and 
black pepper, and half a tablespoonful each of all- 
spice and cloves. Put over the fire and stew until 
the vegetables are tender, watching carefully that 
the mixture does not scorch. This will be fit for 
eating in about two months. 

PICKLED PEACHES 

Peel and weigh your fruit, and to every five 
pounds of it allow two and a half pounds of sugar, 
a pint of vinegar, and spices, — cloves, cinnamon 
and mace, — to taste. Let the peaches lie in the 
sugar for an hour and then drain off the syrup 
which has flowed from them and put it over the fire 
with a half-pint of water. As it boils, the scum 
will rise and must be taken off. When the scum 
does not rise any longer, put in the fruit. Boil for 
about five minutes, remove the peaches with a skim- 
mer and spread on dishes. Put the spices and 



LIKE MOTHER USED TO MAKE " 65 



vinegar with the syrup and let it boil fifteen min- 
utes. Arrange your fruit in glass jars and pour 
the syrup over it. Pickled pears may be put up by 
the same recipe. 

FRUIT JELLIES 

Cook your fruit, berries, apples, quinces, grapes 
or damsons, until the fruit is broken to pieces. Put 
the fruit through a vegetable press and let the juice 
that runs from it strain through a flannel bag; 
measure the strained juice and to every pint of it 
allow a pound of sugar. Return the juice to the 
fire in your preserving-kettle and put the sugar in 
the oven in shallow pans. Let the juice boil twenty 
minutes, removing any scum which may rise to the 
top ; turn in the sugar and bring the jelly to a boil ; 
cook just one minute and take from the fire. Have 
the jelly-glasses ready in hot water, fill to the very 
brim with the jelly (this shrinks in cooling) and set 
aside. When cool pour melted paraffin on the top 
and put on the covers. 

FRUIT JAMS AND MARMALADES 

Weigh your fruit, hulling or picking over berries, 
peeling and slicing larger fruits, before the weigh- 
ing is done. To each pound of the fruit allow 



66 " LIKE MOTHER USED TO MAKE " 

three-quarters of a pound of sugar, — except with 
green gooseberry jam, when pound for pound is 
demanded. Put the fruit over the fire and let it 
cook until tender, heating it slowly at first, and stir- 
ring it from the bottom often. Let it boil three- 
quarters of an hour. Dip out any superfluous 
juice and either can it for pudding sauce or make 
it into jelly. Put in the sugar and boil for five 
minutes. Take off any scum which rises to the 
surface. Put into small jars, or glasses, and seal. 

BRANDIED PEACHES 

Make a syrup of seven pounds of granulated 
sugar and a little water, — enough to dissolve the 
sugar. Put it over the fire in a preserving-kettle 
and let it come to a boil. Have ready seven pounds 
of firm white peaches, peeled but not stoned, lay 
the fruit in the syrup and boil five minutes. Take 
it out carefully, put it into jars, boil the syrup fif- 
teen minutes longer or until it thickens, add three 
half pints good brandy, pour the mixture at once 
over the fruit in the jars and seal these. 

BRANDIED PEARS 

These may be put up in the same way and so may 



" LIKE MOTHER USED TO MAKE " 67 

plums. Peel the pears but only prick the plums, to 
prevent their bursting. 

PRESERVED PEARS AND PEACHES 

Peel the pears without removing the stems; peel 
and stone the peaches. Weigh them and allow a 
pound of granulated sugar to every pound of the 
fruit. Cover the bottom of a preserving-kettle 
with a layer of the sugar, put fruit on this, an- 
other layer of sugar, and proceed thus until all are 
used. Let the kettle heat slowly at the side of the 
stove and stew the fruit in the sugar until they are 
clear and tender. This should not require much 
over half an hour. The fruit must then be re- 
moved from the syrup with a perforated skimmer 
and spread out on large platters while the syrup is 
again brought to the boil and cooked fast for about 
a quarter-hour. Skim frequently and when clear 
and thick arrange the fruit in wide-mouthed jars 
and pour the syrup upon them.

Old-Time Thanksgiving Fare 

Despite the Southern training which made our 
home cookery smack preeminently of the Old Do- 
minion, there were other strains which helped to 
give variety to the table. A New England connec- 
tion familiarized us with delicacies of Puritan and 
Pilgrim ancestry; a relation with the New Amster- 
dam Dutch had introduced us to the good things 
whose forebears had come from Holland. So 
when we came to plan for a Thanksgiving dinner 
we were not restricted to the dainties of any one 
section of the country. The Thanksgiving bill of 
fare is always much the same, and we would not 
have it otherwise. In my young days the mince 
pie was considered a Christmas dainty and was 
served for that season. Pumpkin pie made its 
bow, so to speak, at the Thanksgiving dinner, and 
then, too, we usually had the first turkey of the 
year. 

The only variety in the turkey was his stuffing, 
68 



" LIKE MOTHER USED TO MAKE " 69 

and while this was usually the good old dry and 
buttery bread dressing, we varied it sometimes by 
the addition of sausage or of oysters. The latter 
was an especial favorite. Cranberry jelly or sauce 
we always had, and the stock vegetables, turnips, 
celery, sweet potatoes and a corn pudding. Then 
there was a delicious Thanksgiving cake, but this 
was generally saved until supper-time and served 
after a salad which stimulated our overworked ap- 
petites. 

OYSTER STUFFING FOR TURKEY 

Make a stuffing for turkey of a large cupful of 
crumbs, seasoning with parsley, sweet marjoram 
and thyme, and moisten with melted butter. Chop 
twenty small oysters fine and mix with the dress- 
ing. If you prefer you may leave the oysters 
whole. With this stuffing fill the breast of the 
turkey. 

FRIED OYSTERS TO GARNISH TURKEY 

For this you must select fine large oysters, take 
them from the liquor carefully and dry on a soft 
cloth. Dip each oyster in powdered crackers, roll- 
ing it over and over until well coated. Fry them in 
enough,hot butter to cover them when you put them 



70 " LIKE MOTHER USED TO MAKE " 

in the frying-pan. Take out the moment they are 
done and lay around the edge of the hot dish in 
which the turkey is established. 

CRANBERRY SAUCE 

Put one quart of cranberries over the fire with 
half a pint of cold water and let them cook until 
broken to pieces. Add a pound of sugar and cook 
until this melts, — no longer, as lengthy cooking 
tends to make the sauce bitter. Take from the fire 
and set aside to cool. 

CORN PUDDING 

Chop two cupfuls of canned corn and beat into 
it two eggs, whipped light, half a pint of milk in 
which has been dissolved a pinch of baking-soda, 
a tablespoonful of melted butter, a tablespoonful of 
sugar, a half-pint of milk and salt to taste. Turn 
into a greased pudding-dish and bake covered fif- 
teen minutes; then uncover and bake ten minutes 
longer. Serve as a vegetable. 

FILLING FOR PUMPKIN PIE 

Press through a colander a quart of stewed pump- 
kin and add to it two quarts of milk. Have this 
rich and, if you can make it part cream, it will im- 



" LIKE MOTHER USED TO MAKE " 71 

prove the pie. Stir in a cupful and a half of granu- 
lated sugar, a teaspoonful each of cinnamon, nut- 
meg and mace, the yolks of nine eggs, well beaten, 
and finally the whites of the eggs whipped to a 
standing froth. Beat all well and turn into pie 
dishes lined with good paste. 

PASTRY FOR PUMPKIN PIE 

Have your pastry-board, mixing-bowl, chopping- 
knife and other utensils very cold, as well as the 
ingredients. Chop three-quarters of a pound of 
butter into a pound of flour ; when well mingled, — 
the butter in bits no larger than a pea, — stir into 
the mixture a small cupful of iced-water. Mix 
together lightly with your chopping knife and just 
as soon as blended turn out on your floured pastry- 
board. Roll out lightly, fold in three, roll out 
again, fold in three and roll out once more. Han- 
dle the pastry as little as possible. After the third 
rolling put the pastry on ice. If you can, it is bet- 
ter to make it the day before it is to be used and 
leave it in the cold until needed. When you roll it 
out for the pies, cut it into rounds with a very sharp 
knife, and when you spread it on the pie-plate do 
not pinch the edges or press them. Press the pas- 



72 " LIKE MOTHER USED TO MAKE " 

try down around the sides and the bottom of the 
pie plate but leave the edge untouched. 

THANKSGIVING CAKE 

Cream three cupfuls of powdered sugar with one 
cupful of butter; add one cupful of milk. Sift two 
teaspoonfuls of baking-powder with four cupfuls 
of flour and beat stiff the whites of ten eggs. Add 
the flour and the whites of the eggs alternately to 
the other ingredients. Flavor to taste with rose- 
water. Have ready two cupfuls of citron shredded 
fine and well dredged in flour, and stir this in last. 
Bake in a loaf or in small cakes. 

TURKEY SCALLOP 

Remove and chop the meat from the bones of 
the turkey, rejecting all gristle, though some of the 
better pieces of skin may be retained, if tender. 
Butter a pudding-dish and put in the bottom of it 
a layer of crumbs, moistening them a little with 
milk. On the layer of crumbs put one of the 
chopped meat, mingled with fragments of the 
dressing. Sprinkle with salt and pepper and dot 
with bits of butter. Next comes another layer of 
the milk-moistened bread-crumbs, and so on until 
the dish is full. Keep back the last layer until you 



" LIKE MOTHER USED TO MAKE " 73 

have poured into the scallop the gravy from the 
turkey. If there "has not been enough left to save 
the scallop from dryness, dilute what you have with 
hot water, adding butter, or make more stock from 
the turkey bones. 

The scallop is further enriched by a crust made 
of bread-crumbs soaked in warm milk, seasoned 
with salt and with two eggs beaten into it. This 
crust is to be spread smoothly over the top of the 
scallop, stuck thickly with bits of butter and cov- 
ered by a deep plate after the scallop goes in until 
the bubbles begin to boil up at the side of the dish. 
The dish is then to be uncovered and the crust 
browned.

Christmas Cheer 

Christmas was the great festival of my youth. 
The preparations for it began weeks in advance 
with the making of mince-meat and " Christmas 
cake " and continued from then until the great day. 
There was enough Dutch blood in the family, as 
I have already said, to insure our having crullers 
as one of the items of the Christmas dinner or sup- 
per ; but there was much besides — a turkey, of 
course, and a dish of scalloped oysters and sweet 
potatoes baked with sugar and butter, and celery 
and cranberry jelly and plum pudding, as well as 
the mince pies. The great feature of the occasion 
was the little roast pig. 

As the cooks themselves did, I shall begin with 
the dishes that had to be made before the great day, 
and give the direction for them as they have been 
handed down to me by my mother, who in her turn 
received them from her mother, and she from hers. 

74 



" LIKE MOTHER USED TO MAKE " 75 

MINCE-MEAT 

Chop fine two pounds of cold boiled lean beef, 
and mince to a powder a pound of beef kidney suet, 
sprinkling it with flour if it seems disposed to stick. 
Seed and cut in half two pounds of raisins, and 
wash and pick over carefully a pound of sultana 
raisins and two pounds of cleansed currants. Be 
sure that they are free from grit and dirt before 
you let them out of your hands. Peel and chop 
five pounds of apples, and shred three-quarters of 
a pound of citron. Mix these all together, with 
two tablespoonfuls each of mace and cinnamon, a 
tablespoonful each of allspice and cloves, a tea- 
spoonful of grated nutmeg, two and a half pounds 
of brown sugar and a tablespoonful of salt. Put 
with them a quart of sherry and a pint of brandy 
and pack in a stone crock. If you do not use either 
of these liquors put cider in its place. The mince- 
meat should mellow for a week at least, or better, 
for two or three, before it is used. When it is 
made up it would not be the pie of my childhood 
or family tradition if it were not baked in an open 
crust with strips of paste, the edges zigzagged by a 
" jigging iron," laid lattice pattern across the top. 
In my younger days I thought all mince pies were 



76 " LIKE MOTHER USED TO MAKE " 

born so, as it were, and although I have since then 
eaten good mince pies with solid upper crusts they 
never taste quite as they should. They lack the 
crisscross top. 

SUGARED SWEET POTATOES 

Boil and peel sweet potatoes and cut them into 
slices. Lay these in a buttered bake dish, sprin- 
kling each layer with light brown sugar and bits of 
butter, allowing a tablespoonful of butter to each 
layer and at least the same quantity of sugar. 
When the dish is full make the top layer of butter 
and sugar, pour in about half a cupful of water, — 
just enough to keep the potatoes from sticking, 
cover closely and bake in a steady oven for half 
an hour. Uncover and brown lightly. 

ROAST TURKEY WITH CHESTNUT 
STUFFING 

Wash the turkey out with cold water to which 
you have added a little soda. Neglect of this pre- 
caution often gives a strong taste to the stuffing. 
Make a chestnut dressing by boiling one quart of 
the large Italian or French chestnuts, shelling and 
peeling them and mashing them smooth. Rub into 
them a couple of tablespoonfuls of butter, season 



" LIKE MOTHER USED TO MAKE " -j-j 

to taste with salt and pepper and stuff the turkey 
with this as you would with any other dressing. 
When it is in the bird, sew up the body and tie the 
skin covering the craw opening securely, so that the 
dressing will not ooze out. It is well to cover the 
breast of the fowl with slices of fat salt pork. Put 
into the pan, turn over it a cover or a pan, pour 
over it and around it a cup of boiling water, and 
roast fifteen minutes to the pound: baste several 
times with the gravy in the pan. For the gravy 
take out the turkey and keep it hot, while to the 
liquid left in the pan you add a tablespoonful of 
browned flour wet up in a little cold water, salt and 
pepper to taste, and the giblets, which you should 
have boiled separately. Stir all well together and 
if not of a good color add a little caramel or 
kitchen bouquet. Boil up for a minute and put into 
a gravy dish. 

CHESTNUTS STEWED IN GRAVY 

Boil the large chestnuts for ten minutes, take 
them out, shell and peel them, having care to break 
them as little as possible. Skim and strain the 
liquor in which the giblets were boiled, season it 
to taste with salt and pepper, and to a pint of it 



78 "LIKE MOTHER USED TO MAKE" 

add a tablespoonful of browned flour rubbed 
smooth with a teaspoonful of butter. In this gravy 
place the peeled chestnuts and let them simmer ten 
or fifteen minutes at the side of the stove. Serve 
as a vegetable. 

SCALLOPED OYSTERS 

Drain the oysters, arrange them in the bottom 
of a buttered pudding dish and strew over them 
fine bread-crumbs. Sprinkle with pepper and salt 
and dot with bits of butter. Wet with a little 
oyster liquor. On this put another layer of oys- 
ters, similarly seasoned, then more crumbs, more 
seasoning, and so proceed in alternate layers until 
the dish is full. The last layer should be of crumbs, 
and the amount of butter on this must be twice as 
much as on the previous layers. Bake, covered, 
for half an hour. 

EGG-NOGG 

One of the features of the old time Christmas 
festivity was a big bowl of egg-nogg which was on 
tap, so to speak, all during Christmas. This did 
not mean on Christmas Day alone but all during the 
week between Christmas and New Year's, when 
merry-makings were constant and a round of visits 



LIKE MOTHER USED TO MAKE" 79 



and calls was in order. The egg-nogg was brewed 
early in the action and the supply was renewed as it 
was exhausted. The old time proportions were as 
follows: One quart of rich milk, six eggs, half a 
cup of sugar, half a pint of the best brandy. The 
whites and yolks were beaten separately, the whites 
to a standing froth. The yolks and sugar were 
put together after the former had been whipped 
smooth and thick, the milk was added, the brandy 
stirred in and last the yolks were whipped in lightly. 
A little nutmeg was grated over the top of the egg- 
nogg after it was all mixed. 

CHRISTMAS CAKE 

This was always served with the egg-nogg and 
the richness of the combination was enough to have 
driven those who partook of it into dyspepsia. The 
fact that the cake was eaten in small quantities may 
have helped save them. 

Cream together a half pound of butter and half 
a pound of sugar. Whip six eggs stiff, whites and 
yolks separately, and add to the butter and sugar. 
A teaspoonful each of cloves, cinnamon and grated 
nutmeg is then stirred in, a cupful of sifted flour, 
a quarter of a pound of citron, shredded and 



8o " LIKE MOTHER USED TO MAKE " 

dredged with flour, a half pound of currants, thor- 
oughly washed, picked over and dried and the same 
amount of seeded and halved raisins. Bqth raisins 
and currants are dredged with flour. Last of all a 
small glassful of brandy is added and the cake is 
baked in a loaf. The pan must be well greased 
and the cake baked slowly, covered, until it is nearly 
done. This cake will keep for months, if well 
wrapped up and in a tin box. 

CRULLERS 

Cream together half a pound of butter and three- 
quarters of a pound of powdered sugar, add to 
them six eggs, beaten light, nutmeg to taste and 
enough flour to make a dough which can be rolled 
out into a thin sheet. Cut into shapes, and fry in 
boiling lard. Have plenty of this in the pan and 
test the heat before beginning to cook. The crul- 
lers of my youth were cut with a jigging iron 
which gave them adorable crinkly edges and were 
made in shapes like gridirons as well as in rounds. 
It is not only childish association which makes me 
declare crullers prepared by the foregoing direc- 
tions the best I ever tasted.

A Few Christmas Candies 

Who could imagine a Christmas without candy? 
Who would want to imagine it? 

Yet the candies are a serious item in the holiday 
expenses. That is, if you get good ones, and you 
don't want the cheap sort. Better make them at 
home, not only for yourself but also for Christmas 
presents. I know a family of girls who possess 
more good-will than pocket-money and who always 
make up quantities of delicious candies for Christ- 
mas gifts. The sweets are put into pretty holly 
boxes, tied with bright ribbons and are received 
with enthusiasm. Here are gifts that not every 
one can buy. The shops do not hold them, and the 
prices asked for them at Woman's Exchanges dis- 
courage most would-be purchasers. 

So make your Christmas candies at home. You 
need have no lack of variety, but I would recom- 
mend your concentrating your attention upon two 
or three kinds and make them your specialty. 
Candy cookery is not the simple thing some persons 

8i 



82 " LIKE MOTHER USED TO MAKE " 

think; it requires judgment and experience as much 
as any other kind of cooking. Try your products 
on the family and intimate friends before you 
reckon on them as Christmas presents and don't 
put off making them until a day or two before 
Christmas. Have wax paper a-plenty in which to 
wrap them, and you may trust to their keeping as 
well as those made by a confectioner. 

The candies mother used to make in my long 
ago childhood were nothing like those I see now. 
They were not made in the easy modern fashion 
but were boiled and pulled. First among them 
stood 

MOLASSES CANDY 

For this a quart of good molasses is put over the 
fire with a cup of sugar and a half-cup of vinegar. 
Genuine molasses must be used, — not light syrup. 
The mixture must cook together over the fire until 
a little of it hardens when dropped into 
cold water. In my youthful days the molasses 
would sometimes stew for a couple of hours before 
it reached this point and the elders would say it 
was because the molasses was raw. In these later 
days the molasses is in a more advanced stage of 
preparation and such long cookery is not required. 



"LIKE MOTHER USED TO MAKE" 83 

When the hardening point is reached with the 
syrup a lump of butter the size of an egg is stirred 
in and a teaspoonful of baking-soda, dissolved in 
hot water. The syrup is poured into buttered plat- 
ters and as soon as it is cool enough to handle with- 
out absolutely blistering the skin it is pulled with 
buttered finger tips. The longer it is pulled the 
whiter it gets. I have seen it pulled into long rope- 
like strands of glistening whiteness and then 
braided into beautiful shining sticks, — but that was 
by the hands of those who had made an art of such 
work, and we children stood by and wondered at 
the grandmother and aunts who could accomplish 
such wonders. 

If taffy is preferred to the pulled candy, the mo- 
lasses may be poured in a shallow sheet into but- 
tered pans and as it cools be marked into squares 
with a buttered knife. Nuts or grated cocoanut 
may be added to different portions of the stewed 
molasses. 

SUGAR CANDY 

This is made by cooking together three cups of 
granulated sugar, half a cup of vinegar and water 
for an hour without stirring, or until a little of it 
dropped from a spoon crisps in cold water. A 



84 " LIKE MOTHER USED TO MAKE " 

tablespoonful of butter and a teaspoonful of soda 
dissolved in hot water are then turned in and the 
candy taken from the fire, to be pulled or made 
into taffy as preferred. 

While no other candy can seem quite the same 
to me as the sweets of my youth I have found many 
good modern bonbons of various kinds which are 
easily made at home. 

To my mind, the cooked candies are preferable 
to the so-called French candies, and I accordingly 
give more space to them. 

SEA FOAM FUDGE (CHOCOLATE) 

Put over the fire in a clean saucepan one cupful 
of light-brown sugar, a half-cupful of water and 
a third of a cupful of grated chocolate and boil with- 
out stirring until it spins a thread from the point of 
a spoon. Have beaten light the white of an egg; 
pour the boiling mixture upon it and stir until it 
begins to stiffen. Drop from a spoon on waxed 
paper in little bonbons, or pour into a greased pan 
before it begins to stiffen and mark into squares or 
diamonds with a buttered knife. 

SEA FOAM FUDGE (NUT) 

Put into a saucepan three cupfuls of light-brown 



" LIKE MOTHER USED TO MAKE " 85 

sugar, a cupful of cold water and a tablespoonful of 
vinegar. Bring this to the boil gradually and do 
not stir after it is once heated. Boil steadily and 
when a little of it dropped into cold water forms 
a hard ball take it from the fire. Whip stiff the 
whites of two eggs and when the syrup has stopped 
bubbling pour it on these and beat well. When it 
begins to stiffen, flavor with one teaspoonful of 
vanilla and add a cupful of chopped nut kernels, — ■ 
hickory, pecan or English walnuts. Drop on paper 
or turn into a greased pan and mark off in squares 
or triangles. 

" DIVINITY FUDGE " 

Boil together two cupfuls of granulated sugar, 
one cupful of maple-syrup, one cupful of water and 
a tablespoonful of vinegar until a little of it hardens 
when dropped in cold water, and then add a tea- 
spoonful of vanilla and take from the fire. While 
this mixture has been cooking, a cupful of granu- 
lated sugar should have been put over the fire in 
another saucepan, with a half cupful of cold water, 
and boiled until the mixture spins a thread from the 
tip of a spoon. The compound should at this 
stage be beaten up with the stifHy-whipped whites 



86 " LIKE MOTHER USED TO MAKE " 

of two eggs, and this stirred into the first prepara- 
tion, which should by now have cooled slightly. 
Beat the two hard until they begin to stiffen, when 
turn in two cupfuls of chopped nut kernels. Drop 
on paper or pour into pans and cut in shapes de- 
sired. 

PEANUT BRITTLE 

Boil together a cupful of brown sugar, one of 
molasses, two tablespoonfuls of butter and a table- 
spoonful of vinegar. When a little of the syrup 
is brittle if dropped in cold water, add a cupful of 
peanuts from which the inner skins have been re- 
moved. Take from the fire, stir in a teaspoonful 
of baking soda dissolved in a little cold water, beat 
well and turn into greased pans. 

POPCORN BALLS 

Make some old-fashioned molasses candy and 
just before taking from the fire stir in enough pop- 
corn to thicken it. After stirring the mixture for 
a minute set the kettle at the side of the stove, take 
the mixture from it by the large spoonful and lay 
each on greased paper or a greased tin. As it 
hardens roll each spoonful into a ball, greasing the 
hands well first and roll each ball over and over in 



" LIKE MOTHER USED TO MAKE " 87 

freshly-popped corn until this ceases to adhere to 
the surface. Wrap in waxed paper. 

FONDANT FOR CANDIES 

Put a pound of granulated sugar into a saucepan 
with a cupful of cold water and boil without stir- 
ring until the mixture spins a thread from the tine 
of a fork dipped into it. Cook a little while after 
this until you can make a soft ball with the fingers 
of a little of the syrup dropped into cold water. 
Turn then into a greased bowl and beat hard until 
it is smooth and white and can be kneaded like 
dough in the hands. This can be put away and 
kept until needed. Formed into balls, nuts may be 
put on either side of it; dates or raisins may be 
stuffed with a bit of it, citron or figs may be mixed 
with it. It may also be used as the centers of ordi- 
nary chocolate creams. 

CHOCOLATE CREAMS 

Melt chocolate, either sweetened or unsweetened, 
as you prefer, in a double boiler, until it is thick 
and smooth. Make your fondant into balls of the 
size you wish, and stick a skewer into each in suc- 
cession and immerse the ball in the melted choco- 
late. Dip each in several times until the coating 



88 " LIKE MOTHER USED TO MAKE " 

is as thick as you wish and then lay to dry on waxed 
paper or a greased pan. 

NUT CREAMS 

Stir confectioners' sugar into the sHghtly-beaten 
white of an egg until you have a mixture you can 
handle. Add a little cold water or S little cream, 
working it with the fingers until the mixture is 
putty-like in consistency. Flavor to taste with va- 
nilla, rose, almond, lemon — what you will — add- 
ing more sugar if the flavoring softens the mixture 
too much. Form into balls with the fingers and 
press half a walnut kernel on each side of the ball. 
You can color this pink with a few drops of cochi- 
neal. There are French vegetable colorings with 
which you can tint your fondant or cream any hue 
you desire. 

MARSHMALLOWS 

To four ounces of pulverized gum arable allow 
a teacupful of cold water and let them stand to- 
gether for two hours. Put into a double boiler, 
bring the cold water in the outer kettle to the boil- 
ing point slowly and when the gum arable is dis- 
solved, strain it through coarse muslin. Put it 
back into the double boiler with a full cupful of 



" LIKE MOTHER USED TO MAKE " 89 

powdered sugar and cook until the mixture is stiff 
and white, stirring all the while; take from the 
stove, beat hard for a minute before adding vanilla 
to taste and then beat hard again, until the flavor- 
ing is well blended. Have square tins ready, the 
insides rubbed thickly with cornstarch and turn the 
mixture into these. When it is cool cut it into 
squares with a knife. Make a mixture of corn- 
starch and powdered sugar, in the proportion of 
three parts of the cornstarch to one of the sugar, 
and roll the squares of marshmallow in these. If 
they are not to be eaten at once put them into a tin 
box or they will dry out and become tough. 

CHOCOLATE MARSHMALLOWS 

Proceed as in making marshmallows for the first 
preparation. After straining the gum arable and 
returning it to the double boiler put with the sugar 
added to it then two tablespoonfuls of grated choc- 
olate. Let this cook for over half an hour and 
then go on as with plain marshmallows.

Easter Dainties 

If one would introduce novelties into the Easter 
entertainments or functions they must lie in the 
deliciousness of the cookery, in new designs in fa- 
vors, and in unusual forms of decoration. New 
Easter dishes are hard to find. In old or new, the 
egg plays a prominent part, and, fortunately, it 
can be employed in making all kinds of toothsome 
dainties, recipes for some of which are found be- 
low. 

An Easter function at which one may have many 
pretty addenda is a luncheon and for this what can 
be prettier and more seasonable than light green 
and pale gray, or silvery white ? A table with these 
decorations has the centerpiece outlined by a circle 
of maidenhair ferns. In the middle of the center- 
piece stands a slender vase of pussy willow. A 
half dozen sprigs of these are tied with streamers 
of wide, pale-green satin ribbon, and at each corner 

of the table is laid one of these bunches, — one end 

90 



" LIKE MOTHER USED TO MAKE " 91 

of the ribbon hanging over the corner of the table 
almost to the floor, and the other end hiding under 
the centerpiece. Here and there on the table may 
be dainty bits of Easter china, for bonbons^ salted 
almonds, etc., while at each place may stand a 
souvenir in the shape of a bonbonni^re in some 
Easter design. All sorts of designs are found for 
these favors. One looks like a china bell, but when 
the bell is lifted it discloses a small rabbit rampant. 
Another is an egg-shaped receptacle, the handle 
consisting of a china ribbon holding down the 
pretty heads of three babies bursting from the shell. 
Others show Japanese maidens, each wrestling with 
a bird that has just emerged from an egg. 

The bonbons may be in an egg wheelbarrow pro- 
pelled by a gnome; olives in two broken eggshells, 
held by a small Dutch girl sitting between them. 
Perhaps the daintiest of all these novelties are 
salted-nut holders, one of which is a Dutch child 
carrying on each arm an egg-shaped pail, and the 
other a rabbit bearing a yoke from which hang two 
egg-shaped holders. One of these may contain 
salted almonds, the other salted peanuts. 

The prettiest dessert for such an affair would be 
ice-cream eggs in spun sugar. Any good confec- 



92 "LIKE MOTHER USED TO MAKE" 

tioner prepares these. Where this dessert is out 
of the question substitute blancmange eggs, in a 
nest of wine jelly and candied orange straws. 

Even the Easter breakfast may be a reminder of 
the glad feast day, and the Easter Sunday night 
supper characterized by some egg dainty. As at 
this season the egg is ruler of the feast, the house- 
wife should remember that there are dozens of ways 
of preparing it, — ^some time-tried, others rather 
unusual. 

STUFFED EGGS 

Boil six eggs for twenty minutes, then throw 
into cold water to loosen the shells. Peel care- 
fully; cut a bit from each end of the egg so that it 
will stand upright, then cut the egg in half. Mash 
the yolks smooth with a little melted butter, finely 
shredded anchovies, and pepper to taste. Form 
this mixture into balls, and fit into the halved 
whites. Stand these on end in a fireproof dish and 
set in the oven until very hot. Pour a well- 
seasoned brown sauce about the ^gs and serve. 
This is a very appetizing way of preparing eggs. 

EGGS POACHED IN CREAM 

Cut rounds of bread, toast and butter them. 



" LIKE MOTHER USED TO MAKE " 93 

Dip quickly in cream and arrange on a platter. In 
salted boiling cream poach eggs, one at a time, and 
lay carefully upon the rounds of toast. Set in the 
oven for a minute, pour the heated cream that is 
left over all, and sprinkle with salt and white 
pepper. 

RICE AND EGGS 

Boil rice, and mix with it a little butter. Put 
in a pudding dish, sprinkle thickly with grated 
cheese, and break on top of this as many eggs as 
will lie side by side. Sprinkle with grated cheese 
and dot with bits of butter. Bake in the oven until 
the eggs are set, then serve. 

EGGS WITH TOMATO SAUCE 

Boil eggs hard, throw into cold water and re- 
move the shells. Cut in half, lengthwise, sprinkle 
with salt and pepper, lay on a heated dish, and 
cover with a well-seasoned tomato sauce. 

CREAMED EGGS IN NAPPIES 

Cook together a tablespoonful of butter and half 
as much flour, and when they bubble pour upon 
them a cup of rich milk, or half milk and half 
cream. Stir to a smooth white sauce, season to 



94 "LIKE MOTHER USED TO MAKE" 

taste and pour into heated nappies. Have the 
sauce reach a third of the way up the inside of the 
nappies. Drop an egg in each, put a bit of butter 
on top, and set in the oven until the white is set. 
Send at once to the table. 

CHEESE AND EGGS 

Make a pint of white sauce as directed in the 
above recipe, and when smooth and thick, stir in 
six heaping tablespoonfuls of grated cheese. Pour 
into a deep china-plate, and break on top of this 
cheese seven eggs. Set in the oven for five min- 
utes, and take out. Garnish with sprigs of water 
cress and serve at once. 

EGGS IN TOAST NESTS 

Cut six thick slices of bread, remove the crusts 
and press a biscuit cutter half through each slice. 
Take out the round of crumbs, and toast the hol- 
lowed slice to a golden brown, then butter. Beat 
the whites of six eggs very stifif, and fill the 
" nests " in the toast with this, heaping it high. 
With a spoon make a hollow place in the middle of 
each heap of froth and drop the yolk of an egg in 
this. Put on each yolk a little butter, pepper, and 
salt, and set in the oven until the white is a delicate 
brown, then serve on a parsley-garnished dish, 



" LIKE MOTHER USED TO MAKE " 95 

EGG AND CREAM CHEESE SALAD 

Boil eggs hard and cut into quarters. With but- 
ter paddles make Philadelphia cream cheese into 
small balls. Line a salad bowl with crisp lettuce 
leaves, lay the cheese balls and eggs in this, and pour 
a French dressing over all. Some people think that 
this salad is improved by having finely-cut celery 
sprinkled over eggs and cheese. 

TUTTI-FRUTTI OMELET 

Beat six eggs, whites and yolks separate, then 
mix lightly together and pour into an omelet pan. 
Have ready-mixed blanched and chopped almonds 
of English walnuts, minced citron, candied orange- 
peel, a few crystalized or Maraschino cherries, a 
very little minced crystalized ginger, and three or 
four seeded and chopped raisins. When the omelet 
is set and ready to fold spread with the mixed 
fruits, sprinkle with powdered sugar, fold over, 
sprinkle with more powdered sugar, and transfer 
to a hot platter. Pour over it, or around it, a hot 
wine or Maraschino sauce, and eat immediately. 

AN EASTER NEST 
Make a blancmange with a quart of milk, an 
ounce of gelatine, and a scant cup of sugar. Di- 



96 " LIKE MOTHER USED TO MAKE " 

vide into three portions, color one brown by the 
addition of two tablespoonfuls of melted chocolate, 
the second pink with a little cochineal and leave 
the other white. For several days in advance egg- 
shells should have been saved, after the contents to 
be used in cooking have been emptied through a 
small hole in the end of the ^g. Rinse these out 
with cold water and fill with the blancmange. 
Make a good wine jelly, fill a dish two-thirds full 
of it, lay in the blancmange eggs, when they are 
firm, breaking the shells from them carefully, pour 
the rest of the jelly over them, garnish with pre- 
served orange peel, laying it pretty thickly over the 
top and when ready for the dish, which should be 
kept in a cold place until then, turn it out on a flat 
salver or platter.

Uncommon Ways to Cook Common 
Vegetables 

When summer ends the difficulties of the house- 
keeper in catering for her household begin ; that is, 
of the housekeeper who lives in the country, or who, 
living in the city, has little money to spend on her 
table. The woman with a full purse can buy 
forced vegetables all the year round, the woman 
who lacks either the money or the opportunity to 
purchase these must study to devise variety in the 
ways of preparing what she has. 

The supply of winter vegetables is necessarily 
limited, unless one turns to canned articles. This 
seems almost an extravagance when the cellar is 
stocked with carrots, parsnips, turnips, potatoes, 
beets, onions, and cabbages, with perhaps a small 
lot of celery, salsify, cauliflower and the like. 
There are dried vegetables, too, peas, lima beans, 
and possibly corn, that has been salted down or 
otherwise preserved. How is one to cook these 

97 



98 " LIKE MOTHER USED TO MAKE " 

so that the eaters shall not weary of the sequence ? 
The following recipes are designed especially to 
meet this want. They are neither elaborate nor 
expensive and deal with what the most moderate 
housekeeper is likely to have in the house or to be 
able to secure in the country or the small town. 
Even the dweller in cities may try some of the 
dishes with a surety of being Satisfied with the re- 
sults. 

STEWED CARROTS 

Wash the carrots, scrape off the skin, and cut 
into bits. 'Lay in cold water for an hour, then 
place, still wet, in a double boiler, and stew gently 
until thoroughly tender. Season with salt and pep- 
per, and turn into a deep dish. Cover with a white 
sauce. 

MASHED CARROTS AND TURNIPS 

Prepare the carrots as in the preceding recipe, 
cover with salted water and boil until tender. 
Dfain and mash very soft with a little butter. Cook 
turnips and mash them. Beat the two vegetables 
together to a soft mass, heap in the center of a 
dish, set in the oven until smoking-hot, and serve. 



" LIKE MOTHER USED TO MAKE " 99 

FRIED TURNIPS 

Peel and slice the turnips, and throw into cold 
water. At the end of half an hour drain and put 
over the fire in the saucepan with a little salted 
water. Cook until they begin to get tender, or un- 
til a fork pierces them easily. Be careful not to 
break them; drain and, when cold, pat them dry 
between the folds of a towel. Dip first in cracker- 
crumbs, then in beaten egg, then in cracker- 
crumbs. Lay on a dish in the ice-box for the crust 
to harden. Fry in butter to a light brown. Serve 
very hot. 

SCALLOPED CELERY 

The coarse outer stalks of celery may be used for 
this dish. Cut into inch lengths, and cover with 
salted water. Stew until tender. Drain, and keep 
hot while you make a white sauce by cooking to- 
gether a tablespoonful each of butter and flour, and 
when these bubble, pouring upon them a cup of 
milk. Stir to a smooth white sauce, put the celery 
into this, and turn into a buttered pudding dish. 
Dust the top with buttered crumbs, and set in the 
oven until lightly browned. This is a simple and 
very palatable dish.

SALSIFY FRITTERS 

Scrape the salsify and grate fine. Make a bat- 
ter of a cup of milk, two beaten eggs, and two 
tablespoonfuls of flour. Beat hard, then whip in 
the salsify. Season with salt and pepper, and drop 
by the spoonful into deep, boiling fat. Fry to a 
golden-brown. 

RICED POTATOES 

Boil white potatoes until tender, then mash, 
adding a little butter as you do so. When very 
smooth rub through a colander or strainer upon a 
heated dish, mounding them high upon this. Set 
in the oven until the apex of the mound begins to 
brown lightly, then serve. 

STUFFED POTATO BOATS 

Bake potatoes and cut them with a sharp knife 
in halves, lengthwise. Scoop out the insides, and 
mash with a little cream, melted butter and salt 
and white pepper to taste. Pack this mixture back 
into the halved cases, laying them in rows on a 
platter. On the top of each potato " boat " thus 
made put a great spoonful of meringue made by 
beating the whites of two eggs very light. Set at 



LIKE MOTHER USED TO MAKE " loi 



once in the oven and leave there just long enough 
for the meringue to color at the edges. 

BEETS STUFFED WITH LIMA BEANS 

Choose the small dried beans and soak all night ; 
in the morning boil until tender in salted water and 
drain. Boil large red beets of uniform sizes, and, 
wrhile hot, hold firmly with a cloth and rub ofif the 
skins. Set aside until cold, then scoop out the in- 
sides. Leave the beans and beets on the ice for sev- 
eral hours before using. Mix the beans with a 
French dressing, fill the hollowed beets with them, 
and set each beet on a leaf of lettuce, pouring the 
French dressing over all. Serve very cold. 

LENTILS 

Soak the lentils in water overnight. Drain, and 
cover with salted boiling water. Boil for an hour, 
drain, and cover with more boiling water and cook 
until quite soft, but not broken. Drain very dry, 
melt a heaping tablespoonful of butter in a frying 
pan, and, when slightly browned, put in an onion 
cut into tiny bits. Stir for several minutes, then 
turn in the lentils. Add a tablespoonful of 
browned flour, and a teaspoonful of. vinegar. 
Cook, stirring to a smooth mass, and serve.

STUFFED CABBAGE 

Wash a cabbage, and lay it in salted water for an 
hour, pulling the leaves apart, but not breaking 
them off. Then place it in salted boiling water 
and cook for ten minutes. Drain, and when cold, 
stand on end and put between the leaves a force- 
meat made by mixing a cup of chopped roast meat, 
— beef, mutton or veal, — with half as much fine 
crumbs, and moistening all with weak stock. Be- 
gin this stuffing process at the center of the cabbage, 
filling all interstices carefully. When the force- 
meat is all used, press the leaves into place and 
wrap the cabbage in a strip of cheese cloth. Put 
carefully into boiling water and boil for a little 
over an hour. Lay the cabbage on a platter, care- 
fully remove the cheese cloth and pour over the 
cabbage a good brown sauce. 

SAVORY CABBAGE LEAVES 

Choose the large firm leaves of a cabbage. In 
the center of each leaf put a spoonful of minced 
beef mixed with a little minced ham. Fold the leaf 
about this mixture and skewer with a tiny toothpick 
so that it will not come open. Lay all the leaves 
thus prepared side by side in a baking-pan and pour 



" LIKE MOTHER USED TO MAKE " 103 

a little stock about them. Cover and bake for 
twenty minutes. With a cake turner lift each leaf 
carefully from the pan to a heated platter and keep 
this hot while you add a little strained tomato to 
the liquor in the pan and thicken it with browned 
flour. Season to taste and pour over the cabbage- 
leaves on the dish.

Boil the cabbage in two waters, drain and, when 
cold, chop it. Put a layer of it, well seasoned with 
salt and pepper, in a buttered bake dish. Pour 
on this a white sauce, made by cooking together a 
tablespoonful each of butter and flour until they 
bubble, mixing with these a cupful of milk and stir- 
ring all until thick and well blended. Season with 
salt and pepper. On the white sauce, when it has 
been poured over the cabbage, sprinkle a heaping 
tablespoonful of grated cheese. Put in more cab- 
bage, and repeat the sauce and cheese until the dish 
is filled, making cheese with a few fine crumbs the 
last layer. Bake, covered, about half an hour, then 
uncover and brown. 

FRIED CAULIFLOWER 

Boil a cauliflower until just done, then drain. 



I04 " LIKE MOTHER USED TO MAKE " 

When cold cut into tufts of uniform size. Make a 
batter of a gill of milk, a beaten egg, two table- 
spoonfuls of grated cheese, and one or two table- 
spoonfuls of flour, — or enough to make the batter 
of the right consistency for frying. Dip each tuft 
of cauliflower in this batter, turning it over and 
over to coat thoroughly, then drop in deep boiling 
lard. As soon as they are light brown in color, re- 
move with a perforated spoon, and lay on brown 
paper to drain dry. Serve very hot. 

CAULIFLOWER BOILED WITH TOMATO 
SAUCE 

Soak a fine cauliflower in cold salt water for an 
hour, then plunge in salted boiling water and cook 
for a half hour or until tender. Transfer to a hot 
dish. Bring the contents of a half can of tomatoes 
to a boil, cook for a minute, strain, season with 
onion-juice, salt and pepper, and thicken with a lit- 
tle flour rubbed into a tablespoonful of butter. 
Stir until smooth. Break the cauliflower into bits 
of uniform size, put into a deep dish, and pour the 
tomato sauce over it. 

STUFFED ONIONS 

Boil until tender, but not broken, large Bermuda 



" LIKE MOTHER USED TO MAKE " 105 

onions. Drain, and when cool enough to handle, 
take out the centers with a small knife. Chop 
enough ham to make a cupful, add to it half as much 
fine crumbs, and mix all to a soft paste with a little 
cream, and one beaten egg. Season to taste, and 
put this mixture into the centers of the onions. 
Put in the top of each onion a bit of butter. Place 
the onions in a buttered pudding dish and bake 
slowly until tender all through. Three-quarters of 
an hour should be time enough. Serve with or 
without a white sauce. 

BROWNED ONIONS 

Peel onions and boil until tender. Pack in a but- 
tered pudding dish. Pour melted butter over each 
onion, then sprinkle very lightly with sugar. This 
will not affect the taste if used sparingly, and will 
assist in the browning process. Now cover each 
onion with fine cracker-dust, and sprinkle this with 
bits of butter. Set in a quick oven and cook until 
very brown. 

FRIED APPLES AND ONIONS 

These form a novel dish, but are delicious if 
eaten with strips of fried bacon. Do not peel the 
apples but slice them crosswise, having the slices 



io6 "LIKE MOTHER USED TO MAKE" 

a half-inch thick. Have the onions parboiled, and 
cold. With a sharp knife slice these rather thinner 
than the apples. Cook slices of bacon crisp in a 
pan, and remove them to a hot platter. Fry the 
onions and apples side by side in the bacon-fat, un- 
less there is not enough of this, in which case add 
a little butter. When brown, put the onions and 
apples on a hot platter and arrange strips of fried 
bacon about the edge of the platter. Serve very 
hot, and as free from grease as possible. To at- 
tain this end it is well to lay each one of the fried 
slices on tissue paper for a minute after taking it 
from the pan. 

PARSNIP BALLS 

Boil parsnips and mash them as you would po- 
tatoes. To two cups of the mashed parsnips add 
two tablespoonfuls of melted butter and one tgg. 
Form this mixture into small balls and set in the ice- 
chest. Leave for two hours, then drop in boiling 
fat and fry. These are a nice accompaniment to 
roast or broiled meat. 

SWEET POTATO PUFF 

Boil sweet potatoes, peel them, and, while hot, 
mash. Add melted butter and milk until you have 



" LIKE MOTHER USED TO MAKE " 107 

a soft mass, then whip in two well-beaten eggs, and 
enough cream to make a very soft mixture. Add 
salt and turn into a buttered pudding dish and bake 
to a golden-brown. This is delicious. 

SAVORY POTATOES 

Peel and cut into small cubes eight large pota- 
toes. Boil until tender in salted water, into which 
you have stirred two stalks of celery, cut up small, 
and half a minced onion. Drain the potatoes from 
the water, and stir them into a cup-and-a-half of 
white sauce, seasoning with salt and pepper. Turn 
into a buttered pudding-dish and bake to a light 
brown. 

SCALLOPED SWEET POTATOES AND 
BACON 

Parboil and peel sweet potatoes. Chop six slices 
of cold fried bacon small. Put the sliced potatoes 
into a bake-dish, sprinkling them, as you proceed, 
with the minced bacon. Sprinkle the top of the 
potatoes with buttered crumbs, and pour a cupful 
of soup stock over all. Bake for three-quarters of 
an hour.

Cooking of Dried and Smoked Meats 
and Fish 

Fresh meat is by no means an every-day affair in 
the country or the village during the winter. The 
butcher makes his rounds in the more closely set- 
tled districts, but his visits are few and far between 
in the farming regions when the drifts are high. 
The farmer's family must fall back upon dried and 
smoked meats and fish, and try to make these so 
savory that the lack of fresh meat may not be too 
much felt. 

Not for a moment am I advocating meats and 
fish preserved in this fashion as equal in digesti- 
bility or nourishing qualities to the fresh products. 
But when one can not get what one wants, it is the 
part of wisdom to make the best of what one has, 
and there is no sense in taking it for granted that 
variety is impossible when one must rely upon 
corned or smoked pork in some of its several forms, 
and must make salt cod or finnan haddie or herring 
take the place of fresh fish.

" LIKE MOTHER USED TO MAKE " 109 

STUFFED CORNED HAM 

Soak a corned ham for several hours, putting it 
into warm (not hot) water to soften a little. At 
the end of the two hours, remove the bone with a 
long, sharp knife, and fill the cavity thus left with 
a stuffing made of bread-crumbs moistened with 
soup stock or with hot water into which a great 
spoonful of butter has been stirred. Season with 
pepper, salt, onion- juice, and a dash of tomato cat- 
sup. When the cavity is packed tightly with this 
mixture, sew a piece of cheese cloth about the ham 
and put over the fire in cold water. Bring slowly to 
a boil and cook until done, allowing twenty minutes 
to each pound of the meat. Let the meat get cold 
in the liquor, then transfer to a platter, remove the 
cloth, and cut off the skin carefully. Sprinkle wtih 
pepper, and serve garnished with parsley. 

ROAST HAM 

Scrub a smoked ham well and soak all night, then 
boil according to the foregoing recipe, skin, but do 
not remove the bone. When thoroughly cold, rub 
well with cooking sherry and put into a covered » 
roaster. Make a paste of flour and water, and 
plaster this thickly over the skinned side of the 



no " LIKE MOTHER USED TO MAKE " 

meat. Put in the bottom of the roaster a sauce 
made of a gill of sherry, a cup of water, and a table- 
spoonful of molasses. Cover the roaster, and cook 
for half an hour, uncovering it half a dozen times 
to baste with the liquid. At the end of half an 
hour leave uncovered long enough to brown lightly. 
Serve hot or cold. 

APPLES AND BACON 

Wipe off large pippins or other firm apples and 
slice, but do not peel them. Fry in a pan a dozen 
thin slices of bacon until crisp, then transfer to a 
hot platter and keep warm in the open oven while 
you fry the sliced apples in the bacon fat until 
lightly browned. Put the apples in the center of 
the platter, and arrange the slices of bacon around 
them. 

FRIED PORK WITH CREAM SAUCE 

Soak salt pork for an hour, then cut into slices. 
Boil for three minutes in a little water, drain, and 
wipe dry. Place in a frying-pan and fry until 
done, but not dried. Transfer to a hot dish, and 
thicken the grease left in the pan with a tablespoon- 
ful of flour. Stir until you have a smooth paste, 
then pour on slowly a cup of cream to which a 



" LIKE MOTHER USED TO MAKE " iii 

pinch of baking soda has been added, and stir to a 
smooth white sauce. Season with a dash of pepper, 
and pour over the sliced pork. Serve very hot. 

SAUSAGE AND POTATO ROLL, BAKED 

Fry sausage until done, then chop fine. Boil and 
mash six potatoes, beating out all lumps ; add a cup 
of milk, a teaspoonful of melted butter, and enough 
salted flour to make a dough. Put upon a floured 
pastry board, roll into a sheet, and place the 
.sausage-meat in the center of the sheet. Roll the 
dough up with the meat in the center, as one would 
prepare a roly-poly pudding. Put in a baking-pan 
brush with melted butter, and bake. Serve as soon 
as done. 

PORK AND BEANS WITH TOMATO 
SAUCE 

Soak a pint of beans all night in water that is 
warm when poured over them. In the morning 
boil until tender. Chop half a pound of parboiled 
salt pork very fine. Make a tomato sauce by stir- 
ring into a cup of tomato liquor from canned or 
fresh tomatoes a tablespoonful of butter rolled in 
one of flour, and, when this is thick, seasoning well 



112 " LIKE MOTHER USED TO MAKE " 

with sugar and salt, and with onion- juice and pepper 
to taste. 

In the bottom of a deep baking dish put a layer 
of the minced pork, then a thick layer of the beans, 
and over these pour a little tomato sauce. Put in 
more pork, more beans and more sauce, and pro- 
ceed in this way until the dish is full. Sprinkle the 
top of the mixture with very finely minced salt 
pork. Add enough tomato- juice, poured in care- 
fully, to prevent the contents becoming dry. Bake, 
covered closely, for two and one-half hours, then 
uncover and brown. 

SALT PORK PIE 

Soak a half pound of salt pork all night. In the 
morning boil until done, putting in the cold water 
which is poured over it a sliced onion and two sliced 
turnips. Simmer until the onion is a soft pulp and 
the turnips are very tender. Take out the pork and 
cut into small dice, and strain out the onion and 
turnips. Put a layer of the pork in a deep dish, 
cover with a layer of sliced boiled potatoes, sprin- 
kle these with bits of butter, and with a little flour 
and salt and pepper to taste, then put in the sliced 
turnips. Add enough of the liquor in which the 



LIKE MOTHER USED TO MAKE" 113 



pork was boiled to fill the dish. Cover with a light 
pastry and bake to a golden-brown. 

BARBECUED HAM 

Fry slices of boiled ham until done to the desired 
crispness, then keep hot while you add to the fat in 
the pan a teaspoonful of made mustard, a teaspoon- 
ful of sugar, a wineglassful of vinegar and a dash 
of pepper. Boil up and pour over the ham. 

SCALLOP OF CORNED BEEF AND 
CABBAGE 

Chop fine enough cold corned beef to make a 
pint. Chop an equal quantity of boiled cabbage. 
Cook together a tablespoonful of butter and one of 
flour and pour upon them a cup of tomato liquor. 
Stir to a smooth sauce, and season with a half-tea- 
spoonful of onion- juice, a little kitchen bouquet, and 
a dash of pepper. Mix the cabbage and the corned 
beef together, and stir the tomato sauce thoroughly 
into them. Turn into a buttered pudding-dish, and 
sprinkle with buttered crumbs. Set in the oven, 
covered, for fifteen minutes, then uncover and 
brown. Serve very hot. 

FISH BALLS 

Soak salt codfish overnight in cold water. Drain 



114 "LIKE MOTHER USED TO MAKE" 

and put over the fire in cold water, and bring slowly 
to a boil. Cook, changing the water once for fresh 
hot water, for half an hour. Mash to a cream half 
as much potato as you have fish, with a tablespoon- 
ful of melted butter and one of cream. Mix in a 
double boiler over the fire, that the mixture may get 
very hot. Whip in gradually a well-beaten egg, 
and beat hard for several minutes. Set aside until 
cool, form into balls, and set on ice for an hour at 
least before frying to a golden-brown in deep fat. 
Drain in a heated colander. These are very good, 
and much more delicate than the traditional " cod- 
fish ball." 

CREAMED CODFISH 

Soak and boil the cod as directed in the foregoing 
recipe, and flake to small bits with a silver fork. 
Cook together a tablespoonful of butter with one 
of flour, and pour upon them a cup of milk. Sea- 
son with salt and pepper, and beat in, gradually, the 
fish. Stir over the fire until heated through, then 
serve on a platter and surround the mound of fish 
with triangles of toast. 

BROILED SALT MACKEREL 

Soak the mackerel and wash well. Put over the 



" LIKE MOTHER USED TO MAKE " 115 

fire in cold water and bring to a boil; then change 
the water for fresh, which should be boiling when 
poured on. At the end of twenty minutes drain 
the fish, and lay in a mixture of two parts salad oil 
and one part vinegar or lemon-juice. Leave for 
ten minutes, then broil over a clear fire. Serve 
with a white sauce. 

FINNAN HADDIE 
This may be cooked according to the recipe for 
broiled salt mackerel. 

SCALLOPED CODFISH AND POTATOES 

Mash enough potatoes to make a pint; soak, boil 
and flake a pint of codfish. Make a white sauce, 
and stir into a pint of this a cup of grated cheese. 
Put a layer of the fish in a pudding dish, or in small 
individual nappies, cover with a stratum of mashed 
potatoes, and pour some of the white sauce over 
this. Put in another layer of codfish, and another 
of the potatoes, then more white sauce until the 
dish is full. Strew grated cheese over the top 
layer, which should be the cream sauce, and bake 
for fifteen minutes, or until very hot.

Hot Weather Suggestions 

It is much easier to keep good-natured in cold 
weather than in hot. One may be uncomfortable 
in cold weather, but there is seldom the active irri- 
tability present that there is when the thermometer 
begins to soar. Sometimes it seems as if one's for- 
titude and powers of endurance and self-control 
had exuded with the perspiration, or as if they 
were of those chemical compounds which evaporate 
and disappear with a high degree of heat. 

This would not be so bad if the capability for vig- 
orous expression were to vanish with them; but 
whereas the cold may have the effect of numbing 
and checking the flow of eloquence, hot weather 
seems to encourage an outpouring of language. The 
woman who will attain a state of deadly quiet in a 
zero temperature will express herself only too freely 
when the nineties are reached. 

I don't wish to condemn such persons. My heart 

opens with unfeigned sympathy to those who detest 

hot weather and whose tempers show this detesta- 

ii6 



" LIKE MOTHER USED TO MAKE " 117 

tion by putting forth thorns. The cold blasts of 
winter may not tend to amiability, but, compared 
with the torrid breath of summer, they are as noth- 
ing in the way of provocation of plain, old-fash- 
ioned crossness. All the beauties of the green 
things " agrowing and ablowing " can not make up 
to some of us for the agonies of the heated term. 

Since there has yet been no practical discovery 
made by which the temperature may be lowered to 
suit the tastes of the heat-haters, the only thing that 
one who suffers from the excessive warmth can do 
is to make an attempt to keep the temper, at least, 
in cold storage. It doesn't sound like an easy feat, 
perhaps — though it sounds easier than it is. Yet 
this, or something like it, is the only means by which 
one may render life tolerable to herself and to those 
about her during the dog days. 

In the first place, don't begin to lose your temper. 
Avoid occasions of provocation. Stop arguments. 
Don't put yourself into a position where you will be 
subject to irritation. There is neither rhyme nor 
reason in pleading " Lead us not into temptation," 
and then putting a leading rope into the possession 
of a person or of a set of circumstances ! 

The housekeeper should make an especial study 



ii8 " LIKE MOTHER USED TO MAKE " 

of hot-weather tactics. She should resolve to take 
life coolly and not to do so much for her family 
that she will be worn out and make them more un- 
comfortable by her depression or crossness than she 
has made them comfortable by her good cookery. 
The much bepraised, much bejeered simple life 
should be followed as far as possible. " Fussy " 
dressing should be abjured. All living should be 
done on the most agreeable plan. 

I know this is against the principle, — and, alas ! 
against the practice, — of our Puritan ancestors and 
of too many of their descendants. But bear in mind 
that, while it may be well enough to seek troubles 
when you think life is too pleasant, you will have no 
need of going in search of annoyance during the hot 
weather. The summer insects, the summer heat and 
the summer dust will provide you with a fine assort- 
ment of trials while you wait. You need not go out 
of your way to look for them. 

This may seem like rank nonsense to the summer 
worshipers, who are never happier than when the 
mercury starts on a steady climb. How we others 
envy them! But let me say to those thrice-fortu- 
nate souls — and bodies : — Have patience with 
those who are less lucky ! You may not be able to 



"LIKE MOTHER USED TO MAKE" 119 

understand the peculiarly trying experience of wilted 
collars, stringy, curlless hair, shining and moist face, 
and perspiring body, but at least try to appreciate 
what the effect of these must be upon the sufferers. 
Make allowances for their irritability in hot weather. 
Remove from them, as far as you can, occasions of 
oflFense. Aid them to convert the hot-weather tem- 
per into something less terrifying than it is in many 
cases. Be indulgent to them and help them to keep 
cool by encouraging them to be indulgent with them- 
selves. 

If you are a housekeeper seek means for keeping 
the members of your family comfortable in the 
summer. 

Make your food simple. Try to establish for 
your table a different standard than that of heavy 
plenty. The merest tyro in dietetics knows that 
meat and fats are not essential to the system during 
the heated term. Most people understand, too, that 
less food is needed when the mercury is in the nine- 
ties than when it is hovering about the freezing 
mark. 

Don't overwork your digestion when it is so hot 
that you spare the rest of your physical mechanism 
as much hard labor as possible; and when you fill 



I20 "LIKE MOTHER USED TO MAKE" 

your stomach give it something it can take care of 
easily. The very indications of the season are so 
many finger posts teUing what food is convenient for 
us at this time of year. Now is the day and the 
hour of fruits and vegetables. Never are they so 
plentiful, so cheap, or so good as in midsummer, — 
and this is an exception to the general rule that 
makes things cheap and nasty or delicious and costly. 
So, eat vegetables. I do not advise you to turn 
vegetarian, for we are, as a rule, carnivorous enough 
to crave a bit of meat for a relish, if no more. For 
the benefit of those who think work can not be ac- 
complished except upon a meat diet, no matter what 
the season, I will repeat the statement of an expert in 
dietetics, who informed me, a good deal to my dis- 
comfiture, that one can work longer without getting 
hungry on a meal of vegetables than on one of flesh. 
The latter is rapidly digested, but a meal of vegeta- 
bles is said to stay by the eater for six hours. I 
dare say its abiding power varies with the rapidity or 
slowness of the individual eater's digestive processes, 
but the mere fact that it will linger by anyone for 
that space of time is encouraging to those who ofifer 
vegetables to their families in hot weather. There is 
relief in the thought that one can supply craving na- 



"LIKE MOTHER USED TO MAKE" 121 

ture and cut down the butcher's bills with the same 
action. 

Cook your vegetables carefully, as a matter of 
course. Don't serve them watery and overdone. 
Give a little attention to them and don't think that 
anyone can cook vegetables. Anyone can't ! There 
is as much difference between vegetables well cooked 
and poorly cooked as betWeen steak or pastry under 
similar conditions. It is worth while to add that 
well-served vegetables demand so much butter in 
their dressing that no one need be afraid of not re- 
ceiving a sufficient proportion of fat in a vegetable 
diet. 

Study simplicity in the make-up of your meals. 
Summer is not the season for long sessions at table 
and for heavy course meals once you are there. 
Have fruit a-plenty at breakfast, — berries, peaches, 
pears, plums, and, above all, melons, which are the 
best of breakfast fruits. Have a cereal and omit 
meat altogether. Dwell lightly upon it at the later 
meals. Use salads freely, and more fruit, as well 
as the vegetables. I know of one family where a 
regular dinner is abjured in summer, and in its place 
are offered a substantial lunch at noon, and a heavy 
supper at night. The plan may be worth trying.

Hot Weather Recipes 

ICED AND JELLIED CHICKEN 
BOUILLON 

Cover a large jointed fowl with cold water. Set 
at the side of the range where it will come slowly to 
a boil, and simmer steadily for four hours. At the 
end of that time, take from the fire, season with cel- 
ery salt, onion juice, and white pepper and set away 
to get very cold. Skim off all fat, and strain out 
the bones and meat, and return to the fire with a 
quarter-box of gelatine that has soaked for an hour 
in a gill of cold water. As soon as the gelatine is 
thoroughly dissolved, take the soup from the fire, 
strain through a flannel jelly bag, and set aside to get 
cool. When, cold, put in the ice chest. Serve this 
jellied bouillon in chilled cups, laying a sprig of pars- 
ley on each cup. Bouillon prepared and served in 
this way is nourishing and palatable without being 
heating. 

ICED CLAM AND CHICKEN BOUILLON 

This is a pleasant variation of the above recipe. 

122 



" LIKE MOTHER USED TO MAKE " 123 

After carefully washing the shells of a dozen hard- 
shelled clams, lay them in a stewpan, add a half gill 
of scalding water, cover closely, and set at the side 
of the range until the shells are wide open and the 
clam juice flows freely. Strain this off, boil up 
once, set aside until cold, and strain through cheese 
doth. Set in the ice until very cold. Have ready 
iced chicken bouillon made according to the forego- 
ing recipe, omitting the gelatine. Stir the clam juice 
into this, season to taste, and serve in chilled cups 
with a heaping tablespoonful of whipped cream on 
the surface of each cup. 

CREAMED AND WHIPPED CODFISH 

Flake into tiny bits enough cold boiled cod to 
make two cupfuls of the fish. For this amount al- 
low two cups of rich milk and one cup of cream. 
Heat the milk and stir the fish gradually into it. 
Bring to the scalding point, and whip in a heaping 
tablespoonful of butter rubbed into one of flour. 
Beat steadily until the fish becomes very thick, then 
put in the cream, to which has been added a pinch 
of baking soda. Stir until the boiling point is 
again reached, take from the fire and whip hard for 
a minute before pouring on rounds of heated toast 



124 "LIKE MOTHER USED TO MAKE" 

from which the crust has been pared. Lay a slice 
of hard-boiled egg on top of each mound of the 
creamed fish. This is a delicious dish. 

LOBSTER OR CHICKEN SOUFFLE 

Into two cups of finely minced boiled salmon or 
lobster, stir the whipped yolks of four eggs, a cup 
of cream, and a teaspoonful of melted butter. Add 
a dash of cayenne, salt to taste, and flavor with a 
little lemon- juice. Beat hard for five minutes. 
Have ready stiffened the whites of the eggs, fold 
these in lightly and quickly, pour all into a buttered 
pudding-dish and bake for half an hour in a steady 
oven. Serve at once. 

BROILED SARDINES 

Select large, firm sardines for this dish. Drain 
off the oil. Place the sardines on an oyster-broiler 
and cook over a clear fire just long enough to heat 
them through. Lay each sardine on a long and 
narrow strip of toast that has been spread with an- 
chovy paste. 

CHEESE, RICE AND EGGS 

Into a pint of rice, boiled so that every grain 
stands separate, beat five eggs. Cook, stirring, for 



" LIKE MOTHER USED TO MAKE " 125 

three minutes. Whip to a light mass, season to 
taste, turn into a hot dish and pour a white sauce 
made thick with grated cheese over the mixture. 

GREEN CORN OMELET 

Grate the kernels from six ears of boiled corn. 
Heat in a saucepan with a gill of milk and two ta- 
blespoon fuls of melted butter. Take from the fire 
and set aside to cool. When cold, beat into the 
corn mixture the whipped yolks of five eggs, salt 
and pepper to taste, and turn into a heated and 
greased omelet pan, folding in the stiffened whites 
just before doing this. Cook until set, then double 
over and serve. 

FRIED TOMATOES 

Wipe, but do not peel, large tomatoes. Cut into 
thick slices with a very sharp knife, sprinkle with 
salt and pepper, dip in egg and then in cracker-dust, 
and set in the ice chest for an hour before frying 
in hissing butter. 

STUFFED AND BAKED TOMATOES 

Cut a slice off the stem end of large firm toma- 
toes. Scoop out the inside, leaving a thick wall of 
the tomato. Mix the pulp with half a green pep- 



126 " LIKE MOTHER USED TO MAKE " 

per, chopped fine, a tablespoonful of rice, and salt 
and pepper to taste. Return this mixture to the 
tomatoes, and place a thick bit of cheese on the top 
of the tomato. Bake until tender. The cheese 
melting and running down into the tomato-mixture 
imparts a delicious flavor. 

ANCHOVY AND TOMATO TOAST 

Toast slices of bread, spread thickly with an- 
chovy paste or with minced anchovies. Place on a 
hot dish and pour a well-seasoned tomato sauce 
over all. 

BAKED EGGPLANT 

Boil an eggplant for fifteen minutes, drain, and 
when cold, cut into halves, lengthwise, and scoop 
out the insides. Chop the pulp and mix with it an 
equal quantity of cold minced chicken, veal, or ham, 
a handful of bread-crumbs, salt, pepper, celery salt 
and lemon-juice to taste, and a generous spoonful 
of melted butter. Mix thoroughly, return to the 
halved vegetable, and cover the top with browned 
crumbs. Put into a baking-pan, pour in seasoned 
stock deep enough to come one- fourth up the side 
of the eggplant, and bake for nearly an hour, bast- 
ing frequently. Transfer to a hot dish, add onion- 



"LIKE MOTHER USED TO MAKE" 127 

juice, salt and pepper to the sauce in the pan, thicken 
with a brown roux, and pour about the eggplant. 

BAKED CUCUMBERS 

Wipe off large cucumbers, and split them from 
end to end. Take out the pulp from the centers, 
not stopping to reject the seeds. Put the pulp into 
a chopping bowl and add half a tomato, one-half a 
green pepper and seasoning to taste. Chop all very 
fine, add a tablespoonful of buttered crumbs, and a 
little melted butter. Return this mixture to the cu- 
cumbers, place a bit of butter on the rounded top of 
each, and bake for an hour. Serve, if you wish, 
with melted butter sauce. 

EGG AND ANCHOVY SALAD 

Remove the skin from six anchovies. Peel and 
cut into halves six hard-boiled eggs. Rub the an- 
chovies to a paste with a little butter, and add the 
yolks of the eggs. Season to taste, adding butter 
or salad oil until you have a smooth, soft mass. 
Roll this mixture into balls the size of egg-yolks 
and replace these in the halved whites. Stand these 
on end, heaping the anchovy mixture on them. 
Place in a bed of crisp lettuce and serve with a 
mayonnaise dressing. 



128 "LIKE MOTHER USED TO MAKE" 

MIXED SALAD 

Mix together a quarter cup of boiled and peeled 
potatoes, cut into dice a quarter cup of turnips, pre- 
pared in the same way, the same quantity of boiled 
beets and celery, cut into small bits of uniform size, 
and a half-cup of cold boiled peas and a half-cup 
of string beans, cut into quarter-inch lengths. Stir 
well together, add six stoned and chopped olives, 
three small pickles, minced, and stir in a good 
French dressing. Line a salad bowl with lettuce 
and heap this mixture in the center. 

TOMATO AND CRESS SALAD 

Wipe lafge tomatoes and scoop out the insides. 
To three parts of this pulp add one part of chopped 
green peppers, from which all seeds and white 
membrane have been removed, and two parts of 
water cress that has been quickly broken, not 
chopped, into tiny bits. Return this mixture to 
the tomato shells, stand each tomato on a leaf of 
lettuce, and pour a great spoonful of mayonnaise 
over each. In the top of each tomato stick a sprig 
of water cress. 

ORANGE AND BANANA SALAD 

Those who are fond of the sweet fruit salad now 



"LIKE MOTHER USED TO MAKE" 129 

so popular will like the following combination : Peel 
and slice four oranges and three bananas. Place in 
a chilled bowl in alternate layers, and pour over 
them a dressing made of a wineglassful of sherry, 
two tablespoonfuls of Maraschino, three tablespoon- 
fuls of powdered sugar, and, if it is wished, a little 
lemon-juice. Decorate the dish with Maraschino 
cherries. Serve at once. 

PEACH WHIP 

Soak a half-box of gelatine in a gill of cold water, 
then cover with a cup of boiling water. Rub a 
pint of stewed peaches through a sieve, and add the 
liquor or syrup in which they were cooked. Stir 
this into the dissolved gelatine, and flavor to taste 
with lemon-juice. Set in the ice chest until thor- 
oughly cold. As it begins to stiffen beaf in the 
whipped whites of three eggs. When you have a 
thick mass, turn into a mold wet with cold water, 
and set in the ice until wanted. Serve with whipped 
cream. This_ dessert may also be made of apricots 
or any other stewed fruit. 



XVI 
System in Housekeeping 

This is the day of housekeeping made easy. The 
old-fashioned housekeeper gasps with wonder when 
she goes through a modern house-furnishing shop. 
Everything seems to have been done to simpHfy 
and adorn the work of keeping house, and a mere 
man, or a woman lacking in experience, might 
think the life of a home maker should be nothing 
but a round of gayety and pleasure. 

Yet with all this there seem to be no more hours 

in a day than there were before so many of the 

fairy tales of inventions were realized. There are 

still hordes of women who do nothing but keep 

house and never finish with that. Sometimes there 

appear to be even more of them than in the days 

before cookery by gas or electricity was heard of, 

when meat-choppers, egg-beaters, cream-churns, 

and all the other labor-savers were unknown. Still 

is there an endless succession of tasks placed before 

woman, and still she makes her plaint that while 

130 



" LIKE MOTHER USED TO MAKE " 131 



men's work may end with set of sun, a woman's 
work is never done. 

It is very easy to declare what must be the fault 
— to lay it to over-elaborateness of living, to an 
eagerness to keep up with one's neighbors and to 
get ahead of them, to raise a cry for enforcing sim- 
plicity of life and discarding draperies, bric-a-brac, 
course dinners, and afternoon tea. We all attempt 
too much, — there is no doubt of that. Our desires 
are larger than our abilities in most directions. And 
yet, my own impression is that much of the hurried 
and harassed character of the housekeeper's life is 
due to the lack of system in planning work and exe- 
cuting it. 

There is nothing new in this suggestion. But 
like a good many old truths, it will stand repetition. 
I do not intend to weaken the suggestion by declar- 
ing housekeeping to be an exact science. No 
women that have ever kept house would believe me. 
They know better. The Prayer-book phrase, 
" Changes and chances of this mortal life," might 
have been framed to apply to housekeeping. The 
only other avocation that can compare with it is 
that of the farmer, who must be dependent upon 
the elements for the success of his harvest as much 



132 " LIKE MOTHER USED TO MAKE " 

as upon the work he puts into it. He, too, may do 
his utmost and have little to show for it. 

One great objection to considering housekeeping 
as a science is that in it so much allowance has to 
be made for the human equation. Sometimes one 
has to allow for two or three of them. When a 
woman does all her own work she has to make pro- 
vision only for her own physical and mental wear 
and tear — and those of her family, — but when 
she has to employ maids the situation becomes 
complicated. 

In spite of all the checks and disasters that are 
almost bound to occur in every household sooner 
or later, I still hold firmly to the faith that system, 
more than anything else, will come nearest to solv- 
ing the difficulties. Housekeeping cannot be con- 
ducted to advantage on a hit-or-miss plan. " Let 
us not anticipate " may be an admirable motto so 
far as most of life's trials are concerned, but it 
does not serve when one comes to housekeeping. 
That is a section of existence in which intelligent 
planning and fulfillment count for much. 

The majority of American wives keep their own 
houses — ^ when they do not board. A hired house- 
keeper is an exception. The wife must have the 



" LIKE MOTHER USED TO MAKE " 133 

ends of all the threads in her hands, and must know 
where each one leads. 

There is little use in trying to lay down a stated 
outline for keeping house. Each housekeeper must 
work out her own salvation in the domestic line. 
Now and then one meets a woman who was born 
systematic, but many more have achieved system. 
It is really not so difficult a business, after all, when 
one goes about it in the right fashion. 

One of the first things for the woman struggling 
for system to do is to try to get the work of her 
house in perspective. This is not easy. It is a 
truism that women are lacking in a sense of propor- 
tion, and it is not a simple matter for one of them 
to get herself mentally far enough from her work 
to decide the relative importance of each item. But 
she must do it, if she is to develop her system of 
work in the right way. She should mentally range 
her duties in order, and divide them into what must 
be done and what may be done if circumstances 
permit. The first list will be long enough, but the 
second will exceed it. The chief trouble with 
housekeepers is that they get the items of the two 
lists mingled and confused. 

For instance: washing and ironing and baking 



134 " LIKE MOTHER USED TO MAKE " 

and sweeping and scrubbing must be done. Enter- 
taining and making fresh curtains and trying a new 
kind of cake or salad may be done. The first can- 
not be crowded out, except in extreme cases. The 
second may be postponed, if necessary, without im- 
periling the health and happiness of any member of 
the family. 

After the two sets of duties are tabulated with 
tolerable correctness, comes the planning as to how 
and when they shall be done. This is pleasanter 
work than the first, but it takes a good deal of 
thought. 

Our duties must dovetail and fit into each other. 
Certain things must be done early or they will be 
an annoyance to us all day. Of these are dusting, 
dish-washing, bed-making, and all the other neces- 
sary straightening and putting to rights of the 
house. To go at other work while these tasks are 
undone is sure to make confusion. Yet in how 
many homes do you see just this fault? The dishes 
are left standing while some piece of fancy cooking 
is undertaken, and I have even known homes where 
the beds stood unmade while the mistress of the 
house sat calmly down with a bit of sewing which 
could just as well have waited until later. I do not 



" LIKE MOTHER USED TO MAKE " 135 

deny that there is a certain agreeable sense of lux- 
ury and dissipation in doing this sort of thing — 
just as there is in settling yourself to finish a thrill- 
ing story or dip into a new magazine while there is 
work waiting for you. But we are not talking of 
what brings passing enjoyment, but of the true com- 
fort that follows the practice of system. It is fun 
to do the untimely things that are easy and pleas- 
ant, but it is most tiresome to turn about after- 
wards and dispose of the hard things. 

The system that the housekeeper tries to practice 
herself she should insist on with her servants. They 
do not always take kindly to it, and very often life 
is a good deal of a grind until they have been drilled 
into the habits of the house. The line upon line 
and precept upon precept principle must be followed 
and the maid told daily, if needful, that she must 
brush down the stairs, sweep out the halls, dust this 
room or that, clean the bath-room, wash the dishes, 
and do the bedroom work in a certain fixed se- 
quence. To keep her in this, the mistress must be 
rigorous with herself and go to the kitchen to in- 
spect supplies and to give her orders at a stated time 
each day. 

Orderliness is a part of this same system. The 



136 " LIKE MOTHER USED TO MAKE " 

rule of " a place for everything and everything in 
its place " must be enforced. The maid must keep 
her kitchen cupboards in as good order as her 
china-closets, and if she does, in a little while she 
will become so familiar with the location of each 
utensil and each piece of china or glass that she 
could find it in the dark. There should be no lib- 
erty allowed of keeping a thing in one place at one 
time and in another some other time. This may 
seem a trifle, but all these trifles do their part in 
creating an orderly and systematic habit of mind. 
Do not permit the maid to leave the dishes standing 
around after they have been washed, but teach her 
that it is as essential to put these away as soon as 
they are clean as it is for her to wash her dish 
towels and hang them out to dry once a day or to 
keep the sink spotless and odorless. 

Try to cultivate system in your maid in other 
ways. Impress it upon her that she must let you 
know as soon as the supply of any article is ex- 
hausted, and not wait till there is need for it again 
before she discloses to you the fact that it is wanted. 
To help her in this hang in your kitchen a small 
pad of paper and a pencil, and instruct her that as 
soon as she uses the last of any provision she is to 



"LIKE MOTHER USED TO MAKE'* 137 

write the name of this on the slip, that it may serve 
as a memorandum when you go to market. 

If the maid's memory is poor, encourage her to 
make notes of the items of the work she has to per- 
form. In a way, this may not develop her memory 
so well as charging her mind with the details, but 
there are many of us whose remembrances need a 
crutch now and then. One of the most competent 
and systematic housekeepers I know makes out her 
bills of fare for a week in advance, writes them 
down and pins up the list in the kitchen pantry to 
serve as a reference both for herself and for the 
maid. This does not commend itself to me espe- 
cially, in spite of my respect for the judgment of 
this systematic friend. My own experience has 
been that any plan for meals is modified greatly by 
circumstances. One cannot always know how 
much will be eaten of this or that, what will be left 
over and may be used to supplement other pro- 
visions. Still the plan is worthy of consideration. 

There is an acknowledged system in the days and 
seasons for performing certain duties. The first 
two days of the week are for laundry work, some 
sweeping is done on Wednesday, Thursday is 
usually the maid's afternoon out, and the morning 



138 " LIKE MOTHER USED TO MAKE " 

may be given to cleaning the silver and brasses. 
Friday there is more sweeping to be done, and per- 
haps washing of windows, while Saturday is given 
over to finishing off undone cleaning and making 
the house and the larder ready for Sunday. All or 
any of these regulations the housekeeper may fol- 
low or modify to suit her own convenience. The 
only inevitable thing is that she must determine 
upon some special routine of work, and having 
adopted it, stick to it, unless there is some excellent 
reason for changing. 

I am not trying to put housekeepers into a tread- 
mill or fit them in a machine from which they can- 
not escape. I hold very strongly that the woman 
should keep the house, and not the house the woman. 
Yet I think that the practice of system, and a pretty 
strict system, too, tends to make the care of the 
house far less of a burden and exaction than the 
happy-go-lucky, go-as-you-please plan — or lack of 
plan — when the only thing that seems to be sure is 
that much will be left undone until just the time 
when one least wants to do it. 

Once started in the path of system, the house- 
keeper will find that her facility in simplifying and 
classifying work grows. She will discover new 



" LIKE MOTHER USED TO MAKE " 139 

ways and means for making her work scientific and 
orderly and for saving time. The planning ahead 
is a great thing. The thrifty housekeeper does not 
wait until she actually needs something before she 
secures it, but sees that her life-boats and life-pre- 
servers are in good working order while the fine 
weather holds. 

A forehanded housekeeper learns to make pro- 
vision for emergencies. She carries into other 
lines of housekeeping the principle of the old woman 
who, when she lay dying, beckoned her daughter 
to her and, as the mourner bent above her for a 
parting message, whispered with her last breath, 
"Always keep hot water in the kettle." (I won- 
der what she would have said if she had known a 
gas-stove!) The housekeeper with foresight is not 
taken by surprise when emergencies present them- 
selves. Perhaps she is like a clever woman I have 
heard of who keeps an " emergency cupboard." 
She lives at some distance from shops and she has 
a cupboard stored with dainties that are never to be 
used except in an emergency. Sardines are here, 
and potted chicken and biscuits of various sorts, 
and a jar or two of jelly and jam and good pre- 
serves, and a small pot of cheese, and other things 



I40 " LIKE MOTHER USED TO MAKE " 

that will help to make out a meal in case of unex- 
pected guests. As soon as one of the articles has 
been used it is immediately replaced, and the closet 
is never invaded except for a real emergency. That 
is a systematic woman! 

Or the housekeeper of this type may show her 
system in another way. She may plan her work 
so as to do in odd moments the task that otherwise 
she would have to set aside for a special season. 
Such a woman takes advantage of a cool morning 
when work is light to go into her kitchen and pre- 
pare dainties that may be required at a future time. 
She conducts her housekeeping on the plan that 
was followed by Nicholas Nickleby when " he dis- 
tended his stomach with a bowl of porridge — not 
that he needed it now, but that he thought he might 
need it later when he couldn't get it.'' So the 
housekeeper makes pastry on Wednesday that she 
may not need until pie-making time on Saturday, 
and puts it away on the ice. Or she prepares may- 
onnaise for a near future. She always has fondant 
for icing on hand, and jars of white roux and 
brown roux, so that she does not have to bother 
with measuring out her butter and flour when she 
is in a hurry for a white or brown sauce. She 



" LIKE MOTHER USED TO MAKE " 141 

makes maitre d'hotel butter, too, in advance, and 
glaze, and lemon honey for filling layer cakes, and 
caramel for coloring soups and gravies, and all the 
other little adjuncts of delicate cookery. It would 
be a good deal of an undertaking to give a couple 
of days to the compounding of all these, but by her 
system she is able to fit in half an hour there and 
fifteen minutes somewhere else and thus see that 
her larder is always kept supplied with these ar- 
ticles. Yet she never misses the time she gives to 
the work. 

One woman I know puts up most of her jelly 
in this way. She does her own work, and while 
she is getting the breakfast she will slice a few ap- 
ples and put them over the fire, or start to sim- 
mering at the side of the stove a small amount of 
grapes or berries, or whatever fruit is in season. 
By the time she has eaten her breakfast and done 
her dishes the fruit is ready to be put in the jelly- 
press and she returns the juice to the fire, brings 
it to a boil, adds the sugar, and has the jelly in the 
glasses before the morning is much more than 
fairly begun. She does not make more than two 
or three or four glasses at a time. Sometimes it 
is only a single glass made from fruit that is left 



142 "LIKE MOTHER USED TO MAKE" 

over from a meal, which will not keep until the 
next day. But little by little she does it, and by 
the end of the fruit season she has a good array 
of jams and jellies on her pantry shelves, and they 
have all come there a few at a time. 

This same kind of system enables its possessor 
to spare herself in a multitude of ways. If she 
is to have company for dinner she plans the meal 
so that she can make many of the preparations 
early in the day and allow herself to rest in the 
afternoon and come fresh to the table. There are 
always things that cannot be done until the last 
moment, but that is all the more reason for getting 
the others out of the way betimes. We have heard 
of that dinner at which the first course was " hot 
hostess," and many of us have been at such func- 
tions. There is a different kind of an appetizer at 
the dinner of the systematic housekeeper. 

One does not achieve a perfect method in a mo- 
ment, and as I have said before, there is always 
the personal equation to be reckoned with. Maids 
will fall sick or lose relatives or become recalci- 
trant. Accidents will occur now and then. But 
with system even these tribulations may be reduced 
to a negligible quantity. Possibly not the least 



" LIKE MOTHER USED TO MAKE " 143 

valuable part of system is the eflfect it has upon its 
possessor in the way of enabling her to keep a 
calmness of spirit and a control of nerves in the 
face of contretemps. 



XVII 

Home-made Aids to House- 
keeping 

The chapter upon " Systematizing the House- 
keeping " mentions a number of articles the 
housekeeper may prepare in odd moments. It is 
one thing to read over a list of such things; it is 
quite another to know how to prepare them. The 
average housekeeper is the possessor of one, pos- 
sibly two, or even three cook-books. To these she 
flies when the unfamiliar dish is prescribed. If 
she fails to find it in one of these volumes, she 
is absolutely at a loss. For most women have not 
yet formed the habit of going to a reference li- 
brary to hunt up this or that unusual recipe from 
the cook-books marshaled there. 

The most up-to-date cook-books contain many of 

the small foreign adjuncts to cookery that are so 

essential to the housewife who desires to set on 

small means a " dressy table," as I once heard a 

woman call it. The adjective did not apply to the 

144 



"LIKE MOTHER USED TO MAKE" 145 

literal table, but to the menu that included entrees 
and made dishes. For the proper compounding 
of these the housekeeper must have a store of con- 
diments in her pantry — not only the articles she 
buys at the fancy grocery, but those she can make 
herself in the odd moments above referred to. 
They are real labor and time-savers in the end, 
and if she prepares them one or two at a time, she 
never misses the minutes she puts into them — ' and 
it costs far less to make them than to buy them. 

Prominent among the aids to housekeeping come 
the white and the brown roux. 

To make the first of these, which is more popu- 
larly known as " white thickening," melt together 
half a pound each of butter and flour in a porce- 
lain-lined saucepan, stirring them constantly to pre- 
vent scorching. As soon as the mixture is hot 
through, and well blended — as it will be if the 
stirring is unremitting, — pack it into small jars; 
cover these to keep out the dust and set in a cool 
place. Jelly-glasses with tops are excellent to keep 
it in. When you wish a white sauce, all you have 
to do is to take two tablespoonfuls of this roux, 
put it into a half-pint of milk over the fire, and 
stir until the sauce is the consistency of double 



146 " LIKE MOTHER USED TO MAKE " 

cream. Season with salt and white pepper. To 
make it a Httle richer stir in a tablespoonful of but- 
ter just before the sauce goes to table. 

A brown roux is made with the same proportions 
of butter and flour, but the mixture is stirred un- 
til it is of a bright brown. It is then put away 
as the white roux has been. This rouXj or " brown 
thickening," is used as the white roux would be, 
except that it is dissolved in a half-pint of broth 
or of meat stock, instead of in milk. Suitable 
seasonings, such as onion- juice, catsup, and the 
like, can be added to taste. 

Sometimes the gravy made in this fashion is not 
the rich brown one desires. To produce this color 
it is well to have a little caramel coloring at hand. 
To prepare it put in a small granite saucepan over 
the fire three tablespoonfuls of water with six of 
granulated sugar. Boil them quickly for ten min- 
utes. At the end of this time the compound will 
become yellow, and then go to brown and black. 
When it is very black and looks like molasses, pour 
into it two-thirds of a cup of boiling water and stir 
until it is dissolved. There will be more or less 
sputtering at first, but when this has quieted down 
let the mixture boil to a syrup, and bottle it. A 



" LIKE MOTHER USED TO MAKE " 147 

few drops of this will color a gravy a shade of deep 
brown, and the caramel will keep for any length of 
time. Because of the sputter and smell of burnt 
sugar it is well to make it when company is not im- 
mediately expected. 

Tomato paste is another good thing to have in 
the house, and may be made when tomatoes are 
plenty. Half a peck of tomatoes, a carrot, and an 
onion may be sliced together, and to them is added 
a good-sized bunch of celery cut into pieces, leaves 
as well as stalks. Boil all very slowly until they 
are a soft paste that can be put through a vege- 
table-press. Return this pulp to the fire with a 
tablespoonful of salt and a teaspoonful of black pep- 
per, and cook slowly once more until a little spread 
to cool in a saucer thickens to a jelly. Spread it 
out on pie-plates in layers about half an inch 
thick and let it dry in the sun or in a cool oven. 
When it is dry it may be packed in boxes or wide- 
mouthed jars. To use, cook together a tablespoon- 
ful each of butter and flour until they bubble, pour 
half a pint of water upon them, with a piece of the 
paste about three inches square, and stir until the 
sauce is thick and smooth. Or make the sauce 
with the roux, as described above, and add the to- 



148 " LIKE MOTHER USED TO MAKE " 

mato paste to it. A little seasoning may be re- 
quired. 

Celery vinegar is often useful for sauces. Put 
half a pound of celery seed and a teaspoonful of 
salt into a pint of good vinegar, bottle, and cork 
the bottle, and let it stand for about a month. At 
the end of that time the vinegar may be poured off 
and will be ready for use. 

Bread crumbs are often prepared in advance, by 
grating stale bread and packing the crumbs away 
in jars. But not every one knows that bread may 
be cut into dice or into small fancy shapes for soup, 
dried slowly in a cool oven, and if put away in a 
tightly closed jar or tin box, will keep for a month 
in cool weather. 

The housekeeper who has a kitchen garden — 
and I have known of women who conducted a 
quite successful herb-garden in a box on a window- 
sill — need not be dependent upon the put-up herbs 
for seasoning. The herbs she raises are much 
more pungent if she will dry them, and when thor- 
oughly dry crumble them up and pack them in air- 
tight receptacles. Fresh mint may be put away to 
dry when it is plentiful, and if kept in a closed 
glass jar will serve as well as the fresh mint when 



" LIKE MOTHER USED TO MAKE " 149 

this is out of the market or is sold at out-of-season 
prices. 

Maitre d'hotel butter is an excellent stand-by for 
the housekeeper who wishes a sauce in a hurry. 
For this a half-pound of good butter is needed, a 
tablespoonful of fresh parsley, chopped, a small 
tablespoonful of lemon-juice, and a little salt and 
white pepper. All are mixed together and then 
packed into a jar. The jars in which Dundee mar- 
malade comes are good for this, as well as for the 
rouXy because of their wide tops. This butter is 
a delicious addition to fish of any kind, to potatoes 
boiled and served whole or sliced, to stewed po- 
tatoes. A tablespoonful of it may be put upon any 
of these or upon a steak. If the same quantity 
is put with an equal quantity of flour and stirred 
into a cup of hot milk or hot water, it makes an 
excellent sauce. A pretty way to serve it with 
fish is to pack it into halved lemon rinds from which 
the pulp has been scooped out. These are laid 
about the dish of fish and serve as a garnish. One 
is given with each portion of fish. 

For the benefit of those who are fond of good 
gravies and do not always have stock in the house, 
it is well to prepare a supply of glaze. This is a 



ISO " LIKE MOTHER USED TO MAKE " 

little troublesome, but it is cheaper in the end than 
any good meat extract. Four pounds of leg of 
beef and three pounds of knuckle of veal will be 
demanded to make a good stock. Cut the meat in 
pieces about the size of an egg and put with them 
half a pound of ham, cut up small. Take a large 
pot or preserving-kettle, which will hold at least 
two gallons, rub the bottom of it with a half cup of 
butter, and then put in the meat with one cupful of 
water, a small head of celery, a carrot, a turnip, 
and a couple of onions. Set the pot over a hot fire 
and stir for a while. When the bottom of the pot 
is covered with a thick glaze which sticks to the 
spoon, fill it up with cold water and bring this to a 
boil. After this point is reached move the pot over 
a slow flame, if you are cooking with gas; to the 
back of the stove, if you burn coal. It should sim- 
mer very slowly for about five hours, the scum that 
comes to the top being removed with a spoon. 

There is now in the pot an excellent stock, but 
it must be still further reduced for glaze. The 
liquor must be poured from the meat and strained, 
and the meat again covered with water. It should 
be hot this time, and must boil five hours longer. 
At the end of that time the first and the second 



"LIKE MOTHER USED TO MAKE" 151 

stock may be strained together into a clean pot, 
and boiled hard until reduced to three pints. It 
should be stirred once in a while and skimmed. 
Take it off once more, put it into another pot, and 
boil down to a quart, cooking slowly now. When 
this point is reached boil it more quickly again, 
stirring it steadily until it begins to thicken and 
turn yellow-brown. Watch that it does not scorch. 
Reduce to a pint. The glaze thus made may be 
kept in jars for use. A little of it added to a cup 
of boiling water and seasoned makes a gravy, a 
larger portion dissolved in hot water and thickened 
with rice or sago or vermicelli makes a good broth. 
As I have said — and shown, — it is troublesome 
to prepare, but it is a comfort when it is done. It 
will keep almost indefinitely. 

Fondant for icing cakes or for home-made 
French candies will also keep indefinitely, and is 
little trouble to make, beyond the vigilance it re- 
quires, and care in noting the exact stages of the 
cooking. 

Into a porcelain-lined or granite saucepan put 
a pound of granulated sugar and a half a pint of 
water and bring it to a boil. Do not stir. When 
it has boiled about ten minutes, test a little of it 



152 " LIKE MOTHER USED TO MAKE " 

in a cup of iced water. When it gets to the point 
that you can take the deposit that falls to the bot- 
tom of the water and make it into a ball that will 
not stick to your fingers, it is at the right stage. 
Take it from the fire and set in a cool place. If 
the sugar ball is brittle, it has boiled too long; you 
must put a little water in with it and then try it 
again. If it is at the right stage set it aside to 
cool, as I have said, and when it is blood-warm 
begin to stir it with a spoon or paddle. It will 
become white and soft, and you can handle it as 
though it were pastry. This can be kept until it 
is needed. To use it for icing, put some of the 
fondant in a small bowl, set this in an outer vessel 
of boiling water, and let it melt to the proper con- 
sistency for icing the cake. Flavor it and color it 
as you like. 

Bear in mind that when fondant is heated a sec- 
ond time it hardens much more quickly than it did 
the first time, and keep it very hot until you are 
entirely ready to use it. 

Pastry will not keep as long as the preparations I 
have already mentioned, and yet it may be kept 
for from a week to ten days, or even more, in very 
cold weather or on the ice. A fine pastry which 



"LIKE MOTHER USED TO MAKE" 153 

contains only butter for shortening is the best, and, 
although it is expensive, there are many who 
think it better worth while to have it seldom and 
to have it really good. 

For pastry of any sort all the ingredients and 
the utensils must be ice-cold, and if the mixing 
can be done in a very cool room, so much the bet- 
ter. A marble-slab is admirable for pastry; when 
this is not attainable the zinc top of a table is the 
next choice. If the ordinary pastry-board is em- 
ployed, leave it in the ice-box for several hours 
before using. 

Put a pound of flour and three-quarters of a 
pound of butter together into your chopping-bowl, 
which should be as cold as the board. Qiop them 
with a chilled chopping-knife until the butter is 
in bits about the size of a green pea. When this 
stage is reached, make a hole in the center of the 
flour and butter, in which put a small cup of iced 
watec. Mix with the chopping-knife, lightly, to 
a stiff paste. When just mixed, turn out on the 
board. If some of the bits of butter are not 
blended, never mind; put them all out together. 
They will mix in when you roll the paste. Roll it 
with the rolling-pin, which should be as cold as 



154 " LIKE MOTHER USED TO MAKE " 

everjd;hing else, into an oblong sheet, pressing it 
lightly. Fold the sheet in three, turn it with the 
end towards you and roll it again. Repeat this 
process three times, always turning the end of the 
roll towards you. Set it on the ice then until ready 
for use. When that time comes, cut it with a 
sharp knife, roll it slightly, and never let it get so 
warm that the butter appears soft and oily. 

This is known as rough puff paste and is almost 
equal to the fine French puff paste. 

Mayonnaise is so simple a thing to make that 
one marvels it should be considered a task by many. 
For this, too, everything used in mixing should be 
ice-cold. Divide the white and yolk of an egg, 
putting the yolk into a soup-plate. Put with it a 
good pinch of salt and one of mustard and the juice 
of a lemon. Begin stirring into this with a fork, 
your salad oil, a drop at a time. Continue this for 
several minutes, until the sauce begins to thicken. 
You may then add the oil more rapidly, until you 
are stirring it in by the teaspoonful. If the may- 
onnaise becomes too thick to stir well, put in a 
few drops of vinegar and reduce it to the right 
consistency. Continue in the same way until you 
have the desired amount of mayonnaise. One tgg 



"LIKE MOTHER USED TO MAKE" 155 

will take a pint of oil. Should the mayonnaise 
curdle before it is done, stir a piece of ice in with 
it and it will probably come back to the right state. 
If not, set the dish aside, take another egg, and 
begin again from the beginning. When the second 
stock is thick, work the curdled mayonnaise into it. 

Just before serving beat the white of the egg 
stiff and stir it into the mayonnaise. Do not do 
this to the portion you expect to keep. You may 
increase the original stock by adding more oil if 
you need it. Mayonnaise dressing will keep for 
a week on the ice. Sometimes it thins a little by 
keeping, and in this case more oil can be worked in. 

A good cake filling that will keep is the old-fash- 
ioned preparation known as lemon honey, or lemon 
butter. The yolks of three eggs are needed 
for this, and the white of one, the juice and rind 
of a large lemon, half a pound of sugar, and three 
large tablespoonfuls of the best butter. The salt 
must be washed from the butter, in the first place, 
and then it is put into the saucepan with the sugar, 
and melted. The eggs are beaten light, the grated 
lemon peel and the juice put with them, and all 
mixed together over the fire until of the consistency 
of very thick cream. It must be watched to keep 



iS6 "LIKE MOTHER USED TO MAKE" 

it from scorching. This may be put aside and 
kept for some time, to be used as cake filling when 
required. 

Quince honey is also a good cake filling. Peel 
and grate two good-sized quinces. Cook together 
a pound of sugar and a pint of water until they 
reach the state at which you take fondant from 
th^ fire. (See previous page.) Add the quince 
and boil, stirring constantly, for twenty minutes. 

Tutti-frutti filling is too little known. For this 
the tutti-frutti preserves, made by putting down 
fruits of different sorts in alcohol with sugar, are 
used. The fruits are chopped fine and then put 
over the fire and boiled down to a thick syrup. 
This makes a delicious filling, and is so rich that it 
can be used with a very simple cake and yet be 
suitable for a rather elaborate occasion. 

A caramel filling may be prepared from fondant 
by adding the burnt sugar, or caramel, made as 
described above, to the fondant after this is re- 
heated. Only a few drops will be needed to pro- 
duce the desired color and flavor. As the fondant 
hardens more with every heating, it is well to 
soften it with the addition of a little boiling water 
when it is to be employed for cake filling. 



"LIKE MOTHER USED TO MAKE" 157 

It may be of interest to housekeepers to know 
how to compound the tutti-frutti, referred to 
which may be put up at almost any season of the 
year. In summer berries may go into it, — straw- 
berries, raspberries, blackberries, cherries, and sec- 
tions of firm white peaches. In winter it may 
be made of pineapple cut into dice, of divided sec- 
tions of orange and mandarins or tangerines, white 
and Tokay grapes. If you wish the two varieties, 
summer and winter fruits may be combined. 

Whatever the fruit it should be put into self- 
sealing jars with broad tops, four tablespoon fuls 
of sugar allowed to each quart jar, and this sprin- 
kled over each layer of fruit. When this has been 
done, the jar may be filled to the top with white 
preserving brandy, pouring it in slowly enough to 
allow it to filter into every crevice. Screw down 
the tops and set the jars in a cool closet. The con- 
tents will not be ready for use until they have 
seasoned for several weeks.

Home Dinners Without a 
Servant 

The woman who does her own work has this 
great boon — she is not dependent upon the moods 
and tenses of servants. She can do as she pleases 
in her own house without fear of trouble. Should 
she choose to permit one member of the family 
to breakfast late, or should she wish to have dinner 
at an uncanonical hour she is not tormented by 
the reflection that Bridget or Gretchen or Chloe 
may be put out. Literally as well as figuratively 
she is mistress in her own house. 

Of course there are drawbacks to this state of 
affairs. There are to most human conditions. It 
is not always pleasant to have to get dinner on the 
hot days, or to wash dishes when one is tired, or 
to feel that if one is forced to stop through fa- 
tigue or indisposition ever)rthing else about the 
house stops too. But the marvelous law of com- 
pensation works here, as everywhere else, and for 

158 



"LIKE MOTHER USED TO MAKE" 159 

my own part I don't think that the woman who 
does her own work is an object of pity on that 
ground alone. It would be melancholy if she were, 
since there are nearly ninety-five per cent, of her 
in the United States against the small remaining 
fraction who hire help. 

The woman who does her own work is wise 
when she establishes conventions of her own and 
says she will live as she pleases. I know one such 
woman. She is a good housekeeper and a thrifty, 
for she has to consider the dollars-and-cents ques- 
tion very carefully. But she feels that she is of 
more importance than rules and regulations laid 
down for the use of those who have servants at 
their command, and she rules her own home in 
accordance with her theories. A happy home it 
is, too, and one to which guests are always wel- 
comed, with no word of apology for things being 
a little different from what they are in some other 
homes. Never had she a guest, to my knowledge, 
who did not enjoy the difference and find it a cause 
for praise and not for criticism. 

To begin at the beginning, she does not have 
the conventional breakfast. The family are fond 
of fruit, and this, with a cereal, a cup of good 



i6o " LIKE MOTHER USED TO MAKE " 

cofifee, rolls, and bacon or eggs cooked in some sim- 
ple way satisfy their needs for this meal. When 
summer fruit is plenty breakfast will consist of 
this, bread and butter, and cofifee for the grown- 
ups, with milk and a cereal besides for the chil- 
dren. These, by the way, are taught from the first 
that part of the work of the house is as much theirs 
as other portions are the share of their mother, and 
they bear their part of the burden as a matter of 
course and cheerfully, with no thought that they 
are being imposed upon or overtasked. 

The mother's morning is pretty busy, because 
she has not only most of the work of the house 
to do after the children are off for school, but some- 
times, because she was tired the night before or 
something interesting presented itself, she put most 
of the dinner dishes in hot water, after scraping 
them, covered them, and left them. The silver was 
washed and put away, but the bulk of the dishes 
were left to be done when she felt fresh and bright 
and ready for her day's work. She is systematic 
about her employments, too, in the line of sweep- 
ing, cleaning, etc., but she tries to take things as 
they come and not to worry. Lunch for the chil- 
dren when they come home from school at noon is 



" LIKE MOTHER USED TO MAKE " i6i 

plain and substantial, and her dinners are not the 
function one usually associates with the name. If 
she has stock in the house or if her meat course is 
light, she serves soup, but if not she has her meat 
course without preface, accompanying the meat 
with a couple of vegetables and following it some- 
times with a sweet — preferably fresh fruit — 
sometimes with a salad, crackers, and cheese. On 
rare occasions she may have all three courses, and 
a cup of coffee invariably finishes the meal. What- 
ever else she may have to economize upon, she in- 
sists upon good food and abundance of it for her 
household. There is never any omission of the 
niceties of serving or arrangement, and the impres- 
sion made upon the visitor is one of simple and 
elegant plenty. 

Granting that circumstances alter cases and that 
the same rule cannot be followed by all house- 
keepers, it may still be asserted that the woman 
who gives to her home-making the careful thought 
most women would bestow upon planning impor- 
tant additions to their wardrobes, can make far 
more of it and accomplish her duties with more 
ease and success than the woman who runs her 
house in haphazard fashion. Such thought and 



1 62 "LIKE MOTHER USED TO MAKE" 

care may possibly be omitted by the woman who 
has service at her command, although that they are 
necessary in her case also is proved by the experi- 
ence of every woman at the head of a domestic 
force. But planning which will simplify her labors 
and give her a degree of self-confidence that will 
connote poise and ease of mind is indispensable to 
the woman who does her own work. 

The chief problem that comes to a housekeeper 
in the daily round of her duties is dinner, as a 
matter of course. Not a formal dinner — that 
she may renounce as beyond her scope in existing 
conditions — but the regular evening meal. 
Breakfast is in most houses more or less of a scram- 
ble, and melancholy as this may be, it is as true in 
houses where there are competent servants as in 
the homes without them. In the millennium it is 
to be hoped that each member of a family will 
breakfast apart, but until that longed-for period 
one must resign one's self to a certain amount of 
friction at the morning meal, or if not to friction, to 
labored cheerfulness and obvious patience. Lunch- 
eon, too, is an informal repast with, at its best, a 
spice of picnic thrown in. 

But dinner! Here at least the household must 



" LIKE MOTHER USED TO MAKE " 163 

gather about itself what shreds of dignity it pos- 
sesses, and try to compass a meal that shall not be 
altogether unworthy of the distinguished name of 
dinner. And I contend that this is as possible in 
a household where no maid is employed as in one 
presided over by a butler — if only one goes about 
it in the right way. 

In the first place, however the bill of fare may 
depart from the conventions, there must be no such 
departure in the spreading of the table. The spot- 
less linen, the shining glass, silver, and china, must 
be as carefully arranged for the entirely domestic 
meal as for that to which guests are expected. 
When feasible there should be flowers or at least 
a growing plant in the middle of the table. No 
liberties or carelessness may be permitted with the 
stage-setting. The first look at the table should 
produce the impression of an orderly and dignified 
occasion. 

The same orderliness and dignity should con- 
tinue throughout the meal. Since there is no maid, 
the dishes for each course must all be put on the 
table at once, instead of having the vegetables on 
the side-table. But this was the universal custom 
years ago, and is still followed by preference in 



i64 " LIKE MOTHER USED TO MAKE " 

many homes where there are attendants to pass the 
dishes. The meat in front of the carver, each 
vegetable near some one who will serve it, a piece 
of bread and a butter-ball on each bread-and-but- 
ter plate, gravy or sauce, pickles or relishes, may all 
be in place when the family comes in. 

Once assembled and seated, a like orderliness 
should be adhered to in serving the food. If 
everything is on the table as it should be, there will 
be no need for constant jumping up to repair de- 
ficiencies. Nothing is more disturbing to the calm 
that should wait upon digestion than such irregu- 
larities. The butter has been forgotten and one 
person rushes to the refrigerator. There are not 
enough tablespoons and a relief expedition flies to 
the silver-drawer. The vinegar-cruet is empty and 
a third member of the family vanishes into the 
pantry. We have all of us known such dinner- 
tables and our gastronomic memories hold them in 
bitter souvenir. 

It is all so unnecessary! Thought and planning 
can soon make second nature of the habit of put- 
ting on the table in advance all that is likely to be 
required, and when this has been done the meal 
may progress in as pleasing a peace as would be 



" LIKE MOTHER USED TO MAKE " i6^ 

possible with trained service. It does the different 
members of the family no harm to wait on one an- 
other, and arouses in them a quickness to notice 
and anticipate the wants of others that is conspicu- 
ously absent from the manners of those who have 
always been served by attendants. 

When the table is not large enough to accom- 
modate without crowding the dishes that will be 
needed at the meal, a serving-table may be pressed 
into use and on this may be the overflow supply. 
Here, too, may be the pitcher of water, the plates 
for the salad or the dessert, with finger-bowls and 
doilies complete, the vinegar and oil cruets when 
these will be needed in preparing the salad dressing, 
the after-dinner coffee cups and saucers and sugar- 
bowl, and any other adjuncts which it is well to 
have near the hand of the mistress of the house. 

When the time comes to change the plates — 
for no lack of service must be permitted to inter- 
fere with the sequence of courses — the work 
should be deputed to one member of the family. 
The quiet of the earlier part of the meal should not 
be rudely dispelled by permitting half the persons 
at the table to be on their feet at once. If there 
are daughters in the household each may take her 



1 66 " LIKE MOTHER USED TO MAKE " 

turn at removing the plates, brushing the crumbs 
from the cloth, and bringing in the next course. 
Should there be only boys, it will do them no harm 
to gain a little dexterity in the details of housekeep- 
ing. Such instruction will cause their future wives 
to arise and call the mother-in-law blessed. Or if 
the task of changing the plates devolves upon the 
mistress of the house she may do it with as much 
calm and dignity as she would display in a less 
homely occupation. She could arrange flowers or 
fruit or dispense afternoon tea to guests with no 
embarrassment or attempt at apology. Why 
should she not clear her table with equal grace? 

Again let me emphasize the importance of every- 
thing being managed with the same precision when 
the family is alone as when guests are expected. 
In this manner only can the housekeeper be sure 
that when company comes she will not be taken at 
a disadvantage. 

The woman who does her own work is some- 
times in danger of gliding into an attitude of 
shrinking from guests. Very mistakenly she feels 
that when she cannot offer the perfection of em- 
ployed service to her friends she does not care to 
ask them to her table. Thus the man of the house 



" LIKE MOTHER USED TO MAKE " 167 

too often has to renounce the privilige, dear to his 
heart, of bringing home a chance guest. When 
young and inexperienced he cherishes the illusion 
that he can do this at any time without warning, 
and it takes a 'series of bitter lessons to convince 
him that he is not free in this regard, and that 
even if he sends word to his wife that one of his 
old college friends has happened in and that he is 
bringing him out to dinner he may be making a 
terrible blunder. 

It is always a pity when this stage is reached. 
The man who comes to the point where he is 
afraid to invite a friend home with him when he 
pleases has lost something besides the privilege. 
A certain degree of confidence in his wife's ability 
to meet emergencies, in her eagerness to give him 
pleasure, is gone. I say this without any wish to 
minimize the inconveniences it often causes a wife 
to have sudden guests, whether announced an hour 
in advance or entirely unheralded. Yet, after all, 
it is not such a calamity to have to share with a 
friend that which the housekeeper has considered 
good enough for her own, and it is ten to one that 
if the guest is made welcome and given to feel that 
his coming brought pleasure and bothered no one 



i68 " LIKE MOTHER USED TO MAKE " 

he will be as well pleased as if his visit had been 
planned for days ahead. 

The woman who gives her husband the right — ■ 
which should have been his already — to bring 
home a friend when he pleases should have an 
emergency cupboard to which she can turn if the 
provision that was enough for six should seem slim 
for seven. In this closet may be tinned soups that 
need only heating and a little seasoning to be ready 
for the table, a few cans of good fish, meat, and 
preserves, jars of fancy cheeses, a supply of crack- 
ers, olives, and a few other things whose addition 
to the table will help out a plain meal. She may 
seldom have to draw upon this stock, but the knowl- 
edge that it is there will be a comfort to her. In 
any case let her avoid the pitfall of apologies. 
Their usual effect is to indicate faults or omissions 
to a guest who never would have perceived them 
had not the luckless excuse for their existence 
forced them upon his attention. 

A valuable aid in the housekeeping of the woman 
with no servant is a selection of dishes for keeping 
food hot. There are many of these. The chafing- 
dish first — not only the one used for table cook- 
ery, but the old-fashioned hot-water dish whose 



" LIKE MOTHER USED TO MAKE " 169 

chief function is a heat-preserver. This has a 
cover, of course, and is usually large enough to hold 
a medium-sized roast, to say nothing of steak or 
chops. Next come the casseroles, of which there 
are many styles and sizes. Some are much orna- 
mented, others plain, and they may be used not only 
for the preparation of food en casserole, but also 
as bake-dishes for vegetables and puddings. Also 
there are plates especially for hot breads, consist- 
ing either of covers fitted over plates or else with 
a hot-water reservoir in the lower part. These 
may in a measure take the place of a servant in sup- 
plying hot food to the family without hired service.

Entertaining Without Service 

The woman with one maid or no maid at all may 
feel that she is debarred from dinner-giving. Or 
she may feel that the trouble of the dinner out- 
weighs the pleasure she grants or gains. The 
luncheon, the supper, or the afternoon tea fits so 
well into her capabilities as to kindle or strengthen 
in her heart a belief in special Providence. 

With these forms of entertaining, as with the 
dinner, the preparation is much what the hostess 
chooses to make it. I have spoken before of the 
tendency to simplify meals. The rule which pre- 
vails at dinners extends to luncheons. I have in 
mind lunch-parties I have met where course after 
course succeeded one another — appetizer, bouillon, 
fish, entree, piece de resistance, more entrees, sor- 
bet, game, salad, sweet, fruit, coffee — until the 
women who began bravely under the impression 
that the meal would be only an extension of 

170 



LIKE MOTHER USED TO MAKE" 171 



the light repast usual in the middle of the day 
felt themselves on the verge of collapse from 
plethora. 

This sort of thing may once have been fashion- 
able. Never vi^as it rational. It is a sign of the 
increasing common sense of the entertaining com- 
munity that it is no longer even a la mode. 

Let me tell of two luncheons which stand out in 
my memory, and might serve as models to the 
woman without a maid. 

The first was given in an old house dating back 
to Colonial days. Need for economy, combined 
with the difficulty of securing servants in a rather 
remote country locality, had obliged the mistress of 
the house and her daughters to do their own work. 
They had all the traditions of elegant living, and 
they carried these into effect when they waited on 
themselves as when they had trained service. 
Three of us fortunate guests took our places at a 
dining-table of old mahogany, and ate and drank 
from ancestral china, glass, and silver. The table 
was laid with centerpiece and doilies of fine da- 
mask, flowers were in the middle of the table, and 
ever3d;hing was arranged in the usual conventional 
fashion. 



172 " LIKE MOTHER USED TO MAKE " 

It was summer, and the first course was jellied 
bouillon. When this had been eaten one of the 
daughters rose, with no word of apology, and re- 
moved the cups, leaving our empty plates in front 
of us. The next course, a cold meat of some sort, 
a salad, and fresh rolls, was already on the table, 
and we served ourselves, passing plates as we would 
have done at the home table if without a maid. 
Tea was made and poured by the hostess. 

This course finished, the daughter again rose, re- 
moved the plates, crumbed the table, and put on a 
dish of superb strawberries, a pitcher of cream, 
and a plate of cake. Again we waited on our- 
selves. All through the meal the conversation was 
easy and pleasant, with no word of apology for 
the lack of a maid — and, indeed, her absence was 
scarcely noted. When we left the house it was 
with the memory of a delightful lunch, prepared 
and served with a perfection that left no room for 
criticism. 

The other luncheon was eaten many miles from 
the first, at the home of a young couple who were 
obliged, for economy's sake, to dispense with a 
maid. Five of us sat down to table and found at 
each place a glass cup filled with ice-cold fruit 



LIKE MOTHER USED TO MAKE " 173 



macedoine. As we finished this we followed the 
example of our host and set our cups to one side. 
The hostess had a serving-table at her elbow and a 
chafing-dish in front of her, and proceeded to pre- 
pare the hot dish of the meal. Light rolls and 
Saratoga chips were on the table, and beside each 
place when we sat down was a plate of salad. 
Not until all the substantials had been eaten did the 
hostess arise, quietly remove the plates, brush off 
the crumbs, and put before each of us half a nut- 
meg melon filled with ice-cream. On the veranda, 
after lunch, she brewed us coffee in a Vienna coffee- 
pot. 

I have attended many large and elaborate lunch- 
eons of which I have forgotten the details, but 
every feature of these two delightful meals remains 
with me. Only gentlewomen, too sure of their 
position to be conscious or uncomfortable because 
deprived of hired service, could have carried 
through affairs with so much dignity and grace. 

If I have made a long preamble it is because I 
feel that the rehearsal of the success of two house- 
keepers may be helpful to others similarly situated. 

The table for a luncheon without a maid should 
be prettily set, bare if the table-top warrants it. 



174 " LIKE MOTHER USED TO MAKE " 

except for centerpiece and doilies, and covered with 
a white cloth if the wood is not presentable. Some 
luncheon cloths have a little color about them and 
are very attractive. Smaller napkins are used for 
luncheon than for dinner, and may be adorned with 
drawn-work or plainly hemstitched. The napkin 
is laid by the forks at the left of the plate, the knife 
and spoon at the right, the tumbler near the latter. 
Little dishes of candies, olives, and nuts may be on 
the table, and the bread-and-butter plates, usually 
omitted at a dinner, may be on the left of the place 
in a position corresponding to the tumbler on the 
right. 

A luncheon may begin with beef or chicken 
bouillon, hot or cold, or with clam or oyster soup. 
Or this course may be omitted and a macedoine of 
fruit or halved grapefruit or melon may be served 
instead. If the macedoine is served, it may be in 
cocktail or lemonade glasses, the fruit cut into dice 
and very cold. This may be on the table when the 
guests come into the room. 

For the second course, if fish is to be served, 
creamed fish au gratin is excellent, since this may 
stand for some time after cooking without injury 
to its excellence. Fish may be omitted, if one pre- 



" LIKE MOTHER USED TO MAKE " 175 

fers, and creamed chicken au gratin come next, or 
chicken served in some other way, or chops. This 
would be also the time to bring the chafing-dish 
into service, and to cook in it oysters, or fish, or 
meat, or cheese, or eggs, or any of the other dain- 
ties known to the chafing-dish expert. These are 
served directly from the chafing dish. 

This course may be succeeded by a salad, or ac- 
companied by it if one prefers, and there should 
be an effort to have the salad something a little un- 
usual. Salads without number are possible nowa- 
days, and nearly every week brings the suggestion 
of a fresh one. 

Next, the sweet, and this, too, may be simple or 
elaborate, as one pleases. Ice-cream is not indis- 
pensable. Stewed figs, figs and green ginger, ber- 
ries in jelly with whipped cream over them or au 
naturel or with cream, tarts of fruit or anything 
else, syllabubs, such as they know how to make in 
the Old Dominion, and which may easily be made 
at the North in a region where cream and eggs are 
plenty — there is no need that I should make fur- 
ther suggestions. To end, a cup of coffee, unless it 
is preferred to serve this with the second course. 
My description of the two luncheons in my intro- 



176 "LIKE MOTHER USED TO MAKE" 

duction may supply suggestions for changing plates 
and other service. 

The supper, whether for Sunday night or some 
other occasion, is conducted much along the lines 
of the luncheon, and is even more informal. It 
rarely begins with a soup or appetizer, unless it 
may be toast or thin bread and butter with caviare 
or anchovy paste or something of the sort. The 
solid is usually prepared in the chafing-dish. The 
suggestions for this are numberless. Eggs d, la 
Newhurg, or curried, or deviled, or panned, or in 
black butter, or poached in cream or tomato sauce, 
or in combination with fish, flesh, or fowl, or in a 
Scotch woodcock; cheese in a rarebit or a fondu 
(and every man there will have his own view how 
the rarebit should be made, agreeing upon one point 
only, that his method differs entirely from the one 
followed at the moment) ; oysters, or clams, or lob- 
ster or crab meat a la poulette or a la Dewey or 
a la Newhurg or deviled, chicken terrapin or au 
supreme or in any one of a dozen other ways — 
there is no limit to the dishes, and they may be as 
inexpensive or as costly as one chooses to make 
them. 

The second course at such a supper should not 



" LIKE MOTHER USED TO MAKE " 177 

be elaborate. Cold meat, if one wants it, with a 
salad, or, if the salad is rather heavy and substan- 
tial food has been served from the chafing-dish, the 
cold meat may well be left out. If it appears it 
may be cold tongue or chicken, turkey or duck, 
ham, lamb, veal, or beef, or veal loaf, galantine or 
jellied chicken, and the salad may be suitable to ac- 
company it. 

The sweet should not be rich. Enough tax has 
already probably been laid upon the digestion. 
Fruit or cream cheese and jam or something of 
equal simplicity should conclude the meal. Choc- 
olate or cofifee may be served at the second course 
in large cups, or at the end in demi-tasses. 

For supper the table is spread as for luncheon. 
The hors d'ceuvre are served or omitted, as one 
pleases. The chafing-dish is on the table from the 
first, and the cups and saucers may be put on the 
table when it is set. 

For a late-at-night supper, after a card-party or 
similar affair, the supper is a little less substantial. 
The chafing-dish preparation may be there, but the 
second course may be left out altogether, or only a 
salad, and that not rich or elaborate, given after 
the chafing-dish dainty. This, by the way, in the 



178 " LIKE MOTHER USED TO MAKE 



/ 



interests of humanity, should not be too deaaly. 
Many a man will feel safe in taking liberties yith 
his digestion on Sunday night — perhaps fancying 
that the sanctity of the day may have a happy effect 
upon the gastronomic apparatus — who would hes- 
itate to run a like risk at the end of a social evening 
which has followed a long working-day and a 
hearty dinner. 

In warm weather the chafing-dish is best dis- 
missed, and the late supper may consist of a salad, 
thin bread and butter or sandwiches, and iced 
drinks of some sort. Fruit punches and similar 
summer drinks are many, both with and without 
alcohol. Whether the supper be early or late, Sun- 
day or week-night, the services of a maid may well 
be dispensed with. Part of the enjoyment of such 
an occasion is due to its unconventionality, and the 
men of the party may wait on themselves and on 
the women present with no breach of decorum. 

The hostess contemplating an afternoon tea has 
even smoother sailing than when planning a supper. 
Besides getting her house in fresh order and ar- 
ranging her flowers, her chief preliminary work 
will be making cake and sandwiches. Both are es- 
sential at an afternoon tea where guests are enter- 



" LIKE MOTHER USED TO MAKE " 179 

tained, but the choice of what each shall be is un- 
limited. The sandwiches are as much comme il 
faut, when of thin bread and butter folded in two 
and cut into squares or triangles or circles, as when 
they are filled with pate de foie gras or anything 
else equally costly. The medium between these ex- 
tremes is taken by sandwiches of minced chicken 
or tongue or ham, or of cheese and nuts, or cheese 
and lettuce, or any one of a dozen other fillings, 
and the bread may be white, brown, whole wheat, 
graham, gluten, or any other variety. 

The same license prevails about cake. Home- 
made or fancy, either will serve, and may be one 
or two kinds or a larger selection. Salted nuts and 
bonbons may also be offered. 

The tea must be the best and carefully brewed. 
An excellent plan is to make it very strong early 
in the afternoon, and, when it has drawn five min- 
utes, to turn it from the leaves. It may then be 
kept hot, and diluted with boiling water as one 
pleases, with no dread that tannic acid is developing 
by long steeping. 

When the hostess intends to have more than half 
a dozen or so guests at her tea, she should, unless 
she has daughters to aid her, invite some one to 



i8o " LIKE MOTHER USED TO MAKE " 

help her pour the tea or the tea and coffee or choco- 
late she offers her friends. In any case it is well 
to secure the services of some young girls or inti- 
mate friends who will supplement the activities of 
the hostess and see that no one is overlooked. 

At a small function where the tea is made by 
the hostess or her daughter or friend in the draw- 
ing-room, the tea-table is supplied with hot-water 
kettle, tea-caddy, and tea-pot. When the table is 
large enough the cups and saucers, sugar-bowl and 
cream-jug and saucer of sliced lemon, may also 
be here or on another small table. Several small 
tables to be set in front of the guests, that they 
may take their tea in comfort, will prove an addi- 
tion to the coziness of the occasion. For such a 
purpose the pretty and inexpensive folding-tables 
are excellent, and are especially desirable for the 
dweller in flats with small extra space at command.

The Stag Repast Without 
Service 

The home stag dinner is growing in popularity, 
especially in small places and among men who wish 
to show hospitality without extravagance. Once it 
was almost unheard of in those circumstances. 
The man of means who lived in a large city enter- 
tained his men friends at his club or at a restaurant, 
or not at all. In a small town, which boasted no 
club or satisfactory hostelry, he gratified his long- 
ings for social intercourse with other men by lodge 
meetings, town meetings, the card club of the com- 
muters' train, or the post-ofifice parliament and 
corner-grocery council, according to his social 
standing and his opportunities. The man who had 
no such outlet contented himself with the mild 
mixed society afforded by the occasional teacup 
gatherings of his wife's friends and their husbands. 

But now, at last, the long down-trodden man is 
beginning to have a few chances to get his innings. 

l8i 



i82 " LIKE MOTHER USED TO MAKE " 

The wave of altruistic socialism that is sweeping 
over the world has reached even to him, and wives 
recognize the fact that mere men may like to meet 
and talk, even although they may not be parsons, 
lawyers, or doctors. For the benefit of these three 
classes a convention has long existed, by virtue 
of which it was considered right that they should 
gather together at stated periods, presumably to ex- 
change great thoughts upon the subjects to which 
their lives were devoted. To-day, however, the 
" common or garden variety " of business or pro- 
fessional man has had accorded to him the right to 
meet his fellows and chat with them over food as 
women for generations have gossiped over their 
tea. And from these deliberations it is agreed that 
the opposite sex is best absent. 

Preparations for the home stag party naturally 
devolve upon the wife of the man who gives the 
party. She may not preside over the board, as 
in her secret soul she yearns to do, but she may 
at least make ready for the guests, and if she is 
the right kind of a woman she will probably do it 
with genuine pleasure in the enjoyment she antici- 
pates for her husband. Moreover, she would not 
be a woman if with this altruistic joy there were 



" LIKE MOTHER USED TO MAKE " 183 

not mingled a pride in showing how well she can 
do in the circumstances. A stag dinner or supper 
is a simple affair in a home where there is a butler 
or a waitress. It is quite another matter in an es- 
tablishment where no maid is kept and the house- 
keeper, knowing that every man at the festivity will 
go home and tell his wife all about it, girds up her 
loins and resolves to do mightily or perish in the 
attempt. The fact that she is probably handi- 
capped by the necessity for economy as well as by 
lack of service is only an additional incentive. 

Since the housekeeper is not to enter the dining- 
room after the guests are assembled, ever)d:hing 
that can possibly be needed must be there in ad- 
vance. If her husband is like a majority of men- 
folk he would be hard put to it to supply any de- 
ficiency she might leave. The table itself must be 
well stocked, and the serving-table must supply the 
lack of the butler. 

A regular dinner can hardly be planned for in 
the conditions, and the skill of the caterer must be 
expended to make a meal which will take so well the 
place of the ordinary dinner that no one will notice 
a defect in either omissions or commissions. 
Should a soup be served, it must be in cups and 



i84 " LIKE MOTHER USED TO MAKE " 

heavy in character — like mock turtle. Such pre- 
ambles as oysters, clams, and fruit are out of the 
question, and the woman is wise who boldly turns 
her back upon all conventions connected with the 
dinner hour and calls her husband's stag party a 
supper. This name covers a multitude of short- 
comings and disarms criticism. 

In these days of an advanced higher education 
for the masses there are few men who have not 
a little knowledge of how to handle a chafing-dish. 
If the man who is to give the party is lacking in 
this branch of erudition it is well for his wife to 
give him a few lessons in advance — ' unless he num- 
bers among his prospective guests some one who 
is considered by himself and others to be an adept 
in that line. In this case let the housekeeper find 
the details of the dishes in whose preparation the 
adept especially fancies himself, procure from him 
a list of the necessary ingredients, and leave the re- 
sult on the knees of the gods. It is henceforth out- 
side of her jurisdiction. 

If her own man-body is to do the cooking, how- 
ever, and if he has a faculty in this line, she should 
have no difficulty in selecting a dish which will ap- 
peal to the palates of the diners. Scotch woodcock 



" LIKE MOTHER USED TO MAKE " 185 

or some dish of oysters or chicken or cheese will 
do to begin the feast. Should such a contingency 
arise as that none of the men can conduct a chafing- 
dish, she herself can prepare the dainty in the dish 
just before the guests are summoned to the table. 
The hot water in the lower pan will keep the con- 
tents of the upper one warm. 

When more than one hot dish is desired it is well 
to have two chafing-dishes — not for cookery, but 
to serve as bains-marie. In one of these may be a 
savory vegetable — or one may contain a dish of 
eggs, the other one of shell-fish or of poultry or 
cheese. One or two vegetables may be kept hot in 
covered bake-dishes. A supply of warm bread may 
also be placed in a covered dish. Minor delicacies, 
like olives, nuts, radishes, etc., are not strictly 
needed at such a meal, although they will doubtless 
be eaten if provided. The salad is a consideration, 
and it should be something rather substantial. 
Rare are the men who do not cherish a conviction 
that there is no dish much better than chicken salad 
— unless it may be lobster salad. If, however, the 
early part of the supper has included either one of 
these viands, a green salad may be served instead, 
and there will surely be some man who prides him- 



,l86 " LIKE MOTHER USED TO MAKE " 

self on his ability to mix a salad dressing, and will 
gladly undertake this part of the work. 

Cheese there must be, and of more than one kind. 
Camembert and Swiss, perhaps, or Roquefort and 
club-house. In these days, when so many of the 
fancy cheeses are put up in glass jars, they may be 
procured in all parts of the country, and no one 
need be debarred because his home is far from a 
large city market. 

Sweets are less popular among men than among 
women, and few of the guests would miss a dessert 
from such a meal as this. Should one be served 
it may be a charlotte-russe or a jelly or a tipsy cake 
— I unless, indeed, one boldly defies the thought of 
future retribution and rejoices the palates with a 
pie — the more unwholesome the better ! 

Coffee may be kept hot in an urn. Wines and 
liquors are often served at such suppers, but this is 
a matter to be determined by the host, who will 
make his own selection of these beverages. 

For such a supper much thought must be given 
by the housekeeper, as I have already intimated, to 
arranging provisions, dishes, etc., in such a fashion 
that they will be ready to hand when they are 
needed. To this main consideration many details 



"LIKE MOTHER USED TO MAKE" 187 

must be subjected. At a gathering of men there 
is little appreciation of delicate doilies, filmy center- 
pieces, artistic candle shades, and the like and these 
are out of place. The table may be bare except for 
a round or a square in the middle and a doily under 
each plate. The light would better come from over 
the table than from candelabra, which take up space 
and interfere with the men's .service of themselves 
and one another. 

Each cover or place should be supplied with a 
water-glass, a bread-and-butter plate, a couple of 
knives, two or three forks, two teaspoons, a napkin, 
and two plates, one placed on the other. The upper 
of the two should be heated for the product of the 
chafing-dish. A piece of bread or a roll and a but- 
ter-ball should be on each bread-and-butter plate. 
At one end of the table may be the chafing-dish, at 
the other the cofifee-urn. Around the latter may be 
grouped the cups and saucers. About the chafing- 
dish .should be placed the necessary spoons and 
measuring-cup, the bowl for mixing, the seasonings 
required. On one side of the table should be a plate 
of hot bread, on the other the dish of salad, the fork 
and spoon for serving it close at hand. 

Should the host preside over either the chafing- 



i88 "LIKE MOTHER USED TO MAKE" 

dish or the coffee-urn, his seat will naturally be at 
one end of the table. In either case, close enough 
to his right hand to be within easy reach without 
impeding the movement of his arm in mixing or 
pouring, should be a serving-table — or butler's 
tray, or dinner wagon — whichever one chooses to 
call it. One of the " double-deckers " is the most 
useful in the circumstances, although the ordinary 
table may be made to answer. 

On this table should stand the sweet — if sweet 
there be — with the necessities for serving it, a 
few extra cups, saucers, and plates, knives, forks, 
spoons, and napkins in case of accident to those al- 
ready on the table, and any other articles for which 
there is not space on the main board — crackers, 
cheese, celery, etc. 

A little drilling as to how to conduct matters will 
not be out of place for the master of the revels, un- 
less he has had a good deal of experience. When 
he leads his friends out to the dining-room every- 
thing should be in readiness for the first course, 
so that it will be a simple matter for him to serve 
his guests from the chafing-dish, the hot bake-dish 
of potatoes om gratin, or scalloped tomatoes, or 
baked onions, or whatever other vegetable has been 



" LIKE MOTHER USED TO MAKE " 189 

provided. The coffee can also be poured at this 
stage. 

After the first course has been eaten and there is 
need for the lower clean plate for salad, cheese, etc., 
it is a simple matter for the guests to pass their 
plates, with the knives and forks that have been 
used, up to the host, who sets them off on the lower 
shelf of the serving-table, if it is a two-shelved af- 
fair, or on the back of the table if a lower shelf is 
lacking. The fresh plates are then in readiness for 
the next course. Should the chafing-dish or any of 
its appurtenances be in the way they also can be 
set off on the side table by the host, and on the main 
table, in place of the articles removed, he can put 
the cheese and crackers. If there is a spirit-lamp 
under the coffee-urn the second cup may be as hot 
as the first. 

The service of a sweet presents only a trifling 
complication. Should the serving-table be large 
enough to receive the second set of soiled plates 
without crowding, there will be no trouble at all, 
but it may be incumbent upon the host to pile some 
of the plates on top of one another before he can 
make space for all. The cheese need not go off 
when the pie or other sweet comes on — indeed. 



I90 "LIKE MOTHER USED TO MAKE" 

the ordinary niceties of removing all savory dishes 
before the appearance of the dessert is honored in 
the breach on such an occasion as this. If a third 
fork was placed by the plate when the table was 
spread the only changing to be done is to hand a 
fresh plate to each guest, at the same time taking 
from him the plate last used. The cheese may be 
pushed to one side in order that there may be space 
for the sweet. 

As will be seen, this meal need not be a porten- 
tous undertaking. The housekeeper who is accus- 
tomed to preparing the meals for her family will 
find little extra work in such a supper as I have 
outlined. When the host is thoroughly at his ease, 
as most men are in similar circumstances, the sup- 
per is almost sure to go off well. The men may 
feel at liberty to get up and move about the room, 
replenish their own plates, or glasses or cups, and 
all freedom is permitted in the way of passing 
plates, reaching across the table for anything 
needed, and similar informalities which would not 
be tolerated at a dinner served in accordance with 
ordinary conventions. 

At such a " spread " as this the guests are prone 
to sit late, but it may be remarked, as a gentle re- 



LIKE MOTHER USED TO MAKE " 191 



minder, that if the host leads the party back to the 
drawing-room at the close of the meal he furnishes 
his wife a longed-for opportunity to come in and 
remove the debris and restore the room to its nor- 
mal condition. 

Perhaps I have seemed to deal too much in glit- 
tering generalities in outlining this bill of fare. If 
I have done so it is because the choice of the items 
is usually decided by the financial circumstances of 
the hostess. When money is little or no object for 
this special occasion, she may sally forth boldly to 
make her choice of provisions in the markets with 
her knowledge of what she knows her husband likes 
and thinks his friends would fancy for guide. But 
it is not likely so Utopian a state of affairs prevails 
with the woman who is preparing a stag party to be 
managed by herself alone.- The brains that must 
devise contrivances to supply the lack of a butler 
must also be put to work to achieve a high-priced re- 
past — 'Or what produces the impression of being 
such a meal — on a rather slim outlay of money. 

Granting, for the sake of argument, that she can 
indulge herself on this festive occasion, she can have 
nothing better for the main dish of the feast than a 
big platter of broiled or fried chicken, or an array 



^I 



192 " LIKE MOTHER USED TO M 

/ 

; 

of broiled birds, or a fine roast turkey. Any one 
of these is sure to appeal to the palates of the men 
assembled. But should economy be an essential 
she may either buy a big steak (which is not so very 
economical, after all), a stuffed shoulder of veal, 
or else prepare a fine piece of beef a la mode, which 
done the right way, is, by the way, a very different 
article from the dish that masquerades at restau- 
rants under that name. 

A casserole is a godsend for such a meal as this. 
Not only does it possess the merit of keeping its 
contents hot, but it enables the hostess to devise 
savory combinations at less cost than is possible 
with choice cuts prepared after a plainer mode. 
The products of a casserole, if properly managed, 
are so appetizing that mere man will not stop to 
count the cost while rejoicing his palate. 

Steak en casserole is good, chops en casserole are 
better, chicken en casserole is best. But here again 
comes in the item of expense, for it takes a clever 
woman to make good casserole of chicken out of 
anything but a youngling of a flock, although with 
care a fowl may be treated in such a fashion that 
no one will conjecture its years. But chops en cas- 
serole, if well prepared, with Parisian potato-balls, 



" LIKE MOTHER USED TO MAKE " 193 

mushrooms, peas, and plenty of savory gravy, will 
leave no place for criticism in the minds of the eat- 
ers. 

The cost of the main dish and that of the salad 
may offset each other. If a lobster salad has been 
served a cheaper main dish may be offered, while 
if the principal plat of the feast is costly the salad 
may be something less expensive — like a mace- 
doine of vegetables or a fruit salad, which, while a 
little trouble to compound, is less costly than either 
lobster or chicken.

Home-Made Cakes for Afternoon 
Tea 

The afternoon tea has come to stay. It is too 
convenient a function to be dispensed with. There 
is no pleasanter or easier way of paying off a massi 
of social obligations than by having a tea. To this 
end elaborate afternoon receptions, still called 
" teas," are given, and at these crowded affairs one 
is served with salads, sandwiches, frappes, and 
cakes of all kinds, while the beverages range from 
tea and coffee to punches. 

It is not, however, of such a function that the 
housewife in modern means thinks when she would 
entertain her friends. With little expense she may 
have a " day " or a series of " days " during the 
winter, without calling to her aid a caterer or an 
army of servants. She and her one maid can make 
all necessary preparations, and furnish the simple 
refreshments required. 

As the rooms would have to be lighted for the 

early winter twilight, it is well to draw down the 

194 



" LIKE MOTHER USED TO MAKE " 195 

shades at first and have the apartment illuminated 
with shaded lamps and candles. There is nothing 
prettier or more becoming than this subdued and 
shaded effulgence. On the tea table may stand a 
tall candelabrum, while its mate has its place upon 
the top of the upright piano. A dainty little lamp 
— what we used to call a " fairy lamp," when such 
ones were first in vogue, — is on one end of the 
chimney-shelf. A larger lamp with a soft pink 
globe is on a table near the door. One may have 
as many of such lights as she wishes, and yet there 
will be no glare to try the eyes and call into evi- 
dence unbecoming wrinkles, as do the merciless 
electric lights. 

Upon a tea table presided over by a friend of the 
hostess are the teapot and the canister, the spirit 
lamp and plates of dainty sandwiches cut in various 
shapes, and fancy cakes of all sorts. Here, too, 
may be served coffee. With the cups of the smok- 
ing beverages will be passed sugar, cream, and thin 
slices of lemon. The sandwiches may be of brown 
bread and white, with delicious fillings, and the 
fancy cakes simple or elaborate, as the hostess may 
decree. 

To the woman who will make herself mistress of 



196 " LIKE MOTHER USED TO MAKE " 

the art of preparing homemade fancy cakes, the af- 
ternoon tea has few terrors so far as expenses is 
concerned. At first she may find it a little hard to 
manufacture these toothsome dainties, but she will 
soon become accustomed to the work, and will be 
surprised to find how many varieties she can " turn 
out." The essentials are suitable materials and an 
abundance of patience. A novice must not be dis- 
couraged if, at first, her boiled icing becomes granu- 
lated or sugary, and if the cake is sometimes too 
crumbly to cut into just the desired shapes. After 
several trials she will learn when the correct point 
in boiling the syrup is reached, and just how stiff 
the batter must be. She must always have on hand 
a supply of vegetable colorings, — especially pink 
and green and violet, — and such nuts as almonds 
and English walnuts, with a plentiful stock of cur- 
rants and raisins. Citron, also, may play an im- 
portant part in the decoration of the cakes. Al- 
mond paste can be bought already prepared for the 
macaroons. 

Before giving the following recipes for fancy 
cakes of various sorts, it may be well to tell just 
how the boiled icing, essential to a well-frosted 
fancy cake, must be prepared. 



" LIKE MOTHER USED TO MAKE " 197 

BOILED ICING 

Into a perfectly clean, porcelain-lined saucepan 
put a pound of granulated sugar and a teacupful of 
water. Bring to the boiling point, but do not stir. 
At the end of fifteen minutes begin to test the 
syrup by dipping into it the tip of a fork. When 
the drops run from the fork slowly, leaving after 
the last one a blunt end, the correct point is nearly 
reached, and the syrup must be watched carefully. 
As soon as there floats from this blunt bit what ap- 
pears to be a very fine hair, the syrup -must be re- 
moved immediately from the fire. Set in a cool 
place until a little more than blood warm, and then 
beat the mixture to a white mass. When too stiff 
to stir it may be worked with the hands. This is 
the fondant icing for the cakes. When it is to be 
used, the vessel containing it is set in an outer vessel 
of boiling water. The fondant icing is then beaten 
until it is again a soft white mass. This may be 
flavored and colored to suit the taste. A few 
drops of spinach or other green vegetable coloring 
will make a delicate shade of pale green, a little 
cochineal will give an exquisite pink shade, while 
melted chocolate may be added until you have the 
desired brown. Spread quickly on the cakes with 



198 " LIKE MOTHER USED TO MAKE " 

a knife dipped in boiling water. Small cakes that 
are to be iced all over are thrust through with a 
long-pronged pickle-fork and plunged into the fond- 
ant, then quickly withdrawn and set on platters to 
dry. A quantity of fondant may be prepared at a 
time and set a,way in jelly glasses covered with 
paper, until needed. A little may be softened over 
boiling water and used as it is wanted. Each time 
it is heated, the hardening process is quickened. 
Use it briskly after making it hot. 

SQUARE CHOCOLATE CAKES 

Rub to a cream a half cup of butter and a tea- 
cupful of sugar, add four well-whipped eggs and 
seven tablespoonfuls of grated chocolate dissolved 
in a half cup of scalding milk. Flavor with vanilla 
and stir in lightly a pint of flour sifted with a heap- 
ing teaspoonful of baking powder. Bake in a 
square biscuit-pan. When done, and almost- cool, 
cut the cake in halves. Spread the lower half with 
a chocolate filling, or with chocolate icing. Lay 
the other half on top of it, and, with a sharp knife, 
cut into squares of a uniform size. Cover each of 
these smoothly with chocolate icing. 



LIKE MOTHER USED TO MAKE " 199 



NUT CAKES 

Cream a half cup of butter with one cup of sugar, 
add three well-beaten egg yolks, a gill of cold water, 
and enough flour to make a rather thin batter alter- 
nately with the stiffened whites of the eggs. Last 
of all, stir in lightly a cup of chopped hickory-nut 
kernels, plentifully dredged with flour. Bake in 
small round tins. When cold, ice, and place half 
of a nut on the top of each cake while the icing is 
still soft. 

MARSHMALLOW CAKES 

Cream a cup of butter with two cups of powdered 
sugar, add a small cup of sweet milk, and the stiff- 
ened whites of five eggs alternately with a scant 
quart of prepared flour. Bake in a large square 
card, as directed in the recipe for chocolate cakes. 
When cold, cut the cake into squares. Spread half 
of them with a marshmallow filling and put the 
other squares on top of these. Press the upper and 
lower halves closely together. 

MACAROONS 

For this you will need six ounces of almond paste, 
a cup and a half of powdered sugar and the whites 
of two eggs. Beat the whites to a stiff froth, add 



200 " LIKE MOTHER USED TO MAKE " 

the almond paste chopped fine and the sugar, make 
the mixture into balls with the fingers and bake on 
greased paper laid in pans. The oven should be of 
moderate heat. They should brown delicately and 
may then be ^aken from the oven, though they 
should not be removed from the pan until they are 
entirely cold. 

JUMBLES 

These are excellent to make at the same time with 
the macaroons. They require half a cup of butter, 
a heaping cup of flour, three-quarters of a cup of 
sugar, the yolks of two eggs, two tablespoonfuls 
of sherry, and flavoring extract to taste, — lemon, 
rose or vanilla. Cream the butter and sugar, mix 
with the beaten yolks, add the flour, the flavoring 
and make into small balls with the fingers. Lay 
them on buttered paper in a tin, putting them far 
enough apart to allow for their melting and spread- 
ing. A blanched almond or a raisin may be laid 
on top of each and they should be baked to a pale 
yellow, — >not until they brown. Take them from 
the paper while still warm, before they become brit- 
tle in cooling.
