We may live without poetry, music and art. 
We may live without conscience, we may live without heart. 
We may live without friends, we may live without books. 
But civilized man cannot live without cooks. 

He may live without books, what is knowledge but grieving? 
He may live without hope, what is hope but deceiving? 
He may live without love, what is passion but pining? 
But where is the man who can live without dining?

TRY THIS GREEN SOUP ONCE 

Try this green soup once, then use your own ingenuity with other 
proportions. Even the children will learn to like spinach and other 
green vegetables which are so important in the daily diet: 

For five servings take 2 or 3 leaves of Swiss chard or a small hand- 
ful of spinach, 1 stalk of celery, 1 small onion, 1 strip of bacon, 1 
or 2 of the tender leaves of beets and turnips and a bit of parsley. Put 
all through the meat grinder, juice and all. Add enough water to make 
five servings. Cook thirty minutes or until onion is cooked. Season with 
salt and paprika and *4 cup cream or milk if desired. Any of the green 
leaves with celery, onion and tomato make a good combination.

POINTERS ON COFFEE 
And How to Make It 

Compiled from information developed in experimental work at the 
Coffee Research department at the Massachusetts Institute of Technol- 
ogy. So many different elements are a part of "A Choice Cup of Cof- 
fee." It is worth while to mention a few of the most essential. 

Cheap or low priced Coffee is always of the inferior grades, and is 
expensive at any price. 

Be sure the coffee you buy has been verv recently roasted, and de- 
mand of your dealer that it be fresh ground or steel cut, for as soon as 
the coffee bean is broken it begins to lose all the Good qualities coffee 
possesses. Never guess. Measure or weigh. Never allow coffee to 
boil. Use coffee grounds but once. Use a porcelain lined vessel when 
possible; never one, however, when enamel is cracked or broken, for 
coffee coming in contact with most metals will have a metal taste. 

Making Coffee in One Gallon Units 

There are 16 average size cups to the gallon of liquid. In measur- 
ing the water allow 1 cup to the gallon for evaporation. In each gallon 
of water use 7 ounces, of coffee tjround reasonably fine. Place your 
coffee in muslin bag which must be large enough to allow free circu- 
lation of water through the coffee. When water in vessel comes to 
brisk boiling point move to back of stove where boiling ceases, but 
keep hot Insert your bag of coffee and keep submerged and stirring 
for at least 3 minutes. You can tell by color and taste when you have 
the desired strength, remove your bag of grounds from the vessel. Your 
coffee is made. Keep it hot. If you wish to serve a hundred cups, 
base your figures on the above proportions. 

CAUTION — If you see you are running short, make a fresh batqh. 
Never add more water if you wish to maintain your reputation as a good 
coffee maker.
