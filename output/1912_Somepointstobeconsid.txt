Some Points to be Considered in the Planning 
of a Rational Diet 

The rise ill the c<»sl of living lias made ihe cost of food 
of \ ilal concern to iiiosi" of ns, and the nnnicroiis dietetic 
cults liJiAi' set IIS llii iil\iiiii nloilir tile line (d' die! in I'elnlion 
t(. health. 

We \vant to he elUcient hiiinaii l),eini;s with strength 
and endnrance for tfie work liefore ns; hnt we do iKtt kno\\" 
\\ii;it Ivind oi' how imudi food is necessjii'y. and onr wonld- 
he ;id\isei's h(»ld siicli dilfei-eiit \ iews that it is diHicnll to 
make a clKMce. 

Horace I^df'tchei' tells ns that oiii' ])i'ohleLii will l)e sohcd 
if we chew oni' food thoi'onghly ; and it' we persist, in this 
prolonged niasiicalion. onr aj»pi'tiles will. e\-entnaih', he a 
snre guide to the l\i nd a iid amount of sustenance necessary. 
Ph' found, nil del- this regime, thai his diet was much reduced 
in amount and tended toward \'egetariaiiisiii. which result- 
ed in a great gain in jiliysical well-heing. 

Professor (Ihilteiiden (d' Yale, alter scientilic experi- 
ments on a large scale, tliinks that we ordinarily eat too 
niiicii, and especially too much jiroiein i the suhs I a nee repre- 
sented hy h'aii of meat, white of eggs, casein of milk and 
gluten (d' wheat). lie l)elie\'es that we overload the system 
with prcdein, and. i n conse(|uence. o\orwdrk the li\er and 
kidneys in order to eliminate the surplus. 

Pi'fd'essor Alwater «d' the rniied Stales Deparlment of 
Agriciilliire lv\|ierimeiit Slatimis has studied the dietaries 
of |)eople in iiiaiiN" parts of the country, and. as a result, 
ad\(tcatesa larger aiiKUinl of prcdein. and, also, a larger 
amount of food than l*r(d'essor ( Ihilleiiden. lie thinks that 
the eriicieiicy (d' the ,\inericaii people is due, in part, to this 
more I ihe rat diil. These three a lit ho ri lies agree in n<il elim- 
inating meal entirely from the diet, hut they disagree ill the 
aniounl that is healtlifnl to eat. 






Then conic Ihn iioii-meat paters or vpg(Mai'iaiis who, 
from ethical or physiological reasons op hoih, do not l)elieve 
in the use of meat. They contend ihat they liave strength 
and endiu'ance and freedom from disease. Some vegetari- 
ans allow the use of milk and eggs in the diet, lint others 
use no animal products. '^Piie more radical rfd'ormers snl)- 
sist on uncooked vegetables and fruits, while tlie fruitari- 
ans confine themselves to fruit and nuts. Whom shall we 
follow? 

Until authorities can agree it may he W'ise to take a 
middle course rather than to try extremes. By careful ol)- 
servation, each one can decide, to some extent, for hims(df, 
how much and wliat kind of food keeps him in good condi- 
tion for his particular kind of work. 

We may be somewhat bewildered by the contentions (d' 
the meat eaters, the non-meat eaters, the chewers, and the 
raw food advocates; bnt fortunately we have some land- 
marks in the wilderness. \>'e know that we need food for 
energy in proportion to the amount of muscular work that 
we perform. This has been worked out by accurate scien- 
tific experiment. 

As a basis for calculation we take the anion nt of energy 
necessary to maintain a man who is lying in bed. Under 
these circumstances energy is needed for the internal work 
of the body, such as digestifui, assimilation, circulation of 
the blood, and respiration. 

Using a calorie* as tlie nnit for ineasinMiig energy, we 
may say that a man lying (luietiy in bed needs abmit 20(10 
to 2100 calories (d" energy : staying in doors 2200 to 2300 y 
light work 2500 to 27<>0; moderate work 28O0 to 3200; 
severe work 4000 to (iOOo. These are average figures and, 
of course, would vary with different individuals. The 
larger the man tlie more calories he needs so it is more ac- 
curate to give the calories per kilogram (i kihtgram = 2.2 
lbs.) (tr per pound of body weight. A man of average 
w'eighl is supposed to weigh To kilograms or b'S4 j)f)unds. 



* A calorie is the amount of heat necessary to raise the temperature of one kilo- 
frram of water 1^ Centigrade or approximately the amount of heat necessary to raise the 
temperature of one pint of water V Fahrenheit. 



Taking these fads inio accounl Ihc tolli>winii lal)le may be 



considered a|tproxiinalelj correcl .

"" An ins|»i'clion of the tables shows tliat tlic protein in-

opinion as lo Ihe ainoiinl necessary lo keep the body in 
good Condi I ion. 

Langworthy. in (Urcular 111) of the United States Office 
of ExperimenI Slations. gives KJO grams (3.5 ounces j for 
a man at moderate exercis(\ The menus in Table V give 
ap])roxiniatel\- thisamouni of ]>rotein. 

Professor (^liitlendi-u would reduce the amounl of pro- 
tein ordinarily eaten l)y (Uie-half to one-third and others 
would reduce il still liu'tlier. We may well queslion Ihe ad- 
visability of reducing Ihe j)rotein in our diet in sucli a 
wliolesale fashion until further and more prolonged experi- 
ments are made to prove its Ijenelicial effects. Nature does 
not deal witli minimum auiounts. but in her workings 
leaves a large margin of saf^-ly. The body may be able to 
exist on a mininumi amount of |iroteiii. j)ul is themininnnn 
the opiinunii? 

Age. also, has au iiiqioriaut l)earing on the amount and 
kind of food that is necessary. 

Children alvs'ays seem to l)e hungry:' but tliis is not 
suri)rising when we relied that a cliild needs food for ac- 
tivity, for growth, and for rej)air. From whatever stand- 
point we look at till' sid)ject the child should have a gener- 
ous amount of food. 

Compared \\\\\\ the adidt it needs juore food |ter jionnd 
of body weight, and. also more per square foot of surface.

The child not only needs more food per pound of ])ody 
weight than Ihe adidt, hut it needs more protein, which in 
young children should l)e given largely in Ihe form of 
milk and eggs. (Ireat care shoidd l)e used in the selection 
of digest ilile food, and as an aid in making a selection Dr. 
Holt's forhiddcn list is given helow. These foods are for- 
hidden for children under four, and usually for those 
uiKkn* ten. 

Forhidden list from "The Care and Feeding of Child- 
ren" hy Dr. H(.lt: 

"Ham, bacilli, sausage, poi-k, livei\ kidney, game and all dried 
and saltful meals, also, cod, mackerel and halil»ut; all these are best 
withheld until the child has passed the tentli year. 

■'Haw veuclables should not be eaten: su(di as celery, radishes, 
"nions; cucumbers, tomatoes or lettuce. Certain others, even when 
well cooked, should not be allow'ed; as, corn, lima beans, cabbage 
and egg plant."

besel by various ills that could be avoided by an inlclligenl 
supervision of our diet. 

Old people do not need a different kind of fo(Hl, but 
they certainly do need less: and if any change is niad^ in 
kind it should be toward simple, easily digested food, with 
a decrease in the amount of protein. 

Age and activity inlluence tlie amount and kind of food 
and they also, inthience the variety tliat we crave. 

The craving for variety is felt less by the young and Ijy 
people living out of doors. Here appetite is the best sauce. 
People leading sedentary lives demand varit^ty and are 
often considered "'fussy" in consequence, because it is not 
understood that if food is enjoyed it calls forth a more lib- 
eral tlow of the digestive juicfs of tlie mouth and stomach. 

This question of variety is often a puzzling one to the 
housekeeper especially if the market is poor; in this case, 
she is thrown back on variety in the preparation of a few 
food materials rather llian variety in the materials them- 
selves. 

Different methods of j)re])aring a few simple foods are 
well illuslrated by some work done by a class at the Univer- 
sity of Illinois. These students were given four simple 
foods, beef, potatoes, cabliage and apples. fi-om which to 
serve twelve meals wiliiout twice prej)aring the same food 
in the same manner.
