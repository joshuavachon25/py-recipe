This is a digital copy of a book that was preserved for generations on library shelves before it was carefully scanned by Google as part of a project 
to make the world's books discoverable online. 

It has survived long enough for the copyright to expire and the book to enter the public domain. A public domain book is one that was never subject 
to copyright or whose legal copyright term has expired. Whether a book is in the public domain may vary country to country. Public domain books 
are our gateways to the past, representing a wealth of history, culture and knowledge that's often difficult to discover. 

Marks, notations and other marginalia present in the original volume will appear in this file - a reminder of this book's long journey from the 
publisher to a library and finally to you. 

Usage guidelines 

Google is proud to partner with libraries to digitize public domain materials and make them widely accessible. Public domain books belong to the 
public and we are merely their custodians. Nevertheless, this work is expensive, so in order to keep providing this resource, we have taken steps to 
prevent abuse by commercial parties, including placing technical restrictions on automated querying. 

We also ask that you: 

+ Make non-commercial use of the files We designed Google Book Search for use by individuals, and we request that you use these files for 
personal, non-commercial purposes. 

+ Refrain from automated querying Do not send automated queries of any sort to Google's system: If you are conducting research on machine 
translation, optical character recognition or other areas where access to a large amount of text is helpful, please contact us. We encourage the 
use of public domain materials for these purposes and may be able to help. 

+ Maintain attribution The Google "watermark" you see on each file is essential for informing people about this project and helping them find 
additional materials through Google Book Search. Please do not remove it. 

+ Keep it legal Whatever your use, remember that you are responsible for ensuring that what you are doing is legal. Do not assume that just 
because we believe a book is in the public domain for users in the United States, that the work is also in the public domain for users in other 
countries. Whether a book is still in copyright varies from country to country, and we can't offer guidance on whether any specific use of 
any specific book is allowed. Please do not assume that a book's appearance in Google Book Search means it can be used in any manner 
anywhere in the world. Copyright infringement liability can be quite severe.

in the mortar with the craw-fish. When properly. pounded, 
sift all together ip a lawn sieve, or a cloth strainer with ex-

OF BEEF. 

All sorts of beef meat must be chosen of a fine red, or 
rather of a crimson colour, and well interlarded with fat. 
The parts used in cookery are the brains, palates, tongue, 
tripe, suet, and udder; the whole lef cut in different man-, 
ners; the marrow, die rump, aitch*Done, surloip, and the 
fillet ; the tail, ribs and breast, flank and veiny pieces, &c. 
The brains, tripe, pdates, and suet mint be used fresh ; abo 
such pieces as are used for broth and gravy ; the rest require 
to be kept some time. Most pieces of beef, either boiled 
or roasted, should be cut across die grain, ae it will alvrays 
eat tenderest. The head riiould be stewed to be eaten with 
a spoon, and requires a great deal of care and attention in 
tleaning.

Obon veal oi^t to be very white and fat; I shall not 
take upon me to give directions for cutting up calves, as the 
Rench audior does, as I am very sensible that all sorts of 
meat are cut to greater advantage in England than in France; 
and the French butchers are even so sensible of it, that I have 
myself known several of them come from Parjus on purpose 
to attend the cutting of meat at St. James's market, and 
•diers, for ins^c^on. 

Tite de Veau d la Bourgeoise.

die skull, and serve it quite hot with vin^ar, pepper, salt, 
and chopped parsley, in a boat.

good savoy, about half an hour ; take it up, and press the 
water out' of it ; cut it in quarters, tie it, and braze all 
together in brodi, slices of lard, spices, and herbs, as in all 
other brazes. When done take diem out, and clean all free 
from fat ; serve upon them a good thick cuUis. If you 
would have the cabbage ms saner crauty add vinegar. — Calves 
tails brazed are very good dressed to any savce^ also to use as 
a hodgepodge. 

Queues de Veau diversi/ih. 
Calves' Tails of different Fashions. 

Always scald them first; if you would serve them in 
fricandeaux, lard them and braze diem as the former; if 
without larding, serve them with different sauces or ragout, 
fried or broiM, with any sharp sauce in a boat. 

For brevity sake I shall avoid giving a repetition of Queues 
de Veau au Gratia, and Farcies, as the direction is already 
given in different places. — ^All sorts of insipid things are to 
be brazed iti white bnons, which are call^ so by putting 
slices of lemon therein, as it lia» the power of keepmg the 
brazed meat very white, at the same time that it gives an 
agreeable sharpness to the dish ; yet' very little of it must be 
used when the braze is to serve for sauce, after being M^ell 
skimmed and sifted. 

* Rissolles are made of any sorts of meat, lbllo«iBgitenBie'4lMCtsM»; 
cither with forced-meat or not.

Da COCIION. 
Of HOGS and PIGS. 

De la Connoissance et Dissection du Cochon. 
Haw to chuse Hog's Meat, and cut it up. 

Hog's meat ought to be hard and of a finft-blocnniiig eolovr, 
without any bad smell occasioned by heait; that which is 
soft and of a pale red is not good; neither is it wholew^rae 
when small white spots appear in the flesh. Pigs- of six or 
«ight months old, are fit for pickled pork, or to r<Mist; those 
of a year or fifteen months, are better to make bacon : suck* 
log pigs should be aboyt three weeks old, and are to be 
taken from tiie suck for use. All the meat employed for 
sausages or puddings, ought to be used directly, the gvts 
particularly, as by keepmg they ane apt to heat, and to burst. 
The dissection of the ume is to be cut close to the ears quite 
throiigh ; the neck serves for haselets; and the ham is^ always 
cut into tliin slices for eating, mixing fat and lean. The 
wild boar is cut the same way as die hog, and the M^rcttssin 
(or sucking wild boar) is dressed the same as the sucking pig. 

I shall pass over any further directions; as every country 
has^different ways of cutting; up all sorts of animals. A little 
attention to the pcaetice will be of more service than all the 
tlieory that can be given; and found very useful, more parti- 
cularly ia the eouutry.

Sudking Pig roasted. 

Stick die jng in the throat, as dcef) air the heart, that it 
may bleed well and die die sooner, as it makes it easier to

holding it by the hind legs; Miien you find the bristles 
coming off the tail by rubbing, take it out and rub it with 
« litde rosin, then hard with die hand; when it is well scalded 
wash it clean, and cut it open -while warm ; take all out ex- 
cept tlie kidnies, truss it with diree skewers,, one in the hind 
leg,' one in the fore, and dne in the .middle; put into it a 
iaggot of parsley, shallots; thyme^ laurel, pepper and salt, and 
wiper it very dry before spitting : cut the skin a little near the 
neck, and also near the rump, to hinder it from, brdakmg in 
roasting; when it begins to be warm, rub it all> o^er pretty 
often with oil, which will make the skin very crisp; take out 
the faggot when you serve it up. — ^The EngUsh method of 
stuffing it is with sage and onions, pepper and salt.

as many people do not like cream, adding, in like manner^ 
sweetbreads, and artichoke-bottoms, which should be half 
half done before mixing with the pigeons, as they requh-e

Oye diversifiSe. 
Goose different Ways. 

Cut a goose into quarters, (if the whole is too much for a 
dish, use only the legs and wings) braze them with slices of 
lard and broth, a glass of white wine, a few slices of onions 
and carrots, and all such seasoning as is used in other brazes : 
being done very tender in this manner, you may serve witli 
any sorts of garden-stuff ragouts, such as turiiips, ffreen 
peas, small onions, and cucumbers ; or with peas or lentil 
porridge in winter ; with ravigotte sauce, or any other, .ac« 
cording to taste. — If legs and wings of geese are dressed as a 
hodge-podge, they must be boiled widi all kinds of roots, and a 
few pieces of pickled pork, or bacon, without taking off 
the rind.

with shced lard, spices, and a facgot as usual ; when they 
are done, wipe them with a clean cloth ; clarify about a pint 
of good strong veal cuUis, by boiling it with three or four 
eggs bruised, with the shells; stir it now and then till it 
becomes clear, then strain it through a wet napkm ; taste the 
jelly lest it be too salt, and add a few drops of Tarragon 
vinegar. Dress the feet in a stew-pan or a deep dish, pour a 
sufficiency of the jelly over them to cover them completely, 
and let them cool. When you would send them to table, 
cut each stump handsomely with the Jelly belonging to it, 
and lay them properjy on die dish. — ^The same may be done 
of the stumps or p^Ues of any any other fowls.

called ItalUnne, as it is recoounended to be marinated in 
<nl, herbs, and spices, as usual, about an hour before brazing. 
Oil ought not to be much used in cookery in England, as it 
if seldom to be had so good as in Italy and Fran<;^, tlierefore 
butter should be used in its stead. 

Chamoices (from a stxiped Stuff so called.) 

Scald some spinage, press out the water as much as pos- 
aible, pound it, and men nf t it in a stamine or a fine sieve, 
without any liquid, to keep it very dry and green ; beat up 
iiree or four spoonsful of it with two whites of eggs ; rub 
a deep dish with a little butter, spread the spinage all over 
very thin, and put the dish on a slow fire, or on ashes, to make 
it cake ; then take it out with a skimmer, and cut it to what 
form you please. Take a stew-pan 9f the bigness of the table 
dish, garnish the bottom with diin slices of bacon, and upon 
these mtermix the spinage, cut as before directed, with cut 
truffles, and betw*een each small fillets of raw fowl, each 
being first dipped in whites of eggs to make them stick toge- 
ther, and over these spread a good farce very thinly. Have 
a good salpicon farce made with a sweet-bread cut into small 
dice, the white of poultry, mushrooms, and seasouiag : let 
this meat be first parboiled, and then give it a fry in butter, 
with a little flour, and a glass of white wine ; let it stew till ' 
the liquid is quite exhausted, add a little veal cullis, just suf- 
ficient to keep it together, put this upon the farce of the 
chamoice^ cover it over again with a little of the first-men- 
tioned farce, and afterwards cover the whole with thin shoes 
of lard and white paper ; let it simmer on a slow fire, both 
above and below it, for about a quarter of an hour, add a 
glass of white wine, and as much good restaurant ^ or cullis ; 
and when ready to serve, which will be in about a quarter of

Des Foyes gras. 
Of fat Livers. 

Fat liTers are of great utility in cookery; 'as to ganuA 
different sorts of ragout, to mix with forced-meat, for petit 
pates, to add to pies, and several other uses ; and may also 
De dressed in many different ways by themselves, lliey 
may be kept several days covered with fat, to hinder them 
from turning black ; and those of fowls and capons are the 
besty as diey are moister than those of turkies. — I shall n6t 
dwell long on the different virays of dressing fat livers, as. 
they are much dearer in England than in rrance ; and to 
make either pies or other dishes thereof, would be attended 
with much e^pence to very little purpose. It will be suffici- 
ent to observe, that they must be brazed with proper season- 
ing, to be served widi any sort of sauces or ragouts ; — ^half 
brazed for broiling, or in cowl, or au Gratin, to be sliced, 
and finished as all former directions under the same deno- 
mination; — also dressed in tureen, or matlot, with other 
meat ; and with all sorts of roots ;— such as have been served 
before, may be fried, wrapped up in forced-meat, and served 
again upon bits of fried bread ; — also minced and done in pa- 
per cases, properly seasoned, and moistened vnAi a little cui- 
us. — ^Although they are recqinmended often as part of a 
forced^neat, any others may be used in their stead, as all de- 
pends more on a good taste for seasoning, than die quality of* 
the meat used for any kind of farce. 



BE LA VENAISON OU VIANDE 
NOIR. 

OF VENISON, OR BROWN MEAT. 

What the French call black or brown meat, under the 
name of venison, (or Viande Noir) is the wild boar, and the 
young, called Marcauin; the red deer, its female the hind; 
buck and does; fawns and kids. 



THE PROFESSED COOK* 25^ 

Du Sqnglier ou Cochon Sauvage. 
Of Wild Boars, or Wild Hogs. . 

The female is more esteemed than the male, and both ar« 
'better when they keep together, and feed upon green com. 
The meat oudit to be kept long before it is used. The 
best part of the boar is the head, which is mostly brazed and 
served cold. The fore-quarter is larded, roasted, and served 
with a sharp sauce in a boat : the hind-quarter is dressed as 
it la Mode Beef, or D6be ; and also prepared as pickled 
pork. — ^Any furdier direc^on is of very kttle use in England^ 
as what we see here comes from abroad, which is seldom 
any thing *else but the head. The Germans are best ac- 

Suainted with their different qualities and uses, and make 
lose smoaked sausages of wild boar's flesh, which are much 
esteemed, both in England and other countries. 

Sanglier d la Datibe. 
Leg of Wild Boar dobed. 

. Lard it thoroughly with large pieces, seasoned with fine 
spices, chopped garlick, shallots, and parsley; put it into a 
brazing-pan mudi of its own bigness, widi slices of bacon^ 
thyme, laurel, basil, sliced onions, all sorts of roots, a large 
faggot of sweet herbs, cloves, whole pepper, and trimmings 
of any sort of meat; soak it about half an hour, then add 
two or three glasses of brandy, a pint of white wine and 
broth ; braze dowly for about seven or eight hours, then lei 
it cool in the braze ; skim the fat off, and serve the jelly with 
the meat. 

Hure de Sanglier d la Braise. 
Boar's Head braced. 

Scald the head over a charcoal fire to clean it, and scrape • 
it well with a knife ; then bone it as far as die eyes, without 
cutting the skin ; lard the inside as the leg in the last Re- 
ceipt, widi all the same seasoning ; tie it up in a coarse cloth^ 
and braze it at least six hours with all sorts of spices and 
roots, one lemon, three botdes of red wine, and one of water ; 
reduce the liquid to half, let it cool in the braze, and serve it

the doe is better than the buck; I presume it. is, from their 
being so little acquainted with the quality of either. The

Snipes with Truffles. 

This is done nmcb in the same manner as die last, only 
that popped truflks are added lo the forced-oiaat, which 
give the i^me of Per^ord to this and- all other dishes ^«nder 
the sam^ denomination; (Perigord being. a proirince 3o 
France, where trufiies are yery sood and in great abundance.) 
You may either rpast or l^»raze mm, and serve with a ragout 
of truffles, as directed in raj^out articles.— Those Perigard 
dishes are seldom prmared in England, where truffles are so 
very dear, and so different in flavour to foreign ones. It is 
much the same with Italian dishes, where oil is in the com- 
position; but, as excellent butler is to be had m England, 
at all times of the year, it may very well supply the want of 
gi^oil.i|ii cookery. Also those dishes under the denomi- 
nation .of .id /a. Proxiencs, ought to be done with caution, as 
thfi.piinCiipal flavour is garlick, which the inhabitants of Pro- 
iRen^. are panicidarly fond of.

Des Pluviers^ Vaneauiy et Grives. 
Of Plovers, Lapwings, and Thrushes. 

Thksb different kinds of birds are commonly eaten 
roasted, but they nwy nlaa he Amud in many different 
ways. I shall observe, in regard to thrushes, that they are 
much more valued in Fraaae dian.in Bnglsnd, and for a yery^ 
good reason, as they feed mostly upon grapes, which gives 
them a very agreeable flavour ; and it is only those which are 
esteemed : the common wood thrushes are the same as in 
England. 

Pluviers d la Ptrigwd^ 
Plovers with Truffles* 

Bbazb them with vea), ham, and truiBes, and all other 
proper seasoning, a glass of wine, and broth ; sift and skim 
the hra^e, and add a good lemon 8i|ueeze when ready to 
serve. — ^You may also roast th^m stuffed in the same manner 
as woodcocks, and serve with any sort of ragout. — ^Or you 
may serve ^m.au Gratin, making b forcednneat with the 
livers,. 8cc. as all other dishes under the same denomination ; 
braze the plovers, put them upon the Grqtin, and serve with 
a very good cuBis sauce. 

It is needless to say much about thrushes ; however^ they 
may be dressed in all the different ways of pigeons : a good 
aauce will make any thing veUshmg <and palataUa for the sake 
of change.

The French have another sort which they call MousseronSy 
nearly like the champignons; they are dressed much in the 
Mune vray when fresh; and when dried, and reduced to pow-

for large brazing pieces, having much the same flavour as 
allspice, when reduced to powder. — ^They are rather scarce

alone, or to mix vrith any thing else: flour and butter, ftied 

Srether, to give a colour to any sauce, is also called a Am- 
ki, viz. a browning. But as there are many diflerent ways 
of dressing rissolles, as well as other dishes, it may be necev- 
sary to give some particular direction about them. - 

A Rissollet a la Bechaind is thus prepared: soak a slice 
of ham, with a bit of butter, chopped parsley, shallots, and 
half a laurel-leaf; simmer these on a slow fire about a quar- 
' ter of an hour, then add a good spoonful of cullis, as much 
cream, and a little flour ami pepper; reduce the liquid till

Du ItOTI.et de la FACON de le preparer. 
Of ROAST, and how to prepare each KIND. 

Although it seems very easy to roast any kind of meat, 
nevertheless there is a certam point of roasting very necessaiy 
tp be observed, according to the quality of the meat, so that 
it may be served with its proper flavour and goodness. 
Laige pieces are only to be judged of by the time, or feeling 
under the finger, and are very forward when they begin to 
burst into small smoaking bladders; a little use vid proper 
attention will guide the youi^ Cook, m point of time, to die 
•greatest exactness, 

I will give directions for preparing Poultry and Game. 
As each season furnishes sonie things different, it will not be 
unnecessary to exhibit a few examples of what we can give 
for Roast, and of the choice of each season in the year.

De la Friparation de toidts Series de Rotis. 
Of the Preparation of all Sorts of Roast* 

Poultry ousht to be kept without food for five or m 
hours before killing ; pluck it directly after, and draw the 
guts, dien hang it up in a cool place; keep it as long as die 
weather will permit, and it will be tenderer and better 
tasted. — When you prepare it for use, b^n to draw by the 
gizzard ; thrusting one finger round to loosen the inside, so 
that it may come out easUy. Large puUards are opened at 
the side, and lesser ones at the end, as is usual in £ngland. 
Singe the poultry over the fire all round, and wipe it clean 
with a cloth ; ^en truss it properly, either for boiling or 
brazing, which is the same ; or for roasting, which is differ- 
ent. All sorts of roast should be done with a fire as equal, 
during the roasting, as it is possible to keep it, and finished 
of a fine pale-brown colour, except it is to be served with any 
sort of ragout ; then observe the several directions in Fowl 
Articles already given, lie fat livers which you draw 
should be rolled up in their awn fat, if you have no imme- 
diate occasion for using them. 

Wild Pigeons are roasted quite fresh out of the nest; 
when they are plucked and drawn, cut off the pinions, neck, 
and claws ; roll them up in vine-leaves, and a slice of bacon 
quite round ; when they are almost done, strew bread-crumbs 
over them, give them a good brown colour, and serve either 
with or without sauce. 

Tame Pigeons. Gut them as soon as killed, takeout the 
craw, and keep them some time before using. 

IVood-figeoiis, Thrushes, and Moor-htns are done the 
same. 

Turkey Poults are prepared in the same manner as fowk 
and chickens. 

Land) ought to be' kept some time, and roasted slowly, at 
all sucking meat ought to be ; die fore-quarter is the most 
esteemed, and of greater use for variety in cookery.

Des Oiseati^v de Riviere. 
Of Fresh-water Fowls. 

Wild and tame ducks, teals, &c. &c. All those kinds of 
fowls, when well plucked and drawn, should be trussed with 
the. legs undermost, and roasted without any thing: they 
require but a short time to be done, as they ought to 
be full of their own gravy, ^hich will waste if too much 
roasted. 

D€S Oi$eaux que fon sevt avec des R6tis

Of Birds, which are served with a Toad under 

them. 

Larks. They ought to be fat and fresh killed; you 
may lard or bard them, and roast them widi a toast under ; 
or roast them wrapped in vine-leaves and a slice of bacon, 
strewed with bread-crumbs, and served with the same. 

Quails are done in the same manner. 

Reals, Woodcocks^ and Snipes must be trussed with the 
legs undermost, the bUls serve for a skewer ; lard the .breast- 
part if agreeable, and roast them without drawing, with 
toasted bread under. 

Wheat^earsy when in full season, may be called the Ortf^- 
lam of Enj^nd, and may be dressed in the same manner as 
larks. 

Partridges are drawn like chickens, and ought to be 
spared in me basting, as too much of it will waste the fla- 
vour; singe them over a charcoal fire before roasting, larded 
or barded* The same observation is necessary in basting 
hares and rabbits, and all game of high flavour. — It is to be 
observed, that the female of poultry and game is in general 
more delicate than the male, and ought to be kept as long as 
posAble, for (he sake of tenderness and flavour.

Of Pike. 

Pikes caught in rivers and in dear water, are preferable 
in goodness to those taken in ponds, and the meat is sweeter 
and firmer ; the large ones will be tenderer by being kept 
sometime after they are dead. They are not esteemed much 
in England, nor any where else where sea-fish are plentiful, 
although they are valued, and their price sufiiciently enhanced 
in inland countries.

Des Lamprois. 
Of Lampreys. 

This fish is seldom to be had fresh in London, and but in 
few parts of England, which makes it almost unnecessary to 
give any instructidns about it : yet, for the sake of those who 
may meet with it fresh out of the water, I shall give a few 
Receipts, as one method of dressing any kipd of aliments 
may very properly be made use of for others. Lampreys are 
best in the spring ; they resemble an eel pretty much in Co- 
lour, yet are thicker and shorter in size ; they ought to be 
fat, and the male is preferable in flavour.

then cut the head off, and divide the fish into three or four 
pieces : make a roux with butter and flour, and half white 
wine and broth ; put to it one dozen of small onions scalded, 
a faggot of all sorts of sweet herbs, whole pepper and salt ; 
boil this until the onions are almost done, then put the fish 
therein, and stew gently : when done, add the blood, two or 
three green shallots bruised, a little vinegar, and waim it 
without boiling; take out the faggot when ready to serve.

but as it has found place in the Cookery of a Nation, so 
much imitated in tnis respect, as well as in many others ; 
ai|d injustice to my undertaking as a translator, I shall only 
say, that the kind of frogs here meant, are those found in the 
Spring, in spawipng time ; also in some parts, those found 
in corn-fields in harvest time. The legs only, cut off at the 
JTump, am used, after they are skinned and scalded in boiling 
water. T^y are dressed as chicken fricassee, or marinated 
and fried, as all other fritures, and might pass as such, as 
^eli as die rabbits en pouleitf often used in very polite

when ready to serve, wipe your dish clean, and squeeze half a

Des CarletSy FlieSy et Halibotte. 
Of Flounders, Plaice, and Hallibut. 

The hallibut is a large flat fish, much resembling a tur- 
^ bot, but nothing in comparison so good eating ; it may be 

dressed in all the different ways of turbot. 
^ ' Plaice may abo be dressed the same, at least what are 

commonly called in England Dutch plaice, as they are much 
larger, and very- good when quite fresh, firm, and not spent 
by long keeping, which may soon be distinguished by the 
hardness of the fleshy part ; but when watery streaks appear 
through the skin, they are stale. 

I'he CarletSf viz. flounders, are esteemed by most peofJe 
to b^ better fish than plaice ; they ought to be chosen by the 
same rules, and they may be distinguished from the plaice by 
having less spots, smaller, and more of a yellow cast.-r-It i^

a general remark ia flat fish, viz. turbott, hallibuts, flonnders, 
soalsy plaice, &c. that if the middle bone appear any thing 
black, the fish is not fresh ; I beiieye this is not an absolute 
decision, as will appear to those who will be at the trouble 
of observation : I shall only add, in regard to these flat fish, 
that the middle-sized of every sort geperally prove the best 
eating.

Filets de Soles an Verjus. 
Fillets of Soals, Verjuice Sauce. 

Take up the fillets as the prececBng; rub the table diah 
with butter^and lay them thereon, with a little cullis, tift^o or 
three spoonsful of verjuice, (where verjuice is not to be had, 
use vinegar, to give it a proportionable sourness) pepper, 
salt, and s^ieet herbs chopped vei^ fine ; simmer about Isalf 
an hour, and serve quite hot. \ou may also serve tfae8» 
sorts of fillets with auy kind of stewed greens, as sorrel, 
dive, celery, &c. ; warm the fillets in a little broth, and 
upon the ragout. 

Solei a la SainU Menehoult, i la Braze, are done in the 
same manner as all former directions: it is needlesv to 
crowd too many repetitions, having been sufficiently prolix 
already. 

De VAlose. 
Of Shad-Fish. 

This fish is not common in England, at least in the Lon- 
don markets ; however, where it is to be had, it may be 
dressed in all the different ways of salmon, or any other kind 
of fish. 

Dela Vive. 
1 Of the Fish> called Weaver. 

This fish is not esteemed in England, nor is it very comr 
* men ; the scarcity may probably be a reason for its pot being 

. in repute amongst good fish, as so few people ever eat it : 

the l*rench author gives it the following character : 

La Vive is one of the most excellent of sea fish, (givmg it 
the feminine- gender); she has sharp points at the ears, and 
on the back, -which prove venomous to such as are pricked 
by them; whenever this happens, take out the liver, and 
bruise it, to apply to the wound ; or salt and onions mixed 
toeetber ; or apply spirits of wine, as another remedy. 

I shall pass over any oarticular directions about ^ fish, 
for the same reason as t h^ye obseryod before, only giving

These three are all the same fish, only differently pre- 

1>ared : the Cabiliot is the fresh cod; the Mor&e^ die barrel- 
ed ; and the Merluche is the dried, and afterwards soaked 
cod : the French audior says, that the best they have is that 
which IS brought from Newfoundland ; they have also some 
from Holland, which is of a very fine white colour, yet is apt 
to be tough. The Cabiliot is the large cod; they also call 
tlie codling Moruefraiche, viz. small cod. 

Merluche d differentes Sauces. 
Dried Cod, or Stock Fish, to different Sauces. 

Beat it well first with a wooden billet, upon a wooden 
block ; soak it in water, with green wood-ashes, about twenty- 
four hours, changing both two or three times ; th^i wash it 
in several waters to get the aslies out, and boil it in water 
until you find it grow tender ; take it out, drain it, and break 
it in ileaks : make a sauce with butter aiid flour, one clove of 
garlick pounded, sweet herbs chopped very fine, and add 
cream suflScient to make a good liaison ; put the Merluche 
to warm in it, without boiling ; add one or two spoonsful of 
good oil, and a lemon squeeze : stir it constantly, till the oil is 
well incorporated with the rest, and serve quite hot. lliis 
may be served in a puff paste crust, and then it is called Pff^c

The Frencli reckon the thornback scate the best; they 
have the smooth, which they call Turhotie^ from its likeness 
to the turbot; and la liaie Auge^ which I take to be what are 
called Maids in England. Observing that scate mostly eats 
tpugh when dressed very fresh, the author says, that in sea- 
ports where it is to be had quite fresh, they put a piece of 
broken glass bottle into tlie. water with the fish to boil, which

. Prepare the scate as directed for marinating, and Aai 
fry it: make a sauce with a bit of the liver bruised, and 
boiled a moment with two glasses of white wine, one cr two 
spoonsful of cullis, chopped parsley, green shallots, pepper, 
salt, and nutmeg; add a good bit of butter, make a liaison 
and serve it upon the fish* 

Rate i la Burgogne is done after the same manner, only 
using red wine instead of white, and the fish being plain 
boiled.*

DE LA PATISSERIE. 
OF PASTRY. 

For a common crust to send abroad, or to keep long, ac- 
cording to the bigness of the pie you intend, make the paste 
with common flour, a little butter, salt, and warm water. — 
This crust is not proposed for eating, but to keep the inside 
properly. 

PAte bri$s6e. 
Puff Paste. 

Paste for raised crust is made firmer, by using more 
flour and less butter; it is done with warm water: let it rest 
some time, then raise it upon paper for pufi^-paste. Use 
about a pound of butter to a quarter of a pound of fine flour, 
some salt, and cold water to work it. 

FdtefeuilleUeJ^ 
Rich Puff-paste. 

Mix some fine flour with cold water, salt, and one or two 
e^; the paste ought to be as soft as die butter it is made 
with. In winter soften the butter by squeezing it in your 
hands; in summer, ice it. Put butter according to jud^r- 
ment, to make it very rich, and work it vrtth a rollin^-pm 
several times, folding it in three or four folds eadi time.— 
\J9% it to any kind of pies, or small cakes. 

tions under thig head,, as few other methods are adopted in En^^d, be- 
fides boiling, fnrin^^ and broiling, and these all served with much the 
sase sauces. Yet it most be remembered that this book was compiled 
upon the principles of cooking in Paris, where they have not sea fish so 
fresh, and are obliged to dress it in many different ways, on account of 
the multipltci^ of their fast-days, when no meat is used, and a number of 
dishes is required. My greatest motive for translating so many of these 
receipts, was rather to give information than improvement ; however, they 
are not all void of merit ; and I believe there are few books containing 
such a number of receipts of etery kind that are not more abundant in 
superfluities. 

• The meaning of FeuiUeidi, is when the crust breaks short in thin 
leaves or scales, after it is baked, occasioned by the richness of it. /

sauce in it. 

Toiirte de Lapreavux. 
Tourte of Rabbits. 

Cut them in pieces, and scald them a quarter of an hour

more of game : make a farce of the livers with lard, and good 
seasoning, and place it at the bottom of the pie; make a

stewed whole for some time,* 



Tourte de Godiveaux. 
A raw Forced-meat Tourte. 

I HAVE already given an explanation of the word Godi- 
veaux. As it is now to be used by itself, I shall still give a 
further account of it, to impress the true meaning the more 
strongly on the memory : it is made of any sort of raw meat, 
or several sorts mixed together; either to stuff any large bra- 
zing-pieces, or to use by itself : In the latter instance make it 
of fillet of veal chopped, with caltVudder scalded, raw breasts 
of poultry, beef suet, sweet herbs, pepper, salt, nutmeg, and 
two or three raw eggs; when well pounded, and seasoned, 
make it into balls, or in the form of sausages ; put this into 
the pie, and add (if you think proper) artichoke-bottoms, 
mushrooms, truffles, sweet-breads, &c. with some butter; 
finish as all the rest. 



Tourte de Tendrons de Veau. 
Touite of Veal Gristles. 

Cut the gristle of a breast of veal into middling pieces, 
and scald diem in boiling water some time; put some 
scraped lard and butter into the bottom of the Tourte, and 
the veal upon it, seasoned with pepper, salt, whole mushrooms, 
a few slices of ham, two slices of peeled lemon, a faggot of 
sweet herbs, and slices of lard over all ; bake it about an 
hour : when done, take out the lard, ham, faggot, and mush* 
rooms, or leave the last; skim it very clean; pour a cuUis d 
la Reine, or Sauce a la Crime on it. If you would serv^ it 
with brown sauce, make a good relishing cuUis. 

* At theitp tourtes, or paff-paite pies, may appear at tbe fint ti^t to 
be a m^re recapitulation of the Pftt^s, only made in a different cnut, 
please to observe, that, as the Timries are to be served hot, the seasoning 
18 not so high, and that the different kinds used are to be of young mbit; 
except, that old game, or poultry, are used for P^^t, vie* raited (fust 
pies.

Des petiis PdtSs de Godiveavx. 
Forced-Meat Petty Patties. 

Make a farce as directed for Pa/c rfe God/retftt.r, only

puft'-paste ; cut it to the bigness of the patty moulds, fill them

paste in the form of short thick sausages, and cut some of 
the paste length-ways; roll it in the form of a small rope to 
twist round it according to fancy, and finish it as the former. 
Iliese differences are proper upon a large table, where two 
dishes of the same preparation are served, and shew the in- 
genuity of tlie workman. 

Petits PiJtth a la Reifie. 
Queen Patties. (From the Sauce so called.) 

Use the sort of .paste as for the two former, and rub Uie

moulds witb butter before you put the paste thcFein ; bake 
them in a pretty quick oven to make the paste rise better : if 
you fear their taking too much colour, put a sheet of paper 
over. Take minced breasts of roasted chickens, fowls, or 
turkey, hare, partridges, or any thing else, and make them re- 
lishing with cream or cuUis, accordingly as you would have 
them white or brown, and pour it in the patties when you 
are Just ready to serve. When the farce is prepared with 
cullis, it is commonly baked in the crust, and the cuUia 
poured in after they are baked. Tliis last is called Pelits 
Path au Jus, viz. gravy or cullis : both arc the essence of 
meat. Petits Path d la Bichainel are much the same as 
a la Reine ; they are called after the name of the sauces, 
which only differ in some very triHing alterations. See sauce 
a la Reifie, and BichameL 

Petits Pdth au Pontife. 

From the Sauce. (See the Sauce Articles.) 

Petty Patties, with Pontiff Sauce. 

Make a raised paste, and prepare a little farce with 
breasts of roasted poultiy, or the remainder of sweetbreads, 
chopped sweet herbs, and proper seasoning ; put this into 
the bottom of the patties, with fat livers, and sliced truffles 
upon it, a little scraped lard, and then tlie same farce over 
all ; bake these sorts of patties a pretty good while : when 
done, make a little hole at the top, to pour in a sauce au 
Pontife. — You may make Petits Pates dressi, viz. raised crust, 
with any sort of meat, either minced or cut into thhi slices: 
it is the sauce you a.dd to it that gives the name. — In regard to 
mushrooms, truffles, morels, asparagus, or any kind of greens, 
you may make patties of them also \ but these are called by 
the substance, and not the sauce you add thereto ; for it is 
mostly either with cream- or cullis, with proper seasoning, ac- 
cording as the quality of the thing used may require. 

I shall give no further directions, but only add the names 
by which patties are served, hoping the former explanation 
sufficient, without crowding more repetitions ; but as people 
unacquainted with the names, are anxious to know wbether 
any thing particular is meant, more than has been given al- 
ready, and to make all familiar with bills of fare (as great 
merit is often put upon their not being understood) they are 
as follows:

without stoning) ; put this iQto finch pufiT-paste, and p^ts of 

1>a8te upon it^ cut and laid according to fancy : it requires no 
onger tune to bake^ than is necessary for the paste to be done 
of a good colour. — ^This and other sorts are also done in 
paste as directed for Demi-fei/iilletafe; but then the fruit is 
put in raw, and sugar added according to judgment. — Raise a

Tart of Strawberries and Ice Cream. 

Make an almond paste as directed in page 357; put it 
into a baking-d^sh, and raise a border as to ^ny other sort of 
paste ; it requires but a short time to bake, and very little 
neat : just before you are ready to serve, put ice cream into 
it, not very hard, and then the strawberries. This ice cream 
is made with a pint of good cr^am, and sugar sufficient to 
make it pretty sweet, a little orange-flower water, and two 
yolks of eggs ; put it on th^ fire till it is ready to boil ; stir it 
to mix the eggs veiy well, and when it is cold,^ut it into a 
mould to ice, as shall be explained in ice cream articles : 
you may also boil pistachio nuts in this cream, and sift it be- 
fore icing. 

Tourte d'Ahricotn, 
Apricot y^xt. 

Cut each in two, and break the stones to get at the ker- 
nels ; if the fruit is not ripe enough, boil them a little while 
in water ; then drain them very well, and put them into the 
paste, with sugar according to judgment, a few bits of pre^ 
served lemon, and half a kernel upon each piece ; cover it

almond biscuits, called macaroni drops, bruised to powder, 
a little lemcm peel mioced very fine, a bit-of butter, two 
yolks of ^gs, a little of the orange flower dried and pounded, 
or a few drops of orange flower water : use the best sort of 
paste, viz. au Feuilletage, or Zephir; put the cream into it, 
and a few bars of paste over^ laid according to fancy, or cut 
in flowers ; sugar it over to give a glaze, and serve coM, 

^ Tourte d, la Mdile. 
Marrow Tart. 

Take a cream as the preceding, but, instead of butter, use 
beef marrow melted and sifted in a sieve, and four whites of 
eggs well frothed ; put no cover of any sort upon it, only a 
good high border round the edge ; when it is baked, strew 
some powder sugar over, and glaze it with the salamander. 

Tourte d'Amandes, 
Almond Tart. 

It is done as the Italian Franchipane, putting a good 
many pounded sweet almonds into the cream, and a few 
bitter ones with them. 

Tourte de Verjus. 
Tart of Verjuice Grapes, or any others. 

Stone the grapes, and scald them a moment in boiling 
water ; then drain them very well, and simmer a little in a 
rich syrup ; when this is cold, put it into the paste without 
coveruig ; glaze die border of die tart with sugar.

Tourte de Muscat. 
Tart of Muscado, or sweet Grapes.

oepting that the sweet grapes are not scalded, nor so much 
sugar or [^rup put to them. 

/ Tourte de Pistache, 
Tart of iPistachio Nuts. 

Mix flour of lice with three or four yolks of e^gs, orange 
flower dried and chopped, cream, and sugar ; boil it about 
half an hour, stirring continually ; then take it ofi^, and add a 
quarter of a pound of .pounded pbtachio nuts, and a bit of 
preserved citron ; finish it as usual : if you would have it 
iced, make it as directed for strawberries, putting the nuts 
upon the iced cream.* 

Tourte d la ChantillL 
Chafitilli^ a small Town near Paris. 

Put a little orange flower water into three pints of cream^ 
froth it like whites of eges, and take up the froth as it is raised ; 
when finished, add a litUe rasped l^mon peel, and sugar pow- 
der, at discretion : ice it a little, and serve in an almond 
cnist. 

Tourte de Pommes. 
Apple Tart. 

Peel the apples, clean out the kernels, and boil them to 
a marmalade, with a few drops of water, a suflicient quan-. 
tity of sugar, a little cinnamon, and a lemon squeeze ; you 
may also add a bit of the riiM : when done, take out the le- 
mon peel and cinnamon ; use die Pdie de Feuilletage, cover 
it with the same, and glaze it with sugar.

Tourte de Prunes. 
Plum Tarts. 

The large kinds used for tarts must be split in two : put 
a good quantity of sugar, both under and over diem, and use 
the same paste as die last, with die top crust the same, and 
glaze it to give it a better look on the table. — ^In regard to 
glazing any sort of tarts, it is no further necessary thao 
agreeable, as many people like the crust without its being 
glazed. 

Tourtes d'Epinards. 
Spinage Tarts. 

Scald the spinage in boiling water, and drain it very wdl 
to chop ; then stew it in butter and cream, with a little salt, 
sugar, a few small bits of dried comfit citron, and a few drops 
of orange flower water ; use either the finest puff paste, or 
the second. 

Tourtes de Groseilles vertes. 
Green Gooseberry Tarts. 

You may either use them whole, or make a marmalade of 
them, with a good syrup : this last is recommended as the 
best method ; for by this means you can judge easily how 
sweet they are, and ought to be, to please ; for the marma- 
lade (if large), they ought to be stoned.

Croquante en Caramel^ 
Burnt Sugar Croquant. 

If you have no mould for the purpose^ take a round steir- 
pau^ according to the bigness you desire the croauante to be^ 
rub the outside with butter or oil ; warm it a little in the in* 
side, then rub it very clean ; when it is coM, rub it again all 
over widi a little butfer or oil, and keep it in a cool place. 
Boil a pound of sugar^ with two spoonsful of water, on a 
smart fire ; skim it well, but do not stir it tilt it begins to 
rope, which you will find by drawing it up with a knife, fork^ 
or skewer : if it ropes as it cools, drop it directly on the pre- 
pared pan, according to your fancy, taking care that it 
be not too heavy and thick, for it ought to be clear and 
transparent: when it is cold, put the pan for a minute 
over an ashes fire ; watch the moment that the oil or 
butter is warm, to take it otF, with both hands, from the 
lower part. — Observe, that the diah you intend to serve it 
upon be ready prepared, and put it upon it directly, for it is 
a great chance but you break it, if you handle it more than 
ouce ; SMod the same attention must be p^d to all croquantes, 
either of sugar or paste. — Croquantes made a day or two 
before using, must4ie kept in a warm place, otherwise they 
will tumble to pieces. 

Croquante de Fate d'Amandes.

Prepare the pan upon which you propose to make it as 
the former ; make the paste pretty supple, and easy for 
handling ; roU it pretty thin, cut it into flowers or birds, and 
so on, as you please, and place it accordingly : you must 
observe, tliat the pieces stick to one another by ropes and 
twists, or otherwise. Put it a moment in a very moderate 
oven, or it will do at a good distance from the fire, turning k 
round several times ; tiien take it off as the former, and if any 
part sticks to the pan, or breaks, ioiu it with sugar carameled* 
Vou may servejt in its natural colour, or glaze it with a whita 
frothed glaze, made of fine sifted sugar, beat up with whites 
of eggs, and a little lemon juice ; beat it up with a wooden 
spoon in an eartheit or cliina vessel, until it is very white, and 
use a light brush or feathers to spread it about the Cfoqurat;

then you may also garnish it with nonpareils : make the bot-

it should join together, bake them on a baking-^fate, and 
when ready to serve, garnish with currant jelly, apricot mar- 
malade, frothed cream, or any thing else.

VendangeVj signifying to gather in the Vin- 
tage. 

Make baskets upon proper moulds, prepared as directed 
fat eroquantes ; it is recommended to be done with almond 
paste, as being the most delicate ; but may be naade with all 
^o/tts of firm paste, for the almond paste is extremely short, 
and consequently apt to break ; cut the paste into long nar- 
row tape, and make it either flat or twisted: after the bas- 
kets are done, join the handles with sugar caramel ; giv<e them 
what colour you please with a pencil, and the different co- 
lours used in cookery, and place what fruits or sweetmeats 
yoir please in them.

any sort, cover them, and serve them in the baskets. You 
may ft>rni this paste to what shape you please, and colour it 
according to what you propose to represent; one's own 
imagination in this is the best rule ; it may be made in the 
form of fruits, snuff-boxes, or any thing else; and may be 
served for second-course dishes in its natural colour, or for a 
dessert, if painted. These small dishes, although of no con- 
sequence of themselves, shew the ingenuity and delight the 
workman takes in his business, as those things require a good 
deal of time and care.

with thread, and place them in the sun, or upon sieves, or 
any thing ^se in the oven, after the bread is ta^ken out, and 
keep ihem afterwards in a dry place: when you want to uae 
them, soak them in warm water till they become swelled. — 
Those that you would pickle or preserve, must be put into a 
brine made of three-parts water, to one of vinegar, a good 
deal of salt, and several cloves; make brme enough to cover 
them over, and pour a good quantity of oil upon them, which 
will always keep out the air, and tie a bladder of leather over 
them : by this means, any body may have green kidney-beans 
at all seasons of the year. — Use the same method as with the 
dried, when you want to dress them.

Lentilles FricassSs. 
Fricasee of Lentils. 

This dish is meant to be prepared with Fresh lentils, 
which cannot be easily obtained in England (the fresh ones 
are broueht from abroad,) although cultivated in several part& 
of this i»aud. 

I hope I shall not be thought partial, by the notice already 
taken; but, without prejudice to several shop-keepers, and 
corn-chandlers, who, for the sake of a little more gain, will 
impose some of English growth for foreign, which are most- 
ly sold at the Italian shops, much larger, and of better colour 
and taste, the hint becomes necessary. Prepare sliced onions, 
as in the last for beans, and put the lentils ready boiled and 
drained thereto, with broth, butter, pepper, salt, and a sprig 
of savory, which you take out before you serve; reduce the 
sauce of a good consistence, and add a little vinegar when 
Just ready. — lliey are done in Ragout the same as the white 
beans, widi cullis, gravy, and proper seasoning. — It is mostly 
the colour that distinguishes between the name of ragout and 
fricasee; the first being made brown with cullis, the last 
virhite, with cream, &c. &c. 

Choux Brocolis, 
Brocoli, white or green. 

The stringy rind ought to be well picked, and the stem or 
heart, and head-tops only used; boil them in plain water, and 
a little salt; drain, and lay them properly on the table-dish, 
and serve what sauce you please upon them, as cuUis, or ver- 
juice, or white sauce. 

ChoiLV Rave. 

It is of the Italian Growth, called in common, 
Turnip Cabbage. 

Peel them as turnips, braze them tender; and cut them 
into pieces of what bigness you think proper: serve witli a 
white sauce, or a good cullis sauce as the common cabbages. 
Being of a flat taste of themselves, either of the sauces must 
be pretty relishing. 



454 TBB PftOFKSSBO COOK. 

Choux Rouge. 
Red Cabbages. 

They are mostly stewed to eat with ham, bacon, or 
smoked sausages ; though sometimes without any meat : they 
are very strong eating, and should be first scalded, then 
stewed with butter, pepper, salt, and cloves ; and vin^ar 
added to it just before serving : they are reckoned whdeaoine 
in veal broth for consumptions ; but are most proper for 
pickling, as girkins, &c. &c. 

Choux farcis. 
Cabbage stuffed. 

The savoy kind is the best: cut off the outside leaves to 
the heart, and scald them in boiling water, about half ao 
hour; squeeze the water out, take up the leaves one by o«e, 
and wrap some good ready-made farce therein, three or four 
leaves double, and tie them round ; braze them in a l^t 
braze properly seasoned, with pepper, salt, cloves, and a 
little nutmeg (except there is some in the farce) : when tho- 
roughly done, drain them with a linen cloth, and serve a good 
relishing rich sauce thereon. You may also cut each half in 
two, and gambh any kind of brazed meat with them. 

Choux d la Flamande. 
Cabbages, Flemish Fashion. 

CvT a good large cabbage into quarters ; scald it in boil-

cut the stem quite out of each quarter, and chop it very fine ; 
put it into a stew-pan, with one or two slices of ham, some 
butter, and a little fresh hog's lard melted ; simmer it till it 
is quite mashed, stirring it often ; add some good consommi, 
with pepper and salt, if necessary : the sauce must be very 
thick, like a very strong liaison : toast a bit of bread as for a 
buttered toast, put it in the table-dish, pour the ngout upon 
it, and garnish round with fried or stewed sausages.

shallots, and a little melted lard ; take a scalded whole cab- 
bage as before, stuflF this farce between every two or three 
leaves, with all the seasoning, and tie it up round, like the 
cabbage, before boiling ; braze it with slices of lard, some 
good broth, and a glass of white wine : when done, wipe the 
fat off, and serve a Spanish sauce upon it. See page 37 • 

Choux d la Marechal. 
Cabbage in the Field GeneraFs Fashion. 

Cut about a pound of pickled pork mte middling pieces, 
and a large hard savoy into quarters ; scald both together 
about a quarter of an hour, then squeeze the cabbage, cut 
out the stem, and tie it up in quarters ; braze it in good 
broth, with a faggot of sweet herbs, a sprig of fennel, two 
or three cloves, as many whole shallots, a spoonful of oil, 
whole pepper, and a little salt: when done, sift it; skin^ 
part of the liquid, add a few spoonsful of cullis to it, and 
reduce it to a good consistence ; put the cabbage well wiped 
upon the table-dish, the pork upon it, and the sauce over 
all. Cabbages .brazed after this manner are used either for 
a dish alone, with a good jelly broth sauce, or to garnish 
any kind of meat, either butchery, poultry, or game. 

Choux h la Lymtwise. 
From Lyons, a City in France. 

The cabbage is prepared as the last, either whole, or cut 
into quarters, it is then stuffed with bits of sausages, and 
stewed chesnuts, brazed, and served with a good cullis sauce, 
or chesnut cullis. — ^This being a country abounding with' 
good chesnuts, they are often used with many other things.

Des Oignonsj Ailj Persily Cihouks^ Echahttes^ 
et Rocamboles. 

Of Onions, Garlick, Parsley, Chibbol, Shal- 
lots and Rocambole. 

Their utility in cookery is well known. Onions are in 
fuU use. Garlick is much discouraged, either by its tCK> 
predominant flavour, or the imprudence and carelessness of 
the workman, as has already been observed. Shallots are 
well known, and much used. Chibbol, or chive, may be 
called a diminutive of shallots, whether green or dried, the 
flavour being much less. And rocambole is much the same 
as chibbol: it is mostly used green, eidier in salad, or made 
dishes, the green tops being cut as parsley or garden-cresses, 
which spring out again; and its affinity to the two last mant- 
tioned has been my only reason for not taking notice of it in 
every receipt where it is directed as part of the composition: 
I am uncertain whether this may be the reason why it is not 
more cultivated in England. Parsley, for its great and ge- 
neral use, is known to the meanest capacity ; it ought to be 
used fresh gathered, as it is apt to foment in keeping: the 
root is as useful in broth, as the green is in the sauces. 

Oignons d Vltalienne. 
Onions, Italian Fashion. 

Take some good large onions when properly picked, 
scoop out the inside as much as possible, fill than with a 
good raw farce, and braze them with a few slices of lard and 
ham, a little broth, pepper, and salt; when done, drain them 
very well : serve Italian sauce upon thehi— Onions are also 
used as salad, being either brazed, or baked in the ovoi; 
the small ones are mostly brazed, the large baked, and then 
dressed like any other salad, with red beet-roots: the common 
English onions are rather too strong for this use, tfaeiefofe 
the Spanish or Dutch are better.

Large turnips, carrots, parsneps, and leeks, are boiled in

many sorts of dishes. Mavioles are small round racKsbes; 
they are commonly eaten raw, as salads as well as tbe com«

ting ribs as in cardoons : braze them in the same manner, and 
serve with the same kind of relishing sauce. — ^This sort of 
turnips is also very good to stew in their own juice, with a bit 
of butter, pepper, and salt. — ^The turnips are either cut into

quarters, or halves at least : boil them in water, widb a little 
butter rolled in flour, and a slice of peeled lemon to keep 
them white; put diem into a good white or brown sauce to 
soak, being first drained from 3ie boiling; use a bit of butter, 
or cuHis sauce, and proper seasoning, and add a lemon 
squeeze when ready. If you would finish them with Parme-

Des Trufes. 
Of Truffles. 

The French author says, that they arc brought to Paris 
from the hot provinces, particularly from Perigord, Gas- 
fQgne, Limomfy Jgenois, and other parts of the South of 
France. It is well known to all travellers, and many others, 
that the flavour of foreign truffles is far superior to those 
found in Ei^land ; which may be attributed to the coldness 
of the climate. I believe Hampsliire produces the most; 
though they are found in Windsor^-park, and several other 
counties of England. I'hey are imported from abroad, and 



Tim >ROPE8SGB COOK. 471 

sold at a very high price at most Italian shops; but their fla- 
vour is much wasted, ai^d very little superior to those found 
in England. They grow in the ground without any outward 
appearance, llie author says, that, as pigs are very fond of 
them, and haVe often been the occasion of discovering where 
they grow, the hint might be useful in England, were a little 
more attention paid to it. 

Trufes aii Court-bouillon. 
Truffles plain boiled. 

Soak the truffles a while in warm water, and clean them 
carefully with a bmsh ; boil them in half wine and water^

them hot m a napkin. — ^lliey are also baked in ashes without 
a pot, only wrapped in several papers, and the outer one 
made wet; bake them about an hour, and if the paper should 
burn, clean them with a brush. 

Trufes en Pmts.

it with yolks of eggs beat up, stuff the truffles with this farce, 
and cover the holes with the first bits cut off; braze them 
with slices of veal, ham, lard, a glass of white wine, and a

Of Mordls, Mushrooms, and Champignons. 

M0RELL8 are much of the same nature as mushrooms ; 
di^ grow in shady places, and are only to be had in the 
spnng ; they require a deal of attention to clean them pro- 
perly^ being very sandy. By the description the author 
gives of Mousserons and Champignons, it seems that one 
nation or the other is mistaken in the appellation-r-a^ I ap- 
prehend that mushrooms is literally translated from mousse- 
rons. He says, that Mou^^erons are found in shady mossy 
places ; that they are smaller than the champignons^ redish 
on the outside, and white underneath : he calls them also a 
species of Champignons^ of an excellent flavour and taste. 
niave already taken notice of their uses. The best cham- 
pignons ape those that grow on hot beds ; they ought to be very 
Mrhite and firmj and used very fresh ; they are of very gieat 
utility iu Cookery, and to add to their merit, may be ob- 
tained almost all the year.

De rOFFICE. 
Of CONFECTIONARY. 

Tbb names or appellations by which the different de- 
grees of refining sugar are distinguidied, seem (as £ar as I am 
Me to judge) to have no other meaning dian dsieir beii^ 
adopted by custom in the French language. As I am od- 
able to translate them literally to their true sense and jMt^per 
meaning, and being very willing to explain them to the ut- 
most of niy power (as it is a very necessary part of know- 
ledge to such as are emjiloyed in the preparation <tf sweet- 
meats), I shall still retain the French appellations, wUh an 
explanation of their meaning, and distingtiidi each hj fini^ 
second, S^c, Sfc. degrees of refining. The mfferent teims used 
in the French language will soon become familiar, as well as 
many others in Cookery already enumerated. I am unac- 
quainted with the tenns used by English Confectioners, as 
diey are in every nation very secret in regard to the prepare* 
tioiis of sugar. The rieason is very natural. To avoid any 
reflection of ungeqprosity, I have not applied to any body 
in the course of the whole translation, but shall continue in 
my first and firm resolution, to finish it according to the 
original, with such explanations as my small capacity en- 
ables me to give.

Des differentes Cuissons de Sucre. 
Of the different Degrees of preparing Sugar. 

I Cuissons mean the pre|^arations of eatables in all the' 

different manners by fire, either boiling, roasting, &c. See. 
In this case I shall use the word refining after the firsts 
which is clarifying. We have different ways of refining 
sugar after it is clarified, each aj^propriated to different 
purposes, according to what use it is intended ; they follow 
according to their degrees of refining, and are distinguished 
by the following names : The first is called petit Lisse : 
second, grand Line ; third and fourth, le petit Sf grand 
Perli: fifth and sixth, lavetit 4r grande Queue de Cochon ; 
seventh, le sot^ ; eighth and ninth, la petite 8f grande 
Plume; tenth and eleventh, le petit aiH gros Boulet ; 
twelfth, le Casse ; thirteenth, le Caramel. — It is to be 
observed, that these are prepared widi fine sugar. 

De la Fafon de clarifier le Sucre. 
The Method of clarifying Sugar. 

Proportion for three pounds of sugar; put a pint of 
water and half the white of an egg in a skillet, beat it up 
with a whisk to froth the white of the eg^, put it upon the 
f^" fire with the sugar, make it boil, and .as it rises put a little 

water to it, and so continue till the scum b^ins to turn 
bkickish ; then Uke it off the fire and let it settle : as the 
scum rise^ of itself, take it off with a skimmer, and put the 
kettle on the fire again ; continue to boil it ; as it rises 
dirow in a little water as before, and skim it continually till 
it ceases to rise : when it is done, to clear it properly, sift 
it in a wet napkin. Regulate the quantity of water and egg 
by this rule for more or less. 

Premiere Cuisson de Sucre^ qui est le Petit 

Lissi. 

First Degree of refining Sugar, called Small 
LissSj viz. sleeked. 

Put the clarified sugar upon the fire to boil gently ; you 
will know when it is to the hrst degree by dipping one finger 



478 rnt pitoTEftSEB cook. 

in it, joining it to the timmb, and tfa^ opening them ; for if 
it draws to a small thread, and in breaking returns to each, 
finger in the nature of a drop, it is done. 

Le grand Lisse : Second D^ree. It is boiled a little 
more, and the thread extends further before it breaks, and is 
proved after the same manner. 

Le Petit Perle : TTiird Degree. It is still boiled a little 
more until it does not break by extending the fingers half as 
much as is possible to do. One pound of sugar is sufficient 
to make a trial of all the different degrees, 

Cuissms au grand TerU^ h la petite^ fU la 
. gra^ide Queue de Cockon^ au soi^i^ ^ d la 
Petite Plume. 

Third, fourth, fifth, sixth, seventh, and eighth 
Degrees of refining. PerlSj from Pearl, 
large and small ; siflall and large Pigs*Tails ; 
puffed or blown ; and Plume or Feather. 

The grand Perle is boiled a little longer dian the small, 
and is known to be the degree wanted, by not breaking by 
all the extension diat can be made with the finders ; and 
also when it forms into small pearls in the boiling, round 
and raised, by which I presume it takes its name. In boil^ 
ing this last a little longer, it comes to the fifdi degree, or 
Petit Queue de CochoA : it is known by taking up some of 
the sugar with a skimmer, and dropping it into the boiling , 
sugar again : if it forms a daiiting streak on the surface, diis 
is 'tailed die little pig's tail.* — ^The sixth degree is "La graade 
Queue de Cochon ; which being stiR more boiled, and tried 
in the same manner as the last, forms a larger pig's tail. 
After a little more boiling comes the seventh degree — uiu 
souffle, blown ; which is known by dipping a skimmer into 
it, giving it a sliake, and blowing through it direcdy ; if it 
blows to small sparks of sugar, or in small bladders, it is to 
the proposed qualification. The eighth comes widi a little 
more boiling. La petite Plume, smalt feathers; y^hich is 
known by tlie same trial ; the difference only is, diat the 
sparks or bladders are to be larger, and of a stronger 
substance. 



i 



THB PROFESSED COOK. 479 ' 

Le grande Plume. 
A large Feathear. Ninth Degree. 

It is known by the former method, being still more 

^boiled, and the proof stronger; but the surest is By dipping 

» skimmer into it, and giving it a strong turn-over shake of 

the hand ; if it turns to krge sparks, which clog together in 

tbe rising, it is done to this degree* 

Le petit Boulet. 
A small Ball or Bullet. Tenth Degree. 

It is done by a little more boiling, and proved by dipping 
two fingers in cold water, and directly into the sugar, and 
into cold water again ; what sticks to your fingers ought to 
roll up like a bit of paste, hard enough to form into small 
bullets, and to remaiti pretty supple when cold. 

Eleventh D^rec, Le gro$ Boulei, larro bullet. Tliis is 
proved by the fast method, which, by a uttle more boiling, 
makes the bullet harder when cold, as it ought to be. 

Twelfth Decree, Le Casst, broken. By continuing to 
boil the sugar, it is known by the same method as in the two 
last ; the only diierence is, that the bullet which is made of 
this ought to crumble between the fingers, being first dipped 
in cold water. 

Le Caramel. 
Burnt Sugar. Thirteenth Degree^ 

71118 refining is little difierent from the last ; to make it 
pretty clear, squeeze some lemon into it while it is boiling. 
There is also a deepH:oloured caramel, of which the uses 
shall be mentioned ; it is made with only a little water, with 
the sugar, boiling it without stirring to raise any sQuni^ until 
it is to the colour required ; take it off the fine for present 
use. To all the different degrees of preparation, if illissed 
at first,, add a little water to refresh tlie sugar, and boil it qver 
dgain, until it comes to the qualification required.

time to bring it to a drier conristence, and mix a poond of 
sugar widi it, prepared to the ninth d^ree, or gramde Plume, 
stirring it continually with a wooden Spatma^ viz. a flat 
spoon. The paste ought to be of a fine red colour, pretty 
substantial, and applied directly to what use you propose. 
This is mostly done in moulds of different sizes and shapes, 
^ made like hoops, without tops or bottoms ; put them upoQ 
a baking-plate to dry i FEtuveef viz. an arti6cial stove, or 
hot-house, in which place all sugar-paste and sweet-meats 
ought to be kept. Where there arts no artificial stoves 
(which are radier scarce in England), those pastes may be 
dried in a very mild oven, or in any moderate heat, and al- 
ways kept in a very dry place. 

P&te de Grosdlles.

the fire again to reduce the Juice to a soft paste consistence, 
stirring continually : when it is come to a pretty thick sub- 
stance, add a pound of sugar, prepared as the last, and finish 
it in the same manner.-^It is also done as follows, vix. when 
the gooseberries are sifted to about three half-pints of juice, 
put a pound of sugar-powder, and boil together until it 
throws large sugar-sparks, in blowing through a skimmer 
dipt in the boiling ; then take it off the fire to mould it, and

it refreshes the sugar ; put it upon the fire again to bring it 
to tiie same 'degree ; let it cool to half, put it into mourn, 
and drv it in a stove of a moderate heat, kept as equal as 
possible. It is known to be candied, by thnistmg a small 
skewer into the comer of each mould to the bottom, and tiie 
top must be sparkling like a diamond; put the moulds upon 
one side, to dram a good while before you take out tiie can* 
dy, turn it over upon white paper, and keq> it always in a 
dry place.

Compote d^Amandes vertes. 
Compote of green Almonds. 

This k done after the same maoneri while they are tender^ 
and much in the same state, as wahnuts for pickling: if you 
make it for keeping, the syrup must be stronger, and give 
them a few bodings before using. — ^This compote is also 
made in winter wi^ such as are preserved, by boiliij^ them 
a moment in their syrup and a little water: the dri^ pre* 
served must be boiled a small time, with a little water and 
raw sugar. 

Compote dt Apricots mlars. • 
Compote of red Apricots. 

Peel them, cut into halves, break the stones, and peel 
the l^emels; put them into tlie pan, with a little water and 
sugar, regulating the quantities according to the ripeness of 
the fruit; boil them like any other compote; take them off 
the fire, and skim them with bits of paper; put a bit of kernel 
upon each half: if to keep any time, reduce the syrup pretty 
strong. — ^Tliey are also dressed a la Cloche, as black cap^ 
when pretty lai^ e, and almost ripe, taking out the stones^ 
and baking in the same manner, either whole or in halves. 

.-^Compote de PSches. 
Compote of Peaches. 

' Cut them into halves, and if pretty ripe, peel them bv 
tearing off the rind; if not, boil them a moment in water,' tiU 
you can peel them in this manner; and finish stewing in cla- 
rified sugar: they are also served in acompotier wben ripe, 
being peeled and cut m halves; strew some powder sugar 
over, or a light syrup. Do die same with those preserved 
in brandy, or d la Cloche, as the last. 

Compote grilUe de PSches. 
Compote of roasted or broiled Peaches. 

This is made differently. Such as are not quite ripe may

be roasted before the fire like apples, and served with p o w - 
dered sugar over them, or a light syrup under: others are 
fried over a smart fire/ till the rind can be nibbed off by 
Mrashingtn water; they are then boiled whole in sugar and 
water. Th^ may be boiled in water till the rind can be 
torn off; drain them, prepare some sugar au Caramel, and 
roll die peaches in it gendy until diey are done ; pot them 
into the Compatier; add a little water in the pan to gather 
the remainmg sugar, and pour it upon the peaches. This 
i$ mosdy done wi£ latter fruit. 

De Verjus et Muscat. 
Compote of Verjuice aftid Muscadine Grapes. 

This is done when the grapes are almost ripe ; grain them, 
and put them in water ready to boil ; tate them off as soon 
as they change colour, and add a little cold water to refresh 
them : let them cool in this water, and it will bring them to 
their first natural green ; to a pound of grapes, add half a 
pound of sugar with a little water ; when the sugar is pro- 
perly melted, put the dramed raisins therein, and boil them 
together a moment ; take diem off the fire, and skim them 
with bits of paper ; put the verjuice in die compotier, and 
reduce the syrup to what consistence you think proper to 
pour upon the grapes. When the grapes are out of season, 
boil some of the preserved liquid ; warni it in some of the 
syrup, and a little water, and serve in the same manner. — 
Muscadine is made after the same way ; after boiling a little 
time, and draining, boil them a moment in sugar, prepared 
a la petite Plume, (eighth degree) half a pound of sugar to a 
pound of fruit. 

Compote de Prunes. 
Compote of Plums. 

There are but few sorts of plums in England that will 
bear boiling. Green gages are in the first perfection for this 
purpose, though neitlier they, nor any others, must be tho- 
roughly ripe for it ; also the mirabel plum, and a few others, 
mostly of foreign appellation : boil them a little while in raw 
sugar and a little water, according to their ripeness ; skim it 
when cooling with bits of paper, and reduce the syrup ac- 



THE PAOFSSSEO COOK. 509 

«ordmg as you propose to keep them ; if for present use, it 
is sufficient to make a good palatable syrup : serve hot or 
coIdL The best methra for preserviag is to prick tbedi in 
several places, and scald diem in boiling water uodl Uiey risa 
on the surface; take them off the iire, and let diem cool in 
the same water; cover the pan, and put them on a slow fire, 
which will bring them back to their proper colour; dien 
drain them into cold water, and boil them a moment in sugar 
au petit Lisse; (first degree) leave them in the sugar till 
the next day, and boil them a little more : when prepared ' 
after tliis manner they wiU keep a long while. Such sorts 
of plums as will not bear boiling without breaking to a 
marmalade, are only to be prepared for present use, and are 
soon done ; scald them a moment in boiling water, dien boil 
them in sugar and alittle water^ and skim them in the same 
manner. 

Comp6te de Marons. 
Compote of Chesnuts. 

Prick the chesnuts in several places with tfie point of a 
knife, to hinder them from cracking and flying out ; broil 
them in ashes, take off the husks, simmer them some time 
in clarified sugar, and add a Seville oransre-squeeze ; when 
taken off die fire, squeeze them a litne before boiling 
in the sugar, by which means they will take the sugar 
die better : do them gendy for fear they should crumble^ 
and let them be in the syrup a day or two, or more, be- 
fore usmg. 

Compote ^Oranges donees. 
Compote of sweet or China Oranges. 

Thet are served as compotes without any other pre- 
paration 'than peeling ; slice them, and serve with cold light 
syrup, or powder sugar over them; you may also serve them 
whole, peeled or not ; prick them with a knife in several ' 
places, and stuff as much sugar in every one as they will 
admit ; the lemon is served after the same manner, u^ing 
sugar in proportion to its sharpnesa.

Cofpqwte de Zetles. 
Compote of bits of Rinds of the same. 

Tbet are made with the rinds of China or Seville oraiq[e9; 
fhe first called orange doiccf, the second begarade ; and le« 
taoBS in the same manner ; peel them pret^ thin, soak them 
in watcf some time, and boil them in fredi water till thcj 
are tender, which is known by their yielding to the touch; 
then poor them into cold water a moment, drain them, and 
boil a little while in clarified sngar ; take them off die &ne, 
let them soak in the si^ar some hours, and boil again to 
bring the syrup to a proper consistence. 

Compote de Taittddins. 

« 
Compote of Lemons, cut into pieces, quarters, 
more or less. 

Cut lemons into quarters, take out all the fleshy part to 
Ae thick rind, and boil them after the same manner as be- 
fore : for these sorts of compotes, clarify the same we%ht 
of sugar as fruit — Both sorts of oranges and lemons are 
done after diis manner, either whole, in halves, or quarters. 
Observe to soak them a long while in several waters before 
boiling, which draws the bitterness out of the rinds, and makes 
tfiem much more tender. 

Compote de Cerises. 
Compote of Cherries. 

Cut the tails to about half; if they are very ripe, they 
require only a quarter of a pound of clarified SH|pr to ea^ 
pound of cherries; if not, they require more; bod the sugar 
to a syrup, put the cherries to simmer a litde while in it^ 
then take it off the fire, skim it with paper, and dress them 
in the compotier, the tails upwards, llus is meant for pre- 
sent use : such as are to be kep^ the syrup ought to be re- 
fined more^ and still they require to be boiled a moment 
pretty often : moreilas require more sugar, and are almost 
the only cherries fit for preserves in England, whether in 
sugar or brandy, or dried either ^ith sugsgr or without.

good malleable paste ; bake it upon paper made in what 
form your fancy leads, either m the oven, or under a brazing- 
pan cover, with a little fire over ; when done the uppermost 
side, glaze the under side with a white glaze, and finish with 
the glazed side uppermost. 

Biscuits de Chocolat. 
Chocolate Biscuits. 

Pound a quarter of a pound of chocolate, and mix it with 
four yolks of eggs, and half a pound of fine powder-sugar; 
add eight whites beat up, mi a quarter of a pound of flour ; 
pour &em upon the paper with a spoon of what length or 
bigness you please. 

Another Method^ mth Chocolate. Make a paste with 
much the same quantity of chocolate, six whites of eggs, and 
sugar sufficient to msJce the paste pretty firm ; dress it in 
flowers, designs, or moulds, according to imagination and 
fancy, and bake as the biscuits.

as are those also of AvelineSy viz. filberts. 

Des Ouvrages d'Amandes^ et de Pistaches. 

Of the different Preparations of Almonds and 
Pistachio Nuts. 

Amandes d Id Prdline. 
Dried, preserved, or burnt Almonds. 

They are done with sweet almonds widiout scalding; rob 
them well in a cloth to clean them properly, and put them 
into a frying-pan, with as much weight of sugar, and a little 
water; keep them on the fire, stirring continually, until iktej 
crackle and fly about, and die siigar begins to colour : stir 
them about gently to gather the sugar, and leave them in the 
i>an to dry abotit two hours in we stov^ or any moderate 
beat. 

Afnandes d ia Prdline rouges. 
Red Colour. 

Prepare them as the first, linlil th^ have taken the su- 
gar, and are ready to be taken off the fire ; put the almonda 
upon a sieve, with a dish under ; take the sugar that drops, 
and put it into the same pan, adding a little fresh; refine it 



TH£ PBOFB88ED COOK. 517 

till it comes to the twelfth degree (viz. au Casse), then take 
cochineal, colour sufficient to tinge the almonds, and put 
them therein ; give them a few turns oVer the fire in the su- 
gar, and 6Ni.sh as the first. 

. Amandes sonfflis. 
Blowed or raised Almonds. 

Scald a few almonds, and pound them to about half aa 
fine as for biscuits; beat this with lemon-juice, whites of 
eggs, and powder-sugar, aad drop the composition on pap^, 
in the bigness of almonds ; dry in the stove, or a mild 
oven. 

Another fashion of preparing sham almonds is, when 
scalded, to cut them into small fillets ; and mix then with 
ra8|>ed lemon-peel, whites of eggs, and sugar, sufiicieat to 
make a pret^ firm paste ; roll it in the shape of almoiids,and 
finish either as the first or last : they ought to be picked from 
the paper while warm. 

Amandes masquees. Warm die almonds as you peel 
tfaetn, and while warm dip them one by one in sugar au 
^rand PerU (fourth degree), and strew them widi nonpareils 
of different colours ; dry them as usual. 

Prdlines blanches. 
Sugar Almonds, white. 

Scald and pee^ the almonds, and put them into the pan, 
with sugar, prepareH au grand Boulet (eleventh degree), boil 
them a momeift ia it, and take them oS the five before the 
sugar changes its colour; stir continually, as long as the su- 
gar sticks to the pim ; if it cools too soon, put it on the fire 
again, and rool the aimoads in it as before. 

Tourom: so called from being made like round drops. 
Chop the almonds after they are scalded, and put them on 
ike fire, with a little sugar, and rasped lemon-peel ; then let 
them cool, to mix with more raw sugai* and whites of eggs, 
until it comes to a pretty firm paste; make little round bufiets 
like macaroni-drops, and dry them in the stove as usual. You 
may also mix a few bitter almonds with the sweet in the 
chopping : these are commonly called ratafia drops. 



518 THE PBOVC89ED COOI^. 

Amandes d tAnghise. 
Almonds, English Fashion. 

Mix almonds and filberts scalded in equal quantities; 
chop half of the whole very fine, and of die test only cut 
each in two or diree slices; put the whole in double tlieir 
weight of sugar, prepared a la grand Plume, with some le- 
mon-peel rasped; sdr the almonds very well in the sugar, 
takine it off the fire, and add oue or two whites of eggs; 
pour It in a paper laige enough to contain die whole, and cat 
It for use as you think proper, when baked as usual. 

Piriackes an Caramel. 

Scald and wipe diem very dry; cut each into quarters, 
strew diem upon a plate rubbed over with oil, and pour a 
caramel over them; turn them, and do the same over again 
upon the other side. — Another manner: pound pistacUo- 
nuts, put them on the fire, with half their weight of sngar, 
stir it about, and keep them on a soaking fire till the sugar 

!|uit8 the finger for dryness; cut it into small bits, in the 
orm of pisUchio-nuts, almonds, or any thing else; if in sfaajpe 
of fruits, stick a bit of wood to resemble die tail, and dip 
each in sugar-caramel ; dry the fruit upon hurdles. 

Des Marmtlades. 
Of Marmalades. 

Marmelade de Pommes et at Poires. 
Mannalade of Apples an^ Pears. 

Peel golden pippins, and cut them into thin slices; boil 
them in a litde water till veiy tender, and sift in a sieve; pat 
the marmalade on the fire to reduce the liquid; then add as 
much weight of sugar d la grand Plume, simmer a little 
while on a slow fire, stirrins; continually, to incorporate it 
with the sugar; pour it into the pot, and let it cool very well 
before covering. — Hiat of pears is done the same. 



THB 7BOFBS8ED COOK. 519 

Marmelade dtOrange. 
Orange Marmalade. 

This U mostly made with china oranges: cut .each into 
quaters^ and squeeze out the juice ; take off tke hard parts at 
both ends, and boil in water until they art quite tender; 
squeeie them to extract the water, and pound diem in the 
mortar to a mMrmabde to sift ; mix it with tn equal weight 
of raw sugar, and boil till it turns to a syrup : the proportions 
are for keeping, two pounds of sugar to one pDund of marma- 
lade. 

€f Plumbs. Stone them, and boil a moment with a little 
water; sift as the former ; soak thd marmalade a little while 
on the fire, and then mix it with as much sugar au Casse^ 
(twelfth d^ree) and finish as before. • 

Marmelade dtAbricots. 
Apricot 'Marmalade. 

Peel and stone them, and pound the kernels separate; 
boil the apricots on a clear fire, with a little water, and three 
Quarters of a pound, or a pound of sugar to each pound of 
fruit; (this is to be judged of according to their ripeness) 
bruise them in the boiling with a wooden spoon, and boil 
till it sticks to the fingers pretty hard, by joming two toge- 
ther; then take it off the fire to put into pots, adding tlie 
kernels to it a moment before. — It is also done by boiling the 
apricots to a marmalade alone, and mixing with an equal 
weight of sugar au Casse ; boil a moment to mix together, 
and finish as the first. 

Marmelade de Fleurs dOrange. 
Orange-flower Marmalade. 

When properly picked, scald them a moment, and put 
them in water which has been warmed, and a little allum dis- 
solved therein ; boil some other water, with a good lemon 
squeeze in it, and put the flowers in it a few minutes till 
they feel tender; sift them from this water, and put them 
into fresh, with a lemon squeeze also ; then drain them in a 
napkin to pound, and mix them with sugar, prepared au petit 
Ltssif (first degree) after clarification ; pour them genuy to 



520 THE PROVBSSED CeOK. 

mix the better without boiling ; the proportion is five pound 
of sugar to two of orange marmalade ; finish as usual. 

Marmelade de Cerises. 
Cherry Marmalade. 

Trim the tiils^ stone diem, and boil with the proporti<m 
of half a pound of sugar (grande plume)f to a pound of 
cherries, boil till it comes to a good consiatence. 

De Frambmes : Raspberries. Bruise and sift them 
through a sieve ; reduce to half on the fire, then mix them 
with half a pound of sugar, as the last, to a pound of fruit. 

De GroseHks: Of Gooseberries. Boil them a moment, 
or only Scald them in boiling water ; sift, and finish by the 
same proportion as the raspberries. 

De Violettes: Of Violets. Pick them very well, and 
pound them quite to a juice ; fraix them .with sugar pre- 
pared as before : the proportion is five pounds of sugar to 
one of violets. 

Marmelade d^Amande$ 6^ d^Abricots verts : Of green 
almonds and apricots. Bub the down of either almonda 
or apricots, and boil them in water till very tender \ sift as 
udual, and reduce to about half on the fire ; mi^ an equal 
weight of sugar (au casse)^ without boiling, and finish as 
all others. 

De Coigns : Of Quinces. Sift as most others, and mix 
in the proportion of five pounds of sugar to four of qubces : 
if you would have it red, mix cochineal with it. 

Des Gelies. 
Of Jellies. 

GelSe de Pommes. 
Jelly of Apples. 

Peel and slice golden pippins, according to what qna&- 
tity of jelly is required ; boil them to a marmalade with a 
little wateTi and a lemon sliced, and .sift the juice through a 



TnS PROFfiSSEB COOK* 5S1 

pmity fine Biwe : the pioportioa is about t pint of diis joice 
to a pound of lugar, prepared au fros boukt (elevendi de- 
gree) ; simmer together on a slow nre till it quits the spoon 
clean, by dropping it out of it ; then put it into pots or 
glasses.— Other sorts of apples also serve for jelly, done in 
a different manner. Peel any kind of sharp apples, cut them 
into slices as the last, wash them in several waters, then boil 
in a good deal of water, the pot being covered until it is 
much reduced, and becomes glutinous : strain the decoction 
in a thin linen cloth, measure it, and refine as much clarified 
sugar to the twelfth degree (viz. au cassi)^ and pour the juice 
gently into it ; boil a moment, then take it oS the fire to 
skim it ; boil it again till it comes to the same consistence as 
the last, and prove it in the same manner. 

Gelh rouge dePommes : The same red. It is done as the 
first, only adding a sufficient quantity of cochineal colour 
while mixing. 

Gelie de Muscat. 
Jelly of Muscadine Grapes. 

Boil ripe grapes a moment in water till they burst ; then 
sift them in a fine sieve, or as the last, and mix the juice 
with sugar prepared d la grande plume (ninxh degree)^ a pound 
of dugar to half a pint of the grape decoction, and reduce 
to the same consistence as the last. — Of Verjuice Grapes, 
or others, follow the same method, only proportioning the 
quantity of sugar to the sharpness of the fruit used. 

GeUe de Grenades. 
Jelly of Pomegranate- 

Make a marmalade with the pomegranate, and sift it in 
a sieve ; then add the seeds pounded to the marmalade, boil 
a moment, and sift it again through a sieve ; use the propor* 
tion of a pound of sugar, au grand boulet, to half a pint of 
marmalade ; and^nish as the preceding. 

D'Epine vinette : Of Barberries. Boil them on a smart 
fire witti a little water, and sift as usual ; reduce a pound of 
clarified sugar (au casse), to each half pint of juice; mix 
them together gently ; boil a moment, then take them off

die fire to skim ; put them en a slow fire a^aia till finished 
to the consistence of others, and prove tt by the same 
method. 

Gelie de Cerises. 
Jelly of Cherries, 

They must be thorpugbly ripe ; bruise and sift them in 
a sieve, let the juice settle a little, and then pqur the dear 
off; mix according to the proportion of the last, and finish 
in the same manner, 

De Groseilles; of Gooseberries : Et de Framboises; and 
of Raspberries. The are done after the same method as the 
cherries, except that you mix half as much red currants with 
the raspberries. 

GelSe de Groseilles d'une autre Fafon. 
Another Method of making Currant Jelly. 

(The French distinguish all sorts of Groseilles 
only by the colour, as red or black, &c.) 

Weigh seven pounds of red currants without being picked ; 
boil them with a glass of water, and sift in a sieve ; weigh 
tlie gross substance that does not sift, and if there remains 
half a pound, there ought to be near five pounds of juice; 
put this juice into a pan, with as many pounds of pounded 
sugar, which pour in it by little and little ; or, to keep it 
]>retty tartish, use only four pounds; boil, stirring con- 
tinually ; when it has boiled a moment, take it ofFthe fire to 
skim, and dien boil a little while longer ; let it rest in die pan, 
and skim again very clean. 

GelSe de Coigns. 
Quince Jelly- 

Cut them mto pieces, and boil m half a pint of water to 
one pound of quinces ; cover the pan, and let them stew to 
a marmalade to sift as usual : prepare the sugar i la grande 
plumey and use the proportion of one pound to half a pint 



THE PROFESSED COOK. 523 

of the decoction ; boil till it is reduced to the same , con- 
sistence as all others ; to make it red^ simmer it a long while 
Mrhen the mixture is made^ and you may also add a little 
cochineal to give it a better colour. 

GeI6e de Grostilles vertes. 
Jelly of green Gooseberries. 

Put them into hot water, and place them on^ a slow fire 
till they rise to the surface ; then take them off the fire, and 
pour a little cold water into the pan to cool it, and to bring 
them to their proper green ; put in a little vinegar and salt, • 
and in about naif an hour drain them, and put them into 
cold water a moment ; then drain them again, and mix with 
an equal weight of sugar, a la perle (tliird degree) ; boil a little 
while till the sugar is again to the same degree, and take 
care to skim it ; sift it through a sieve, and put it into pots 
or glasses.* 

Des Confitures au Liquide. 
Of Liquid Sweetmeats. 

Confiture d'Abricots. 
Liquid Apricot Sweetmeats. 

They ought to be used when they are almost ripe ; peel 
them, split them sufficiently to take out the stones, and boil 
them in water till they feel tender under the pressure of the 
finder ; then take them out to drain ; put them into au e<}ual 
weight of sugar d lagrande plume (ninth degree), and boil a 
moment; take them off die fire, and let them lie in the sugar 
till the next day ; then take them out, and boil tlie sugar two 
or three minutes ; put tlie fruits in it again, and boU a mo- 
ment together the next day to finish. 

* It IS to be obserred, that as these jellies aie directed to be done 
much in the same manner as the marmalades, that the difference most 
be observed in sifting the different sorts of fruits, not to force tlie gross 
fleshy particles, rather only the juices, M'hich make the jellies clearer, 
and ought for that purpose to be strained in linen cloths, rather than 
any kind of sitTes*

Cim/iture de Cerises. 
Of liquid Cherries. 

The proportion of sugar prepared a la grande plume, ib 
three quarters of a pound to one pound of cherries, which 
ou|ht, as all fruita for this i>urpose, to be quite ripe ; cut the 
tails about half; put them into the sugar, and simmer about 
five minutes, the pan being covered ; let the whole rest to- 
gether till the next day, then add a quarter of a pound of 
^gar to each pound of cherries, prepared as the first, arid a 
little decoction of red currants; simmer together till the 
syrup is quite rich and glutinous. 

Another way is, to strip the tails, stone them, and boil 
two or three minutes in sugar prepared as before — (half a 
pound of sugar to one of cherries]) ; let it rest till the next 
day, drain out the cherries, and boil the sugar again to the 
aforesaid degree ; put the fruit to it asain to simmer a little

Des Confitures au Sec. 
Of dried Sweetmeats, 

All kiiuls of dried sweetmeats are mostly done with 
liquids, and are all made much after the same manner ; after 
they have been used several times, or lose their colour by an^ 
other means, Atj will always serve to dry. Take green apri- 
cots or almonds out of the syrup or liquid ; roll diem in su- 
gar, and dry them upon a sieve m the oven. — Strawberries^ 
raspbemes, &c. are done die same.

Dried preserved Cherries in Nosegays or 
Bunches, &c. 

Use the liquid ones with the tails on, tie several tc^ther, 
and dry them in the oven without being rolled in sugar (or 
only one with the tail on, and four or six others stoned, and 
applied upon the first, with the syrup, so as to appear as 
one) ; strew a little powder-sugar over, and dry as the first. 
Liquid orange-flowers are done by putting the pot into boil* 
ing water to melt the syrup clearer ; drain the flowers, 
and powder them with Hugar to dry.-r-Apricots, almonds, 
pears, apples, peaches, nectarines, bergainot, lem<Hi, and

Of Plumsj and dried or baked Apples, 

These are prepared after another manner, with any kind 
of plums, provided they quit the stone like apricots. Cut 
them on one side, to stone them ; clarify half a pound of su*

while on a slow fire, and let them rest in the sugar till the next 
day ; boil the su^ar a la Perk ; simmer the fruits a few mi- 
nutes, the pan being covered, leave them till the next day, and 
then drain them out to dry as usual.

boil a moment together ; being cold, put them into bottles, 
and mix half a pint of the syrup to three half-pints of 
brandy, which you pour upon the peaches ; stop the bottles 
very well, to preserve them clear. If you would have the 
peaches peeled, use them before they are auiteso lipe 98 the 
first ; boil them in water, until you can pull the rind off wtdi 
the fingers, and put them into cold water, as soon as done, 
one after another ; being drained, boil them a moment in die 
same proportion of clarified sugar as directed at first; skim

fruit out, and boil me sugar a few minutes ; pour it again 
upon the fruit till the day following, and then bottle the 
peaches ; mix the syrup with as much brandy, and poiir it 
upon them. Observe, that in this, and all other preserved 
fruits, they must swim in the syrup. This last method is not 
so proper for long keeping as the first. Observe the same

them in water till they feel pretty tender; then peel, and pot 
them into cold water, as die last peaches, adding a lemon 
squeeze ; clarify half as much weight of 'sugar as pears, and 
boil them in it slowly a few minutes ; being well skimmed, 
leave them in the sugar till the next day, then repeat the

die fruit, when half cold. 

Naix ; Walnuts^— Use them at the same growth as set 
forth for Confiture (see page 52S), and prepare diem in the 
same manner; the only difference is, that you use only half a

much brandy, which being well incorporated together with 
the sugar au Perli, pour upon the fruit, when it is almost 
cold.

when cold : tlie oranges must swim in it, as all other fruits. 

Des Mousses. 
Of frothed or whipped Creams. 

These are often served iced abroad, and may be made 
two or three hours before they are wanted ; for that puipoae 
they have a tin mould, made large enough to contam aa 
many glasses, cups, or thin silver tumblers, as will ice a 

Suautity sufficient for a dish ; it has commonly two plates, 
le bottom solid, tlie next bored in small holes, to let the 
melted ice run off, and rings in it to hold the glasses ; the ice 
under being pounded widi salt, and afso upon the cover, when

Des Fruits glacis. 
Of Iced Fruits. 

Fdn this purpose you must have moulds made in the form 
of the different fruits proposed ; accordihgly^ make marma- 
lades of the several sorts of fruit, as directed page 6 1 8, and ice 
them in the same manner as the former ices; when iced, >vork 
them with a spoon till the ice is in marmalade, to put in the 
fruit-mould; shut them close, and wrap them in paper to 
ice them again as before; the pail or bucket in which the 
fruit are to be iced, should be bored, that the water may run 
off as the ice melts: when ready to serve, have the proper 
colour of the fruit ready, which you colour with a peucil to 
imitate nature ; the best method is to have a natural one, or 
one properly painted for a pattern. See the different colours 
used in confectionary, as directed, page 486.

less; take eve to pal a little water to it while poundbg, for 
fear the almonds should turn to oil ; then put it into a bowl, 
with about a quart of water to this proportion^ and about 
two ounces of fine sugar ; let it rest about an hour, then sift 
It through a stamine with expression : you may add a little 
milk to give it a whiter colour. 

De Pistaches. Done after the same manner ; only that 
you put no milk to it, but a lemon squeeze instead thereof ; 
proportion the sugar to make it of a proper sweetness : you 
may add orange-£)wer water to both if agreeable. 

Eau rafraichissante de Fenouilj et de CerfeuiL 
Cooling Waters of Fennel, and of Chervil, 

These are done simply, by steeping some of either in hot 
water till it has the taste of dbe herbs sufficiently ; add what 
quantity of sugar you think proper, and keep it in a cool 
place a good while before using : the same is done with any 
other kind of herbs, end in general with all sorts of fruit used 
in contectionary ; also with the syrups of liquid preserves, 
mixing some of die liquor with water and sugar just sufficient 
to make it palatable : it may be either iced or not« .

Propobtion for a sallon : weigh a pound of sugar in 
lumps, wash eight good lemons, rub the rinds of two slightly 
upon the sugar, or one Seville orange instead of a lemon, aO" 
cording as it is desired ; squeeze the eight lemons, put a few 
bits of cut rind squeezed to steep in it some time, and then 
aift it in a lawn sieve; less sugar at first is rather better, as 
more can be added by proportioning the sweetness to a good 
taste : it may also be done with less lemons ; but then it is 
apt to taste very watery. 

Lait de PistacheSj et d'Amandes.

as much weight of pounded sugar : it will keep a long while^ 
and by this means you may have orgeat ready much sooner, 
by dissolving about an ounce of this paste in the proportion 
of a half pint of water, and then siftmg it for use.

This has already been mentioned ; the only difference is, 
that the cream with orange-flower water, i-asped lemon peel, 
and a proper quantity of sugar, is drained in a fine cloth, and 
served in the compotier instead of cups or glasses ; you may 
either add one or two whites of eggs to make it froth die 
better, or gum-dragon in powder ; drain it well, raise it as 
high as you can in the compotier, and stick bits of lemon 
peel in it, as is done sometimes with almonds in Blanc-

the same ; two ounces of dried preserved orange-flowers, 
three pounds of clarified sugar ; let it infuse about a month 
or six weeks in a moderate heat, and filter as Ae fonner: 
this is better the second year than the first, and may be kept

kemek, as the first, a little coriander and cinnamon), three 
pints .of gra|»e*jttice, as much brandy, and a pound of cla* 
rified sugar ; ten or twelve days will do to infuse it (without 
kernels or seeds), otherwise it requires a longer time : finish 
this as usual.

ripe, mellow, and free from blemishes ; rasp the rind off, and 
keep the fruit together a day or two in an earthen pan;

Du Caffi. 
Of Coffee. 

Thb best is that which comes frotA Turkey, and is known 
by its superior good flavour ; it is l^t, and die beans are 
of a middling bigness, the colour tending much to grey, and 
ought to be roasted fresh for use : the French mostly roast 
it in flat earAen pans, stirring continually till it is of a fine 
brown and high flavour, then smothered in paper or a linen 
cloth ; when roasted, in particular, it ought to be kept in a 
warm place : when you use it^ boil the water first, and ac- 






THB PEOFBVSBB COOK. 547 

cording to the quantity of cups wanted, put for each a table- 
spoonnil of ground coffee, or more ; and as it Jises in boil- 
ing, pour a little water upon it : many people do not clear 
it off to serve, and by that means it preserves its flavour the 
better. To make it clear, have a rair of red^ibt tcHigs, and 
bum a bit of sugar into the pot, which will clear and settle 
it directly : if you would have it with cream or milk, you 
must make it much stronger dian with water, and it should 
be strained through a cloth. Coffee is also made by puttinsr 
it into the pot widiout water, and on the fire a moment till 
it throws a great smoke ; then the water is poured upon it, 
and boiled a moment. Cqffi au lait, viz. with milk, is very 
fashionable in France. 

Du Chocolat. 
Of Chocolate. 

Simmer the chocolate on a slow fire, in the proportion 
of two ounces to each cup ; stir it about a good deal with 
a chocolate-mill, and when it is properly dissolved and 
thickened, add a yolk of an egg, beat up, to the proportion 
of four cups, or the whites equally beat up, and the firat 
frodi thrown away ; mix it first with a little of the cho- 
colate, which add to the rest, and mill it very well to incor- 
porate together ; this will make it of a proper consistence, 
and of a proper froth : it is best to be made a day or 
two before using. If you keep it ready made any time 
boil it a moment every other day; sweeten it according 
to taste.*

dip them one after ano&er in sugar prepared au cani (twelfAi 
deme)y and roll them in white nonpareils, or of any other 
cofenr, or several colovrs mixed together, and drj tbem in 
the stove, or in a soft oven. They are dso done after this 
manner — cut them into two or four pieces, put diemoo a 
bakii^-plate rubbed over with oil, and pour some hot wiga r 
caramelled over ; turn diem to do the same over again, and 
keep them io a very diy place. 

Des Fraises. 
Of Strawberries. 

Leave a bit of the tails, dip them in whites of eggs beat 
up, and roll them in su^r-powder ; lay ,them separatelj 
on paper, and dry them in a moderate heat. This is the 
manner in which all kinds of drages (sugar-fruits) are madey 
either white or of different colours ; also all sorts of almonds 
and seeds, and may be made as large as yon please^ by re- 
pealing die same as they dry. 

Des Fraises au Caramel. 
The saine» another Way. 

Dip them in caramelled sugar, and dry them upon plates 
rubbed over with a little oil, or dip them in sugar pre- 
pared au cassiy and roll them directly in nonparefls, d&ier 
of one smgle colour, or several intermixed ; follow the 
same rule for all those kinds of fruits, as grapes, mul- 
berries, cfherries, kernels, filberts, small nuts, secds^ &c. 

Des Morons. 
Of Chesnuts, &c. 

Roast them slowly, not to colour them too much ; husk 
them very clean, and follow the former method, either with 
white glaze or brown, which is the caramel, either whole or 
cut to what shape you please. 



THE P&OFBS8EB COOK. 549

ters^ dip them ia white glaze or caramel; stick a bit of 
skewer to each bit of orange, and thrust the other end of 
the stick into a hurdle, to keep the fruits from touching any 
thing. — ^Lemons and Seville oranges may be done the same ; 
observe that dther must be peeled. — Pears, apples, plums, 
hops, or any kind of fruits, flowers, or leaves, are abo done 
after this manner. 

Des Diabletom. 
From. Diable, small or yomig Devils, 

This is done widi chocolate pounded, made malleable 
with some good oil, and formed into a hard paste ; roll bits 
of it in the hand in the form of nuts, olives, pistachio, or any 
others, either round or flat ; stick bits of sugared caramel 
here and there> and strew Aem with nonpareils of difiierent 
colours ; you may also put a kernel in each of the different 
kinds of fruits proposed to imitate ; dry these in the same 

manner as all sugared fruits.
