FOREWORD 

True food economy includes the knowledge of food values 
and cookery, the planning of meals, the prevention of food 
waste and the conservation of food excess. 

We still face a food problem. A new world situation in 
food that calls for an increase in food production to meet 
the needs of suffering humanity. The increase in the pro- 
duction of home products and the utilization of such in the 
most efficient manner is one means of aiding in the preven- 
tion of a greater world food shortage. 

This bulletin containing recipes and food facts was com- 
piled for house-wives especially, whose responsibility it is, 
to give to the family in the most efficient and economical 
form, the home grown products. The following recipes in- 
clude six of the most common ones. Appetizing and 
attractively served home grown products not only mean a 
solution to the waste problem, but also an incentive to in- 
crease the food supply. The aim is to encourage the pro- 
duction of these six foods because of their variety of uses 
as well as their value as food. 

No food should be allowed to be wasted because of its 
excessive production. The utilization of such should equal 
the production. Out of season use, as well as for use in 
season, is one of the housewives' problems. 

EXPLANATIONS AND DIRECTIONS 

All measures used in these recipes are level. 

Dry materials are measured after sifting. 

Each recipe contains at least six servings. 

Ingredients are given in order in which they should be combined.

From the above we conclude that cornmeal contains as 
much carbohydrate as wheat flour ; cornmeal contains more 
fat than wheat flour or rice; cornmeal contains nearly as 
much protein as wheat flour; cornmeal contains more min- 
erals than flour or rice. 

The percentage composition of these three cereals, namely, 
wheat, corn, and rice, are about equal. Cornmeal may be 
used instead of wheat flour without any loss in food prin- 
ciples. We therefore conclude that cornmeal ranks in food 
value with these other cereals. The object in emphasizing 
the use of corn products is not to under-estimate other ce- 
reals, but to show their value as food and to show how ex- 
tensively they may be used in the diet.

HONEY

(U. S. Department of Agriculture Bulletin, No. 28.) 

There are two classes of honey found on the market, the 
extracted honey and the comb honey. Honey varies in 
flavor owing to the presence of small amounts of volatile 
substances derived from the flowers ; for example, white- 
clover honey is the product from bees having access prin- 
cipally to a white-clover patch. Another well known brand 
of honey in this state is the catsclaw. 

The simplest way of serving honey is with griddle cakes 
and bread, especially hot biscuits. It is often used for 
sweetening lemonade and other fruit drinks. One-half 
sugar and one-half honey is frequently used for cooking 
purposes. The following are tested recipes suggesting the 
use of honey for cooking. Try these, then substitute honey 
in your own recipes. It is well to remember that, when 
honey is used in place of sugar in the proportion of one cup 
of honey to one cup of sugar, it is necessary to decrease the 
liquid in the recipe about one-quarter of a cup. In making 
batter or dough mixtures with sweet milk and honey, it is 
necessary to use \{\ t soda for each cupful of honey to neu- 
tralize the acid present.

Practically all legumes may be treated under one head, 
as they are similar in their nutritive constituents and di- 
gestibility. The table above indicates that dried peas, beans, 
and lentils contain practically as much protein as lean beef 
and cheese, and considerably more than eggs. Dried legumes 
are no doubt used by the majority of American families. 
When properly cooked and well combined with other foods, 
they f6rm a palatable addition to the diet, and help to give 
variety to the menu. 

In many households, the housewife has her accustomed 
way of baking and boiling beans, but too frequently she 
stops there. She fails to vary her recipes, and thus the 
family tires of "beans, then more beans." A change in the 
seasoning ingredients, or a meat flavor added, gives such 
a wholesome and appetizing dish that meat may be omitted 
from the menu. One of the most important points to keep 
in mind in the preparation of the dried legumes is the neces- 
sity of subjecting them to a long, slow process of cooking. 
It is found that peas and beans contain a high per cent 
of cellulose. This cellulose must be thoroughly softened to 
make it digestible. To accomplish this, long, slow cooking 
is necessary. 

Attractive ways of serving dried foods — as well as any 
food — go a long way toward making them appeal to the 
family's taste. Time is also w^ell spent in adding pleasing 
garnishing touches.

MILK AS FOOD 

Milk is a liquid. For this reason, a few people are in- 
clined to class it as a beverage. Milk, however, should be 
placed among the nourishing foods, as it contains all the 
food principles that are necessary to the body. 

Milk is often spoken of as a perfect or complete food, be- 
cause it fulfils the requirements for an adequate food better* 
than any other. These are the requirements that it meets : 

(1) Milk contains the material which builds and repairs 
the body tissues. These bodj^-building substances are called 
protein. 

(2) Milk contains substances (fat and sugar) which 
furnish energy to the body. Fats, starches, and sugars are 
the chief energy foods and are called carbohydrates. 

(3) Milk contains a number of mineral substances which 
are needed in the growth and for the functioning of the 
various organs of the body. 

(4) Milk contains vitamines. These vitamines are cer- 
tain substances, the nature of which are not known defi- 
nitely, but which are essential elements in food, since their 
absence in the diet retards body growth. 

Milk should be the basis of every child's diet. One quart 
of milk a day until the child is six years of age is the 
amount essential for normal growth. The growth produced 
from one quart of milk during the early part of a child!s 
life invariably means better health and a stronger consti- 
tution than if the child has been fed on less milk and his 
diet supplemented with other less nourishing foods. 

Composition of Milk 

Milk is composed of solids and liquid. The solids include 
casein, albumen, milk sugar, fat, and minerals, and are 
commonly known as the curd. The liquid contains water, 
with albumen, milk sugar, and minerals in suspension, and 
is called whey. A pan of unskimmed sour milk in which 
the curd has completely separated from the w^hey is an ex- 



Six Texas Food Products 13 

cellent sample to study in order to understand the different 
food principles contained in milk. We readily see that there 
is more liquid (87%) than solids (13%). 

The fat can easily be removed by skimming. The fat rep- 
resents about 4.5% of the solids (13%c). 

The curd and whey may be separated by straining. The 
curd contains the casein, the chief protein of milk. The 
whey contains valuable food, and may be used in the prepa- 
ration of several dishes. A few recipes are given in this 
bulletin. 

Heat the whey. Small white particles will appear. This 
is the coagulated albumen (a protein) which resembles the 
white of egg. Cow's milk contains a higher per cent of 
proteins, which include casein and albumen, than mother's 
milk. Mother's milk, however, contains a larger per cent 
of albumen than cow's milk. Scientific experiments show 
that albumen in mother's milk is more digestible than that 
found in cow's milk; consequently it is more suitable for 
infants. Mother's milk, being the natural food, is rightly 
proportioned to meet the needs of the infant. 

Strain out the coagulated albumen. Heat the whey until 
it becomes a solid sugar-like mass. Taste it. This sub- 
stance is milk sugar, and is less sweet than commercial 
sugar. Continue heating the milk sugar until it becomes 
an ash. This ash contains the mineral baits ; namely, iron, 
calcium, potassium, and magnesium, all of which are very 
necessary to the human system. 

Use All Forms of Milk in Cooking 

Remove the cream from the whole milk and reserve it as 
an accompaniment to cocoa, breakfast foods, and desserts.

Uses of Sour Milk 

Quick Breads Griddle Cakes Bonny Clabber 

Waffles Yeast Breads Cakes 

Sour milk is due to the formation of lactic acid brought 
about by the action of lactic-acid bacteria upon the milk 
sugar. The acid produced gives the tart taste to the sour 
milk. When using sour milk for cooking, soda (an alkali) is 
added to counteract the acid. The acid and soda react 
chemically and produce a gas which acts as a lightening 
agent, and makes a light product.

in cooking. It may be substituted in any recipe calling for 
sour milk.

When milk coagulates sufficiently to become thick it is 
known as clabber. It may be beaten up and used the same 
as sour milk or butter milk. 

When the coagulated protein is separated from the whey 
it becomes known as curd, or cottage cheese. Cottage cheese 
is a concentrated protein food. It may be served in a va- 
riety of nutritious dishes.

(U. S. Department of Agriculture Bulletin, No. 28.) 

Protein is an absolute necessity in our diet, because it 
supplies the nitrogen needed for building and repairing 
body tissues. The muscle or tissue building foods include 
milk, cheese, eggs, meat, peas, beans, and peanuts. The 
peanut is a very good source from which to get the protein. 
Peanuts may be recommended for several reasons : they are 
rich in protein — therefore may be frequently substituted 
for meat; they offer a comparatively cheap source of pro- 
tein; there is practically no waste after the shells are re- 
moved; they are readily prepared, easily stored, easily di- 
gested, especially if well masticated; they are a home-gar- 
den product. 

The above table shows by comparison how peanuts may 
be used as a meat substitute. It is estimated that a man at 
moderate muscular work needs about 3.5 ounces of protein 
a day. A family consisting of father, mother, and three 
children (3, 6 and 12 years of age) need about twelve 
ounces. The following table indicates a few foods that are 
rich in protein, and the amount contained in each pound.

Dried peas contain 4 ounces of protein per pound. 

Peanuts contain 3 ounces of protein per pound. 

Dried beans contain 3 ounces of protein per pound. 

Cottage cheese contains 3 ounces of protein per pound. 

Fresh beef contains 2 to 3 ounces of protein per pound. 

Pork contains 2 ounces of protein per pound. 

Wheat contains 2 ounces of protein per pound. 

Eggs contain 2 ounces of protein per pound. 

Cornmeal contains li/4 ounces of protein per pound. 

There are a variety of dishes that may be made from 
either the parched or raw peanut that are delicious. The 
family is less apt to tire of the peanut flavor if the peanut 
dishes are served only occasionally.

Each year the sweet potato is becoming of greater im- 
portance as a food. The producers are now capable of 
handling successfully, not only the planting and harvesting, 
but also the storing and marketing. The demand for sweet 
potatoes has increased as the people have learned the va- 
riety of ways in which the potato may be used. Sweet po- 
tatoes can be canned successfully, thus providing a means 
of caring for the over-supply and at the same time making 
it possible to have them on the table out of season. 

The soil and climate of the southern states are peculiarly 
adapted to the cultivation of the sweet potato. Several va- 
rieties are grown, all of which can readily be classed under 
either of two distinct types, namely, a dry, mealy potato, 
or a moist potato, commonly called a yam. The dry, mealy 
one is planted especially for the northern markets, because 
of its keeping qualities. The moist potato contains a higher 
per cent of water, and will not keep for any length of time. 
For this reason, this type of potato is always confined to 
the southern markets. They are delicious, however. 

The sweet potato is not closely related to the white potato 
botanically, but, as you note by the table, the two potatoes 
are quite similar in composition. The greatest difference 
lies in the fact that the sweet potato contains from 5 to 8 
per cent more carbohydrate, principally in the form of 
sugar. This, alone, accounts for the increased fuel value 
of sweet potatoes when compared to the white (Irish) pota- 
toes.
