"/ never ate a better cake than that; you must give 
me the recipe for it," and a hundred similar compli- 
mentary references to the "good things" served at the 
"Teas" of The Woman's Club of San Mateo, inspired 
the publication of these "Recipes" in book form. 

The compilers are under so many obligations to the 
Club members who have contributed these "tried and 
true" formulas of favorite dishes, and to the friends of 
the Club who have so liberally assisted by appropriate 
advertising matter, that this expression of high appre- 
ciation is impelled as a "Thank you very much" to one 
and all. 

"Recipes of the Woman's Club of San Mateo" is the 
work of the Home Economic Section Department of 
Economics and is commended to all lovers of good 
things to eat and drink as a labor of love.

FRICASSEE OF FOWL 



Half roast a good sized chicken; take from oven and carve very neatly; 
remove the skin, keep the trimmings and put the nice pieces of chicken 
aside until wanted; then put into a saucepan a slice of bacon cut in dice, 
two carrots and a small onion sliced, a green pepper cut in small pieces, 
a sprig of parsley, a bay-leaf, thyme and salt to taste, and one tablespoon 
of butter. Let these simmer together for about twenty minutes and when 
well browned add a tablespoon of flour; let it cook thoroughly; then add a 
pint and one-fourth of stock and a wine-glassful of Marsala; then add the 
trimmings of the chicken, with the back cut up in small pieces and let the 
whole simmer for thirty minutes; strain and when cold put in the pieces of 
chicken and warm them up gradually by letting them simmer in the sauce 
for about three-quarters of an hour; serve as hot as possible, garnish with 
small slices of toast.

FRICASSEE CHICKEN (SPANISH STYLE) 

Chicken J cup pitted olives (ripe) 

Olive oil 1 can mushrooms 

1 large onion Cloves 

\ clove garlic, minced Bay leaves 

can tomatoes, strained 1 tablespoon Chili powder 

1 glass white wine Salt 

\ cup carrots Pepper 

Prepare a chicken as for fricassee; fry in olive oil and when golden brown 
add the onion, garlic, and fry with the chicken about ten minutes, then add 
tomatoes, wine, carrots cut small, olives, mushrooms, cloves, bay leaves, 
Chili powder, salt and pepper and one quart water; simmer slowly until 
chicken is tender; add more water if gravy boils down; cook wild or tame 
ducks or pigeons in the same manner, using claret instead of white wine. 

Mrs. F. G. A. 

BAKED CHICKEN 

Cut young chicken through the back, wash and flatten, put in baking 
pan with large pieces of butter in the joints of the legs and wings; dredge 
with flour, salt and pepper; bake in moderate oven from one to one and one- 
half hours; baste often with water and butter mixed; cover if the chicken gets 
too brown.

BAKED CHICKEN 

Disjoint two chickens, roll in flour and saute in butter to a slight brown; 
add to the chicken salt and pepper to taste; cover with boiling water and bake 
in the oven until tender; when ready to serve add mushrooms to the liquor 
and thicken with a tablespoon of flour. 

Mrs. Baker 

SOUTHERN GUMBO 

Saute one chicken and two slices of bacon until brown; pour over them 
three quarts of boiling water; add one onion and some sweet herbs tied in a 
cloth; simmer this gently for three hours and a half; strain off the soup, 
take off the fat, then put the bacon and chickens cut in small pieces into the 
liquor; add one-half teacup okra cut up; also one-half tea cup rice; simmer 
half an hour longer and just before serving add a glass of wine and one dozen 
oysters with their juice. 

Mrs. A. B. E. 

CHICKEN OR VEAL CROQUETTES 

3 cups finely minced meat (cooked) 3 tablespoons sweet cream 
cup rice (cooked) or gravy 

Juice of \ lemon Black pepper 

Slice of onion Cayenne 

Sprig of parsley, minced Salt 

Cracker crumbs Beaten egg 
Hot lard 

Mix the mince meat, rice and cream together; add the lemon juice, onion, 
parsley, pepper and salt; make in any shape desired; dip in cracker crumbs, 
then in beaten egg, then in cracker crumbs and fry in hot lard. 

Mrs. Jury 

Note: If the egg is beaten with a tablespoon of water, the croquettes can 
be dipped much more easily. Hot olive oil is much more wholesome for 
frying and is not any more expensive in the end, as fish may be fried at one 
time in it and allowed to cool and banana fritters or any sweetmeat the second 
time and the latter will not taste of the fish; in other words, olive oil does not 
retain the flavor of anything previously cooked in it.

CHICKEN TERRAPIN 

One chicken simmered in just as little water as possible until tender; 
cut meat in small pieces; put scant one-fourth cup of butter in saucepan

Remove the stuffing from the ducks before serving, as these vegetables are 
used only to season the ducks. Serve with orange or olive sauce; currant 
jelly should accompany a duck course.

BOBOTEE 

Meat is made more indigestible by second cooking; for this reason dishes 
made from left-over meat, such light dishes as Bobotee, Boudins, Cannelon 
and Croquettes, are not as good on account of the frying, and hashes are in- 
digestible on account of the long stewing of vegetables in butter. The recipe 
for Bobotee is as follows: Put two tablespoons of butter in a frying pan; 
slice into the pan half of a small onion and cook until soft; add two ounces 
of bread and a cupful of milk; take from the fire and let stand five minutes; 
blanch and chop eight sweet almonds; add these, a pint of cold cooked meat 
(chopped fine), a teaspoon of curry and three eggs (well beaten) to the 
ingredients in the frying pan; mix all well together; rub a deep pie dish with 
butter and the juice of a lemon; put the mixture into this and bake in a moder- 
ate oven for about twenty minutes; serve with boiled rice in a separate dish.

MEXICAN FRIJOLES 

Soak two cups of pink beans over night; in the morning add three times 
as much water as there are beans; add a small onion and boil until tender, 
but do not throw the liquid away; into a frying-pan not less than two inches 
deep put a large cooking spoon of fresh lard and allow it to become very 
hot; with a perforated spoon put the beans free from liquid gently in the 
frying-pan; it is best to remove the pan from the stove as the hot lard may 
drop on it and catch fire; after putting in as many beans as will absorb the 
lard place the pan over a hot fire and mix beans and lard thoroughly until 
the beans appear to have a coating of lard and begin to burst; add a small 
quantity of the liquid in which the beans were boiled and gently crush them 
but do not mash; add the remainder of the liquid and allow it to simmer 
for about half an hour or until the beans are of the right consistency either 
quite liquid or quite dry. Success depends upon observing the following 
rules: 

Do not add salt until the beans are boiled soft. The onion is not perceptible 
after cooking, only giving the beans a characteristic Mexican taste which no 
spice can produce. Have the lard at smoking point. Do not throw away 
the liquid in which the beans were soaked over night. Mexican Chili may 
be added if desired. May be warmed over several times.

agreeable addition. The sauce is made by heating the olive oil or butter in 
a heavy frying-pan and adding the onion, parsley, green pepper, mushrooms 
and tomatoes (all chopped fine); simmer for at least three-fourths of an hour; 
season with salt and pepper to taste and if for Spanish rice add the cayenne 
pepper, also half a teaspoon of Grandma's Spanish pepper. Either the 
fresh or the dry mushrooms may be used; if dry, soak a few moments in a

mushrooms may be omitted entirely. Very wholesome and satisfying for 
the Lenten season.

PEACOCK FAMILY FLOUR 

Of late years tremendous strides have been made in the manufacture 
of Flour. Modern machinery has cut an important figure and modern 
means of transportation have enabled the miller to obtain Wheat from 
all parts of the country, whereas, a few years ago he had to depend 
on the Wheat grown in his own particular locality. To get the very 
best results it requires a blending of several different grades of Wheat 
some for their gluten and strength, others for their color. In the manu- 
facture of our PEACOCK FLOUR we use only the finest grade of Wheat 
procurable, using a special process of our own, and we unhesitatingly 
claim that this Flour is the superior of any other in the market. 

Nothing is so disappointing as a poor batch of bread; but this Is 
impossible if Peacock Flour is used. We feel satisfied that if tried once 
no other Flour will ever be taken, as a substitute.

Filling 

Heat the water and add the butter and salt; when this boils stir in the flour; 
beat until there are no lumps and cook until the mixture leaves the side of 
the saucepan; allow it to cool; when nearly cold add the unbeaten eggs one 
at a time; beat in each one thoroughly before adding the next. After adding 
all, cover the mixture and let it stand for an hour; when ready to bake drop 
it by spoonfuls on buttered tins, leaving two or three inches space between; 
bake in a moderate oven for forty-five minutes. They should feel dry and 
crisp to the touch. When cold split and fill with whipped cream. If desired, 
they can be fried in deep fat like doughnuts. If you intend frying them use 
only a teaspoonful at a time. This makes eighteen cream puffs. 

Mrs. G. Grader 

Note : An agreeable variety can be made by whipping half a pint of cream 
until very stiff, then adding a cupful of preserved pineapple, both the liquid 
and fruit if the liquid is quite thick; otherwise put in only the fruit. If it 
is desired any sweeter add powdered sugar to taste. Do not fill the cream 
puffs until just before serving.

If rolled tubular shape tie in bunches with narrow ribbon. These are very 
attractive and may be served with sherbet, ice cream or chocolate; if rolled 
cornucopia shape they may be filled with whipped cream just before sending

HINTS FOR THE FILLING OF SANDWICHES 

Meats should be cooked until very tender for sandwiches; when sliced, 
the meat should be cut across the grain and as thin as possible; a filling 
of chopped corned-beef or ham is improved by the addition of mustard; 
use Worcestershire or horseradish sauce with roast beef or tongue; chopped 
capers, tomato sauce, catsup or mint sauce combine well with lamb; season 
chicken or veal with celery salt, and fish with lemon juice. 

Chopped meat or fish may be mixed with salad dressings or any well- 
prepared dressing; chopped celery, cress, cucumbers, tomatoes or olives 
may be used with meat and dressing; lettuce leaves are usually served whole, 
the edges barely showing outside the sandwiches; fruits may be used for 
filling and moistened with fresh fruit juice; the dried fruits should be chopped 
and stewed. 

Scented sandwiches are prepared by wrapping the butter to be used in 
a napkin and keeping it over night on beds of either violets, fragrant rose 
petals, clover blossoms or nasturtiums in a closely covered jar. 

Fresh fruit sandwiches are nice made with thin water wafers. 



CAVIAR SANDWICHES 

Four tablespoons caviar, 15 drops of onion juice and a few drops of lemon 
juice rubbed to a smooth paste and spread on thin slices of buttered bread.

\ cup grated American cheese Salt, paprika, mustard and 

anchovy essence 

Cream the butter and cheese together; add vinegar and season with salt, 
paprika, mustard and anchovy essence; spread mixture between thin slices 

of bread.

ARROWROOT BLANCMANGE (U. S. Army Hospital) 

Two tablespoons of arrowroot; two-thirds pint of hot water; two 
tablespoons of sherry or brandy; two teaspoons of sugar. Mix the 
arrowroot into a smooth paste with tablespoons of cold water. Add this 
to the hot water. Bring to a boil, stirring constantly till well blended and 
free from lumps. Let boil for ten minutes. Add the sugar and sherry or 
brandy. Beat up quickly and pour into a bowl or mould to cool. Arrow- 
root blancmange may be made with fresh hot milk or condensed milk diluted. 
If boiling water is used it causes the starch of the arrowroot, when first 
poured in, to form into lumps. Hence it is best to have the water not quite 
at boiling point. 

BEEF ESSENCE 

Cut the lean of beef into small pieces and place them in a wide-mouthed 
bottle securely corked, and then allow it to stand for several hours in a vessel 
of boiling water. This may be given to infants, who cannot take milk, in 
teaspoon doses, and in larger quantities to adults. 

BEEF JUICE 

Broil quickly some pieces of round or sirloin of a size to fit in the cavity 
of a lemon squeezer previously heated by being dipped in hot water. The 
juice, as it flows away, should be received into a hot wineglass, and, after 
being seasoned to the taste with salt and a little cayenne pepper, taken 
while hot. 

SAVOURY CUSTARD 

Add the yolks of two eggs to a cup of beef tea, with pepper and salt to 
taste. Butter a cup or jam pot, pour the mixture into it, and let it stand in 
a pan of boiling water till the custard is set. 



A GRUEL 

Beat an egg to a froth, add a wineglass of sherry, flavour with a lump 
of sugar, a strip of lemon peel, and a little grated nutmeg. Have ready some 
gruel, very smooth and hot, stir in the wine and egg, and serve with crisp 
toast. Arrowroot may be made in the same way. 



100 RECIPES OF THE 



HOME-MADE LIME WATER 

Pour two quarts of hot water over fresh, unslacked lime (size of a walnut), 
stir till slacked, let stand till clear and bottle. Often ordered with milk to 
neutralize acidity of the stomach. 

LINSEED TEA 

Whole linseed, white sugar, each one ounce; licorice root, one half ounce; 
lemon juice, two ounces. Mix. An agreeable demulcent. 

BRAN MUFFINS 

1 qt. bran cup molasses 

1 pt. white flour 2 teaspoons cooking soda 

1 pt. sweet milk 1 teaspoon salt 

Mix the bran and white flour and salt. Add molasses in which the cooking 
soda has been dissolved, and lastly the sweet milk; bake in a moderate oven 
twenty-five minutes. 

RICE WATER or MUCILAGE OF RICE 

Thoroughly wash one ounce of rice with cold water. Then macerate 
for three hours in a quart of water kept at a tepid heat, and afterwards boil 
slowly for an hour, and strain. A useful drink in dysentery, diarrhoea, and 
irritable states of the alimentary canal. It may be sweetened and flavoured 
in the same way as barley water. 

WHITE WINE WHEY OR POSSET 

To half pint of milk while boiling in a saucepan add one wineglass of 
sherry, and afterwards strain through a muslin cloth. Sweeten with pounded 
sugar according to taste. A useful diuretic drink in colds and mild febrile dis- 
orders. For a child, give a tablespoon every two or three hours. 

WINE JELLY (U. S. Army Hospital) 

One fourth box of gelatine (one half ounce); one-fourth cup of cold water; 
one-half cup of sugar; one-half cup sherry wine; one and one-fourth cup of 
boiling water; one small piece of cinnamon. Put the gelatine and cold water 
together in a dish large enough to hold the whole mixture. Let it soak for 
an hour, then pour the boiling water (in which the piece of cinnamon has been 
simmering) over the softened gelatine. Add the sugar and wine, strain 
through a clean cloth into a china or granite-ware mould, and cool in a refri- 
gerator or a pan of cold water.

THE WINES CALIFORNIA MAKES FAMOUS 

THE ALTA VISTA WINES are distinctly Californian and are not 
masqueraded under a foreign label for selling purposes. They are 
known by numbers and named after the district in California in which 
the grapes are cultivated. The use of foreign names, such as Sauternes, 
Margaux, Chauteau Yquem, etc., apply to that species of vine originally 
grown in the mother districts of the Old World, transplanted in those 
districts of California where climatic and other conditions are similar. 
THE ALTA VISTA WINES sell on their superior California merit.
