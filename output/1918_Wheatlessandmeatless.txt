THIS IS WHAT 

THE FOOD ADMINISTRATOR URGES. 
IS THIS LITTLE TOO MUCH? 

The wise and careful use of butter, fat, and milk. 

The substitution of other fats for butter in cook- 
ing. 

The substitution, wherever possible, of other 
cereals for wheat. 

The use of fish, eggs, and cheese to reduce the 
demand for beef, pork, and mutton. 

The more extensive use of vegetables and fruits. 
Waste must be eliminated. 

Perishable foods locally grown must be consumed 
more freely. 



FOREWORD 

Our object in the preparation of this little book at 
this critical time in our nation's history, when the 
conservation of food by the women of the country 
is a part of our battle array, is to put before the 
housewives of America, at low cost, recipes for 
dishes so simple, nourishing, and attractive that the 
matter of reducing the household expenditure and 
the preserving of the food supply will be an in- 
teresting pastime rather than a disagreeable experi- 
ment. 

We have not gone into the matter of food values 
as we feel that the average housewife from her own 
experience will realize from the recipes themselves 
their substantial qualities. 

Once introduced into the family circle they are 
certain to make many friends who will cling to them 
long after the war is over. 

The practical self-denial of our meatless and 
wheatless days is strengthening the arms and the 
hearts of all Americans at home in a peaceful land 
or abroad in the turmoil of war, as well as sending 
food to thousands stripped of the very necessities 
of existence. 

We offer you this little volume with the hope that 


Vll 



viii FOREWORD 



it may prove a helpful guide in your daily efforts to 
do your bit in your household, and in a larger way 
assist our Nation and our Allies by pointing the way 
toward a reasonable self-sacrifice possible to every 
man, woman, and child whose heart "follows the 
flag."

GENERAL DIRECTIONS 



All measurements used in these recipes are level. 



Each recipe will serve six persons ; those for hot 
breads, cakes and muffins are large enough to be 
served more than once. 



Wherever the recipes require fat, any of the 
vegetable fats, of which there are many excellent 
ones on the market today, may be used. In place 
of the butter in any recipes, butterine, oleomar- 
garine, or any of the good butter substitutes may be 
used. 



Wherever milk is required, skimmed milk may 
be used with success although it must be remembered 
that the food value is lowered. Any reliable brand 
of canned milk may be used if desired. 

All recipes have been tested, and if carefully fol- 
lowed may be relied upon to give perfect results.

This is a digital copy of a book that was preserved for generations on library shelves before it was carefully scanned by Google as part of a project 
to make the world's books discoverable online. 

It has survived long enough for the copyright to expire and the book to enter the public domain. A public domain book is one that was never subject 
to copyright or whose legal copyright term has expired. Whether a book is in the public domain may vary country to country. Public domain books 
are our gateways to the past, representing a wealth of history, culture and knowledge that's often difficult to discover.

THIS IS WHAT 

THE FOOD ADMINISTRATOR URGES. 

IS THIS UTTLE TOO MUCH? 

The wise and careful use of butter, fat, and milk. 

The substitution of other fats for butter in cook- 
ing. 

The substitution, wherever possible, of other 
cereals for wheat. 

The use of fish, eggs, and cheese to reduce the 
demand for beef, pork, and mutton.

FOREWORD 

Our object in the preparation of this little book at 
this critical time in our nation's history, when the 
conservation of food by the women of the country 
is a part of our battle array, is to put before the 
housewives of America, at low cost, recipes for 
dishes so simple, nourishing, and attractive that the 
matter of reducing the household expenditure and 
the preserving of the food supply will be an in- 
teresting pastime rather than a disagreeable experi- 
ment. 

We have not gone into the matter of food values 
as we feel that the average housewife from her own 
experience will realize from the recipes themselves 
their substantial qualities. 

Once introduced into the family circle they are 
certain to make many friends who will cling to them 
long after the war is over. 

The practical self-denial of our meatless and 
wheatless days is strengthening the arms and the 
hearts of all Americans at home in a peaceful land 
or abroad in the turmoil of war, as well as sending 
food to thousands stripped of the very necessities 
of existence. 

We offer you this little volume with the hope that

it may prove a helpful guide in your daily efforts to 
do your bit in your household, and in a larger way 
assist our Nation and our Allies by pointing the way 
toward a reasonable self-sacrifice possible to every 
man, woman, and child whose heart "follows the 
flag."

GENERAL DIRECTIONS 

All measurements used in these recipes are level. 

Each recipe will serve six persons ; those for hot 
breads, cakes and muffins are large enough to be 
served more than once. 



Wherever the recipes require fat, any of the 
vegetable fats, of which there are many excellent 
ones on the market today, may be used. In place 
of the butter in any recipes, butterine, oleomar- 
garine, or any of the good butter substitutes may be 
used. 



Wherever milk is required, skimmed milk may 
be used with success although it must be remembered 
that the food value is lowered. Any reliable brand 
of canned milk may be used if desired. 

All recipes have been tested, and if carefully fol- 
lowed may be relied upon to give perfect results.
