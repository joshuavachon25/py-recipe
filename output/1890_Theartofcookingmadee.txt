wheat oakes. Beat it well, and let it rise till breakfast time.

small brown cakes. Bake a light brown.

ing Powder. Butter the size of a small hen's egg is enough

quarters of a.n inch in thickness ; cut into round cakes, and set

Afn. Starkweather. 

Hare the water boiling, take oflf the stove and set in a wann plaet 

^the stove hearth will answer) ; put in the eggs and cover the vewel 

closely ; let them simmer nine minates ; they are then cooked eTenly 

and weU. ^ „_ _.„ 

BAKED OMELET. 

Afr*. Woodruff 
Six eggs, whites and yolks beaten separately and very light J • t«» 
eap of warm milk with a tableapoonful of butter melted in it ; • tabla- 
spoonful of flour, one teaspoonful of salt, a little pepper ; mix t«geth<t

apoonful of flour, one onion oliopped fine, chopped parsley, seaaonwltt 
X)epper and salt. Have butter melted in a spider, when th»ometot li 
brown, turn it over. Double when served. 

OMELET WITH HAM. 

Make a plain omelet, and just before turning one half over 
other, sprinkle over it some finely-chopped ham. Oarnuh with sm 
slices of ham. Jelly or marmalade may be added in tlu 

TO POACH EGGS. 

Have the water well salted, and not let it boU hard. Break the 
eggs separately into a saucer, and slip gently into the water ; when 
nicely done, remove with a skimmer, trim neatly and lay each em 
upon a small, thin square of buttered toast, then sprinkle with salt 
and pepper. Some perMUS prefer them poached, rather than ftiad, 
with ham, in which case, substitute the ham for toart. * 

STUFFED E6G8. 

Boil the eggs hard, remove the sheila, and then cut in two, either 
way, as preferred. Remove the yolks, and mix with them pepper, 
salt, and a little dry mustard -some like cold chicken, ham, ortong^io, 
chopped very fine— and then stuff the cavities, smooth them, and put 
the halves together again. For picnics, they can simply be wrapped 
in tUsue paper to keep them together. If for home use, they chn bo 
egged and bread^srembed, and l)rowned in boiling lard ; dram, and 
garnish with parsley. gQ^ ^OAST.

Cat the heart out of a large cabbage ; take cold chicken or any 
odd meat, and chop very fine, and season highly, and mix with the 
plk of an egg ; fill the cabbage with this stuffing, and then tie it

We must not forget beans which abound so much in nourish-

ahoul'd be boiled about five hours, seasoned then withcreair or butter 
and with salt, they ought to be relished by everybody. However 1 
Siy have seMoned this soup, my children always wish to add milk 
BTion their plates. Baked beans must be either boiled until ye^ soft 
/Wore baking, or must be baked a long time-from three to six hours,

a perfectly smooth paste, add the oil, mustard, vinegar, pepper and 
salt, blending each until perfectly incorporated. Five minutes 
before wanting for table, pour upon chicken and celery, and mix 
all together. If the dressing is put on long before using, the salad 
will be tough and hard.

Six eggs beaten very light ; half teacup melted butter ; one 
coffee cup of cream ; one tablespoon mustard ; little salt ; one tea- 
spoon sugar ; one cup vinegar. Put dressing in dish and float in

96 THE ART OF COOKING MADE EASY. 

SPICED PEARS OR PEACHES. 
Ten pounds of frait, five poun's of sugar, one-half pint of 
vinesar ; maoe, cinnamon and cloves, Ved in a bag : boil the pears 
until clear ; then scald thoroughly in the syrup ; boil it down and 
pour over the pears. 

SPICED PLUMS. 
One peck of plums, seven pounds of sugar, spice to taste ; let 
boil down thick ; before taking from the fire add one pint vinegar. 

PICKLED CHERRIES. 

Take nice, large, ripe cherries; remove the stones; take a 
large, g'ass jar, and fill two-thirds full of cherries, and fill up with 
beat vinegar ; keep it well covered ; no boil'ng or spice is necessary, 
as the cherry flavor will be retained, and the cherries will not 
shrivel. 

PICKLED PEACHES. 

One gallon of vinegar, four pounds of brown sugar ; take cling- 
stone peaches, rub them with a flannel, stick two or three cloves in 
each ; put them into a glass or earthen vessel, and pour the liquor 
on them boiling hot ; cover them, and let them stand a week or ten 
days ; then pour off the liquor and boil it as before, after which, 
return it boiJing to the peaches, which should be covered closely. 
Let the vinegar and sugar, in the first place, just come to a boil. 

SWEET PICKLED PEACHES. 
Select ripe, but firm fruit, free from blemishes ; peel them care- 
fully ; allow a pound of sugar to a pint of good cider vinegar ; place 
cloves and cinnamon in a bag, and boil in the vinegar ; when the 
vinegar has come to a boil, drop in the peaches (a few at a time), 
and let them remain till done through, but not soft or broken ; then 
remove them carefully with a skimmer, and place them in jars ; 
repeat this process till all are done ; then fill up the jars with the 
remaining vinegar, and seal while warm. In tha same manner maiy 
be made sweet pickled pears, pluni^s, crab-apples, amd cherries. 

PICKLED PLUMS. 

Wash the p^ums clean and put into jars, and for two quarts of 
plums make a rich syrup of two pounds of sugar, one pint of vin- 
egar, with spice ; put the plums in jars, and pour over them the 
hot syrup. 

PICKLED CANTALOUPES. 

Select those of rough rind and quite ripe ; take out the seeds, 
pare, and cut them in tmaXl square pieces, and cover with good 
elder vinegar ; let them stand 24 hours ; then pour off part of the 
vinegar ; to every quart of the remainder add three pounds of 
sugar, and put them upon the stove and oimmer slowly until a fork 
will go through them easily, and they look clear ; then add one 
ounce of ground cloves.

BLACKBERRY JAM. 
M. A. T. 
To each pound of fruit add three-fourths of a pound cf sugar ; 
mash each separately ; then put together and boil from one-half to 
three-fourths of an hour. 

SIBERIAN CRAB JELLY. 
■ Mrs. W. Arthur. 
Boil a peck of crabs for two hours in as much water as will 
cover them, then put them into a jelly bag and allow to drain (do 
not squeeze them); to each pint of syrup put one pound of loaf 
sugar, and boil for half an hour ; select the reddest crabs you can 
find, and the jelly will be a beautiful color. 

APPLES FOR PRESENT USE. 
Mrs. Joseph Saulltr, 
Take about twenty nice snow or other cooking apples and wipe 
them clean, and place them in a preserving kettle with water enough 
to about half cover them ; then add two cups of sugar, half a cup of 
vinegar, and a dessertspoonful ground cinnamon ; cover them down 
tight' y, and let them simmer over a slow fire until the apples beoome 
soft : use them cold. 

RASPBERRY JAM. 

To five or six pounds of fine red raspberries (not too ripe) add an 
equal quantity of the finest quality of white sugar ; mash the whole 
well in a preserving kettle ; add about one quart of currant juice (a 
little less will do), and boil gently until it jellies upon a cold plate ; 
then put into small jars, cover with brandied paper, and tie a thick 
white paper over them ; keep in a dark, dry and cool place. 

QUINCE JAM. 

Mrs. P. B. Ayer. 

Boil your fruit in as little water as possible, until soft enough 

to break easily ; pour off all the water and rub with a spoon until 

entirely smooth ; to one pound of the quinces add ten ounces of 

brown sugar, and boil twenty minutes, stirring often. 

GREEN GAGE PLUMS. 
After stemming and washing the fruit, fill the jars full, placing 
them in a boiler of cold water, just enough not to have the water 
boil over the top of tne jars into the fruit ; after boiling one-half 
hour, or until the fruit begins to be tender, lift out the jars, and 
turn off the juice that may accumulate into a porcelain kettle, add 
sufiicient sugar to make a rich syrup ; when it boils fill up the jars, 
let them stand in the boiling water ten or fifteen minutes longer ; 
then lift out, one at a time, and seal. All kinds of plums are nice 
put up in tb : same manner. 

GRAPES. 

Stew, wash and weigh the fruit ; for preserves add one pound 

of sugar to a pound of fruit ; for canning, one-half pound of sugar to 

a pound of fruit, and remove the pulp ; put the skins and pulp into 

' separate dishes, cook the pulp and strain through a sieve ; then add 

\ Little sticks kindle a fire, great ones put it out.

OREAMATED APPLES. 
Choose apples that will cook nicely, that is, will cook without 
breaking into pieces ; pare and core them whole ; make a syrup with 
a pound of sugar and a pint of water; put in the apples and boil 
gently until about three-fourths done; skim them out, and place 
them for a few minutes in a quick oven ; boil down the syrup, and 
when the apples are taken from the oven and are still hot, fill the 
centre with marmalade, and roll each apple in the syrup, put them 
on a dish in the form of a dome, or as you may desire, and pour over 
them a meringue of eggs and sugar, and set into the oven to brown. 

QUINCE PRESERVES. 
Pare, core, and quarter the fruit; boil in clear water enough to 
cover until they are tender ; make a syrup with two pounds of sugar 
and a pint of water; when boiling hot, add the quinces : allow three- 
quarters of a pound of sugar to a puund of fruit ; use parings and 
cores for jelly. 

PiNE APPLE JAVf. 

Mrs. P. B. Ayer.

For every pound of wool, silk or cotton, take four ounces of 
cudbear, pour a suffioient quantity of boiling water, let it stand a few 
minutea to get a deep purple color; thou immerse the wool or yarn 
into the dye ; when sufficiently dyed put it on the fire and boil 
briskly for a quarter of an hour ; then diasolve in a separate vessel 
two ounces of salt of tartar, in a sufficient quantity of rain water to 
cover the cloth, then take it out and place it by the fire to dry, 

BLACK. 
On Wool, Silk or Cotton.— For every pound of cloth it will 
require one ounce of extract of logwood and half an ounce of blue 
vitriol. Prepare an iron kettle with a sufficient <iuantity of water 
to admit th9 yarn or cloth to be worked in the dye without being 
crowded— bring the water to a scalding heat-then put in the yarn 
or cloth a few minutes— when it is thoroughly wet, take it out and 
drain It— m the next place add the blue vitriol, and when dissolved, 
and the water skimmed carefully, put in the material to be colored 
and let It remain half an hour at a scalding heat, aiilug it occasion- 
ally— then take It out and rinse it in soft water— the vitriol water 
may now be emptied into a separate vessel, and the extract of log- 
wood dissolved in a sufficient quantity of water, brought to a scald- 
ing heat and skimmed— put in the cloth, keeping the dye at the 
same temperature, and let it remain half an hour, airing it frequently 
-then take It out and drain it-add the vitriol water to the dye, 
and put t in again and let it remain fifteen minutes, airing ai 
before— cleanse it well. 

PINK. 

For every three pounds of yarn or cloth, take three and a-haU 

quarts of water, or enough to cover the articles you wish to color, two 

ounces of cochineal and half an ounce of cream tartar-steep the

■tirriog it briskly till it has boiled one-half an hour ; should be well 
rinsed and washed in clear water to prevent the dye from making 
it tender after coloring. 

Yellow. — For five pounds of cloth diarolve one-balf pound 
sugar of lead in a tub of warm water and twelve u'tnces of bichromate 
of potash in another tub of cold water ; soak, rir.ee, and wring the 
cloth in the lead water first, then in the other, and return from the 
other, till the right shade of color is obtained. 

Orange. — Dip the yellow-colored cloth into strong lime water, 
if it should not turn, boil it ; rinse all well, 

Green. — Put your blue cloth in the yellow dye in the same man- 
ner as for coloring yellow ; old calico will take a dark shade of blue 
or green in the same dye with the white cloth. 

CRIMSON. 
Use one pound of lac dye, togethi r with two ounces of madder 
compound, to every two pounds of cloth or yarn ; soak the lac dye 
over night in a brass or copper kettle, then add the compound and 
stir ; then the cloth, and bring your dye slowly to a scalding heat ; 
vary the time as you wish the color — if dark let it remain some hours; 
if not, one hour ; rinse it in soft spring water, without soap. 

MADDER RED. 
Take one pound of madder for every two pounds of yam or 
cloth ; soak the madder in a brass or copper kettle one night in warm 
water, enough to cover the yarn you wish to color ; next morning put 
in two ounces of madder compound for every pound of madder which 
you have soaked — then wet your yarn or cloth with clean water and 
wring it out — afterwards put it in the dye— now place the kettle 
over the fire, and bring it slowly to a scalding heat, which will take 
about half an hour— keep it at this heat half an hour if light red is 
wanted, and longer if a dark one, the color depending upon the time 
it remains in the dye. When the color is made, rinse the oloth 
immediately in cold water, and it will then be finished. 

SCARLET. 
Very Superior. — Three ounces of cochineal, three ounces of 
cream of tartar, and four ounces of solution of tin ; powder the 
cochineal and rub through a bag into blood warm water sufficient to 
cover the yam, when it is a little vrarm put in the cream of tartar and 
simmer ; then add the solution of tin — your yarn must be wet with 
dean water— steep it in the dye till the yarn is properly dyed. 
Dry your yarn before you wash it. This will color three pounds. 

SCARLET RED. 
Take soft water sufficient to cover the oloth or yam you wish to 
color, bring it to a boiling heat in a copper or brass kettle, then add 
one ounce and a-half of cream of tartar for every pound of oloth ; 
now boil a minute or two, and then add two ounces uf powdered lao, 
and three ounces of madder compound (the lac and oomponnd mast 
be previously mixed in a glass or earthen bowl), broil five mlaat^ ' 
now wet the yam in warm water, and wring it, and put in the dy^ 
boil the whole nearly an hour ; take the yarn or oloth out and : '

For every pound of yam or cloth add three and a-half ounces of 
Jum and one pound of fustic ; steep to get the strength, but not to 
Bil ; soak the cloth until it acquires a good yellow color ; then throw 
it the chips and add the indigo compound slowly, ai..il you have 
tie desired shade of green. 

BROWN. 
For each pound of wool take a quarter pound of alum and two 
mces of cream of tartar, and boil for half an hour. Take half n 
3und of red powder, quarter pound of fustic and two ounces of log- 
rood. Soak these a night in sufficient warm water to cover the 
pool ; take the wool out of the alum water and boil with the woods 
Dr about half an hour. If a dark brown is wanted, add about a 
kblespoonful of copperas. 

YELLOW. 

One pound of wool or cloth, three-quarters of a pound o' fustic, 
Inarter pound of alum; put all into an earthen vessel and pour on suf- 
|cient hot water to cover the wool and keep it warm all ni^ht ; give 
half ac hour's boil in a brass kettle and then rinse in cold water. 
Lmuch deeper and richer yellow may be made by using turmeric pow- 
er instead of fustic, and proceeding in the same manner. 

TO DYE A FINE WINE COLOR. 

One pound of wool, half pound red powder, one oanoe of madder

color almost as Sue may be had by using quarter pound of alum, 
id boiling in the same way. 

TO DYE A SALMON COLOR. 
One pound of wool — a quarter of a pound of anatto, and a-quarter 
Df a pound of soap. Take water sufficient to cover the wool, in which 
ilissolve the anatto and soap ; rinse the wool in warm water, put into 
the anatto mixture, and boil about half an hour. The shade mav be

POISONS. 



PoHona may be claaeifind under two distinct heads :— Mineral 
and Vrgetahle. Mineral poisons are irritating and corrosive in tlieir 
oction. They produce a metallic taste in the mouth; bumfng pains 
in tiie throat, stomach and bowelRj and, often, violent retching and 
bloody vomiting, purging, cramps, cold sweats, and great depression. 
Vegetable poisons are chiefly naroctios, and many of them are as 
virulent us any mineral in the mineral liingdom . They cause giddi- 
ness, drowsiness, stupor, inaonsibility or delirium, and oppressed 
breathing. *^*^ 

GENERAL OIIIECTIONS. 
First and instantly dilute the poison with large draughts of 
warm water, either ckar, or, if the particular poison is known, con- 
taining the proper antidote. This wH usually cause vomiting 
which IS to be desired. If vomiting uods not soon occur, excite it 
Protect, a-) much as possible, the lining membrane of the 
stomach and bowels from contact with the poison by large and 
frequent doses of sweet oil, mucilage or gum arable, flax seed 
tea, millt, etc. Melted cosmoline, vaseline, butter, or lard, will 
serve for this purpose. Keep up the temperature by means of 
warm blankets, hot bottles, etc., and if there are marked evi- 
deuces of sinking, such as a failure of the pulse, or very feeble, 
gasping respiration, give a little stimuluc, preferably by injection 
Into the bowels. In the cano of an adult, a tablespoonful of brandy 
whiakey, or gin, with an equal quantity of water, may be admlnia- 
i. red in this manner, every five or ten minutes, until reaotion setn 
in— that Is, until tne face regains its color, the pulse becomes 
stronger, and the breathing natural. A general antidote ■'' 
cases of poisoning, where the nature of the poison is unknowi., . ; , 
mixture of carbonate of magneaia, povv ored charcoal, and h' /• » i 
sesquioxide of iron, equal parts, in water. 

MINERAL POISONS. 
/ M ^.'^'^^{{—^^riatic (spirit of salt), nitric (aqua fortis), sulphuric 
toil of vitriol), oxahc, nitro-muriatic, etc. Nitric and sulphurio 
ac.'lr ra sometimes used for the removal of warts; oxalic acid ia 
often L'j'ed tor taking out iron or ink stains; muriatic and nitro- 
mur.fltir i^ re fj.-«iiontly prescribed medicinally. As soon as a 
roisenv.s,^ .0 bai^ nien swallowed, do not give emetics, but seek 
for ro.-.rlit ; ; ,. . ioh will p utralize the acid. Powdered chalk, 
whit, lig, V nv fsid,, or lime i > „ped from a wall and stirred in water 
may bo given ia any of these cases. Fur sulphuric or muriatic acid, 
also administer soap suds, sweet milk, common soap cut into small 
pieces, baking or washing soda, or saleratus, giving these latter in 

of the stomach, from the evolution of gas. In the case of suiphurio 
acid, water must not be used freely at first, at least not unless it 
contains some antidote, as the heat produced when this aoid and 
water are mixed, is sufficient of itself to cause serious damase. Give

Lead, Salts of {Sugar of Lead, Lead Paint).— After an emetio, 
- administer as much Epsom salt, or Glauber's salt, as the patient can 
drink. Then give large qaantities of milk and whites of eggs. 

Muriates of Tin and Zinc.—Theae poisons are sometimes found 
in canned goods— fruits, vegetables, fish, and meats. They cause 
nausea, vomiting, sudden failure of the vital forces, and sometimee 
cramps and convulsions. Milk, the whites of eggs, strong tea, or 
tincture of peruvian bark, should be given. After the violent 
symptoms have subsided the patient should drink freely of flaxseed 
tea or barley water. 

Prussic ^cirf.— Liquor of ammonia, in doses of ten drops to « 
tablespoonful of water, should be given every fifteen minutes, until 
the patient is out of dauber. Also apply smelling salts to the nose, 
^ dash cold water in the face, and give stimulants. 

Verdigris.— Give sugar, milk, and whites of eggs in large 
^ . quantities, then ^.trong tea, but no acids of any kind. 

VEGETABLE POISONS. 
Aconite,DigitaUs,Lohelia, Tobacco, Veratrum {album and viride) 
—their alkaloids, salts and preparations. — Give emetic of mustard 
(a tablespoonful, stirred to a cream with water), followed by large 
draughts of warm water. Give strong tea or coffee, with powdered 
, charcoal; stimulants (whisky, etc.), freely, warmth to the extremi- 
ties; keep the patient in a horizontal position; use artificial respira- 
tion peraist^tly. 

Alcd^Benzin, Benzol, Camphor, Carbon bisulphide. Chloral, 
Chloroform, Ether, Hydrocyanic Acid, its compounds and prepara- 
tions.— It necessary, give an emetic of mustard (a tablespoonful, 
stirred to a cream with water). Let patient have plenty of fresh airj 
maintain a horizontal position. Keep the body warm, but try to 
rouse the patient by ammonia to nostrils, oold douche io the head, 
friction and mustard plasters to limbs, etc. Use artificial respira- 
tion. Bromide of Potash, in doses of fifteen to thirty grains every 
two or three hours, will also be found useful. 

Cocaine is the alkaloid of the coca plant of South American 
origin. It is generally employed in the form of muriate of cocaine, 
and principally used as a local ansesthetio. It should only be used 
under the direction of a physician. It may occasion danger- 
ous effects even in doses usually deemed safe. When it baa 
been taken btemally, the proper antidote is a powerful emetic, fol- 
lowed by stimulants— such as liquor and Bpirita of ammonia- 
administered internally. When it has been used to a dangerooi 
extent externally, give whisky or brandy and ammonia. 

Hemlock (the plant, Conium).—8ee Laudanum, etc. 

* Jamestown or Jimson Weed (Stram^niu,n).—See Laudanam, eto. 

Oil oj Bitter Almonds contains Hydrocyanic (Prussic) acid, and 
is therefore highly poisonous. See Prussic Acid, under the head of 
Mineral Poisons, this deadly drug being usually obtained from min- 
eral Bonroes.

I powder) mixed with two tablespoonfuls of vinegar (do not (Ave 
soda or potash to neutralize She acid). Promote vomiting by lirce

nitrate of biamutb, and pepsine, five grains each, to allay nausea. 
In giving an antidote, never wait for it to dissolve. Jast stir it 
up in any mild fluid at liand, xoept oil, and let it be swallowed 
immediately. 

Poisoning by swallowmg powdered Cantharides {Spanish Flies). — 
Used for blistering and also as a medicine to be taken internally. 
When a poisonous dose has been swallowed give immediately large 
draughts of sweet oil, sugar and \frater, milk, or flaxseed tea, and 
call a physician. 

Poisoning by the common Poison Vine {Ivy or Oak), Sumach, and 
other j)oisonou8 plants, causes red blotches and blisters on the skin, 
with great itching and burning. When the skin is not seriously 
affected it may be bathed freely with spirits of nitre or extract of 
tag alder or witch hazel ; but, in severe oases, the liquor of the 
sub-acetate of lead — one part to three parts of rose-water— should 
be applied every hour or two, allowing the solution to dry on the 
skin. It is also recommended to apply cloths soaked in a solution 
of soda— a tablespoonful of soda to a teacupful of hot water; also, 
to dust with magnesia or ordinary toilet powder. Persons working 
where ivy grows may sometimes prevent its poisonous effeotH by 
anointing the hands and face with olive oiL 

Poisoned Meats.— TaxcA&di meats, and the flesh of diseased 
animals, wben used for food, produce the same symptoms as irritant 
poisons. Drink freely of warm water until vomiting occurs, and 
take a full dose of Strong's Cathartic Pills. The patient's 
strength must be susstained by stimulants. Place over the bowels 
a mustard poultice, or hot flumel sprinkled with turpentine. If the 

Eain is severe, take fifteen to twenty-five drops of laudanum, every 
our, until relieved. 

Potash and other Alkalies. — The powerful caustic effects pro- 
duced, on the skin, by Potash, Quick-Iime, and Caustic Ammonia, 
may be relieved by applying lemon juice or weak vinegar. 



May good digestion wait oo afipetite.
