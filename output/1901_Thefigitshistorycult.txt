LETTER OF TRANSMITTAL 



U. S. Department of Agriculture, 

Division of Pomology, 
Washington^ D, (7., June H^ 1901, 
Sir: I have the honor to transmit herewith, and to recommend for 
publication as a bulletin of this division, the manuscript of an article 
on The Fig: Its History, Culture, and Curing, with a descriptive cata- 
logue of the known varieties of figs, prepared b}^ Dr. Gustav Eisen, of 
San Francisco, Cal. 

Dr. Eisen is too well known as an author of high standing to need 
any introduction to the horticultural world. His name carries with it 
a guaranty of the value of this, his latest work. 

The recent successful introduction of the blastophaga into the fig- 
growing sections of the United States by the Department of Agricul- 
ture almost certainly assures the production of first-class Smyrna figs, 
which will doubtless greatly encourage and stimulate the industry, 
and thereby create an increase in the demand for reliable literature 
on the subject. 

This comprehensive treatise contains information of value to the 
scientific and practical fruit grower never before published in the form 
in which it is here presented. 

Very respectfully, G. B. Brackett, 

Pomologist 
Hon. James Wilson, 

* Secretary.

PREFACE. 



The earliest observations ouwliicli this bulletin is based werebej^un 
man}^ years ago, during tlie author's visit to the fig districts of the 
Mediterranean countries. Later on investigations were made in Mex- 
ico, Central America, and California, principally in the latter. 

My researches have been greatly aided by many friends and sympa- 
thizer. Among the officials of the United States Department of Agri- 
culture I have received much help and encouragement from Dr. L. O. 
Howard, Chief of the Division of Entomology, while Col. Gustavus B. 
Brackett and Mr. William A. Taylor, the former. Chief and the latter 
Assistant Pomologist, have assisted me in every possible manner at 
much sacrifice of their own valuable time. Mr. E. A. Schwarz, of the 
Division of Entomology, has given me much information about the 
Blastophaga, and helped me in regard to the literature, from which he 
has made extracts for my use. Mr. Newtx)n B. Pierce, of the Division 
of Vegetable Physiology and Pathology, has contributed two photo- 
graphs taken by him in Sicily. The Paddock & Fowler Compan}^ of 
New York, has kindl}'^ given me for publication a number of photo- 
graphs illustrating the packing of figs, etc. , taken by them for special 
use in this bulletin. From foreign scientists I have received aid from 
Graf Solms-Laubach, of Germany, and from Dr. Paul Mayer, of 
Naples, both having sent me rare and valuable caprifigs for trial in 
this country. In California I have repeatedly had assistance from 
Mr. E. W. Maslin, Mr. Felix Gillet, Mr. George O. Mitchell, Mr. John C. 
Jones, Mr. G. P. Rixford, and Dr. W. J. V. Osterhout. lam especially 
indebted to Mr. John Rock, of Niles, without whose assistance this 
bulletin could never have been published in its present form. Besides 
his own collection of figs he has also cared for that imported by the 
United States Government from the Royal Horticultural Society of 
London, both collections having been at my disposal for experiment 
and study. Dr. Peder S. Bruguiere, of San Francisco, has taken for 
my use a number of photographs illustrating figs and fig trees, some 
of which are used in this memoir. To these gentlemen, as well as to 
all others who have aided me in my work, I wish here to express my 
gratitude.

THE FIG: ITS HISTORY, CULTURE, AND CURING. 



CHAPTER I. 
INTRODUCTORY. 

NAME AND DERIVATION. U^ 

V ^ 

The English word "fig" is of very ancient origin, and is derived -^ 
from the Latin " ficus^j and the yet older Hebrew name "feg." The\ 
English word must have originated during the Roman invasion of 
England, when probably the first fig trees~were planted in English ^TTTv-^'' 
soil. As early ag 1250 the word was in general use in a commercial JX^^;;^' 
sense, as ' ' figges " or * ' f egges " constituted one of the products tJ. I '\ ^, \3 
regularly imported into England, especially from Portugal and Spain. *'^^ i '^^ 

The wild fig, the ancestor of the edible fig Tace,*ls miKhowfTTn ^ —^ T {.■ -^ 
English-speaking countries, except, of course, where found as botan- ^X^^" 
ical specimens. In the semit ropical Med it erranean districts this wild <^ ^^c.^^ ' 
fig is met everywhere except in the north of Italy and the Riviera .^-^ 
and in the south of France. In Italy the wild fig is known as the 
"profico," "ft^o^elvaggio," or "caprtfieus," the last name being 
derived from capra (goat) and ficus (fig), and indicating th^^wortt^^ C^^y' 
lessness of the^fruit for eating purposes. From "caprificus" i^^ :- -- ; . ^ 
^rived our name "caprifig" and the French "caprifiguier." Iii ^[^ - 
Spain it is known, in some districts, at least, as the "caprahigo." In\^^ 
Greece it is called "erineos," while the edible fig is there known 
as "sycon" (ctvkov). In Hebrew the edible fig was "teena," in 
Aramaic "t^na," and in Arabic it is ^' tin." It may not be out of 
place also to note that the name of another celebrated fig variety, the 
" Sycamore, ^fJEgypt, is derived from the Greek "sycon" (fig) and 
"moro" (mulberry), meaning mulberry ffg, on^accbunt of the peculiar 
arrangement of the fruit. What we in the United States incorrectly 
call "sycamore" is really not a sycamore, but a plane tree. 

The various crops of the fig, as well as of the caprifig, are also 
given different names in different countries. In these pages refer- 
ence is made to the wild fig as ''caprifi^jj' meaning thereby only the 
male tree of Ficus carica L.^ while the word fig will always refer to 
the edible fig, or the cultivated race of the same species.

N>^ HOME AND distribution OF THE FIG INDUSTRY. 

r^ The probable home of the edible fig ^ is in the fertile part of aonthe^p 

Arabia, wliere at present jthe caprifiy is wild^ and where there are no 
traditions of its introduction. From south Arabia the Bahra tribe* 
is said to liave brought the fig to ancient Id uma ea and to Coelesyria,^ 
whence it was carried by other tribes and races_to__S£ria and the 
A Mediterranean shores. The march of the fig was slow and undoubtedly 
^required many centuries to reach the shores^f tTTe Mediterranean 
coast. Once there, the facilities for transportation and the extensive 
trade and voyages of the maritime nations greatly facilitated its fur- 
ther distribution. 

But while it is probable that the home of the edible fig is to be 
found igj^gabia Felix, it is even more likely that the home of the fig 
indu stry is to be looked for elsewhere. Nearly all the southern culti- 

;ted fruits which we now possess appear to have originated some- 
where inwestern Asia. Almonds, nuts, apricots, peaches, olives, 
Asiatic grapes, dates, figs, prunes, etc., all seem to have been brought 
to great perfection in a country somewhere in Asia, but now unknown 
to us. The bringing to great perfection of so many varieties of fruit 
indicates a very high state of_civilization of very: old -date, compared 
to which the Republics of Greece and Home must be considered 
modern. Through the very latest arclifeqlogjcal discoveries we now 
know that such a civilization existed as far back as ten thousand 
years ago in western Asia, in the valleysofjhe Euplirates'a nd TigrisT 
Nowhere else have archaeologists been able to trace such an ancient 
and remarkable civilization; and, as the origin of so many of om- 
it fruits, vegetables, cereals, and domestic animals point to a west- 
Asiatic origin, it is not too much to presume that in the most ancient 
civilization of Nippur dwelt the originators of nearly all those eco- 
nomic vegetables, as well as animal products, on which man, in all 
temperate regions, is now dependent for his sustenance. 

From the motherland, Asia, the fig was carried over tlie Western 
World by twojiifferent peoples and by two djstincLJxmt«s. These 
two peoples, in ancient times the great colonize rs_oX-tli#-werld, were

The r eal history of the fig industry begins after the introduction of .^ Ti.. - 
the fig into the Mediterranean region outside of Asia, and particularly ^ ' 
into Greece. Historical references are few and far between. The tree — ).* \^.] 
and its fruit constitutedjit first merely a luxuryjor the ri ch. Later, 
mention of th e fig^ become s frequent, and not merely as a luxury 
during the ripening period, but as an important article ofjdi^J for th^ ^ ^ ^ .<; 
people during th£ winter^months. LU- ^f. ^ - 

The time of the first introduction of the fig into Europ e is very 
uncertain. In the Homeric songs, the oldest European literature , ' 

extant, the fig is hardly mentioned. In the Iliad, describing the r\j^A/ 
Trojan war, the greatest national undertaking of the Greeks, no 
reference toj^he fig is found. In the^d^sej^, describing the wanHef-^ 
ings of Odysseus after this war, the fig is mentioned three times. In 
the part descriptive of the agonies of Tantalus in the lower world 
we read how in vain he tried to reach the fruits almost within his 
grasp, "pomegranates, pears, apples, sweet figs, and dark olives. "^ 
The composition of the Homeric songs is generally conceded to have ^''^y^^ 
been accomplished before theninth ce ntury before Christ, but later ^3^ ^ 
investigations make it probabretfiat'the verses mentioning the fig 
in the Od yssey are inte rpolations of much later date. Hesk)d^who ^""^v^ 
lived in the ninth century and after Homer, has nothing to say about 7^ \r ^ \. 
the fig. The earliest menti on of und ou bted g eniiineness is by the poet ' ,- ^ ^."^ ^ A 
Archi l ochus, w ho lived about seven hundred years before our era. He ^ '^ % \ \ 
tells about the fig being cultivated on the Greek island of Paros, and /^\ . ' . 
there greatly contributing to thet enjoyment of life. The introduc- ^ A. \^^ - 
tion of the fig in Greece must, therefore, have occurred some time in ^-"-^ 
the eighth centur ^^befprejphrist, and undoubtedly it then came from 
the Semitic nations across fro m Palestin e.and Asia Minor. Later on 
Attika aiid^_§il£yon~tIie latter place named after *'syke" (fig), had 
become famous for their excellent figs, the origin of which was attrib- 
uted to the goddessjCeres (DemetiCr), who caused the fig tree to 
spring up at I^iykalos as a reward for the hospitality extended to her 
by the inhabitants of the place. 

The cultivation of the fig soon extended all over Greece, and the 
fig gradually became an important article of diet of both poor and

rich. The Athenians were especially chided for their -ioudness for 
figs, and nlcknamedT "sykophants" (fig-eaters), a name afterwards 
applied with a different meaning jbp_those jpies who informed the 
authorities about the unlawful exportation of. ^ gs. f romAttika. So 
u:' ^ , famous became the figs of that province that Xerxes, the King of 
the Persians, daily procured Attic figs for his table in order that they 
might constantly remind him of the desirability of adding to his 
domain a country which could produce such fine fruit. ^ From this 
time the fig is constantly referred to in the Greek literature, and Theo- 
phrastus, Aristotle, and other writers describe the caprification proc- 
ess, then extensively practiced. 

From Greece the fig tree and its culture spread along the northern 
ores of the Mediterranean and the Adriatic until it gradually reached 
the southern parts of Italy. There it must have been established at 
an early date, aslit figures in the earliest Roman mythology, the 
she-wolf having nursed the infants, Romulus and Remus, under the 
reading crown of a certain fig tree, which was thought to be in 
existence and pointed out as a sacred objfect in the time of Plin y. 
^. ^Certain it is that from remotest times fig culture was a cherished pur- 
suit among the Romans, who, through seedlings and culture, origi- 
nated numerous varieties. So different and characteristic had these 
become in the time of Pliny (23-79 A. D.) that they excited the special 
^^'aitention of that great naturalist. He wrote: '* We see from this how 
the universal law which preserves the types of the species may 
vary" — ^a most remarkable exi)ression, which clearly foreshadows the 
modern theory of evolution. ^ 
The mauy varieties described by the ancient writers, siich as Theo- 
'^Nphra stus, Cat o, and Pliny, can not now be identified with any certainty. 
- Many of these varieties originated from seed, some^ccidentally, others 
as the result of efforts made for that purpose.^ Their identification 
has been attempted by several modern investigators, such as Porta, 
Gasparrini, and Gallesio, and while their efforts have been highly 
interesting, they have brought no conclusive results. When we con- 
sider how quickly varieties are discarded for others of greater value, 
J\ ' '^ it becomes probable that most of these ancient figs became extinct 
o N Centuries ago. From the many varieties mentioned by_tlieGreek and 
., \ Latin authors * we may, however, conclude that fig culture was exten- 
"" sively distributed and considered of great importance. But notwith- 
standing the many varieties, the best and^choicest figs were those 
imported from Syria, as we are toTd'^that during the reign of the 
Emperor Tiberius (B. C. 42-A. D. 37) '^ considerable trade existed in

At the end of the Roman Empire, near the close of the fifth cen tury nV' ' ^

France, thj^Channel islands, and perhaps over the southern part of 
England. M?ut nowhere else had the cultivation and the drying of ^^ -^ 
figs reached such a height of development as in SyriaTJ a-" ' ' V ^ y^^ '^' r 

Nearly seventeen hundred years after the Phoenician colonization^/ ^ S ^^^ 
the Arabic conquest began to follow that same route. The AMbs in ^ j^ / 
their turn carried with Jhem the fig tree, now developed jnto many LjC^"*; ' . 
new varieties, and raised f ig cultu rejto a degree of importance which 5* /p ^ ^^ 
it has never s ince attained outside of its old home, Syria. The Ara- *•; " 
bic invasion extended through nort hern A frica to Spain and Portugal, l-^^ ^ - '")" 
and in these countries fig culture began to flourish and rapidly became ^y ^ ^ " 

of even gre ater importance than inj[taly ^Jid Greece. The Arabs ^"[^ 

held the fig in the highest esteem and considered it superior to any A ^ 
other fruit. It is even related b y Zamakhsc hari,^ an Arabian com-/' .. , 
mentator on the Koran, tha t Mohamme d, the prophet, himself, in his — — ^^ 
enthusiastic_enjoyment of the delicious figs, once exclaimed: "If I o ^ J ' 
should wish a fruil'ibrought to Paradise it would ce.rtainly.be *^® fig-" / . 

The Arabic invasion, du ring the medieval ages, has indelibly stamped '^'^^ 
its mark on fi g cultu re in the territory it occup ied, and to this day" 
the varieties of figs gr own there are to a great extent different from 
and superior to those grown in countries colonized by the Greeks and ". ^ 
Romans. Thus Portugal, the most southern province of Greece out- 
side of the Pillars of Hercules, became especially famous for its figs. +" 
Algarve^ith an almost perfect climate, produced a most superior 
article of dried figs, the commerce in which became of the greatest 
importance. Algarve almost exclusively su^plied^jrestei;:^ Europe ^ ^ 
with dried figs for over one thousand years, and until late in the ,'j 
present century Portuguese figs dominated the English markets. It 
is only comparatively of recent date that the Smyrna fi^s have sup- 
planted all others inEnglish and Am.ericaiTmarketsr Even as regards 
nameSj Arabic fig culture has left its_influence to this day in the 
various countries of the ancient Arabic caliphate. Thus in Portugal 
the caprifig is known as " fico de toca," the Arabic name being 
"tokkar," while in Malta the name "tokar" is yet in use and almost 
unchanged. 2

Emp eror Tschang -Kien, who fitted out an expedition to Turan in the 

yftg.r 1 S7 A H. The fig is first mentioned by Chinese writers in the 

eighth jeentury. Hia-tscheng-Sh i, in his work, "Yu-yang-tsa-tsu," 

treating of the Chinese trade, speaks of a fruit as^ ^Hin-tin" in a 

rj l^^com^tr y — ^* Fo-tin '' (Palestine). ''Tin" is the" Arabic name for the 

t y-f^fig. This writer mentions that the fruit originated without a blos-

growing in China, but it is not certain if these figs were identical with 
our own.~J[n_1550, however, the fig is described by the celebrated

''Genus," "species," and "variety" are words used frequently in 
these pages, and must be thoroughly understood bj^ anyone who wishes 
to master the principles of horticulture. In order to properly name, . / 
know, and classify plants they have been primarily arranged and fjt^' ' 
grouped together according to their relationships and similarity. ^ r ' 
Thus all roses, wild ^nd cultivated, are grouped and called by a . ; ". . \ 
common name — Rosa. This, then, is a genus, and the word iJosa * j^.^^ 
is called a genus name. Similarly all figs, wild and otherwise, which — - — ' 
resemble one another in certain respects are grouped together under a 
general genus called Ficus, There are a great many different kinds, 
originally wild, of roses and figs. Each one of these is called a spe- 
cies and is given a separate name. Such as the dogrose is known as 
Rosa canina and the edible fig is known as Ficus carica. There are 
many different. edible_figs, and these are called varieties or forms.

len and the seed, 
and its various 
parts are espe- 
cially adapted for 
both the produc- 
tion of pollen and 
seed as well as 
for the protection 
and benefit of the 
generative organs 
producing them. 
In order that seed 
may be generated 
the flower pos- 
sesses two distinct 
parts, which have 
different functions 
in the process of 
generation. These 
parts are known as male and female, and both of them must be pres- 
ent in order that seed may be produced. 

These parts may either be found both in the same flower or one 
kind may be found in one flower, the other kind in another flower, or 
the two kinds may be found on two individual trees. In other words, 
we have flowers which contain both male and female organs, and we 
have flowers which are either male or female; or we have trees and 
plants of which different individuals carry either male or female flow- 
ers only. The female organ of a flower is called pistil; the male 
organ is known as stamen. The stamens are generally present in 
large number and situated in a ring around the ovary, which is 
found generally in the center of the flower. Surrounding both these 
organs are one or more rows of petals and sepals, known by a common 
name — perianth or floral envelope — but popularly though wrongly 




Ftg. 1.— a diagrammatic representation of a common flower.

called " leaves." This perianth serves as a protection to the seed and 
pollen producing parts, and when colored also serves to attract insects, 
without the aid of which comparatively few varieties of flowers would 
produce fertile seed. 

The accompanying illustration (fig. 1) represents a flower which 
has been cut through lengthwise in order to show the generative 
organs, the petals having been left out. . The cut does not represent 
any certain flower, but a flower in general. 

The male organs are represented by two stamens. These consist of 
an upper button-like part, the anther, which produces the pollen, and 
a lower stock or outer filament, 
which supports the anther. The 
right-hand anther shows on its sur- 
face the pollen grains. 

The female organ of the flower 
consists of an ovary and an upx)er 
part, the stigma, supported by a 
style. The ovary contains the 
ovules, each of which has two coats 
surrounding the central nucellus. 
This is the part which directly pro- 
duces the future seed. The stigma 
is the uppermost part of the female 
organ. It is generally kept moist 
by a special gum-like fluid, which 

causes the grains to adhere to the stigma. The stem supporting the 
stigma is called the "style." Through the center of the style down 
to the funnel-shaped opening in the ovule there runs a hollow canal, 
which gives admission to the nucellus. 

In order that a flower may produce seed it is necessary that the 
pollen tubes produced by the pollen should penetrate through the 
stigma and style into the ovary. This process is called fecundation. 
The pollen grain and the cell of the ovule unite, and from their union 
the seed and the new plant are formed.

CHAPTER II. 
r. FIG CTJLTUBE IN YABIOUS FOREIGN COUNTRIES. 

*^ FIG CULTURE IN SJfYRNA AND ASIA MINOR. 

The best and most delicious figs when dried are those from Smyrna, 
known in the market as Smyrna figs. They derive their name from 
the seaport Smyrna, where they are packed and whence they are 
shipped to almost every country on the globe. The figs are, however, 
not grown in or very near to Smyrna, but in various places about 80 
to 150 miles south and east from that town. Smyrna is to-day one of 
the most prosperous towns on the Mediterranean shore and one of the 
most important in Asia Minor. This prosperity is due to the trade in 
fruit, principal ly rais ins and olive s. The fig trade is smaller, but so 
excellent is the fruit that this product more than any other has made 
the port known all over the civilized world, and apparently the more 
so the farther we go west. In California, more than elsewhere, the 
name of Smyrna has become a household word to the horticulturists, 
who have been trying for years to produce figs equal to those shipped 
from Smyrna. 

As is well known, Smyrna is situated in the western part of Asia 
Minor, and at the eastern end of the large and well-protected bay 
known as the Gulf of Smyrna. The latitude is 38°^ corresponding 
approximately to that of San Francisco, but the climatic conditions 
of the places where the figs are grown correspond inore properly to 
^ ^ those of cent ral an d southern California, northeriT^Ohora, southern 
jTexas, etc. - 

r ^ In the most ancient times of which we have record a considerable 
; fig trade existed in Smyrna, and we are told that in the time of the 
' /-^earlier emperors of Rome, in the first centurjjif^^ur era, dried figs 
^^ of the best qualitj^ were brought from Smyrna to Rome. This fame 
for excellent figs was enjoyed by Smyrna all through the Middle Ages 
' and down to our own times. At the time of Henry VIII and Elizabeth 
'\ Smyrna figs reached England. It is, however, at a comparatively late 
^ 'date that the Smyrna fig trade reached the development it riow'pos- 
' sesses. The great competitors with Smyrna figs were those grown in 
Algaryfi. in Portugal and. for centuries known as Pharo figs. These 
were for a time the most common figs in the European market and 
• were almost the only ones consumed. In the beginning of this cen- 
tury, however, the Portuguese or Pharo figs began to deteriorate, 
while at the same time, principally through Greek influences, a marked

improvement was noticed in the packing and curing of the Smyrna 
figs. To-day the Pharo figs are almost unknown, while the Smyrna figs 
have not only secured control of the former markets of the Pharo figs, 
but greatly extended them. (PL I.) 

PIO DISTRICTS. 

As already stated, while Smyrna is the export and packing place 
for the figs bearing that name, they are not grown in the immediate 
vicinity of the port, but are cultivated farther inland and to the 
south, in the valley of the Meander River. The river basin, which 
runs due east and west, lies about 80 miles south of Smyrna, from 
the vicinity of which it is separated by the Salatin Mountains — a 
rather high chain also running east and west. The principal fig 
district thus faces the south, being sheltered by the mountains from 
* the north. The Meander Valley, situated principally on the north 
side of the river, is about 50 miles long by not over 5 miles wide, and 
generally less. But the fig district has of late extended even farther 
north, and the first orchards which are reached in going from Smyrna 
are situated on the north side of the Salatin Mountains, in the foothills 
of Ayasalouk, close to the ancient Ephesus. After the summit of 
the foothills has been reached at Azizieh, the road rapidly descends, 
and at Balachica the western point of the main fig district is reached. 
From here it extends about 50 miles due west into the interior. The 
most famous part, where the finest figs are grown, is the vicinity of 
Euovassi, at an elevation of 210 feet above the sea. Between Aidin 
A * (pronounced /-deen) and Nashi the land rises from 217 to 260 feet, 
^t^^ ^ and from there to the upper end of the valley there is a rise in all of 
\ ^ - "j 600 feet. The valley of the Meander, now traversed by a railroad, 
y consists of a rather level plain, crossed by a humber of gulches. The 
\^\^ soiljsJKeiy deep andjich, consisting of a vegetable loam, rich in mica 
^ and humus, possessing to a very high degree the quality of retaining 

moisture, so necessary to the well-being of the fig trees. No irriga- 
tion is resorted to or as a rule required. 

According to the localities where grown, the Smyrna figs are divided 

into several different grades. Thus, proceeding from east to west on 

the Aidin railroad are found first the " Nazly figs." These are grown 

between Ortoxi and Nazilli or Nasly. Those grown between Aidin 

and Erbeghly are known as "Erbelli" figs, and those coming from 

^.. points farther west from Dermendjik to Forbaly are known as '*Por- 

V baly." Another smaller fig district, about 5 or 6 miles in diameter, is 

\ Situated at Demieh, about 50 miles southeast of Smyrna, on the north 

side of the Salatin Mountains, in the valley of the river Kaistros. 

CLIMATE AND SOIL. 

The climate of the Aidin Valley differs somewhat from that of 
Smyrna, being warmer and^ drier. Thus, while Smyrna and its 



26 THE fig: its history, culture, and curing. 

vicinity are admirably suited for the growing and curing of raisin 
grapes, especially the Sultanas, Rosaki, and Black, the interior is 
less suited to them, but more to figs and oranges. The maximum 
heat in the summer seldom rises above 90° F. in the shade or 130° F. 
in the sun, and in the winter rarely falls below 30° F. There is con- 
siderable dew throughout the season, even in the summer, and the 
air is much more moist than in California and Arizona. 

The winter is the rainy season, the summer the dry one, as on the 
Pacific coast. The rain falls from November to April, beginning and 
ending with scattering showers. The average rainfall is about 25 
inches. From April to November practically no rain falls. While 
there is but little frost in the winter, there are sometimes frosts in 
March heavy enough to cause much injury to the young caprifig, 
the lobfigs not having set. 

VARIETIES OF PIGS. 

Regarding the names of the figs grown in the fig districts much 
confusion prevails, as the figs are known by the places where gi'own, 
or designated by color, shape, etc., or by quality, or style of packing. 
Thus "Leker ingir" means simply layer figs. The Turks, unable to 
pronounce ** layer " properly, the name given by the English merchants, 
have corrupted it to *'leker." Leker ingir is, therefore, not a variety, 
but a style of fig packing. "Hordas" are white figs of inferior 
quality which require no caprification. They are dried and shipped 
to Austria and Germany for adulterating coffee and for distilling. 
The white Hordas are used for the coffee, while the brown Hordas go 
to the distillery; ** Budrun Hordas " is a variety which when dried is 
preferred by makers of adulterated coffee. 

The following are some of the most generally cultivated figs in the 
Smyrna districts: 

Lob Ingir {lob meaning juicy, and ingir fig), — This is the best fig 
for drying. The pulp is white; the form flat; the stalk short; the 
ribs prominent before maturity; the eye rather large, not open; skin 
whitish yellow; leaves deeply lobed, with the lobes long and narrow 
pointed. Of the five to seven lobes some are larger than others, 
making the leaf rather lopsided. Lob Ingir is undoubtedly identical 
with the variety known as *' Bulletin No. 1,"^ now grown in many 
places in California, where, however, it does not produce any crop 
, without caprification or pollination, though now and then a fig of the 
first crop comes to partial maturity. 

Ak Ingir {ak, white; ingir, fig). — Another fig for drying, possibly 
identical with "Bulletin No. 3." Fruit has not yet matured in Cali- 
fornia. Judging from unripe specimens, the fig is very round; the 



^ Varieties of figs introduced by the San Francisco Bulletin several years ago; 
hence the name.

» 
eye prominent; the leaves almost entire, with very heavy white veins 

on the back. 

Ohil Ingir {chil, smallpox; ingir,fig). — This is a white fig of fine " 
drying properties, covered, when fresh, with green spots as large as a 
dime or less. When drying, this fig becomes white and the green 
spots turn even whiter than the rest of the skin. 

Hazir Lop {hazir, ready; lop^ to swaMow or bite; also juicy). — 
White; large; characterized by the stem remaining on the tree when 
the fig is pulled; very fine for eating fresh; not used for drying; 
requires caprification. 

Sarilob Ingir {sariloby yellow; ingir, fig). — This is another of the 
Smyrna figs. Perhaps it is identical with "Bulletin No. 2." In such 
case the fig is oblong, pyriform, broadest above the apex; the stalk 
is short; the skin yellow and slightly downy; the pulp pink; the 
leaves rather entire, with three shallow lobes; the eye large, pro- 
truding; requires caprification to mature fruit. 

BardaJcjik {from bardak, an Egyptian pitcher). — One of the very 
best drying figs. It is possible that this fig is among the " Bulletin" 
importations to California, but if so it has not yet been among those 
pollinated by the writer. This is a longer fig, having a white skin of 
extreme thinness, and an amber pulp. It dries well. It is often eaten 
fresh, and as such is considered the finest eating fig known. 

The caprifig, which is grown for caprification, and which also grows 
wild in the hills, is known as " ilek,? and the process of caprification is 
known as "ilek atmak." 

Other fruits which grow in the fig region are oranges, olives, and 
rosaki and black grapes. No wine is made in the fig region. Raisins 
are produced to a limited extent only. Apricots and peaches are 
grown in moderate quantity, but only for home use. 

PLANTING LOBFIGS. 

Before planting the ground is well and deeply plowed several times, 
fertilized with camel manure, and freed from weeds. 

The planting is frequently done in a peculiar way not found in use 
outside of Smyrna. It is generally done in March. Of late the trees 
are grown about 60 feet apart in regular rows, though the older 
orchards were planted closer and more irregularly. The holes are dug 
of good depth, and for every hole two cuttings are used, which are set 
crossing each other. The butt ends are from 9 to 12 inches apart 
both below and above the soil, the cuttings thus crossing each other 
in the middle of the hole. The latter is filled up and stamped tight, 
leaving the cuttings protruding about 2 inches, which projecting part 
is again covered with loose soil, forming a small mound, in order 
to prevent drying out by wind and sun. During the first season 
hand watering is resorted to if the winter be a very dry one. After-

wards no irrigation is used or required. This peculiar way of plant- 
ing, which has been considered an heirloom of ancient superstition, 
has been much condemned; but the custom is nevertheless a most 
excellent one, as it causes the fig tree to branch and spread in a 
number of fan-shaped branches, which prevents the very dangerous 
breaking of the limbs and branches of the trees. If we wish to pre- 
vent the breaking down of our own fig trees we must adopt this very 
method. Trees grown in this manner branch close to the soil and 
spread out in all directions, forming a number of trunks or stems. 
Only enough of the lower branches are cut awaj^ to allow passage for 
the pickers, and so low are the branches allowed to remain that the 
pickers must bend in order not to strike them, the lowest branches 
being 3 to 4 feet from the ground. 

This planting also causes the trees to be more open to air and allows 
more sunshine in the interior of the crown. The advantage of this is 
evident when it is remembered that the best lobfigs are always found 
on the outside of the tree and never among the interior branches, 
where they are shaded and never come to proper maturity. The con- 
trary is the case with the caprifigs, the best for caprification being 
found in the interior, among the denser foliage. The pruning of the 
fig is not extensively practiced in Smyrna. Trees planted as just 
described produce no main standard or central trunk which later 
needs to be cut out, but onlj'^ several branches, which bend away from 
one another in a goblet-shaped manner. The neciessary pruning is 
therefore confined to the cutting away of limbs that cross one another, 
and also to the cutting awaj'^ of some of the j'^ear's growth from where 
it starts out from 3 or 4 year old wood. Limbs are never cut square off. 

An important part of fig cultivation in Smyrna is the watching of 
the orchards. This is done by special guardians or watchers, known 
as '*beckji." They stay in the orchards day and night, in specially 
prepared arbors or camps under some large tree near the drying 
ground, and their business is to keep away all intruders — thieves of 
humankind as well as beasts and birds. 

The bearing qualitj'^ of the fig depends greatlj^ on the age of the ^^ 
trees. Younger trees will produce 50 pounds of dried fruit, trees in 
good condition bearing 150 pounds, while old trees will yield 300 or 
more pounds of dried fruit. No fig tree of tlie drying kinds is sup- 
posed to produce figs suitable for drying until it is four or more 
years old. 

CAPRIFICATION. 

Caprification, or *'ilek atmak," is practiced yearly, as without it 
the crop will fail to set and mature. The time for this operation is 
in the lact week of June. The figs have then reached the size of a 
hazelnut or larger. Four or six caprifigs are strung on a reed, and 
this is thrown over the branches of the edible fig trees. Later, as 



FIG CULTURE IN VARIOUS FOREIGN COUNTRIES. 



29 



more figs appear on the edible fig trees, the process is repeated, as 
the issuing of the wasps will cease in a few days. To a small tree only 
a few strings are required, while for a larger tree about 30 strings are 
needed to insure pollination. In case the caprifig crop fails, boat loads 
of caprifigs are imported from the Grecian islands at a great expense. 
In great scarcity the caprifigs sell at from 2^ to 4 cents apiece, which 

shows the 
value placed 
on them by the 
cultivator. 

HARYKST AND DRYING. 

Before the figs begin 
to lipen the ground un- 
der ilie trees is raked 
cloan of leaves, clods, 
and weeds, in order that 
the figs may drop on 
soft soil without injury 
from Imrsting. 

1>T ying floors or beds 
are u j^ed for the final dry- 
ing of the figs. These 
beds are low — about 6 or 
8 inches high^simply 
made of loose soil, like 
a common garden bed. 
Tht^V^ Hi-e long and nar- 
row^i > or 8 feet wide and 
50 or 100 feet long — sep- 
arated by walks about 
1 tVet wide. Along the 
outside margin of these 
beds are driven pegs 
wliiclu when in the soil, 
protrude but slightly 
above the bed. Between 
these pegs willow or 
other thin branches 
or a run do canes are 
braided, in order to protect the bed and prevent the soil from fall- 
ing out on the walks. The tops of the beds are first stamped hard and 
wetted, then covered with mats made of rushes or esparto grass or of 
the cpllt canes of the Italian cane {Arundo donax). On these mats 
the figs are dried. Many of the poorer growers cover the beds with 
the split arundo canes.

30 THE fig: its history, oultube, and cubing. 

At the end of Jul}' the figs begin to mature. The fig is never cut 
from the tree, but falls of its own accord when partially cured or 
overripe. At first the figs drop a few at a time, and but few laborers 
are required, the picker having to glean all over the ground in order 
to fill a basket. In August, however, the figs fall thick and fast, and 
the whole laboring population is required to pick and dry the crop. 

The figs are never picked up while covered with dew, but only when 
perfectly dry. The most favorable time for picking is during the 
blowing of the north wind, as the figs then dry better and assume a 
better color. The figs are picked up into wicker baskets and imme- 
diately conveyed to the drying ground near by, where they are care- 
fully spread out singly, none being allowed to overlap another, in 
order that they may receive the necessary sun and heat. 

After three to four days of exposure those figs which are dried suf- 
ficiently are taken up, divided roughly into three different grades, 
and care taken that they do not dry too much. The skin must feel 
dry, but the inside must be soft. The very choicest figs are conveyed 
to Smyrna in baskets. The general grade, or "eleme," is dumped in 
sacks made of goat hair and camel's hair, while for the third or poorer 
grade or *'horda" common, yellow-colored sacks are used. The goat- 
hair sacks are very durable, and do not become so sticky from any 
exuding juice. They are also impervious to dust. These bags are also 
very expensive, and, indeed, are very seldom owned by the growers, 
but hired from the '' devegees," or camel men, who carry the figs to the 
railroads and to Aidin. These devegees are in reality contractors who 
haul the crop away, ship it on th«^ railroads, accompany it to Aidin, 
and finally dispose of the figs to the traders there. They constitute a 
real corporation of middlemen, known for their honesty and capability. 
Their work for the season ends only with turning the sum received 
for th© saJe over to the grower. The guild of the devegees is an 
important one in Smyrna. The compensation of the devegee is 7 per 
cent of the sale. 

PACKING. 

The fig grower in Smyrna does not pack his own figs. The packing 
is done by special firms who employ skilled labor. The packing con- 
sists of two distinct operations — the assorting and the packing proper. 
The assorting is done by comparatively unskilled labor, women being 
always employed for this part of the work. The figs are dumped 
from their hair sacks on mats spread directly on the floor, and girls 
and women squat down around the piles. Each woman has in front 
of her at least three baskets, into which she assorts the fruit, in three 
grades, while the refuse remains on the floor to be packed in 50- 
pound bags, which are disposed of for home use or shipped to England 
and France for distilling, etc. The grade is determined by size, color, 
thinness of skin, etc., and is judged by both eye and hand.

These assorted figs are carried away by men to the packing rooms 
and are now known as "maccaronia." The packing proper is done 
by men in separate rooms and on roiigli tables. This process consists 
of two operations — pulling and splitting, and packing. Each packer 
has in front of him a jar with salt water for moistening the hands, 
which are always kept wet in order that the figs may not stick. Next 
the figs which are packed as "eleme" are pulled and drawn between 
the fingers and thumb into a flat dish-like form and then the back 
paii) is split, which allows still more spreading of the iig. In pulling 
the fig the "eye" part is brought into the center of the disk, which 
gives to the other part a handsome appearance, tlie coarse and tliick 
part of the fig being centered around the aye. All the best figs are 
packed in boxes containing from 2i to 50 pounds. They are placed 
in regular rows, without any guide, and so skillfully is this done that 
the lines between the rows are perfectly straight and even to such a 
degree tliat a sheet of paper may be dropped between tliem. The 
rows all consist of layers, one on the top of the other, all through the 
box. When finally the box is filled it is passed out to women, who 
place laurel leaves between the figs of the top layer, after which the 
carpenters nail the boxes and trim them off. (PI. II.) 

Another and better mode of packing is employed with so-called 
locoum figs. These are not pulled and split, but pressed between 
the fingers until they become almost sc^uare, and are then packed 
closely together. In all this packing no pi^esses • are used. The 
"eleme" boxes are simply piled upon the floor, one on the top of the 
other, which presses them sufficiently. Tlie poorer grades are packed 
in barrels in concentric rows. When such a barrel is full a loose 
bottom is put in and the packer gets in and tamps it down in order 
to compress the figs solidly. By the middle of Octobier the packing 
is generally over and tlie packing establishments are closed for the 
year. In some of these large packing houses as many as 500 hands 
are employed; 150 of these are women, 50 boys and girls, and 300 men. 

BRANDS AND BOXES. 

There are two great brands of Smyrna figs — the "eleme" and the 
"locoum." The former are always packed flattened out, the latter 
like little cubes. The word "eleme" means "select," or better, the 
"cream," as it were, skimmed out of a lot of common figs. Through 
habit this brand of fig is always first pulled, flattened, split, and 
pressed, and on this account it has been repeatedly stated that * ' eleme " 
means " pulled," which, however, is not the true meaning of the word. 

Locoum indicates a square cube of so-called fig paste, a kind of 
sweetmeat made of sugar and starch and a little coloring matter, with- 
out any particle of fig in it. This very stuff is also sold in many 
American cities under various names, as sugar figs, fig paste, etc. It 
generally comes as a square sack, or cube, probably originally 

23740— No. li— 01 3 



32 THE fig: its history, culture, and curing. 

intended to imitate the fig. The Turkish name for this paste is "Lo- 
conm," and the brand ''Locoura" on the box containing real figs indi- 
cates the manner of packing, in imitation of the Locoum pastes. The 
fig can not be worked in the shape of ''Locoum" unless it is unusu- 
ally thick and meaty, and therefore the best figs are always selected 
for that style of packing. The figs branded " Erbelli " come from the 
country surrounding the smaller village of Erbeghli, which has the 
reputation of growing the finest figs. The Erbelli figs are generally 
packed as "Locoum," and frequently both names appear on a box, 
indicating that the figs come from Erbeghli and are packed Locoum 
style. (PI. III.) 

Exporters put all kinds of fancy names on the figs which they send 
out, and vary them from time to time. Every year sees some 
novelties as to name, style of packing, package, etc. But two or three 
firms have adopted regular brands and goods which can be relied on 
to be uniform and regular one year with another. Messrs. Dutilth 
& Co., Smyrna packers, have kindly furnished the following infor- 
mation : 

The best brands are graded as follows: 

Imperials - - Imperial Crown. 

London layers..- _ Extra ggblue (4 crowns). 

Choice Finest gg red (3 crowns). 

Prime - Fine g3 black (2 crowns). 

These grades go both to England and America, no grade being packed ezcln- 
siyely for England or for America. The only brands which come always in the 
same manner of packages are those just referred to; all other package- marks vary 
as regards name, brands, sizes of packages, number of figs in each package, etc., 
greatly, of coarse, to the detriment of the trade, but more so to the packers 
themselves. 

The inside measures, in inches, of the fig package of E. J. L. are as follows: 
. Imperial crown, 12,^ by 16^, carrying 5 rows of figs with 11 figs in a row. 

Extras differ in size of box, a 9-pound box, measuring 9 by lU, carrying 4 rows 
of 8 figs each. Of this grade there are 13, 18, and 5 pound boxes also. 

Finest are put up in 8, 10, and 12 pound boxes. The 12-pound box measures 10 
by 14 and contains 4 rows of figs each. 

Fine are put up in 10-pound boxes only, measuring 9 by 12, containing 5 rows 
of figs, with 11 figs in the row. 

In these brands one always finds the same size of figs, whether they are in a 12, 
10, or 8 pound box of the same grade. 

The general run, or what is called the American standard, measures as follows: 

Inches. 

12-pound box, 5X11 figs 9.5 by 13 

10-ponndbox, 5X10 figs _... 8.4 by 12.2 

8-pound box, 4X9 figs 7.1 by 11.5 

6-pound box, 4x8 figs 7.2 by 9.4 

These figs seldom contain the same number of figs in the lower layers as in the 
tipper layers. Thus for the ordinary grade of figs— American standard— it is the 
general custom to put a smaller fig in the lower rows. Thus a box will have 5 by 
11 figs on top, while below them 5 by 13, etc. ; but the standard brands always 
eome with the same number of figs all through. The lumber for these boxes all

comes from Anstria. No regular price list is offered from Smyrna. When the 
figs arrive in this country they are at once placed in the hands of brokers in the 
United States, who draw samples and sell on sample boxes. 

The English trade prefers smaller packages, such as 1, 2, 4, 6, and 8 pounds, while 
the United States have them almost all running 8, 10, and 12 pounds. A small 
quantity of 6-pound boxes will sell, but only a very few, A few of 1, 2, and 4 will 
also sell. 

The price of Smyrna figs varies considerably with the season, as well as with the 
quality. The average price, for ten years for the last three grades has been as fol- 
lows: Per quintal of 112 pounds, $4.08, $8,75, and $19.22, all in the Smyrna market, 
packed. 

As may be judged from the foregoing statements, the peculiarities 
of the Smyrna fig trade, through which it has attained the height 
and prosperity it now enjoys, are as follows: 

A peculiar class of figs which require caprification. Of these figs 
there are three principal varieties grown for commerce. A favorable 
climate — dry, warm, and moderate, both winter and summer; rich 
soil, which retains moisture and which does not require irrigation; 
extreme care in selecting, assorting, grading, and packing; estab- 
J^^hed grades, which can be relied upon year after year. 

EXPORTATIONS. 

The best grades have always been taken by England, Germany and 
the United States coming next. Of late j^ears, however, the United 
States has begun to consume much better grades. The production of 
figs in California is also reducing the importations to the United States. 
The poorest grades are used in France for distillation and are exported 
to Austria and eastern Europe generally for distilling, as well as for 
the adulteration of roasted coffee. The production of figs has greatly 
increased of late years in Smyrna and its vicinity. In 1870 about 
6,000 tons of dried figs were brought to Smyrna for packing from the 
valleys where they were grown. In 1882 about 10,600 tons were 
brought in for packing, while about 7,000 tons, valued at about 
$1,600,000, were exported to France, England, Germany, and the 
United States. At the present time the production has considerably 
increased, and probably about 13,000 tons are now packed yearly. 



FIG CULTURE IN GREECE. 



^-f\^K ^ ' ^ GENERAL HISTORY. 



^ '] The history of the fig in ancient times in Greece has already been 
briefly discussed. Originally the fig was introduced from the Orient 
^./^6 at a time somewhat later than the Trojan war, or a l ittle before the, 
\i ^ '^^ighth century before Christ. The Grecian islands were the first to 
receive the fig, and the fruit soon spread throughout Greece and 
became highlyj^prociatei by a people who had for ages partly sub- 
sisted on acorns from the native trees. The mythological fables relate 



o^ 



34 THE fig: its history, culture, and curing. 

-how the goddess Demeter visited that country and that one night she 
was belated and was given a friendly and hospitable reception by Phy- 
talos. In return for the hospitality, she bade the fig tree spring from 
the ground in the same manner in which Minerva had caused the olive 
to appear. In time the fig beca me a sacred tr^e and second only to the ^ 0^ 
olive in importance. By the time of Theophrast a large number of j^^ 
fig varieties had been originated and imported. These varieties are, 
however, so indefinitely described that they can not be identified with 
any now existing, though it is possible that some of them may yet 
^survive. The ancient Greeks knew the caprifig well under the names 
)lynthos and Tragos, the latter being the name used by the Mes- 
seniansT Olh^i' liumes af Lhla tree were Erineos {E^pivEo^) and^^S^che- 
agria {2vx^ocypia) — in new Greek Agriosykia {Aypio(rvHid). 

The best figs in ancient times were those grown inAttica. They 
were so highly valued and considered so necessary for home use that 
a law was passed prohibiting their export. Until this law was pro- 
mulgated smuggling, it was said, was unknown, but from that 
time it became a common and profitable business to secretly export 
, .'^) .''and sell figs. To prevent this practice, special guardians were 
^ ^' appointed by the Government to watch and accuse those who broke 

X the law. These guardians were called sycophants (from sykon, a 
fig, and phaineln, to show). These officers of the law soon became 
hated on account of the blackmail used by them for their own enrich- 
V L . "* ment, and the word sycophant became synonymous with the idea of 

N^ \' ' ^ a secret spy. This meaning of the word has survived to this day. 

The fig had among the ancient Greeks a sacred, symbolic, and 
mystic meaning, an emblem of fertility and propagation. The 
flowers of the fig were hiddeiT, wline"~air other "ffowers were open 
to the light of the sun! TEe fig soon became a ^ religi ous and 
mythical symbol in the festivities and worship of the god Di onysip s, 
and an&asket of fresh figs was carried next to the vessel containing 
the wine destined as offering to that god.

FIGS IN MODERN GREECE, 

The cultivated and edible fig is known in Greece as "he sykea" 

(// crvH€a), and the figs are known as "ta syka" {ra avna). The old 

Pelasgic name was "fik," 'plural "fikj," and from this word has 

originated the modern word "fig," as well as the ancient Latin word 

-'^ficus." 

In modern times the fig tree is extensively cultivated all over 
Greece, in the mainland as well as on the islands, and many vari- 
eties are cultivated. Among these the very early kinds are known 
as "proima" (7rp6i/^a), The best and earliest of these come from 
uEgina, and are ripe in the month of June. Other famous varieties 
are the so-called ^myrna varieties, or the " Smj^rnaia," though we 
have no means of knowing whether or not they actually are identical

with those grown in Smyrna in Asia Minor. Other varieties, bearing 
only or principally large first-crop figs, are known as "basilika" 
(ftacFiXiHa) or "royals." They are generally dark and used only for 
the table. 

The figs for drying and export come principally from Kalamata, a

place also celebrated for its ' ' currant " raisins. The islands of Andros 
and Syros are also well known for their figs, though they are inferior 
to those of Kalamata. The crop from the latter place is principally 
exported to Russia, Austria, and central Europe generally. A few 
reach France and the United States. The bulk of all these figs is

used for the manufacture of "coffe" and brandy. The figs from 
Andros are of a dark brown color, owing to the mode of curing and 
drying in heated ovens. The Kalamata figs, which are now and then 
found in the United States, are vastly inferior to the imported Smyrna 
figs and are not even equal to uncaprificated California figs, the qual- 
ity of which has in late years greatly improved. As regards the culti- 
vation of the trees and the curing of the figs in Greece little of value is 
to be noted. As the figs are of inferior quality the methods of pro- 
ducing them must also be inferior. The gathering of the figs for 
drying commences about August 1 to 5. The ripe ones are cut from 
the tree by a reed split at one end. Only the ripe ones are gathered, 
the others being allowed to hang until ripe. The cut figs are placed 
on the ground to dry. In places where more care is taken low beds 
of soil are covered with straw and stamped haini. The beds are 
divided in sections 39 inches in width. At each side there is a ditch 
to receive the occasional rains. On this account the center of the 
beds is slightly raised in order that the rain may more readily flow 
off. When the figs have been exposed for about four days they are 
turned, about eight days being required to finish the drying. The 
Grecian mode of packing (fig. 4) is a most primitive one, probably actu- 
ated by the want of proper material for boxes. The figs are simply 
strung on reeds to the number of from 50 to several hundred. These 
strings are then formed into wheels of various shapes and weights and 
are then packed in larger boxes. Such wheels are not uncommon in the 
markets of the United States. Most of the Grecian figs are caprifi- 
cated, as can be readily demonstrated by cutting the figs open and 
examining the seeds. The latter mostly possess embryo. Only rarely 
have imported Grecian figs been seen which had not been caprificated. 
The figs are exported in large quantities from Calames and Andros. 
The next largest places from which the Greek figs are exported are 
Caryntie, Tenos, Pylia, etc. The export, which is steadily increas- 
ing, now reaches some 30,000,000 pounds annually. The poor quality 
of the Greek figs is the more remarkable, as the majority of the labor- 
ers in the Smyrna packing houses are Greeks. 

Caprification, as has been stated, was practiced in Greece in very 
ancient times. Whether the caprifig was introduced or was indigenous 
can not now be decided with certainty; but it is probable that the fig 
and the caprifig were introduced together. It has been stated that 
during the eighth century before Christ edible figs were growing in 
Greece, and it is certain that caprification was known at the time. 
From that time to this caprification has continually been practiced 
and is an inseparable process in the cultivation of the fig. The wild 
or caprifigs are called opivia or opiviovb, while in ancient times they 
were known as spiveos or epivos. The Pelasgic name for the caprifig 
was "piri." At present the caprifig grows in great abundance in 
waste places and among rocks all over the country. So common is the

caprifig that at times ship loads are exported to Smyrna to serve in 
caprification when the native caprifigs fail to yield on account of 
unfavorable seasons. The French botanists, Tournefort and Olivier, 
who were greatly prejudiced against caprification, tried to prove its 
worthlessness by the fact that Greek peasants had been seen to sus- 
pend oak galls and excrescences of elms and poplars in the fig trees 
instead of caprifigs. Such foreign substances could naturally have 
no effect in pollinating the figs, and the figs so practiced on would 
have set in any case. This observation of the botanists in question 
shows that in Greece varieties are grown which are similar to those 
we have in this country and which require no caprification in order to 
produce figs. 

Among the most interesting of the Greek caprifigs is the variety 
known as Erinosyce. This fig, which bears caprifigs as a first crop, 
produces a second crop of edible figs. A somewhat similar fig has 
been found in Brittany and lately also in California.

levels, but to an altitude of over 3,000 feet. In the vicinity of Ait Ouaban it 
I reaches to the zone of the cedars. 

Varieties,— The K&hylea distinguish some t wenty-eig ht Yarifitifi&.of edible figs, 
besides a number of caprifigs used exclusively for caprification. Of the latter 
there are four distinct kinds. The edible figs are either white,_or l^lagk*—

38 THE Fia: its history, culture, and curino. 

The variety called Thar'animt is the most valued among the white figs, and the 
variety known as Ajenjar is considered the finest black kind. 
, ; ^' >. Capin^gfs.— There are four named varieties of caprifigs. These are: Thadouk- 
r t - karth-en-tifouzal, Thadoukkarth-en-thar'animt, Thadoukkarth-en-thaberkant 

(black caprifig), Thadoukkarth-en-t'it-en-tesekkourth (Pheasant's eye caprifig). 
The best variety is the Thadoukkart-en-tifouzal. The name gf the caprifig in 
general is **douM flL!' These varieties of caprifigs are used indiscriminately. As 
regards caprification some kinds are better than others, the difference being in 
the time of maturity, in the number of crops, and in the number of wasps. 

There is another variety of wild fig known as Thadoukkart guir'zer (Creek 
caprifig) , but the fruits of this kind are never used for caprification. This tree is 
used for grafting. The tree is inhabited by a Blastophaga wasp not suitable for 
caprification. 

Propagation of the fig <ree.— There are four different ways in which the fig tree 
is propagated. Thesis arejcijAti n gs pi an ted directly in the orchard, cuttings planted 
in th e nursery and later on transplanted, suckers taken from the base of the tree 
or from its roots, and, finally, layers.^ "" "^ " 

Cuttings planted in the orcEarS are known as "thisekkar." They grow well 
and rapidly, but are supposed not to bear for several years. Cuttings planted first 
in the nursery are called * * thimer'eras. " After two or three years these are trans- 
planted into the orchard. These young trees bring a price of from 80 to 50 
centimes. The suckers are known as **ouchelikhen." The name for layers is 
*'ourk'ilen." 

When a fig tree is planted, a trench is dug: not a simple hole, as for other kinds 
of trees. Several slits are made in the trunk in order to facilitate the growth of 
roots. The time for planting is between October and March. The trees are gen- 
erally set in groups of five, though irregularly. 

Grafting is also used, but only when it is desired to change one variety into 
another, or in order to rejuvenate some old trunks. Grafting with scions is prac- 
ticed in February and March, while budding is practiced from March to June. 

Cultivation, etc.— In very cold wintera the buds of the more delicate varieties 
are covered with a plaster composed of cowdung, in order to prevent injury from 
frost. The first work in winter consists in cleaning the trunks of the trees— cut- 
ting off the suckers and superfluous surface roots. Sinks are dug around each 
tree in order to hold the rainwater. When manure is had, it is placed in these 
sinks. Plowing is done with oxen when the proprietor is wealthy enough to pos- 
sess them; otherwise the trees are simply dug around. Ancient practice stipulates 
that the first plowing should be made from January 10 to 23. The second plowing 
should be between February 13 and 19, while the third and last takes place either 
between April 10 and 30 or between May 1 and 21. In some places pearl barley 
and turnips are planted between the trees after the last plowing, but such crops 
are always considered detrimental to the fig trees. No pruning of the trees is 
practiced. 

Capinfication.— The caprifig is known as the "Doukkar," which signifies 
"male." But as the Kabyles are ignorant of the sexual elements of the caprifig or 
of plants in general the presumption is that the origin of the name is very ancient, 
and we are naturally carried back to a time when the people knew more of the 
nature of plants than they now do in those parts. The Blastophaga wasps are of a 
black color. Those, however, from the wild caprifig, known as "thadoukkart 
guir zer," are brown. These latter insects are not able to caprify the edible figs. 
The caprification is practiced in the same general way as elsewhere in the Medi- 
terranean countries. Strings of four caprifigs are thrown over the branches of 
the edible figs. The number of strings (imalak'en) varies with the tree. If neces- 
sary, as many as 100 strings or 400 caprifigs are used on a single tree. On the 
plains more strings are used than in the mountains, the average number of 



ma OULTtTRE IN VARIOUS FOREIOK COtJNTMES. 39 

strings being, perhaps, 20 to 30 on a tree. After a few weeks, when the ** donk- 
kar " begin to dry np, the process of caprification is renewed. This is repeated as 
many as four to six times during the summer. The expense of caprifying the 
trees is considerable. Each string of caprifigs costs about 5 centimes, which brings 
the highest cost of caprification for a single tree up to 5 francs a year. Some 
tribes forbid the exportation of caprifigs outside of their boundary, but as a rule 
the markets are full of caprifigs, offered for sale during the period when caprifi- 
cation is considered necessary. 

Figs requiring caprification. — Not all fig varieties require caprification. Those 
varieties which do not require caprification are Abakour, Ar'anim, Abouh'archaou, 
Abouremman, Azagour guilef , Azaich, Aboulil, Abelr'endjour, Thazerat, and Thad- 
hefouith. The varieties which it is necessary to caprificate are Thar'animt, El-hadj, 
Abouzouggar', Mezzith, and Thazaicht. 

The brebas are known as ** Ourgal^n," except those of the variety ** Abakour," the 
brebas of which are called "bakour" (early). 

Curing and drying. — The figs are dried on trays made of reeds. The latter are 
exposed to the full glare of the sun, but are stacked at night, 15 or more trays 
being superposed one on the other. When dried, the figs are stored in earthen jars 
or in large baskets. In order to keep away vermin, leaves of the sweet bay and of 
the * * zater " ( Calaminta nepeta) are interposed among the figs. The modiB of pack- 
ing used in Greece is also in vogue in the districts nearest the Mediterranean, 
but this more elaborate way of packing is used only for the figs destined for expor- 
tation. The quality is generally good, but the packing is always poor and pre- 
vents extensive sales and high prices. 

From 18 to 25 francs are realized for a kilo of the best dried figs. 

FIGS IN ITALY. y^\C" ' \ 

^ . • ^ Cato, who lived two centuries before Pliny, knew 6 varieties of figs. v>. . 

I In the beginning of the Christian e ra Plin y, the well-known naturalist, f^ ^ 
, v-^enumerated some 27 different varieties The names given them are — --^"'^ 
'. X either from the places where they Wfii:e ,grov7ing or they were named 
p after persons who had introduced them or who cultivated them. Thus 
N^ we read of Rhodian figs, of others as African , Hyrcanian, Lydian, 
Tivolian, Herculean^ Pompeian, Liviari, 'tfe latter introduced by Livia. 
^ ^ As might be expected, these figs are not so minutely described as to 
< ^enable us to identify them with kinds now existing in Italy or else- 
where. From the time of Pliny to modern times we find no pub- 
lished accounts of Italian figs. Still, during the long interva l new 
varieties must have been introduced and originated by chance or 
otherwise, as the first of the earliest of the modern writers,~'Porta and 
Pontedera — the former in the first years of the seventeenth century, 
the latter a hundred years later — mention a great number of distinct 
and valuable kinds. 

EXTENT AND CHARACTER OF THE ITALIAN FIG DISTRICTS. 

While fig trees are grown all through the Italian peninsula and its 
adjoining islands, the true and principal fig region must be consid- 
ered as that situated south of JiOfliiB, and extending from there to Sicily ., 
and the Liparian Islands. In northern Italy figs are grown princi- 
pally for eatmg fresh, and as such can not be said to constitute an 



oj

40 THE FIO: ITS HISTORY, OCLTITRE, AN1> CtrRIN(3^. 

article of important diet. Few figs are dried, and they entirely for 
home consumption, not for export.. In the southern parts of Italy, 
however, the fig, fresh and dried, is looked upon as an important and 
cheap article of diet, especially during the winter months, and the 
failure to secure a large fig crop is looked upon as a calamity, both on 
account of the diminished food supply and the pecuniary loss in the 
export trade; and the export trade must mean, in this part of Italy, 
not only the export to foreign districts, but the much greater export 
to Italian districts where figs are not grown, or at least not dried. 

While figs are growing almost everywhere in southern Italy, com- 
paratively few localities make fig culture an industry. Thus for fig 
culture favored spots appear comparatively few and far between, con- 
fined to certain valleys or to certain slopes which either through soil, 
location, or climate conditions produce figs superior for drying. 

The most northern district in which superior dried figs are produced 
is Pozzuoli, not far from Naples. The soil in this district appears to 
be of volcanic alluvium, especially adapted to producing figs of thin 
and white skin, good flavor, and great sweetness. In the Naples mar- 
ket these Pozzuoli figs compete successfully with those of more south- 
em districts and bring even a better price than the Calabrian figs. In 
the same vicinity we find a considerable quantity of dried figs pro- 
duced on the island Ischia, at Sora in Terra di Lavoro, at Vico Equense, 
peninsula Sorrentina, etc. As a rule these northern figs are small, 
averaging about one-third the size of the Smyrna figs, while in sweet- 
ness they are hardly equal to the Smymas. As we proceed south we 
find the figs slightly increasing in size, and to some degree even in 
sweetness. In southern Italy the principal fig centers are found in 
the provinces of Terra d' Otranto, Cosenza, Catanzaro, and Reggio, 
the latter generally known as the three Calabrias. Other centers 
for fig culture are found in the provinces of Lecce, Salerno, and 
Basilicata. In Terra d' Otranto, on the Adriatic side, excellent dried 
figs are produced at Taranto, Brindisi, and Melpignano. In Lecce, in 

1873, the two communes of Cutrofiano and Galatina produced 5,700 
quintals or 638,000 pounds of figs, while the three ports, Taranto, 
Gallipoli, and Brindisi, exported in 1872 about 70,000 quintals, equal 
to 7,840,000 pounds. The whole exx)orts of the province Terra 
d' Otranto for three years of 1870 to 1872 reached 132,099 quintals, 1 
quintal being about 112 pounds. 

The production "of dried figs in the immediate vicinity of Lecce 
in 1869 reached 11,000 quintals, and has since that time somewhat 
increased. In the province of Catanzaro the exportation of figs, in 

1874, amounted to 7,000 quintals, or 780,000 pounds. In the province 
of Cosenza the three principal localities for the production of dried 
figs are Cosenza, Castrovillari, and Paola, while the following com- 
munes also made a specialty of drying figs: Amantea, Belvedere,

FIG CtTLTUKE IN VARIOUS FOREIGN COUNTRIES. 41 

Belmonte, Longobardi, San Lucido, Scalea, Cleto, Serra di Aiello, 
Fiume-Freddo, Santa Domenica, MajerA., Orsomarso, and Verbicaro. 

In the province of Reggio the dried figs are produced for export, 
principally in the vicinity of Reggio, Palma, and Gerace, the latter 
place being especially famous for its dried figs. In Terra di Bari 
the fig regions are found in the vicinity of Moropoli and Turi, the figs 
from the former locality being among the largest and sweetest in 
southern Italy. 

As could be expected, the island of Sicily produces good and sweet 
figs. Foremost are those from the vicinity of Palermo, amoilg which 
may be found the largest figs produced in Italy, almost equaling 
those of Smyrna in sizjB, while exceeding them in sweetness. The 
principal localities for figs in that province are San Fratello and 
PoUina. The Palermo figs do not equal the Smyrna figs in flavor 
and thinness of skin. (PI. IV.) 

The province of Messina, rich in oranges and lemons, also produces 
good figs, though immediately around Messina no fresh figs are pro- 
duced, that town importing its supply from the ports of Calabria, on 
the other side of the Straits. The principal export port in the prov- 
ince of Messina is Milazzo. 

In the province of Catania it is especially in the region of Mount 
£tna that superior dried figs are found. The volcanic soils favor the 
drying quality of the figs as well as their sweetness. Figs are also 
prepared for drying in the other parts of Sicily, but nowhere to the 
same extent as in the provinces of Palermo, Messina, and Catania. 
The figs from the island of Lipari are, however, considered superior to 
those grown on the main island. These figs are exported principally 
to Naples and Malta. 

CLIMATIC CONDITIONS. 

In most of the Italian fig districts the best figs for drying are grown 
on or near the coast of the Mediterranean. The.infiuence of the 
sea, be it through modified heat or through increase in moisture, is 
decidedly beneficial. The climatic conditions for the production of 
figs in southern Italy are almost perfect, and inferior only to those 
of Smyrna in Asia Minor. But for the successful drying of figs, not 
to say curing of figs, the climate of Italy is not the very best. At the 
time of the fig harvest it not infrequently happens that showers, or 
even conanued rains, set in, injuring or even completely- spoiling the 
figs. On that account the growers resort to such measures as splitting 
the figs or drying them by artificial means in primitive ovens. In 
climatic conditions for drying Smyrna is much more favored than 
Italy. The natural rainfall in Italy is slightly less than that of 
Smyrna, but greater than that of southern and central California. 
The irrigation of fig trees is therefore less necessary in Italy than in 
California. 



42 THE fig: its history, cultuee, and oimiirG. 

QUALITY OF ITALIAN FIGS. 

But with all these favorable conditions Italy produces only figs 
which are inferior to those of Smyrna, though equal to those of Portu- 
gal, Spain, or France. It is especially in size and quality of pulp 
that the Italian figs are defective, averaging one-third less in weight 
than the Smyrna figs. Their flavor is also inferior, while in sweet- 
ness they are equal, or in a few instances even superior, to the figs of 
Asia Minor, Smyrna included. As regards albuminoids, so important 
when the nutritious quality of the figs is taken into consideration, the 
Italian figs take a very prominent place, but are still inferior to the 
Smyrna figs. In fatty substances the Italian figs are i)erhaps sui)erior 
to the Smyrnas, but the percentage of superiority is too small to be 
of any economic importance. In thinness of skin and in color the 
Italian figs of the best kinds compare unfavorably with Smyrna figs. 
To sum up, the Italian figs are inferior in size, aroma, and albumi- 
noids, but excel in sweetn ess and in other minor matters. Their meat is 
generally coarse. 

MODES OF CURING AND PACKING. 

As Italy does not in reality produce any first-class figs, it could not 
be expected that she would excel in curing and packing. Only where 
a very superior product is the outcome of careful horticultural meth- 
ods does it pay to spend much labor and skill on attractive packing. 
The Italian figs are grown principally for home consumption by the 
poorer classes of the people, and the object has therefore been to 
cure and pack as cheaply as possible. The exports are considerable, 
but the figs, instead of serving as table desserts and delicacies, are 
destined principally for distillation or for the adulteration of coffee, 
etc. Still, the Italian figs of the better classes, if properly put up and 
more carefully and cleanly handled, would command a market and a 
price far beyond that at present received. The Italian modes of cur- 
ing could be imitated profitably in the United States, especially when 
an expensive article is not contemplated. The time will come when 
our horticulturists will occupy themselves with the problem of pre- 
paring articles of food as well as of luxury, and they may then find 
some points of interest in the Italian modes of curing figs. In Italy 
there are three principal ways of curing and drying the figs, these meth- 
ods being used promiscuously in different parts of the country without 
being confined to special localities. 

The most common way is, after the figs have been properly picked 
as early in the day as possiblCj to split them lengthwise down to the 
peduncle or stalk end, where the two halves are allowed to remain con- 
nected. This splitting serves a double purpose, enabling the operator 
to detect the poor or sour figs and facilitating the drying of the fig. 
The splitting also does away with the laborious turning of the figs 
while drying. As soon as split, the figs are exposed on wicker trays or 



FIG CULTURE IN VARIOUS FOREIGN COUNTRIES. 48 

straw mats for drying. The interior surface is turned upward ; other- 
wise the contents would run to waste. The time for drying varies 
from six to ten days, according to locality and climate. The "figs are 
then taken in and dipped, which is done by placing them in wicker 
baskets and immersing them for a minute in boiling water. When 
removed the figs are thrown in heaps to drain off and dry and are 
then ready for packing. Such figs are in the province of Catania 
called figs "a chiappa" (flattened). 

Another method nearly related to the former consists in splitting 
and drying the figs just as last described. When nearly dry the figs 
are flavored. This is done in different ways in different localities — 
a quarter of a walnut is pressed into the pulp, or a piece of citron 
rind, or the pulp is simply sprinkled with anise seed. Such flavored 
figs find ready sale all over Italy, and not a^ few are exported to for- 
eign countries. 

The third way of drying figs is known as **passuluni" (wrinkled) 
in Catania or as **cuzzoli" (drawn out) on the mainland in the Cala- 
brias. When perfectly ripe the figs are carefully cut with a knife 
from the tree and then distributed on mats made of split cane 
(Arundo donax), the mats being spread on low beds of earth. The 
figs are turned every day or every two days and exposed to the full 
rays of the sun. The more frequently the figs are turned the better, 
many persons turning them several times daily. In from ten to 
fifteen days the figs have become bleached and dry externally, while 
the pulp remains soft, at least in the better specimens. The figs 
are then assorted and graded. Dipping in hot water for one minute 
comes next and finishes the operation of curing. The most careful 
curing is done in Catanzaro and in the district of Palermo, in Sioily. 

PACKING. 

The packing of Italian figs is quite primitive, owing to the scarcity 
and expensiveness of lumber for boxes. Braided mats, made either 
of strips of beechwood or of esparto* grass {Stipa ienacissima), hold- 
ing from 33 to 44 pounds each, are the most common packages for all 
export figs destined for distillation, etc. Table figs are generally 
exported in round drums made of wood shavings containing 12 to 15 
pounds of figs, there being no uniform packing. For home consump- 
tion the better classes of figs are strung on split reeds or esparto straw. 

The packing of figs is further advanced in Sicily than elsewhere 
in Italy. The packing called "pania" consists of piercing the figs 
with split canes, a sixth part of a cane being the proper thickness. 
Two and two figs are placed overlapping each other with the stalk ends, 
and a sliver of cane is then run through this overlapping part. 
Another sliver is run through the thick end of each fig. In this way 
more tigs are put on and these slivers of cane are made to hold a loaf 
of figs 4 inches wide by 20 inches long. 



44 



TEE fig: its history, culture, and curing. 



This packing is varied almost indefinitely in different places. Figs 
are strung on the elastic and tough straws of the esparto and finally 
rolled up in the shape of balls or in wheels (scerti di ficu). The 
squares are generally known as "tavolieri" (tables) or "pania" 
(loaf). 

Some of the largest figs are also picked and dried without skin and 
known as "ficu senza scorcia" (without skin) in the Catanian dialect. 




Fig. 5.— White Genoa fig. 

A confiture is made in some districts by dipping the nearly dried 
figs in honey, then packing them in jars, and baking in an oven. In 
all districts common bake ovens of most primitive construction are 
used for drying inferior figs or for finishing the drying of the regular 
figs in case of 'rain or continued fogs. But such artificially^ dried figs 
are inferior both as regards color and quality and bring much less in 
the market. 



FIG CULTURE IN VARIOUS FOREIGN COUNTRIES. 

VARIETIES OF FIGS. 



45 



The varieties of figs grown in Italy are many, in some localities 
reaching a hundred or more. A great uncertainty exists in regard to

Qames. Local names are given everywhere, and as no systematic 
descriptions of all the various varieties have ever been published, no

efforts have ever been made to identify and classify them. The most 
common fig used for drying is the Dottati, Dsitterese, or Dattero, the 
"figue datte"of France, the date-fig of the English, so called on 
account of its sweetness and the readiness with which it dries. The 
Dattero is the drjang fig for the Calabrias and the south of Italj'^ gen- 
erally. The size of the fig is below medium; color is light, and so is 
the pulp. The color of this fig is equal to that of Smyrna figs. The 
Petrogiano is another drying fig used in the province of Catanzaro, 
but not equal to the former. 

The figs commonly eaten in Italy are legion, but the best is consid- 
ered the Trojano, principally grown in the vicinity of Naples. The 
"fico di fragola," or strawberry fig, is a favorite in Sicily, while in 
the north, in Toscana and Umbria, the '* Verdini," the "Brogiotto 
neri" and "Brogiotto bianchi," the '*Fico Gentile," (see fig, 6), and 
the "Portoghese" are the varieties mostly cultivated. The San 
Piero, Black and White, are among the largest early figs in central 
Italy, but are little known in the south. This fig, which produces 
only first-crop figs, or "fichi fiori," is replaced in the south by the 
" Colombro" and " Paradiso," which also give excellent figs. 

CAPRIFICATION. 

Caprification is practiced only in southern Italy, and not everj^where 
in this locality. Most of the Italian varieties do not require caprifi- 
cation, and, so far as I know, none of the true Smyrna figs — with only 
perfect fiowers — is grown in Italy. As localities where caprification 
is especially practiced there mj^y be mentioned Sicily, Catanzaro, the 
old Kingdom of Naples, Ischia, etc. ; also the islands of Lipari and 
Malta. 

The total annual output of Italy in dried figs shipped to various 
countries reaches about 18,000,000 pounds in favorable years, while in 
years of smaller crops it may fall to 9,000,000 pounds. 

. ..'v. FIGS in PORTUGAL. 

/' The country around Lisbon and farther south is well adapted to 

the fig industry, and fig trees grow everywhere. The late Dr. John 

, Bleasdale, who was familiar with Portugal, considered the country 

^ \y surrounding Lisbon for 20 miles as especially favorable for figs, the 

^W large white figs being most appreciated. But the figs raised in the 

X' vicinity of the capital, though large and sweet, are not the best 

^■^ for drying and export; they are consumed principally at home, 

^ whether fresh or dry. With the increase in temperature toward the 

south the fig improves in quality and the conditions become more 

favorable for drying with the least amount of labor. Accordingly 

<. we find in the most southern province — Algarve — the real home of 

the fig industry on Portuguese soil. Few countries in any part of the 

world are as well favored with regard to climatic conditions as this 



\ ^ ^ \^ iK / ^^^ CULTURE IN VARIOUS FOREIGN COUNTRIES. 47 

\ jJiiCmous province, and, with the single exception of Smyrna, or rather 
the valley of the Meander River, no locality in the world produces figs 
of quality equal to the Algarve figs. The province of Algarve is an 
open littoral, gradually rising from the beach toward a high chain of 
mountains, which, with an easterly and westerly trend, shut off 
the northern winds. The exposure is toward the south alone, the 
heat being moderated by the balmy Atlantic breezes. What Anda- 
lusia is to Spain, Algarve is to Portugal — the orchard, garden, and 
(^ranary)»f that Kingdom. The deep alluvial sgi ljs one that contains 
mucTTTime and naturally retentive of moisture. Th e temperat ure of 
the province is remarkable for its even distribution, with only slight 
variation day and night, spring, summer, and fall. The mean sum- 
mer temperature is about 79° F., and this mean lasts from May to 
November. The highest is in August and September, with 82° F.; 
the lowest in May and November, with 77° F. The moistu re of the 
air is considerable, or about 73° for the summer mcmtlis ot May to 
November. Compared with California localities, none are exactly 
similar; but El Cajon, one of the interior valleys in San Diego County, 
comes the nearest. Compared with the large interior valley of Cali- 
fornia the moisture in Algarve is much greater, being about 70°, 
while in the San Joaquin Valley it is below 50° during the same sum- 
mer months. 
v-p The fig in Algarve grows to great perfection, and it is found every- 
_^ .y.^ \ where from the seashore to an altitude of about 1,100 feet. In fact, 
J the principal product of the district, whether we consider quantity 
,^ or value, is figs. But besides figs the country produces oranges, 
^ ^\ ^.^^^Imonds, oli^^ oi l3_and wine. The country is only partially culti- 
' '^' grated, the improvements rarely extending farther inland than 6 miles 
"' \ ^'ft'om the coast line. 
■ . ' Not many years ago the figs of Portugal were the most famous in 
the world, or at least the best known in western Europe. In the early 
v/^- part of the last century Portugal supplied England, America, Ger- 
^ ^ J many, and the north and west of Europe, generally, with figs, but was 
' * ' later on driven from the market by the superior and better-managed 
product of Smyrna. The Portuguese figs were known as Faro figs^ 
because they were exported from Faro, in Algarve. For a long time 
Faro was the principal business "place in southern Portugal and, as 
such, also the export place for figs. - The figs which were grown in 
the vicinity on the rather sandy plains and in the foothills of Sierra 
San Miguel were naturally of very good quality or almost of the very 
best quality, but they w^ere very badly handled in drying and curing 
and only commanded the foreign market until a better article was 
offered. The peasants generally carried the figs fresh or partly dried 
to the city and sold them as such to the merchants, who again dumped 
them out in small heaps on the stone floors in the warehouse. Mal- 
treated in this way the figs were usually bruised and a large part of

^ the sirup ran out and collected in narrow gutters and finally fermented 

in tanks. After fermentation of the surplus fig juice a kind of brandy 
of very good quality was distilled. The figs w^ere again si)read on 
stone or cane floors in the open courts and gardens and exposed to 
the sun for a longer or shorter time, according to the weather. When 
dry the figs were pressed into small baskets made of braided palm 
leaves, each basket holding 28 i)oUnds. The number of varieties of 
figs grown in Portugal is very great. The fig used for drying in 
Algarve is a large, white fig diffei'cnt from the Smyrna figs, so far as 
may be judged from descriptions. The best variety in Portugal is 
/^ ^^ known as the "figoda Comadre," or Godmother fig, so named because 
^s]^ the best is always reserved for the comadre and the compadre, words 
hardly to be translated into English, but which play a great part in 
the home life of the Latin races. 

The next best variety when dried is known as " figo mercante," while 
the third and poorest kind goes under the name of "figo chocho." 

Of these figs large quantities are yet exported, principally to Bel- 
gium, Holland, and France. The annual export averages 8,000 tons, 
or about one-half that of Italy. 

The first crop, the fiori or the brebas, is known in Portugal as " figos 
lampas," while the second crop is called " figos vendimos." For table 
use the red-fig varieties are considered the best. In the vicinity of Faro 
the '*figo do euchario" and the "do bispo" are the most valued varieties. 
The Lampeira is one of the best red tigs, producing only a first crop, 
called the lampas. In Italy this fi'^ is known as the Portoghese, and 
is considered a very good early fig, somewhat like the San Pedro. As 
regards culture and curing little is to be learned from the Portuguese. 
For cutting the figs from the trees a long bamboo pole is used, the end 
being split or forked. Below the fork a small basket of braided straw 
is hung to receive the falling fig, which is easily detached by pushing 
the foi'k upwa,rd. Only the best figs — a comparatively small propor- 
tion of the crop — are dried. This drying is on mats woven of the esparto 
grass {Stipa tenacissmia). As a result of the poor handling of the fig, 
this industry has decreased greatly in recent years. Portuguese table 
figs, which were once the staple article of figs in the western world, 
are now hardly known outside of Portugal, the carefully cured and 
beautifully packed Smyrna figs having driven the Portuguese article 
almost out of the market. 

The glory of Faro, as regards figs at least, is past. The harbor has 
become much filled in, and few figs are now sent abroad from this port. 
The trade in figs, on a much diminished scale, has been almost com- 
pletely transferred to the better and more readily accessible port of 
Villa Nova do Portimao. Fig culture and curing have of late pro- 
gressed but little in Portugal. Curing and packing, as practiced in 
Smyrna, are entirely unknown. When the Portuguese figs were 
refused by the foreign trade the cultivators and merchants did not 



FIG CULTURE IN VARIOUS FOREIGN COUNTRIES. 49 

inquire into the cause and made no effort toward improvement. The 
consequence has been a ruined business, which is not likely to revive 
soon. With proper care the Portuguese figs would really be very 
good, almost equaling the Smyrna figs. 

CAPRIFIGATION. 

Caprification is practiced everywhere in Portugal. The caprifig is 
known as "figo di toca," the name not being derived from *'tocar," 
to touch, as indicated by Link and other writers, but from the Arabic 
word "tokkar" or "dokkar" (the wild fig), showing that caprification 
was introduced, or at least reintroduced, by the Arabs or Moors. 
This caprifig belongs to the type with broad leaves. The caprifig, or 
figo di toca, ripens its first crop in Algarve at the end of «Tune or 
beginning of July, and a later crop setting at this time becomes ripe 
in August. The process of caprification is the same as in other coun- 
tries and deserves no special mention here. The Portuguese fig grow- 
ers know that not all fig varieties require caprification, and that in 
some varieties the first crop may not require caprification, while the 
second crop does require it. The Lampeira, which is grown princi- 
pall}^ around Tavira, belongs to the class which requires caprification 
for its second crop, but which matures a first crop without it. The first 
crop or camada of the Lampeira is also called ' ' figos lampas " and is 
never caprificated. The second crop or camada of the Lampeira, known 
as " figos vendimos," is said to never set and mature except with capri- 
fication, which accordingly is always practiced. ''Figo euchario," 
which also requires caprification, ripens only one crop, in Septem- 
ber. The "figo bravo," which is cultivated along the River Guadiana, 
gives also only one crop, which does not require the figo di toca^ and 
accordingly is never caprificated. 

The annual export of Portugal is about 10,000,000 pounds.

"^^ ^^ 0^ \. ^^-^ FIG CULTURE IN FRANCE. 
' V V : »v ' i FAVORABLE LOCALITIES. 

In France profitable fig culture extends from the environments of 
ParisJiO'the shores of the Mediterranean. While in the north figs are 
grown for use only while fresh, in the south they are also dried for 
export and home consumption. £cQvence is the center of the fig 
industry in France. There the climate is mild and favorable for olisies^ 
figs, pomegranates, and to some extent also for citrus fruife, but on 
the whole the favorable conditions for the fig industry are not equal 
to those in southern Italy and Sicily. In winter the frosts are some- 
times severe enough to greatly injure the fig trees, but their recupera- 
tive nature is such as to readily renew the injured parts. As in all 
the Mediterranean region, the rains are frequent in winter, few or 
none during the summer months. Irrigation is frequently resorted 




50 THE fig: its history, culture, and curing. 

to and is not considered injurious if judiciously applied. Figs des- 
tined for drying are irrigated less than those for use in the fresh state. 

In the most favored localities the fig trees are planted 18 to 20 feet 
apart and smaller crops are grown between; but on account of the 
fungus which frequently and fatally attacks the roots of the figs and 
rapidly spreads from one tree to another where they are growing so 
close that the roots interfere with one another, most fig trees are 
alternated^jsitiLAteffids or olives. 

The closer to the Mediterranean the taller are the standards or 
trunks of the fig trees, and the farther away from those shores the 
less the trunks, both in height and circumference, until in the vicinity 
of Paris the trunks disappear entirel}" and give way to a cluster of 
branches issuing direct from the soil. 

The trees with high standards suffer most from heat and dryness; 
consequently high-standard fig trees are found only in localities where 
irrigation is practiced. After the tree has been planted, generally 
from a cutting, it is allowed to grow as it pleases for two years. The 
effect is the development of numerous suckers from the base. In 
March of the third season the largest of these is selected to form 
the future standard, while the others are cut away. On this standard 
all side branches are cut until it has reached a height of 2.30 meters, 
or about 7 feet. The top bud is then pinched in the spring and side 
branches are allowed to form immediately below, constituting the 
coming head or crown of the tree. i 

Pruning is very little practiced, although in some localities fig trees 
are pruned to some extent. Suckers are removed from the base; dry 
branches as well as branches which cross one another are cut away, 
and branches which bend too close to the ground, interfering with 
other crops, are cut off. But the general rule is that the less the fig 
tree is cut the better for the tree. Whatever pruning is required is 
done in March or April. The cultivation of crops between the trees 
also suffices for the figs. Where no irrigation is practiced a hollow 
basin of earth is formed around the base of the fig tree early in the 
fall in order to catch the winter rains. In exposed localities the trees 
are protected in the following manner: In the middle of December or 
the beginning of winter the space around the tree is dug up and the 
soil heaped around the stem as high as possible in'order to protect 
it from cold. In the beginning of April this earth is again leveled 
down and the soil dug up anew. The succeeding labors are confined 
to irrigating the trees once a month until the end of August, when 
the harvest of the figs begins. 

It has been found that manuring greatly improves the figs. Light 
soils are manured with cow dung every two or three. years, while for 
heavier soils sheep, horse, and pigeon dung are used every six or 
eight years. But the best manures for figs are offal from factories, 
such as wool waste from mills, as well as bone dust.

cially renowned for their figs, fresh or dry, and in their vicinity may

Toulon, Grasse, Antibes, St. Remi, Entrecasteux, Bandol, Seyene, 
Tarascon, Nice, Bordeaux, Treves, Hyeres, St. Tropez, St. Maximin. 

CURING THE FIGS. 

When the figs are perfectly ripe they are picked early in the morn- 
ing, after the dew has dried off. There are at least two ways of curing 
the figs in France. In the first method the figs are simply placed on 
trays made of wicker willows, exposed to the sun, and turned every 
morning and every noon. 

The other process consists in dumping the figs into boxes after they 
have been exposed for two or three days and then allowing them to 
go through a sweat for fortj^-eight hours. After that time they are 
again exposed and the drying is finished in the sun. At the approach 
of showers the trays are stacked and covered with waterproof canvas. 
Every morning the dried figs are taken out. When all are dried they 
are separated into three different sizes. Ovens are used for inferior 
figs only.

-i-^ FIG CULTURE IN VARIOUS FOREIGN COUNTRIES. 53 

; : 1C ^ NORTHERN AND CENTRAL FRANCE. 



-"^ In the vieinitj^ of Paris fig culture rises to a prominent horticultural 

^y^ industry in at least two localities — at Argenteuil and at Frette. 

y^ ^ Through care and ingenuity most excellent figs are raised there in the 

t^^^^^^ open ground and under a climate not naturally adapted to the fig. 

During three hundred years Argenteuil has supplied Paris with fresh 

figs, and fig culture in that locality has reached a scientific development 

/ not known elsewhere. The methods followed there are superior to any 

employed elsewhere in similar or higher latitudes and produce better 

results than figs grown against walls and protected by mattings during 

the winter months. If the methods of Argenteuil and Frette were 

adopted in the United States fig culture would prove profitable even 

in a number of places in the vicinity of many of the large cities east 

of the Rocky Mountains, where there is alv^^ays a market for choice 

fruit. In the hope that such a culture will soon spring up a minute 

description is given of the processes used for perfecting or, as they 

call it, for *' educating " the figs in Argenteuil, 

LOCALITY AND CONDITION. 

The best place for a fig orchard is a w^rm exposure toward the 
south, sheltered as far as possible from heavy winds, as the latter 
destroy the fruit irreparabty. Locations free from spring frosts are, 
of course, to be preferred; in fact they should be the only ones 
selected, as late frosts retard the maturing of the figs and may even 
entirely spoil the crop. Argenteuil and Frette are favorably situated, 
but still they suffer from frosts in February and March almost every 
year. The best soil is calcareous loam of great depth and warmth. 

HOW TO START THE TREES. 

* The fig plantations are generally started from trees. These again 

are grown from cuttings about IG inches long, taken in February or 
March or as soon as the branches are disinterred. These are planted 
in nursery, leaving only two eyes above the ground. In November 
these cuttings will have obtained good roots, and as the leaves will 
then have fallen with the first frosts, the cuttings may be taken up 
and used for immediate planting. In case planting shall be delayed 
until the following spring it will be necessary to cover the rooted 
cuttings in a way similar to that done by tlie trees, the process of 
which will be described presently. 

FORMING THE ORCHARD. 

The trees are planted either singly or in rows, squares, or quincunx, 
about to 10 feet apart. No large plantations exist, as the great 
labor and care necessary for success would make supervision of large 
orchards impossible. The holes for the trees are dug about 3 feet 
square and about 2 feet deep. One or two trees are planted in every 
hole. When two trees are set in one hole this is done not only in 



54 THE fig: its history, culture, and curing. 

order to quickly get many fruit- bearing brandies, but also to cause 
the trunks to bend readily to the ground. If two are set they are 
planted 1 foot apart and in the general line of the row. The depth is 
regulated according to the size of the trees. All the old wood should 
be buried below the surface and only the season's wood exposed 
above. The trees are not set perpendicularly, but must be slanting 
or oblique with the surface, in order to facilitate the future bending 
of the trees. If the ground is level the two trees should form an obtuse 
angle with each other and a sharp angle with the surface; in other 
words, bend in opposite directions. If the surface is inclined, then 
both the trees should be slanting upward, in order that both may be 
equally well buried. After planting each tree is cut back to two eyes. 
If the planting has been done in November the young trees must be 
covered over with 1 or 2 feet of soil. At the end of February or the 
beginning of March this soil is removed and the ground worked 
over. Around each tree is made a basin about 8 to 12 inches deep 
and 2 or 3 feet in diameter, to hold the rain water or the artificial 
watering during the season. Thus planted, the trees are left to them- 
selves for the season. In the following November, after all the leaves 
have fallen, the soil is dug away from the tree to a depth of 10 inches, 
especially immediately below the principal branches. These are then 
carefully bent down into the trenches and Covered with about 14 inches 
of soil, the surface of which must be made convex, in order to shed 
the water. It is also important that no leaves, immature figs, grass, 
straw, or any other matter which possibly could decay should be left 
in the soil near the branches, as it would cause the latter to rot. If the 
branches do not readily remain in the ground they may be kept there 
with a bent peg similar to the pegs used in rooting layers. In Febru- 
ary, as soon as the frosts are over, the soil is taken away. The strong- 
est branches are pruned back to two or three eyes, while the weakly 
ones are removed entirely. It must be the endeavor to give to each 
fig bunch from 14 to 16 branches, but this ma}'^ be done gradually if 
good branches are not had the first or second season. The second 
season is devoted to forming these branches, the strong ones being 
encouraged, while the weak ones are cut away. 

The third season after the branches have been disinterred in Feb- 
ruary or March, the same pruning back to two or three eyes of last 
season's wood is practiced. In fact, all the operations of the preced- 
ing season are repeated, the cultivator so selecting his branches that 
the tree, or rather bush, will spread evenly in all directions, so that the 
branches will not interfere with one another. 

PINCHING THE TERMINAL BUDS. 

In the fourth season the fig trees or bushes begin to bear. The 
branches should not be disinterred until all the frost is over. But 
as late disinterring will cause corresponding late maturity, many 



FIG CULTURE IN VARIOUS FOREIGN COUNTRIES. 55 

growers disinter half of the trees at the end of February and the 
Other half at the end of March, which secures them at least a par- 
tial crop. As soon as the branches are out of the soil the terminal 
buds on all the side branches which are to bear fruit are removed by 
pinching, either by hand or by shears. The fruit-bearing branches 
will at this time show^ the young figs alongside the leaf bud. All 
branches intended to bear the following season are pruned back to 
two or four eyes. The skill and experience of the cultivator is here 
exercised in the selection of the proper branches. 

REMOVING THE SIDE BUDS. 

A few days after the last operation, designed to push the side buds and 
the figs, another operation takes place, which consists in suppressing 
or removing the side buds. On every side branch about one-half or 
more of the leaf buds are removed, but one or two eyes closest to the 
base should always be left to form fruit branches for the next year. 
One bud is also left higher up on the branch. On the Blanquette 
variety this operation is performed as soon as the buds show signs 
of starting — on the Dauphine Violette only when they have attained 
three small leaves; Care should be taken that the young figs are not 
injured or even touched. If they are, they will not come to maturity. 
The two lowest buds are preserved to form fruit-bearing branches for 
another year, and the upper bud is left to draw sap. 

The terminal branches are similarly treated, with the difference, 
however, that the terminal bud is left, with two others lower down, to 
form future fruit branches, at a distance from each other of about 12 
inches. A few days or weeks later, or when the remaining buds have 
grown out and formed small branches or spurs 2 or e3 inches in length, 
with a few leaves, they are cut from all lateral fruit branches, care 
being taken to leave one of the lowest as near the base as possible. 
The object in not removing them at once is to prevent the tree from 
being shocked and set back. After the last operation the branches 
will present this appearance: The terminal branches will have the 
terminal bud growing, with two more at equal distances lower down 
the stem; the side branches will have on/y one of the low^est buds 
growing and one near the top, w^hich latter, however, should never 
be allowed to assume more than five leaves, which are sufficient to 
draw the sap; but in preserving these buds and branches it is impor- 
tant that only those on the outer or lateral surfaces of the branch 
be preserved. The interior buds, if allowed to grow out, would be 
very difficult to cover with soil in winter. 

CARE DURING THE QROWINa SEASON. 

After the buds have been removed the branches should be carefully 
arranged in such a way that they will touch one another as little as 
possible. This is accomplished by the aid of crotches or pegs, which 



56 THE fig: its history, culture, and curing. 

are set in the ground to hold the branches apart. All leaves which in 
any way touch the figs should be removed, as they bruise the fruit and 
spoil its appearance. 

At the maturing of the fruit it often happens, especially with the 
Dauphine variety, that the fruit is too near the soil. The branches 
m ust then be somewhat elevated with studs or the fruit will spoil ; but in 
no case must the elevation be such as to raise the branches in an 
upright position — merely enough to bring the fruit above the ground. 
If raised too high the fruit will not ripen. In order to guard against 
spring frost the fig bushes are covered with light mattings early in the 
morning or in the evening when danger of frost is apparent. Another 
method is to create smoke by burning tar, strawy and damp wood an 
hour before and after sunrise. 

PRUNING BEARING FIG TREES. 

The first ripe figs are picked at the end of July, the last at the end 
of August. As soon as the last figs are harvested the fig trees are 
pruned. This operation consists in removing the wood which bore 
the figs just harvested, while the wood is cut close to the branch 
immediately below. The dead wood is then removed, as well as use- 
less suckers, and all which are not destined to produce fruit-bearing 
branches in coming years. The branches which are to bear the next 
season's crop are not pruned, as such proceeding would ruin the crop. 
The next season, after the trees are disinterred, the process of pinch- 
ing the terminal and secondary buds is again gone through with, after 
which time no new treatment is required; but after the branches 
have reached a length of G to 10 feet they are too long to be practically 
handled and covered and must then be removed, not all at once, but 
gradually, a few a year, and new suckers allowed to take their place. 

In covering the branches after the trees have begun to bear it will 
be best to tie them in small bundles, 4, 6, or 8, according to the 
size of the tree. As a result of being covered yearly these branches 
never regain their natural vertical direction, but lean more or less 
horizontally. This also hastens the maturity of the fruit and is an 
element of success in the growing of figs in cold regions. Previous 
to covering the branches all leaves and figs should be removedj as 
they cause decay. 

COVERING THE TREES. 

Every year, in November, the fig trees must be interred in the soil, 
in a way similar to that already described for the cuttings. This, 
of course, is the chief work of the season, and entails as much labor 
as almost all other operations combined. If the trees have been 
planted slanting properly the difficulty of bending the branches is 
not great. On level ground the trenches should run in every direc- 
tion from the root, but on sloping ground they should always run up 
the hill or somewhat sideways. 



KTG OITLTURE IN VARIOUS FOREIGN COUNTRIES. 57 

In covering tlie trees can^ should be taken to make the trenches as 
nearly horizontal as possible and. not less than a foot deep, and to raise 
the soil sufficiently above to insure against both cold and damp. The 
C3 liter of the tree should be covered more deeply, and a small hill, 
several inches high, should in winter designate the place where the 
roots go down. This is necessary to shed the water and protect the 
roots from excess of moisture. In removing the soil the next February 
or March a cloudy daj^ should be chosen, the afternoon of a rainy or 
cloudy day being best. If disinterred in bright and warm sunshine 
the change is too great and the trees may suffer from being scorched 
by the sun. 

\ ./ OILING THE FIGS. 

^. In southern France — in Argenteuil and in Frette — a process is per- 

rmed called ' ' appreter les figues " oTJvg^s teTn'n c y the fi g ^ In Argenteuil 

and in Frette it is employed on all the figs which are desired to ripen 

^^ - ^-^arly, the proper time for this process being of the utmost importance. 

If done too early the figs will not ripen at all, but will dry and spoil. 

The x>roper time is when the fig b egins to co lor fl,nd the skin begins to 

/ / * ,• ^ feel soft, or about seventeen days before it would regularly mature if 

^ ^^^.....-^efb alone. Toward evening, if posvsible, a single drop of good olive 

oil is placed on the eye of the fig, care being taken not to spread the 

oil. The oil is placed on the eye by means of a wheat straw and in 

such a way as to touch only the center of the eye. The next day the 

fig shows a change and in nine or ten days it may be cut, perfectly 

ripe, the operation having hastened the ripening of the fig certainly 

from six to eight days. Such treated figs are also better, sweeter; and 

with smaller seeds than those which have not been oTled. 

VARIETIES AND CROPS. 

As before stated, only the first-crop figs come to maturity in that 
part of northern France under consideration, and only fig varieties 
which produce such figs are grown. The one most generally grown in 
Argenteuil is the Blanquette; at Frette the Dauphine Violette, a later 
but better variety, is the favorite. The Rouge de la Frette and the 
Observantine are also cultivated to a limited extent. 

In Argenteuil alone 200 acres are devoted to figs. In Frette very 
many less. The value of the crop in Argenteuil, in 1884, was 100,000 
francs. 

Along the coast of Brittany, principally at Croisic and Cherbourg, 
fig culture is quite extensive, the mild coast climate being much more 
favorable to the fig tree than that of the interior of central France. 
Strangely enough, the varieties most cultivated are one with perfectly 
developed male flowers and another with degenerate male flowers. 
On the Channel Islands the fig tree assumes the shape and size of a 
small tree and requires no prote(*.tion during the winter.

POINTS OF SUCCESSFUL CULTIVATION. 

The following are the essential points in successful fig culture in 
the open air in all northern districts where the climate is too rigorous 
to allow standards: 

( 1 ) In clining the i irees when planting in order to facilitate the yearly viter^ 
ment of the trees. 

(2) Se mi horizo ntal position of the branches, in order that they may catch as 
much air and heat as possible; otherwise the fruit will not ripen. 

(3) The consequential dwarfing of the trees and total absence of a trunk or 
standard above the ground. 

(4) The yearly practices of procuring and forcing fruit branches and fruit, 
which consists in pinching the "terminal buds, suppressing the lateral buds; 
removing the fruiting branches as soon as the crop is harvested; preparin.j^ new 
fruit-bearing branches for the next season; these should always be situated as 
close to the main stems as possible, etc. 

(5) The yearly interment of the branches, which necessitates the previous 
removal of all leaves, figs, and dead wood. 

(6; The subsequent divsinterment of the branches, which is always to be done in 
cloudy or rainy weather, in order that the change may not be too sudden. 

(7 ) The r enewal of the main branches every twelve to fifteen years, as by that 
time tney begin to beToo old and too stiff to cover in winter.

much larger. The following table gives an idea of the trade for five

The principal consumers of French dried figs are Belgium and 
Switzerland. The countries whicli supply France are Turkey, Italy, 
Spain, Portugal, and Greece. 

/ . '.' FIG CULTURE IN ENGLAND. 

V,-^'' Fig culture in England dates back several hundred years. It is 

more than probable that the first figs were introduced by the Romans, 

* -• but that the trees died outworn want pf qi\vq and knowledge after 

^'^/:^the Romans had left the country. Plantations were confined to the 

, / southern countries and were probably never generally cultivated. In 

^^^ffie reign of Henry VIII the fig was again introduced, it is said, by 

^•■^' Cardinal Pole, wlio broiigKl the trees from Italy. Ilortus Kewensis 

tells of fig trees being planted in England in 15-18, and Gerard says 

in 1507 that the fruit of the fig tree "never comelTi to maturity with

US except the tree be planted under a hot wall." In 1629 Parkin- 
son said: "If you plant it not against a brick wall, it will not ripen 
so kindly." And later on, in 1640, the same author says, in Thea- 
trum Botanicum: "The bleu figge is no doubt of the same opera- 
tion with the white to all purposes, but the fruit commeth most to ^ -' / 
maturity with us, and is eaten with great pleasure with salt and <-^^, : 
pepper." After the middle of tlie^seyen tfieTith centur y we may con-"( S V^ ' ' 
sider iig culture Avell established in Eng land. As late as 1822 a tree ^ 
was seen in the bofaiucaTgarden of regius professor of Hebrew in 
Oxford University. The tree was planted by Dr. Pocock in 1622, 
and must have then been nearly 200 years old. In the eighteenth cen- /^-^^ * ' 
tury the fig orchards of Tarring, near Worthing, in Sussex, were ^«iv»^ ^ ^"^\. 
famous and proved very profitable. These orchards were grown as5<n-^» ^ » ^-^'^ 
standards, and the crowns of the trees were said to have been 40 feet 
in diameter. They seldom ripened more than the first crop. In the \ ^ + ^./nr v 

beginning of the last century some of these Farring trees were 40 feet V' 

high and ripened two crops a year. In our day fig trees are quite com- ' 
mon in gardens in the southern countries of England and grown 
principally against walls. The first crop is_al wavs the one which is 
depended upon, the second crop being generally too late to ripe n. 
The trees are not pruned where the culture is properly understood. 
By far the greatest number of fig trees are grown in England under 
glass, or at least under winter covering, and a large number of varie- 
ties has been imported from foreign countries. Under glass both 
crops come to maturity. For outdoor cultivation the favorites, as 
being the most hardy, are Brown Turkey and Brunswick. Dr. Hogg, 
who is the English authority on figs, recommends the following varie- 
ties for English gardens : 

(1) For standards: Black Ischia, Brown Isehia, Brown Turkey. 

(2) For walls: Black Genoa, Black Ischia, Brown Ischia, Brown Turkey, Bruns- 
wick, Castle Kennedy, White Marseillaise. 

(3) For forcing in pots: Angelique, Black Ischia, Brown Ischia, Early Violet, 
Negro Largo, Pregussata, White Ischia, White Marseillaise. 

The Frette and Argenteuil methods described elsewhere are not 
adopted in England. Of course all figs grown in England, either out- 
doors or in pots, are consumed fresh and bring a good price in the 
market. In England an immense number of fig trees is grown in 
pots in storehouses, and such culture has been most profitable, as well 
as insuring a continuous crop -of figs for many months in the year. 
The most convenient sizes of pots are those of 12 to 15 inches for 
fruiting trees, but smaller pots may also answer. While at rest the 
pots are kept in cool houses free from frost. The best soil for pots 
consists of three-fourths sandy loam, the balance mortar crushed 
fine. Repotting is done in October, just before the leaves fall. The 
soil should be moderately rich, liquid manure being applied when 
required.-

When starting in the sprinir a temperature of 50° should first be 
given, later increased to G0°. Give as much sun as possible and 
keep the air moist. It is a mistake to keep the air very dry. Fresh 
air should be given when the temperature outside reaches 75°, and 
the inner temperature should then be brought up to 95° or 100°. 

A single standard is best. When the new shoots reach 6 inches 
they should be pinched back and checked. By a successive pinching 
of respective shoots a successive crop of figs may be had. 

Weak growth should be cut off and thinned out close to the stem 
to prevent shading. During fruiting the air should be kept much 
drier and the temperature should be even. Any check in the 
growth of the trees during fruiting time may cause the figs to fall 
before maturity. The most favored varieties and those most readily 
grown in pots are Brown Turkey, Negro Largo, Violette Sepor, and 
St. Johns.

The import of dried figs to Great Britain now averages yearly about 
200,000 hundredweight. The greatest quantity, or about 15,000,000 
pounds, comes from Italy; Spain furnishes about 5,000 pounds; Portu- 
gal, Greece, and Turkey, small quantities. 



FIG CULTURE IN SPAIN. 



The production of figs in Spain is enormous and large quantities 
are exported to France, Austria, etc., principally for distilling. In 
1882, 1,100 packages or mats of dried figs were exported from Malaga 
to the United States. In 1800 this district produced 1G,000 quintals, 
which in 1823 had risen to 20,000 quintals. 

Cuttings are planted slanting, and grafting is done in April, while 
the eye is yet dormant, but after the sap has started flowing. 

The following are some of the most favored varieties in the vicinity 
of Valencia: 

(1) Gombaya, — Rose to bright rose; stem of tree blackish; requires moist soils. 
(2)_ BurJa sot, — One of the best figs in Spain, as well as in the Mediterranean 
genera ly. Fruit black, round, and flat at apex. Tree with weeping branchei. 

(3) Verdal and Gironnetta. — Small, green figs, round, very sweet. Skin thick 
and hard, of bright green color; pulp red. 

(4) Palopal and Napolitan, — Fruit very large and fine.

^t-^^xv^r CULTURE IN THE SOUTHERN STATES OF NORTH AMERICA. 



Vffet 



While the fig tree grows and bears well in the Southern and Gulf 
' (fetates of the United States of America, it is not raised there as a com- 
. ^ ^^oV'inercial product, except on a very limited scale. The cause must be 
sought in the climate of the region, so unlike that found in the Medi- 
terranean districts. While in the latter the, wi nters are m ild, with 
f^w iiiPists and rainless summers, the Southern States are frequently- 
visited by heavy winter or spring frosts, the su mmers being more or 
less rainy. In the wintei'^Bie trees^are often killed or seriously 
injured by frost, while in the wet summers the figs rot and mold, and 
drying out of doors is made difficult. 

In favorable seasons only do the figs attain a certain perfection in 
maturity and sweetness and are then very good and palatable. Even 
in such season drying and curing out of doors is not attended with suc- 
cess. As a consequence no large fig plantations ex ist in these States, 
the tree being principally grown for home use. In such capacity it 
is found everywhere, especially toward the extreme south, along 
the Gulf of Mexico. While the fig may not be profitably grown in the 
Southern States, if the object is to prepare them by drying for the 
markets, it is nevertheless certain that fig culture may there be made 
profitable. For canning, making jams, jellies, fig sauce, and other 
fig preserves, the fig of the Southern States may be made available 
with little expense or difficulty. Of late years a most delicious pre- 
serve is made from the Celeste fig. It is being extensively placed on 
the market in the form of canned goods, and is considered by some 
persons as superior to any put up for commercial purposes in any of 
the Pacific States. In Louisiana and in parts of Texas the fig does well 
and requires no especial care in cultivation. In the pine lands of 
Mississippi, Alabama, Georgia, Florida, and South Carolina they 
require more attention in the way of fertilizing to produce favorable 
crops. Of late years Florida fruit growers have given considerable 
attention to fig growing, but the results have not yet been such as to 
warrant extended plantations. The rainy summers are the principal 
drawback to the perfect ripening of the fruit. 

GEORGIA. 

In the Gulf region, especially near the coast, many varieties do 
exceedingly well and produce very delicious figs, but of a regular fig 
industry there is no trace. In time it may come. The following 
account is from letters received from Mr. P. J. Berckmans, of Augusta, 
Ga._ It plainly shows that very much remains to be done for fig cul- 
ture in that vicinity: 

Here we cultivate with success Brown Turkey, Celestial, Green Ischia, Black 
Ischia, and Brunswick. These are, all things considered, the most desirable kinds 
and are usually found uuder cultivation. I have some 20 varieties, of which some 
are occasionally successful, but not as reliable as those named above. Of this 
class I name: Blue Genoa, good but not prolific; Violette Ronde and Violette 
LoDgue, both of fair quality, but unproductive and apt to crack before maturity. 



62 THE FI(4 : IT8 HISTORY, CULTURE, AND CURING. 

Angeliqne or Concoarelle Blanche, small, of poor quality; Marseilles Blanche, not 
productive; Nerii, very good but very unproductive, except in the immediate sea- 
coast belt; Pregussata, very good, but a shy bearer; Black Havana, very prolific 
and of good quality, but tender; San Pedro and White Adriatic are re^lar^y 
winter killed here and are undesirable even in Florida; White Four Seasons, very 
dry and inferior, but prolific; Madeleine Blanche, unproductive; Jaune Hative is 
very similar to Angeliqne; Lemon (probably White Genoa), excellent but unpro- 
ductive here; succeeds well on the coast; Rouge Longue de Provence, of second 
quality, unproductive; Superfine de la Saussaye; this I believe to be the same as 
Violette Longue; White Smyrna— we have three varieties under this name, all 
inferior, and we can not arrive at a correct nomenclature. 

The following description of the curing of the fig in Georgia is given 
by one of the growers there : 

Gather the figs when the skin begins to crack (this is a sign of maturity and 
the fruit then contains the largest amount of saccharine matter). Make a strong 
lye of oak ashes, or take common cooking soda dissolved in hot water. Dip the figs 
in the hot liquid, leaving them there for only a few seconcis; expose immediately 
to the air for a minute or two and repeat the dipping a second time. If the lye is 
hot and strong enough the color of the fig will immediately change, the dark- 
skinned varieties to a dark green, and the light-colored varieties to a pale green. 
The object of dipping the fresh figs in hot lye or a solution of bicarbonate of soda 
is to kill the milky juice and thus hasten the drying. A basket loosely made so as 
to allow the liquid to come freely in contact with the fruit is always desirable for 
use in dipping. Place the figs upon trays made of wooden slats and expose 
fully to the sun, taking the fruit under cover every evening, as it will spoil if the 
dews fall upon it. The fruit must be turned in the sun every day, and in three 
to four days it will be ready to put away in small wooden boxes, putting a layer 
of spice laurel leaves (Laurus nobilis) at the bottom and covering the top with 
another layer of these leaves. Place the lid on tightly to keep insects out, and 
keep in a dry room. If a brick oven is convenient it will facilitate the work and 
hasten the drying, but care must be taken not to give too much heat. If the fruit 
secretes sirup it has been put under too high degree of heat, and the result will be 
an inferior article. After the fruit is partially dried it should be lightly pressed 
by the hand to flatten it. Light -colored varieties are the best for drying, but 
the Celestial and Brown Turkey are much richer in quality, althotigh presenting 
a darker and less attractive appearance. 

The Celestial dries the most readily of all our varieties, but makes 
the least valuable article as regards quality. The Brunswick, being 
very large, seldom gives good results with ordinary means, but will 
doubtless be easily managed with improved drying apparatus. 

The figs generally grown in the Southern States are the Celestial, 
Brunswick, Ischia, Brown Turkey, and half a dozen more varieties 
with local and uncertain names. 

FIG CULTURE IN MEXICO. 
BAJA CALIFORNIA AND SONORA. 

These two States of Mexico are well adapted to fig culture, especially 
the former. In Baja California the fig crop not only furnishes con- 
siderable food, but a considerable amount is exported to the other 
States of Mexico, though as far as known none go elsewhere. The

gs, which are black and of the Mission variety, are grown princix)ally 
in the central portion of the peninsula, from Purisiina and Comondii 
to La Paz. Irrigation is required, as rains are seldom of sufficient 
quantity to sustain the tree"aiid mature its fruit, excejil" possibly in 
the mountain regions in the vicinity of natural springs or creeks. 

Nowhere is less care taken in the cultivation of figs aiid in prepar- 
ing them for market. The ligs are simpl}^ dried on the smooth ground, 
on the top of the flat-roofed houses, on mats, or on anything else con- 
venient. When dried and shriveled they are i)acked in 100-pound 
^^ackages, the receptacles being made of rawhide of cattle and sewed 
Together. These packages are very strong and stand the roughest 
handling. The figs are sticky, sirupy, and sweet, but inferior from 
want of care in curing and handling. They are sweeter than the 
same variety dried in California, and as well flavored as this kind of 
figs can be. Considerable quantities of black Mission figs are dried 
At Purisima. These figs are split before drying and sprinkled with 

ise seed. They are very good. The brebas are here used for dry- 
ing in preference to the later crop. 

In the mountains of the cape region from La Paz to San Jose del 
Cabo wild figs called the " Salate " are not uncommon, especially at a 
height of 1,000 to 3,000 feet in the canyons or on the northern slopes. 
This fig tree {Ficus palrtieri)^ which carries a small, edible, round fig 
of poorest quality, is an evergreen tree. 

The climate for producing superior figs is unexcelled on this i>enin- 
sula, and there is no doubt that Baja California has a great iuture as 
a fig-growing country. In Sonora, on the Mexican mainland, two or 
more species of evergreen wild figs are found in the mountains, all 
liaving edible fruits, but small and of poor quality. The writer saw no 
variety in Sonora except the Mission black i\g (PI. VI, fig. 1 ), the fruit of 
which is consumed fresh. The blac k brebas o r iirst-crop figs are large 
and really very fine. They ripen in May and have a great local reputa- 
tion, the greater as fruits of aTT kinds are comparatively scarce in 
Sonora. No dried figs are prepared in Sonora; at least none worth 
mentioning. Still it is believed the climate would be suitable. The 
brebas or first crop is ended in May, and the second crop matures in. 
July. It could be dried and all out of the wa^^ before the rain sets in. 

The climate of this part of Mexico and I>aja California is dry, but 
the air is damper than in upper California. Rain falls from June or 
July to November. The dry season extends from November to June 
or longer. Little rain falls, and after a shower the ground dries 
quickly. Frost is rare. In summer the thermometer frequently 
reaches 115°, especiallj^ around Hermosillo and Guaymas.

CHAPTER III. 
FIG CULTURE IN CALIFORNIA. 

HISTORICAL NOTES. 



The first fig trees in Gklifornia were brought b}^ tlie mission fathers 
of the Franciscan order. Where the first trees were planted and 
whence they came no one can now tell, but it is known that they 
must have come with the first missionaries in the eigliteenthcentu^, 
who planted thein with the "olive and the vTneT Unlike the latter 
two, there was only one kind of fig, now known as the ''Mission fi^" 
indicating that it was raised frojm^j^nttjTi gs ^nd rjot frrtm seed. As 
the same Mission fig is the only hg variety extensively distributed in 
Mexico, it is safe to presume that the fig came from there, and not 
from Spain or Portugal or Chile, as is generally supposed. From 
Mexico the Mission fig spread to several of the Southern States, 
aRlioiigli it aj^tpears to have thriven less tliere than in California. 
The Mission fig must have be en__brought to Mexico centurie s before, 
probably with the early missionaries^. frojii Spain after the conquest 
of the Mex ican coun try. For a century the Mission fig was the only 
fig in California, the only fig cultivated, or rather planted, around 
the ''missions," the only one found on the Mexican ranches, and was 
sparsely distributed over the country. With the arrival of Ameri- 
cans some of the immigrants from foreign^ countries brduglit fig 
cuttings from tKeir cherished trees to plant in their new homes, and 
this will account for some odd varieties ^-et growing in out-of-the-way 
corners, and for others of which we yet hear some early settlers 
tell — trees which were long ago cut down or otherwise destroyed. 
With the advent of the. oO's some systematic efforts were made to 
import other kinds of figs. The first importations came, of course, 
from American Eastemnursery men, and the first figs consisted of 
varieties cultivated under glass in these Eastern States, which 
accounts for the littTe^stnTsequent value of those varieties for out- 
door culture. Among such varieties were Brunswick, Ischia, 
Brown Turke}-, and a few others. Next came importations from 
English nurserymen; later from French nurserymen; but only within 
the last decade have efforts been made to import directly from foreign 
countries. * . 

To give a Jist of all such importations would be of considerable 
interest to the student of California figs and tlieir history, but it has 
been impossible to collect all the information required, and reference

will only be made to a few of the most prominent of such introduc- 
Lj o^ tions. While there has undoubtedly been a number of small importa- 
rr tions, there are a few which require special mention. 
\^ k^ In the mountainous parts of central California we find Felix Gillet 
^v'^'^-^as one importer of French fig varieties. In Stockton, W. B. West 
^ imported from various countries. John Rock, of Niles, has at vari- 
^ 'lis times brought large collections of figs to this State. G. P. 
, Rixford wasthe first to b rin^ tUe true Smyrna figs here direct from 
S myrna in 1880, while in southern California the late John Grelck, a 
horticulturist of great knowledge and foresight, imported and dis- 
tributed many valuable French figs. Another importer who should 
not be forgotten — ^his enthusiasm was certainly very great — was the 
late G. N. Milco, of Stockton, who brought a number of Dalmatian 
figs (Cernica, Zimitza, Kargigna) to California. . Between 1882 and 
1885 the authoFiinp6iTO(tT50me""30va^ of figs from France. In 

the latter year W. C. West wa^sent byF. Roeding jia Smyrna and sub- 
sequently sent here several varieties of Smyrna figs. F. Pohndorff, 
then of Niles or vicinit}'', imported the White San Pedro under the name 
of Breba from Spain and distributed it in this country in 1883 or 1884. 
Dr. J. D. B. Stillman, of Lugonia, visited Smyrna in 1878 and selected 
Smyrna cuttings, which were, it is supposed, finally planted in Cali- 
fornia. Nothing came of this importation, as the box containing the 
cuttings could not be traced with certainty after its arrival here, and 
the figs which Dr. Stillman supposed to be Smyrna figs were proven 
afterwards to be Brown Turkey, and undoubtedly never came from 
Smyrna. Finally, it may be added, a Greek gentleman, Mr. Honche- 
renko, lately living somewhere between Niles and San Ramon Valley, 
has imported and grown a number of varieties from his native country. 
One of the earliest importers w as W. B. We^ t»,than whom none is 
more worthy of being remembered. In 1853 he imi)orted from Hovey 
& Co., of Boston, White Genoa, White Marseilles, White Ischia, 
Brown Ischia, Brunswick, and Brown Turke y, which figs Avere' all 
propagatedT and widely distributed over the State. In 1869 Mr. 
West imported from France, through English houses, from 28 to 30 
varieties of figs for the table and some for drying. They came via 
Panama in good order. He saved 16 varieties, but found only a few 
of them of any value in Stockton. Among these figs Mr. West 
received the Adriatic under another name (Verdoni?), now forgotten 
by him, and it is probable that to this importation the large grove 
of Adriatics at Knights Ferry, in Calaveras County-, Cal., owes its 
origin. A few years later, in 1878, Mr. West went to the Mediterra- 
nean to study fruit culture. He selected there several varieties of 
figs, of which he has, however, unfortunately destroyed the record; 
but among these figs was the famous Neapolitan hg ^' Trojano." This 
fig did not prove satisfactory at Stockton and was never distributed. 



THE fig: its history, culture, and curing. 



As a rule Mr. West found that the fine varieties which he imported 
produced much better figs in tlie foothills of the sierra than in Stock- 
\, - ton, and he was the first to recognize this region as superior for fig 
"S v:. culture. 

. • Among California importers John Rock stands most prominent. He 

has imported figs at various times from foreiirn countries, and pos- 
sesses now the most extensive collection on the Pacific coast. The 
trees are at Niles, Cal., not far from San Francisco. Of the earlier 
importations there is no record, but in the spring of 1883 he received 
from Thomas Rivers & Son the following figs: Barnissotte Grise, 
Angelique, Col di Signora Bianca, De Constantine, Negro Largo, 
Early Violet, Lardaro, Black Marseilles, Drap d'Or, Whi teTTeTtb a, 

Bondance Precoce, Brown Ischia, Pro- 
lific, Monaco Bianco, Brunswick, Bour- 
jassotte Grise, Rocardi, Col di Signora 
Nera, Grosse Grise Bifere, Royal Vine- 
yard, Hirta, Brown Turkey, Ronde 
Violette Hative, White Marseilles, 
Bourjassotte Blanche, White Ischia, 
Du Roi (fig. 8), Agen, Dore Norbus, 
Pasteliere, Raby Castle, Bourjassotte 
Noire, Grassale, Black Ischia, Ronde 
Noire. In 1889 he received the fol- 
lowing figs from a house in Provence, 
France: Salette, Martale, Rosso di 
Mensiglia, Grosse Violette, Des Dames, 
Bianca Morcati, Angelique, Avarcugo, 
Crovere, De Calabria, A Feuilles Tri- 
lobes, Courcourelle, Giallo Verde, Gi- 
allo Rotondo, Negrondo, Madalena, 
Aubique Leroy, Ronde Rouge de Pro- 
vence, Imperial, Rolandina, Turco di 
Constantinople, Mascula. In the fall 
of 1890 the Department of Agriculture at Washington, D. C, sent to 
Mr. Rock the Trojano, Dottato, Brizanzola, and Guigliana; and from 
a local nurseryman were received in 1891 the Capri, Smyrna, Verdale 
Lontgue, Cernica, Zemitza, etc. 

Felix Gillet, of Nevada City, Cal., has at various times imported 
from France figs of the following varieties: Pagaudiere, Noir Mou- 
tier, Buissonne, Madeleine Blanche, Grosse Marseillaise, Datte, De 
Versailles, Franch Paillarde, Napolitaine, Verdale. These were 
imported in 1874. The following varieties were sent to Mr. F. Gillet 
from tlie United States Department of Agriculture, Washington, D. C, 
and are now being tried by him: Dalmatino, Broghetto, Rubaldo 
(undoubtedly Rubado), San Piero, Dottato, and San Vito.

FIG CULTURE IN CALIFORKIA. 67 

THE BULLETIN IMPORTATION. 

The importation of the genuine Smyrna figs to California was first 
due to G. P. Rixford, at that time connected with the San Francisco 
Evening Bulletin, which was then the acknowledged authority on 
horticultural matters in California. The following account is taken 
from the edition of that paper of October 17, 1888 and is. it is 
believed, from the pen of Mr. Rixford himself: 

IMPORTATION OF FIG CUTTINGS. ' 

Believing the soil and climate of California perfectly adapted to the growth of 
fruit equal to that imported from Asia Minor, also believing that failure to pro- 
duce such fruit in the State was due to the absence of the right variety of trea, in 
1880 the business management of this journal determined to make an effort to 
introduce a tree which produces the true fig of commerce, with the view of plac- 
ing it in the hands of the subscribers of this journal throughout the State. In 
furtherance of this object the assistance of the Hon. E. J. Smithers, then United 
States consul at Smyrna, was solicited in procuring and shipping to New York, 
thence to be forwarded by rail across the continent, a lot of 500 cuttings of the 
best variety obtainable in that country. On the 1st of May. 1880, the following 
letter was received from Consul Smithers: 

CJONSULATK OF THE UNITED STATES, 

Smyrna, March 31, 1880 
Bulletin Company, San Francisco, 

Gentlemen: Yours of January 24, requesting my services in procuring and for- 
warding some fig cuttings for distribution among the subscribers of your paper, 
was received on the 8d instant, together with a draft on London. 

Immediately after the receipt of your letter I sent a trustworthy man to the fig 
district, situated about 75 miles from Smyrna. Owing to the severe stormy 
weather which prevailed at the time, the cuttings did not reach Smyrna until the 
10th instant. I then learned that there would be no steamer for Liverpool before 
the end of the montl;i, and deemed it better not to complete the packing until the last 
moment. The case was successfully shipped on the 29th, and the steamer left to- 
day. As directed, the bill of lading was forwarded to H. K. Thurber & Co., New 
York, and Richard Stewart, 11 Manchester Building, Liverpool, has been requested 
to look after its transshipment. 

The case is 5 feet in length, 3 feet wide, and 2^ feet high. It contains 448 plants, 
packed in rich clay loam, such as the fig trees flourish the best in here. The pack- 
ing took place under my supervision, and was after the plan of your letter. The 
top of the case is fastened down with screws, so that it can be easily opened at New 
York, and the plants, if they sh:uld need it, watered. 

It is not possible to obtain rooted trees in this country, the fig-orchard men pre- 
ferring to plant the cuttings in the field where the tree is to remain. My man 
was informed that owing to the warm weather in February it was too late to 
remove rooted trees, otherwise I could have sent you a small number. » * * 

I inclose herewith a statement of expenses incurred, which, 5'ou will perceive, do 
not exceed your remittance. There being no drays in Smyrna, the heavy case 
had to be moved by porters and then by lighter to the ship lying some distance in 
the bay. 

Hoping that your undertaking will be more successful than the others that have 
preceded it, I remain, gentlemen, very sincerely, yours, 

E. J. Smithers. 

^In these cuttings Mr. W. B, West, of Stockton, had a one-fourth interest, and 
upon the arrival of the cuttings he took his share to his Stockton nursery and prop- 
agated his cuttings there. Governor Leland Stanford was also interested in this 
importation, the success of which was mainly due to his aid in facilitating rapid 
transit across the continent, and to the fact that he paid most of the expenses. 
His share of the cuttings was planted on his Vina Ranch, in Sacramento Valley. 



fi8 THE fig: its history, COLTITRE, AND CURING. 

Allusion is made in the letter to two unsuccessful attempts to forward ship- 
ments of fig trees to this city, one of which was completely dried out and dead 
on its arrival, and the other was mislaid somewhere while en route and never 
reached its destination at all. 

The case of trees forwarded by Mr. Smithers did not reach this city until the 
8th of June, 1880. A considerable portion of the wood had rotted, and the season 
was so far advanced that the cuttings, when planted, although the greatest care 
was taken with them, made but a feeble growth. However, 200 of them had 
formed roots during the summer and promised in time to make thrifty trees. To 
distribute this small number was altogether out of the question, where each of 
several thousands of our applying subscribers was expecting to receive a tree. 
About this time Consul Smithers arrived in San Francisco, en route to Chin Kiang, 
China, to which consulship he had just been promoted* He informed us that at 
the time the shipment was made he had caused to be planted 4,000 cuttings, which 
had in the meantime become rooted trees and which we could purchase from the 
party who then owned them at from 8 to 10 cents each, the usual price of trees in 
Asia Minor. It was then determined, rather than disappoint our subscribers who 
were exi)ecting their promised fig trees that season, to import the whole lot. 
Funds were therefore forwarded to an agent in Smyrna to purchase the trees 
referred to and to ship them at once. About the 1 st of April, instead of the trees, a 
letter, dated February 16, came to hand, from which the following paragraph is 
taken: 

I have had Mr. at my office, who says that the 4,000 cuttings he had planted, 

and to which your order refers (on E. J. Smithers "s suggestion), have by this time 
grown up into strong young trees from 4 to 6 feet high, and he is offered $1 per 
tree at the nursery at Aidin. He says he can not afford now to part with them at 
anything under $1.25 each from this port (first cost). 

The owner of the trees was an Armenian, a race of notoriously sharp traders, and 
put the price up to an exorbitant figure, because he thought he could get it, and 
probably has the trees on hand yet, the story of the offer from another purchaser 
being most likely a pure invention. 

Correspondence with our agent, a prominent merchant in Smyrna, was kept up 
during the summer, and in September, 1881, orders were sent to make a large 
shipment of cuttings to the Bulletin Company, which we found could be obtained 
at a reasonable price. Every precaution had been taken to secure th'e safe arrival 
of this consignment, even to shipping moss from New York in which to pack the 
cuttings. The cases, on arrival at New York, were repacked by Peter Henderson 
& Co. before starting them across the continent. 

The shipment consisted of 14,000 good cuttings, and arrived in excellent condi- 
tion. A large portion of these cuttings were distributed early in 1882 to Bulletin 
subscribers in all parts of the State. It was estimated that about one-third of this 
first distribution escaped destruction by gophers, drought, and other casualties. 
Many of these were planted in unsuitable soil and unfavorable locations as to 
climate, so that but few favorable reports were received regarding them after they 
were old enough to commence bearing. In most localities the trees made a ram- 
pant growth, but the fruit dropped before ripening. Parties who had visited the 
fig orchards of Asia Minor were sure that we had been imposed upon, and had 
received some wild and worthless variety which grows along the fences and divid- 
ing walls of that country. Much other adverse criticism, principally from busi- 
ness rivals, was published, and further information was sought from our agent in 
Smyrna. He wrote that it was impossible that wild cuttings were sent, as it was 
easier and cheaper to get the best, as that variety was most abundant; and further- 
more, that " the cuttings were obtained from one of the most renowned orchards 
in the Aidin Province.*' About this time E. J. Smithers, for twenty yearf United 



riG CULTURE IN CALIFORNIA. 69 

States consul at Smyrna, was in San Francisco again, and was taken to our nurs- 
ery of fig trees. At that time the trees were covered with fruit, and he at once 
said that they could not be the wild fig, for the reason that the wild variety never 
attained so large a size as the fruit on the trees before him. He was satisfied that 
the variety was all right. W. B. West, of Stockton, who has probably imported 
more kinds of fig trees, and first brought to notice the Verdone, an Italian variety, 
which has been christened *' White Adriatic," in this State than any other man 
in California, 'and who had a part of our importation, never for a moment doubted 
that he had the right variety. Feeling convinced from reports from a few favored 
localities that we had made no mistake, several thousand more cuttings were dis- 
tributed in the winter of 1882-83 and again in 1885-86. These further distributions 
thoroughly disseminated the variety. 

As Mr. Rixf ord says, much adverse criticism was made on the failure 
of the Bulletin figs to ripen their fruit, and many who ought to have 
known better pronounced the figs wild figs, which had been maliciously 
substituted by the Syrians. It is now known that this was an error 
and that the varieties were the genuine Smyrna figs. On the other 
hand, many reports came in stating that the Bulletin figs had borne 
fruit. Among the reports which caused the greatest sensation was 
one made by a gentleman at the fruit-growers' meeting in Chico, 
November 22, 1888. This long controversy can not now be referred 
to in detail. Enough to say, the gentleman submitted dried figs sup- 
posed to have come from two Bulletin figs growing on his place 
in , Cal. The figs were said to have been cured without sul- 
phuring. It is now known that these figs were not the Bulletin figs, 
but simply the ''Adriatic," and that the figs had been sulphured before 
drying in order to give them a good color. It is now absolutely certain 
that no Bulletin figs have come to perfect maturity in California 
without artificial pollination, as has been described elsewhere, and 
the nature of this fig variety is such that they never can fully mature 
without pollinatirfn or caprification, this being a conclusive proof of 
their being the genuine Smyrna figs of commerce. 

The history of the Gentile fig in California has somewhat the touch 
of a romance. In 1851 or 1852 Mr. Robert Farlay, of San Leandro, 
Alameda County, found a small package outside of the post-office in 
San Francisco. It contained two cuttings, which were planted in his 
nursery. The tree was killed by gophers, but a cutting was saved 
and grown, and gradually became large. Farlaj^ propagated the fig 
tree and sold trees around the country. In 1886 Dr. Ed. Kimball, of 
Ilayward, took a cutting from a large tree of this fig growing in the 
town of Hayward and planted it on his place near the town. The 
original Hayward tree is now cut down, but Dr. Kimball's tree is yet 
a fine large tree bearing well. The writer has seen other trees of this 
same kind in other places near Niles, at West Oakland, and also 
on Central avenue, in the town of Alameda. It is remarkable that 
such a fine fig has not been more widely distributed, though it has 
been in the State for forty years. This fig is now planted at Knights 
Ferry, Cal., where it produces very fine first-crop figs, which dr}^ well. 



70 THE fig: its history, culture, and curing. 

The second crop drops always, as might be expected, it having the 
same habit in Italy. 

The Adriatic fig, of which so much has been said and written, has 
probably been growing in California for nearly forty years, as some 
large trees at Big Oak Flat, in Calaveras County, were supposed to be 
of this variety. Certain it is that it has been scattered over the Sierra 
foothills for many years, though not known under any special name. 

The first importation of which the writer is fairly certain was made 
by W. B. West, of Stockton, Cal., who received this tree, together 
with 21 or 22 other varieties of figs, from an English nursery, by way 
of Panama, in 1865. He sold trees to several parties, among them 
Captain Gray, of Merced County, who planted them on his ranch at 
Atwater. 

Later another gentleman of Stockton, Dr. Sposati, is also said to have 
received the same tree from its native home on the east side of Italy, 
under the name of Fico di Fragola, and distributed it here under the 
translated name Strawberry fig. The late G. N. Milco, of Stockton, 
claimed to have been the first importer of this variety, which, how- 
ever, is an error. He found the trees growing on the ranch of Cap- 
tain Gray, the trees then being 10 years old, and, recognizing the value 
of the fig, named it the Adriatic, after his native home (Ragusa), where, 
however, the tree does not grow. His supply of cuttings, however, 
came from a tree planted by Mr. Andrew Simpson, in Stockton, who 
had bought the tree originally from West. 

Mr. Milco did much toward making the variety known, but also 
much toward keeping the growers in the dark as regards its true 
nature. Since 1884 the variety has been extensively cultivated in 
California and distributed to many of the Southern States, especially 
Florida. It is a fine variety in some localities, but in others worth- 
less. Even at its best it makes only a second-quality dried fig, though 
when fresh the figs are delicious when properly grown. 

importations .of figs by the united states department of 
\ ^ ' :.' agriculture. 

By far the most important importations of figs are those made at 

various times by the Unrfced States Department of Agriculture. Fig 

cuttings have been distributed by tRatT>epartraent almost yearly for 

the last twenty- five years or longer. In order to obtain for California 

a properly labeled collection of figs the Department of Agriculture, 

, under Secretary Rusk's administration (1889-1893), was requested to 

.^ import the whole collection of figs grown in the hothouses of JheRoyal 

^ Horticultural Society of London, the best kjriown^collection of figs in 

V the world. Professors Van Deman and Taylor, of the Department, 

favored the project, which, however, was only brought to a successful 

issue under the administration of Secretary Morton m^ebruary^894, 

and mainly through the good will and efforts of the assistant pomolo- 

gist. William A. Taylor.

uO' t ^2 THE fig: its history, culture, and curing. 

y^ ^ As seen from tlie above names and further reference to the cata- 

logue, nearly all these figs come from Italy, Spain ^ and Fran ce, and 
not a single one from Asia Minor. None, in fact, belongs to the race 
of figs which requires caprification to set fruit. This will explain why 
the European students of this collection of figs have failed to recog- 
nize the nature and necessity of caprification. This collection of figs, 
being the one used by Dr. Hogg in his well-known work on fruit cul- 
ture in England, will always remain a standard collection for identi- 
fication of varieties. 

importation of blastophaga. 

I The first importation of the live Blastophaga to California was made 
j in the spring of 1891. At that time the late Mr. James Shinn received 
: from a friend in Smyrna several small boxes with caprifigs contain- 
ing live Blastophaga. As Mr. Shinn possessed at his place at Niles 
the largest and oldest trees of the Bulletin importation of Smyrna figs, 
he had naturally taken interest in the fig question. Having as a friend 
a missionary in Smyrna, he had requested his assistance in procuring 
the insects. The latter were turned loose among his Smyrna fig trees, 
and the insects were seen to hatch and fly about. Later, in July of 
the same year, another shipment of Blastophaga was received by Mr. 
Shinn from the same gentleman. These were turned out among the 
fig trees at the end of July, during a visit to Niles of Mr. E. W. Mas- 
lin and the writer. None of these insects succeeded in taking hold. 
There were two reasons for this, as the writer pointed out at the 
time. One was that the only caprifig then growing on the spot pro- 
duced only a single crop a year. When the insects flew out there 
were no young caprifigs in which to lay eggs. The other reason was 
that the Blastophaga had hatched on the road and had, of course, 
been fertilized by the males at the time. As this had taken place 
some time previous, it was probable that the eggs had degenerated 
and become reabsorbed. All the males were dead upon the arrival 
of the figs, and even if they had been alive no new copulation could 
have taken place. During the following few years caprifigs contain- 
ing Blastophaga were received from Smyrna by Mr. George Roeding 
and Mr. Anthony C. Denotovitch, of Fresno, Cal., but the Blastophaga 
always failed to take hold, for the reasons stated above. All the cap- 
rifigs imported so far had been of the second crop, or mammoni. 
So far no mamme had been received. Previous to this, or in 1890, 
during the author's visit to Washington, D. C, both Dr. C. V. Riley 
and Dr. L. O. Howard had taken a lively interest in the caprifig 
question. When Dr. Howard later on became the head of the Division 
of Entomology, he decided to introduce the Blastophaga to California, 
and, if necessary, send some one to Smyrna to secure them. He was 
authorized by the Hon. James Wilson, Secretary of Agriculture, to 
make. the attempt, and in 1897 communicated with the author and 



FIG CULTURE IN CALIFORNIA. 73 

asked if he would undertake the journey. In the spring of 1896 Mr. 
Walter T. Swingle, then studying at the Zoological Station at Naples, 
became interested in the problems of caprification, which had been so 
much investigated in that region. In 1898, during a second stay at 
the Zoological Station, he made more extended studies, in which he 
had the benefit of the advice and help of Count Solms-Laubach and 
Dr. Paul Mayer, the recognized authorities on the subject. During 
March and April he secured and sent at his own expense the first ship- 
ment of mamme caprifigs, which were packed by a new method. 
This was the first time the mamme generation of caprifigs had been 
sent to America. They reached California in April in good condition, 
but although the insects came out by hundreds they failed to become 
established. Shortly afterwards Mr. Swingle was appointed an agri- 
cultural explorer in the newly established section of Seed and Plant 
Introduction. Since he was on the spot and was so well fitted for the 
work, it was considered unnecessary to send another investigator 
abroad, and Mr. Swingle was instructed to continue on behalf of the 
Department his efforts to introduce the fig insect and suitable varie- 
ties of the caprifig tree. 

Mr. Swingle studied the methods of fig culture and caprification in 
Algeria, Sicily, Naples, Greece, and Smyrna, and forwarded a num- 
ber of mamme caprifigs from Algiers in the spring of 1899. These 
caprifigs arrived in good condition and were sent by the Department 
of Agriculture to Mr. George Roeding, of Fresno, whose large and 
healthy fig orchard had been selected as the best for the purpose by 
Dr. Howard, after a personal examination in the spring of 1898. Mr. 
Roeding, by the way, had also repeatedly imported the Blastophaga, 
but all had failed to establish themselves in the caprifigs. As a 
result of the last Government introduction of Blastophagae to the 
Roeding orchard, it is most gratifying to know that at last the fig 
wasps have been properly established in California, both at Fresno 
and at Niles, and there is now every prospect that, with proper care 
and with proper distribution of caprifigs in frost-free localities, these 
insects will become so acclimated that no more introductions will be 
required. In order to study the intricate problem of the relationship 
of the Blastophaga and the caprifig. Dr. L. O. Howard, chief ento- 
mologist of the United States Department of Agriculture, directed 
Mr. E. A. Schwarz to proceed to California in the spring of 1900. 
As a result of the investigations of Dr. Howard and Mr. Schwarz, the 
former has contributed to the Yearbook of the United States Depart- 
ment of Agriculture for 1900 a most important account of caprification 
in California.* 

^The article has also been reprinted in separate form, and copies of the same 
may be obtained upon application. 




CHAPTER IV. 
CAPRIFICATION OF THE FIG.' 

Cappification of figs is a practical process based on scientific princir 
pies, which latter are as interesting and have been as badly misun- 
derstood as those connected with the practical part of the process. 
From ti me imm einorial caprification lias been practiced in certain 
countries, and practical results have been claimed for it. As regards 
the pr actical va lue of caprification, there are two distinct and oppo- 
site views held by different investigators. Some claim that caprifica- 
tion is necessary and valuable; others hold that i t is usele ss. As 
regards the^ scientific principles involved, there are also various views 
put forward, as will be explained further on, some of which are 
radically opposite to others. The chief reason why this question was 
not solved long ago has been twofold. First, many of the scientific 
investigators have not been practical horticulturists; while others 
have not been aware that they experimented on figs which really did 
hot require caprification, and which would not be benefited by it. 

Every investigator began and ended his researches with the errone- 
ous idea that all cultivated figs were alike, and he drew his conclusions 
accordingly. This alone explains the indifferent results achieved so 
far by European investigators. 

The many points involved in these interesting questions are both 
practical and scientific, and the two groups are so interwoven that the 
one can not possibly be understood without a full knowledge of the 
other. 

I am anxious that this maj^ be understood in. the beginning, as in 
the following pages practical details will be found hand in hand with 
scientific studies. The practical cultivator who knows but little of 
scientific phraseology would not understand the terms unavoidably 
used below, unless they were properly explained. Similarly, the sci- 
entific investigator, whose interest in this subject lies principally in 
the process of caprification and in its supposed value or uselessness, 
would not properly understand the practical details connected with 
the horticultural crops of the figs, unless they were explained in a way 
that may seem too elementary to the horticultural student or practical 
botanist. 

' A more extended treatise of this subject by the author was published in the 
Proceedings of the California Academy of Science in 189G. 
74 



CAPRIFICATION OF THE FIG. 75 

PRACTICAL CAPRIFICATION IN CALIFORNIA. 

The requisites for caprificatioii as now practiced in the S^ate of 
California are genuine Smyrna fig trees, two or three varieties of capri- 
fig trees, and colonies of Blastophaga grossorum or fig wasps, occu- 
pying the caprifigs. ^ 

There are two or three desirable varieties of genuine Smj^rna fig 
trees to plant, all of which can now be had in California. They are 
known in that State either as Bulletin Smyrnas or as Lobfigs, the 
former named on account of the corx>oration which made the first 
introduction of the cuttings, the second on account of the name used 
in Smyrna. In the catalogue several local names of the several 
varieties are found and which will in time be used. The trees are 
planted from 40 to 50 feet apart. As soon as the figs begin to bear 
they may be caprificated. The trees bear the first year, but not profit- 
ably for several years. It has been found from experiment that a 
fully developed caprifig of the best variety will and can contain on 
the average some 600 Blastophaga wasps. With this as a basis for 
calculation we find that under favorable circumstances it will require 
one caprifig tree for every 50 Smyrna trees. One tree for every 100 
Smyrna trees may suffice • in very favorable seasons, but the greater 
number is safer. The caprifig trees should not be set among the 
Smyrna trees for several reasons. The caprifigs require sheltered 
places and shade; the wasps require when hatching figs of proper size 
in which to lay their eggs; and finally it is necessary to evenly distrib- 
ute the Blastophagas when caprifying the trees, as otherwise some 
trees will get too many while others will get too few wasps. For these 
reasons the caprifig trees are set by themselves in sheltered places. 
It is best to have plantations of caprifig trees in places some dist^tnce 
from the fig orchard as well as near it. 

The chances of having caprifigs in the necessary stage of develop- 
ment are thus enhanced. It is also advisable to plant two, three, or 
more varieties of caprifig trees together in a grove, in order that figs 
of proper size may never be wanting from one end of the year to the 
other. The caprifig trees are set in the form of hedges about 10 by 
20 feet. The wasps prefer shade and cool places and such places 
must bo provided for. On this account the limbs of the caprifig 
trees should be allowed to grow low and shade the ground. The 
trees should be pi»uned only when necessary to cut away dead limbs. 
In order to introduce the necessary Blastophaga wasps it is only 
necessary to procure cai)rifigs containing colonies. These caprifigs 
are suspended in the growing caprifig trees at a time when they carry 
figs of proper size to receive the wasps. This is during the months of 
April to October, according to locality and crop. To start a colony 
of Blastophaga wasps in a caprifig tree reiiuires from one to five 
good caprifigs. The grower must examine his caprifig trees after the 



76 THE fig: its history, culture, and curing. 

winter frosts are over, in February or March, and ascertain if the 
Blastophagas in the mamme-figs have stood the winter. If the mamme 
have remained plump and heavy the crop of wasps can probably be 
depended upon to issue in due time. But if all the mamme of the 
eaprifigs have fallen during the winter, then it will be necessary to 
procure fresh mamme-figs from some other place and suspend them 
on the branches of the caprifig tree in a shaded place. The time 
for doing this will be, according to locality, during the latter half of 
March or beginning of April. The grower must be constantly exam- 
ining his caprifig trees to ascertain if his colonies of wasps are in good 
condition. If any of the caprifig crops fail, wasps should be imported 
anew. It may thus be necessary to caprificate the profichi, the mam- 
moni, and the mamme, as either of these crops may appear too late 
to be affected by the wasps. Hence the necessity of having caprifig 
trees of different varieties in various localities. 

The Smyrna fig trees are caprificated in the months of June and 
July, according to locality. When the Smyrna figs reach the size of a 
hazelnut or a large filbert they are generally in condition to be cap- 
rificated. If as large as a walnut they are probably too old for the 
wasps to take hold. When in proper condition eaprifigs are procured 
and strung on raphia or esparto grass, one or two figs at each end of 
a string. The number of eaprifigs necessary to caprificate a Smyrna 
fig tree depends upon two things — the age of the Smyrna fig tree, or 
rather upon the quantity of its figs, and upon the number of wasps in 
the caprifig. At present there are no Smyrna fig trees in California 
over 20 years old. For a tree of that age, and provided it is growing 
in good soil and has been well cared for, from 10 to 12 eaprifigs 
will suffice. If older, more eaprifigs will be necessary, and probably 
in any case 50 figs will suffice. This small number of eaprifigs 
required in this country compared to' what is necessary in Asia and 
Africa is due either to the fact that we have imported the Blasto- 
phaga wasps without their natural parasites, or to the lesser age and 
consequent yield of our trees. In Asia, Africa, and Europe the Blas- 
tophagas are decimated or even to a greater extent diminished in 
number by parasitical wasps also infesting the eaprifigs. When such 
is the case it is evident that more eaprifigs are necessary to caprifi- 
cate a certain tree. The crop used for caprification of . the Smyrna 
figs is the profichi cfop. This crop is the first crop of the caprifig — 
the one which appears on the old wood. The crop which the profichi 
caprificates is the second crop of the Smyrna fig — the crop which sets 
in the spring and matures the same summer. 

It is of the greatest importance that no more eaprifigs should be 
imported to the United States, as it is almost certain that they would 
introduce the natural enemies of the Blastophaga wasps. In caprify- 
ing the trees the eaprifigs are most conveniently strung on any soft 
and flexible grass. This is best done in the shade under the trees or 



CAPRIFIOATION OF THE FIG. 77 

under a temporary shed or tent. The strings are hung on horizon- 
tally supported rods of cane, and these rods are carried into the field 
by the eaprificator. In this way the figs do not become entangled. 
In selecting a place on which to hang the strings one that is shaded is 
preferable. A string is taken from the rod or cane and suspended on 
a branch of the Smyrna tree and given a twist so that it will not fall 
off. The process of caprifying the trees should be repeated several 
times, or as long as it is desirable to procure ripe Smyrna figs. During 
the first caprification one-half of the caprifigs necessary may be sus- 
pended. Ten days later the other half may be similarly suspended. 
Should more young Smyrna figs appear after a week or two it may be 
advisable to suspend a few more caprifigs in order that they too may 
, I be caprificated. 

SHORT SUMMARY OF CAPRIFICATION. 



^ \jy Caprification is a horticultural process which consists in suspend- 
^^'^^v^>^fig the profichi or first-crop figs of the caprifig on the branches of the 
,^j^y^ edible fig. The object of caprification is to produce seed in the edible 
.^^ figs and to cause these latter to set ana mature. Uniy such profichi ^-^^

\.\J^ as contain fig wasps {BlastopEaga grossorum) are of any value inW2^]3- 
1^ if ^caprification. Shortly after the profichi have been suspended t^^rrj^.^t 
t^^ female Blastophagas hatch out of their galls, and in their efforts to leave $J^^ ^< ^ 
. ^ \ )f^^ fig become covered with the ripe pollen of the caprifig. Once ^^^^^"^ 
^^^^.•o^utside of the caprifig the Blastophagas search for other caprifig s va^J<^^' 
V^ order to lay their eggs in them. But n ot finding any caprifigs, they 
enter the edible fi gs by m istake. The^ffect of this visit is the polli- 
na tion of t ne eclible-lig Howlers with the caprifig pollen brought along 
by the wasps. The pollination again causes the edible figs of a cer- 
u • tain clas s to m ature seed and to set its frui t. In order that pollination 
may be p rgpeTly'^iccomplish ed, it^ is necessary that the figs practiced 
on should h%ve female flowe rs in a proper state of development with 
receptive stigmas, and that the pollen of the caprifigs should be 
properly developed and in a good condition. Not all edible figs are 
. equally susceptible of caprification. The time for caprification is in 
June and July, according to locality. Caprification is nothing else 
-than an artificial pollination accomplished partly by man, who sus- 
pends the caprifigs, and partly by the wasps, which carry the pollen 
from the caprifig to the female flowers of the edible fig. 

The same process of pollination accomplished by the wasps on 
the edible figs is also necessary in the caprifigs in order that they 
may produce ripe and fertile seeds. No caprifigs will produce seed 
if the wasps are not present carrying the pollen from one crop to the 
other. Also in the case of the caprifigs man's aid is at times required. 
The Blastophaga wasps breed and hatch in the wild caprifigs, hence no 
human aid is required to bring these figs from one tree to the other, but 
all cultivated caprifigs are caprified in order to insure a crop of wasps. 



^Ni-^-JkJS THE fig: IT8 HISTORY, CULTURE, AND CUEING. 

V'/O^ w If the wasps could breed and live in the edible figs no caprification 
ji^ would be required. When through un favorable climatic con ditions 
^t^ ,.y the Blastophaga crop fails, when the early spring frosjs kill the young 
'^ >>r5^/^ wasps and their eggs and larvae, or in the case of some varieties of 
^^- cultivated capriflg trees,, man's aid is required. The grower must 

then supply caprifigs with live^ wasps from some distant part and trans- 
fer them both to tlie capriflg trees in order to start new broods and to 
the edible figs in order to caprificate them. This is done at times in 
Asia Minor, when often after heavy frosts whole shiploads of caprifigs 
are imported from Greece to supply the necessary wasps. Caprifigs 
suitable for caprification are regularly sold in all market places in the 
fig-growing countries around the Mediterranean. 

After this short summary of the process, caprification will be con- 
sidered more in detail. A horticultural and botanical study of the 
fig, its flowers and crops, is required in order to fully comprehend the 
necessity, importance, and nature of this interesting and complicated 
process. 

CROPS OF THE FIGS. 

General remarks. — The capriflg, as well as the edible fig, bears 
several distinct crops every year. So distinct are these crops and so 
important does the distinction between them appear to those nations 
which depend upon fig culture as -an article of food and commerce 
that the various crops have been given separate and characteristic 
names. 

In order to understand these names a detailed description of the 
various fig crops is necessary. We must bear in mind that while the 
fig and the caprifig crops in a general way resemble each other, they 
still disagree in some important points. This may also be said to be 
the case with the principal types of the edible fig. In a general way 
it may be stated that we have three distinct crops, each one appearing 
at a separate time — spring, summer, and fall — according to the season 
in the respective countries. But each one of these crops is character-, 
ized in a peculiar way, and without a full knowledge of them a perfect 
understanding of caprification is impossible. (PI. VIII.) 

The various crops of the fig. — While the edible-fig tree may pos- 
sess three distinct crops, we do not always find all these crops fol- 
lowing one another on the same tree. This may be and often is the 
case, but fig trees and fig varieties exist in which one or more crops 
are wanting. The first, second, or third crops may be respectively 
suppressed, or one of these crops may be present while the other two 
are suppressed. 

Shortly before the f\'^ tree begins to leaf out in the spring, small but- 
ton figs are seen pushing out from the wood of last year below the 
young lejvves of the* present season. The place where these figs 
develoji.is the place where during last season existed a leaf , which

CAPKIFICATION OF THE FIG. 79 

fell off last fall. These figs grow rapidly and mature generally in the 
end of May in all southern eountries or in June in more northern 
ones. This is the first crop of .figs, also known as early figs or bre- 
bas, first figs, or summer figs. This crop of figs has not yet matured, 
or, in some varieties, has hardly matui-ed, Vhen other young figs are 
seen to push out from the leaf joints of the present year. In the course 
of a month or two these figs ripen and constitute the second or main 
crop. With most figs this crop ripens in August, later or earlier, 
according to variety. This crop is also known, as second figs, autumn 
figs, or late figs. 
f A third or later crop is found in some varieties, forming in August 
I and ripening in winter. This may be called the, third crop,; but 
/ this third crop is not greatly distinct from the second crop. Both 
I develop f roiii the leaf joints of the same season. In reality, this third 
I crop of edible figs can only be considered as the last of the second 
crop. . The first crop is, however, entirely distinct from the seconti 
crop, as it is produced on the old wood. Sometimes the last figs of the 
third crop do not fall in the autumn, but winter over and ripen early 
in the next spring, just as the first crop, and are thus hardly distin- 
guishable from it. 

The crops of the caprifig. — In the caprifig the three crops corre- 
spond to those of the edible fig, but, as in that fig, they are not always 
all present in the same tree. Thus caprifig trees exist which develop 
only one crop„ while others possess two or three crops. The variation 
in crops may be confined to individual caprifigs of the same variety, 
or it may characterize some special variety, in which all the trees are 
exactly alike. The variation may also depend on^ihe seasons. 

At Niles, Cal., the crops of the caprifig succeed each other in the 
following manner : At the time of frost, in the fall, we find a. large 
number of figs as large as walnuts or hazelnuts situated at the very 
tips of the branches. These figs began to appear as small buttons 
in July (1900) and continued to increase until they became of size 
to be caprificated in September. This crop of eud-figs is known as 
the third crop (the mamme), and is really only the continuation of the 
second crop. But it differs from the second crop in its faculty to pass 
the winter unharmed on the trees. The following year in March, 
these third-crop figs, or mamme, become fully mature, and the wasp$; 
which escape from them enter the first crop (the profichi). r 

The first crop (the profichi) began t6 appear as small , buttons 
in December. They increased very slowly at first during the winter, 
but toward spring they became quickly larger, and in March they 
had reached the size in which they were caprificated. They then 
varied between the size of a pea and a hazelnut. In June and July,, 
according to locality and season, these first-crop figs are fully mature, 
and are then used for caprification. These first-crop figs (the profichi) 
were situated on the old wood — the wood of the previous year. In 

23740— No. 9—01 6 



80 THE fig: its history, culture, and curing. 

this they differed from the second, or mammoni, which mature on the 
wood of the same year. 

The second crop (the mammoni) began to set in June and became 
mature in August. It appeared as buttons on the green wood and 
matured while this wood was yet green. It was the only crop which 
did not pass the winter. The purpose of the second crop is to furnish 
wasps for the third crop (or mamme), which passes the winter on the 
trees, and to furnish seeds. 

To recapitulate, we find that the first crop (or profichi) passes the 
winter as very minute buttons on the old wood and matures the fol- 
lowing summer. The second crop (or mammoni) begins and matures 
the same season, and passes its entire existence during the sum- 
mer. The third crop (or the mamme) passes the winter as large figs 
(hence the name), fully developed or almost fully developed, and its figs 
are the first of the caprifigs to mature in the spring. The third and first 
crops are thus both found on the old wood. The second crop alone 
begins and matures on the green wood. 

A perfect caprifig tree must possess an overlapping of crops. If any 
crop should fail, it would be fatal to the wasps living in the figs, unless 
they had figs in other trees in which to breed. 

In the best Smyrna varieties the various crops of the caprifig are 
confined to distinct trees, which again have received distinct names. 
The trees which bear the winter crop, boghadhes, are known as '*orgi- 
nos boghadhes," while those trees which bear the spring crop, or ash- 
madhes, are known as '*orginos ashmadhes." 

The winter crop, or the orginos boghadhes, seldom contains any male 
flowers and pollen. This tree may, however, have an earlier crop 
which bears male flowers. 

The orginos ashmadhes, again, which produce the figs used for cap- 
rification, which crop is the first crop, or the ashmadhes, do, as a 
rule, never possess any other crop. It will therefore be seen that in 
order to possess a complete succession of crops of the caprifig we must 
either cultivate varieties which bear several crops on the same tree, or, 
if we grow the Smyrna * ' orginos," we must have both the boghadhes and 
the ashmadhes trees. The former breed the first crop of blastophagas ; 
the ashmadhes again breed the second crop of blastophagas from eggs 
laid by the wasps hatching from the boghadhes. 

As the boghadhes or winter crop and the ashmadnes or spring crop 
in Smyrna are often produced on different trees, it will be seen that either 
we must have both of these trees in the same orchard, or we must 
caprificate the trees bearing only one crop. The latter plan is adopted 
in Smyrna, where only orginos ashmadhes are cultivated. The reason 
of this is that comparatively few boghadhes or mamme are required 
for the caprification of the ashmadhes or profichi, while an enormous 
quantity of ashmadhes is necessary for the caprification of the edible 
figs. It is easier to bring in the few boghadhes required from the 



CAPRIFICATION OF THE FIG. 



81 



hills than to cultivate them. Besides, the trees bearing the boghadhes 
generally grow in frost-free places in the hills, the frost in the orchards 
being apt to kill both the figs and the wasps. 

Names of the crops, — In order to avoid misunderstandings, the 
various crops are given distinct names in all foreign countries where 
fig culture is prominent. The crops of the caprifig, which not always 
correspond with the crops of the edible figs, are named differently. 
The following table will give a clearer idea of these names. As the 
English language has no suitable names for the various crops of the 
caprifig and the fig, I propose that we, for the eai*ly first crop of edible 
figs, adopt the Spanish name *'brebas," and that we simply call the 
second crop of edible figs ''figs," or autumn figs. For the caprifig I 
believe we can do no better than adopt the nomenclature of the German 
specialists who now use the Neapolitan names profichi, mammoni, 
and mamme. Br. L. O. Howard^ questions the existence of three dis- 
tinct crops of figs. This question is not yet settled, and while it may 
prove botanically correct to refer to the crops as only two — figs which 
attain their full size on the old wood, and figs which attain their full 
size in the axillaries of the leaves — still it certainly is horticulturally 
convenient to speak of the fig crops as if they were three distinct 
ones, even if the three crops are not always found on the same tree.

82 THE fig: its history, culture, and curing. 

^ N^^ Characteristics of the various crops of the caprifig. — In the foivgo- 

'7 ' ing it has already been pointed out that the various crops of the 

• i ^ caprifig differ from one another in several respects. Here it is only 

'y*^ c*' ^^^^^s^^y ^^ generalize. The profichi form in autumn, remain on 

v/ s"^ the trees over winter, and come to maturity in June and July. This 

A v.;"V crop contains many male flowers and gall flowers, but no true female 

\^w flowers, as seeds have never been found in this crop. The time of 

V maturity is June and July. 

\y^^ The mammoni appear in June or earlier, and mature in July and 
/ ^ r^August, according to climatic conditions. Thej^ contain both male 
^\^ >^ flowers and female flowers, and a large number of gall flowers. The 
i^vptjCjnamme or wintering figs produce male flowers and numerous gall 
^ y^ ^^^flowers, but no female flowers. The female flowers are thus found 
^^^^^^^^>^only in the mammoni. 

V^ V^ The various crops of the caprifig do not always succeed each other 
^^^"V^ continuously. There is frequently a lapse of time between the falling 
\f V- Vy^f the profichi and the appearance of the mammoni/ No account has 
p y^ here been taken of the female caprifig tree, as yet almost unknown. 

Characteristics of the crops of the edible jig. — As to the edible figs 
the different crops are different in size, quality, fiavor, sweetness, and 
s^ \j. sometimes in color. The first crop, the fiori, figues-fleurs, figos lam- 
pas, brebas, etc., are ja rge fi gs, n ot very sw eet, bu t pulpy a nd lus- 
sT^ \^j"^ d^io^^sfor eating fresh, and they are highly prized on that account. 
. ^ V ^^ The different names given to these large figs indicate the value in 
vV-*p^v which they are held. The differgaccLia cpnsidered so important that, 
^t\^ for instance, in Spain and Mexico the common people will insist that 
S'*'*>^ the *' brebas" are not figs. In California, however, no great distinc- 
^ tion is made air to the three crops. When fig culture becomes as 
'^^ -^ important here as it now is in Europe and Asia, names may be 
required for the first crop of edible figs. We have already proposed 
for the first crop the name ''brebas," now used in all Spanish-speak- 
ing countries, breba meaning early. 

A large number of figs do not produce any first crop or. brebas, 
some give very few, and others again, like the San Pedro, produce 
only brebas, the second crop only maturing any figs when it is 
caprificated. 

The second crop, known in France as "figues-ordinaires," in Spain 
as ''Jiigos," in Portugal as "vendimos," an3~ln liinglish-speaking 
countries oiily as **figs^ " need hereTTcr special reference. It is this 
crop alone which is used for drying in Smyrna or in other foreign 
fig-growing countries, as well as in Calffoi*nia. These figs are sweet 
or very sweet, and, compared with the brebas, mueh^smaller in 
size. In Italy a difference is made as to the first or lowest figs of the 
second crop, which are called pedagnuoli or low figs, while the later 
or upper figs on the same branches are considered less valuable and 
are known as cimaruoli or top figs. In the edible figs the third crop 



^^'s:-' 



^ ^l^y ^ CAPKIFICATION OF THE FIG. 83 

can not be said to exist as a separate crop, as the last figs are only 
a continuation of the second crop. The fig tree often continues to 
^ bear until frost sets in, or until the tree becomes otherwise dormant. 
^^ Some fig varieties, like the Natalino, ripen their last figs in midwinter, ^^^^yy ' 
V^tN\if properly protected. ^^tjP^^^ 

^ ^^ If we compare the crops of the caprifig tree with those of the edible ^^^^j^^,^^^^,,^^ 
vJ' fig, we find that the first crop or profichi of the caprifigs correspond yY^^vrvv^ 

to the brebas of the edible figs, the mammoni of the caprifigs corre- 
spond to the second crop of the edible figs, and the mamme of the 
caprifigs to the winter figs of some of the edible kinds. The difference 
is, however, that while the mamme come to maturity, the following 
spring, the third crop or autumn figs mature, if at all, the same year. 
The mamme correspond thus to the Italian cimaruoli or end figs, the 
location of the figs being characteristic both in the caprifig and in 
the edible fig. The mamme are so named on account of their large 
size and swollen form — resembling mammaB or breasts. 

POLLINATION. 

Pollination is the process in which the pollen produced by the 
anthers is placed on the stigma of the flowers. This process of 
fecundation or pollination is necessary in order that the ovarj^ may 
be fertilized and produce seed. The pollen grains, when ripe, appear 
to the unaided eye as a fine dust, but under the microscope each 
grain maj' be seen to be beautifully and characteristically sculp- 
tured. These pollen grains are brought onto the stigma either b}'^ 
wind, transmitted by insects, or fall bj^ gravity. As soon as the 
pollen grains are on the surface of the stigma — provided the lat- 
ter is in proper receptive conditio n, neither too-old nor too young — 
they begin at once to grow, sending out one or more pollen tubes, 
like long roots, which penetrate through the style and, following 
its canal, finally through the funnel-shaped opening in the ovule, 
reaching the inner nucellus. The fertilization has then taken place, 
and immediately afterwards changes take place in the ovule and 
nucellus, which in short time lead to the production of a fertile seed. 
As a rule we find that in the same flower the pollen grains and the 
stigma are not fully developed at one and the same time. It is there- 
fore evident that the pollen in a flower can not be useful for fertilizing 
the ovary in the same flower. This is nature's remedy against self- 
fertilization, requiring that the pollen be brought from some other 
flower or from some other tree of the same kind. In the majority of 
flowers the pollen can be transported from one flower to another only 
by means of insects, and often the flowers are so peculiarly constructed 
that only a certain kind of insect can reach the pollen, or, rather, can 
reach the honey glands at the base of the anthers, as without the 
presence of these glands the insects w^ould have no occasion to visit 
the flowers, which in such a case would remain sterile. 



84 THE fig: its history, culture, and curing. 

Nearly every flower we see in the field, and certainly every bright- 
colored flower, requires the visit of some insect in order that its stigma 
may be fertilized by the pollen which adhered to the insect when it 
left the last flower visited. Thus the insects and the flowers stand in 
close intimacy. The honey glands of the flowers furnish food for the 
insects, which are attracted to the flowers by their size, color, or scent, 
or by the odor of the honey. The insects pay for their visit and for 
their meal by unknowingly carrying the pollen from one flower to 
another — the insects are fed, the flowers pollinated. Only in very few 
instances do the insects live and breed in the flowers. One such 
instance is the fig, in which the Blastophaga wasp breeds and passes 
nearly its whole life. Caprification is therefore nothing but a similar 
pollination — one which, as regards the edible fig, is accomplished not 
only by the aid of insects, but also by the help of man. 

Among other plants which require help in pollination in order to 
bear fruit or berries are certain varieties of strawberries, which pos- 
sess only pistillate flowers. Such varieties will bear only when there 
are other kinds present to supply the pollen. In order to accomplish 
this pollination the horticulturist plants bisexual varieties alter- 
nately among rows of the pistillate ones. The wind and insects then 
carry the pollen from one variety to another, and pollination is accom- 
plished. The flowers of the strawberry are open, and any insect almost 
can effect the necessary transmission of pollen. If the strawberry 
flowers had been Jiidden in a receptacle it would probably have been 
necessary for the horticulturist to breed and supply the proper 
insect. In caprification man furnishes these insects, the work con- 
sisting in bringing them from the wild figs to the cultivated ones. 
Another well-known, process of pollination by the aid of man is the 
one practiced by the growers of the date palm. There are male trees 
and female trees of the date. The former produce only pollen-bearing 
flowers; the latter carry only seed or pistillate flowers. The process 
of pollination of the date palm consists in bringing small bunches 
of ripe pollen-bearing flowers to the top of the seed-bearing trees 
and shaking the pollen over the bunches. The staminate flowers 
are thus fertilized and the production of an abundant crop is assured. 
If this process is not undertaken by the grower, only a small crop 
would result, as insects and wind would fertilize only by chance and 
only a few flowers would bring fruit. In caprification of the fig ma^ 
can not shake out the pollen on the flowers of the hg, because they 
are covered up. He can only suspend the pollen-bearing figs in the 
trees and let the Blastophaga wasps do the work of carrying the pol- 
len through the eye of the fig to the female, or pistillate, figs. In 
caprification, therefore, we need not only pollen-bearing figs, but we 
require also an immense quantity of wasps to do the work of carrying 
the poUeu. This complicates the process considerably, but in reality

tance and nature of pollination, and we could multiply instances of 
its practical necessity in horticulture. 

POLLENIFEROUS AND INSECTIFEROUS CAPRIFIGS OR POLLEN-BEARING 
AND INSECT-BEARING FIGS. 

We have already stated that caprifigs require the presence of the 
Blastophaga wasps in order to produce seeds, but in order to pro- 
duce ripe pollen-bearing figs it seems that the wasps are not neces- 
sary. A caprifig tree which is only partially caprificated possesses two 
distinct kinds of figs, which differ both in size and form. Mr. E. A. 
Schwarz, of the Division of Entomology of the Department of Agricul- 
ture, at Washington, who studied this question at Fresno during the 
summer of 1900, has named these respective figs, according to their 
nature, poUeniferous and insectiferous — names which, as being emi- 
nently suitable, will probably be generally adopted. Before caprifi- 
cation has taken place — that is, before the new crop of wasps has 
entered the small caprifigs — these two kinds of figs are of the same 
size and form, generally the size of a large pea. But after the wasps 
have entered certain of the figs a difference begins to appear between 
those figs which have received the wasps and those which have not 
been entered. This difference extends not only to the figs, but to the 
branches bearing them. Thus all branches which bear caprificated 
figs start to grow more vigorously than those which do not possess 
caprificated figs. The latter remain puny, and even their leaves are 
smaller than those of the caprificated branches. (PL X.) A single 
caprificated or insectiferous fig will give character to the whole branch 
on which it grows. The poUeniferous figs remain smaller and more 
oblong, and soon assume a yellow color. They become soft and ap- 
pear partly mature, and soon fall off at various stages of growth, not 
remaining on the tree as long as the insectiferous figs. When cut 
open, it is found that the central fioriferous cavity is comparatively 
small, but contains a large number of pollen-bearing flowers, which 
may or may not attain maturity. The meat is generally white or 
yellowish, and no violet-colored zone surrounds the flowers. The meat 
itself is soft and spongy, slightly moist, but rarely juicy. The gall 
flowers are shrunken and diminutive. 

The twigs bearing insectiferous figs are longer, thicker, and in 
every way stronger. (Pis. X, XI, XII.) Each twig may contain 
both insectiferous and poUeniferous flowers, a single one of the latter 
being sufiRcient to impart an unusual vigor to the twig. This vigor 
extends even to the leaves. The insectiferous fig is thicker, harder, 
and of a deep green. It is also more round and turbinate and sticks 
strongly to the twig. It has to be cut away and does not fall at the 
touch as the poUeniferous figs do. The exterior is coarser and the

ribs strongly marked. If such insectiferous fig is cut through it is 
found that its meat is hard and peculiarly ^lid and possessed of a 
more or less thick but always distinctly violet-colored zone immedi- 
ately surrounding the flowers. The flower core is much larger than 
in the jwUeniferous figs. The male flowers are strongly developed and 
so is the zone bearing the gall flowers, several hundreds of which may 
contain Blastophagse in some stage of development. The inhabited 
gall flowers are readily recognized by their plumpness and size, and 
when in an advanced stage of development the dark shade indicates 
that the wasp is near its final size and may be expected soon to issue 
from its confinement. 

This distinction between the insectiferous and the poUeniferous 
caprifigs is of great practical importance to the horticulturist, as it 
enables him to readily recognize the one kind from the other. It is 
only the insectiferous caprifigs which are used in caprification. The 
poUeniferous figs which do not contain BlastophagaB are useless in 
caprification, and should accordingly not be suspended in the Smyrna 
fig trees. 

The above descriptions and notes were made from caprifigs grown 
by Mr. John Rock at Nlles, Cal. 

THE FIG AND THE CAPRIFIG. 

It is now generally conceded that the edible fig is in some way 
descended from the caprifig.^ The capriflg is the wild fig of the 
Mediterranean region, though its original home must be searched 
for in the mountain regions of southern Arabia. From its original 
habitat the caprifig tree was spread by cultivation, or at least by trans- 
plantation to other districts, and finding suitable conditions, soon 
established itself as a wild tree in the forests and mountains of the 
respective countries suitable to multiplication through seedlings. It 
is now generally known to botanists that the caprifig carries figs which 
contain three distinct kinds of flowers — male, female, and gall flowers — 
all in- the same fruit, as will be described later on. But, besides, it is also 
known^ that there exists also a caprifig tree which bears mammoni 
which possess only pistillate and gall flowers, though trees of this kind 
are comparatively very rare. Cuttings taken from either one of these 

' Both varieties are known as Fitms carica Linnaens, and belong to the same 
botanical species. 

^ Pontedera, p. 175. This female tree he calls Erinosyce. Qallesio also men- 
tions snch tree under the name of Fico semi-mula, bnt it is uncertain if he himself 
has seen it. A somewhat similar form of the caprifig is described by Solms- 
Laubach, p. 35, as having grown wild in a garden at Chiaja; near Naples. As all, 
or at least nearly all, other fig species which have been particularly described pos- 
sess such an exclusively female form, it is more than likely that Pontedera*s 
description is correct. Miiller and Solms-Laubach assume that the edible fig is the 
female tree and the caprifig the male tree, which 1 can only understand to mean 
that the edible fig is descended from the female tree. 



CAPRIFICATION OF THE FIG. 87 

trees would produce only its kind, though seedlings might produce 
both kinds, but probably the majority of the offspring would be like 
the pjarent.tree. 

Through cultivation and selection by man numerous types of the 
caprifig tree have been originated, though they are not at present 
well understood or described. The Italian botanist Pontedera, and 
after him Gallesio, were the first to mention this fact, and although 
other botanists have neglected to verify and through observations 
enlarge upon Pontedera's and Gallesio's reports, we have no good 
reason to doubt that their ideas were in the main correct. Gallesio 
describes^ the purely female tree of the caprifig as '^Fico semi-mida.^^ 
In general he recognizes among the caprifig the following types : 

Fico selvdggio, or common wild caprifig, with two or three crops a 
year. 

Fico delta natura, the original wild caprifig, with only one crop a 
year, this crop developing during the summer and ripening in the 
fall.2 

Fico mostro^ all caprifigs which bear no fruit or which drop all their 
figs while they are yet young; also trees in which only the male 
flowers arrive at development. 

Fico rauUiy with female flowers, which do not develop fertile seed, 
and which, as he expresses himself, become pomologically but not 
botanically ripe. 

Fico semi-mula, with no male and with only female flowers, which, 
when pollinated, become botanically ripe, and consequently also 
I)omologically ripe. This fig is undoubtedly the female tree of the 
caprifig. From the descriptions of the other kind we may at least 
conclude that there exist numerous races or variations among the 
caprifigs. 

At present we possess in California about a dozen varieties of capri- 
figs, differing from one another very much in the ^ame way as do the 
varieties described above, as well as in other minor points, such as 
variations in leaves, size and color of fruit, time of maturity, number 
of crops, etc. Several of these varieties are necessary in every fig 
orchard where caprification must be practiced. The importance of 
growing several different varieties of caprifigs in one orchard can not 
be overestimated, as it will certainly be found that one variety which 
will be suitable in one place will be a failure in another; besides, some 
varieties bear only one or two crops of figs, while three crops are nec- 
essary. Home-raised seedlings should therefore be resorted to, as they 
are likely to produce varieties suitable to the locality where they are

to be grown. The principal feature of a good caprifig orchard is 
that there should always be figs of a proper size to receive the wasps 
whenever they hatch out. If such figs are wanting the wasps will 
die, as they can not live for any length of time outside of the fig. There 
must be a crop of caprifigs for every crop of Blastophaga wasps. The 
female wasps are fertilized before they leave their galls in the figs, 
and are immediately ready to lay their eggs in young caprifigs. The 
failures experienced in California in establishing Blastophaga colonies 
on the caprifig trees growing there were partly due to lack of figs of 
proper size. The wasps were brought over from Asia Minor without 
any difliculty, but upon their arrival the caprifigs possessed only large 
figs, none of the size suitable for the wasps to breed in. The fact that 
some caprifigs do not produce any fertile seeds, although they have 
both perfect male and female flowers, results from the fact that, as in 
the edible fig the male flowers shed their pollen first long after the 
female flowers have passed their state of receptivity. Such caprifigs 
must be caprificated, just as edible figs, in order to produce seeds. 

THE FIG. 

The fruit which we call a fig is really not one single fruit, but a large 
number of fruits (or flowers) placed on a common receptacle. The 
flg itself is this receptacle, and in its interior are seen the small fruits 
or the flowers if the ^g is unripe. 

If we cut open a fig lengthwise we see first, exteriorly, a fleshy, 
homogeneous mass, the receptacle proper, inclosing a central hollow, 
which connects with the outside through a narrow passage at the eye. 
Lining this central hollow on the inner surface of the receptacle are 
seen an almost innumerable quantity of small, apparently similar 
flowers, which are fleshy, of even size, and a little deformed, and 
which apparently onl}^ slightly resemble flowers with which we are 
generally, acquainted. These are, however, the true flowers of the 
fig. They fill the whole interior surface of the receptacle, except close 
to and at the "eye," where they are replaced by scales or small leaf- 
lets, which latter interlock and form a thatched obstruction in the 
throat of the fig. This is generally the appearance of the fruit of the 
common or edible fig tree. 

The wild fig or caprifig is somewhat differently constructed, a dif- 
ference, however, which is of the utmost importance and interest. 

In the caprifig we find, besides the scales at the eye and in the 
throat, not less than three different and distinct flowers covering the 
interior of the receptacle — male, female, and gall flowers. The male 
flowers occupy the place nearest below the scales of the throat, while 
the lower parts of the receptacle are fllled with gall flowers and a few- 
female flowers. The proportion of tliese flowers is different in the 
different crops of the flgs. The hibernating ''mamme" or third crop 
possesses male flowers and many gall flowers, but no female flowers. 



CAPRIFTCATION OF THE FIG. 



89 



The first crop or *'profichi" has both male flowers and gall flowers, 
but no female flowers. The second crop or the * ' mammoni " alone 
possesses both female flowers and gall flowers. There are, however, 
exceptions to this rule, but this proportion is the most common one and 
is generally constant. There is also a purely female plant of the wild 
caprifig which possesses mammoni with only female flowers, but this 
plant is as yet almost unknown. It has already been mentioned that 
this form was flrst described by Pontedera.^ The different crops of 
the flg will be more minutely described presently. 

If we consider the flg pomologicall}^ it will be seen that, as it is 
principally the receptacle that is eaten, the various flowers found in 
the fig often detract from the value of the ^^, as they are never as 
juicy as the receptacle part. Especially is this the case with the male 
flowers, which are never edible; and whenever they occur they must 
be cut awa}^ before eating. 



THE MALE FLOWERS. 



The male or staminate flowers of the caprifig are, as just stated, 
situated immediately below the throat of the fig, variously occupying 
from one-half to two-thirds of the space in the receptacle. (See fig. 9.)

The flowei^s, though small and sometimes somewhat irregular, are 
still perfect. They possess four petals, generally shorter than the 
anthers, and shorter than those of the female flowers. Inside these 
petals are seen four stamens carrying larger pollen-producing or 
pollen-bearing anthers. 

In the first crop these stamens attain their full development in 
the months of June or July, according to locality, or about two months 
after the time that the female flowers have reached their perfection 
in the same fig/ It is evident, therefore, that in usual cases the pollen

from the anthers can not fertilize or pollinate the female flowers in 
the same fig. Their function is to pollinate the female flowers of the 
succeeding crop. Thus the pollen from the first crop or "profichi" 
pollinates the '' mammoni" or second crop, the female flowei^s of which 
are in their prime and receptive at a time when the pollen of the 
profichi is ripe. The pollen in the profichi is very abundant, of a 
pale yellow color, resembling a flowery yellow powder, which may 
easily be taken out and collected without injury to its vital qualities. 

The above refers only to the caprifig, or, if we wish to be more dis- 
tinct, to the male tree of the caprifig. The edible fig, as cultivated 
in our orchards, does not x>ossess any male flowers,^ except in extremely 
rare cases, as will be mentioned- below. (See fig. 10.) 

The anthers in the male flowers are not always properly developed. 
This is especially the case in seedlings raised from Smyrna ^g seeds, 
which originated from a pollination with the caprifig. Such seedlings 
do not all possess male flowers; those that do are more or less similar

to the caprifig flowers, the anthers frequently being as well developed 
as in the real wild ^g,^ 

FEMALE FLOWERS. 

In the caprifig, female flowers have been found with certainty only 
in the second crop or mammon i. In this crop alone have fertile seeds 
been found, but always in very small quantities, hardly more than 
one fertile seed in every fig.^ In the edible figs perfect female flowers 
capable of producing developed embryos are more common. Gen- 
erally it has been supposed that all flowers found in the edible figs 

* As will be seen ia a different place, so far only a very few exceptions have been 
noted, among them the Cordelia fig in Solano County. Cal., and the Croisic fig, 
growing at the mouth of the Loire River in France. See Solms-Laubach, i, p. 14. 

^French authors general y describe the caprifig male flowers as having only 
three petals, which is an error, undoubtedly originated by describing the figure in 
**De Breuil," where the figure of the male flower is erroneously drawn.

were female flowers capable of producing fertile seeds. But this is 
undoubtedly not the case. 
All flowers of the edible figs 
in a general way resemble the 
female flowers, but, as will 
shortly be demonstrated, they 
are not all alike, but differ in 
the various crops and in dif- 
ferent varieties. (See figs. 11, 
12.) 

In the second crop of the 
genuine Smyrna figs nearly 
all flowers are perfectly de- 
veloped female flowers, which 
only require pollination in 
order to bring fertile seed. 
This appears also to be the 
case in San Pedro and other 
figs, which regularly drop their second-crop figs. As far as micro- 
scopical structure is concerned their flowers are entirely similar to 
those in the genuine Smyrna figs. That- com- 
mon edible figs possess at least some female 
flowers is clearly demonstrated by the finding 
of fertile seed in many such figs in localities 
where caprifigs are grown spontaneously. But 
the small quantity of seeds found in common 
figs indicates that the quantity of perfect female 
flowers is small. 

In places where caprifigs are not growing 
wild — that is, where they are not growing spon- 
taneously from seed, it is very difficult to decide 
whether a flower is a true female flower or not, 
and the only practical way to ascertain it is to 
pollinate it and await the results of fertilization. 
A wild caprifig always indicates that pollination 
is taking place through the agency of wasps, as 
even the caprifig will not propagate itself spon- 
taneously from seed and become wild without 
their agency, as the pollen can not be transferred 
by the wind either to the female flowers of the 
caprifig or the edible fig. 

As regards the structure of the female flowers, 
some slight variation is noticeable. The petals 
are generally four in number, but sometimes 
three or five. According to Solms-Laubach, the number is quite vari- 
able within the above limits, but, according to my own observations.

four is the most constant number. In size the petals vary somewhat, 
one pair often being a little longer than the other, and all four are 
always longer than the petals of the male flowers. All are more or 
less fleshy, and sometimes they are furnished with short hairs at the 
margin. In the center, between these petals, projects a single pistil, 
enlarged at the base, forming the ovary. The central part is elon- 
gated two or three times more than the ovary. This part is the 
style. The upper part of the style is bent and funnel-shaped, often, 
or perhaps generally, divided, one projection of the stigma being 
longer than the other. With a high-magnifying lens the margin and 
upper surface of the stigma are seen to consist of a layer of minute 
glands, of a warty appearance, while from the centner of the stigmatic 
funnel there extends downward a narrow canal or lumen, which passes 
through the whole length of the style and down through one side of 
the ovary, here bending upward and touching the very embryo. 
When the female flowers are receptive — that is, when they are in con- 
dition to receive the pollen from the male flowers — these glands become 
greatly swollen and somewhat glossy, of a green or light-green color, 
which, after the receptive stage is passed, changes to a bright brown. 
The inner surface of figs in such a stage is seen to be spotted brown 
when cut open. The stigma attains its receptivity long before the 
male flowers are ripe in the same flg receptacle. This difference in 
the maturity of the flowers makes it impossible for the female flowers 
to be fertilized or pollinated by the male flowers of the same fig. 
Thus the female flowers of the mammoni can be pollinated only by 
the male flowers of the preceding crop — the profichi. 

The crops of the edible figs correspond in a general way with those 
of the caprifig. Thus when the male flowers of the profichi are ripe, 
and at a time when the other flowers in this fig had passed their 
prime months before, the female flowers of the second-crop Smyrna 
figs have just attained the state of receptivity. They can therefore 
be pollinated by the male flowers of the profichi of the caprifigs. The 
time for this pollination is June or July, according to climatic condi- 
tions, in various countries. This rule as to the difference in time of 
ripening of the male and female flowers in the capriflg holds also 
good in the few instances where male flowers have been found in the 
edible figs. Hence the impossibility of the female flowers in our 
edible fig being fertilized by the pollen of the male flowers immedi- 
ately above them. It is only the female flowers of the following crop 
that could thus be impregnated by the pollen. Female flowers occur 
in large numbers in the Smyrna varieties and in the first crop of such 
figs as the Adriatic, which do not mature this crop without caprification. 

THE GALL FLOWERS. 

The gall flowers, which occur in abundance in all caprifigs of all 
crops, are in reality nothing else than female flowers which have been 
transformed in order to accommodate the requirements of a small 



CAPRIFICATION OF THE FIG. 93 

wasp — the Blastophaga grossorum. These gall flowers do not produce 
seed, though in general aspect they resemble the female flower. 

The petals in the gall flowers are smaller and more unequal in size. 
The chief difference, however, between these flowers and the female 
flowers is found partly in the style of the pistil, which is not so elon- 
gated as in the female flowers, and partly in the stigma, which is very 
much smaller and entirely wanting the glands on its upper surface. 
The gall flowers can not be pollinated, or, if they are, the pollen does 
not develop pollen tubes, nor does the embryo or egg in the lower 
parts or ovary become fertile. A comparison of the figures of the gall 
flowers and female flowers will show the points of difference and 
resemblance. (See figs. 13 and 15.) 

While it is true that the gall flowers do not produce seed, it is a 
fact that they develop to a certain extent if punctured by the wasp, or, 
more correctly, if the egg of the Blastophaga wasp has been properly 
deposited. They then develop into galls — that is, the lower part of 
the stigma swells up and the 
integuments of the embryo 
sac harden, forming a glossy 
and brittle covering as a pro- 
tection for the larv8B of the 
wasp. 

Those gall flowers which 
are not thus wounded by the 
Blastophaga egg do not de- 

'velop any further, but at once fig. 13.-SeedUng from seed of imported Smyrna

fig species, though in some 

species their nature is not apparent until the egg of the Blastop*iaga iias 
been laid. In the edible fig no gall flowers have been found with cer- 
tainty; at least the Blastophaga wasp, for whose special benefit these 
gall flowers seem to have originated, has never been found breeding in 
the edible figs. It has been supposed that the cause of this was to be 
found in the sugary juices of the edible fig, which killed the eggs or 
embryo of the wasps, but I am satisfied that this is not exactly true. 
Many varieties of wild-fig species produce very sweet fruits, edible 
and quite palatable, and still these figs serve as homes for Blastopha- 
gas. The cause of the inability of the wasp to breed in common figs 
must be sought for elsewhere, and, as I will presently point out, is 
due to the fact that the edible figs contain only fiowers modified to such 
an extent that they are unsuitable as breeding places for the wasps. 

The gall fiowers are characterized by a much shorter style, by an 
undeveloped stigma devoid of receptive glands, and by an imperfect 
embryo which never develops to more than a certain limited degree. 
The discovery of the distinction between gall fiowers and female 
flowers is due to Solms-Laubach..

Until his researches were made known it was supposed that the 
female flowers turned into galls when stnng by the wasps. He 

again proved that the 
distinction existed inde- 
pendent of the wasi)8, 
which, however, select 
the peculiar gall flow- 
ers as the onlj^ . ones 
suitable to receive their 
eggs. 

MULE FLOWKRS. 

Under this name I ar- 
range the majority of 
the flowers of that class 
of edible-fig varieties 
which mature their figs 
regularly without the presence of the caprifig and its pollen. These 
flowers are, as far as I know, not 
found in the caprifig, nor in any 
other wild-fig species. They are un- 
doubtedly a product of culture and 
must be considered either as modi- 
fied gall flowers (figs. 14, 15), which, 
bereft of the Blastophaga influence, 
have partially regained their original 
structure, but which, just on that 
account, have lost the capability of 
producing galls; or they may be con- 
sidered as degenerated female flowers 
which have lost their fecundity by 
inertion — in other words, by not be- 
ing pollinated for age^, so to say — 
in the same way that many culti- 
vated flowers have degenerated. I 
am inclined to consider the latter as 
the more probable, though at pres- 
ent no direct proof can be given. 
That the great majority of the flow- 
ers in our edible figs (except the 
Smyrna race) are diiferent from the 
true female fiowers, both in struc- 
ture and nature, is undoubted, 

whether we assign as a cause one or the other of the above theo- 
ries. These mule flowers never reach any botanical maturity, and

are really something halfwaj'^ between the true female flower and the 
true gall flower. 

The mule flowers are characterized by an imperfect stigma, by a 
style in length intermediate between that of the gall flower and the 
female flower, by an imperfect embryo, and by the propertj'' of becom- 
ing fleshy, sweet, and edible without pollination. I have so far not 
found any in the Smyrna figs, comparatively few in the second crop 
of the San Pedro class, but almost exclusively occurring in the first 
crop of this class. The stigma of the mule flowers has no developed 
glands on its upper surface and is not receptive. 

MALE FLOWERS IN EDIBLE FIGS. 

It has f requentlj^ been stated that male flowers are not found in 
edible figs, and this must be considered as a rule. However, there 
are some exceptions to this rule, and as they are of great intei*est, if 
not to the grower at least to the student, it may be proper to mention 
the subject somewhat more in detail. 

The male flower of the fig was for a long time un Known to botanists, 
and, strangely enough, it was first described from specimens found in 
the edible fig. The male flower of the fig was first described by the 
prominent botanist La Hire, in the year 1714, from figs grown in Paris 
either under glass or in the open ground.* Unfortunately, La Hire 
does not give particulars as to the variety from which the flowers 
were taken, and it is not even certain that La Hire got his flowers 
from the edible fig. Another variety of edible fig which regularly 
produces seed is the " Croisic," cultivated in the vicinity of the ocean 
bathing place Croisic, on the coast of Brittany, in the department of 
Loire Inferieure. This fig has been mentioned by Solms-Laubach,^ 
and described as being green wlien ripe, with white or pale pulp, very* 
juicy and sweet, but with poor aroma. The male flowers occupy the 
same place and distribution as in the profichi of the caprifig. The 
place they occupy on the receptacle ripens less perfectly than the 
balance of the fig, and remains always somewhat hard and dry, gen- 
erally to such an extent that it becomes necessary to remove that part 
of the fig before eating. 

' Another somewhat similar edible fig was observed by the same 
author as cultivated at Cherbourg, in France; also on the Atlantic 
coast. The male flowers in this fig were, however, degenerated or 
improperly developed. The finder of these figs believes them to be 
only highly developed caprifigs which have become edible. He is 
even tempted to trace their introduction to France to the time when 

* La Hire, p. 287. Bnt Colin Milne was the first one to point out that the 
cultivated figs contained no male flowers— only what he supposed to be female 
flowers. (1770.) See Milne's dictionary, article **Caprification.'

the Phoenician traders extended their ocean voyages to the northern 
coast of France — a time when supposedly the common edible figs were 
yet in a semiwild or undeveloped condition. 

THE CORDELIA FIQ AND THE ERINOCYCE. 

The only certain instance of male flowers having been found in an 
edible fig in California is that which I am about to mention. 

In July, 1893, 1 found a box of figs in the market of San Francisco, 
marked as having come from Cordelia, in Solano County, containing 
very large yellow figs, a size larger than our largest Adriatic. Upon 
opening these figs I found every one with a fully developed zone of 
male flowers, fully ripe, and with an abundant, perfectly developed 
pollen. In other respects the figs resembled very much the Italian 
Gentile, which is now also growing in California in various localities. 
These figs belonged to a distinct variety and were propagated as table 
figs, though the dry zone of male flowers greatly detracted from the 
quality of the fig. The fig was juicy and very sweet. It is not 
impossible that this fig is identical with the Croisic fig described by 
Solms-Laubach, and that it was brought here by settlers from Croisic, 
in France. 

It may be stated that both myself and Mr. E. W. Maslin, of Cali- 
fornia, have raised seedlings of Smyrna figs. Some of those raised 
by the latter came to partial maturity at least, and contained male 
flowers in greater or lesser abundance. Such figs, however, must be 
considered as improved caprifigs — improved by being raised from 
seed of Smyrna figs. The Cordelia and Croisic figs are probably 
descendants from the male caprifig, having retained the male flowers, 
while they also have developed sweetness and juiciness to a greater 
degree than their wild parents. It is hardly to be expected that these 
figs will develop perfect seeds without the aid of the Blastophaga, as 
it is probable that they, as other figs, will bring their male and female 
flowers to perfection at widely diiferent times; in other words, that 
when their female flowers will be receptive their male flowers will 
not yet have developed their pollen. 

It must be clearly understood that edible figs possessing male flow- 
ers are inferior to those which do not possess any, and the presence 
of male flowers is without any value from a horticultural point of 
view. The Blastophaga can not live in those figs, because they do 
not possess perfect gall flowers; the pollen can not be utilized for 
pollination or caprification, because there is no practical way of getting 
it out of the fig and onto the flowers of the next crop; and finally, such 
figs are inferior for eating, as the male zone is dry and not eatable. 

The fig known as Erinocyce is of great scientific interest, though 
not horticulturally valuable. Pontedera was the first to describe 
and name this rare variety. It is characterized as standing half- 
way between the caprifig and the edible fig. Its first crop possesses 



CAPRIFIOATION OF THE FIG. 97 

male flowers as well as gall flowers with inquilines or wasps. This 
crop is not edible. The second crop contains perfect female flowers. 
Solms-Laubach, who has had opportunity to observe the mammoni or 
second crop of this fig, states that the mammoni possessed both female 
flowers with perfect embryos and gall flowers with wasps. This flg 
does not seem to be related to the Croisic or Cordelia figs. 

In the caprifig we have three kinds of flowers: Male flowers, which, 
on account of the time of ripening of the pollen, can pollinate only 
female flowers of the succeeding crop; female flowers, which produce 
seed, but which, on account of the early time at which they are recep- 
tive, can be pollinated only by the pollen of the preceding crop; gall 
flowers, which resemble the female flowers, but which are at no time 
receptive, and which serve no other purpose than breeding places for 
the Blastophaga wasp. .The female flowers of the caprifig are found 
only in the second crop or mammoni. The object of this restriction 
of nature is due to the fact that it is this crop alone which falls to the 
ground at a time when, on account of climatic conditions, seeds could 
germinate. The profichi as well as the mamme fall during the dry 
season, when no seeds would find the proper moisture to germinate. 

VARIOUS KINDS OF MATURITY. 

In the fig we can distinguish between botanical and pomological 
maturity. Gallesio was the first one to make the distinction, which 
is here adopted, somewhat modified, as being of particular use in 
demonstrating the nature of the fig. We find that some or most edible- 
fig varieties set and mature their figs without pollination, but that, 
as a consequence, such figs contain no perfect flowers with fertile 
embryos. This state of maturity may be called pomological maturity, 
as it does not necessarily require the botanical perfection of the flow- 
ers. Pomological maturity is attained by the great majority of edible 
flgs, and is probably an inheritance from the caprifig, which becomes 
similarly pomologically mature. This pomological maturity is not 
necessarily accompanied by any botanical maturity, as, fpr instance, 
is proven by our California figs, which never contain any fertile 
seed unless caprificated.^ 

I'he other kind of maturity may be called botanical maturity, as it 
requires the flowers to be perfectly developed, with perfect embryos, 
in order that the fruit may set and become also pomologically mature. 
If the fruit is edible or cultivated as a fruit, the pomological maturity 
will always be eifected by the botanical maturity. The Smyrna figs 
can only attain pomological maturity by first being botanically 

1 The fact that one tree has been fonnd which produces male flowers, and accord- 
ing to the finder also seed, does not in the least detract from this theory. The 
Cordelia fig, as well as the Croisic fig, must be considered as a modified caprifig 
which has not yet lost its male flowers.

Th e pomological ma turity usually indicate s and implies a long -con- 
tinued cultivatio n of the frui t by man, and relates chiefly to culti- 
vated fruits. Among other fruits besides the fig which attain pomo- 
logical maturity without botanical maturity at the same time we may 
mention some varieties of dates, one variety of pomegranate, the seed- 
less orange, many apples and pears, the common edible banana, the 
pepino solanum of Central and South America, seedless grapes, and 
a number of other fruits and vegetables in which the seeds afre 
abortive and have become so partly through the continued asexual 
propagations of the plant and partly from other causes. Botanical 
maturity is attained by all fruits which produce perfect seed, and if 
the fruit is edible it is also pomologically mature. 

But it must be remembered that the fruits here enumerated as 
attaining pomological maturity are in general such as have been 
developed from pollinated flowers. Few other fruits than the fig are 
known to develop without previous pollination. The development of 
the common edible-fig receptacle must therefore be considered some- 
what in the same light as the maturity and development reached by 
a tuber, or by the stems of the sugar cane, etc. Pomological maturity 
merely indicates that the fruit becomes edible, while botanical- matur- 
ity means that the fruit has developed fertile seeds. 

SEEDS IN SMYRNA FIGS. 

We have already several times referred to the fact that all edible 
figs may be divided into two distinct classes or types — one which 
when ripe does not necessarily contain fertile seeds and one which 
can not become ripe without also containing fertile seeds, as otherwise 
it would not be ripe or mature. There are also other differences. 
The Smyrna figs belong to the latter class, and they always contain 
ripe and fertile seeds. 

But as the cultivated Smyrna fig never contains any male flowers, 
and as caprification with the wild fig is always resorted to in order to 
cause the figs to mature, it is evident that the seeds thus produced 
must, when growing, give us hybrid plants — plants which more or 
less partake of both parents, the wild as well as the Smyrna fig. 

Artificial pollination of figs is no new or remarkable discovery. 
Gasparrini relates how ^ he repeatedly introduced the pollen of the 

* Gasparrini, 1. c, under point No. 8. He says he impregnated artificially thirty 
flower heads on a Lardaro fig by introducing into the aperture the pollen of the 
caprifig. In California this experiment was first tried in 1890 by Mr. G. C. 
Roeding. 



CAPBIFICATION OF THE FIO. 99 

3aprifig into edible figs, especially of the Lardaro variety. BBt his 
pollination produced no decided results. No increase in the num- 
ber of fertile seeds was noticed, either because the flowers of the 
Lardaro variety were principally mule flowers, on which the pollen 
could have no effect, or because the female flowers had all been pre- 
viously pollinated. From this Gasparrini draws the illogical con- 
clusion, repeatedly quoted by later writers, that the caprifig is of a 
species different from the edible fig; that its pollen can not influence or 
fecundate the female flowers of the edible fig, and that consequently 
the practice of caprification is illusionary and of no value whatever. 
Gasparrini did not know of the class of figs which I have designated 
as the Smyrna type, and which, unlike any other class, produces 
principally receptive female flowers, which do not produce seed with- 
out the aid of pollen from the caprifig. Had Gasparrini had oppor- 
tunity to extend his interesting and minute investigations to this class 
of figs, the conclusions to whtch he came would no doubt have been 
greatly modified. 

SMYRNA FIGS IN CALIFORNIA. 

The history of the Smyrna figs in California is intensely interesting, 
and directly bearing upon this point of the production of fertile seeds. 
Imported in 1880 (for details see the historical part) and quite exten- 
sively propagated and planted in the most dissimilar parts of Cali- 
fornia, these figs failed to bear a single ripe fruit during a period of 
ten years. The fruit would form in abundance, the flowers would 
develop and become apparently receptive, as shown by the glands of 
the stigma and the length of the style, but the fruit would invaria- 
bly fall when apparently one-third or one-half grown. It was this 
fact, together with my observation that imported Smyrna figs always 
possessed numerous fertile seeds, while such were never found in our 
other edible figs, that made me a strong advocate of caprification, 
and which satisfied me that pollination was necessary and not illu- 
sionary, as almost everyone else ^ believed, principally on the testi- 
mony of Gasparrini and Olivier. It would indeed have been strange 
that Smyrna figs should not ripen their fruit in California, if the 
maturing depended only on climatic conditions or differences in soil. 
These figs, consisting of three distinct varieties, were planted in the 
most dissimilar localities and in greatly different soils, and exposed 
to varied climatic conditions found in the northern, central, and 
southern parts of California, in the interior valleys, in the foothills, 
and on the coast. All the Old World fig districts together would 
hardly show more variations in climatic and other conditions than 
did the various localities in which the Smyrna figs were tried in this 



^ As is cnstomary with nnpopular theories, the first remarks on caprification in 
California were simply sneered at, and at the best considered illusionary, and 
heated discussions were entered into.

state. Still not one tree properly matured a single fruit. A few of 
the first crop became half ripened — that is, became yellow and soft, 
but insipid, not sweet, and never attained a proper size or a size at 
all approaching that of the imported dried figs. 

Acting on the principle that the want of success in producing 
Smyrna figs here was due entirely to the absence of Blastophaga 
wasps and to want of pollination, the writer began experiments in this 
direction in 1882 and was later joined in them by E. W. Maslin, of 
San Francisco. Some of these experiments are recorded in the author's 
Biological Studies on Figs, Caprifigs, and Caprification, published in 
the Proceedings of the California Academy of Sciences, 1895, and for 
particulars reference may be made to that work. It is enough to state 
here that there were produced numerous fully mature and perfect 
Smyrna figs on the imported Smyrna trees by simply introducing the 
pollen into the figs at a time when the pistillate flowers were fully 
receptive. Thus, once for all, was settled the question of the neces- 
sity and nature of caprification, and it was demonstrated that the 
want of success in producing Smyrna figs in California was alone due 
to the want of pollination by Blastophaga wasps. The author's 
experiments also demonstrated that the varieties of the first importa- 
tion of Smyrna figs into California, the genuineness of which had been 
doubted, by nearly everyone, were genuine. This collection, consist- 
ing of several hundred trees, was brought here by G. P. Rixford in 
1880 and 1882, through the aid of Consul E. J. Smithers in Smyrna. 
On account of the persistent dropping of the figs the idea originated 
by the late Dr. Stillman became prevalent that these figs were not 
what they pretended to be, but simply wild figs sent us by the jealous 
Smyrna growers, who were afraid that our fig production would come 
into competition with their own products. On that account most of 
the "Bulletin"^ figs were rooted out. 

During the year 1900 the chief of the Entomological Division of the 
United States Department of Agriculture, Dr. L. O. Howard, sent one 
of his assistants, Mr. E. A. Schwarz, to Fresno and Niles, Cal., to pur- 
sue studies in connection with caprification. During his investiga- 
tions Mr. Schwarz caprificated several thousand Smyrna fig trees in 
the Roeding orchard near Fresno. The result was that some 6 tons 
of dried figs of the true Smyrna varieties were produced. These figs 
were all of very good quality and possessed the characteristics of the 
Smyrna figs. This year I am informed that some 30,000 caprifigs have 
been used for caprification on the same place, and a much larger crop 
may be expected. The time for caprification in the central part of 
the San Joaquin Valley is in the middle of June, while at Niles, near 
San Francisco Bay, the time for caprification is in July. There exist

CAPRIFICATION OF THE ¥1Q. 101 

now in California some five or six different varieties of the genuine 
Smyrna figs and some nineteen different kinds of caprifigs. During 
the last season many thousand genuine Smyrna figs have been planted 
all over the State, and we may expect that in five or six j'ears from 
now the harvest of figs of the Smyrna varieties will be considerably 
increased. In the meantime improvements are constantly being made 
in handling and curing the common figs for market. 

The Blastophaga wasps are now apparently well established in this 
country. They wintered safely in the mamme figs both at Niles and at 
Fresno. At Niles the temperature fell as low as 22^ Fahrenheit, but 
no harm was done to the fig insects. At Niles only one variety car- 
ried its mamme over winter. The other varieties of caprifigs dropped 
their mamme figs after the first fall frost. This may have been due 
to the immature age or the nature of the trees. It shows, however, 
the necessity of planting a number of different kinds of caprifigs in 
order to have a succession of crops and a constant supply of caprifigs 
both winter and summer. 

SEEDS IN THE COMMON EDIBLE, NOT CAPRIFICATED FIGS. 

As common figs I arrange, as has already been stated, all fig 
varieties with only or principally mule flowers, which set and mature 
their figs without the aid of pollen. If the seeds of such figs are 
examined under the microscope it will at once be seen that they are 
seeds only in appearance, but not in reality. They are mere glossy 
hulls of a yellow or brown color, with no kernel and embryo capable 
of development. Even without the aid of a microscope this may be 
ascertained by crushing the seeds with the point of a knife. The 
shell will then be seen to collapse, the interior being absolutely with- 
out any kernel. Although I have examined many thousands of figs 
grown in California during the past ten years or more, I have failed 
to find a single seed properly developed. I at first attributed this to 
the former total absence of caprifigs in this State. I now believe it 
to be due in equal degree to the absence, or scarcity, of female recep- 
tive flowers in our figs, generally speaking. This observation in regard 
to the absence of seeds in common figs has been repeatedly made in 
Europe. 

The conclusion which I draw from the above and other investiga- 
tions in regard to the perfect and fertile seeds found in our common 
edible figs, which produce fruit without pollination, are as follows: 
Figs with only mule flowers do not generally produce seed with fertile 
embryos. Their so-called seeds are mere shells without kernel. When 
this class of figs is found to contain seeds with developed embryo, 
it is to be explained by the presence of perfect female flowers, which 
again have been brought to development by the introduction of pollen, 
either by the Blastophaga wasps or by some other means. Some fig 
varieties of this class contain many female flowers. 



102 THE fig: its history, oultube, and cubing. 

Parthenogenesis, or seed development without pollen, has been sup- 
posed to exist in at least one tropical fig {Ficus roxburghii) ; here, how- 
ever, only by excitement caused by the sting of a Blastophaga, with- 
out pollination. That this is not the process of seed production in the 
Smyrna tribe of our edible fig is absolutely and conclusively proven 
by the experiments of Mr. E. W. Maslin and myself. We produced 
seedlings from Smyrna fig seeds which all, when arriving at bearing 
age, proved to be hybrids between the edible Smyrna and the wild cap- 
rifig. This hybridization could of course not possibly have taken 
place except by the introduction of pollen to the female flowers. If 
their seeds had developed by parthenogenesis the seedlings would not 
have been hybrids, but would have been varieties of the Smyrna fig. 
The seeds were taken from imported Smyrna figs, which had been 
caprificated in Aidin. 

DIFFERENT TYPES OF EDIBLE FIGS. 

We can distinguish a number of distinct classes or types of figs 
which differ from one another in several very important points. Of 
these types there are at least six which are well characterized. 

Common figs, Mission figs, or first type, — The common edible figs, 
which produce both ripe brebas (first crop) and second-crop figs 
(receptacles) without caprification or pollination. This type becomes 
pomologically mature, but rarely botanically mature. Its fiowers are 
mainly mule fiowers and a few female fiowers, but no perfect gall fiowers 
and no male flowers. This class includes nearly all of our common edi- 
ble figs in Europe and California and all those propagated in hothouses. 
This class of figs bears several crops, but there is no great or impor- 
tant difference either in the receptacle or in the fiowers of the respec- 
tive crops. Some, or possibly all, of the fig varieties belonging to this 
type produce some fertile seeds when pollinated or caprificated. For 
this type I propose the name Mission figs as a suitable name, because 
the principal and best-known representative of this class is known in 
this country as the Mission fig. 

Smyrna figs, or second type, — This type or group comprises the 
Smyrna figs and is characterized by its flowers, which are female only, 
perfectly developed. They produce fruit only when pollinated or 
caprificated. They have no mule fiowers, no gall fiowers, and no 
male fiowers. The fruit becomes botanically ripe,' and as a conse- 
quence of the botanical maturity the receptacle becomes also pomo- 
logically ripe. This is a purely female type, all the fiowers being 
perfectly developed female fiowers. This type of figs is at present 
confined chiefly to the Smyrna district, being there the only fig culti- 
vated for commercial purposes. In the other Mediterranean districts 
this type of figs is rare or unknown. Introduced to California, it 
never produced fruit until pollinated. 

San Pedro figs, or third type. — This is the San Pedro type, with 



CAPRIFICATION OF THE FIG. 103 

different flowers in the different crops. The first crop or "fiori" 

V contains only mule flowers. This crop becomes consequently pomo- 

\ logically ripe without pollination or caprification, and it is question- 

[ able if it will ever become botanically ripe or produce seeds, even if 

caprificated. 

\The second crop contains only fully developed female flowers which 
require pollination in order to set fruit or become botanically mature, 
the receptacle never becoming pomologically mature as long as the 
flowers are not pollinated. 

To this class belongs a limited number of figs, which are especially 
valuable on account of their '' brebas " or first crop. Among varieties 
belonging to this crop are the San Pedro (yellow), the Gentile, the 
Bitontoni, the Portuguese, and a few others. 

Adriatic figs, or fourth type. — This type contains figs which do not 
; mature brebas, or first crop, without caprification or pollination. 
Except under the latter condition this first crop always drops. When 
pollinated or caprificated again the crop sets and matures. The cer- 
lainty of this fact is due to experiments made lately by Mr. John C: 
Jones, who caprificated at Niles an Adriatic fig tree in April last. 
This tree is the only one out of many which has set a crop of brebas, 
all others having dropped theirs. On cutting open these caprificated 
brebas we find that they contain perfectly developed seeds. The 
second crop of this type of figs does not require caprification in order 
to reach pomological maturity. To this class belong a very large 
number of figs which have until now been cultivated only for their 
second crop. The second crop contains many female flowers. 

Cordelia figs, or fifth type. — To this type belong all figs which, like 
the Cordelia, Croisic, and others, possess edible figs with male flowers. 

Erinocyce figs, or sixth type. — To this type belongs the Erinocyce fig 
previously described. It possesses male flowers and gall flowers in 
the first crop and female flowers and gall flowers in the second crop. 
The flrst crop is not edible. To what extent the Erinocyce and the 
Cordelia type combine is not known. 

Origin of the types. — The origin of these various types I derive 
from the various crops of the caprifig, through artificial or horticul- 
tural selection. The first type may have descended from the male 
tree of the caprifig, through elimination of the male flowers. The 
gall flowers in not being used for galls would naturally endeavor 
to regain their female nature, while the female flowers, by now and 
then being pollinated, would more or less retain their female or seed- 
producing nature. This theory was first suggested by me in a letter to 
Professor Solms-Laubach, who, however, thinks that the origin of 
this class may be equally well explained by supposing their descent 
from the female caprifig, in which case the female flowers, through 
nonuse, have become degenerated. But the fact that this class con- 
tains both mule flowers and perfect female flowers speaks, I think, in 
23740— No. 9—01 8 



104 THE fig: its history, culture, and curing. 

favor of my theory that the mule flowers are in reality only degener- 
ated gall flowers, or perhaps more correctly gall flowers which through 
nonuse are regaining their female nature. If descended from the 
female tree of the caprifig there is nothing to explain why some of 
the flowers are capable of producing seed while others are not. 

The second type, or Smyrna figs, must have descended directly from 
the female tree of the caprifig, their flowers having retained their 
female nature through constant caprification. 

The third and fourth classes are more difficult to explain. Th^y 
have probably descended from ti cross between a female Smyrna and 
a caprifig. 

The fifth class is nothing else than a direct descendant from the 
male caprifig. It retains its male flowers, they having not yet been 
eliminated, while the pomological maturity is simply an improved 
botanical maturity of the caprifig, as it is well known that several 
varieties of capritigs are edible, though inferior in quality. 

How this cultural evolution and development could have taken 
place is not difficult to understand. The efforts of man to cultivate 
and propagate only the best or what x)roves most suited to his purposes 
have caused him to gradually discard, first all inferior trees, later all 
inferior varieties, all which either did not suit his taste or which in 
other respects did not prove as profitable as others. This progress in 
selecting varieties has been continued to our own day with nearly all 
kinds of fruit, progressing more or less rapidly, according to the intel- 
ligence and civilization of the cultivators. As the fig is one of the 
oldest of fruits mentioned in the history of the human race, the 
selection and improvement of varieties must have taken place at an 
early date; in fact, at the dawn of higher civilization. No barbarous 
people could evolve the luscious edible fig from the insignificant and 
worthless caprifig, even if we suppose that some chance seedling of 
the female type with superior fruits had been found. The likelihood 
that caprification was invented simultaneously with the cultivation of 
the first edible fig makes ib more probable that the civilization of the 
people in question was considerable. The origin of the edible fig of 
the Smyrna kind must be traced to some one of those ancient'nations 
of the valleys of the Euphrates and Tigris whose history and remains 
archseologists are now beginning to unravel. 

It is possible that the Smyrna race of figs was first originated and 
that later the other class of edible figs was evolved. Or it may be 
that both originated simultaneously, or nearly so, in separate coun- 
tries. The truth and facts of this we will probably never know, and 
our assertions can only have the value of more or less probable 
conjectures. 

The first figs of either class must have been very inferior to those 
now considered our best. The class which descended from seeds of 
the male caprifig must, to begin with, have possessed some male flowers 



CAPRIFIOATION OF THE.FIG. 



105 



in at least one of its crops. The first effort in selection must have 
been to eliminate these male flowers, as both they and the part of the 
receptacle on which they grow are hard, dry, and otherwise not pal- 
atable. Thus in the Croisic fig the male flowers, together with their 
part of the receptacle, is always removed before eating, and this neces- 
sary process must have first stimulated effort to produce a fig without 
the objectionable parts. While this selection and improvement of 
edible figs was being carried on by the ancient cultivators the wild fig 
was not entirely left to itself. It was found necessary in some instances 
to propagate even the wild fig in order to procure the figs for caprifi- 
cation. What would be more natural than to suppose that those figs 
were especially propagated which produced greater abundance of 
pollen and a more perfect continuation of crops? This selection in a 
small way would in time give rise to several types, even among the 
wild figs, similar to those, perhaps, described by Pontedera, Gallesio, 
and others. 

After the first objectionable features of male flowers were eliminated 
other improvements followed as to flavor, taste, sweetness, etc. 



FIG INSECTS. 
PIG WASPS OR BLASTOPHAGAS. 



All known wild fig trees, and there are over 100 distinct species 
described ^ by botanists, are inhabited by very minute wasps known 




Fig. IG.—Blaatophaga grosaorum: a, adult female; 6, head of same from below; c, head of same 
from side; d, Qiale impregnating female; e, female issuing from gall; /, adult male— enlarged 
(after Westwood). (From Smyrna Pig Culture in the United States, by Dr. L. O. Howard.) 

as "inquilines" or parasites, and scientifically described as Blasto- 
phagce, (See fig. 16.) These Blastophagas not only visit the figs, but 
they live, breed, and 'develop in them; nay more, if deprived of their 
fig hosts, these Blastophagas could not live, breed, and develop any- 
where else. The organization of these little wasps is such that while 



' According to Willkomm, there are 500 species of figs described. 



106 THE fig: its history, culture, AIS^D CURING. 

they may possibly feed themselves for a short time (though it is doubt- 
ful if they do feed at all), they could not possibly deposit their eggs 
elsewhere than in the " gall flower" of their respective fig, not even in 
the female flowers of the same fig. Even if they did succeed in doing 
so, their eggs would not develop elsewhere and the brood would soon 
perish. The species would thus become extinct. But this is not all. 
The relation between the fig and the Blastophagas is so intimate that 
in order to foster these little wasps nature provides the fig with flowers 
especially constructed to their use — the "gall fiowers" elsewhere 
described. But if the Blastophaga is dependent upon the fig for its 
existence, the fig is hardly the less so upon the Blastophaga. With- 
'>ut the Blastophaga no fertile seed would be produced with any regu- 
larity (if at all) and the fig species would be in danger of perishing. 
The influence of the Blastophaga is somewhat diiferent in different 
fig species. It has been shown that in one species at least not only 
the female flowers are dependent for their pollination upon the Blasto- 
phagas, but that the male flowers actually do not develop their ferti- 
lizing pollen without having first been stimulated by the mechanical 
action of the Blastophaga. ^ ' 

Figs are visited by many insects, but a distinction must be made 
between "visitors" or "messmates" and "regular boarders." The 
former visit the figs in order to feed, either on the fruit and its juices 
or upon other insects. The boarders or "inquilines" again breed in 
the fig and can not breed anywhere else. The former will injure the 
fig in various degrees, while the latter are absolutely necessary for the 
material maintenance and multiplication of the fig-tree species they 
inhabit. 

LIFE HISTORY OF THE CAPRIFIQ WASP (BLASTOPHAGA GROSSORUM). 

If we during the month of June or July ^ cut open a "profico" or 
first-crop caprifig just when it is full grown we may notice that it 
contains a large number of gall fiowers or galls, around which crawl 
numerous little insects, some of which resemble minute black wasps, 
while othera of the same size are wingless and very differently shaped, 
as well as being of a yellow or brown color. A closer inspection will 
reveal to us that a number of the galls are perforated by a single 
round hole through which may either be seen the hollow of the gall, 
or the wasp itself, not having yet escaped. A closer inspection may 
even show us how the light-colored insects, which are the male wasps, 
are enlarging the holes in order to enable the females or winged wasps 



^ The time differs according to the climatic conditions of the locality. In Italy 
caprification is practiced in June. At Niles, Cal., the caprifigs mature in the 
middle of Jaly. In Lower California, I found the Blastophagas emerging from the 
figs of IHcus palmeri in March, from what must have been the first crop of that 
fig. A later generation again emerged in September. 



CAPRIFIOATION OF THE FIG. 107 

to escape. These respective insec^ts are male and female of the same 
species known to naturalists variously as Blastophaga psenes, Blasto- 
phaga grossorum^ or Cynips psenes. The number of female Blasto- 
phagas which may issue from a single profico is often very large. 
I have counted as many as two hundred from one fig, and it is known 
that some varieties of caprifig profichi may harbor as many as 700 
wasps. 

The male insects are the first to hatch and escape; with their 
powerful mandibles or jaws they easily cut through their galls and 
then set to work to liberate the females. Before the latter escape 
they are fecundated, while yet in the gall, by the males. £ach gall 
contains only one wasp. The male wasps never leave the fig. They 
are so constructed that they could not very well live outside, and 
even inside the fig they soon perish, their life work having been 
accomplished in liberating and fecundating the females. The females 
do not tarry long in the fig, but soon find their way out through the 
eye of the fig, which has opened sufficiently to let them pass through 
without injury to their wings.* In case the fig has been injured and 
compressed in such a way as to close the eye the wasps will remain 
prisoners until otherwise let out — for instance, by cutting the fig. 

With care and aided by a magnifying glass, we maj' further follow 
the female Blastophagas as thej^ escape from their old habitation. 
Their first work is to look for figs suitable to lay their eggs in, the 
only object of the wasps now being to propagate their species, it 
being doubtful if tliey feed at all. As soon as outside of the old 
caprifig the female Blastophaga halts on the outside of the fig and_ 
endeavors to free herself of a whitish powder with which she appears 
to be literally covered. This powder is the pollen from the anthers of 
the male flowers of the caprifig in which she hatched and with which 
she came in contact when she escaped from the fig. This process of 
cleaning she performs in very much the same way as does a house fly, 
stroking herself with her front legs, bending at. the same time the 
head, body, and wings. She never succeeds in getting entirely clean, 
as a large portion of the pollen will adhere in spite of all her efforts. 
But when she considers herself sufficiently clean she flies away and 
lights on a less than half -grown caprifig of the same or some other 
tree. The mammoni or second crop of the caprifig has by this time 
advanced so far in development that its interior flowers are just of 
the proper size and age to suit the wasps. ^ If there are no such figs 
at hand the wasps will soon perish. Having lit on a mammoni, the 



^ In the Baja California species of Blastophaga which inhabits Ficus palmeri 
the wasps do not crawl through the eye of the fig, but cut a round hole below the 
eye and thus escape in the same way as they did from their galls, except that the 
hole made in the fig is larger than the hole in the gall. 

^ As has been shown elsewhere, this is not always the case. If there are no caprl- 
figs of proper size the wasp can not lay her eggs. 



108 THE FIO: IT8 HISTORY, OULTITRE, AND CURING. 

Blastophaga finds the fig eye closed by scales. ^ But these scales are 
not impossible to penetrate. In order to enter the fig the Blasto- 
phaga Saws out a tiny little piece of the outside edge of a top scale, 
which opens to her an entrance between two scales. Next she pushes 
herself under the scale and then zigzags herself through, until she 
reaches the interior hollow of the fig. But her efforts to get through 
between the scales have been tremendous, and in so doing she almost 
invariably loses her wings. They are always lost in the very begin- 
ning of her work and can be seen remaining, wedged in between the 
outside scales just like feathers stuck under the band of a hat. In 
order to ascertain the presence of the Blastophaga in a green fig it is 
not always necessary to cut the fig' open, as the presence of ^the wings 
of the wasp sticking between the scales is a sure sign that the wasp 
has succeeded in getting in. And even if the wings have fallen off, 
the little wound caused by the gnawing of the wasp can be told by 
the minute drop of sap that has oozed out and hardened. It is this 
drop of sap which was, remarkably enough, for ages considered as 
being the real cause of the setting of the figs. If no wings and no 
gum are seen on the scale it may be safely assumed that no Blasto- 
phaga has entered the fig in question. 

As soon as the now wingless Blastophaga has entered the fig she 
hurries down to the gall flowers, there to deposit her eggs. Of these 
she inserts only one in each flower. The egg is generally placed in the 
same way and in the same particular spot in the flower. This partic- 
ular place lies between the nucellus of the fig ovary and the integu- 
ment surrounding it. Observation shows that if left anywhere else 
the egg will not develop. In order to accomplish this the wasp first 
alights on the stigma of the gall flower. Then she extends her ovipos- 
itor and runs it down through the canal which, from the center of the 
stigma, leads through the whole length of the style to the funnel or 
entrance to the ovary of the flower. This is penetrated by the ovipos- 
itor, and the egg is laid and securely wedged in between the nucellus 
of the ovary and the integument surrounding it. (See fig. 17.) 

As soon as the egg is deposited the ovipositor of the wasp is with- 
drawn. The lower part of the canal is filled by a filiform appendage 
of the egg, while the upper part fills with a brown exudation from the 
wounded cells. As soon as one egg has been laid the wasp departs 
to another flower, there to repeat the process. The egg-depositing 
power of a wasp is simply enormous, and one wasp is capable of lay- 
ing an egg in each of the many gall flowers of a fig. After the eggs 
have all been deposited the Blastophaga endeavors to regain the out- 
side of the fig in the same way she entered; but in this she rarely suc- 
ceeds. Being by the egg-laying process completely exhausted, she 

*The closing of the eye by scales is a necessity. If the eye was open the Blasto- 
phaga would find the fig full of other insects, and the function in the fig flowers 
would be seriously, if not fatally, interfered with.

generally succumbs before she regains her liberty, and her dead body 
may be found in the opened fig The work of the Blastophaga has 
not alone been that of depositing eggs. Involuntarily she has rubbed 
against some of the female flowers of the ^g, and the pollen which 
adhered to her body when she entered has been deposited on the 
stigmas of these flowers. The effect of this pollination is the devel- 
opment of seeds in the female flowers. This would not have taken 
place without the aid of the wasp, because the pollen from another 
fig could not very well have penetrated through the closely thatched 
scales of the eye; and the pollen from a male flower in the same fig 
would only be ripe from a month to six weeks after the time when 
the stigmas of the female flowers will have attained their full 
development and receptivity. After the egg has been deposited 
the gall flower does not at once cease 
to develop. The embryo and kernel of 
the seed, keep on growing for a month. 
After that the egg of the Blastophaga 
begins to develop, and when it passes 
into the larva stage it begins to feed on 
the embryo of the fig, which thus soon 
perishes. The integument of the ovar}- 
again grows and assumes the form of a 
large, hard, brownish, and glass-like 
gall. In two months the young female 
Blastophaga wasps have attained their 
full development, and after copulation 
with the wingless males are ready to 
leave the caprifigs; and this they do in 
the same way as they left the previous 
crop, the profichi. The males die within 
the figs in all the crops. They have 
performed their function and are of no 
more use. It may here be incidentally 
stated that even if the wasp's egg is not deposited in a gall flower, the 
latter will after a certain lime cease to develop. It will never produce 
seed. 

At this time the winter figs or the " mamme " destined to mature the 
following year are of the proper size and development required by the 
Blastophagas, which enter them in the same way as described above 
in order to deposit eggs. The mamme hibernate, and next spring, in 
March, develop and ripen and the young Blastophagas leave as before. 
(PI. XIII.) They immediately afterwards enter the first-crop capri- 
figs and their deposited eggs will by the end of June or July have 
developed into perfect wasps. 

The cycle of the Blastophaga is thus perfected and we have followed 
its life history through the various crops of the caprifig through the

year. Each crop of figs has, as we have seen, had its own crop or 
brood of wasps, from which it follows that if the profichi or mamme 
should fail the wasps would also perish. 

To facilitate the understanding of the life histor3' of the wasp, as 
observed in Italy, the following diagrammatic table has been prepared. 

A. Profichi of the caprifig, October to June: 

1. In March or April these figs are less than quarter grown. 

2. The Blastophaga females, issuing from the mamme, enter the figs and here 

deposit their eggs in the gall fiowers. 

3. In June, or two months later, these Blastophaga eggs have become fully 

developed, and the perfect wasps emerge to seek other figs. 

4. In emerging the wasps are covered with pollen. 

B. Mammoni of the caprifig, June to autumn: 

1. In June and July the second crop is quarter grown. 

2. The Blastophagas emerging from the previous crop penetrate into these 

second-crop figs and deposit their eggs in the gall flowers. 

3. In doing so they also pollinate the female flowers. 

4. In August or September the Blastophaga eggs are fully developed and the 

perfect wasps emerge, hunting for the young figs of the mamme. 

5. A few seeds fully developed are found in this the second crop of the capri- 

fig, none being found in the other two crops. 

C. Mamme of the caprifig^ July, through winter, to March. 

1. In autumn the mamme are quarter grown. 

2. The Blastophaga, hatching from the preceding crop, enter the mamme and 

there deposit their eggs in the gall flowers. 
. 3. The mamme, with the gall flowers and the eggs of the Blastophaga, hiber- 
nate on the tree, slowly increasing in size. 

4. With the advent of spring the matnme and the Blastophaga eggs develop 

more rapidly. 

5. In March and April the Blastophaga eggs have developed into full-grown 

wasps, which emerge from the figs seeking the young figs of the first crop, 
the profichi, in order to deposit their eggs in them. 

PRACTICAL CAPRIFICATION. 

Process of caprification, — The process of caprification consists in 
bringing the caprifigs, of the proper age and crop, in close proximity 
to the edible figs, in order that the wasps, as soon as they leave the 
caprifigs, may be lured into the edible figs. Practically, this is 
Accomplished in different ways, more or less proper and economical. 
Iq Smyrna, Syria, Greece, Italy, and Africa the caprifigs are pulled 
at the proper time in June, the profichi being the only crop used for 
this purpose. The caprifigs are then becoming soft and the male 
flowers ready to shed their pollen. The caprifigs are at once strung 
on split reeds or rou^h straws in quantities of four on each straw. 
(Fig. 18.) These straws are thrown over and suspended among the 
branches of the edible-fig tree. Another method, much inferior to 



CAPRIFIOATION OF THE FIG. Ill 

the former, consists simply in cutting branches from the caprifig trees 
and suspending them in the edible-fig trees. This injures the caprifig 
trees and does not enable the cultivator to regulate the number of 
caprifigs according to the quantity actually needed. This method is 
in use only in certain parts of Portugal and Spain. A third way to 
accomplish caprification is to plant a few caprifig trees among the 
edible-fig trees, and to simplj^ depend upon the wasps themselves 
finding their waj'^ in sufficient number to the edible figs. This 
method is the least proper of any for many reasons, one of which 
is that the caprifig thrives equally well or even better in poor, rocky, 
soil, and it would be more economical to give the good soil over to 
the edible-fig trees. This leads us to the necessity of having separate 
plantations for the caprifig. 

Separate plantations of caprifigs. — In most countries where caprifi- 
cation is practiced it is a general saying that it is necessary to go to 
the hills for the caprifigs.^ It is not only more economical, as has just 
been pointed out, to grow the caprifigs separately, but it is in many 
instances necessary. The soil and moisture in the orchard are not 
always suitable to the caprifig. It must be remembered that the 
caprifig is yet in its comparatively wild state, while the edible fig 
is a horticultural product or creation which can only be expected 
to attain its proper qualities under the most favorable conditions. 
Practically this is true. It frequently happens that when the edible 
figs are receptive, or their female flowers ready for pollination through 
caprification, the caprifigs growing in the vicinity .of the edible figs 
are not properly developed, while other caprifigs grown in different 
soil and at a different elevation are just of the proper size and con- 
dition to furnish both Blastophagas and pollen. But an even more~ 
serious objection to having a few caprifigs growing in rich soil its 
that their crops are not always following each other in continuous 
succession. The Blastophaga, in order to properly propagate her 
brood, requires young caprifigs ready to receive her eggs as soon as 
she hatches out. Frequently the tree from which she hatches does 
not possess these figs, while other caprifig trees do. It is therefore 
necessary, in order to procure a constant supply of Blastophagas, to 
have a large number of different varieties of caprifig trees growing 
together. In a grove of such trees there will always be some that 
bear figs of proper size in which the wasps may breed. Such plan- 
tations of caprifigs should be made separately and in various locali- 
ties, in order that the supply of figs may never fail. Quite frequently 
it also happens that the caprifig crop in a certain locality fails, while 
in a different one, where the climatic conditions have been dissii^- 
ilar, the crop of caprifigs may be abundant. This shows the neces- 

' Prof. Newton B. Pierce, of the Department of Agriculture, in Washington, who 
has observed caprification in Sicily, informs me that in the vicinity of Palermo 
the caprifigs are always brought from the ''hills."

sity of having caprifig plantations in various localities, especially in 
a country like California, where the caprifig trees are not wild and 
where frequent importations of caprifigs with inquilines are difficult 
if not impossible. When the caprifig crop fails in Smyrna fresh capri- 
figs are imported by the vessel load from the Grecian islands, and in 
all countries where caprification is considered necessary in order to 
procure a crop of figs a regular and profitable trade is carried on in 
caprifigs, which often bring much more than the edible figs.^ Capri- 
figs should on no account be pruned, but allowed to grow wild. The 
wasps require shade, and the best caprifigs are always found in the 
densest shade. All suckers and small twigs on the main trunks of 
the caprifig tree should be allowed to remain. 

Quantities of caprifigs required, — The quantity of caprifigs needed 
to caprificate a fig tree varies with the size of the tree. The number 
depends also on the quality of the caprifig and the number of its 
wasps. In California from 20 to 50 profichi seem to sufl&ce. If too

The figs are dried and the wasps have 



few are hung on the tree an insufficient quantity of wasps is had and 
the edible figs are not all pollinated. If too many are hung too many 
wasps will enter the edible figs, injure their flowers, and, according to 
some observers, cause the figs to prematurely drop and decay. 

For smaller trees a less quantity of caprifigs is required than for 
larger trees, but even the largest in Smyrna are not given more than 
30 strings to the tree. The caprifigs are hung on the limbs of the fig 
trees before sunrise and when the wind is not blowing. The process 
of hanging up the profichi must be repeated several times, as only 
those edible figs are pollinated which are of proper size and receptiv- 
ity. For the younger figs new profichi must be supplied later on, if 
their maturity is required, and the quantity of caprifigs necessary at 
any time must be regulated according to the number of figs to be 
pollinated. 

' Solms-Lanbach, p. 60, relates how a *' Rottolo " of profichi in Ischia frequently 
brings half a lira. According to Leclerc, p. 16, c. p. 330, and Hanoteau et Letour- 
neaux, pp. 433, etc., the caprifigs sell in Fort Napoleon for 2 sous per dozen. 



CAPRIFICATtON. OF THE FIG. 113 

Proper time for caprification. — Caprifi cation should always take 
place when the female flowers of the fig are receptive. This can be 
easily ascertained by cutting open the fig. With a magnifying glass 
the stigmas of the female flowers should be seen to be bright and 
light greenish, with a peculiar fresh luster, as if they had been lightly 
varnished or moistened. Further, the stigmas and styles should be 
erect; if bent and brownish they are too old to receive the pollen and 
past their receptive state. This occurs in Smyrna and in the Medi- 
terranean districts in the middle of June. The second crop, the only 
one used, is then in proper state of development to be caprificated. 
In California the time for caprification will vary with the locality. 
In the Bay district, around San Francisco, the Smyrna figs are recep- 
tive by the end of July ; in the interior earlier, in June. The edible figs 
when ready for the caprifigs are about one-third grown, hard, and green. 
The caprifig, again, should be cut when the pollen is properly devel- 
oped and just before it has burst from the anthers. The caprifigs 
are then becoming soft, though on opening them it will be found that 
the Blastophagas have not yet begun to hatch. The size of the fig 
varies with variet}^ — as there are many varieties in caprifigs — but the 
average size would be an inch and a half long b}^ three-quarters of an 
inch wide. Some caprifigs are much smaller. Thus the caprifigs 
received from Smyrna and taken there from the fig trees in which they 
had been suspended, were almost twice as large as those brought from 
Palermo.^ The profichi and mamme are larger than the mammoni. 

The various races of caprifig vary in size and softness, some remain- 
ing always hard, while others grow larger and become soft and pulpy. 

As regards the Smyrna figs at the time of caprification, it may be 
stated that at the moment w^hen their female fiowers are I'cceptive 
the scales at the eye loosen, or rather become flexible, allowing the 
wasps to ent^r. This softness of the scales may be easily ascertained; 
as by pushing a quill or a stick against the fig eye. It easily pene? 
trates between the scales, without injury to them and without causirig 
any juice to exude, if the fig is of proper size, while, on the con- 
trary, if the fig is too young the scales will be found to be hard and 
fixed, can not be pushed back, and the least wounding will cause an 
abundance of milky juice to exude. If again the fig is too old, the 
scales will be equally hard and fixed and the fig will be yellow and 
will drop readily. 

If the fig is cut open, the stigmas should be fresh and moist, the 
styles erect and greenish, not brown. 

What takes place in caprification. — We have already followed the 
life history of the Blastophaga in the caprifig. Its history in the edi- 
ble fig is somewhat different. The wasps can not live in the edible 
figs; they can only visit them. Shortly after the profichi have been

114 THE fig: its history, culture, and curing. 

suspended, or sometimes even before, the Blastophagas begin to hatch. 
It even appears that the pulling of the caprifigs hastens the maturity 
and escape of the wasp. As soon as these have hatched they crawl 
out of the caprifigs in search of j^oung capriflg mammoni, in them to 
lay their eggs, as has already been described. But as the caprifigs 
are not near, no such mammoni are to be found. In place of them 
the wasps encounter only edible figs, and not being aware of the decep- 
tion practiced, they enter these edible figs for the purpose of breeding. 
The flowers of the edible figs are, however, so constructed that the 
intentions of the wasps are completely frustrated. Instead of the 
necessary gall flowers, which are especially adapted to the ovipositor 
organs of the wasps, only female flowers with long styles are found 
and which are otherwise so modified that the wasps find it impossible 
to properly lay their eggs. AH their frantic efforts to penetrate the 
canal of the style and to reach the fig ovary and its nucellus are in 
vain. The Blastophaga can not breed in any edible fig. Still, her 
visit has a very great effect on the edible female fig flowers, provided 
these are of the proper age and development. The pollen from the 
capriflg, with which the wasps were liberally dusted, adheres to the 
female stigmas, the effect being pollination and fecundation of the 
flowers. The*Blastophaga herself dies and her dead body may be seen 
upon opening a fig which has not advanced too far in maturity. 

It is here assumed, as is really the case, that the wasp can not prop- 
erly place its egg in the female flower, but even if she could do so or 
would accidentally do so, the egg would not properly develop, as it is 
only the gall flower which is suitable to the growth of the larva of the 
wasp. But even if by chance such development would take place the 
young wasp would quickly perish by being enveloped in the sugary 
liquid of the mature fig. A certainty is, however, that I have never 
found any gall in the mature Smyrna figs, which shows that no such 
development takes place. 

WTiat does not take place in caprification. — Since the most remote 
time so many opinions have been expressed as regards the conse- 
quences of caprification that it may be proper to here point out what 
does not take place. The old opinion that the gnawing of the wasp 
relieves the fig of its superfluous juices and thus causes it to mature 
is too absurd to be given much thought. The gnawing done by 
th^ wasps is so infinitely small that the fig, through the combined 
efforts of 20 wasps, would not lose one ordinary drop of sap. Figs 
wounded by a needle in such a way that many drops of juice escape 
do not show any tendency to set better, as I have repeatedly demon- 
strated. The gnawing of a few wasps can, therefore, not have any 
effect on the receptacle of the fig. The pollination alone can account 
for the maturing of such figs as require caprification. Thus, ofallthe 
figs which we have tried in California, some fifty or more varieties, only 
some seven or eight kinds do not set their fruit; all others do. To 



CAPRIFICATION OF THE FIG. 115 

caprificate the regular and common kind of edible figs would, there- 
fore, be a useless waste of time and work. They would probably pro- 
duce some fertile seeds, but it is doubtful if their quantity would be 
sufficient to greatly improve the fig. It has been said that the Blas- 
tophaga produces a gall in the edible figs, and that this gall formation 
would cause the figs to set and mature, in the same way as a worm- 
eaten pear or apple ripens sooner than the uninjured fruit. But we 
have already seen that no such gall is produced in edible figs, and 
experiments in Italj'^ have almost conclusively demonstrated that the 
entrance of the wasps does not hasten the maturity of the common fig. 
We may, therefore, with a fair degree of certainty, establish the 
following facts: 

1. The visit of the wasps to the female flowers of the Smyrna figs is 
powerless to produce fertility or maturity, except when accompanied 
by pollination. 

2. The gnawing of the wasps on the scales of the eye, or the mere 
irritation of the flowers, does not produce a flow of sap sufficient to 
stimulate the fig to set and mature. 

THE KPFE0T8 OF CAPRIPICATION. 

Caprification can, therefore, only be effective and profitable in 
varieties which contain a majority of developed female flowers. If 
such figs are not caprificated, they will drop off shortly after the 
receptivity of the female flowers is past. On such figs the immediate 
effect of caprification is, first, the setting and the coming to full 
maturity of the fig receptacle (the fig) ; second, the development and 
maturity of the female flowers and their ovaries and seeds. Another 
important effect of caprification is the dropping at full maturity of 
caprificated figs, or rather of figs in which caprification has been suc- 
cessful. All Smyrna figs drop of themselves when ripe, while all 
other fig varieties in which caprification is not an absolute necessity, 
must be cut or pulled from the tree at harvest time, as they will fall 
only when past their prime. The advantage of having figs requiring 
caprification is, therefore, evident in all districts where such figs will 
grow. 

The expense of caprification is much smaller and requires less 
labor than the pulling or cutting off of the figs when ripe; provided, of 
course, that the figs would set without being caprificated, which they 
will not do. 

Besides the pomological or horticultural maturity of the receptacle 
the caprification produces the botanical maturity of the female flowers, 
which, as we will see, is of great importance as determining the 
quality of the fig. 

THE IMPORTANCE OF SEEDS IN DRIED FIGS. 

The greater value of caprificated varieties over those which do not 
require the process is to be sought in the development of fertile seed. 



116 THE fig: its history, culture, and curing. 

The seeds in onr common figs consist only of empty, glossy shells, 
with no trace of kernel. All such seeds have no taste and can in no 
way contribute to tlie flavor of the dried fig. Not so, however, with 
Smyrna figs which have been caprificated. They all contain seed of 
large size, with a full, oily kernel, which, when crushed, is found to 
be in the highest degree aromatic and *' nutty." Such seed, when 
present in sufficient quantity, greatly contribute to the quality of the 
figs, giving them an intensely aromatic flavor. It is only during the 
process of drying that the aromatic taste of the seed is permeated 
through the pulp of the fig, in very much the same manner as almonds 
and other nuts communicate their flavors to puddings, preserves, or 
canned fruits generally. Smyrna figs when dried are therefore more 
highly flavored than any oth^r figs. To the fresh f\g the seeds do not 
communicate this aroma, and fresh caprificated figs are therefore not 
superior to other fresh figs; at least the caprification does not produce 
the superiority, if there is one.^ 

WHICH FIGS SHOULD BE CAPRIFICATED? 

The shortest answer to this question is, all figs which drop off if not 
caprificated. It has not yet been fully ascertained which these figs 
are. It is only certain that the great majority of figs will mature their 
receptacles without caprification. In California • we have, however, 
for some ten years had growing several varieties imported from 
Smyrna, and of these none perfected fruit until they were artificially 
pollinated. This class, then, requires pollination and caprification, 
and must be caprificated if fruit is to be expected. We have also had 
other figs in California which have never matured fruit, though 20 
years old. 

Another class of figs requires caprification for the second crop. 
Among such varieties San Pedro is the most prominent one. But 
there are other varieties like the white San Pedro, the Portuguese 
of Italy, the Gentile, etc., all of which set their first crop, but drop 
their second crop^ Microscopic examination shows that the second 
crop of these figs possesses fully developed female flowers, while the 
first crop which matures has only flowers with abortive ovaries. In 
another place in this paper I have related my experiments in capri- 
ficating the second crop of San Pedro and Gentile and the success 
achieved, undoubtedly proving that caprification is necessary for a 
certain crop while it is not necessary for another crop. Another 
class or type of figs which requires caprification for one of its crops is 
the one to which the Adriatic fig belongs. This class drop^ its first 



^I was the first one to call attention to the value of the fig seed as a source of 
aroma and flavor in dried figs. This is now almost everywhere accepted as true 
and as being one of the chief causes of the superiority of the Smyrna fig over non- 
caprificated figs. Leclerc was the first one to point out the superiority of caprifi- 
cated figs, in Algiers, but he does not mention the cause (p. 332),

crop if it is not caprificated. The second crop is always set and 
matured without caprification. 

WHERE CAPRIFICATION IS PRACTICED. 

Nowhere is caprification practiced more thoroughly, more constantly, 
and more successfully than in the home of the fig— Syria and Asia 
Minor. In the vicinity of Smyrna, the foremost fig region of the 
world, the figs of which are acknowledged superior to any grown else- 
where, caprification is a necessity. The fig crop without it would 
fail — at least the crops from all varieties which produce the Smyrna 
figs of commerce. The fact that some figs may be produced without 
caprification even there, must be attributed to the same cause which 
produces some fertile seed in the Italian figs without direct fertiliza- 
tion by caprification. The real cause of the setting of figs in either 
case is the presence of caprifigs in the vicinity, from which the wasps 
carry the pollen irregularly and sparingly, but sufficiently to produce 
a few figs and a few seed. The importance of caprifigs in Syria and 
Smyrna is so great that they often command a higher price than the 
edible figs, and in cases of failure of the caprifig crop sailing vessels 
• are sent to distant ports, to the Grecian islands, to bring whole cargoes 
of the fruit. This bringing of cargoes of caprifigs, at great expense, 
by intelligent growers, must point to the value of caprification there, 
and is in glaring contrast with the occasional practice of some ignorant 
cultivators in Greece and Italy, who, failing to procure caprifigs, sus- 
pended galls of elm trees among their figs. As the culture of figs 
followed the immigration of the Phtenicians, and later on that of the 
Arabs, so do we to this day find caprification practiced in aU countries 
formerly occupied by those nations — that is along the north coast of 
Africa, in Algiers and Morocco, in the islands of tke Mediterranean, 
Cyprus, Crete, Sicily, and the Malta group, and farther west, in the 
southern parts of Spain and Portugal. 

To this day caprifigs are highly valued and bring a high price in 
Tripoli, Tunis, Algiers, and Morocco, and parts of the Iberian Pen- 
insula, especially when the crop is scarce. Leclerc tells us that in 
Algiers the profichi of the caprifig bring 2 sous per dozen (not quite 
a half cent). They are regular merchandise in all these markets. 

In Greece caprification has been in vogue since very ancient times, 
as has been mentioned elsewhere. From that country it spread to 
southern Italy first after the time of Pliny, and has there been prac- 
ticed ever since, principally in the territory of the old kingdom of 
Naples or in southern Italy generally. 

To the general rule that caprification is practiced in Greece and 
Grecian colonies, one exception is mentioned by Solms-Laubach. In 
Marseille (Provence) and vicinity caprification is not practiced. It is 
also not practiced in central and northern Italy, or in the territories 
occupied anciently by the old Umbrians, Etrurians, and Latins, nor is 



118 THE fig: its history, culture, and curing. 

it practiced anywhere in southern France and the Riviera. Solms- 
Laubach declares two causes for this to be possible. Either in ancient 
times caprification was practiced even there, and later on abandoned, 
or it was never introduced, fig culture having been only lately brought 
to these regions, and at a time when caprification was no longer nec- 
essary, varieties in the meantime having appeared which would ripen 
their receptacles without it. But as from the descriptions of Pliny 
and Cato it becomes evident that caprification was not known in Italy 
in their time, it is almost certain that in countries where caprifica- 
tion is not now practiced it has never been introduced. This is the 
case in all fig districts of America, as neither in the Southern States, 
in California, nor in Brazil, Argentina, Peru, or Chile, had caprifi- 
cation ever been even advocated until within the last ten years, or 
after the late introduction of the real Smyrna figs from Smyrna. 
This has also been the case in Australia and New Zealand. It is 
probable that to countries within easy reach of Syria the first varie- 
ties introduced were those requiring caprification; later only the self- 
ripening kinds followed, or were originated on the spot. The kinds 
which require caprification are much more exacting of climate, soils, 
and conditions generally than the self-ripening kinds, as we know 
that Smyrna figs, if transplanted to less favored localities, lose their 
superior qualities, even if caj)rified. As the self-ripening kinds 
became more common and more widely distributed the Smyrna varie- 
ties were allowed to gradually die out, but the caprification had taken 
such hold and had become so deeply rooted that it continued to be 
practiced on varieties which did not require it. 

The circumstance, again, that caprification was not introduced into 
the more northern provinces, such as north Italy, south France, 
and north of Spain, must be sought in the unsuitability of those 
places for those varieties which required caprification. It is more 
than probable that in the above countries fig culture never assumed 
any degree of development until the advent of figs which did not 
require caprification in order to bear. The variety of caprifig which 
carries its mamme over winter is more susceptible to frost than other 
figs. At least it is impossible for the fig wasps to survive in countries 
where the caprifig crops are interrupted by heavy winter or spring 
frosts. This would also make caprification impossible, unless the 
caprifigs were yearly imported from more favored districts — a pro- 
ceeding that would not prove practical or remunerative. 

CAN OTHER INSECTS BE SUBSTITUTED FOR THE BLASTOPHAGA? 

It is well known that figs are visited by numerous insects other than 
the regular Blastophaga, and the question arises to what degree 
could they be depended upon to carry the pollen from the caprifig to 
the edible fig, or could they do so at all. Some entomologists not 
acquainted with the practical side of the question have claimed that 



CAPRIFICATION OF THE FIG. 119 

the Blastophaga was not required, but that any insect would do the 
work. In order to carry the pollen from one fig to another it is by no 
means necessary that the insect should breed in the fig. All it has 
to do is to crawl into the caprifig at the proper time and then crawl 
out and into the edible fig, and the pollination is accomplished; 
but in order that any practical result to the crop at large may come 
from this visit, several circumstances are imperatively necessary, and 
must coincide. The insects must make these visits at the proper 
time; they must be of proper size to be able to enter the closed eye 
of the fig; they must be present in sufficiently large number to pol- 
linate the fig crop, not single figs. As to the first point it will be 
seen that no other insect has been found which will have any busi- 
ness in the caprifig at the time when required ; and even if the pollen 
of the caprifig would serve as its food, it would have no cause to 
afterwards visit the edible fig, which at the period when such visit is 
required does not produce any food, it being green and hard, with no 
trace of sugar. Insects only visit flowers in search of food or to lay 
their eggs. No other insect than the Blastophaga has been found to 
do the latter properly and at the time when required. The i^econd 
point is readily understood. The eye of the edible fig is closed, and 
only an insect with a peculiarly developed instinct would know how 
to push its way between the closed scales. At this stage of the 
development of the fig no insects have been found which visit the 
figs, except the Blastophaga and some parasitical wasps which prey 
on her brood, and which would not enter the fig unless they knew 
the Blastophagas were already there. The most important point, 
however, is the quantity of insects required at a given time. Only 
an insect which will actually breed ,in the caprifig can be depended 
on, and it must breed in countless numbers. A' few visitors would 
have no practical influence on the tig crops. They may fertilize or 
pollinate a few flowers, but they would be of no practical value to the 
grower and would not produce a crop. Taking it all in all no insect 
has been known, and no one is likely to ever be known, that can be 
substituted for the Blastophaga grossorum, 

DIFFERENT SPECIES OF BLASTOPHAGA IN DIFFERENT SPECIES OF FIGS. 

As far as is known, different species of figs are, as a rule, inhabited 
by distinct and characteristic species of inquilines. Thus Blasto- 
phaga grossorum has been found in only one or two nearly related 
fig species, and no other Blastophaga species has been found in our 
caprifigs. Parasitical wasps are always found together with the Blas- 
tophagas, preying on and developing in them just as the Blastophaga 
preys on and develops in the embryo of the fig. Even when differ- 
ent fig species grow close together do the wasps keep to their respec- 
tive fig hosts; accidentally the wasps may visit other figs, but they 
do not breed in them. It appears almost certain that every fig 
23740— No. 9—01 9 



120 THE fig: its HI8TORT, CULTURE, AND CURING. 

species is inhabited by Blastophagas. Thas, in the botanical garden 
of Java, a row of fig trees, consisting of five different species of figs, 
was found to be inhabited by as many different species of Blasto- 
phaga, each variety in its own fig host, to which it was strictly con- 
fined. The cause of this localization of species must be sought in 
the organization of the wasps and their ovipository organs, which 
enable the insect to deposit its eggs in a certain kind of flower only, 
which again has been changed so as to accommodate the peculiarities 
of the wasp, her size and capabilities. Under such circumstances 
there is no hope that, for instance, the wasp inhabiting the Baja Cali- 
fornia and Sonoi'a fig species can be made to inhabit and breed in our 
caprifigs. Even the sycamore fig is inhabited by its species of inqui- 
lines, but which have never been found in the caprifigs. It may, 
therefore, be assumed with great certainty that only closely allied fig 
species are inhabited by the same species of Blastophagas. But in 
many species of figs we find more than one species of Blastophaga. 
Some figs are inhabited not only by different species, but also by 
different genera of true Blastophaga, while the latter again are 
preyed on by parasitical wasps often equal to them in size. 

SUMMARY. 

Caprification, then, is an horticultural process, based on scientific 
principles. It has been practiced since very ancient times, and is yet 
in vogue in many countries. It is an absolute necessity in places 
where Smyrna figs are grown, or in places where it is of importance to 
pollinate such figs as possess receptive female flowers. Caprification 
causes such figs to set and mature when otherwise they would fall off 
immature. This horticultural maturity is caused by and preceded by 
the botanical maturity of the female flowers. Again, caprification is 
not required for that great class of figs which sets and ripens fruit 
without it, unless, indeed, it should be found practical, profitable, 
and possible to produce seed in such varieties of this class as possess 
^* receptive female flowers in sufficient number. Caprification is neces- 
'^ sary also for such caprifigs as do not produce overlapping crops. 

HISTORICAL NOTES ON CAPRIFICATION. 

V" ^;>' v^ There are very good reasons for supposing that caprification is as 

^y'^ y old as the cultivation of the fig by man. That it originated in some 

of the oldest agricultural countries is much more probable than that 
the practice is of comparatively modem origin — for instance, invented 
by the Greeks during the time intervening between the Homeric songs 
and the era of Alexander. For this belief speaks the fact that the 
caprifig is probably not a native of Greece nor of any other Mediterra- 
nean country, but of southern Arabia, and possibly also of other 
, countries in the vicinity of the Red Sea and the Persian Gulf. The fig 






\ 



CAPRIFICATION OF THE FIG. 121 

. was introduced into Greece, as has already been shown, and whether 
. we presume that the first introduced fig race required caprification or 
not, it follows that this caprification was not and could not have been 
invented in Greece nor in any other country where the caprifig was 
not originally wild, and wild at the time the first figs requiring caprifi- 
cation were grown under cultivation. K the self-setting fig race had 
been the one first introduced into Greece, then the Greeks would 
' • never have thought of caprification, or if some uncommon genius had 

done so, he would have been obliged to go to distant countries in order 
to see, find, and bring home the caprifig, of which he could otherwise 
have had no possible knowledge. The discovery of caprification in 
Greece, as has been held by the majority of investigators except 
Solms-Laubach, would be as improbable and as impossible as the dis- 
covery of the placer mining of gold in a country where native gold 
occurs only in solid veins of ore. 

Caprification must have originated in a country where the caprifig 
was wild. But particulars about the discovery are not forthcoming, 
^ the records having been forever lost. Even in the oldest books of the 
^y- Semitic races no mention is made of any process which can with Any 
/ j^y certainty be explained as referring to caprification. As is stated else- 
^'^'^ where, in the Book of Amos we read of "bdtes schiqmim," which 
^ \;''^^-^4nean8 "one who operates on the wild fig." But if this operation 
^X^ refers to caprification, or to the oiling of the fig, or to the yet com- 
^/ mon and necessary practice of cutting the ** sycamore figs" with a 
knife in order to give an opportunity to their inquilines to escape, 
will always remain an uncertainty, with some probability that the last 
explanation is the correct one. A circumstance which makes it prob- 
able that caprification wa.s^ in very a.^fiiftTit timfts^ practiced in Asia 
is the fact that Syria is yet the country which grows principally or 
* almost exclusivel y figs requ iring caprification in order to set and 

mature. In nearly all other countries olHer, though inferior, varieties 
have been or are being substituted — varieties which mature without 
' Ari^^*Pollination and caprification. 



^C^ For the oldest written record of caprification we must go to the 

-^^L oldest Greek writers. Aristotle, the teacher of Alexander, and the 

^' ^\^^^^,>Best-informed scholar of ancient tiihes, describes caprification in very 

qO^much the same way as it is pr^r^fi^AAfi f.n thia flay Aristotle explains 

tjie effects of caprification through the bite of the wasp, which causes 

^^^y'^YkQ air to enter the fig, etc. He, as well as all writers for a period of 

two thousand years, or until the time of Linnaeus, were unable to give 

a true explanation of the effects of caprification. 

^v^ The most minute description of caprification as practiced and under- 

K^ stood by the ancients is given by Theoph rast. Not only does he cor- 

-^ rectly describe the process of caprification, but he informs us of 

^^rv>^ certain facts of^^reat interest. One of these is that there are two 

n - ^ ^ races of figs, one which requires caprification in order to set fruit, and 

- <^A ^ 

9-^ 



122 THE fig: its history, culture, and curing. 

one which sets fruit without caprification. Theophrast was the first 
one to point this out, and he must have learned it through observa- 
tion of the various fig varieties grown in his time. Another statement 
made by this writer is to the effect that caprificated figs had a lesser 
commercial value than figs not thus caprificated. Whatever may 
have been the case at this time, it is not so now. If Theophrast's 
statement is correct it can be explained by the fact of the Smyrna 
tribe not thriving in Greece or by their unimproved state at that 
time. 

Theophrast also mentions how ignorant cultivators, instead of using 
caprifig, suspended other substances in the trees, such as galls from 
elm trees, the peasant believing that the wasps emerging from these 
elm galls would have the same effect as fig wasps. Of course, if the fig 
tree in which they were suspended belonged to a race which did require 
caprification, the effect of either variety of wasps (or of any other 
foreign substance) would be the same or none. Theophrast's explana- 
tion of the effects of caprification is similar to that given by Aristotle. 
He rejects the theory that the wasps close the eye of the fig and, 
through the prevention of the entrance of the air, cause maturity. 
On the contrary, he maintains that the wasps enlarge the eye of the 
fig, causing its juices to flow, suck up the superfluous "humors" of the 
fig, and that the warm and fermentation-producing air then effects the 
maturing of the figs. The differences between the two races of figs, 
of which one requires caprification and the other not, is explained by 
this author through the influence of soil and climate, as well as by a 
different nature of the fig, which enables it to ripen its fruit without 
the aid of the wasp. The circumstance that in Italy no caprification 
was practiced at his time he explains by the supposed drier soil and 
climate of that country, which absorbs the superfluous juices of the 
fig. The humid climate of Greece, he contends, makes it necessary 
^^ to employ the aid of the wasps in order to relieve the figs of their 
^A^v » superfluous moisture. 

>i f^ Pliny, the great Roman naturalist and compiler, follows Theophrast 

^ ^closely. He classes the caprifig as the wild fig, wanting in the juices 
x>^ ^ * necessary for the food of the wasps. The latter, not finding the 
^ ' necessary food, fly to the edible flg, and through nibbling enlarge 
^ , the mouth of the fig and allow the fertilizing air to enter, which again 

transforms the i#llky juices of the fig to sweet honey. Pliny believed 
that caprification was practiced only in the Archipelago, from which 
it was later introduced into Italy. At the time of Pliny caprification 
was unknown in Italy. The account given by the great Latin natu- 
ralist is evidently only a compilation from other authors and from 
hearsay. He appears not to have made any personal investigations 
or examinations. 

Through all the mediaeval ages, or for over fifteen hundred years 
after Pliny, horticulture and natural science made little progress, and 



CAPEIFICATION OF THE FIG. 123 

the opinions of the ancient writers were adopted as regards almost all 
points of human knowledge. So also their theories about caprifica- 
tion. For fifteen hundred years after Pliny this process was prac- 
ticed by the cultivators of the soil in the same way as in the time of 
ancient Greece; no one was found to inquire into its nature and value, 
much less to solve the enigma of this the most interesting of all hor- 
ticultural usages of all times. 

In 1583 CsBsalpinus discovered the sexual organs of plants and was 
able to point out their functions, but his discovery bore no fruit as 
regards a better understanding of caprification, and all writers after him 
for nearly two hundred years followed the teachings of Theophrast, 
Pliny, and Plutarch. 

In the early part of the eighteenth century two botanists occupied 

themselves with a closer study of the fig. One of them was Giulio 

tj^^c Pontedera, who was the first to describe the flowers of the caprifig 

1^ w ^i^ their structure, though he did not recognize their sexual nature. 



v> >>i^^ ^^ ^^^^ studied the fig wasps and caprification, but little suspected 

^ y^he true nature and influence of the wasp. Pontedera ascribes the 

\^/^ effects of caprification to the biting of the wasps, which caused the air 

/^)^ and light to enter the fig. This is the more remarkable when we con- 

/^^^ sider how very minute are the wounds caused by even many wasps. 

, y^ - As seldom more than very few wasps enter one fig, it will be seen 

' ^ y^ that the extra air that can penetrate on account of the wasp bites is 

^ very small indeed, if any at all. 

Another investigator, one of the most prominent botanists of the^*^' ^ 
early part of the eighteenth century, wa s Tou rnefort. JJ^i'H v wl^d T^^ ^vA^^ 
the Levant and in Greece and made special stuciyST caprification as t\(^\ 

practiced there. Being well acquainted with fig culture in Provence, ^ I 

in France, he was well qualified for his time to take up the study of 1 1 C -*• p' 
cagrification. Tournefort had studied "fbeophrast and tried to explain % r^ " 
his statement about the lesser value of the caprificated figs, through thoi*-'-**^ 
necessity of drying such caprificateSTTgsTir ovens, which caused 
their aroma to disappear. As Solms-Laubach points out, Tournefort ^ ^ V^'^ L 
confounded the wasps with moths which infest dried figs, just as is so \\^^ 
frequently done in our day. Tournefort describes the three crops of 
caprifig and mentions the two races of edible figs, of which one requires 
caprification, while the other will set fruit without it. The effects of 
» caprification he explains in the same way as everyoite before him, by 

the biting of the wasps, which causes the superfluous juices to escape. 
Finally ,'Tie mentions^that a fig which in Provence without caprifica- 
tion produces 25 pounds of figs, in the island of Zea gives 200 pounds — 
a very unsatisfactory statement when we consider the distance of the 
two localities and the uncertainty that the two trees were actually 
of the same variety, not to speak of climate, soil, age, cultivation, etc. 
It was reserved for Linnaeus to discover the true nature of caprifi- 
cation. While previous to his time the nature of the sexes in flowers 



124 THE fig: its history, culture, and curing. 

had been described and generally accepted, no one had thought of 
the possibility of an insect transmitting the pollen from one flower to 
another and thus causing fecundation. As Pliny of old had foreshad- 
owed the theory of evolution, so did LinnsBus a century before its 
rediscovery indicate how, at least in one instance, flowers were depend- 
ent on insects for their pollination. LinnsBUS points out how, in order 
that the female flowers of the fig may be properly fecundated, it 
becomes absolutely necessary for the pollen of the anthers to be dis- 
tributed through the cavity of the fig. And this could not be accom- 
plished if nature had not supplied the fig with a wasp which could 
carry the pollen from the male flowers to the female tree. And this 
wasp, he says, is the "psen" of the ancients,' or the fig insect. The 
opinion of Linnseus was published in 1749. But LinnsBus was not 
aware of the fact that some figs rii)ened their fruit without fecunda- 
tion; want of material for investigation caused him to think that the 
fig was absolutely dioecious — in other words, that it possessed sexes 
distinctly separate, but on different trees. 

John Hill, again, who published his great work, "A History of 
Plants," in London, 1751, refers only briefly to the fig and its caprifica- 
tion. He condemns Toumef ort's theory of puncture and irritation, and 
states that pollination is the real effect of caprification; but he does not 
refer to Linnaeus, though it is probable that he must have heard of 
the latter's views upon the subject. 

Later in the century both Milne and Cavolini, independently of 
each other, discovered that a difference must be made between the 
maturing of the seed and the maturing of the receptacle, and that 
the former maturity, at least, must require pollination, even if the 
latter (or pomolOgical maturity) could be accomplished without it. 
Milne clearly defines this by saying: 

The qnestion supposes that the fig trees in this country bring frnit to maturity 
without assistance of caprification, and the fact can not be denied. The same 
thing, we have seen, obtains in Spain, Provence, and Malta: but the fruit, or more 
properly, the fruit vessel, is in all cases to be distinguished from the seed contained 
within it. If the male be wanting, the seed will not vegetate when sown; but the 
fruit may, nevertheless, swell and come to an appearance of perfection; and so it 
is observed to do in the instance in question, and in many others, especially when 
the fruit is formed of one of the parts less connected with seed, as the calyx, 
receptacle, etc. 

Filippo Cavolini published his work on caprification in 1782, or 
twelve years later than Milne, whose opinion he had, however, not 
read. Cavolini believes the caprifig to be the male tree and the fig 
the female of the same species. He further notes the difference 
between the fig receptacle and the seed, and how the former can 
come to maturity on account of its stronger attachment to the stem of 
the tree, while the seed, which is only attached to the pericarp by its 
vessels, requires pollination in order to mature. This pollination 
causes the juices in the fig to flow more freely, bringing both the 



OAPRIFICATION OF THE FIG. 125 

seed and receptacle to maturity. That some fif?s mature their recep- 
tacles and other.^; do not depends on a defective structure, bj^ which the 
juices from the stem of the tree are more or less obstructed in their 
flow into the fig's receptacle. As this obstruction is less or greater 
the fig requires more or less pollination to cause more or less sap to 
flow, while the seed, in order to attain maturity, always requires polli- 
nation. That the same variety of fig can mature in one locality 
without caprification, while in a different district it must be caprifl- 
cated in order to mature its receptacle, depends upon differences in 
locality and soil. Cavolini's ideas are clearly expressed and to the 
point. 

At the very end of the century a French botanist, Olivier, traveled 
in the Ottoman Empire, Egypt, Persia, and Greece, making a par- 
ticular study of the fig. His descriptive work of his travels was 
published in Paris (year 9). Olivier came to the conclusion that 
caprification was a useless and ignorant proceeding, which should be 
abandoned. He says: 

This operation, of which some anthors, both ancient and modern, have spoVen 
with adiuiration, appeared to me to be nothing else than a tribute which man 
pays to Ignorance and prejudice. Caprification is nnknown in many parts of the 
Levant, in Italy, in France, and in Spain, and begins 10 be abandoned in t le Archi- 
pelago, where it used to be practiced, and which, nevertheless, still produce excel- 
lent figs for eating. If the operation was necessary, whether fecnndation be 
effected by the fertilizing polleu dispersed in the air introducing itself into the 
mouth of the tig, or whether nature makes use of a little fly to transmit it from 
one fig to another, as is commonly believed, it is evident that the first fig in flower 
conld not fecundate at the same time those that have already attained a certain 
size and those which are only just appearing in order to ripen two months later. 

The knowledge which Olivier possessed of caprification was in 
reality most superficial and defective, and some of his statements are 
even false and misleading and not worthy of quotation, except for 
the fact that disbelievers in caprification have pointed to him as an 
eminent botanist, who had conclusively proved the delusiveness of 
the process in question. Olivier did not even know that it was the 
caprifig which was used for caprification, but stated that it was the 
common "figues fleurs," the brebas, or first-crop edible figs, which 
were hung on the. trees. This also appears again in the last lines of 
his statement quoted above, beginning: ** First fig in flower," etc. 
His statement that caprification was unknown in Italy and Spain is 
also incorrect. 

In 1820 Giorgio Gallesio, a prominent' Italian horticulturist, pub- 
lished his treatise on the fig. How far Gallesio's statements were based 
on investigations in nature are not known. Later writers on figs have 
endeavored to show that his theories were founded principally on 
book learning, and not on observation. I am not of that opinion, as 
his statements show a frankness and fairness entirely indicative of 
truthfulness. Gallesio holds that there are two races of figs — one 




126 THE fig: its history, culture, and curing. 

which requires caprification in order to mature its fruit, and one 
which matures without the aid of this operation . The different require- 
ments between the two fig races depend upon a difference in con- 
struction of the figs, and each race retains its characteristics, regard- 
less of the influences of soil and climate. The difference in construc- 
tion lies in the ovary of the fig. Some figs have ovaries without 
ovules, and those figs which can not be fertilized can also not feel 
the action of the pollen from the caprifig. These are the mule figs. 
The other class of figs, with perfect ovules, are sensitive to the pollen, 
and under its infiuence develop perfect seeds. These he calls semi- 
mules. The fecundation Causes the juices to flow to the fig and 
effect its maturity. The caprifig alone containing the pollen is, 
therefore, necessary, and the only way to apply it is through 
caprification. 

Gallesio also describes a caprifig with only female flowers — "the 
fico semi-mula." His statement that the original wild caprifig bore 
only one crop of figs is shown by Solms-Laubach to be erroneous, or 
at least very improbable. 
^^ *" In the middle of our century the Italian botanist Guglie lmo Ga s- 
parrini published a series of four different treatises upon figs and 
Q Jt caprification, extending in time from 1845 to 1862. No one has con- 
'^'^ / tributed so much to our knowledge of caprification as Gasparrini, and 
\ /\ dss ^^ ^^^ ^^^ made as many original researches as he has. Gas- 
y ^^^ ^ parrini, as Olivier before him, takes a decided stand against caprifi- 
C/^ *tx c^^i^^j believing himself warranted in so doing by the result of the 
V^'* w^'^experiments made by himself. Gasparrini's experiments have been 
u >^^ by many considered conclusive and almost final, and his views 
V vV"^^ V have been adopted almost unchanged by later writers on the subject of 
caprification. While conceding that Gasparrini's experiments were 
scientific and^ fairly carefully made, and highly interesting and demon- 
V^ strati ve, I hold that the main conclusion_whicJi ha drew was singu- 
> ^ ^ it ^ larly illogical, though it may have been warranted by the insufficiency 
^ ^ y^ of his experiments. Gasparrini's almost only, but fatal, error was 
that he experimented only on a few Italian figs, not even suspecting 
that there might be other figs differently constructed. From his 
observation he concluded that because *'a few were so," therefore, 
" all must be so." Gasparrini's experiments are too elaborate to be 
here noticed in detail. Those who wish to further study the subject 
are referred to his respective works. A summary of his theories, 
experiments, and conclusions is found in Biological Studies on Figs, 
Caprifigs, and Caprification. A very short resume must suffice here. 
Gasparrini concluded that the caprifig belongs to a different species 
from the cultivated fig; that the Blastophaga is not necessary for 
pollination; that caprification is useless and injurious and should be 
abolished. 

It is not intended to condemn Gasparrini's work, which, though 
believed by many to have been somewhat defective, has still proven

of much interest and value. His experiments have shown us that 
caprifieation does not hasten the maturity of the common fig, and 
that it is not the sting itself of the wasp which influences the set- 
ting of the fruit of the edible fig. They also show that niany figs 
which are regularly caprificated by the fig growers require no cap- 
rifieation, and that, as far as these figs are concerned, caprifieation 
could be abandoned. This point is confirmed by the circumstance 
that these same figs mature in countries where no caprifigs are grown. 

It is not easy to see how any other conclusions of importance can 
be drawn from the experiments of Gasparrini. It must always be 
regretted that he never thought of the possibility of there being any 
other race of figs than that one which he happened to have under his^ ( 
eye. How different, for instance, would his conclusions have been if7> ^ l*^ 
he had had the true Smyrna figs to experiment on ! i /^ { t't^ ' • ' 

In our own times no one has given as much study to the fig ^\^'^' na^ny ^ • 
tion as Prof. H. Count Solms-Laubach. His researches were pub- y j ( 
lished in 1882, and contain a perfect mine of knowledge, partly)''^ ^ 
compiled, partly his own investigations. While scientifically investi-j^ c / ? . 
gating his subject and studying the figs and the fig insects in Italy,y / 
Java, and France, it appears that he had no opportunity to make "_ 1 — 
direct experiments in caprifieation, but founded his opinions princi- a y 
pally on the experiments of Gasparrini. He sifts the knowledge of ^"^^ V 
others with rare ability and patience, and adds numerous and inter- ^ 5 
eating observations of his own. His researches are of the utmost y ^ ^ 
importance. As a botanist he rejects, as insufftciently proven. Gas- *" - ' 
parrini's theory of parthenogenesis, and, showing that Brazilian figs •' 
produce no fertile seed, concludes that caprifieation is necessary for ^ , 
that purpose. ' ^ / | 

During his investigations in Java he discovered that most figs ^ '^ 
growing there consisted of female trees as well as of male trees, and / 
he found that the male tree possessed a flower especially adapted to I . 
foster the Blastophaga, a kind of degenerated or differentiated female .. .-— r- 
flower, which he calls the *'gall flower." This gall flower has prob-/» . ^ 
ably lost its power to produce seed. Returning home and investigat-^ 
ing the caprifig, he found that even this fig contained this gall flower, ' 

almost exclusive of any real female flower. He further shows how .^ ' 
different species of figs are inhabited by different species of Blasto- 
phaga. He also unconditionally adheres to the theory of tl\ej3aprifig 
and the fig being of the same-Jspecies. Later on he adopts the^EKeory 
of Fr. Mtiller, that the edible fig is the female plant and the caprifig 
the male plant. But he was entirely unaware of the existence of a race 
orngs'constructed differently from the common edible figs which he 
had investigated, and he shared the opinion of Gasparrini that all 
figs were affected by caprifieation in the same manner, though he 
recognized the absolute necessity of pollination and caprifieation in 
order chat fertile seeds may be produced. But if caprifieation is not 
needed any more, it was once a necessity, ages ago, when the fig was

first brought into cultivation by man, and before the present race of 

figs, which requires no caprification in order' to set and mature, had 

^ 1 Hf originated. The class of figs which the Italians considered as requir- 

i V ing caprification had been shown to set fruit without this operation; 

] , ^the class that once required caprification must, therefore, have been 

j^ A < / f lost, and been superseded by a better, more modern class, evolved 

• , "'. ^ from the former. He comes to the following conclusion : 

r ,-. ' Caprification was once, ages ago, a necessity; it is now no more useful, but only 

i^ ' * I /■ & horticu ltural oper ation, transmitted fro m gener a t ion to generation, down to our 

j ^-^ '/ ' time, and in its origThal form." Its scientific importance as means for judging the 

\ modifications undergone by our economic plants (culturpflanzen) in the course of 

' '^^ ' ages can hardly be overestimated. 

It is hardly necessary for me to remark that Solms-Laubach's con- 
clusions were based on his belief that this race, once requiring capri- 
fication, Has been lost, has "died out,'* as no longer of value. Now, 
if this race has not died out, but can be proven to be yet extant and 
to constitute our best figs, the conclusion arrived at by Solms-Laubach 
must fall. Professor Solms-Laubach has since acknowledged the 
correctness of this. 

^: A late contribution from the author's knowledge of caprification is 
^ i found in his Biological Studies of Figs, Caprifigs, and Caprification, 
'. ^ ^ ^already referred to several times. These experiments were conducted 
* ,^^ , in various places in Calif ornia, and have, in the author's judgment, 
' / jepnclusively proven that caprification is a process of pollinati on by 
^'^'^ the aid of wasps; that it is a necessity in order to cause the Smyrna 
figs to bear f" that the first crop of San Pedro figs does not require 
^ , ',* ; . '-^ caprHTcaTIoh, while the second crop oTtEis tribe of figs will not set and 
J ^ mature fruit without it. The writer has also shown that there is a 
. ' ^ f fourth kind of flower in the fig — the mule flower. He has also pointed 
out for the first time that we possess five distinct tribes of edib le figs, 
' V '^ the nature of which he has described, and has endeavored"To trace 
A^^ phylogenetic origin, showing that while the Smyrna figs have 
jcjescended from the female caprifig tree the other trlFes" may^~have 
^' descended from the male caprifig tree. From the nature of the seed- 
. ' lings grown from imported and caprificated Smyrna seeds he has also 
^.>^''" demonstrated that caprification is a process of pollinationjind not one 
of irritation, as has been supposed^TTy the majority of investigators 
since the time of Aristotle. The latest as well as the best work on 
caprification, however, is from the pen of Dr. L. O. Howard, of the 
United States Department of Agriculture. Dr. Howard is the only 
^entomologist who has attacked this difficult subject with a thorough 
knowledge of insect life and its relationship to plants. As a conse- 
quence little in the life history of the Blastophaga now remains to be 
elucidated,jand the reader who wishes a more detailed account of this 
subject is referred to Dr. Howard's work published in the Yearbook 
of the Department of Agriculture for 1900. It was published too late 
to be quoted in this paper. 









CHAPTER V. 
CLIKATIC CONDITIONS. 

GENERAL REMARKS. 

The climatic conditions under whicli the cultivated fig will thrive 
and bear fruit a re less I'estrict ed than those which favor or disfavor 
many other fruits. What other fruit can be grown out-of-doors with 
moderate success through a district ranging from the south ofScot^ 
land to the Cape of Good Hope, from the shores of_the.. Atlantic 
through Europe, and Asia to China, from Chile^JflUCalifornia and 
Oregon, and on the eastern "COast"^as far north as Washington? 
Nevertheless, there are, necessarily, cer tain conditions which are par- 
ticul arly favorable to the cultivation of the fig. Unfortunately, the 
information at hand is very unsatisfactory, as the countries where 
fig culture has been most successful are those where the horticulturist 
has not found it necessary to invoke the aid of the scientist in securing 
good results. Aside from our own personal experiences, almost the 
only sources of information are consular reports and works of travel 
by northern tourists and explorers; 'but they seldom contain the 
information desired. 

The warm, temp erate climate of the Mediterranean region is the 
most favorable to the varieties of the fig that are useful for both dry- 
ing and eating fresh. Even in this region some parts are much more 
favorable than others, and we look upon Smyrna^ Si?i]y2 Provence, 
Andalusia, and Algarve as ideal places and climates for the highest 
development of the fig. But even in these localities the areas are 
restricted, and in the study of climates and the search for ideal cli- 
matic conditions comparison must be made with such places as Aidin,_ . ,^ 
Palermo, Draguignan, Solon^ etc., in which the climatic conditions 
inusTbe the standard with which to compare our own. It will be seen < 
that the area of the most perfect fig culture nearly coincides with that ' '' 
of the^ve. Taken as a whole, the olive and the .figihxLve-XLDder the 77*^' ., ^ 
sam e con ditions, but the accommodative powers of the fig are much . , , . ' 
greater than those of the olive; it quickly repairs injuries from frost g' ' \ 



■i.:-. 



and hurricanes and accommodates itself to almost any environment. ^ 

But while the famous figs are grown in less than half a dozen locali- yp/\^.< li 

ties, a first-class olive cult is spread over an' immense Territory and, ^^^ r « » 

remarkably enough, in localities where the finest figs are not found. - 

The two cults, therefore, while agreeing in general, do not coincide in 
details, for the fig, while less exacting as regards climatic conditions 
than the olive, demands peciiTiafitiesIli climate in order to attain per- 
fection, which few localities can supply.

130 THE fig: its history, culture, and curing. 

TEMPERATURE. 

The proper temperature for the fig varies with different varieties. 
While some figs will mature with comparatively little heat, others 
require a ^reat deal, a nd can hardly be given enough. Most excel- 
^ lent figs for the table may be grown where the heat isjnoderate, while 
varieties for dr ying requ ire_much more heat. If we take the figs of 
Smyrna, KaBylia, a nd Algarve as standard dried figs, as we must cer- 
tainly do, then it is safe To~^ay that the temperature in the shade 
V during the drying, or rather during the maturing, of the figs should 
never, or seldom at least, exceed^ 100^j\^_oivaboutJ^^ in the sun.* 
Figs will, however, stand as much heat as the sun can give them, pro- 
vided they are not exposed to the direct rays. However, since the 
best figs for dryingare produced near Smyrna, where the heat seldom 
V ^i reaches over looi_E^-we must conclude that a higher temperature in 
. the^Kade Ts^not desirable. Too strong direct heat and light may 
^ burn or scald tTie^figs,' thus bleaching and hardening the skin on the 
xposed side. Excessive heat during the season when the figs ripen is 
consequently undesirable. 
<' . In studying the eflfect of excess of temperature each variety of the 
'\[ /' > y^ fig must be considered. Some kinds are very hardy, comparing in 
. . ,^ this respect with peaches, and even apricots. The tender southern 
varieties of figs should never l56"^^3rpo5fed to a colder temperature 
ji than 16° F., even if well matured; and if the branches are immature, 
^. •' . 1'8° F. will kill the trees to the ground. A young fig tree^can endure 
nTucFlesstlTaii an old one; consequently, it often Iiappensthat trees 
during the first two or three years after planting are cut to the ground 
and killed by frosts of from .18°J^o 22° F., and very often the variety 
is at once condemned as unsuited to the region. As the trees grow 
older t hey become hardie r, sliow tegs growth, and are jess injure d by 
frost. The first few years are therefore the most important ones, 
during which time the trees should be watched and protected in the 
winter. If brought safely over that period most varieties will be 
found hardy in the valleys of California. The writer has seen young 
Adriatic figs cut down to the soil three years in succession during 
temperatures of 18° F., and the same trees, after having success- 
fully reached four years or over, were not injured by much heavier 
freezing. In the grounds of the Department of Agriculture, Wash- 
ington, D. C, may be seen a real Smyrna fig tree which must have 
grown there a great many years, as it is 12 to 14 feet high and has 
never been protected. Similarly in the streets and yards of Wash- 
ington there are quite a number of seedlings 2 or 3 feet and upward 
in height, which have sprung up from Smyrna fig seed. In order to 
facilitate the proper ripening of the figs it is necessary that the nights 
should be warm or moderately warm. Cold and chilly nights, even 
if the days are warm, will cause the figs to dry or remain hard, with 
little sugar. 





CLIMATIC CONDITIONS. 
RAINFALL AND MOISTURE. 

Few fruit trees enjoy moisture as much as does the fig. In very 
moist or even wet soil the fig tree grows most luxuriantly and attains ' 
a high degree of development; but in such localities the quality of 
the fruit i s inferior^ b eing less sweet, insipid, or even^jcjjening to the 
taste. Differen t varieties require diffe rent degrees of moisture in the 
soil, and in order to produce the best quality of fruit the soil should 
never b e more than m oist, not wet, at least not during the fruiting 
season. In Smyrna the yeaVly rainfall averages 25 inc hes, and this 
must be considered the standard rainfall.rfiquired by or desirable for 
the fig designe d for drying , provided the soil is of such a quality as 
will retain the moisture. With the proper cultivation of a good soil ^^^^' C 'A 
with the above average rainfall, even at the end of ^ fae dry season, M ^i "i^ ^ '>. 
moisture will be found a few .inches below the surface sufficient to^^;J i-^*' 
cause the soil t o cohere when nressed. If drier than this the treeS" ' , .J^, ,. . 
will sufTftr^ both as regards wood and fru it, while if more moist ; 

the figs w ill be infpirior^ The rainfall should be all in the rainy or (R'*-'^. /' 
winter season and none after the figs have begun to mature. A 
shower of rain on j iatur ^ or n early mature figs is very injurious, 
causing the figs to break op.e n, turn spur^.and rot, j,nd the crop may 
be a total loss. Moisture in the air, such as is caused hy^ and follow- 
ing rain and fog, is also injurious to the fruit, although it favors the 
development of the tree. The fig requires a dry, but not too dry, air, 
in order to produce superior fruit. Still, good and very superior fruit is 
grown close to the ocean, but out of reach of fogs. Some of the 
Smyrna figs are grown within the sight of the Mediterranean near 
Ephesns, and the figs of Algarve and Malaga are similarly not far 
from the sea. In California excellent figs are grown around San Fran- 
cisco Bay, though not near to the shore. But fogs are always injurious 
to figs, preventing the development of sugar and injuring the color 
of the skin. Even dew is not desirable, especially when the figs are 
ripening, and no figs should be picked before the dew is thoroughly 
evaporated. 

WINDS. 

Winds are suppose d to favor t he maturing of the figs, provided 
they are dry_and„not too warm. In Smyrna the finest figs are those 
gathered when the dry north wind is blowing. The fig can hardly be 
injured by ordinary heavy winds, as there are few trees which grow 
as evenly balanced as the fig. This fact makes the fig especially suit- 
able for wind-breaks during the summer months, while its deciduous 
character unsuits it for this purpose in the winter.

IDEAL CLIMATIC CONDITIONS FOR FIGS. 



Summarizing the general climatic conditions favorable for the most 
perfect development of the fig, we have the following: 

(1) Two seasons, one rainy and one dry, the latter during the warm 




132

,A ^*-'!3 



season of the year. The more distinct these seasons the better, 
showers during the ripening season being very injurious. 

(2) Warm, dr y win ds during the ripening of the figs, accompanied 
by sunshliie and absence of clouds and fog; the temperature in the 
shade not reg ularly tQ^exceed^ 100° F. 

{3) During the winter the thermometer should not faH bekrwlS^JP. 

(4) Natural rainfall of not less than j 5 inch es, confined to the 
winter and spring months of the year, say from November to May. 

(5) Warm nights d.uring the summer also favor the fig, its devel- 
opment, and its quality. 

SOILS. 

GENERAL REMARKS. 

The fig will grow in ^ almost any soil, and with an abundant water 

it supply will do fairly well even in somewhat poor soils. Lime soi ls 

I are more favorable to the fruit than others. Whatever the soil is, it 

must, in order to secure the best results, be warm, have the property of 

reta ijiing moisture when properly cultivated, and it should be deep^ . 

^ ' ^^^ ^ ^ ^I MJ^^^' "and not underlaid by h ardpan or bed rock . Figs will 

grow in almost all places, but with rocky ledges or hardpan close to the 



.ny 



lA^ 








^ surface the trees will s uffer in times of drought, and in badly drained 

^^ ' soils the fruit will be of inferior quality. The most favorable soil is 

one which is deep, loamy, so f t, full of hum us^ and wjlj bustn abundanc e 

of lime. The latter is inciispensable in producing a superior drjang 

j^g. In very dry soils th e fig is small jand woody, most varieties 

\y^ ^. t.jiik'equiring continually moist soils. B ottom lands and mesas or table 

^ands adjoining rivers are the most suitable plgiees jor fig orc hards. 

•^he alluvial soils in such localities generally have the faculty of 

retaining moisture so necessary to produce pulpy figs. It is an addi- 

v-^"^ tional advantage if these soils are sandy, provided they also are rich 

,v in soluble plant food. Not alLflandx soils are suitable for figs; only 

;« those are which are really rich in plant food and in lime. Very 

.. ' heav^^jclayioL-^M Qbe soil s should be avoided, especially in localities 

which are naturally cold and damp. Alkali soils are not suited to 

I figs, as the alkali tends to~c6unFeract the necessary formation of 

sugar in the fruit. It is well known that both carbonate of sodium 

and sulphate of sodium change the crystalline properties^ of such 

fruit sugars as those contained in beets and cane, and if present in 

too large quantities will prevent the formation of sufficient sugar to 

I pay the grower for his work. Figs, as well as raisin grapes and 

beets, will grow in alkali lands and produce, but the fruit should be 

used for table only and not for drying or for a product where sugar 

is the most important part. 

SOILS IN THE EUROPEAN PIG DISTRICTS. 

No chemical analysis of the best fig soils has ever been made. The 
soil in the Meander Valley, near Smyrna, the principal fig district in 
the world, is a rich and loose alluvial loam of great depth, containing 



CLIMATIC CONDITIONS. 133 

a large percentage of lime and potash. In Sicily, in the Palermo dis- 
trict, where the largest and sweetest figs of Italy are grown, the soil 
is mostly of an alluvial nature, also containing much lime. The soils 
of Algarve, in Portugal, are principally mesa soils of a semialluvial 
nature. It will be remembered that until within a comparatively few 
years the Algarve figs were considered the best in the market, but 
later on Smyrna, through care in selection and curing, took the lead. 
Some of the best Italian figs — those from the province of Catania, in 
Sicily, and those from Pozzuoli, not far from Naples — are grown on 
volcanic soils, and to the lightness and other good qualities of this 
soil is attributed the good quality of the figs. The- figs from Pozzuoli 
are said to bring a better price in the Naples market than any of 
those from southern Italy. 

:^RECAPITULATION. 

(1) Edible figs, to be eaten fresh, are less exacting as to soil; they 
require somewhat more moisture in the soil. 

(2) Figs for drying require warm, moderately dry, and quite sandy, 
but especially limy, soils. 

(3) Heavy wet soils produce coarse figs, and so do heavy clayey 
soils generally. 

(4) Sandy soils produce sweet figs of light color when dried. * 

^v->/^ POSSIBILITIES OF FIG CULTURE IN COLD CLIMATES. 

A^ Although fig culture will always be carried on most successfully and 
' profitably 2n_semitrogical climates as at present, the fig tree readily ., 

accommodates itse lf to^ess favorable reg ions and may be grown ' in ^^^^^ 
many other localities. It appears t hat t he realbaoxi^SJiPj^^ culture , tr- ^, V' 
are sho rt an d col d sum mers. With wa rm days and long summers, g » ^ '^ ' 
such aTare^found in North America and central parts'of Asia, a sue-/) V" 
cessful^cultiirfiLPf figs might be accomplished even with rigorous_win- 
ters. In another part of this volume the writer describes how, by ^ 

c overir^? ; th^ fig trgAs either with mats or^with earth, successful crops c^ ' ' "^ 
are raised far outside of the favored regions of the fig, and the figs ^^ X' ^'' 
thus produced are not poor in quality, but are really good, sweet, .^., ('•' 
j uicy^ and whol esome. Such fig culture is now practiced in the vicinity 
of ^ agi%4n various places in England^ and even in the highlands of 
ce ntral Asia, where the winters are extremely rigorous. In the khanates 
of^okhara and Samarkand figs, pomegranates, and grapevines are 
grown with winter protection; also in the vicinity of Pekin straw pro- 
tection is requTfOT: Some varieties of figs require much less heat 
and can stand much more cold than others, one of the hardiest varie- 
ties being the semidwarf growing Brown Turkey, with its short and 
crooked branches and its deeply cut leaves. There is no doubt that 
figs producing the first crop for the table could be grown profitably 
over a vast area of central North America and Europe in places where 
this delicious fruit is now entirely unknown in its fresh state. 



CHAPTER VI. 
PBOPAGATION OF THE FIG. 

GENERAL REMARKS. 

The fig tree may be propagated in various ways. Few trees are as 
easily grown and few require less skill and previous experience. The 
fig tree may be started in the orchard in the very place where it is 
destined to remain, or it may be propagated in the nursery and later 
on transplanted. The former method can be used only when the 
desired number of cuttings is available. Under favorable condi- 
tions it is the best way to start a fig orchard, as this method is less 
expensive and requires less time. But conditions may make other 
modes of propagation necessary, especially when large cuttings of the 
varieties required are not to be had or are too expensive to justify 
their use. 

While with proper care a fig orchard is very easily started, some 
little neglect and ignorance of detail frequently cause great loss of 
trees during the first season. It may be truly said that the fig is -both 
the easiest and the most difficult tree to grow. 

CUTTINGS OR ROOTED TREES. 

The relative value of cuttings or rooted trees is entirely determined 
by circumstances, such as the mode of planting, care given, experi- 
ence of the planter, facility with which one or the other may be pi*o- 
cured, etc. If cuttings of the desired size, age, form, and structure 
can be had, they are sure to prove very much the cheapest. If the 
soil can be kept in proper condition and if the cuttings are fresh and 
healthy, cuttings will be found preferable to trees in starting a new 
plantation. Cuttings, if fresh and of proper quality otherwise, have 
this superiority over fig trees, that they can always be depended upon 
to grow if given reasonable care. The cutting of the fig tree is remark- 
ably hardj^ does not dry out readily, and if once injured can be 
readily restored to life without much risk of a greater loss than a few 
per cent at most, provided, of course, the drying out has not gone 
beyond a certain limit. Rooted fig trees are in our country easy to 
get, as they are grown here for sale. They have also the advantage 
of being all of a certain size, can make standard trees at once, and, 
provided they are fresh, they will bear sooner than cuttings. But 
rooted fig trees have some drawbacks not possessed by other fruit 
trees, except, perhaps, the olive. The fact is noted that if the trees 
134 



PROPAGATION OF THE FIG. 135 

are allowed to get dry before being reset they are very liable to die 
back to the ground and thus become even of less value than cuttings. 
Many failures in fig plantations arise from this cause. The fault lies 
partly with the sender or the nurseryman; partly, or more frequently, 
with the receiver, whose knowledge of caring for the trees has been at 
fault. If the trees are cared for properly little or no loss is probable. 
A plantation started from trees will be more uniform, will bear 
quicker, but will cost more than one started from cuttings. It should 
be remembered that cuttings of the proper size for planting in the 
open ground must be much larger than cuttings to be first planted in 
nursery rows. For the former purpose long cuttings are required; 
for the latter even the smallest will pi-ove valuable. Unlike other 
nursery-grown trees, fig trees are always started from cuttings. A 
cutting started direct in the orchard is therefore likely to make as 
good or even a better tree than one that has been transplanted. If long 
and proper cuttings can be had the}^ are preferable to trees, but 
well-grown trees are preferable to small cuttings. 

FRESH AND DRY CUTTINGS. 

The main point in planting a ^g orchard from cuttings is that the 
cuttings should be perfectly fresh. To be sure of this, each cutting 
should be clipped at both its upper and lower ends just before plant- 
ing, except in case the top of a cutting ends in a terminal bud. Of 
course, the clipping is only to learn the proper state of the cutting. 
The cutting is fresh if an abundance of milky juice exudes from the 
inner bark or cambium layer immediately when the cut is made. The 
freer the juice flows the better the cutting, while if only a few tiny 
drops exude here and there the cutting is unfit for planting and must 
be revived. If fresh, the cutting should be plump, and the year's 
wood should be glossy, bulging, and no sign of shrinkage should be 
be seen. The buds of a cutting which is in proper condition should 
also be plump and the outside scale of the bud should not be dried. 
When this scale is torn off the milky sap should exude from the wound. 

Such plump fig cuttings will readily grow, and if each cutting is 
examined before planting, and if the planting is done in proper soil 
and good care is given, there should be less than 1 per cent loss from 
failure to grow. 

A dry cutting may be easily detected. Its wood is shriveled, and 
when cut transversely little or no milky sap exudes, or the sap will 
be thin and watery. When the inner green bark and cambium are 
lifted with a sharp knife they appear dry and shrunken or even discol- 
ored. The buds on a bad cutting are more or less dry; the outside 
scales are shrunken and do not closely cover the interior ones, and 
they appear hard when pressed with the fingers. These characteris- 
tics of the buds are sure signs as to the quality of the cutting, as they 
can be detected at a glance, even at a distance. A dry cutting has a

different color from a fresh one, the former being grayish and dull, 
the latter being blackish or dark and brilliant, reflecting the sun or 
light. 

BEST TIME FOB MAKING CUTTINGS. 

The fig tree is never entirely dormant, as there is always some sap 
moving. Even in winter, when all the leaves have fallen, a cut in the 
wood will cause the sap to exude. But the fig has periods of greater 
or lesser activity, the latter beginning in the fall of the year after 
the leaves have fallen. This period should be chosen for propagat- 
ing the fig. The flow of sap at that time does not interfere with 
the rooting of the cuttings, as it is the downward flow of the sap which 
produces the callus from which the roots develop. Later, when the 
leaves have started, the fig roots with more difficulty. The proper 
time for cuttings is therefore in November and December, and if the 
ground is warm and sandy, the sooner they are planted the better. If 
the ground is very cool and clayey, the making of cuttings, or at least 
their planting, should be postponed until February or March, although 
the earliest planted cuttings always prove the best, provided the con- 
ditions have been proper. Cuttings which are to be sent away should 
always be cut early, as they stand long shipments better than cuttings 
which have been made late. The latter contain much more sap, and 
on this account are less dormant. For planting out of doors, the ear- 
lier the cuttings are made after the frost has caused the leaves to fall 
the better. 

HOW TO MAKE CUTTINGS. 

If a large fig plantation is to be started it is most practical to make 
the different sizes of cuttine:s at the same time and to assort them 
afterwards. If cuttings ^re required year after year, it is best to 
have certain trees set apart for that purpose, as when fruiting trees 
are cut back they will cease to bear properly for one or more years, 
or they will bear inferior fruit. The branches from which the cut- 
tings are to be made should be cut back at once to the main stem of 
the tree. After being thrown to the ground the large limbs should 
be sawed or cut off immediately and assorted as to size. After being 
conveyed to a cool place they should be protected from the sun and 
wind. This may be done either by heeling the cuttings in the ground 
if they are apt to remain there for some length of time — a week or 
ten days — before being cut up. But if they ai*e to be worked up at 
once they may be merely covered with straw, wet sacks, or blankets. 
If covered at all they must be covered well; and not more than one- 
tenth part of their whole length should in any case be exposed t^o.the 
sun or winds. This refers also to the heeling in, when nine-tenths of 
the cuttings should be below the soil. 

The large cuttings should be made up first. The large limbs 
should be sawed off square across and cut, as straight as possible, in 



PROPAGATION OF THE FIG. 



137 



lengths of from 3 to 4 feet. These large cuttings may be at once 
transferred to the orchard and planted directly where they are to 
remain. If this can not be done, these large cuttings may also be 
heeled in. This should be done immediately, and if possible the same 
day as cut. 

The small cuttings may be cut up at leisure in the shade. If they 
have been previously heeled in they should first be washed, as the soil 
will spoil the shears and retard the work generally. It is the most 
profitable to make three different grades of cuttings, all grades being 
cut at the same time. Have the men sitting on low boxes or tripod 
chairs, each man with a pile of rough branches or large cuttings 

before him, and three boxes 
of different sizes at his side, 
these latter for the recep- 
tion of the newly made cut- 
tings. As a rule the differ- 
ent sizes may be 12 to 14 
inches for the largest and 
thickest, 6 inches for the 
medium size, while the tips 
or shortest branches may be 
made 1 or 2 inches in lengt.h 
and serve as the smallest 
grade. The two largest sizes 
should be placed in layers 
with the butt ends in the 
same direction. This is im- 
portant, as otherwise many 
of the cuttings will be plant- 
ed upside down. The small 
tips may be thrown promis- 
cuously into the box. 

In making the cuttings it 
is necessary that the shears 
should be kept sharp, and a hone should always be handy for that pur- 
pose. Care should be taken to cut exactly at the joint, where there is 
no pith visible. By splitting a fig-cutting lengthwise it will be seen 
that the pith does not extend through the joint, but that there is a 
place in the joint where the wood is solid. (See fig. 19.) If the cut is 
made exactly in this solid part, both the bottom end of one cutting and 
the top end of the one below will be closed by solid, woody matter, and 
not exhibit any pith. The advantage gained is that the solid bottom 
end will root easier, while the top end will be protected from insect 
borers, which often work down through the pith from the point where 
it is exposed. The part of the cutting thus injured will dry and die. 
If the pith is not exposed, the borer can not make a ready entrance.

138 THE fig: its history, culture, and curing. 

It is hardly necessary to add that the proper place for makirifi: cut- 
tings is in a large shed, or under the shade of a large tree. 
The following are the main points in making cuttings: 

(1) The operation must he performed in the shade. 

(2) The shears should be very sharp. 

(3) Large and small cuttings are best made at the same time. 

(4) Grade the cuttings as soon as made. 

(5) The cut to be made in the joints where the wood is solid. 

(6) The larger cuttings to be placed in boxes, with the butt ends all 
in one direction. 

CARE OF CUTTINGS AFTER THEY ARE MADE. 

Many failures arise from want of care of the cuttings after they 
have been made. A cutting should be fresh, or at least full of sap, 
before planting in nursery .or orchard. The best method is to plant 
the cuttings as soon as they are made. If this be done they should 
not be disturbed from the boxes in which they were placed after being 
cut; and to transfer the boxes at once to the field will save work, and 
the chance of mixing the cuttings will be less. If planting can not 
be done immediately, the cuttings should be heeled in. This may be 
done by digging a trench as deep as half the size of the cutting, the 
soil being thrown up always on the same side, and toward the south 
if possible, thus forming an embankment, making the trench twice as 
deep. The cuttings are then put in slanting, with their tops leaning 
against the loose soil. The soil to be used for covering tlie trench is 
dug out of the opposite side and from the next trencli to be dug. 
First the lower part of the trench is filled in, then loose soil is heaped 
in around the cuttings to within a few inches of their tops. Another 
layer of cuttings is then put on against this soil, the original trench 
all the time being made wider. The cuttings should not protrude 
more than a few inches. Thus heeled in, the cuttings should be kept 
slightly moist, but not wet. If too moist the cuttings will make root 
quickly. This is to be avoided as much as possible, as these roots 
will all die in replanting and rob the cutting of considerable sap and 
life force. 

If there is danger of the cuttings rooting too soon they may be 
taken out and dried in the air for a few hours or longer, accoixling to 
the weather, and then afterwards be put back into the trench. Such 
drying does not injure the cuttings, provided proper care is taken in 
not drying too much. In this manner cuttings may be kept in good 
condition for several months and until very late in the spring. The 
soil in the trench should be kept firm in order that the drying winds 
may not enter or that mold may not form. Aftei' eviuy watering the 
holes formed by the settling of the soil should be filled in and tiodden 
down. If the cuttings have from any cause become dry they should 
at once be revived. This can be done bv placing them in a ditch or 



PROPAGATION OF THE FIG. 139 

tub filled with water, running water being* best. One night in water 
will generally revive most cuttings — that is, if they are not absolutely 
dead — and cause them to become plump again. Some cuttings in 
every lot are, however, irreparably injured by drying out, and these 
should, if the least shriveled, be thrown out at planting and no risk 
taken with them. If the varietj^ is very valuable these injured cut- 
tings may possibly be saved, and they should be cared for separately. 
The very small tips or single-eye fig cuttings should be allowed to 
remain in boxes, covered with moist or slightly damp sand in such 
a way that no part of them remains exposed. All such tips should be 
grown under glass or cover or in separate beds, where they can hfs 
given necessary care. 

The following are the main points in caring for the cuttings: 

(1) Plant, if possible, as soon as made. 

(2) Do not expose to the sun. 

(3) Heel in a trench, leaving not more than two eyes exposed. 

(4) Tamp the soil in the trench so as to exclude the air and prevbiii 
drying. 

(5) Keep moist, but not wet. 

(G) Prevent rooting or callusing by occasional drying. 

(7) Examine the cuttings every two days. 

(8) Very short cuttings should be entirely covered. 

(9) If dried out, revive at once by immersing in water or by covei 
ing entirely with wet soil. 

(10) Never cover with wet straw. 

(11) If callused when planting, cut off the callused part. 

PLANTING CUTTINGS IN NURSERY ROWS. 

Mark off the field by driving pegs in two parallel rows, the pegs in 
each row to be 4 feet apart. The best chain or line that can be used 
is five-plj^ twisted wire, generally known as ** cable." After the pegs 
are set stretch the cable between two opposite pegs, and while the 
cable rests on the ground cut out a V -trench along the cable by means 
of the Italian broad hoe. In making the trench the fiat edge of the hoe 
is slapped on the ground as close to the cable as possible and parallel 
to it. By pulling the hoe toward the workman a small trench is exca- 
vated which can be made sufficiently deep by twice repeating the 
stroke. Three men can perform this work to the best advantage — one 
at each end and one in the center of the cable. As soon as the cable 
is stretched all three men begin the digging of the trench. The cut- 
tings should be planted by a separate gang of men as soon as each 
trench is ready, The i)lanting is simple. The cuttings are placed 
vertically against the perpendicular side of the trench, about 10 inches 
apart, and sufficiently deep to leave one eye above the soil and one 
eye just in the surface line. As soon as a part of a row of cuttings is 
set, one man should follow with an Italian hoe and scrape the soil 



140 THE fig: its history, oultube, and curing. 

toward the cuttings. When he has caught up with the planter he 
should return and tamp the soil on both sides of the cuttings, not 
only by walking with one foot on each side of the row, but by using 
as much force as possible in pressing the soil hard. The soil can 
not be pressed too hard, provided it is not wet and soggy. If irri- 
gation can not be had at once, or if the weather is very warm and 
dry, it is advisable to pull loose soil to the verj'^ top of the cuttings 
after the tamping is over. 

This leaves only the very tops exposed or just in the soil, and pre- 
vents the cuttings from drying out. This entire covering over is also 
a most excellent way of leviving cuttings which have been planted, 
but which, from some cause or other, have become shriveled. A few 
days of shade will revive them, and the soil may be either pulled 
away again or be left. The sprouts of the figs will be able to push 
through if the covering is not over 2 inches thick. 

In the directions above given the following points are to be noted 
as of special importance:, 

(1) Uniform distance between the rows. 

(2) Absolutely straight rows. 

(3) The planting of cuttings at once, after the trench is scooped out. 

(4) Covering the ti'ench at once after planting. 

(5) Tamping the soil very hard. 

(6) The shading of the cuttings by loose soil. 

(7) Prevention of the exposure of more than one eye. 

PLANTING SMALL CUTTINGS IN NURSERY. 

The planting of very small cuttings of 4 to 6 inches in length should 
be done in low beds in irrigated districts, or, if in moist places, in 
elevated beds. The low beds should be absolutely level and surrounded 
by a low ridge in order to check the water which is to be conducted by 
a small ditch to the bed in such a way that the whole bed may be flooded 
at once. After the bed has been prepared the soil should be dug up 
and raked loose. A small V-formed trench is then excavated from one 
end of the bed to the other and the cuttings placed in this about 3 
inches apart. The whole bed is filled with cuttings in this way. Only 
one eye of each cutting should be left out of the ground. When 
planted the bed should be flooded at once and covered with well-rotted 
straw in which all seeds have been destroyed by fermentation. Fresh 
straw will bring too many weeds and will, besides, injure the cuttings 
by attracting and reflecting intense sun heat. Such beds of cuttings 
are apt to dry out very quickly and require a great deal of water. If 
properly cared for they will make fine but small trees, suit-ed for plant- 
ing in nursery rows the following season. During the growing season 
the plants should be suck^red and only one shoot allowed to grow. 
The terminal buds of the plants should be kept growing until the latter 



PROPAGATION OF THE FIG. 



141 



part of September, when they should be checked by keeping dry. (See 
fig. 20.) 

The following points are to be observed in planting small cuttings 
out of doors: 

(1) Plant in beds absolutely level. 

(2) Expose only one eye. 
(e3) Keep constantly moist. 

(4) Cover with well-rotted straw. 

(5) Allow only a single shoot. 

(6) Allow no growth after September. 

(7) Observe the termi- 
nal bud daily, and irrigate 
the moment the growth is 
checked, which is indicat- 
ed by the *' heart leaves" 
becoming stunted and 
dry. 

PLANTING SINGLE EYES. 

The fig propagates 
readily from single eyes. 
Those that are saved in 
pruning and in making 
cuttings should not be 
allowed to be kept cov- 
ered more than two days, 
as they begin to callus 
almost at once, and when 
once callused they do not 
readily stand moving. 
The best place for plant- 
ing single eyes is in a 
frame covered by glass, 
canvas, or laths. Make 
the bed very level and 
water freely. The soil in the bed should consist of three-fourths pure 
sand, but should not contain manure. Plant the eyes about 3 inches 
apart each way and cover the eyes about 1^ inches with sharp, pure 
sand. Do not water for several days; keep only moist, not wet. The 
eye should be placed horizontally. The single-eye cutting is made 
either by cutting the wood across on each side of the eye, thus pre- 
serving the thickness of the wood intact, or by splitting the wood 
lengthwise. In the latter case the whole of the fiat surface will callus 
and root. (See fig. 20.) 

The object in planting single eyes is simply to procure plants of 
rare varieties. For ordinary kinds it Is not worth the trouble to save 




Fig. 20.- 



6, d. Small rooted cuttingrs of figs; c, a sinfifle- 
eye catting. 



142 THE fig: its history, culture, and curing. 

the small cuttings or the single eyes. A cutting which is badly dried 
should first be soaked or revived, then the eyes cut out as above and 
planted separately. This is preferable to planting any of the dry wood. 

SUCKERS. 

Figs may be propagated readily from suckers or so-called water- 
shoots, which spring up in abundance at the base of older trees. 
Such trees will bear as much and as good fruit as those grown from 
cuttings, but they are supposed by some growers to produce a greater 
quantity of objectionable suckers, which must be removed several 
times during the year. For cuttings such suckers are not as well 
suited, as the wood is very long between joints and generally is less 
well matured than the regular branches. Cuttirigs from branches 
are therefore to be preferred. When suckers are used they should 
be treated exactly like cuttings or rooted trees. When suckers are 
planted directly in the orchard care should be taken to set the butt 
end containing the few rootlets sufficiently deep in order that it may 
not dry out. It should be set just as deep as one would plant a cut- 
ting. The top of a sucker need not be cut back, but may be left a 
foot or two above the soil, just like a tree, provided, however, that it 
has been detached from the mother trunk with at least a few adhering 
rootlets. 

budding and grafting. 

GENERAL REMARKS. 

The fig may be either budded or grafted, preferably the latter; but 
there is little advantage in doing so, except when it is desirable to 
change a tree of one variety into another more desirable, or when 
it is found advantageous to give a weak-growing variety a strong 
and vigorous root and stock. Nurseymen's fig trees intended for sale 
are never grafted or budded, but are always grown from cuttings. 
Many people mistake the suckers of growing trees for suckers from 
the root below a supposed graft. Such suckers differ always somewhat 
in leaf from the older branches, but unless it is known with certaint^^ 
that the tree is grafted it is safe to assume that the strange- looking 
suckers belong to the same kind as the parent fruiting tree. 

The time for budding and grafting is in winter, when the sap is com- 
paratively dormant. Fig trees, unlike other trees, are never entirely 
dormant, and in order to succeed in grafting it is of importance to have 
as little flow of sap as possible, else the sap will throw off the bud. 



Fig trees are seldom budded, as grafting is much preferable. Still, 
if budding is desired as a curiosity it may be done. It is believed, 
however, that budded trees will not make as strong trees as those 



PROPAGATION OF THE FIG. 143 

grafted. Both in grafting and budding the fig the same operation 
must be had as in budding and grafting the walnut. A few remarks 
regarding budding may suffice. The best form of bud to be used in 
budding the fig is the ring bud. The first operation is to girdle the 
branch which is to be budded, making the girdle cover the site of an 
eye. Then take from the scion a girdle of exactl}'^ the same width 
and place this in position on the branch in place of the one removed. 
It is always best to place the new bud exactly over the spot where the 
old one was located, or, in other words, the ring bud taken from the 
stock is replaced by one as similar as possible from the scion. If the 
old branch is larger than the new one from which the bud is taken, 
enough bark should be left on the stock to allow the new bark to touch 
everywhere. The ring bud must fit exactlj^ the f)lace from which the 
bark was removed, especially at the upper margin and at the back. 
After the bud is inserted, tie firmly with cotton twine and wax well and 
do not cutback the top until the new bud has fully taken and grown sev- 
eral inches. Then cut back to one bud above the new bud. Destroy 
this upper bud by pinching, leaving only one leaf to draw the sap. 
After the new bud has grown several feet this old top may be entirely 
removed, either at once or during the following winter. In order to 
insure success the air should be well excluded by grafting wax from 
both buds and grafts. 

GRAFTING. 

If proper care is taken, the grafting of fig trees is not a difficult 
matter. Both scions and stock should be as dormant as possible, the 
best time for this being in January, though grafting may be done as 
late as in March. Only poor success will be had in grafting after the 
leaves begin to show and the sap flows readily. The following account 
of grafting the fig is mainly based on the experience of Mr. John Rock, 
who has brought the grafting of fig trees to great perfection. 

SCION. 

The best scion or wood is two years' wood, because it possesses less 
pith than one-year-old wood. End grafts or scions with top bud are 
the best. The form of the scion must be wedge-shaped, not only from 
top to bottom, but from front to back, and only one of the surfaces 
cut must show any pith. The side of the scion is placed toward the 
center of the stock, while of course the other side of the scion, which 
shows no pith, is placed toward the back or outward side of the stock. 
In order to have the scion properly cut the pith on the one side must 
be situated very low down, near the bottom of the scion. If situated 
higher up, the other side is sure to show some pith, too, which will be 
greatly detrimental to the future tree. (See i\g. 21.) 

Incipient fruit buds must be nipped off from the scions. The scions 
figured are of natural size and exact copies of those actually in use. 



144 



THE fig: its histoey, culture, and curing. 



Fig. 21.— Pig scions for grafting— John Bock^s method. 



Terminal scions are the best. If other scions are to be used, the top 
cut should be made one-half inch above the top bud. This cut 

should be somewhat slant- 
ing. The front part of the 
wedge — that is, the part 
or face with the most bark 
surface and the one which 
when inserted will face 
outward — must have a 
bud at its upper end. 
Thus, in making the scion, 
begin by placing the knife 
-^ r^ close to a bud and then 

draw the knife downward. 
This is best seen in the 
illustration. 



STOCK. 



Any limb of an old fig 
tree may be grafted, pro- 
vided it is healthy and not 

sunburnt. The limb is cut squarely off or slightly slanting. The best 

size of limbs is probably 

about 2 inches in diameter. 

The cut should be made at 

a joint, as there is less pith 

there than anywhere else. 

This cut is best made with 

a saw. Many cuttings may 

be grafted into every tree, 

but it is of the utmost im- 
portance that, according 

to the size of the tree, one 

or two branches should be 

left entire, in order that 

the sap may be drawn into 

the old tree. (See fig. 25. ) 

If all the branches are 

grafted and no large 

branches left untouched 

the old tree will die 

through the stagnation of 

sap. In old trees one or 

two large branches are left.

CLEFT. 

Smaller stocks require only one graft, but in the larger ones it is 
best to insert two or three grafts. Each graft is inserted in a cleft. 
This cleft, or slot, should be made with a knife or wedge and not with 
a saw, as the latter will make an uneven surface. The direction of 
the cleft should not be exactly parallel with the long axis of the 
stock, but should form with it a small angle, pointing toward the 
center of the branch, and it should not be so long as to cross the cen- 
ter. If pointing straight downward it will cause the stock to split, 
and if it crosses the center it may also cause the stock to split off. At 
any rate, it will not be prop- 
erly kept in place. On the 
other hand, the upper part 
of the cleft, which crosses 
the cut-off surface of the 
stock, must not go through 
to the bark on the opposite 
side of the stock. The cleft 
is made on one side of the 
center, between the pith and 
the bark (see fig. 22), and 
must on no account cross 
the pith. If this is done the 
tree will be ruined. 

INSERTING THE GRAFT. 

When the scion is prop- 
erly inserted in the stock 
it will show the following 
features: Its lower wedge- 
shaped part will point 
slightly toward the center 
of the stock and the median 
longitudinal diameter of the 
branch. The upper free 
part makes a small angle 
with the squarely cut-off surface of the stock. Thus the scion and 
stock are not parallel. At the junction of the scion and the stock 
is situated, facing outward, the lower bud or eye of the scion. 
Of the two planed-off surfaces of the scion, the one with the pith 
faces inward toward the pith of the stock. The inner green laj^er, 
or cambium, of scion and stock must touch at several points. (See 
fig. 23.) 





Fto. 23.— Two tig branches, showing manner of insert- 
ing the scions. 



146 



THE fig: its history, culture, and curing. 



TREATMENT. 

The scion is lirmly tied witli cotton twine, and the upper surface of 
fche stock as well as the lower part of the scion must be well covered 
with grafting wax in order to fully exclude air, rain, damp, and wind. 
After grow^th has begun, all the eyes of the scions should be allowed 
to grow for several months, but when tliey get to be too large and 
when there will be danger of the grafts being blown or broken off, 
the new, young, green wood must be cut back in such a way as to 
steady the graft. The growing branches of the graft must be tied 
to stout stakes, two, three, or more of which are required at every 
tree. (See fig. 27.) If the growing branches of the grafts are not tied 
securely they will with certainty blow off or break off by their own 

weight. These stakes must re- 
main during the whole first 
year. When the scions have 
grown and attained one year 
the large or small branches of 
the original stock which were 
left to draw sap may be cut off 
or grafted, if necessary. After 
the scions have started to grow 
well it is necessary to cut open 
the strings with which the cleft 
was tied, or they will cut into 
the wood. Then new strings 
are tied and new wax is put on 
as before. The cutting back 
of green wood and branches 
should be done gradually. 

PROTECTION FROM SUNBURN.

It is of the utmost impor- 
tance that the trunk of the old 
fig tree or stock should be covered with tule or flag, or otherwise pro- 
tected, on the south and west sides, or sun, Avind, and borei-s Avill ruin 
the tree. The fig, while a tropical tree, will not stand the exposure 
of its bark to the sun or wind, except in winter. It shares this pecul- 
iarity with most evergreen trees. (See fig. 2G.) 



SHIPPING cuttings. 



Fig cuttings are much less susceptible of being damaged in shipping 
than tig trees with large, developed roots. If accidentally injured 
by drying, the}^ may be revived more readily than t\g trees or most 
other kinds of cuttings. In shipping long distances great care should 
be taken in proper packing. If properly packed fig cuttings may be

consigned on a voyage of three or four months and arrive at titieir 
destination in ^ood condition. The style of x>acking must vary 
according to the distance and time of voyage, and also according to 
whether the cuttings are to be sent by mail, by freight, or other con- 
veyance. In shipping cuttings to localities within one or two days' 
journey no special care is required. The cuttings should be tied in 
bundles of 50 to 100, as may be most convenient, two stout baling 
ropes being required, and 
tied one at each end of 
the bundle. A sack should 
then be slipped outside of 
the bundle, and if the 
weather is warm and dry, 
straw should be packed 
tightly between the cut- 
tings and the sack, and the 
bag then stitched up. Diy- 
goods boxes may in some 
instances be preferred to 
sacks. Damp straw may be 
used for a week's ti-ip, in 
which case a box should al- 
ways be used. For longer 
d istances the cutting s 
should be packed in dry 
charcoal and sealed in tin 
or in moss. The former is 
a most excellent packing 
and safe for a two months' 
journey, but has the fault 
that when the boxes are 
opened at the custom-house 
the charcoal will run out 
and the cuttings quickly 
dry. In all such cases the 
use of sphagnum moss must 
be substituted for charcoal. 
This moss is sold in pressed 
bales, is comparatively very cheap, and weighs but little. The moss is 
first made quite wet with water and then squeezed dry Avith the hands 
or by a press. A tight box is selected, the sides of which should be 
braced and bound with light irons. Along the inner sides of the box 
nail oiled paper, folding the paper in the corners. Put first a thick 
la}' or of sciueezed moss in the bottom of the box, then a layer of cut- 
tings, then a less thick layer of moss, another layer of cuttings, and 
so on. A thicker layer of moss should be placed on the top similarly

to that on the sides, and all should be covered with oiled paper. 
Another good way is to tie the cuttings together in small bundles of 8 
or 10, and treat these bundles as single cuttings. A more solid pack- 
ing is the result. Very large boxes should never be used. A box 1 
foot wide and 1 foot deep by 18 inches long is of a good size, is easily 
handled, and not readily broken. When the top is screwed on and 
the box turned over there should be no shaking inside, but all should 

be perfectly solid. 
A yet safer wa}' is 
to cover each little 
bundle with plenty 
of moss, then out- 
side of the moss 
wrap a stout pa- 
per, oiled or par- 
aflBn paper to be 
preferred. The 
bundles are to be 
kept steady in the 
box with plenty of 
moss. The points 
to be especially 
observed are to 
squeeze the water 
out of the moss well 
and to pack so that 
the cuttings will

to a greater extent 
as the moss grad- 
ually dries, and 
the cuttings will 
dry through the 
air admitted to the 
box. Cuttings well 
packed in very 
small boxes or in oiled paper and moss may be safely sent by mail, 
and will not dry out for one or two weeks. Such bundles must be 
tied very solidly. It is always preferable to dip all cut and exposed 
surfaces in melted wax, grafting wax to be preferred. This of course 
prevents the cuttings from drying out rapidly and insures greater 
safety. If a few cuttings only are sent, each one should be sealed 
with wax, and then wrapped first in paraffin paper and then in 
tinfoLl.

SHIPPING LARGE FIG TREES. 



Large trees suitable for planting are generally sent in bales, cov- 
ered with flag, tnle, or straight straw. First, place on the ground or 
floor at least five pieces of baling rope, each with an eye knot at one 
end and of suflBcient length to go around the bale. These ropes 
should be laid parallel and about 12 inches or less apart. Across 
these ropes place a thin layer of 
straight flag, tule, or long straw. 
Upon this heap a lot of common 
fresh, damp straw about 2 inches 
thick. Upon this straw lay the 
trees, with the roots all toward 
one end, and if the fig trees are 
not very large place some of the 
smaller trees with the roots more 
toward the center, in order to 
make the bundle more cylindrical 
and less conical. Cover the trees 
with a thick layer of straw, then 
bring the straw and flag together 
to the top of the« bundle over its 
sides and rapidly pass the ends of 
the ropes together, so that each 
rope forms a slipknot around the 
bundle. It takes two men to 
make such a tree bundle, though 
it may be made by one man if he 
is skillful and if the bundle is not 
too large. The ropes should be 
drawn as tight as possible. Nur- 
serymen use several mechanical 
appliances for making these bun- 
dles. None, however, have im- 
pressed the writer as being very 
practicable. After all the ropes 
have been thoroughly tightened, 
two ropes should be run length- 
wise, connecting the cross ropes with one another so that they may 
not slip off. Finally, the straw and flags protruding unevenly are 
trimmed off with a sharp knife. The bundles are dampened by 
water if the weather is warm and dry. Such bundles, if solid, will 
stand a voyage of a week or two in winter time in moderate climates, 
but in cold weather they are liable to be frosted. It is hardly neces- 
sary to add that the bundles should be kept shaded as much as pos- 
sible and not exposed to wind or sun.

THE fig: its history, culture, and curing. 



For longer distances moss should be used freely between the roots, 
or, if the trees are very valuable and the distance long, damp moss 
may be tied around the roots oif each tree separately and the trees 
either baled or packed in tight boxes. It is a good plan to first dip 
or puddle the roots of the trees in a wet mixture of clay and cow dung, 
thus covering the roots with a crust, which will add greatly to their 
protection and prevent mold or rot from setting in from the outside. 
The main point in packing is to exclude air. Pack damp, but not 
wet, and so securely that the trees and cuttings can not shake or 
change place. Straw is always less valuable than moss for packing, 
as it brings mold and rot, while moss keeps fresh and alive, even 
under very adverse circumstances.

HOW TO treat injured FIG CUTTINGS. 

Valuable fig cuttings which, through poor packing or by accident, 
have become very dry may be saved by extra care. Such cuttings, 
even if apparently dead, should not be thrown away. The process 
described here for restoring fig cuttings has been tried by the writer 
several times with complete success. Slightly modified, it may be 
applied also to almost any other variety of cuttings, such as olives, 
etc.; but the success is never as great as with figs. Procure a deep 
earthenware dish and fill with as hot Avater as the hands can possibly 
bear and immerse the cuttings completely. Cover over with sacks or 
blankets in order to retain the heat. If in two liouivs the cuttiiiirs 



PROPAGATION OF THE FIG. 151 

show no marked improvement, renew the water and make it as hot as 
before. But if an improvement is seen, renew with somewhat cooler 
water. The cuttings should remain immersed for twelve hour's or 
overnight, after which drain off the water, rinse the cuttings, and 
transfer them to a box. Fill the box and pack as tightly as possible 
with moist sand. The box should then be placed in a hole in the 
ground and covered at least 2 feet deep with fresh soil. In twenty- 
four hours the cuttings may be taken put. If there was any life left in 
the cuttings they will now have suflBciently recovered to be planted. 
If they yet remain dry there is but little hope, though if very valuable 
they may again be transferred to water as before and given another 
trial. The writer has in this way revived cuttings which were pro- 
nounced dead and which when cut did not show any sign of sap. 
Such revived cuttings must be planted and cared for in an entirely 
different way from other cuttings. They should never be planted in 
the open ground, at least not at once, but must first be started under 
glass in a low frame placed directly on the ground. The frame should 
be slanting toward the north and covered ^ith thickly whitewashed 
glass. The soil should be very sandy, and a layer of pure sand should 
be placed over the soil in such a way that when planted the bottom 
end of the cuttings will rest in the sand, but immediately over the 
soil. Only living wood must be planted. As soon as the cuttings are 
planted with only their tips protruding over the sand, the frame may 
be well watered once and then covered. After that no more watering 
is required, as a single additional watering may prove fatal to all the 
cuttings, until they have started and grown several inches. The 
glass should not be lifted, and no extra air is required until green 
leaves begin to show. The main point is to keep the frame cool and 
as dry as possible without allowing the cuttings to suffer. As a rule, 
even in very warm and dry weather, the frame will retain its first 
moisture for a month or more. The least excess of moisture will 
cause the cuttings to rot. Of course the young plants can not be 
removed until the next season. It is of very great importance that 
no dead wood should be left and planted, and such cuttings only 
should be used which show a flow of sap, and even if the sap be faint 
and watery the cuttings should be planted. The sap will in a few 
days become milky if the cuttings grow. If dead wood is planted it 
will draw upon the sap supply and finally rot, even if the eye has 
started and made a shoot. Such cuttings should, if possible, be cut 
to a joint. In watering such cuttings care should be taken in using 
only very pure water from wells or springs, as ditch water is likely to 
produce rot or other fungus growth in the bed. 

SEEDLINGS. 

Figs may be grown readily from perfect seeds; but, as only capri- 
ficated figs, or figs which have grown close to caprifigs ox to figs with

152 THE fig: its history, culture, and curing. 

male flowers, have fertile seeds, it is necessary to use seeds of imported 
Smyrna figs or seeds from figs caprificated in this country or else- 
where. Gut open the figs and remove all the pulp by washing out in 
warm water. Seeds which float are empty and worthless, while those 
which sink are generally fertile. Sow the fertile seeds in shallow boxes 
containing sand and loam mixed and place the boxes in a frame under 
glass or canvas. The proper time for this operation is in the spring. 
In three weeks the seedlings will appear above the ground, and from 
that time on they must be sparingly watered. The next season they 
should be set out in nursery rows, the rows 10 inches wide and 4 feet 
apart. In three years such plants will be found to bear, but they will 
not necessarily mature the fruit. Very few, indeed, of these seedlings 
will produce valuable fruit. The majority will give fruits with male 
flowers, which are always a drawback to the edible qualities of the 
fig, as they and their part of the fig receptacle never soften. The 
raising of figs from seed is an interesting process, and by chance some 
valuable figs may be produced in this way. But, as there are several 
hundred fig varieties known, it is better first to experiment with them 
rather than to try to raise new varieties. Unfortunately for the 
grower, fig seedlings will mostly revert to the wild fig or caprifig, 
which, of course, always is the male parent. It is not proven with cer- 
tainty that more than one or two fig varieties of value have been pro- 
duced from seed, though it is probable that a majority of our ^g 
varieties have originated in this way. According to observations 
made in Italy as well as here, it seems that fig seedlings produce 
both regular caprifigs and figs with mixed male and other flowers. 
Smyrna-fig seedlings raised by the writer produced trees with purely 
female flowers and others which contained male flowers in various 
proportions and development. The experiments made by other horti- 
culturists turned out in the same way. So far no edible variety of the 
common fig has been originated in California, and any statements of 
valuable varieties having been raised from seed in hothouses in Eng- 
land or elsewhere in Europe should be accepted with doubt. 

While it may be unnecessary at present to raise seedlings from 
edible varieties in order to produce other edible kinds, it is not only 
not unnecessary, but highly desirable, that we should raise new varie- 
ties of caprifigs from seed of caprifigs. In this way we may procure 
new caprifig varieties which will be more suited to local conditions 
than any which we can import from abroad. The figs which we have 
named, respectively, Mitchell and Maslin are undoubtedly such 
chance seedlings which may prove of much value. 



CHAPTER VII. 
PLANTING A FIG OBCHAKD. 

GBNBRAL RBMARKS. 

The planting of an orchard includes several different operations, 
such as preparing the ground, setting the stakes, digging the holes, 
and setting the trees, as well as their care immediately after planting. 
As all these processes are of importance and should be intelligently 
performed, they will be considered separately. 

Opinions differ in regard to these operations more than in any 
others pertaining to fig culture, and the respective horticulturists use 
different means by which the same object is more or less speedily and 
properly attained. Most of these methods employed in planting a. fig 
orchard are equally applicable to the planting of any other fruit trees. 
Still, the fig tree possesses peculiarities which must be considered and 
humored in order to attain success as speedily and practically as 
possible. These peculiarities of the fig consist principally in growth 
and habit, in mode of bearing, in aptness to break down, in suscepti- 
bility to heat and dry winds, etc. In this respect the fig tree stands 
almost isolated among fruit trees and shade trees. One theory holds 
that the fig tree should be treated very much like a wild tree; and 
that, because in many places in the Old World fig trees are allowed to 
take care of themselves and to grow as they please in odd corners, 
they should receive no serious attention — especially so the caprifig 
tree, which should be left to nature as much as possible. Like so 
many other trees, the fig tree may be planted almost anywhere and in 
any way and still give fruit; but, in order to insure the greatest suc- 
cess as much care should be given the fig tree as to any other fine 
variety of fruit. 

The tree which comes nearest to the fig as regards horticultural 
peculiarities and wants is undoubtedly the olive, though it differs 
widely from the fig in many respects; but in planting and care these 
two trees require very much the same treatment. 

DISTANCES FOR FIG TREES. 

Of all our fruit trees the edible fig tree requires the greatest amount 
of space in the orchard. Much, however, depends upon the variety 
grown. Small-growing kinds like the Brunswick, the Ischias, Mar- 

153 



154 THE fig: its history, culture, and curing. 

seillaise, and a host of others will thrive with 25 to 30 feet between 
the trees, while others like the Mission, the Adriatic, and the Smyrnas 
require 50 or 60 feet, the latter being the distance now generally 
adopted in Smyrna. Where smaller crops are grown between the 
trees, the larger distance may be given at once, as it will allow ample 
room for intermediate plantations for years. But where no such 
crops are contemplated the trees may be set at first 25 feet each way, 
with the intention to ultimately remove every other tree in each alter- 
nate row, while every other row must be removed entirely. But this 
leads of necessity to great waste of trees, as two-thirds of them will 
have to be removed in order that the remainder may be 50 feet apart. 
In selecting the distance we must be guided by the variety, not alone 
in respect to growth and size, but perhaps principally by the quality 
of the fruit. It frequently occurs that fig trees while comparativelj'^ 
young give most excellent and sweet fruit, while a few years later the 
fruit sours and spoils as soon as fairly ripe. This to a great extent is 
caused by the crowding of the trees, by too much moisture, by want 
of air and sunshine and room to breathe. Different varieties act 
very differently in this respect. Thus our Black Mission fig will 
stand crowding quite well without souring its fruit, while the figs of 
the Adriatic will inevitably spoil as soon as the trees begin to shade 
one another sufficiently to keep out the wind and the sun. Thus the 
Adriatic figs and similar varieties must have plenty of sun and air, 
sunshine and air being especially necessarj'^ to the Adriatic figs. 
When exposed to constant breezes they can stand some shade without 
injur3^ In close plantings with a view to the ultimate removal of the 
superfluous trees, it must be remembered that by the time the major- 
ity has been removed the remaining trees will not have attained the 
size they would if given the proper distance at first. In places, there- 
fore, where intermediate crops will prove profitable it will be prefera- 
ble to give the trees the benefit of the greater distance at the first 
planting. Thus the largest-growing varieties should be given 50 to 60 
feet, smaller or medium size 40 feet, and the smallest varieties 25 feet 
or even less, the Brunswick and Brown Turkey, for instance, being 
varieties which would thrive as long as they last with a distance of 
20 feet. 

The above refers only to fig plantations in districts where the trees 
attain their fullest development, such as in California, Arizona, in 
some of the' Southern States, and in northern Mexico, etc. For locali- 
ties where the fig tree can be raised only under difficulties no general 
rule can be given. For further information reference must be had 
to the respective places in this treatise where the various fig districts 
are discussed. The relative growth of the different varieties of figs 
is mentioned as far as known in the general catalogue of figs, and by 
consulting it some ideas can be formed of the distances to be given in 
the orchard. 



PLANTING A FlG ORCHARD. 155 

DISTANCES FOR CAPRIFIGS. 

The caprifig should always be planted closer than the edible figs. 
Ten or twelve feet apart each way is suitable, or the trees may be 
planted in the form of hedges around the main fig orchard. The most 
economical way is to crowd the caprifig trees into waste and otherwise 
worthless places where no plowing is required or need be done. The 
caprifig should be grown " wild." It should never be pruned, and had 
best be grown as a "thicket." The caprifig wasps require shade; 

CARE OF FIG TREES BEFORE PLANTING. 

Perhaps none of the operations pertaining to the planting of a fig 
orchard is of so much importance as the handling and care of the fig 
trees before they are set. A fig tree after it is dug up and before it is 
reset is more tender than almost any other kind of fruit tree, except 
the olive and the citrus trees. As a general thing it must be borne in 
mind that when once the roots of a fig tree have become injured by 
drying or sweating they had better be cut off and the remainder of 
the tree treated as a cutting. A cutting will always grow better than 
a fig tree with injured roots. *The planter should therefore satisfy 
himself when he buys trees that these have had the proper care, and 
that they have not been exposed to sun and wind for more than five 
minutes. This can be prevented easily by covering the fig trees in the 
field with sacking or blankets, which should be kept wet or damp. 
As soon as the trees have been received from the nursery they should 
be heeled in, and care should be taken that the soil is moist, as dry 
soil will quickly kill the trees. It is always advisable to heel in the 
trees close to a ditch, or close to water, and if a ditch or reservoir is 
handy the tree bundles should be immersed before the ropes are cut 
and the bundles opened. The trees can profitably rest in the water 
overnight if necessar3\ In heeling in all ropes should be cut and the 
trees spread in the trench in such a way that the soil thrown in will 
surround all the roots, not leaving passages for the wind, or perhaps 
sun, to enter and dry the trees. Even if the intention is to plant in a 
few days this mode of heeling in should be followed. Heeled-in trees 
should be watered and the soil kept firm. If planting is delayed and 
the trees have become somewhat dry, which can best be ascertained 
by examining the end buds, the trees should be at once taken out, 
immersed in water for six or twelve hours, and heeled in very slanting 
and deep and covered with soil to near the tops ; but care should be 
taken not to cover the tops entirely, as this may cause the trees to 
rot and will prevent examination of the buds. 

If fig trees show signs of starting they may be kept back by expos- 
ing to the wind for a few minutes in the shade and again heeled in. 
This operation, if performed properly, is not dangerous and is quite 
effective, but it should not be done except in emergency, as the trees 
will of course suffer to some extent. 



156 THE b^ig: it8 history, culture, and curing. 

PREPARING THE SOIL. 

The preparation of the ground for the future fig orchard differs in 
nothing from the most approved methods used for ordinary orchard 
lands. The more thoroughly the ground is prepared the less will be 
the cost of driving stakes, digging holes, and setting the trees, as well 
as the final irrigation in dry localities. When irrigation is necessary 
the work on the ground begins with leveling the land. - It will greatlj'^ 
cheapen after-culture if this leveling is carefully done. In order to 
ascertain that this has been done there is no better test than to irri- 
gate the ground before the trees are planted. The soft places will 
then settle and may be filled in again. Even if irrigation in furrows is 
contemplated, the surface should be level enough for flooding, in order 
to insure an equal quantity of water to every tree and to save water 
and economize labor. After the trees are planted no leveling of the 
soil can be properly done. Ten dollars more per acre spent in leveling 
before planting will save perhaps $10 to $20 yearly afterwards, besides 
insuring an even growth to all the trees. In places where no irriga- 
tion is nee<led some attention should still be given to the preparation 
of the surface, both to prevent stagnant water during the rainy season 
and to cheapen and facilitate the yearly working of the soil. 

After leveling is done the plowing should begin as soon as the sur- 
face is properly dry. On no account attempt to plow when too wet 
or when too dry. The dry soil when turned under is liable to come 
in direct contact with the roots of the trees and cause them to dry 
out. The soil when turned over should break up finely, neither form- 
ing dry clods nor wet cakes. The soil when turned up must be moist, 
and the soil immediately below the plow should be yet moister, but 
not soggy. 

In plowing, the team should not be made to go all around the field, 
plowing toward the center, as this will leave two streaks of hard soil 
diagonally across the field in the shape of a Greek cross. The proper 
way is to plow the field in separate lands, from one boundary line to 
the other, making the turning always in the road which surrounds the 
land or field, and not in the land. In this way no hard soil will be 
left unplowed, and when the plowing is over the whole ground will 
be found plowed in parallel furrows. The harrowing should be 
done in the same way, but in the opposite direction, and the turning 
should be made on the land. Two or three harrowings will not be too 
much, as the more the surface is harrowed and pulverized the better 
will its condition be for receiving the trees and the cheaper will be 
the final operations of the planting. 

In districts where the fig flourishes most and gives the best fruit 
no irrigation Is needed, and consequently the surface of the ground 
does not need to be level. Still it is of great importance that It should 
be sufficiently level to shed all water that may come by rain or flood. 



PLANTING A FIG ORCHARD. 157 

There should be no low places in which pools may form. All such 
should be filled in and leveled sufficiently to prevent stagnant water 
remaining. Such low places will prevent and retard plowing, cause 
weeds to grow, delay work generally, or they may even cause the trees 
to tip over and rot. Hills and knolls are not objectionable, provided 
the trees find sufficient moisture to bear good fruit, but low and 
soggy places should be carefully avoided, as they will prove of great 
detriment for years and be a constant expense, annoyance, and eye- 
sore. . 

This, of course, refers only to the planting of regular orchards, where 
thorough culture is necessary. 

Points to be considered in preparing the soil : 

(1) Freedom from low or stagnant water holes. 

(2) Even slope, so as to shed water. 

(3) Deep plowing and freedom from hard places left unplowed, 
accomplished by plowing in parallel lands. 

(4) Do not plow under any very dry soil. 

(»5) Harrow repeatedly immediately after plowing. 

STAKING AND SQUARING THE FIELD. 

As soon as the land is in proper condition to receive the trees, the 
placing of the stakes is in order. Through experience it is found that 
the planting can be done quicker and more cheaply if the stakes are 
set previous to digging the holes for the trees. No holes should be 
dug nor trees planted until all the stakes are set. In this wb,j any 
error can be remedied without redigging and resetting, and perfect 
lines may be had throughout the orchard. The extra expense in 
marking an orchard in this way is ijot great and will, it is thought, be 
more than repaid in better and quicker work and by a larger percent- 
age of living trees. If a very large orchard is to be planted it will 
pay to have an experienced surveyor set parallel rows of stakes across 
the field, about 200 feet apart, between which the farm hands may after- 
wards set the remainder of the stakes without error. When no sur- 
veyor can be found the following rules will lead to the desired result: 
The first work is to square the ground — that is, to mark out the bound- 
aries of the field in such a way that the opposite sides become abso- 
lutely^ parallel, and, if possible, form a right angle (90 degrees) with 
the other two parallel sides. If roads surround the place, and make 
right angles with one another, then it is necessary that the rows of 
trees should also foim right angles with one another. If no important 
roads are found, or will probably be necessary in the future, then it 
is only required that the rows running in one direction should be par- 
allel, as a small deviation from the right angle will not be seen, or if 
noticed will not prove to be a detriment. 

The operation begins by first setting a row of lath along one side of 



158 



THE fig: its HISTOBY, CULTUEE, AND CURING. 



the field, on the boundary of the orchard, or at least parallel to the 
boundary. By referring to the diagram (fig. 29) we should begin at 
A and set the stakes to B. This line should coincide with the first 
row of trees nearest the road. Then go back to A and set another 
row of stakes to C, this point being the extremity of the field in that 
direction. This row A-C should be at right angles with A-B if possi- 
ble; if not, it should be parallel to the road at the end of the orchard. 
A small level, combined with a compass, is the best and simplest 
instrument to aid in laying out an orchard. Even without the level 
the correct lines may be laid out, but this requires a little more labor. 
After the point C has been found, begin at C and set a line of stakes, 
C-D, parallel to A-B. For this purpose the compass on a tripod 
should be used in order to get the point D at least approximately cor- 
rect. The next work is to go back to B and set the line B-D parallel

to A-C. The point D is the only difficult point to set, and xipon the 
correct location of this point depends the lining of the trees. After 
the point D is approximately fixed, it is necessary to measure from B 
to D in order to ascertain if the distance is the sam^ as from A to C, 
and similarly to measure from C to D to see if this distance is the 
same as that from A to B. If both the lines B-D and C-D are longer 
than parallels A-C and A-B, respectively, then the point D must be 
moved toward the center of the field, but if the above lines are shorter 
than these respective parallels, then the point D must be moved away 
from the center of the field. If B-D is shorter than A-C at the same 
time that C-D is longer than A-B, then the point D must be moved 
toward C. If, on the contrary, C-D is shorter than A-B at the same 
time that B-D is longer than A-C, then the point D is to be moved 
toward B. As the whole orchard depends upon this point D, it will 



PLANTING A FIG ORCHARD. 159 

be profitable even to spend a day or two, if necessary, in order to 
locate it correctly. * In all measurements begin at A and measure 
toward B or C. Or from C measure toward D, or from B toward 
D. If this rule is not followed absolutely the trees can not be 
made to line. When at last the point D is correctly located, A-C 
should be of the same length as B-D, and A-B of the same length as 
C-D. If the trees are to be in exact squares the angles at the 
respective corners at A, B, C, and D must be right angles. In fixing 
these preliminary points it is not necessary, nor indeed of advantage, 
to set many stakes. Three or four stakes in a line will be enough. 

Next in order is to set the final stakes, one for each tree. Common 
lath is the best and easiest material to handle and procure for stakes. 
If the soil is in proper condition it is not necessary to point the laths. 
If the ground is hard and the stakes require to be driven, it may be 
necessary to sharpen the lath, but the points should be in the center 
of the lath, or as close to it as possible. Some, to save time, point 
the laths by cutting them diagonally across, but this is not proper, as 
in driving a lath thus pointed it will inevitably be shoved out of its 
place and get out of line. The sides of the points must be of equal 
length in order to insure accuracy. But in proper soil no points are 
required. Laths which are not pointed may be more readily used for 
other purposes aft^erwards. 

Go back to A and stretch the staking cable from A toward C, and, 
measuring from A, set a lath perpendicularly every 50 feet (or less) 
toward C. A lath will thus be set at each small circle on the diagram. 
Similarly set laths from A to B and from B toward D and from C 
toward D. If the planting chain does not reach from A to B it will 
be necessary to set another base line of stakes between E and F, and 
possibly also between J and H. The next step is easily understood. 
By stretching the chain or cable between the opposite points and 
setting laths every 50 feet, the whole field will be quickly staked out. 

In setting the laths two points are to be constantly remembered. 
The laths in the same row should all face the same way; all should 
be set on the same side of the cable — the side from which the cable is 
to 1)0 moved. In the accompanying diagram it will be seen that the 
field was not square, nor its sides exactly parallel. The space out- 
side of G, K, and L may be filled out, where the room admits, with 
trees. On this diagram eight outside trees are possible. This filling 
out is done by sighting, as being the simplest way. In setting the 
stakes, always set the outside end stakes first and fill in afterwards, 
as in no other way can the line be made straight without the aid of a 
good surveyor's level. 

The laths should be driven down with a hatchet deep enough to be 
entirely solid and immovable by wind. Loosely driven laths will be 
disarranged with astonishing facility. A small opera glass or field 
glass will be of great use while driving the lath. For this operation

it takes at least two meu — one to sight and one to drive and carry the 
laths. The sighter stands at one end of the line or row while the driver 
begins his work at the farther end. The driver holds first the lath 
perpendicularly over the mark on the cable, if there is one, and the 
sighter makes a sign with his hand indicating whether the lath is to 
be moved to the left or to the right, and when in line with the farther 
lath the sighter makes a sign of approval. The driver always works 
toward the sighter, not from him.

distance the plants are apart in the rows, and the product will be the number of 
square feet for each plant or hill, which, divided into the number of feet in an 
acre (43,560), will give the number of plants or trees to the acre.

DIGGING THE HOLES. 



The stakes which have been set with so much care ought not be 
disturbed until all the trees in one field have been planted. Before 
digging the holes, the field should be gone over carefully in order to 
ascertain if all the stakes are in line. When all stakes or laths line 
in every direction without deviating an inch anyWhere, the field is 
ready for the diggers. 

If the orchard is of any considerable size, a digger should be made 
to keep his row and put his mark on the end lath, in order that it 
may be readily ascertained who dug the row. Whether done by con- 
tract or by the day, this is a useful practice, the diggers soon learning 
to be careful. The first move is to give the stake a sharp stroke with 



PLAl^Tma A ^IG OUCHAl^D. 161 

« 
a flat face of the spade in order to drive it solidly in the soil. The 
hole is next dug on the side of the stake, close to the narrow edge of 
the lath. If, for instance, the first hole is dug on the east side of the 
lath, every succeeding hole must similarly be dug on the east side of 
every lath, otherwise the holes will not line with one another. As to 
the size of the holes, no general rule can he followed. The hole 
should never be larger than necessary to admit all the roots in their 
proper position. As far as the experience of the writer goes, a hole 
18 inches deep by 2 feet wide will answer in most cases for all trees, 
as few trees from the nursery will have more spreading roots than 
this. However, the proper way is to first ascertain the length of the 
roots, both horizontally and vertically, and then dig the holes accord- 
ingly. A square hole is better than a round hole, as it enables the 
planter to so turn the tree that any extra long root may be spread out 
in the angles of the hole. In irrigation districts the hole does not 
need to be larger than to admit the roots. Actual experiments have 
proven that larger holes are not needed. Trees planted in very large 
holes, 4 feet square, did not grow better than trees set in holes of just 
sufficient size to admit the roots. In fact the shallow hole is better, 
because with subsequent irrigation the soil in the larger hole sinks or 
settles, causing the tree to stand too low. Irrigation softens the soil 
sufficiently to enable even the smallest rootlets to easily penetrate the 
soil. 

In districts where no irrigation is required the hole may be made 
deeper in order to give soft soil to the lower roots, but in no case does 
it need to be wider than the spread of the roots. In such localities it 
is desirable to cause the roots to go down, but not to spread on the 
surface. 

In digging, the top soil should be put in a small pile separate from 
the bottom soil. The latter had better be scattered at once over the 
field, as it is desirable to use only top soil in filling in around the 
roots. The bottom of the hole should not be tapering or funnel- 
shaped, but square and flat. Few trees indeed have taproots. A 
funnel-shaped hole will also cause all the heavy ground or clods to 
collect in the center, where it is greatly in the way in planting trees. 
The soil in the bottom of the hole should be stirred, in order to pre- 
vent it from drying out before the tree is planted. 

PLANTING THE TREES. 

The sooner planting is done after the holes are dug the better it is 
for the trees. The habit of digging holes weeks or months before 
planting is to be greatly condemned, as it causes the holes to dry out and 
become lined with a crust of dry and hard soil, which must be removed 
before the trees are set. The first operation in planting is to examine 
the trees in order to ascertain if the buds, wood, or rootlets are shrivel- 
ing. Whether this be the case or not it is of great advantage to immerse 



162 THE fig: its history, culture, and curing. 

the fig trees in running water, or at least in fresh water, overnight, 
previous to planting the following day. If the stem and buds are 
plump the trees may, however, be planted at once. Previously to 
planting, the roots should be trimmed with a pair of very sharp shears. 
The large roots should be cut back until they show the milky sap 
freely, all moldy parts should be cut off, and all rootlets which give 
the least suspicion of being dry, or which do not show sap freely, 
should be taken off entirely. It is better to plant a fig tree without 
any roots than to plant it with dry roots, as in the latter case the tree 
will die back to the ground. In bringing the trees to the field they 
should be wrapped in wet sacking or blankets. One man should carry 
the bundles and distribute the trees for about four planters, going but 
one or two rows, but better only one row, ahead of them, sticking a 
tree in each hole in such a way thr-t as little sun as possible will strike 
the roots. If the sun is vory warm and the wind blowing it is nec- 
essary to have one distributer for each planter, as the success of 
the planting depends absolutely upon planting fig trees with moist 
roots. In some cases it mr^y be necessary even to carry a tank of 
water in the field and dip the fig roots before planting. In moist and 
cloudy weather no cuch extra precautions are necessary. It must be 
always remembered that it is cheaper to be extra careful in the first 
planting than to replant the following season. Few trees are as ten- 
der as fig trees, but with proper care no appreciable loss is necessary. 

The mode of planting is to first fill in sufficiently with the top soil 
to form a small hill in the center of the hole. When placed upon it 
the fig tree should stand as deep in the hole as it stood in the ground 
in the nursery. The discoloration of the collar of the tree will show 
the former soil surface. The roots are then spread out and the tree 
turned so as to allow the Ion jer roots to spread naturally in the angles 
of the hole. By means of the guiding lath the trees are all placed the 
same distance from the lathe at the edge of the holes, and if this is done 
with precision the trees when planted will all be in exact line. 

The roots aro t?ien filed r.round with fresh surface soil taken from 
the vicinity of the tree. If the ground is in proper condition the soil 
will be f OUT! 1 moist an inch or two below the surface. This soil is 
used for filling. The soil is not to be shoved down bj'^ the spadeful on 
the roots, but gently shaken in by means of light jerks of the shovel 
or spade. It requires two men to plant — one to hold the tree in place 
and arrange the soil about the roots by means of a short stick, and 
one to shovel the soil and do the final tamping. In small plantings 
the distributer of the trees may be dispensed with and the trees in 
their wraps may be carried by the man who does not carry the shovel. 

The soil should be tramped as hard around the roots as possible; 
the whole weight of the body as well as force should be applied on 
the soil. The hole should be filled in level with the surface, and in 
very rainy weather may be heaped, so as to cause the water to run off. 



PLANTING A FIG ORCHARD. 163 

After the hole is nearly filled some loose soil sEould be thrown on top, 
in order to serve as a mulch. In very dry seasons the trees may be 
set a little lower than the ground and a small basin left around the 
trunk. The advantages of this system are many. It insures correct- 
ness in lining the trees, as the positions of the laths indicate the exact 
places of the trees before planting; it obviates the filling in and redig- 
ging of holes if dug in the wrong place; it makes the pulling out and 
resetting of trees unnecessary; it is a quicker and simpler method 
than the old one of using the guide board with one peg on each side 
of the hole, and, finally, it is a cheaper method than any other in use 
which insures absolute accuracy. 

PLANTING CUTTINGS IN THE ORCHARD. 

The planting of cuttings directly in the orchard differs but little 
from planting the trees. The same method should be f-ollowed, but 
the holes should be deep enough to suit a very large cutting. Such 
cuttings are the best to plant out, as they are more able than small 
cuttings to care for themselves. The cuttings should be allowed to 
protrude only a few inches above the soil, and in times of very dry 
and warm weather even the top may be covered with a small amount 
of soil to prevent drying out. 

PLANTING TO AVOID SPLITTING THE TRUNK. 

The fig tree is more liable to split than any other of our fruit trees. 
Pruning may greatlj'^ obviate this evil, but a much better way and, 
in the opinion of the writer, the only proper way to prevent fig trees 
splitting is to plant two cuttings in the same hole, the cuttings cross- 
ing each other in the- center of the hole. This method has been 
employed in Smyrna for this reason, and also in France, with a slightly 
different object in view. The effect of such planting may be seen at 
once, as the only branches that split off from a fig tree are those which 
are too heavy for the tenacity of the wood. While the branches never 
break off entirely, they split from the main stem and always injure the 
tree, and often ruin it. 

The more upright the fig trunk, the greater the pressure of the 
limbs and the more readily will they split off. The less horizontal and 
the more downward sloping the branch, the less it is apt to split away 
from the trunk. By setting two trees or two cuttings in one hole, 
with the tops a short distance apart, the two trees or trunks resulting 
from them will lean outward, away from each other, and so will all 
their branches. The effect will be that none of them will ever split 
away. In course of time the two trees will grow together at the base 
and form one large tree of the same form as that possessed by a wild 
fig tree, which is after all the most suitable shape that can be given a 
fig tree. In planting in this manner the tree or cuttings should be

164 THE fig: its history, culture, and curing. 

mad^ to cross each other in the hole a little below the soil. This will 
give a greater inclination to the main trunks, which is just what is 
desired. In training such trees after planting very little labor is 
required. The trunks will bend out by themselves, and the branches 
of each tree will complement one another and form one uniform head 
or crown. No pruning is necessary, except to cut out some branches 
which grow too closely together. The interior branches will be com- 
paratively very few, and the principal limbs will grow outward. 
Such trees require less pruning than those planted in the regular or 
orthodox way, as they will shape and care for themselves. This 
mode of planting should be adopted for all fig orchards. P'ig trees 
destined to give shade in avenues and ornamental grounds may, how- 
ever, be set singly. 

care of trees after planting. 

Whether the recently set fig trees should be irrigated or not must 
depend upon circumstances. If the soil be moist, irrigation should 
be postponed until necessary. The trees should be inspected every 
two or three days. When in proper condition the buds and the top 
branches should be plump and the outside scales of the buds should 
be full of sap if punctured or broken. If any of them show dryness, 
water should be applied at once, and if, after irrigation, no improve- 
ment is seen within a day, there is no alternative but to cut the trees 
back to the point where they will bleed freely. If, after being cut 
back, the tree shows signs of continuing to dry, it should be cut back 
close to the surface of the soil, in order that a shoot may be encour- 
aged to start up and form a new tree. This cutting back to the 
ground may prove an heroic measure, but it nearly always has the 
desired effect of causing new shoots to form below the soil, whereas if 
a drying tree be allowed to remain unpruned it will generally die. 
Much complaint is heard from planters about fig trees dying, and 
many prefer on this account to set out cuttings instead of trees. But 
if this system of heavy pruning back is adopted at the first sign of 
drying the loss will be greatly redticed. 

If the fig tree has been planted for shade and when it is desirable, 
if possible, to save the standard, this can often be done by closely 
covering the tree with sacking and excluding as much wind as pos- 
sible and all the sun. It is wonderful how a sickly tree will recover 
if properly shaded and evaporation prevented. This process is appli- 
cable also to citrus tr^es and olives, and indeed to all evergreen trees. 
By watering or sprinkling the covering morning and evening the 
evaporation of the sap is considerably retarded. The roots should be 
kept moist, but not wet, for if too wet they will rot. After every 
irrigation the soil should be dug up and pulverized around the roots 
in order to admit the necessary air to the roots, as well as for acting 
as a mulch. The practice of mulching the trees with fresh yellow 
straw is to be condemned, as the reflection from the straw causes the 



PLANTING A FIG C>RCHARD. 165 

8un to scald the bark of the tree. If straw is used at all it should 
be in conjunction with a tree protector of some kind — paper, sacking, 
or stakes, in order that the stem may be properly shaded. 

DURATION OP PLANTATION. 

The edible fig is known to have become several hundred years old, 
and it bears full crops for one hundred years or more. It is therefore 
hardly worth the while to consider the duration of a fig orchard, as it 
will last for two generations or more, and during this time will give 
an abundance of fruit. However, after a certain time it may prove 
of advantage to renew the trees, much depending on the way the trees 
have been treated and upon the soil in which they have grown. Some 
varieties wiU last longer than others and some produce their best fruit 
before they attain thirty years. 

VARIETIES TO PLANT. 

As regards varieties little can be said. Too little is known con- 
cerning the nature and adaptability of certain varieties to localities. 
No one should plant extensively until it has been fully ascertained 
that the variety selected is suited to the locality. In places where 
there are no experimental orchards it will naturally take some time 
to find the proper variety. Among common figs there are, however, 
several varieties wliich will probably do well in many localities. 
Such varieties are, for instance, **Le Roi" and "Marseillaise White." 
Among the true Smyrna varieties none is superior to Lop Ingir, the 
true fig of commerce. But even this variety is in places superseded 
by other kinds better suited to local conditions Whatever variety 
of Smyrna fig is planted it is of great importance to plant onty 
a single variety, or at least to have enough of every variety to 
produce a large lot of uniform figs. An orchard of mixed fig vari- 
eties is troublesome and unprofitable. As the figs must be picked 
up all over the orchard from under the trees as soon as they drop 
to the ground it is impracticable to keep the varieties apart if 
there be more than one kind of fig. Where the varieties are mixed 
grafting will be necessary, and this will put back the trees and 
the crop from three to four years after the error in planting has been 
discovered. Of caprifigs as many varieties as possible should be set 
out in order to have a succession of figs. When it has been once 
established which variety is best suited to a certain Ibcality, one or 
two varieties may suflfice. The caprifig trees should be set by them- 
selves in sheltered corners of the orchard. There is needed about 
one caprifig tree to every ten Smyrna fig trees. 

CULTIVATION. 

The cultivation of the fig orchard requires no implements which 
are not also useful in any other orchard. On the Pacific coast the 
orchards are now almost exclusively worked with horse power. In 



166 THE fig: its history, culture, and curing. 

orchard culture riding two-horse sulky plows are generally used. 
Such plows have one or two shares or shovels, and are so adjustable 
that the shovels may be thrown close to the trunks of th0 trees. This 
can only be done while the trees are young, or where they are raised 
to medium standard high. In the smaller orchards smaller cultiva- 
tors are used, the driver walking behind. Except in a few places so 
situated that horses can not be used to advantage, all the work done 
in our orchards and nurseries is done with plows and cultivators for 
two and four horses. 

In the cultivation of the ground we should remember that the better 
the soil is cultivated the better will be the fruit. The first plowing 
should be done in the fall, immediately after the first rains, or in early 
spring. If the plowing is delaj'ed to January, weeds, which by this 
time will have started everywhere, can be plowed under to advantage. 
Early plowing will facilitate the absorption of the rains. The plowing 
begins between the trees, the soil being thrown to the center. It is 
important that the bark of the trees should never be the least injured 
by running against it with the singletree. In order to avoid this 
injury the regular iron couplings may be superseded by couplings 
made of leather, which will slide smoothly over the bark without 
bruising it. When the trees become too large even to admit this, the 
center of the land is plowed with a sulky plow while the outside of 
the land nearer the trees is finished with a single plow. One single 
plowing is generally enough each year. Still one or more plowings 
afterwards may benefit the soil. There is no danger in cutting the 
roots of the trees, the cutting of surface roots being beneficial rather 
than otherwise, as it causes the roots of the tree to strike downward. 
Many orchardists follow the first plowing with a harrow. This is 
required only in places where the soil breaks up in clods. Where the 
soils turns up soft and mellow it is necessary only to follow the plow- 
ing with cultivation. The cultivator should be run both lengthwise 
and crosswise through the orchard after every heavy spring rain or 
after every irrigation, if such is practiced. The soil should never be 
allowed to bake or form a top crust. If the soil in the orchard is 
cultivated by a sulky cultivator three times or more during the sum- 
mer it will not be necessary to plow against the trees at any time, as 
the soil naturally tends to level itself. But if cultivation is neglected, 
it is necessary to plow against the trees every other year or every 
other plowing. It is of the utmost importance that the soil under the 
trees should be loose and mellow. If hard and lumpy, the figs will be 
bruised when they fall ripe from the trees. If the soil is loose the 
figs are not injured by the fall. It may be necessary to plow furrows in 
the orchard for irrigation. Such furrows should always be as far 
from the trees as possible, their distance to be regulated according to 
the age and size of the trees. It may be necessary to use some hand 
work in the orchard when the trees come in bearing. This work is 
generally confined to loosening the soil immediately around the trunks

of the trees aud raking away the large clods so as to leave as smooth 
a soil as possible for the figs to drop on. 

THE CREATION OF A FIG ORCHARD IN CALIFORNIA. 

During the first period of fig raising in California and the other 
Pacific States — Arizona, Sonora, and Baja California, the latter two 
situated in Mexico — no special attention was given to the care and 
creation of a fig orchard. During the second period, when the early 
immigrants arrived in California and brought with them cuttings of 
figs from their homes in Italy, Greece, and Spain, some little attention 
was paid to the cultivation of the fig, especially for the purpose of 
supplying the market with the fresh fruit. It is only now, during the 
third period of the fig industry, after the introduction of the Blasto- 
phaga wasps by the United States Government, that more attention 
and care is bestowed on the fig. For the reader who desires to have 
a summary of the operations and processes necessary to create a fig 
orchard on the Pacific coast the following resume may be of interest: 

The first move is to select the site for the orchard, and upon its 
proper location depends the future success. The first condition to be 
considered is the absence of frosts during the spring, when the trees 
are in active growth. The second condition refers to the nature of 
the soil, its quality, drainage, facilities for irrigation, etc., points 
which have already been referred to more or less. Taking it all in 
all, deep mesa or table-lands are the most suitable to produce first- 
class figs in quantities that will pay. An atmosphere that is too dry 
is almost as bad as one that is too moist. Our river-bottom lands are 
ideal places, provided they are not subject to spring frosts. In such 
places the mesa lands surrounding the river bottoms are the best. In 
some localities it is necessary to go to the second mesas or table-lands 
in order to find the most desirable locality. The land should, if pos- 
sible, be summer fallowed, in order to take up readily the first rain in 
the autumn. After the first rain the land should be plowed as deeply 
as possible, and a final cultivation should be made just before the 
planting. The deeper the soil is plowed and the more mellow it is, 
the cheaper will be the planting. After the last cultivation the land 
should be dragged with a wooden drag made of boards and loaded 
down with sand bags or stones. 

The best time for planting is immediately after the first frost in the 
fall, or, if there is no frost, after the leaves of the fig trees have fallen. 
This is in December on the Pacific coast, earlier or later according to 
the season. The best success is always had from early planting, and 
in soils where early planting is not practicable it is advisable not to 
plant figs to any great extent. After the land is dragged, the first 
step is to stake the ground in the manner described elsewhere. The 
stakes may be set from 25 to 50 feet apart, according to the object in 
view. If 25 feet is decided on, it will not be advisable to grow any

168 THE fig: its history, culture, and curing. 

intermediate crop, except during the first year or two. If 40 to 50 feet 
is adopted as the distance, intermediate crops may be grown for many 
years, until the trees are 10 to 12 years old. In places where. the land 
is very valuable intermedii^te crops are desirable, otherwise the greater 
distance is to be recommended at once. The trees or cuttings should 
be entirely fresh; if not, they should be soaked up in water until they 
show fresh sap when cut. Generally only one tree is set in each hole, 
but we have in another place recommended that two trees or two cut- 
tings be planted in the same hole, 6 or more inches apart, in order 
to prevent splitting of limbs or trunk. If cuttings are set, they should 
be at once covered with soil in such a manner that the upper surface 
of the cutting is just below the soil surface, the soil thus forming a 
small hill around the cutting, which need not be more than 6 inches 
above the general level of the ground. If trees are set, they should at 
once be cut back to within a foot of the ground and then covered with 
soil in the same manner. If the trees are left higher, they should be 
covered entirely with flag, tule, or straw matting, in order to be pro- 
tected from sun, wind, or drought generally. If irrigation is prac- 
ticed, the trees should be irrigated at once, except in case of heavy rain. 

The next" step is to watch the young trees or cuttings and see that 
they do not dry out. This watching should be done every three or 
four days. Uncover the soil and cut the bark; if sap exudes the cut- 
ting is all right; if no sap comes out, irrigation is needed at once. In 
case of trees which show dry tops, these latter should be at once and 
without hesitation cut back to flowing sap. A pair of shears are just 
as useful as a knife. With a certain knack in handling the shears the 
bark is not sufficiently bruised to injure the tree. 

After the trees have started and sent out shoots several inches long 
it is time to take away the soil raised around the tree or cutting. It 
is not a good idea to cover the cutting with straw or manure, as it con- 
tains seeds which will germinate. It is hardly necessary to state that 
at no time should there be anything growing within 4 feet of the 
young plant. A space of 6 feet is preferable on each side of the tree. 

The number of times the fig should be irrigated varies according to 
locality and season. The only guide is to observe the terminal bud. If 
this bud shows a stoppage in growth it is a sign that the tree needs 
water. After September no more growth is desirable. After heavy 
irrigations the land should be cultivated, and in no instance should it 
be allowed to bake around the tree. The weeds in the orchard are 
kept down either with two-horse cultivators or with underground cut 
drags. The latter consist simply of a drag or cultivator, furnished 
with a long horizontal knife several inches wide. This knife runs a 
few inches below the soil surface and cuts the roots of all weeds in 
the most effective manner. 

As a rule no pruning is required during the first year or two; the 
trees are allowed to branch from the very ground. Trees that are 
raised to a standard of 3 or 4 feet, as is generally the rulfe, even in 



PLANTING A ma OBCHARD. 169 

the best orchards, are always at a disadvantage. The branches 
should be low and the trees should be as shady as possible. 

After the first year the plowing and cultivation goes on very miich 
as during the first year. The first plowing is done when the weeds in 
the orchard have attained some little siae. This is generally in Jan- 
uary. At that time the orchard is plowed in such a manner that the 
soil is thrown from the trees toward the center of the land. Later 
on one, two, or three cultivations, with two or four horse teams, are 
made crosswise and lengthwise to the first plowing. By the end of the 
season the land will generally be found to be quite level. Next year 
the first plowing is made crosswise to the plowing of the previous year^ 
and so on. One plowing and three cultivations are generally suffi- 
cient each year. The plowing should be as deep as possible and not 
less than 6 or 8 inches, in order to prevent the formation of roots too 
near the surface. As regards irrigation the same rule holds good as 
the first year. The end buds must be watched and be kept growing 
until September, or until the crop is harvested. No pruning is 
required except keeping the trees in form, cutting dead wood and 
crossing branches, as has been described in its proper place. 

The caprifig trees are the first which require the attention of the 
orchardist. In the second year they will bear some caprifigs, and these 
should then be caprificated. Caprifigs containing Blastophaga wasps 
should be procured from the nurseryman who supplied the trees or 
from some other grower. The first caprification is done in the spring 
(probably in the end of March, when the mamme figs from older trees 
are suspended in the caprifigs), provided they have no insectiferous 
mamme of their own. The insects soon hatch out and enter the capri- 
figs of the young trees. If from that time on there is such a succes- 
sion of the three crops of the caprifigs that these crops overlap each 
other in a proper manner, no further caprification is necessary, as the 
blastophaga wasps will take care of themselves. But in case there is 
found to be a considerable lapse between the profichi and the mam- 
moni — first and second crops — then a new caprification of the mam- 
moni will be necessary, and, similarly, if there is a lapse between the 
mammoni and the mamme, then the latter — the third crop — requires 
to be caprificated with figs introduced from some other place. In 
order to have such a succession of crops of caprifigs it is desirable to 
plant many kinds of caprifigs, as has been already pointed out. It is 
highly desirable that the cultivator caprify his caprifig trees as soon 
as they begin to bear, in order to acquaint himself with the nature of 
the process of caprification. It may be possible that he will have to 
caprificate his caprifig trees every year as long as he cultivates Smyrna 
figs, and not only once a year, but several times a year; in fact, once 
for every crop. But this supposition is an extreme one. If he has a 
proper number of good varieties of caprifig trees, it is probable that 
the wasps will take care of themselves, and that there will always be 
figs ready to use in caprificating the Smyrna varieties. 



17© THE fig: its history, oultube, and cubing. 

When the Smyrna varieties come into bearing they are caprificated 
for the first time in June or July by the profichi or first crop of the 
caprifigs. The insectif erous figs are suspended among the branches 
of the Smyrna figs at an interval of ten days or two weeks. Aft-er 
this has been done no more caprification of the edible figs is neces- 
sary that year. A month or more later the figs begin to ripen, and 
then drop to the ground. The Smyrna figs are never picked from the 
trees, because when they are fully ripe they fall of their own accord. 
If they do not fall they are not fully ripe. The figs are picked up 
every day and placed on traj'^s to drj^ in the sun. They are turned 
once or twice and then taken to the warehouse and sheds, where they 
are dipped and packed. 

As regards fertilizing the soil, this practice is not yet in vogue m 
California fig orchards. Manuring the soil will of course be benefi- 
cial in the highest degree in places where the soil is poor. Powdered 
sheep manure, ground bone, stable manure, and artificial fertilizers 
will all be used in time. But before everything else lime is most to 
be recommended, as experience has shown that the best figs are grown 
on lime soil. 

period of vegetation. 

The edible fig {Ficuscarica) is a deciduous tree, which drops its leaves 
even in tropical countries where no frost exists. It never becomes 
an evergreen tree. In temperate climates, where moisture in the soil 
is overabundant, a very rank growth will be caused, especially with 
young trees under 4 or 5 years old. This growth, which continues 
until cool weather, is liable to get frosted, to the great detriment 
of the tree. But even if not checked by frost, this growth would 
soon stop by itself and the tree would become semidormant or almost 
dormant. There are, however, many wild-fig species which are 
evergreen, especially in the tropics. Others are semievergreen — ^that 
is, they preserve a few evergreen leaves at the top after the majority 
of the leaves have fallen. Other tropical species are doubly decidu- 
ous — that is, they drop their leaves twice a year, at the end of the 
rainy and at the end of the dry season, only to clothe themselves with 
new foliage after a rest of two to three weeks. The caprifig tree is a 
deciduous tree. 

The fig tree begins to bear well at about the fourth year, but 
increases its yield rapidly until 12 to 14 years old. After that time 
the increase is slower, and after thirty or forty y^ars no great 
increase can be expected. However, different varieties act differ- 
ently, and there are off years when smaller crops are had. The 
variation in this respect relates rather to the first crop, or "brebas," 
than to the second crop, or autumn figs. Undoubtedly the climatic 
conditions are more changeable in the spring, and thus the change is 
greater in the early crops than in the later ones. The critical period 
of the first crop is the time of setting, while of the later crop it is the 
time of maturity. 



CHAPTER VIII. 
PRTTNING FIGS. 

GENERAL REMARKS. 

The pruning of the fig tree must be regulated according to the age 
of the tree, as a j'^oung tree just planted must be pruned radically 
different from one which has been grown in the orchard a year or 
more. This remark refers only to the fig tree as grown in the semi- 
tropical regions and not to trees growing in more northern climates. 
The pruning of the latter will be remarked on under the headings of 
the districts where they grow. As a general rule the fig tree requires 
less pruning than does any other fruit tree grown in temperate cli- 
mates, except possibly some species of nut trees. Neglected cutting 
back of recently planted trees may be the indirect cause of their 
dying, while a cutting back of old trees may cause them to be bar- 
ren or to yield inferior crops for years. Still, a proper pruning for 
fig trees is necessary, both to young and old trees; but this pruning, 
although not less important, must be radically different from that 
accorded to other kinds of fruit. This refers especially to old bearing 
trees, as young fig trees may be pruned in almost any way without 
harm. 

PRUNING LATELY PLANTED TREES. 

All fig trees should be grown in such a manner that the foliage may 
be high enough above the ground to freely admit air and wind. Upon 
this depends not only the growth of the fig tree, but also the quality 
of the fig crop. Six feet to the lower limbs would be a good height to 
give a fig tree grown for fruit. This height may be given at once or 
gradually, and the first pruning should be done with the ultimate 
form in view. Many growers cut their fig trees back after planting 
to within a foot or so of the ground. This is a safe way, as the more 
the young trees are pruned back the surer they will grow. But this 
cutting back has at least one great disadvantage; it causes the side 
stems — the future standards — to come too close together, causing 
them to split off from the main trunk when in a few years they shall 
become sufficiently heavy. There are two ways to avoid this; one is 
to cut the tree at planting close to the ground and allow three differ- 
ent shoots to form the new standards. This is really the natural habit 
of the growth of the tree. All wild figs branch at the roots, and the 
different branches or standards in time grow together at the base, 

171 



172 THE fig: its history, culture, and curing. 

forming an enormously wide but very short trunk. Trees grown in 
this way are not apt to split. When fig trees are planted wide apart 
in the orchard, and for fruit alone, this several-standard system is con- 
sidered a good one. It differs somewhat from the general custom, 
but it agrees perfectly with the nature of the tree. How this is best 
accomplished by planting two cuttings in one hole has been explained. 
If a single standard from the soil is desired, the trees should if 
possible not be cut back at planting lower than 4 feet from the 
soil, or better yet, allowed to remain at 6 feet from the soil. Side 
branches should be encouraged at least 1 foot or more apart, in order 
that the crotches may not come close together. If the planted tree 
has several good side branches, cut back the top to the uppermost 
of these branches and cut out other branches, except those left for 
the main branches for the future head. All the smaller branches 
may be left to grow and the thinning out postponed to the next year, 
the object in leaving them being to enable the tree to shade itself as 
much as possible the first year. The side branches may be cut back 
if required, this cutting back doing no injury to the young tree. In 
after years, however, it can not be allowed, except under particular 
conditions — as, for instance, when it is desirable to balance an ill- 
shaped tree. This form is not suitable in the orchard. 

pruning bearing fig trees. 

As has already been stated, most fig trees suffer if their branches 
are cut squarely back. In all old fig-growing countries, even in 
England, the sayingtis: "A fig tree cut back will give no good crop." 
This has also been the experience in California, especially with heavy- 
growing kinds. The writer has known an instance where large 
fig trees which were cut back for cuttings did not again bear good 
figs, and several similar instances have been reported where for ten 
years the trees did not recover their producing power. After the first 
year, therefore, the fig trees should only be thinned out. Never cut 
back the fruit-bearing branches in such a way that the same branch 
can send out side shoots below the cut. If cutting be necessary in 
order to shape the tree, cut back to the fork in such a way that the 
whole branch will be cut off, either to the main trunk of the tree or to 
a main branch, and let it be remembered that the less heavily the fig 
tree is pruned the better for the bearing quality of the tree and the 
better for the quality of the fruit. 

When cut off squarely a branch sends out side branches from a 
number of eyes immediately below the cut and the end of the braneli 
will look somewhat like a brush. These side branches will interfere 
with one another and with other branches of the tree, and most of 
them must be cut away the following season in order to shape the 
tree and to admit air, light, and heat. But if the branch in question 
be cut off further down close to a fork the remaining branch of the 



PRUNING FIGS. 173 

fork with its terminal bud will lead off the sap and the brush-like 
formation will not take place. In other words, after a fig tree has 
been necessarily pruned every branchlet as well as every branch 
should possess a terminal bud in order that the new branch system 
may consist of fairly parallel branches. With this point steadily in 
view the next consideration will be that of pruning bearing trees. 

Unlike other fruit trees, the quality and size of the fig is not 
improved directly bj^ heavy pruning, except in cases where fig trees 
are grown in pots or against walls. A fig tree with many branches 
will bear as large and as fine fruit as a fig tree with few branches. 
Indeed, it will us a rule bear larger and better fruit. The object in 
pruning is therefore generallj^ not to increase the size and flavor of 
the fruit. Still, it can not be denied that the proper pruning of old 
and heavy growing fig trees will improve the quality of the fruit indi- 
rectl}^ though not exactly in the same way as in other fruits. 

The fig must be pruned in order to admit light, heat, and air, and 
to prevent crowding and bad shape and the interference with other 
crops grown among the trees. If the fig crop is the principal one the 
latter consideration must be secondary only. 

Heavy-growing fig trees, such as Adriatics, etc., produce better and 
larger figs if pruned; but this pruning must consist in simply cutting 
off the young year's wood whenever several branches start out too 
close together from the same limb. Thus in the above variety the 
young bearing wood should be at least 2 feet long, without side 
branches. All other twigs may be cut off close to the main branch, 
but never cut off squarelj^ or simply cut back. Only cut them off 
close to the mother branch, as the latter will then bear better and 
larger figs. 

The pruning of the fig when grown in the open should be confined 
to three or four distinct points. The sterile twigs generally found at 
the base of the main branches should be cut off each year. These 
twigs are generally bent downward, are slender, and seldom bear 
fruit. Larger as well as smaller branches which cross one another 
should be so cut out that no further interference is possible. The 
center of the tree in thick-growing varieties should be thinned out 
or cut entirely away in order to admit sun, air, and light. Lower 
branches too close to the ground should also be cut off close to the 
main stem or main branches; and finally, if a tree is unevenly bal- 
anced the branches on the larger side may be cut back in order to 
properly balance the tree. But in all these operations all cuts should 
be made to a fork and the cut branch should never be without a 
leader. And finally, in any heavy growing and bearing varieties the 
side branches of the. yearling wood may be cut off close to the stem. 
As to the time of pruning, the best time is when the leaves have 
fallen and the fig tree is most dormant. Some sap will always fiow, 
but the more dormant the tree the better. 



174 THE Fia: its history, oultube, and cubing. 

HIGH AND LOW STANDARD. 

The final question, whether high or low standards should be given 
to fig trees, must be entirely dependent upon climatic conditions and 
other circumstances. In moist ground the figs should have a high 
standard, in order to admit the necessary air and light, especially so 
in localities where the souring of the figs is a common evil. On the 
contrary, in places where moisture is scarce and where the figs may 
suffer from drought, the low standard should be adopted, with side 
branches sloping closer to the ground and shading the soil. Consid- 
eration should also be had for the variety, and as a general rule it 
may be said that figs for drying require higher standards than those 
grown for table only. The high standard may be considered at once 
when the trees are first set out, as has been already remarked, but a 
change from low to high standard may be readily accomplished later 
and gradually, without any great difficulty or injurj^ to the tree. In 
Smyrna the branches reach the ground within 3 or 4 feet, while from 
the main root three or more standards start out at sharp angles to the 
ground. 






CHAPTER IX. 
IBBIOATION IN FIO CTTLTTJBE. 

In localities where the rainfall is less than 25 inches during the 
rainy season irrigation is necessary. The fig tree, unlike most other 
trees, does not immediately show when it begins to suffer for want of 
water; at least it does not show it like other deciduous trees by the 
wilting and drooping of its leaves. In case the grower does not know 
when to supply water, the figs will be small and dry and be otherwise 
inferior. As soon as the fig tree begins to suffer from want of suffi- 
cient moisture in the soil it stops its g rowth. The terminal points of 
the branches will then suddenly cease to send out new leaves, and 
instead will begin to mature a bud. If this occurs during the grow- 
ing season it is a certain sign that the moisture has given out. In all 
localities where the figs can not keep on growing until the fruit matures 
irrigation must be resorted to. The rig ht amount of irr igation, the 
ti me to give it, and the proper way to lead t he water on the land must ^^ ^^^c % 
necessarily vary in different localities, and no rules applicable to all ^^a 
conditions can here be given. C-^ f^^ ^* 2^^ t^<ja,<^^ 

It may, however, be stated t hf^t the mo re water that can be given *Jv!Xcce| ^ 
at once th e dee per it jwill_smkjind the more the natural moisture will * U^ 
be imitated. Fr equent irrigation will create surface roots and tend ^ ^^ / 
to keep th e deeper yround drv. Flo oding is not r ecQginiended, except 
in winter, as the winds are liable to overturn the trees; besides, heavy 
watering in summer or growing time does not imitate the natural 
rainfall and those other conditions under which the fig tree develops 
its fruit to the best advantage and greatest perfection. So far as pos 
sible all irrigation sh ould be in the winter, when the effect upon the 
trees will be that of heavy rains only, provided no more water be ^ 

given tlian the tree requires. Stagnant water and irrigation ditches ^^ ^^]o u^ ^ 
do not tend to improve the fruit of the fig, and localities where such J^^^/^^" ^ 
water prevails are unsuited to all figs. *%< ^ ^ •"' ^ 

There are, however, a number of varieties which require moist 
ground in order to produce good fruit. This is the case especially 
with black varieties, which, with few exceptions, require more mois- 
ture than white figs. In the catalogue of figs at the end of this book 
the writer has noted the preference for moist or dry soil for all varieties 

as far as known.

CHAPTER X. 

DISEASES AND INSECT ENEMIES OF THE FIG. 

DROPPING OF THE FRUIT. 

Two distinct causes may effect the dropping of the figs before they 
are ripe. The most common of these causes is unfavora ble climatic 
conditions , either in general or in particular, for a certain variety. 
This climatic defect may consist in any condition that will temporarily 

f check the flow of sap to the figs. Cold nig hts, cold wind a, and light 
f rosts are eg d&lly as eitective in causing the dropping of the fruit as 
are excessive dryness and g j reat hea t. Wa nt of moisture frequently 
causes the fruit to drop or to develop poorl y and b ecome tas t eless , 
coarse, and unhealthy. In this case moderate irrigation mav be the 
remedy. Many varieties will always drop if raised in an unsuitable 
climate. In such cases there is no other remedy than to experiment 
with other varieties which may be suited to the climate. As numerous 
varieties of figs are originated under the most different conditions of 
temperature and moisture, there are enough varieties to suit almost 
every locality which can be at all favorable for fig culture. 
In old Roman times the dropping of the figs was a cause for great 
[t^ annoyance, and the practical Cato gave remedies for its prevention, 
(oJ^ ^^ advising thorough working of the ground. As he did not mention 
I t ^^ * I caprification, it is probable that the fig varieties he cultivated dropped 
r^^ ^^ their figs from climatic causes only. 
r jjji''^ Another cause for the dropping of the fruit i s a pecul iar' ^Ay^^tTuo- 
y<f ,t^ 1 ^^^^ ^^ *^^ flowers of the figs. The Smyrna figs, which require polli- 
nation in order to produce ripe fruit, will always drop their fruit if 
not pollina ted. Other figs will, for the same cause, drop their second 
crop, while their "brebas," which contain differently constructed flow- 
ers, will mature. It is hardly necessary to add that the latter class may 
also drop from climatic causes, even when properly pollinated. To 
ascertain which of these causes effects the dropping an examination of 
the flowers is necessary. If the flowers are receptive and have been 
properly pollinated, climatic defects must cause their dropping. If 
no pollination has taken place, this fact would cause the dropping 
even under the most favorable circumstances. Common edible figs 
suffer much less in this respect, as they are influenced principally by 
climatic conditions, while Smyrna figs are affected by both causes. 
Strong-growing varieties drop their fruit as readily as weak-growing 
kinds. There is no variety which holds its own better than the weak- 
growing Brunswick.

DISEASES AND INSECT ENEMIES OF THE FIG. 177 

SUNBURN. 

One of the commonest causes of diseases in fig trees is sunburn. 
This happens, however, only with young trees lately planted and 
before the new leaves and branches are sufficiently developed to 
shade the trunk of the tree. The effect of sun scald appears first at 
the collar close to the ground, later higher up, when the whole side 
of the trunk facing southwest may be found cracked and with peeling 
Jiaxk*. This give s access to bore rs, prevents the proper circul ation of 
sap, and greatly injures the tree in many ways. Sunburnt trees never 
recover their vigor and will always remain stunted. Sunburn may be 
prevented in various ways. One, of course, i s in pruning th e trees 
l ow or ev en allowing them to s hoot out directlv from the collar below 
the ground. Such trees are never injured by heat and sun. But if a 
higher stand ard be de sired some other means are necessary for keep- 
ing the trunk shaded and cool. A ne wspaper tied to th e trunk with 
common cotton yarn is, according no lae experience of the writer, the 
best and cheai)est tree protector. The yarn will never cut the tree as J^*^ i f 
heavier rope will and the paper will graduallj' f all off just at the time ^ 

wlien the leaves of the tree are large enough to shade the trunk, i/^^ J\^ 
Medicated tree protectors should be experimented with before being ^ fyisif ) 
generally used, as they sometimes contain chemicals strong enough — ' ■^r*/ 
to kill the trees, or at least to injure them more than sun and wind ' f^^ 111 
combined. ^,r ^ 

FROST. ^U.4^t^/^Ati<-t, /viv^^t;, C^+1^ 

Fig trees are easily frosted, especially when caught by the frost )p€^'Lk 
with their sap in full circulation, and while in full leaf. <-^ ^'^ * 

In northern climates the old trees as well as the young trees are 
injured by frost, but in warmer regions like California it is the young 
trees only which occasionally suffer. Young trees may, through 
unfavorable conditions, be greatly injured by frosts in several succes- 
sive years, but when at last successfully raised to the age of 4 or 
5 years they will generally be hardy enough to withstand heavier 
frosts even than those which injured them while young. It is there- 
fore unwise to say that such and such variety is not suited to any 
certain locality simply because it was for several years after planting 
cut back or down by frosts. This very variety, as has been repeatedly 
observed, may in the future be perfectly hardy and profitable. In 
San Joaquin Valley, California, for instance, the Adriatics were gen- 
erally injured and even killed by frosts when they were first intro- 
duced. As the trees grew older no ill effects were visible after equally 
heavy frosts. 

The injury done by frost shows itself in b lackened and w ;ithering 
shoots whic h die back more o_r_le8s. In severe cases the bark of the 
tree beco mes black an d rots, especially on the south side, where the 
sun strikes the frosted parts first and most. Smaller trees may be 




178 THE fig: its history, culture, and OU&IKG. 

covered with mats or wrapped in straw permanently for the winter, 
while for continued cold the dwarf trees are even buried in the soil. 

After the frost has caused damage to the branches there is no other 
remedy than to remove all injured parts at once and cut back until 
the flow of fresh milky sap indicates that healthy parts are reached. 
It might be necessary to cut back to the main trunk or even to cut 
the tree to the ground. If this be done in time new suckers will come 
up from which a new tree can be raised. If the tree is thus greatly 
injured it should be cut below the collar, the cut covered with graft- 
ing wax or pitch, and all the suckers allowed to grow the first year. 
The next winter these suckers should be covered by mats, straw, etc., 
in order to protect them. If they also are frosted there is very little 
hope for the tree. The following spring the strongest sucker is to be 
nursed into a tree, while the others should be cut and kept cut back 
severely through the season. The tree may even die to the ground 
or succumb entirely. The preventive measures are not many and 
not very effective. Young trees may be defoliated if they show no 
signs of becoming dormant at the time frost is most to be feared. 
Defoliation hastens the maturity of the wood, checks the flow of the 
sap, and renders the tree less liable to be greatly injured by frost. In 
France smoking is commonly used in northern fig orchards, the smoke 
being started an hour before sunrise and kept up for an hour after 
the sun is up. Tar, straw, and damp chips of wood are used to create 
smoke, which should be start/cd on all sides of the orchard. 

i^^.»,>'^ FUNGI. 

In France the fig plantations suffer greatly from the attacks of a root 
Z^ fungus of the genus phizoctonus^ The roots alone are infected and 
^ - ^^^ are destroyed in a very short time, 



a/^l]^ are destroyed in a very sho rt tim e, the ultim ate effect bein g to destroy 

J^ the whole fig tree. This disease spreads rapidly through the orchard

VV^' ,^ to prevent the wholesale destruction of the fig trees it is advisable to 

^ **.-^ plant them alt ernately w ith other trees which are not attacked by the 

' disease, such a s olives , pomegranates, or gr ape vi nes, or to plant the 

trees so far apart tTiat the roots can not interla ce. Intermediate 

.r-crops are then necessary. Any other remedy than isolation has never

souring is the want of proper sweetness in the figs, toojajighw^ater in 
the soil, or unsuitable soil. Figs which grow in moderately moist 
ground sour less than those that grow in wet soils. The drier the soil, 
to a certain point, the sweeter the figs. Very sweet, sirupy figs seldom 
sour, and certain varieties sour more readily than others under almost 






4- 



DISEASES AND INSECT ENEMIES OF THE FIG. l79 

any conditions. To counteract this tendency to souring, the soil 
should be kept dry, though excessive dryness will also injure the figs. 
How increased moisture may gradually ruin a flg orchard has been 
observed several times. The writer once knew of several acres of fig 
trees which bore excellent and very sweet figs, the variety being the 
Marseillaise. These few acres were very profitable to the owner, but 
gradually the vicinity was settled; the soil became more saturated, 
because of extra irrigation introduced by new settlers, and as the 
trees grew older their roots struck deeper and more quickly through 
this added moisture. These figs gradually showed the effect of too 
much moisture, they became less sweet year after year, and more figs 
became sour. After the lapse of three years from the time they were 
in the height of profitable bearing the trees did not pay, and finally 
all were cut down as useless, except one or two around the house, 
which even there had become a nuisance on account of the dropping 
figs, which at last become sour, with only seldom a good or fair one. 

Small flies are often seen emerging from sour figs. These flies are, 
however, not the cause of the souring. They are simply vinegar flies, 
which, attracted by the sour juices, flock to the fig to there lay their 
eggs and breed. They never visit healthy figs. The souring of the 
figs is greatly facilitated by their bursting open. As is well known 
in our fig districts, many figs burst open in the fall of the year or at 
the end of the summer. A few days after bursting the figs turn sour 
and become worthless for drying. The bursting open gives access 
to the interior of the fig to acetic bacteria, which cause the acid fer- 
mentation. As long as the eye was closed bacteria and fungi were 
kept out, and no fermentation could take place. There is no doubt 
that the principal function of the eye of the fig is to keep out bac- 
teria and insects, and the closed form of the fig receptacle is undoubt- 
edly effected by nature in order to prevent parasites from spoiling 
the sugary juice of the fig. Adriatics are especially apt to sour, but 
so far I have never found a sour fig which had not previously 
become cracked or split. The cracking open of the figs is due 
principally to moisture in soil and air. Figs will remain healthy on 
the trees until the advent of a rain storm or a fog. This increases 
the moisture in the air, which, again, causes the figs to swell from 
absorption of moisture. It is this swelling up which causes the figs 
to burst. Too much irrigation may have the same effect. Against 
the bursting on account of moisture in the air there is, so far as I can 
see, no remedy. 

SCALE. 

The fig tree in California has so far been very free from scale insects. 
In Euroge, however, as well as in the Southern States, the fig trees are 
frequently attacked by scale. In the Mediterranean region the^cale 
of the fig is the Chermes caricc^. It was mentioned by Oestoni in 
1733, and has been common since that time. It is a large scale, one- 




180 THE fig: its history, cultube, and cubing. 

third of an inch long bj'^ one-quarter of an inch wide when full grown, 
oval, convex, and of an ashy-broWn color. The young hatch in May, 
and spread at once over stems, leaves, and even over the fruit. The 
^effect is the stunted growth of tlie branches, dark spots on leaves and 
branches, the figs fall off, and in extreme cases the branches, and later 
the whole tree, succumbs. At the end of August the young scales 
gather on the outside of leaves and branches, and become stationary, 
where they continue to grow until the following spring, when the 
young burst the cover of the old scale and proceed as indicated. Prob- 
ably any one of the scale remedies in common use may be successfully 
employed as an antidote, but the writer especially recommends the 
lime, salt, and sulphur compound, the composition of which is as 

follows: 

150 pounds of sulphur. 

350 pounds of lime. 

100 pounds of salt. 
TV I 25 gallons of water. 



se a kettle 2^ feet higli by 3 feet wide. Put the water first in the 
kettle and boil the ingredients for eight hours, adding water as nec- 
essary. After boiling the prescribed time a mush-like mess is formed, 
which when put into molds hardens, but dissolves readily in water. 
Dissolve 5 pounds of this cake in hot water and then add 30 gallons 
of water. This is used as a spray on the trees in the spring before 
the scale hatches. 

If this scale appears in this country it will probably be fought by 
the introduction of parasites. 

BEETLES. 

Small Coleopterous insects or beetles attack the figs in the vicinity 
of Paris. These insects of two species bore the figs while they are 
yet rudimentary, and cause great damage to the crop. As a remedy 
damp moss is placed in the vicinity of the stems of the fig. The 
beetles collect under the moss and may be removed early eveiy morn- 
ing. Another remedy consists in sifting ashes over the branches in 
the early morning while the dew is yet on. 

WORMS IN DRIED FIGS. 

The small maggots so frequently found in dried figs are not really 
worms, but larvae of a small moth. These larva3 feed on the dry figs, 
as well as on other dry fruits. The eggs of the moth are laid on the 
fruit after it has dried and the maggots develop in a few weeks. Dip- 
ping in hot or boiling water is useful as a remedy; close packing and 
pressing of the figs will also to some extent prevent the havoc of the 
moth. A light sulphuring of the figs for a few minutes will probably 
kill the larvae. The sulphuring is effected by burning sulpjiur in a 
closecl chamber or room in which the infected figs have been previ- 
ously placed. Too long sulphuring would undoubtedly injure the 
taste of the figs. 



CHAPTER XI. 
DRYING AND CUBING FIGS. 

GENERAL REMARKS. 

The process of curing figs must necessarily be different in different 
countries, not only directly on account of climate, but because the 
figs are of different qualities, large or small, very sweet or watery, 
thin-skinned or tough, of good drying quality or the opposite. What 
will be set forth here is the method which has been the most success- 
ful in Califomiac==Successful not because these methods are better 
than those employed in Smyrna or Portugal, the homes of the best 
dried figs, but because so far our figs are decidedly different from 
those grown there. The reasons for this are several. In this coun.- ^ 
try we have tried extensively on ly a few varieties of figs out of a 
possible hundred or more. Many more vaneTiesTiave of late been 
planted, but the time has been too short to decide which ones have 
come to stay. The fig territory of the Pacific coast is so large and 
conditions so different in different localities that at least ten or twenty 
years must lapse before it will be possible to assign the proper variety 
to the locality best suited to it. A great obstacle in the way of 
extended fig culture is the tendency of the growers to despise small 
or medium-sized figs in their endeavor to imitate 1\\€ product of 
Smyrna! It isthe medi um-siz ecLfigs^which are the successful ones in • 
all the Mediterranean countries, except in the valley of the Meander. 
Neither Italy, Spain, France, nor Greece produces largfe figs for dry- 
ing, but only small or medium-sized ones. Our fig growers should • 
concentrate their first efforts in producing a merchantable and sweet

siderable, but not great. The ^ize does not count as much in this 
difference as do the inert qualities of the fig — its sweetness and the 
facility with which it dries. It makes a vast difference whether 
the figs are picked from the trees or from the ground in perfect con- 
dition ; whether they have to be sulphured before drying in order to 
prevent fermentation and to secure better color, or whether they can 

be dried as soon as gathered.

xf SIGNS OF MATURITY. 

No figs should be picked before perfect and absolute maturity is 

attained, if the object is to produce a good dried fig. Figs picked 

before maturity will dry, but they will not be sweet and soft, the two 

indispensable qualities of a dried fig. It is therefore important that 

everyone should know when to pick his figs. Not all figs ripen at the 

same time; in fact, this successive ripening is considerable of an 

annoyance to the growers, as it necessitates the going over of the 

^ T ^ orchard several times. During the height of the season every tree 

\ jt>^ ^ \ ^^®^ ^ looked over daily, or if the grower is fortunate enough to 

^'^^^^e^^^oBsesB a. vRrifttv whu»h dropa of i|.fiift1f wliftn perfectly mature, these 

'^i '^Iri^' ^ ^allenjfi^^must be picked up every day, because they spoil if exposed 

«» V \ J^,,-*''''^'^ more than twenty-four hours on the bare and shaded ground. 

^^ I *- I A pe rfectly ripe fig: , will not only b e soft , but jvjjjyjiigd, and hang 

^^l^Mf ^ Miown per pendicularly from its branch'or twig. Many varieties show 

1^ JW j additional little white seams or cracks, which always indicate perfect 

\ Jc^ D^aturity. These seams are especially noticeable around the peduncle 

lA* ^ ^ ^ft or stalk end, but not all varieties show them. The above general 

(f ^^.ili^'signs are common to all figs, and figs suitable for drying should also 

be sweet or very sweet. 

The best Italian and Smyrna figs when dried show 60 per cent of 
sugar, equal to about 35 per cent before drying. Unlike grapes, figs 
will not become much sweeter after they have matured. The sugar 
will be more concentrated, but the quantity will not materially 
increase. A sign of great e xcellence in figs is when a drop of very 
thick sirup is seen h gng infr from tlhft ftyft. 'The fig is then in its prime 
and can not be improved by hanging any longer. Figs hanging any 
longer on the trees are exposed to various ferments, acid or otherwise, 
which as soon as they set in will ruin them. Genuine Smyrna figs 
when perfectly ripe drop to the ground. They should never be cut 
from the tree. -^-^ 

J OILING THE FIG. 

^VXr This operation consists in piercing the eye of the fig with a needle 
dipped in oil or by closing the eye of the fig with a drop of olive oil. 
This process is of very ancient_origin, and must not be confounded 
with caprification.^^While the object of caprification is to cause the 
f ruit to set and prod uce fertile seed , the object of the oiling is to 
hasten the maJajjuJ^fegf^tli^fiuiii^everal days. For the practical part 
of this oiling see article on "France." The physiological effect of the 
oiling is not explained, and is probably to be found in something else 
than in the mere exclusion of air. 

The origin of the practice^is yerjjold^ In the Old Testament the 
prophet Amos (chap. VII, v. 14) speaks of "h olfts sr*hi(jj flfm^'^ which 
was translated by Luther as "Who take off the mulberries." But the 
true translation . according to Solms-Laubach is "Who performs an 




DRYING AND CUBING FIGS. 183 

operation on the fig." B oles or balas^ ho wever, refers tio wild figs. It 

has been suggested that the expression of Amos refers to caprification, 

and was so given by De Lagarde. But it is much more probable 

that * * boles schiqmim " refers to the process practiced to this day of 

^'Ite^Butting or piercing the sycamore fig with a knife, in order to cause 

^»^the BlastophagM .to d evelop qui ckly and leave the fig. 

J^jd"** In Italy the oiling of the fig is calledj^egliazione." The process 

, ^^^^^^i;*Vffcs mentioned by Theophrastus as practiced by tne^ancient Greeks, 

> and Pliny mentions it as one of the practices of the Romans. In 

"^^._itt«dern times oiling is in vogue in Italy, S yria^ Spain ^ and Pro vence. 



^'-i^ 



^ Even other substances have been or are used, such as alcohol, and 



iccording to Professor Solms-Laubach) Dr. Eisig was tolS' m Ischia 
at oil caused *'muso chiuso" (mouth shut), but alcohol "muso 

^ aperto" (mouth open), indicating that oil would cause the mouth or 

eye of the tig to close, while alcohol would cause it to open. 

-*' ^ , }jb may be interesting to note that unless the sycamore figs are 
pierced by the knife they are said not to reach perfection nor to be 

^.ity edible. There is reason to believe that ther e is a twofold obje ct in 

^^^...^ piercing the sycamore figs: first, to cause the wasps ISycophaga syco- 
mori) to quickly develop aatLifiave; second, to cause the fruit to 
develo p or f.o hastc^i its dftyftlopmftnt. If such be the case, the pierc- 
ing of this fig is at least partly analogous to the puncturing of the 
edible figs as practiced in Provence. 

Oiling and puncturing of second-crop San Pedros will not cause 
them to develop. The writer has tried it several times without suc- 
cess. According to reliable testimony of French growers the oiling 
hastens the development and maturity of the fi gs about six days. It 
is generally practiced at Argenteuil, near Paris, where the production 
of '*figues fleurs," or first-crop figs, for the Paris market is an exten- 
sive industry. 

HOW TO ASCERTAIN THE SUGAR PERCENTAGE OR DEGREE IN FIGS. 

Figs contain much less water than grapes, and while the latter 
require only to be squeezed out in order to have their saccharine 
measured, figs can not be thus treated. There are several ways by 
which the percentage of sugar may be ascertained, but the simplest 
one for the fruit grower is as follows: Procure a graduated glass from 
some firm dealing in chemical apparatus. The graduate should not 
hold less than a quart. Fill this to the upper graduation with figs, not 
packed, but loosely shaken in. Then pour on water slowly until this 
also reaches the top graduation. Then take out all the figs one by 
one, place in a dish to drain, and add this drained-off water to what 
is left in the graduate and ascertain to what line this water reaches. 
The difference between this line and the top line indicates the volume 
of the figs. Suppose that this is 20 per cent. Next cut the figs into 
smaller pieces, place in a clean pot, cover well with water, and heat to 
23740— No. 9—01 13 



184 THE fig: its history, cubture, and cubing. 

the boiling point. At least 40 units of water should be added to the 
figs if their volume was 20 per cent. After having boiled for a while 
ascertain, by tasting, if all the sugar is leached out of the figs. If so, 
remove from the fire. Filter the liquid from the figs and then squeeze 
the figs in a cloth until as much of the liquid is removed as possible; 
then add this liquid to the former liquid. If this liquid in which the 
figs have been boiled measures less than 20 units, more water must 
be added; but if it measures more than 20 units, or the volume of the 
figs, it must be evaporated by boiling until it shows exactly 20 per 
cent. Filter through blotting paper and then weigh with a saccha- 
rometer. In order to have first-class dried figs the saccharometer 
should indicate 35 per cent of sugar. The object of the whole process 
is to extract the sugar from the figs and to ascertain correctly its per- 
centage in relation to the volume of the figs. This method will only 
suffice for a rough estimate and not for a chemical analysis. As the 
commercial value of figs depends principally on the quantity of sac- 
charine they contain, every grower and dealer should be prepared to 
test the saccharine. Fresh figs used for drying should show not less 
than 35 per cent, and dried figs not less than 55 per cent of sugar. 

GATHERING THE FRUIT. 

Figs destined for drying should be carefully handled in order to 

preserve a fine appearance when offered for sale and also to prevent 

undue fermentation while curing. In localities where caprification is 

practiced, little labor is required in i)icking the figs, because caprifi- 

— 1' I UJu cated figs, or varieties which require caprification, fall from the trees 

4*"i i\ ^^^^ perfectly mature and in prime condition for being dried and 

ct '^ ^V-1 cured. The cause of this dropping mu^t be sought for in the perfect 

^-""""TT * .\ condition of seeds and consequent perfection of the fruit, the nature 

'yi^'^^^^^kof which is to fall from the tree when sufficiently developed to propa- 

V t » ^" yjgate its kind. Figs which have not been caprificated fall first from the 

^ """^ tree when decay has begun to set in in some form or other. Such figs 

are therefore never as perfect as when cut from the tree at the proper 

aJ\ time. If carelessly pulled from the branches the figs will be bruised 

ffj^ ^^"^ and torn, the skin around the neck is apt to be injured, and quite fre- 

^ \ ^^ queiilly the neck itself is torn off, exposing the pulp of the fig to view. 

^^^ Bruised figs"will be inferior in many ways. The conten tg will ooze out, 

* \r-^"* and pulling and fancy packing can not be resorted to. Figs maybe 

^ twisted from the branch by an expert picker, but even with the best of 

^*v ' V .^ skill and care many figs will be injured. Besides, the process is too 

J. V [ t. slow. The proper waj^ is to cut the figs from the branch as closely to 

X . v^ V the tree as possible, leaving no part of th eneck and s talk adh ering 

to the branch. A small knife with a fixed blade, such as is used for 

picking grapes, may be used, but a size smaller is more convenient. 

A knife 6 inches in length — handle and blade — is of proper size. The 

knife should be quite sharp, or it will tear the delicate skin of the fig. 



^-rt 



DBYING AND CURING FIGS. 185 

For gathering the higher figs a convenient instrument may be made, 
called the '* lig picker." It consists of a forked stick or artificial fork, 
across which has been tacked a strip of tin plate. Below this is a bag 
kejrt open by a wire. (See elsewhere for further description.) With 
this fig picker the highest figs may be cut without being bruised, 
but the process is slower than cutting with a knife and should be used 
only for figs which otherwise could not be reached. 

SULPHURING. 

Sulphuring is a process by which fresh fruit, immediately before 
drying, is exposed to the fumes of burning sulphiir in a closed cham- 
ber called the "sulphur box." The object of sulphuring fruit of any 
kind, and especially figs, is twofold: First, to prevent fermentatio n 
during the process of curing; second, to bleach the fruit. The action 
of the sulphur fumes is deathly to the microorganisms or fungi which, 
as is well known, cause the fermentation of various substances con- 
taining sugar. The action is also purely chemical, as sulphured fruit 
assumes a semitransparent and light-yellowish color, the more intense 
the longer exposed to the fumes. Sulphured figs, as well as sulphured 
fruit generally, is inferior to fruit which is naturally of light color 
^ and unsulphured. Not only is the acid caused by sulphuring easily 
/tasted by anyone with a sensitive taste, but the effect of the acid 
. is purgative, and the use of sulphured fruit for any length of time is 
\ injurious, especially if the fruit has been exposed too long to the 
fumes. The writer is not ail advocate of sulphuring generally, and 
does not advise the sulphuring of figs unless it be found that other- 
wise they will not dry properly nor assume the light color demanded by 
. the market or the trade. Many fig varieties do not dry well, but fer- 
( ment, puff up, and become acetic during the process of drying, even 
when exposed fully to the sun. If sulphured, however, for a few 
; minutes, the germs of the ferment are tilled and the curing will pro- 
; ceed without difficulty. This is especially the case with large figs of 
inferior sweetness. Figs which require no sulphuring are greatly to 
be preferred to those which do. The true interest of the fig grower 
is to procure varieties which will dry readily and assume a good, pale, 
semitransparent color without any chemical manipulation. 

Sulphuring, when necessary, should be resorted to as soon as the 
figs are picked and placed on the trays. The sulphur box is closed 
and made as air-tight as possible. It should not be over 5 feet high, 
but wide enough to admit two trays. The trays are placed two deep 
in the box, and are made to slide on a rack or on cleats nailed to the 
sides. The door must be made to shut very tight, or the fumes of 
sulphur will escape. There should be at least 2 feet between the 
place where the sulphur fumes are originated and the lowest tray- 
This tray should be dampened, but not contain any figs. The figs 
are placed on the trays as close as possible, but only one fig deep, and 



186 THE FI(^: ITS HISTORY, CULTURE, AND CURING. 

with the eyes pointing in the same direction. Fill the box with loaded 
trays, light the sulphur, and then close the door. 

The late B. M. Lelong suggested the following method of creating the 
sulphur fumes : Place a small kerosene stove on the floor of the sulphur 
house, and on the stove a heavy sheet of iron 1^ inches thick. Light 
the stove, and when the iron is hot, but not red-hot, extinguish the 
light and throw the sulphur on the plate. The fumes rapidly fill the 
house, enter the figs, and kill the ferment, and also act on the skin of 
the figs. The amouut of sulphur to be used varies, but a couple of 
handf uls are sufficient if the box be tight and th6 figs not too watery. 
^ It takes about five minutes to fill the house with sulphur fumes and 
• six or seven minutes more are required to sulphur the figs. *If exposed 
too long their taste will become too acid and the skin will peel off 
when the figs are handled. It is preferable to have a little darker 
color than to have the figs sour. All sulphuring should be done in 
J the morning or before noon. The sulphured figs should be exposed 
to dry air and sunshine in order to get a good color and as clear a 
taste as possible. It is unfortunate that the market accepts sulphured 
figs and that it requires the figs to be excessively light colored. 

Some growers sulphur their figs for six hours, and some even leave 
the trays in the sulphuring box over night. It is deplorable that the 
market is such as to command the sale of such f rait, which, to the 
writer at least, is unpalatable in the extreme. 

Genuine Smyrna figs never require sulphuring. 

It is hardly necessary to add that only light-colored figs should be 
sulphured. Black figs if sulphured assume a very disagreeable color. 

A gentleman who was born in the Smyrna district furnished the 
writer with the following method of sulphuring, though it is not 
thought that he practiced the method while there. He recommended 
one-half sulphur and one-half saltpeter mixed, the fresh figs to be 
exposed to the fumes of this mixture for fifteen to twenty minutes, 
then for three days, and afterwards sweated for several weeks. The 
writer has not seen figs treated thus. 

DIPPING WHILE FRESH. 

Instead of sulphuring, some growers dip the figs while fi:e8h in boil- 
ing water. Common salt water is best, but in lack of it ii pounds of 
salt to 50 gallons of water will answer. First rinse the fresh figs in 
fresh water, then dip the baskets or buckets in which the figs are 
placed in the boiling salt water for one second or more, and repeat 
once or twice. This will soften their skins. 

For dipping, Mr. A. Gartenlaub proceeds as follows: First wash the 
figs in pure water, then dip in a solution of 1^ pounds of saltpeter to 
50 gallons of water, the water to be boiling hot. Dip once or twice. 
This method he claims to be better than the use of salt. The writer 
has neither seen nor practiced this method. 



DKYlNa AND OUBINa FIGS. *^' /l' \ 187 

DRYING ON TRAYS. 0\( ^% , J (/rt Am^^ A«^^V 

The California and Arizona method of drying fruit on trays is by 
far the most practical as well as the most labor-saving way to handle . 
the fruit during the process of curing. For figs the small trays used 'rlA^vw "^ 
for drying raisins are the best, as thej'^ are a convenient size and 
easily handled. In order to save labor in carrying, the drying ground 
should be outside the orchard and adjoining the sulphur house. No 
drying can be done in the drcTTard, as the trees will shade the trays 
at least during part of the day. The figs require all the..siuxJiiey can 
get. The drying ground should be as free from dust as possible. As 
the figs require re peated turning^ oyer while drying, it is most conven- 
ient to have the trays elevated^ above the ground sufficiently tof 
enable the work of turning to be carried on without stooping downi 
The simplest contrivance is to provide " gawhorsefr," across which are^ 
laid long strips of lumber, 2 by 4 and 2 by 3 inches wide, and as long as 
convenient. The sawhorses should be 4 feet long, which will admit 
of two tiers of trays being put across. A man can then easily reach 
across from either side. The figs are placed on the trays, with the 
eyes all toward one of the long sides of the trays, and this side 
should be slightly raised in order to prevent the contents of the figs 
from running out by gravity. The raising of one side of the trays is 
easiest accomplished by placing the 2 by 4 strips in the center on the 
horses, and the 2 by 3 outside. This raises the trays 1 inch, which is 
generally sufficient for medium sized and not too pulpy figs. By plac- 
ing an inch board above the scantling, the trays may of course be 
elevated 1 inch more. 

Immediately after sulphuring — whenever sulphuring is absolutely 
necessary — the trays should be distributed on the racks and exposed 
to the full rays of the sun. This should be finished before noon 
every day if it is of importance to have a good color on the figs. 
Dark figs may be exposed any time of the day, as they are generally 
more easilj^^ handled than the white ones. 

TURNING. 

In order that the figs may dry evenly, they should at first be turned 
t^ifiS^olay, and latexonce a day. Sulphured figs should be turned twice ' 
the first day, because if left overnight without being turned the color 
will be injured. Black figs need to be turned only once a day if not 
watery. The turning requires much labor, as it can be done only 
by han d and by turning each fig separately. No contrivance has 
as yet been invented by which all the figs may be turned at once, 
in the same manner as raisins are turned. By placing one tray on 
top of the other and turning the two together, the figs will become 
badly disarranged and will require more labor to be straightened 
than if turned at once by hand separately. Despite sulphuring and 
careful selection in picking from the trees, some figs will sour during 
the process of drying, especially if the figs are not very sweet. In 



188 THE fig: its HISTOBY, culture^ and CtTRINO. 

turning, all such figs should be removed and usedr^ f or vinegar or be 
thrown away. No pulling or pressing of the figs while turning is 
necessary, and no one can afford to put tob much labor on them. 
The pulling and flattening is done after dipping and at packing. 

The sour or fermenting figs may be easily recognized by their puffed 
up appearance and by the fermenting froth issuing from the eye. 
While turning, each fig may be given a slight pressure to ascertain its 
condition. If fermenting or sour, a wheezing sound is heard or ' * felt," 
the fig being watery and frothy in the center. Such sour figs will 
spoil the value of the box, being disagreeable and nauseous to the 
taste. 

COVERING. 

Figs, more than almost any other fruit, are susceptible of being 
injured by dampness, either hi the form of rain or dew. Not only 
does dampness retard the drjang of figs, but it spoils their color, or 
may even cause them to mold and rot. Rain is especially damaging 
both to figs on the trees and on the trays. It is therefore neces- 
sarjT^ to cover the figs not only when rain and fog are threatening, but 
every evening, as a protection against dew. If rain is expected it 
is best to stack the trays, placing one tray on top of another in 
stacks about 5 feet high. Four empty trays are placed on the ground, 
leaning against the stack, in order to keep off splashes of rain and 
sand, and the whole stack is then covered with a strip of canv,as. In 
places where the fig industry is permanent, monej" and labor will be 
saved in having permanent drying beds made of brick and cement or 
filled with gravel. As such beds have appliances for quickly running 
{ the canvas over the trays, no stacking is necessary. Early at sunrise, 
pr, better yet, half an hour afterwards, the covering should be removed. 

WHEN sufficiently DRIED. 

It is of great importance that the figs should be exposed long enough 
to become sufficiently dried, but not so long as to be overdried. A 
fig when sufficiently dried and ready to be removed from the tray 
should, when slightly pressed between the fingers, be soft and pliable. 
The contents should be distinctly pulpy, and when pressed shouM not 
resume their former position, but remain as pressed. In other words, 
the pulp or meat should be plastic (not elastic), hard, and dry. If nor 
sufficiently dried the fig will burst at the stalk end. if pressed even 
moderately hard. 

Underdried figs will spoil, sour, and mold, and will become useless. 
Overdried figs will be hard and leathery and tough; will lose their 
flavor and color, the white ones becoming darker and the black ones 
turning a dirty brown. The overdried figs may be partly improved 
by dipping, but the underdried figs can in no way be improved. In 
order to produce only figs which are properly dried and cured, it will 
be found absolutely necessary to remove daily all those figs which are 
properly dry, allowing the remainder to be exposed to sun and air a 



DRYING AND CUBING FIGS. 189 

I longer or shorter time. The time required for drying varies consid- 

1 erably between four and sixteen days, according to size, quality, and 

\ sweetness. To allow all the figs to remain on the trays until all are 

dry will produce a very inferior article. Daily removals are necessary. 

SWEATING AND EQUALIZING. 

It is less necessary for figs to undergo the sweating or equalizing 
process than it is for raisins. Still, figs are greatly benefited by being 
stored and equalized a few weeks before packing. But regardless of 
the desirability, which, however, is not a necessity, it is practical and 
labor-saving to house the figs a few days before packing. This is 
best done by placing them in sweat boxes of the same size as those 
used for raisins. In storing these boxes it is of importance to prevent 
fermentation. The boxes should never be placed close together, but 
at least 4 inches apart, and each tier of boxes should cover the one 
below in the same way as bricks in a wall; but there should be the 
space of 4 inches between the boxes. Between the rows of boxes 
a gangway of 3 feet is necessary, this being sufficient to allow easy 
access to the rows from each side. The boxes should be examined 
frequently by running the hand down among the figs, in order to 
ascertain if any heating is in progress. Heating figs must be at 
once removed and aired. If there appears to be any general danger 
that the figs may heat, it is preferable to pile the boxes in stacks, eacli 
box being placed crosswise on the one below. In this way the boxes 
are more readily removed, as they are not bound up in a whole tier 
of boxes. After a few days the figs will have become equalized as to 
their moisture, the skin will have softened considerably, and they will 
have otherwise improved. 

DRYING FLOORS. 

In places where manj^ figs are to be dried, drying floors will prove a 
great convenience. Floors similar to those used for drying raisins, 
or slightly modified to suit the occasion, may be used for figs. On 
these floors the figs may be dried either by being placed directly on 
the floor or by placing the trays on the floor. The following direc- 
tions may prove desirable: 
» The drying floors are built o f brick a nd slightly elevated. The 
, long sides are as long as required, but the'short sides should be about 
! 6 feet 6 inches, interior measure, allowing three trays depth. The 
back wall is 2 feet high and the front wall 6 inches high. At the 
bottom there should be a row of holes, to allow rain water to escape. 
The interior of this bed is filled with pebbles, if they can be had; if 
, not, any gravel, if clean, will answer. Cement and asphaltum, how- 
1 ever, are probably more desirable when their expense can be incurred. 
\ Along the back of the higher part of the floor should be a row of posts 
or uprights made of 2 by 4 inch 'lumber, driven securely in the soil. 
In the top of each upright is driven an eyelet, through which runs 



190 THE fig: its history, CUI/rUBE, AND CURING. 

a stout wire the whole length of the frame. A strip of canvas is 
used for covering. The canvas must be hemmed and furnished with 
small rings, by means of which it is attached bo the wire of the 
uprights. In front are similar rings, in order that the canvas may be 
securely stretched and fastened to small posts set in front, which, 
however, carry hooks instead of a running wire. In order to make 
1 the canvas waterproof it should be painted with at least two coats 
of linseed oil. (July pure linseed oil should be used, as impure oil 
cleared or mixed with certain chemicals will rapidlj'^ rot the canvas. 
If the floors are of the above size they will admit of three trays in 
depth. A pathway of 2 feet should be left between the rows of trays 
to allow the workmen to kneel while turning the figs. When the can- 
vas cover is not in use it should be rolled up and fastened by straps 
to the back of the higher posts. In case of rain, and every evening, 
the canvas is easily unrolled and spread over the figs. Loose strips 
of lumber may be laid along the pathways to keep the canvas from 
pressing on the figs. 

The above suggestions have been adopted and modified according 
to the plans of Spanish and Santa Ana raisin floors. 

ARTIFICIAL DRYING. 

In many districts it is impossible to dry figs in the open air, with 
the blaze of the sun as the only drier. In such localities evaporators 
or driers which produce artificial heat from fuel are required. The 
ideal dryer is not yet invented. There exists a great number of pat- 
ented driers in the market, most of which are very good. Very large 
driers are expensive, and the writer prefers having a number of smaller 
ones, which are easier to manage and which cost less to keep in repair. 

DIPPING. 

Figs used for artificial drying are generally those grown in moist 
districts, where the seasons are less favorable to the full development 
of the fruit and where, consequently, the skin is thicker. Such figs 
^ should be dipped before being dried. This dipping is best done in a 
hot solution of potash or lye made from ashes of grapevine trimmings. 
. The figs are first washed in cold water. This is done by placing them 
• in perforated buckets holding 10 pounds and immersing the buckets 
in a trough of running water. Immediately afterwards the bucket is 
transferred to a kettle containing boiling lye, made of 1 pound of pot- 
ash to 10 gallons of boiling water. The lye should be boiling and the 
figs suspended in it for 1 minute. No rinsing afterwards is required. 
The figs are spread on the traj^s in such a way that they do not touch 
one another, their eyes all toward the same side and slightly upward. 
The heat in the drier should never be allowed to run too high, as the 
best figs are produced by a lower heat of about 45° to 50° C, or about 
120° F. The drying requires from thirty to forty hours, and when 
finished the figs must be pulpy and not rattling. They should be 
packed while yet warm, without other dipping or addition of sugar. 



CHAPTER XII. 
PACKING FIGS. 

GENERAL REMARKS. 

The packing of figs as practiced in different countries is extremely 
varied, and in each district figs are packed in many different ways, 
different grades being treated differently. The first grades in Smyrna 
are packed with extreme care, and no superior or equal packing 
exists anywhere. This skillful packing should.be reserved for the 
best grades, and in imitating Smj^rna we should first of all endeavor 
to produce quality in the fruit, and later quality in packing. It 
neither pays to pack inferior fruit in the best possible way, nor is it 
to advantage to neglect packing and place good fruit on the market 
in a slovenly way. For medium quality of figs a cheap but attractive 
packing should be adopted, reserving the greatest care and skill for 
the very best article. It is futile to believe that the consumer will 
repeatedly buy a poor article simply because it is packed to imitate 
the best foreign grade. The deception may succeed once or twice, 
but it will not ci'eate a lasting trade; on the contrary, it will bring 
the article into disrepute. 

In packing, the grower should be guided by his own judgment and 
by the actual value of the figs. It is proper for him to procure the 
best imported article in the market, as long as the foreign figs are 
better than ours, and compare the homemade with the imported. 
Sweetness is the first important point in figs, and without it color 
and size do not amount to much. Therefore, if the figs are sweet — 
58 to 60 per cent of sugar when dried — consider the advisability 
of packing them extra well. If they are not up to the standard in 
sweetness it is better to adopt a less expensive method without neg- 
lecting taste in arrangement and attractiveness in appearance. A 
good article, even, will not sell if sloventy packed; or, if it sells, it 
commands an inferior price. Extra labor on packing good figs will 
be found very profitable. The Italian and Portuguese figs, though 
they may be really good, bring only inferior prices, and on account 
of general carelessness in packing and handling go mostly to the fer- 
menting tanks and coffee mills. The Portuguese fig trade was not 
long ago superior to that of Smyrna, but neglectful packing ruined 
the business, or at least helped to ruin it. 

There are two distinct modes of packing figs, regardless of the 
boxes or bags, mats, or drums they may be packed in. One way is 

191 



192 THE fig: its history, cultubr, and cubing. 

to "pull" the figs and pack them in such a way that the eye of the 
fig rests in the center, it having been brought there by pulling and 
manipulating the fig. This we may call the *'fiat" way, and the figs 
are called " pulled figs." The other method is to pack the figs just as 
they grow and come from the tree. This may be called the " square" 
or ''bag" way. In Smyrna the flat figs are called ''eleme" (pulled) 
and the square figs are called "locoum," provided they are of the best 
grade. » 

--t DIPPING the figs. 

Whether the figs be packed in one way or the other, they should 
have previously been dipped. The dipping should be done immedi- 
ately — that is, several hours — before packing. The dipping has a 
most pronounced effect on the figs, as it makes them soft, and in this 
respect affects both pulp and skin as well as improves the color. It 
equalizes the sugar in the figs and causes it to permeate to the skin. 
Even the poorest figs are improved by dipping, and many figs which, 
through careless handling, are not palatable will become so by dip- 
ping. The very best Smyrna figs are, however, not strictly dipped in 
the same way as the lower grades, but they are nevertheless moist- 
ened with salt water while being packed, and so important is this 
moi.stening that the figs could not be properly packed without being 
thus treated. The dipping should not be undertaken before the figs 
are thoroughly dried and cured, and only shortly before packing. If 
dipped and allowed to lie any length of time, the moisture will cause 
the color to darken. The air must be excluded from dipped figs as 
much as possible. 

The process of dipping is as follows : Large and deep kettles are 
provided for keeping water constantly boiling either by steam or by 
direct fire, the size and number of kettles to be regulated according 
to the quantity of figs to be dipped. Alongside of the kettles should 
be a trough, with continuously^ running fresh water from a tank or 
ditch. Perforated buckets, holding about 5 gallons, are suitable for 
holding the figs while they are dipped. A long lever resting on a 
pivot, at one end furnished with a hook for holding the bucket of figs 
and at the other end heavy weights as a balance, makes a simple and 
practical contrivance. To every gallon of water in the kettles use 
about a quarter of a pound of salt. When sea water is to be had it 
is preferable. When salt is used the coarse common salt is better 
than the refined salt. The salt water can hardly be too salt; even 
a saturated solution would not injure the figs. 

First fill the perforated bucket with figs, and by means of the lever 
rinse the figs by immersing them for a few seconds in the cold, fresh 
running water. Lift the bucket, and immediately after the greater 
quantity of water has drained off immerse it again in the boiling water 
for a few seconds. Then empty the figs on wire-screen frames placed 
a few inches above the fioor and allo-.v them to drain there for several 



PACKING FIGS. 193 

hours. While draining, the figs should be covered with a cloth or 
otherwise be kept dark. Figs dipped in the morning should be packed 
the same day. Those dipped in the evening should be packed early 
the next morning. Black figs are less apt to be discolored than white 
ones. The very finest white figs need dipping only in cold salt water. 
The salt in the water should not be rinsed away, as it contributes to 
the flavor of the fig and brings out the sweetness. It also tends to 
keep the fig moist. 

ASSORTING THE FIGS. 

As has been indicated, the assorting or grading of the figs should 
begin when they are exposed for drying. The spoiled figs are removed 
daily. At least three grades and sizes should be made. All the good 
figs should be separated into at least two sizes, the poor ones of any size 
forming a third grade not suitable for packing. The size of the figs 
of each grade can not be stated, as it depends entirely on the variety 
of the figs, but in every variety of figs there are at least two sizes, and 
among Smyrna figs there are four or more sizes. All figs which are 
not sufficiently soft and of good color and attractive in appearance 
should be at once consigned to the basket for the lowest grades. Figs 
which, on account of being sour, show a peculiar softness in the cen- 
ter, and which when pressed causes the pulp to exude, should never 
be allowed to go in among good figs. Any buyer who chances on such 
a fig is certain to condemn the box and is not likely to invest again. 
Softness and color of skin, consistency of pulp, and size are the four 
points to be judged in assorting. 

The best class of Smyrna figs weigh about 22 to 23 grams each ; the 
average Italian and French figs weigh only 7 to 8 grams, or about two- 
thirds less. , 

"T PULLING. 

As soon as dipped and drained, the figs should be "pulled" or 
worked preparatory to being packed. The "pulling" consists in 
squeezing and pressing the fig by hand, arid is more or less compli- 
cated and expensive. This pulling greatly improves the appearance 
and the actual quality of the figs, making them soft and tender. 
While pulling the figs, the hands of the worker should always be moist 
with salt water. This prevents the sugar sticking to the hand, im- 
proves the figs, and makes the work easier. Figs may be either pulled 
"flat" or "square." Flat pulling is used for very large figs,^ making 
them appear larger than they are and causing them to present their 
best part to the buyer. The fig, held with the eye downward and the 
stalk inward by the thumb and forefinger of each hand, is gently and 
gradually pressed, and by repeatedly moving the forefinger on the 
under or eye side of the fig, the upper side is pushed outward and for- 
ward. At the same time the fig edges are flattened out and pulled cir- 



194 THE fig: its history, culture, and curing. 

cular. When finished, the fig forms a flat disk, the eye being exactly 
in the center on the under side and the stalk in the center on the 
upper or opposite side. In order to make the fig larger j^et, the part 
just between the stalk and the periphery of the fig is split by the 
thumb nail, which of course causes the fig to spread out in front. 
This, however, should be done only in extra fancy packing, and really 
does not improve the fig, though such split figs pack more easily and 
appear larger. Figs pulled in this way present their finest surface on 
one side, the coarse and hard part around the eye being hidden. The 
skin around the stalk end is always the finest and handsomest part of 
the fig, presenting a semi transparent and beautifully streaked skin, 
contrasting greatly with the opaque zone around the eye. The only 
method by which this fine part may be properly presented to view is 
by the above-described "flat-' pulling. 

The *' square" pulling maybe either very simple or may require 
considerable experience and skill. The finest figs in Smyrna are the 
"locoum" figs, which are not flattened out, but which are worked 
into little cubes or bags, each fig being first squeezed in the hand. 
Then the sides are pushed slightly inward, the front being left blunt, 
the upper and under surface flat, but the stalk end is slightly pressed 
in and the stalk bent down. All this manipulation simply tends to 
give to the fig the form of a cube. A less expensive pulling is used for 
common grades. It simplj'^ consists of squeezing the figs repeatedly, 
both hands being separately occupied. The figs are not shaped, but 
only made soft. 

PACKING. 

The packing should be regulated according to the quality of the 
figs. The Smyrna way of packing the best figs in ' * bars " can hardly be 
improved. Each box contains three or more such bars, parallel to one 
another, and so well packed that each bar may be lifted out separately 
without disturbing the other two in the same box. What is accom- 
plished with great skill and practice in Smyrna may be performed 
here by the aid of a small mechanical contrivance called the ''^ guide." 
This guide consists of several parallel strips of tin of the exact length 
of the interior of the box and fastened to two other pieces of tin also 
parallel, but at right angles to the first one, and one at each end. 
These cross pieces are to be of the exact inside width of the fig box. 
The height of these four pieces constituting the guide is to be about 
one-half inch greater than the box. The use of this guide is easily 
understood. When placed in the empty fig box before packing it 
divides the box into three (or more if wanted) equal longitudinal com- 
partments, each made to hold one bar, consisting of several or many 
layers of figs. The width of each compartment must be made to cor- 
respond to the width of each fig when prepared, ready to be packed. 
For diff'erent sizes of figs diff'erent guides are required, and of course 



PACKING FIGS. 



195 



different guides are also made for different sizes of boxes. The sim- 
plicity and convenience of this guide is evident. No matter what size 
of box and how many rows of bars are required to fill it, a guide may 
be made that will readily fit. 

The process of packing "flat" figs is as follows: The guide is 
dropped in the box. A flat fig is then placed at the further end of 
the left compartment, with the *' eye " face downward and the '' stalk" 
end toward the packer. Another fig is placed partly on the top and 
partly behind this first fig in such a way that the front margin of the 
second fig just covers the center of the first fig, thus hiding the stalk. 
In this way the figs are thatched, or packed shingle fashion. The last 
fig in the row or bar must be partly folded upon itself, the stalk end 
being bent downward in order to fit the straight 
face of the box. If any one of the figs is a trifle 
too wide, the sides may be pushed together and 
made to fit the compartment. Care should be 
taken never to place too small a fig in a compart- 
ment. The next layer of the bar is packed in the 
same way, except that the box is turned around or 
the figs are otherwise packed so that their stalk 
ends point in the opposite direction from those in 
the first row; and so on, layer upon layer, until 
the compartment is full. If it is desirable that 
the box should be faced similarly on both sides, 
so as to present the same appearance if opened at 
either top or bottom, a slightly different method is 
required. In this case a guide is u^ed which is 
about one-half as high as the box. A block or 
'' follower " the size of the interior of the box, but 
only one-half as deep, is first slipped into the box, 
which should in this case be merely a frame, with- 
out bottom or top. On this follower is placed the 
guide, and the packing proceeds as previously 
described. When the last face is made the top 
cover is nailed on securely. The box is now turned over, the follower 
removed, the guide raised, and the other side packed the same as in 
the first in^ance. It is in some respects better to have only one guide, 
slightly higher than the box, and instead of one follower for the whole 
box, use one small follower for each compartment. The frame of the 
box is first placed on a loose drawboard, the guide is slipped down, 
then a follower in each compartment of the guide, after which the 
packing begins. After the cover is nailed on the box is turned over, 
the drawboard removed, each follower lifted out, and the box finished 
just like the other side. The followers should be covered with zinc, 
in order that they may be readily washed. 

In packing square figs guides may be used or not. Guides may be

made round or square or any shape required, their object being simply 
to keep the layers distinctly separate. For common packing, shallow 
guides may be made for simple '* facing." Facing consists of placing 
rows of figs in a certain harmonious order at top and bottom of a box 
not otherwise packed with bars or rows. Even lower grades of figs 
which are simply dumped into the boxes may thus be faced to great 
advantage and with small cost.

pressing. 



The final process in packing figs consists in more or less forcibly 
pressing the pack. This should be done with all figs except the best, 

which are so thin 
skinned, pulpy, and 
delicate that the 
weight of one box 
on top of the other, 
to the height of seven 
or eight, is sufficient 
to press the figs se- 
curely in the boxes. 
And even with these, 
the best figs, a mod- 
erate pressure by 
means of a press 
adapted to the i)ur- 
pose secures a quick- 
er and more even 
work than the old 
Asiatic way of sim- 
ply allowing the figs 
to press themselves. 
In order to secure 
this steady and regulated pressure there is no better machine made 
than the so-called '* raisin " press (fig. 31). With this easily regulated 
lever press the slight*est as well as the heaviest desirable pressure can 
be brought on the pack, according to the quality of the figs. 

The final process is as follows: The guide being in the box, the bot- 
tom (or top) is nailed on. The pack reaches slightly above the box, 
even or almost even with the top of the guide. A follower is first put 
over each compartment of the guide and the box, placed in the press, 
is given a slight pressure. This has the effect of compressing each bar 
of figs separately. This first pressing should be heavy enough to 
bring the figs to a level with the top of the box. After the boxes have 
been left under the^press levers for a few minutes they are removed 
and the guide is lifted from each box. This is readily done by placing

the fingers on the followers and pressing them gently, while the other 
hand loosens the guide and finally lifts it out. The figs will have pre- 
served the regularity with which they were packed and the line divi- 
sion between the bars kept straight and sharp and so perfect that a 
flat table knife may be drawn through the line without cutting the 
figs. This whole operation is quickly performed, and requires less 
time to be carried out than to be described. The pressing of other 
figs, packed with or without guides, in square, oblong, or round boxes, 
is accomplished in the same manner, easily modified to suit dif- 
ferent requirements. In 
the case of round boxes 
round followers must of 
course be used. 

If the pressure brought 
on the figs is very great 
the boxes may give and 
open while in the press. 
To avoid this there may 
be used a guard of galva- 
nized iron of such size as 
to snugly fit the box on 
the outside, the height of 
the guard being, how- 
ever, half an inch less 
than the box. The guard 
should not have a solid 
bottom, but one open in 
the center, a flange ex- 
tending for half an inch 
along the sides being suf- 
ficient. This is done in 
order that the box may be 
pushed out if pressed too 
tightly into the guard. If the boxes are strong and well made, even 
this flange may be dispensed with, the guard then taking the form of 
a single band fitting outside the fig box. 

After the guide has been lifted a final pressure may or may not be 
needed in order to allow the nailing on of the covers. The objects of 
[)ressing the figs are several. First, the necessity of having the pack 
solid, then to prevent evaporation and the drying out of the figs, etc. 
Smyrna figs are packed with pieces of sweet bay or laurel {Laurus 
nobilis) stuck here and there among the top layers. The aromatic 
smell of these leaves adds to the flavor of the figs and to the appear- 
ance of the box. The wild laurel (Oreodaphne calif ornica), which is 
yet more aromatic and pungent, answers the purpose equally well.

198 THE fig: its history, culture, and curing. 

In California the growers are now packing the figs in 5 and 10 
pound boxes. Instead of bars the figs are packed in slightly oblong 
blocks of 1 pound each. Each such fig block is wrapped separately 
in paraffin paper, and in some instances tied with a colored ribbon. 
Five or ten such blocks are placed in one box. This packing, while 
now much in use, is not to be recommended, as it hides the figs and 
the buyer does not know what he gets. The idea of packing the figs 
in blocks of 1 pound each is, however, an excellent one for small figs, 
but the largest figs could hardly be accommodated to such small 
blocks. 



CHAFl ER XIII. 
SHIPPING FRESH FIGS. 

Fresh figs are hardly known outside of the districts where they are 
grown, though few fruics are more relished when once introduced. In 
the large centers of population in -England and France fresh figs are 
counted among the indispensable luxuries, and many people are 
engaged in cultivating them for the market, either in hothouses or in 
the open air. Before rapid transportation became possible fresh figs 
could not be shipped any distance from the place where grown. Now 
figs may be sent 300 or 400 miles if properly packed. When the sys- 
tem of packing is better understood, and when special cars are devoted 
to transporting fresh figs, it will be possible to send them fresh and 
in good condition much greater distances without much risk or loss. 

There are two points to be kept in view in sending fresh figs. The 
figs must be picked when fully ripe, but before they have begun to 
shrivel, and they must not touch one another in the box. The best 
time to pick the fruit is an hour or two after sunrise, when all the dew 
has dried away. Figs picked when a light dry wind is blowing will 
keep longer. Only perfect figs should be used, and as nearly as pos- 
sible all should be of the same size, with no small figs mixed in. It 
will not pay to ship anything but the largest size of the best varieties. 
No uniform grade of boxes is possible, as each grade must depend upon 
the size of the figs and their shape and variety. The boxes should 
not weigh over 10 pounds, while 5-pound boxes would be even better. 
The ends should be of three-fourths, the bottom of one-half, and the 
sides and top of one-fourth inch boards. There should be an open 
crack between the pieces of the bottom and top, and the sides should 
have an open space of one- fourth of an inch at top and l)ottom. The 
boxes should be only deep enough to hold one layer of figs if the 
variety is tender, but if thick skinned it might hold two layers. 

In order to keep the figs from crowding one another long strips of 

paper are used. Any stiff white or brown paper will do. These strips 

are as long as the box and about twice as wide as the fig. The strip is 

folded lengthwise before being placed in the box. When in position, 

. half of the folded strip will rest on the bottom of the box, while the 

other half will stand up at right angles. In the angle between the two 

the figs are placed one by one in a single row, thus resting on the bot- 

199

200 THE fig: its history, culture, and curing. 

torn part of the strip, while the upright part separates two rows. 
Fresh fig leaves may be used in the same way, but are not quite so 
handy, though if properly placed they give a tasteful appearance to 
the box. 

Salicylic-acid paper and wax paper have also been recommended. 
The latter is less useful than the former, as it excludes the air. Sali- 
cylic paper aids in preserving the figs, and is cheap and practical. It 
may be used instead of common paper, or the common paper may be 
turned into salicylic paper by being sprinkled with a solution of sali- 
cylic acid in alcohol, in proportion of 1 pound of acid to 10 gallons of 
alcohol. 

But figs may be successfully shipped long distances by simply being 
packed in boxes without paper or leaves, the number of layers always 
to depend on the quality of the fig; but it is safe to say that even the 
most thick-skinned figs should preferably be placed only two layers 
deep, while very delicate figs should be packed in one layer only. 



CHAPTER XIV. 
HOW TO DESCRIBE FIGS. 

NAMES. 

In noting the names of figs in the following catalogue the writer has 
adopted the plan of first using the name under which he has found 
the fig best and most correctly described, or the name given in 
the locality where the fig is principallj'^ cultivated. The first name 
is thus that under which the fig is best known. All the subsequent 
names printed in other type are synonyms or names for the same vari- 
ety used elsewhere. The words within parentheses either indicate 
the localitj^ where grown or the author of the description. If there 
be doubt as to which, a reference to the published list will clear the 
doubt. Names have not been translated except in a few instances 
where the cultivation of the fig in English-speaking countries war- 
rants the use of an English name. Much harm and confusion have 
been caused by citations of only translated names, and if this custom, 
so often employed by theoretical writers, should be adopted, the final 
object of identification of all fig varieties suited to and valuable for 
cultivation would be lost. In some instances where the pronuncia- 
tion of the foreign name is especially difficult to English readers, the 
translated name has been given preference, with the foreign name 
following in different type as synonym. 

French or other names which begin with the article De la, etc., are 
arranged under their principal name. Thus the variety called De 
I'Archipel is found under Archipel, etc. As much as possible, such 
epithets as white, black, red, round, and long have been discarded, 
as they would too widely separate nearly related varieties in the cata- 
logue. For instance. White and Long Verdal are placed under the 
heading of Verdal, Long, etc., thus enabling the reader to compare 
the description of thie respective varieties more readily. 

VALUE OF VARIETIES. 

The list of names of figs and their descriptions are given for two dis- 
tinct reasons. The first reason is that we may learn of the figs 
grown in foreign countries, where fig culture has been successfully 
carried on for two thousand years or more, while our own fig culture 
dates back only forty years. Many growers constantly cry out that 
fig culture is not a success in California and that figs do not do as 
well here as in the old countries. In answer to this, the writer begs 
to point to the long list of fig varieties known, which at least proves 
that a large number of varieties is required in order to insure this suc- 

201 



202 THE fig: its history, culture, and curing. 

cess in foreign countries, and, furthermore, clearly establishes the fact 
that a fig which is eminently successful in one locality is as glaringly 
a failure in another country not so very far away. How, then, can we 
judge as to the suitability of any locality to the culture of the fig, 
with hardly a dozen varieties generally distributed and grown to select 
from, and with the erroneous idea commonly accepted that this coun- 
try already cultivates among that dozen all the best varieties of the 
Old World? Among the hundreds of varieties of value grown in the 
Mediterranean districts, some will no doubt be found to succeed in 
the Pacific States and ijrove valuable. But our true success will in 
time be based on our ability to originate new varieties suited to our 
conditions, which in many respects are very dissimilar to those of the 
fig countries of the Old World. This will not be done until the capri- 
fig and the Blastophaga have been well established here, when acci- 
dental seedlings will pave the way for more scientific and intelligent 
efforts to produce what we so much require — varieties suited to locali- 
ties where the figs are to be grown. 

Another object of this catalogue is to enable our growers, to some 
extent at least, to identify such varieties as they now grow under ficti- 
tious or wrong names. For many of these varieties the writer has 
been unable to procure descriptions; others are only imperfectly 
known — a defect which it is hoped will be corrected in time. 

DESCRIBING THE VARIETIES. 

Even in the best horticultural books figs have had little attention 
and have been insufficiently described. This is especially apparent 
in French books on horticulture, which is the more strange, as France 
is the country where more care is bestowed on fig culture and fruit 
culture generally than anywhere else. All late French authors have 
copied descriptions given by the older ones, without critical research 
and comparison; the nurserymen in their turn have copied from one 
another, and no one has apparently even attempted to describe a fig 
so that it could be reasonably well recognized. The great number of 
varieties and their distribution in widely separate countries have made 
comparisons veiy difficult. In order to remedy this a type collection 
of figs has been established at Niles, Cal., where about 130 varieties 
are now growing and in bearing. Some seventy-odd and mostly new 
varieties have been added lately by courtesy of the Secretary of Agri- 
culture. In properly describing a fig it is not sufficient to give size, 
shape, and color, as is so generally done, as there are scores of varie- 
ties in which these qualities are exactly similar, but which differ essen- 
tially in other points. A fig to be properly described must have all 
the following points mentioned and the same order of description must 
be followed, so that a comparison maybe readily made with other 
varieties. The description should begin with the most apparent char- 
acteristics and end with those less readily seen. The following are 
the principal features of the i\ix, hikI in describing these even the

experienced horticulturist would do well to use this list as a check 
list, taking up one cliaracter at a time in the same order of succession 
in which thej^ follow one another here: Crop, size, shape, neck, stalk, 
ribs, eye, iris, skin, color, pulp, meat, j^rowth of tree, branches, leaves, 
quality, soils. 

If any one of these points is not touched upon the description must 
be considered defective, though it may still be possible to recognize 
the variety, provided it possesses some very predominant character- 
istic which readily distinguishes it from other figs. For students or 
horticulturists who examine many varieties a blank is recommended 
with the above headings, each on a separate line, ready to be filled out. 
In order that the descriptions may be fully understood it will be 
necessary to consider each heading separately. 

Crop. — It is always necessary to mention first how many crops the 
fig tree matures, and then describe each crop separately if both are 
of importance. If in the following no particular crop is mentioned, 
the description always refers to the second crop. In copying descrip- 
tions of figs from Northern authors we can be almost certain that the 
first crop is referred to, provided the figs have been grown out of 
doors, and generally so even if cultivated under glass, as figs suitable 
for such purpose are generally, though not always, those which mature 
a first crop. 

Size. — Roughly estimated, the size might be indicated as '* small," 
' ' medium, " or * ' large. " I would consider all 1 inch or less in diameter 
as "small;" those between 1 and 2 inches as "medium," and those 
above 2 inches as ' ' large. " An average fig should be taken, one neither 
too large nor too small. The measurement should be made from the 
neck to the eye, or, to be more accurate, from the junction of the stalk 
and neck to the eye. For ' ' width " the greatest diameter at right angles 
to the former should always be given, and in order to indicate the 
exact shape it is necessary to state whether the greatest width is at 
the center, below the center, or at the apex. To English readers the 
English inch is the most common measure, continental writers using 
the centimeter only. A scale of reference showing the relation between 
these two measures is appended (fig. 33).

the fig is "pear-shaped" or ''turbinate," with rounded top; if at the 
apex, the fig is *' bell-shaped," and if the apex or surface around the 
eye is flattened out, the fig may be called "obtuse," or flattened at 
apex like an onion. The shape of figs maj'^ be classified under two 
heads, round or oblong. " Round " figs are those in which both diame- 
ters are of the same length or in which the width is greater than the 
length from stalk to eye. ' ' Oblong " or " turbinate " figs are all whose 
length is decidedly greater than the width. The length of the respec- 
tive diameters enables the fig to be divided into two general classes, 
the characteristics of which are fairly constant. A better expression 
for a round fig would be globular, but as the word "round" has been 
generally adopted by other writers, no change has been made. 

Neck. — The neck of the fig is the part situated nearest to the stalk. 
The neck may be ' ' none " or * ' absent ; " " no neck " if the fig is entirely 
globular; or it may be " short " if about one-fourth the long diameter 
of the fig; "medium" is above that, but not reaching one-half the 
length of the long diameter of the fig, and "long" if above half the 
length of the fig. The neck must not be confounded with the stalk, as 
is often done. The neck is part of the main body of the fig; the stalk 
is the part outside of the fig proper, which connects the fig with the 
branch on which it is suspended. The neck may be " well set" if it is 
considerably narrower than the body of the fig, or it may be " gradu- 
ally tapering " to the stalk; or it may be "very thin," " slender," or 
"compressed sideways," all of these expressions being readily under- 
stood. (See fig. 34.) 

Stalk, — The stalk connects the neck or body of the fig with the 
branch upon which it is suspended, and should never be considered 
in the measurement of the fig. It is of greatest importance to know 
the average length of the stalk, as it varies much with different varie- 
ties, being "short," "medium," "long," or "very long." The same 
expression is used in regard to the neck. The stalk may be " rounded," 
"flat," "three-cornered," etc., all points which should be noted in 
describing a fig. The length of the stalk varies to some extent in the 
same variety, and care must be taken to give a true average or to note 
any unusual.variatiou in length, thickness, etc. It is also of impor- 
tance to note whether the stalk breaks off readily from the branch or 
must be cut off when the fig is ripe. (See fig. 34.) 

iJifts.— The ribs are longitudinal ridges running from stalk to eye. 
They may be confined to the neck, to the body of the fig, or may 
extend to the eye. They are higher or lower, or take the shape of 
mere lines, generally colored darker. They may branch, or higher 
ribs may alternate with lower ones, or they may partly dissolve them- 
selves into warts. Some figs possess no trace of ribs; in others the 
ribs fade out or fuse at eye or neck. (See fig. 34.) 

Eye. — The eye is the opening in the broad end or apex of the fig. 
It may be "closed" or "open," and there are various degrees of 



HOW TO DESCRIBE FIGS. 



205 



openness. The eye maybe "sunk" if below the surface of the fig; it 
may be on a level with that surface, or it may be ''protruding." In 
such cases it is generally surrounded by an elevated ridge, like a 
crater. The "iris" is a colored zone surrounding the scales of the 
eye, situated between them and the elevated ridge. It is not iden- 
tical with the ridge itself. Some writers refer to the eye as the 
' * mouth " of the fig or the * ' ostiolum. " (See fig. 34. ) 

Scales. — The scales closing the eye are either "few" or "many," 
"broad" or "narrow," "colored" or "pale," "margined" or "uni- 
form" in color. They are "flat," or they may stand out upright, or 
may even greatly protrude. 

Sifem.— The skin is "smooth," "warty," "rough," "hairy" or 
"downy," "glossy," "waxy," etc., all these expressions being readily

understood. It may be dotted over with light specks or large spots. 
It may be "thick" or "thin," adhering to the meat or readily sepa- 
rated. The skin may also be "tough" or "tender," and finally it 
may crack at maturity in longitudinal or in transverse lines, deep 
enough to show the meat underneath. This cracking of the skin 
must, of course, not be confounded with the cracking or splitting open 
of the fig under unfavorable conditions. 

Color, — The color should be given, separately, if necessary, both 
for neck, body, and apex, eye, iris, scales, for shaded side or for the 
side exposed to the sun. The fig varies considerably in color. For 
instance, the Adriatics grown in the vicinity of San Francisco Bay 
always retain a green or bluish-green color, while in the interior they

often turn bright golden yellow, etc. This variation in color is the 
greatest obstacle to a proper description of the fig, and it is therefore 
of importance to ^Iways state where the description was made. 

Pidjp and meat — The pulp is the inner soft part of the fig surround- 
ing the seeds. Between the pulp and the skin is found the meat. 
While the pulp is often red, the meat is rarely so, though it is often 
streaked red or violet. The pulp may be *' white," "yellow," "red," 
"purple," "opaline," "rose," "streaked," etc., and maybe "coarse" 
or "fine." The pulp and the meat should never be confounded, but 
mentioned separately. 

Seeds. — The seeds are either ' ' large " or " small, " * ' few " or " many " — 
relative terms, of course, but terms which may be used to great advan- 
tage. The size of the seeds of the imported Smyrna figs may be con- 
sidered as a standard with which to compare others. 

Qrowth, — The growth of the tree may be "strong" or "weak," 
"upright," with many or few branches, or with drooping branches, 
etc. The leaves are either "large" or "small," "entire" or "deeply 
lobed," "dark" or "light," "glossy" or "hairy," "regular" or "lop- 
sided." The lobes are either 3, 5, or 9 in number, or the margin may 
be "entire." They may be "acute," " pointed," "rounded," "obtuse," 
"cuneate," "wavy," or "smooth." As the leaves vary on each tree, 
an average leaf adjoining a fig should always be taken as a model for 
description. Finally, it should be stated whether the stalk of the 
leaf is unusually "short" or "long," "dark" or "light. " 



CHAPTER XV. 

CATAIiOaXJE AND DESCRIPTION OF FIGS, INCLUDING SMTBNA 
FIGS AND CAPBIFIGS. 

In the following catalogue the names of figs printed in black-face 
type are those which stand as distinct varieties. Those printed in 
italics are synonymous with others, and should be looked for under 
the respective names given immediately following. Where more 
than one name is known the most desirable name is that given at 
the beginning of the line, while the names in italics following are 
less-known ones. Names within parentheses indicate the locality 
where grown. For instance, Brayasque (Provence) indicates that 
the name is used in Provence, France. Ficus sylvestris var. festina- 
tissima, Geny, indicates that Geny is the author who named the 
variety. The word ''variety" is abbreviat'Cd to "var." 

Most of the descriptions are based upon examination of figs grown 
in California, especially at Niles, where are found the United States 
Government collection and the private collection of Mr. John Rock. 
Some descriptions have been taken from foreign works on figs, but 
only in cases when the variety has not been seen by the author. 

Abakour amellal. — A white fig, the name meaning early white; extensively grown 
in Eabylia. Two crops. 

Abakour aberkan. — A black fig from Eabylia. Bears many and very good first- 
crop figs called '*bakonr." The word means early black. 

Abelr'endjour.— A black fig from Kabylia which does not require caprification. 

Aberzigzaou. — A white fig from Kabylia. 

A bois et fruit Jasp^ — Jasper. 

A hois Jospe— Jasper. 

Abondance—FRANCUE Paillard. 

Abondance,— Said to be another name for Versailles. 

Abouh'archaou.— A white fig from Kabylia. Is not caprified. 

Aboulil.— A white fig from Kabylia. Produces two crops. 

Abouremman.— A black fig from Kabylia. Does not require caprification. 

Abouzouggar.— A white fig from Kabylia. Requires caprification. 

Adam.— Size medium, roundish turbinate, or flattened at apex, with short or no 
neck, which when present is distinct. Eye rough, with distinct iris. Scales 
rosy amber. Skin with distinct, shallow ribs, yellowish, with dingy brown 
flesh, dull, not waxy. Pulp dull amber to red. Meat thick, slightly rosy. 
Quality medium, bat a very handsome fig when grown well. Leaves small, 
five-lobed, shallow, crenated, 6 inches long by 7 inches wide. Two crops. 
First crop above medium, turbinate, about 3 inches long by 2 inches wide. 
Neck medium to large. Stalk small. Eye large, with brown, protruding 
scales. Color of skin dull green, witn a violet flush along the ribs and on the 
sunny side. Meat yellow. Pulp amber- white, with brown streaks. 

A very handsome as well as good fig, desirable on account of its brebas. 
The second crop is less desirable. The first crop is excellent around Niles, Cal.

208 THE fig: its history, culture, and curing. 

Adriatic— (rrosse Verte; Netnan; Nvbian (?); FicodiFragola; Strawberry Fig; Ver- 
done (Rome); White Adriatic; Parker^s Smyrna; Delamater^s (California). — 
Size above medium ; shape v ari able, more or less rounded turbinate ; the first crop 
more round than the second crop. Neck medium, stalk short. Ribs obscure. 
Eye open, with red iris. Skin very thin, greenish in shade, in sunlight bright 
greenish-yellow or yellow, according to locality where grown. Pulp bright 
strawberry red or in some localities violet-dark red with violet streaks in the 
whitish meat. A good and strong grower with large, shady, round head. 
Leaves deeply 5-lobed, oblong, bright, glossy green. Two crops. The first 
crop drops or if it stays is small and of x>oor quality, and ripens frequently 
with the second crop. If caprificated the first crop matures and becomes of 
very good quality. (PI. XIV.) Extensively' planted in California. Should 
never be planted extensively except where it is known to do weU. 

A fig of varying qualities, according to the locality where grown. Prefers 
rich, alluvial soil, not too moist. Most excellent at At water and in the vicin- 
ity of Niles, and in many other localities in California. Better in the foot- 
hills than on the interior plains. In wet places the fig bursts and sours badly. 
In localities where the fig does well it must be considered as one of our very 
best figs. It is not identical with the fig known as Adriatic in Italy. The 
three names under which it nas been known in California were given by 
growers who desired to sell young trees or cuttiugs. It was introduced into 
California from Italy by very early settlers in the fifties, one of the first trees 
being planted at Big Oak Flat, in the Sierra Nevada foothills. In most local- 
ities this variety will be superseded by better kinds. 

Agen — Grosse du Draguignan. — Medium, rounded turbinate, fiattened at apex; 
skin thin, green with a brownish tint; a deep brown chocolate with mixed 
green around the apex. Eye open, iris reddish brown. Pulp dark red, very 
sirupy and sweet. One of the beet figs, where it does well. Should be tried 
everywhere. Ripens very late. Requires caprification at Niles. 

Ajenjar. — A black fig from Kabylia. Bears two crops. 

Albi primaticci — Albo. 

AUncello — Albo. 

Alhicougris — Bordeaux.

Aldr.; Albicdlo (Toscana); Mattaro (Lunigiana); Fieo Dorato (Altrepo 
Pavese); Biancolini (Milan); Fichid' Oro (Piacentino); Moscadello (Como); 
Ficozentil (Verona) ; Gentile (Bologna).— Size 2i by 2} inches or over. Shape 
round-obtuse, and flattened at apex. Largest diameter at apex or below cen- 
ter, no neck, stalk medium. Rios in mature fruit indistinct. Eye medium, 
open, scales large, amber-rose. Meat white, pulp amber with a few large 
seeds. Skin bright yellow, more so than in most jther figs, not excluding the 
Gentile. Leaves large, 3 to 5 lobed, much longer than wide, the end lobe 
being pointed, margins wavy, surface quite hairy or pubescent, more so than 
most other varieties. Growth of tree medium. Two crops, the brebas being 
larger and more flattened than t h e BB y ! ?0ii ff'6rop./ One of the best Italian 'figs, 
generally cultivated all over that country, and only inferior in quality to 
PissALUTTO and Dottato. Prefers moist and rich soils, and especially si^dy 
loams. It is the cherished fig in the markets of Pavia and Milaiio, where it is 
sold under name of Biancolini or Moscadello, (Fig. 35.) 

Albo Master.— A white Italian fig. 

Amarouna — Amaroun; Ficus aniara (Risso); Fictis dylo var. amanda, Geny;

bloom bet\\een the ribs at ths stalk end. Pulp varying from deep brownish 
amber to deep violet-brown amber, sometimes distinctly rosy. Meat greenish 
white. Pulp line, juicy, sugary, and sirapy, but with little flavor. Leaves 
large, entire or trilobate, in which case the lobes are ahfillow. Tree a strong, 
handsome grower, with a dense crown and upright limbs. A most valuable 
fig and one of the best at Niles. The description is made from figs ripe Octo- 
ber 8. This variety is distinct from Angelique, from which it differs in the 
size and form of the fruit, its deeper flesh or pulp, its larger and more entire 
leaves. This will probably prove a tine table fig , superior to the Adriatic. Hogg 
does not mention this fig, his description referring to the Angelique proper. 
These two figs can not be considered as nearly related varieties, but are quite 
distinct. The ^g described above was originally received from Thomas Riv- 
ers & Son under the name of Angelique. The identification is made from 
descriptions of Angelique Jaune by French nurserymen. (Fig. 36.) 

Angelique Noire.— Size below medium, roundish or oblate, skin dark, flesh bright 
red, rich. Strong grower and moderate cropper. (Barron.)

Leaves medium or below, 5-lobed. 

Arhauda — Rubado. 

^rbicowe— San Pedro, Black. 

Archipel — De VArchipeL — Large obovate, variable in size and shape, 2| by If 
inches or 2^ by 2i inches; neck short, but sharply set off. Ribs indistinct or 
indicated by lines. Eye flat, small, closed by pink amber scales surrounded by 
a rough iris. Skin smooth, especially around the eye. < olor, olive green to 
reddish purple, mottled all over with minute, round, and larger oblong gray 
spots; near the stalk end the color is light olive green. Pulp tender, very pale 
or white opaline- amber: very fine, with small seeds. Meat white. Now and 
then there is a rosy fiber ivjjthe pulp. A very tender fig. but not h ghly flavored. 
Leaves medium to small; 8-lobed, deep green, rather glossy. According to 
English authors the color is more chestnut brown. First crop: Large, obo- 
vate, 3^ inches long by. 2 inches wide. Ribs indistinct, outlined by violet 
streaks. Ntpk short and gradual. Stalk very short. Eye smalt with white,

or turbinate, If inches in diameter, with indistinct ribs at the stalk, depressed 
at apex. Skin rou^h, color whitish, flushed with yellow and green, no bloom. 
Pulp pale-red, opaline toward the stal : ; very sweet but not highly flavored. 
One of the best drying figs of good drying and keeping qualities. This fig is 
distinct from the White Marseillaise, which possesses white or amber -colored 
pulp, and which is also an equally fine fig for drying. Cultivated in 
Provence around Marseilles, Nice, etc.

Atwater.— Length abont 2^ inches, width abont 2| inches, of average large fruit. 
Stalk and neck very short; fruit flattened or sometimes slight y turbinate, with 
broad and indistinct ribs from stalk end, which in the zone of the eye become 
more numerous, narrower, and quite distinct to very distinct. Cheeks uneFen, 
swollen, and somewhat angular. Slight bluish bloom. Skin very waxy,, of a 
yellowish-green color, somewhat streaked yellow and green, the yellow pre- 
dominating around stalk and eye; few white specks. Eye large, or very 
large, open scales protruding, of a brown color edged dingy white. Eye, 
except scales, rather flat or even sunk. Meat yellowish white, very thick or 
wider— indeed, in some figs thicker— than the pulp. Pulp, just before real 
maturity, pinkish, but at full maturity amber white, transparent; in some figs 
here and there flushed pink. First crop ripe by July 1, It is a very delicious 
fig, resembling Peters White, but has less pink in the pulp, while the latter 
has less vinous acid and is less flavored. Peters White is the superior ot* the 
two varieties growing side by side in Merced County, Cal. Atwater ripens 
about one week before Peters White. Second crop is much smaller, but sweet.

Brebas. — Brebas is a Spanish name for any first 
crop of figs and is applied to figs of any size 
and color. It corresponds to **nore," 
"figues fleures," etc., and does not refer to 
any certain variety, meaning early. The 
variety imported by Professor Pohndorff 
from Spain to California, under the name 
of ** Breba," is the San Pedro White, which, 
as is well known, matures only the first 
crop. From Prof. E. W. Hilgard the author 
has learned that another fig is also sold in 
Malaga as Brebas, but the fig is very much 
larger, oblong, and exceedingly handsome, 
and yellow. In Mexico the popular idea is 
generally that the **Breba" is a special 
kind of fig.

pjrrif or m, rather cylindricfd, 
with swollen cheeks, one of 
which is the larger; apex 
very obtuse, neck and stalk 
very short; ribs distinct, but 
not much elevated, few and

not waxy ; pulp amber. Sec- 
ond crop medium or below, 
otherwise not much differ- 
ent from, the brebas. Tree 
is quite small, with strag- 
gling branches, deeply cut 
leaves, which on account of 
their small number as well 
as size give little shade. A 
very hardy fig, with large 
crops of medium quality. 
This fig, which is variously 
and erroneously known in 
California and in the United 
States generally as Brown Turkey, Smyrna, etc., was, until the introduction 
of the Adriatic, the most common white fig in the first-mentioned State. 
The very large dingy white and brown Brebas are the first figs in the San 
Francisco market, but they are watery, not sweet, and otherwise poor in 
quality, although very juicy. (Fig. 48.)

Bucuelle— France. 

Bulletin B/acA:— Purple Smyrna. (See Smyrna figs. p. 279. ) 

Bulletin Smyrna— hOB Inqir.— Under this name four distinct varieties imported 
from Smyrna have been distributed by G. P. Rixford, of the San Fraacisco 
Evening Bnlletin. For a history of these figs see ** Early fig culture in Cali- 
fornia. " It was soon found that the figs dropped regularly before maturity, 
and up to the year 1891 not a single fig had matured. That year some 30 figs 
were pollinated by Mr. E. W. Maslin and the author, all apparently arriving at 
full and perfect maturity, 
thus proving the value of 
the figs and their genuine- 
ness. Previous to this, 
however, most of the fig 
trees distributed had been 
destroyed as unproductive.

this fig, differing in shape, size, and color of the fruit, as well as in the shape of 
the leaves, which in some are almost entire, in others very deeply lobed. Some 
varieties bear three crops a year, others two, and some only one crop. The 
varieties are suited to different localities. The caprifig is indigenous to south-

with longitudinal bands of bi-ight, lively green, some of which are broad, others 
narrow. Eye closed, snrrounded by a narrow iris; pnlp bright rose, very sweet 
and delicions. This fig is similar in quality to the white Col, but with shorter 
neck and a distinct variegated skin and paler-colored pulp. It is not an exten- 
sively cultivated fig, on account of inferior hearing qualities, but for a garden 
fig it is much to be recommended, as it would sell well in any market. This 
fig is, however, inferior to the black Signora.

Cal. Exact location unknown to the author. The fig is very juicy, sweet, 
and pulpy; but the male zone is, as usual, very dry. The fig is one of the 
sweeter kinds, but devoid of flavor. The characteristic male flowers of this 
flg place it close to the Croisic fig, as described by Professor Solms-Laubach.

latitudes. It keeps long and transports more readily to distant lociities than 
almost any other fig. Tree strong grower; leaves small, 3-lobed. 

Dauphine Violette — Dauphine. 

Baurada — Ficus lutea Risso; Ficus carica var. chrysocarpa Geny. — Below medium, 
li to If inches long; globular, flattened at apex, color bright greenish yellow,

crop). Stalk very short or none; ribslow; skin smooth when fully ripe; shaded 
ribs; eye medium, closed or semiopen; scales small, pink colored. Skin thin,

few figs, 1 or 2 dozen to the tree. Second crop abundant; leaves broad, round, 
3 lobed. Tree a heavy grower and fine bearer. One of the very best tigs, suit- 
able for drying. The Dottato is the best-known fig in Toscana, and from there 
extends to southern Italy, and is the most valuable fig for drying there. The 
largest part of Italian exported dried figs is of this variety, and better than the 
Bourgasotte. The Dottato loves rich and moist soils and is not suitable for 
dry lands. - Gallesio supposes the Dottato to be identical with the Smyrna 
varieties, which is a mistake; neither is it identical with the Datte as grown 
around Salon and Eyrique, in Provence. This latter fig has a dark, rosy pulp, 
but is otherwise similar to the Dottato, and is probably a variety of that Italian

waxy, of a pale bluish-green with a darker green on the exx)osed side. Pnlp 
amber, with rosy streaks and with many exceedingly minnte seeds, and of 
a fine texture. This fig does not belong to the Marseillaise class. It has 
smaller seeds and a finer meat and palp, and is also more oblong than that 
ti^. It is a most excellent fig and one of the very beat figs grown in Califor- 
nia. Is suitable for drying as well as fresh. In some localities it is prefera- 
ble to the Marseillaise. This fig can not be too highly recommended and 
will no doubt become one of the most extensively grown figs in California 
and Arizona. (Fig. 58.) 

Du Roy—Dv Roi. 

Early Hovnck— -Brown Turkey. 

Early Violet.— Very small to small. Bound, turbinate, with swollen and pro- 
truding cheeks; neck distinct, but short; stalk medium to long; ribs distinct, 
somewhat elevated, sometimes much elevated. Eve large, sunk, closed; scales 
large, rosy red, with small iris. Skin rough and uneven, violet brown with 
red flush and a thin peach- 
colored bloom, which does 
not quite reach the eye. 
Pulp red, fine, and sweet. 
This fig, though small, 
bears' continuously and is 
valuable on that account. 
Preferable to the Ischias 
and Celeste. (Fig. 59.) 

Early White— Early Yellow; 
Small Early White; Jaune

stalk short; ribs shallow; 
eye very large, open; 
skin greenish-yellow, no 
bloom, quite thick; pulp 
of first crop dingy opaline 
in center, surrounded by 
a broad band of muddy 
but distinctly violet pulp, 
rather coarse, but sweet. 
Second crop has the pulp white, with occasionally a trace of violet around 
the margin. In drying the pulp turns violet-black. Tree ispfmedium size, 
leaves woolly, lobes shallow and rounded. Introduced Tfom Itaiy by "W. B. 
West, but sold to Mr. Endrich, of Stockton, Cal. , who lost the original name. 
Again propagated, and distributed by Mr. W. B. West and others under 
the name of Endrich. Generally a poor fig, but said in some localities 
to be very excellent; especially so around Stockton, according to Mr. West, 
Farther inland, in the San Joaquin Valley, this fig is very poor and almost 
worthless. Some trees sent out under this name are identical with Bubado.

Figue /r«7imcatw— Franciscan a. 

Figue d'Or,— It is doubtful if this is a synonym of Brunswick, as stated by several 
continental writers. Students of hothouse figs are too ready to lump figs, 
received under different names, together as synonyms, relying principally upon 
resemblances of the first crop, the second crop seldom maturing under glass, 
or at least not maturing to perfection. Thus it has come to pass that many 
of the synonyms given by Dr. Hogg are in reality distinct figs, but which show 
only their true characteristics when growing in suitable localities out of doors 
and in climates favorable to the full development of the figs.

very short, but distinct, like a stalk; stalk none; ribs not elevated, but colored 
darker; eye open, medium size, sunk below the cheeks, but slightly elevated 
at the scales; scales, many in the row (9 or 10), irregular, red; skin, smooth, 
dark, violet in sun, greenish in shade, sometimes greenish with violet flesh. 
Light-gray bloom; pulp rosy red, coarse; meat, rosy white. A very large fig, 
heavy crops and strong growth, coarse quality. The above fig is a different 
fig from the fig described under that name by Dr. Hogg, who regards it 
identical with Marseillaise. (Figs. 60, 61.) 

Ford Seedling— Ford, 

Fourrassa — Figafourrassa (Nice); Ficus sylvestris yar. monstruosa, Greny. — Sec-

or greenish-yellow color, marked with small dots; pulp, red, juicy; medium 
quality. One of the largest figs, but of doubtful value. Nice and its vicinity. 

Franche Paillard — Ahondanee; D'Abondance; Franque Pagarde. — Two crops. 
First crop: Medium, oblong; skin light brown; pulp salmon-red. Second 
crop: Medium, pear-shaped, violet-brown color, green in shade; pnlp red, 
vinous, and juicy, but not always sweet. An enormous bearer, of value only 
in few favored localities in France, where it is extensively cultivated, or at 
least distributed.

2 to. 2^ inches diameter, turbinate, flattened at apex; skin cracking; color 
bright greenish- violet; pulp juicy, honey like, blood-red or of the color of the 
red pomegranate. A fig good for drying, but it cracks and splits wide open 
like a flower after having been exposed to a rain storm. Not uncommon in 
the Riviera around Nice, France.

pie, almost black, with a thick blue bloom; pulp yellowish nearly to the meat, 
reddish or red toward center; juicy, sweet, and rich. Said by Hogg to be the 
most c^mmon black tig in Languedoc and Provence. This is not now the case. 
Genoa, White — White Genoa.— Size above medium, 2| by H inches; shape pyri-^ 
form; neck small, not set off; stalk very short; ribs very shallow, merely ele-' 
vated lines. Skin downy; eye very small, not elevated, open, pale pink-amber. 
Skin pale olive-green with yellow cheek, drawing to pale yellow-amber, mot- 
tled with russet around the eye; color of neck the same. Pulp varying from 
amber to pale rose and darker red; under the skin pale greenish- white. Tree a 
strong grower, with, open head; branches brittle, breaking readily; leaves very 
large, deep green, 5-lobed. One of the best tigs, entirely distinct from the 
Marseillaise, which is given as a synonym by Dr. Hogg— not even belonging

to the same class. It is undoubtedly one of the best figs grown in California. 
The identity of this tig is, however, not fully established, and it may be possi- 
ble that it is identical with some of the many Italian figs not yet introduced 
to this country or even adequately described. The origin of the name under 
which this fig came to California is not known. (Fig. 62. ) 
Gentile — Tiburtina, Pliny; Gentile sub-lutei; Gentile Bianchi; Fichi Dori; Fico 
UOro; La Gentile; Ficus pulchella, Bisso; Dr, KimhalVs White (Hay wards, 
Cal.).— First crop: Very large, 2^ by 3 inches; shape ovate-pyriform, widest 
below the center; neck swollen, very distinct, well set, but not long; stalk 
very short; skin uneven, with ridges, which become less at perfect maturity: 
skin adheres to pulp; eye very large, open, with the scales protruding. Color 
green, shaded to canary or yellow, spotted white, darker green in the shade. 
Pulp amber, translucent, very sweet and highly flavored, streaked with rose; 
seed few, but very large. Leaves 3-lobed, very large, of dark-green color 
similar to that of Brogiotto-Genovese and Sanguinello Pisa. Large tree 
with the lower branches very long and weeping; the upper branches tall

highly flavored of all figs, and should be generally cultivated. It grows best 
in deep, rich bottom lands with moist ground, and does not take well to dry 
hills. So far only a few figs of this variety are grown in California. The old- 
est tree in the State is found on Dr. Kimball's place, near Hay wards (Alameda 
County). Other trees, now 8 years old, are grown at Knights Ferry. The 
second crop drops there, as it does in Italy and elsewhere. The climate of 
Knights Ferry is very warm and dry, while that of Niles and Hay wards is

moist and comparatively cool. It was supposed for years that all that this fig 
required was a warm and dry air in order to ripen the second crop. But its 
failure to do so, even in the hottest place, satisfies the author that it belongs 
to the San Pedro ^class, which requires caprification for the second crop, the 
flowers of which are apparently perfect female flowers. It appears that in 
Italy several figs are known as Gentile, but the one described above is the 
true Gentile, and no other varieties should bear that name. (Figs. 63, 64, 65.)

colored darker than the skin, of a violet brown. Eye small, open, slightly ele- 
vated, amber violet, with a dark iris. Skin downy, of a dark violet amber in the 
sun, turning to a pale olive green with yellow flush, with darker violet ribs in the 
shade. Bloom a very fine violet-pearl gray extending to the cheek, but not to 
the apex zone from which it is separated by a distinct line, between which and 
the apex there is no trace of the bloom. This is the most characteristic feature 
of this fig. Pulp deep red or dark rose; meatpale, greenish white. A very ten-

Orosse Rouge de Bordeaux— ^ath Pedro, Black.— It is doubtful if this is synonym 
of Black San Pedro. It is not a synonym of Bordeaux, which is a smaller fig. 

Orosse Savantine Bif^re — Grosse Grise Bif^re. — Under this name the author has 
received from the Royal Horticultural Society of London a fig in every respect 
identical with Grosse Grise 
Bifero, characterized by the 
peculiar arrangement of the 
bloom of that fig. The bloom 
is absent from the apex near

generally well set, but very short; ribs few, rough, wavy, but shallow, dis- 
appearing, and irregular; eye medium, flat, with low iris, scales pale amber; 
skin smooth, except for ribs, rather waxy, greenish on one side, violet olive 
on the other. Pulp amber white; meat white, very juicy and good, but not 
highly flavored. Second crop mora turbinate and resembles Brunswick less 
than first crop. Tree a very strong grower with a fine head. Leaves medium

cultivated around Tiavira, in Algarve. The second crop he designates as 
" figos vendimos,'' which is probably an error, the author having good ground 
to believe that the '* figos vendimos " ome from a different variety. This fig 
belongs to the San Pedro class, the trees sent to Niles through the Department 
of Agriculture having matured splendid second-crop figs after having been 
caprificated. It is certain, however, that the Lampeira is one of the finest of 
all first-crop figs, and that it should be widely distributed. What the White 
San Pedro is for Andalusia in. producing the luscious brebas the Lampeira is 
for southern Portugal. (Fig. 71.) 

Lardaro. — Size large to medium, often 3 inches long by If wide. Neck long, taper- 
ing from the center of the fig. Stalk very short. Numerous ribs, which are 
warty and irregular. Eye flat, small, but open. Color of skin olive-yellow, 
with dingy violet brown ribs. Stalk and neck green without the brown. Eye 
with a violet iris, the scales being small and not prominent. No prominent 
bloom. Pulp rosy violet, rather pale. Inside hollow. Meat thick, white or 
yellow. The pulp is very coarse, but pleasant. Tree is a medium grower, with 
large 3-lobed leaves. Branches straggling spreading. An abundant crop- 
per. In form this fig resembles Pied du Boeuf . The most common tig around 
Naples, Italy. Valued on account of its abundant crop.

250 THE fig: its history, culture, and curing. 

Before full matnrity the pulp is streaked red. Requires caprification. The 
figs of the caprificated Smyrna fig should never be cut from the tree, but be 
allowed to fall naturally to the ground. The dropping of the ripe figs always 
occurs at the proper time— that is, when the figs are fully ripe and ready for 
drying. If the figs are cut from the tree before they are ready to drop they 
will remain hard and inferior. In order to insure a perfect dried fig the groand 
under trees should be soft and mellow and there should be no large clods. As 
soon as the figs have dropped they are at once picked up and examined. 
Many of them are ready for packing without further drying. In case they 
are too moist or pulpy one or two days' exposure to the sun should suffice to 
bring them to the proper state of desiccation for packing. This is the true 
Smyrna fig of commerce, grown and extensively cultivated in the valley of 
the Meander near Smyrna. It is a distinct hg, and this and no other fig should 
be known as Smyrna, if this name is to be used at all. The promiscuous use of 
the name Smyrna figs can not be too much condemned. (See Smyrna figs, 
p. 278.)

prominent and rough, especially toward the stalk, while diminishing in prom- 
inence toward the eye, but entirely disappearing immediately around it. 
Stalk longer than one-half the fig eye open, comparatively large, but depressed; 
scales very small and few ol a pale whitish amber. Skin greenish-yellow or 
yellow on cheek, greenish in the shade; pulp amber white; meat white. A 
very delicious little fig, far superior to the Ischias and the Celestes. (Fig. 72. ) 
The above description is taken from fig trees imported from France by Mr. 
Qillet to California and grown in Santa Clara Valley. They differ from those 
received by the Royal Horticultural Society of London, as seen below. Dr. 
Hogg gives Madeleine as synonymous with Angelique, which is erroneous, 
Angelique is a distinct fig of larger size, much more flattened, and^ of the 
shape of a flat onion. 

Madeleine— De la Madeleine.Size medium; 2^ inches long by If inches wide; 
pyriform; lopsided. Ko distinct neck and very small stalk. Bibs shallow, 
numerous, confluent; eye medium, open; scales large. Skin waxy, cracking, 
of a yellowish-green color; pulp coarse, rosy amber and pure amber toward 
stalk end. Vinous and juicy, but not highly flavored. Tree strong grower, 
with large, coarse, shallow, 3-lobed leaves, about 9 inches long by 8 wide, 
woolly underneath. This fig was received thus named from the Boyal Horti- 
cultural Society of London. It is a distinct fig from the true Magdalen.

Mission Fig Tree, California. 



CATALOGUE AKD DESCRIPTIOK OF FIGS. 255 

IS a good grower, with the lower branches drooping, and light bark. Leaves 
5-lobed, glossy, longer than broad and lighter green than most other figs, and 
most characteristically mottled with lighter, yellowish green. A coarse fig, 
which, however, thrives and bears well almost everywhere. It dries well and 
when dry is rather of pleasant quality and seems especially adapted to Cali- 
fornia and Arizona, where it is extensively distributed. Also common in 
Sonora and Baja California, and probably in other of the Pacific States. 
Introduced by the Franciscan missionaries in the eighteenth century. There 
is only one variety of Mission fig. The general belief that the Mission is a 
distinct California fi^ is erroneous. We can no more lay exclusive claim to 
this fig than can Mexico and Chile. It was undoubtedly brought from Spain or 
Portugal at a very early date after the conquest. The early padres and mis- 
sionaries in the Pacific coast States cultivated no other variety of fig. (PI. XV. )

slightlv elevated, narrow, but very distinct down to the apex, but not so 
marked on neck. Eye very open, scales large, dark amber, iris slightly 
elevated from a surrounding depression, with faint color of dark green; skin 
dark bluish-green, even all around, or the shaded side only slightly paler in 
snn, mottled with dark amber. Thin bloom; pulp dark rose; meat amber 
yellow. A very good, juicy fig, splendid for table; does well at Niles, Cal.

let, somewhat bronzy; skin thick; pulp brown. Good. 

Monege blanche— France. 

Monginence—Dovqv^iRA Negra. 

Monnoire.— Medium; rounded; green. France. 

Monstreuse.— Medium, about 2^ by If inches wide; turbinate, with a short, thin 
neck, bent and well set; no stalk. Skin smooth, with faint, irregular, and 
crenated ridges; apex flat; eye medium to small, open, with erect scales. 
Skin waxy, covered with a fine bloom around the stalk and ending sharply 
before the equator i^ reached. Color uniform pale green; pulp brownish 
salmon, dense, vinous, but not highly flavored. Leaves large, aoout 10 inches, 
Slobed, without spurs, very coarse underneath. This fig is said by Rev. Dr. 
W. Wilks, secretary- Royal Horticultural Society of London, to be identical 
with Grosse Monstreuse de Lipari, but the fig sent by him and from which 
the above description is taken is not identical with that fig, which is said by 
Hogg to be brown in color. 

Monteg^aa*— Above medium. A drying fig. 

Moresca— (?enh7Za Roussa (Nice) ; Ficus sylvestria var. maunritanica Geny. — Two

with a very long neck. Color bright gray: eye star shaped, raised, red; pulp 
pale red or yellowish. Grown around Nice, France, and supposed to have 
been introduced from Algiers.

crop almost globular, turbinate. If inches long by 2 to 2^ inches wide; broader 
than long, flattened at apex. Skin thin, fine, tender, of a blackish violet color, 
with blue bloom. Eye reddish; pulp red, soft, very isweet and like a date in 
taste. Best of all the early figs, but inferior to Bamissotto Black, which, how- 
ever, is later. Leaves 5-16bed, crenate, lobes acute. First crop longer, very 
few. Requires a soil neither too dry nor too wet; in the former the figs would 
drop and in the latter they would become of poor taste. (Fig. 77.)

According to Duhamel there is a Mourenao with oblong fruit and white pulp;

25? THE fig: its history, culture, and curing. 

iVeb/aw—ADRiATic. — There seems now to be no doubt but that the Nebiati and 
Orosse Verte are identical with the Adriatic of the California growers. The 
description given by Dr. Hogg tallies exactly with our Adriatic. Trees 
received from the Royal Horticultural Society in London under the name of 
Nehian and Orosse Verte and grown on the place of John Rock at Niles, Cal., 
resemble exactly our Adriatic figs. Our Adriatic fig, however, is now so well 
known that a change of name can not be desirable. This vaiiety is, among 
other things, characterized by a peculiar, and not always desirable, ** burnt ' 
taste, especially prominent in the dried fig. This taste was also found in the 
Ifebian and Grosse Vertex and the author considers it absolutely beyond any 
question that these three varieties are identical. If a change should be made 
in name, the word Nehian should be preferred. 

Negrau— Figfa Negrau (Nice); Ficus sylvesiris var. rufeacens Gteny. — Second crop: 
Two inches by five-eighths inch; pyriform, reddish brown; meat violet; pulp 
red. Nice and Provence, France. 

Negretta— i^icits nigra Risso; Ficu8 erin, var. sa^xetana Gteny; Rock Fig, — Two 
crops. Second crop medium ; 8 bout 2 inches long by 1^ inch wide; ess shaped, 
rounded, similar to a small Douqueira. Color shining black, with blue bloom; 
skin thick, firm, adhering to the pulp, which is pale yellow and of good quality 
when fully ripe. Many seeds. Thrives well in the rockiest places, where no 
cultivation is possible and where no other tree except the olive would thrive. 
Nice and Provence. Is recommended for places in Arizona and southern Cali- 
fornia where irrigation is impossible. 

Negro d'Espafla—QENOAy Black. 

Negro Zxirgfo— San Pedro, Black. 

Negrone— Aegrronne.— Size medium to below, 2 by If inches, pyriform, tapering 
with a distinct, slender, variable neck. Stalk distinct, long; stalk and part of 
neck bent over and rising in a curve upward, where the fig hangs down. 
Ribs few, distinct, disappearing on apex, which is rounded; eye small, closed; 
scales few, large; small iris. Skin smooth, except for the ribs; color deep 
violet-black; pulp fine, dense, with small seed; meat violet- white, pulp brown- 
ish red to amber with violet flush; inner scales ocher yellow. Tree a strong 
grower. Leaves long, about 9 by 6 inches, very deeply lobed, the middle lobe 
being much the longest: three deep large lobes and two shorter ones near the 
base of the leaf. Under side rough. A very good little fig. It is not identical 
with the Violette de Bordeaux, as suggested by Barron. This latter fig has 
small leaves, otherwise the fruit is very similar.

Nero ObZwngo— San Pedro, Black. 

NiBRAN— De Nibran. 

Nigra.— Small, pyriform: skin dull yellow, shaded purple; flesh bright red, juicy, 
not rich (Barron). This is undoubtedly a variety brought to England under 
a wrong name, as it is difficult to understand how a **dull yellow" flg could 
be called Nigra. It is only another instance of the mixing of names. The 
variety is entirely distinct from A'tgrra— Ghenoa, Black. 

Mgra— Genoa, Black. 

Nigrette.— Very small, oblate, with short neck; stalk one-eighth inch long; eye 
open; skin dark blackish purple over the apex and halfway toward the stalk, 
where it shades off to reddish purple. Pulp rose colored, juicy, and sweet 
Not identical with Negretta. 

Noire d'Espagne.— Extremely early, small, round, and regular, stalk short; eye 
closed; red ribs; skin quite black, with thick blue bloom, cracking when ripe; 
pulp tender, deep rose. A handsome fig of fair quality (Hogg). A different 
fig from Negro d'^spana— Genoa, Black.

Leaves smaU, stiff, 3-lobed, brig:ht green', with fitwdown. JIbis fig belongs to 
the Marseillaise class, characterized by its large seeds, but is smaller than and 
inferior to the true Marseillaise, which it otherwise resembles. 

Pagaudi^re. — Two crops. Bound, reddish yellow, with red streaks. A very 
sweet French fig for table, extensively grown in the valley of the Loire, in 
France, according to F. Gillet, who introduced it to this country. 

Palopal.— Very large fig of white color, grown in the vicinity of Valencia, Spain. 

Panach6e—iSWped.— Medium; round; skin bright, dark green, striped yellow. 
Pulp white. A very handsome striped fig, probably the same as Jasper, with 
the description of which it agrees. Leaves and stems of these figs are dis- 
tinctly striped. 

Panachee— Col, di Siqnora Panach^e. 

Paradise Fig—FARADiso, 

Paradiso — Paradise Fig.— Only first crop said to be valuable. 

Parker^s Smyrna — Adriatic. 

Pasquale— Nat AiANO, 

Pastelli^re— Pos^tdt^re.— Size, about 3 inches long by 1^ inches wide; shape, 
elongated pyriform, with long, gradually tapering neck; cheeks swollen and 

Protruding; stalk short or medium; ribs hardly elevated, and in ripe figs not 
istinct. Eye closed, but rather prominent, with an elevated iris, rough; 
scales few, but comparatively large, dark violet, with rosy margins. Bloom 
can not be rubbed off. Skin rather rough, hairy, covered with a thick, fine, 
pearl-blue bloom, extending to the eye. Color dark violet-blue all over; pulp 
dark red, sweet and good; meat white. A good fig for preserves. Does well 
at Niles, Cal. Tree erect, with stiff limbs. Leaves very large, almost circu- 
lar, coarse and flat, shallow. 3-lobed or entire. If the writer could plant only 
one blue variety it would certainljr be this fig. The fine form of the tree, its 
abundant cropping, and the superior quality of the fruit should make this fig 
a favorite all over the Pacific coast. (Fig. 78.)

with reidish shade. Skin tender, but thick, bright green, covered with a 
thick, whitish fuzz. Fig strongly adherent to the stem. Pulp pale yellow 
to pale rose: Does not suffer from coulure; produces well, and thrives equally 
well on dry and moist soil. Leaves 5-lobed, pointed, and crenate. This is a

exposed to the sun; pulp deep red, rich, and luscious. August to October. 
(Elogg.) This is probably the true Pergussata, received from England under

crop, medium, pulp less pink, more amber, smaller than Adriatic, but sweeter, 
and never becomes sour, at least not at Atwater, Cal. A delicious fig, which 
the author has not been able to identify with any of the foreign kinds, though 
it undoubtedly comes verjr near to Verdone. Fully ripe fruit sent from San 
Joaquin Valley, California, June 26. It is probable that this, as well as 
**Atwater," belongs to the importations of fig varieties by the late G. N. Milco. 
The Peters White ripens about one week later than Atwater. Named for 
J. D. Peters, in whose orchard the trees were found.

THE fig: its history, culture, and curing. 



Pheasant Bye — (Eil de Perdrix. — Medium, variable turbinate or pjrriform, 2^ 
inches long by If wide. Short but set neck; short or no stalk; lopsided. 
Eye small, closed; skin faintly ribbed, rather waxy; color deep brown, green- 
ish on neck; pulp dull coppery amber, with a tint of salmon. A well-tilled 
fig. Leaves below medium, coarse, 3 or 5 lobed, about 7 A by 7i inches. This 
fig was received from the Royal Horticultural Society of London. It neither 
agrees fully with the description given by Dr. Hogg, nor does it correspond 
with the description given by French nurserymen. 

Pichotte-Bamissotto — Sareione. 

Pied de Boeuf.— Size medium to large, 2^ by 1^ inches to If inches; shape oblong 
pyriform, with long, narrow, curved neck; stalk medium to long; slan rough, 
warty, with warty ribs, distinct both at apex and on neck; eye closed, small, 
surrounded by a rough, warty, elevated iris, of the same color as the skin, but 
surrounded by a lighter zone; scales 
large, violet; skin violet, chocolate 
brown, in some greenish olive iu 
shade, with more yellow between the 
ribs. Thin blue bloom near the stalk. 
Color is diffused, apex and neck are 
not lighter colored; pulp amber yel- 
low, slightly rosy; meat greenish yel- 
low. A^ftrv^nodfig. remarkable on 
account of the color of its pulp, which 
is amber, while the skin is dark. The 
pulp, however, is quite coarse, though 
3nicy. Tree au irrrnuailtf iiiypflfiinff 
grower ; leaves 3-lobed. Fruit ripens 
late." ■ 

Pignette.— A small Italian fig. 

Pingo de Mel.— First crop: Above me- 
dium; largest figs are 2^ inches wide 
by 3 inches long, pvriform, with a 
short and very thin but still distinct 
neck. The neck Is narrow ; about one- 
fourth inch wide and even throughout; 
about three-fourths inch long. G reat- 
est transverse diameter is below the 
center of the fig; stem short; skin 
smooth, waxy, pale grden. Ribs in- 
distinct, consisting of numerous lines; 
eye small, with large scales of amber 
color, margined white. Male zone 
distinct, but small; pulp whitish am- 
ber; male flowers around the throat 
and also scattered in the cavity of 
the receptacle, but few in number. 
Growth of tree sturdy , dense. Leaves 
medium to large, 5-lobed, rounded. 
Lobes rounded, deeply cut; but, as 
the lobes are wide and overlap each 
other, the sinuses between them are 
not very distinct. Stem of leaves as 
long as the leaves. This is a very 
good and juicy fig and one of the best 

green brebas. This fig variety belongs either to the class of the Cordelia fig, 
having male flowers with pollen, or to the class of edible caprifigs. It possesses 
numerous gall flowers in the cavity of the receptacle, but at this writing I 
have not yet found out if these galls are capable of sustaining waaps. At 
Niles this fig has never matured a second crop. As soon as it sets this year it 
will be caprificated, and it can then be determined with certainty to which class 
this fig belongs. At present I am inclined to consider it as an edible caprifig.

ribs very low or indistinct; eye small, scales open, bright red. Skin smooth, 
thin, waxy, greenish yellow in the shade, with a brownish-amber flush quite 
similar to that of White Bourgasotte. Meat white; pulp very lively rosy red, 
of the finest quality. Leaves large, 5-lobed, longer than broad, points sharp, 
and cuts are medium deep. The end lobe considerably longer than the other. 
Growth vigorous; branches quite slender and not much branched. Most 
leaves are 5-lobed, but some also 3-lobed; the leaf stalk is rather long. Very 
few, if any, brebas; second crop fair. A very fine drying fig, the best Italian 
fig for table, according to Gallesio, and the best next after Dottato for drying. 




Fig. 82.— Pissalutto Bianco fig (second crop). 

Common in Lignria and around Genoa, and especially fine at Sarzanese; also 
in Corsicaand Sardinia. At Grasse, in Provence, known as Pitahiffe, Its period 
of maturity is short. It ripens after Albicello and Bineletto, and is succeeded 
by Dottato, Rubado, and Bourgasotte. One of the best of all figs. It is sup- 
posed to be identical with the Liviana of Pliny, which identification must be 
considered highly doubtful. ( Fig. 82. ) 
Pissalutto Negro—Black Pissalutto; Ficus saffrenia Risso; Pissalutta Negra.— 
Size medium; less oblong than Pissalutto Bianco; skin shiny, violet ribbed; 
pulp fine and sweet. A fine black fig grown around Genoa (according to

directions, 'allowing piSlity of air and sun among the branches. Leaves 
medium to small, oblong, with 8-pointed lobes and sjometimes with 2 addi- 
tional small basal lobes. This fig was brought from Portugal by emigrants 
to Niles, Cal. , where it is now growing. The true name of the variety is

very lofl^lStaiks, wliicff are o1fFeTi"'consrdefably larger than the leaf. Belongs 
to the Marseillaise group, but is much inferior. Dr. Hogg is in error in class- 
ing this fig as a synonym of the Marseillaise. It is much coarser, with heav- 
ier ribs and with a white pulp, and the tree is less densely covered with leaves. 
In the interior of California Raby Castle is an inferior fig. In the vicinity of 
San Francisco Bay it is sweeter, but still always very coarse, and the author 
thinks it is not worthy of cultivation in this country, where so many better 
figs are grown. (Fig. 83.) 

Baby Castle. — Below medium, turbinate, about 1| inches wide by 1| inches long. 
No neck and short stalk. Flattened at apex. Many shallow ribs. Tree mod-

greatly the Pacific White and may be identical with that fig. Name doubtful.

cana); Fico violacea Bisso; Fieus erin. var. uberrima Qeny; Negro Largo; 
Noire de Languedoc: Grosse Rouge de Bordeaux; Orosse Violette de Bordeaux; 
Nero Oblungo, — Dr. Hogg, in his catalogue, confounds this fig with Violette 
DE Bordeaux and Petite Aubique, Bordeaux, which are different figs of 
smaller size and of pale-grayish color, for description of which see ''Bor- 
deaux." On the other hand, the author is satisfied that Dr. Hogg's Negro 
Largo and Noire de Languedoc are identical with the Black San Pedro, 
although this is not quite clear from his description of the variety. 

Two crops. First crop very large, from 3^ by 2 inches or 4 by 2 inches. 
Shape elongated, ovate ; no ribs; with prominent and well-set neck. No, or very 
short, stalk, flattened laterally and rather lopsided, one side of apex hanging 
down more than the other. Eye open, reddish; skin smooth, violet black, 
with a rosy flush in the shade and green on the neck; fine blue bloom; pulp 
coppery red, tinted with violet; very sweet, but with a light disagreeable 
smell and bitterness. Second crop smaller, oblong, 2^ by H inches; ribs manv 
and prominent; color deep sea green, with violet-black ribs; eye medium, with 
many spreading yellow scales; pulp reddish violet, rather coarse; meat thick, 
greenish white. Tree very strong grower, requires mcist and rich soil . Leaves 
large, 3-lobed, forming a very dense foliage. The first crop is a table fig of 
unsurpassed size and fair quality. The second crop dries well, but is small in 
quantity and inferior in quality compared to the first crop. 

The Black San Pedro is one of the most excellent of the black figs. It is culti- 
vated extensively in northern Italy, Provence, and Spain. It tiirives also in 
the vicinity of Paris. The author has seen figs of large size and fair qualitv 
near Santa Ana, Cal. In size it is probably unsurpassed by any other black 
fig known. Though the fig is callea San Pedro, Black, it must not be under- 
stood that it is a variety of the San Pedro, White, or vice versa. The two figs 
do not resemble each other in the least, and are, in fact, not related, and the 
only thing they have in common is the name. Under the name of Qrosse Vio- 
lette de Bordeaux the author received from Rev. Dr. Wilks a fig distinct from 
either Bordeaux or San Pedro, Black. It resembles somewhat Negrone, but 
has smaller leaves. (See Violette de Bordeaux.) (Fig. 89.) 

San Pedro, White — Fico di San Piero; Fico di San Pietro; Apple Fig; Breba 
(erroneously); Saint Peter; White Saint Peter; Fico di Saint Piere; San 
Pedro.— Two crops, the first only maturing without caprification. Large, 
rounded; 3 to 4 inches diameter, somewhat flattened at apex; stalk and neck 
very short; eye large, open, but not protruding. Skin ribli^d. not waxy, thick, 
but tender, of a bright yellow color in sun, shading to greener in shade, with 
no bloom, but showing off like a lemon on the tree. Color of scales yellow, 
with violet iris; pulp light amber, opaline, with here and there a trace of red; 
rather coarse but sweet, and somewhat deficient in fiavor. A remarkably 
handsome fig, but difficult to ship any distance. Large growing tree, with 
upright branches; leaves waxy and not deeply lobed, with obtuse ];>oints. 
Requires deep, rich, moist, but not wet, river-bottom soil. Only the first crop 
comes to maturity without caprification. Is not related to Black San Pedro. 
Second crop: Fig as large or larger than the first crop; about 2f inches wide 
by 2 inches long, being decidedly flattened, like an onion. The eye is large 
and wide open, with amber scales of small size, of a spreading nature. No 
stalk and no neck. Many ribs from eye to stalk distinct all around. Color of 
skin deep sea green, without any flush of yellow in the sun. Flesh, deep and 
bright strawberry red, without any violet tint. Meat, yellowish white. Seed, 
many, but very small. Pulp, fine, juicy, and highly flavored and distinctly 
acid. A most exquisite fig and much superior to the first crop, which often 
is insipid. This crop was produced at Niles on a properly caprificated San 
Pedro fig tree standing next to a capri Milco. It bears a full second crop, 
while all other San Pedros, which had not been caprificated, dropped^ all their 
second crop, just as they had done for ten or more years past. It is'interest- 
ing to note that the second crop differs from the first crop in shape and qual- 
ity. Caprificated, I consider San Pedro, White as one of the most delicious figs 
I have seen. It may possibly prove to be a valuable fig not only for the mar- 
ket but also for drying. 

San Pedro, White, is rather extensively distributed in Califomia, especially in 
San Joaquin Valley. When well grown it is a very good fig, which, when near 
a market, sells well. It was introduced to California at various times, once 
under the name of Breba, from Spain. 

Bang de Li6vre—-Ra66iYBZood.— Large, rounded; skin bright brown; pulp blood 
red. Good bearer and fair quality for table.

Clara Valley, California, and around Nevada City, Cal., but is inferior in the 
San Joaquin Valley, California. Extensively distributed in the south of 
France, where it loves dry and mountainous regions. This variety is very

the Adriatic, which, however, is by no means certain. As far as I know there 
are no trees of Mr. West's importation now alive in California. 

Verdone ( Rome ) —Adriatic. 

Vemissenque — Bemissenqiie, — Large, turbinate, regular; neck long; stalk short; 
longitudinal ribs, most distinct on the neck; eye open; skin perfectly deep 
black, without trace of lighter color, with a fine bloom like that of a dark 
plum. Pulp dark blood red, sweet, but flat. A very showy, second-rate fig 
with small seeds, flavored and of good quality. Leaves, 5-lobed,much serrated 
and crumpled, longer than broad. Only second crop; matures late in Septem- 
ber. This fig is not identical with either Verdone of Verona and Rome, Verdini 
of Milan, Verdolino of Piacentio, but resembles greatly Zigerino Verde (Enga- 
nei) (G) . Cultivated in Lombardy in the district of the Po. Nor is it identical 
with any of the Verdals, but seems to be a distinct and well-characterized 
fig, superior in flavor to the small round Verdal, which it somewhat resembles. 
The Verdal is a handsomer but not as fine a fig. 

Versailles— ^6owdance; Royal; Royal de Versailles.— Two crops; first crop 
medium, about 2^ inches wide by 2f long. Longer than broad, bell-shaped, 
flattened at apex, with a distinct neck; stalk medium; ribs few, well marked; 
color pale greenish white; pulp rose. Second crop: small with longer stalk; 
leaves 5-lobed, undulating with obtuse lobes. Similar to Blanche Commune, 
but is loDger and with a more contracted neck. A coarse and poor fig when 
grown in English hothouses or when in an unsuitable climate. Highly rec- 
ommended by French growers as one of the best figs for the table, at least in 
certain districts. Mr. Felix Gillet. of Nevada City, Cal., who has grown this 
fig extensively, writes that the skin peels off like that of an orange and that 
it is a very sweet fig, which stands shipment well, the first crop ripening with 
him about July 1, and the second crop in September. (Fig. 98. )

with a violet flush in the sun. Eye, reddish; pulp, blood- red, of good or fine 
quality. Leaves 5-lobed, crenate, with pointed lobes. Savoy and Provence, 
around Grasse and Toulon. There is another fig with this name. ( See Cuers. ) 
The name of the fig is derived from the fact that the fig appears unripe while 
in reality it is perfectly ripe.

This fig is different from the true Brown Turkey and quite distinct from 
the Brunswick, which it also resembles. In fact it resembles more the Bruns- 
wick than the former. The true name of this fi^ is not known. Intro- 
duced or at least distributed by Colonel Warren in the early days of fruit

slightly flattened at apex; no neck; stalk short to medium; ribs numerous, 
not greatly elevated, but still quite distinct from stalk to near the eye. Eye 
open, large, scales not protrudinj^, but flat and level with the apex. Skin 
greenish yellow, evenly diffused, semitransyarent, slightly downy; pulp and 
meat amber white around the eye; seeds very large. A very good fig— in the 
author's opinion identical with the White Marseillaise, which it resembles in 
every respect. Distributed by Mr. Williamson, of Sacramento. The above 
name is proposed until the true name be found, although the author Is 
almost positive that it is fdenlical with the Marseillaise White.

-^ '^^'f W'-^^-'^/ ^ • V^^ J SMYRNA FIGS. 

AA^' Linder the name of Smyrna figs we should include only such varieties as actu- 
ally glow in Smyrna and which require caprification in order to set fruit The 
practice to indiscriminately name varieties Smyrna figs should now be discarded, 
and the buyer of fig trees should insist upon having the pedigree of the trees sold. 
J^tt^re are now fruiting in California some ten different varieties of these figs, some 
having proved to belong to the best types of Smyrna fig, grown in Smyrna for com- 
mercial purposes and distributed from that place all over the world. Most of the 
^ ^ following varieties have fruited in California. The descriptions are based, for the 

' r\V// *^S ^^* part, on observations during the season of 1901, after the preceding pages 
{ X '>^^^ *^were in type and are inserted here because of the commercial importance of these 
.^^^^""^ varieties: 

\ Bardakjik— TV^/it^e Bardakjik; White Baltadjik; Bartadjic. — F ruit large 

[j^ I — to very large, ovate, pyriform, with long neck and stalk. Skin very tmn, 

^ greeniSn gray. Ribs dist inct; light gray , covered with small gray dots. Eyes 

,, 4 y . t^ yj ' deep red. Pulp rich, de^Ji iifllll90ll. Tree a compact grower, spreading. 

I /^^ 'i Leaves Jarpfe* 5 -lobed. A farst-class table fig, also used for drying. The form 

' ^f fflfl Bf resembles an Egyptian pitcher for holding water— bardak meaning 

pitcher— hence the name. 

Bardakjik, Black— Bar ^afc/ifc; Black Bardakjik, — Large, oblong, pyriform. 
black. A very fine table fig from Smyrna, Asia Minor, wnere with the white 
Bardakjik it is considered one of the very finest table figs. It will also dry 
well. 

Blowers — Blowers's Smyrna, — F ruit medium , about If inches long by If 
inches wide. Ribs heavy. Neck crboKea, witn short stalk. Skin yellowish 
green, with graj; bloom. Ribs darker than the other parts of the skin, which 
is spotted over with gray dots. Eye ojjen, dark green. Flesh blood red, tender, 
and sugary, with a rich sirup. Seeds* small, yellow. Tree mfigm2(^2£J2Ppg^bt 
growth, with heavy branches. Leaf 9 inches wide by 10 inches long, i^-iobed, 
and a few 5-lobed. Both surfaces greeii,' upper surf acefCtigh and glossy; veins 
yellowish green^ Stalk of leaf about 3^ inches long. Edgesof leaves indentated. 
This very distinct variety was one of the Bulletin importation, and first planted 
on the place of R. B. Blowers, from which the tree at Niles is an offspring. The 
Turkish name is not known. Description partly from notes of Mr. J. C. Jones. 
Kassaba — Cassdba, — Fruit me dium to lar^ e. almost globular, somewhat 
flattened at apex. Neck short; starK snort. Eye large, open. Sk in pale green. 
Pulp reddish pink. Seeds small. Ver y sweet. Tree an upright grower. ( Koed-

Leker Ingir.— Fruit roundish, oblate, with short neck. Pulp reddish pink, 
^eeds small. Skin greenish ocher, very thin, wit h dark specks. Ribs distinct; 
ligirr greenish. Tree a .very strong gr ower, witli heavy and closely jointed 
branches. Growth upngnt. Leaves very large, deeply cut, and slightly 
indentated. Description after Schwarz. Imported by Roeding. 

Lob Ingir — Bulletin Smyrna; Commercial Smyrna (California); Erbeghli; 
Erhelli; Erheili,—Frmt la,rge to ver^laEgfi, about 2f inches wide by 2i inches 
long; decidedly flattened lite an onion, being compressed in the diameter of 
stem to eye. Neck thin , distinct but short, generally straight. No stalk or one 
very short. Ribs heavy, uneven, knotted and branching. Eye large, with 
numerous scales of arciber tint, open and about three-sixteenths inch wide, so 
that the pulp can be seen through the opening. Skin the col or of beeswax, 
smooth and waxy, shaded greenish. Pulp pale to dark amber; WllUU Ulifl[iy, 
shaded red. No distinct iris. Seerls large, flattened. Tree a strong, spread- 
ing, but rather straggling grower, with heavy branches, easily broken off 
through splitting. Leaves large, about 8 inches broad by 8i^ inches long, 
with 5 thin, deep lobes, Wth derTtiferous edges. Leafstalks heavy, about 8i 
inches long. Color of leaves dark green on upper side, light green on under 
side. This fig is the best type of Smyrna fig, and the majority of figs imported 
from Smyrna to this country belong to this variety. This tree should be 
encouraged to branch close to the ground. It is now widely disseminated in 
California, and trees 20 years old are growing in many places, showing that

only with caprification. The variety is named for the honorable Secretary of 
Agriculture, James Wilson, under whose administration as Secretary of 
Agriculture the Blastophaga wasps have been successfully introduced to 
California, and the culture of Smyrna figs been made a perfect and unqualified 
success. 

CAPRIFIGS. 

Most of the following caprifig varieties, twenty in number, are now growing in 
California in the experimental nursery at Niles. As far as is known, no caprifigs 
have previously been described, and it is to start an investigation of these varie- 
ties that the following descriptions are offered. The imperfections in some of the 
descriptions are due to the fact that some of the varieties have not yet come into 
i till bearing in this country. The value of caprifigs is fully eq ual to ^h afc of the 
Smjrma varieties. The caprifigs, when first received, were simply labelea ^o. 1, 
2, 3, etc., and much confusion has been the result. In order to help straighten 
out this difficulty I have here proposed new names for such varieties as were not 
properly named before.

neck. Color greenish-yellow. Numerous male flowers and pollen. MamniQn i 
verv rare. Js o mamme have ever set. Leaves large, rather entire. Tree a 
sturdy grower. lUlH Vai'lBI^ was t^^© original caprifig imported to California 
by the Bulletin Company. The ori^al tree is now dead, but younger trees 
have been started from cuttings. Dijffers from other caprifigs imx)oi:^ted from 
Smyrna. 

H.ow8LTd—8olm8-Lavbach No, «?.— I nsectiferous pro fichi. about 2^ inches 
long by li wide, with distinctly set afRT^fUHHSBned neck, the nSfW^Fpart 
being tbree-fourths inch long. Fig ovoid-turbinate, with indistinct ribs. Eye

zone smooth. Color of skin b rowniab i-YJftl*^^ ^snth ^aon nm the neck. Meat 
with thin rim of violet. Male flowers confined to eye zone. Gall flowers are 
not closely set. Abundant pollen. Profichi all fallen in the beginning of 
August. PoUeniferous flowers much smaller, about U inches long by three- 
fourths inch wide. Meat without any violet. Mammoni numerous August 
24, some being about 1 inch in diameter, though the majority are smaller, as 
large as peas. All are situated in the top of the tree. Tre^jjj^jf/a^ and 
robus t gr pw t^. Leaves 3-lobed, abo ut G inche s lonflMa^^ncfies wiae. This 
vaiuaDiecapnfig was received from P IVf il4!i(ii flWBHBTaurlBHrTraples. Named 
for Dr. L. O. Howard, Chief of the Entomological Division of the United 
States Department of Agriculture, who has done much to unravel the difficult 
question of caprification. 

Larg^e Wild.— Under this name Barron refers to a wild caprifig somewhat 
larger m size than Small Wild. 

Maslin. — Lea ves very layge . entire, strongly hairy, on both upper and under 

i- sides; the under side being very rough, the upper side smooth. Profichi with 
many male flowers. Mammoni with few male flowers, but with many gall 
flowers. Many mamme setting about October 15, at San Francisco. EigSLlUtt* 
turbinate, with long stalk and distinct neck. Scales of eye, pink or red; Strong 
grower. A seedling accidentally raised in a garden in San Francisco. A very 
remarkable and undoubtedly valuable variety. One of the most promising, 
not only on account of its growth, but from the fact that being raised in 
California it is likely to be adapted to the climate of that State. Named for 
Mr. E. W. Maslin, of San Francisco, one of the first horticulturists in Cali- 
fornia to interest himself in Smyrna fig culture.

The tree^TB U BLfUlig' "Igrower, and the branches have a tendency to gfrow 
upright. Mr. John C. Jones, who has given me this description taken Irom 
tile tree at Niles, Cal., considers this variety one of the best. The fig is not 
edible. This variety was sent to Mr. Rock and myself by Dr. Paul Meyer, of 
the Zoological Station at Naples, as a most valuable variety. 

Milco—^ndrtcfe.—Insectiferous profichi, large, about 2 by 2 inches or lees, 
globular or slightly lopsided. Skin puregreen , smooth, and waxy, without any 
prominent ribs. Eye small , with pink-colored sc^Je^, and without any conspic- 
uous iris. Figs are firm and rather liartf^v^n when ready for caprification. 
Male flowers confined to zone arounc! the throat. Gall flowers are larger than 
on any other variety known so far, and very numerous, filling the whole of the 
cavity of the receptacle, the latter being shallow and not pointed at the bot- 
tom. Meat green with f^.l^ro^d violet zone. Not a trace of violet on the skin.

length of time. The mammoni are more rounded and somewhat smaller than 
the profichi, beginning to set long before the wasps from the profichi have 
ceased to hatch. Tree a very stpiifiL^g ro wer a pd to^. Leaves large t o 
medium, 5-lobed. Of all the capriTigs tried VLt Bllies Inis is the flBMffWmiSTSg 
variety, being of remarkable growth and fertility, there being no cessation of 
crops the year around. This fig has also been pent out as End rich. Originally 
imported by Q. N. Milco from Dalmatia. It is the best variety that I have 
seen for holding and breeding the wasps. 

Mitchell.— Leaves small to medium, the smaller leaves generally being 5 and 
3 lobed, while the larger leaves are almost entire: surface rough and deep gray- 
green. The leafstalks are bright red, and in this respect differ from any other 
caprifig known to us in California. The profichi are turbinate, with long and 
distinct neck and stalk. As far as can be seen from uncaprificated trees the 
figs are j gus[h._l oDsided. and when matured will prob ably be red^ The pro- 
ffchi iiave more male flowers than any other variety seen ByW^. Tte profichi 
and mamm oni crops overlap each oth er. This very interesting and probably 
very valuable variety was origmaied in a garden in San Francisco, probably 
from seed. The fig is named after Mr. George O. Mitchell, who has kindly 
donated the trees for further propagation. 
J Pingo de, IHel—Italiaji jSo. .y.— In sectiferous profichi are very large to 
ty JL medium. Form turbinate, with a verJT feh6rl, distinct', and thin neck, ttkin 
^* smooth and waxy, pale green, with indistinct ribs. Eye small, scales large, 
amber. Male zone distinct but small. Pulp and flesh white amber. Tree is 
sturdy and dense, of very good habit. Leaves medi um to large. 5 -lobed, 
rounded, with rounded lobes, deeply cut. The*TobeB tire wiae and overlap 
each other, so that the sinuses do not show well. Stems of leaves very long. 
The profichi are remarkable on account of their juicy pulp, which makes them 
desirable as a fine table fig. This fig was received through the Department of 
Agriculture from the Royal Horticultural Society of London under the name 
of Pingo di Mel. As this variety is a fine edible fig, no doubt the name is cor- 
rect. As a caprifig its qualities have not yet been proven, the fig not having 
been caprificated in time. 

Rivers — Italian No. ^.— Insectiferpj^gUfillOfifilli medi um , turbinate, with a 
very short neck and several Wstinct ribs. Color greeriisli without violet or 
brown. Growtl ^ dense ^nd_bran ches sturdv. Leaves thick, grayish-green, 
5-lobed. This tree was importeiamany years ago by Mr. John Rock from 
Thomas Rivers & Son, London. The variety promises to be of great value on 
account of its strong growth. It is supposed to be of Italian origin.

Meat yellowish-green with only very little or no violet around the male zone. 
Cavity of the receptable rather shallow and rounded at the bottom. In the 
insectiferous profichi the receptacle is long and pointed in the bottom. Mam- 
moni begin to set at Niles after August 24, none being visible at that date, most 
of the insectiferous profichi having then fallen. Tree of medium an d spread-^

3-lobed. The smaller leaves are serrate, wHile the larger leaves are smooTJir and 
almost entire. A few leaves are 6 inches broad by 5 inches long. Received 
from Professor Solms-Laubach, Naples. It is named for Mr. John Rock, now 
owner of the largest assortnlent of fig varieties collected in one place.

on the side and neck. Eye large, somewbat protruding, with small red scales 
and a distinct dark iris, outside of which is a hard and light-colored zone, indi- 
cating the extent of the male-flower zone. Male-flowers fill not only the zone 
around the eye, but extend far down the sides of the receptacle in streaks. 
Pollen not abundant. Meat is yellow, streaked violet and red. Tree is robust, 
with strong branches. Leaves below medium, 5-lobed as a rule, but some are

of a pea at that date, the largest being 1 inch in diameter. They commenced 
setting about August 1. This fine caprifig was also received from Professor 
Solms-Laubach, Naples, Italy. Now named for E. A. Schwarz, of the United 
States Department of Agriculture, whose investigations on caprification and 
the blastophasa are of the greatest value. 

Small wild.— Un^er this name, Barron mentions a small, white caprifig, 
native of Spain. Another caprifig of larger size he calls Large Wild.

the blastophaga on the Roeding place emerged in the spring of 1899, and from 
which all blastophaga in California have descended. The true name is not 
known by the writer. This tree does well at Niles. It is now named for Dr. 
Walter T. Swingle, of the Department of Agriculture, through whose agency 
the blastophagaB were first successfully established in California.

3-lobed or entire, about 8 by, 9 inches long, very stiB r 'f^hromninedium, 
spreading. This variety was received from tne Lybpartment of Agriculture, 
Washington, several years ago under the name of Trouno. It is presumably 
an Italian variety, having been received by the Department under a wrong 
name. On account of its very early mammoni this caprifig will prove very 
desirable. As it is entirely hopeless to ever expect any identification of the 
Italian caprifigs which even in their native country do not possess special 
names, I have named this variety after Mr. William A. Taylor, Assistant 
Pomologist, United States Department of Agriculture, who has done mach to 
promote the oultivation of the fig in the United States.

The soil B is the only one which with a certainty was taken from a 
fig orchard. It consisted of a fine gray alluvial loam, with a great 
quantity of very fine mica, and with no large or coarse grit or rocks, 
almost as light as dust. This soil is remarkable for its quality of 
preserving moisture — a soil very similar to that found in many of 
the California and Arizona bottom lands along rivers and creeks, as, 
for instance, in Kern County in the Weed Patch, along Kern River, 
along Kings and Sacramento rivers, Gila River, etc. The soil of the 
Meander Valley^does not bake, but remains light even after wetting. 
It is, however, to be noted that the soil in that valley varies somewhat 
as to texture and capability of preserving moisture, and this more than 
its chemical constituents determines the quality of the figs, atmos- 
pheric conditions being equal. The above reference to the Meander

THE fig: its history, culture, and curing. 



Valley soil should not be understood to mean that figs may not do as 
well in other varieties of soil, nor that the Pacific coast localities 
mentioned are preeminently suited for fig culture. 

The following analysis of figs and other fruit was made at the 
agricultural laboratory of the California State Experiment Station at 
Berkeley, under direction of Prof. E. W. Hilgard:

a Analyzed at this station. 

As stated in previous fruit bulletins, these results are too meager to serve as the 
basis for a general discussion of the relative food values of the fruits examined. 
However, we note some wide differences among the nutrients. For instance, the 
sugars and albuminoids, or crude protein, show considerable variation; the apri- 
cots, like the apples, yielding less than one-half as much sugar as the Muscat 
raisin, which, contains nearly twit» as much sugar as the prunes, and one and one- 
fourth times as much of that substance as the fig. European analyses of raisins 
show figures for sugar contents which differ but little from those we give here. 
Both raisins and figs, with respectively 4 and 4.5 per cent albuminoids (flesh- 
forming materials) , stand from one and one-half to two times above the other 
fruits in this respect. The fig yields nearly twice as much ash as the other fruits 
here reported. 

ASH COMPOSITION AND NITBOGBN CONTENTS. 

The fig stands second in amount of mineral matter withdrawn from the soil for 
equal weights of the various fruits. From European data we place grapes first in 
this respect, and from our own findings the orange third, and the prune, apricot, 
and plum fourth. We report an ash analysis of the White Adriatic fig from Kern 
County, and as the figures there represent a considerable district we can take them 
as a fair guide, the analysis of the ashes of other fruits from different localities in 
California having shown that the variations will not be great enough to vitiate 
the conclusions. But few European analyses of fig ashes are at hand, and their 
great discrepancies necessitate an analysis by us of the ash of an imported fig. 
The results obtained are given in the accompanying tables, and it will be noted 
that the figures agree, within the limits to be expected, with those we report for 
our figs.

a Imported ; analyzed at this station. 

With the exception of the grape, it seems that the fig draws rather more heavily 
upon the mineral ingredients that will need to be replaced by fertilization than 
do any of the other fruits we have examined, following closely the amounts taken 
up by the grape and fig of foreign growth. As compared with the fig, apricots 
and prunes, like oranges, do not in any case draw nearly so heavily upon the min- 
eral matters. Lemons and plums, however, very nearly approach it. And among 
the figs we note that the White Adriatic stands somewhat above the other figs in 
this respect. As to nitrogen, it is readily seen that a,mong our fruits the figs, on 
the whole, draw decidedly the highest amount and are quite like those of foreign 
production in this regard. Here again the White Adriatic appears to lead. 

PotosA.— In the ashes of the fig, as in the prune, apricot, orange, and lemon, we 
find potash to be the leading ingredient, amounting to about three-fifths of the 
whole ash. From the partial ash analysis, given above, of the imported Smyrna 
fig, we find the potash to be four-fifths as much as is contained in the ashes of figs 
of California growth. 

TABLE OF SOIL ANALYSES. 

The comparison of the analyses of the Asia Minor soils with those from this 
State shows very strikingly the richness in phosphoric acid of the former over the 
latter. The lowest percentage of this ingredient in the Asia Minor soils, 0.29 
found in soil B, is more than one and one-third times as much as the highest, 0.22 
shown in soil No. 1466, of the California soils, and the average, 0.32 per cent, of 
the three Smyrna soils is almost exactly four times the average for all California 
soils examined (about 200 in number) and nearly three times the figure 0.113, 
denoting the average of phosphoric acid for 466 soils of the humid region (east 
of the Rocky Mountains) of the United States. 

With reference to lime, the average for the Asia Minor soils is 2.60 as against 1.08 
for California. The figures 0.690 for Asia Minor and 0.644 for California, repre-

CHAPTER XVTI. 



STATISTICS OF THE PRODUCTION AND IMPORTATION OF FIOS. 

Compiled by K W. Maslin, San Francisco^ Cah 

The production of dried figs in California can only be approximately 
estimated, as there are no statistics in the possession of the various 
railroads in the State which make a distinction between figs and 
other dried fruits. • Of the many small lots of dried figs which are pro- 
duced everywhere all over the State of California no account is taken. 
Dried figs are used for cooking and pickling in almost every family 
on the Pacific coast, and the total amount thus produced and con- 
sumed must be very large. Thus figs are constantly brought in from 
the country farms to the smaller towns and consumed there. Our 
only detailed statistics are had from the special packers of figs, the 
most prominent of which are found in the San Joaquin Valley in Cali- 
fornia. These packers estimate the output of dried figs shipped out- 
side of the valley at 300 carloads, at 10 tons each. This makes for 
the whole valley of the San Joaquin 3,000 tons, or 6,000,000 pounds. 
If we presume that the total output ')f dried figs from all of California 
is at least 350 carloads, or 7,000,000 pounds, it will be seen that Cali- 
fornia alone produces now at least one-half of the quantity of dried 
figs consumed in the United States. But this estimate is entirely too 
low. The true figures are undoubtedly at least 1,000,000 pounds 
higher. 

The following tables show for ten fiscal years the quantity and value 
of figs imported from Turkey in Asia and from all foreign countries:

PEODIJCTION AND IMPORTATION OF FIGS. 



289 



The per cent of the importation from Turkey of the whole importa- 
tion is as follows: Of quantity, 67.6 per cent, and of value, 70.8 per 
cent. The average value at the port of export from all countries is 
5.4 cents per pound; the average value of figs from Turkey in Asia 
is 5.7 cents per pound. Add to this cost the present tariff of 2 cents 
per pound and the freight to the United States, and the result is a 
substantial basis upon which to estimate the profitable production of 
figs in the sections of this country adapted to their culture. 

It must be remembered that the value on invoice values at this port 
of export average 5.7 cents, but the sales in New York at auction 
show that figs bring at auction all the way from 9 cents to 28 and 30 
cents per pound. 

The small quantity of figs imported in 1899, as shown by the follow- 
ing table, is probably due to their shipment to England and thence 
to the United States :

The imports of figs from the TJnited Kingdom for the fiscal year 
ending June 30, 1899, were 4,123,238 pounds; value, $118,411. The 
imports for 1898 were 2,242,231 pounds; value, $86,684. For 1897, 
1,182,246 pounds; value, $75,451. 

It will be seen, however, that the amount of figs imported show a 
varying decrease since 1896, probably due to the progress of fig cul- 
ture in California, from which State were exported to the East by rail 
in 1899 over 500 carloads. 



CHAPTER XVIII. 
HOUSEHOLD RECIPES. 

Few fruits have been so neglected in this country as the fig, and, 
except in some of the Southern States and in southern California, the 
practical value of figs is almost unknown. What dried figs are 
sold at the fruit stands and in the grocery stores go principally to the 
tables of the wealthj'^ merely as a luxury. In the Mediterranean coun- 
tries the use of the fig is a verj'^ different one. There the fig is a staple 
article of food for the common people, and hundreds of thousands of 
tons are yearly consumed, as we do- wheat and corn. The failure of 
the fig crop would be a serious matter, indeed, as a large part of the 
population depends upon the fig as a winter food. Without expect- 
ing or desiring any similar conditions to find place in this country, 
the author believes that, if the true value of the fig and the many 
uses to which it could be put were known, fig culture would be greatly 
extended, and a very large trade would spring up, beneficial to the 
grower, the carrier, the consumer, and the whole country. 

The fig is one of the most nourishing of all fruits, and if properly 
prepared would be considered a most delicious one. Canned figs, 
stewed figs, fig sauce, etc., are in many places, even in this country, 
eaten daily in many families and highly valued. Canned figs espe- 
cially are very fine, and if properly put up by our canneries would 
soon find a market in northern and eastern countries, where the figs 
are as yet almost counted among fabled fruits. For the benefit of 
those who wish to try figs in different ways, the following recipes have 
been collected, and nearly all of these have been tried by the writer: 

Steaming figs, — Thi6 should be done always in closed but not tightened jars. 
Families may best use a common wash boiler, fnrqished with a loose inner per- 
forated bottom of tin or galvanized iron, kept from the bottom by four stout legs 
soldered to the loose bottom. The space below the bottom is nearly filled with 
water. The jars, with fresh figs, are placed above, and finally over the boiler is 
put its regular cover. This is a much better way than boiling the figs in kettles 
of any kind over direct fire, as it prevents burning or mashing of the figs, saves 
handling, preserves the flavor, etc. 

Preserved /gs.— Gather the figs with the stems on just before they are ripe 
enough to be eaten. Scrape off the skin carefully and drop the figs into a kettle 
of clear, boiling water, and leave half an hour. Then take out and allow to cool 
with the stems up. Make a sirup of a pound and a half of sugar and a half pint 
of water to each pound of fruit. Boil the sirup till nearly roping; put in the figs 
carefully and keep them under the water while cooking. If other than the natural 
flavor is desired, put a clove in the blossom end of each flg or cook them with a 
sliced lemon from which the seeds have been removed, adding a little ginger. 
The preserves keep well if made with an equal weight of sugar and figs. 
290 



HOUSEHOLD RECIPES. 291 

Preserved figs wifh "ginger, — Ten pounds of fresh ripe figs, not shriveled, are 
peeled of the thick outside skin. As not all figs are peeled readily, a variety which 
peels must be selected. Take the peel of one orange or lemon, pare well, and use 
none of the inner white part or rag. Take one ginger root and shave very thinly 
with a sharp knife. Boil the peel and ginger until very tender in a separate kettle. 
In another kettle make a sirup of 6 pounds of best white sugar, enough water to 
dissolve; add the juice of four oranges and one lemon or four lemons. When 
ready, add the decoction of the orange peel and ginger, but take care to first strain. 
Bring the sirup to a simmer, drop in the peeled figs and simmer under cover until 
clear and tender, which requires more or less time, according to the variety of figs 
used and their state of ripeness. 

Pick before quite ripe, peel and put in shallow dishes, with sugar, for twelve 
hours, usually overnight; drain oflf juice into preserving kettle, and aft«r coming 
to a boil put in figs for a short time; take up in dishes again and expose to sun 
while sirup is boiling down; then return figs, and when they begin to look clear 
take up and expose to sun again while reducing sirup to desired thickness; then 
return figs to sirup and let simmer gently for an hour, being careful not to have 
too hot a fire and thus burst the figs; use a pound of sugar for each pound of fruit. 

Pick figs fully ripe, but not shriveled. Scald first in hot water, chr.nge water 
several times in order to draw out the milky juice. Pack figs in glass jars in rows 
and handsomely. Make a sirup of one cup sugar to two of water. Pour over 
figs, and steam for twenty minutes, without rubber band. Then place on the 
rubber bands; steam for twenty-five minutes more with the cover lightly pressed 
down. A very superior article is made if the figs are first steamed in a colander 
until tender, then packed in glass and steamed with the sirup. An apricot kernel 
or a bitter almond may be added to each jar, or, better, grated and boiled with 
the sirup before pouring over the figs. No more than one kernel is needed for 
each jar. 

Fig preserves. — Gather the fruit when fully ripe, but not cracked op^i; place in 
a perforated tin bucket or wire basket and dip for one moment into a deep kettle 
of hot and moderately strong lye (some prefer letting them lie an hour in lime- 
water, and afterwards drain) ; make a sirup in proportion of 1 pound of sugar 
to 1 of fruit, and when the figs are well drained put them in the sirup and boil 
them until well cooked; removing, boil the sirup down until there is just enough 
to cover the fruit; put the fruit back in the sirup, let all boil, and seal while hot 
in glass or porcelain jars. 

Canned figs.— To 3 quarts boiling water add 2 heaping tablespoonfuls soaa; 
now dip your figs in the water for one minute and skim them out; then wash 
them thoroughly in two or three waters, or until there is no color left in the water. 
To 10 pounds of figs allow 8 pounds of sugar; add just enough water to dissolve 
the sugar; when boiling hot, drop in the figs, having first selected them with care 
so as to avoid any that are broken or overripe; let them simmer slowly two hours; 
now remove the figs and boil down the sirup until quite thick; replace the figs; 
bring all to a boiling heat, after which they are ready for canning after the usual 
method. A few slices of lemon with its juice will improve its flavor. 

White-fig marmalade. — A delicious marmalade is made from white figs. Take 
perfectly ripe and fresh figs, peel off the thin, soft skin, and to every 2 pounds of 
figs use 1^ pounds of sugar and the grated peel of a large orange or lemon; cut 
up the figs and mash them with the sugar, adding th(B grated yellow rind apd 
juice of the orange or lemon; boil all together until the whole is reduced to a 
thick, clear, smooth mass, stirring frequently from the bottom. When dcme, put 
into jars while hot and cover closely. 

Those who like less sugar can use one-half pound of sugar to a pound of fruit, 
and it will keep perfectly, provided it be boiled very clear and smooth. 



292 THE fig: its history, culture, and curing. 

Fig pudding.^Two ponndB of dried figs, 1 pound of saet, one-half pound of 
flour, one-half pound of bread crumbs, 2 eggs, spices to taste, one-fourth pound 
of candied lemon peel, one-fourth pound of brown sugar, milk. 

Mode: Cut the figs into small pieces, also the lemon peel; grate the bread finely 
and chop the snet very small; mix these well together; add the sugar, apice, and 
flour; the eggs should be well beaten, and sufficient milk to form the whole into a 
stiff paste; butter a mold, press the pudding into it very closely and tie it down 
with a cloth, and boil four hours or rather longer; turn it out of the mold and 
serve with lemon sauce, wine sauce, or cream. Sufficient for seven or eight per- 
sons. Suitable for a winter pudding, as it should be made with the dried white fig. 

Beat one-half pound of sugar and one fourth pound of butter to a foam. Add yolk 
of 3 eggs, one-half pound of finely chopped figs, one-half pound of grated bread 
crumbs, one-half cup of milk, pinch of salt, white of 3 eggs beaten stiff. Boil all 
for three hours. Serve with white wine or hard sauce. 

Chop one half pound of figs very fine. Mix with 3 tablespoonfuls of butter and 
add one-third cup of powdered sugar, 2 eggs beaten lightly without separating 
yolks from the whites, 1 cup of milk, one-fourth cup of cake crumbs. Mix well 
and turn into a well- pressed mold and boil for three hours. 

Stuffed figs.— XJse •' bag figs ' which have not been pressed. Cut a small slit in 
the stem end of each fig and work in 2 or more blanched almonds. 

Another mixture which is very palatable is a paste made from almonds, walnuts, 
and hickory nuts, to which are added a few drops of sherry. A portion of the soft 
meat of the figs is first taken out, using a knife or a small pointed spoon. The fig 
is now filled with the paste. When filled, press the opening and roll in granulated 
sugar. 

Fig tart^Select a dozen choice dried figs and stew them in enough water to cover 
them. Add 2 cloves, a small piece of stick cinnamon, and a piece of preserved gin- 
ger, chopped fine. When tender, take out the figs and remove the spices. Add 
enough sugar to the water to make a good sirup and a couple of spoonfuls of ginger 
sirup. Then boil for five minutes, and add a little hot water if it gets too thick. 
Next add a teaspoonful of lemon juice and a spoonful of brandy. Return the figs 
to the sirup and set aside to cool. Put 1 or 2 figs and a spoonful of the sirup in 
each tart shell before serving. 

Whip one- half cup of rich cream until stiff, and sweeten slightly. Add one-half 
cup of dried figs, cut fine, preferably into minute dices, by aid of a sharp knife. 
Stir these very lightly into the cream and sugar a few at a time. Fill puff-paste 
shells with the mixture and sprinkle with maple sirup or dust with cinnamon, 
according to taste. 

Fig marmalade, — Use only fully ripe figs. When they are considerably wilted 
they are cut. Cut in halves and scrape out the inside pulp ; mash and strain through 
a very coarse sieve. Put into a glazed dish and place the latter in boiling water. 
Boil constantly for one-half hour and then preserve in sealed glass jars, like canned 
fruit. This marmalade is very fine; can be eaten with meat or alone with cream. 
It is a fine relish if made from good, sweet figs. 

Fig jam, — Boil sweet dried figs with some sirup till all the juice is thick and 
sirupy, then run figs, sirup and all, through some kind of a mill that will grind it 
into a paste. A small sausage grinder is best— one that grinds fine. This paste 
is fine for use wherever a jam can be used, and can be made more easily than any 
jam or jelly. 

Fig paste,— {\) Pick the figs fully ripe, split and scrape off the pulp, mash and 
strain and let come to a boil, constantly stirring. To 10 pounds of fig pulp add 
1 pound grated cocoanut and the juice of one lemon. After boiling a half hour 
spread on plates and dry in the sun. When fully dried keep in air-tight place 
if possible. When ready to use soak in warm water overnight and boil in the 
same water. 



HOUSEHOLD BEOIPES. 293 

(2) Figs must be very ripe. Wash in water, steam in colander for a few minutes, 
then mb through a sieve, using best rubber gloves on the hands. The rubber gloves 
must have been previously washed several times in hot water in order to remove 
the taste of the rubber. The mushy pulp is then placed in jars and steamed for 
forty-five minutes or more. If not sweet, add sugar to taste, spread the mush on 
glass or marble to dry in the sun or in heated air. Fig sauce is made in the same 
manner, except that it is preserved in jars while yet mushy instead of drying in 
the sun. 

(3) Pick the figs when well ripened, but not so soft as to be difficult to handle 
Peel them, weigh, and allow three-fourths of a pound of best granulated sugar to 
1 pound of fruit. Mix sugar and fruit thoroughly with your hands, or by mashing 
together with a large potato masher, and let the mixture stand overnight. Pre- 
pare the afternocm before if the weather is very hot, but if it is not they can stand 
from one forenoon to the next. In the morning put them on the back of the stove 
and let the paste heat slowly, stirring occasionally. Then when ready to give it 
your whole attention pull forward and *' cook down " over a rather slow fire, stir- 
ring and mashing almost constantly. There must not be a single lump left in the 
mass. If wished, some of the seeds which rise and accumulate on the sides of the 
preserving kettle may be skimmed out. The amount of '* cooking down " done is 
according to taste. The paste is nicer when cooked down a good deal, but if one 
does this great care must be taken not to bum the paste at the last, when it is quite 
thick. It is so rich that for small families it had perhaps better be put into pint 
or half-pint jars. 

Figs and grapes preserved together. — White figs and Muscat grapes are sometimes 
preserved together, the second crop of figs coming in season to can with the grapes. 

Pick the figs when their skins begin to crack; peel, weigh, and allow one-half 
pound of best granulated sugar to 1 pound of the fruit. Mix the fruit and sugar 
carefully (not breaking the figs), and let stand overnight. In the morning cook 
slowly on the back of your stove, stirring carefully at intervals. In the morning 
also prepare your Muscat grapes by picking them from their stems, washing, 
weighing, and allowing one- fourth pound of sugar to 1 pound of fruit (and as 
many grapes by weight as figs). Cook in another kettle, using only a very little 
water — just enough to keep them from burning. They will cook, after starting 
to boil, in about ten minutes. The figs will need cooking nearly an hour. When 
both fruits are done, mix carefully together, let come to a boil, and can. 

Pickled figs,— Seven pounds of figs picked just before shriveling, 3 pounds of 
white sugar, 1 quart of vinegar, 1 teaspoonf ul of salt, 1 teaspoonful of allspice, 
1 teaspoonful of ginger, 1 tablespoonful of cloves, 2 tablespoonfuls of cassia buds. 
Boil together for four hours, put spices in a thin bag to keep pickles clear, and 
more vinegar if too much evaporates, and add the sugar when nearly ready. 
When the sugar is dissolved, add the figs. Simmer until tender. 

To 10 pounds of figs take 4 pounds brown sugar, 1 quart strong vinegar, 1 large 
cup of whole spices of the following kinds: Cloves, cinnamon, allspice, and cas- 
sia buds. Boil vinegar, sugar, and spices first, and when sugar is well dissolved 
add the figs and boil until tender. The figs should have been picked before being 
shriveled. Put all in jars; pour out the liquid for three mornings, and let come 
. to a boil and return to the figs; then close the jars. 

-Spiced ^8. —Peel ripe white figs, and to 10 pounds of the figs add 5 pounds of 
brown sugar, 1 quart of vinegar, 1 ounce of cinnamon, one-half ounce allspice, 
one-half ounce cloves, the spices to be tied in bags and boiled with the sugar and 
vinegar. When the vinegar and spices have come to a boil add the figs, a few at a 
time, to prevent mashing, and boil until they look clear. When all -are done put 
into jars and pour the vinegar over them hot. 

Sweet pickled figs, — The figs are picked when ripe, but must not be soft. Steam 
first until slightly soft, then place in a liquor made as follows: A sirup is made of 



29i THE fig: its history, culture, and curing. 

a cup of sngar; to every cup of water add a teaspoojifnl of cider vinegar, one stick 
of cinnamon, crashed in small pieces. Boil the liqnor. Insert a clove in the eye 
of each fig and pack in a glass jar. Pour the filtered liquor over the figs. Steam 
the jars first with the cover on loosely for twenty-five minutes. Then place on 
the rubber bands, screw down cover lightly, and steam for twenty minutes more. 

Crystallized figs, — The figs must be picked when fully ripe, but before they are 
shriveled. Take figs of as even a size as possible in order to save assorting after- 
wards. Simmer in a kettle for twenty to thirty minutes, but do not allow to boil. 
When ready the figs will have become clear and semitransparent. Drain off the 
water. Prepare a strong sirup of best white sugar and drop the figs in. Keep 
this in a cool place. In from twenty-four to thirty-six hours the figs will have 
absorbed most of the sugar and the sirup become very weak. Draw off the sirup, 
add more white sugar, and thus make the sirup stronger. Simmer, but do not 
boil. Drop the figs in and test again in twenty-four hours. If the sirup is weak 
renew the process. When the sirup retains its strength, the process is discon- 
tinued. Prepare a very strong sirup of best white sugar; simmer, but do not boil« 
Previous to this the figs are dried In the sun or in drier until they slightly ring 
when dropped on a stone floor. The figs should, however, not be so dry that they 
can not be readily indented when pressed between the fingers. Now immerse 
these dried figs for a few seconds in the strong, hot sirup, then drain off and 
place on wire trays in a hot-air drier or in the hot sun, if on a warm day. The 
sirup dries quickly and leaves the figs glaced. If crystallized figs are wanted, the 
figs are slowly dried in the shade, in which case the sirup crystallizes instead of 
producing a glac6. 

Candied fl^s,— Are made only from young green figs not yet fully ripe. Place 
in glass jars, pour on salt water, and steam until soft. Pour off the salt water 
and pour over a sirup made of one cup of sugar to three of water. After a day 
take out, place On wire screens, and allow to drip for one or two days in a warm 
place. Place again in jars or earthenware; cover with a sirup made of one cup of 
sugar to one and one-half cups of water. After a day take out and allow to drip. 
The third soaking should be in a sirup made of one cup of sugar to one-half cup 
of water. Iii this sirup the figs are allowed to remain as long as possible, or until 
required. Take out, drip, and roll in confectioners' powdered white sugar in a pan 
made lukewarm. When the figs have absorbed all the sugar they can they are 
taken out and packed in large boxes with powdered sugar. The preserved irnit 
is afterwards repacked in small boxes for the market.

TABLES OF TEMPERATURE, PRECIPITATION, AND HUlAlDITT IN 
THE PRINCIPAL FIG REGIONS. 

The following tables have been compiled for this bulletin by the 
Weather Bureau of the United States Department of Agriculture. 
As the temperatures are given in degrees centigrade and Fahrenheit, 
a table is appended showing the relative value and corresponding 
degrees of the three principal thermometers in use. Precipitation is 
expressed in inches or millimeters. In order to reduce inches to mil- 
limeters multiply the given number of inches by 25, or, to be more 
accurate, divide the given number of inches by 4 and then multiply 
by 99. On the contrary, in reducing millimeters to inches divide the 
given number of inches by 25, or, to be more accurate, divide by 99 and 
multiply the quotient by 4. As 4 inches equal about 99 millimeters, the 
difference between the first method and the second is so slight as to 
be of little importance, making a difference of but three-fourths inch 
in 25 inches. The localities in the Old World have been selected as 
being representative places where figs are successfully grown. From 
Portugal no records have been obtainable. The localities in tlie 
United States have been selected, not because they are actually prom- 
inent fig districts, but in order to give a general idea of the conditions 
under which fig culture is practiced in this country. It is safe to 
say that the ideal fig districts in America have not yet been deter- 
mined. Localities which as much as possible resemble the climato- 
logical conditions of the southern Mediterranean countries will prob- 
ably be found to be the most suitable for the fig industry.
