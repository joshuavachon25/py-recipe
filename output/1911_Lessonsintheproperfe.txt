INTRODUCTION 

This book is for housekeepers with varying incomes from the 
very poorest to those having as much as $25 a week. It is in- 
tended to be used under the instruction of the visiting teacher of 
foods and cooking, who adapts the instruction to the needs of 
each home. In all cases the aim is to help the housekeeper to 
use her income to best advantage. 

The bills of fare have not been planned for persons who have 
been improperly fed for a long time. In the case of such persons 
it is important not to cut down on such foods as butter and milk, 
as their proper use helps to build up our bodies and keep them in 
condition to throw off disease. 

When using this book, remember: 

First: That only the most important points in each subject 
are spoken of. For example, when you know how to cook one 
kind of cereal properly, you can use this knowledge to help you in 
cooking any other kinds. When you learn how to economize heat 
in cooking one kind of meat, you will know how to apply this 
knowledge to a variety of meats. 

Second: When you use the first set of bills of fare, remember 
they show you only the very smallest amount you can give the 
family to keep them well. For a variety which is best, you 
will have to spend about seven cents more every day for each 
person. It is not expected that any one will follow the bills of 
fare exactly as they are printed; they are planned merely as 
examples of the kinds of food that are most valuable. 

Third: The recipes are planned for a family of six — two 
adults and four children. 

Fourth : All measurements in this book are level unless it is 
otherwise noted. Do not use heaped or rounded measures, as 
this will give bad results. The housekeeper must, however, make 

5 



some allowance for different grades of flour, as the amount of 
moisture taken up will sometimes vary, and the recipe must be 
accordingly changed. 

THIS BOOK WILL TELL YOU 

1. What food to eat. 

2. How to get the most strength for the least money. 

3. How to cook your food. 

If you wish to spend one dollar for a practical cook book, order 
the Home Science Cook Book, by Mary J. Lincoln and Anna 
Barrows, at any book store. Some of the recipes in this book are 
taken from the Home, Science Cook Book. 

If you wish to know more about these things, send a postal 
card to Washington, and the U. S. Government will send you free 
practical information about common foods, meat, milk, fish, eggs, 
cereals and bread.* 

HOW TO BUY 
Remember that you save money if you buy in quantities. 
When you get your money at the end of the week, buy as much of 
the week's supply of food as you can. Sugar, flour, tea, eggs, 
dried fruits, cocoa, butter, rice, oatmeal, and many other things 
can be bought more cheaply in this way. If you buy three cents' 
worth of tea or five cents' worth of butter you have to pay much 
more than if you bought by the pound. 

Buy by IV eight 

When you buy a definite weight — a quarter pound, a half 
pound, a pound or more — you can test it and know whether you 
are getting your money's worth. Protect yourself in this way, 
and your money will go much further.

Delicatessen Stores 

Do not make a practice of buying food at delicatessen stores 
for you have to pay the keeper of the store for preparing the 
food and you can do this much cheaper yourself. 

Cheap Food 

Cheap food is the food that gives most strength for the least 
money. 

For example : Potatoes are often thought to be a cheap food, 
but ten cents' worth of potatoes will not give nearly so much 
strength as ten cents' worth of cereals or bread. 

Your body is like a fire, always burning out ; the main reason 
for eating is to keep your engine going. Food keeps the fire alive. 

Food that does not keep you well and make you strong is not 
good food. 

Fruits and Vegetables 

These are expensive during a large part of the year, but if 
you watch the market you will often find a healthful fruit or 
green vegetable to add to your meal for a few cents. 

Bread 

If you do not make your own bread, always buy the stale 
loaves, because in most stores fresh loaves cost twice as much 
as stale loaves, and the stale loaves are more wholesome. 

Milk 

Always buy milk from a clean place and keep it in clean 
dishes covered, so as to keep out dust. If necessary, loose milk 
may be used for cooking, but for use uncooked it is safer to buy 
bottled milk. The very lives of the children may depend on the 
purity of the milk, so it is worth while to save money from 
other foods to procure this necessity for the children. 

You would have to eat eight eggs or two pounds of potatoes 
or four pounds of cabbage or three-quarters of a pound of round 
steak to get.as much strength as that given by one quart of milk.

It is easy to see that milk is a good food, for no one could eat 
four pounds of cabbage or two pounds of potatoes without hav- 
ing trouble with his stomach. Milk has all the different kinds 
of building material for your body in just the right amount of 
each. 

HOW TO BUY MEAT 

Remember that some of the cheap cuts of meat will give a 
large amount of strength, and that they may be made tender 
by long, slow cooking. 

Do not send to the market for "fifteen cents' worth of steak," 
but learn the cuts and prices, and select meat so that you will 
get the most good for your money. 

Always ask for a piece of suet, even if it is not to be used at 
the time. Try it out, strain it and put it away in a clean cup 
for gravy or shortening. 

Beef suet costs ten cents a pound, and is one of the best fats 
to use. 

Here is a list of the cuts of beef and mutton in common use, 
with the average New York prices :

Other Cheap Meats 

Beef heart, oxtails, tripe. If you live near a packing house, 
you can get good stew and soup meat for 6 cents a pound. 

WHAT FOOD SHOULD DO 

1. Keep your muscles strong. 

2. Keep you warm. 

3. Keep your blood in good order. 

4. Make you feel strong and like working. 

Some foods make you strong, some warm, some keep your 
blood clean; what you need is a good combination of all these 
kinds. 

Lean meat, milk, eggs, and cereals make muscle. 
Butter, fat meat, sugar and cereals keep you warm. 
Cereals, sugar, milk, butter and any fats make you fat. 
Sugar and cereals make you want to work. 
Vegetables, fruit and water keep your blood clean. 

The most nutritious of these are the muscle makers. 

You will see that most foods do several things for our bodies. 

The average family needs equal quantities of muscle making 
food and fat making food, and three and one-half times that 
amount of the food that makes us feel like working. 

Here are some bills of fare that give you what you need. 

They are planned for a family — four children, two adults; 
average cost one week, $4.50, $6.30 and $9.00. 

EXPLANATION OF FIRST SET OF BILLS OF FARE 

When you plan your meals for a day it is wise first to decide 
how to divide the money. Take care of the children first, and 
set aside money to give them milk, even if you cannot have the 



greatest variety of other foods. Milk is a food in itself, and the 
best one for children. Then decide how much to spend for 
meat. In this book the meat for one day never costs more than 
thirty cents for six persons, and often less. 

These bills of fare are meant to show the kinds of food that 
are good for us, and are planned for busy women who can not 
give time to fancy cooking. 

Notice tliat although more money is spent in the second and 
third sets than in the first set, the simple, inexpensive meats are 
still used. 

No allowance is made for buying in quantities, the prices of 
butter and eggs are those of winter, and a careful housekeeper 
can probably cut at least one dollar from the week's expense if 
she knows how to plan. When making your plans do not cut 
down on milk or the muscle-makers, but try to save on potatoes 
or change from one of the puddings to fresh or stewed fruit. 

The main dish of each breakfast is a cereal (makes you want 
to work) with sugar, with bread or toast, and coffee for the older 
members of the family, and hot cocoa shells for the children. 

Eacli dinner has one substantial dish, either meat or some other 
muscle maker, and a starchy vegetable, such as potatoes or rice. 
Two or three times in the week there is a simple pudding and a 
fresh vegetable. 

The supper is simple, with one main dish and tea, and milk for 
the children. 

If you can spend more money, use it for fresh vegetables and 
simple puddings, rather than for more expensive meats. 

When you make changes in the bills of fare, do not leave out 
the muscle making food. 

The first set of bills of fare is planned for a time when every 
penny must be counted, and while it gives enough strength, it 
does not give enough variety to keep the family well for a long 
time. These cheap bills of fare are given in order to show that 
it is worth while to put thought on the spending of even a few 
pennies, and to help keep the housekeeper from being discouraged. 



Oleomargarine may be used instead of butter and is perfectly 
wholesome food. 

When great economy is necessary another good fat is sweet 
beef dripping nicely seasoned. 

Directiojis 

When trying out fat, add a small onion (whole), a few leaves 
of summer savory and thyme, a teaspoon of salt and a little pep- 
per. This will season a pint of dripping. This can be spread 
on bread. 

The flavor of a little meat can be spread through rice, potatoes, 
or any mixture, and the plan in the first set of bills of fare is to 
do this, so that it will not be necessary to buy large quantities of 
meat, in order to satisfy the appetite. The strength giving part of 
the food for the day has been taken care of in the other foods.

and should be given food that will make muscle and bone and 
flesh. 

The breakfast of a school child should be : A plate of well cook- 
ed cereal, milk and sugar, a soft cooked egg, bread and butter, 
milk or cocoa or cocoa shells. 

The dinner should be: Some meat cooked without grease, a 
baked potato, a fresh vegetable, a simple pudding, bread and 
butter. 

The supper should be : Bread and butter, stewed fruit, milk or 
cocoa. 

School children who are healthy may use all the bills of fare 
in this book.

HOW TO COOK MEAT 

• The object of cooking meat is to make it tender and to keep 
in the juice and preserve the flavor. To keep in the juice and 
preserve the flavor, sear the meat on both sides, that is, press it 
down quickly on a hot pan, and then turn and sear the other side. 
When the meat turns a whitey brown color, a coating has been 
formed which will keep in the juice. After searing the meat, 
cook it slowly on a low fire. This will make it tender. Beef and 
.mutton are the meats that are best for all persons. 

Meats, such as heart, liver, pork and kidney, should never be 
given to young children or persons who are not well. 

Pork should be used only in cold weather, and not frequently, 
even then. 

32 



Fried Food 

If food is browned in the frying pan, be careful to have the 
pan just oiled with no loose grease, and to see that it is sizzling 
hot before the food goes in, otherwise it will be soaked with 
grease, and be very harmful. Do not fry steak. See direction 
for braising, p. 24, and for "pan broiling," p. 25. 

To make soup, you need to draw out the juice. To do this, 
place the meat in cold water, bring to boiling point and cook gently 
until tender. 

Wipe meat with wet cloth ; do not wash in cold water, as this 
will draw out and waste the juice. 

Do not add salt to raw meat as it draws out the juice. 

For stew, plunge meat in cold water, bring quickly to boiling 
point and let simmer, not boil, until tender. 

For pot roast, put meat into boiling water, then let simmer. 

Minced Liver 

Boil one pound liver one half hour, remove stringy portions 
and chop fine. Moisten with water, add butter, salt and pepper. 
Serve hot with toast or potatoes.* 

Beefs Liver 

Cut in one-half inch slices, place in boiling water for ten 
minutes, drain, remove skin, dip in melted pork or bacon fat, 
and broil or fry. 

Meat Pie 

Use stew, or remnants of cold meat covered with brown gravy, 
add a sliced onion, and if liked, two sliced potatoes. Place meat 
with gravy in baking dish, cover top with a baking powder bis- 
cuit crust, and bake in a hot oven. 

Corned Beef Hash 

Use equal parts of chopped meat and boiled potatoes, season, 
put in hot greased frying pan, moisten with milk or water, spread 
evenly and brown. 

Z2, 



Meat Soup or Soup Stock* 

Best kind of beef, shin. 

Proportion — lean meat 2/3 — ^bone and fat 1/3. 

Wipe meat with damp cloth, cut lean meat in one-inch pieces 

to draw out juice. Heat frying pan and brown 1/3 of the lean 
meat. Place fat, bone and remaining lean meat in kettle, cover 
with cold water, one pint to each pound of meat, bone and fat, 
let stand one hour. Add browned meat and cook five or six 
" hours at a low heat. Add vegetables, salt and flavoring during 
last hour of cooking. Cool and skim. Bits of cold meat, left 
over vegetables or cereals may be added to the soup. 

Irish Stew'''* 

Two pounds of lamb (or i lb. of lamb and i lb. of 
beef) cover with boiling water and cook sloivly two hours or 
until tender. After cooking one hour, add one-half cup each of 
carrot and turnip cut in cubes, and one onion cut in slices. Fif- 
teen minutes before serving add four cups parboiled (to parboil, 
cook for 10 minutes), sliced potatoes, thicken with one-quarter 
cup flour rubbed smooth in cold water. Add flour very slowly, 
stirring all the time. Season and serve with dumplings. 
D^iinplings** 

2 cups flour y'2 teaspoon ful salt 

4 tsp. baking powder 2 " butter 

^ cup milk 

Sift dry materials, work in butter with finger tips, add milk 
slowly, toss on floured board, cut out, place on perforated pie

meat is very tender. Watch meat carefully and keep just enough 
water on it to prevent burning. 

Beef Cutlets Braised'^ (2 lbs.)

brown gravy, bake in covered dish until meat is tender. Flank

during the months when they are reasonable in price, they 
should be used as often as possible, especially for children. Eggs 
*HoME Science Cook Book.

do the same thing for us as meat, that is, give us strength. In 
cooking eggs take care not to use extreme heat, as this hardens 
the white and makes it indigestible.

parts soft crumbs, and brown in oven, after sprinkling top with 
crumbs.

VEGETABLES 

During a large part of the year green vegetables are very ex- 
pensive, but they should be used as often as possible, as they are 
very valuable in keeping the blood in good order. Some vege- 
tables also contain mineral matter which is useful in building 
up the bones. Spinach, carrots and onions are among the most 
valuable. Lettuce, peas, string beans are also useful. A simple 
salad of fresh or cold cooked vegetables should be used as often 
as possible. Dress the salad with a dressing like this : 

French Dressing 

y2 teaspoon salt 
% teaspoon pepper 

2 tablespoons vinegar 

4 tablespoons olive oil. 

Stir or beat material until well mixed. 

HOW TO COOK VEGETABLES 

Nearly all vegetables contain a woody substance which must 
be softened before the vegetable is fit for food. They also con- 
tain starch which if put to cook in cold water becomes like paste, 
but of started in boiling water is easily digested. Salt should be 
added at the start to improve the flavor. 

*Miss Farmer. 

42 . 



Dried vegetables should be soaked over night if possible. This 
shortens the time needed for cooking. 

Any cold boiled vegetables may be stewed in milk, according to 
directions for creamed codfish. (See page 39.) 

FRUITS 

Bananas are nourishing, and if ripe will not harm any child 
who is strong and well. 

Baked Bananas 

Bananas can be very quickly baked. This makes them sweet 
and more easily digested. They are safe in this form for many 
children who would be injured by raw bananas. Peel before 
baking. 

Bananas zmith Lemon Juice 

Make a syrup of lemon juice and sugar. Pour over sliced 
bananas, cover with plate and let stand for thirty minutes. This 
is a good dessert. 

Dates 

Dates are nourishing and may be eaten with bread or added to 
cereals. 

Prunes 

Prunes are excellent for children. Wash the prunes and stew 
slowly until they will fall away from the stones. 

Dried Apples 

Dried apples make a good sauce and apple puddings. 

Scalloped apples and huckleberry pudding are prepared like 
apple pudding. 

Fruit Toast 

Any stewed fruit, sweetened and poured over toast, while hot. 

Watch the market and buy fruit fresh or dried, whenever 
you have a few cents to si)are. 

43 



Date Marmalade 

Yz lb. dates. 

Remove stones, steam over hot water, strain through colander. 

CEREALS 

Points to Reiiiciiiber 

( 1 ) Have water boiling 

(2) Add salt 

(3) Sift cereal in slowly 

(4) Cook over fire until thickening begins 

(5) Place kettle in larger kettle containing boiling water, 
and cook several hours, according to kind. It may be 
cooked over night. 

(6) Dififerent kinds of cereals need dilTerent amounts of 
water. A general rule is two and a half times as much 
water as grain, and a teaspoon of salt for every quart of 
water. 

Chopped dates may be added to cooked mush. This 
makes a good dessert.

DESSERTS 

Deserts need not be expensive and the simple ones are valuable. 
as they furnish two of the necessary kinds of food, sugar and 
starch. 

Bread and jelly or bread and molasses make a good dessert 
for children.

This makes a nourishing, inexpensive dessert. Buy a package 
of Junket tablets at the drug store, this will cost ten cents. Fol-

cinnamon, then add another layer of crumbs, then apple, until 
dish is full, pour enough milk through the pudding to moisten 
it, before putting on top layer of crumbs. Place four or five 
dots of butter on top. Cover pudding with a plate, bake until 
apples are tender, then remove plate and brown crumbs. 

DRINKS 

Water is very necessary to the health of the body ; you should 
drink at least four glasses a day. 

Nearly everyone uses either tea or cot^'ee. These will not harm 
grown people, if they are used moderately, but children should 
never have either tea or coffee. 

WHY TEA AND COFFEE HARM CHILDREN 

I. Tea and coffee give a feeling of rest when insufficient food 
has been taken. This is what we call stimulation. What we mean 
is that the nerves have been acted upon so that we feel refreshed 
although we have received no real strength such as comes to us 
from food. When children's nerves are abused in this way, they 
will be irritable and weak, and apt to become ill. 



2. Tea and coffee, if used to excess, weaken the kidneys. 

3. Coffee affects the heart and is dangerous if the heart is 
weak. Badly made tea is a real poison for both children and 
grown people. Follow directions very carefully. 

DRINKS IN PLACE OF TEA AND COFFEE 

Milk — A real food. Makes blood and strength. 

"Cambric Tea" — Equal parts of hot milk and water sweetened 
to taste. 

Cocoa — A food drink. Makes flesh, heat, and strength. 

Cereal Coffee — A drink for variety. Will not aft'ect the nerves. 

Cocoa Shells — The outside of the cocoa bean ground fine, not 
a food, but an excellent drink. 

RULES FOR MAKING HOT DRINKS 

Coffee — I heaping tablespoon of coffee for each cup. Measure 
amount of water needed, add half of this cold to coffee, 
stirring it thoroughly, let other half of water boil, and add 
to coffee as soon as the cold water has come to a boil, boil 
ten minutes, let stand ten minutes, pour one tablespoon of 
cold water down spout to settle coffee. Always scald coffee 
pot after using. 

Tea — Scald teapot, put in it i teaspoon tea for each cup required, 
pour required number of cupfuls of boiling water on tea, 
let stand three minutes and serve. Never boil the tea. 

Cocoa Shells — i cup shells, 3 pints water ; boil slowly two hours, 
strain and serve with milk and sugar. The strength of the 
drink may be changed to suit the taste. 

Cocoa — one cup — i tablespoon cocoa mixed with 5^ tablespoon 
sugar. Stir in enough boiling water to make a paste, add 
^ cup boiling water, cook fifteen minutes, add ^ cup milk 
and serve. 

Cereal Coffee — Follow directions on package if the coffee is to 



be strong. Many find that half the quantity spoken of on 
the package will make a satisfactory drink. 

SUMMER DRINKS AND ICE CREAM 

Syrup for fruit drinks 

To boiling water add an equal quantity of sugar, stir until 
sugar is dissolved, then boil for ten minutes without stirring. 
Cool and put away in bottles. 
Lemonade 

lYi. tablespoons syrup, 2 tablespoons lemon juice, % cup cold 
water. Mix syrup and lemon juice, and add cold water. 
Orangeade may be made in the same way. 
Very refreshing summer desserts may be made from a frozen 
mixture of water, fruit juice and sugar. 
Lemon Water Ice 

4 cups of water 2 cups of sugar 

y\ cup of lemon juice 
Make a syrup by boiling water and sugar twenty minutes, add 
lemon juice, cool, strain. 

To Freeze — Place mixture in a small granite pail, place pail in 
larger pail, with layer of chopped ice under inside pail, then 
pack space between pails with coarse salt and chopped ice, 
three cups of ice for each cup of salt. Turn inner pail con- 
stantly until mixture begins to freeze, then scrape from sides 
of pail, continue freezing, scrape again, and so on until thick. 

Home Made Ice Cream 

A simple boiled custard may be frozen according to directions 
for freezing lemon ice, and is nourishing and inexpensive when 
eggs are cheap. 

2 level tablespoons corn starch i cup sugar 
2 teaspoons vanilla i qt. milk 

2 eggs 

Scald milk, dissolve sugar in hot milk, thicken with corn starch 
which has been rubbed smooth in a little cold milk. Cook over 
boiling water twenty minutes, add beaten eggs, cook three min- 
utes, add vanilla; cool and freeze.
