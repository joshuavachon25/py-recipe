PUBLIC HEALTH AND HOUSING, 



THE INFLUENCE OF THE DWELLING 
UPON HEALTH IN RELATION TO THE 
CHANGING STYLE OF HABITATION. 



INTRODUCTION. 

THIS subject presented some difficulty in 
framing a short title. My object is to 
consider the influence of the dwelling upon 
health in relation to the rapidly changing 
style of habitation, and may briefly be 
described as " public health and housing." 
It is patent to all, especially in the Metro- 
polis, that the growth and pressure of 
population is altering the mode of living, 
and the exclusiveness of the house of former 
days is giving way to a closer association 
of habitations. Amongst the affluent and 
middle classes mansions are now often 
shared by families ; flats, with and without 
commissariat departments, are springing

up on all sides ; boarding-houses and resi- 
dential clubs are increasing in number ; and 
hotel life has become fashionable. Amongst 
the working and poorer classes existing 
houses are being more and more subdivided 
into tenements, flats of a small kind are 
erected in increasing numbers, poor men's 
hotels or cubicle lodging-houses are intro- 
duced, and family lodging-houses or board- 
ing-houses for the poor are coming upon 
the scene. The new conditions to which 
dwelling-houses are now being subjected 
are becoming increasingly important ; more 
especially does this apply to the dwellings 
of the working and poorer classes. 

The overpowering predominance of the 
housing question upon the health and vigour 
of the people is reflected in the fact that in 
London alone, at the census of 1891, of a 
population of four and a quarter millions, 
no less than two and a third millions, 
over one-half of the community, lived in 
small dwellings of from one to four rooms. 
The public health is influenced, not only 
by the overcrowding and misusage of 
houses, but also by the construction and 



AND HOUSING. 3 

arrangement of dwellings, and both are 
equally important. 

It is remarkable that the most serious 
public health problem now confronting us 
at the end of the Victorian reign, the most 
prosperous period of English history, was 
also the most serious public health problem 
met with towards the end of the Elizabethan 
reign 300 years earlier, and the next most 
prosperous period of our history. In each 
period the cause and effect have been the 
same. Increased prosperity acts as a 
stimulus to the growth of towns to such 
a degree that the crowding of population 
into cubic space and of houses upon square 
space becomes a danger to the public health 
and well-being of the community. In the 
Acts of the Privy Council, printed and pub- 
lished a year ago, will be found 1 a series of 
letters addressed in 1590 to the Lord Mayor 
of London, the Master of the Rolls, and 
others, commanding them to enforce the 
Royal proclamation of 1580 and a sub- 
sequent statute against the excess of new 

1 Acts of the Privy Council (printed edition), vol. xix., 
pp. 1 88, 278, 324, 348. See extracts appended hereto.

buildings being erected, the subdividing of 
habitations into several dwellings, and the 
taking in of inmates " whereby groweth 
infections of deadly sickness," and "the 
pestering of many families in one small 
house," and the " City hath been largely 
increased to the decrease of other towns, 
boroughs, and villages within the realm." 
By statute in 1593 it was provided that no 
new buildings, except for the better classes, 
were to be erected within three miles of 
London and Westminster, and no existing 
buildings were to be subdivided, and in 
1602 by proclamation newly-built houses 
were ordered to be demolished. But Stow 
tells us that little was done, and small effect 
followed. In fact, the disease had not been 
diagnosed, and the proper remedies had not 
been applied. 

It is now no longer resented that the 
growth of a city should proceed by the influx 
of population from the country towards the 
centre, and it is now recognised that the 
expansion of commercial and professional 
activity in the city is ever driving the 
resident population away from the centre 



AND HOUSING. 5 

towards the periphery, 1 tending to cause 
closer and closer compression of the people, 
enhancing the value of the land, increasing 
the difficulty of the bulk of the population to 
find room, raising the rental of houses, and 
reducing the provision of accommodation and 
accessories in dwellings, and all that this con- 
notes, to the smallest proportions. This is 
the malady ; the remedies prescribed have 
been numerous, and many interests have to 
be reconciled. I propose to regard the malady 
and the remedies from the point of view of 
health and the bodily vigour necessary to 
carry on the life of our active population. 

We are becoming more and more town- 
bred, and the stamina, energy, and health of 
the population must be maintained. From 
time to time it has been said that the housing 
question is a simple one, and that the remedy 
merely requires that the necessary dwelling 
accommodation should be defined and en- 
forced. Those familiar with the subject 
recognise that this is begging the whole 

1 See Conference on the Housing of the Working 
Classes, 1900, Trans. Sanit. Inst., vol. xxi. Discourse 
by the writer. 



6 PUBLIC HEALTH 

question, as the dwelling accommodation 
necessary is the very thing that all deep 
thinkers and earnest investigators have been 
endeavouring to find, and the more they 
inquire into and work upon the subject the 
more complex they find are the requirements 
and the more numerous the points of view 
from which they have to be regarded 
health, construction, economics, and so many 
other factors governing the question. 

Statute already provides that every person 
in a workshop or factory is entitled to 250 
cubic feet of air space, and 400 cubic feet 
during overtime. Although there is no 
similar statutory definition of overcrowding 
applicable to dwellings, by-laws provide for 
at least 300 cubic feet of space per head in 
common lodging-houses, and 300 or 400 
cubic feet in houses let in lodgings or tene- 
ment houses when registered. These by- 
laws also provide for one w.c. for every 
twelve persons (in London this is statutory 
for all houses), the use of a refuse receptacle, 
of water, and of drainage. Further, there 
are by-laws and regulations as to drainage, 
water-supply, and buildings. 



AND HOUSING. 7 

Without accepting these provisions as 
ideal, it is evident that legislation has pro- 
vided some kind of minimum. It is the 
altered conditions of present-day life that 
require to be reconsidered, and the standards 
correspondingly altered so as to rest upon a 
basis more in consonance with physiological 
requirements rather than the mere packing 
together of human beings. 

Previously to and during the major part 
of the Victorian period each dwelling-house 
was constructed to suit the needs of a 
particular class of family the one- or two- 
storied cottage for the poorer classes, the 
six-, eight-, or ten-roomed house for the 
middle classes, and mansions for the wealthy. 
The increased prosperity and the increased 
flow of population into towns during the 
later Victorian period led to such a con- 
centration of population that, under the 
increased pressure, cottages and smaller 
houses became insanitary areas, are fast 
disappearing, and are being reconstructed 
in flats ; terrace houses are being more and 
more subdivided and sublet in smaller 
dwellings; and the largest houses and 



8 PUBLIC HEALTH AND HOUSING. 

mansions are being altered in construction 
or reconstructed for other usage. 

In the new century London especially will 
continue to respond still more rapidly to 
the pressure, and will undoubtedly become 
largely a city of houses in flats or floors of 
separate dwellings. It is well for public 
health to recognise this betimes, and to 
ascertain the conditions that will make for 
deterioration of health in order that they 
may be avoided both in construction and 
usage. If the poorer classes are housed in 
such a manner as to deteriorate health, other 
classes must also suffer, both directly and 
indirectly, so that the mode and effects of 
housing become matters of vital interest to 
all classes. The medical profession appre- 
ciates this probably more than any other 
body of the community. 

My matter divides itself naturally into 
three parts : (i) the ascertained effects upon 
health of certain conditions of habitation ; 

(2) construction and misconstruction ; and 

(3) usage and misusage ; and under these 
heads I propose to deal with the subject. 



PART I. 

THE ASCERTAINED EFFECTS UPON 
HEALTH OF CERTAIN CONDITIONS OF 
HABITATION. 



CHAPTER I. 

THE EFFECTS OF DENSITY OF POPULATION. 

DENSITY of population is usually stated as 
density upon area, per square mile or per 
acre, or as density in cubic space, per house 
or per room. The square measures are 
definite, but the cubic measures vary, within 
limits, according to the size of the houses 
or rooms. It may be assumed that beyond 
a certain point increasing density of popula- 
tion upon area, in the absence of hygienic 
measures, would result in increasing mor- 
tality, and that in proportion to the 
application of these measures jthe mortality 
would diminish. If the population were dis- 
tributed equally upon the land, measurement 



10 



PUBLIC HEALTH 



over large areas would be more reliable, 
but when it is mainly aggregated in large 
towns this measurement gives the mean of 
urban and rural conditions. 



i. Density upon Square Space. 

Density per square kilometre. As illustrative 
of this demographic method of stating the 
effects of density upon nations the following 
figures may be quoted :

Density per square mile. The late Dr. 
Fair 1 estimated that the mortality of districts 
was nearly as the sixth root of the density 
of the inhabitants subsequently amended 
to slightly over the eighth root and he 
framed this table to illustrate his later 
formula :

areas was shown by Dr. Ogle 1 in a table 
relating to the decennium 1871-80, part of 
which is reproduced below, and in which it 
was also shown that any regular progressive 
effect of density upon mortality did not 
become uniform until the population 
approached accumulation, so as to be 
measurable by persons per acre rather than 
per square mile. 

Pursuing the same subject, Dr. Tatham 2 
in tables relating to the decennium 1881-90, 
part of which is also reproduced below, has 
shown that the relationship of density and 
mortality is too complex to admit of being 
expressed by a formula, such as Dr. Farr's, 
that when death-rates corrected for age and 
sex distribution are used the mortality 
appears to increase in more regular pro- 
gression with increase of density, and that 
improved sanitation has lowered the ratio of 
mortality to density. 

It is obvious from the following table and

the Registrar-General. 

3 Supplement to Fifty-fifth (1895) Annual Report of 
the Registrar-General.

the preceding that any formula would require 
an alteration and progressive increase in the 
root of the density to measure the mortality 
and keep pace with the progress of sanitation 
from decennium to decennium. Compare

the following figures of density and mortality 
in the three preceding tables : 1718, 24*9 ; 
1819, 23*5 ; and 1803, 20*4. The tables not 
only show in relation to density a progressive 
decrease of mortality both in the more and 



i 4 PUBLIC HEALTH 

the less populated districts, but also that in 
the more populated districts or towns the 
decrease is relatively greater than in the 
country. Compare also the table in the 
Registrar-General's annual reports of the 
mortality in town and country districts 
through a long series of years. This may 
be attributed to improved domestic and 
municipal sanitation, but factory legisla- 
tion has also contributed its quota, occu- 
pation being an important factor in the 
mortality of adults, and especially male 
adults. 

In the Decennial Supplement to the 
Fifty-fifth Annual Report of the Registrar- 
General for the years 1881-90 Dr. Tatham 
compared the mortality of occupied males 
over 15 years of age in London, in industrial 
districts, and in agricultural districts, 
embracing more than half the occupied 
males in England and Wales in these three 
sections, and he showed in the following 
table that at each age-group the highest 
death-rate occurs in the industrial and the 
lowest in the agricultural districts, London 
occupying an intermediate position :

Of course, in spite of improved conditions 
of sanitation and occupation, there will 
always remain the difference between the 
air of the country and the town. 

It may be concluded that statistics ex- 
tending over large areas and calculated per 
square mile do not form any standard of 
the health of individual districts or parts of 
districts subject to very variable amounts of 
provision for sanitary requirements, especially 
land drainage, sewerage, and water-supply, 
and consisting of populations also varying 
considerably in age, sex, and occupation. 
With regard to density over smaller areas, 
as the populations, whether of rural or of 
urban districts, are mainly aggregated in 
villages, towns, and cities, it follows that 



16 PUBLIC HEALTH 

better results are obtained by comparing the 
statistics of these conglomerations. But 
even towns differ so greatly in the amount of 
open spaces and vacant land that the density 
ratio is not generally a reliable measure ot 
comparison, even when the conditions of 
water-supply, sewerage, and refuse removal 
are similar. It is in constant record that 
urban mortality is highest in districts 
towards the centre of a city and lower 
towards the periphery, is most marked in 
children under five years, and in diseases 
affecting the respiratory organs. London 
furnishes ample statistics establishing this 
in the Registrar-General's returns. The 
results of medical observations have also 
placed on record the effects of towns in 
lowering vitality and energy, enfeebling 
health, impairing nutrition, and diminishing 
resistance to disease. 

Density per acre. When particular areas 
of towns are taken the figures become of 
greater utility, and for the purpose of show- 
ing and comparing the effects of density 
combined with similar insanitary con- 
ditions the principal statistical facts with 
regard to the Boundary-street area, Bethnal

other, the houses themselves, and the class 
of inmates. Mere density alone on square 
space is insufficient to produce all the results 
seen in the preceding table, as shown by the 
dense population housed on the areas of 
some prisons, reformatories, and other public 
institutions. The same applies to large 
blocks of artisans' dwellings, which will be 
considered later : in these the relationships 
of the houses to each other is immensely 
improved, and the inmates are a picked class. 
These comparative figures show that with 
the increasing density on square space there 
is an increasing general and special mortality 
in insanitary areas. The general mortality 
increases at all ages, but particularly under 
one year. The special mortality shows the 
greatest increase amongst infectious diseases, 
the next greatest amongst tuberculous 
diseases, and the next amongst respiratory 
diseases. If all infectious cases be promptly 
removed to hospital and disinfection and 
cleanliness be enforced the increases tend to 
take place in the reverse order, the respiratory 
diseases first, and the infectious diseases 
third, the tuberculous still remaining second,

being largely influenced by pulmonary tuber- 
culosis. This is exactly what a priori might 
be expected, increased density in the same 
average size of house, lower vitality of 
the occupants, enhanced predisposition to 
diseases produced or conveyed aerially. In 
reference to this aerial influence Dr. Ogle 
pointed out l that if a series of industries be 
arranged in the order of the purity of the 
air breathed, apart from dusty occupations, 
the order will also be that of the mortality 
from diseases of the respiratory organs 
together with phthisis.

Compared in another manner phthisis 
shows its dependence upon indoor condi- 
tions. In England previously to 1865 the 
phthisis death-rate was greater among 
females than among males, the difference 
gradually diminishing until the mortality 
among each sex was equal. Since 1866 the 
mortality has continued to diminish in both 
sexes, but in a larger proportion amongst 
females than males. The male rate being 
taken at 1,000 the female rate in succes- 
sive decennia and onwards has been 1076 
(1851-60), 1006 (1861-70), 918 (1871-80), 
871 (1881-90), 802 (1891), 813 (1892), 797 

(1893), 779 (1894), 795 (1895), 767 (1896), 
758 (1897), an d 747 (1898). This greater 
proportionate diminution in the phthisis 
mortality amongst females, the more indoor 
of the two sexes, is significant of the improve- 
ment of dwellings, and more so when it is 
realized that the greatest diminution has taken 
place between the ages of 15 and 45 years, the 
child-bearing and the child-rearing period, 
when the woman is most indoor. Dr. Arthur 
Ransome in his researches on tuberculosis 1

AND HOUSING. 21 

has also shown that in country towns where 
the men are chiefly occupied out of doors 
and the women indoors the death-rates from 
phthisis of females exceed those of males, 
and that in manufacturing towns where 
the men are mostly attracted to indoor 
employments the excess is upon the male sex. 

2. Density in Cubic Space. 

Upon square space, as we have seen, we 
may have increasing density due to the 
crowding of cities with towns, of towns with 
quarters, of quarters with street blocks, and 
of street blocks with houses. It would not 
be wise to conclude that density upon square 
space is a thing to be ignored or to be be- 
littled to the extent of minimising the 
immense value of separating towns or 
boroughs from each other by parks and 
commons, quarters by squares and gardens, 
street-blocks by broad streets and avenues, 
and houses by sufficient rear-spaces. The 
proportionate amount of open square space 
to the covered superficial area of towns and 
quarters has not received any exact estima- 
tion. The width of streets and size of 



22 PUBLIC HEALTH 

rear-spaces, both of great influence upon 
health as shown by large insanitary areas, 
will be considered later. 

Density in cubic square deals with street 
blocks that may be crowded with houses, 
houses with dwellings, dwellings with rooms, 
and rooms with persons. The first three are 
questions of structure embracing the size and 
disposition of rooms, dwellings, houses, and 
street blocks. On the other hand, the 
crowding of persons into these is a question 
of usage upon which some statistics are 
available. 

Persons per House. The varying size of 
houses and the greater variation introduced 
by the modern " flat " method of construction 
has destroyed any value that comparative 
statistics as to the number of persons per 
house may have possessed. This applies 
particularly to London and some other large 
cities, and therefore we must fall back upon 
old and well-known statistics. 

That disease depending solely upon per- 
sonal infection prevails in proportion to the 
increased number of inmates in a house is 
demonstrated by the following table of 



AND HOUSING.

We know that pulmonary phthisis is most 
prevalent in large towns, in the most densely 
built parts of a town, and in the most densely 
populated areas of those parts. In dwelling- 
houses the effects of crowding received the 
clearest exposition in the army medical 
reports and inquiries relating to barracks. 
The mortality from phthisis in the British 
army was: 2 from 1830 to 1846, 7^86 per 
1,000 of strength; from 1859 to 1866, 3-1 
per 1,000 ; from 1867 to 1871, 2'6 per 1,000 ; 
from 1872 to 1880, 2*3 per 1,000; from 1879

to 1884, 2-08 per 1,000 ; from 1886 to 1887, 
1-47 per 1,000; and in 1888, 1*23 per 1,000. 
It was in 1858, the period when the great 
fall in mortality took place, that the cele- 
brated report of the Royal Commission on 
the Sanitary Condition of the Army was 
issued. The mortality from lung diseases 
was found to vary greatly in four branches 
of the army, namely :

The only decided difference between these 
various arms was the condition of overcrowd- 
ing in barracks, and the only decided differ- 
ence made between the earlier and the later 
periods was the increased cubic space per 
head. The same prevalence of lung diseases 
was found in most of the European armies, 
and particularly in those portions stationed 
in large cities. 

Persons per dwelling. Dr. J. B. Russell has 



AND HOUSING. 



shown 1 that a diminution of the size of 
dwellings tends to correspond with an 
increase in the mortality, particularly when 
accompanied by an increase in the number 
of persons per room, and that the progressive 
increase of mortality coincides with the pro- 
gressive increase of the percentage of popula- 
tion living in dwellings of one room, as shown 
by the following table :

The towns fall into two well-marked sets of four, the four upper with death- 
rates below 24 per 1,000 and dwellings of from three to five rooms, the four 
lower with death-rates above 25 per 1,000 and dwellings of less than three 
rooms, and in this group the death-rate rises pari passu with the diminution 
in the size of the average dwelling. (Vital Statistics of the City of Glasgow,

Dundee, found in 1884 in that city that the

results are set out in the preceding table. 

Taking the death-rates in the large dwell-

zymotic diseases was two-fold greater in the 
medium and four-fold in the small ; from 
lung diseases two-fold greater in the medium 
and three-fold in the small ; and from diseases 
of nutrition in children under five years of

atrophy, wasting, and premature birth) over 
two and a half-fold greater in medium and 
over five-fold greater in small dwellings of one 
and two rooms.

A comparison between the increasing

stated to have given the results shown in 
Table XL 1 

Persons per Room. In dealing with persons 
per room we have a basis of which the limits 
are not so wide, and although an inter- 
national basis cannot be defined it may be 
said that in England the limits lie between 
600 and 1,400 cubic feet, but mainly between 
800 and 1,200, and average perhaps some- 
where near 1,000 cubic feet per room, in 
dwellings of less than five rooms in large 
towns. If one regards as overcrowded the 
dwellings in which the number of inhabitants 
exceeds double the number of rooms, the 
following are the results in different cities 
of Europe. 2 (See Table XII.) 

It is probable that the greater attention 
paid to the sanitation of houses in London 
as compared with Paris may in some measure 
account for the mortality not exceeding that

Dr. Korosi has disputed the interpretation

crowding in Budapest, and has pointed out 
that in Budapest 1 only rooms (chambres) in a 
dwelling (logemenf) were included, whereas 
in Paris compartments (pieces), such

siderably reduced, and that of Paris some- 
what increased. Dr. Jacques Bertillon has 
further pointed out that it is probable that

the census enumeration of overcrowding in 
London is understated on account of the 
indefiniteness of the question as to rooms 
and of omissions to reply. 1 

Bearing these points in mind there is a 
remarkable coincidence between the grada- 
tion of overcrowding and of mortality in the 
above table, and, omitting the first and the 
last, this is particularly noticeable in the 
four great cities of the continent in which a 
similarity in the structure of buildings pre- 
vails. This is an important point bearing 
upon one of the disadvantages attending 
the continental mode of construction now

coming into vogue in London. The mor-

proportion to density of persons per room, 
according to the census of December ist, 
1875, was as given in Table XIII. 

The figures show that when the number 
of inmates per room increased from one to 
three, that is, more than treble, the death- 
rate at all ages also trebled, and the death- 
rate under one year quadrupled. 1 The later 
experience of Glasgow 2 of the effect of room- 
density upon tuberculous diseases is that in 
each district of the city where the phthisis 
death-rate exceeds the mean, there also the 
room-density is in excess, and concurrently 
with the rise in the minimum cubic space 
per adult inmate to 400 cubic feet in 1890, 
and the increase in the minimum size of 
rooms by the Building Regulations Act of 
1892, and with other factors, the phthisis 
death-rate is decreasing, but the rate of 
decrease is greater in districts which have 
a concurrent decrease in room-density.

32 PUBLIC HEALTH 

With reference to overcrowding of air- 
space in dwelling-rooms in the Metropolis, 
Mr. Shirley Murphy has shown 1 that: i. In 
London sanitary districts the death-rate 
from phthisis increases pari passu with the 
increase in the proportion of population 
living more than two in a room, in tenements 
of less than five rooms. 2. In these same 
districts, whilst overcrowding is associated 
with a tendency of the population to die 
from disease generally, this tendency is not 
manifested in the case of every disease. The 
mortality from cancer does not appear to 
have any relation whatever to overcrowding, 
that of diarrhoea and the principal zymotic 
diseases (excluding diarrhoea) is not par- 
ticularly apparent, the mortality from tabes 
mesenterica shows a slight correspondence 
with the degree of overcrowding, that from 
tuberculous meningitis shows a little more, 
but the mortality from phthisis closely corre- 
sponds with the degree of density of persons 
per room. 3. In these same districts the 
increase of mortality from all causes in 

Annual Report of Medical Officer of Health of the 
London County Council, 1898. 



AND HOUSING. 33 

proportion to the overcrowding manifests 
itself at the same ages as the increase of 
mortality from phthisis namely, 25, 35, 45. 

It is recognised that the most important 
factor in the spread of pulmonary tuberculosis 
is predisposition, and predisposition can be 
acquired as well as be innate, and, further, 
that by hygienic measures the acquired pre- 
disposition and the innate disposition, and 
even the communicable entity of the disease 
itself, can be so controlled as to be kept 
in abeyance, and even to be permanently 
subdued in the individual. It is further 
recognised that the conditions under which 
it may be acquired are residence in impure 
air, particularly such as is not renewed 
often enough, crowding of persons together, 
absence of sunlight, and dampness. In 
susceptibility to phthisis the power of resist- 
ance appears to be even more important 
than the power of infection, or, in other 
words, the prevention of loss of vitality or 
energy is most important.

than any other condition of health which is 
capable of statistical expression. 1 Hence I 
have dwelt at some length upon density of 
population. If we could obtain a classifica- 
tion of a population according to the amount 
of measured cubic dwelling-space occupied, 
and the causes of mortality, possibly we 
might be able to draw more definite and 
exact conclusions from the number of persons 
per 1,000 cubic feet of dwelling-room space 
than from the number of persons per room, 
per dwelling, or per house. On the other 
hand, it has to be considered that it must 
be healthier to live in two small rooms 
than in one large room of the same cubic 
capacity. The former can be used alter- 
nately, the latter must be used continuously. 
The smaller the dwelling the more numerous 
the uses to which the room or rooms must 
be put, the most important use from a health 
point of view being that of sleeping. In a 
one-room dwelling, even when the bread- 
winner works away, the parents and children

Russell, Trans, of the Insur. and Actuar. Soc., Glasgow,

AND HOUSING. 35 

live by day in the same room previously 
occupied by night for sleeping ; the air 
becomes loaded with the dust of bed-making, 
and is continuously fouled by respiration, 
cooking, washing, &c. In winter and 
between seasons when the window or door 
is not wide open the day usage unfits the 
room for sleeping, and the night usage unfits 
it for living. The children are the greatest 
sufferers in physical condition, and as they 
grow up, possessing never more than feeble 
health, they become still more degenerate 
by corruption of moral fibre. In short, in 
one room, sleeping, food-storage, cooking, 
warming, excretion, ablution, clothes-wash- 
ing, drying, refuse-storage, bathing, living, 
including reading, writing, working, and 
recreation, &c., must be carried on, and the 
continuous and various usages of the room, 
and the differences of age and sex of the 
occupants, must lead one to regard the 
number of rooms in a dwelling of as much 
importance as the cubic space per head, at 
any rate when applied to one- and two-room 
dwellings. 

Although no exactly comparable statistics 

D 2 



36 PUBLIC HEALTH AND HOUSING. 

are at present available of the progressive 
increase of the morbidity and mortality pro- 
duced by the progressive reduction of cubic 
space per head in continuously occupied 
single-room dwellings, we know by expe- 
rience that such a relationship exists, and 
that probably, under a thousand cubic feet 
per head, they are in inverse ratio, all other 
conditions being equal. 

Typhus fever was formerly very prevalent 
under conditions of gross overcrowding, and 
not only typhus fever but other infectious 
diseases tend to diminish in prevalence with 
increase of cubic dwelling-space. 

The phthisis death-rate shows a close 
relationship to density of persons in cubic 
space, and phthisis appears to stand almost 
in the same relationship to respiratory-pollu- 
tion as typhoid fever does to filth-pollution. 
The respiratory diseases apart from phthisis 
are also influenced by impurities of the air, 
and afford some measure of their effects, just 
as diarrhceal diseases, apart from typhoid 
fever, are regarded as bearing a relationship 
to impurities of the soil. 



CHAPTER II. 

EFFECTS UPON HEALTH OF CERTAIN KINDS 
OF DWELLING-HOUSES AND DWELLINGS. 

IT has already been mentioned that the 
crowding of cities with townships, and town- 
ships with quarters, are faults of municipal 
planning. The crowding of quarters with 
street-blocks, and of street-blocks with 
buildings, brings us to the consideration of 
streets and houses, with particular reference 
to the dwellings they contain and the health 
of the inmates. 

STREET-BLOCKS OF HOUSES. 

This is a convenient term for the blocks 
of land isolated from each other by the 
surrounding streets, and which are divided 
into the plots upon which the buildings 
stand. The effects of insufficiently separa- 
ting street-blocks from each other that is, 
of allowing streets to be made too narrow 
displays itself as one of the causes of 



38 PUBLIC HEALTH 

unhealthiness of insanitary areas, the 
statistics of which have been considered, 
and that narrowing of streets directly tends 
to increase the mortality of a population will 
be seen from some statistics when considering 
back-to-back houses. Street-blocks contain 
various kinds of buildings for commercial and 
for residential purposes, and some types of 
the houses and dwellings have been subjected 
to statistical inquiry for instance, back-to- 
back houses, stable-dwellings, tenement 
houses, cellar dwellings and " flat " houses. 

BACK-TO-BACK HOUSES. 

The results of statistical inquiries into the 
effects of back-to-back houses as constructed 
in the North of England vary in some minor 
points, but agree in the main. The first 
statistics published were those of certain 
districts of Salford, from 1879 to 1883, by 
Dr. Tatham, and they showed that parallel 
with the increase in the proportion of back- 
to-back houses in the groups selected, the 
death rates from all causes, pulmonary 
diseases, phthisis, and the principal zymotic 
diseases, and diarrhoea taken separately, also

progressively increased. Dr. Niven later 
confirmed these conclusions by statistics 
relating to the old township of Manchester 
from 1891 to 1894, and found further, 
with regard to age, that in infancy and in 
advanced years there was also an excess of 
mortality in the back-to-back houses. The 
careful statistics of Mr. Herbert Jones from 
1887 to 1892, comparing " through " houses 
in Saltaire with back-to-back houses in 
Shipley, showed that in the latter the 
mortality per 1,000 from all causes was over 
one-third greater than in the former, from 
lung diseases nearly one-half greater, from 
zymotic diseases over one-half greater, and 
from diarrhoea alone over two-thirds greater. 
Collaterally, they also furnished the required 
proof that in proportion to the decrease in 
the width of streets the mortality pro- 
gressively increases amongst a like popula- 
tion living under similar conditions. Dr. 
Arnold Evans also obtained confirmatory 
results of the increase of mortality with the 
increase in the population of back-to-back 
houses in the wards of Bradford in 1890- 
1892. The statistical results obtained by 



AND HOUSING. 41 

these medical officers of health are all set 
out in Table XIV., to which is also added 
the results I have obtained from the statistics 
of stable-dwellings, a class of dwellings 
similar in construction. 

These statistics show that the mortality 
from all causes increases with the increase 
in the number of back-to-back houses, and 
that the mortality from lung diseases, 
phthisis, the principal zymotic diseases, and 
diarrhoea alone, increases in a similar 
manner, and that as the width of the 
streets diminishes the increase in the 
mortality from all causes, and these special 
causes, becomes more and more marked. 

STABLE-DWELLINGS. 

There are certain insanitary conditions 
that attract attention in mews. The houses 
are usually constructed in two stories, with 
stables at ground level, and dwellings over, 
and, like back-to-back houses, have only one 
front, the other three sides being generally 
without windows or doors, and without back 
or side yards. The dwellings are frequently, 
in the absence of plaster ceilings and the 



42 PUBLIC HEALTH 

presence of ill-fitting floor-boards, or by 
means of inside staircases, more or less open 
to the stables below. Beneath the dwelling- 
rooms are horses with their litter and manure, 
drain-gullies (although these are generally 
properly trapped), and often water-closets 
under the stairs, sometimes unventilated. 
These conditions would incline one to 
expect that the mortality would indicate 
marked excess in the same causes of death 
as has been shown by observers in the case 
of back-to-back houses. And the more so 
because the roadways of the larger mews, 
formerly maintained by the owners, have 
been gradually left to the maintenance of 
public authorities, a course leading to the 
prohibition of placing manure and domestic 
refuse outside the stable on what has become 
public way, and tending towards its retention 
under the dwelling-rooms. 

In 1891 an inspection was made of the 
mews and stables in St. Pancras, and from 
the notes then made I have been able by 
means of careful compilation and revision to 
obtain comparable returns of these premises. 
The number of adults and of children under 



AND HOUSING. 43 

ten years living in each dwelling over the 
stables was also ascertained, so that an 
enumeration of the population was made in 
the same year as the census was taken. In 
conjunction with the census returns, this 
renders it possible to compare the population 
under ten years and ten years and over 
living (i) in stable-dwellings, (2) in the whole 
of St. Pancras, and (3) in the whole of 
London. The deaths (corrected for public 
institutions) for the three years 1890, 1891, 
and 1892, were also extracted, and these 
also are comparable with the returns of St. 
Pancras and of London for the same three 
years. The superintendent registrar of St. 
Pancras, Mr. J. Stevens, kindly extracted 
and supplied me with the number of births, 
and these, again, are similarly comparable. 
With the aid of these statistical bases and 
the kind assistance of Mr. S. M. Kaka, 
D. P. H., medical officer of health of Karachi, 
I have been able to prepare a series of tables 
that have been condensed into conveniently 
comparable compass, and are attached hereto. 
[Tables XIX., XX, XXL, and XXIL] 
In examining the tables of population and 



44 PUBLIC HEALTH 

mortality the first point that attracts atten- 
tion is that in the stable-dwellings 34-9 per 
cent, of the population is under ten years of 
age, compared with 21 '6 per cent, in all St. 
Pancras, and 227 in all London. The next 
thing is that the birth-rate is half as high 
again over stables as in the whole of St. 
Pancras and London. It is possible that 
this proportion is slightly exaggerated owing 
to the fact that whereas the population and 
the deaths in stable-dwellings were extracted 
for each dwelling, the births have been 
extracted in bulk for each mews, and a few 
houses not strictly part of the mews may 
have been included. On the other hand, 
this suggests that the death-rate of infants 
under one year per 1,000 births, that stands 
at 193 in stable-dwellings as compared with 
160 in St. Pancras and 157 in London, may 
be actually higher than it appears possibly 
200 or more per 1,000 births. The fact 
remains that there is a high infantile 
mortality. The main causes of infantile 
deaths in stable-dwellings are set out and 
compared with St. Pancras and London in 
Table XV. 



AND HOUSING. 



45 



The total infantile mortality in stable- 
dwellings from these causes is nearly double 
that of St. Pancras and of London. Inci- 
dentally, compared with London in 1890- 
1892, suffocation as a mode of death appears 
to have been more favoured in St. Pancras

and most favoured in stable-dwellings. 
Measles and whooping-cough mortalities 
scarcely differ. Diarrhoea shows somewhat 
under a double death-rate, and bronchitis 
and pneumonia somewhat over a double 
death-rate, compared with St. Pancras and 
London. 



46 PUBLIC HEALTH 

The death-rate of infants under one year 
per 1,000 of total population at all ages was 
in stable-dwellings 9-04, in St. Pancras 4*80, 
and in London 4*92, again showing a heavy 
infantile mortality, and the inference that a 
large proportion of the population consists of 
children. This is corroborated by the actual 
number of persons under 10 years of age 
compared with the number at 10 years and 
over, the proportions being, in stable dwell- 
ings 100 to 186, in St. Pancras 100 to 361, 
and in London 100 to 341. The death-rate 
under ten years of age in London is 38*7 
per 1,000 of population under 10 years, and 
i per 1,000 higher in St. Pancras, and 2*3 
per 1,000 higher in stable-dwellings. Over 
10 years of age per 1,000 of population the 
mortality in London is 15*5, 1*6 higher in 
St. Pancras, and 4-6 higher in stable- 
dwellings. 

In order to compare stable-dwellings with 
back-to-back houses the following table 
(XVI.) of mortality has been drawn. 

Back-to-back houses show an excess in 
mortality from all causes, from pulmonary 
diseases, from phthisis, from the principal

zymotic diseases, and from diarrhoea, taken 
separately. Stable dwellings show an excess 
of mortality from the same causes, but not 
in the same proportion. The death-rate at 
all ages in the stable-dwellings is 5-4 above 
that of St. Pancras, and 7-4, or nearly one- 
third more, above that of London. That 
this is not mainly due to the high infantile 
mortality is seen from the fact that whereas 
the mortality under 10 years of age is 2*3 
above that of London, the mortality of 10 
years and over is 4*6 above that of London 
per 1,000 of population living between the 
two respective age periods. The death-rate 
at all ages from the " principal zymotic 
diseases " is the same in St. Pancras and 
London namely, 2*69 per 1,000 ; but stable- 
dwellings show a rate 2*12 higher namely, 
4*8 1 per 1,000. The diarrhoea death-rate, 
which appears as 0*62 per 1,000 in London 
and O'53 in St. Pancras, is three times as 
high in stable-dwellings namely, 1*66 per 
1,000 population. Tuberculous diseases are 
0*23 higher in St. Pancras than in London, 
and 0*20 higher in stable-dwellings than in 
St. Pancras, phthisis 0-20 and O'li higher 



AND HOUSING. 49 

per 1,000 of population. One might expect 
higher results in back-to-back type of houses. 
Respiratory diseases show a high death-rate, 
8*17, over stables, compared with 5-25 in St. 
Pancras and 4*93 in London. The rate is 
3*24 higher than in London, but bronchitis 
and pneumonia alone show a still higher 
rate, approaching twice that of London. In 
the Registrar-General's last decennial report 
the mortality of cabmen and carmen from 
diseases of the respiratory system is given as 
128 and 170 respectively, when 100 is taken 
as the standard of all occupied males, and 
the comparative figures for all engaged in 
various branches of transport service by 
road, rail, river, and sea is 147 ; but that the 
high rate in stable-dwellings is not due solely 
to occupation is shown by the high mortality 
from bronchitis and pneumonia amongst the 
home-dwelling infants. This is not due to 
poverty, as cabmen and carmen are not 
indigent as a class ; the families of even the 
poorer are fairly cared for in food and 
clothing, and the better off are well fed and 
well clothed. If the last three double rows 
of figures are taken and the excess mortality

in the groups of back-to-back houses and in 
stable-dwellings over the groups of the other 
houses with which they are respectively com- 
pared are set out in tabular form, the pro- 
portionate differences become apparent :

It is seen at once that in stable-dwellings 
there is excessive mortality from pulmonary 
diseases and under one year of age, and a 
lesser excess from phthisis. The probability 
appears that the vicissitudes of temperature 
in the occupations of the adults and the con- 
struction of the homes of the infants in 
stable-dwellings are prominent factors in the 
causes of mortality. Some stables are 
draughty during cleaning time when the 
stable doors and loft doors are open. Some 
stable roofs have no ceilings below to equalise 
the temperature. Some also have skylights 
over the back dwelling-rooms, although 



AND HOUSING. 51 

seldom open, and there are air-bricks in the 
back walls of some stables. Yet they show a 
high zymotic death-rate per 1,000 of popu- 
lation, the individual diseases appearing as 
follows :

The death-rates are very high from 
diarrhoea and diphtheria and high from 
whooping-cough, even when a number of 
unhealthy conditions are absent. For stables 
have no underground rooms or cellars, and 
no ground floors below the level of the 
street, and there is less liability to the 
rise of ground-air under the dwelling-rooms 
and to the dampness of walls of the dwelling- 
rooms by capillarity. 

The conclusions to be drawn are that the 
occupants of stable-dwellings have a high 
birth-rate and a high mortality under one 
year and at all ages and high death-rates 
from pulmonary diseases, both of infants and

adults, and from the zymotic diseases, espe- 
cially diarrhoea and diphtheria. These point 
to the effects of the vicissitudes of tempera- 
ture affecting adults and unhealthy conditions 
at home affecting young children. 

TENEMENT HOUSES. 

The statistics available in reference to the 
old type of vertical houses sublet in separate 
dwellings or tenements are those derived 
from the consideration of insanitary areas, of 
the diminished number of rooms in dwellings, 
and the increased number of persons per 
room. These points have already been 
considered, and shown to produce a very 
unfavourable influence upon health, espe- 
cially amongst young children, and to conduce 
to the acquirement of infectious diseases, 
and to the prevalence of phthisis and 
respiratory diseases. 

It may be concluded that in the old type 
of vertical dwelling-houses constructed for 
one family, the morbidity and mortality tend 
to increase in direct ratio with the increase 
in the number of dwellings in the houses, 
the decrease in the number of rooms in the

dwellings, and the increase of the number 
of persons in the rooms, and that statistics 
of streets of tenement-houses would show 
this result. 

UNDERGROUND DWELLINGS. 

Underground dwellings are mostly found 
in tenement houses, and it is to be regretted 
that there are no English statistics available

in reference to this class of dwellings. An 
investigation into their mortality and mor- 
bidity would be of considerable value. The 
only statistics that give some indication are 
from Berlin as quoted in the table above in 
reference to the mortality in the several

stories of dwelling-houses. From this table 
it appears that in houses of six stories and 
over the order of mortality from lowest to 
highest occurs on the first, second, ground, 
and third stories, the basement, and the 
fourth floor. 

It is surmised that the domestic circum- 
stances of those living in the basement are 
doubtless better than those of the inmates of 
the fourth and fifth floors, and that this 
accounts for the slightly lower mortality. 

In some comparative experiments upon 
the air of a basement room and that of a 
first floor room in an ordinary dwelling- 
house, Dr. H. R. Kenwood 1 " found a 
marked predominance of impurity, both 
gaseous and suspended, in the atmosphere 
of the basement room, and a difference 
ranging from 4 to 6 per cent, in the relative 
humidity of the two rooms." 

" FLAT " HOUSES. 

An investigation into the statistics of 
Peabody Buildings in London was made by 

1 Public Health, vol. v., June, 1893. 



AND HOUSING. 57 

Dr. A. Newsholme l in 1888-90, and he 
came to the following conclusions: i. In 
the year 1890, contrary to expectation, and 
notwithstanding the high birth-rate, the age 
distribution of the population of the Peabody 
Buildings was less favourable to a low 
mortality than that of London as a whole. 
2. The death-rate of the Peabody Buildings 
averaged about two per 1,000 lower than 
that of London during the 12 years ending 
with 1885. During the four subsequent 
years the death-rate of the Peabody Build- 
ings has remained about stationary, while 
that of London has shown a further decline, 
thus making the metropolitan death-rate 
approximate more closely to that of the 
Peabody Buildings. 3. The death-rate at 
different groups of ages is lower in the 
Peabody Buildings than for the whole of 
London with the exception of the ages from 
o to 5 years and from 15 to 25 years. 
4. The infantile mortality is much lower in 
the Peabody Buildings than for all London. 
During the nine years from 1882 to 1890 it 

1 Vital Statistics of Peabody Buildings, &c., Journal of 
the Royal Statistical Society, 1891, 



58 PUBLIC HEALTH 

averaged in London 151*9 per 1,000 births 
and in the Peabody Buildings 139*2 per 
1,000 births. 5. The death-rate from 
diarrhoea is slightly lower, and from enteric 
fever only half that of the whole metropolis. 

6. On the other hand, the diseases more 
directly due to infection (scarlet fever, 
diphtheria, and still more, whooping-cough 
and measles) are more fatal, and therefore 
probably more prevalent. If the Metro- 
politan Asylums Board would admit cases 
of measles into their hospitals the mortality 
from measles might be very much reduced. 

7. The death-rate from phthisis and other 
tuberculous diseases is slightly higher in the 
Peabody Buildings than for all London. 

8. Farr's formula as to the increased mor- 
tality with increased density of population 
has no application to the Peabody Buildings. 

9. The true density that should be considered 
is the number of persons to each room, not 
the number of persons to a given acre. 

The medical officer of health of St. Giles, 
Mr. S. R. Lovett, has kindly supplied me 
with the records he has kept through a 
series of years of the population, births, and 



AND HOUSING. 59 

deaths in four large blocks of buildings in 
St. Giles. 1 The numbers are not large, but 
the figures extend over a period of 10 years 
and have been carefully recorded and 
corrected for public institutions. These are 
set out in Tables XXIV. and XXV., together 
with the corresponding figures for St. Giles 
district and for London. Comparing the 
buildings in St. Giles and in London for 10 
years, from 1890 to 1899, the percentage of 
population under five years was respectively 
17-0, io'i, and 11-9 per cent. ; the birth-rate 
was 37*3, 27*6, and 30*4 per 1,000 of popula- 
tion ; the mortality under one year of age 
per 1,000 births was 130, 153, and 160; the 
death-rate under five years of age per 1,000 
population under five years of age was 50*7, 
76*9, and 65*6 ; the death-rate over five years 
of age per 1,000 population over five years 
was 10*4, 16*3, and 13*6 ; the death-rate at 
all ages per 1,000 population at all ages was 
I7*3j 21*3, and 19*8; and the death-rate 
from the seven principal zymotic diseases 
was 3'o, 2*1, and 2*7. 

1 See also Annual Reports of St. Giles from 1890 to 
1899. 



60 PUBLIC HEALTH 

Comparing these statistics with the results 
obtained by Dr. Newsholme, and taking his 
conclusions seriatim : i. The age distribution 
appears to have varied. In 1881 in London 
13* i per cent, of the population were under 
five years of age, in 1890-99 the percentage 
was 1 1 '9 only. 2. The death-rate in Pea- 
body Buildings, which was from 1881 to 
1885 about two per 1,000 lower than in 
London, was from 1890 to 1899 in St. Giles's 
buildings about 2*5 lower than London. 

3. The infantile mortality, which was 
139 per 1,000 births in Peabody Buildings 
compared with 152 in London, was later 
130 in St. Giles's buildings, compared with 
160 in London. The birth-rate, however, in 
the later period was three per 1,000 lower in 
the buildings and a trifle higher in London. 

4. The death-rate in the later period from 
diarrhoea was considerably lower, and from 
enteric fever only half that of London, the 
latter in exactly the same ratio as in the 
earlier period. 5. The death-rates in the 
later period from scarlet fever and from 
diphtheria, especially from the former, were 
higher in the buildings than in London. From 



AND HOUSING. 61 

whooping-cough the London rate was higher. 
These results compared in tabular form 
appear in Table XXVI. 

Therefore, on the whole, the figures of 
the later investigation in the main follow 
the earlier, for although whooping-cough 
comes out much better measles comes out 
much worse, and the conclusion is confirmed 
that the diseases due to direct infection are 
more prevalent in buildings composed of 
multiple dwellings. An indication that the 
most important considerations lie in the 
density of persons in rooms, of rooms in 
dwellings, and of dwellings in houses, and 
that not merely density in rooms but in the 
three-fold sense of density in the cubic space 
rather than on square space, lies the key to 
the prevention of morbidity and mortality. 

Although it has been shown that in 
Peabody Buildings, when compared with 
London or its districts, the death-rates are 
lower except those from infantile infectious 
diseases, two important facts must be 
remembered : (i) that the population of 
these buildings is a selected one living 
under special conditions, and (2) that of the

population of all London some are living in 
old unhealthy houses and some even in whole 
areas of old unhealthy houses. In reference 
to " model dwellings," as they were then 
called, as Mr. Gatliff 1 put it 25 years ago, 
the inmates of these houses undergo a two- 
fold process of selection, firstly, the inmates 
select these houses as harmonising with 
their decent tastes, and, in the second place, 
they are chosen from a long list of applicants 
according to the discretion of the manager. 
Houses in flats, such as Peabody Buildings, 
are also kept under strict supervision by 
resident superintendents, so that both the 
buildings and the tenants are maintained 
healthily, accidental nuisances are imme- 
diately remedied, and wilful nuisances are 
promptly stopped. Tenants who do not 
conform to the rules and regulations or who 
are otherwise objectionable either leave 
because they feel out of their element 
or are firmly persuaded to quit, so that 
only those who lead well-ordered lives in

on Health and Morals, Journal of the Royal Statistical 
Society, 1875. 



AND HOUSING. 65 

well-cared-for dwellings, in association more 
or less with those of similar inclinations, 
remain. In other words, the comparative 
healthiness of Peabody Buildings is due as 
much to improved supervision of usage as to 
improved methods of construction. 

It is for these and other reasons that any 
comparison between the statistics as to the 
houses demolished on an insanitary area 
and of the new buildings erected on the site 
would be of little value. The changes 
effected are radical alterations. The width 
of the streets is increased, the building area 
is diminished, the height and size of the new 
houses are increased, and the dwellings are 
expanded through a larger amount of cubic 
space. The conditions for the admission of 
external light and air are improved, the con- 
ditions for the supply of pure water and the 
removal of foul are ameliorated, and the 
opportunities for dampness and effluvia are 
absent. But in addition there is a funda- 
mental change in the class of the population ; 
those displaced never become the occupants 
of the new buildings, and whatever class of 
new building is erected they never will 

P.H. F 



66 PUBLIC HEALTH AND HOUSING. 

become occupants. The pick of a neigh- 
bourhood will always enter the newest and 
best type of dwellings, and the residuum of 
the neighbourhood will always seek the 
oldest and worst. 

DISEASED HOUSES. 

The association of certain houses with 
certain diseases is a mode of classification 
adopted by many investigators. That com- 
municable forms of disease should be asso- 
ciated with infected houses is undoubted, and 
" consumptive houses " are amongst this 
class. Pathogenic bacteria find within the 
dwelling more congenial soil than in the 
open air, and when they are not introduced 
by infected individuals they may be by the 
clothing and by the feet, or by animals and 
by insects. Although investigation has also 
been extended to "pneumonia houses," and 
suspected " cancer houses," these classes of 
houses must rather be regarded as suffering 
from infection remediable more by isolation, 
disinfection and cleansing than by improved 
construction and usage. 



CHAPTER III. 

EFFECTS OF CERTAIN DEFECTS OF DWELLING- 
HOUSES. 

MOST of the faults of the construction and 
arrangements of dwellings give rise to impure 
air and may be classed as air deficiencies 
and effluvia. Under this head, in addition 
to the curtailment of cubic space, would 
come want of perflation and ventilation, want 
of cleanliness, defects of drainage and of the 
removal of solid refuse, and unhealthy con- 
ditions of the surface and subsoil of the site 
and surroundings. The only conditions that 
may be regarded apart from deficient and 
impure air are coldness, dampness, deficient 
light, deficient water supply, and general 
atmospheric impurity. 

Atmospheric Impurity and Air-Supply. 
Commencing with the last-mentioned first, it 
is an unavoidable consequence of the aggre- 
gation of communities that the atmosphere 

F 2 



68 PUBLIC HEALTH 

of a town in which the population lives 
immersed, from which it draws freely and 
continuously its air-supply, and into which 
it casts equally freely and continuously 
its gaseous emanations, should suffer dete- 
rioration. The ozone disappears, the oxygen 
diminishes, and the carbonic acid increases 
in relative proportion, 1 and gaseous and 
suspended impurities are added. The re- 
duction of these impurities, especially smoke 
and fumes, is the work of municipalities, by 
supervision, and by contributing towards 
restoring the balance in the composition of 
the atmosphere by the provision of open 
spaces and vegetation. 

Water - supply and Inaccessibility. Air- 
supply is found wherever a community 
settles, but water-supply must be sought. 
The accessibility or facility of water-supply 
determines the locality of settlement, and the 
growth of the community is largely deter- 
mined by the amount, and the health by the 
purity. Private and public ownership, inter- 
mittent and constant service, are stages 
in the water-supply of towns and cities, 
1 Angus Smith : Air and Rain. 



AND HOUSING. 69 

and, as Dr. G. V. Poore 1 has pointed out, 
high pressure and constant water-supply, 
combined with prompt water-carriage removal 
of excreta, has increased the aggregation of 
the population of European and American 
cities by enabling dwellings to be piled one 
upon another many stories high. This pro- 
cess of piling upwards is of more recent 
growth in London than in continental cities, 
and as a newer departure, and less under- 
stood structurally, it is of great importance 
at this period in its possible effects upon 
health. 

The principles of general water-supply may 
be said to be now fairly well known both in 
their application to public supply and private 
service, so that our cities are spared the 
serious effects of impure or polluted water 
effects so well known as not to require re- 
statement. The main points that interest 
us at the moment are sufficiency and accessi- 
bility. The constant high-pressure system 
supplies the sufficiency, but the accessibility 
is not to be found, especially in ordinary 
vertical houses, sublet in many dwellings or 
1 The Dwelling-house, 1897. 



70 PUBLIC HEALTH 

tenements, where the difficulties of the main- 
tenance of cleanliness are increased by the 
closer and closer aggregation of population, 
and a premium is placed upon the use of 
water by the vertical and horizontal distance 
through which it has to be carried to and 
fro. Mutatis mutandis, similar observations 
apply to drainage, and the distance to be 
traversed in sublet or tenement houses, 
especially by those on the upper floors, to 
get rid of liquid refuse and fouled water, also 
militates strongly against cleanliness, and 
cleanliness largely influences the purity of 
the air of interiors. 

Deficient Light. Darkness is known to 
cause anaemia and to retard the development 
of animals, and the younger the animal the 
greater the effects. 1 In the absence of light 
plants etiolate, without light there is no fructi- 
fication, and few plants can flower without 
direct sunshine. Direct sunshine, and even 
diffused daylight, warms and dries, sets up 
air-currents, removes stagnant air, dissipates 
humidity, resolves unstable compounds and

Physiques sur la vie, 1824. 



AND HOUSING. 71 

conduces to cleanliness, and the absence of 
light produces opposite results. Darkness 
favours the growth of cryptogamic plants, 
and the most lowly organisms flourish best 
in semi-darkness, notably, the moulds and 
the bacteria. On the contrary, the higher 
plants and animals are most benefited by 
light, which is destructive to the lower 
organisms that number amongst them the 
injurious pathogenic organisms of man. 
Tyndall, Downes, Duclaux, Koch, Roux, 
Raum, Ransome, and many others have 
shown by experiment that light is inimical 
and darkness beneficial to micro-organic life. 
The bacilli of anthrax, diphtheria, and tuber- 
culosis have so responded, and many other 
pathogenic and non-pathogenic organisms, 
including the pneumococcus, and the 
pyogenic cocci. The most recent experi- 
ments 1 are upon tuberculous sputum, and 
they have shown that one hour's drying and 
exposure to direct sunlight has destroyed its 
virulence, and that from four to seven hours' 
exposure to diffuse light in all cases markedly 

1 P. Jousset : Comptes Rendus des Stances de la 
Socit6 de Biologic, lii., 1900. 



72 PUBLIC HEALTH 

diminished its virulence and in some instances 
destroyed it. Briefly, the indications of 
experiment and observation are that the 
healthiness of the dwelling in this country 
increases in proportion to the amount of 
daylight and sunlight admitted. The day 
lighting of habitable rooms should be such 
as to enable reading, writing, and sewing 
to be carried on with facility. 

Dampness. Marshy soil has from time 
immemorial been associated with malaria 
and ague, and it is now known that stag- 
nant surface water in the neighbourhood 
of dwellings is the breeding-ground for the 
larvae of mosquitoes that act as carriers 
of the parasites of malaria from infected 
to uninfected individuals. Wetness of the 
soil or subsoil is also known to predis- 
pose the dwellers upon it to throat- 
soreness, rheumatism, respiratory diseases, 
and phthisis. The earliest indication in this 
country of the effect of damp subsoil was 
given by Sir George Buchanan in his inquiry 
of 1865, upon which Sir J. Simon said 1 that 
the statistics indicate "that the drying of

AND HOUSING. 73 

soil which has in most cases accompanied 
the laying of main sewers in the improved 
towns has led to the diminution more or less 
considerable of phthisis "; and he cited the 
reduction in the death-rates of the first fifteen 
towns in Dr. Buchanan's table as being in 
Salisbury 49 per cent, of its previous rate, in 
Ely 47 per cent., in Rugby 43 per cent., in 
Banbury 41 per cent., in Worthing 36 per 
cent., in Macclesfield 31 per cent., in 
Leicester 32 per cent., in Newport 32 per 
cent., in Cheltenham 26 per cent., in Bristol 
22 per cent., in Dover 20 per cent., in War- 
wick 19 per cent., in Croydon 17 per cent., 
in Cardiff 17 per cent., and in Merthyr n 
per cent. Dr. Bowditch of Boston, U.S.A., 
had in 1862 arrived at similar conclusions, 
which were subsequently published. From 
beneath the house water may show itself as 
actual wetness, or as creeping dampness, or 
as imperceptible ground-vapour, especially in 
the basement. Dryness of the site and of 
the house are recognised as essential to a 
healthy dwelling. More recently 1 the effect 

1 Ransome : Tuberculosis, Weber- Parkes Prize Essay, 
1897. 



7 4 PUBLIC HEALTH 

of drying upon the virulence of cultivations 
of tubercle bacillus and of tuberculous 
sputum, the specimens being kept in the 
dark in closed capsules with access of little 
air, has shown that moderate desiccation 
slightly retards the first manifestations of 
tuberculosis and prolonged drying ultimately 
kills the bacillus. All our largest towns are 
now sewered, and drying of the soil and sub- 
soil is regarded as essential, as well as the 
prevention of the rising of dampness through 
floors and up walls, and the soakage of 
wetness through roofs and down walls. 

Coldness. This is essentially a charac- 
teristic of jerry-built houses. These houses 
are so styled more on account of the inferior 
materials and bad workmanship in the car- 
casses than of the rough fitting and finishing, 
or of the scamped fitting of insanitary appli- 
ances. The use of green or unseasoned 
woodwork and joinery, and the finishing with 
plaster containing no hair, are apt to check 
themselves at the end of a short time. The 
laying of porous, crumbling bricks, with 
mortar deficient in lime, to sustain " shaky " 
or splitting timber, is controlled more or less 



AND HOUSING. 75 

by the surveyor or building inspector, who 
also now requires damp-courses in the walls, 
concrete in the basement, and dry areas 
around the building. The main charac- 
teristics of jerry-built dwelling-houses are 
deficient dryness and deficient equability of 
temperature. Popularly they are said to 
be cold and damp, the dampness coming 
directly through the walls, and the coldness 
being also due to this flimsiness. Increased 
vigilance and building by-laws have made it 
much less easy to build this class of house, 
and this to the advantage of public health, as, 
apart from other insanitary conditions, the 
coldness and dampness within the dwelling 
are not only injurious themselves, but indi- 
rectly they lead to the closure of all openings 
and the stagnation of air in order to obtain 
more warmth. 

Air -deficiency. The ill-effects of deficient 
wind-play (circumflation) in narrow streets, 
want of perflation as seen in extreme cases 
in back-to-back houses, and insufficient cubic 
space in dwellings curtailed in size, and 
crowding in the dwelling-rooms, have already 
been dwelt upon. In addition to respiration 



76 PUBLIC HEALTH 

the air is fouled by combustion, which in 
better-class houses generally takes place by 
the use of excessive gas-light, but in poor 
tenement houses the smoky chimney almost 
invariably adds to the foulness of the air, 
and the components of coal smoke we know 
are prejudicial to health. The smoky chim- 
neys indicate also the want of ventilation in 
such houses, in some almost amounting to 
stagnation. The ill-effects of stagnation of 
air are also demonstrated by the " dry-rot " 
that sets in below unventilated floors, the 
absence of air-currents not removing con- 
densed moisture, and the fungus spores which 
are deposited flourishing in an equable tem- 
perature, in darkness and quiescence. It 
has also been shown by experiment 1 that 
finely divided tuberculous matter and tuber- 
culous sputum in free currents of air are 
rapidly deprived of virulence, and in the 
absence of currents of air the bacillus retains 
its power for long periods of time.

be wafted by the air, and in wet weather 
may be carried by the foot of man or animals 
into houses and so contaminate the air of 
dwellings and food. Pathogenic organisms 
find in the dwelling the most favourable 
warmth and nutriment conducive to their 
growth and distribution. Dr. Sidney Martin 1 
conducted a series of laboratory experiments 
upon virgin soils and organically polluted 
soils with a view to ascertaining the results 
when inoculated with the typhoid bacillus. 
The virgin soils, both peaty and sandy, after 
inoculation with various typhoid cultures and 
incubation at various temperatures, showed 
no sign of growth whatever when tested at 
the end of 14 days, 20 days, and 23 days. On 
the other hand, the organically contaminated 
soils from the neighbourhood of habitations, 
after sterilisation and inoculation with the 
typhoid cultures, showed that either a part 
or the whole of the experimental soil had 
become pervaded by the growing bacillus, 
the results varying in extent with temperature

and moisture, but also showing that the 
growth and diffusion take place at ordinary 
temperatures of the atmosphere. Dr. Martin 
has also shown that this multiplication is 
still going on at the end of many months. 
He has since shown that garden soils when 
sterilised are more favourable to the vitality 
and growth of the typhoid bacillus than 
when unsterilised, and that the disappear- 
ance of the bacillus appears to take place 
part passu with the increase in the number 
of putrefactive bacteria. In 1896-97 Dr. 
John Robertson, 1 the Medical Officer of 
Health of Sheffield, made a series of out- 
door experiments, inoculating patches of 
soil by drenching the surface with typhoid 
cultivations in bouillon diluted with water, 
the superficial surface of the soil having 
been removed and replaced. The results 
showed that the typhoid organism is capable 
of growing rapidly in certain soils, and that 
under certain conditions the organism can 
survive from one summer to another in spite 
of rain and snow, frost and heat. Some 
laboratory experiments on similar soil went

to show that vegetation was detrimental to 
the growth of the organism. Following 
upon this Dr. P. Boobbyer 1 made a statis- 
tical investigation into the distribution during 
the 10 years from 1887-96 of typhoid fever 
cases among houses in Nottingham furnished 
with different types of closets, and he found 
that the proportional annual incidence in 
midden-privy houses was one case in 37 
houses, in pail-closet houses one in 120, 
and in water-closet houses one case in 558 
houses that is, that the incidence upon 
houses with privies was more than three 
times as great as that upon houses with 
pail-closets, and that upon houses with pail- 
closets more than four and a half times 
greater than that upon houses with water- 
closets. Further, he found that the disease 
is much more liable to recur after it has 
arisen in the privy houses and the pail-closet 
houses than in the water-closet houses. In 
1897, f * ne 4 1 second consecutive cases 
that occurred in single houses, 37 were in 
pail-closet houses, four were in privy houses,

and there were none in water-closet houses. 
Of the ii third consecutive cases that 
occurred in single houses, eight were in pail- 
closet houses, three were in privy houses, 
and there were none in water-closet houses. 
Of the four fourth consecutive cases in single 
houses, all were in pail-closet houses. He 
pointed out that the closet-pail is essentially 
only a small portable privy above ground, 
and is capable of polluting the air, the soil, 
and the surroundings almost as much as the 
privy, especially by spilling and leakage in 
scavenging. It has been proved by experi- 
ments 1 upon rabbits, guinea-pigs, and rats, 
and has been confirmed, that the inspiration 
of putrid gases predispose the animals to 
the pathogenic action of even attenuated 
typhoid bacilli and of bacterium coli ; that 
this predisposition is due to the combination 
of gases given out by putrid fermentations, 
and not to any one separately ; and that it

is probable that this experimental predis- 
position is diminished by prolonged breathing 
of the said gases. In other words, that the 
gases from drains, from sewers, and from 
other polluted sources, predispose those who 
inhale them sufficiently, and especially new- 
comers, to enteric fever. These gases lower 
nutrition and vitality, and probably tend to 
predispose to other ailments. In addition 
to enteric fever, it is very generally admitted 
that sewer-gas may cause sore-throat, and 
it is well known that persons suffering from 
sore-throat are susceptible to diphtheria and 
to scarlet fever. Septic poisoning, or blood- 
poisoning, has frequently been found asso- 
ciated with sewer-gas, and its congeners, 
puerperal fever and pneumonia, have often 
followed. Diarrhoea, too, has been attributed 
to foul gases either indirectly or directly. 
Professor Corfield 1 has given a large number 
of instances illustrating the close connection 
between sewer-gases and these diseases. 
Ground vapours also produce their ill-effects. 
By experiment it has been shown that 
condensed organic vapour from ground-air

or from human breath 1 forms an excellent 
cultivating medium for the bacillus of 
tubercle when away from the influence of 
fresh air and sunlight or daylight. This 
power of promoting growth is particularly 
manifest when the supporting substance is 
common wall-paper. On this substance the 
growth of the bacillus may take place at 
the ordinary temperature of dwelling-rooms. 
Ground vapours from below dwelling-houses, 
being foul and damp, are also known to 
pollute the air of interiors, to deteriorate the 
health of the inmates, and to predispose 
them to disease. 

Decay and Dilapidation. Miquel, Emme- 
rich, Carnelly, Haldane, Anderson, John- 
stone, and other observers and experimenters 
have shown that with the increasing use and 
age of a dwelling-house the walls and spaces 
beneath floors become liable to harbour 
micro-organisms to an increasing degree. 
The more the surfaces, especially the floors 
and walls, of a house become worn and 
defective, the better lodgment they present

for the accumulation of organic matter the 
nidus of micro-organisms and the less 
attention paid to repair and redecoration 
the more unhealthy the influence of the house 
becomes. 

All these experiments and observations 
indicate the necessity for such construction, 
maintenance, and usage as best conduce to 
the cleanliness and purity of the air in and 
around dwelling-houses, in order not only to 
prevent disease, but also to prevent the loss 
of that vitality, vigour, and energy which 
cannot easily be measured by experiments or 
by statistics.

PART II. 

CONSTRUCTION AND MIS-CONSTRUCTION. 
CHAPTER I. 

STREETS, STREET-BLOCKS, AND HOUSES J 
FRONT AND REAR SPACE. 

THE hygienic influence of sunshine and 
daylight, of wind and breeze, in dispelling 
dampness, destroying micro-organisms, and 
dispersing gaseous and suspended impurities, 
has been proved by experiment and experi- 
ence. Therefore the direction and width of 
streets and the height of houses are important 
points in their influence upon dwellings and 
health. 

The orientation of streets may be either 
squarely or diagonally in line with the four 
cardinal points. As the main object of 
orientation is to provide the maximum of 
sunshine to houses, the rear as well as the 



PUBLIC HEALTH AND HOUSING. 85 

front must be considered. When houses are 
constructed in parallel rows, with open inter- 
spaces, so that there are no houses in the 
streets at right angles, as is sometimes seen 
in recently-erected blocks (Fig. i, a), the 
square orientation obtains the fullest and 
most equable distribution of sunshine. But 
when houses are built around all four sides 
of rectangular street-blocks then the diagonal 
orientation secures most sunshine, although 
with complete enclosure of the central space 
the rear receives less perflation the common 
form of construction of street-blocks (Fig. i,b). 
In a street oriented east and west the front 
of the buildings on the south side of the 
street and the back of those on the north 
side are deprived of sunshine, and in order 
that the front of those on the north side 
and the rear of those on the south side 
may obtain sunshine it would be necessary, 
according to the estimate of Clement, to 
increase the width of " east and west " streets 
and rear spaces in 60 degrees of latitude 
(e.g., Stockholm) to more than seven times 
the width of those in 40 degrees of latitude 
(e.g., Madrid) and, according to the estimate

of Trelat, 1 to widen streets north and south 
twice, and streets east and west four times, 
the height of the houses bordering them. 
Both of these are impracticable, so Arnould 
has concluded that the orientation of streets 
is beyond exact control, and attention 
should rather be directed to limiting the 
height of houses in relation to the width 
of streets. It must also be remembered 
that a north light without sunshine is prefer- 
able for many industrial and artistic occupa- 
tions. Whilst admitting that the front and 
rear spaces of houses in east and west 
streets require to be wider than those in 
north and south streets, the practical limit 
has been adopted that houses should not 
exceed in height the width of the open spaces 
at the front and at the rear, but as only half 
the space at the rear is assumed to belong 
to one house, the house is permitted to be 
raised twice the height of the width of its 
own rear space, applying the 45-degree angle 
to the front and the 63^-degree angle at the 
rear. This is the principle embodied in the 
London Building Acts, 1894 and 1898, 
1 Tenth International Congress of Hygiene, Paris, 1 900. 



88 PUBLIC HEALTH 

although its application is limited to new 
buildings and new streets. Briefly the 
provisions of these Acts are as follows. 1 No 
new dwelling-house may be erected so as to 
exceed 80 feet in height (exclusive of two 
stories in the roof) without the consent of 
the London County Council (Sections 47, 48, 
49, and 50 of the 1894 Act). The height of 
a dwelling-house erected in a street less than 
50 feet wide and laid out after August yth, 
1862, must not exceed the measurement 
between the front wall of the building and 
the opposite side of the street (Section 49 ot 
the 1894 Act). Working-class dwellings are 
specially limited as to height, where they are 
(whether on old foundations or not) within 
20 feet of the centre of any highway, at 
whatever date laid out. The height of the 
dwelling-house in such case must not, with- 
out consent of the Council, exceed the 
measurement between its front wall and the 
opposite side of the street (Section 13 of the 
1894 Act). All dwelling-houses abutting on 
streets are further limited in height by the

Council, 1885-1900. 



AND HOUSING. 89 

air-space provided at the rear of them. On 
a street laid out after 1894 the height may 
not exceed twice the open space behind it. 
This open space must be of an aggregate 
extent of not less than 150 square feet. On 
a street laid out before 1894 * ne height may 
not exceed twice such depth with an addition 
of 16 feet. The open space behind the 
building may in general be covered up to a 
height of 1 6 feet, but this is not allowed in 
the case of working-class dwellings (Section 
41 of the 1894 Act). Working-class dwell- 
ings not abutting on streets may not be built 
until the council or tribunal of appeal has 
sanctioned the plans for them, but such 
sanction cannot be refused if it is proposed 
to provide about the dwellings an open 
space or spaces equivalent to the open space 
or spaces which should have been provided 
under the Act if such dwellings had been 
erected abutting on a street laid out before 
1894 (Section 42 of the 1894 Act). For the 
purpose of securing through perflation to 
streets the London Building Acts also em- 
power the County Council to refuse to sanc- 
tion a new street unless it exceeds 40 feet

tions) . 

The Acts provide that on a domestic 
building erected in London after January 
ist, 1895, in an existing street, and having 
a basement habitable for sleeping or living 
purposes, there must be provided in the rear 



AND HOUSING. 91 

for the purpose of light and air an exclusive 
open space of not less than 100 square feet 
free from any erection thereon above the level 
of the adjoining pavement. If the building 
erected be in a new street, then in the rear 
there must be provided an exclusive open 
space of not less than 150 square feet, 
extending throughout the entire width of the 
building and to a depth of at least 10 feet 
from the building. Of this open space 100 
square feet must be left open for a habitable 
basement. If the basement be not con- 
structed to be habitable the open space at 
the rear may be entirely built over up to the 
level of the adjoining pavement, and if the 
ground floor be not constructed to be habit- 
able the open space at the rear may be built 
over to a point 16 feet above the street level. 
There is no provision to leave any open 
space for the purpose of drainage, nor is any 
alternative provision made to cut off aerial 
communication between an entirely built-in 
basement and ground floor to 16 feet above 
the pavement and a domestic building erected 
over. One or other provision of this kind is 
desirable for the protection of health. This 



9 2

is especially so in London, as under the new 
Building Acts new buildings are being erected 
on old sites, and enlarged so as to cover the 
whole surface by building over any existing 



FIG. 3.

area at the back up to 16 feet above the 
pavement, any previously existing air-space 
being blocked out, and the two or more lower 
floors being built back-to-back. The whole 
of some street-blocks are being so built in, 



AND HOUSING. 93 

with offices below and dwellings above, and 
with a central well closed at the bottom 
(16 feet above pavement line), which is per- 
mitted provided the width equals half the 
height and the depth exceeds twice the width 
of the well. This is a more restricted light and 
air requirement than the continental system 
of a central courtyard with open porte-cochere. 

The vertical lines adopted for the admission 
of light and air to houses have passed through 
three stages. The first stage is illustrated 
by mediaeval houses, each story projecting 
beyond the story below ; the second by the 
straight fronts and backs of existing streets ; 
and the third by the backs of some more 
recently erected houses, each story receding 
from the line of the story below. 

Lifting the area up 16 feet above the level 
of the street is not allowed to apply to working- 
class dwelling-houses, and as the rear of such 
houses must have a space equal to half the 
height when two blocks of such houses back 
upon each other, the two intervening spaces 
would be of a width equal to the height of 
the buildings, an angle of 45 degrees. But 
these intervening spaces are usually thrown 



94 PUBLIC HEALTH 

into one, and it is difficult to see what there 
is to prevent this space being reduced to half 
its width, with an angle of 63^ degrees only, 
instead of 45 degrees, buildings being erected 
twice the height of the one space in the rear 
used in common. Of course, the careful pro- 
vision of external light and air demands the 
equally careful provision of large windows 
extending up to the ceiling of dwelling-rooms, 
and wherever it can be afforded the fixing 
of ventilating grates in habitable rooms is 
desirable though not essential. 

For the purpose of preventing houses 
being erected too high or sunk too deep, 
Dr. Poore 1 has suggested the provision of 
exclusive open space at ground level equal 
to one-fiftieth of the cubic content of the 
house. The height of houses can be con- 
trolled by the angle of light and air. The 
suggestion would prevent the construction 
of basements, but is this the object to be 
aimed at ? Is it not rather the prevention 
of the habitation of shut-in basements, and 
making provision for them to be cut off from 
aerial communication with the dwelling- 
1 The Dwelling-house. 



AND HOUSING. 95 

houses above ? This is important, because 
in the larger types of building containing 
many dwellings the soil- and drain-pipes 
under the house become practically equiva- 
lent to the sewer draining a street of 
dwellings constructed on the old plan. 

With regard to the surface of the open 
spaces immediately contiguous to dwelling- 
houses, the soil in towns always becomes 
polluted and prejudicial to health. There 
are two ways in which it can be effectually 
dealt with : the one is by cultivation as a 
garden, the other is by impervious paving, 
so levelled and drained as to be readily 
cleansed. As a temporary expedient, the 
surface may be gravelled and rolled, but this 
is not of permanent benefit. Many small 
gardens in town are merely barren wastes, 
and in deciding as to whether a space is a 
garden or yard, the test is whether it is 
regularly cultivated with grass or perma- 
nently paved. It should be definitely pro- 
vided that such spaces should be regularly 
cultivated or permanently paved, instead of 
leaving it to vague by-laws that are difficult, 
if not impossible, to interpret. 



CHAPTER II. 

CLASSES OF DOMESTIC BUILDINGS AND 
DWELLINGS AND THEIR ARRANGEMENT. 

ALTHOUGH in considering construction and 
mis-construction dwellings of the working- 
classes, especially in new blocks of buildings, 
have been kept in view, nevertheless the con- 
ditions and principles discussed also apply, 
as far as they go, to dwellings of the affluent, 
especially those that are being erected in 
increasing numbers in flats of various kinds 
(see Figs. 3, 4, and 5). 

There are three main structural divisions 
of domestic buildings used as family dwelling- 
places : the horizontal, the vertical, and the 
vertico-horizontal. The horizontal house 
presents three types according to size : 
the one-story cottage, the homestead, and 
the bungalow, wholly detached from each 
other. The vertical house, in one or more 
stories, may be regarded as a cottage, a 
villa or a mansion, according to size ; and

according to external relationship to each 
other, such houses are detached, semi- 
detached, and in terrace ; the first with four 
contiguous sides open, the second with three 
contiguous sides open, and the third with 
two opposite sides open. These types of 
houses, when constructed back-to-back, pro- 
duce respectively the semi-detached, the four- 
group, and the true back-to-back house, the 
first having three contiguous sides free, the 
second two adjacent sides, and the third only 
one side open (see Fig. 4, a) . So that in the 
four-group type of house with two adjacent 
open sides, instead of the ventilation, or 
rather perflation, being " through " or 
squarely across the building it is " diagonal " 
or obliquely across, and in the true back-to- 
back type of house with only one open face, 
there is neither " diagonal," " through," or 
" cross " ventilation or perflation of any 
kind. This characteristic of having only 
one open face is not confined to houses 
built back-to-back, but is common to all 
houses built in terraces with the rear-front 
closed in on account of abutting on other 
property over which there is no right of light 



AND HOUSING. 99 

and air, and hence houses have come to be 
distinguished as " through houses," and not 
as through-ventilated (or rather perflated) 
houses. A street-block of back-to-back 
houses may be improved by demolishing 
every third pair of houses, and so converting 
them into four-group houses with side yards. 
The vertico -horizontal house essentially con- 
sists of horizontal dwellings superimposed 
upon one another, and approached by a 
common staircase and entry. This com- 
pound type of house may also be constructed, 
with regard to others, detached, semi- 
detached, or in terrace. Such houses may 
also be constructed in four-group, or back- 
to-back, by means of internal staircases and 
corridors running through the centre, as seen 
in some of the earlier tenement houses 
erected in New York. 1 It is obvious that in 
the compound vertico-horizontal type of house 
the four-group and back-to-back arrangement 
prevents perflation even more than in the 
simpler and smaller types of domestic

buildings. Although such glaring back-to- 
back style of building in the vertico- 
horizontal house becomes almost self-pro- 
hibitive, this type of house enables much 
more complicated methods of construction 
to be adopted with the view of economising 
space while ignoring health requirements. 
If the constituent dwellings in such houses 
are prolonged sufficiently far laterally they 
may be made to extend round two, three, or 
four sides of a hollow square or rectangular 
court, and when these hollow squares are 
placed side by side and back to back there 
is reproduced on a much larger scale, not 
four-group and back-to-back houses, but 
four-group and back-to-back blocks of 
houses. The same effect is produced when 
one or more of the sides of the internal court 
are occupied by the blank walls of adjoining 
buildings. This style of building back-to- 
back blocks is met with in continental towns, 
especially the larger French cities, and is 
figured in one well-known work 1 amongst 
types of Parisian working-class dwellings

(and next to it is figured a four-group block). 
There is no porte-cochere or gateway to the 
internal court, which somewhat mitigates 
the condition of some of the courtyards of 
Parisian blocks of dwellings or flats of this 
type, although it procures little or no perfla- 
tion to the dwelling-rooms overlooking the 
courtyards. 

Internal enclosed courts are now required 
by the Building Act in London to be provided 
with communication into the outer air at the 
lower end when they have the windows of 
habitable rooms opening into them and the 
height of the court is greater than the length 
or breadth ; and a court open on one side, 
the depth of which exceeds twice the width, 
cannot have the window of a habitable room 
opening into it lower than half the height of 
the building. The pectinated form of build- 
ing is modified to more reasonable dimen- 
sions by this last provision, but constructive 
ingenuity cuts it very fine, as seen in some 
recently-erected buildings (Fig. 6). 

These compound domestic buildings lend 
themselves to another complication (see 
7)- The dwellings may themselves

be so arranged as to form semi-detached 
four-group and back-to-back dwellings. The

type of the semi-detached dwellings are 
dwellings of two rooms, one room on each 
front, and one dwelling on each side of an 



104 PUBLIC HEALTH 

open staircase on each floor. This, although 
a healthful, is not an economical method of 
building, and is seldom adopted. The type 
of the four-group dwellings may be found in 
London constructed in the simplest form by 
placing four single or four two-room dwell- 
ings side by side and back to back, the 
dwellings being approached by an open 
staircase with four dwellings on each floor, 
and although the open staircase is beneficial 
the grouping is not, especially in the case of 
the inner room in the two-room dwellings. 
The type of the back-to-back dwelling is 
found wherever there is a central wall or 
partition separating the front rooms from the 
back rooms. This separation ought to 
be absolutely prohibited by law. If, for 
instance, in the last-mentioned example the 
rooms of the front two-room dwelling were 
made to open into the rooms of the back 
two-room dwelling, there would be a four- 
room dwelling with through perflation of 
the rooms and the staircase. But not 
only is the perflation of the rooms stopped 
by cutting off the front rooms from the 
back rooms, but also the perflation of the

The cutting off of the front rooms from the

tion that I know of, which was only erected 
a few years ago, there are four four-room 
dwellings on each floor, an odd room being 
added to one of the front dwellings ; the 
rooms in each of these dwellings lead one 
into the other, and are all situated on the 
same front of the building, so that there is 
absolutely no perflation. When it is added 
that the building faces north and south, it 
will be readily understood that the dwellings 
on the north face not only have no perflation, 
but never see the sun. Outside balconies 
on the front and rear face of these compound 
buildings enable the back-to-back method of 
construction to be adopted to an unlimited 
extent. 

Internal common staircases in compound 
dwelling-houses, by want of ventilation, are 



AND HOUSING. 107 

prejudicial to health, as they render the 
contained air common to all the dwellings 
opening upon them. It is essential that a 
common stairway should be external or 
against an outer wall, and be amply venti- 
lated at each floor level by permanent open- 
ings. The insertion of windows may secure 
light, but does not necessarily secure air. 
The common stairs in artisans' dwellings are 
usually constructed not more than three and 
a half to four feet wide. 

It must be borne in mind that a " flat," in 
all cases in which the rooms are entered 
directly from the common stair, or in which 
the vestibule, lobby, or corridor is not venti- 
lated directly from the outer air, is essentially 
one large space divided into smaller spaces, 
compartments, or rooms, and the air-supply 
is common to all, as there is no ventilated 
staircase open to each room as in an ordinary 
house. If there be a corridor in the dwelling 
it may be found of an I, L or T shape, single 
or double, according to the number of rooms, 
and the placing of hinged fan-lights over the 
doors of the several rooms or compartments 
does not procure the ventilation of the 



io8 PUBLIC HEALTH 

corridor into the open air. The fixing of a 
hinged fan-light, or of a permanent open 
louvre, over the outer door upon the common 
stair, when the common stair is closed by 
windows and doors, merely places the air of 
each dwelling, by means of the common 
stair, in communication with the air of all 
the other dwellings in the building. The 
windows and doors of common stairs are 
rarely left open except in the height of 
summer. This inter-communication of air- 
supply is a condition that also prevails in an 
ordinary tenement house intended for a 
single family, but sublet in separate dwell- 
ings, with one or more families on every 
floor, and upon which the comment of 
sanitarians has not been sparing. 

In a domestic building containing separate 
dwellings, the outer door of a dwelling is 
practically a street door, and with strangers 
passing to and fro should be kept closed for 
the sake of safety, respectability, and privacy. 
A hinged fan-light over the outer door, with 
a closed common staircase, becomes the 
means of exchange of air common to all 
the dwellings, but even if the staircase be 



AND HOUSING. 109 

permanently open to the air on one or more 
sides, a fan-light over a door opening directly 
into a dwelling-room sacrifices privacy of 
conversation and sound, which can only be 
obtained by interposing a lobby, into which 
the rooms open by doors. Therefore, in 
regard to separate dwellings in a building 
the outer doors of the dwellings cannot be 
assumed a means of ventilation, and fan- 
lights over or windows at the side can only 
be assumed to be satisfactory when they 
open from a permanently open staircase into 
a lobby of the dwelling, and not directly into 
a dwelling-room. 

If instead of outside balconies at the sides 
of a building, as shown in the last diagram, 
the means of approach is by an internal 
corridor along the centre, with rooms on 
both sides, undesirable conditions are also 
produced. An internal corridor leads to 
darkness ; if at intervals some of the rooms 
on one side are omitted and glazed windows 
inserted in their stead there remains an 
unperflated horizontal cul-de-sac, upon which 
the main doors of the dwellings open ; if the 
windows are unglazed and the spaces left 



no PUBLIC HEALTH 

open to the air there still remains the absence 
of through ventilation or perflation of the 
dwellings the rooms of which are all on the 
same face of the building. The outer or 
main door, which is practically the street 
door, of a dwelling cannot be regarded as a 
means of through ventilation, and the main- 
tenance of the privacy of dwellings cannot 
be too strongly insisted upon. In a block of 
dwellings in which everything but the rooms 
are used in association, it would be intoler- 
able to any decent-minded family to have 
also the privacy of their dwelling-rooms 
destroyed by the necessity for through ventila- 
tion. Home life in our working-class families 
would disappear under such conditions. 

In new buildings the Local Government 
Board wisely insist upon lobbies between 
water-closets and dwellings being ventilated 
by permanent openings into the outer air, 
and upon common staircases being similarly 
ventilated, but the London County Council 
state l that they have provided windows 
and, it may be added, doors to the lobbies

Council, 1900, p. 50. 



AND HOUSING. in 

and staircases in such buildings, because of 
the unsightly way tenants attempt to block 
the openings. Section 60 of the London 
Building Act, 1894, provides that in every 
building constructed or adapted to be occu- 
pied in separate tenements by more than 
two families the principal staircase used by 
the several families in common shall be 
ventilated upon every story above the 
ground story by means of windows or sky- 
lights opening directly into the external air, 
or shall be otherwise adequately ventilated. 
This is a non sequitur. Such a provision over- 
looks the fact that a glazed window is a 
means for the admission of light, but is not 
necessarily a means of ventilation. My 
experience is that windows of common stairs 
are never opened except in the height of 
summer, and such a provision is illogical 
when the object in view is to provide a per- 
manent form of ventilation to prevent the 
air-supply of a building from becoming 
common to a number of different families. 
Continuous ventilation by means of perma- 
nent openings is the only method of con- 
struction of permanent value, and the reason 



ii2 PUBLIC HEALTH 

is obvious. The windows will only be opened 
when those affected are all agreed upon it, 
and common experience shows how little 
possible it is to agree upon such a point. 
This is also a reason for providing that 
through ventilation shall be obtainable within 
the dwelling, without necessarily being alto- 
gether dependent upon the common staircase, 
even when it is permanently open on one 
side to the outer air. 

In order to provide for through ventilation, 
and against back-to-back dwellings, I have 
on various occasions insisted that one of the 
conditions of construction must be that in 
every dwelling of more than one room the 
alternate rooms must be situated upon 
opposite sides of the building in such a 
manner as to secure perflation from opposite 
fronts. l Examples of the non-observance 
of this condition are to be found in numbers 
of buildings in London, and even in some of 
the later buildings erected by the London 
County Council. The answer to this that 
might be advanced namely, that the open 
staircase is intended to provide the perflation

The sign resembling S indicates doorways. To explain 
this diagram it must be premised that in a building 
two rooms deep with dwellings let in single rooms 
it would be impossible to have the window of a 
single room opening on to both fronts of the building, 
and so the principle of through ventilation for single 
or odd rooms cannot be made to apply. The 
diagram therefore shows two (II.). three (III.). an d 
four (IV.) room dwellings (horizontally) in two 
stages, A and B (vertically). 

P.H. I 



ii4 PUBLIC HEALTH 

is cut away by the fact that the Council 
have admitted that they now enclose them, 
but even if they did not enclose them, in the 
case of dwellings without opposite windows, 
to obtain perflation the doors of the dwell- 
ings must be left open, a most undesirable 
practice in a building full of dwellings with 
strangers passing to and fro. 

The above proposal is illustrated in the 
diagram (Fig. 8). The A column shows a 
two-, three-, and four-roomed dwelling con- 
structed respectively with only one entrance 
and back-to-back. The B column shows 
the application of the requirement that every 
dwelling of two or three rooms should have 
one of the rooms situated on the opposite 
front of the building on which the other 
room or rooms are situated, and every 
dwelling of four rooms two of such rooms. 

With reference to the size of rooms in 
new buildings the London County Council 
have adopted a minimum of 96 square feet 
for bedrooms and 144 square feet for living 
rooms, and the latter may be taken as a 
maximum, with a minimum height of eight 
and a half feet. It is a mistake to make 



AND HOUSING. 115 

large rooms for the poorer classes, as it leads 
to overcrowding, the placing of more beds 
into the rooms, and the mixing of the sexes. 
If the same sized family that can live in one 
very large room live in two smaller rooms 
they are housed under better conditions of 
aeration, decency, and physical well-being. 
It is important, also, to remember that 
raising the age at which children remain at 
school, and at which they can commence to 
work in factories, tends to keep them at 
home with their parents, without earning 
anything towards enlarging the dwelling by 
another room. 

In_domestic buildings in which the separate 
dwellings are approached by a common stair 
or passage-way, there being no staircase- 
wells within such dwellings, it should be 
prohibited to construct any room intended 
for habitation without an open fireplace, a 
window openable into the outer air, and a 
closable doorway. Such provision would go 
far towards defining a habitable room, the 
definition of which at census time greatly 
puzzles the Registrar-General. The German 
census of 1885 classified dwelling-rooms into 

I 2 



n6 PUBLIC HEALTH 

those with fireplaces (heizbar) and those 
without, and it was found that the latter 
were comparatively few, and that in Berlin 
of 304,926 dwellings of less than five rooms, 
all the rooms in no less than 220,424 dwell- 
ings were heatable. A further advantage of 
this provision would be that such a room, if 
intended or used as a bedroom, would require 
a floor space of such area and shape as to 
admit a bed for an adult with sufficient space 
for access thereto, and for distance from the 
fireplace, and could not be constructed below 
a minimum size which would be greater than 
the average maximum size of a scullery and 
washhouse in an artisan's dwelling. This 
is not put forward as the desirable minimum 
size of dwelling-rooms but as an indirect 
means of making some attempt to prevent 
the erection of mere cupboards as rooms for 
living and sleeping purposes. 

The minimum number of rooms in dwell- 
ings for the poorer classes is a subject 1 upon 
which I entered fully at the Birmingham 
Health Congress, and pointed out that the

of the Sanitary Institute, 1899, vol. xx.

differences of sex and age are important 
factors that render family life impossible in 
a single room, and that in Glasgow Dr. 
J. B. Russell had shown that between 1871 
and 1891 the persons living in one room 
fell from 30*4 per cent, to 18*0 per cent, of 
the total population, whereas those living 
in two- and three-room dwellings rose 
exactly in the same proportion as those 
in the one room had fallen namely, from 
54-7 per cent, to 67*2 per cent, of the 
total population.

In constructing dwellings for working- 
class families, if the rooms are too few there 



ii8 PUBLIC HEALTH AND HOUSING. 

will be overcrowding ; if too many they will 
be sublet. The least danger lies in building 
for medium-sized families, the number of 
dwelling-rooms not being less than two, 
and limited to four on the score of expense, 
remembering that there are practically three 
sexes to provide for the married, the boys, 
and the girls. Single men and single women, 
and childless married couples have much less 
difficulty in rinding dwelling accommodation, 
and provision is also made for them in special 
classes of buildings. 



CHAPTER III. 

DOMESTIC AND SANITARY CONVENIENCES. 

DOMESTIC and sanitary conveniences pro- 
vide, in proximity to the dwelling, for the 
supply of fresh water, the removal of soiled 
water and of excreta, and the temporary 
storage of refuse. The supply of water in 
its simplest form implies a draw-tap and drip 
sink ; this enlarged becomes a wash-sink, 
and elaborated is enclosed in a scullery ; this 
again by the addition of a copper becomes a 
scullery and washhouse. The draw-tap and 
sink are a mere matter of plumbing, and 
may be placed anywhere convenient, but the 
scullery is a matter of construction and 
greater expense. Hence, according to the 
class of dwelling, it is found that the domestic 
water-supply may assume any of the above 
forms, and may be without or within the 
dwelling, and may be in common or in sole 
use. A few general principles can be 
evolved from the various methods adopted. 



i 2 o PUBLIC HEALTH 

Draw-taps in common use are found placed 
on balconies, in lobbies, on staircases, in scul- 
leries, and occasionally in water-closets the 
last is a very objectionable situation. In 
sole use they are found, in addition to the 
above, in the dwelling-room or in a scullery 
attached. The essential points to insist upon 
appear to be that in houses of flats there 
should be water-supply on each floor ; that 
when the appliances are used in common 
they should not be overcrowded by users, but 
that separate provision should be made for 
at least every two dwellings or families, and 
that the supply should be either within 
the precincts of the dwelling or situated 
as closely as possible to the dwelling. When 
economy will not permit of sculleries or of 
sculleries of sufficient size or so constructed 
as to admit of washing coppers, it is usual 
to provide a common washhouse, either for 
the whole house or for a block of houses, or 
for several blocks of houses ; on the last 
scale they practically become public wash- 
houses, to which hot and cold baths may be 
attached, the privacy with each step being 
diminished. One form of provision for 



AND HOUSING. 121 

washing found occasionally in working-class 
dwellings is very objectionable namely, the 
placing of portable coppers in enclosed spaces 
without windows or other possible opening 
into the outer air ; this opening should be a 
sine qua non, and the steam vapours should 
also be shut off from the interior of the 
dwelling. 

" Common " washhouses have not proved 
so successful as was anticipated, the reasons 
being, firstly, that as they are usually build- 
ings of some size, they are situated at some 
little distance from the dwellings, especially 
those on the upper floors, and are generally 
in the courtyard at ground level ; secondly, 
that mothers are disinclined to leave their 
young children in their dwellings and spend 
a large part of the day in a common wash- 
house at a distance ; and, thirdly, that women 
are disinclined to wash their own dirty linen 
more or less in public. " Associated " wash- 
houses, or washhouses of a single type 
allotted on particular days to the private 
usage of each particular family, have proved 
more successful, especially when situated 
on the same floor and staircase as the 



122 PUBLIC HEALTH 

dwellings they serve, and when the mothers 
can take their children with them and keep 
them under observation. 

With reference to water-closets, economy 
also dictates whether the construction of the 
dwellings shall be such as to include the 
water-closet within its precincts or exclude 
it, and whether it shall be in sole or common 
usage. By by-law now applicable to all 
houses in London, one water-closet must be 
provided for every twelve persons, and it is 
generally so arranged to provide the neces- 
sary water-closets on each floor in new flats, 
but it is not compulsory, although it should 
be so. They must also now in all houses be 
constructed against an outer wall, and each 
be ventilated by a window and an air-brick 
or air-shaft into the open air. It is also pro- 
vided that a water-closet must not be 
constructed so that it is approached directly 
from any room used for human habitation or 
as a work-place, or for preparing or storing 
food. This ought not to be interpreted that 
by merely multiplying the number of doors 
the object of aerial disconnection is neces- 
sarily attained. The intention is evidently 



AND HOUSING. 123 

disconnection by a ventilated lobby or stair- 
case, so as to avoid the common condition of 
ventilating a house through the w.c. (this 
often being the only place where a permanent 
opening is left), a condition that becomes 
more serious in a flat. In the regulations 
as to the designing of new working-class 
dwellings approved by the London County 
Council on December 3rd, 1889, it was pro- 
vided that the doors of water-closets should 
open directly into the open air, and this was 
conveniently arranged by means of open 
lobbies ; but now this precaution is no longer 
taken, and many water-closets open on to 
enclosed common staircases. It should be 
one of the essential points in houses con- 
structed in flats that the water-closets should 
be cut off by open lobbies, the open lobby 
being utilised also as a place of deposit for 
the dust receptacle and any offensive matter. 
The Local Government Board in new build- 
ings insist upon lobbies between water-closets 
and dwellings being permanently ventilated 
into the open air, and it is to be regretted 
that the London County Council should fill 
these openings in. 



124 PUBLIC HEALTH 

The London County Council has done so 
much good work in the construction of 
working-class dwellings that it might appear 
captious to take exception to certain points 
in the arrangements of some of them, were 
it not that every detail becomes of increasing 
importance with the increase in the size of 
domestic buildings and in the number of 
human beings which they house, and that 
the Council's buildings may be taken as 
models by many of the bodies that have 
constructed artisans' dwellings, many of 
which do not come up to the healthy stan- 
dard set by the Council, and to which all the 
critical comments that have been made apply 
with much greater force in many instances. 

The storage of refuse is a great difficulty, 
and it is to be regretted that it is not com- 
pulsory to provide a modicum of open space, 
lobby, or balcony on each floor level of 
dwelling-houses constructed in flats as a 
place of deposit for the dust receptacle and 
any offensive refuse as well as a means of 
access to the water-closet. The dust recep- 
tacle requires to be simply a portable metal 
bin. Dust shoots as a means of transferring 



AND HOUSING. 125 

the contents of individual bins into the 
common dustbin are condemned as abomi- 
nations. For the dustmen to fetch bins 
from each of the many dwellings, in large 
houses several stories high, and to empty 
them directly into the vans, is impracticable 
on a large scale. It remains, therefore, for 
the occupier to empty at night or morning 
the private bin into the common bin or bins 
either by hand, or, in better-class houses, by 
hand-lift. By means of duplicate bins, the 
common bin and any transfer of refuse can 
be dispensed with. It is indispensable that 
the public collection of refuse should be made 
daily from houses constructed in flats. 

The constructive conditions of water- 
supply and drainage of houses are governed 
by statutes, by-laws, and regulations that 
need not here be detailed. 

For London these are as to water supply, Public 
Health (London) Act, 1891, sec. 48, sec. 2 (i), 
sec. 4 (3), Sch. I., Metropolis Water Act, 1871, sec. 33 
and Regulations thereunder, and By-laws under the 
Public Health (London) Act, 1891, sec. 392 as to 
drainage, By-laws under Public Health (London) 
Act, 1891, sec. 16 (2), sec. 39 (i), and under Metropolis 
Local Management Act, 1855, sec. 202. 



CHAPTER IV. 

ECONOMIES PRACTISED. 

IT is in the power of anyone to design and 
erect buildings, and the economies practised 
in designing dwellings may be briefly 
summarised as : Diminishing the width, 
increasing the length, and lowering the 
height of rooms, extending the number of 
rooms of a dwelling along one front, reducing 
the number and size or abolishing the open 
lobbies, reducing the number and size of the 
sculleries and washhouses, or providing none, 
reducing the number of water-closets and 
wedging them in, increasing the number of 
stories vertically and increasing their exten- 
sion laterally, multiplying the number of 
dwellings on each floor by means of central 
walls, corridors, and balconies, and increasing 
the height, depth, and breadth of the houses. 
Excess in these directions will require more 
regulation and control in the future type 
than has been exercised in the past type of 



PUBLIC HEALTH AND HOUSING. 127 

house, as the effects of unhealthy conditions 
will be multiplied in proportion to the increase 
in size of the buildings and in the number of 
inmates. 

The economies of usage, the overcrowding 
of rooms, dwellings, houses, domestic con- 
veniences, and sanitary appliances, and the 
subletting and subdividing of houses and 
dwellings will also require more supervision 
to prevent deterioration. 

Attention may be directed to the fact that 
construction and usage are more or less 
distinct from each other, and that whereas 
construction is permanent, usage may be altered 
at any moment. In London, under section 
211 of the Building Act of 1894, the con- 
version of dwelling-houses, dwellings, and 
dwelling-rooms from or to certain other uses 
cannot be made without alteration in 
conformity with the Act. 

The resident superintendent, or caretaker, 
in " flats " is a great protection to dwellings, 
whether occupied by the richer or by the 
poorer classes. In working-class dwellings 
he selects the tenants, keeps the more unruly 
elements under control, and the rents paid 



128 PUBLIC HEALTH 

up without entangling arrears ; he keeps the 
parts used in common in repair and cleansed, 
and sees that those parts used separately are 
kept cleansed and in order. He also per- 
forms the function of keeping out intruders 
from the common courtyard or common 
staircase, a great protection to the dwellings 
and the occupants. In Scotland the common 
stair is generally protected by a door with a 
special lock, to which each tenant has a key. 
On the continent large houses built round 
courtyards with porte-cocheres generally have 
a concierge's lodge at the entrance, and houses 
not so built are generally entered through 
the concierge's quarters. These forms of pro- 
tection are generally absent in the sublet 
tenement houses of London, to the dis- 
advantage of both owners and occupiers 
a doubtful economy. 

The economies formerly practised by 
jerry builders in regard to materials, 
windows, safety, and stability of structure, 
are now largely under statutory control and 
supervision. 



CHAPTER V. 

CERTIFICATES AS TO NEW DWELLINGS. 

IN the metropolis a house newly erected 
or rebuilt cannot be occupied as a dwelling- 
house until the sanitary authority have 
certified that it has a proper and sufficient 
supply of water. No similar certificate is 
required as to the drainage, but by statute 
it must be laid as the sanitary authority 
order, and under their control and super- 
vision, and sanitary conveniences must 
comply with the by-laws. There is no 
reason why a certificate should not also 
be required as to the drainage. 

By the Customs and Inland Revenue Act, 
1890, section 26, the assessment to inhabited 
house duty of any house originally built, or 
adapted by additional alterations, and used 
for the sole purpose of providing separate 
dwellings for persons at rents not exceeding 
for each dwelling the rate of 75. 6d. per 
week, and occupied only by persons paying 

P.H. K 



I 3 o PUBLIC HEALTH 

such rents, shall be discharged by the com- 
missioners, provided that a certificate of the 
medical officer of health of the district in 
which the house is situated shall be pro- 
duced to them to the effect that the house 
is so constructed as to afford suitable 
accommodation for each of the families or 
persons inhabiting it and that due provision 
is made for sanitary requirements. The 
medical officer of health of a district, on 
request by the person who would be liable 
to pay the house-duty on any house in the 
district if the duty were not discharged as 
aforesaid, shall examine the house for the 
purpose of ascertaining whether such cer- 
tificate can properly be given, and if the 
house be constructed so as to afford such 
accommodation and due provision be made 
as aforesaid, shall certify the same accord- 
ingly. And by the Customs and Inland 
Revenue Act, 1891, section 4, sub-section 2 
of section 26 of the Customs and Inland 
Revenue Act, 1890, is amended by the sub- 
stitution of the words "where the annual value 
of each dwelling shall not amount to twenty 
pounds " for the words " for persons at rents 



AND HOUSING. 131 

not exceeding for each dwelling the rate of 
75. 6d. a week and occupied only by persons 
paying such rents." In the case of any 
house originally built or adapted by additions 
or alterations and used, so far as the same 
is used as a dwelling-house, for the sole 
purpose of providing separate dwellings at 
an annual value not exceeding 40 for each 
dwelling, the commissioners shall, upon the 
production of such a certificate as is men- 
tioned, grant relief by confining the assess- 
ment to the annual value of the house 
exclusive of every dwelling therein of an 
annual value below 20 (if any) and by 
reducing the rate of duty to 3^. The pro- 
visions of the sub-section in relation to a 
certificate apply to a certificate to be pro- 
duced under this section. This certificate 
refers to construction and fitting, and the 
medical officer of health must be guided not 
only by medical and statistical experience 
but also must have some knowledge of the 
construction of buildings, especially from 
the point of view of design and arrangement, 
so as to be able to form a reasonable opinion. 
It will be observed that the certificate is to 

K 2 



i 3 2 PUBLIC HEALTH 

be given after the building has been erected 
and occupied, and that there is no proviso 
for the medical officer of health to peruse 
the plans of proposed buildings before this, 
much to the disadvantage of the owner, as 
he may be refused a certificate which some 
modification at the proper time might have 
justified. I have pointed out that it is a 
most expansive and comprehensive certificate 
if the words of the Act are used only, 1 but 
the certificate should be framed in such a 
form as to define clearly the points to which 
it refers and how they are provided for. 

In new buildings " originally built" to be 
occupied in separate dwellings the minimum 
requirements should be : (i) that the build- 
ings are constructed in conformity with the 
building Acts and by-laws, especially as to 
damp courses, dry areas, concreted base- 
ments, &c. ; (2) that the water-supply is in 
conformity with the by-laws and regulations; 
(3) that the drainage is in accordance with 
the by-laws and regulations; (4) that the

Houses, Journal of the Sanitary Institute, vol. xix.,

common staircase is permanently ventilated 
at each floor level or by through ventilation 
so as to break the common air-connection ; 
(5) that each dwelling is so arranged as 
to be through ventilated from one front 
to another ; (6) that each of the habitable 
rooms is at least eight feet six inches 
in height and 96 square feet in area, and 
has a fireplace and chimney-flue ; (7) that 
there is at least one draw-tap and sink, 
with a constant supply of water thereto, for 
every twelve occupants or less on each floor ; 
(8) that there is at least one water-closet, 
properly and efficiently supplied with water, 
for every twelve occupants or less on each 
floor, disconnected aerially from any dwelling 
in the interior of the building ; (9) that on 
each floor a sufficient space or open lobby 
is provided accessible to and for the use of 
the families on each floor for the deposit of 
refuse, &c. ; and (10) that accommodation 
for clothes-washing is provided sufficient for 
each family to occupy the washhouse and 
appliances one day each week. 

In existing buildings " adapted by addi- 
tional alterations" to be occupied in separate 



i 3 4 PUBLIC HEALTH 

dwellings the minimum structural alterations 
for adaptation should require to be : (i) that 
the common staircase should be amply and 
permanently ventilated into the open air ; 

(2) that the dwellings should be venti- 
lated through from one front to another; 

(3) that the water-supply should be in 
conformity with statute, by-laws, and regu- 
lations ; (4) that there should be a draw-tap 
and sink provided on each floor for every 
twelve persons or less ; (5) that the drainage 
should be in conformity with statute, by- 
laws, and regulations ; (6) that clothes- 
washing accommodation should be provided 
for each family at least one day a week ; 
(7) that there should be water-closet accom- 
modation for every twelve persons or less on 
each floor properly cut off aerially from the 
dwelling ; (8) that there should be an open 
lobby space or balcony on each floor as a 
place of deposit for the dust receptacle and 
offensive refuse. 

I have never been asked to certify any 
existing building " adapted by additional 
alterations," nor have I heard of any such 
request being made elsewhere. It may be 



AND HOUSING. 135 

assumed that the return of inhabited house 
duty is not sufficient inducement to incur the 
expense of alteration. The house-duty is a 
tax from which there are many exemptions ; 
amongst others, houses under 20 a year are 
exempted from payment. The assessments 
are made by local authorities, and for the 
purpose of rates every separate dwelling 
more or less severed from another is assessed 
as a separate " house." These assessments 
are forwarded to the surveyors of taxes, and 
thus many houses containing separate dwell- 
ings are exempted. In addition, all houses 
with outside or open staircases are also 
exempted by the surveyor when the com- 
ponent dwellings come within the rentals 
mentioned in the Act. The number of 
dwellings that require certificates are there- 
fore becoming fewer every year, and with 
the narrowing of the interpretation of the 
word " house " that appears to be taking 
place in legal decisions, they promise at no 
distant date to reach vanishing point. 



PART III. 

USAGE AND MISUSAGE. 
CHAPTER I. 

DWELLINGS CLASSED ACCORDING TO USAGE. 

CONSTRUCTION and misconstruction have 
been mainly touched upon as applying to 
new dwelling-houses ; usage and misusage 
will mainly be considered in reference to old. 
Before doing so, it will be desirable to 
picture dwelling-houses as falling into classes 
according to usage. On the one hand there 
is the ordinary dwelling-house occupied by 
one family or household, and used as one 
dwelling only, and on the other the dwelling- 
house occupied by members of more than 
one family, and a greater or lesser part of 
which is used in common. Of these more 
or less common dwelling-houses there are a 
number of types: i. Those used entirely 
in common e.g., the common shelter and 



PUBLIC HEALTH AND HOUSING. 137 

the common lodging-house. 2. Those used 
all in common except the sleeping-places 
(a) with separate cubicles in corridors e.g., 
Rowton lodging-houses, or poor men's 
hotels, or (b) with separate bedrooms e.g., 
ordinary lodging-houses and hotels, boarding- 
houses, and residential clubs. These types 
of dwelling-houses are furnished, provided 
with service and supplied with food, although 
this may be reduced to the smallest propor- 
tions, and they are variants of the inn or 
hotel, and are invariably under resident 
management and supervision, and duly con- 
trolled as to usage. 

Then come dwelling-houses let in separate 
dwellings, unfurnished, without service and 
without food, and approached by a common 
stair, the dwellings differing in privacy 
according to the degree of structural sever- 
ance and of combined usage of the domestic 
and sanitary conveniences, the types being : 
i. Those containing separate and self- 
contained dwellings, each dwelling having 
but one entrance, and within its precincts at 
least room for sleeping, living, and cooking, 
and a scullery, lobby, and water-closet or 



138 PUBLIC HEALTH 

other conveniences as in self-contained flats. 

2. Those containing separate and self-com- 
plete dwellings, in which part or all of the 
sanitary and domestic conveniences are 
situated outside the dwelling, but on the 
same floor, and are not used in common. 

3. Those containing separate and associated 
dwellings where on each floor either the 
sculleries, lobbies, or water-closets or all the 
domestic and sanitary conveniences are used 
in association by the families on the same 
floor the greater number associated on one 
staircase the greater economy of space, to 
which pressure a limit should be imposed in 
construction. These types are found with 
variants in all kinds of flats, but the next 
type is found in the older houses only. 

4. Those containing dwellings having no 
severance from each other except by occu- 
pation, and where the domestic and sanitary 
conveniences are used in common by all the 
occupants of the house. This last type is, 
of course, at once recognised as that of the 
misusage of the kind of house not intended 
for the purpose of providing separate dwell- 
ings, but which the pressure of population 



AND HOUSING. 139 

has forced into that service without any 
alteration to meet the changed usage. And 
here it is desirable to trace briefly the causes 
and effects of pressure of population upon 
housing, and some remedies that have been 
suggested. 



CHAPTER II. 

PRESSURE OF POPULATION AND OVER- 
CROWDING. 

IN considering the question of overcrowd- 
ing and housing there are certain lines that 
should be followed if logical conclusions are 
to be reached to diagnose the disease and to 
trace the causes, to lay bare the effects of 
the malady and the natural processes of 
recovery, to suggest remedies most assisting 
to natural events, and to remove any im- 
pediments to the return of equilibrium. 

It must be borne in mind that overcrowding 
of population implies not merely the over- 
crowding of cubic space in rooms, but also 
the diminution in the number of rooms in 
dwellings, and the increase in the number 
of dwellings in houses, the results of which 
are the production of overcrowding of the 
domestic and sanitary conveniences, and the 
rapid deterioration educationally in the habits 
and customs of tenement dwellers, and the 



PUBLIC HEALTH AND HOUSING. 141 

ultimate deterioration of health, especially of 
the health of the children. 

Briefly put, the malady is extreme pressure 
of population in certain areas of great towns, 
especially of the metropolis, the part most 
affected being the middle zone, where the 
stream flowing in from the country meets 
the stream driven out from the centre. The 
extension of commercial and professional 
activity in the centre is the cause that sets in 
motion both streams, by bringing more and 
more workers to the centre and displacing 
more and more dwelling accommodation 
round the centre, so that both the displaced 
population and the newer comers compete for 
housing accommodation with those already 
residing in the middle zone. The effects are 
that the destitute are driven into the work- 
houses, the dissolute and the necessitous 
into the badly built, decaying, and out-of- 
date areas, and the respectable workers into 
tenements or rooms in dwelling-houses or 
parts of dwelling-houses from which the 
former better-class occupants have been 
driven farther out. Equilibrium has been 
restored in the past by the construction 



i 4 2 PUBLIC HEALTH 

from time to time of additional dwelling- 
houses further and further out and the 
gradual improvement of means of transport, 
the largest proportion of those migrating to 
the suburbs belonging to the more comfort- 
able and prosperous classes. There is no 
reason to suppose that this is not the mode 
in which equilibrium will ultimately again 
assert itself. But the process is slow and 
may be quickened by improved transport, 
by additional buildings^ in the outer zone, 
and in the middle zone by the reconstruc- 
tion of the worst of the existing houses in 
healthy flats, and the adaptation into flats 
of the floors of the best of the remaining 
dwelling-houses . 

There is an idea prevalent that if in an 
old area in a city so many thousand persons 
require decent dwelling accommodation it is 
only necessary to erect so many thousand 
houses on a new area in the country and to 
supply means of transportation, and the 
transfer is effected. But thousands of 
people do not simultaneously put together 
their goods and chattels and straightway 
migrate some miles into the country. No 



AND HOUSING. 143 

such a movement takes place. The improved 
transport is not the means by which the 
overcrowded population of an internal area 
is removed, but is the medium that prevents 
the new area in the country from being 
isolated and enables those attracted there 
to get to and from the city. The new 
area attracts the best of the population 
nearest to it, and the areas relieved by the 
new area in their turn attract others. A 
movement and a circulation take place 
around the new centre. Additional trans- 
port and additional dwellings in distant 
suburbs will only relieve overcrowding in 
a particular area or zone by slow, distant, 
and indirect effect, and it is difficult to 
understand why there should be any insist- 
ence upon building at a distance classes of 
dwellings that the overcrowded persons for 
whom they are intended will certainly not 
occupy when they are completed. These 
overcrowded persons will get the best accom- 
modation they can secure within reasonable 
distance of their work, and as the pressure 
of population relaxes they will find this 
accommodation in the houses vacated by 



144 PUBLIC HEALTH 

those of a somewhat better class moving 
further away. 

Within the last fifty years London has 
grown yearly at the rate of from 40,000 to 
50,000 persons, this average number being 
about equal to the excess of births over 
deaths ; but a large emigration from London 
is continually taking place, and an equally 
large immigration into London simul- 
taneously goes on. Whether the emigration 
is mainly from the more central parts there 
is no means of ascertaining, but that the 
immigrants settle mainly in the more out- 
lying parts is proved by the census returns, 
which show that the number of persons born 
out of London is larger in the outlying 
districts than in the inlying districts of 
London. 1 This leads to the question 
whether additional building in distant 
suburbs will immediately benefit the immi- 
grants to or the residents in London ? 

It is very reasonably said that the demoli- 
tion and reconstruction of unhealthy houses, 
groups, and areas are no remedies for 

1 See also Map, vol. ii., Labour and Life of the 
People, Charles Booth. 



AND HOUSING. 145 

overcrowding, and it is obvious that they 
cannot be as they do not provide additional 
dwellings. But the necessity for demolition 
and reconstruction is brought to an acute 
stage by overcrowding, the dwellings and 
groups of houses, originally ill-arranged and 
ill-constructed, being soon rendered unfit for 
habitation by the increasing congregation 
and compression of the worser elements of 
the population on an unhealthy area. The 
effect of demolition is not only to destroy 
the houses but also to disperse the worser 
elements amongst the better elements of 
the population. Therefore demolition is a 
remedy for the effects of overcrowding, and 
proper reconstruction should be the means 
of preventing their recurrence, and the effect 
of the process is a circulation and re-arrange- 
ment of population. 

But there remains still to consider the 
large population driven into sublet houses 
unsuited to the usage to which they are put. 
They never were intended to house a number 
of families, and no attempt is made to render 
them fit for this purpose. It is here that 
overcrowding exercises its most deteriorating 

P.H. L 



146 PUBLIC HEALTH AND HOUSING. 

and permanent influence upon the health 
and morals of thousands of children, youths, 
and young persons whilst waiting for the 
erection of new buildings at a distance that 
will not affect their neighbourhood except by 
a back-wash years hence. I am firmly con- 
vinced that the greatest hope of regeneration 
lies in adapting and enlarging the better 
type of tenement houses to the altered usage 
to which they are put, and without an effort 
in this direction, even when the acuteness 
of the overcrowding has been modified, the 
ill-effects will continue to persist. 



CHAPTER III. 

MADE-DOWN TENEMENT HOUSES AND 
TENEMENT DWELLINGS. 

THE tenement house is generally under- 
stood to mean the ordinary vertical dwelling- 
house constructed for the use of one family 
and sublet to the usage of many, and not a 
house constructed in flats. Of such houses 
there are many thousands in London, and 
a family likeness runs through them the 
common passage and staircase and the 
staircase-well with its foul atmosphere 
derived from the rooms opening into it, and 
the dwelling-rooms with their doors ajar, 
destroying all privacy, in the attempt to 
mitigate the smokiness of the chimneys 
within (see Fig. 9). For the major part 
of the year, and especially in the cooler 
weather, with the windows all closed and the 
fires all burning, the atmosphere of the 
whole house becomes one, and as no air 
can enter by the windows or chimneys and 

L 2 



i 4 8

the fire-grates are all extracting, the chim- 
neys as a consequence all smoke, much to 
the surprise and disbelief of the owner, who

previously to subletting the house probably 
lived there himself. He cannot understand 
the competition that is going on amongst 



AND HOUSING. 149 

his increased number of tenants to secure 
as much as possible of the air in the stair- 
case-well, wherever it may be drawn from, 
and that whereas formerly the unlighted 
grates supplied air to the staircase-well 
which was distributed up and down the 
staircase by an upcast and downcast current 
to satisfy the lighted grates, those grates 
being now lighted and becoming also extrac- 
tors the circulation of air in the house is 
destroyed. That this is the case can be 
verified by very simple experiments in any 
house by means of candle flames and 
smouldering paper. The absence of clean- 
liness everywhere, especially on the upper 
floors, and the want of use of soap and water 
are everywhere apparent, and a little deeper 
inquiry leads to the conclusion that water is 
not a commodity to be obtained easily with- 
out going a considerable distance, and that 
to get rid of liquid and solid refuse similar 
long journeys have to be made. In addition 
to the excessive number of dwellings in the 
house there is usually an excessive number 
of persons per room, but it is remarkable 
how closely the occupants keep just outside 



i 5 o PUBLIC HEALTH 

the inadequate minimum of cubic space. 
So that with no illegal overcrowding these 
unhealthy conditions are the normal ones 
under which many thousands are per- 
manently housed, and will continue to be 
so housed whatever new additional building 
takes place in the distant suburbs. The 
superficial observer often heaps abuse upon 
the class occupying such houses for their 
negligent, uncleanly habits, oblivious of the 
fact that the constructive arrangements of 
their dwellings never give the opportunity 
of acquiring decent habits. 

Many years ago the late Dr. Edmund 
Parkes showed that, calculated on a physio- 
logical basis, the human adult required 
1,000 cubic feet of space, because in order 
to maintain the air in a sufficient state of 
average purity in a dwelling-room it was 
necessary to supply 3,000 cubic feet of air 
per hour, and the air in this climate could 
not be changed more often than three times 
per hour. We are continually bemoaning 
the large death-roll of tuberculous phthisis, 
which is, as we have seen, essentially a 
disease spread by crowding and restricted 



AND HOUSING. 151 

air-space, and the medical profession is now 
strongly advocating the cure and mitigation 
of the disease by fresh-air treatment. Is it out 
of place to advocate even more strenuously 
the prevention of the disease by the provi- 
sion of more cubic space, and especially by 
raising the present inadequate minimum 
standard of 300 cubic feet ? The adoption 
of a maximum as a working standard is 
scarcely practicable, but it is practicable to 
advance the minimum standard to 400 cubic 
feet at the very least for adults, and if the 
lauded fresh-air treatment means anything 
it means, firstly, a decided step in this direc- 
tion and a legal definition of overcrowding, 
the omission of which in our Public Health 
Acts is a serious flaw. The benefit of open- 
air treatment of consumption is as much due 
to the removal from the evil effects of indoor 
life as to the improved climatic influences. 

How are local authorities to control new 
buildings as to cubic space occupied after 
they are constructed, since overcrowding is 
not a question of construction ? It can only 
be done on a sufficient scale by a statutory 
definition of overcrowding of cubic space, 



i 5 2 PUBLIC HEALTH 

and nothing short of 400 cubic feet per head 
for adults will be satisfactory, although it 
may reluctantly be reduced to half the 
amount for children under ten years. It is 
essential to practical working that this mini- 
mum standard of cubic space be made to 
apply to all rooms used for sleeping purposes, 
whether occupied also as living rooms or 
not, because it is practically impossible in a 
large number of cases to differentiate, and 
where such differentiation is attempted it 
fails in that it has no permanency. If in 
addition to this any dwelling-room not having 
one or more windows or skylights, equal in 
area at least to one-tenth of the floor area 
and opening into the external air, were also 
defined as a nuisance, prevention of the over- 
crowding and promotion of the ventilation 
of dwelling-rooms would be much facilitated. 
Underground dwellings are mainly to be 
found in tenement houses, where they were 
originally intended to be used as kitchens, 
sculleries, stores, lumber-rooms, or cellars. 
Underground rooms are only subject to 
restrictions when they are let as dwellings 
separately from any other rooms on any 



AND HOUSING. 153 

floors of the house, and when the floor of 
the rooms is more than three feet below the 
surface of the nearest ground. The principal 
disadvantages these rooms suffer from are 
want of light and air and the presence of 
dampness and ground vapours, and the 
restrictions are intended to avoid these. It 
is inscrutable why the legislature has hesi- 
tated to prohibit any basement room from 
being used as a dwelling, however much or 
little the floor may be below the surface, unless 
protected by a concrete base and an external 
area to six inches below the base level with 
ventilation between concrete and flooring. 
Numbers of back basement rooms escape 
the statutory provisions intended to protect 
against damp earth and ground vapours, 
simply because their floors are less than 
three feet below the nearest ground, which 
is generally a diminutive backyard. The 
principal reason for mentioning underground 
dwellings here is to illustrate the fact that 
Parliament has in this instance legislated 
for the dwellings as apart from the houses 
as a whole, and has set a precedent that 
should be followed by legislating for other 



154 PUBLIC HEALTH AND HOUSING. 

dwellings in houses let in separate dwellings, 
and defining their requirements, for at 
present no such definition exists. Whole 
streets of houses formerly occupied by good- 
class families are now occupied in separate 
dwellings on separate floors. Whole neigh- 
bourhoods of houses in London can be seen 
undergoing this process of subdivision, and 
their state slowly but surely falls from bad 
to worse without any attempt to stem the 
deterioration, degradation, and unhealthy 
results that must inevitably follow until an 
insanitary area will have to be dealt with at 
great expense. There are no powers avail- 
able for dealing with the structural arrange- 
ments of separate dwellings, and the only 
course open is the registration of the whole 
of the house under the by-laws. 

There can be no doubt that the want of 
stair ventilation, the difficulties of obtaining 
water, of access to the water-closet, to the 
scullery, and to the washhouse, and of refuse 
riddance, are causes of the ill-health of the 
dwellers in tenement houses, and that the 
unhealthy habits engendered by such condi- 
tions become permanent. 



CHAPTER IV. 

THE REGISTRATION OF TENEMENT HOUSES. 

EVERY sanitary authority must make and 
enforce by-laws for fixing the number of 
persons who may occupy a house, or part 
of a house, which is let in lodgings or 
occupied by members of more than one 
family, and for the separation of the sexes 
in a house so let or occupied ; for the regis- 
tration of houses so let or occupied ; for the 
inspection of such houses ; for enforcing 
drainage for such houses and for promoting 
cleanliness and ventilation in such houses ; 
for the cleansing and lime-washing at stated 
times of the premises ; and for the taking of 
precautions in case of any infectious disease. 
With reference to infectious disease and 
drainage, all houses, including the above, 
must conform to the laws, by-laws, and 
regulations that already sufficiently cover 
that ground. Therefore, there remain with 
regard to tenement houses the provisions for 



156 PUBLIC HEALTH 

registration, inspection, air-space, separation 
of the sexes, ventilation, and for the cleansing 
of parts and of the whole premises. The same 
by-laws apply to a house whether it contains 
two families or a dozen. As far as ventila- 
tion is concerned, the model by-laws of the 
Local Government Board make no structural 
provision, so that the principal use of the 
by-laws is to prevent overcrowding and mix- 
ing of the sexes, and to obtain cleansing. 
The essential point of difference between the 
condition of a house when it contains one 
and when it contains a dozen families is one 
of altered usage with unaltered structure, 
and the by-laws provide for no structural 
alteration ; on the contrary, by registering 
the house the misusage of the premises for 
purposes for which it was not built is 
practically stereotyped and legalised. This 
is remarkable as contrary to the spirit of the 
Building Act, which by section 211 (3) pro- 
hibits the conversion into or use as two or 
more dwelling-houses any building con- 
structed originally as one dwelling-house. 
The unit of legislation has hitherto been the 
house, except in the case of underground 



AND HOUSING. 157 

dwellings. With the altered method of con- 
struction of new dwelling-houses and of 
usage of old houses the house as a unit is 
insufficient to meet the requirements of 
separate dwellings under the existing form 
of laws and by-laws. The unit must be the 
dwelling. This is so obvious a generalisa- 
tion that it would hardly need statement 
but for the fact that it appears to have 
almost entirely escaped the observation 
of the legislature, possibly because the 
floor and flat style of dwelling, one story 
above another, is the growth of recent 
years. 

It may here be mentioned that one of the 
difficulties in framing by-laws for houses let 
in lodgings or separate dwellings is the mode 
of limiting the application to the class of 
houses to be dealt with, this being usually 
accomplished by a limit of rental, which 
varies in different districts. It may be worth 
consideration whether it would not be more 
satisfactory if the limit were the number of 
rooms in the dwellings for instance, these 
by-laws shall apply to houses in which the 
number of dwellings is more than one-half, 



158 PUBLIC HEALTH AND HOUSING. 

one-third, or one-fourth the number of 
habitable rooms in the house as the 
reduction of the number of rooms in 
the dwellings is the cause that leads to 
the closer living in common, and to the 
necessity for applying the by-laws. 



CHAPTER V. 

A COMPARISON OF FLOORS WITH FLATS. 

IF dwellings in floors be compared with 
dwellings in flats there is a great difference 
in the conditions of living. " Flats " we 
understand to be horizontal dwellings with 
all conveniences on the same level ; "floors " 
we understand to be horizontal dwelling- 
rooms with all conveniences on ground or 
basement level. The conveniences embrace 
(i) water-supply for (a) personal ablution, 

(b) cooking and washing up, (c) small wash- 
ing, (d) room washing, and for (e) drinking 
purposes ; (2) drainage for water polluted 
by (a) personal ablution, (b) food washing, 

(c) small washing, (d) washing of rooms, 
(e) bedroom slops, (/) urine, and (g) children's 
excreta ; and (3) refuse removal, including 
food waste, ashes, and sweepings. The 
small washing is often done in a room, but 
the large washing is usually done in the 
washhouse on the premises or at the public 



160 PUBLIC HEALTH 

washhouses or by a laundress. The coal 
fuel is kept either in or in close proximity to 
the dwelling. 

Certain houses that enable exact com- 
parisons to be drawn between the sanitary 
conditions of these two modes of living 
namely, in flats and in floors have come 
under my observation in adjoining streets. 
Both groups were built in 1882-83. For 
convenience the former may be called A, B, 
and C houses in street and the latter 
Nos. 2 to 20 (even numbered) houses in H 
street. Each group contains forty-two dwell- 
ings ; the flats are contained in three houses, 
each consisting of fourteen dwellings of three 
rooms each. The floors are contained in 
ten houses, of which eight consist of a three- 
room and a two-room dwelling each, one of 
a three-room and four two-room dwellings, 
and one of five two-room dwellings. The 
houses are in each group of four stories, the 
" flats " being four on each floor and two on 
an additional half-ground floor at the back. 
In none of the houses of either type is there 
a resident caretaker. The fundamental 
difference between the two groups is that 



AND HOUSING. 161 

whereas in the " flats " all conveniences are 
on the same level, in the " floors " the con- 
veniences are situated in the basement or 
yard, and the question to be asked is, What 
effect has this upon the habits of the 
occupants, especially the occupants of the 
upper floors ? To avoid entering into lengthy 
details two typical cases may be taken to 
exemplify the comparative sanitary con- 
ditions that prevail in the two kinds of 
houses. In the top floor of C house in 
street is a family of husband and wife and 
five children, paying 85. a week for a dwelling 
consisting of a living-room, two bedrooms, a 
scullery and a washhouse, and a water-closet, 
and kept in an orderly and cleanly condition. 
In the top floor of No. 10 house in H street 
is also a family of husband, wife, and four 
children, paying 85. 6d. a week (6d. more) 
for a floor consisting of a living-room and 
two bedrooms. Every drop of clean water 
has to be brought up from the basement and 
every drop of dirty water taken down again. 
The clothes washing is all done in the base- 
ment washhouse. All refuse is thrown into the 
fire-grate and there kept until taken down to 
P.H. M 



162 PUBLIC HEALTH 

the dustbin in the yard. All the members 
of the family, including very young children, 
have to make their way down to the back- 
yard to the water-closet. The tenant did 
not know any of the other families living in 
the house, whether they were respectable or 
not. The condition of the rooms left much 
to be desired, although the mother appeared 
to be an industrious woman and deplored 
the fact that she had been obliged to move 
out of one of the flats in street because 
the house had been devoted to other pur- 
poses. 

There is a vast number of families in 
London living on the top floors of four- 
storied houses, the water-taps, sinks, water- 
closets, and dustbins of which are situated 
at the ground floor or basement, or in the 
yard or area, and these houses are about 
forty feet high. It is usually assumed that 
twenty times more energy is expended in 
walking upstairs a vertical height in com- 
parison to walking on the level ; therefore 
walking to the top of a four-story house is 
equivalent to walking about 800 feet upon 
the level, and, say a cottage measures fifteen 



AND HOUSING. 163 

feet frontage, this is equivalent to walking 
past a row of over fifty-three cottages to reach 
the common sanitary conveniences above- 
mentioned. What would be the opinion of 
a medical officer of health or of the Local 
Government Board if provision were as in- 
adequately made even in a rural district ? 
Yet this is the condition that prevails over a 
large part of London. It is usual to regard 
100 feet horizontally as the limit of " reason- 
able distance " for water and drainage, and 
even the extreme limit of the law does not 
suggest going beyond 200 feet. This is 
equal to five feet and ten feet respectively 
regarded vertically, or one story. How can 
it be said that houses in which some of the 
families have to traverse a distance equivalent 
to i, 600 feet to and fro to draw fresh water, 
another 1,600 feet to and fro to cast foul 
water, i, 600 feet to and fro (every member of 
the family, including very young children) to 
visit the water-closet, and another 1,600 feet 
to and fro to deposit the refuse if it is not 
to be retained in the dwelling-rooms, are 
sufficiently equipped structurally to give the 
occupants an opportunity of leading healthy, 

M 2 



1 64 PUBLIC HEALTH 

cleanly lives ? What chance has a respect- 
able family of observing the decencies of life 
in a house where there are one or two dis- 
solute families, where the domestic and 
sanitary conveniences are all used entirely 
in common, and the members of the respect- 
able family, even the youngest, are continually 
traversing the house to and fro ? If domestic 
and sanitary conveniences are provided on 
each floor, those living on that floor can at 
least cultivate their own good habits in their 
own way. What is wanted is to procure for 
families as much privacy as can be obtained, 
and to reduce the common usage to the 
smallest proportions possible. This is even 
more requisite in tenement houses where 
there is no resident controller than in blocks 
of artisans' dwellings. Numerous streets in 
parts that were suburbs fifty years ago with 
good middle-class houses are now sublet in 
floors. I have watched the conversion of 
whole streets and roads of good houses from 
one occupation into " floor-lettings," and this 
has taken place within recent years and with- 
out the least modification of structure. The 
ultimate effects of this conversion without 



AND HOUSING. 165 

adaptation is disastrous. The leasehold 
system is partly responsible for it, the lease- 
holder naturally getting the best return 
possible, and the freeholder being supine, 
as the demand for housing accommodation 
forces up the value of the land. The ultimate 
result appears never to be considered until 
insanitary conditions throw upon the sanitary 
authority, and especially upon the medical 
officer of health, the unpopular duty of con- 
demnation. This shifting of responsibility 
throws upon the medical officer of health 
the defensive duty of pointing out that he 
is largely required to make bricks without 
straw, because the domestic and sanitary 
requirements of a dwelling, as distinguished 
from a house, are undefined, and the ordinary 
laws as to nuisances do not touch the points 
at issue. 

With the increase in the size of dwelling- 
houses and the increase in the subdivision 
of houses into separate dwellings the urgency 
of legislating on the lines of the dwelling as 
the unit becomes greater and greater, and 
no approach to any satisfactory handling 
of the housing question, at least in the 



1 66 PUBLIC HEALTH 

metropolis, will ever be reached until this 
unit is adopted as a fresh starting basis. 

The by-laws for tenement houses regulate 
the conditions of usage, but regulations are 
also required to control the structure of 
existing houses, when converted from their 
originally intended usage, by some such 
provisions as the following : Permanent 
openings from the outer air into the stair- 
case so as to break the communication of 
air from one dwelling to another and to 
form a reservoir of fresh air in the staircase- 
well, the air in mid-winter being tempered 
by contact with the warmer walls of the 
interior of the house. Permanent openings 
from the staircase-well into the rooms, so as 
to supply air to the fireplaces, prevent the 
chimneys smoking, permit of the doors being 
closed and yet ventilate the rooms, the open- 
ings being so made and protected as to avoid 
destroying privacy as much as possible. The 
supply of fresh water and the withdrawal of 
foul water on each floor, so as to promote 
the use of water and cleansing, and more 
privacy in obtaining it. A washhouse or 
washhouses supplied with water, sink, and 



AND HOUSING. 167 

copper in the basement, yard, or other con- 
venient place, with the right of usage by 
each family one day a week. These are 
fundamentally essential, and it is a question 
of policy whether or not the regulations 
should go further, bearing in mind that 
additions to the structure involve consider- 
able expense, and that, while the above 
might be demanded as fitting in all houses, 
those in which additional construction and 
alteration could be and were made would 
have some claim for pecuniary assistance or 
facilities. This especially refers to the pro- 
vision on each floor of small balconies or 
open lobbies for dust receptacles and of 
w.c.'s, to which also might be added 
sculleries, with or without washhouse coppers, 
and coal-boxes and food-safes. These pro- 
visions will again be referred to under 
" Structural Adaptation " in the next chapter. 
Section 75 of Part IV. of the Housing of 
the Working Classes Act, 1890, provides 
that in letting for habitation to persons of 
the working classes a house, or part of a 
house, there shall be implied that the house 
is at the commencement of the holding 



1 68 PUBLIC HEALTH 

reasonably fit for human habitation. This 
is very vague, and additional provision is 
required somewhat to the following effect : 
" In letting for habitation as a dwelling part 
of a house, there shall be provided a suffi- 
cient and accessible water-supply and wash- 
sink on the same story or adjoining half- 
story as the dwelling or part of the dwelling 
is situated, also sufficient permanent open- 
ings into the outer air to adequately ventilate 
the common staircase, and sufficient openings 
therefrom, properly protected, to adequately 
ventilate the rooms, and also sufficient wash- 
house accommodation ; and in the absence 
of the foregoing it shall be implied that the 
dwelling is not reasonably fit for human 
habitation." Such provision thrown into 
proper legal phraseology and improved 
might partly meet the case. 

It should be remembered that in Conti- 
nental and Scotch cities, where for years the 
flat system has been in vogue, the mode 
of subletting houses in floors improperly 
equipped does not present itself as a serious 
question for them, as on each floor of the 
houses of those cities the appurtenances of 



AND HOUSING. 169 

the dwelling are provided. It is the altered 
conditions in London that furnish this 
serious problem. The reason for the flat 
system on the Continent was because the 
towns were walled cities till recent times, 
and the building space was restricted ; the 
hemming in of London by extensive suburbs 
is producing the same result. 



CHAPTER VI. 

THE STRUCTURAL ADAPTATION OF TENEMENT 
HOUSES. 

IT may be taken that there would be little 
difficulty in making and enforcing provisions 
for ventilating the common stair and the 
rooms and for supplying a draw-tap and 
wash-sink on each floor, and elsewhere an 
associated washhouse. The water companies 
might possibly stand in the way with extra 
demands. It was pointed out by the last 
Royal Commission, in reference to the 
metropolis and neighbourhood, that " the 
requirements of the population are a supply 
of pure and wholesome water, constantly 
laid on, at such a pressure as will make 
the water reach the top story of the 
highest houses, and in quantity sufficient 
from time to time to meet the needs of the 
growing number of inhabitants." 1 Very few

Supply within the Limits of the Metropolitan Water 
Companies, Viscount Llandaff, Chairman, 1899. 



PUBLIC HEALTH AND HOUSING. 171 

made-down tenement houses have water 
supplied anywhere above the ground 
floor, and generally it is in the basement 
only, or sometimes at the end of the 
backyard. 

If monetary assistance were forthcoming 
something more permanent than the mere 
make-shifts above suggested could be re- 
quired of house-owners, and if municipal 
authorities were to undertake to convert 
floors into " flats " the same would apply. 
For the purpose of structural adaptation 
only houses well situated as to light and 
air should be dealt with. It must be 
recognised that a certain proportion of 
houses are not fitted to be adapted, either 
on account of the surroundings, or of the 
internal arrangements, or of the originally 
bad construction, so that it would be 
necessary carefully to select those suited 
to the purpose, but of these there are 
considerable numbers. 

There are three methods in which tene- 
ment houses could be structurally adapted. 
i . The simplest but not the most satisfactory 
manner is by partitioning off a portion of the 



172 PUBLIC HEALTH 

front room opposite the staircase landing on 
each floor to form a scullery and washhouse, 
and on the further side of this to construct 
a water-closet against the outer front wall, 
obtaining through ventilation from the outer 
air in the front to the back of the scullery by 
means of a fanlight on to the common stair- 
case and so into the open air again off the 
staircase at the rear of the house. This 
partitioned off lobby, scullery, and water- 
closet may be made to be entered either 
from the front room of the dwelling for 
private use or from off the staircase for 
common use when there is more than one 
dwelling on a floor. (Fig. IDA.) 2. Probably 
the best method would be by the construction 
of a tower at the back of the house, con- 
taining on each floor an addition containing 
an open lobby, scullery, and water-closet, 
and approached from the back room on each 
floor; this would restrict the addition to 
private use. (Fig. IOB.) 3. If the tower 
were constructed off the staircase then the 
addition on each floor or half floor would be 
available for common usage by the families 
on the adjoining floors. (Fig. ice.) Out 



AND HOUSING. 173 

buildings, towers, or projections abutting at 
right angles to the line of frontage, generally 
the rear front, are objectionable on account 
of the tendency to impede light and air in 
proportion to the distance they advance from 
the main wall and according to orientation. 
On the other hand, there is a great advantage 
in being able to add sanitary conveniences, 
such as water-closet, scullery, &c., and lobby, 
with ventilation between the dwelling and the 
sanitary additions, provided that the projec- 
tions do not advance so far as to close in the 
spaces at the rear or to interfere with the 
perflation of the dwelling. I see no reason 
why a skilful architect should not be able to 
design a tower addition of this kind without 
any appreciable detraction from light and 
air. The sketches show the several methods 
suggested and sections through a tenement 
house unadapted and adapted for separate 
dwellings. (Fig. n and Fig. 12.) 

After working for a long time upon this 
idea of adapting the ordinary tenement 
house so as to render it healthily habitable 
in separate dwellings, I recently found, as 
many before have found, that there had been 



i 7 4 PUBLIC HEALTH 

another worker in the same field. Thirty 
years ago Professor Bannister Fletcher, 
F.R.I.B.A., published a work entitled 
" Model Houses for the Industrial Classes," 
which is now out of print. The work 
contains three designs 1 for model houses, one 
of which there would be great objection to, 
another that would be passable with slight 
improvement, and a third that is decidedly 
good. But the most important part relates 
to the adaptation of existing houses, of 
which two methods are shown by drawings 
namely, the addition of domestic and 
sanitary conveniences on each floor by one 
method placing them in a separate compart- 
ment on the staircase and cut off from the 
front room, by the other method placing 
them in a tower built out at the rear of the 
staircase window. There is also illustrated 
a method of converting three narrow houses 
into two " double flat" houses. This work 
was written with a view to realising increased 
profits from the rentals of adapted houses, 
but as unadapted sublet houses obtain as 

1 There is a fourth, but it is practically the same as 
the third.

high and even a higher rental per room than 
houses constructed in small flats, it is not 
surprising that the object in view was not

attained. Yet the fact remains that struc- 
tural adaptation is undoubtedly the right 
and proper course to pursue in appropriate 



176 PUBLIC HEALTH 

instances, and is the only means of per- 
manently ameliorating the condition of exist- 
ing tenement houses. 

Pari passu with the improvement of exist- 
ing dwelling-houses by structural adaptation 
it would be possible also to increase the 
amount of dwelling accommodation in the 
middle zone of London by erecting another 
story or mansard roof upon many existing 
houses. In this manner housing accommo- 
dation could be increased by a third or a 
fourth in amount in some existing healthy 
areas in more central neighbourhoods. This 
procedure might quickly relieve local crowd- 
ing of population as well as improve the 
conditions of housing. I have also sug- 
gested that owners of large estates in Lon- 
don could bring about a great improvement 
when renewing leases of houses by requiring 
the construction of an extra room at the 
rear of each floor, and require it to be con- 
verted into a place for domestic and sanitary 
conveniences as the house becomes more and 
more sublet by lessees and sub-lessees, they 
undertaking to adapt the structure to the 
altered usage.

The raising of the money for these pur- 
poses by local authorities presents no diffi- 
culty, as under Part III. of the Housing of 
the Working Classes Act, 1890, a local 
authority as well as a private company, 
association, or individual may not only 
build additional houses, but may also con- 
vert any buildings into dwelling-houses for 
the working-classes, and may alter, enlarge, 
repair, and improve the same respectively. 
No effort has hitherto been made to do this. 
The best work that local authorities might 
hope to do would be in showing by example 
how some existing unhealthy tenement 
houses could be converted into healthier 
flats as object lessons, rather than in 
attempting to acquire and improve all such 
houses. Private owners, individually and 
associated, must be depended upon to carry 
out such work, if it is to be done on any 
adequate scale. As to borrowing money for 
the construction of new dwellings, I have 
shown elsewhere 1 that public authorities and 
private companies or individuals have both 

1 Results of Housing the Working Classes, Howard 
Medal Prize Essay, Royal Statistical Society, 1901. 



AND HOUSING. 179 

borrowed nearly equal amounts from the 
Public Works Loans Commissioners for this 
purpose. No money appears to have been 
borrowed for the purposes of adaptation. 
Under Part III. of the Act loans are granted 
to private persons entitled to the land in fee 
simple for an absolute term of more than 
50 years for the purpose of improving dwell- 
ings for the working classes. Landowners 
have no power to deal with the houses on 
their land until the leases expire leasehold 
house-owners only possess this power, 
although even they in many instances are 
not the persons who sublet the houses 
in subdivided tenements. Few leasehold 
house-owners possess houses upon a term 
sufficiently long to satisfy the require- 
ments of the Public Works Loans Commis- 
sioners for borrowing purposes, and most 
leasehold house-owners would object to 
borrowing or spending money to adapt tene- 
ment houses when they can be let without 
alteration. 

The exemption from the inhabited house 
duty offered by the Customs and Inland 
Revenue Acts of 1890 and 1891 under the 

N 2 



i8o PUBLIC HEALTH 

certificate of a medical officer of health to 
owners of houses altered and adapted to be 
let in separate dwellings has not, to my 
knowledge, proved sufficient inducement to 
cause a single owner to move in this 
direction. As has been already pointed 
out, the pressure of sanitary legislation 
in this direction is nil, such legislation 
not yet having taken into account the 
altered circumstances of the last ten or 
twenty years. 

It might be thought that if new blocks 
consisting of houses containing flats of two-, 
three-, and four-roomed dwellings with con- 
veniences attached can be erected and be 
let at the same rent as, and even at less 
rental than, the same number of rooms in 
an existing house subdivided and sublet 
without conveniences attached to the 
separate dwellings, it should be possible to 
adapt many existing houses without neces- 
sarily increasing the rental, and to stem the 
downward progress of deterioration in deco- 
rative and structural condition caused by 
common usage, and at the same time to 
improve the habits and to stimulate the 



AND HOUSING. 181 

self-respect of the inmates, to the mutual 
advantage of landlord and tenant. But one 
has to recall the circumstances in which 
many of the existing blocks of separate 
dwellings were erected in London. The 
Metropolitan Board of Works never built 
on any of the numerous sites cleared by 
them since 1875, but the sites were sold at 
a price much below open market value, 
because the condition was attached to the 
sale that working-class dwellings must be 
erected upon the sites, and the companies 
and individuals who purchased them were 
to that extent practically subsidised. A 
similar course is adopted by the London 
County Council as successors of the Metro- 
politan Board of Works : they build upon 
the sites cleared, but before doing so they 
revalue the sites, with the restriction upon 
them only for the building of working-class 
dwellings, and the difference between the 
open market commercial value and the 
restricted value is wiped off, again practically 
subsidising the dwellings upon the site. 
Furthermore, some bodies that construct 
buildings have been largely endowed by 



i8a PUBLIC HEALTH 

private philanthropy, so that they have no 
interest and no sinking fund instalments to 
pay, and are to that extent also subsidised. 
Therefore it is not to be wondered at that 
well-found flats are let to the working classes 
at the same or a lower rental than bare, 
incommodious floors in tenement houses, 
and that house-owners are deprived of 
whatever inducement, or incentive, or 
desire they may have possessed properly 
to adapt houses made down into tene- 
ments to the altered purposes to which 
they are put. 

At present there would appear to be only 
one way of counteracting the effects of sub- 
sidies or quasi-subsidies upon new buildings, 
and that is by subsidising or otherwise 
assisting pecuniarily the existing owners of 
houses made, or to be made, into tenement 
houses. If local authorities undertook to 
alter and adapt tenement houses they would 
have to purchase them compulsorily with 
10 per cent, added. 

If owners undertook to adapt and improve 
tenement houses so that they might be let 
in separate dwellings in properly equipped 



AND HOUSING. 183 

floors or flats they might be empowered to 
send to the borough councils plans and 
sections of the proposed improvements, to 
be submitted to the surveyor and medical 
officer to report upon. This report would 
embrace the consideration of open space 
about the buildings for external light and 
air, the height of the houses, the condition 
of stability and repair, the mode of construc- 
tion and arrangement, the suitability of the 
premises to adaptation as separate dwellings, 
and the adequacy of the proposed improve- 
ment to convert the floors into healthy flats. 
If the owners' houses and plans be approved 
they might be empowered to make applica- 
tion to the borough council for loans upon 
the property at the lowest possible rate of 
interest with repayment by small instalments 
in a term of years, in a similar manner to 
that in which a landowner obtains a loan 
from the Public Works Loans Commissioners 
for the building of new working-class dwell- 
ings. The conditions upon which the loans 
would be granted would be set out fully as 
to the structural improvements to the pre- 
mises required before completion of the 



184 PUBLIC HEALTH 

payment by the borough council. In addition 
to the benefit of a very low rate of interest 
and a small refunding charge, the certificate 
of medical officers of health would exempt 
the house also from inhabited house duty. 
By some such method owners might be 
induced to adapt their houses to the altered 
requirements in many areas vacated by 
emigrants to the suburbs. If not, then some 
small additional inducement should be offered 
to bring about the necessary equilibrium. 
Otherwise there appears to be a prospect 
that if the number of houses made down by 
usage into floors without structural adapta- 
tion continue largely to increase, the number 
of sanitary inspectors and the amount of 
inspection will require also to be largely 
increased. Judging by the very much less 
inspection required in " flats 1 ' as compared 
with " floor" houses, even where there is no 
resident caretaker, it is not unreasonable to 
expect that the adaptation of the " floors" 
would enable a considerable annual expendi- 
ture to be saved, and that the beneficial 
effect upon health and habits of the people 
so housed would make ample recoupment 



AND HOUSING. 185 

in kind, if not in money, for the expenditure 
incurred in adaptation. In any case it must 
necessarily be in appropriate instances a less 
costly procedure than entirely demolishing 
the houses and reconstructing them. 



PART IV. 

A BRIEF REVIEW OF THE HOUSING 
QUESTION. 

OUR ideas must be cleared of the confusion 
between the march of two cognate but dis- 
tinct events. The first is the increased 
pressure whereby the population overflows 
existing houses, and the second is the in- 
creased subletting of dwelling-houses, not 
adapted to such treatment, with consequent 
increase in dilapidation of the houses and 
deterioration of the health of the inmates, 
whereby in some localities insanitary areas 
and in others unhealthy tenement streets 
are created. The remedy for the first is 
relief of the pressure by improvement in 
transit, by additional construction in the 
outer suburbs on vacant land, by enlarged 
construction on insufficiently utilised land in 
the inner suburbs, and by the addition of a 
story or stories to suitable existing houses 
in the inner zones. The remedy for the 



PUBLIC HEALTH AND HOUSING. 187 

second is the demolition of the worst and 
out-of-date areas and reconstruction in 
healthy " flats," and the ''constructive adapt- 
ation " of the best of the existing houses in 
better areas in such a manner as to resemble 
healthy flats. 

The demolition of insanitary areas is a 
very small contribution towards displace- 
ment of resident population compared with 
the demolition and displacement caused by 
street improvements, the construction of 
public and quasi-public buildings, the erection 
or enlargement of factories, workshops, ware- 
houses, and offices, and the extension of 
railway, parcels, transport, and other depots. 

A great part of the displacement of resident 
population takes place without demolition, 
by the conversion of dwelling-houses to other 
uses, commercial and professional, in the 
growth of large cities. 

The establishment and extension of 
factories and workshops, whether accom- 
panied by demolition or not, tend to cause 
the greatest local crowding of population, 
because by displacement they not only double 
the population that seeks dwelling room in 



i88 PUBLIC HEALTH 

the surrounding houses, but also treble it by 
attracting new workers. 

The nearer we approach towards the 
centre of a city the greater the cost of the 
land, and consequently the greater the cost of 
the dwelling. Insufficiency or inconvenience 
of transit to the inner and outer suburbs of 
large cities prevents the better class from 
moving out, and they are more able to pay 
higher rents which follow upon the conges- 
tion, and thus render it more difficult for the 
working classes to find housing room. In 
fact, if it were not for subsidisation many of 
the present working-class dwellings would 
not exist. In London, many of the companies 
that have erected dwellings acquired sites 
below their commercial value from the 
Metropolitan Board of Works ; the County 
and other Councils write off the difference 
between the commercial and working-class 
housing value of sites ; the Government have 
sold sites below commercial value for housing 
purposes ; some of the great ground land- 
lords of London have let sites for working- 
class dwellings much below their commercial 
value ; the philanthropic trusts have no 



AND HOUSING. 189 

interest to pay on borrowed money, and no 
sinking fund instalments to repay ; in short, 
a stage has been reached at which it is 
almost impossible to house working classes 
in inner London without direct or indirect 
subsidisation. 

If subsidisation had not taken place, it is 
possible that rentals would have risen still 
higher than they are, that workmen would 
have demanded higher wages in central 
London, and that manufacturers would have 
found it more economical to have moved 
their factories and workshops out of London. 

Committed to subsidisation it will be found 
difficult to obtain the structural improvement 
of existing dwelling-houses without assisting 
the owners pecuniarily, whether the assist- 
ance be that of philanthropists or of the state 
or municipality, and every one acquainted 
with the condition of existing tenement houses 
knows that this improvement is as clamant 
as any for the amelioration of the conditions 
of housing. 

With improved locomotion, and additional 
construction in the suburbs, the classes that 
can afford the more time and money will 



igo PUBLIC HEALTH AND HOUSING. 

move away, and with this movement the 
houses vacated will be sublet in separate 
dwellings to the smaller wage-earning class. 
There will still remain the necessity to alter 
and adapt the best of the existing houses 
from an unhealthy " floor " type to a healthy 
" flat " type, and to supplement existing laws 
and by-laws to control not only the dwelling- 
house, but also, what is infinitely more 
important both as to construction and usage 
under the changing style of habitation, the 
"dwelling."

decaie of other townes, buroughes, and villages within the 
Realme, but also th' infeccion of the plague thereby the 
rather continued and augmented to the los of great 
nombers of people, the inconveniencie whereof as of 
other like disorders hereby followed and like further to 
ensue (which at large were expressed in the said pro- 
clamacion) being then by her Majestie and us graciouslie 
and gravely considered, moved her to take ordre for the 
reforming thereof and gave auctoritie to you aswel to 
forbid and inhibit al such buildinges as to punish the 
persons that after the publishing of the said proclamacion 
should attempt to build and erect houses and tenementes 
contrarie to her Majestie's prohibicion therein contained. 
Howebeit her Majestie's gracious intent and care had 
from (sic) the preventing of th' inconveniencies and 
disorders aforesaid have taken so slendre effect as 
sithence the said proclamacion published the building 
of houses and tenementes about the citie hath been

EXTRACT FROM THE REPORT OF THE CENSUS OF ENGLAND 
AND WALES, 1891, VOL. IV., p. 20. 

Definition of " House" " Tenement" and Room" 

In each successive Census Act it has been provided 
that not only should the number of people be taken, but 
also the number of houses in which they live. In the 
Act under which the enumeration of 1891 was made this 
provision as to houses was repeated ; but, for the first 
time, it was further enacted that account should also be 
taken of all tenements with less than five rooms. No dis- 
tinct definition was given in the Act of the terms " house," 
" tenement," or " room," and we have reason to believe 
that the same meaning was not invariably attached to them 
by those who were locally engaged in the enumeration. 

According to the instructions issued by us for the 
guidance of the enumerator, all the space within the 
external and party walls of a building was to be con- 
sidered a separate house, by however many families, living 
in distinct tenements or apartments, it might be occupied. 

By a " tenement " was to be understood any house or part 
of a house separately occupied either by the owner or by a 
tenant ; and a separate schedule was to be given to the 
occupier of each such tenement. It is plain to us, how- 
ever, that these instructions were by no means invariably 



200 APPENDIX. 

observed, and it appears that the term " tenement " was 
especially the cause of much confusion. Some thought 
that "house" and "tenement" were equivalent terms, which 
might be used indifferently for each other, and we had 
instances in which several hundreds of flats, instead of 
being returned only as separate tenements, were returned 
as separate houses. In other cases a flat or lodging, 
separately occupied and therefore returnable as a tene- 
ment, was altogether ignored, and its occupiers returned 
as members of the family of the landlord, who lived in 
the rest of the house. There were even instances in 
which the enumerator appears to have thought that a 
tenement meant a room occupied by members of different 
families in common, and returned in consequence each 
separate room in a common lodging-house as a separate 
tenement. 

All such errors when detected were corrected by us ; 
but, as such detection could only be the result of chance, 
we cannot but suppose that many similar mis-statements 
have gone uncorrected. 

As regards the term " room " we gave no instructions. 
Such would have been useless, as the instructions could 
only reach the enumerator, and it was not the enumerator 
but the occupier himself who had to state on his schedule 
whether his tenement had less than five rooms, and if so, 
how many. 

The term " room " is very elastic, and can be stretched 
by those who please to cover a landing, a lobby, a closet, 
or any other more or less distinct space within a dwelling. 
When it is borne in mind that overcrowding is a legal 
offence, it is in the highest degree probable that a man 
with a large family crowded into a small tenement .will 
in his schedule have given at any rate the widest possible 



APPENDIX. 201 

interpretation to the word "room." It is possible that 
this want of precision in the use of the term may account 
for some of the extraordinary differences in regard to 
house accommodation which will be presently shown to 
exist between different counties and different towns. We 
can, however, only deal with the figures as they stand. 

II. 

Further Definitions of " House" " Tenement" 
" Lodging" &V. 

Building and House. The Public Health (London) 
Act, 1891, s. 141: "The expressions 'building' and 
' house ' respectively include the curtilage of a building 
or house, and include a building or house wholly or 
partly erected under statutory authority." 

Domestic Building. The London Building Act, 1894, 
s. 5 (26) : " The expression ' domestic building' includes 
a dwelling-house and any other building not being a 
public building or of the warehouse class." 

Dwelling-house. The same Act, s. 5 (25): "The 
expression ' dwelling-house ' means a building used or 
constructed or adapted to be used wholly or principally 
for human habitation." 

Habitable. The same Act, s. 5 (38) : " The expression 
' habitable ' applied to a room means a room constructed 
or adapted to be inhabited." 

Inhabited. The same Act, s. 5 (37) : The expression 
' inhabited ' applied to a room means a room in which 
some person passes the night, or which is used as a living 
room, including a room with respect to which there is a 
probable presumption (until the contrary is shown) that 
some person passes the night therein, or that it is used as 
a living room." 



202 APPENDIX. 

House, Tenement, Lodging. By Rule i, Schedule B, of 
48 Geo. 3, c. 55, re-enacted by 14 & 15 Viet. c. 36, s. 2, 
" the occupier or occupiers for the time being of every 
dwelling-house " is primarily liable for inhabited house 
duty. By Rule 14, " Where any dwelling-house shall be 
divided into different tenements being distinct properties, 
every such tenement shall be subject to the same duties as 
if the same was an entire house, which duty shall be paid 
by the occupiers thereof respectively." By Rule 6, 
"Where any house shall be let in different stories, 
tenements, lodgings, or landings, and shall be inhabited 
by two or more persons or families, the same shall never- 
theless be subject to and shall in like manner be charged 
to the said duties as if such house or tenement was 
inhabited by one person or family only, and the landlord 
or owner shall be deemed the occupier of such dwelling- 
house, and shall be charged to the said duties." 

Note. According to recent decisions there does not 
appear to be any clear demarcation between a house, 
tenement, and lodging ; it appears ultimately to depend 
not upon construction but upon usage, whether there is a 
lock and key to the outer opening on to the street, and 
whether the owner or the occupiers retain the key, regard- 
less of the internal arrangement of the building, provided 
it is occupied by members of more than one family, in 
separate rooms. 



APPENDIX C. 

THE LONDON BUILDING ACT, 1894. 
Rules as to Conversion of Buildings. 

Section 211. Unless in any case the Council otherwise 
allow, no person shall 

(1) Convert into or use as a dwelling-house any build- 
ing or part of a building not originally constructed for 
human habitation ; 

(2) Convert into one dwelling-house two or more 
dwelling-houses constructed originally as separate dwell- 
ing-houses ; 

(3) Convert into or use as two or more dwelling-houses 
any building constructed originally as one dwelling-house; 

(4) Convert a building which, when originally erected, 
was legally exempt from the operation of any building 
enactments or by-laws in force within London, into a 
building which, had it been originally erected in its con- 
verted form, would have been within the operation of 
these enactments or by-laws ; 

(5) Reconvert into or use as a dwelling-house any 
building which has been discontinued as or appropriated 
for any purpose other than a dwelling-house ; 

(6) Convert into or use as a dwelling-room or part of 
a dwelling-room any room or part of a room used as a 
shop; or 



204 APPENDIX. 

(7) Convert a dwelling-house or any part of a dwelling- 
house into a shop ; in such manner that the building or 
part of a building so converted as aforesaid when con- 
verted will not be in conformity with the provisions of this 
Act relating to the class of buildings to which the building 
when so converted will belong. 

Section 200. (12) Every person who, without the con- 
sent of the Council, converts or uses a building contrary 
to any of the provisions of the section of this Act, of 
which the marginal note is " Rules as to conversion of 
buildings," shall be liable to a penalty not exceeding ten 
pounds, and to a daily penalty not exceeding the like 
amount for every day on which the building remains so 
converted or is used contrary to the provisions of the 
said section. 

Note. These provisions apply to dwelling-houses; 
only number 6 applies to a dwelling-room, and only in 
one particular the use of a shop as a dwelling- room. 



APPENDIX D. 



HOUSING OF THE WORKING CLASSES COMMITTEE OF THE 
LONDON COUNTY COUNCIL. 

Building Regulations approved by the Council on 
December $rd, 1889. 

(a) Staircases. A central staircase in blocks of dwel- 
lings is objectionable, and as regards convenience of 
plan and thorough ventilation of each dwelling, the best 
amongst the modes commonly in use is that which 
provides a staircase close to the outer wall, and having 
large openings communicating with the open air. Such 
a staircase can be conveniently arranged to give access 
to four dwellings, and the ventilation for such dwellings 
can be effected by means of open doors and fanlights, so 
that a thorough current of air can be obtained when it is 
desired. If it is felt in the winter time that this arrange- 
ment leaves the persons using the staircases too much 
exposed to the weather, windows partially enclosing the 
openings can be provided. 

The chief alternative to this kind of staircase seems to 
be one which is in the centre of the block, and gives 
access to dwellings on each side of it. In this case the 
ingress of fresh air to the staircases can only be through 
the entrance doorway, and along a short passage, and 
through the skylight at the top of the staircase. Upon 



206 APPENDIX. 

this the dwellings opening from the staircase have to 
depend for their through ventilation. 

Both these plans are in considerable use. 

Staircases in buildings more than three stories high 
should be at least 4 feet in width. The walls of the stair- 
cases to a height of about 4 feet 6 inches should be 
finished with glazed or hard pressed bricks; the upper 
portions with hard bricks neatly pointed. 

(b) Basement Floors. There is no doubt that, as 
compared with the other floors of a building, the base- 
ment floor is undesirable as a residence, but in building 
artisans' dwellings it is generally expedient to construct 
a story below the ground floor, though it is not necessary 
that they should be used as dwellings, but inasmuch as 
there is no definite evidence at the present time that base- 
ment rooms, fronting upon a principal street, should not 
be used for dwelling purposes, their use need not be 
forbidden, provided that adequate precautions against 
fire are taken, and that the bottom of the window sills 
is not lower than the level of the adjoining pavement, 
and not more than 3 feet above the floor, and that in other 
respects they agree with the provisions of section 103 of 
the Metropolis Local Management Act (18 & 19 Viet, 
c. 120) as applied to new buildings. 

They are usually let at a rate materially lower than the 
rooms above them, but if they are let at the same rate as 
the upper floors in a high block of buildings they are 
preferred by many people who are not able to mount a 
considerable number of stairs. Beyond the question of 
health, it is not necessary to object to such rooms on 
account of their proximity to the street, those who occupy 
them being able to make such arrangements for privacy 
as they find necessary. 



APPENDIX. 207 

When no areas are practicable the walls should be 
covered with asphalte or other damp-resisting material, 
from the damp-course to the footings. 

(c) Bath-rooms, &c. Unless they are in close vicinity 
to public baths and washhouses (a condition which can 
very rarely happen) bath and washhouse accommodation 
should be provided to every block of dwellings, and this 
can best be provided in a separate building or on the 
basement floor, or in a distinct section of the block 
that can be constantly under inspection, and to which 
inexpensive arrangements for water supply, &c., can be 
applied. 

In connection with this matter the water-closet accom- 
modation has been considered, on the assumption that 
the dwellings to be built or promoted by the Council will 
generally be for the accommodation of the lowest class 
of the population which inhabits separate tenements, a 
class just above that which uses the common lodging- 
houses, and for which neither private speculators nor the 
societies for building artisans' dwellings make any provi- 
sions. It seems inexpedient that either water-closets or 
separate water-supply or sinks should be constructed so 
as to be immediately accessible from any dwelling-rooms. 
A sufficient number of closets should be supplied to each 
floor of dwellings to which a separate staircase is provided, 
together with a provision of sinks and water-supply for 
common use. Such closets should have both doors and 
windows opening directly to the open air, and where 
possible there should be one closet to each family. 

Dust shoots should be provided for each common 
scullery, or from the landing adjacent, to discharge into 
galvanized iron movable dustbins, which can be carried 
out and emptied into the dust-cart. 



2o8 APPENDIX. 

(d) Size of Room. The number of rooms to be 
provided in each tenement, and their sizes, have been 
considered as one question, and the following may be 
regarded as minima : 

(i) In a one-roomed tenement the minimum super- 
ficial area should be 144 feet. This would con- 
veniently be provided in a room measuring 
about 12 feet by 12 feet. 

(2.) A two-roomed tenement should have a similar 
room, with an additional room containing 
96 superficial feet, or measuring 12 feet by 
8 feet. 

(3.) A three-roomed tenement should have a large 
room containing 144 feet in superficial area, 
and two rooms each containing 96 feet. 
These sizes, however, should not be rigidly fixed, but 
rooms of various sizes should be provided. 

Four-roomed tenements need not be provided, but if 
they are the fourth room should be of about 100 feet 
superficial area. 

It would be convenient as regards planning, and also 
as regards the population to be accommodated, that some 
little variety should exist in the sizes of the rooms in each 
tenement as well as in their number, in order to provide 
for the different conditions of the families. 

The standard height for every room should be 9 feet. 
The walls of the rooms should be finished in some hard 
material, for which purpose Portland cement upon brick- 
work, or brick with pressed face on both sides, should be 
used up to a height of about 3 feet 6 inches. The upper 
parts of the wall can be finished by a thin coating of 
hard plaster upon brickwork, but upon this point some 
further inquiry is desirable. 



APPENDIX. 209 

In designing the buildings some care should be taken 
to give a pleasant appearance to them. 

As regards the interval which should exist between any 
block of dwellings and the nearest building obstructing the 
light from its windows, it is suggested that if practicable 
this distance should be equal to one and a half times the 
height of the obstructing building. But it does not 
appear that this space can, in view of the cost of the 
land, be generally provided. Under no circumstances 
should a nearer distance than the height of the buildings 
be allowed.

The Case 
Against the 
Housing System 
in Rural 
Districts. 



By W. WALTER CROTCH. 



SOME REVIEWS. 

Pall Mall Gazette. " Should any one wish to present a really useful book to 
a Parish or District Councillor, the one for him to choose is certainly ' The 
Cottage Homes of England,' for it deals with a subject in which all local 
authorities are, or ought to be, keenly interested just now ; deals with it too in 
a plain, straightforward, practical fashion." 

Bast Anglian Times. " We hope that all who are interested in the problem 
of rural housing will read Mr. CROTCH'S graphic narrative of facts. . . . We 
should like to see a copy of this book sent to the Chairman of every Parish 
Council in the kingdom." 

Birmingham Gazette. "That a general reform in the housing of the poor of 
all conditions is urgently needed is evident on all sides, and to those with 
power or influence to advance the cause we specially commend this little 
volume." 

Sheffield Independent." Mr. CROTCH'S little handbook is worthy of close 
attention by all the Members of Parish and District Councils who want to 
know the possibilities and limitations of the law respecting rural housing." 

Review of the Week. " A well-written plea for much needed reform in our 
rural housing system. The author gives instances of overcrowding and other 
evils, and also instances of successful efforts for reform, notably at Penshurst, 
where the Parish Council have secured half-a-dozen cottages as an initial 
experiment, which gives promise of success."

STATISTICS. 



THIS Book is intended to supply a TEXT BOOK dealing with the 
METHODS and PRINCIPLES of STATISTICS recognised by statis- 
tical experts or used by official statisticians. The methods by 
which accurate statistics can be collected are examined and illustrated, 
and the TECHNIQUE of statistical representation DISCUSSED. Con- 
siderable space is allotted to the subject of AVERAGES and of GRAPHIC 
REPRESENTATION, and many examples are given of their use 
and abuse. Other subjects, little discussed in any books easily 
accessible to English students, such as the ACCURACY OF RESULTS 
and the INTERPOLATION OF MISSING ESTIMATES, are also dealt with 
in Part I., while in Part II. will be found an ELEMENTARY INTRO- 
DUCTION TO MODERN MATHEMATICAL STATISTICS, with a Careful 

analysis of the GROUNDWORK OF THE THEORY OF ERROR. 

To Government Officials, Consuls, Town Clerks, Medical Officers, 
and others engaged in Municipal and Local Government, this Book 
will be especially useful, as well as to all those Merchants, Bankers, 
Brokers, &c., who in their business compile, use, or check statistics. 

I'conomir. Journal. "The London School of Economics has, since its foundation, had 
systematic courses of lectures on the elements of statistics, and the school therefore is entitled 
to share with Mr. Bowley the congratulations which are due to him for supplying a long-felt 
want. Without further ado it may be plainly stated that, whatever its shortcomings, this book 
is the best on the Elements of Statistics written in English, French, German or Italian." 

University Extension Journal. "This is a work for which in itself we have conceived an 
almost unqualified admiration. Its absolute merits are great enough to enable it to dispense 
with such added praise or mitigation of censure as pioneer work may often justly ask. It is 
really the first connected English treatise which assumes the existence of the newest variety 
of the human species, the serious and scientific student of statistics. To meet the common 
superstition that 'anything may be proved by statistics,' there can be no better means than to 
refer the objector to just such a work as this. But in the present state of statistical knowledge, 
or rather of statistical ignorance, it would be of little use so to refer him if the work itself were 
not well and brightly written, as is this, with here and there those quiet gleams of humour 
that mark the author for the skilled teacher that he is." 

J ournal of the Institute of Actuaries. " A good English text-book on Statistics has been 
a long-felt want, and there can be little doubt but that Mr. Bowley has supplied this want in 
an admirable way." 

P. S. KING & SON, Orchard House, Westminster,

Pall Mall Gazette. "At a time when the Poor Law is once more 
the subject of impassioned denunciation in respect to its treatment of 
both young and old, it would, we think, be well if the public could be 
got to study with due seriousness the facts contained in this volume. 
They are to be learnt nowhere else more concisely or convincingly. 
Mr. Chance is no mere doctrinaire. His book is full of valuable 
evidence as well as of close reasoning. . . . This volume should 
certainly be read by every guardian of the poor." 

Spectator. " Mr. Chance's book contains much that may be read 
with advantage by all who are concerned for the welfare of the poor." 

Manchester Guardian. " The book is full of knowledge and good 
sense. Besides valuable chapters on the Poor Law and Friendly 
Societies, on Public and Private Charity, and in Defence of Poor Law 
Schools, Mr. Chance also deals with the Old Age Pensions Question. 
He reviews the numerous schemes, and his remarks as to the dangers 
and difficulties of partial and sectional measures are valuable." 

Rochdale Observer. "A timely volume, which deserves the thought- 
ful study of our political leaders at this juncture." 

Bristol Times and Mirror. " For those interested in Poor Law 
administration this book will be found invaluable."

TAXATION, Local 
and Imperial ; 

J. G. GRAHAM, 

LOCAL . . 
GOVERNMENT. 

* * * 

Councillor and Guardian." Mr. Warmington, in a third edition of Mr. 
Graham's work upon these subjects, has compressed a great deal into an 
excellent little book. The limited size of the work necessarily precluded any- 
thing beyond a condensed epitome of the leading features indicated by the 
title, and people who desire to be accurately informed without being over- 
whelmed with statistics will probably find just what they require in these 
pages. The inconsistency and the inequity of the English system of taxation 
are admirably illustrated, and, indeed, the curiosities of legislative ineptitude 
which they exemplify will probably be astonishing to many readers of the 
book." 

Local Government Chronicle. "This is an essay of very considerable 
interest at the present time, as it treats on questions of taxation and rating 
that have come prominently to the fore in connection with the investigations 
of the Royal Commission on Local Taxation now sitting. . . . For a concise 
and readable history of the various rates and taxes, together with some useful 
statistics concerning them, this book may be thoroughly recommended, for it 
is clear and to the point." 

Local Government Journal. 11 The book is exceedingly valuable for refer- 
ence, containing as it does a large amount of information upon all forms of 
taxation. The author enquires into the question whether the local rates are 
paid by those persons who ought to pay them, and he gives an historical 
account of how these rates came to be made payable." 

South Wales Daily News. "The writers of the book referred to discuss 
the question fully, though concisely ; for they possess the art of summarising 
clearly the vast mass of facts and figures that have to be dealt with, and they 
have the higher power of presenting these and their own conclusions in a lucid 
and forcible manner. To anyone taking part in the administration of public 
affairs, the book will prove most useful."

HISTORY OF THE ENGLISH POOR LAW, 

Vols. I. and II., in connection with the Legislation and 
other Circumstances affecting the Condition of the People, 
924-1853. 

By SIR GEORGE NICHOLLS, K.C.B., Poor Law Commissioner and 
Secretary to the Poor Law Board. New Revised Edition, with a 
Biography and Portrait of the Author. 2 Vols. Demy 8vo, cloth, 30s. 

THE demand for this standard work, which has been out of print 
for some time since its original publication in 1854, has been 
such as to call for a new edition. This new edition is edited by Mr. 
H. G. Willink, a grandson of the author, and Chairman of the Brad- 
field Poor Law Union. He incorporates in it the manuscript notes 
and corrections made by Sir George Nicholls in his own copy, and 
has written an interesting biography of the author, which appears as 
a preface to Vol. I. A new index has been made and placed at the 
end of Vol. II. 

Spectator. " This new edition of a work, which has almost become 
a classic, is enriched by a life of the author, and by many notes." 

Speaker. " It is still the standard work on its subject, and in- 
valuable to the student of the present-day problems of pauperism." 

Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science. 
" This new edition of Nicholls's ' History of the English Poor Law ' 
will be thoroughly appreciated by a large circle of readers, including 
students of several of the social sciences." 



HISTORY OF THE ENGLISH POOR LAW, 

Vol. III. Being an Independent as well as a Supple- 
mentary Volume to the above, brought from 1834 up to 
the present time. 

By THOMAS MACKAY, Author of "The English Poor," and Editor 

of the Volume of Essays, " A Plea for Liberty : an Argument against 

Socialism." Demy 8vo, cloth, 21s. 

THE scope and character of the work, which brings the subject from 
1834 down to the present time, and the thoroughness with which 
the author has treated the subject, compares favourably with that of 
Volumes I. and II. This volume has assumed more or less the form 
of an independent work, and the reader is asked to regard it as a 
supplement rather than as a continuation of Sir George Nicholls's 
history. A separate and complete index has been provided. 

Pall Mall Gazette. " As befits the sequel to a classic, this work at 
once takes its place in the first front of the literature on the subject." 

Quarterly Review. " Mr. Mackay has produced a remarkable book, 
written in a popular style, which will appeal to a wider circle of 
readers than either official publications or purely scientific works can 
hope for." 

Spectator. " The work of a man most fully qualified both by grasp 
of economic principles and by practical experience." 

Manchester Guardian. " Mr. Mackay has produced a very valuable 
book which no future student of the modern Poor Law can afford to 
neglect." :
