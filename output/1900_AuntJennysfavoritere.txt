And How Calvin loves my Spry Cookin' ! 
Good-tastin' food makes a heap of difference to any family, 
doesn't it, ladies? And that's why you'll set such a store by Spry. 
It makes every thin' taste so grand. Whether you're a brand-new 
bride or an old hand at cookin' you'll be surprised how delicate 
Spry makes all your cakes, pies, and fried foods. 

What's more, everythin' you make the Spry way digests so easy 
and tastes so good. Take my husband, Calvin. Since I've been 
doin' all my bakin' and fryin' with Spry, he's just about eatin' 
me out of house and home. 



Then take the receipts in this book. They're so thrifty and 
dependable you're bound to like 'em. Why every single one has 
been tested over and over in the Spry Kitchen. Follow 'em care- 
fully — that's what I mean when I tell you to cook the Spry way. 



So get a can of Spry today. See how soft and creamy — how 
smooth and white it is ! You'll say Spry blends with other ingre- 
dients faster 'n you can say "Jack Robinson!" Why it takes only 
a jiffy to mix cakes and pie crust with Spry. And this all-vege- 
table shortenin' keeps sweet and fresh right on my kitchen shelf. 
You owe it to yourselves, ladies, to try Spry now. Better ask for 
the thrifty three-pound can — it gives you more for your money.

US LADIES IN THE 
SEWIN' CIRCLE GOT 

talkin' *bout spry 
the other day an' 
how it makes our 
cookin' go easier 
an' taste 6etter- 
so i thought i'o pass 
some of their tips 

ON TO YOU 



Cakes so light, velvety, delicate ! 

"Why you could have knocked me over with a feather the first 
cake I made with Spry," says Sarah Garland (her husband's 
principal down at the High School). "For years I'd thought there 
was only one shortenin' for cakes. But Spry gives such fight, fine, 
delicate-flavored cakes and think how much easier on your 
budget than if you'd used more expensive cake shortenin'. Spry's 
so smooth and so marvelously creamy it mixes in a jiffy." 

What flaky, tender pastry ! 

And then that little bride up our street spoke up real proud-like: 
"Bill says my pie crust made the Spry way is so flaky and tender 
it melts in his mouth. And it's easy to digest as plain bread. No 
bother to make either, even for a greenhorn like me. Spry cuts 
into the flour quick as can be. And just think, you don't even 
have to chill your ingredients!" 

Foods fried the Spry v^ay are crisper and so digestible ! 

But say, when it comes to fryin', I could tell as much as any of 
'em! Since I been fryin' the Spry way, you should see all the 
doughnuts, French fries, and fried chicken my husband, Calvin, 
stows away! And they're so good for him. Best of all, there's no 
pesky fryin' smell an' smoke when you fry with Spry. It's purer. 
So no wonder you get better-tastin' baked foods, too.

The Greatest Time-saver in the History of Pie Bakin' 



Spry Pastry 
Mix 

So quick and easy to 
use! Just add water 
and mix. 



Uses for 

Left-over 

Pastry 

I use my pie-dough 
scraps for makin' 
these "little pies." My 
grandchildren are al- 
ways beggin' for 'em. 



Page 2 



CIFT flour and salt together into a large bowl. . . . 
*^ Add 1 pound Spry to flour and cut in until mix- 
ture is as fine as meal. . . . Add remaining 1 pound 
Spry and continue cutting until particles are size of 
a navy bean. . . . Put Spry Pastry Mix in a covered 
container and store on the pantry shelf or in the 
cupboard for use as needed. Do not keep Spry 
Pastry Mix in the refrigerator — it will keep sweet 
and fresh at room temperature. 



3 ' 2 pounds (14 cups 
sifted) all- 
purpose flour 
2 tablespoons salt 
2 pounds (4% cups) 

Spry 
This recipe makes 
enough Spry Pastry Mix 
for about a dozen large, 
fender, flaky pies. 



Old-time Jelly Tarts 

Roll dough 1 s-inch thick and cut 
with cookie cutter. In 3^ of the circles 
cut 2 or 3 small holes with thimble. 
Bake in very hot oven (450°F.) 5 to 
10 minutes. Cool. Put plain and per- 
forated pastry circles together in 
pairs with jelly between. 
Stacked Pies 

Spread 5-inch baked circles of pas- 
try with apple butter and put lightly 
together in stacks of three. 



Sugar Snails 

Roll dough i^-inch thick. Sprinkle 
with mixture of sugar and cinnamon 
or sugar rubbed with a little grated 
lemon rind. Roll like jelly roll and 
cut in thin slices. Bake in hot oven 
(425°F.) 5 to 10 minutes. 
Sugar Pies 

Roll dough K-inch thick and cut 
in 7-inch circle. Spread liberally with 
brown sugar to within 3^-inch of edge 
and dot with butter. Fold edge over 
sugar and press down. Bake in hot 
oven (425°F.) 5 to 10 minutes. 




Cut in First Half of Spry Finely 
Add Spry to sifted flour and salt in 
two portions. Cut in the first half 
until mixture is as fine as meal. 
This makes the pastry extra tender. 



Cut in Other Half of Spry Coarsely 
Add the remaining half of the Spry 
and continue cutting, leaving larger 
pieces about the size of navy beans. 
This makes the pastry extra flalaj. 



Look sharp at these 
pictures, ladies 
you'll get some point- 
ers on makin' the pies 
and tarts on the fol- 
owin' pages. 




This picture at the 
left shows a dandy 
way to keep fruit pies 
like Cherry Pie and 
Blueberry Pie (page 
5) from boilin' over. 



Now Add (^uki \\ atcr Sparingly 
Sprinkle water over flour-Spry mix- 
ture gradually, mixing lightly with 
a fork. Add only enough to make a 
dough that "cleans the bowl." 



Seal Fruit Pies to Keep in Juices 
Trim undercrust even with edge of 
pan. Cut top crust H-inch larger 
and fold it under the bottom crust. 
Press together with tines of a fork.

Let The Dough Relax in Pan 

After rolling the dough and prick- 
ing it all over with a fork, fit 
dough gently into the pan and let 
relax 5 minutes. This helps to 
keep the pastry from shrinking. 



rmi 




Pat Out Air with Ball of Dough 

Pat pastry with ball of dough, 
working outward from center. 
This forces out air and helps to 
make a pie shell that will not puff 
out of shape during the baking. 



Make A Little Wall All Around 
After cutting pastry 1-inch larger 
than pan, turn dough back even 
with rim to make a standup "col- 
lar." Then crimp evenly with 
finger tips into a fluted rim.

Blending Flavors 
Blend Spry with salt 
and flavoring (ex- 
tracts, spices, etc.). 
Spry blends flavors 
perfectly — distrib- 
utes them evenly. 



Thorough Creaming 

Add sugar to Spry 
gradually, creaming 
until mixture is fluffy 
and light. See how 
quickly Spry creams 
— and how easily. 



Remember Sifting 

Be sure to sift flour 
once before measur- 
ing. Flour packs on 
standing, and if not 
sifted, gives an over- 
measurement. 



Mixing Carefully 

Add sifted dry in- 
gredients in quarters 
— liquid in thirds — 
starting with flour. 
Mix until smooth 
after each addition.

CRISP AN' PIPIN' HOT 





Page 20 



Blanching — 370° F. — 5 to 7 minutes per basket. 
. . . Heat Spry to 370°F. Lower }4 of potatoes in 
basket into deep hot Spry. Fry until potatoes are 
tender but not brown (5 to 7 minutes). Drain on 
absorbent paper. Blanch remaining 2 lots in same 
manner and hold until nearly serving time. 

Browning — 390° F. — 1 to 1^2 minutes per basket. 
This is the last short step and should be done at 
serving time. . . . Lower Yi of blanched potatoes 
in basket into Spry which has been reheated to 
390°F. Fry until potatoes are crisp and brown (1 to 
XVi minutes). Brown remaining half in same man- 
ner. Drain on absorbent paper, sprinkle with salt, 
and serve immediately. . . . Serves 6. 

If a single frying period is used, fry potatoes at 
385°F. until tender and brown (about 20 minutes). 



Remember, Ladies! 



"Blanchin"' means 
fryin' your pota- 
toes first in Spry 
at a temperature 
of 370°F. till ten- 
der and just start- 
in' to brown. (It's 
handy to do this 
hours ahead of din- 
ner time.) Then 
just before dinner, 
brown 'em quick in 
real hot Spry (390° 
F.). Takes only a 
jiffy for several 
helpin's and they're 
all so hot and crisp! 



6 large potatoes, 
washed, pared, 
and cut in 
lengthwise 
strips, 

2>2X^ inches. 
Dry thoroughly. 
Divide into 3 lots. 
(If desired, the 
potatoes can be 
soaked 1 hour in 
ice water and 
then dried thor- 
oughly between 
towels. ) 
2 to 3 pounds Spry 



No unpleasant 
smoke or odor when 
you fry with Spry. 



AND, MY, (SNYiTA COMFORT 

NOT TO HAVE VOUR KITCHEN 
FULL OF SMOKE WHEN YOU FRY 



Before I used Spry, I never thought of 
fryin' when I had company — smoked 
and smelled up the house so. Calvin 
hated fryin' odor, too. But now he 
doesn't know I've been fryin' till he sets 
down to the table! 

And take my word for it, ladies, foods 
fried the Spry way are crispy and tasty 
and so digestible a child can eat 'em. 
They're never heavy or greasy. 

If some of you ladies don't have fryin' 
thermometers, just drop a cube of stale 
bread into the fat. If it turns a nice 
golden brown in 1 minute, the temper- 
ature's about right for most fryin'. Or, 
you can use some of the food you're 
goin' to fry. Say you're fryin' dough- 
nuts — drop in a little doughnut 
"center" and if it browns in 1 minute, 
the temperature of the fat's about 
right for fryin' your doughnuts. 




Save your Spry 

for another fryin' 

After fryin', just let the hot 
fat cool a little, then strain 
it through several layers of 
cheesecloth in a strainer into 
an empty Spry can. Cover, 
and keep on the shelf (it 
doesn't need refrigeratin'). 
Spry is so pure you can fry 
with it over and over! Now 
isn't that a real savin'?

Beside tastin' ex^ra-good, foods 
made the Spry way sure set 
easy on the stomach! Take 
cakes and biscuits — they're 
so much lighter and finer. 
Same with pie crust — it's so 
flaky and tender, so crisp and 
delicate. No wonder it digests 
as easy as plain bread ! 

And you'll notice such a dif- 
ference with fried foods! Fact 
is, foods fried proper in Spry 
are as digestible as if baked. 
Here's why: Spry is sweet and 
pure — doesn't break down in

gestible a child can eat 'em. 



fryin'. It forms a crisp, golden 
crust that seals in flavor and 
prevents foods from becoming 
heavy and greasy. 

New Handy 
Hinged -Top Can 

You'll love Spry's handy, 
new, hinged-top can. It's so 
convenient. You can open and 
close it in a jiffy with just a 
flick of the wrist. And the lid 
never gets lost or falls on the 
floor. Get the thrifty 3-pound 
or the big family-size 6-pound 
can.
