PREFACE. 



As a general rule, I do not believe in prefaces, but feel- 
ing bound to submit to the time-honored custom, I am free 
to confess that, had I known the labor necessary to produce 
a first-class "Cookery Book," I should hardly have had 
the resolution to commence it. However, I have done my 
utmost to make it useful and acceptable. The recipes have 
been most carefully compiled, and valuable assistance has 
been rendered me by friends in France, Germany, Great 
Britain and Canada, as well as in the United States, to all 
of whom I render my most sincere thanks. I also desire to 
record my grateful appreciation of the immense success 
my "Cookery Book" has met with. The number of 
orders already received for it convinces me that I have 
supplied a real want, and that my book will help my sisters 
to lighten their toil and gladden the hearts of their families.

INTRODUCTORY OBSERVATIONS. 



"The miinber of inhabitants who may be supported in any 
country upon its internal produce depends about as much upon 
ths state of the Art of Cookery as upon that of Agriculture : but if 
Cookery be of so much importance, it certainly deserves to be 
studied with the gi'eatest of care. Cookery and Agriculture are 
arts of civilized nations. Savages understand neither of them." — 
Count Rumford's Works, Vol. 1. 

The importance of the Art of Cookery is very great ; in- 
deed, from the richest to the poorest the selection and 
preparation of food often becomes the chief object in life. 
The rich man's table is luxuriously spread ; no amount of 
money is spared in procuring the rarest delicacies of the sea- 
sop. Art and Nature alike contribute to his necessities. The 
less wealthy have, indeed, fewer resources, yet these may 
be greatly increased by the knowledge of what may be 
called trifling details and refinement in the art of cookery, 
which depend much more on the manner of doing a thing 
than on the cost attending it. To cook well, therefore, 
is immensely more important to the middle and working 
classes than to the rich, for they who live by the " sweat of 
their brow," whether mentally or physically, must have the 
requisite strength to support their labor. Even to the poor, 
whose very life depends upon the produce of the hard earned 
dollar, cookery is of the greatest importance. Every wife, 
mother, or sister should be a good plain cook. If she has 
servants she can direct them, and if not, so much the more 
must depend upon herself. To such we venture to give a 
few general hints. An old saying (to be found in one of 
the earliest cookery books) : " First catch your hare, etc." 
has more significance than is generally supposed. To 
catch your hare well, you must spend your income judi- 
ciously. This is the chief thing. In our artificial state of 
society, every income, to keep up appearances, has at least 
half as much more to do than it can afford. In the selec*

tion of provisions, the best is generally the cheapest Hal; 
a pound of good meat is more nutritious than three times 
the amount of inferior. As to vegetables buy them fresh. 
Above all, where an income is small, and there are many 
to feed, be careful that all the nourishment is retained in 
the food that is purchased. This is to be effected by care- 
ful cooking. Cleanliness is an imperative condition. Let 
all cooking utensils be clean and in order. Uncleanliness 
produces disorder, and disorder confusion. Time and 
money are thus wasted, dinner spoiled, and all goes wrong. 
In the cooking of meat by any process whatever, remember, 
above all, to cook the juices in it, not out of it. 

BOILING. 

In boiling, put the meat if fresh into cold water, or, i f 
salt, into luke-warm, Simmer it very gently until done. 
It is a general rule to allow a quarter of an hour to every 
pound of meat ; but in this, as in everything else, judgment 
must be used according to the bone and shape of the joirft, 
and according to the taste of the eaters. All kinds of meat, 
fish, flesh, and fowl, should be boiled very slowly, and the 
scum taken off just as boiling commences. If meats are 
allowed to boil too fast they toughen, all their juices are 
extracted, and only the fleshy fibre, without sweetness, is 
left ; if they boil too long they are reduced to a jelly, and 
their nourishing properties are transferred to the water in 
which they are boiled. Nothing is more difficult than to 
boil meat exactly as it should be ; close attention and good 
judgment are indispensable. 

ROASTING. 

In roasting meat the gravy may be retained in it by 
pricking the joint all over with a fork and rubbing in pepper 
and salt. Mutton and beef may be underdone, veal and 
pork must be well cooked. Young meat generally requires 
more cooking than old ; thus lamb and veal must be more 
done than mutton and beefc In frosty weather meat wiH 
require a little more time for cooking. All joints for roast- 
ing will improve by hanging a day or so before cooking. 



INTRODUCTORY OBSERVATIONS. 



BROILING. 

Broiling is the most nutritious method of cooking mut- 
ton and pork chops, or beef and rump steaks, kidneys 
(which should never be cut open before cooking), etc. 
Have the gridiron clean, and put over a clear fire ; put the 
meat on it ; " keep it turned often." This last is a common 
direction in books but the reason why is never stated ; it is 
to keep the gravy in the meat. By letting the one side of a 
steak be well done before turning, you will see the red 
gravy settled on the top of the steak, and so the meat is 
hard and spoiled. This is cooking the gravy out of, in- 
stead of keeping it in, the meat to nourish the consumer. 
Never stick the fork in the meaty part ; you will lose gravy 
if you do. Be sure to turn often, and generally the chop 
or steak is done if it feels firm to the fork; if not done, it 
will be soft and flabby. It is economical to broil well. 
Many a very little piece of meat, nicely broiled, with gravy in 
it, well seasoned with pepper and salt, a very little butter 
on it, and served up quite hot, will make a better and more 
nourshing meal than four times the amount of badly- 
cooked in the frying pan. 

FRYING. 

Although very bad for chops or steaks, the frying pan is 
indispensable for some things, such as veal cutlets, Iamb 
chops (sometimes), fish, pancakes, etc. Most meats and 
fish are usually fried with egg and bread crumbs. The fry- 
ing pan must be kept clean. This is very essential, as the 
dirt that sticks to the pan absorbs the fat, prevents the 
meat browning, and turns it a nasty black color. Have a 
clear brisk fire, as the quicker meat is fried the tenderer it is. 
According to what is to be fried, put little or much fat in the 
pan, fish and pancakes require a considerable quantity. 
The fat must always boil before putting the meat into it ; 
if not, it coddles. For veal cutlets a little butter is best 
and most economical, as it helps to make the gravy ; but 
even this expense may be dispensed with, if incompatible 



INTRODUCTORY OBSERVATIONS. 



with the income of the family, and yet the cutlets be well 
cooked. Most have a few slices of bacon with either cut- 
lets or liver ; the fat from this, if the bacon be not rank, 
will do very nicely ; and if the meat be well flavored and 
fried quickly, and some nice gravy made to it, few persons 
would know the difference. Some like thickened and some 
piain gravy to these fried meats ; some a large quantity, 
others very little ; all these must be accommodated. To 
make these gravies, have ready a little burnt sugar to brown 
with ; empty the pan of the fat, if it be, as is most likely, 
too rank to use ; put some warm water, as much as you wish 
to make, in the pan ; mix very smoothly sufficient flour 
and water to thicken it to taste ; into this put as much 
butter as you like to use (a little will do, more will make it 
richer) ; pepper and salt it sufficiently ; stir it very smoothly 
into the pan, while the water is only warm ; stir it well until 
it boils, and brown it with the burnt sugar to your taste. 
This will be a cheap and very nice gravy for all fried. meats ; 
and where meat is short, children are very fond of such 
over potatoes, haricot beans, or even bread in their plates ; 
and not being too rich or greasy it will not disagree with 
them. Care must be taken after the gravy is boiled not to 
let it boil fast for any length of time, as all thickened grzy'its, 
hashes, etc., boil away very fast and dry up ; neither must it 
stand still in the pan ; a whitish scum then settles on the 
top and spoils the appearance of it. On the plainest and 
humblest dinner table, dishes may as well look inviting. 
N. B. — For all frying purposes be particular that the pan is 
thoroughly hot before using.

soup to the stewpan, add one pint of milk to it and boil ; when 
boiling, sprinkle in by degrees tapioca, stirring all the time ; 
then let it boil for 15 minutes gently. 

4. TAPIOCA S0T7F- — Ingredients — 1 pint of white stock, 1 oz. 

of tapioca, yolks of 2 eggs, 2 tablespoonfuls of cream or

Cut the meat from the bone — do not use the fat ; break the 
bones in halves, do not use the marrow. Put the meat and 
bones into a stock pot with five pints of cold water, a teaspoon- 
ful of salt will assist the scum to rise, boil quickly and remove 
scum as it rises, then simmer gently five hours. Cut carrots 
and turnips in slices, the head of celery and leek wash well and 
cut in squares, put the cauliflower in sprigs after washing. 
One hour before serving add vegetables ; the sprigs of cauli- 
flower can be put in fifteen minutes before serving. Put one 
gill of peas, a teaspoonful of salt, a quarter of a saltspoonful of 
soda into boiling water and boil fifteen minutes, then put peas 
in tureen and pour soup over them. 

6. GOOD GRAVY SOTJP.— Ingredients— l lb. of beef, 1 lb. 

of veal, 1 lb. of mutton, 6 quarts of water, 1 crust of bread, 
1 carrot, 1 onion, a little summer savory, 4 cloves, pepper, 
and a blade of mace. 

Cut the meat in small pieces and put into the water, with the 
crust oi bread toasted very crisp. Peel the carrot and onion, 
and, with a little summer savory, pepper, four cloves, and a

As soon as it boils skim it well, and then simmer it an hour 



Soups. mrs. Clarke's cookery book. 19 

and a half; then take the best end of the mutton, cut it into 
pieces (two bones in each), take some of the fat off, and put as 
many as you think proper ; skim the moment the fresh meat 
boils up, and every quarter of an hour afterwards. Have ready 
four or five carrots, the same number of turnips, and three 
onions, all cut, but not small, and put them in soon enough to 
get quite tender ; add four large spoonfuls of Scotch barley, 
first wetted with cold water. The meat should stew three 
hours. Salt to taste, and serve all together. Twenty minutes 
before serving put in some chopped parsley. It is an excellent 
winter dish. 

8. A nOAST BEEF AlTD BOILED TT7IISE7 S0T7F.- 

Ingredients — Bones of a turkey and beef, 2 or 3 carrots, 2 or 
3 onions, 2 or 3 turnips, ^ doz. cloves, pepper, salt, and 
tomatoes, 2 tablespoonfuls of flour, some bread. 

Take the liquor that the turkey is boiled in, and the bones 
of the turkey and beef ; put them into a soup-pot with two or 
three carrots, turnips, and onions, half a dozen cloves, pepper, 
salt, and tomatoes, if you have any ; boil it four hours, then 
strain all out. Put the soup back into the pot, mix two table- 
spoonfuls of flour into a little cold water ; stir it into the soup ; 
give it one boil. Cut some bread dice form, lay it in the bottom 
of the tureen, pour the soup on to it, and color with a little soy. 

9. VEAL OH LAMB SOUP.— Ingi-edients — Knuckle of veal, 

2 onions, 5 or 6 turnips, some sweet marjoram, salt and 
cayenne pej^er, flour, 6 or 8 potatoes, a few dumplings, 1

t3 boil in more than sufficient water to cover it. After boiling 
some time, pare, cut, and wash two onions, five or six turnips, 
and put in with the meat. When this has boiled one hour, add 
some sweet marjoram, rubbed fine, with salt and cayenne pep- 
per to taste. Then take flour, which mix with cold water to 
the consistency of cream, and add to the soup while boiling. 
Care must be taken not to make it too thick. Then pare and 
cut into small pieces six or eight potatoes, which add about 
half an hour before being served ; and about ten minutes before 
sending to table put in a few dumplings. As veal makes a 
white soup, the color is much improved by adding a table- 
spoonful of burnt sugan This soup may be thickened with 
rice, if preferable. 

10. PREITOH SOTJP— Ingredients— 1 sheep's head, 3 qta. of 

water, 1 bunch of sweet herbs, 1 teacupful of pearl barley, 6 
onions, 1 turnip, 1 carrot, few cloves, wineglass of white

before. Put it into a saucepan with three quarts of water, one 
teacupful of pearl barley, six onions, one turnip, one carrot, a 
bunch of sweet herbs, and a few cloves. Let it simmer gently 
for about five hours, then remove the head ; strain and rub 
the vegetables through a sieve, or leave them whole, accord- 
ing to taste. Let it stand all night, and when cold take off 
every particle of fat ; cut up the meat from the head into small 
pieces, and warm it up in the soup. Season to taste, add a 
wineglassful of white wine, a little mushroom ketchup, and 
thicken with butter and flour. This will be found very little in- 
ferior to mock turtle soup. 

11. &EEE!I SOUP.— Ingredients — 4 lbs. of lean beef," 1 lb. of 

lean mutton, 1 lb. of veal, 4 oz. of lean ham, 4 carrots, 4 

onions, I head of celery, a little soy, a few allspice and a few 

coriander seeds, some pepper and salt, 10 quarts of water.

throw into a stewpan with ten quarts of cold water ; add a 

little salt, and then place on the stove to boil ; take off the 

scum, add a little cold water, and take off the second scum ; 

then cut up the carrots, onions, and celery and throw in the 

pot ; add a little more salt, a few allspice, and coriander seeds ; 

let it simmer six hours, color the soup with a little soy, and 

strain it through a fine cloth ; take off any fat that may he on 

the soup with a sheet of paper ; before sending to table boil 

the soup, and place in the tureen a little fried lean ham cut 

into small pieces. 

12. GIBLET SOTTP.— Ingredients— 3 sets of ducks' giblets, 21bs. 

of beef, some bones, shank bones of two legs of mutton, 3 
onions, some herbs, pepper and salt, carrots, 3 quarts of wa- 
ter, J pint of cream, 1 oz. of butter, 1 spoonful of flour. 
Thoroughly clean three sets of ducks' giblets, cut them in 
pieces, and stew with two lbs. of beef, some bones, the shank 
bones of two legs of mutton, three small onions, some herbs, 
pepper and salt to taste, and carrots, for three hours in three 
quarts of water. Strain and skim, add one quarter pint of 
cream mixed with one ounce of butter kneaded with a spoon- 
ful of flour and serve with the giblets. (Only the gizzard should 
be cut.) 

13. CALF'S EEAD SOTJP- — Ingredients— 7 lbs. of shin of beef, 

a little lean ham, 5 qts. of water, 1 oz. of salt, savory herbs, 
1 onion, some celery, 3 carrots, 2 turnips, a little mace, 8 or 
10 cloves, some peppercorns, ^ calf's head, 8 oz. of fine rice 
flour, J teaspoonful of cayenne, some pounded mace, 2 glas- 
ses of sherry, some forcemeat. 
Stew seven lbs. of shin of beef with a little lean ham in five 
quarts of water till reduced one-half, adding, when boiling, 
one ounce of salt, savoury herbs, one onion, some celery, three 



Soups. mrs. Clarke's cookery book. 



carrots, two turnips, a little mace, eight or ten cloves, some 
peppercorns. It should gently boil seven hours and then be 
set aside for use. In this stock stew half a boned calf's head, 
rolled and tied with a string, half an hour ; let it cool in the 
liquor, strain and skim and heat five pints in a large saucepan 
with the flesh of the head cut into dice ; use all the skin and 
tongue but only part of the flesh. Simmer till quite tender, 
stirring in eight oz. of fine rice flour, one quarter teaspoon- 
ful of cayenne, pounded mace, and some more broth or 
water if thicker than batter. Boil ten minutes, add two glasses 
of sherry, and serve the soup with fried forcemeat. 

14. MULL AG- AT A WIT Y S0T7F. — Ingredients— Some good but- 

ter, 3 or 4 large onions, limbs of a rabbit or fowl, 5| phits 
of boiling stock, 2 tablespoonfuls of currie powder, and 3 of 
* browned flour, a little cold stock and meat, part of a pickled 

mango, some carefully boiled rice, the juice of a lemon. 
Slice and fry in some good butter three or four large onions ; 
put them in a saucepan with a little butter, and brown in it the 
limbs of a rabbit or fowl well floured. Add one quart of good 
boiling stock, and stew gently one hour. Pass the stock and 
onions through a strainer, add one and a half pints more stock, 
put it in a clean pan, and when boiling add two tablespoonsful 
of currie powder mixed with three of browned flour, a little 
cold stock and meat, and simmer 20 minutes. Part of a pick- 
led mango cut into shreds is often served with the soup, and 
some like the taste of freshly grated cocoa nut, but it is by no 
means generally admired. Send to table with carefully boiled 
rice. The juice of a lemon added before serving is an improve- 
ment. 

15. OYSTER SOnP A LA RBIITB.— Ingredients— 2 or 3 doz. 

small oysters, some pale veal stock, 2 qts. of stock, mace, 
cayenne, 1 pt. boiling cream. 
Two or three dozen small oysters to each pint of soup 
should be prepared. Take the beards and simmer them sepa- 
rately in a little very pale veal stock thirty minutes. Heat two 
quarts of the stock, flavor with mace and cayenne, and add 
the strained stock from the oyster beards. Simmer the fish in 
their own liquor, add to it the soup and one pint of boiling 
cream. Put the oysters in a tureen, pour over the soup, and 
serve. If not thick enough thicken with arrowroot or butter 
mixed with flour. 

16. CHICZEN SOUP (Brown). — Ingredients— One or two fowls, 

a bunch of herbs, 1 carrot, 1 onion, 2 oz. lean ham, 2 oz. of 

butter, pepper and salt, 2 quarts of good stock, and a little 

roux, a few allspice, a little grated nutmeg and mace. 

Cut up the carrot and oniun, and fry in 2 oz. of good butter 

a nice light brown, add the ham and fowls cut up small, taking 

2

care to break up the bones with a chopper, add the stock, and 
boil until the fowl is cooked to rags ; thicken with a little roux, 
add the allspice and mace and a little grated nutmeg, color 
with a little soy, add seasoning to taste. Serve with the soup 
some plain boiled rice. 

17. BEEP G-RAVY SOVP- — Ingredients— Some beef water, 2 

oz. of salt to every gal of water, 4 turnips, 2 carrots, some 
celery, 4 young leeks, 6 cloves, 1 onion, J teaspoonful of 
peppercorns, some savory herbs. 
Various parts of beef are used for this ; if the meat, after 
the soup is made, is to be sent to the table, rump steak or the 
best parts of the leg are generally used, but if soup alone is 
wanted, part of the shin with a pound from the neck will do 
very well. Pour colJ water on the beef in the soup pot 
and heat the soup slowly, the slower the better, letting it sim- 
mer beside the fire, strain it carefully, adding a little cold 
water now and then, put in two oz. of salt for every gallon of 
water, skim again, and put in four turnips, two carrots, some 
celery, four young leeks, six cloves stuck into an onion, half a 
teaspoonful of peppercorns, and some savory herbs ; let the 
soup boil gently for six hours ; strain. 

18. RICE-rLOTTR S0T7P.— Ingredients— A little cold broth, 8 

oz. of fine rice-flour, 2 qts. of fast boiling broth, mace, cay- 
enne and salt, 2 dessert spoonfuls of currie powder, juice of 
^ a lemon. 
Mix to a smooth batter, with a little cold broth, eight oz. of 
fine rice flour, and pour it into a couple of quarts of fast boil- 
ing broth or gravy soup. Add to it a seasoning of mace and 
cayenne, with a little salt if needful. It will require but ten 
minutes boiling. Two dessert spoonfuls of currie powder, and 
the strained juice of half a moderate sized lemon, will greatly 
improve this soup ; it may also be converted into a good com- 
mon white soup (if it be made of real stock) by the addition 
of three quarters of a pint of thick cream to the rice. 

19. MILE SOUP "WITH VERMICELLI.— Ingredients-Salt, 

5 pints of boiling milk, 5 oz. of fresh vermicelli. 
Throw a small quantity of salt into five pints of boiling 
milk, and then drop lightly into it five oz. of good fresh ver- 
micelli ; keep the milk stirred as this is added, to prevent its 
gathering into lumps, and continue to stir it very frequently 
from fifteen to twenty minutes, or until it is perfectly tender. 
The addition of a little pounded sugar and powdered cinna- 
mon makes this a very palatable dish. For soup of this de- 
scription, rice, semolina, sago, cocoa-nut, sago and maccaroni, 
may all be used, but they will be required in rather smaller 
proportions to the milk.

20. GREEN PEA SOUP.— Ingredients -4 lbs. of beef, ^ pk. of 

green peas, 1 gal. of water, ^ cup of rice-flour, salt, pepper 
and chopped parsley. 

Four lbs. beef, cut into small pieces, half a peck of green 
peas, one gallon water, half a cup of rice-flour, salt, pepper 
and chopped parsley ; boil the empty pods of the peas in the 
water one hour before putting in the beef. Strain them out, 
add the beef, and boil slowly for an hour and a half longer. 
Half an hour before serving, add the shelled peas, and twenty 
minutes later, the rice-flour, with salt, pepper and parsley. 
After adding the rice-flour, stir frequently, to prevent scorch- 
ing. Scrain into a hot tureen. 

21. CELERY SOTTP.— Ingredients— The white part of three 

heads of celery, half a lb. of rice, 1 onion, 1 quart of 
stock, 2 quarts of milk, pepper and salt, and a little roux. 
Cut up the celery and onions very small, boil them in the 
stock until quite tender, add the milk and the rice, and boil 
together until quite a pulp, add pepper and salt and a little 
roux, strain through a fine hair sieve or metal strainer, and 
boil a few minutes, taking care it does not burn. Serve some 
small croutons of fried bread with it. 

22. TOMATO S0T7P. — Ingredients — 4 lbs. of tomatoes, 2 

onions, 1 cai-rot, 2 quarts of stock or broth, pepper and salt, 
a little roux, 2 oz. of fresh butter. 

Cut up the onions and carrot, place them in a stewpan with 
the butter, and lightly fry them. Take the seeds out of the 
tomatoes, then put them in the stewpan with the fried onions 
and carrot, add the stock, pepper and salt, and let them boil 
for one hour, occasionally stirring them : add a little roux to 
thicken the soup, and strain through a fine hair sieve. Serve 
the soup very hot, and send to table with it some small pieces 
of fried bread, sprinkled with chopped parsley. 

23. WHITE SOUP-— Ingredients— 6 oz. of sweet almonds, 6 oz. of 

the breast of roasted chicken, 3 oz. of white bread, some veal 
stock, 1 pint of thick cream. 

Pound six oz. of sweet almonds, six oz. of the breast of roasted 
chicken, and three oz. of white bread soaked in veal stock and 
squeezed dry. Beat all to a paste and pour over it two quarts 
of boiling veal stock, strain through a hair sieve, add one pint 
of thick cream, and serve as soon as it is on the point of 
boiling. 

24. APPLE SOTTP. — Ingi-edients — 12 large fresh apples, 2 spoon- 

fuls of sugar or syrup, i lb of raisins or apples, 1 spoonful of 
potato meal. 
Dry well twelve large fresh apples, cut them in quarters, and 
put ihem mto a pan with boiling water. When the soup has a 



24 MRS. Clarke's cookery book. Soups. 

strong taste of apples, strain it through a hair sieve, and add 
more water, until there are about nine pints ; add two good 
spoonfuls of sugar or syrup, half a pound of well-washed and 
picked raisins, or apples pared and cut in pieces, which must 
be boiled until soft. The soup is to be thickened with a 
good spoonful of potato-meal, dissolved in a little water. It is 
best cold. 

25. SOUP A LA DATJPHIITE— Ingredients— Six pounds of lean 

beef, 4 carrots, 2 turnips, 4 onions, 1 head of celery, 4 oz. of 
lean ham, pepper and salt, a little soy, 2 bay leaves, a bunch 
of herbs, a few allspice, 2 blades of mace, 5 quarts of water. 

Cut up the onions, carrots, turnips, and celery into small 
pieces, and lay in the bottom of a large stewpan ; cut up the 
six lbs. of lean beef, and lay on the top of the vegetables, 
sprinkle a little salt over it, and cook over the fire (taking care 
it does not burn) for two hours, add five quarts of water, and 
bring it to the boil; take off the fat and scum, add a little more 
cold water, and throw in two blades of mace, two bay leaves, a 
bunch of herbs, four oz. of lean ham cut upvery fine, and a few 
allspice, color a light brown with a little soy, and simmer for 
five hours, and then strain through a fine cloth, and with a 
sheet of paper take off any floating fat ; boil again, and before 
serving throw in the soup some green taragon leaves and a 
little chervil. 

26. JTJLIENITE SOTTP- — Ingredients — 1 carrot, 1 turnip, 1 stick 

of celery, 3 parsnips, 2 or 3 cabbage leaves, butter, 1 lettuce, 
1 handful of sorrel and chervil, stock, salt and pepper. 
Cut in very small slices a carrot, a turnip, a stick of celery, 
three parsnips, and two or three cabbage leaves, put them in 
a saucepan with butter and give them a nice color, shaking the 
saucepan to prevent them from sticking to the bottom, then 
add a lettuce and a handful of sorrel and chervil torn in small 
pieces, moisten these with stock and leave them on the fire for 
a few minutes, then boil up, add the whole of the stock and 
boil gently for three hours ; season with salt and pepper. 

27. IdTTLLAGATAWlTT. — Ingredients — 1 chicken or rabbit, 

butter, flour, 2 qts. of veal stock, salt, white pepper, curry 

powder, cayenne pepper and salt, 1 large spoonfiil of rice, ^ 

pint of cream. 

Stew a chicken or a rabbit in a little butter until tender, and 

when done wash in warm water. Put a little butter and flour 

in another stewpan, stir for five minutes, theft add two quarts 

of good veal stock in which you have boiled carrots, turnips, 

celery and onions ; the stock being also flavored with salt and 

white pepper, and carefully skimmed and strained. Boil for 

fifteen nunutes, then add the chicken or rabbit cut in small 



Soups. mrs. clarke's cookery book. 25 

pieces, flavor with curry powder, cayenne pepper and salt, put 
in a large spoonful of rice, and boil until the rice is tender. 
Skim carefully, and before serving stir in half a pint of cream. 
The quantity of curry powder must depend upon taste ; two 
tablespoonfuls will probably be sufficient for this quantity of 
soup. 

28. gPANISH SQTTP (1).— Ingredients— U'lbs. of mutton or veal, 

IJ lbs. of garbanzos or chick peas, 1 slice of lean raw ham, 
remnants of game or poultry, a little bacon, salt, vegetables. 

Throw one lb. and a half of either mutton or veal in a ves- 
sel, with water (the Spaniards use a pipkin, called in the 
vernacular a " marmite,"), one lb. and a half of "garbanzos," 
or chick peas, one good slice of lean raw ham, and any debris 
(no matter how small) of game or poultry. Cook gently with 
the lid on, skim, and add a little bacon cut small, and as much 
salt as necessary ; cook for another hall-hour, then pour off the 
broth slowly, to be used afterwards for the soup and sauce ; 
add as much vegetable as you please, thoroughly well washed, 
and cook over a clear fire until done. About five minutes be- 
fore the 011a is ready, it is de rigueur in Madrid kitchens to 
throw in a piece of " chorizo " (black pudding). Serve the 
meat separately on one dish, the vegetables on another, and in 
a third the sauce for the whole, either of the following being 
appropriate. 

Tomato. — Cook three or four large juicy tomatoes until 
quite tender, and pass them through a sieve. Add some of 
the broth, some vinegar and salt, to the purde. 

Parsley. — Pound some young parsley and bread crumbs 
in a mortar. Moisten with the broth, add vinegar and salt to 
taste. 

These sauces should properly be served in a small silver or 
china bowl, surrounded by vegetables. For the tomato, spring 
and summer vegetables, and for the parsley sauce, those of 
autumn and winter are customarily used, with the rigorous ex- 
clusion, in both cases, of cabbage. 

A Cocido compounded of the above ingredients, without the 
auxiliary black pudding or vegetables, the Spaniards call a 
" Puchero," de los enfermas. 

29. SPANISH SOUP (2).— Ingredients— 1 clove of garlic, 7 well- 

dried beans or almonds, olive oil and water, vinegar and salt, 
breadcrumbs. . 

The second soup, Ajo bianco, or white garlic soup, is more 
intricate in its manufacture, though compounded of as quaint 
and unlikely materials. It is extensively eaten in Andalusia 
To be cempletely varacious, 1 must of necessity commence 
with that formidable brother to our harmless, necessary little

onion — big garlic. Pound one clove of garlic and seven well- 
dried beans, or better still, almonds, in a small spice mortar to 
a smooth paste. Moisten this paste with olive oil, drop by 
drop, then water by degrees, so as to thoroughly incorporate 
and amalgamate the whole. Add until it is sufficiently wet to 
soak some bread, which must be added later on, pouring in 
some vinegar and a little salt. Then put in the bread crumbs, 
size of half an almond, and allow it to soak. A final mixing 
of the bowl, and this quaint and perfectly national dish awaits 
your consumption. 

30. SPANISH SOTTP (3).— Ingredients— Chives, cucumber, some 

water, 1 pinch of salt, some lemon juice, some oil, crumbled 
bread, chopped marjoram. 

Put some chopped chives and cucumber cut up in the shape 
of dice into a large salad bowl, add a small quantity of waier, 
a pinch of salt, lemon juice and oil. Throw in some crumbled 
bread, which must be able to float. Finally sprinkle soojc 
fine chopped marjoram over the whole, and your "gaspacho" 
is ready. 

31. ALIdOlTD SOUF> — Ingredients — Some sweet almonds, pound- 

ed white sugar, pounded cinnamon, bread. 

This is the usual dish for a Christmas supper, and is eaten 
hot. It is of almost Arcadian simplicity. Throw some sweet 
almonds in boiling water to get rid of the husk, skin and pound 
them in a mortar with some lukewarm water, adding by de- 
grees pounded white sugar and pounded cinnamon ; turn it 
out on a plate or dish, which must be able to stand the fire, 
previously lining the bottom with fingers of bread powdered 
with cinnamon. Thoroughly heat these ingredients over a clear 
fire and serve. 

32. BARLEY SOUP (OREME D'ORGE).— Ingredients— i pint 

of pearl barley, 1 qt. of white stock, the yolk of I egg, 1 gill 
of cream, J pat of fresh butter, bread. 

Boil half a pint of pearl barley in a quart of white stock till 
it is reduced to a pulp, pass it through a hair sieve, and add 
to it as much well-flavored white stock as will give a purde of 
the consistency of cream ; put the soup on the fire, when it 
boils stir into it, off the fire, the yolk of an egg beaten up with 
a gill of cream ; add half a pat of fresh butter, and serve with 
small dice of bread fried in butter. 

33. LOBSTER SOTTP (B1SQT7E).— Ingredients— 1 lobster, but- 

ter, pepper, salt, and grated nutmeg, breadcrumbs, stock, 1 
tablespoonful of flour, bread. 

Pick out all the meat from a lobster, pound it in a mortar 
with an equal quantity of butter until a fine orange-colored 



Soups. mrs. clarke's cookery book. 27 

pulp is obtained ; to this add pepper, salt, and grated nutmeg 
to taste. Take as much bread crumbs as there is lobster pulp, 
soak them in stock, then melt a piece of butter in a saucepan, 
amalgamate with it a heaped tablespoonful of flour ; mix the 
lobster pulp with the bread crumbs, and put them into the 
saucepan with the butter and flour, stir well, and add more 
stock until a purde is obtained, rather thinner in consistency 
than the soup should be. Put the saucepan|on the fire, stirring 
the contents until they thicken and boil ; draw it then on one 
side, and carefully skim off superfluous fat, then strain the 
soup through a hair sieve, make it boiling hot, and serve with 
small dice of bread fried in butter. 

34. SOUF I^ADE FROM BOITES- — Ingredients — Bones of any 
freshly roasted meat, remnants of any poultry or game, 
fresh livers, gizzards, necks, combs of any poultry, 1 slice of 
lean ham, salt, 1 onion, 1 tui-nip, 1 leek, 1 head of celery, 4 
carrots, 3 tomatoes, J of bay leaf, 3 or 4 cloves, 6 pepper- 
corns, 3 allspice, 1 bunch of parsley and chevril, tapioca, sago, 
vermecelli or semolina. 
Have the bones of any freshly roasted meat — beef, veal, 
pork, venison, mutton or lamb — broken up into largish pieces, 
the four first sorts may be mixed with advantage, while mut- 
ton and lamb are better alone. Add the carcases or remain- 
ing limbs of any roast poultry — ducks, fowls, pigeons, geese, 
turkey or game, and the fresh livers, gizzards, necks, and 
combs of any poultry you happen to be going to cook the same 
day, and a slice of lean ham if you have it. Put all these 
together in an earthen soup pan that will stand the fire and 
will hold one-third more cold water than you require for 
your soup to allow for the loss in boiling ; fill with water, and 
place on a brisk fire till it boils. Then add salt (less quantity 
if there be ham in the soup), one large onion, one large tur- 
nip, one large leek, one head of celery, four large carrots, 
three sliced tomatoes, a quarter of a bay leaf, three or four 
cloves stuck into a carrot or turnip, six whole peppercorns, 
and as much more ground as is liked, three allspice whole, 
and, finally, a good-sized bunch of parsley and chevril tied to- 
gether. We find a piece of calf's liver and a fresh young cab- 
bage an improvement, but this is a matter of taste. When 
boiling skim thoroughly, and take the pot off the fire, placing 
it quite at the edge so as merely to simmer gently — or, as the 
French call it, to smile — for six hours at least. The great art 
in making this sort of simple broth is never to let the fire go 
down too much, nor to allow the soup to boil too fast, so as not 
to require filling up with other water to replace what has been 
consumed — or, rather, wasted by rapid ebullition. Half an 
hour before you require your soup take it off the fire and 



28 MRS. Clarke's cookery book. Soups. 

strain through a cullender, then through a fine sieve, and put 
it on a brisk fire. When quite boiling add tapioca, sago, ver- 
micelli, or semolina, scattering it lightly, and allowing one 
tablespoonful to each person. Rice may also be used, but it 
requires a full half hour, and consumes more broth. We use 
this broth as a foundation to every kind of vegetables purees. 

35. HARE SOITP.— Ingredients— 1 hare (newly killed), 1 lb. of 

lean beef, 1 slice of ham, 1 carrot, 2 onions, some herbs, 
roll crumbs, salt, pepper, 3 qts. water, ^ bottle port, the 
liver of the animal. 

For this purpose, if possible, a young newly-killed animal 
should be used ; in cleaning and skinning it preserve the 
blood and liver ; cut it in pieces and put it in a saucepan with 
one pound of lean beef, a slice of ham, a carrot, two onions, 
some herbs, the crumb of two rolls, some salt, pepper, and 
three quarts of water ; let it boil gently for eight hours ; add 
quaKter of a bottle of port ; chop the liver and mix it with 
the blood, and put the mixture into the saucepan, stirring well 
for a Httle while, then remove the pieces of hare, bone them 
and cut them in small pieces, pass the soup through a hair 
sieve and then put back the pieces of hare before serving. 

36. OXTAIL SOUP (Clear).— Ingredients— l oxtail, 4 carrots, 4 

onions, 2 turnips, 1 bunch of herbs, little allspice, 1 head of 
celery, 2 qts. of good stock, a little soy, 2 glasses of sherry, 
pepper, salt, ^ lb. of lean beef. 

Cut up the oxtail into small pieces, well blanch them in salt 
and water, boil them in water, throw into cold water. Cut up 
the vegetables into small pieces (taking care to save some of 
the best pieces for boiling to go in the soup to table), throw 
them into a stewpan with the herbs, allspice, soy, pepper and 
salt, put the oxtail on the top, cover with the gravy, and cook 
until the tail is quite tender. When cooked, take out the 
tail, and cut up half a pound of lean beef quite fine and throw 
in the gravy, let it boil a few minutes, and strain through a 
cloth, add the pieces of tail and some pieces of carrot and tur- 
nip cooked as follows : Boil the vegetables in water, with a little 
sugar, salt, and a small piece of butter. Serve very hot. 

37. OXTAIL SOUP (Thiols).— Ingredients— 1 oxtail, 6 carrots, 4 

onions, 4 turnips, allspice, 1 head of celery, 1 qt. of water, 1 

qt. of stock, a pinch of pepper, sugar and salt, a little sherry, 

some roux. 

Cut up the oxtail into small pieces, throw them into cold 

water with a little salt, bring them to the boil, and throw them 

into clean cold water. Cut up the vegetables into a stewpan, 

place the oxtail on the top, cover with the water and stock, let 

it_simmer until the oxtail is quite tender, take out the pieces 



Soups. mrs. clarke's cookery book. 29 



of tail, add the roux to the gravj', also the sugar and the sea- 
soning. Boil well together, strain through a fine hair sieve, 
taking care to pass the vegetable pulp through, add the sherry, 
drop in the pieces of tail, and bring to the boil. Let it stand 
on the side of the stove until wanted. 

38. MOCK TURTLE SOTTP.— Ingredients— A knuckle of veal, 2 

cow's heels, 2 onions, a few cloves, a little allspice, mace and 
sweet herbs, 2J qts. of water, 1 tablespoonful of sugar, 2 
tablespoonfuls of walnut, 1 of mushroom catsup, 1 table- 
spoonful of lemon juice, forcemeat balls. 

Put into a large pan or jar a knuckle of veal, two well- 
cleaned cow-heels, two onions, a few cloves, a little allspice, 
mace, and some sweet herbs ; cover all with two and a half 
quarts of water, and set it in a hot oven for three hours. Then 
remove it, and when cold take off the fat very nicely, take 
away the bones and coarse parts, and when required, put the 
remainder on the fire to warm, with a tablespoonful of moist 
sugar, two of walnut, and one of mushroom catsup ; add to 
these ingredients the jelly of the meat. When it is quite hot 
put in the forcemeat balls, and add a teaspoonful of lemon juice. 

39. MOCK TTTRTLE SOTJP.— Ingredients— ^ a calf's head, Jib. 

of butter, J lb. of lean ham, two tablespoonfuls of minced 
parsley, a little minced lemon thyme, a little sweet marjoram 
and basil, two onions, a few chopped mushrooms, 2 shallots, 
2 tablespoonfuls of flour, 1^ doz. forcemeat balls about the 
size of a nutmeg ; cayenne and salt, to suit your taste ; the 
juice of one lemon, and 1 Seville orange, 1 dessertspoonful of 
pounded sugar, 3 quarts of best stock. 
Proceed as in Recipe No. 38. 

40. ONION S0T7P. — Ingredients— Water that has boiled a leg or 

neck of mutton, 1 shank bone, 6 onions, 4 carrots, 2 turnips, 
salt to taste. 

Into the water that has boiled a leg or neck of mutton put 
(he carrots and turnips, shank bone, and simmer two hours, 
then strain it on six onions, first sliced and fried a light brown, 
simmer three hours, skim carefully, and serve. Put into it a 
little roll or fried bread. 

41. ALMOND SOTJP.— Ingredients — 4 lbs. of lean beef or veal, 

a few vegetables as for stock, 1 oz of vermicelli, 4 blades of 
mace, 6 cloves, ^ lb. sweet almonds, the yolks of 4 eggs, 1 
gill of cream, 3 qts. of water. 

Boil the beef or veal, vegetables, and spices gently in the 
water that will cover them, till the gravy is very strong, and 
the meat veiy tender; then strain off the gravy, and set it on 
the fiTe with the specified quantity of vermicelli to 2 quarts. 
Let boil till sufficiently cooked. Have ready the almonds, 
blanched and pounded very fine ; the yolks of the eggs boiled 



30 MRS. CLARKE'S COOKERY BOOK. SOUPS. 

hard ; mixing the almonds, whilst pounding, with a little of the 
soup, lest the latter should grow oily. Pound them to a pulp 
and keep adding to them, by degrees, a little soup, until they 
are thoroughly mixed together. Let the soup be cool when 
mixing, and do it perfectly smooth. Strain it, set it'on the fire, 
stir well and serve hot ; just before taking it up add the cream. 

42. EELSOTTP.— Ingredients— 3 lbs. of eels, 1 onion, 1 oz. of but- 

ter, 3 blades of mace, 1 bunch of sweet herbs, ^ oz. of pepper- 
corns, salt, 2 tablespoonfuls of flour, ^ pt. cream, 2qts.water. 
Wash the eels, cut them into thin slices and put them in the 
stew-pan with the butter; let them simmer for a few minutes, 
then pour the water to them, and add the onion cut in small 
slices, the herbs, mace and seasoning. Simmer till the eels are 
tender, but do not break the fish. Remove them carefully, mix 
flour smoothly to a batter with the cream, bring it to a boil, 
pour over the eels, and serve. 

43. TOMATO SOUP.— Ingredients— 8 middling sized tomatoes, 

1 bundle of sweet herbs, 1 clove of garlic, 1 onion stuck with 
3 or 4 cloves, a little allspice, whole pepper, salt to taste, 1 
qt. of stock, 2 eggs. 
Take tomatoes, cut them in twc, and removing the pips of 
watery substance, put them in a saucepan, with a bundle of 
sweet herbs, a clove of garlic, an onion stuck with three or four 
cloves, some allspice, whole pepper, and salt to taste. Place 
the saucepan on a gentle fire, stirring contents occasionally. 
When the tomatoes are thoroughly done, turn them out on a 
hair sieve, remove the onion, garlic, and sweet herbs ; remove 
also the moisture which will drip from the tomatoes ; then 
work them through the sieve until nothing remains on the top 
but the skins. Have a quart of plain stock boiling hot, stir 
the tomato pulp into it, and, removing the saucepan from the 
fire, stir in two eggs, beaten up with a little cold water and 
strained. Serve over small dice of bread fried in butter. 

44. ASPARAGUS SOUP.— Ingredients— 25 heads of asparagus,

pan with a quart of stock, free from fat, let them boil till quite 
done ; remove the asparagus, pound it in a mortar, then pass 
it through a sieve ; mix a tablespoonful of flour and one ounce 
of butter in a saucepan on the fire, add a little sugar, pepper 
and salt, quantity sufficient for the asparagus pulp, and the 
stock in which the asparagus was originally boiled ; let the 
whole come to a boil, then put in a little spinach greening, and 
lastly a pat of fresh butter, or stir in a gill of cream. Serve 
over small dice of bread fried in butter. 



FISH. 

OBSERVATIONS ON DRESSING FISH. 

If the fishmonger does not clean it, fish is seldom very 
nicely done, but those in great towns wash it beyond what 
is necessary for cleaning, and so by much washing diminish 
the flavor. If to be boiled, some salt and a little vinegar 
should be put in the water to give firmness ; but cod, whit- 
ing, and haddock are far better if salted and kept a day : 
and if not very hot weather they will be better kept two 
days. Those who know how to purchase fish, may by tak- 
ing more than they want for one day, often get it cheaper ; 
and such kinds as will pot or pickle, or keep by being 
sprinkled with salt, and hung up, or being fried will serve 
for stewing the next day, may then be bought with ad- 
vantage. Fresh water fish have often a muddy smell and 
taste, to take off which soak it in strong salt and water after 
it is nicely cleaned, then dry and dress it. The fish must 
be put in the water while cold and set to do very gently, or 
the outside will break before the inner part is done. Crimp 
fish should be put into boiling water, and when it boils up 
put a little cold water in, to check extreme heat, and simmer 
it a few minutes. Small fish nicely fried, covered with egg 
and crumbs, make a dish far more elegant than if served 
plain. Great attention should be paid to the garnishing of 
fish, use plenty of horse-radish, parsley and lemon. If fish 
is to be fried or broiled it must be wrapped in a clean 
cloth after it is well cleaned. When perfectly dry, wet with 
an egg (if for frying) and sprinkle the finest bread crumbs 
over it, then, with a large quantity of lard or dripping boiling 
hot, plunge the fish into it and fry a light brovi^n ; it can 
then be laid on blotting paper to receive any grease. 
Butter gives a bad color, oil fries the finest color for those 
who will allow for the expense. Garnish with raw or fried 
parsley,, which must be thus done : when washed and picked 
llirow it again into clean water ; when the lard or dripping 
boils, throw the parsley into it immediately from the water 

31 



33 MRS. Clarke's cookery hook. Fish. 

and instantly it will be green and crisp, and must be taken 
up with a slice. If fish is to be broiled, it must be seasoned, 
flavored and put on a gridiron that is very clean, which 
when hot should be rubbed with a piece of suet to prevent 
the fish from sticking. It must be broiled on a very clear 
fire and not too near or it may be scorched. 



45. COD'S HEAD AND SHOULDERS (to Boil).— Ingredients 

—1 cod's head and shoulders, salt water, 1 glass of vinegar, 

horseradish. 
Wash and tie it up, and dry with a cloth. Salt the water, 
and put in a glass of vinegar. When boiling, take off the 
scum; put the fish in, and keep it boiling very briskly about 
half an hour. Parboil the milt and roe, cut in thin slices, fry, and 
serve them. Garnish with horse-radish ; for sauce, oysters, 
eggs, or drawn butter. 

46. COD'S HEAD AND SHOTTLDERS.— Ingredients— 1 bunch 

parsley, 1 lemon, horseradish, milt, roe and liver. 

Tie it up, and put on the fire in cold water which will com- 
pletely cover it ; throw a handful ot salt into it. Great care 
must be taken to serve it without the smallest speck of black 
or scum. Garnish with a large quantity of double parsley, 
lemon, horseradish, and the milt, roe and liver, and fried 
smelts if approved. If with smelts, be careful that no water 
hangs about the fish ; or the beauty of the smelts will be taken 
ofT, as well as their flavor. Serve with plenty of oyster or 
shrimp sauce, and anchovy and butter. It will eat much finer 
by having a little salt rubbed down the bone, and along the 
ttiick part, even if to be eaten the same day. 

Though it is important to buy fresh codfish, it is not quite 
so well to cook it immediately, as, when freshly caught, it is 
apt to be watery ; but when rubbed with salt and kept a day 
or two, it acquires the firmness and creaminess so much prized. 
Cod is better crimped than when cooked whole, the operation 
of boiling being more successfully performed under these con- 
ditions. The fish may be partially crimped by scoring it at 
equal distances, without absolutely cutting it through into 
slices; but the effect of the operation is always to 
improve the fish. When thoroughly cleaned the cod should 
be scored or sliced at regular intervals of about one and a 
half or two inches, then washed clean in spring-water, and 
laid in a pan of spring-water in which a hanHful of salt has 
been allowed to dissolve. After about two hours' soaking in 
this brine, the fish may be washed and set to drain. Some 
people boil the cod whole; but a large head and shoulders 



Fish. mrs. clarke's cookery book. 33 

contain all the fish that is proper to help, the thinner parts 
being overdone and tasteless, before the thick are ready. But 
the whole fish may be purchased at times more reasonably ; 
and the lower half, if sprinkled and hung up, will be in high 
perfection in one or two days. Or it may be made Salter, and 
served with egg-sauce, potatoes and parsnips. 

47. SALT COD.— Ingredients — Cod, vinegar (1 glass), parsnips, 

cream, butter, flour. 
Soak and clean the piece you mean to dress, then lay it all 
night in water, with a glass of vinegar. Boil it enough, thtn 
break it into flakes on the dish ; pour over it parsnips boiled, 
beaten in a mortar, and then boiled up with cream and a large 
piece of butter rubbed with a little flour. It may be served as 
above with egg sauce instead of the parsnip, and the root sent 
up whole ; or the fish may be boiled and sent up without flak- 
ing, and sauces as above. 

48. OTJHUIE OP COD- — Ingredients - Salt and cayenne, cod, 

onions, white gravy, currie powder, butter, flour, ,3 or 4 
spoonsful of cream. 
Should be made of sliced cod, that has been either crimped 
or sprinkled a day to make it firm. Fry it of a fine brown with 
onion ; and stew it with a good white gravy, a little currie 
powder, a piece of butter and flour, three or four spoonfuls of 
rich cream, salt, and cayenne, if the powder be not hot enough.

eggs, a small teaspoonful of salt, a pinch of cayenne pepper, a 
grate of nutmeg, and a dessert-spoonful of tomato or Mogul 
sauce, or the vinegar from any good pickle. Mix all well to- 
gether, and stir it over the fire for two or three minutes to 
thicken. Dip the slices of cod's roe in this sauce to take up as

light brown in butter or lard. They should be fried to the 
same color on both sides. 

51. CRIMPED COD AlTD OYSTER SATTOE. -Ingredients- 

Cod and salt water. 

Cut into two-inch slices the best part of a fresh cod, boil

serve on a napkin with the sauce in a tureen. 

52. COD STAKES (with Hock Oyster Sauce).— ingredients 

1 tail of cod or head and shoulders, salt, and breadcrumbs. 
The most economical way of having cod steaks is to order 
either the tail of a good-sized cod or a cod's head and shoulders, 
so cut that there is sufficient to take oft'some steaks, and what 
remains comes in for luncheon or the children's dinner the fol- 
lowing day. Sprinkle the cod with salt, and fry, either with or 
without bread crumbs, a golden brown.

wash, clean, and put on to boil. When half done change the 
water ; and when tender, drain it, put it in a stone pan, sprin- 
kle some cayenne, whole allspice, a few cloves, and a little mace 
over each piece ; cover with cold vinegar. This makes a nice 
relish for tea.

whole with common salt after scaling it ; let it hang for 24 
hours to drain. Pound three or four ounces of salt-petre, 
according to the size of the fish, two ounces of bay-salt, and 
two ounces of coarse sugar ; rub these, when mixed well, into 
the salmon, and lay it on a large dish or tray two days, then 
rub it well with common salt, and in 24 hours more it will be 
fit to dry; wipe it well after draining. Hang it either in a 
wood chimney or in a dry place ; keeping it open with two 
small sticks. Dried salmon is eaten broiled in paper, and 
only just warmed through ; egg-sauce and mashed potatoes 
with it ; or it may be boiled, especially the piece next the head. 

58. SALMOIT (Dried)-" — Ingredients — Flakes of salmon, 2 eggs, 

1 pint cream, 2 or 3 oz. butter, 1 teaspoonful of flour, mashed 

potatoes. 
Pull some into flakes; have ready some eggs boiled hard, 
and chopped large ; put both into half a pint of thin cream, 
and two or three ounces of butter rubbed with a teaspoonful

thirty-five minutes in a warm oven ; when cooked, serve with 
sauce made as follows: Cut up one shalot very fine, and lightly 
fry in two oz. of butter, throw in a little chopped parsley, two 
gherkins chopped fine, and a few capers and mushrooms cut 
up very fine, and one pint of good stock, a little roux to thicken, 
and one tablespoonful of anchovy sauce and a little pepper; 
boil these ingredients together for thirty minutes, lift the salmon

it), pour the boiling sauce over it, aud serve very hot. 

61. FRESH SALMOIT (to Boil)-— Ingi'sdients— Fresh salmon, 

salt, water. 
This fish needs more boiling, in more water, than any other 
fish. It is not wholesome unless thoroughly done. Make the 
water quite salt ; boil, skim, then put in the salmon. Continue 
to skim. For each half pound allow fifteen minutes. Lobster, 
egg, or drawn butter for sauce. 

62. WHITING-S (Fried)-— Ingredients— Whitings, egg, bread- 

crumbs. 
Dip them in egg and bread-crumbs and fry a clear golden 
brown. Serve on a napkin, with shrimp or lobster sauce in a 
tureen. 

63. LOESTEHS (to Boil)- — Ingredients — Lobsters, salt water, 

salad oil. 
The heaviest are best. Put them alive into a kettle of salt- 
ed boiliftg water, and let thern boil from half an hour 
to three quarters, according to size. Then wipe them, and rub 
the shell with a little salad oil : this will give them a clear red 
color. Crack the large claws without mashing them, and with 
a sharp knife split the body and tail from end to end. 

64. LOBSTEHS (Potted). — Ingredients — Lobsters, mace, white 

pepper, nutmeg and salt, butter. 
Half boil them, pick out the meat, cut it into small pieces, sea- 
son with mace, white pepper, nutmeg and salt, press close 
into a pot, and cover with butter, bake half an hour; put the 
epawn in. When cold, take the lobster out, and put it into 
the pots with a little of the butter. Beat the other butter in a 
mortar with some of the spawn ; then mix that colored butter 
with as much as will be sufficient to cover the pots, and strain 
it. Cayenne may be added if approved. 

65. LOBSTERS (Potted as at Queen's Hotel)-— Ingredients- 

Lobster, mace, nutmeg, white pepper, salt, 1 or 2 cloves, 

butter, bay leaves. 
Take out the meat as whole as you can ; split the tail and re- 
move the gut ; if the inside be not watery, add that. Season 
with mace, nutmeg, white pepper, salt, and a clove or two in 



Fish. mrs. Clarke's cookery book. 37 

the finest powder. Lay a little fine butter at the bottom of a 
pan, and the lobster smooth over it, with bay leaves between, 
cover it with butter, and bake gently. When done, pour the 
whole on the bottom of a sieve ; and with a fork lay the pieces 
into potting-pots, some of each sort, with the seasoning about 
h. When cold, pour clarified butter over, but not hot. It will 
be good next day ; or if highly seasoned, and thick covered 
with butter, will keep some time. Potted lobster may be used 
cold, or as a fricassee, with cream sauce : and then it looks 
very nicely, and eats excellently, especially if there is spawn. 

66. LOBSTER (to Dress). — Ingredients — 1 lobster, salt, cayenne, 

mustard, salad oil, and vinegar. 

After mincing it very fine, add salt, cayenne, mustard, salad 
oil, and vinegar, to taste ; mix these well together. 

67. LOBSTER CROQUETTES.— Ingredients— l lobster, pepper, 

salt, spices, cayenne, a piece of butter, 1 tablespoouful of 
flour, 1 bunch of parsley, fish stock, 2 eggs, breadcrumbs, 
Mince the flesh of a lobster to the size of small dice, season 
with pepper, salt, spices, and as much cayenne as will rest on 
the point of a trussing needle. Melt a piece of butter in a sauce- 
pan, mix with it a tablespoouful of flour, then the lobster, and 
some chopped parsley ; moisten with a little fish stock until 
the mixture looks like minced veal ; then stir into it off the fire 
a couple of yolks of eggs, and put it by to get cold. When 
nearly so, shape it into the foim of corks, egg them, and roll 
them in baked breadcrumbs. After the lapse of an hour, c^cr 
and breadcrumb them again, taking care to preserve the shape. 
After a little time fry them a light colour in hot lard. 

68. LOBSTER CROQUETTES-— Ingredients— lobster, pepper, 

salt, powdered mace, bread criunb3,2tablespoonfuls of butter, 
egg, biscuit, paraley. 

To the meat of a well-boiled lobster, chopped fine, add pep- 
per, salt, and powdered mace. Mix with this one quarter as 
much bread-crumbs, well rubbed, as you have meat ; make 
into pointed balls, with two tablespoonfuls of butter melted. 
Roll these in beaten egg, then in biscuit powdered fine, and fry 
in butter or very nice sweet lard. Serve dry and hot, and gar- 
nish with crisped parsley. This is a delicious supper dish or 
entree. 

69. PISH PATE.— Ingredients— lib. of cold fish, ^Ib. of butter, 

4oz. of bread crumbs, 1 whole egg, 3 yolks, 21bs. of fresh fish, 
anchovy, sliced trutfles, oil, pepper, salt, and spices, 1 glass 
of rum or Madeira. 

The following is a French receipt for making a fish pat^.

ing, etc., quite free from bones and skin; pound it in a mortar 
adding half-pound of butter and lour ounces of bread-crumbs 
soaked in milk and dried on the fire ; season with salt and pep- 
per, and then pound the whole till well mixed, adding a whole 
egg, and the yolks of three more. Take two pounds of fresh 
tunny fish, remove the skin and cut it into slices about one 
inch thick and three long, placing on each a thin strip of an- 
chovy and some sliced truffles ; let these soak for some hours 
in oil seasoned with pepper, salt, and ditTerent spices. Place 
in a pie dish a layer two inches thick of the pounded fish, then 
above this half the slices of tunny; repeat these two layers, 
and at the top put another layer of pounded fish, and above 
this a thin layer of butter. Then put on the crust, glazing it 
with the yolic of an egg, cook for three or four hours, accord- 
ing to the size of the pie, pouring in when done a glass of rum 
or Madeira through the hole in the crust. Serve cold. The 
pounded fish and bread crumbs will make very nice fish cakes, 
mixed with beaten-up egg, and fried in oil or butter. 

70. CBAB (Hot). — Ingredients — 1 good sized crab, pepper, salt' 

bread crumbs, milk, cream, or oiled butter, parsley. 

For this, one good-sized crab, or three or four small ones, 
may be used. The meat must be picked from the claws and 
the soft inside from the body ; season with pepper and salt, add 
a small quantity of breadcrumbs, and moisten with milk, or, bet- 
ter still, a few spoonfuls of cream or oiled butter. When well 
mixed, put it into the large shell, strewing fresh breadcrumbs 
over the top, and sprinkling some oiled butter over these ; let 
it remain in the oven just long enough to get hot through and 
to be a nice golden-brown colour. It should be served very hot 
on a napkin garnished with parsley. 

71. CHABS (Loiled)- — ingredients — Crabs, salt water, sweet oil. 
Boil them in salt and water twenty minutes ; take them out, 

break off the claws, wipe the crabs, throw away the small 
claws, and crack the large ones and send to table. Rub a 
little sweet oil on the shells. 

72. CRAB (MOCkDreSSed).— Ingredients— I tin of lobster, bread 

crumbs, 4 eggs, 2 tablespoonfuls of cream and 1 of liquid 
essence of shrimps, 1 dessertspoonful of made mustard, cay- 
enne, white pepper, vinegar, salt, 1 tablespoon of Parmesan. 
Drain the liquid from a tin of fresh lobster, and divide the 
flesh into small flakes with a couple of forks. Should there be 
any coral amongst it set it aside for garnish. Boil four fiew 
laid eggs for three minutes ( the whites must be like curd ). 
Scoop the whites and yolks from the shell and mix them to- 
gether in a basin with two tablespoonfuls each of thick cream 
and the liquid from the lobster. Add a tablespoonful of grated 



Fish. mrs. Clarke's cookery book. 39 

Parmesan, a tablespoonful of essence of shrimps, a dessert- 
spoonful of made mustard, cayenne, white pepper, vinegar, and 
salt to taste. Stir in the lobster flakes and mix all well together. 
One large, or two or three small, crab shells must be kept 
ready for this. Fill them with the above, cover the opening with 
fine breadcrumbs, and sprinkle it with the coral, or, failing that, 
a few slices of red capsicums. If a hot dish is preferred, place 
the basin containing the lobster, etc., in a saucepan of boiling 
water, and stiruntil it is hot enough, then put it into the shells, 
cover with the breadcrumbs and little pieces of butter. Brown 
these with a hot salamander, sprinkle with the coral and serve 
quickly. Omit the vinegar for this, or use very little. This is 
an excellent imitation of dressed crab, and makes a very use- 
ful luncheon or supper dish to those who live far from a fish 
market. 

73. SOFT CRABS.— Ingredients— Crabs, salt, cayenne, butter. 

Take off the claws, wash, wipe, and open them ; and, after 
removing the spongy part and sand-bag, season in and outside 
with salt and cayenne. Then close them, and fry in fresh 
butter a light brown. Send to table hot. 

li, OYSTERS (Ste'Wed)- — Ingredients — oysters, a piece of mace, 

some lemon peel, a few white peppers, cream, butter, and 

flour. 

Open and separate the liquor from them, then wash them 

from the grit ; strain the liquor, and put with the oysters a piece 

of mace and lemon-peel, and a few white peppers. Simmer 

them very gently, and put some cream, and a litle flour and 

butter. Serve with sippets. 

75. OYSTERS (Boiled). 

Let the shells be nicely cleaned first, and serve in them, to 
eat with cold butter. 

76. OYSTERS ( Scalloped ).— Ingredients— crumbs of bread, 

pepper, salt, nutmeg, a piece of butter. 
Put them with crumbs of bread, pepper, salt, nutmeg, and a 
piece of butter, into scallop-shells or saucers, and bake in 
oven, or better still before the fire in a Dutch oven. 

77. OYSTERS (Broiled). — Ingredients — Large, fat oysters, salt, 

cayenne pepper, biscuit dust or flour, butter. 

Choose large, fat oysters ; wipe them very dry ; sprinkle salt 
and cayenne pepper upon them, and broil upon one of the small 
gridirons sold for that purpose. You can dredge the oyster 
with biscuit-dust or flour, if you wish to have it brown ; and 
some fancy the juices are better kept in this way ; others dis- 
like the crust thus formed. Butter the gridiron well, and let 



40 MRS. Clarke's cookery book. Fish. 

your fire be hot and clear. If the oysters drip, withdraw the 
gridiron for a moment, until the smoke clears away. Broil 
quickly and dish hot, putting a tiny piece of butter, not larger 
than a pea, upon each oyster. 

78. OYSTERS (rried, to garnisli 1:01164 Pish).— ingredients 

— flour, milk, eggs, seasoning, nutmeg, bread crumbs. 
Make a batter of flour, milk, and eggs, season it a very little, 
dip the oysters into it, and fry them a fine yellow-brown. A 
little nutmeg should be put into the seasoning, and a few 
crumbs of bread into the flour. 

79. OYSTERS (Stewed).— Ingredients— Liquor from 2 qta. of 

oysters, 1 teacupful of hot water, salt, pepper, 2 tablespoons- 

ful of butter, 1 cupful of milk. 
Drain the liquor from two quarts of firm, plump oysters ; 
mix with it a small teacupful of hot water, add a little salt and 
pepper, and set over the fire in a saucepan. Let it boil up 
once, put in the oysters, let them boil for five minutes or less 
— not more. When they "ruffle," add two tablespoonsful of 
butter. The instant it is melted and well stirred in, put in a 
large cupful of boiling milk, and take the saucepan from the 
fire. Serve with oyster or cream biscuits, as soon as possible. 
Oysters become tough and tasteless when cooked too much or 
left to stand too long after they are withdrawn from the fire. 

80. OYSTER SATJSAG-ES— Ingredients— 1 doz. large oysters, 

^ lb. rump steak, a little seasoning of herbs, pepper and salt. 

Chop all fiine, and roll them into the form of sausages. 

81. ANG-ELS OIT HORSEBACK.— Ingredients- Oysters, bacon. 
Trim the beards from as many oysters as may be required, 

wrap each in a very thin shaving of fat, streaky bacon (cold 
boiled bacon is the best) ; run them one after the other on to a 
silver skewer, and hold them over a toast in front of a clear 
fire until the bacon is slightly crisp; serve on the toast imme- 
diately. 

82. CREAM OYSTERS OIT THE HALF-SHELL- -Ingre- 

dients — Hot water (1 cup), 1 cup of cream, 1 cup of milk, a 
little salt, 2 tablespoonsful of butter, white pepper, 2 table- 
spoonsful of arrowroot, rice flour, or com starch, cold milk. 

Pour into your inner saucepan a cup of hot water, another 
of milk, and one of cream, with a little salt. Set into a kettle 
of hot water until it boils, then stir in two tablespoonsful of 
butter and a little salt, wilh white pepper. Take from the fire, 
and add two heaped tablespoonsful of arrowroot, rice flour, or 
corn starch, moistened with cold milk. By this time your 
shells should be washed and buttered, and a fine oyster laid 



Fish. mrs. clarke's cookery book. 41 

within each. Of course, it is selon les tegles to use oyster 
shells for this purpose ; but you will find scollop-shells more 
roon>y and manageable, because more regular in shape. 
Range these closely in a large baking-pan, propping them with 
clean pebbles or fragments of shell, if they do not seem in- 
clined to retain their contents. Stir the cream very hard, and 
fill up each shell with a spoon, taking care not to spill any in 
the pan. Bake five or six minutes in a hot oven after the 
shells become warm. Serve on the shell. Some substitute 
oyster liquor for the water in the mixture, and use all milk in- 
stead of cream. 

83. OYSTER PATTIES— Ingredients— Oysters, paste. 

Make a rich paste, roll it out half an inch thick, then turn a 
teacup down on the paste, and, with the point of a sharp pen- 
knife, mark the paste lightly round the edge of the cup. Then, 
with the point of the knife, make a circle about half an inch 
from the edge ; cut this circle halfway through. Place them 
on tins, and bake in a quick oven. Remove the centre, and 
fill with oysters, seasoned and warmed over the fire. 

84. SHAD AND HERRIira (to Pot).-Ingredients-A shad, 

salt, cayenne, allspice, cloves, 1 stick of cinnamon, cider 

vinegar. 
Clean the shad, take off the head, tail, and all the fins ; then 
cut it in pieces, wash and wipe it dry. Season each piece well 
with salt and cayenne. Lay them in layers in a stone jar ; 
place between each layer some allspice, cloves, and stick of 
cinnamon. Cover with good cider vinegar ; tie thick paper 
over the jar ; place them in a moderate oven for three or four 
hours. 

85. RED HERRIIT&S (to Dress). — Ingredients — Herrings, 

small beer, butter. 

Choose those that are large and moist, cut them open, and 
pour some boiling small beer over them to soak half an hour; 
drain them dry ; make them hot through before the fire, then 
rub some cold butter over them and serve. Egg-sauce, or but- 
tered eggs and mashed potatoes, should be sent up with them. 

86. BAKED HERRIN&S OR SPRATS.-Ingrcdients-Her- 

rings, allspice, salt, black pepper, 1 oniou and a few bay 

leaves, vinegar. 
Wash and drain without wiping them ; season with all- 
spice in fine powder, salt, and a few whole cloves ; lay them in 
a pan with plenty of black pepper, an onion, and a few bay- 
leaves. Add half vinegar and half small beer, enough to 
cover them. Put paper over the pan, and bake in a slow oven. 
If you like, throw saltpetre over them the night before, to 
make them look red. Gut, but do not open them. 



42 MRS. Clarke's cookery book. Fish. 

87. BLOATEH TOAST. — Ingredients— 2 or 3 bloaters, butter, 

hot buttered toast, black pepper. 

When bloaters are in season, split open two or three, rub 
them over with fresh butter, and make them hot through in the 
frying pan ; serve them on fingers of hot buttered toast, with a 
slight sprinkling of black pepper over each. The heads and tails 
should be removed before cooking. 

88. PEHOH AND TENCH. 

Put them into cold water, boil them carefully and serve with 
melted butter and soy. Perch is a most delicate fish. They 
may be either fried or stewed, but in stewing tliey do not pre- 
serve so good a flavor. 

89. TROUT AND GRAYLINCS- (to Fry.) 

Scale, gut, and wash well ; then dry them, and lay them 
separately on a board before the fire, after dusting some flour 
over them. Fry them of a fine color with fresh dripping ; 
serve with crimp parsley, and plain butter. Perch and tench 
may be done the same way. 

90. TROTTT a-la-G-ENEVOISE.— Ingredients— pepper, salt, a 

few cloves, crust of French bread, bunch of parsley and 

thyme, flour, butter. 
Clean the fish very well ; put it upon your stew-pan, adding 
half Champagne and half Moselle, or Rhenish, or sherry wine. 
Season it with pepper, salt, an onion, a few cloves stuck in it, 
and a small bunch of parsley and thyme ; put in it a crust of 
French bread ; set it on a quick fire. When the fish is done 
take the bread out, bruise it, and then thicken the sauce ; add 
flour and a little butter, and let it boil up. See that your 
sauce is of a proper thickness. Lay your fish on the dish, and 
pour the sauce over it. Serve it with sliced lemon and fried 
bread. 

91. PEHOH AND TROUT (to Broil). 

Split them down the back, notch them two or three times 
ncross, and broil over a clear fire ; turn them frequently, and 
baste with well-salted butter and powered thyme. 

92. MACKEREL. 

Boil, and serve with butter and fennel. 

To broil them, split, and sprinkle with herbs, pepper, and 
salt ; or stuff with the same, crumbs, and chopped fennel. 

Potted: clean, season, and bake them in a pan with spice, 
bay-leaves and some butter ; when cold, lay them in a potting- 
pot, and cover with butter. 

Pickled: boil them, then boil some of the liquor, a few pep- 
pers, bay-leaves, and some vinegar ; when cold, pour it over 
thein. 



Fish, mrs. Clarke's cookery book. 43 

93. MAiCKBREL (Pickled, called Oaveaoli).— ingredients— 

yix mackerel, 1 oz. of pepper, 2 uutinegs, a little mace, 4 

cloves, 1 handful of salt. 
Clean and divide them ; then cut each side into three, or 
leaving them undivided, cut each fish into five or six pieces. 
To six large mackerel, take near an ounce of pepper, two nut- 
megs, a little mace, four cloves, and a handful of salt, all in 
the finest powder ; mix, and making holes in each piece of fish, 
thrust the seasoning into them, rub each piece with some of 
it ; then fry them brown in oil: let them stand till cold, then 
put them into a stone-jar, and cover with vinegar ; if to keep 
long, pour oil on the top. Thus done, they may be preserved 
for months. 

94. MACKEREL (Scalloped)-— Ingredients— Mackerel, | pint of 

shrimps, inilk, corutiour, soy, walnut, mushroom catchup, 'es- 
sence of auchovies, gi'ated lemon peel, nutmeg, cayenne, white 
pepper, salt, lemon juice, bread crumbs, capers, vinegar. 
Boil as many mackerel as you require, and, while they are 
still hot, remove from them all bones and skin and divide the 
flesh into small flakes, shell half a pint of shrimps (for two 
mackerel), and mix them with the fish ; simmer the shells and 
mackerel trimmings for twenty minutes, with just sufficient 
water to cover them. Strain the liquid into a fresh saucepan, 
and add to it enough new milk to make your quantity of sauce. 
Thicken this to the consistency of thick cream with corn flour, 
and flavor it delicately with essence of anchovies, soy, walnut 
and mushroom 'catchup, grated lemon peel and nutmeg, cayenne, 
white pepper, and salt if required ; stir to this sufficient lemon 
juice to give an agreeable acid, and mix well with the fish. 
Put this mixture into china or silver, scallop shells, or on a 
flat dish, and cover thickly with fine breadcrumbs ; moisten 
these slightly with liquid butter and brown in a quick oven or 
before a clear fire. Scald a few capers in their own vinegar, and 
just before serving the scallop drain and sprinkle them over it. 
The remains of any cold fish may be served like this with great 
advantage : also tinned salmon, etc Cod, fresh haddock, and 
soles are best flavored with oysters instead of shrimps. 

95. MU'LLET (Baked). — Ingredients — 1 mullet, pepper and salt,

to side until the fish is well covered with flour. Transfer it to 
a frying basket; shake it gently to get rid of the superfluous 
flour. Have a panful of boiling lard, try it with a small piece 
of bread ; if the fat hisses sharply, and the bread colors at 
once, the fat is hot enough ; plunge the basket into it, and 
never cease shaking until the whitebait is cooked (two or three 
minutes). Turn the fish out on a napkin in front of the fire, 
and t]irinkle it freely with salt at the time of serving. It is a 
good plan, when practicable, to have two pans of boiling fat, 
and when the whitebait has been cooked in the one, to take it 
out, drain it, and plunge it for a second or two in the other 
pan, the fat in which should be boiling hot.

POULTRY AND GAME. 



OBSERVATIONS. 

The following is translated from a German cookery 
book : — 

" In Vienna, especially in the hotels, young chickens are 
killed immediately before they are wanted, plucked and 
cleaned as quickly as possible before the flesh becomes 
cold, otherwise it would be tough. They are cut up into 
joints and sprinkled with salt ; each piece must then be 
dipped into flour, and then into egg and grated bread 
crumbs, and fried immediately ; or they may be dipped 
first into butter, and then into bread crumbs mixed with a 
little flour. This method admits of no delay in performance 
if the whole flavor of the meat is to be preserved and the 
gravy kept in ; but in private houses the chickens are gene- 
rally allowed to hang a day or two, to ensure their being 
tender." 

In choosing ducks, be careful to secure those with plump 
bellies and thick and yellowish feet ; and to ensure them 
being tender, it is advisable to let them hang a day or two. 

In choosing turkeys, the hen turkey is preferable for boil- 
ing, on account of their whiteness and tenderness. 

Partridges in perfection will have dark colored bills and 
yellowish legs ; the time they should be kept entirely depends 
upon the taste of those for whom they are intended, as 
what some people would consider delicious, to others would 
be disgusting and offensive. Young hares may be known 
by their smooth and sharp claws, and the cleft in the lip not 
much spread. It is preferable to hang without being 
paunched, but should it be previously emptied, wipe the in- 
side every day and sprinkle over it a little ginger and 
pepper. 

Rabbits when young have smooth and sharp claws. 

In selecting a goose, choose one with a clean white skin, 
plump breast and yellow feet. Charcoal is considered as 
an admirable prevention for decomposition.

some shreds of pork or ham, then a layer of hard boiled eggs, 
a little butter and pepper. Take the biids from the fire, 
sprinkle with pepper and minced parsley. Squeeze lemon 
juice upon them, and upon the breasts of the birds a few pieces 
of butter rolled in flour. Cover with slices of egg, then shred 
some ham and lay upon this. Pour in a little of the gravy in 
which the quails were parboiled, and put on the lid. Leave a 
hole in the middle and bake a little over one hour. 

135. QUAILS (EoasteA, -Trith Sam). 

Prepare the birds as you would grouse, but cover the ham or 
pork with a sheet of paper, having secured the meat with 
pack thread. Stitch the papers on, and keep well basted with 
butter and water. Roast three quarters of an hour. Remove 
papers and meat before dishing, and brown quickly. This is a 
iavorite way of crooking quails. 

136. HABBIT FIE- — Ingredients — 2 rabbits, J lb. of fat pork, 4 

eggs, pepper, butter, a little powdered mace, a few drops of 

lemon juice, puff paste. 

Cut a pair of rabbits into ten pieces, soak in salt and water 

half an hour and simmer until half done, in enough water 

to cover them. Cut a quarter of a pound of pork into slices* 

and boil four eggs hard. Lay some pieces of pork in 



Poultry. mrs, clarke's cookery book. 55 

the bottom of the dish, the next a layer of rabbit. Upon this 
spread sHces ot boiled egg and pepper and butter. Sprinkle, 
moreover, with a little powdered mace, a few drops of lemon 
juice upon each piece of meat. Proceed in this manner until 
the dish is full, the top layer being pork. Pour in water in 
which the rabbit was boiled ; when you have salted it and 
added a few lumps of butter rolled in flour, cover with puff 
paste, make a hole in the middle and bake for one hour. 
Cover with paper if it'should boil too fast. 

137. HABBIT (Stained).— Ingredients— 1 rabbit, salted water, 

dripping or butter, flour, six onions. 

Cut a rabbit in pieces, wash it in cold water, a little salted- 
Prepare in a stewpan some flour, and clarified dripping or 
butter ; stir it until it browns. Then put in the pieces of rabbit, 
and keep stirring and turning, until they are tinged with a little 
color ; then add six onions, peeled, but ^ot cut up. Serve all 
together in a deep dish. 

138. A GERMAN DISH-— Ingredients— A tender fowl, salt, 

pepper, mace, flour, yolk of 1 egg, hot lard, liver, gizzard, 
parsley. 

Quarter a tender fowl, season the pieces with pepper" and 
salt and mace ; flour, and then dip them in the beaten-up yolk 
of an egg ; fry a golden color in hot lard ; dish them, garnished 
with the liver and gizzard fried separately, and with fried pars- 
ley. Serve either with a salad garnished with hard-boiled eggs 
or tomato sauce. 

139. GIBLETS (to SteTT).— Ingredients— Salt and pepper, but- 

ter, 1 cup of cream, 1 teaspoonful of flour. 

Do them as directed for giblet-pie (under the head PIES) ; 
season them with salt and pepper, and a very small piece of 
mace. Before serving give them one boil with a cup of cream,, 
and a piece of butter rubbed in a teaspoonful of flour. 

140. PIGEONS. 

May be dressed in so many ways, that they are very useful. 
The good flavor of them depends very much on their being 
cropped and drawn as soon as killed. No other bird requires 
so much washing. Pigeons left from dinner the day before 
may be stewed or made into a pie ; in either case care must be 
taken not to overdo them, which will make them stringy. 
They need only be heated up in gravy, made ready, and force- 
meat-balls may be fried and added, instead of putting a stuff- 
ing into them. If for a pie, let beef-steaks be stewed in a 
little water, and put cold under them, and cover each pigeon 
with a piece of fat bacon, to keep them moist. Season as usual, 
and put eggs. 



56 MRS. CLARKE'S COOKERY BOOK. GaME, 

141. PIQ-EOITS (to BroU)- — Ingredienta— Pigeons, pepper and 

salt, ttewed or pickled muahrooins, butter.

Si.;le, 

142. PieEONS (Roast). 

Should be stuffed with paraley, either cut or whole ; and sea- 
soned within. Serve with parsley and butter. Peas or aspar- 
agus should be dressed to eat with them. 

143. TX7IIZE7 (to Boast). 

The sinews of the legs should be drawn, whichever way it is 
dressed. The head should be twisted under the wing ; and 
in drawing it, take care not to tear the liver, nor let the gall 
touch it. Put a stuffing of sausage meat ; or, if sausages are 
to be served in the dish, a bread stuffing. As this makes a 
large addition to the size of the bird, observe that the heat of 
the fire is constantly to that part ; for the breast is often not 
done enough. A little strip of paper should be put on the 
bone to hinder it from scorching while the other parts roast. 
Baste well and froth it up. Serve with gravy in the dish, and 
plenty of bread-sauce in a sauce-tureen. Add a few crumbs, 
and a beaten egg to the stufi&ng of sausage-meat.

fat bacon, and over that a sheet of buttered paper; put in oven, 
basting frequently with butter. A quarter of an hour before it 
is done, remove the paper and slices of bacon. Sprinkle with 
• salt just before serving. Garnish with pork sausages, and serve 
with a tureen of gravy. Time of roasting, two or three hours, 
according to size. 

145. BRAISED TTTRKET- — Ingredients — 1 turkey, truffle,

nut stuffing. Line the bottom of a braising pan with slices of 
bacon, lay the turkey on these, and place more slices of bacon 
on the top of it. Put in two carrots and two onions cut in slices, 
some sweet herbs, parsley, bay leaf,a clove of garlic and whole 
pepper and salt to taste ; moisten with some stock and a 
tumblerful of sherry. Lay a round of buttered paper on the top, 
put on the lid, and braise with a moderate fire for about four

add a very small quantity of flour and the trimmings of the 
truffles chopped coarsely ; moisten with some good stock free 
from fat, and a little white wine, season with pepper, salt, and 
the least piece of nutmeg. Let the sauce simmer about ten min- 
utes, and it is ready. 

148. TUnSEY (PixUed). 

Divide the meat of the breast by pulli'ig instead of cutting ; 
then warm it in a spoonful or two of white gravy, and a little 
cream, grated nutmeg, salt, and a little flour and butter ; don't 
boil it. The leg should be seasoned, scored, and broiled, and 
put into the dish with the above round it. Cold chicken does 
as welL 

149. Q-AME (Ohaudfroid).— Ingredients— 2 birds, a piece of 

ham or bacon, 1 onion, 1 carrot, 1 oz. of butter, 1 bundle of

pint of good ordinary stock ; let the whole gently simmer over 
an hour, then strain, and carefully remove all fat ; mix a little 
butter and flour in a saucepan, and stir them on the fire till the 
mixture browns, then gradually add the liquor and a cupful 
of unclarified aspic jelly. If at hand, a cupful of w-ell-made 
Spanish sauce may be used instead of the thickening of butter 
and flour. Roast two partridges, and when cold divide them 
into joints ; trim each joint neatly, removing the skin from it ;

dip them in the above sauce, made hot for the purpose, and if, 
when cooled, the pieces of partrid::jes are not well covered over 
with it, repeat the operation. Arrange the pieces pyramidally 
on a dish, with a border of chopped-up aspic jelly round them. 
The wings and breasts cut from the birds used to make the 
sauce can be served in various ways in the form of fillets, and 
the legs can also be utilized, either to make a stew, or for the 
stock pot. 

]50. GAME (Aspic).— Ingredients— Butter, pepper, salt, breasts 
of a brace of birds, forcemeat. 

Cut the breasts of a brace of birds into fillets, cook them 
in the oven, smothered in butter, in a tin with pepper and 
bait, and put them between two plates under a weight to get 
cold. With the rest of the flesh of the birds make a forcemeat 
as follows : pound it in a mortar with an equal quantity of lean 
veal ; add as much butter as there is game meat, and as much 
breadcrumbs soaked in stock and squeezed dry ; mix the whole 
thoroughly well in the mortar, then pass the mixture through a ■ 
sieve ; return it to the mortar ; work into it one tablespoonful 
of Spanish sauce or chaudfroid sauce, pepper and salt, 
a little powdered sweet herbs or spices, then the yolks of 
two and the white of one egg. Put this composition into a 
plain buttered mould, steam it for half an hour, and turn it out. 
When cold cut in slices, and cut the slices into rounds all of a 
shape ; cut all the fillets to the same size ; cut also some ready 
cooked truffles into slices ; set some white of egg in a jam pot 
placed in a saucepan full of boiling water, turn it out, cut it in 
slices, and from them cut pieces all of a size. Pour a little 
well-flavored aspic jelly into a mould ; when it begins to set 
arrange the above materials in it, filling up with jelly until the 
mould is full, and when quite set turn it out.

MEATS. 

OBSERVATIONS ON MEAT. 

In purchasing beef secure meat of a deep red color, 
with the fat mingled with the lean, giving it a mottled ap- 
pearance. The fat will be firm, and the color resembling 
grass butter. The smaller the breed, so much sweeter the 
meat. It will be better for eating if kept a few days. 
Veal, lamb and pork (being white meat), will not keep more 
than a day or two. 

Beef — For roasting, the sirloin and rib pieces are the 
best. The chief object is to prevent the escape of the 
juices, and if you are roasting in an oven, it is a very good 
plan to throw a cup of boiling water over the meat when 
first put in the oven. This will prevent the escape of the 
juices for a while, aod will thoroughly warm through the 
meat. 

Mutton- — Choose this by the fineness of its grain, 
good color, and firm white fat. It is not the better for 
being young ; if of a good breed and well fed, it is better 
for age ; but this only holds with wether-mutton : the flesh 
of the ewe is paler, and the texture finer. Ram-mutton is 
very strongly flavored ; the flesh is of a deep red, and the fat 
is spongy. 

LftSS!!}' — Observe the neck of a fore-quarter ; if the vein 
is bluish, it is fresh ; if it has a green or yellow caste it is 
stale. In the hind quarter, if there is a faint smell under 
the kidney, and the knuckle is limp, the meat is stale. If 
the eyes are sunken, the head is not fresh. Grass-lamb comes 
in season in April or May, and continues till August. 
House- Lamb may be had in great towns almost all the 
year, but is in highest perfection in December and January. 

Pork- — Pinch the lean, and if young, it will break. If 
the rind is tough, thick, and cannot easily be impressed by 
the finger, it is old. A thin rind is a merit in all pork. 
When fresh, the flesh will be smooth and cool ; if clammy 

6i 



62 MRS. Clarke's cookery book. Beef. 

it is tainted. What is called measley pork is very unwhole- 
some, and may be known by the fat being full of kernels, 
which in good pork is never the case. Pork fed at still- 
houses does not answer for curing any way, the fat being 
spongy. Dairy-fed pork is the best. A sucking pig, to be 
eaten in perfection, should not be more than three weeks 
old, and should be dressed the same day it is killed. 

Voal' — Veal should be perfectly white ; if purchasing 
the loin, the fat enveloping the kidney should be white and 
firm. Veal will not keep so long as an older meat, es- 
pecially in hot or wet weather. Choose small and fat veal. 
It is in season from March to August. 

TripO- — This requires to be well cooked and nicely 
served, and then it is both light and nutritious, and can 
often be eaten by invalids, or persons having a delicate di- 
gestion. Choose a nice white piece ; wash it well, and put 
into a stew-pan with sufficient milk and water in equal parts 
to cover it ; let it simmer gently for about half an hour 
after it has boiled up. Serve with white sauce, omitting 
the parsley, and garnish the dish with slices of 
beetroot. Onion sauce may be substituted if preferred, or 
it may be served simply with a little of the liquor in which 
it has been cooked poured over it, and some plainly boiled 
Spanish onions handed round in a vegetable dish.

them with pepper and salt, and fry them in some very hot 
butter, turning them to let both sides take color. Stone a 
quantity of olives, and parboil them. Fry some onions a brown 
color in butter, add a little flour, and, when that is colored, as

and put into it as much highly-flavored rich stock or gravy as 
will come up to the grenadins without covering them. Cover 
the pan, and place it in the oven to braise gently for an hour. 
Then remove the cover, baste the grenadins with the gravy, 
and let them remain uncoversd in the oven till the larding has 
taken color; they are then ready. Take equal quantities of

68 MRS. Clarke's cookery book. Beef. 

178. BEEP (BraizedL)- — Ingredients — 1 cupful of stale bread, 

pepper and salt, a tablespoonful of onion, 2 tablespoonfuls of 

dripping, 1 tablespoonful of flour. 
Buy a piece of the flank that gives a strip about three times 
as long as it is wide, so that it can be rolled up easily. Trim 
off any tough, outer skin which may seem too hard to cook, 
wipe the meat all over with a damp towel, and lay it flat on the 
table with the outside down ; season it highly with salt and 
pepper ; make a stuffing by soaking a cupful of stale bread in 
cold water until it is soft, and then squeeze it in a towel to 
free it from the water ; season it highly with salt and pepper, 
mix with a tablespoonful of onion, and spread it over the beef, 
then roll up the beef without displacing the stuffing, and tie it 
tightly with cord ; let two tablespoonfuls of drippings or bacon 
fat get hot in the bottom of a saucepan just large enough to 
contain the beef, then brown the beef in the drippings, over a 
hot fire ; when it is brown dust over it a tablespoonful of flour, 
turning the beef about until the flour is quite brown, and then 
cover the meat with boiling water, and season the gravy thus 
made with pepper and salt ; next put on the cover of the sauce- 
pan, and if it does not fit steam-tight, seal it with a thick paste 
of flour and water, and set it where its contents will cook slowly 
for three hours. At the expiration of that length of time the 
meat will probably be tender ; the strings can then be removed, 
and the beef served with the gravy in which it was cooked. 

179. BEEP (Steered)- — Ingredients — 1 tablespoonful of butter, 

2 sliced onions, 12 whole cloves, allspice, J teaspoonful of 
salt, J teaspoonful of black pepper, 1 pint of cold water, 2 or 

3 lbs of tender beef, a little flour, a few sprigs of sweet basil. 
In a stew-pan place a large tablespoonful of butter", in which 

fry until quite brown two sliced onions adding, while cooking, 
twelve whole cloves ; ditto allspice ; half a teaspoonful of salt, 
and half that quantity of black pepper ; take from the fire 
pour in a pint of cold water, wherein lay two or three pounds 
of tender lean beef cut in small, thick pieces; cover closely, 
and let all stew gently two hours, adding, just before serving, 
a little flour thickening. A few sprigs of sweet basil is an 
improvement. 

ISO. HUNTER'S BEEP.— Ingredients— To a round of beef that 

weighs 25 lbs, take 3 ounces of saltpetre, ? oz of the coarsest 

sugar, 1 oz. of cloves, 1 nutmeg, ^ an oz. of allspice, 3 hand- 

fuls of common sjilt, all in the finest powder. 

The beef should hang two or three days ; then rub the above 

well into it, and turn and rub it every day for two or three 

weeks. The bone must be taken out at first. When to be 

dressed, dip it into cold water, to take off the loose spice, bind 

it up tightly with tape, and put it in a pan with a teacupful of 



Beef. mrs. clarke's cookery book. 69 

water at the bottom ; cover the top of the meat with shred suet, 
and the pan with a brown crust and paper, and bake it fiv e 
or six hours ; when cold, take off the paste and tape. The 
meat should be cut with a very sharp knife, to prevent waste. 

181. BASED OZ TONCrUE. — Ingredients— 2 eggs, a few cloves, 

6 oz. of bread-crumbs, ^Ib. of butter, ^ pt. of good gravy, 
a glass of wine, red currant jelly. 

Soak the tongue well in lukewarm water for about twelve 
hours, scrape and trim it, stick it over with cloves (about 
twenty-four), and boil slowly according to size for two or three 
hours. Then take it up and brush it over with the yolks of 
two eggs and sprinkle it with bread-crumbs (6oz.), Next bake 
it to a good brown, beating it constantly with a quarter of a 
pound of butter. Put it on a dish, and pour round it half a 
pint of good gravy with a glass of wine. Serve with red 
currant jelly. 

182. BHAIZED gTB Ag . — Ingredients — Slices of bacon, steak, 

an oz. of butter, carrot, turnip, onion, a bay leaf, a blade of 
mace, small piece of lemon peel, ^ pt. of good brown stock or 
a teaspoonful of extract of beef. 
For this the meat should be well bung and tender, and about 
an inch in thickness. First cut off all the fat and lay it aside, 
then lard the steak by drawing tiny slices of bacon through it. 
Put loz. of butter in a frying-pan and fry the steak in this for 
about a minute, this is to keep in the juices of the meat ; 
then put into a stewpan two or three small slices of 
each of the. following : carrot, turnip, and onion, together with 
a bay leaf, a blade of mace, and a small piece of lemon peel ; 
add half a pint of good brown stock (this is the quantity for 
about fib. of meat), and stew gently three-quarters of an hour. 
If no stock is at hand, a teaspoonful of extract of beef dissolv- 
ed in water will answer the purpose. Before dishing up, cut 
up about the quarter of a small carrot, ditto turnip, into small 
strips ; boil them till tender, then drain and place on the steak 
when serving. The gravy in which the meat is cooked should 
be carefully strained over it, and for garniture, besides the 
vegetables already mentioned, it should have the fat, which 
must be cut into small dice, and fried for the purpose, 

183. BIFSTECE SAUTE- — Ingredients — Steak, pepper and flour, 

butter, cold water, or stock flavored with mushroom catchup, 
a teacupf ul of chopped parsley, a dessertspoonful of lemon 
juice. 
Have your steak cut not more than an inch thick, and beat 
it thoroughly with a meat bat until the fibre is quite divided- 
Sprinkle it with pepper, and flour it thickly on both sides. Melt 
buUerin a deep frying or saut^ pan to thinly cover the bottom

of it, and when it is quite hot put in the steak, and just scald it 
on both sides for a second or two, and then pour in from time 
to time a little cold water or stock well-flavored with mush- 
room catchup. The steak will take from twenty to twenty-five 
minutes to cook, according to whether it is liked with the 
gravy in it or not, and during that time it must be constantly 
attended to, turned every two or three seconds, and kept all 
the time just gently simmering. If all these directions are 
carefully followed, you will have a steak as tender as it should 
be when well stewed, with the additional advantages of re- 
taining its own juices and being quickly prepared. For a steak 
of 2lbs. boil a teacupful of chopped parsley to look quite green, 
and mix with it quickly ^oz. of butter and a dessertspoonful 
of lemon juice. Arrange this in little heaps upon the steak, 
which should be served on a hot water dish. Pour some of the 
gravy round it, and send the remainder to table in a tureen. 
This is a useful dish for "parlor cookery," being easily pre- 
pared on an ordinary spirit stove. Instead of the parsley, 
button mushrooms stewed in butter can accompany the steak, 
which, to vary the flavor, may be first steeped for an hour or 
two in a marinade of oil and vinegar, flavored with a little 
French mustard, shalot, vinegar, and allspice; one part vinegar 
to two of oil should be used, and the steak allowed to lie in it 
on a flat dish for an equal time for each side. A cutlet from a 
leg of mutton is very good cooked as above, and fillets from the 
undercut of a sirloin, are excellent. French fried potatoes, or 
potatoes mashed and browned are improvements to these 
dishes. Thick brown oyster or brown soubise sauce may be 
spread over the steak ; and a mutton cutlet looks well and is 
very nice bordered with tomatoes halved, sprinkled with 
pepper and salt, and fried in butter, or it may be served with 
capers scalded with vinegar and sprinkled over it. 

184. BEEF TOUaiTE. 

If it has been dried and smoked before it is dressed it should 
be soaked over night, but if only pickled a few hours will be 
sufficient. Put it in a pot of cold water over a slow fire for 
an hour or two before it comes to a boil ; then let it simmer 
gently for from three to four hours, according to its size : 
ascertain when it is done by probing it with a skewer. Take 
the skin oS^ and before serving surround the root with a paper 
frilL

PORK. 

185. LE& OF FOZtZ (to Beast). 

Choose a small leg of fine young pork; cut a slit in the 
knuckle with a sharp knife, and fill the space with sage and 
onion chopped, a little pepper and salt. When half done, 
score the skin in slices, but do not cut deeper than the outer 
rind. Apple sauce and potatoes should be served to eat 
with it. 

1S6. LSa OF POBE (to Soil). 

Salt it eight or ten days : when it is to be dressed, weigh it ; 
let it lie half an hour in cold water to make it white ; allow a 
quarter of an hour for every pound, and half an hour over, 
from the time it boils up : skim it as soon as it boils, and fre- 
quently after. Allow water enough. Save some of it to 
make peas-soup. Some boil it in a very nice cloth, floured, 
which gives a very delicate look. It should be small and of a 
fine grain. Serve peas-pudding and turnips with it. 

187. LOZIT AUD ITECK OF FOBS. 

Roast them. Cut the skin of the loin across, at distances 
of half an inch, with a sharp penknife,

over the inside; then roll the meat as tight as you can, and 
roast it slowly. 

190. POBK PIE.— Ingredients— :i lb. of lard, 1 lb. of pork (leg 

or loin), seasoning, 1 lb, of flour and an egg, ^ glass of cold 
water. 

Put the lard and water in rather a large saucepan ; place

or it will catch fire). Cut the pork into pieces about an inch 
square ; when the lard and water are quite boiling pour into 
the middle of the flour and mix with a spoon. When the 
paste is cool enough knead it well ; it must be rather stiff; cut 
off a quarter of the paste, and the remainder mould into the

shape of a basin, pressing it inside ; shape it evenly all round, 
it should be about the third of an inch in thickness ; dip the 
pieces of pork into cold water, seasoning well with pepper and 
salt, then place them in the mould of paste as closely as pos- 
sible. If liked a little chopped sage can be sprinkled over the 
pork, then take the rest of the paste, roll it, and cut to the size 
of the top of the mould ; taking care to have it the same 
size as the inside ; break an egg, and divide the yolk from 
the white; with a paste brush dip into the white of egg, and 
brush the edge of the paste ; then place this on the top of the 
pie, pressing the edges well. Any trimmings of paste that are 
left, cut into little leaye?, dip into the white of egg, and stick 
them on top of the pie ; then wet the pie all over with the 
yolk of the egg and bake for about two hours. 

191. PIG^S FRT- — Ingredients — 1 lb. of pig's fry, 3 lbs. of pota- 

toes, 1 onion, sage and seasoning. 

Put the potatoes into cold water, scrub and wash them 
well ; then place them in a saucepan of cold water and put 
upon the fire to boil ; directly they boil, take them out 
of the water, peel, and cut them into slices ; peel the onion 
and chop it and two or three sage leaves together ; cut the 
pig's fry into small pieces ; grease a dish, and put a laj^er of the 
potatoes in the bottom ; then sprmkle a little of the sage and 
onion, pepper and salt, then a layer of the pig's fry ; then 
another sprinkling of the seasoning, and so on until the dish is 
full, then put in a little water ior gravy; the skin usually sent 
with pig's fry put over the top of the dish; if the skin is not 
sent, take a piece of whity brown paper and grease it and 
place upon the dish instead. Bake for about one hour, 

192. POEK (Pickled). 

The quantities proportioned to the middlings of a pretty 
large hog, the hams and shoulders being cut off. 

Mix, and pound fine, four ounces of salt-petre, a pound of 
coarse sugar, an ounce of sal-prunel, and a little common salt : 
sprinkle the pork with salt and drain it twenty-four hours; 
then rub with the above ; pack the pieces tight in a small deep 
tub, filling up the spaces with common salt. Place large 
pebbles on the pork to prevent it from swimming in the pickle 
which the salt will produce. If kept from air, it will continue 
very fine for two years. 

193. pons (HasllSfl.)- — Ingredients — Some remnants of cold 

roast pork, pepper and salt to taste, 2 onions, 2 blades of 

mace, 1 teaspoonful of flour, 1 teaspoonful of vinegar, 2 

cloves, i pint of gravy. 

Take the onions, chop and fry them of a nice brown ; then

lar that they are thoroughly done ; dish, sprinkle with a 
little salt, and serve plain, or with tomato sauce. 

195. STTOEIITG- PIG (Roast).— Ingredients— pig, '8 oz. of bread- 

crumbs, 18 sage leaves, pepper and salt, tablespoonful of but- 
ter, salad oil to baste with, tablespoonful of lemon juice, ^ 
pint of gravy. 

Stuff the pig with finely grated bread-crumbs, minced sage, 
pepper and salt, and a tablespoonful of butter. Take care 
these are well blended. After stuffing the pig, sew up the slit 
neatly, truss the legs back, to allow the inside to be roasted, 
put in oven, and directly it is dry h^.ve ready some butter tied 
in a piece of thin cloth, and rub the pig with this in every part. 
Continue this operation several times while roasting ; do not 
allow the pig to burn in any part. Tlien take half a pint of 
gravy, a tablespoonful of lemon juice, and the gravy that 
flowed from the pig, ; pour a little of this over the pig, and the 
remainder send to table in a tureen. Instead of butter for bast- 
ing many cooks use salad oil as this makes the crackling crisp. 
Before dishing cut off the head and part the body down the 
middle, and lay on the dish back to back. Take care that it is 
sent to table very hot, and serve with apple sauce. It will take 
about two hours for a small pig to roast. 

196. PIG-'S PETTITOES.— Ingredients— A slice of bacon cut

bacon, mace, peppercorns, onion, thyme and gravy ; simmer 
gently for fifteen minutes ; take out the head and liver and 
mince very finely ; allow the feet to stew until quite tender, 
they will take about half an hour, then return to the saucepan 
the liver, thicken the gravy with a little butter and flour, 
sprinkle a little pepper and salt, and simmer very gently for 
five or six minutes, stirring occasionally ; when ready to dish 
split the feet, and arrange them round the mince with 
sippets of toasted bread, and pour the gravy in the centre. 



74 MRS. Clarke's cookery book. Pork. 

197. PORK CHEESE.— Ingredients— About 2 lbs. of cold roast 

pork, a dessertspoonful of chopped-up parsley, 5 sage leaves, 
pepper and salt, a bunch of savory herbs, 2 blades of mace, a 
little nutmeg, ^ teaspoonful of minced lemon peel, sufficient 
gravy to fill the mould. 

Cut the pork into pieces, but do not chop ; there should be 
about a quarter of fat to a pound of lean ; sprinkle with pepper 
and salt, pound the spices thoroughly and mince as finely as 
possible, the parsley, sage, lemon peel and herbs : then mix 
all this nicely together. Place in mould and fill with gravy.

clean : or the meat may be kept in a very small pan, closely 
covered ; and so rolled and dusted with a very little flour be- 
fore it is fried. Serve on stewed red cabbage ; or mashed pota- 
toes, put in a form, brown with a salamander, and garnish with 
the above ; they must be pricked with a fork before they are 
dressed, or they will burst. 

199. HAM (how to Boil to give it an esceUsnt flavor).— in- 

gredients — 2 heads of celery, 2 turnips, vinegar and water, a 

large bunch of savory herbs, and 3 onions. 
In choosing a ham, be sure that it is perfectly sweet. To as- 
certain this stick a sharp knife into it near the bone, when the 
knife is taken out, it will have an agreeable smell if the meat is 
sweet. If the meat has been hung for a long time, and it is salt 
and dry, it would be necessary to soak for twenty-four hours, 
and change the water often. Put the meat in a large pot with 
sufficient water to cover it ; bring it to the boil gradually , and 
carefully take off the scum as it rises ; when on the point of 
boiling add the vegetables and herbs ; let it simmer gently 
until quite tender, then take it out, strip off the skin, cover 
with bread raspings and put a paper frill round the knuckle. 
Four hours will be sufficient for a ham weighing ten pounds. 

200. HAM (Potted) —Ingredients— 2| lbs. lean ham, | lb. of fat, 1 

teaspoonful of pounded mace, a saltspoonful of pounded 
allspice, \ nutmeg, clarified butter, pepper.

ham to a fine paste in a mortar; gradually add the seasoning, 
and take care that all the ingredients are well mixed, press the 
mixture into pots, cover with the clarified butter and keep it 
cool. 



Pork. mrs. clarke's cookery book. 75 

201. HAM (Baked)- — Ingredients — Ham, cmst. 

Allow the ham to soak in water for twelve hours ; wipe it 
dry, and trim any rusty places underneath ; cover with a com- 
mon crust, taking care that it is thick enough to keep the 
gravy in ; have the oven at a moderate heat and bake for 
about four hours ; when done, take off crust and skin, cover 
with raspings, and garnish the knuckle with a paper frill. 
Very good. 

202. TO GLAZE A HAM.— Ingredients— An egg, salt, melted 

butter, a cup of powdered cracker, a little, cream. 

After the ham is skinned and cold, brush all over with beaten 
egg ; mix the cracker, salt, and melted butter with cream 
enough to make a thick paste ; spread it evenly over the ham 
and brown in a moderate oven. 

203. TO MAZE LABD. 

Take the inner part of the pig, put into a stone jar, and place 
in a saucepan of boiling water ; allow it to simmer gently, and 
as it melts, strain carefully from the sediment ; put in small 
jars and keep in a cool place. The fleed makes exceedingly 
light crust, and is Tcry wholesome. 

204. TRIPE (To Dress). — Ingredients— Tripe, milk and water, 

onion sauce. 

Cut away the coarsest fat, take equal proportions of milk and 
water, and boil for three quarters of an hour. Have ready some 
onion sauce and when ready to dish, smother the tripe with the 
sauce, and, any that is left, send to table in a tureen. 

205. FRIED TRIFE' — Ingredients — Salt and water, pepper, flour, 

lard, a tablespoonful of vinegar. 

Scrape the tripe well ; cut into squares the size of your hand ; 
boil in salt and water (a tablespoonful of salt to one quart of 
water) till very tender. The next day cut into smaller pieces, 
season with salt and pepper, dredge with flour, fry brown on 
both sides in a pan of hot lard. When done, take it out, pour 
nearly all the lard out, add a good gill of boiling water, thicken 
with flour,mixed smooth with a tablespoonful of vinegar; season 
to taste, and pour hot over the tripe. A nice breakfast dish. 

Tripe may be cooked several ways, it can be stewed in gravy 
with mushrooms, or cut into collops, sprinkled with chopped 
onion and savoury herbs, and fried a nice brown in clarified 
butter. 

206. TRIPE (Sterred). — ingredients — 2 quarts of water, pepper 

and salt, onions, a piece of butter, 2 tablespoonsful of cream, 
nutmeg, 2 slices •£ buttered toast.

pepper and salt to taste. Let boil until quite tender, which 
will take about two hours and a half, or perhaps longer ; have 
some white onions boiled until quite tender ; then turn them 
out in a cullender to drain ; then mash them, putting them 
back into your saucepan (which you have previously wiped 
out) with a piece of butter, two tablespoonsful oi cream or 
milk, a grating of nutmeg and a very little salt ; sprinkle in a 
little flour, set the pan on the fire, keeping it well covered, 
and give it one boil. Place at the bottom of a dish two slices 
*" buttered toast, cut in pieces, and put the tripe over it. 



VEAL. 

207. ROAST VEAL (Stllffed). — Ingredients— 8 oz. of braised

227. THIMBALES OP VEAL.— Ingredients — Turnip and carrots, 

salt water, a pinch of sugar, butter, flour, veal suet, boiled 
onion, pepper, and spices to taste, a little nutmeg, 3 or 4 
, eggs. 
With a column cutter cut out of turnips and the red part of 
carrots a number of long, round pieces rather less than three- 
eighths of an inch in diameter. Cut these pieces into slices 
about one-eighth of an inch thick. Be careful to have all these 
pieces, which should be like very small counters, of uniform 
shape. Boil them separately in salted water with a pinch of 
sugar ; do not let them be overdone, and turn them out on a 
sieve to drain quite dry. Take a number of cake moulds, 
butter them thickly, and, using a trussing needle for the pur- 
pose, line them with the pieces of carrots and turnips in alter- 
nate rows by pressing them gently against the buttered bottom 
and sides. When they are all done, fill them with the following 
composition; put half a pint of water into a stewpan, with a 
pinch of salt and a small piece of butter ; when it boils, stir 
into it enough flour to make a thick paste ; put it by to get 
cold. Take equal parts of this paste and veal suet, carefully 
picked ; pound them first separately, then together, in a mor- 
tar, with a piece of boiled onion, more or less, according to 
taste. Pound some lean veal, and of this take as much as there 
is paste and suet ; work the whole together in a mortar, sea- 
soning the mixturtj with pepper and salt and spices to taste, 
one of which should be nutmeg. Pass the whole through a 



Veal. mrs. Clarke's cookery book. 83 

sieve ; work in as many whole eggs as will bind the mixtare" 
Place the moulds into a stewpan with hot water, with a piece 
of paper over them, and steam them for about half an hour. 
Turn them out very carefully on a dish, and pour under them 
a sufficient quantity of the following sauce : put into a pint of 
milk two or three mushrooms, one onion and a carrot cut into 
pieces, a bunch of sweet herbs, whole pepper and salt to taste, 
a few cloves, and a little mace ; let the whole gently simmer 
for about an hour. Put an ounce of butter into a saucepan, 
and mix with it a tablespoonful of flour; then strain the fla- 
vored milk into the saucepan, and stir on tbe fire until it thick- 
ens. Finish by stirring in a gill of cream. 

228. GALANTllTE OP VEAL— Ingredients -A breast of veal, 
i lb. of fat bacon, powdered spice, sweet herbs, pepper and 
salt, J lb. of boiled tongue, ^ doz. trufSes, a calf's foot, 2 or 3 
onions, 2 carrots, a clove of garlic, a bundle of sweet herbs 
(thyme, marjoram, parsley and bay leaf), cloves, whole pepper 
mace and salt. 

Take a piece of breast of veal about twelve or fourteen 
inches long ; bone and trim it carefully, removing all gristle and 
superfluous fat, as well as some of the meat (about one lb.) 
Take this meat and i lb. of fat bacon, pound together in amor- 
tar, season with powdered spice and sweet herbs, pepper and 
salt to taste ; then pass the mixture through a wire sieve ; cut 
}i lb. of boiled tongue in pieces about one inch square; cut 
half a dozen truffles each into three or four pieces. Lay the 
prepared breast of veal skin downwards on the table, sprinkle 
it with pepper, salt, and powdered spices ; lay the pounded 
meat, the truffles, and the tongue on it, then roll it up neatly as 
a roly-poly pudding, and tie it up tightly in a cloth. Put all the 
trimmings and bones into a saucepan large enough to hold the 
galantine, add a calf's foot cut in pieces, the trimmings of the 
bacon (mind they are perfectly sweet), two or three onions, and 
two carrots cut in pieces, a clove of garlic, a bundle of sweet 
herbs (thyme, marjoram, parsley, and bay leaf), cloves, whole 
pepper, mace, and salt, in proportions according to taste. Fill 
up with such fi. quantity of cold water as will leave room for the 
galantine to be put in. Set the saucepan on the fire ; when the 
contents boil put in the galantine ; let it boil gently without in- 
terruption from two to tv/o and a half hours ; then lift it out, 
put it on a plate, and when it has cooled a little take off the 
cloth, tie it up afresh, and lay it between two dishes with a mod- 
erate weight upon it, to remain till cold. Care must be taken 
in this last operation that the "seam" of the galantine be made 
to come undermost. When quite cold undo the cloth, glajse 
the galantine, and garnish with savoury jelly made from th© 
liquor in which it was boiled.

MUTTON. 



MUTTON CUTLETS. 

This is an entree always ready to hand, but it must be care- 
fully and neatly prepared. A dish of well-dressed mutton cat- 
lets is truly " a dish to put before a king;" whereas greasy, fat, 
gristly lumps of meat, called for the nonce cutlets, offend the 
taste of the least fastidious. The first thing to attend to is the 
cutting and trimming of the cutlets neatly. Take apiece ot 
the best end of the neck of mutton, saw off the bones short, re- 
move gristle and fat, cut the cutlets about one-third of an inch 
in thickness, shape and trim them neatly, beat them with a 
cutlet bat dipped in water, and then proceed to cook them by 
any of the following recipes : 

229. Pepper, salt, and broil them over a brisk fire, serve them 
Arith mashed or sautees potatoes in the centre of the dish. 

230. Season as above, and before broiling dip them in oil 
■or oiled butter. Serve with 

231. SOTJBISE SATJOE. 

Peel and blanch four onions, cool them in water, drain and 
put them in a stewpan with sufficient water or white stock to 
cover them, add some cayenne, bay leaf, a little mace, a small 
piece of ham or bacon ; keep the lid closely shut and simmer 
gently until tender ; take them out, drain them thoroughly, 
press through a sieve or tammy cloth, add half pint of be- 
chamel sauce made thus : put in a stewpan a little parsley, 
one clove, a small piece of bay leaf, sweet herbs, and one pint 
of white stock freed from fat ; when boiled long enough to ex- 
tract the flavor of the herbs, etc., strain it, boil up quickly, till 
reduced to half the quantity ; mix a tablespoonful of arrowroot 
with half pint of milk or cream, pour on the reduced stock and 
simmer for ten minutes. 

232. Boil them as in recipe 231, and serve '^ith ?l puree of 
vegetables — haricot beans or celery — in the centre of the dish, 
or with chestnut sauce. 

233. PUREE OP hahicot beans. 

Soak one pint of beans for twelve hours at least, put 
them with three quarts of stock, an onion stuck with cloves, 
a carrot, half a head of celery, one-quarter pound of bacon, 
some parsley, thyme, and bay leaf; simmer till quite tender, 
drain, strain the broth, \>K^s\h& puree through a sieve, moisten- 
ing with the broth, add pepper, salt, and it is ready for use.

in boiling water, and remove the inner skin. Stew them in 
good white stock till quite tender, drain, and while hot press 
them through a sieve. Put the pulp into a saucepan, add a 
small piece of butter, a little sugar, pepper, and salt. Stir over 
the fire till quite hot, but do not let it boil, and serve. 

236. Prepare and season the cutlets as in recipe 233, dip them 
into the beaten-up yolk of an egg, or into oiled butter. Strew 
over them some plain (or better still, baked) bread crumbs, 
some finely minced parsley, and shalot ; broil and serve with 
Italian sauce. 

237. ITALIAN SAUCE- 

Put a slice of ham, two tablespoonsful of finely chopped 
mushrooms, and an onion (also chopped) into a stewpan with one 
gill of oil ; when the onion is well colored add three quarters 
of a pint of reduced gravy, a wineglass of white wine or vinegar, 
a spoonful of chopped parsley, pepper, salt, and a few slices of 
lemon ; simmer for half an hour, skim, remove the ham and 
slices of lemon, and serve hot. 

238. Cut the cutlets about three-quarters of an inch thick, 
trim as before, and flatten with the cutlet bat, beat uptheyolk 
of an egg, and mix with it chopped herbs — parsley, thyme, mar- 
joram — some grated bread, nutmeg, salt, and pepper. Cover 
the cutlets with this, and put each one into a well-buttered 
paper,broil over a clear fire on both sides, remove the paper, 
and serve with 

239. 1AUSHI1001.Z SAUCE. 

Remove the stalks and gritty part from half a pint of mush- 
rooms ; wash, drain, and put them into half a pint of well-fla- 
vored gravy, simmer them till quite tender, drain them, and 
keep them hot. Melt one oz. of butter in a saucepan, add to it 
one oz. of flour, stir over the fire till brown; pour in the gravy, 
stirring till it boils. Arrange the mushrooms in the centre of 
the dish, the cutlets round them, and pour the sauce over. 

240. Dip them in oiled butter, sprinkle them with bread 
crumbs and grated parmesan cheese, then dip them in beaten 
yolk of egg, put another layer of bread-crumbs and grated par-

mesan cheese ; fry in boiling lard till of a gold color, and serve 
with 

241. TOMATO SAT7CE. 

Mix in a saucepan one half oz. of butter and one half oz. of 
flour, add by degrees a small bottle of conserve de tovtates and a 
small quantity of stock, boil it up, and serve. 

242. Cutlets may be fried in hot butter, lard, or clarified 
dripping, after having been simply floured, or dipped in egg, 
mehed butter, or oil, then bread-crumbed, etc., as in recipes 237 
and 239. Can be served with plain gravy, with the purees of 
vegetables, or with any of the above sauces and garnishes. 

243. Cut (not too thin) and trim some cutlets. Prepare some 
vegetables — carrots, turnips, celery, and potatoes — cut them 
all one size and shape, toss them in butter (each vegetable 
separately) till nearly done ; add to the butter a thickening of 
flour. When colored add about one pint of stock, free from 
grease, two tablespoonsful of coftserve de iotnates, a faggot of 
herbs, pepper, salt ; put in the cutlets, stew them gently, when 
nearly done add the vegetables, simmer them together till quite 
tender, remove the faggot, and serve with the gravy and the 
vegetables. (The vegetables may be stewed with the cutlets, 
but in that case the turnips and potatoes must be put in after 
the carrots.) 

244. Cut them rather thick, lard and put them in a braizing 
pan, with enough good gravy to cover them ; add an onion 
stuck with cloves, a sHced carrot, a faggot of herbs ; braize till 
quite tender. Remove them from the gravy, strain, then reduce 
it, and skim well. When cold trim the cutlets carefully, simmer 
them till hot in the reduced gravy. Have ready a block of 
bread (pyramid shape); fry it in butter, put it in the centre 
of the dish, the cutlets round it (the gravy in the dish), and 
garnish with carrots and turnips (cut up small, and previously 
tossed in butter) arranged alternately between the cutlets. In- 
stead of the block of bread, and garnish of carrots and turnips, 
they may be served with any puree of vegetable, with tomatoes, 
etc., according to the season. 

245. OHAHTREITSE OF MUTTON-— Ingredients— Some cold 
boiled vegetables of any kind and cut into various shapes, 
cold mashed potatoes ; for the sauce, 2 oz. of butter, a little 
flour, stock flavored with mushroom or vegetables. 

Butter the inside of a straight-sided tin mould. Take some 
cold boiled vegetables of different kinds, and cut them into 
small slices of various shapes — squares, circles, triangles, etc, 
— then arrange them in a mosaic pattern on the inside of the 
mould, to which the butter will make them adhere. The vege-

tables may be carrots, turnips, beetroot, Jerusalem artichokes, 
and Brussels sprouts in the winter, and in summer carrots, tur- 
nips, asparagus points, French beans, and peas. The great 
thing is to contrast the colors well, and make a really pretty 
mosaic. Then, in order to keep the vegetables in their places, 
spread over them a layer of cold mashed potatoes about i^ in. 
thick. Now make a thick white sauce as follows : Put two 
ounces of butter irto a stewpan, and thicken it slowly with sift- 
ed flour (taking care not to color the flour) ; then add some 
strong stock flavored with mushrooms or vegetables, and the 
cold mutton cut into small slices about -5^ in. thick and 2 in. 
square. Stew gently for half an hour. In the meantime let 
the mould be put in the oven until the vegetables and mashed 
potatoes are heated through ; then pour into it the sauce and 
meat, and, placing a dish on the top of the rnould, turn out the 
chartreuse. This is a very pretty dish ; but care must be taken 
not to break the shape in turnii.g it out of the mould, and, also 
a great deal depends on the taste with which the vegetables are 
arranged. 

246. OROQUETTES OP MUTTON.— Ingredients— Some cold 
minced mutton with a few oysters or mushrooms, some highly 
flavored strong stock, a little roux, a little butter, a little 
sifted flour (baked), yolk of an egg, bread crumbs, spinach. 
Croquettes to be good should be of a golden brown color, 
not at all greasy, crisp on the outside, and quite soft inside. 
To make them like this, follow the recipe here given ; Mince 
very finely some cold mutton with a few oysters or a few mush- 
rooms ; take some strong stock well flavored with vegetables 
and highly seasoned, put it in a stewpan, and thicken it with 
roux (z. e., butter melted over a slow fire, well skimmed, 
thickened to a stiff paste with baked sifted flour, and left to cool 
before use). Let the stock simmer, and stir in the roux, taking 
care to stir always in the same direction ; when a nice and 
tolerably thick sauce has been made, add the minced mutton, 
etc., to it, and let the mince warm through, stirring it gently 
round as it does so ; then put it on a dish, and leave it to cool 
for some hours. When it is quite cold it should form a jelly- 
like paste, just consistent enough to make soft balls. These 
balls should be of the shape and size of a large egg. Dip them 
twice over, first in the yolk of an egg and then in grated bread- 
crumbs, then fry them in boiling fat. The boiling fat should 
cover them entirely ; they must be put into it one at a time 
very carefully and gently, and taken out with equal care to 
prevent the risk of breaking them. It is for this reason that it 
is necessary to egg and bread-crumb them twice over. Arrange 
them round a dish with boiled peas, French beans, or spinach, 
piled up in the centre.

247. COHITETTES DE SSOTTTOIT. — Ingredients — Some cold 

mutton with oysters or muslirooms, some puff paste, the yolk 

of an egg, vermicelli. 
Mince some cold mutton with either oysters or mushrooms 
very finely, as for croquettes. Make a thick sauce in the same 
way as that described in the preceding recipe, add the mince 
to it, and leave it to cool in precisely the same manner as if for 
croquettes. Then make some puff paste, roll it out very thin — 
almost as thin as a wafer — cut it into pieces, and wrap up in 
Ihem lumps of the prepared mince about the size oi a walnut, 
making small triangular patties. Brush these patties over 
with the yolk of an egg. Dip them in uncooked vermicelli, 
which will adhere to the egg and paste, and bake them in the 
oven till the vermicelli is of a pale golden brown color. Serve 
them up dry on a folded napkin. These cornettes should be 
quite soft inside, and melt in the mouth when eaten. 

248. MOUTON A L' IT ALIENNE.— Ingredients- Slices of 

underdone leg of mutton, buttered white paper, macaroni. 

For the sauce — a little strong stock, roux to thicken, juice of 

a lemon, mushroom catchup to taste, cayenne pepper, and i 

glass of claret. 
Cut some slices of underdone leg of mutton about half an 
inch thick. Wrap them each in a piece of buttered white paper, 
and broil them over a clear fire. Then remove the papers as 
quickly as possible, and put the meat in the centre of dish, ar- 
ranging round it a wall of hot boiled macaroni. Pour over it 
a sauce made as follows, and serve very hot. THE Sauce : 
Take some strong stock, thicken with brown roux and fla- 
vor the sauce with lemon juice, mushroom catchup, cay- 
enne pepper, and half a glass of claret. All these receipts for 
doing up cold mutton were given to me by a first-rate French 
cook, and, if followed carefully by a cook who has some taste 
and discretion in seasoning, will be found to be very good. 

249. EAEIOOT MUTTON.— Ingredients— Scrag of mutton, a 

little flour, 2 small onions, 1 bunch of savorj' herbs, 3 cloves, 
pepper and salt, 1 blade of mace, 2 small carrots, 1 turnip, a 
little sugar. 
Cut the meat into shapely pieces and fry a nice color ; 
sprinkle them with a little flour, pepper and salt. Put all into 
a stewpan, just cover with boiling water, then put in your 
onion stuck with three cloves, the herbs and mace. Allow this 
to boil very gently till the meat is tender ; take off any fat 
there may be. Cut up the turnip and carrots (if cut with vege- 
table cutter they will look nicer) ; fry them in a little sugar to 
color them ; add these to the meat and allow to simmer for 
fifteen or twenty minutes. When ready to serve, take out the 
onion and bundi of herbs.

out spoiling the skin ; if very fat, cut off some of it. Fill up 
the hole with the forcemeat, then sev/ it up to prevent it falling 
out, tie up neatly and roast about 2^ hours or a little longer. 
When ready to serve, remove the string and serve with a good 
gravy.

frying-pan with a very little water, so little that it will boil 
away by the time the meat is tender ; then put in lumps of 
butter with the meat and let it brown slowly ; there will be a 
brown, crisp surface, with a fine flavor. Serve for breakfast 
with potatoes cooked thus : Choose small ones and let them 
boil till they are tender ; drain off the water, and pour over 
them, while still in the kettle, at least one teacupful of cream ; 
mash them smooth in this. 

256. LAMBS' TAILS- — Ingredients — A few slices of bacon, 8

CURRIES. 

OBSERVATIONS ON CURRIES. 

Most people, more especially old Anglo-Indians, have a 
liking for a really good ctirry ; but how very rarely it is to 
be obtained in America, unless at the house of some one. 
who has passed a good many years in India. The dish 
miscalled a curry is frequently set before people, but too 
often as far as possible removed from the real and appetis- 
ing //a/ which a good Indian cook will send to table. The 
meat is tough, has most likely been boiled instead of gently 
simmered, the sauce, or thick gravy, is hot enough in all 
conscience, but it tastes only of curry powder of an inferior 
kind ; the rice is a sloppy mess, and the result is a fiery 
leathery sort of indigestible hash, instead of a sweet, acid, 
highly but agreeably flavored, perfectly cooked and di- 
gestible dish, fit to set before a prince. It is said, how- 
ever, that, even in India, the art of curry-making is declin- 
ing, that the cunning secrets of curry powder and curry 
paste mixing are, to a certain extent, lost, from the fact that 
curry is no longer so fashionable as it once was, and is 
much more rarely seen on the table. The mere cooking of 
a curry is not the difficult part of it, though that requires 
to be understood. Any cook, of whatever nationality, 
who has really mastered the art of stewing properly, that is 
very gently and slowly, can cook a curry ; the real diffi- 
culties lie in procuring good curry powder or curry paste. 



269. CTJimiED 07STEIIS- — ingredients — 50 large oysters, a 

lump of fresh butter, a small onion, a tablespoonful of curry 

powder, broth, or hot water, J a cocoanut, ^ a sour apple, 

flour, salt, ^ a vegetable marrow, a tomato, the juice of ^ a 

lemon. 

Take the oysters with their liquor, in a basin. Slice the 

onion and fry in butter until of a rich brown, put in large 

stewpan, then add a little more butter and the curry powder; 

mix well with a wooden spoon. Add gradually broth or hot 

water, nearly filling the stewpan. Allow the whole to boil. 

93 



94 MRS. Clarke's cooKjiKy boojl Cokkies. 



Grate the cocoanut, chop the apple, and add these to the other 
ingredients. Allow to simmer until the cocoanut is very 
tender. Make a thickening of flour and water (about a cupful); 
sprinkle a little salt in it. Put this in the stewpan also and 
allow it to boil five minutes. Having boiled the vegetable 
marrow until tender, cut into pieces, put this with the tomato 
the oysters, their liquor, and milk of cocoanut to the former in- 
gredients. Allow to stew for a few minutes and lastly put in 
the juice of the lemon. As soon as the oysters are done, serve 
with a corresponding dish of rice. The curry must be kept 
well-stirred. 

270. OURRY POWDEEi. — Ingredients — 1 lb. pale turmeric seed, 

^ lb. of cumin seed, J lb. of black pepper, J lb. of coriander

Take care to purchase these ingredients of a first-class 
druggist. Additional heat can be obtained by those who like 
very hot curries, if red Chili powder be added to the aboi^e 
ingredients, according to taste. Mix together all these in- 
gredients well powdered, and place before the fire or in tJie 
sun, stirring occasionally. Keep in well corked bottles. N. B. 
— This will be found very good. 

271. INDIAN CITEiIliY- — Ingredients — 2 large tablespoonsful of

for cooking, wash well and dry in a cloth, cut in pieces of equal 

size. After straining the butter from the onions, return the 



CuKRiES. MRS. Clarke's cookery book. 95 

former to the stewpan, put in pieces of rabbit, and allow to fry 
for ten or fifteen minutes, turning occasionally. Peel and core 
the apple, and chop as finely as possible. When the meat is 
done add to it two tablespoonsful of curry powder, the salt, 
stirring for five minutes, then add the fried onion, chopped 
apple and a pint of good stock. Allow to simmer for two 
hours, at the end of the time add the cream, squeeze the juice 
from the lemon into the stewpan. It is then ready to serve.

the mutton in neat pieces ; sprinkle curry powder over them, 
also a litttle salt, and just before putting in the saucepan pour 
a part of a cup of sweet cream over them. Let this all simmer 
gently for half an hour, so that the ingredients will become 
thoroughly mixed. 

274. A DRY MALAY OTJUllY.— Ingredients— A cauliflower, 

2 onions, a sour apple, a piat f shrimps, slices of cold mut- 
ton, 2 ozs. of butter, a large tablespoonful of curry powder,

Pick a cauliflower into small pieces and well wash them ; 
chop two onions and one sour apple, pick a pint of fresh boiled 
shrimps, cut some slices of cold mutton about half an inch 
thick, knead two ounces of butter with a large tablespoonful of 
curry powder, and a small teaspoonful of salt. Put the butter, 
onions and apple into a stewpan, and fry till blown, then add 
the cauliflower and shrimps. Shake the saucepan frequently, 
and let it simmer for an hour and a halt, adding the slices of 
mutton towards the end of the time, that they may be heated 
through. Finally, add the juice^of a lemon. Place the slices 
of mutton round the dish with the cauliflower, &c., in the 
middle. Serve very hot, with a separate dish of boiled rice. 

275. OXJEiRIED LOBSTER.— Ingredients— Lobster, cream, rice. 
Take the flesh of a lobster (or a tin of lobster does very well 

for this dish), make curry gravy with plenty of cream ; pour 
into a saucepan with the lobster, warm it just to boiling point ; 
serve with rice round. 

277. ATTJESISH DISH.— Ingredients— 6 oz. of East Ladia

stewpan with an ounce of butter, salt and pepper to taste, stir- 



)6 MRS. CLARKE'S COOKERY BOOK. CURRIES. 



ring well, and adding by degrees about half a pint of good 
fowl broth. After about fifteen minutes or so it should be 
properly done, turning out with the grains separately. It is to 
be served perfectly hot. The foregoing is a true pillau, but 
additions may be made of portions of the meat of the fowl, or 
of any other animal matter, of a little curry powder, ofchutnee, 
fried onions, or mushrooms. 

278. BOILED RICE FOR CUHHT. — Ingredients— Ri«e, lemon. 
Put the rice on the stove in cold water, and allow it to come 

to a boil for a minute or two. Strain, dry and put in stewpan 
without lid at the back of the stove,' to allow the steam to 
evaporate ; shake into dish very hot ; a few drops of lemon 
juice put in directly after it boils will make the grains separate 
better. 

279. OUHItlED EGCrS- — Ingredients — 6 eggs, 2 onions, butter, 

a tablespoonful of curry powder, 1 pint of brotk, a cup of

onion as finely as possible, and when the dripping is hot put in 
the onion to brown (do not allow it to burn), cut the meat into 
small pieces, peel and core the apple, and chop finely. When 
the onion is brown strain it off and put the dripping back into 
the saucepan, puv pieces of meat into the saucepan and 
brown them both sides ; add the curry powder, apple «and a 
little salt ; pour in half pint of cold water, and return the 
browned onion to the saucepan, stir until it boils, then move 
to the back of the stove and allow to simmer half an hour.

GRAVIES. 

GENERAL DIRECTIONS RESPECTING GRAVIES. 

Gravy may be made quite as ^ood of the skirts of beef, 
and the kidney, as of any other meat, prepared in the same 
way. 

An ox-kidney, or milt, makes good gravy, cut all to 
pieces, and prepared as other meat ; and so will the shank 
end of mutton that has been dressed, if much be not 
wanted. 

The shank-bones of mutton are a great improvement to 
the richness of gravy ; but first soak them well, and scour 
them clean. 

Parragon gives the flavor of French cookery, and in 
high gravies is a great improvement ; but it should be 
added only a short time before serving.

skins. Boil the juice for an hour, then add the above ingredi- 
ents (all the spices must be ground). Boil all together for a 
sufficient time, which may be known by the absence of any 
watery particle, and by the whole becoming a smooth mass ; 
five hours will generally suffice. Bottle without straining into

STOCKS. 



337. COIOIOIT STOCE. 

Take all the bones of joints, etc., that are available, carcases 
and bones of poultry and game (not high), chop them all into 
convenient pieces and put them into a saucepan together with 
any scraps of meat, cooked or uncooked, resulting from rem- 
nants, the trimming of cutlets, etc. Add a couple of carrots, 
one onion, a bunch of parsley, one bay leaf, a small sprig of 
thyme, and one of marjoram ; salt to taste, a small quantity 
of white pepper and allspice mixed, and two or three cloves. 
Fill the saucepan with cold water until it covers the contents 
by one inch, itnd set it on the fire to boil slowly for about four

be fit for use. 

338. GRAVY STOCK. 

Place a layer of slices of onion in a saucepan holding a 
gallon, over this a layer of fat bacon, and over all about two 
pounds of shin of beef chopped in small pieces ; one pint of 
common stock or even water, being poured on the whole, set 
the saucepan on the fire for one hour, until the liquor is al- 
most evaporated — what is called reduced to a "glaze" — then 
add sufificient cold common stock or cold water to cover con- 
tents of the saucepan, and two or three cairots cut in slices, 
one leek, a head of celery (when in season), or some celery 
seed, a handful of parsley, half a clove of garlic, a sprig of

ders, small eels, or the trimmings of soles that have been fillet- 
ed ; pack them into a saucepan, with a head of parsley, in- 
cluding the root, a head of celery, two blades of mace, a few 
cloves, some white pepper and salt to taste, and a bay leaf. 
Put in as much cold water as will cover the contents of the 
saucepan^ set it to simmer gently for a couple of hours, then

VEGETABLES. 



OBSERVATIONS. 

Talce care to purchase them perfectly fresh, as this is 
their chief value and excellence. The middle-sized are 
preferable to the larger or smaller ; they are more tender, 
juicy, and are better flavored. Peas and potatoes are seldom 
worth eating before midsummer. Salads, greens, roots, 
when first gathered are firm and have a fragrant freshness. 

Vegetables should be carefully cleaned from insects, and 
nicely washed. Boil them in plenty of water, and drain 
them the moment they are done enough. If overboiled, 
they lose their beauty and crispness. Bad cooks sometimes 
dress them with meat, which is wrong, except carrots with 
boiling beef. 

To boil vegetables green, be sure the water boils when 
you put ihem in. Make them boil very fast. Don't cover, 
but watch them ; and if the water has not slackened, you 
may be sure they are done when they begin to sink. Then 
take them out immediately or the color will change. Hard 
water, especially if chalybeate, spoils the color of such vege- 
tables as sho«ld be gieen. 

To boil them green in hard water, put a teaspoonful of 
salt of wormwood into the water when it boils, before the ve- 
getables are put in. 

342. VEGETABLE 1)ZAP.E0W (to Boil or Stev). 

This excellent vegetaoie may be boiled as asparagus. When 
boiled, divide it lengthways into two. and serve it upon a toast 
accompanied by melted butter ; or when nearly boiled, divide 
it as above, and stew gently in gravy like cucumbers. Care 
should be taken to choose young ones not exceeding six inches 
in length. 

343. SFINACH. 

CarefoUy wash and pick. When that is done, throw it into 
a saucepan that will just hold it, sprinkle it with a little salt, 
and cover close. The pan must be set on the fire; and well 

"4 



Vegetables, mrs. clarke^ cookery book. 115 

shaken. AVhen done, beat the spinach well with a small piece of 
butter; it must come to tabl« pretty dry, and looks well if 
pressed into a tin mould in the form of a large leaf, which is 
sold at the tinshops. A spoonful of cream is an improvement. 

344. SPIITAOH- — Ingredients — Spinach, butter, pepper and salt, 

boiled eggs. 
Wash and pick your spinach very carefully ; drop into boil- 
ing water and cook fifteen minutes. Drain thoroughly through 
a cullender, then chop quite fine. Return to the stove, add one 
tablespoonful of butter, pepper and salt to taste ; put in a vege- 
table dish and garnish with hard-boiled eggs. 

345. POTATOES (to Boil). 

Put them on the fire, without paring them, in cold water ; 
let them half boil, then throw in some salt and a pint of cold 
water, and allow to boil again until almost done. Pour off the 
water and put a clean cloth over them, and then the saucepan 
cover, and set them by the fire to steam till ready. Many 
persons prefer steamers. Potatoes look best when the skin is 
peeled, not cut. Do new potatoes the same, but be careful 
they are taken off in time, or they will be watery. Before 
dressing, rub off the skin with a cloth, salt, and then wash. 

346. POTATOES (to Broil). 

Parboil, then slice and broil them. Or parboil and then set 
them on the gridiron over a very slow fire, and when thor- 
oughly done send them up with their skins on. This last way 
is practised in many Irish families. 

347. POTATOES (to Roast). 

Half boil, take off the thin peel, and roast them of a beauti- 
ful brown. 

348. POTATOES (to Pry). 

Take the skin off raw potatoes, slice and fry them, either in 
butter or thin batter. 

349. POTATOES (to Mash). 

Boil the potatoes, peel them, and break them to paste ; then 
to two po^Inds of them add a quarter of a pint of milk, a little 
salt, and two ounces of butter, and stir it all well over the fire. 
Either serve them in this manner, or place them on the dish 
in a form, and then brown the top with a salamander, or in 
scallops. 

350. POTATOBS (Stuffod). — Ingredients — 5 medium-sized pota- 

toes, J oz. of butter, 1 tablespoonful of grated cheese, pepper, 
Bidt, aud the yolk of 1 egg. 

For these take five of medium size, bako in their skins, and

when done cut off a small slice from one end, scoop out the 

inside, and rub through a wire sieve. Add to it half an ounce 
of butter, one tablespoonful of grated cheese, pepper, salt, and 
the yolk of an egg. Mix well, refill the skins, fit on the slices 
which were cut off, and put into the oven again for ten minutes 
before serving. 

351. LYONNAISE POTATOES-— Ingredients— A lump of but- 

ter, a small onion, cold boiled potatoes, a littls parsley. 
Into a saucepan put a large lump of butter and a small onion 
finely chopped, and when the onion is fried to an amber color, 
throw in slices of cold boiled potatoes, which must be thor- 
oughly stirred until they are turning brown : at this moment 
put in a spoonful of finely chopped parsley, and as soon as it 
is cooked drain through a cullender, so that the potatoes retain 
the moisture of the butter and many particles of parsley. 

352. SAHATO&A POTATOES^ — Ingredient* — Potatoes, boiling 

lard and salt. • 
Peel, and slice on a slaw-cutter into cold water, wash thor- 
oughly and drain ; spread between the folds of a clean cloth, 
rub and pat until dry. Fry a few at a time in boiling lard, salt 
as you take them out. Saratoga potatoes are often eaten cold. 
They can be prepared three or four hours before needed, and if 
kept in a warm place they will be crisp and nice. 

353. BERMUDA POTATOES (fried.).— Ingredients— 2 oz. of 

butter, parsley, salt and pepper, a cup of milk, tablespoonful 

of flour. 
Slice the potatoes and put them into boiling water ; cook 
until tender ; remove and put them into a saucepan with two 
ounces of butter, chopped parsley, salt and pepper and a cup 
of milk ; cook all together and thicken with a tablespoonful of 
flour stirred in cold water. 

354. POTATOES (SauteeS au Beurro).—Ingredients— Butter, 

salt. 

Cut with a vegetable cutter into small balls about the size of 
a marble ; put them in a stewpan with plenty of butter and a 
good sprinkling of salt ; keep the saucepan covered, and shake 
it occasionally until they are quite done, which will be in about 
an hour. 

355 POTATOES (Stewed)-— Ingredients— Milk, 1 pint, a table- 
spoonful of flour. 

Peel and cut into small uniform pieces as many potatoes as 
may be needed. Have ready enough boiling water (slightly 
salted) to cover them ; boil until done. Skim them out of the 
water into a dish and pour milk gravy over them (made of a

egg ; rub it together for about five minutes, or until very 
smooth ; shape the mixture into balls about the size of a wal- 
nut or small rolls, dip them into an egg well beaten and then 
into the finest sifted bread crumbs ; fry them in boiling lard. 

357. POTATOES (Escallopod). — Ingredients — Cream, a large 

piece of butter, a little salt. 
Having boiled, beat them fine in a bowl, with cream, and a 
large piece of butter, and a little salt. Put them into escallop 
shells, make them smooth on the top, score with a knife, and 
lay thin slices of butter on the tops of them. Then put them 
into an oven to brown. 

358. POTATO OSIPS>— Ingredient! — Boiling lard and salt. 

Peel a raw potato as apples are peeled, let the parings be as 
nearly as possible the same thickness, and let them be as long 
as possible. Dry them thoroughly in a cloth, put them in the 
frying basket, and plunge it into boiling hot lard. When the 
chips are a golden color drain them well in front of the fire, 
sprinkle fine salt over them. 

359. POTATO GAZE* — Ingredients — Potatoes, flour and lard.

cold water, drain and plunge into boiling water, in which the 
above proportions of salt and soda have been added ; boil with- 
out cover. Take up directly after they are done, drain, dish 
and serve. 

364. OABBA&E (a la Cauliflower)- — ingredients— Butter, salt, 
i a cup of cream. 
Cut the cabbage fine as for slaw ; put it into a stewpan, 
cover with water and keep closely covered ; when tender, 
drain off the water ; put in a small piece of butter with a little 
salt, one half a cup of cream, or one cup of milk. Leave on 
the stove a few minutes before serving. 

865. PAROI (or Stuffed Oabljage).— ingredients— Veal stuf- 
fing, slices of sausage meat, gravy. 

Cook the cabbage in salt and water sufficiently to open the 
leaves, and insert between them layers of ordinary veal stuffing, 
slices of sausage meat, then tie it securely round with thread 
to prevent the meat falling out. Replace in the stewpan, and 
cook briskly at first, then simmer till completely tender ; serve 
in the same manner as ragout — that is to say, with a 
little gravy poured over the whole. In winter roast chestnuts 
hidden in the centre are sometimes added, when it is termed 
" Chou en surprise." 

366. EIT HAGOTTT- — Ingredients — Clarified fat, small pieces of 
bacon or ham, pepper and salt, a little stock or water. 

Soak a fresh fair-sized cabbage for ten minutes in strong

clarified fat into a clean stewpan, and some small pieces of 
bacon or ham ; lay half the cabbage on the top (either whole- 
leaved or cut up into large pieces, whichever is preferable), some 
more fat, and pepper and salt to taste, remembering that the 
bacon or ham will add to the saltness ; place the other half of 
the cabbage on the top, and pour in a little stock (water can be 
used in default of stock, but the latter is by far the best), just 
enough to cover the ingredients. Cook briskly at first, then 
withdraw to the side, and keep it simmering for a considerable 
time. When it is thoroughly done, pour off the liquid, and set 
aside. Place the cabbage in the centre of a heated dish, as 
much raised as possible, and, having skimmed off the fat from 
the liquor, pour it over the vegetable, and serve. 

376. A %--^ CHIESl^E- — Ingredients— 1 oz. of butter, salt, white 
pepper, spoonful of flour, i pt. of cream, fried croutons. 
For this entrde, which is very delicate if carefully prepared,

aod boil till it is almost done, but not quite tender ; take it out, 
and drain it thoroughly from all moisture ; then cut it up 
lengthwise into several pieces ; melt about an ounce of butter 
in a stewpan ; the quantity of butter must be regulated by the 
size of the cabbage ; sufficient must be used to make a rich 
sauce. Add salt, white pepper to avoid any discoloration, 
and a spoonful of flour ; then put in the cream, according to 
desire, in any case not less than a quarter of a pirtt. Lay in 
the pieces of cabbage, and finish cooking in the sauce until per- 
fectly tender. Arrange symmetrically on the dish, and place 
some fried croutons round.

quarters lengthways, and throw them into boiling water for one 
quarter of an hour ; then take them out carefully and drain 
well. Put some clarified fat into a stewpan, and lay in the 
quarters of cabbage ; season with pepper and salt, and cover 
completely with slices of bacon, cut very thin, and moisten 
with stock. When done, take them out carefully, and press 
each quarter into a shape — either a round, heart, diamond,, or 
in the form of cutlets, which is always a successful shape. 
Arrange artistically on a heated dish, and pour over the whole 
some Espagnole or brown sauce. 

369. ATJZ POMMES.— Ingredients — 1 red cabbage, 3 or 4 moder-

380. TOMATOES (Broiled). — Ingredients — Some large, fresh 

tomatoes, butter, pepper, and salt, a small portion of sugar, 

an eggspoonful of made mustard. 
In buying tomatoes for broiling, be careful to select large 
and fresh ones. Do not pare them. Slice in pieces abciut half 
an inch thick, and broil them for a few minutes upon a grid- 
iron ; while they are "broiling prepare some hot butter in a cup, 
seasoning with pepper, salt, an eggspoonful of made mustard, 
%nd a little sugar ; when the tomatoes are finished dip each 
piece into this, and then dish (the dish must be hot). If any 
of the seasoning remains, heat to the point of boiling and pour 
over the dish ; serve immediately. This is a very nice dish if 
cooked well. 

381. TOMATOES (Ra-w). 

Pare them with a sharp knife, slice them neatly and place 
on a dish ; sprinkle with pepper and salt, and pour over a 
little vinegar. Place this in the refrigerator until it is needed. 

Note : This dish will be much improved by stirring a piece 
of ice about in the dressing before pouring over the tomatoes. 

382. BEET ROOTS. 

Beet roots make a very pleasant addition to winter salad> 
of which they may agreeably form a full half, instead of being 
only used to ornament it. This root is cooling, and very whole- 
some. 

It is extremely good boiled, and sliced with a small quantity 
of onion ; or stewed with whole onious, large or small, as 
follows : — 

Boil the beet tender with the skin on, slice it into a stewpan 
with a little broth, and a spoonful of vinegar ; simmer till the 
gravy is tinged with the color, then put it into a small dish, and 
make a round of the button onions, first boiled till tender, take 
off the skin just before serving, and mind they are quite hot 
and clear. 

Or roast three large onions, and i)eel ofif the outer skins till 
they look clear, and serve the beet-root stewed round them. 

If the beet root is in the least broken before dressed, it parts 
with its color, and looks ill. 

383. ONIONS (Boiled). 

Skin them thoroughly. Put them to boil ; when they have 
boiled a lew minutes, pour off the water and add clean cold 
water, and then set them to boil again. Pour this away and 
add more cold water, when they may boil till done. This will 
make them white and clear, and very mild in flavor. After 
they are done, pour ofT all the water, and dress with a little 
cream, salt, and pepper to taste.

cigar, put them in a deep dish, and put a piece of butter and a 
little salt and pepper on the place where the point has been 
cut off, cover them with a plate or dish, and let them bake for

serve in their skins. 

386. SPANISH ONIONS. (Ste wed). -Ingredients-5 or 6 me- 

dium-sized Spanish onions, 1 pint of broth or gravy. 

In paring the onions be careful not to cut off too much of 
the tops and ends. Put them into a large saucepan (avoid

put in the sugar, and allow to simmer until the mixture is 
nearly black and begins to smoke. Have ready the vinegar 
boiling hot, and strain the liquor slowly into it, stirring with a 
wooden spoon until it is thoroughly mixed ; set aside to cool, 
when ready, bottle for use. 

388. ONIONS (Stuffed). — Ingredients — Very large Spanish 

onions, cold fat pork or bacon, bread-crumbs, pepper, salt, 
mace, 10 spoonfuls of cream or milk, a well-beaten egg, but- 
ter, juice of half a lemon, trowned flour, milk. 

Wash and skin very large Spanish onions. Lay in cold wa- 
ter an hour. Parboil in boiling water half an hour. Drain, and 
while hot extract their hearts, taking care not to break the out- 
side layers. Chop the inside thus obtained very fine, with a 
little cold fat pork or bacon. Add bread-crumbs, pepper, salt, 
mace, and wet with a spoonful or two of cream (or milk in de- 
fault of cream). Bind with a well beaten egg, and work into a 
smooth paste. Stuff the onions with this ; put into a dripping 
pan with a very little hot water, and simmer in the oven for an

hour, basting often with butter melted. When done, take the 
onions up carefully, and arrange the open tnds upwards in a 
vegetable dish. Add to the gravy in the dripping pan the juice 
of half a lemon, four tablespoonfuls of cream or milk, and a 
little browned flour wet with cold milk. Boil up once, and 
pour over the onions. 

3S9. ACT73E^00MS. 

The cook should be well acquainted with the dif- 
ferent sorts of things called by this name by ignorant 
people, as the deaths of many persons have been caused by 
carelessly using the poisonous kinds. The eatable mushrooms 
first appear very small and of a round form on a very small 
stalk. They grow very fast, and the upper part and stalk are 
white. As the size increases, the under part gradually opens 
and shows a fringy fur of a very fine salmon color which con- 
tinues more or less till the mushroom has been picked, when it 
turns to a brown. The skin can be more easily peeled from the 
real mushroom than the poisonous kind. A good test is to 
sprinkle a little salt on the spongy part or gills of the sample to 
be tried ; if they turn black they are wholesome, if yellow they 
are poisonous. Give the salt a little time to act, before you 
decide as to their quality. 

390. Do. (Ste'^ed). — Ingredients — Mushrooms, salt, butter and 

browned flour. 

Gather those that have red gills ; cut off that part of the 
stem which grew in the earth ; wash, and take the skin from

tender ; thicken with a spoonful of butter and browned flour. 

391. DO- (Broiled)- — Ingredients — Mushrooms, salt, pepper, butter. 
Prepare them as directed for stewing. Broil them on a 

griddle ; and when done, sprinkle salt and pepper on the gills, 
and put a little butter on them. 

392. DO- (Baked). — Ingredients — 18 or 20 mushroom-flaps, pepper 

and butter to taste. 
Pare the top and cut off part of the stalk, wipe them care- 
fully with a piece of flannel or cloth and a little fine salt. 
Then put them into a baking dish and put a piece of butter on 
each mushroom. Sprinkle with pepper to taste and bake for 
twenty minutes or half an hour. When done serve on a hot 
dish with the gravy poured over the mushrooms. 

393. DO- (a la Oreme). — ingredients— Mushrooms, butter, salt, 

nutmeg, a bunch of herbs, yolk of one egg, some good cream. 

Cut the mushrooms in pieces, and toss them over a brisk fire 

in butter seasoned with salt, a very litle nutmeg, and a bunch of 



Vegetables, mrs. clarkx's cooksrt book. 125 

herbs. When they are done enough, and the butter nearly all 
wasted away, take out the herbs, add the yolk of an egg beat- 
en up in some good cream; make very hot and serve.

lard or butter, seasoned with salt, pepper, and minced parsley ; 
moisten with broth and a spoonful of cullis. Just before serv- 
ing add a squeeze of lemon juice. 

395. DO- (SSSence of)- — ingredients — Mushrooms, salt. 
Sprinkle a little salt over flap or button mushrooms. Allow 

them to stand three hours. Mash them, and the following

very long, but it is a delicate relish. 

396. DO- (PCWdor). — Ingredients — Half a peck of large mushrooms, 

2 teaspoonfuls of white pepper, one quarter oz. of pounded 
mace, 2 onions, a dozen cloves. 

Pare and wipe the mushrooms, be careful that no grit or

pan without water ; add ingredients and shake over a clear 
fire, till the liquor is evaporated. Under no consideration 
allow them to burn. Place upon tins, and dry in a slow oven. 
Then proceed to pound it into a fine powder. Have ready 
some perfectly dry small bottles, and put the powder in them. 
Cork and seal and keep in a dry place. This is a splendid sub- 
stitute for mushrooms, when they are not in season. 

397. PARSinPS. 

Boil, mash, season with butter, pepper and salt, make into 
little cakes ; roll in flour and brown in hot lard. They are 
very nice cooked in this manner. 

398. Do- (American Fashion). 

Scrape and boil some parsnips, then cut each lengthwise in

flour, pepper and salt. 

403. OtrOUMBERS (to Dress). — Ingredients— Half a teacupful 

of vinegar, 3 tablespoonfuls of salad oil, pepper and salt. 

Pare and cut the cucumber into slices as thin as a wafer (it 
is better to commence at the thick end). Place in a glass dish ; 
sprinkle with salt and pepper, and pour over the above pro- 
portions of oil and vinegar. This is a nice accompaniment to 
boiled salmon, and is useful in concocting a salad. It is also 
an excellent garnish for lobster salad. 

404. Do- (Stewed). — Ingredients — 3 large cucumbers, a little but- 

ter, half a pint of brown gravy, a little flour.

Peel a nice, straight cucumber, and cut it in four pieces 
lengthways ; scoop out all the seeds, and then cut it up again 
into small long pieces about a finger length ; throw these into 
a saucepan of boiling water and some salt. When they bend 
under the touch they are done, and must be taken cut and 
very carefully drained in a sieve ; then put them into a stew- 
pan, with a good sized piece of butter, some finely chopped 
parsley, some onions, and salt and pepper to taste. The cu- 
cumber will not, however, require much salt, as the acid itself 
renders it salt tasting. Toss the pieces of vegetables well over 
a brisk fire until thoroughly heated through, and serve on a 
very hot dish. 

i07. DO- (Pircis)- — ingredients — Cucumber, meat stuffing, a bunch 
of herbs, and some good stock, a little corn flour, butter the

or even fish can be used as a forcemeat for a change, and fill 
the cucumber with it, replacing the ends originally cut oflFwith 
the aid of little wooden skewers. Wrap round the vegetable 
with a thin linen cloth, and put it into a stewpan with a bou- 
quet of herbs and some good stock. Simmer over a clear fire

and fry them in butter. They can also be dipped in a good 
batter, and then fried in the same way as salsify. Particular 
care must be taken to have the vegetable very dry, as the 
slightest moisture will prevent them frying crisp.

in halves and set on end on the top of the beans, with a 
little pyramid of fried parsley in the centre of the dish. The 
melted butter must be carefully made, with half an ounce of 
butter and the same of flour stirred together over the fire until 
they are well blended ; then add a gill of milk, pepper, and 
salt, and three drops of lemon juice ; when this boils it is 
considered sufficiently cooked. An ordinary sized egg to be 
hard, should be boiled twelve minutes ; if less it will be soft in 
the centre, if more it will be overdone, and have a black line 
round it near the shell.

Shell, and put them into a kettle of water when it boils; give 
them two or three warms only, and pour them in a cullender ; 
when the water drains off, turn them out on a table covered 
with cloth, and pour them on another cloth to dry perfectly ; 
then bottle them in wide-mouthed bottles ; leaving only room 
to pour clarified mutton-suet upon them an inch thick, and for 
the cork. Rosin it down, and keep it in the cellar or in the 
earth. When they are to be used, boil them till tender, with a 
piece of butter, a spoonful of sugar, and a little miBt.

137. CrEEElT PEAS (to Seep, as practised, in the Emperor 
of Eussia's kitchen)- 

When they are to be used, let them lie an hour in water; then 
set them on with cold water and a piece of butter, and boil them 
till ready. Put a sprig of dried mint to boil with them. Boiled 
peas should not be overdone, nor in much water ; chop some 
scalded mint to garnish them, and stir a piece of butter in 
with them. 

438. Do. (Stewed)- — ingredients — A quart of peas, 1 lettuce, 1 
onion, butter, pepper, salt, 1 egg, a little flour. 

Put a quart of peas, a lettuce and an onion both sliced, a 
piece of butter, pepper, salt, and no more water than hangs 
round the lettuce from washing ; stew them two hours very 
gently. When to be served, beat up an egg, and stir it into 
them, or a little flour and butter. Some think a teaspoonful 
of white powdered sugar is an improvement. 

439: Do. (a la Prancaise)-— Ingredients— For every pint of peas 
1 gill of water, 1^ oz. of butter, a bunch of parsley, salt, 
pepper, 8 or 9 small white onions, 1 lettuce. 

Put the required quantity of peas necessary for your dish 
into a perfectly clean and bright stewpan, with some water and 
butter in the following proportions : For every pint of peas one 
gill of water and one ounce of butter. When this is thoroughly 
amalgamated, add a little bouquet, tied together, of parsley, 
also salt, pepper, and another half ounce of butte^r, then 
eight or nine small white onions, and a whole lettuce. Simmer 
the whole well for an hour, or more if the peas and other vege- 
tables are not completely tender. The time, in fact, must be 
regulated according to the judgment of the cook. When done, 
take out the bunch of parsley, the lettuce, and the onions, 
which are very serviceable for hashes, stews, or soups, even 
when used as above. The peas, when once cooking, must not 
be touched by a spoon or a fork, as it would bruise them and 
spoil the appearance of the entree, but well tossed constantly 
to prevent them sticking to the stewpan, always kept briskly 
simmering, but never boiling, otherwise they will harden. 

440. Do. (au Sucre). — ingredients — Peas, white sugar. 

Green peas prepared as above without the lettuce, onions, 
parsley, or pepper, but some finely powdered white sugar 
sprinkled in by degrees, and according to taste. 

441. DO- (en Puree)- — ingredients — Two pints of peas, white 

sugar, bread-crumbs, flour, double cream, salt, a bunch of 
parsley, white pepper, butter and stock in adequate propor- 
tions, fried croutons (heart-shaped). 

The great secret of a well-concocted purde is the softness of

the whole. It should pass over the palate like velvet, and 
leave no trace of its substance or material behind. To ensure 
this creamy softness there are three distinct methods. Firstly, 
by adding before passing through the hair sieve some very fine 
white sifted bread-crumbs ; secondly, prepared flour mixed 
carefully to a smooth paste first, with some stock or bouillon ; 
andthirdlyby theaidof gooddouble cream. A tiny pinch of fine 
white powdered sugar mustalways be added. It is avery neces- 
sary ingredient. For an artistic purde, then, take two pints, 
say, of young green peas, and throw them into a saucepan of 
boiling water with some salt, and a bunch of parsley. When 
tbey are tender, take them out and drain them thoroughly from 
all the moisture, and then pass carefully through a fine hair 
sieve. Season the purde thus made with a little white pepper 
and salt to taste, and reheat in a saucepan with a little butter 
and stock in adequate proportions, having of course previously, 
as directed above, employed one of the three methods for thick- 
ening and softening the pur^e. Serve with fried croutons, cut 
out in heart shape. The husks of the very young green-pea 
shell will also make a purde, or prove serviceable in mixing 
with the other, if thoroughly well cooked until quite soft in 
boiling water, drained, bruised, and then passed through a 
sieve, seasoned in the same manner. For green-pea soup the 
husk is very useful, as the flavor obtained equals in every way 
the vegetable itself. 

442. ASPARA&US- — Ingredients — Asparagus, salt, toast, butter. 
After scraping the stalks to cleanse them, place them in a 

vessel of cold water. Tie them up neatly into bundles of 
about twenty-five heads each, then place them in a saucepan 
of boiling water, sprinkling a handful of salt over it. When it 
is boiling remove any scum there may be ; the stalks will be 
tender when they are done ; they will take about twenty min- 
utes or half an hour ; be careful to take them up the minute 
they are done ; have ready some toast, dip in it the liquor in 
which the asparagus was boiled ; dish upon toast, and serve 
with a boat of melted butter. 

443. DO- (in AdlJUSh). — Ingredients — ^2 bunches of asparagus, 8 

stale biscuits (or rolls may be used), 4 eggs, about ^ pint of

them tender and mince finely. While they are boiling, take 
the biscuits or rolls, divide them, keeping the top half for a 
cover ; place them all in the oven to crisp ; make the milk 
hot, and then pour in the eggs beaten ; stir over the fire until 
it thickens, then add the butter rolled in flour, and lastly add

butter, pepper and salt, and beat them up together, then put 
in the flour; stir the soda into the milk, and add gradually; 
lastly put in the asparagus. Put this into ■. buttered mould 
with a lid, or if it has no lid tie it down tightly with a floured 
cloth ; boil for two hours. When done, turn out on a dish, and 
pour melted butter round it.

SALADS. 



OBSERVATIONS ON SALADS. 

The following vegetables are commonly used in com- 
pounding salads : Beetroot, lettuce, cucumber, mint, parsley, 
radish, mustard and cress, onions, and celery. Any rem- 
nants of boiled fresh fish make very good salads ; they 
should be sliced and seasoned with anchovies, parsley, 
vinegar, &c. 

455. SALAD. — Ingredients — Four or five heads of cabbage lettuce, 

4 spoonfuls of olive oil, 1| or 2 tablespoonfuls of tarragon 
vinegar, pepper and salt to taste, a small pinch of mint 
minced finely. 

Take four or five heads of cabbage lettuce, remove all out- 
side leaves, and cut off the stalks close ; then cut each head 
apart into four or five " quarters," that is, cut through the 
stalk and then tear the rest. Put four tablespoonfuls of olive 
oil into the salad bowl, with two and one half tablespoonfuls 
of tarragon vinegar, pepper and salt according to taste, and 
beat the mixture with a fork for some minutes ; then put in the 
lettuce, and keep it turning over swiftly for five minutes, 
adding a small pinch of mint, chopped as finely as possible. 

456. LETTUCE SALAD. — Ingredients — Two heads of lettuce, 

yolks of 2 hard boiled eggs, a teaspoonful of French mustard,

ragon. 

Wash two heads of lettuce, dry them thoroughly, and break 
the leaves or cut them into convenient pieces. Put the yolks 
of two hard-boiled eggs into a basin with a teaspoonful of 
French mustard, pepper and salt to taste, and a tablespoonful 
jf oil ; work the mixture into a smooth paste, and add conse- 
cutively three tablespoonfuls of oil, one of tarragon, and one 
J plain vinegar ; then a little chervil, garden cress, and tar- 
ragon finely chopped. Stir the mixture well, and lastly add 
the lettuce ; turn it or work it well. Garnish the top with hard-

teaspoonful of anchovy sauce, cayenne, salt, 1 hen lobster, 
2 hard-boiled eggs. 

Clean thoroughly some lettuces, endives and beetroots, cut 
them up and mix them with the following dressing : four table- 
spoonfuls of oil, two ditto of vinegar, one teaspoonful of made 
mustard, the yolks of two eggs, half a teaspoonful of anchovy

some red capsicum. 

Allow three sardines for each person ; bone and fillet these, 
carefully removing all the skin, and set them aside until re- 
quired. Boil two eggs for three minutes ; shell them and 
break them up in your salad bowl with a spoon ; mix with 
them a teaspoonful each of French mustard and essence of 
anchovies, the strained oil from the tin of sardines with as 
much Lucca oil as will make three tablespoonfuis in all ; add 
Chili, shalot, and good malt vinegar to taste (vinegar varies so 
much in acidity that it is difficult to specify the exact pro- 
portion). Cut up some nice crisp lettuce, and mix it well with 
the dressing, but only just before it is to be served. Put a 
little heap of mustard and cress in the centre of the salad, 
with a whole red capsicum upon it. Arrange the sardines 
round, and outside these a border of mustard and cress, dot- 
ted here and therewith thin slices of red capsicums. 

463. Do- (Anchovy)- 

The anchovies sold in bottles, ready filleted and preserved 
in oil, will be found most convenient for this. Make the salad 
as for sardines, only omitting the essence of anchovies. The 
eggs may be boiled hard, the yolks used for the dressing, and 
the whites cut in rings and filled with mustard and cress. 

464. Do- (GamO). — Ingredients — Cold grouse, partridge or pheas- 

ant, pepper, salt, juice of a lemon, about 2 tablespoonfuis

140 MRS. Clarke's cookery book. Salads. 



Cut them into joints, and put them into a pie dish ; season 
with salt and pepper, and pour ver them the juice of a lemon 
and about two tablespoonfuls of very fresh salad oil ; let them 
remain in this for three or four hours. Having cut up and 
well dried a fresh lettuce, place it on a flat dish and arrange 
the pieces of game which have been in the oil and lemon juice 
neatly in the centre ; over the game pour a salad sauce, which 
should be of the consistency of thick cream. Ornament the 
top with slices of hard-boiled egg, fillets of well-washed and 
scraped anchovies, and garnish with tiny sprigs of parsley. 
Cold chicken, or the white meat from a cold turkey cut into 
small pieces, may be treated in this way. Cold salmon or tur- 
bot are also excellent. 

465. SALAD (Tomato)- — Ingredients — Some good-rized toma- 

toes, two parts of oil to one of vinegar, pepper and salt to

chervil, half that quantity of chives, sauce as follows — The 
raw yolks of some eggs, oil, vinegar, pepper and salt, some 
savory jelly, hard boUed eggs, caviare, lobster spawn, olives, 
pickles, truffles, etc. 
Boil some carrots and some turnips in salted water with a 
small piece of butter, but do not let them be overdone ; when 
cold cut out of them, with a vegetable scoop, a number of pieces 
the sfze of an olive ; cut some beetroot in the same way, and 
likewise some truffles. Take equal parts — say a cupful — of each 
of the above, and a similar quantity of preserved fresh (not 
dried) haricot beans ready cooked, and of asparagus points 
preserved in the same way. Two tablespoonfuls respectively 
of capers, of French pickled gherkins, cut into the shape of

days. 

N.B". This salad must be allowed to stand covered for two 
hours before serving. 

469. Do- (Celery).— Ingredients— 2 heads of celery, 1 tablespoonful 

of salad oil, half a teacup vinegar, a teaspoonful of granu- 
lated sugar, pepper and salt to taste. 

Well wash the celery, removing any unsightly parts, lay in 
iced water until wanted ; then cut into pieces about an inch in 
length. Season with remaining ingredients, mix well and serve 
in salad bowl. 

470. Do- (Hed OalsTsage)- — ingredients— One small red cabbage, 1 

small dessertspoonful of salt, ^ pint of vinegar, 1^ dessert- 
spoonsful oil, a little cayenne pepper. 

Secure a nice fresh cabbage, remove the outer leaves and cu 
the cabbage into nice thin slices, then mix in the above ingre- 
dients and allow to stand for two davs when it will be fit for use. 
This salad will keep gooa tor several days. 

471. Bev. Sydney Smith's Eeceipt for Salad Dre8sixLgr„ 

" Two boiled potatoes, strained through a kitchen sieve, 
Softness and smoothness to the salad give; 
Of mordant mustard take a single spoon — 
Distrust the condiment that bites too soon, 
Yet deem it not, thou man of taste, a fault 
To add a double quantity of salt ; 
Four times the spoon with oil of Lucca crown, 
And twice with vinegar procured from town ; 
True taste requires it, and your poet begs 
The pounded yellow of two well boiled eggs. 



T42 MRS. CLARKE'S COOKERY BOOK. SaLADS. 

Let onions' atoms lurk within the bowl, 
And, scarce suspected, animate the whole : 
And, lastly, in the flavored compound toss 
A magic spoonful of anchovy sauce. 
Oh! great and glorious, and herbaceous treat, 
'Twould tempt the dying anchorite to eat ; 
Back to the world he'd turn his weary soul, 
And plunge his fingers in the salad bowl." 

472. SALAD (Oyster) — Ingredients — 1 tin of oysters containing 
about a quart, 1 head of celery, 1 tablespoonful of oil, 1 sniall 
teaspoonf ul of salt, made mustard and pepper, 3 dessertspoon- 
fuls of cider vinegar, a pinch of white sugar. 
Strain off the liquor from the oysters and cut them up (do 

not chop them), mince the celery and blend with the oysters. 

Mix the remaining ingredients, putting in the vinegar last, then 

pour over the celery and oysters. Stir well, and serve directly, 

as this salad will not keep long. 



PICKLES. 



OBSERVATIONS ON PICKLES. 

Enamelled kettles should always be used in preference to 
those of brass or copper, as the verdigris produced by the 
vinegar on these metals is extremely poisonous. For some 
pickles use cold vinegar, as in boiling most of the strength 
is lost by evaporation. For French beans, brocoli, cauli- 
flowers, gherkins, etc., it is better to heat the vinegar, for 
which the following process is recommended : — Put the 
vinegar and spice in a jar, cover it tightly, let it simmer on 
the back of the stove or on a trivet. Shake occasionally. 
Pickles should never be put into glazed jars, as salt and 
vinegar penetrate the glaze, which is poisonous. 

Glass or stone jars are preferable to any other ; a small 
piece of alum in each jar will make the pickles firm and 
crisp. One tablespoonful of sugar to each quart of vine- 
gar will be found a very great improvement to all pickles. 
Always use the very best cider or wine vinegar. 



474. OITZOITS (!)• — Ingredients — Onions, best white wine vinegar, 

allspice and whole black pepper. 

In the month of September, choose the small white round 
onions, take off the brown skin, have ready a very nice tin stew- 
pan of boiling water, throw in as many onions as will covep 
the top ; as soon as they look clear on the outside, take them 
up as quick as possible with a slice, and lay them on a clean 
cloth, cover them close with another, and scald some more, 
and so on. Let them lie to be cold, then put them in ajar, or 
glass, or wide-mouthed bottles, and pour over them the best 
white wine vinegar, just hot but not boiling. To each gallon 
of vinegar add one ounce of allspice and one of black pepper. 
When cold, cover them. Should the outer skin shrivel, peel 
it off. They must look quite clear. 

475. DO. (2). — Ingredients — Onions, vinegar, allspice, whole black 

pepper. 
To each quart of vinegar allow a dessertspuunhil of allspice 
and one of whole black pepper ; take off the outer skin with

the fingers, the next skin should be taken off with a plated or 
silver knife ; it may be found necessary to remove a third skin 
if the onions do not look perfectly clear. As the onions are 
prepared drop them into jars ; then cover with cold vinegar, 
adding allspice and whole pepper as directed ; cover very 
tightly and in three weeks they will be ready for use. This is 
a most excellent receipt for onions. They should be eaten with- 
in six or seven months, as they will not be crisp after that 
time. 

476. WALITUTS- — Ingredients — Fifty walnuts (seasonable for 

pickling early in July). To each pint of vinegar allow 1 oz. of 
black pepper, half an ounce of allspice, and half an ounce of 
bruised ginger. 
Prick the walnuts with a fork, and put them in a brine (com- 
posed of one pound of salt, to each quart of water). Let them 
remain in this nine days, changing the brine three times. Put 
them in the sun until they turn black ; put them into jars, al- 
lowing sufficient room to cover them with vinegar ; boil (or 
scald) vinegar and spices in the above proportions. Cover 
closely and keep dry. They can be used in six weeks. 

477. J71yIE0 FICIZLE- — Ingredients — Cabbage, salt, onion, pep- 

per and celery seed, strong vinegar. 

Take a head of cabbage ; chop fine, sprinkle with salt ; let it 
remain thus for twelve hours; then mix an onion finely minced 
with the cabbage ; drain through a cullender ; add a good 
quantity of pepper and celery seed. Put it in a jar and cover 
with vinegar. Ready for use in three days. 

478. HED OABBAG-B- — Ingredients — Cabbage, beetroot, vinegar, 

spice. 
Slice it into a cullender, and sprinkle each layer with salt ; 
let it draia two days, then put it into a jar, and pour hot vine- 
gar enough to cover, and put a few slices of red beet-root. 
Observe to choose the purple red cabbage. Those who like 
the flavor >)f spice will boil it with the vinegar. Cauliflower 
cut in branches, and thrown in after being salted, will look of 
a beautiful red. 

479. lATTSHZlOOIMS- — Ingredients — Button mushrooms, pepper* 

mace, salt and vinegar. 
Buttons must be rubbed with a bit of flannel and salt ; and 
from the larger take out the red inside, for when they are 
black they will not do, being too old. Throw a little salt 
over, and put them into a stewpan with some mace and 
pepper ; as the liquor comes out, shake them well, and keep 
them over a gentle fire till all of it be dried into them again ; 



Pickles. mrs. Clarke's cookery book. 145 

then put as much vinegar into the pan as will cover them, give 
it one warm, and turn all into a glass or stone jar. They 
will keep two years, and are delicious. 

480. LEMONS- — Ingredients — Lemons, salt, vinegar, rape vine- 

gar, Jamaica pepper and ginger, mustard seed, garlic. 

They should be small, and with a thick rind ; rub them with 
a piece of flannel ; then slit them half down in four quarters, 
but not through to the pulp ; fill the slits with salt hard pressed 
in, set them upright in a pan for four or five days, until the 
salt melts ; turn them thrice a day in their own liquid, until 
tender; make enough pickle to cover them, of rape vinegar, 
the brine of the lemons, Jamaica pepper and ginger ; boil and 
skim it ; when cold, put it to the lemons, with two ounces of 
mustard seed, and two cloves of garlic to six lemons. When 
the lemons are used, the pickle will be useful in fish or other 
sauces. 

481. CAPERS- — Ingredients — Vinegar, capers. 

Add fresh vinegar that has been scalded, and become cold, 
and tie them close to keep out the air, which makes them 
soft. 

482. 0T70TJMBERS- — Ingredients — Cucumbers, pepper, ginger, 

vinegar. 

Cut, the cucumbers into slices about half an inch thick ; 
sprinkle with salt, and let them remain twenty-four hours, then 
drain for seven hours. Pour the hot vinegar over them. Keep 
them in a warm place for a short time. Tie them down with 
bladder and you may use them in a few days. 

483. FICALILLI- — Ingredients — Small cucumbers, button onions, 

small bunches of cauliflower, carrots, ginger, grapes, strips 
of horse-radish, radishes, bean pods, cayenne pods, 4 quarts 
of white wine vinegar, 4 tablespoonfuls of salt, mustard and 
flour, 2 tablespoonfuls of ground ginger, pepper, allspice and 
turmeric. 

The brine for this pickle is made by putti ig a pint of rock 
salt into a pail of boiling water. Put the vegetables for pick- 
ling into the brrnc ana cover iignny to prevent the steam es- 
caping. Allow them to stand a night and a day. Change 
the brine a second time and allow them to remain the same 
length of time. The second brine may be used a second time 
if skimmed and scalded. Choose pickles from the brine of an 
equal size and of various colors. Great taste may be displayed 
in the arrangement of the pickles when putting them in bot- 
tles. To four quarts of white wine vinegar add the spices. 
Simmer these together (the mustard and turmeric must be

blended together with a little vinegar before they are added to 
the liquor) ; when the liquor is on the point of boiling, pour 
into a vessel ; cover tightly. When sufficiently cold pour into 
the bottles containing the pickle, and make air-tight. It will 
be ready for use in five or six months. 

^4. EGGS- — Ingredients— Thirty-two eggs, 2 quarts of vinegar, 

1 oz. of black pepper, 1 oz. of Jamaica pepper, 1 oz. of gin- 
ger. 

Boil the eggs hard (ten or twelve minutes would be suffi- 
cient time). Dip them in a pan of cold water for a minute 
to prevent them turning black, and remove the shells. Allow 
the remaining ingredients to simmer gently in a saucepan for 
ten minutes or a quarter of an hour. Put the eggs into your 
pickling jar and pour over the boiling vinegar, pepper and 
ginger. Let them stand till cold and make air tight. Ready 
for use from a month to six weeks. 

485. BEETS- — Ingredients — Vinegar, beets, 2 oz. of whole pepper, 

2 oz. of allspice to every gallon of vinegar. 

Carefully remove all dirt from the beets. Let them simmer 
in boiling water for one hour and a half, then take them out 
and leave to cool. Boil the remaining ingredients for ten or 
fifteen minutes and leave to cool. When cold pour it over the 
beets (which you have previously pared and cut into thin 
slices). Make air-tight and they will be ready for eating in a 
week or ten days. 



EGGS. 

OBSERVATIONS ON EGGS. 

As a rule the quality of eggs largely depends upon the 
food given to the hen. The eggs of the common hen or 
barn door fowl are esteemed most delicate when new laid, 
and for invalids they are exceedingly nutritious beaten up 
raw. The white of the egg, from its tendency to coagulate 
into a hard and indigestible substance, is likely to disagree 
with some invalids when the yolk may prove perfectly harm- 
less. About one-third of the entire weight of an egg may 
be regarded as nitrogenous and nutritious matter ; a 
greater proportion than that of meat, which is rated at only 
from 25 % to 28 %. The lightest way of cooking them 
is by poaching. It is a good plan in testing new laid eggs 
to apply the tongue to the large end of the egg, and if per- 
fectly fresh will feel warm, or they can be held to the light 
and if perfectly clear will be good ; or try them in water — the 
freshest will sink first. Always keep them in a cool place. 

It is said that covering eggs with a solution of beeswax 
m warm olive oil (one-third of beeswax, two-thirds of olive 
oil) will keep them fresh for two years. 

The following recipe has been used by an old house- 
keeper for about fourteen years, and has never been known 
to fail : To five quarts of water put one pound of salt, and 
one ounce of saltpetre; boil them ten minutes, and when 
nearly cold add four spoonfuls of unslacked lime. Let this 
stand two days, stirring it very frequently, then put your 
eggs into a pipkin [i.e., a large earthern jar with straight 
sides, about a foot or more deep), the narrow end of the 
egg downwards, and pour the mixture over when it is clear. 



486. POACHED EG-GS (on Toast). —Ingredients— Two or more

a little cream, salt, pepper, nutmeg, the least bit of cayenne, 
and some finely-minced parsley; put in the oysters, and toss 
them in this sauce just long enough to make them quite hot ; 
stir into this ofifthe fire the yolk of an egg beaten up with juice 
of half a lemon, and strained. Insert this in the fold of a plain 
omelet, or serve it round the omelet. 

524. Do, (Kidnoy.) — Ingredients — Sheep's kidneys, butter, pepper 

and salt to taste, finely minced parsley, flour, white wine and 
stock, a squeeze of lemon. 

Parboil some sheep's kidneys, cut them in slices, and toss 
them in butter, with pepper and salt to taste, and some finely- 
minced parsley ; mix, in a saucepan, a small quantity of butter 
and flour, add equal quantities of white wine and stock, put in 
the kidneys, toss them until done, then add a squeeze of lemon 
and serve in or round the omelet. 

525. EG&S (to Eeep Fresh for Several "Weeks). 

Fill a saucepan with three or four quarts of boiling water. 
Put two dozen eggs into a cabbage or onion net and hold them 
in the boiling water for twenty seconds. Continue this opera- 
tion until you have as many eggs as you wish to preserve. 
Have some sawdust in boxes and pack them in it. At the end 
of two or three months the eg?s will be found quite good 
enough for culinary purposes. Eggs can be kept lor a long 
time if the shells are smeared with butter or sweet oil, then 
packed in plenty of sawdust, not allowing the eggs to touch 
each other. Another way is to plunge them in lime water di- 
rectly they have been laid, and allow the vessel to stand in a 
cool cellar. Eggs for preserving should not be more than 
twenty-four hours old, and should be collected in fine weather. 
Take care the eggs are covered with the lime water, and it is a 
good plan to lay a piece of board op the top of the eggs with a 
little lime and salt upon it. 



KETCHUPS. 



526. MUSHROOM KETCHUP.— Ingredients— To 2 gallons of 

mushrooms, ^ lb. salt ; to every quart of mushroom liquor, 
allow a small saltspoonful of cayenne, a teaspoonful of all- 
spice, a teaspoonful of ginger, 2 blades of pounded mace, 
Select some freshly gathered (gather in dry weather or 
else the ketchup will not keep), full-sized mushrooms. Lay in 
an earthenware pan in layers, first a layer of mushrooms and 
then one of salt, and so on until all are used. Allow them to 
stand a while (say five or six hours). Then break to pieces 
with the hand, place in the refrigerator for three days, stirring 
or mashing them occasionally. Extract as much juice as 
possible, measure the liquor without straining, adding to each 
quart the above mentioned spices. Pour into a stone jar, ex- 
clude the air ; place the jar in a saucepan of boiling water 
and allow to boil three hours. When this is done pour the 
contents of the jar into a stewpan and allow it to simmer gently 
for half an hour. Pour into a vessel, place in refrigerator till 
the next day. Pour off into another vessel and strain. Have 
ready some clean dry bottles and to each pint of ketchup it is a 
great improvement to add a few drops of brandy ; pour into 
the bottles, taking care not to squeeze the mushrooms, and al- 
low the sediment to remain at the bottom of the vessel, (if 
wanted very clear and bright, the liquor must be strained after 
the above operation through a flannel bag). Cork and seal. 
Examine occasionally and if there is any sign of spoilinj^ boil 
again with a few peppercorns. The sediment may be bottled 
for immediate use. 

527. LEMON KETCHUP- — Ingredients — One dozen lemons, ^ a 

breakfast cupful of white mustard seed, 1 eggcupful of tur- 
meric and white pepper, \ an eggcupful of cloves and mace, 
\ a small teacupful of white sugar, 1 saltspoonful of cayenne, 
I a small teacupful of horse radish, ^ a small teacupful of 
salt, 4 shallots. 
Finely grate the rind of lemons, pound the spices in a mor- 
tar, grate the horse-radish. Thoroughly blend these ingred- 
ients, then sprinkle the salt over all, extract the juice from the 
lemons and add to the mixture. Allow to stand in a cool 
place for three or four hours. Boil in an enamelled kettle 
thirty minutes, pour into a stone jar, cover tightly. Stir every 
day for fourteen days, then strain, bottle and seal.

saucepan, and boil until perfectly soft, and the pulp dissolved ; 

work through a cullender, then through a hair sieve. Place 

upon the stove adding the remaining ingredients (the celery 

seed must be confined in a muslin bag), and boil six hours. 

Stir occasionally for the first five hours and all the last hour. 

Pour into a stone jar ; allow to stand from twelve to fourteen 

hours in a cool place. When perfectly cool add a pint of 

strong vinegar. Remove the celery seed ; bottle, cork, and 

seal. Exclude from the light. 

629. Do. (2). — Ingredients — Ripe tomatoes, to every lb. of juice 
add a pint of vinegar, a dessertspoonful of sliced garlic, a 
small teaspoonful of salt and white pepper.

bake till tender. Strain and work through a sieve, and add 
the above ingredients. Pour into a stewpan and boil until the 
ingredients are perfectly soft. Work through the sieve a 
second time and to every pound squeeze the juice of three 
lemons. Boil again until of the thickness of cream. Set 
aside to get cold. Bottle, cork and seal, and keep in a dry, 
dark place. 

530. WALNUT SETOHTTP.— Ingredients— Wabiuts, salt, to 

every 2 quarts of walnut liquor allow 1 oz. each of allspice, 
ginger, black pepper, cloves, mace. 

Wash the shells of walnuts, bruize them slightly, put them 
with salt in a stone jar for two or three weeks until they fer- 
ment, then boil them up, strain off the liquor, add to every 
two quarts one ounce each of allspice, ginger, black pepper, 
cloves, and mace ; boil the whole one hour; let it cool, bottle 
it, and tie a bladder over the corks. 

531. Z^USTAUD (to make). 

Mix the best Durham flour of mustard by degrees with boil- 
ing water to a proper thickness, rubbing it perfectly smooth ; 
add a little salt, and keep it in a small jar closely covered, and 
put only as much into the glass as will be used soon, which 
should be wiped daily round the edges. 

532. Anotlier vrs.7, for immediate use. 

Mix the mustard with new milk by degrees, to be quite 
smooth, and add a little raw cream. It is much softer this 
way, is not bitter, and will keep well.

ins, 3 oz. salt, 2 pints vinegar, 3 oz. garlic. 

Chop the gooseberries and the raisins (after being stoned) 
quite fine, also the onions and garlic almost to a paste ; add 
one ounce cayenne, and a proper quantity of turmeric to make 
it a nice color. When well mixed, boil ten minutes or quarter 
of an hour, and rub through a sieve. 

641. HERBS (to Dry). 

Gather the herbs for drying before they begin to flower. 
Free from dirt and dust and tie in bunches having previously 
removed the roots. Dry in the oven or before the fire, in 
either case, dry quickly as the flavor is better preserved by 
quick drying. Upon no consideration allow them to burn. 
Tie up in paper bags and hang in a dry place. N. B. — Take 
care to gather the herbs on a dry day. 

542. MT MOTHER'S OHTJTNEE— Ingredients— Half a lb. 

brown sugar. \ lb. salt, \ lb. garlic, \ lb. onions, \ lb. ginger,

pound as finely as possible, then mix all together thoroughly. 
Keep in glass bottles tightly corked. 

545. PARSLEY (to keep for "winter use). 

Take fresh bunches of parsley and plunge into boilii j water 
slightly salted, boiling for three or four minutes. Remove 
from the water, and drain dry very quickly before the fire, and 



i6o MRS. Clarke's COOKERY BOOK. Ketchups. 

put in bottles for use. Soak in tepid water five minutes when 
required for cooking. 

546. GAELIC VIlTEGAXl. 

Steep an ounce of garlic in two quarts of the best white 
wirie vinegar ; add a nutmeg scraped. This vinegar is much 
esteemed by the French.

room ketchup, ^ pint of walnut pickle, 2 tablespoonfuls of 

Chili vinegar, 2 shallots. 
Take one and a half pts. of freshly made mushroom ketchup, 
peel the shallots and add them to the ketchup and allow it to 
simmer for ten minutes, then add the pickle and vinegar and 
boil again for ten minutes. Stand in a cool place, and when 
perfectly cold, bottle, and having placed a small piece of shal- 
lot in each bottle, cork and set by for use. 

548. OYSTER KETOHUT (without the liquor).— ingredients 

— One pint of oysters, 1 pint of sherry, 3 tablespoonfuls of 
salt, 1 drachm of cayenne, 2 drachms of ground mace.

and put it, the oysters and sherry into a stewpan to scald. 
Strain and pound the oysters in a mortar with the seasoning. 
When pounded to a pulp add the oyster liquor and boil five 
minutes. Skim, work through a sieve, allow it to stand until 
perfectly cool, and it is ready to bottle. Cork well, and seal 
the c'>rka. 



FORCEMEATS. 



OBSERVATIONS ON FORCEMEATS. 

Whether in the form of stufifing-balls or for patties, 
forcemeat makes a considerable part of good cooking, by 
the flavor it imparts to the dish it accompanies, and con- 
siderable care should be taken in cooking it. It is often 
the case^ at many excellent tables where everything else is 
well done, to find very bad forcemeat or stuffing. 



549. FORCEMEAT (to force Fowls or Meat)— Ingredients— 

A little ham or gammon, veal, or fowl, beef-suet, onion, par- 
sley, lemon-peel, salt, nutmeg, pounded mace, white pepper

the celery until soft, drain, and mix with the lobster, bread- 
crumbs, seasoning, and the yolk of one hard-boiled egg. 

L i6i 



1 62 MRS. Clarke's COOKERY BOOK. Forcemeats. 

Pound well for a quarter of an hour, warm the butter, and mix 
with two beaten eggs ; add this to the lobster and other ingre- 
dients. Dip your hands in flour, form the mixture into little 
balls, fry in butter, and serve in fish soup. 

553. FORCEMEAT (for Fowls). — Ingredients— Quarter lb. of 

suet, 2 oz. of ham, the grated rind of half a lemon, a dessert 
spoonful of minced parsley, 1 teaspoonful of minced sweet 
herbs, cayenne, salt, grounded mace to taste, 7 oz, of bread- 
crumbs, 2 eggs. 
Cut the ham into small, thin strips, chop the suet finely, also 
the lemon peel ; add the seasoning, then the crumbs ; thor- 
oughly blend, and after the eggs have been well beaten add to 
the other ingredients, and it is ready for use. If wished for 
balls, fry a golden brown in hot lard. 

554. FORCEMEAT BALLS (for Mock Turtle)-— Ingredients-

parsley, shallot, yolks of 3 hard-boiled eggs, pepper, salt, 
curry powder or cayenne, yolks of 2 uncooked eggs. 

Take the pounded veal and rub through a sieve, with an 
equ^l quantity of udder, [or if there is no udder at hand one- 
third of the quantity of butter will do instead. Then place the 
bread-crumbs into a stewpan and mix with it a very small quan- 
tity of milk, enough to moisten it. Add to this the chopped 
parsley and shallot, and mix well until they have become a 
paste ; pour through a sieve and leave to cool. When cold 
pound it and mix well together. Have ready the yolks of three 
hard-boiled eggs, add these and some pepper and salt, curry 
powder or cayenne for seasoning ; then add the yolks of the 
two uncooked eggs, rub all well together, and shape into balls. 
Place in the soup ten or fifteen minutes before serving.

BREAD AND CAKES, 



OBSERVATIONS ON BREAD. 

Of all articles of food, bread is perhaps the most import- 
ant, therefore it is necessary to be well acquainted with 
the quality of the ingredients and the art of making it. 
Flour ought to be a few weeks old before being used, and 
care must be taken to keep it perfectly dry. Genuine flour 
will hold together in a mass when pressed with the hand. 
American flour requires almost twice as much water to 
make it into bread, as is used for English flour, and there- 
fore it is more profitable, for a stone of the American which 
weighs 14 lbs. will make 215^ lbs. of bread, but the best 
sort of English flour produces only 18^ lbs. In wet 
weather, or when wheat is badly stored, causing it to be 
damp, the soluble albuminoids which it possesses act upon 
the insoluble gluten causing it to decompose, and at once 
generating dextrin by their action on the starch of the 
grain, consequently the flour prepared from such grain is 
poor in gluten and rich in dextrin, the consequence being 
that when used it produces heavy bread, therefore it is of the 
utmost importance to purchase only the best quality of 
flour, for it is the truest economy. Do not place the sponge 
or dough too near the fire, as some cooks are liable to do 
in cold weather, or the quality of bread will be endangered. 
The proper heat should be gentle and equal for fermenta- 
tion. Care must aiso oe taicen 10 luix and knead (brisk 
and long kneading will fully repay for the trouble) when 
it has reached the point for either. Some authorities say 
the heat of the oven should rise to 280° and after a 
quarter of an hour slacken to 220', others from 300° 
to 400'. The cook must be guided by experience as to 
exact degree of heat. Doubtless the bread will require a 
brisk oven, and should take about an hour to an hour and 
a half to bake. 

164 



Bread. mrs. Clarke's cookery book. 165 



OBSERVATIONS ON CAKES. 

For good cakes (as in bread) it is of great importance to 
use no ingredients, but those of the finest quality. The 
flour must be dry and sifted. It will be found a good plan 
after purchasing currants, to wash in three waters, pick and 
dry in a cloth. Then look them carefully over, discard- 
ing any stone, stalk, or grit. Lay before the fire or in the 
sun to dry. Put by in jar, and they will always be ready 
for use. Eggs should be well whisked, the whites and yolks 
beaten separately and strained. Butter must not be al- 
lowed to oil. Lemon peel should be cut thinly as possible. 
Sugar should be finely powdered. When soda is used it 
is a good plan to dissolve it in warm water. When all the 
ingredients are mixed, vigorous and patient beating will 
greatly add to the lightness of the cake. The heat of the 
oven is of great importance for cakes, especially those that 
are large. If not pretty quick, the batter will not rise. 
Should you fear its catching by being too quick, put some 
paper over the cake to prevent its being burnt. If not long 
enough lighted to have a body of heat, or it is become 
slack, the cake will be heavy. To know when it is soaked, 
take a broom straw, and pierce into the very centre, draw it 
instantly out, and if the least stickiness adheres, put the 
cake immediately in, and shut up the oven. 



558. YEAST (I)-— Ingredients — A double handfnl of hops, i doz. 

potatoes, j gal. of water, 1 or ^ cupful of ginger, small cup 
of flour, a cup of brown sugar, ^ cup of salt, a cupful of 
good yeast. 

Allow the hops and potatoes to boil together in one-half 
gallon of water till done ; strain and mash the ginger, then 
add remaining ingredients, excepting the yeast. Let stand 
until cool, then add the yeast. Next day cork up tight in a 
jug. 

559. YEAST (2). — Ingredients— Two oz. of hops, 1 gal. of water, 

a handful of salt, 1 lb. of best flour, 3 lbs. of potatoes. 
Boil the hops in a gallon of water for half an hour ; strain 
it, and let it cool down to the heat of new milk ; then put the 
salt and moist sugai ; beat the flour with some of the liquor, 



1 66 MRS. Clarke's cookery book. Bread. 

and then mix all together. Two days after, add the pota- 
toes, boiled and then masbed, to stand for four-and-twenty- 
hours ; then put it into bottles, and it will be ready for use. 
Stir it frequently while making, and keep it warm. Before 
using, shake the bottle up well. It will keep in a cool place 
for two months. 

560. YEAST (Compressed). 

This yeast will make good and wholesome bread, but bread 
made from it will not keep as long as with brewers or home- 
made yeast. Potatoes mixed with the dough will keep it 
moist longer. 

561. POTATO YEAST-— Ingredients— To every lb. of potatoes 2 

oz. of treacle, 2 large spoonfuls of yeast. 

This is made of mealy potatoes boiled thoroughly soft ; they 
are skinned and mashed as smooth as possible ; as much hot 
water should then be put on them as will make a mash of the 
consistency of good beer yeast. Add to the potatoes the 
treacle ; and when just warm, stir in the yeast. Keep it 
warm till it has done fermenting, and in twenty-four hours 
it will be fit for use. One pound of potatoes will make nearly 
a quart of yeast ; and i is said to be equally as good as brewers' 
yeast. 

562. HOME-MADE BREAD (l).— Ingredients— Four lbs. of 

flour, 1 tablespoonful of solid brewers' yeast, 1^ pints of luke- 
warm milk and water, salt. 

Put the flour into a deep pan, sprinkle a little salt into it, 
hollow out the middle with a wooden spoon (take care to leave 
the bottom of the pan well covered with flour). Next take 
the yeast, which has been made solid by liberally mixing with 
cold water and allowing it to settle twenty-four hours. Then 
proceed to pour the yeast into the hole in the flour, and mix 
with it as much flour as is round about it until it is of the con- 
sistency of thick batter ; be careful there are no lumps. Sift 
plenty of flour over the top, cover with a clean cloth, 
and set it where the air is warm and equal. Allow 
to stand an hour or a little longer, and if the yeast has 
broken through it is then ready to be made into dough. 
Pour into the sponge the remaining milk and water. Mix into 
it as much of the flour as you can with the spoon. Now take 
plenty of the flour, sprinkle on the top of the leaven, and pro- 
ceed to knead Lhskly, and when perfectly free from lumps 
and does n'^ adhere to the hands, it may be covered with a 
cloth and left to rjse a second time. When it begins to 



Bread. mrs. clarke's cookery book. 167 

crack, which will be in about three-quarters of an hour, it can 
be formed into loaves and baked. In forming the loaves divide 
in two and make up the shape and size required, and with 
a sharp knife make incisions in the top of each loaf. If baked 
in tins, take care to grease them before using. When baked 
stand on end to allow the steam to evaporate. The dough 
can be made without making a sponge (if desired) by mixing 
the yeast with the best part of the milk and water, and after a 
little salt has been added proceed to work up the whole of the 
flour at once, and then act as above. The dough will soften 
in the rising, so it should be made firm at first. 

563. nOME-MADE SBEAD (2). 

Put the flour into a large pan ; mix in a dessertspoonful of 
salt ; make a hole in the middle, and pour in the yeast (half a 
teacup of yeast to two quarts of flour), with about a pint of 
water or milk (which use warm in winter, and cold in summer), 
not mixing in all the flour ; then put a blanket, or towel, over 
the pan, and let it stand to rise, near the fire in winter. This 
is " putting bread in sponge." When it has risen, mix all the 
flour with the sponge ; knead it well, and let it stand two hours 
till quite light. Then mould the dough on a board till elastic, 
and put the loaves into greased or floured baking-tins ; prick 
them two or three times through with a fork ; let them rise 
again for a quarter of an hour, and bake them in a quick 
oven. 

564. WHITE BREAD- — Ingredients — Sponge, a pan of butter- 

milk, or sour milk, flour, teacupfui of yeast. 

For the sponge take a pan of buttermilk or sour milk which 
has just turned thick. Put it on the stove and scald. When 
the curd is well separated from the whey strain or skim it out. 
Let the whey cool until it will not scald, then stir in the 
flour, beating thoroughly. It should be about as thick as 
batter for griddle cakes. Sweet milk, or even water may be 
used as wetting for the sponge, if good sour milk or buttermilk 
cannot be had. But fresh buttermilk is, perhaps, the best of 
all. When the sponge is about milkwarm, beat in a teacupfui 
of yeast. One teacupfui of the yeast is enough for three 
ordinary white loaves, one loaf of brown bread and a tin of 
rolls. The sponge should be made at night. Let it stand 
until morning. Unless the weather is very cold, it is not nec- 
essary to put it near the fire. In the morning, when the 
sponge is light, take out enough for your loaf of brown bread. 
Mix the remainder with flour, taking care not to put in too 
much, as that will make the bread dry and hard. Knead half

an hour. The whiteness and delicacy of the bread will be 
much increased by thorough kneading. Put the dough away 
to rise again. When it is light, if you wish to make rolls, 
save enough of the dough for that purpose. Make the re- 
mainder into loaves. Set them away to rise. Wnen light, 
bake. 

565. 7EAST BRBAID — Ingredients — Yeast, 12 potatoes, 3 

large tablespooiifuls of Hour, 2 each of sugar and salt, 2 
yeast cakes, to every loaf of bread allow 1 pint of yeast. 

To tnake the yeast pare twelve medium-sized potatoes and 
put them in a kettle to boil. While they are boiling put in a 
pan three heaped tablespoonfuls of flour, two each of sugar 
and salt. Pour slowly over these a pint of boiling water, 
stirring constantly to free from lumps. When soft mash the 
potatoes and add to the contents of the pan. Now pour in a 
quart of cold water and one of boiling water. Set aside till 
cool enough to bear your finger In. Stir in two yeast cakes 
dissolved in a little water. Keep warm till a foam rises over 
the top, when it is ready for use. For each loaf of the brc.iJ 
take one pint of the yeast, no other wetting being required. 
Make a hole in the centre of a pan of floui, pour in the yeast 
and stir it thick as possible, cover and set in a warm place to 
rise, which will be in about two hours — sometimes less — now 
mix into loaves, let it rise again, and bake from a half to three 
quarters of an hour. A great advantage of this bread is, it is 
HO quickly made. If the yeast should become a little sour, a 
pinch of soda may be put in when first stirred for bread. 

566. FLAIIT BBEAD- — Ingredients — Half lb. of white flour, 1 

teaspoonful of baking powder, a pinch of salt, J pint of 
milk and water. 

The simplest way of making bread in small quantities is <ns 
follows : — Take X lb. of white flour, and, whilst in a dry state, 
mix in thoroughly a small teaspoonful baking powder and a 
pinch of salt. Then add about a quarter of a pint of milk and 
water, or water alone ; knead it as quickly as possible, and 
put immediately into a very hot oven ; the whole secret of 
making light bread after this fashion lies in attention to these 
last rules. If the oven is well heated, it vv'ill rise almost dir- 
ectly, and it should be baked until the outside is quite crisp 
and hard. I generally knead mine into the desired shape, but 
they can be baked in tins if preferred. For brown bread, I 
use three parts of brown and one of white flour, and a little 
extra baking powder ; also adding a little more water, if neces- 
sary, to mix it.

comes perfectly soft ; when it is of a proper warmth, mix it 
extremely well with four pounds of flour, and yeast and salt 
as for other bread ; of yeast about four large spoonfuls ; knead 
it extremely well ; then set it to rise before the fire. Some 
of the flour should be reserved to make up the loaves. If the 
rice should require more water, it must be added, as some 
rice swells more than others. 

568. rRENOH BREAD.— Ingredients— Jpk. of fine flour, yolks 

of .3 and whites of 2 eggs, salt, ^ pt. of good yeast, i pt. of 
milk.

and whites of two eggs, beaten and strained, a little salt, half 
a pint of good yeast, that is not bitter, and as much milk, made 
a little warm, as will work into a thin light dough ; stir it about, 
but don't knead it ; have ready three quart wooden dishes, 
dinde the dough among them, set to rise, then turn them out 
into the oven, which must be quick. Rasp when done.

2 parts of Graham flour, one-third white flour, to every qt. of 

this add a large breakfast cup of Indian meal, 2 saltspoonfuls 

of salt, for a good sized loaf allow ^ a cup of molasses. 

Take the Graham and white flour, Indian meal, and salt, in 

the above proportions, and mix this up with the sponge, then 

pour in the molasses. If it cannot be brought to the proper 

congruity (which should be very soft) with the sponge, add a 

little warm water ; be careful to knead it well and for a long 

time ; then allow it to rise ; it will take longer than white bread ; 

then make into loaves, and bake carefully. When baked allow 

to cool before cutting. 

570. DO- (2). — Ingredients — 1 pt. of brown flour, J cup of yeast,

on a floured plate, and set in the oven to warm ; drop in boiling 
1 lid, and fry longer than cakes made with baking powder. If 
Uie dough is light enough, and you heat it before dropping in 
the lard, your doughnuts will be delicious. 

G07. buttehmilk cakes. 

Take one pint of buttermilk, and stir into it as much flour as 
will form a dough, with one tablespoonful of dissolved carbon- 
aie of ammonia; roll the dough out in sheets, cut the cakes, 
and bake them in a moderate oven. The carbonate of ammo- 
nia may be obtained at any of the druggists ; it is the common 
smelling-salts, without any of the aromatic drugs. It never 
imparts any taste to the food, as the heat disengages the car- 
bonic acid gas and the ammonia. 

60S. MUSH OAKBS-— Ingredients— One qt. of milk, J pound of 

butter, flour enough to make a dough, salt according to taste, 

Indian meal sufHcieut to thicken the milk, half a pint of yeast.

with cold milk, as will make a mush as thick as batter ; add 

the butter and salt while the mush is hot ; as soon as it bf:- 

comes lukewarm stir in the yeast and as much flour as will 

form a dough ; cover it and stand it to rise. When light, make 

it out into biscuits, put them in buttered pans, and, as soon as 

they rise again, bake them in a hot oven. These cakes are 

very nice. 

G09. BXTCKWHEAT CAKES-— Ingredients— One pint of buck- 
wheat meal, 1 qt. of water, salt according to taste, 1 gill of 
home-made yeast. 
Mix the water (which should be lukewarm if the weather is 
cold) with the meal ; add the salt and yeast ; beat it well ; when 
light, bake them on a griddle. Grease the griddle; pour on a 
little of the batter ; spread it so as to form a cake about the size 
of a bre<>kfast-plate ; the cakes should be very smooth at the 
edges. When they are done on one side, turn them; when brown 
on both sides, put some butter on the plate, put the cake on it, 
butter the top, bake another and put on it, butter hot, and send 
them to the table. Buckwheat cakes are much better if they 
are sent to the table with only one or two on the plate. 

610. RYE BATTER CAKES —Ingredients— One pint of rye 
meal enough lukewarm milk to make a thin batter, salt ac- 
cording to taste, one 1 ill of home-made yeast.

bake in jelly tins in a brisk oven. When cool, chocolate frost- 
ing put between the cakes makes them very delicious, or jelly if 
preferred. 

613. JELLY ROLLS-— Ingredients— 3 eggs, J a cupful of butter. 

1^ teaspoonsful of baking powder, § of a cup of pulverized 
sugar, 1 cupful of flour, a little salt. 

Bake in shallow pans — a dripping-pan well buttered is good 
for this purpose ; put in the dough till it is about half an inch 
thick ; take it carefully from the tins when baked and lay on a 
cloth ; spread jelly over it evenly with a knife ; roll while hot ; 
if this is not done the cake will crumble.

Cakes. mrs. Clarke's cookery book. 179 

Add the dissolved saleratus and the eggs, after they have been 
well beaten, to the remaining half of cold milk. Pour the 
boiling milk over the meal and let it cool. Then add the cold 
milk and saleratus. Bake in a shallow pan. 

617. INDIAIT MEAL BREAKFAST OAKES.-Ingredients- 

1 qt. of Indian meal, 2 eggs, 1 teaspoonful of dissolved saler- 
atus, ^ oz. of butter, salt to taste, milk sufficient to make a 
thick batter. 
Beat the eggs very thick and light. Cut up the butter into 
the meal ; then pour over enough boiling water to wet it. 
When it is cool add the eggs and salt ; pour the dissolved 
saleratus into the milk, and add as much milk as will make it 
into a thick batter. Butter square tin pans, fill them about two- 
thirds full, and bake in a quick oven. When done, cut into 
squares and serve hot. 

618. lOIlTG rOR OASES (l).— Ingredients— Four eggs, 1 lb. of 

finely powdered white sugar, vanilla, strawberry, lemon, or 

any other flavoring. 
Take the whites of the eggs, and beat well adding the sugar 
to stiffen in small quantities ; continue until you have beaten 
the eggs to a stiff froth ; it will take about half an hour if well 
beaten all the time ; if not stiff enough then add more sugar; 
spread carefully on the cake with a broad bladed knife ; to 
color icing yellow, put the grated peel of a lemon (or orange) 
into a piece of muslin, strain a little juice through it and press 
hard into the other ingredients. Strawberry juice or cranberry 
syrup colors a pretty pink color, 

619. ICING- POE. CAKES (2).— Ingi-edients— The whites of two 

eggs, 4 lb. of castor sugar, and the juice of a lemon or a 
few drops of orange flower water. 
Beat the mixture until it hangs upon the fork in flakes, then 
spread over the cake, dipping the knife in cold water occasion- 
ally ; stand it before the fire, and keep turning the cake con- 
stantly, or the sugar will catch and turn brown ; as soon as it 
begins to harden it may be removed ; the icing must not be 
put on until the cake itself is cold, otherwise it will not set. A 
few drops of cochineal will color it if desired. 

620. EXCELLENT FROSTira. 

Take one cup of granulated sugar and four tablespoons of 
hot v.rater, boil them together until it threads from the spoon, 
stirring often. Beat the white of one egg until firm ; when 
the sugar is ready set it from the stove long enough to 
stop boiling, then pour on to the egg slowly, but continu- 
ally, beating rapidly ; continue to beat until of the right 
consistency to spread on the cake and flavor while beat-

sng ; it hardens very quickly after it is ready to put on the cake, 
so it is best to have the white of another egg ready to add a 
little if it gets too hard to spread smoothly. Boil the sugar 
the same as for candy ; when right for candy it is right for 
frosting ; if at last it hardens very rapidly it has been boiled 
too hard ; but a little white of egg will rectify it. Or if not 
boiled enough (that is, if it remains too thin after beaten until 
cold) put in pulverized sugar, adding a little and beating hard, 
then if not just right, a little more and beat again until thick 
enough. 

The one thing is to have the sugar boiled just right ; if you 
hit that point you will not have a bit of trouble, if not, it will 
require " doctoring," as I have told you. A good deal depends 
upon stirring the sugar into the white of the egg at first ;-if too 
fast or too slow it will cook the egg in lumps ; if you should 
not get it just right at first do not be discouraged ; when once 
you get it perfect you will never make it any other way. This 
quantity is for one cake. 

621. ALMOND lOINGrOROAKES.— Ingredients— Four eggs. 

a small quantity of rose water, and to every lb. of sweet 
almonds add 1 lb. of powdered loaf sugar.

next beat the whites of the eggs to a firm froth ; add to the 
almonds mixing in the sugar, and stir all well together(be sure 
it is nice and smooth). After spreading on the cakes cover with 
plain icing, after this, if desired, pop it in the oven to dry, and 
harden.

being done stick a piece of broom straw into it. This answers 
the same purpose as a knife and is better, as the knife is apt 
to make the cake heavy. Turn the cake on end to allow 
the steam to evaporate.

so as to leave the shape intact ; fill the cavity with strawberry 
preserve, then cover with a layer of cake, and place it in a 
glass dish to soak with a little light wine and brandy and water. 
This should be poured gently over it with a spoon until all the 
wine is absorbed ; then stick it all over with the sweet almonds 
blanched and cut finely, and lastly fill the dish with custard,

stand even on a glass dish. Make numerous incisions in it 
with a knife, and pour over it the sherry and brandy ; let the 
cake soak these all up. Blanch, peel, and slice the sweet al- 
monds, and stick the cake all over with them. Blanch, chop 
and pound in a mortar a quarter pound of sweet almonds, 
moistening with a little orange-flower water to prevent their 
oiling, add one pint of milk and the yolks of six eggs, sweeten 
to taste with pounded loaf sugar. Stir over the fire till the cus-

a soft paste, which will harden when cold. Make some small 
moulds very hot ; slightly but thorougiily oil them with oil of 
sweet almonds, put some of the mixture in one of them, and 
with the handle of a teaspoon previously oiled, spread it out so 
as completely to line the mould ; trim the edges, and when cold 
turn out the nougat. Having made a number in the same way, 
serve them with sweetmeats inside each. The nougats should 
be very thin. Any kind of mould, large or small, may be used, 
but the work must be done quickly, for the sugar soon becomes 
too stiff to be spread into position. 

654. AFPLE CAI^E- — Ingredients— 1§ lb. of apples cut and 

cored, 1 lb. lump sugar, the juice of three lemons, and about 

half the rinds grated.

lemon to taste. Sprinkle in (beating the mixture all the time) 
half the potato flour, and add the whites of four eggs whisked 
to a stiff froth. Then put in, in the same manner, the rest of 
the flour ; and lastly add the remaining four whites beaten to 
a froth. As soon as the composition is smoothly mixed to- 
gether — and this must be done quickly — pour it into a buttered 
plain mould, and bake it in a slow oven. When quite done, 
turn the cake out of the mould and leave it to get cold. In the 
meantime put the whites of two eggs into a basin, with the 
juice of halt a lemon and some (;lace sugar ; stir the mixture 
briskly witb a wooden spoon, addintj more glace sugar as it gets 
thin, until it becomes a smooth white paste of the consistency 
of butter. Lay the mixture all over the cake with a knife, and 
lay it on as smoothly as possible. Put the cake in the oven 
just long enough for the icing to glaze. Take it out, and before 
the icing has time to cool ornament the cake with preserved 
cherries, small coloured sugarplums, «fcc., in any pattern you 
please.

PASTRY & PUDDINGS. 

OBSERVATIONS. 

A good hand at pastry will use less butter and produce 
lighter crust than others. Salt butter is very good, and if 
well washed makes a good flaky crust. If the weather is 
warm the butter should be placed in ice water to keep it as 
firm as possible ; when lard is used take care it is perfectly 
sweet. 

In making pastry {See Recipes Nos. 820 to 846), as in 
other arts, " practice will make perfect ; " it should be 
touched as lightly as possible, made in a cool place, and 
with hands perfectly cool ; if possible, use a marble slab in- 
stead of a pastry board ; if the latter is used, it is better to 
procure it made of hardwood. 

It is important to use great expedition in the preparation 
of pastry, and care must be taken not to allow it to stand 
long before baking, or it will become flat and heavy. A 
brisk oven will be required for puff pastry ; a good plan to 
test the proper heat is to put a small piece of the paste in 
before baking the whole. Be sure that the oven is as near 
perfection as possible ; for, " an oven in which the heat is 
not evenly distributed can never produce a well-baked pie 
or tart ; where there is an unequal degree of heat the pastry 
rises on the hottest side in the shape of a large bubble and 
sinks into a heavy indigestible lump on the coolest." This 
is a truism which many people must have discovered for 
themselves, as they would be well accustomed to the sight 
of miniature mountains and tableland on their tarts and pies. 
Raised pie crust should have a good soaking heat, and 
glazed pastry rather a slack heat. When suet is used it 
must be perfectly free from .skin and minced as finely as 
possible ; beef suet is considered the best. 

All moulds, pie-dishes, patty-pans, and vessels of all de- 
scriptions used for baking or boiling must be well buttered. 

The outside of a boiled pudding often tastes disagreeably, 
which arises from the cloth not being nicely washed, and 

198 



Puddings. mrs. clarke's cookery book. 199 



kept in a dry place. It should be dipped in boiling water, 
squeezed dry, and floured when to be used. 

If bread, it should be tied loosely, if batter, tightly over. 

The water should boil quickly when the pudding is put in ; 
and it should be moved about for a minute, lest the ingredi- 
ents should not mix. 

Batter pudding should be strained through a coarse sieve 
when all is mixed. In others the eggs separately. 

A pan of cold water should be ready, and the pudding 
dipped in as soon as it comes out of the pot, and then it will 
not adhere to the cloth. 

Very good puddings may be made rcn'^/ioui eggs ; but they 
must have as little milk as will mix, and must boil three or 
four hours. A few spoonfuls of fresh small beer, or one of 
yeast, will answer instead of eggs. 

Snow is an excellent substitute for eggs either in pud- 
dings or pancakes. Two large spoonfuls will supply the 
place of one egg, and the article it is used in will be equally 
good. This is a useful piece of information, especially as 
snow often falls at the season when eggs are the dearest. 
Fresh small beer, or bottled malt liquors, likewise serve in- 
stead of eggs. The snow may be taken up from any clean 
spot before it is wanted, and will not lose its virtue, though 
the sooner it is used the better. 

Nofe. — The yolks and whites beaten long and separately, 
make the article they are put into much lighter.

an ice pail (a common pail will do), place the ice pot in it, and 
build it around with the ice and salt. This done, pour the cream 
into the pot, put on the cover, and never cease turning until 
the cream becomes thick ; move it from the sides occasionally 
with the ice scoop, to prevent it getting into hard lumps. The 
mould to be used to set the pudding should be put on ice to 
get qu'te cold. It is then filled with the cream to the level, 
and three or four pieces of white paper wetted with cold water 
are placed on it before you put on the cover, which should fit 
very tight. The mould is then buried in the same mixture of 
ice and salt used for freezing the cream in the tirst instance, and

773. liTDIAN OOEiT PLOUR PT7DDI1T0. -Ingredients— 2 oz. 

of ludian corn flour, J pt. of milk, | pt. of boiling milk, 
sweetening and flavoring to taste, 1 egg. 

This must not be confounded with corn flour sold in packets, 
which in some cases is the starch of Indian corn or maize, de- 
prived of much of its nutritive value by the process it under- 
goes to render it white and smooth. Indian corn flour is the 
finely-ground flour of maize, and is largely used in America. 
Dr. Pavy says : " properly prepared, it furnishes a wholesome, 
digestible, and nutritious food.'* Like oatmeal, it requires to 
be thoroughly well boiled. Vanilla is the most suitable flavor- 
ing for this pudding, but any other may be used. Mix the corn 
flour smooth in the cold milk and then stir in the boiling milk. 
Sweeten and flavor. Put into a clean stew pan and stir over 
the fire until it becomes thick ; beat in the egg, put the pud- 
ding in a buttered tart dish and bake very slowly for three- 
quarters of an hour. 

774. STJITBAY rT7DDZlT&> — Ingredients— J lb. of bread crumbs, 

^ pt. of milk, sugar and flavoring to taste, 2 eggs, strawberry

pudding into a buttered tart dish, bake slowly for three quarters 
of an hour. Then spread over the top a layer of strawberry 
jam, and on this the whites of the eggs beaten with a teaspoon- 
ful of sifted sugar to a strong froth. Dip a knife in boiling 
water, and with it smooth over the whites, put the pudding 
again into a moderate oven until the top is a light golden 
brown. Serve immediately. 

775. YORKSHIRE PTJDDIITG (l).— Ingredients— 1 egg, a pinch 

of salt, milk, 4 tablespoonfuls of flour. 

Take the egg and salt and beat with a fork for a few min- 
utes. Add to this three tablespoonfuls of milk and the flour ; 
beat (with a spoon) very well, whilst in a batter, for ten min- 
utes. Then add milk till it attains almost the consi.stency of 
cream. Take care to have the dripping hot in the pudding tin. 
Pour the batter into the tin to the thickness of about a quarter 
of an inch, then bake under the roasting joint. The above 
will make a pudding of moderate size, perhaps one dozen 
squares. The great secret of a pudding being light is to mix 
it two hours before cooking it. 

776. YORKSHIRE PUDDING (2).-Ingredienta— 6 tablespoon- 

fuls (heaped) of flour, 1 J pints of milk, 3 eggs. 
Put the flour in a basin with a little salt, b^ir in enough milk

to make it a stiff batter. When quite smooth put in the eggs, 
well beaten, and the rest of the milk. Beat again, put in shal- 
low tin rubbed with beef dripping. Bake for an hour, then put 
under the meat half an hour to catch a little dripping. Cut in 
small squares to serve. The secret of lightness is to have 
smooth batter highly beaten, hot oven, and serving very quick- 
ly — in fact, that intelligent care in small details which gives 
perfect cooking. 

777. STEAK PITDDIITG-.— Ingredients— ^ lb. of suet, 18 oz. of

sprinkling well with pepper and salt. Grease a pudding mould 
and line it with the paste. Place the meat in and pour in about

fire to boil, and when boiling pour upon the mashed potatoes 
and mix to a paste ; place the meat in a pie dish with a little 
fat in layers, mince the onion and sprinkle each layer with it,

piece of butter, a bunch of parsley, a beef steak, 2 hard 
boiled eggs, 1 cup of water, a few pieces of ham, crust. 

Rub the pigeons with pepper and salt, inside and out ; in 
the former put a piece of butter, and if approved, some par- 
sley chopped with the livers, and a little of the seasoning ; lay 
the steak at the bottom of the dish, and the birds on it ; be- 
tween every two a hard egg. Put the water in the dish ; and 
if you have any ham in the house, lay a piece on each pigeon, 
it is a great improvement to the flavor. Observe when the 
ham is cut for gravy or pies, to take the under part rather than 
the prime. Season the gizzards, and the two joints of the 
wings, and put them in the centre of the pie ; and over them 
in a hole made in the crust, three feet nicely cleaned to show 
what pie it is.

the crust to let the air out. Now make the filHng as follows : 
For one pie take a nice lemon and grate off the outside, taking 
care to get only the yellow ; the white is bitter. Squeeze out 
all the juice ; add white sugar, water, and butter. Put in a

sugar upon it and return to the oven to dry. 

823. LIGHT PASTE FOR TARTS.— Ingredients-l egg, fib. of 

flour, ^ lb. butter. 

Beat the white of an egg to a strong froth, then mix it with 
as much water as will make the flour into a very stiff paste ; 
roll it very thin, then lay the third part of half a pound of butter 
upon it in little pieces ; dredge with some flour left out at first 
and roll up tight. Roll it out again, and put the same proportion

together until a smooth white cream is obtained, then add one 
egg, and keep on beating the mixture till it is smooth again, 
then add three more eggs in the same manner. The speck of 
the eggs should be removed. Lastly, incorporate quickly with 
the mixture the flour, and as soon as it is smooth pour it out 
to the thickness of half an inch on a buttered flat tin, and put 
it into the oven at once. When done (in about ten to fifteen 
minutes) turn out the slab of Genoise, and put it to cool, under 
side uppermost, on a sieve. There is a great knack in beating 
this paste to prevent its curdling. Should this happen, it can 
generally be remedied by beating as quickly as possible until 
the mixture is smooth again.

flower water to prevent oiling. Beat in a bowl the butter and 
sugar, add the almonds and the yolks and whites of the eggs, 
one at a time, then very gradually add the flour. Continue 
beating until the mixture is perfectly smooth, then flavor it 
with some essence oi vanilla, and bake as above. Spread the 
Genoise with apricot jam as above, and, instead of chocolate, 
use icing made as follows : — Put the whites of the eggs into a 
basin with a little of the lemon juice and some of the sugar. 
Work the mixture well with a wooden spoon, and, as it gets 
thin, add more sugar, until a smooth paste of the consistency 
of butter is obtained. Lay this icing on the slab of Genoise 
with a palette knife, put it in the oven for a minute to set the 
icing, and take it out at once in a cool place, then cut up the 
slab as above.

whisked to a froth, and spread out the batter on a baking sheet. 

Sift plenty of powdered sugar over, bake ten minutes in a slow 

oven, and cut it out in strips ; serve hot or cold. 

829. ALMOND PASTRY (2).— Ingredients— 3 oz.of almonds, |lb. 

butter, 2 oz. of loaf sugar, a little rose water.

which you serve it, the next smaller, and so on till it forms a 
pyramid ; then lay each piece separately on paper in a baking 
plate, egg the tops of the pieces, and bake them of a light 
color. When done, take them off the paper, lay them on a 
large dish till cold, set the largest piece in the dish, put on it 
either of the above preserves, lay the next size on that, and 
more sweetmeats, and proceed in the same way with the other 
pieces till they are all placed on eacli other. Put dried green 
gages, barberries, or cherries round, and serve. Instead of 
stamping the pieces, they may be cut with a sharp knife ; small 
pieces may be cut out round the edges to appear like spires, 
which will cause the paste to appear still lighter. 

831. PASTE FOR MIITOE PIES.-Ingredients-2 lbs. of the 

finest pastry flour, 2 lbs. of fresh butter, the yolks of 4 fresh 
eggs, 2 pinches of salt, the juice of half a lemon, tepid water.

Place the ficur on the pastry slab in a heap, make a hole in 
the middle of it, put in it the yolks of the eggs, freed from the 
speck, salt, the juice of half a lemon, and the fourth part of the 
butter cut up in very small pieces; work the paste as quickly as 
possible with the fingers of one hand, adding as much moder- 
ately tepid water as will make the paste smooth, and of the same 
consistence as the remaining one and a half pounds of butter. 
Beat the latter out into a flat square piece an inch in thickness; 
roll out the paste to four times the size of the piece of butter, 
lay this in the centre of the paste, which you fold over on each 
side, and roll out again to three times its original size, then 
fold over two sides only of the piece of paste, and roll it out 
again as before. Repeat this operation twice, cover the paste 
with a woollen cloth, and let it rest for half an hour. The 
operation of rolling out and folding up the paste is called 
" giving a turn." After the paste has rested, two more turns 
are to be given to it, and it will be ready.

flour, roll a little suet with a little flour ; put it aside as you do 
it, and continue the process until all the suet and flour are 
rolled together into flakes ; gather them into a heap on the 
board, sprinkle them with water, using as little as possible, to 
make the mass into paste ; when it is worked into a smooth

half an hour, and take off the froth ; lay it on a sieve to drain 
then fill the glasses ; they will keep more than a week, but 
should always be made the day before they are used. The best 
way to whip a syllabub is to keep a large chocolate mill on pur- 
pose, and a large deep bowl to mill it in, as it will do quicker, 
and froth stronger. With the thin part left at the bottom, mix 
strong calfs foot jelly, and sweeten it to taste ; give it a boil, 
then pour it into basins, and when cold and turned out it will 
be a fine flummery.

in a cool place till the next day. Half fill your glasses with the 
skimmed part, and heap up the froth as high as you can. The 
bottom will look clear ; it will keep several days.

of a lemon in to infuse. Add sugar to taste, and when on the 
point of boiling, strain, and add to the corn flour ; return to the 
stewpan and boil ten minutes. Wet a mould and pour *he 
blanc-mange into it. Serve with jelly, or milk and sugar.

a package of gelatine, 1 pt of hot milk, G tablespooufuls of 
sugar, 2 eggs, lemou and vanilla flavoring, 2 large table- 
spoonfuls of grated chocolate. 
Soften the gelatine in the milk. Sweeten, and divide the 
milk into three parts. Into the first put the whites of the eggs 
previously beaten to a froth and flavor with lemon. Beat the 
yolks and vanilla flavoring into another part. Then wet the 
chocolate in a little warm water, flavor withv anilla and add to 
the remaining third of milk. As each part stiffens, whip with 
an egg beaten, turn into a wet mould, first yellow, then chocolate, 
then white. 

890. CHOCOLATE BLANC-MAITGE. -Ingredients-} a pack- 

age of gfclatiue dissolved in water, 1 pt. milk, 1 cup of grated 

chocolate, I cup of sugar. 
Dissolve the gelatine. Let the milk come to a boiling point 
then stir in the sugar and chocolate. Stir until both are dis- 
solved, then set the saucepan on the back part of the stove and 
stir the gelatine in slowly, a little at a time, so that it will be 
thoroughly distributed through the milk. Then pour into cups 
or moulds. This is to be eaten cold with sugar and cream. 
Flavor the cream with vanilla. 

891. JATJITEMAITG-E- — Ingredients — 1 pint of boiling water 2 oz. 

of isinglass, J pt. of white wiue, juice of 2 oranges, 1 lemon, 

sugar to taate, yolks of 8 eggs.

893. COMPOTE or ORAITG-ES- -Ingredients— 3 oranges, 4 oz. 

of sugar, a gill of water, a small glass of brandy. 

Pare the rind off the oranges as thinly as possible, and set it 
on one side ; divide the fruit into halves, remove the pithy 
cord which is in the centre, and cut off the rind and pith into 
strips down to the quick, leaving the halves of the oranges 
transparently bare ; dish these up in a high compote glass. 
Throw the rind into the sugar, boiled with the water for five 
minutes. Strain this syrup into a basin, add the brandy, pour 
over the compote, and serve. 

894. ORAITGE FOOL — ingredients— juice of 3 Seville oranges, 

well beaten eggs, J pt. of cream, a little nutmeg and einua 
mon, white sugar to taste. 

Mix the orange juice with the eggs, cream and spices. Sweet- 
en to taste. The orange juice must be carefully strained. Set 
the whole over a slow fire, and stir it until it becomes abou; 
the thickness of melted butter ; it must on no account be al- 
lowed to boil ; then pour into a dish for eating cold. 

895. GOOSEBBHEiY FOOL- — Ingredients — 1 quart of gooseber- 

ries, water, sugar, 1 quart of cream, macaroons or ratafias. 
Pick one quart of quite young gooseberries, and put them 
into a jar with a very little water and plenty of sugar ; put the 
jar in a saucepan of boiling water till the fruit be quite tender, 
then beat it through a cullender, and add gradually one quart 
of cream with sufficient sugar to sweeten ; garnish the dish 
v^ith macaroons or ratafias. 

896. CHARLOTTE RTJSSB (1). — Ingredients — For a small 

mould : Savoy biscuits, ^ pt. of double cream, 3 teaspoonfnla 
white sugar, rather more than ^ oz. gelatine, a few drops of 
vanilla flavoring, 1 slice sponge cake. 

These are best made in a plain round tin. Take some Savoy 
biscuits, using half at a time, and keeping the rounded side 
next the mould ; form a star at the bottom by cutting them to 
the shape you require to fit into each other; touch the edge-i 
of the biscuits lightly with white of egg to hold them together, 
but be very careful not to let the egg touch the mould, or it 
will stick and prevent it from turning out. Having made a 
star for the centre, proceed in the same way to line the sides 
by placing the biscuits standing upright all round it, their edges 
slightly overlapping each other: these must also be fastened 
to each other, and to the centre star by a slight application o, 
wnite of egg, after which the tin must be placed in the oven fo- 
a few minutes to dry the egg. The cream must be whisked to 



SwKET Dishes, mrs. Clarke's cookery book. 245 

a stiff froth with the previously melted gelatine, the sugar, and 
afewdrupsof vanilla flavoring; pour this mixture into the 
mould, covering it with a slice of sponge cake the size of the 
mould, to form a foundation when it is turned out ; the biscuits 
forming the sides must have been cut evenly with the top, and 
must be touched lightly with the white of an egg to make them 
adhere to this foundation slice. Place the mould on ice until 
required, then turn it out on a dish and serve at once. This 
requires great care in the turning out. 

897. CHARLOTTE RTJSSE (2). — Ingredients— Half an ounce of 

isinglass, 1 pint of milk, sugar and vanilla to taste, 1 pint of 

cream, Savoy biscuits, a few ratafias. 
Dissolve the isinglass in the mHk ; whip the cream to a 
strong froth, and when the isinglass and milk have cooled and 
become a little thick, add it to them, pouring the cream with 
force into the bowl, whipping it all the time. Grease a mould 
(which must be scrupulously clean) and place Savoy biscuits 
in each flute ; sprinkle a few ratafias at the top, and when 
nearly cold pour in the mixture. Serve with preserved apricots. 

898. CHARLOTTE ZIXTSSE (3). — Ingredients — One oz. of gelatine, 

1 pint of milk, 1 egg, flavor 1 qt. of cream with vanilla and 

sugar to taste, lady- fingers. 
Soak the gelatine in the milk for half an hour, then dissolve 
the same by placing the vessel containing the gelatine and 
milk in a pot of hot water, that it may not burn while heating. 
Next, beat the yolk of one egg and pour it into the milk and 
gelatine while hot ; strain it into a bowl and while cooling 
beat it thoroughly ; next flavor the cream with one large 
teaspoonful of extract of vanilli. and sugar to suit the taste, 
beat the white of the egg to a stiff froth ; stir the cream and 
egg together and beat to a light froth with an egg-beater ; next 
pour the two mixturestogether and whip them thoroughly ; pour 
into moulds lined with lady-fingers. Do not pour into moulds 
until the mixture is stiff enough to prevent the cakes from ris- 
ing to the surface. 

899. A VER7 ITZCE TRIFLE. — Ingredients — Macaroons and 

ratafias, raisin wine, a very rich custard, raspberry jam, 

whipped cream, some rich cream, whites of 2 eggs (well 

beaten), sugar, lemon peel. 

Lay the macaroons and ratafias over the bottom of a dish, 

and pour in as much of the raisin wine as they will soak up, 

then pour on them the custard cold ; it must stand two or 

three inches thick ; then put a layer of the jam and cover the 

16 



246 MRS. CLARKE'S COOKERY BOOK. SWEET DiS HES- 

whole with a whip (which must have been made the day be - 

fore) in the above proportions. 

900. GOOSBBEHHY or apple trifle— Ingredlenta-Ap- 

ples or gooseberries, ^ pmt of milk, ^ pint of cream, yolk ol 1 

egg, sugar to taste. 
Scald enough of either apples or gooseberries so that when 
pulped through a sieve, will form a thick layer at the bottom 
of your dish. If apples, mix the peel of half a lemon grated 
finely, and to either of the fruits add sugar to taste ; mix the 
milk, cream, and the yolk of egg ; give them a scald over the 
fire, stirring all the time ; do not let it boil ; then add a little 
sugar, and allow to get cold. Lay this mixture over the apples 
with a spoon, and then put on it a whip made the day before. 

901. STEWED APPLES AND RICE.— Ingredients — Some 

good baking apples, syrup, 1 lb. of sugar to 1 pt. of water. 

Some shred lemon peel, jam, some well boiled rice. 
Peel the apples, take out the cores with a scoop so as not to 
injure the shape of the apples, put them in a deep baking dish, 
and pour over them a syrup made by boiling sugar in the above 
proportion, put a little piece of shred lemon inside each apple, 
and let them bake very slowly until soft, but not in the least 
broken. If the syrup is thin, boil it until it is thick encnigh ; 
take out the lemon peel, and put a little jam inside each apple, 
and between each a little heap of well-boiled rice ; pour the 
syrup gently over the apples, and let it cover the rice. This 
dish may be served either hot or cold. 

902. SPICED APPLES- — Ingredients— 4 lbs. of apples (weigh 

them after they are peeled), 2 lbs. of sugar, ^ an oz. of cinna- 
mon in the stick, ^ of an oz. of cloves, and 1 pt. of vinegar. 
Let the vinegar, spices and sugar come to a boil ; then put 
in the whole apples, and cook them until they are so tender 
that a broom-splint will pierce them easily. These will keep 
for a long time in a jar. Put a clean cloth over the top of the 
jar before putting the cover on. 

903. APPLE CHARLOTTE —Ingredients— Some good cooking 

apples, sugar (1 lb. of apple pulp to i lb. of sugar), lemon 

flavoring, fried bread. 
Bake good cooking apples slowly until done ; scrape out all 
the pulp with a teaspoon, put it in a stewpan in the abovepropor- 
tion ; stir it until the sugar is dissolved and the pulp stiff. Take 
care it does not burn. Add a little lemon flavoring, and place 
the apple in the centre of a dish, arranging thickly and taste- 
fully round it neatly-cut pieces of the carefully-fried bread. If 
it is desired to make this dish very nice, each piece of fried 



Sweet Dishes, mrs. Clarke's cookery book, 247 

bread may be dipped in apricot jam. Rhubarb Charlotte may 
be made in the same manner. The rhubarb must be boiled 
and stirred until a good deal of the watery portion has evapor- 
ated, and then sugar, half a pound to one pound of fruit, being 
added, it should be allowed to boil until it is thick. 

904. ORANGE OZXIFS- — Ingredients — Some Seville oranges, 

sugar. 
Cut the oranges in halves, squeeze the juice through a sieve; 
soak the peel in water ; next dry ; boil in the same till tender, 
drain and slice the peels, pour the juice over them ; take an 
equal weight of sugar, put sugar, peels, and juice into a broad 
earthenware dish, and set it over the fire, not close enough to 
crack the dish, stir frequently until the chips candy ; then set 
them in a cool place to dry, which process will take three 
weeks. 

905. ORAITG-E SOUFFLE- — Ingredients — 6 oranges, sliced and 

peeled, sugar, custard, yolks of 3 eggs, a pint of milk, sugar 
to taste, grating of orange peel for flavor, white of the eggs. 
Put into a glass dish a layer of oranges, then one of sugar, 
and so on until all the oranges are used, and let it stand two 
hours ; make a soft boiled custard in the above proportions, 
and pour over the oranges, when cool enough not to break the 
dish. Beat the whites of the eggs to a stiff froth, sweeten to 
taste and pour over the top. Serve cold. 

906. FLOATING ISLAND.— Ingredients— 1 J pt. of thin cream, 

^ of a pt. of raisin wine, a little lemon juice, orange flower 
water, and sugar to taste. 
Mix together, pour into a dish for the middle of the table, 
and put on the cream a froth made as below. 

907. FOR FHOTH- — Ingredients — \ lb. of damson pulp, sugar to 

taste, the whites of 4 eggs. 

Sweden the pulp, well whisk the whites, then mix with the 
pulp and beat until it will stand as high as you choose ; put on 
the cream with a spoon, it will take any form, it should be 
rough, to imitate a rock. 

Note — Any other sort of scalded fruit will do if desired. 

808. DEVONSHIRE JUNKET.— Ingredients— 2 qts. of new 

milk, 1^ wineglasses of l)ran(ly, 4 dessertspoonfuls of sugar, 

6 dessert spoonfuls of prepared rennet, clotted cream, a little 

nutmeg. 

Just allow the milk to become blood warm, mix in the brandy 

and set in a deep dish, now add the sugar and rennet, stir well 

and put aside to set. When required for use, cover with the 

cream and a sprinkle of nutmeg. 



DESSERT. 



OBSERVATIONS ON FRUITS, &c. 

Every intelligent person must admit that the free use of 
ripe fruit is one of the greatest promoters of health. But 
it is also obvious that fruits as an exclusive article of diet do 
not meet all the wants of the system. The chemistry of 
the apple, the pear, the tomato, the grape, and other fruits, 
is well understood, and it can be stated how much nutri- 
ment or assimilable food each is capable of affording ; but 
this does not answer all the questions connected wich the 
subject of the healthfulness of fruit. Besides furnishing 
nutriment, fruit exerts other influences upon the animal 
economy of the highest importance. The acids of fruits 
are not properly nutritive substances, but they produce 
physiological effects of a cooling or corrective nature which 
are highly salutary. Fruits are largely composed of water, 
and this fluid has come to them through extraordinary 
channels. The tiny root fibres have collected it in the dark 
earth, and by vital action it has been forced through the 
most minute tubes, until it is finally deposited in the fruit 
cells. So far as we know, the water undergoes no modi- 
fications ; it is water in the soil, and it is the same in its 
wonderful associations in fruits. It, however, holds saccha- 
rine elements and other principles which modify its physi- 
cal appearance and taste. The great amount of water con- 
tained in fruit is in itself an advantage, as it aids in cleans- 
ing the alimentary canal and other excretory ducts, and 
thus promotes healthy action. 

Fruits are capable of sustaining life for long periods, but 
the lack of the nitrogenous elements detracts from their 
strength-giving power, and any one living exclusively upon 
them would not be able to labor effectively. We have all 
heard of the man who rowed his boat along the entire coast 
of New England, sustained alone by whortleberries ; but if 

248 



Dessert. mrs. Clarke's cookery book. 249 

the voyage had lasted six months, or even three, his nerves 
and his muscles would have entirely failed him; so that to 
argue from all such brief experiments is delusive and unfair. 
If the fruit is largely consumed in connection with a proper 
proportion of animal or nitrogenous foods, a much higher 
standard of health will be attained among all classes. 

Much can be done with a tastily arranged dessert of bright 
bonbons, crackers, dried fruit, apples, pears, oranges and 
nuts. 

Delicate or quaint specimens of old Worcester, Chelsea, 
or Dresden will be found to exercise a most telling effect 
by introducing the proper harmony of colors in connection 
with the shining damask of the table linen, and the spark- 
ling crystal of the glass service, nor can we altogether de- 
preciate the use of colored grasses and artificial flowers. 
Some specimens of the latter which we have seen are so re- 
ally artistic in conception and perfect in execution that, al- 
though abhorring all shams and make-believes, we cannot 
but consider them permissible by way of relieving with 
their gayer tints the somewhat sombre laurel. None of 
these suffer, as do the more delicate fruits of summer and 
autumn, from the baneful fumes of gas, and the heated at- 
mosphere of the rooms. But, with regard to decorations 
suitable to the large festive gatherings and orthodox family 
dinner parties ; in all the varied displays we have seen, 
glass ornaments seem usually to carry off the palm, owing 
to the superior delicacy and refinement of their shapes ; 
china vases and figures, however, have an exceedingly good 
effect. One set of pure white china was very striking, con- 
trasted as it was by a dessert set of exquisitely fine bril- 
liantly colored china. The centre and side vases for the 
flowers were edged with open basket work, and supported 
with graceful figures of boys and maidens; the table was 
lighted with white china candelabras to match, and here 
and there were dotted about pure white baskets in imitation 
wicker work (also of china), decked out wllh gracful ferns 
and dainty sprays of flowers. As for the glass epergnes, 
the tall ones for the centre seem still to hold their own, 
and are likely to do so, being so far more elegant than the 
short stumpy ODes. 



as© MRS. Clarke's cookery book. Dessert, 

Dessert would not be complete without chocolate, in 
different forms, all kinds of delicately flavored cakes, and 
the most costly and recherche wines. A good selection can 
be made from pines, grapes, oranges, apples, figs, melons, 
plums, nectarines, cherries, nuts, etc. See "Sweet Dishes" 
for several other suitable recipes for dessert 



909. ORANGES. 

Oranges may be prepared for table in the following manner: 
— Cut gently through the peel only, from the point of the 
orange at the top to dent made at the stalk at the bottom, 
dividing the outside of the orange into cloves or sections, seven 
or eight in number. Loosen the peel carefully, and take each 
section off, leaving it only attached at the bottom. Scrape the 
white off the orange itself, and turn in each section double to 
the bottom of the orange, so that the whole looks like a dahlia 
or some other flower. 

910. ALlfOlTDS AND HAISIITS. 

Serve on a glass dish, the raisins piled high in the centre. 
Blanch the almonds and strew over them. 

911. FEOSTED CT7EEANTS. 

Froth the white of an egg or eggs, dipping the bunches into 
the mixture. Drain until nearly dry, then roll in white sugar. 
Lay upon white paper to dry. 

912. IMFEOMFTU DESSEET. 

Cover the bottom of a large glass dish with sliced orange ; 
strew over it powdered sugar, then a thick layer of cocoanut. 
Alternate orange and cocoanut till the dish is full, heaping the 
cocoanut on the top. 

913. SESSEET OP APPLES-— Ingredients— One lb. of sugar, 1 

lb. of tiuely flavored ripe sour apples, 1 pint of rich cream, 
2 eggs, \ cup of sugar. 

Make a rich syrup of the sugar ; add the apples nicely pared 
and cored. Stew till soft, then mix smoothly with the syrup 
and pour all into a mould. Stir into the cream (or if there is 
none at hand, new milk must answer) the eggs well beaten, 
also the sugar, and let it just boil up in a farina kettle ; then 
set aside to cool. When cold take the apples from the mould 
and pour this cream custard around it and serve. If spice or 
flavoring is agreeable, nutmeg, vanilla, or rose water can be 
used. 



Dessert. mrs. clarke's cookery book. 251 

914. DISH OP PIGS- — Ingiedients — One cup of sugar, one third 

of a cup of water, J of a teaspoonf ul of cream of tartar. 
Let the sugar and water boil until it is a pale brown color ; 
shake the basin in which it is boiling gently, to prevent it burn- 
ing, but do not stir it at all until just before you take it from 
the fire, then stir in the cream of tartar. Wash and cut open 
some figs ; spread them on a platter, then pour the sugar over 
them. Take care to have each fig covered ; set them in a cool 
place till the sugar has time to harden. 

915. A DISH OP NUTS. 

Arrange them piled high in the centre of a dish; a few leaves 
around the edge of the dish will greatly improve the appear- 
ance. In dishing filberts serve them with the outer skin on. 
If walnuts, wipe with a damp cloth before serving. 

916. A DISH OP STEAWBEEBIES. 

If there are any inferior ones they should be placed in the 
bottom of the dish and the others put in rows to form a pyra- 
mid, taking care to place the stalks downwards. A few fern 
leaves placed at the bottom of the dish before building the 
pyramid will add to the good appearance of the dish. N. B. 
Secure the fruit with long stalks as they will support the pyra- 
mid. 

917. DISH OP PREITOH PLTTMS. 

Arrange on a glass dish with highly colored sweet-meats, 
which make a good effect. 

918. A DISH OP M0T7LDED PEARS.— Ingredients— 5 large 

pears, 7 cloves, water, a little piece of cinnamon, 1 gill of 

raisin wine, a small piece of lemon peel and the juice of ^ a 

lemon, sugar to taste, ^ oz. of gelatine. 

Put nearly one pint of water into a jar, pare and cut the 

pears into quarters, place them in the jar with spices and sugar 

to taste, cover the jar tightly and bake the pears in a gentle 

oven until tender, do not allow them to be overdone or they 

will break, wash out a mould (plain) and lay in the pears, now 

take half a pint of the juice the pears were stewed in, the wine, 

lemon peel, gelatine, and strained juice,boil five minutes, strain 

and pour over the pears; stand in a cool place, and when firm 

serve on a glass dish. 

919. APPLE GIITQ-BIV. — Ingredienta— 2 lbs. white sugar, 2 lbs. 

hard apples, nearly 1 qt. water, 1 oz. of tincture of gingei^ 
Make a rich syrup of the sugar and water, adding^ as soon as 



•5* MII& Clarke's cookery book. Dessert. 

it boils, the ginger. Pare, core, and cut the apples into quarters 
or pieces to suit the fancy plunging into cold water to preserve 
the color, then boil in the syrup until transparent. Great care 
must be taken that they do not break, as this would spoil the 
appearance. Place in jars and cover with the syrup, put into 
glass bottles and seal air-tight. It is then ready at any time 
for dessert. 

920. A DISH OF MIXED FRUITS. 

Select a handsome dish, put a table glass in the centre, cover 
with moss or leaves. Place a nice pine-apple upon the top of 
the glass, and round it apples or pears with leaves between, 
then plums mingled with grapes. Much taste can be displayed 
in the arrangement of the fruit 

921. COMPOTE OF FRT7IT.— Ingredients— Equal quantities of 

red and white currants, raspberries, and very ripe cherries, 

white sugar, a wineglassful of pale brandy, sponge cake. 

Remove the stalks and stones from the cherries, and pick the 

currants carefully, sprinkle plenty of white sugar over the 

fruit, add the brandy. Toss them lightly until the sugar is 

dissolved. Serve within a border of sponge cake. 

922. STEA'WBEIIEIES A2T0 CHEAM- 

Pick the fruit carefully (which should be ripe, but not too 
much so), and put into a dessert dish, sprinkle two tablespoon- 
fuls of white sugar over, then pour over the cream, allov/ing one 
pint to every three pints of fruit. 

923. TO FEOST LEAVES- 

Free from all moisture the leaves, by wiping them with a 
clean cloth. Lay them upon a dish near the fire to get dry, 
(not too close or they will shrivel), oil a little butter, and dip 
them into it, sprinkle a little powdered sugar over them, and 
dry near the fire. This is pretty for garnishing dessert. 



COLORINGS FOR CONFECTIONERY. 



924. Pink Color. — You may make a pink color with either 
archil, lake, Dutch pink, or rose pink. Take as much of either 
of them as will be enough for your purpose, and moisten it 
with spirits of wine ; grind it on a marble slab, till quite fine, 
and add spirits of wine, or gin, till it is of the thickness of 
cream. 

925 Red. — Red coler is made with cochineal. Grind half an 
ounce of cochineal fine enough to go through a wire sieve, put 
into a two-quart copper pan, half an ounce of salts of worm- 
wood and half a pint of cold spring water ; put the cochineal 
into it, and put it over a clear fire ; let them boil together for 
about a minute ; mix in three quarters of an ounce of cream of 
tartar, and let it boil again ; as soon as it boils, take it off, and 
put in of powdered roche-alum rather less than half a teaspoon- 
ful ; stir it well together, and strain into a bottle ; put in a lump 
of sugar, to keep it ; cork it up, and put it by for use. 

926. Cherry Red. — Boil an ounce of cudbear in three half 
pints of water over a slow fire, till reduced to a pint, then add 
an ounce ol cream of tartar, and let them simmer again. When 
cold, strain them, add an ounce and a half of spirits of wine to 
it, and battle for use ; this is rendered red when mixed with 
acid, and green with alkali ; it is not a good color, and Dutch 
grappe madder may be substituted for it ; take two ounces, tie 
it in a cloth and beat it in a mortar with a pint of water, pour 
this off and repeat the same operation until you have used four 
or five pints, when the whole of the color will be extracted ; 
then boil it for ten minutes, and add one ounce of alum dis- 
solved in a pint of water, and one ounce and a half of oil of 
tartar ; let it settle, and wash the sediment with water ; pour 
this ofif and dry it, and mix some of it with a little spirits of 
wine or gin. 

A tincture made by pouring hot water over sliced beet-root, 
will give a good red for ices and jellies. 

927. Biue. — Dissolve a Httle indigo in warm water, or p^t a 
little warm water into a plate, and rub an indigo stone on it till 
you have sufficient for your purpose. This will do for ices, &c. 

aS3 



254 MRS. Clarke's cookery book. Colorings. 

But to use indigo for sugars, you must first grind as much as 
you will require as fine as you can on a sto'ne, or in a mortar, 
and then dissolve it in gin or spirits of wine, till of the tint you 
wisii. 

You also make a good blue by grinding Prussian or Antwerp 
Blue fine on a marble slab, and mixing it with water. 

928. Yellow. — You may get a yellow by dissolving turmeric, 
or saffron, in water or rectified spirits of wine. Tincture of 
saffron is used for coloring ices, &c. The roots of barberries 
prepared with alum and cream of tartar, as for making a green, 
will also make a transparent yellow for sugars, &c. Saffron or 
turmeric, may be used in like manner. 

929. Green. — Boil an ounce of fustic, a quarter of an ounce of 
turmeric, two drams of good clear alum, and two drams of 
cream of tartar, in hall a pint of water, over a slow fire, till 
one third of the water is wasted ; add the tartar first, and last- 
ly the alum ; pound a dram of indigo in a mortar, till quite fine 
and then dissolve it in half an ounce of spirits of wine. When 
the ingredients you have boiled (and which make a bright 
yellow) are cold, strain the solution of indigo, and mix it w.ith 
them. You will have a beautiful transparent green, strain it, 
and put it into a bottle, stop the bottle well, and put it by for 
use. You may make it darker or lighter by using more or less 
indigo. This may be used for coloring boiled or other sugars, 
or any preparation in ornamental confectionery. 

A good green for coloring ices, &c. may be made as follows : 
Carefully trim the leaves of some spinach, and boil them in a 
very little water for about a minute, then strain the watsr clear 
off, and it will be fit for use. 

930. Brown. — Burnt umber, ground on a marble slab with 
water, will make a good brown color, and you need not use 
much to obtain the tint you require. Burnt sugar will also

eggs to a froth and add to the mixture; put all in a saucepan, stir- 
ring till it is a nice thick and smooth custard. When perfect- 
ly cold whisk in the cream and freeze. If the custard is allowed 
to freeze itself, stir in the fruit after the second beating. 

986. CUSTARD- — Ingredients — One and a half quarts rich milk, 

one cup sugar, J box gelatine, four eggs, vanilla to taste. 

Dissolve the gelatine in the milk; add the yolks and sugar; 
let it come to a boil, then remove from the fire. When cool, 
add whites of eggs, etc. Pour into mould. To be eaten with 
cream, if preferred. 

987. SAKED CUSTARD. — Ingredients— Some nice pastry, 4 

eggs, 3 gills of new milk, sugar to taste. 

Line a good sized dish with the pastry ; beat the eggs well, 
add slowly the new milk, sweeten to taste ; pour on to the 
paste ; bake in a moderate oven. Can be eaten hot or cold. 

988. CUSTARD (for Cake)-— Ingredients— One egg, ^ pint of 

milk, one teaspoonful of corn starch, 1 tablespoonful of flour, 
2 tablespoonfuls of sugar. 

Scald the milk, beat the sugar, flour, eggs and corn starch 
together ; add the milk, boil until thick. Flavor, and when 
cold, spread between cake. 

989. APPLE CUSTARD.— Ingredients— One pint of apple sauce, 

1 pint of sweet milk, 3 eggs. 

Flavor and sweeten to taste. Bake with an under crust. 

990. CHOCOLATE CUSTARD.— Ingredients — Oue quart of 

milk, yolks of 6 eggs, 6 tablespoonfuls of sugar, ^ a cup of 
grated vanilla chocolate. 

Boil the ingredients until thick enough, stirring all the time. 
When nearly cold flavor with vanilla. Pour into cups, and 
put the whites of the eggs beaten with some powdered sugar 
on top. 

991. FRENCH CUSTARD.— Ingredients— One tablespoonful of 

Fecule de pommes de terre, or potato flour, 3 tablespoonfuls 
of cold milk, 1 pint of boiling milk, 2 oz. of white sugar, 

2 eggs, a little &,\wiag. 



Ices, &c mrs. clarke's cookery book. 267 

Take the Fecule de pommes de terre, or potato flour, mix it 
smooth with the cold milk, then stir in the boiling milk in 
which the sugar has been dissolved ; boil the custard gently, 
stirring all the time until the custard becomes thick, then add 
the eggs well beaten, and the flavoring, and stir over the fire 
for four or five minutes. Pour the custard into a basin, stirring 
occasionally as it gets cold, to prevent a skin forming at the 
top. Note. — Corn flour may be substituted for the Fecule de 
pommes de terre^ but it is not so delicate or appropriate for 
this purpose. 

992. OARAMBL OTTSTARDS.— Ingredients— A handful of loaf 

sugar, 6 eggs (yolks), 1 pint of milk. 

Put the loaf sugar in a saucepan with a little water, and set 
it on the fire until it becomes a dark brown caramel, then add 
some morewater (boiling). To producea darkliquor takestrong 
coffee. Beat up the yolks of the eggs with a little milk ; 
strain, add the milk, (sugar to taste), and as much caramel 
liquor (cold) as will give the mixture the desired color. Pour 
it in a well Ijuttered mould ; put this in a bain marie with cold 
water ; then place the apparatus on a gentle fire, taking care 
that the water does not boil. Half an hour's steaming will set 
the custard, which then turn out and serve. By using the 
whites of one or two eggs in addition to the six yolks, the 
chances of the custard not breaking are made more certain. 

993. SNOW OTJSTARD-— Ingredients— Half a package of gela- 

tine, 3 eggs, 1 pt. of milk, 2 teacups of sugar, juice from 1 
lemon. 

Soak the gelatine thoroughly in about two-thirds of a glass 
of water ; pour into a pint of boiling water. Stir till the gela- 
tine IS perfectly dissolved. Add two-thirds of the sugar and 
lemon juice. Whip the whites of the eggs to a stiflf froth and 
when the gelatine is cold beat it into the whites, a spoonful at 
a time, for at least an hour. Whip steadily, and when firm 
pour into a mould wetted with cold water and set on the re- 
frigerator. In five hours turn into a custard dish. 



PRESERVES. 

OBSERVATIONS ON PRESERVING. 
Fruit for preserving must be gathered in dry weather, and 
should be carefully selected, discarding all bruised fruit, 
and purchasing only that of the largest and finest quality. 
Use only the best white sugar, or the preserve cannot be 
perfect, and nothing is saved. If common sugar is used, it 
causes a greater amount of scum, and of course this must 
be taken off, consequently evaporation reduces the quan- 
tity. In making syrups the sugar must be pounded and 
dissolved in the syrup before setting on the fire; no 
syrups or jellies should be boiled too high. Fruits must 
not be put into a thick syrup at first. Fruits preserved 
whole or sliced may be boiled in a syrup made of two lbs. of 
sugar to every one lb. of water, the quantity of syrup differing 
in some cases, but the general rule is one and a half the 
substance of fruit. We have found the following very good: 
To clarify six pounds of sugar, put into a preserving pan, 
and pour to it five pints of cold spring water ; in another 
pint beat lightly up the white of one small egg, but do not 
froth it very much ; add it to the sugar, and give it a stir 
to mix it well with the whole. Set the pan over a gentle 
fire when the sugar is nearly dissolved, and let the scum 
rise without being disturbed ; when the syrup has boiled 
five minutes take it from the fire, let it stand a couple of 
minutes, and then skim it very clean ; let it boil again, then 
throw in half a cup of cold water, which will bring the re- 
mainder of the scum to the surface ; skim it until it is per- 
fectly clear, strain it through a thin cloth, and it will be 
ready for use, or for further boiling. 

All unripe fruit must be rendered quite tender by gentle 
scalding, before it is put into syrup, or it will not iinbibe 
the sugar ; and the syrup must be thin when it is first add- 
ed to it, and be thickened afterwards by frequent boiling, 

268 



Preserves, mrs. Clarke's cookery book. 269 

or with additional sugar ; or the fruit will shrivel instead of 
becoming plump and clear. A pound of sugar boiled for 
ten minutes in one pint of water will make a very light 
syrup ; but it will gradually thicken if rapidly boiled in an 
uncovered pan. Two pounds of sugar to the pint of water, 
will become thick with a little more than half an hour's 
boiling, or with three or four separate boilings of eight or 
ten minutes each ; if too much reduced it will candy in- 
stead of remaining liquid. 

In making jams many cooks after allowing the proper 
proportion of sugar to the fruit, put into the preserving pan 
without removing stones or skins until after boiling, as the 
flavor is thought to be finer by adopting this method. Glass 
bottles are preferable to any other as they allow inspection 
to detect incipient fermentation, which may be stayed by 
re-boiling. Copper or brass preserving pans are the best 
kind to use, but they require a great deal of care to keep 
clean ; the enamelled are very nice and easily kept in order. 
Jams should be kept in a dry, cool place, and if properly 
made will only require a small round of writing paper, 
oiled, and laid on to fit ; now tie down securely with a sec- 
ond paper brushed over with the white of egg to exclude 
the air. If you should have the least fear of the store closet 
being damp, it would be better for the first paper to be 
dipped in brandy. Inspect them every two or three months. 



994. FL72A JAM- — ^Ingredients — Allow i lb. oS, white cagar to 1 
lb. of fruit. 
It is difficult to give the exact quantity of sugar to 
be used in plum jam, in fact it entirely depends upon the 
quality of the plums used, therefore your own judgment will 
be necessary. After weighing the plums, halve them and re- 
move the stones ; then place on a large dish and sprinkle with 
the sugar, leave them thus for twenty-four hours ; then put into 
a preserving pan and let them simmer gently on the back of 
the stove for about twenty-five or thirty minutes, then boil 
very quickly, for a quarter of an hour, skimming carefully, and 
stirring with a wooden spoon to prevent the jam sticking. It 
greatly improves the jam to put some kernels from the plum 
stones into it. 



270 MRS. CLARKE'S COOKERY BOOK. PRESERVES. 

995. RED OnRHAlTT JAM.— Ingredients— Three quarters of a 

lb. of white sugar to every pound of fruit. 
Let the fruit be very ripe, remove from the stalks with a sil- 
ver fork ; dissolve the sugar over the fire, then put in the cur- 
rants and boil for half an hour, stirring and skimming all the 
time. Put into jars and cover air tight. 

996. BLACZ OTTRRAITT JAM.— Ingredients— One gill of water, 

1 lb. of fruit to 1 lb. of sugar. 
Purchase the fruit ripe and dry ; having stripped from the 
stalk which can be done nicely with a silver fork, place them 
and the water into your preserving pan ; boil for ten minutes ; 
then add the sugar, and allow to boil three-quarters of an hour 
from the time it begins to simmer ; keep it constantly stirred; 
carefully remove the scum. When done pot in the usual man- 
ner. 

997. HA^PBEErRY JAM. — Ingredients— Allow 1 lb. of white 

sugar to 1 lb. of fruit, and 2 wineglasses of red currant juice. 

Directly this fruit is purchased preserve it, if allowed to 
stand the jam and the flavor will not be so good ; place in pre- 
serving pan and allow, to boil twenty minutes, stirring constant- 
ly ; add the sugar and currant juice and boil for half an hour. 
Be particular to skim well as this will make the jam nice and 
clear. When cone, place in pots and cover in the usual man- 
ner. 

998. GOOSEBEURT JAM.— Ingredients— Some fine full-grown 

unripe gooseberries, their weight in sugar, to 1 pt. of liquor 

allow 1 lb. of sugar. 
Cut, and pick out the seeds of the gooseberries; put them in- 
to a pan of water, green, and put them into a sieve to drain ; 
beat them in a marble mortar, with their weight in sugar. Boil 
a qr.art of them to a mash in a quart of water; squeeze, end add 
to the liquor, sugar in the above proportions ; then boil and 
skim it, put in your green gooseberries, and having boiled them 
till very thick, clear, and of a nice green, put them into bottles. 

999. DAMSON JAM- — Ingredients — Equal quantities of fruit 

and jelly. 

Choose the fruit without blemish ; remove the stones from 
the fruit, and put it and the sugar into your preserving pan ; 
stir slowly until the sugar is melted, and remove all scum. 
After the jam has begun to simmer, allow it to boil for an hour; 
it is necessary to stir diligently or the jam will burn. When 
done, pot in the uBual way.

1000. 1£7LBEIIB7 JAM — Ingredients -Some ripe nmlberries, 

1 lb. sugar and 1 pint of mulberry jnice to erery pound of 

picked fruit. 
Boil and skim Ihe sugar with the juice for five minutes after 
the sugar is thoroughly dissolved ; then add the fruit, and boil 
quickly for half an hour, stirring well ; take off the fire, and, if 
quite stiff when cold, it is done sufiiciently, it not, boil for an- 
other quarter of an hour and proceed to bottle in the usual 
way. 

1001. ItZUSAUB JAM' — Ingredients — Rhubarb, to a pound of 
pulp allow 1 lb. of sugar, 1 oz. of sweet almond sblanched and 
chopped, and half a lemon cut into slices. 

Peel and cut up the rhubarb, boil till reduced to a pulp with 
a very little water, add the sugar, almonds, and lemon ; boil 
for three-quarters of an hour, or an hour ; remove the lemon 
peel, and put it into pots. 

1002. G-HEEIT Q-RAPB JAM.— Ingredients— To 1 lb. of grapes 
allow I lb. of sugar 

Pick them carefully, and reject any that are injured ; wash 
them. Put the grapes into a preserving pan, then a layer of 
sugar, than a layer of grapes. Boil on a moderate fire, stirring 
it all the time to prevent its burning, and as the grape stones 
rise take them out with a spoon, so that by the time the fruit 
is sufficiently boiled — about one hour — the stones will all have 
been taken out. Put into jars and cover in the usual way. 

1003. BLAOKBERRT JAM.— Ingredients— To every lb. of 
picked fruit allow 1 lb. of loaf sugar, and J lb. of apples 
peeled and cored, and cut quite small. 

Boil the fruit for ten minutes, add the sugar, boil, stir, and 
remove all scum ; it will take from half to three-quarters of an 
hour. 

1004. APRICOT OR PLTTM JAM.— Ingredients— Take equal 

quantities of fruit and sugar. 

Pound the sugar, pare and cut up with a silver knife some 
ripe apricots, or magnums, remove the stones, lay the fruit in 
a dish, strew over them half the sugar, and leave them till the 
following day ; then boil and skim the remainder of the sugar, 
add the fruit, boil it up quickly, well skimming and stirring for 
twenty minutes ; add the blanched kernels halved, boil for ten 
minutes more, and the jam will be ready to pot. 



272 MRS. Clarke's cookery book. Preserves. 

1005. STRA'WBBIIIIY JAM.— Ingredients— To 1 lb. of fruit 
allow f lb. or 1 lb. of sugar, to 4 lbs. of etrawberry add 1 
pt. of red currant juice. 

Put the currant juice and strawberries on to boil for thirty 
minutes, and stir carefully all the time. Then put in the sugar 
and boil up very quickly for twenty or twenty-five minutes re- 
moving any scum that arises. Put into your jars, covering air 
tight. If a pound of sugar is used there will be more jelly. 

1006. STRA'WBERRY OR BARBERRY JAM-— Ingredients- 

Some ripe but not too ripe strawberries, to every lb. of fruit 
allow 1 lb. of white sugar and ^ pt. of currant juice. 
Pick the fruit ; pour the currant juice on the sugar. Boil the 
strawberries for twenty minutes, stirring well with a wooden 
spoon. Add the sugar and currant juice, and boil together on 
a trivet or hot plate for half an hour, carefully removing all the 
scum as it rises. 

1007. 05ERR7 JAH. — Ingredients — To 1 lb. of cherries allow 1 
lb. of sugar. 

For this use ripe fruit, but carefully reject any which is 
bruised or over ripe. The Kentish are the best for this purpose, 
having a pleasant acid taste ; other kinds are too sweet for the 
quantity of sugar necessary in preserving frut. To the stoned 
fruit, add the sugar ; it will require stirring occasionally 
from the first, and continuously after it once comes to the boil, 
after which it must continue boiling for three-quarters of an 
hour ; then try a little on a cold plate to see if it sets or jellies ; 
if it does, pour it off into jars, and set in a cool dry place till 
the following day, when it should be covered down for keeping, 
if not, continue boiling until it will so set. It will not require 
skimming during the process of boiling, the scum will all boil 
away. The easiest way of stoning cherries is to tie a little loop 
of iron wire about the shape of a hairpin, on to a stick the 
length of a pencil ; bind the two ekJs firmly to the stick, leav- 
ing the loop standing up about an fnch long, and slightly bent 
forward. With this the stones are easily extracted. 

1008. QUllTOE JAM.— Ingredients- To 1 lb. of quinces allow | 
Id. of sugar. 

Peel and quarter your quinces, leaving the seeds in, as they 
readily impart their mucilage to water and thus thicken the 
syrup. Put the fruit and sugar into a preserving pan, and half 
a teacupful of water to moisten the bottom of the pan ; stir the 
fruit and sugar frequently, and when it boils keep it boiling 
rapidly until the ftuit is soft, and a clear red color. It will

take about an hour, reckoning from the first boiling up. Put 
into jam pots, and cover when cold. 

1009. APPLE JA.I/L- — Ingredients — Allow to every 1 lb. of pared 
and cored fruit | lb. of white sugar, the rind of one lemon, 
and juice of half a lemon. 

Having peeled and cored the apples weigh them, and slice 
them very thin. Place in a stone jar and surround with boiling 
water, allow them to boil until tender ; when tender place in 
a preserving pan, add the sugar, grated lemon rind and juice. 
Boil slowly half an hour from the time it begins to simmer, re- 
move the scum, put into jars and cover in the usual manner. 

1010. GEEEN PIG PRESEUVE- — Ingredients — Equal quan- 
of fruit and sugar, peel of 1 large lemon, a little ginger. 

Lay the figs in cold water for twenty four hours, them simmer 
them till tender; put them again into cold water, and let them 
remain for two days, changing the water each day. If not quite 
soft simmer again, and replace in cold water until next day. 
Take their weight in loaf sugar, and with two-thirds of it make 
a syrup, in which simmer the figs for ten minutes. In two days 
take the third of the sugar, pounded fine, and pour the syrup 
from ihe figs on it. Make a rich syrup with the peel of the 
lemon and a little raw ginger, and boil the figs in it, then mix 
altogether and put into large jam pots. The figs may be cut 
in half, if preferred, after they have simmered until soft. 

1011. PRESEE.'TED IvIELOlTS — ingredients — Melon, salt and 
water, best white ginger to taste. To make syrup, 1 qt. of 
water to 1 lb. of white sugar, the rind of 3 lemons, an- 
other 1 lb. of sugar to each quart of syrup. 

Take away the rind and seeds, and cut the melon about the 
size of pieces of ginger. Put them in strong salt and water, 
and let them remain for ten days, when it must be poured off, 
and fresh water put instead ; this must be changed twice daily 
for three or four days till all taste of salt is gone from the 
melon. Scrape the outside off the best white ginger (the 
quantity according to taste), put it into a thin syrup made of 
the above proportions of water and sugar, drain the fruit, and 
pour the syrup and ginger over it boiling hot. Repeat this for 
three days, then add another pound of sugar to each quart of 
syrup ; when boiled and skimmed add the rind of three lemons, 
cut lengthwise to each quart, put in the melons, and simmer 
until clear. After the first day's simmering the ginger may be 
sliced to impart more flavor, but it must not be allowed to boil. 



a 74 MRS. cxarke's cookery book. Preserves. 

The syrup, when done.must be rich and thick. It is better when 
kept a year. 

1012. TO PRESERVE OITRON-— Ingredients— Citrons, sugar, 

and water. 
Purchase fine citrons, pare and slice one inch thick, cut 
again into strips, remove the seeds, weigh, and allow one. lb. of 
sugar to one lb. of fruit. Make a syrup, say five lbs. of sugar, 
half pint of water ; when boiling add the fruit and boil three- 
quarters of an hour, test if done by piercing with a broom 
straw, and a few minutes before removing from the fire slice 
and seed a lemon, and with one root of ginger put into preserv- 
ing pan, pot and cover air tight. 

1013. PRESERVED PX7MPKI1TS.- Ingredients — Equal pro- 
portiona of sugar and pumpkin, 1 gill of lemon juice. 

Cut the pumpkin in two, peel and remove the seed, cut in 
pieces about the size of a fifty-cent piece, after weighing 
place in a deep vessel in layers, first sprinkling a layer of sugar 
then of pumpkin and so on, until it is finished ; nowadd the lemon 
juice and set aside for three days ; now for every three pounds 
of sugar add half pint of water and boil until tender. Pour into 
a pan, setting aside for six days, pour off the syrup and boil 
until thick, skim and add the pumpkin while boiling ; bottle in 
the usual manner. 

1014. QTJllTOES PRESERVED '^HOLE.— Ingredients— Some 
ripe quinces, to every pint of water allow 3 lbs. of white 
sugar. 

Pare the quinces and put them into t?he preserving pan, three- 
parts covered with cold water (if they should float while the 
water is being poured on them, press them down with a plate 
until you have gauged the exact height of the water) ; take out 
the quinces, measure the water and add the sugar. Let this boil 
rapidly in the preserving-pan for five minutes, and then put in 
the quinces. The syrup should not cover them at first, but 
when they are half-cooked it will then amply cover the fruit. 
Boil the quinces rapidly, until soft enough for a knitting-needle 
to pierce them easily, which should be in an hour and a half, 
reckoning from the first boiling up. Take the quinces out care- 
fully, so as not to break them, and lay them on dishes to cool. 
Run the syrup through ajelly bag,or a piece of new flannel, put in 
a gravy strainer : this frees it of all odd little bits that may boil 
from the outside of the quinces, and makes it clearer. Put the 
the syrup back in the preserving-pan, and boil it rapidly 
until it will jelly when dropped on a plate ; put the quinces in- 



Preserves. mrs. clarke's cookery book. 275 

lo the boiling syrup, and let them simmer gently for ten 
minutes. Place each quince carefully in wide-necked jars, 
pour the hot syrup over them, and when cold cover in the 
usual way. 

1015. PRESERVED ORANGES- — Ingredients— any number of 
oranges, with rather more then their weight in sugar, allow 
rather more than half a pint of water to each pound of sugar. 

Slightly grate and score the oranges round and round with a 
knife, but not very deeply. Put them into cold water for three 
days, changing the water twice each day. Tie them up in a 
cloth and boil them until they are quite soft, that is, soft 
enough to be penetrated by the head of a pin. While they are 
boiling place the sugar on the fire with the water ; let it boil 
for a few minutes, then strain it through muslin. Put the 
oranges into the syrup and boil till it jellies and is of a yellow 
color. Try the syrup by putting some to cool ; it should not 
be too stiff. The syrup need not cover the oranges completely, 
but they must be turned so that each part gets thoroughly done. 
Place the oranges in pots, cover with syrup, and tie down with 
brandied papers. This is an excellent way of preserving oranges 
or shaddocks whole. Only they should be looked at now and 
then, and boiled up again in fresh syrup, if what they are in has 
become too hard, which, however, if they have been properly 
done, will not be the case. They form a nice dish for dessert 
or for serving, filled with whipped cream, or custard, either 
cold or gently warmed through in the syrup in a stewpan. 
Oranges can also be canned in the American fashion in wide- 
mouthed bottles. 

1016. QT7I1T0E IIARl/IALADE- — Ingredients — Quinces, to 

every lb. of pulp allow 2 lbs. of sugar. 

Rub off all the down from the quinces, and cut oflfthe tops 
and stalks. Put the quinces in a preserving pan with plenty of 
water and boil till they are soft ; then remove them from the 
fire, and pass the pulp through a hair sieve, and beat it till it 
is soft and white ; put the sugar on the fire with water, and 
let it^boil till it is thick, and will fall from the spoon in flakes, 
commonly called feather point. Take the pan otT the fire, 
and mix in'the pulp; it is best i.o put a little of the sugar 
to the pulp, and keep on adding by degrees till it is tolerably 
thin, when it will mix more readily with the larger quantity ot 
sugar ; when all is well mixed, return the pan to the fire, and 
let the mixture get thoroughly warm, but do not allow it to 
boil, and stir all the time, or it will get burnt. Put the jam 
into jars, and allow them to stand in the sun, for two or three

days, when there ought to be a thick crust on the top. This 
marmalade is very good for colds, aud a spoonful mixed in half 
a glass of wine is considered strengenthing. 

1017. ORAITG-B MARMALADE.— Ingredients— Twelve fair 
sized Seville oranges, some spring water, juice of 3 or 4 
oranges, to every pound of peel and juice allow 1^ lbs, of 
white sugar, allow to this amount of sugar, 1 J pts. of water. 

Take the oranges with smooth, highly colored skins, score 
the peel off in quarters, taking with it as much of the white 
skin as you can without breaking the pulp ; as you remove the 
peel, put it into a basin of spring water ; put it all, when ready, 
into a siewpan, with enough spring water to cover the peel ; 
change the water several times during the boiling process, and 
when the peel is quite soft and very tender, take it out of the 
pan and drain it on a hair sieve. Spread out the peel, when 
nearly dry, on a pasteboard, and cut it into fine shreds; squeeze 
the oranges, and add the juice of the lemons; then add the 
sugar ; allow to this amount of sugar the above proportion of 
water obtained by washing and straining the pulp of the oranges. 
Boil and skim carefully fifteen or twenty minutes, then add the 
washed pulp and juice, and boil until it commences to thicken, 
then put in the pulp and boil for twenty or thirty minutes, or 
until it jellies properly. 

1018. AFFLE I^IAIIMALADE. — Ingredients— Some good cook- 
ing apples, I lb. of of fruit, ^ teacupful of water to 6 lbs. 
of sugar, a few cloves, cinnamon or lemon peel for flavor. 

Peel, core, and thinly slice the apples (apples that cook to a 
smooth pulp easily) ; put the sugar in a preserving pan (a tin 
or iron saucepan will turn them black), with the water; let it 
gradually melt, and boil it for ten minutes ; then put in the 
sliced apple, and a few cloves, cinnamon, or lemon peel to 
flavor, if liked. Boil rapidly for an houi, skim well, and put in 
jam pots ; it should be quite a smooth pulp, clear, and a bright 
amber color. Will keep good for twelve months. 

1019. VEGETABLE MARROW (with ginger).— Ingredients— 

A nice firm marrow, to 1 lb. of marrow 1 lb. of sugar, i lb. 
of bruised ginger, a little lemon peel if liked. , 

Peel a nice firm vegetable marrow, and cut it into small 
thick slices, then boil these till they get quite tender ; put the 
slices on a strainer or sieve for twenty-four hours, till all the 
water has run out; weigh it and take an equal quantity of sugar. 
Boil the syrup and ginger in about a pint of cold water ; when 
clear and skimmed, put the marrow in for two or three minutes, 



Preserves, mrs. clarke's cookery book. 277 

and then pour it out into a basin. Do this two or three times 
every two days, boiling only the syrup, keeping the marrow sep- 
arate, and pouring the boiling syrup on the marrow. This is 
sometimes called " mock ginger," and is certainly an excellent 
substitute. It will keep well, but requires looking at occasion- 
ally. 

1020. S'WTBT TOMATO PIOKLB.— Ingredients— 3i lbs. of 
tomatoes, If lbs. of sugar, ^ oz. each of cinnamon mace, and 
cloves mixed, 1 pt. of vinegar. 

Peel and slice the tomatoes, sticking into them the cloves ; 
put altogether into a stewpan and stew an hour. When done 
pack in glass jars, and pour the syrup over boiling hot. 

1021. S"WEBT PEACH PIOKLE.— Ingredients— To 4 lbs. of 
peaches allow 2 lbs. of white sugar, A oz. each of mace, cin- 
namon and cloves mixed, and 1 pt. of the best white vinegar. 

Pour scalding water over the peaches and remove the skins 
with a butter knife ; drop into cold water ; stick four cloves in 
each peach. Lay the peaches in preserving pan with the 
sugar sprinkled over them; bring graduiUy to the boil, add 
vinegar and spice, boil five or six minutes. Remove the 
peaqhes and place in bottles. Boil the syrup thick and pour 
over boilittji hot. 

1022. FZAOEES in BBAITDT.'-Iagredients— llb.of 8ugarto 
1 lb. of fruit, brandy. 

Wipe, weigh, and pick the fruit, and have ready the fine sugar 
in fine powder. Put the fruit into an ice pot that sliuts very 
close ; throw the sugar over it, and then cover the fruit vi'ith 
brandy. Between the top and cover of the pot put a piece of 
double cap-paper. Set the pot into a saucepan of water till the 
brandy be as hot as you can possibly bear to put your finger in, 
but it must not boil. Put the fruit into a jar, and pour the 
brandy on it. When cold, put a bladder over, and tie it down

sugar to 1 lb. of fruit, brandy. 

Peel some small ripe quinces, and allow the above propor- 
tion of sugar and fruit ; boil the quinces half an hour in 
barely sufficient water to cover them ; drain them, and ] ut 
aside to get cool ; empty the water out of the preserving-pan 
and put in the sugar, moistening it with a little of the water in 
which the quinces were boiled, and let the sugar boil for ten 
minutes ; put in the quinces and let them boil rapidly for half

an hour. Place them in wide-mouthed jars, as free from syrup 
as possible, boil down the syrup until it jellies when dropped 
on a plate, set it aside in a large jug or bowl, and when quite 
cold mix an equal quantity of good brandy with the syrup, and 
pour over the quinces in the jars. Cover closely with paper 
dipped in white of egg,

CANNED FRUITS, &c. 



CANNING FRUIT. 

1027. PEACHES (to Can). 

First prepare the syrup. For canned fruits, one quart of 
granulated sugar to two quarts of water is the proper propor- 
tion ; to be increased or lessened according to the quantity of 
fruit to be canned, but always twice as much water as sugar. 
Use a porcelain kettle, and, if possible, take care that it is kept 
solely for canning and preserving — nothing else. Have another 
porcelain kettle by the side of the first, for boiling water (about 
three quarts). Put the peaches, a few at a time, into a wire 
basket, such as is used to cook asparagus, etc. See that it is 
perfectly clean and free from rust. Dip them, when in the bas- 
ket, into a pail of boiling water for a moment and transfer 
immediately into a pail of cold water. The skin will then at 
once peel off easily, if not allowed to harden by waiting. This* 
besides being a neat and expeditious way of peeling peaches, 
also saves the best part of the fruit, which is so badly wasted 
in the usual mode of paring fruit. As soon as peeled, halve 
and drop the peaches into boiling ^yater, and let them simmer 
— not boil hard — till a silver fork can be passed through them 
easily. Then lift each half out separately with a wire spoon 
and fill the can made ready for use ; pour in all the boiling 
syrup which the jar will hold ; leave it a moment for the fruit 
to shrink while filling the next jar ; then add as much more 
boiling syrup as the jar will hold, and cover and screw down 
tightly immediately. Continue in this way, preparing and seal- 
ing only one jar at a time, until all is done. If any syrup is 
left over, add to it the water in which the peaches were sirn- 
mered, and a little more sugar ; boil it down till it "ropes" 
from the spoon and you have a nice jelly, or, by adding some 
peaches or other fruit, a good dish of marmalade. Peaches or 
other fruit, good, but not quite nice enough for canning, can be 
used up in this way very economically. Peaches to be peeled 
as directed above should not be too green or too ripe, else, in 
the first place, /.le skin cannot be peeled oflf; or, if too ripe, 
the fruit will fall to piecea.

28o MRS. CLARKE'S COOKERY BOOK. CANNED 

1028 (Another way)- 

After peeling and halving as above directed, lay a clean 
towel or cloth in the bottom of a steamer over a kettle of boil- 
ing water and put the fruit on it, half filling the steamer. 
Cover tightly and let it steam while making the syrup. When 
that is ready, and the fruit steamed till a silver fork will pass 
through easily, dip each piece gently into the boiling syrup ; 
then as gently place in the hot jar, and so continue till all 
have been thus scalded and put in the jar. Then 'nWJiill with 
syrup, cover and seal immediately. While filling, be sure and 
keep the jars hot. 

1029. (Another way). 

Peel, halve, remove the stones, and prepare the syrup as 
directed ; and when it is boiling drop in enough fruit for one 
jar ; watch closely, and the instant they are sufficiently tender, 
take out each half with care and put into a hot jar till full. 
Then dip in all the boiling syrup it will hold. Cover tightly, 
set aside, and prepare for the next jar. Be sure and skim the 
syrup each time before adding more fruit. After jars are filled 
and the covers screwed on, before setting them away, every 
little while give the screw another twist until it cannot be 
moved farther. 

1030. PEARS. 

The skin will not peel oflFso easily as the peach by dipping 
them in boiling water, but it will loosen or soften enough to be 
taken off with less waste of the fruit than if pared without 
scalding. Prepare the syrup and proceed as for peaches. 
They will require longer cooking ; but as soon as a silver or 
well-plated fork will pass through easily, they are done. 
Longer cooking destroys the flavor. 

1031. FIITE APPLES. 

Pare very carefully with a silver or plated knife, as steel in- 
jures all fruit. With the sharp point of the knife dig out as 
neatly and with as little waste as possible, all fhe " eyes " and 
black specks, then cut out each of the sections in which the 
" eyes " were, in solid pieces clear down to the core. By doing 
this all the real fruit is saved, leaving the core a hard, round 
wood> substance, but it contains considerable juice. Take 
this core and wring it with the hauls as one wrings a cloth, till 
all thejuice is extracted, then throw it away. Put the juice 
thus saved into the syrup ; let it boil up five minutes, skim till 
clear, then add the fruit. Boil as short a time as possible, and 
have the flesh tender. The pineapple loses flavor by over- 



Fruits mrs. Clarke's cookery book. 281 

cooking more readily than any other fruit. Fill into well- 
heated jars, add all the syrup the jar will hold ; cover and 
screw down as soon as possible. 

1032. PLUMS. 

Plums should be wiped with a soft cloth or dusted, never 
washed. Have the syrup all ready, prick each plum with a 
silver fork to prevent the skin from bursting, and put them 
into the syrup. Boil from eight to ten minutes, judging by the 
size of the fruit. Dip carefully into the hot jars, fill full, and 
screw on the cover immediately. Cherries may be put up in 
the same way. — Beecher. 



1033. PEAHS (Oamied). — ingredients — Bartlett pears, 1 quart of 

fruit, 1 pint of water, \ lb. of white sugar. 

Make the syrup and set on the stove to boil, peel the pears 
and plunge into cold water as soon as pared ; when the syrup 
boils put the pears in, and boil until you can pierce them easi- 
ly with a piece of broom straw ; dip the cans in hot water, put 
in the fruit, pour boiling syrup over and seal. 

1034. PLUMS (Canned)- — Ingredients— Symp, 2 wineglasses of 
water and \ lb. of sugar to each 3 quarts of fruit. 

When the sugar is melted and the water luke-warm put the 
plums in. Let it come slowly to the boil. Let them hoW gently 
for five minutes. Put the plums into bottles,^?// them with the 
boiling syrup (take care that there is as much syrup in the 
bottles as they will hold). Screw up immediately and set in a 
dark dry place. 

1035. STRAWBERRIES (Oanaod)- — ingredients — Allow to each 

1 lb. of fruit f lb. of sugar. 
Put berries and sugar into a large flat dish and allow to 
stand about four hours, then draw off the juice and put into 
preserving pan and allow to come to a boil, removing the scum 
as it rises ; then put in the berries, and let them come to abolL 
Put into warm bottles and seal quickly. 

1036. CHERRIES (Canned)- — Ingredients — To every 1 lb. of 
fruir \ lb. of sugar, 3 gills of water. 

Put the sugar and water on the fire to heat, and as soon as it 
comes to a boil put in the chenies and only allow them to scald 
for a quarter of an hour ; put into bottles boiling hot and seal. 
A few of the kernels put in to scald with the fruit imparts a 
fine flavor. Note — Be sure to skim well. 



282 MRS. Clarke's cookery book. Canned 

1037. PEACHES {Oamied). — Ingredients— To every 1 lb, of fruit 
allow 5 oz. of sugar, 1 gill of water. 

Pour hot water over the peaches and the skin will come off ; 
drop into cold water to prevent them changing color. As soon 
as the syrup has come to a boil, put in the peaches and allow 
them them to boil till tender. Try them with a broom straw 
and if tender place in hot bottles, pour over the boiling syrup 
to nearly running over and seal immediately. NOTE — Care 
must be taken that they are not over boiled or they will break. 

1038. TO BOTTLE PHTJIT.— Ingredients— Any fresh fruit, large- 
mouthed bottles, new corks. 

Secure the fruit not very ripe and picked on a fine day; have 
the bottles clean and dry, put in the fruit, cover with pieces of 
bladder tied securely, stand them in a boiler with cold water 
to the necks, put the boiler on the fire, and allow to boil ; as 
soon as the bladders begin to swell, pierce them with a large 
pin. Now let the fire out and allow the bottles to stand until 
cold. The following day remove the bladders and fill up the 
bottles with sugar. Be careful to have the corks close at hand, 
and just before corking hold a couple of lighted matches in the 
mouth of the bottle, and, beforethegashashad time to escape, 
cork and cover with resin. 

1039. &EEEIT aOOSEBEF«IlZES (To Bottle). 

Top and tail the gooseberries, and then fill wide-mouthed 
bottles, shaking them down till no more can be put in ; then 
tie down with damp (not wet) bladder, and place the bottles, 
surrounded by hay, in a boiler of cold water, over a slow fire ; 
let them simmer till reduced about one-third, then take the 
boiler off the fire, and let the bottles remain in it till quite cold. 

1040. STONE FETTITS (To Bottle).— 

For this purpose wide-necked glass bottles must be used. 
Fill them with the fruit, as closely packed as possible, and into 
the mouth of each putquaiter pound of finely powdered white 
sugar. Tie a piece of wet bladder, tightly stretched, over each 
mouth, to exclude the air ; place them in a large fish kettle, 
packing them with hay, which should surround each bottle, and 
line the sides of the kettle, to prevent their either touching it or 
each other ; this will prevent their breaking ; fill the kettle 
with water, which must not come quite up ta the bladder 
coverings ; place it on the fire, or if a very hot one, to the side 
will be better, letting it simmer until you see that the fruit is 
cooked, by which time it will have considerably sunk in the 
bottles ; the kettle must then be removed from the the fire, but 



Fruits. mrs. clarke's cookery book. 283 

the bottles must not be taken from it until the water is perfect- 
ly cold. During the time the kettle is on the fire, the bladders 
will require frequent moistening with a little water to prevent 
them from bursting; should this happen, at once tie on a fresh 
piece of wet bladder. The bottles must be wiped dry after re. 
moving from the water, and should be kept in a dry, cool 
place. The bladders must never be taken off till the fruit is 
required for use, as it will not keep after the bottle has been 
once opened. 

1041 FEAES FOE DESSEET. , 

Take the finest pears just ripe, just cover with water, simmer 
till tender, but not in the least broken ; lift them out into cold 
water. Now measure the water you have simmered them in ; 
to each half pint put one pound of sugar. Boil up the syrup, then 
simmer the pears for five minutes ; repeat this for three days, 
but allow ten minutes simmering the last day. Keep the pears 
in the syrup ; the day before any are wanted remove from it 
and dry in a very cool oven. Or you may stew pears in a 
syrup of five oz. sugar, six cloves, six allspice, half pint water, 
and half pint port wine. This is the proportion for eight large 
pears. Pure claret may be used instead of wine and water. 
Simmer slowly till tender, probably three hours. A few drops 
of cochineal improve the color if water has been used. Pears 
and plumbs in equal quantities, with a few of the kernels of 
the latter chopped, preserve beautifully in the above syrup. 

1042. SYETTP (1). 

Take of sugar ten pounds ; water three pints. Dissolve the 
sugar in the wkter with a gentle heat. 

1043. STEUP (2). 

Take of pure sugar ten pounds ; boiling water three pints. 
Dissolve the sugar in the water with the aid of a gentle heat. 

1044. SYEXJP (3). 

In making syrups, for which neither the weight of the sugar 
nor the mode of dissolving it is specified, the following rule is 
to be observed : — Take of refined sugar, reduced to a fine 
powder, twenty-nine ounces ; the liquor prescribed one pint. 
Add the sugar by degrees, and digest with a moderate heat, in 
a close vessel, until it is dissolved, frequently stirring it ; set 
the solution aside for twenty-four hours, take ofi" the scum, and 
pour off the syrup from the feces, if there be any. 

1045. SYETJP (4). 

Take of sugar two and a half pounds ; water a pint. Dis- 
solve the sugar in the water with the aid of heat, remove any 
scum which may form, and strain the solution while hot. 



JELLIES. 



OBSERVATIONS ON JELLIES. 

Jelly is usually made from calves' feet or gelatine ; made 
from the latter, the process is simple ; made from the former, 
it is considered more nutritious and takes a longer time in 
the preparation, and it is also more expensive. The stock 
should be made the day before the jelly is required, while 
gelatine needs only to be dissolved. When veal is in season 
calves' feet will be cheap ; they are usually sold scalded, 
but they will need blanching before using. The first oper- 
ation will be to divide the foot into four pieces through 
the joints between the hoofs, and sawing the bone in two. 
Place in a stewpan with enough cold water to cover them ; 
allow them to come to the boil (this is blanching). Re- 
move from the stewpan, wash in cold water, and having 
thrown away the water they were boiled in, wash oat the 
stewpan and replace the pieces. Cover with two quarts 
and one pint of cold water ; allow it to come gradually to a 
boil. Remove the scum as it rises (be very particular about 
the skimming). Let it simmer about six hofirs ; this done 
strain through a hair sieve and set aside to get cold. The 
following day remove any fat there may be on the top (be 
careful to remove every particle). It is ready now to be 
cleared and flavored. Place in a stewpan ; take two lem- 
ons, pare off the rind (in paring the rind be careful not to 
take any of the white as it would impart a bitier taste). 
Add to the stock ; strain into it also the juice from three 
lemons, and a quarter pound of sugar, four cloves and a 
stick of cinnamon. Now take the whites of two eggs, their 
crushed shells also, and add to the stock. Now stir well 
over the fire till the jelly boils ; remove the pan to the back 
of the stove allowing the cover to be only halfway on. Do 
not touch it for twenty minutes. Then it is ready to clear. 
Dip the jelly bag into hot water, wring dry, and it in winter

place near the fire, if in summer far from it, and drain the 
jelly through the bag, having first placed a vessel to receive 
it. If not clear, drain through a second time. Now add a 
gill of sherry and half a gill of brandy. If a gelatine jelly 
is desired observe the following rules : — In warm weather a 
larger proportion of gelatine will be required for stiffening 
than is necessary in cold, and jelly will set much quicker in 
small moulds than large. It is not wise to make jellies too 
stiflF. They should be stiff enough to retain their shape and 
yet tremble when touched. A good rule is to allow one 
ounce of gelatine to a pint and a half of liquid. Soak the 
gelatine in enough water to cover it for one and a half hours. 
Now take as much water as it is wise to use and add to the 
gelatine, add also sugar, lemon and flavoring ingredients. 
Place the stewpan over the fire, whisk till it rises ; set it at 
the back of the stove, allow to stand twenty minutes, strain 
through a jelly bag, add the wine and set in moulds. 

A good strainer for jelly may be made by using a wooden 
chair without rails on the inside, turn upside down on a 
table ; take a perfectly clean teacloth, tie the four corners 
to the legs of the chair, setting a basin underneath to re- 
ceive the jelly. I'he teacloth should be dipped in boiling 
water before using. Jellies may be strained a third time if 
necessary. 



1046. FBI7IT JELLIES. 

The fruit should be placed in a jar, and the jar set in a stew- 
pan of warm water,covered and allowed to boil until the fruit is 
broken ; take a strong jelly bag and press a little of the fruit 
at a time, turning out each time the skins ; allow two pounds 
of sugar to one quart of juice, set on the stove to boil again. 
Many good cooks heat the sugar by placing in the oven and 
stirring now and then to prevent burning. When the juice be- 
gins to boH (watch that it does not boil over twenty-five min- 
utes), then add the heated sugar ; stir well and just bring to a 
boil, remove directly from the stove, dip the vessels to contain 
it in hot water, and set them upon a dish cloth wrung out of 
warm water, pouring the boiling liquid into them;cover in tho 
usual manned

1047. PINEAPPLE JELLY.— Ingredients — A moderate sized 
pineapple, 1 qt. of jeliy. 

Peel the pineapple, halve lengthwise and cut into thin slices; 
infuse into the jelly the rind of the pineapple (well washed) and 
put first a layer of jelly, and when nearly set lay a border of 
pineapple over one upon another forming a ring, and covei 
with jelly, and so on till all are used. 

1048. MILLED JELL7- — Ingredients— One tablespoonful of 
currant or grape jelly, white of 1 egg, a little loaf sugar. J pt. 
of boiling water, a slice of toast or 2 crackers. 

Take the jelly, beat with it the white of the egg and the 
sugar; pour in the boiling water and break in the toast. 

1049. CRAB APPLE JELL7- — Ingredients — Some nice crab 
apples (Siberian are the best for this purpose), 1 lb. of sugar 
to each pint of juice. 

Cut the apples to pieces neither paring nor seeding them, as 
the seeds give a very pleasant flavor to the jelly ; put into a 
stone vessel and place in a pot of hot water ; allow to boil eight 
or nine hours ; cover the vessel (with the fruit in) tightly and 
leave all night ; next morning squeeze out the juice, add the 
sugar hot in the above proportions, stirring rapidly all the 
time, allow it just to come to the boil and remove directly from 
the stove. Dip your jars in hot water and fill with the scalding 
jelly. 

1050. QT7ZNCE JELL7- — Ingredients — Some ripe quinces, allow- 
ing 1 pt. of water to each pound of fruit, | lb. of sugar to 
each pound of juice. 

Prepare the quinces and put them in water in the above propor- 
tions ; simmer gently till the juice becomes colored, but only 
very pale ; strain the juice through a jelly bag, but do not press 
the fruit, allow it to drain itself. Put the strained juice in a 
preserving pan and boil twenty minutes, then stir in the sugar 
in the above proportions and stir over the fire for twenty min- 
utes, taking off the scum, and pour into glasses to set. It 
should be rich in flavor, but pale and beautifully transparent. 
Long boiling injures the color. 

1051. ItASPSEBZlT JELL7 — Ingredients — Some ripe, carefully 

picked raspberries, allow J lb. of pounded sugar to every 
pound of fruit. 

Boil the raspberries for ten minutes, strain and weigh the

as for raspberry jelly. 

1053. RED CTJRRAITT JELL7.— Ingredients— Red currants, f 
lb. of sugar to 1 lb. of juice. 

Pick the the fruit and simmer it in water for about an hour, 
or until the juice flows freely; strain, boil up the juice, add 
the sugar, and boil again, skimming and stirring well for fifteen 
minutes. Put into small pots, and when cold and firm cover it. 
1054 BLACK OTTRRAITT JELLY- 

Make in the same way, but use a larger proportion of sugar. 

1055. WHITE OURHAITT JELLY.— Ingredients.-Fruit, sugar. 
Pick the fruit carefully, weigh it, aud put into the preserving 

pan equal quantities of fruit and sugar. Boil quickly for ten 
minutes, and strain the juice into the pots ; when cold and 
stiff cover them. 

1056. BLACZBEBEY JELLY. 

Make it as directed for red currant, but use only ten ounces 
of sugar to each pound of juice. The addition of a little lemon 
juice is an improvement. 

1057. BAEBEEEY JELLY- — Ingredients— Barberries, a little 
water, f lb. of sugar to every pound of juice. 

Take ripe barberries, carefully reject any spotted or de- 
cayed ones, wash, drain them and strip off the stalks. Boil 
with a very little water till quite tender, press out and strain 
the juice, boil up the juice, add the sugar, and boil for ten 
minutes, skimming and stirring as above. 

1058. MEDLAR JELLY.— Ingredients— Some ripe medlars, 

sugar. 

Put ripe medlars into a jar with a very little water, bruising 
them slightly as you put them in ; tie down the jar, and put it 
into a slow oven for ten or twelve hours. Stram off the juice 
without pressure, weigh it, and allow equal weights of sugar 
and juice. Boil the juice, add the sugar, and boil again, skim- 
ming and stirring well till it jellies. 

1059. GREEN GOOSEBERRY JELLY-- Ingredients— Some 
carefully picked gooseberries (allowing to each pound of fruit 
I pint of water), to every lb. of juice allow 1 lb. of white 
sifted sugar. 

Boil the fruit in the water, reduce them to a pulp — it will 
take half an hour — strain through a jelly-bag, weigh the sugar 



tH MRS. CLARKE'S COOKERY BOOK. JeLLIES. 



in the above proportions ; boil up the juice quickly and add 
the sugar, boil till reduced to a jelly (about twenty minutes), 
skim and stir well ; pour into pots. 

1060. BED aOOSEBEEIl? JELL7. 

Make it in the same way as the green, but three-quarters 
pound of sugar will be sufficient tor each pound of juice. In 
straining the juice be careful not to press the fruit. The surplus 
fruit, with the addition of some currant juice, can be made 
into common jam for children, &c. 

1061. IfZIZED FRUIT JELLY- — Ingredients— Fruit, straw- 
berries, currants, cherries, etc., i lb. of sugar to each 
pound of juice. 

Take ripe fruit, strip off the stalks and remove the stones 
from the cherries, boil altogether for half an hour, strain the 
juice. Boil up the juice, add the sugar in the above proportions, 
stirring well till quite dissolved, boil again for fifteen or twenty 
minutes till it jellies, stirring frequently, and carefully removing 
all scum as it rises. 

1062. QT7I1TCE JELL7- — Ingredients — Some ripe quinces, to 
every lb. of quince allow 1 lb. of crushed sugar. 

Peel, cut up, and core some fine ripe quinces. Put them in 
sufficient cold water to cover them, and stew gently till soft, 
but not red. Strain the juice without pressure, boil the juice 
for twenty minutes, add the sugar and boil again till it jellies — 
about a quarter of an hour— stir and skim well all the time. 
Strain it again through a napkin, or twice folded muslin, pour 
into pots or moulds, and when cold cover it. The remainder 
of the fruit can be made into marmalade with three-quarters 
pound of sugar, and quarter pound of juicy apples to every 
pound of quinces, or it can be made into compotes or tarts. 

1063. QTJIITOE AND APPLE JELLY-— Ingredients— equal 
quantities of quinces and apples, to every poimd of juice 
allow f lb. of white sugar. 

Stew the fruit separately till tender (the quinces will take 
longer), strain the juice, mix it and add the sugar. Proceed as 
in quince jelly. 

1064. APPLE JELLY. — Ingredients— Some sound apples, allow 
J lb. of sugar to each pound of juice. 

Peel, core, and quarter some sound apples, and throw them 
into cold water as they are done ; boil them till tender, then 
strain the juice from them through a fine sieve,and afterwards 
through a jelly bag — if necessary pass it through twice, as the

juire should be quite clear, boil up the juice, add the snsjar, 
stir till melted, and boil for another ten minutes, add the strain- 
ed juiceof a lemon to every one and half pound juice just before 
it is finished. 

1065. OHAHTRETTSE OF ORANGES.— Ingredients-One-half 
pt. of water, 6 oranges, sugar to taste, 1 wineglass of sherry, 2 
oz. isinglass, 1 pt. cream, some sweetened orange juice, 
make a very clear orange jelly with the water, 4 oranges, 
sherry, 1^ oz. of isinglass, sugar to taste. 

Divide two or three oranges into quarters, and with a sharp 
knife carefully remove from each quarter every particle of skin 
of any sort. Have two plain moulds, one about an inch and a 
quarter more in diameter than the other. Pour a very little 
jelly at the bottom of the larger mould, and place in it a layer 
of orange quarters prepared as above (if too thick, they should 
be split in two lengthwise) ; cover them with more jelly, but 
only put enough to get a smooth surface. Lay this on ice to 
set. When it is nearly firm put the small mould aside the 
large one, taking care to place it exactly in the middle, so that 
the vacant space between the two moulds be of the same width. 
In this vacant space dispose prepared orange quarters, filling 
up the interstices with jelly as you go on, until the whole of 
the space is filled up. Place the mould upon ice and proceed 
to whip a pint of cream with half an ounce of isinglass and 
some sweetened orange juice, which must be added to it a very 
little at a time, else the cream will not rise into a froth. When the 
cream is ready and the jelly set, remove the inner mould by 
pouring warm water into it, and fill up the inner space of the 
chartreuse with the cream. Set it on ice for an hour, turn out 
and server 

1066. PEAOHJELLT. 

Pare, stone and slice the peaches, crack some of the stones 
and remove the kernels, put the peaches and kernels into ajar 
and stand the jar in a pot of boiling water, stir frequently press- 
ing the fruit against the sides of the jar; when it is well broken 
strain, and allow the juice of a lemon to every pint of juice, 
mix and allow one pound of sugar to one pint of juice, put the 
juice on to simmer half and hour then add the sugar hot; allow 
it just to come to a boil, and remove from the fire ; allow to get 
cold ; cover with paper soaked in brandy, then with paper 
brushed over with the white of egg.

lemons, whites of 5 and the broken shells of 2 egga. 
Melt the calfs foot jelly, mix with it the lemon juice, sugar 
and rind of lemon with yolks and shells of eggs. Let it boil 
and then simmer ten minutes ; let it stand a little and then 
pour through a jelly bag till all is clear. A pinch of isinglass 
added during the simmering is of great assistance. Pour it 
into a mould when clear, let it stand till set, and then turn out 
in a glass dish. 

1070. OEAITGE JELLT— Ingredients— Rind of 2 Seville, and 2 
sweet oranges, and 2 lemons, juice of three of each, j lb. of 
lump sugar, ^ pt. of water, 1 qt. of jelly, 2 oz. of isinglass. 

Grate the rind of the Iruit, squeeze the juice, and strain it. 
Take the sugar and water and boil it with the juice till it al- 
most candies. Have ready the jelly, add the syrup to it and 
boil it up once, strain the jelly and let it stand some little 
time to settle before it is poured into the mould. 

1071. AITICE JELLY.— Ingredients— Two tablespoonfuls of gum 
arabic, 2 of isinglass, 2 of white sugar candy, a grated nutmeg, 
a pint of Madeira, or port wine, or milk.

till it becomes a jelly ; when a little hangs on a spoon it is done 
enough. Strain it hot, put it into a well tinned saucepan and 



Jellies. mrs. clarke's cookery book. 191 

add to It the wine and a quarter pound of loaf sugar. Beat 
the whites of the eggs to a froth, and stir sufficiently for the 
whites to mix with the jelly. Boil it two or three minutes, 
then add the juice of the lemons and boil it again two minutes 
longer. When it is finely curdled and of a pure white, pass it 
through a linen bag into a basin until it becomes quite clear, 
and has the appearance of a fine amber color. This is a very 
nice dish for invalids. 

1073. IVORT JELLY- — Ingredients — To each lb. of ivory pow- 
der put 3 quarts of water, juice and rind of 3 lemons, whites 
and shells of 2 egga, ^ pint of good mild beer, and sugar to 
taste. 

Stew the powder and water in an earthen vessel down to 
three pints, which will take about twelve or fourteen hours. 
When cold turn out and take the jelly carefully from the sedi- 
ment. Put the jelly into a clean pan, adding the juice and 
rind of the lemons, eggs, beer and sugar. Stir all well together, 
letting it boil until the sediment rises to the top; remove the 
pan from the fire. Let it stand a few minutes before putting 
it into the jelly bag.j 

1074. PUNOH JBLLT.— Ingredients— Two calves' feet, 4 quarts 
water, sngar to taste, juice and rind of 1 lemon, whites of 3 
eggs whisked to a froth, rum to flavor. 

Take the calves' feet, chop into convenient pieces and put 
them into a saucepan with two quarts of the water. Set the 
saucepan on the fire ; directly the water boils throw it away 
and wash the pieces of feet carefully, then put them on again 
with two more quarts of cold water, and let them boil slowly 
for three hours, removing the scum carefully during the pro- 
cess ; then strain the liquor into a basin, and when quite cold 
and set take off all fat and wash the top of the jelly with hot 
water so as to get rid of every vestige of fat. Put the jelly 
into a saucepan on the fire ; directly it is melted add sugar to 
taste, the juice and rind of the lemon, and the whites of the 
eggs whisked to a froth. Beat up the mixture till it boils. 
Place the thin rind of a lemon at the bottom of a jelly bag, and 
pour the mixture over it The bag should have been previous- 
ly rinsed in boiling water, and the first half pint of jelly that 
comes through must be returned to the bag. If the jelly does 
not come out quite clear, the operation of straining must be re- 
peated ; add sufficient rum to the clarified jelly to flavor it well, 
pour into a mould and place it on ice to set. At the time of 
serving dip the mould in hot water, and turnout the jelly.

1075. S'^EET WINE JELLT. — Ingredients— One oz. of ising- 
giags dissolved in a pint of water, J lb. loaf sugar, a large 
glass of sweet wine (any that you prefer). 

Add the dissolved isinglass to the sugar and simmer for ten 
minutes. Add the wine and mix well. Strain through mus- 
lin. Let it stand a little while to settle, but not long enough 
to get cold, then pour it off clear into a mould. 

1076. APPLE JELLY- — Ingredients — One lb. of moist sugar, 1 
lb. of apples, one lemon — the juice of the lemon to be used 
and the rind added — cut very fine. 

Boil the whole until it becomes a perfect jelly; let it stand 
in a mould till quite firm and cold, turn it out and stick it 
with almonds ; set custard round. If for dessert, use a small 
plain mould. 

1077. SAGO JELL7' — Ingredients — Two lbs. of picked red cur- 
rants, 1 pint of cold water, ^ lb. of white sugar, a cupful of 
sago. 

Put the currants into the water and boil till soft, pass them 
through a sieve ; put the juice to boil again with the sugar; 
when quite boiling add the sago previously soaked in cold 
water ; boil twenty minutes until quite transparent, put into a 
mould and when cold turn out. Serve.with or without custard 
around it. 

1078. MAOEDOINE de FUTTITS a la aELLEE -Ingredients 

— Some pears, apples, plums, cherries and apricots, or any 

variety of fruit that you choose, a gelatine jelly, a glass of 

champagne. 

Stew the fruit carefully, and cut into pieces ; prepare the 

gelatine jelly and flavor with the champagne ; fill a mould with 

alternate layers of jelly and fruit, and serve after freezng. If 

the fruit is very ripe it is better not to cook it ; indeed no soft 

fruit, strawberries, etc., ever requires cooking for a macddoine. 

1079. ASPIO JELLT.— Ingredients— Two calves' feet, a little 
salt, 2 lbs. of knuckle of veal, 2 shalots, 35 peppercorns, 2 
sprigs of parsley, 1 of thyme, 1 leek,|l onion, 4 cloves, 2 car-

pint of water, set on the fire to boil, it must come slowly to 
the point (be careful to skim), and directly it boils add half a 
teaspoonful of salt, the peppercorns, mace, clove of garlic, 
shalots, thyme, and parsley. Stick the clove in the onions, 
wash the leek and celery in ice water, wash and scrape carrots, 
wash and peel the turnips, now add the ingredients to the 
stewpan, putting in also the tarragon, chervil, and bay leaves, 
allow to simmer six hours. At the end of this time strain 
through a hair sieve ; now set in a cool place and when per- 
fectly cold remove all fat, dip a clean cloth in hot water and 
dab over the jelly to remove every particle of fat. Peel the 
lemon thinly and put the peel into a stewpan, strain the juice 
into it also, whip the whites of the eggs and put them and the 
shells with the veal chopped finely into the stewpan, now add 
the sherry and vineger, salt and pepper to taste, and whip 
thoroughly, put in the jelly stock, whisking until it boils, skim 
if required ; now remove to the back of the stove for half an 
hour, strain, now put a clean basin under the strainer, pour a 
ladleful of the jelly over the meat left in the strainer and let it 
strain slowly into the basin. If the jelly is required for a border 
scald the mould in boiling water, then in cold, place the mould 
on ice (be sure it stands firmly), pour in sufficient jelly to cover 
the bottom of the mould, when slightly set garnish with vege- 
tables or with what it is to be served; pour the rest of the jelly in 
and allow it to get quite cold. When needed for table, dip the 
mould in hot water and remove instantly, turn on dish and serve. 

1080. CLAKET JBLLT. — Ingredients— One bottle of claret, juice 
and rind of a lemon, 1 pot of red currant jelly, J lb. loa^'sugar, 
rather more than 1 oz. of isinglass, and a wineglass of brandy.

it get cold. Serve with cream sauce (half pint cream, sweetened, 
flavored with vanilla, and slightly whisked) poured over it. 

1081. ORANBERPmY AND RIOE JELLY-— Ingredients— Cran- 

berries, enough boiled ground rice to thicken to a jelly, sugar. 

Boil and press the fruit, mix in the rice, stirring it ; sweeten 

to taste. Put into a mould. When set serve with milk or cream. 

1082. A TASTY JELLY.— Ingredients-Half a breakfast cup of 

calf's foot jelly, the same of rich cream, 1 wineglass of sherry, 

flavoring and sugar to taste. 
Color the jelly brown with a little burnt sugar, see " Color- 
ings," page 253, and add the flavoring ; have ready an open 
mould which has been soaked in cold water for thirty minutes. 
Put the jelly into it and leave it to set ; then turn on to a glass 
dish and fill up the middle with the cream well whipped, 
flavored with the sherry, and sweetened, and serve.

MILK, BUTTER & CHEESE. 

OBSERVATIONS. 

Great attention and cleanliness are required in the 
management of a dairy. The cows should be regularly 
milked at an early hour, and their udders perfectly emptied. 
In good pastures the cows produce, on an average, three 
gallons a day, from Lady Day to Michaelmas, and from 
thence to Christmas one gallon a day. 

The quantity of milk depends on many causes ; as the 
goodness, breed, and health of the cow, the pasture, the 
length of time from calving, the having plenty of clean 
water in the field she feeds in, etc. A change of pasture 
will tend to increase it. 

When a calf is to be reared, it should be removed from 
the cow in ten days at the farthest. It should be removed 
in the morning and no food given to it till the following 
morning, when, being extremely hungry, it will drink read- 
ily ; feed it regularly morning and evening, and let the milk 
which is given to it be just warm ; skimmed milk will be 
quite good enough. 

The milk when brought in should always be strained into 
the pans. In some of the best dairies the floors are covered 
with running water to the depth of nbout eighteen inches, 
in which the milk is set in buckets or cans eight or ten 
inches in diameter, and about twenty inches in height. 
The temperature should be about 56° F. Instead of having 
the water run over the floor, it is better to allow it to pass 
through vats or troughs. When the cans containing the 
recently drawn milk are placed in the water, which should 
rise a little above the level of the milk, the animal heat is 
soon reduced to between 56° and 58° F. ; and the milk will 
keep sweet for thirty-six hours even in the hottest weather. 
This temperature allows the cream to rise with greater 
facility and with less admixture of other constituents than 

294 



Milk, &c mrs. clarke's cookery book. 295 

can be obtained in any other way. Some butter-makers 
allow the milk to stand for thirty-six hours ; others say that 
twenty-four hours is sufficient for all the cream to rise. 
After the cream has risen it is to be removed by skimming, 
and after standing a suitable time is placed in the churn. 
The kind of churn generally preferred by the best butter- 
makers is the common dash churn, made of white oak. 
Much depends upon the manner in which the operation is 
performed, even with the same churn. The motion should 
be steady and regular, not too quick nor too slow. The time 
occupied in churning 12 or 15 gallons of cream should be 
from 40 to 60 minutes. When removed from the churn, it 
should be thoroughly washed in cold water, using a ladle 
and not the hands. It should then be salted with about 
one-twentieth of its weight of the purest and finest salt, 
which should be thoroughly incorporated with it, by means 
of a butter worker or ladle, the hands being never allowed 
to touch the butter. Twelve hours afterwards another 
working should be performed and the butter packed in 
strong and perfectly tight white oak firkins. When filled 
they should be headed up and a strong brine poured in at 
the top. It should then be placed in a cool, well-ventilated 
cellar. 

Dr. Ure gives the following directions for curing butter, 
known as the Irish method : " Take one part of sugar, one 
of nitre, and two of the best Spanish great salt, and rub 
them together into a fine powder. This composition is to 
be mixed thoroughly with the butter as soon as it is com- 
pletely freed from the milk, in the proportion of i ounce to 
16 ; and the butter thus prepared is to be pressed tight into 
the vessel prepared to receive it, so as to leave no vacu- 
ities. This butter does not taste well till it has stood at 
least a fortnight ; it then has a rich, marrowy flavor that no 
other butter ever acquires." 



1083. PRESERVING BUTTER. 

Two pounds of common salt, one pound of loaf sugar, and 
one pound of saltpetre. Beat the whole well together, then, 
to fourteen pounds of butter, put one pound of this mixture, 



296 MRS. CLARKE'S COOKERY BOOK. MiLK, &C. 

work it well, and when cold and firm put it into glazed 
earthen vessels that will hold fourteen pounds each. 
Butter thus preserved becomes better by being kept, but 
it must be kept from the air, and securely covered down. 
If inten(ffed for winter use, add another ounce of the mixture to 
every pound of butter, and on the top of the pans, lay enough 
salt to cover them with brine. 

10S4. CLOTJTED OAEAld. 

In order to obtain this, the milk is suffered to stand in a 
vessel for twenty-four-hours. It is then placed over a stove, or 
slow fire, and very gradually heated, to an almost simmering 
state, below the boiling point. When this is accomplished, 
(the first bubble having appeared), the milk is removed Irom 
the fire, and allowed to stand for twenty-four hours more. At 
the end of this time, the cream will have arisen to the surface 
in a thick or clouted state, and is removed. In this state it is 
eaten as a luxury ; but it is often converted into butter, which 
is done by stirring it briskly with the hand or a stick. The 
butter thus made, although more in quantity, is not equal in 
quality to that procured from the cream which has risen slowly 
and spontaneously ; and in the largest and best dairies in the 
Vale of Honiton, the cream is never clouted, except when in- 
tended for the table in that state. 

1085. RENNET (to prepare). 

Take out the stomach of a calf just killed, and scour it well 
with salt and water, both inside and out ; let it drain, and then 
sew it up with two large handfuls of salt in it, or keep it in the 
salt wet, and soak a piece in fresh water as it is required. 

1056. BTTTTEBltllLE. 

If made of sweet cream, is a delicious and most wholesome 
food. Those who can relish sour buttermilk, find it still more 
light and it is reckoned more beneficial in consumptive cases. 
Buttermilk, if not very sour, is also as good as cream to eat 
with fruit, if sweetened with white sugar, and mixed with a 
very little milk. It likewise does equally for cakes and rice- 
puddings, and of course it is economical to churn before the 
cream is too stale for anything but to feed pigs. 

1057. CHEAM (to Hanase for "Wliey-Butter). 

Set the whey one day and night, skim it, and so till yon have 
enough ; then boil it and pour it into a pan or two of cold 
water. As the cream rises, skim it till no more comes ; then 
churn it. Where new-milk cheese is made daily, whey-butter 
for common and present use may be made to advantage. 



Milk, &c: mrs. Clarke's cookery book. 297 

1088. IdAITHS D^HOTEL BX7TTER— ingredients— 2 oz. of 
fresh butter, juice of 1 lemon, white sugar and salt to taste, 
parsley blanched, freed from moisture and finely minced. 

Put the butter in a basin with the other ingredients, incor- 
porate the whole effectually and quickly, and put it by in a cool 
place till wanted. 

1089. "WATER CRESS BUTTER.— Ingredients— ^ lb of nice 
fresh butter, a bunch of watercress. 

Mince the watercress finely, and mix well in with the butter. 
Roll into little shapes with butter pats. 

1090. APPLE BITTTER.— Ingredienta— To 3 pecks of tart cook- 
ing apples allow 9 lbs. of brown sugar, and a little more than 
2 gallons of water. 

Put the sugar and water in your kettle, and let it boil ; then 
add the apples. After they begin to cook stir constantly till 
the butter is done. Try it by putting a little in a saucer, and 
if no water appears around it the marmalade is ready for the 
cinnamon and nutmeg " to your taste.'' 

1091. BXTTTER (to serve as a little dish). 

Roll butter in different forms ; either like a pine, and make 
the marks with a teaspoon, or roll it in crimping rollers, work 
it through a cullender, or scoop with a teaspoon, and mix with 
grated beef, tongue, or anchovies. Make a wreath of curled 
parsley to garnish. 

1092. 0T7RLED BTJTTER. 

Procure a strong cloth, and secure it by two of its corners to 
a nail or hook in the wall ; knot the remaining two corners, 
leaving a small space. Then place your butter into the cloth ; 
twist firmly over your serving dish and the butter will force its 
way between the knots in little curls or strings. Garnish with 
parsley and send to table. 

1093. DAISY BX7TTER.— Ingredients— 2 tablespoonfuls of white 
sugar, the yolks of 2 hard-boiled egga, 2 teaspoonfuls of 
orange flower water, J lb. oi fresh butter. 

Pound the yolks with the orange flower water (in a mortar) 
to a smooth paste, then mix in the sugar and butter. Now 
place in a clean cloth, and force the mixture through by wring- 
mg. The butter will fall upon the dish in pieces according to 
the size of the holes in the cloth. 

1094. MELTED BT7TTER.— Ingredients— 5 oz. of butter, 1 
tablespoonful of flour, 3 tablespoonfuls of water, salt to taste. 

Put all the ingredients into a slewpan, and stir one way over 



298 MRS. CLARKE'S COOKERY BOOK. MiLK, &C. 

the fire until all the ingredients are well mixed. Allow it just 
to boil, and it is ready to serve. 

1095. A FEETTY DISE CF BTTTTEH. 

With a pair of butter pats, form some butter into balls the 
size of marbles. Set in a pretty dish, with a piece of ice, and 
sprigs of parsley strewn over. 

1096. OBESSB (to malie). 

Warm the milk till equal to new ; but observe it must not 
be too hot ; now add a sufficiency of rennet to turn it, and cover 
it over ; let it remain till well turned, then strike the curd well 
down with the skimming-dish, and let it separate, observing 
to keep it still covered. Put the vat over the tub, and fill it 
with curd, which must be squeezed close with the hand, and 
more is to be added as it sinks, and at length left about three 
inches above the edge of the vat. Before the vat is in this 
manner filled, the cheese cloth must be laid at the bottom of it, 
and, when full, drawn smoothly over on all sides. The curd 
should be salted in the tub after the whey is out. When every- 
thing is prepared as above directed, put a board under and 
over the vat, then place it in the press ; let it remain two hours, 
then turn it out, put on a fresh cheese cloth, and press it again 
ten hours ; then salt it all over, and turn it again into the vat ; 
then press it again twenty hours. The vat should have several 
small holes in the bottom to let the whey run ofif. 

1097. OEEESE (to preserve Soiml)- 

Wash in warm whey, when you have any, and wipe it once 
a month, and keep it on a rack. If you want to ripen it, a 
damp cellar will bring it forward. When a whole cheese is 
cut, the larger quantity should be spread with butter inside, 
and the outside wiped to preserve it. To keep those in daily 
use moist, let a clean cloth be wrung out from cold water, and 
wrapt round them when carried from table. Dry cheese may 
be used to advantage to grate for serving with macaroni, or 
eating without. These observations are made with a view to 
make the above articles less expensive, as in most families 
where much is used there is waste. 

1098. OEEAIA OEEESE (l). 

Put five quarts of strippings, that is, the last of the milk, into 
a pan with two spoonfuls of rennet. When the curd is come, 
strike it down two or three times with the skimming-dish just 
to break it. Let it stand two hours, then spread a cheese-cloth 
on a sieve, put the curd on it, and let the whey drain ; break 



Milk, &c. mrs. clarke's cookery book. 299 

the curd a little with your hand, and put it into a vat with a 
two-pound weight upon it. Let it stand twelve hours, take it 
out, and bind a fillet round. Turn every day till dry^ from one 
board to another ; cover them with nettles, or clean dockleaves, 
and put between two pewter-plates to ripen. If the weather be 
warm, it will be ready in three weeks. 

1099. CEEAH CHEESE (2). 

Have ready a kettle of boiling water, put five quarts of new 
milk into a pan, five pints of cold water, and five of hot ; when 
of a proper heat, put in as much rennet as will bring it in twen- 
ty minutes, likewise a piece of sugar. When come, strike the 
skimmer three or four times down, and leave it on the curd. 
In an hour or two lade it into the vat without touching it ; put 
a two-pound weight on it when the whey has run from it, and 
the vat is full, 

1100. CEEAld CHEESE (3). 

Put as much salt to three pints of raw cream as will season 
it ; stir it well and pour it into a sieve in which you have folded 
a cheese-cloth three or four times, and laid at the bottom. 
When it hardens, cover it with nettles on a pewter-plate. 

1101. CUE AM CHEESE (4). 

To a quart of fresh cream put a pint ot new milk warm 
enough to make the cream a proper warmth, a piece of sugar, 
and a little rennet. Set near the fire till the curd comes ; fill 
a vat made in the form of a brick, of wheat-straw or rushes 
sewed together. Have ready a square of straw, or rushes 
sewed flat, to rest the vat on, and another to cover it ; the vat 
being open at top and bottom. Next day take it out, and 
change it as above to ripen. A half-pound weight will be suf- 
ficient to put on it. 

1102. CREAM CHEESE (5).— Ingredients— To one pint of fresh 
rich cream allow one teaspoonful of renuet and a little salt. 

Let it stand for two days, stirring twice with a silver spoon. 
Tie up in a cloth (in the form of a dumpling), put this into 
another coarse cloth, and bury it for two days. Make into 
proper shape with butter utensils. 

1103. CREAM CHEESE (6).— Ingredients— One pint of rich raw 
cream, a dessertspoonful of salt. 

Put the salt into the cream ; fold a napkin double on the 
shallow end of a hair sieve — a sieve of about six inches in 
diameter. Pour the cream into the hollow lined with the napkin, 
In eight or ten hours the cheese will be fit to turn. Take a fresh 



300 MRS. Clarke's cookery book. Milk, &c. 

napkin, doubled, place it on the top of the cheese, and turn 
the sieve over, so that the cheese may drop out on t e dry 
cloth. Replace it in the sieve, so that it may both dra. n and 
keep in shape. For the two following days the n'apkins 
should be changed at least three times each day. On the 
fourth day the cheese will be ready for use. 

1104. SAaS CHEESE. 

Bruise some young red sage and spinach leaves, express the 
juice, and mix it with the curd ; then proceed as with other 
cheese. 

1105. AFFLE CHEESE- — Ingredients — Equal weight of white 
sugar and apples, juice of 2 lemons and the peel cut 
finely, — custard. 

Peel, pare, and core the apples, and cut into small pieces. 
Add the sugar, lemon juice and peel. Put them on the fire and 
keep moving them about to prevent their burning. Boil until 
the apples are quite mashed up and look clear, and in stirring 
the bottom of the pan comes clean. Dip a mould in cold water, 
put in your cheese, and serve next day cold with a custard 
round it. 

1106. CHEESE STBA'VTS- — Ingredients — 6oz. of flour, 4 oz. of 
butter, 3 oz. of grated Parmesan cheese, a little cream, salt,

Press it down in a deep pot. 

1108. HOAST CHEESE- — Ingredients — 3 oz. of Cheshke cheese, 
yolks of 2 eggs, 4 oz. of grated breadcrumbs, 3 oz. of butter, 
a dessert spoonful of mustard, salt and pepper. 

Grate the cheese, add the yolks, breadcrumbs, and butter ; 
beat the whole well in a mortar and add the mustard, salt and 
pepper. Make some toast cut into neat slices and spread the 
paste thickly on. Cover with a dish and place in the oven till 
hot through, then uncover and let the cheese color a light 
brown. Serve immediately. 

1109. IflUSCLE-FLTTM CHEESE.— Ingredients— 6 lbs. of fruit, 
2i Iba. of good Lisbon cheese. 

Bake the fruit in a stone jar, remove the stones and add the 
kernels. Pour half the juice on the cheese ; when melted and 



Milk, &c. mrs. Clarke's cookery book. 301 

simmered a few minutes skim and add the fruit. Keep it 
doing very gently till all the juice is evaporated, stirring all 
the time. Pour into moulds. 

1110. OSEESE TOAST- —Ingredients — Some nice bnttwr, made 
mustard and salt, a little Gloucester oheeae, totust. 

Mix the butter, mustard and salt, spread on toast and sprinkle 
with the cheese, grated. 

1111. CHEESE DISE- — Ingredients — Quarter lb. of good fresh 
cheese. We mean not very old, or much dried, 1 cup of 
sweet milk, ^ of a teaapoonful of dry mustard. A little pepper 
and salt, tablespoonful of butter.

saucepan, and pour over it the milk, mix in the other ingre- 
dients. Stir this mixture all the time while over the fire. Turn 
the contents into a hot dish and serve immediately. 

1112. CHEESE TOAST — Ingredients— Some rich cheese, pepper 
to taste, a beaten egg with sufficient milk to make it of the 
consistency of cream. 

Grate the cheese and mix with the other ingredients ; warm 
the mixture on the fire and when quite hot pour it ever some 
slices of hot buttered toast ; serve immediately. 

1113. PARMESAN PONDTTE— Ingredients— Half oz. of fresh 
butter, a tablespoonful of flour, a small quantity of milk, 3 
oz. of grated Parmesan cheese, 1 pod of garlic, a small quan- 
tity of flour of mustard, a dash of powdered nutmeg, some 
white pepper, yolks of 3 eggs beaten up in a little milk, 
whites of 5 eggs whisked to a stiff froth. 

Melt the butter in a saucepan, stir into it the flour, when the 
two are well amalgamated put in a small quantity of milk and 
the Parmesan cheese ; stir the mixture on a slow fire till it as- 
sumes the appearance of thick cream, but be careful not to let 
it boil ;then add the garlic, flour of mustard, powdered nutmeg, 
and white pepper ; mix thoroughly, and, if required, add a 
little salt ; keep on stirring the mixture at a very moderate 
heat for about ten minutes, then remove the pod of garlic, take 
the saucepan off the fire, and stir the contents occasionally un- 
til quite cold, when you stir into them the yolks of the eggs 
beaten up with a little milk, and strained, and finally the whites 
of five eggs whisked into a stiff froth. Pour the mixture into a 
deep round tin, put it into the oven, which must not be too 
hot ; in about twenty or thirty minutes the fondue will have 
risen and taken color. Pin a napkin round the tin, and serve 
quickly.

cheese, a little ale or white wine, a spoonful of mustard, 
Bome thin toasted or fried sippets. 

Cut the cheese into thin slices, put it into a stewpan with 
the ale or white wine and keep stirring over the fire till it is 
melted; put in a spoonful of the mustard, stir it a moment over 
the fire, then put into a small deep dish, and brown it with a 
very hot salamander; have ready the sippets, stick all round 
and in the middle. Serve hot and quickly. 

1115. OTJRD FOR OHEESEOAKES.—Ingredients— One qxiart

currants. 

Put a quart of new milk into a clean pan, and set it by the 
side of the fire so that it will keep blood warm ; put the rennet 
into it, too much will make the curd hard and the whey very 
salt ; in a short time, it will be separated into curd and whey, 
which cut into small pieces with a knife. Or, put in a small 
piece of alum, about the size of a nutmeg, into the milk, and 
let it boil. Strain the curd from the whey by means of a hair 
sieve, either let it drain, or press it dry ; pass the curd through 
the sieve, by squeezing it into a basin. Melt the butter and 
mix with the curd, also two or three eggs, or else one egg and 
four yolks ; add sugar to your palate ; with a little grated nut- 
meg, and a few currants if approved of; mix the whole to- 
gether, and fill the cases.

inches long and a quarter of an inch wide, bake a few minutes 
in a warm oven, pile them up on a napkin, and serve very hot, 

1121. EZCOTTA. 

This is a delicious dairy produce, obtainable in southern 
Italy, and for anyone having a dairy, it is worthy of a trial. 
Here are two recipes for making ricotta. Take nine and a half 
pints of milk, dissolve four grammes (about one-eighth of an 
ounce) of rennet in a little of it, mix it with the rest, and pour 
the whole into a flat copper pan. Place this on a slow fire, 
and work it well with a rotolo—i.e.^ a stick with a wooden disk 
attached to its extremity. As soon as the milk is warm remove 
che pan from the fire, and cover it with a cloth, and when cold 
work it again with the stick ; gather all that is coagulated, put 
it in a grass basket, and leave it to season. With the liquid 
'vnat remains in the pan the ricotta is made in this wise : Add 
halt a pint of fresh milk to it, put it in the pan on a slow fire, 
and work it lightly with the rotolo. A white froth will rise to 
the surface, and this carefully skimmed off and put into deep 
^iarrow grass baskets, constitutes the ricotta. Another way is 
:;5 follows : When the first cheese has been taken off, the liquid 
/.••at remains is strained through a very fine cloth, a few drops 
^f rennet are added, and the pan is put on a gentle fire ; at a 
__:Uin degree of heat (30° Reau.) the ricotta will rise in a 
white froth, then the pan must be removed from the fire and 
covered with a cloth ; when the contents have cooled the ricotta 
is gathered up with a spoon, and placed in grass baskets, as 
above.

1122. IffAOARONI.— Ingredients— J lb. of butter, | lb. of tubular 
macaroni, 5 oz. of Parmesan cheese, 2 glasses of miUE, 1 quari 
of water, pepper and salt to taste. 

Mix the milk and water, salting it to taste, place in a stevi* 
pan on the fire, bring to a boil and drop in the macaroni. 
When tender, drain and dish. Grate three ounces of the cheese 
and mix with the macaroni. Now mix in half of the butter, 
sprinkling a little pepper over. Put the rest of the grated cheese 
on the top, covering with bread crumbs. Warm the rest of 
butter (do not let it oil), pour over the breadcrumbs. Brown 
before the fire or with a salamander. 

1123. MACARONI A LA RUNI.— Ingredients— Eight oz. mac- 

aroni, 10 oz. of any rich well-flavored cheese, | pt. of good 
cream, a little salt, seasoning of cayenne, ^ a salt spoonful of 
pounded mace, 2 oz. of sweet fresh butter. 

Boil the macaroni in the usual way, and by the time it is 
sufficiently tender dissolve gently the cheese in the 
above quantity of cream, add a little salt and rather a full sea- 
soning of cayenne. Now add the pounded mace and butter. 
The cheese should, in the first instance, be sliced very thin, 
and taken quite free of the hard part adjoining the rind ; it 
should be stirred in the cream without intermission until it is 
entirely dissolved, and the whole is perfectly smooth : the mac- 
aroni, previously well drained, may then be tossed gently 
in it, or after it is dished, the cheese may be poured equally 
over the macaroni. The whole, in either case, may be thickly 
.overed before it is sent to table, with fine crumbs of bread fried 
of a pale gold color, and dried perfectly, either before the fire 
or in an oven, when such an addition is considered an improve- 
ment. As a matter of precaution, it is better to boil the cream 
before the cheese is melted in it ; rich white sauce, made net 
very thick, with an additional ounce or two of butter, may be, 
used to vary and enrich this preparation. Do not use Parrvs- 
san cheese for this dish.

TEA, ITS HISTORY AND COMMERCE. 

All that can be affirmed regarding the early history of 
this beverage, is that it appears to have been used for ages 
in China, where it is believed by the natives to be indig- 
enous. It first became known to Europeans at the end of 
the 1 6th century, though it is only mentioned by the 
Portuguese writer Maffei, in his historic Indicoea, who re- 
fers to it as a product of both China and Japan. The 
first reference to it by a native of Britain is in a letter 
dated 27th June, 1615, written by a Mr. Wickham, which 
is in the records of the East India Company, and it is cur- 
ious to observe that both the Portuguese and English 
writers referred to use their own rendering of the native 
name, which is Tcha ; MafTei calls it " Chia," and Mr. 
Wickham " Chaw." From this time it gradually became 
known to the wealthy inhabitants of London in the form 
of occasional presents of small quantities from India ob- 
tained from China, or by small lots in the market in Britain 
from time to time, but always at exorbitant prices, fetching 
sometimes as much as $50 per pound, and never less than 
$25. From that time to the present many changes have taken 
place, both as regards the duties levied and otherwise, un- 
til now, when the duty is only 6d. per pound. The import 
for the year 1880 being 206,698,971 pounds, valued at 
;^ir,63i,398 sterling, shows how generally the beverage 
is used. In 

THE PREPARATION OF TEA, 

Black, Mixed or Green, care should always be taken that 
the tea-pot has been thoroughly scalded out and is perfectly 
dry indde before you proceed to make the tea. Put in, say, 
one spoonful for each person, the water all being put on at 
oiK:e in a thoroughly boiling state. Very great care should 
3Ri '^ 



3o6 MRS. Clarke's cookery book. Beverages. 

be given to this matter, as it requires the temperature of 
boiling water to extract the peculiar oil of tea. As a given 
quantity of tea is similar to a given quantity of malt, only 
imparting strength to a given quantity of water, therefore 
any additional quantity is a waste and gives a vapid flavor 
to tea ; much better use two tea-pots instead of two draw- 
ings. It should be allowed to stand from eight to ten 
minutes, and if the teapot is placed under a cosy the 
drawing qualities of the tea are brought out much quicker. 
With regard to Japan Teas, if the follomng instructions 
are strictly adhered to, we can assure our readers they will 
have a delicious beverage : 

1. An earthenware tea-pot or pitcher should be used. 

2. The boiling water should a// be poured into the pot at 
one time, and tea put on top of the water. 

3. The tea should be allowed to stand for twenty min- 
utes on the stove, at near the boiling point — it should then 
be boiled for four or five minutes. 

The above notes on tea and tea-making are contributed 
by the world-renowned Li-Quor Tea Co., one of the best 
authorities on any matter relating to tea known. 

The employment of coffee, as a beverage, was introduced 
from Arabia in the i6th century into Egypt and Constanti- 
nople. Leonhard Rauwolf, a German physician, was pro- 
bably the first to make coffee known in Europe by the ac- 
count of his travels printed in 1573. Soon after the first in- 
troduction of coffee, coffee-houses arose almost everywhere. 
The trade now is of great importance. In 1S80 the total 
quantity imported into the United Kingdom was 1,546,130 
cwts., of which 850,000 cwts. were imported from Ceylon 
and other British possessions, the computed real value 
being ;^6,86i,i3o, or about lod. per pound. 



1124. OOrrEB (llO^ to prepare) —Ingredients — Allow 2 large 

teaspoonf uls of coffee to each person, and to this quantity ^ 

pint of water. 

It is a good plan to have an iron ring to fit the top of the 

coffee pot inside, and have a small muslin bag attached (be 

sure and not ha*.'e muslin too thin), put into the pot the muslin 

bag and pour boiling water in it, and when the pot is well 



Beverages. mrs. Clarke's cookery book. 307 

warmed put into the bag the quantity of ground coffee you 
are about to use, then pour over as much boiling water as is 
required and close the lid. When all the water has drained 
through remove the bag and the coffee is then ready for the 
table. Preparing coffee in this manner prevents the necessity 
of changing the coffee from one vessel to another, which 
cools and spoils it. Water should be poured on coffee very 
slowl)', as this will cause the infusion to be much stronger. 
N. B. Ee careful in making the bag that the seams are well 
sewn, or the grounds will escape and spoil the coffee. Send to 
table with a pitcher of scalded milk. 

1125 TEA OR OOPPEE "WITH EG&. 

Beat up a new laid egg well, in a breakfast cup till it is quite 
frothy, then fill up the cup with either tea or coffee, adding 
milk and sugar to taste. To a delicate person there is much 
more support given in a cup of tea or coffee made in this way 
than if taken plain. 

1126. COFFEE (anotlier method of making:). 

First, take an earthenware jug to hold the required quantity 
— it must not only be made in this, but served too, as it is 
sweeter than either silver or metal, and they can be bought 
both strong, and of suitable appearance for the table. We will 
suppose four cups are wanted. Put eight heaped teaspoonfuls 
offreshly ground coffee and one teaspoonful ofpure chicory in, for 
whatever may be said against the latter article, it is, whi.i 
good, and in proper proportion, a considerable improvement. 
Now, with the lid on it, put the jug where it is warm for five 
minutes, then pour on boiling water, let it stand in a very hot 
place three minutes, take a spoon and stir the coffee, place the 
jug on the cold stand, and in two minutes it will be perfectly 
clear. If for breakfast a dessert spoonful of really good thick 
cream for each cup is necessary. Should this meal be one over 
which there is no hurry, then a jug of boiled milk is preferable, 
but it should be fresh, not milk that has stood and had the 
cream taken from it. I will just add that many people would 
ike the mixture a little stronger when taken after dinner. 

1127. COCOA (to make)-— Ingredients— 2 tablespoonfuls of cocoa, 
1 breakfast cupful of boiling milk and water. 

Put sufficient cold milk in to form the cocoa into a smooth 
paste. Now add equal proportions of boiling milk and boiling 
water, mixing well. N. B. — Great care must be taken that the 
milk does not burn, or it will impart a disagreeable flavor. 



3o8 MRS. CLARKE'S COOKERY BOOK. BEVERAGES. 

1128. OEOCOLATZ (to prepare)- — Ingredients — Allow 1 oz. 
chocolate, Ijn pts. water and same quantity of milk to every 
two persons. 

Heat the milk and water, grate the chocolate into it and stir 
quickly until the chocolate is dissolved, bring it to the point of 
boiling, and serve with sugar to taste. 

1129. COFFES l^ILE- — Ingredients — 1 dessertspoonful of ground 
coflee to a pint of milk, 2 or 3 shavings of isinglass. 

Boil the coffee in the milk for nearly a quarter of an hour, 
then put in the isinglass to clear it ; let it boil a few minutes 
and set on the back of the stove to clarify. This is very good 
for breakfast. It should be sweetened with sugar of good 
quality. 

1130. ORANBEEpIIY DUIITIS. — Ingredients — A teacup of cran- 
berries, 1 large spoonful of oatmeal, a piece of lemon peel, 
sugar, i pt. of white wine. 

Put the cranberries into a cup of water and mash them. Boil 
in the meantime two quarts of water with the oatmeal and 
lemon peel ; add the cranberries and sugar (taking care not to 
put too much, or else the fine sharpness of the fruit will be lost). 
Then add the wine ; boil for half an hour and strain. 

1131. OATltlEAL DEZITZ (Becipe lay the late Dr. Farkes). 

" The proportions are a quarter pound of oatmeal to two or 
three quarts of water, according to the heat of the day and the 
work and thirst ; it should be well boiled, and then an ounce 
or one and a half ounces of brown sugar added. If you find it 
thicker than you like, add three quarts of water. Before drink- 
ing it shake up the oatmeal well through the liquid. In sum- 
mer drink this cold ; in winter hot. You will find it not only 
quenches thirst, but will give you more strength and endurance 
than any other drink. If you cannot boil it you can take a 
little oatmeal mixed with cold water and sugar, but this is not 
so good ; always boil it if you can. If at any time you nave to 
make a very long day, as in harvest, and cannot stop for meals, 
increase the oatmeal to half pound or even three-quarters 
pound, and the water to three quarts if you are likely to be very 
thirsty. If you cannot get oatmeal, wheat-flour will do, but not 
quite so well." Those who tried this recipe last year found 
that they could get through more work than when using beer, 
and were stronger and healthier at the end of the harvest. 
Cold tea and skim milk are also found to be better than beer, 
but not equal to the oatmeal drink.

the beginning of April, and it will be fit for use in July or Au- 
gust. If not sour enough, which is seldom the case when not 
properly managed, let it stand a month longer before bottling 
oit'. While making, it must never be disturbed, after the first 
week or ten days ; if in very fine weather the bung hole would 
be best left open all day, but must be closed at night. Before 
bottling it may be drawn off into afresh cask ; and, if it fill a 
large barrel, a handful of shred isinglass may be thrown in or 
less, in proportion to the quantity ; this, after standing a few 
days, will make the vinegar fine, and it may be drawn ofT, or 
bottled for use. This vinegar, though very strong, may be 
used in pickling for sea-store or exportation without being 
lowered ; but for home pick'es it will bear mixing with at least 
an equal quantity of cold spring water. There are few pickles 
for which this vinegar need be boiled. Without boiling it will 
keep walnuts, even for the East or West Indies ; but then, as 
remarked in general of pickles for foreign use, it must not be 
mixed with water. If much vinegar be made, so as to require 
expensive casks, the outside should be painted, for the sake of 
preserving them.

Beverages, mrs. clarkk's cookery book. 315 

1165. NOYBATT (1)— Ingredients— i lb. of apricot kernels, the 
same of cherry kernels, 1 quart of brandy, 2 lbs. of white 
sugar. 

Infuse the apricot and cherry kernels in the brandy. Stir 
from time to time for three weeks ; then pour off the liquid from 
the kernels. Melt the sugar in the water. Mix all together 
and filter. 

1166. NOTEATJ (2).— Ingredients— 1 gallon of 'whiskey, 3 lbs. of 
loaf sugar, the rind and juice of three large lemons, 1 lb. of 
bitter almonds blanched and bruised in a mortar. 

Let all the ingredients stand in a covered jar for six weeks» 
stirring daily, then filter through blotting paper and bottle it-

add the beaten whites of the eggs, stirring well. Flavor with 
whatever is best liked — lemon, orange, raspberry, or currant. 
Bottle for use, and when wanted put two tablespoonfuls into a 
tumbler of water, adding as much carbonats of soda as will lie 
on a sixpence. 

1168. DISTILLED WATER. 

This, the purest state of water, may be readily obtained by 
fixing a curved tin tube, three or four feet long, to the spout of 
a tea-kettle, and conducting its free end into a jar placed in a 
basin of cold water, and enveloped with a wet towel. The softer 
the water is, the better solvent it is of all soluble animal and 
vegetable substances ; hence Distilled Water, being free from 
any foreign ingredients, is necessarily the softest of all water, 
and consequently it is well adapted not only for diluting in 
febrile affections, but for pervading the minutest vessels, and 
improvingtheir secreting powers. Distilled water is mawkish 
to the taste; this is easily corrected by pouring it from one jug 
to another, successively, for ten or fifteen minutes, so as to in- 
volve in it a quantity of atmospheric air. 

1169. GOOSEBERRY, 0X7RRA1TT, RASPBERRY, AND 
STRAWBERRY "WATERS. 

Mash either of the fruits when ripe, and press out the juice 
through a hair sieve ; add a little water to it, and give it a boil ; 
then filter it through a flannel bag ; some syrup, a little lemon 
juice and water to make it palatable, but rich, although not too 
sweet, which is often a fault with these and compotes. Ice 
them the same as wine, ailtl serve. 



3i6 MRS. Clarke's cookery book. Beverages. 

1170. HHUBAIIB WATEH. — Ingredients — Some sticks of rhu- 
barb, a quart of water, sugar and lemon juice. 

Cut up the rhubarb (about six or eight sticks, but it depends 
on their length), without peeling them. Put them in a stewpan, 
add tiie water and boil for quarter of an hour. Then strain 
into a jug and add the sugar and lemon juice. When cool it is 
fit for use. 

1171. "WHITE CTJRHAITT COHDIAL— Ingredients— l quart 
of whiskey or brandy, 1 pt. cua-ant juice. 1 lb. >vhite sugar, 
i of an ounce of ginger (poundefl), and the rind of 1 lemon.

then filter through blotting paper. 

1172. A STUONG CORDIAL. — Ingredients — 1 quart each of 
peppermint water and rectified spirits of wine, 1 lb. of lump 
sugar. 

Melt the sugar in the peppermint water and add the spirits of 
wine. 

1173. SEIDLIT2 POWDERS. 

Two drams of tartarized soda, and two scruples of bicarbon- 
ate of soda for the blue packet, and thirty grains of tartaric 
acid for the white paper. 

1174. EFFERVESCIITG SALUTE DRAUGHTS. 

White sugar powdered, eight ounces; tartaric acid two ounces; 
sesquicarbonate of soda, two ounces ; essence of lemon, a few 
drops. Mix well, and keep in a corked bottle. 

1175. CIDER. 

For making this agreeablebeverage, take red-streaked pip- 
pins, pearmains, gennetings, golden pippins, &c., when they 
are so ripe that they may be shaken from the tree with toler- 
able ease ; bruise or grind them very small, and when reduced 
to a mash, put them into a hair bag, and squeeze them out by 
degrees : next put the liquor, strained through a fine hair sieve, 
into a cask well matched : then mash the pulp with a little 
warm water, adding a fourth part, when pressed out, to the 
cider. To make it work kindly, heat a little honey, three 
whites of eggs, and a little flour, together : put them into a fine 
rag, and let them hang down by a string to the middle of the • 
cider cask : then put in a pint of new ale yeast pretty warm, 
and let it clear itself from dross five or six days ; after which 
draw it off from the lees into smaller casks or bottles, as you 
think proper. If you bottle it take care to leave the liquor an 
inch short of the corks, lest the bottles burst by the fermenta- 



Beterages. MRS. Clarke's cookery book. 317 

tion. Should any such danger exist, you may perceive it by 
the hissing of the air through the corks ; when it will be neces- 
sary to open them, to let out the fermenting air. Apples of a 
better taste produce the strongest cider ; but you must observe 
never to mix summer and winter fruit together. 

1176. CUZmAlTT AlTD EASFBEEET STEI7F. 

Take eight pounds of very ripe currants, red and white ; pick 
off all the stalks, and put them into a wide earthen pan ; then 
take them up in handfuls and squeeze them till the juice is all 
crushed out of them, which will take some time. Leave them 
in the pan with the juice for twenty-four hours. Put two 
pounds of raspberries in a saucepan with two teacupfuls of 
water, and boil them for a few minutes till they are all crushed. 
Then pass all the currants and raspberries through a hair-sieve, 
pressing them with a wooden spoon to extract all the juice. If 
the juice should be very thick, pass it also through a jelly-bag. 
Weigh the juice, and for every pound of it put two pounds of 
loaf-sugar, broken into large pieces. Put the sugar into a pre- 
serving ^an with one pint of water ; pour all the juice on it. 
Let it boil for half an hour, stirring frequently ; then put it into 
small bottles, and cork it for use. Two tablespoonfuls in a 
tumbler of water make a very refreshing drink in summer. 
Cherry-syrup may be made in the same way with Morella 
cherries. 

1177. SAESAFAEILZiA (simple decoction).— Ingredients— 
5 oz. of sarsaparilla chips, 4 pints of water. 

Digest the chips in the water, let it simmer gently for two 
hours ; take out the chips, bruise and replace them in the water; 
boil down to two pints and strain. 

1178. SAESAFAEILLA (compound decoction). 

This is made by adding to the above quantity while boiling, 
sassafras (sliced), quaiacum wood (rasped), and liquorice-root 
(bruised), of each ten drachms. Meyereon roots, three drachms. 
Roil for fifteen minutes and strain. 



V^INES Sl brandies. 



The high price of foreign wine renders the making good 
wine an object of no mean importance in domestic economy, 
and many excellent wines may be made with very little 
trouble, and at a trifling expense. Every person who 
possesses an extensive garden will find it more advanta- 
geous to use their surplus fruit for making wine, than to 
dispose of it by sale. 

The process of wine-making is by no means so trouble- 
some or laborious as brewing ; and wine, when well made, 
will keep almost any length of time : indeed age, instead of 
deteriorating, adds to its goodness; and very good domestic 
wines may be made at a trifling expense. 



1179. BOTTLINa OP "WINB. 

The secret of bottling wine with success consists in the 
simple exercise of care and cleanliness. The bottles should be 
all sound, clean, and dry, and perfectly free from the least 
mustiness or other odor. The corks should be of the best 
quality, and immediately before being placed in the bottles 
should be compressed by means of a " cork squeezer." For 
superior or very delicate wines, the corks are usually prepared 
by placing them in a tub or copper, covering them with 
weights to keep them down, and then pouring over them boil- 
ino' water, holding a little pearlash in solution. In this state 
they are allowed to remain for twenty-four hours, when they 
are drained and re-immersed for a second twenty-four hours in 
hot water, after which they are well washed and soaked in 
several successive portions of clean rain-water, drained, dried 
out of contact with dust, put into paper bags, and hung up in 
a dry place for use. The wine should be clear and brilliant, 
and if it be not so, it must undergo the process of " fining " 
before being bottled. Ln fact, it is a common practice with some 
persons to perform this operation whether the wine requires it 
or not ; as, if it has been mixed and doctored, it " amalgamates 
and ameliorates the various flavors." The bottles, corks, and 

318

wine being ready, a fine clear day should be preferably chosen 
for bottling, and the utmost cleanliness and care should be 
exercised during the process. Great caution should also be 
observed to avoid shaking the cask so as to disturb the bottoms. 
The remaining portion that cannot be drawn off clear should 
be passed through the *' wine-bag," and when bottled should 
be set apart as inferior to the rest. The coopers, to prevent 
breakage and loss, place each bottle, before corking it, in a 
small bucket, having a bottom made of soft cork. They thus 
seldom break a bottle, though they "flog" in the corks very 
hard. When the wine is all bottled it is stored in a cool cellar, 
and on no account on the bottles' bottoms, or in damp straw, 
but on their sides, in sweet dry sawdust or sand. 

1180. TO REPINE LIQUORS. 

Dissolve two ounces in one quart of cider, beer, or wine ; it 
should not be boiled, though warmed sufficient to dissolve it ; 
put in when dissolved into a barrel of the liquor, where it 
should be well stirred, and when clear racked off. It should 
be put into cider as soon as it is drawn from the press, and 
should be racked as soon as clear; if it be not racked off at a 
proper time, a fixed air will form and cause the sediment to 
mingle again with the whole mass. 

1181. PALSIPIBD "WIITB. 

One of the chief means of disguising a falsified wine is the 
use of various coloring-matters, which are now offered every- 
wherer in France by private trade circulars. Public attention has 
been directed to this in Paris ; and it is stated that although chem- 
istry is powerless to discover the presence of these dyes, there 
nevertheless exists a simple means of detecting them which 
cannot be too widely known. Some of the wine must be heated ; 
and, when it boils, a piece of white flannel should be well 
dipped in it and allowed to dry. If the flannel, when washed, 
still retains a red or reddish tinge, it is stated to be proof 
positive that the color of the wine has been artificially obtained. 

1182. TO MULL "WINB. 

Boil some spice in a little water till the flavor is gained, then 
add an equal quantity of port, sugar and nutmeg to taste ; boil 
together and serve with crisp toast. 

1183. Another "Way- 

Boil a small piece of cinnamon and some grated nutmeg a 
few minutes in a large cupful of water, then pour to it a pint of 
port wine, adding sugar to taste, heat it up and it will be ready 
to serve. British wine can be used in place of port if desired. 



320 MRS. Clarke's cookery book. Wines, &c. 

1184. ZiSMOU ^TTITE- — Ingredients — One gal. water, 3 lbs. of 
powdered loaf sugar, rinds of 4 lemons, juice of the lemons, J 
lb. sugar, 1 slice of toast, yeast. 

Add the sugar to the water,boiling twenty minutes, skimming 
well, pare the rinds of the lemons very thin, squeeze out all the 
juice of the lemons and mix with the sugar ; boil until it be- 
comes a thick syrup ; add it to the water and rinds, and when 
the whole is just lukewarm put in a slice of toast covered on 
both sides with yeast. Allow it to work in an open tub two 
days, then put it into a cask. Let it stand three minutes before 
bottling. 

1185. GRAPE WIITE— Ingredients— 20 lbs. of fresh fruit, 1§ 
gals, of water, 10 lbs. of granulated sugar. 

Put the grapes into a crock, pour over the water, which must 
be boiling ; when conveniently cool, press well with the hands. 
Let it remain three days on the pomace covered over with a 
cloth. Then squeeze out all the juice and add the sugar. Leave 
for a week longer in the crock. Then remove the scum. Strain 
and bottle, leaving uncorked until the fermentation is over. 
Then strain and rebottle, corking tight. Place the bottles on 
their sides in a cool place. 

1186. GRAPE ^INE (2).— Ingredients— To a gallon of bruised 
grapes put a gallon of water ; to a gallon of wine put 3 lbs. 
of sugar. 

Let the fruit and water stand a week, without stirring. Then 
draw it off and add sugar in the above proportion ; put it into 
a vessel, but do not stop it till it has done hissing. 

1187. APRICOT WINE.— Ingredients— 12 lbs. of apricots, 2 gals, 
of water, to every quart of liquor allow 6 oz. of white sugar. 

Wipe, clean and cut the apricots, which must be ripe ; add 
the water and let them boil till the water has thoroughly im- 
bibed the flavor of the fruit ; then strain the liquor through a 
hair sieve ; add the sugar,and boil it again ; skim carefully, and 
when the scum has ceased to rise pour into an eaithen vessel. 
Next day bottle it off, putting a lump of sugar into every 
bottle. 

1188. DAMSON 'WINE.— Ingredients— 8 lbs. of fruit, 1 gallon 
of water ; to every gallon of liquor add 2^ lbs. of good 
mgar. 

Gather the fruit dry, weigh, and bruise them with your hands. 
Boil the water ; then pour it upon your fruit scalding hot, and 
let it stand two days ; then draw it off, put it into a clean 
cask, and add sugar ; fill the cask ; the longer it stands the 



Wines, &c. mrs. clarke's cookery book. 321 

better. It will keep very well a year in the cask. Afterwards 
bottle it off. The small damson is the best. Put a very Bmall 
lumpofl oaf sugjar into every bottle. 

1189. GOOSEBEREY "WINE (l).— Ingredients— One peck of half 

ripe gooseberries, allow 3 lbs. white sugar to a gallon of fruit. 
The Iruit should be gathered in dry weather ; pick and bruise 
them in a tub. Press as much as possible without breaking 
the seeds ; add the sugar and stir until dissolved, then fill a 
cask or vessel with it. Let it stand for a fortnight or three 
weeks, and set in a cool place. Then strain off the sediment; 
leave again for two or three months and then bottle. 

1190. GOOSEBEHHY "WINE (2).— Ingredients— Six lbs. of green 

gooseberries to every gallon of water, 3 lbs. of white sugar. 
The gooseberries must be green {twt ripe) and must be per- 
fectly sound. Top and tail them, place in a tub and bruise 
them. Be particular that every berry is broken, but do not 
crush the seeds ; warm the water and pour on the fruit. Now 
press and squeeze it to a pulp ; cover fur a day and a night. 
Meantime prepare a coarse bag, and at the end of the stated 
time strain through it, extracting ^/Z the juice. Put into a tub, 
add the sugar, stir until it is dissolved and set in a warm place; 
keep it closely covered, allowing it to ferment for two days. At 
the end of that time draw into clean casks, tilt them a little 
on one side, and when the scum has settled, remove it and fill 
with the remaining juice. As soon as the fermentation has 
stopped, plug the casks upright, filling a third time, if needful, 
put the bungs in loosely and when the fermentation is over 
drive the bungs in tightly, and a small hole made to give vent. 
After six months draw off from the dregs into casks rinsed 
with brandy. Allow to stand a month, then examine, and if 
clear, bottle, if not, clear with one ounce of isinglass to eight 
gallons of wine. 

1191. GIITGBR ^IITE.— Ingredients— 7 qts. of water, 6 lbs. of 
sugar, 2 oz of the best ginger, bruised, and the rinds of 3 
good-sized lemons, boiled together ; J lb. of raisins, 1 spoonful 
of yeast, \ oz. of isinglass, ^ pint of brandy. 

When lukewarm, put the whole into a cask, with the juice of 
the lemons, and the raisins ; add the yeast, and stir the wine 
every day for ten days. When the fermentation has ceased, 
add the isinglass and brandy ; bung close, and in two months 
,t will be fit to bottle. 

1192. OHERRT WIITE.— Ingredients— To every gallon of liquor 

2 lbs of coarse sugar. 
Pull oft the stalks of cherries, and wash the latter without 



323 MRS. Clarke's cookery book. Wines, &c. 

breaking the stones ; press it hard through a hair bag, and let 
it work as long as it makes a noise in the vessel ; stop it up 
close for a month or more, and when it is fine, draw it into 
dry bottles. If it makes them fly, open them all for a moment, 
and stop them up again. It will be fit to drink in three mon: 

1193. STONE'S PATENT RHUBAEB "WINE.— Ingredients 
To every gallon of liquor, 3 lbs. of white sugar. 

When the green stalks or stems of the rhubarb plant are ar- 
rived at their full size, which will generally be about the middle 
of the month of May, pluck them ; then cut off the leaves and 
throw them away ; bruise the stalks in a large mortar, or other 
convenient vessel, so as to reduce them to a pulp ; put the 
pulp into an open vat or tub, and to every five pounds' weight 
of the pulp, add one gallon of cold spring water. Let it infuse 
for three days, stirring it three or four times a day. On the 
fourth Jay press the pulp in the usual manner, and strain off 
the liquor, which place in an open vat or tub, and to every 
gallon of the liquor add three pounds of white sugar, stirring it 
until the sugar is quite dissolved ; then let it rest, and in from 
four to six days the fermentation will begin to subside, and a 
crust or head will be formed, which is to be skimmed off, or 
the liquor drawn from it, just when the crust or head begins 
to crack or separate ; then put the wine into a cask, but do not 
then stop it down. If it should begin to ferment in the cask, 
rack it into another cask ; in about a fortnight stop down the 
cask, and let it remain till the beginning of the month of 
March in the next year, then rack it, and again stop down the 
cask ; but if, from continued slight fermentation in the cask, 
the wine then should have lost any of its original sweetness, 
put into the racked wine a sufficient quantity of loaf sugar to 
sweeten it, and stop down the cask, taking care in all cases 
that the cask should be full. In a month or six weeks it will 
be fit to bottle, and in the summer to drink ; but the wine will 
be improved by remaining a year or more in the rack after it 
has been racked. The plant in the autumn will produce a 
second crop, when another quantity of wine can be made. 

1194. RHTTBARB OHAMPA&NE.— Ingredients— To every lb. 

of bruised rhubarb stalks add 1 qt. of cold spring water ; to 

every gallon of the juice add 2^ lbs. of white sugar, and to 10 

gals, allow a bottle of pale brandy, 1 oz. isinglass. 

Pnt the rhubarb in the water, and let it stand three days, 

stirring twice a day. Then press and strain it through a siev^e, 

and to every gallon of the juice add two and a half pounds 

of loaf sugar, barrel it, and to ten gallons allow a bottle of pale 



Wines, &c. mrs. Clarke's cookery book. 323 

brandy. Put the isinglass in a muslin bag, and suspend it in the 
barrel by a string. When it has ceased fermenting fasten up 
the barrel closely. It will be ready to bottle in six months. 
Some black or red currant juice added improves the color. 

1195. BLACKBEHRY WllTB. — Ingredients — Some ripe black- 
berries, boiling water sufficient to cover them, to 10 quarts of 
liquor allow 1 lb. of sugar, 4 oz. of isinglass, 1 pint of white 
wine. 

Put the berries into a large vessel of wood or stone with a 
tap to it ; pour on the boiling water as above directed, and, as 
soon as the heat will permit, bruise well with the hand ; let it 
stand closely covered till all the berries begin to rise to the 
top, which will take place in three or four days, then draw 
off the clear part into another vessel, add the sugar and stir 
well; leave to stand for a week or ten days, then draw off 
through a jelly bag. Lay the isinglass in the wine to steep for 
twelve hours, the nextm">rning boil it on a slow fire till dis- 
solved, then take a gallon of the blackberry juice, put in the 
dissolved isinglass, boil them together, pour all into the vessel, 
and let it stand a few days to purge and settle ; draw it off, and 
keep it in a cool place. 

1196. RAISIIT ^IITE- — Ingredients— To every gallon of spring 
water allow 8 lbs. of good raisins, brandy of the finest quality. 

Stir the fruit and water in a large tub every day for a month ; 
then press the raisins in a horsehair bag as dry as possible ; 
put the liquor into a cask, and when it has done hissing pour 
in a bottle of the best brandy ; stop it close for twelve months; 
then rack it off, but without the dregs ; filter them through a 
bag of flannel of three or four folds, add the clear to the quan- 
tity, and pour one or two quarts of brandy according to the size 
of the vessel. Stop it up, and at the end of three years you 
may either bottle it or drink it from the cask. Raisin wine 
would be extremely good if made rich of the fruit, and kept 
long, which improves the flavor greatly. 

1197. FAMILT WINE (Excellent)— Ingredients— Equal pro- 
portions of black, red, and white currants, ripe cherries (black 
hearts are the best), raspberries. To each gal. of the liquor 
3 Van. of sugar ; lastly, to every 9 gals. 1 quart of good Cog- 
nac brandy. 

To four lbs. of the mixed fruit, well bruised, put one gallon 
of clear soft water ; steep three days and nights, in open ves- 
sels, frequently stirring up the ma^^ma ; then strain through a 
hair sieve, press the residuary pulp to dryness, and add its 
juice to the former ; in each gallon of the mixed liquors dis- 



324 MRS CLARKE'S COOKERY BOOK. WiNES, &C. 

solve tbree pounds of good sugar ; let the solutron stand 
another three days and nights, frequently skimming and stir- 
ring it up ; then turn it into casks, which should remain full, 
and purging at the bung-hole, about two weeks. Lastly, to 
every nine gallons put in the above proportion of brandy, and 
bung down. 

*;!,* If it does not soon become fine, a steeping of isinglass 
may be stirred into the liquid, in the proportion of about half 
an ounce to nine gallons. The addition of one ounce of cream 
of tartar to each gallon of the fermentable liquor improves the 
quality of the wine, and makes it resemble more nearly the 
produce of the grape. 

11 98. BLAOZ OR WHITE ELDER "WnTE.— Ingredients— 
To every pint of juice 1^ pints of water, to every gallon of 
this liquor 3 lbs. of good moist sugar, the whites of 4 or 5 
eggs, ale yeast. 

Gather the elder berries ripe and dry, pick them, and bruise 
them with your hands, and S'train them ; set the liquor by in 
glazed earthen vessels for twelve hours to settle ; set in a 
kettle over the fire, and when it is ready to boil clarify it with 
the whites of four or five eggs, let it boil one hour, and when it 
is almost cold work it with strong ale yeast, and tun it, filling 
up the vessel from time to time with the same liquor, saved on 
purpose, as it sinks by working. In a month's time, if the ves- 
sel holds about eight gallons, it will be fine and fit to bottle, 
and, after bottling, will be fit to drink in twelve months : but 
if the vessel be larger it must stand longer in proportion, three 
or four months at least for a hogshead. All liquors must be 
fined before they are bottled, or else they will grow sharp, and 
ferment in the bottles. 

*^* Add to every gallon of this liquid one pint of strong 
mountain wine, but not such as has the borachio, or nag's skin 
flavor. This wine will be very strong and pleasant. 

1199. RASPBERRY "WIITB (l).— Ingredients— To 1 qt. of picked 

raspberries allow 1 qt. of water; to a gallon of fruit adow 3 
lbs. of white sugar. 

Pour the water on the fruit, bruise them and let them stand 
for two days ; strain off the liquor and the sugar ; when dis- 
solved put the liquor into a barrel, and when fine, which will 
be in about two months, bottle it, and to each bottle put a 
spoonful of brandy, or a glass of wine. 

1200. RASPBERRY TJ7I1TE (2).— Ingredients— Fruit; to a quart 
of juice allow 1 lb. of sugar, and 2 qts. of white wine. 

Bruise the raspberries with a spoon, and strain into a stone 



Wines, &c. mrs, clarke's cookery book. 325 

vessel; add the sugar, stirring well together, and cover closely; 
let it stand three days and then strain off clear. Add the 
white wine and bottle. 

1201. RASPBBERT AND OTrilRA.lTT WINE. -Ingredients- 

Allow a qt. of water to every 3 pta. of fruit; to a qt. of liquor 

add 1 lb. of sugar. 
Bruise the fruit (after carefully removing any that are bad 
or mouldy), adding the water ; let it stand a day, then strain 
and add the sugar ; leave again for three or four days, remov- 
ing the scum as it rises. Then bottle it. 

1202. BLACK OTJERAITT TJ^ITE— Ingredients— Allow equal 
quantities of juice and water, to every 3 qts. of liquor add 3 
lbs. of pure moist sugar, 3 qts. of brandy to 40 of wine. 

Put it into a cask, preserving a little for filling up ; put the cask 
into a warm, dry room and the liquor will ferment of itself ; skim 
oflfthe refuse when the fermentition shall be over, and fill up 
with the reserved liquor; when it has ceased working, pour in 
brandy. Bung it close for nine months, then bottle it, and drain 
the thick part through a je!ly-bag, until it be clear, and bottle 
that. Keep it ten or twelve months. 

1203. ORAITGE ^INE.— Ingredients — To make 9 gals, take 11 

gallons of soft water, in which boil the whites of 30 eggs, 200 
oranges, 40 lemons, and 30 Seville oranges, should they be 
preferred to the lemons, 30 lbs. of white sugar. If required, 
ferment with ^ pt. of yeast, 1 gal. to 1^ of French brandy. 

Pare the fruit as thin as possible, and upon the parings pour 
the water, boiling. Upon this juice, having stood ten or twelve 
hours, and being strained, run the expressed juice of the or- 
anges and lemons, adding the sugar ; if required, ferment with 
half a pint of yeast four or five days, when the wine may be 
casked, and brandy added, when the fermentation subsides. 
Some substitute sherry, but it is inferior to brandy, and gives 
an alien flavor to orange wine ; bung down closely, but watch 
the process of fermentation ; in six months it 'will be perfectly 
fine, this wine being less liable to remain turbid than any of 
our other wines. By the directions already given a wine from 
any fruit may be made, observing that the more sugar is used, 
the longer time it will require to complete the vinous fermen- 
tation. 

1204. IdALT ^IITE.— Ingredients— To 28 lbs. of sugar allow 5 
gals, of water, 6 qts. each of sweet-wort and tuu, 2^ lbs. of 
raisins, 10 oz. of candy, 1 pt. of brandy. 

Mix the sugar and water and simmer for a quarter of an hour, 
skan well and pour the liquor into a tub ; set aside to cool, 
21 



326 MRS. Clarke's cookery book. Wines, &c. 

then mix in the sweet-wort and tun ; allow to stand undisturbed 
for three days, then put into a barrel to allow it to ferment for 
another three days. Bung the cask and keep for two or three 
months ; at the end of this time add the raisins, brandy and 
candy, and in five or six months time bottle the wine. 

1205. ORAITGE BRANDY.— Ingredients-Chips of 18 Seville 
oranges, 3 qts. of brandy, 2 qts. of spring water, 1^ lbs. of 
white sugar, the white of an egg. 

Put the orange chips in the brandy, let them steep a fort- 
night in a stone bottle stopped close ; boil the water with the 
sugar, gently for an hour, clarify the water and the sugar with 
the white of an egg, then stram it through a jelly-bag and 
boil it nearly half away; when cold strain the brandy into the 
syrup. 

1206. LEMON BRANDY.— Ingredients— Five qts. of water to 
1 gal. of brandy, 2 doz. lemons, 2 Iba. of the best sugar, and 
3 pints of milk. 

Pare the lemons thin, steep the peel in the brandy twelve 
hours, and squeeze the lemons upon the sugar ; then put the 
water to it and mix all the ingredients together. Boil the 
milk and pour it in hot. Let it stand twenty-four hours and 
then strain it. 

1207. CHERRY BRANDY (Excellent) (i).— Ingredients-To 

every lb. of Morella cherries allow J lb. sugar, brandy 
The cherries for this purpose must not be too ripe and should 
be fresh ; remove the stalks, and place into your bottles(which 
must be quite dry) and add sugar; when you have filled your 
bottles with the cherries and sugar, cover with brandy ; cork 
and tie a bladder over. Be careful not to put too much sugar, 
or the cherries will become very hard. Whiskey is a very good 
substitute for brandy. 

1208. CHERRY BRANDY (2).— Ingredients — Eight lbs. of 
cherries, a gallon of the best brandy. 

Stone the cherries, and add to them the brandy ; bruise the 
stones in a mortar and add them to the cherries and brandy. 
Cover close and leave for six weeks ; then pour off clear from 
the sediment and bottle. This makes a rich cordial. Some 
prefer the fruit bruised instead of being whole. 

1209. OARA'^AT BRiiNDY— Ingredients— One oz. of cara- 
way seeds, 6 oz. of white sugar, 1 qt. of brandy. 

Steep the caraway seeds and sugar in the brandy; let it 
stand nine days, then draw it off and it will make an eJ^cellent 
eordi^l, 



SICK ROOM COOKERY. 



There is sickness everywhere, and as it falls to the lot of 
most women at some time in their lives to be nurse or cook 
for the sick, a few hints may be useful. Every woman with 
a tender, loving heart, no matter what her position, will try 
in such a case to tempt the appetite of the afflicted with her 
own delicate cookinp^ and serving, the result being in many 
cases, returning health, and in any case having the satisfac- 
tion of knowing you have done what you could. An anony- 
mous writer says : — 

'• Invalids soon realize their dependence on others. I will 
say this much to every family that has an invalid charge, be 
kind to them ; don't be always reminding them of expenses ; 
do not make them feel that they are a burden to you. God 
sends the affliction upon them. They would not be a burden 
to you if they could help i' . and I believe when the final day of 
judgment comes, the great Ruler of the Universe will deal with 
you as you have dealt with the sick ones. And with many the 
sentence will be, " Ye knew your duty, but you did it not." It 
is said " No physician ever weighed out medicine to his patient 
with half so much exactness and care as God weighed out to us 
every trial ; not one grain too much does He ever permit to be 
put in the scale." It is hard for us to feel that our afflictions 
are sent to us for some wise purpose. Our burdens seem more 
than we can bear, and it is still harder for us to say " Thy will 
not»mine, be done." Be kind to the sick ones ; their lot in life 
is hard enough. Throw a ray of sunshine across their path. 
There are a thousand and one ways that you can brighten their 
lives, by a little attention. There are many waj's we could make 
others happy if we only would try, and we would be so much 
happier ourselves. Just think of the poor invalid that is con- 
fined to the house, seeing the same things day after day (yes, 
and often year after year), until they know every seam in the 
carpet, every flower on the wall-^yes, every spot on the furni- 
ture. Their eyes will ache from the very sameness, and they 
feel that it would be a blessing to close them in utter oblivion.

It ought to be not only a pleasure, but a stern duty for us to light- 
en their burdens and make life bearable to them." 

In preparing dishes for the sick, it is needful to combine 
the strongest nourishment with the simplest seasoning, as 
they require food which will not need too much exertion of 
the digestive power. Sweet-breads, broiled to a nice brown; 
oysters roasted in the shell, or plainly stewed ; clam broth, 
and even calves' brains, are highly recommended as articles 
of diet, which will give the most nutritious food in the small- 
est quantities. All kinds of gruel are unpalatable to some 
persons, but fortunately, tastes differ, and there are those 
who will take with a decided relish large bowlfuls of flour, 
oatmeal, and even Indian-meal porridge. Groats, however, 
are considered the most delicate of all such preparations, 
and if well made, and flavored with a tablespoonful of old 
Jamaica or whisky, with a little sugar added to it, it is not a 
disagreeable compound. 

Never set before the sick a large quantity of food ; tempt 
with a very small portion delicately cooked and tastefully 
served. If not eaten directly, remove from the sick room 
without delay, as no food should be allowed to stand there. 
Do not give the same food often, as variety is charming. 
Never keep the sick waiting, always have something in 
readiness — a little jelly, beef tea, stewed fruit, gruel, etc. 
It will be found more tempting to serve any of these in 
glasses. If much milk is used, keep it on ice. Let all in- 
valid cookery be simple ; be careful to remove every particle 
of fat from broth or beef-tea before servmg. 

The best diet for brain workers who take proper care of 
their health is brown bread, cream, fresh butter, oatmeal, 
fresh cheese (if it agrees), eggs, fish, and a moderate amount 
of meat. Oysters may be used freely in their season, and 
fruits should not be omitted. There should be variety and 
change as flie season and health require. The diet should 
be varied in kind and form quite frequently, though not 
necessarily every day. Even in health, the best viands 
when continued from day to day become unpalatable, and 
even nauseous. An occasional change of diet, in short, is 
indispensable to a proper relish for food, and the mainten- 
ance of the appetite and good health.

1210. VEAL BBOTH- — Ingredients — One and a half lbs. of veal, 1 

doz. sweet almonds, a qt. of spring water, a little salt, 1 pt. 

of boiling water. 

Remove all the fat from the veal, and simmer c^ently in the 

spring water till it is reduced to a pint ; blanch and pound the 

aimonds till they are a smooth pa'^te, then pour over them the 

boiling water very slowly, stirring all the time till it is as 

smooth as milk ; strain both the almond and veal liquors 

thrnugh a fine sieve and mix well together, and add the salt and 

boil up again. 

12il. OHIOKEIT LHOTH— Ingredients— An old fowl, 3 pints of 

water, a pinch of salt, a blade of mace, 6 or 8 peppercorns, a 

very small chopped onion, a few sprigs of sweet herbs. 

Cut up the fowl and put it, bones as well, in a saucepan 

with the water, salt, mace, pepnercorns, onion and sweet 

herbs ; let it simmer very gently till the meat is very tender, 

which will take about three hours, skimming well during the 

time. Strain carefully and set aside to cool. 

1212. EGG BEiOTH. — Ingredients — An egg, \ pint of good un- 
favored veal or mutton broth quite hot, salt, toast. 

Beat the egg well in a broth basin ; when frothy add the 
broth, salt to taste, and serve with toast. 

1213. EEL BItOTH> — Ingredients — Half lb. of small eels, 3 pints 
of water, some parsley, 1 slice of onion, a few peppercorns, 
salt to taste. 

Clean the eels and set them on the fire with the water, par- 
sley, onion, and peppercorns ; let them simmer till the eels are 
broken and the broth good. Add salt to taste and strain. 
These ingredients should make about a pint and a half of 
broth. 

1214. BEEP BROTH (1) — ingredients— One lb. of good lean beef, 
2 qts. of cold water \ a teacup of tapioca, a small piece of 
parsley, an onion if liked, pepper and salt. 

Soak the tapioca onehour,cut in small pieces the beef, put in 
a stewpan the above proportion of water, boil slowly (keeping 
well covered) one and a ha;f hours, then add the tapioca, and 
boil half an hour longer. Some add with the tapioca a small 
piece of parsley, and a slice or two of onion ; strain before 
serving, seasoning slightly with pepper and salt. It is more 
strengthening to add, just before serving, a soft poached egg. 
Rice may be used instead of tapioca, straining the broth, and 
adding one or two tablespoons ol rice (soaked for a short timej, 
and then boiling hah an hour. 



330 MRS. CLARKE'S COOKERY BOOK. SiCK RoOM 

1215. BEEP BROTH (2).— Ingredients— One and a half lbs. of 
finely -mincetl beef, I qt. of cold water, a little salt, and 2oz. 
of rice or barley. 

Simmer for four hours, then boil for ten minutes, strain, 
skim off the fat and serve. 

1216. SCOTCH BUOTH — ingredients — The liquor in which a leg 
of mutton, piece of beef or old fowl has been boiled, barley, 
vegetables chopped small, a cap of rough oatmeal mixed in 
cold water, salt and pepper to taste. 

Add to the liquor some barley and vegetables, chopped 
small, in sufficient quantity to make the broth quite thick. 
The necessary vegetables are carrots, turnips, onions, and 
cabbafj;e, but any others may be added ; old (not parched) 
peas and celery are good additions. When the vegetables are 
boiled tender add the oatmeal to the broth, salt and pepper 
to taste. This very plain preparation is genuine Scotch broth 
as served in Scotland ; with any coloring or herbs, etc., added, 
it is not real Scotch broth. It is e.xtremely palatable and 
wholesome in its plain form. 

1217. HAST7 BUOTH' —Ingredients — A bone or two of a neck 
or loin of mutton, f pt. of water, a piece of thyme, some 
parsley, a slice of onion. 

Remove the fat and skin from the meat, set it on the fire in 
a small tin saucepan that has a lid, with the water, the meat 
being first beaten and cut into pieces ; add the seasoning. Let 
it boil rapidly, skim it nicely ; take off the cover if likely to be 
too weak. Half an hour is sufficient to make it in. 

1218. BROTH (a Splendid Broth for 'Weakness).— Ingre- 
dients — 2 lbs. of loin of mutton, a large handful of chervil, 
2 qts. of v\ ater. 

Boil the meat with the chervil in the water till reduced to 
one quart. Take otf part of the fat. Any other herbs or roots 
may be added. Take half a pint three or four times a day. 

1219. BROTH (Beef, Mutton and Veal).— Ingredients— 2 lbs. of 

lean beef. 1 lb scrag of veal, 1 lb. of scrag of mutton, some 
sweet herbs, 10 peppercorns, 5 qts. of water, 1 onion. 
Put the meat, sweet herbs, and peppercorns into a nice tin 
saucepan, with the water, and simmer till reduced to three 
quarts. Remove the fat when cold. Add the onion, if ap- 
proved. 

1220. CALVES' FEET BROTH. — Ingredients — Two calves' 
feet, 3^ qis. of water, a large teacupf ul of jelly, ^ glass of 



Cookery. Mrs. clarke's cookery book. 331 



sweet wine, a little sugar, nutmeg, yolk of 1 egg, a piece of 
butter the size of a nutmeg, a piece of fresh lemon peel. 
Boil the calves' feet in the water, strain and put aside ; when 
to be used take off the fat, put the jelly into a saucepan with 
the wine, sugar and nutmeg ; beat it up till it is ready to boil, 
then take a little of it and beat gradually to the yolk of egg, 
and adding the butter, stir all together, but don't let it boil. 
Grate the lemon peel into it. 

1221. BEEP TEA (Simplest "Way of Making.) 

Cut the beef into very small pieces, and take away all the 
fat. Put it into a stone jar with a pint of water to each pound 
cf beef ; tie a double piece of brown paper over the top, and set 
the jar in a cool oven for several hours. Strain the beef tea off 
through a rather coarse strainer, and while it is hot take off 
every speck of fat with paper. If it is wanted stronger, put only 
half that amount of water. Should an oven be not obtainable, 
it will do equally well to place the jar in a large saucepan of 
boiling water ; but it will not do to cook it in a metal saucepan 
without ajar, because an invalid's palate is very sensitive, and 
the tea is sure to acquire an unpleasant flavor. If in the place 
of lean beef some beef bones are used, the tea will become a 
jelly when cold ; it will be less costly and less good. Any sort 
of flavoring may be added to it. A scrap of lemon-peel, a clove, 
a grate of nutmeg, a sprig of any sweet herb, or of parsley, put 
into the jar before cooking, will, any one of them, make a 
pleasant change, and a little ingenuity will soon increase the 
list. Such changes are grateful to a convalescent patient, and 
break the monotony of his life. However, a patient not decided- 
ly convalescent needs nothing but beef and water, often not 
even salt. It is a lengthy process this ;and, if time is wanting 
to carry it out, twenty minutes is quite sufficient to set a cup of 
good beef tea on the table. First of all, prepare half a pint of 
the following 

1222. MEAT JITZCE. 

Scrape with a knife, because no cutting divides it finely 
enough, half a pound of beef steak, and remove all the fat and 
skin. Put it into a basin with half a pint ot tepid water, and 
let it stand fifteen minutes or longer. The result is what is 
commonly known as raw beef tea or meat-juice, every year more 
widely used as a restorative for infants as well as adults in cases 
of wasting or acute disease. Its appearance is against it, but 
the taste is simply that of any cold beef tea. Children gener- 
ally take it without difficulty ; but adults, unless they are too 



332 MRS. Clarke's cookery book. Sick Room 

weak to have an opinion on the point, have often an insur- 
mountable objection to it. Nothing can then be done but to 
hide it in a colored or covered cup, or to add a little Liebig's 
Extract to conceal the color. The meat -juice is often prepared 
with hydrochloric acid, adding four drops to each pint of water > 
but we think the above recipe simpler, safer, and more suited 
for general use. Meat -juice is easier to assimilate than any 
form of cooked beef tea, and it is the only sort that may at all 
times be safely giver to very young infants. It has saved 
many lives, especiall) hose of rickety and wasted children and 
typhoid patients, and it seems right that everyone should know 
how to set about making it But, to return to our 

1223. QUICKLY MADE BEEF TEA. 

Take the above juice and meat together, and put it on a slow 
fire. Let it boil for not longer than five minutes, strain it and 
it is ready for use. If it has been carefully scraped there will 
be no fat upon it, but if there should be some it can easily be 
removed with paper. Salt must be added to taste. 

1224. Another Quick LlethoA- 

Scrape the beef as before, and remember that it is useless to 
put in gristle or sinew, because in none of these quick methods 
is there sufficient time to cook it. Set the meat over a very 
slow fire without water for a quarter of an hour, then add warm 
water and simmer for half an hour or longer. 

1225. BEEP TEA OTTSTARD. 

This may be served alone either hot or cold, or a few small 
pieces can be put in a cup of beef tea, which is thus transferred 
into a kind of soupe royale. Beat up an egg in a cup, add a 
small pinch of salt, and enough strong beef tea to half fillthe cup; 
butter a tiny mould and pour in the mixture. Steam it for 
twenty minutes, and turn it out in a shape. 

1226. SAVOB.Y BEEP TEA —Ingredients — 3 lbs. of beef 
chopped up finely, 3 leeks, 1 onion with 6 cloves stuck into 
it, 1 small carrot, a little celery seed, a small bunch of herbs, 
consisting of thyme, marjoram, and parsley, 1 teaspoonful of 
salt, half a teacupful of mushroom ketchup, and 3 pints of 
water. 

Prepare according to the directions given in the first recipe. 

1227. MTJSH. 

Put some water or milk into a pot and bring it to boil, then 
let the corr meal out of one hand gently into the milk or water, 



Cookery. mrs. clarke's cookery book. 333 

and keep stirring with the other until you have got it into a 
pretty stiff state; after which let it stand ten minutes era 
quarter of an hour or less, or even only one minute, and then 
take it out, and put it into a dish or bowl. This sort of half- 
pudding, half-porridge, you eat either hot or cold, with a little 
salt or without it. It is eaten without any liquid matter, but 
the general way is to have a basin of milk, and taking a lump 
of the mush you put it into the milk, and eat the two together. 
Here is an excellent pudding, whether eaten with milk or with- 
out it ; and where there is no milk it is an excellent substitute 
for bread, whether you take it hot or cold. It is neither hard 
nor lumpy when cold, but quite light and digestible for the most 
feeble stomachs. 

1228. POT^L (SteWOdL in "barley)-— ingredients— One chicken, 
i lb. of pearl barley, enough milk to cover the barley, only a 
Uttle salt, a bunch of sweet herbs. 

Truss the chicken as for boiling; place it in a stewpan with 
the well-washed barley; sprinkle a little salt in and the sweet 
herbs ; enough milk to cover the barley ; put it on the fire, and 
let it stew very slowly, continue to add milk as it boils awav, 
so that the barley maybe always covered, but not the chicken, 
which should be dressed only by the steam from the milk. A 
small bird will take about three hours. When done serve with 
the milk and barley round it. 

122a. VEGETABLS MAaE.O'W (Stuffed).— Ingredients— One 
marrow, some mince of either veal or chicken, bread crumbs, 
good gravy. 

Take a good-sized marrow, boil until tender, halve length- 
ways ; remove the seeds, and fill the inside with hot mince; 
join the two sides together, place upon a hot dish, sprinkle with 
grated bread crumbs ; set in the oven to brown for a few min- 
utes. Serve with a boat of good gravy. 

1230. LITJTTON OUTLETS (DelioatS).- Ingredients-Two or 
3 small cutlets from the best end of a neck or loin of mutton, 
1 cupful of water or broth, a little salt and a few peppercorns. 

Trim the cutlets very nicely, cut off all the fat, place them 
in a flat dish with enough water or broth to cover them, add 
the salt and peppercorns and allow them to stew gently for two 
hours, carefully skimming off every particle of fat which may 
rise to the top during the process. At the end of this time, 
provided the cutlets have not been allowed to boil fast, they 
will be found extremely tender. Turn them when half done. 



334 MRS. Clarke's cookery book. Sick Room 

1231. LA2iCBS' PUT (Frencll). — Ingredients — Two sets of lamba' 

fry, 2 eggs, bread-crumbs, chopped parsley, hot lard. 

Blanch the fry ten minutes in boiling water, drain them on a 
sieve, and when quite dry egg over with a paste brush ; throw 
them into bread-crumbs, with which you have mixed some 
chopped parsley, fry them in very hot lard of a nice light brown 
color, dress pyramidically upon a napkin, garnish with fried 
parsley, and serve. 

1232. RABBIT (SteWOd). — Ingredients — Two nice young rabbits, 

1 qt. of milk, 1 tablespoonful of flour, a blade of mace, salt 
and pepper. 
Mix into a smooth paste the flour with half a glass of milk, 
then add the rest of the milk ; cut the rabbits up into conven- 
ient pieces ; place in a stewpan with the other ingredients and 
simmer gently until perfectly tender. 

1233. S-WEETBEEADS- 

These, when plainly cooked, are well adapted for the conval- 
escent. They should be slowly boiled, and very moderately 
seasoned with salt and cayenne pepper. 

1234. PORK JELLY (Dr. Rat cliff's Restorative).— Ingredi- 

ents. — A leg of well-fed pork, 3 gals, of water, ^oz. of mace, 

the same of nutmeg, salt to taste. 
Take the pork just as cut up, beat it, and break the bone. 
Set it over a gentle fire with the water and simmer until it is 
reduced to one gallon. Let the mace and nutmeg stew with it. 
Strain through a fine sieve. When cold take off the fat. Give 
a large cupful the first and last thing and at noon, putting 
salt to taste. 

1235. SHANK JELLY-— Ingredients— 12 shanks of mutton, 3 
blades of mace, an oniuii, 20 Jamaica, and 30 or 40 black 
peppers, a bunch of sweet herbs, a crust of bread toasted 
brown, and 3 qts. of water. 

Soak the shanks for four hours, then brush and scour them 
very clean. Lay in a saucepan with all the ingredients, pour- 
ing in the water last, and set them near the stove ; let them 
simmer as gently as possible for five hours, then strain and 
place in a cool place. This may have the addition of a pound 
of beef, if approved, for flavor. It is a remarkably good thing 
for persons who are weak. 

1236. ARROWROOT JELLY-— i pt- of water, a glass of sherry, 
a spoonful of brandy, grated nutmeg, and fine sugar, dessert 
spoonful of arrowroot rubbed smooth in two spoonfuls of cold 
water. 

This is a very nourishing disl* Put into a saucepan all the 



Cookery. mrs. Clarke's cookery book, 335 

ingredients excepting the arrowroot ; boil up once, then mix 
in by degrees the arrowroot ; then return the whole into the 
saucepan ; stir and boil it three minutes. 

1237. TAPIOCA JELLY-— Ingredients— Some of largest kind of 
tapioca, some lemon juice, wine, and sugar. 

Pour cold water on to wash it two or three times, then soak 
it in fresh water five or six hours, and simmer it in the same 
until quite clear ; then add the lemon-juice, wine, and sugar. 
The peel should have been boiled in it. It thickens very much. 

1238. MEAT JELLY.— Ingredients—Beef, isinglass, 1 teacup- 
ful of water, salt to taste. 

Cut some beef into very small pieces and carefully remove 
all the fat. Put it in an earthen jar with alternate layers of 
the best isinglass (it is more digestible then gelatine) until 
the jar is full. Then add a teacupful of water with a little salt, 
cover it down closely, and cook it all day in a very slow oven. 
In the morning scald a jelly mould and strain the liquid into it. 
It will be quite clear, except at the bottom, where will be the 
brown sediment such as is in all beef tea, and it will turn out 
in a shape. It is, of course, intended to be eaten cold, and is 
very useful in cases where hot food is forbidden, or as a variety 
from the usual diet.

Cookery. mrs. clarke's cookery book. 337 

water must be small. This is much ordered, with toast, for 
the breakfast of weak persons, abroad. 

1250. GR0T71TD HZCE IfflLZ-— Inj^redients— One spoonful of 
ground rice rubbed smooth in 1^ pints of milk, a piece of 
cinnamon, lemon peel and nutmeg.

Cleanse the sago from the earthy taste by soaking it in cold 
water for an hour, pour that off and wash well, then add more, 
and simmer gently with the milk. It swells so much that a 
small quantity will be sufficient for a quart, when done re- 
duced to about a pint. It requires no sugar or flavoring. 

1252. EGGS AlTD TOAST. -Ingredient&— 2 eggs, thmly-cut slices 

of bread, 1 teaspoonful of vinegar, little salt, a piece of 
butter the size of a walnut, a few sprigs of fresh, green 
parsley, or some sweet geranium lea^ es. 

Take the thinly-cut slices of bread,and toast them quickly to a 
light brown,without burningthem. Drop an egg or two into boil- 
ing water in which the vinegar has been poured, and a little 
salt added to it. Pour one tablespoonful of boiling water over a 
piece of butter, turn it over the toast, and if it is very dry dip 
the whole of it into the melted butter and water, soaking the 
crusts completely. Skim out the eggs as soon as the whites 
are firmly set, and put them upon the toast. Edge the plate 
with a few sprigs of fresh, green parsley, or some sweet geranium 
leaves, and serve upon a salver covered with a white napkin, 
and an invalid will usually eat of it with great relish. 

1253. BASED HOMINY.— Ingredients — To a cupful of cold 
boiled hominy (small kind) allow 2 cups of milk, a heaping 
teaspoonful of white sugar, a little salt, and 3 eggs. 

Beat the eggs very light, yolks and whites separately. Work 
the yolks into the hominy, alternately with the butter. When 
thoroughly mixed, put in the sugar and salt, and go on beating 
while you soften the batter gradually with milk. Be careful to 
leave no lumps in the batter. Lastly, stir in the whites and 
bake in a buttered pudding dish until light, firm, and del- 
icately browned. It may be eaten as a dessert, but it is a de- 
lightful article, and the best substitute that can be devised for 
green-corn pudding. 

1254. STUA^rBEimiBS— Ingredients— Fruit, white sugar, juice 

of 2 ur 3 lemons in proportion to the fruit. 
^The way to make strawberries digestible to those who are 



33? MRS. Clarke's COOKERY BOOK. Sick Room 



unable to eat them on account of dyspepsia or any other cause is 
very simple. Cover them with a very large allowance of powder- 
ed sugar and then squeeze over them the lemon juice, which 
brings out the strawberry flavor more than anything else, and 
its acidity is counteracted by the large quantity of sugar. 
The lemon juice should be in the same proportion as the cream 
would be in place of which it is used. 

1255. STRBiraTHElTIlTG BLANO-MANaE— Ingredients- 
One pint of milk, i oz. of isinglass, rind of i^ a small lemon, 
2 oz. of sugar, yolks of 3 fresh eggs. 

Dissolve the isinglass in the water, strain through muslin, 
put it again on the fire with the rind of the half-lemon cut very 
thin, and the sugar ; let it simmer gently until well flavored, 
then take out the lemon peel, and stir the milk to the beaten 
yolks of the eggs; pour the mixture back into the saucepan, 
and hold it over the fire, keeping it stirred until it begins to 
thicken ; put it into a deep basin and keep it moved with a 
spoon until it is nearly cold, then pour it into the moulds which 
have been laid in water, and set it in a cool place till firm. This 
we can recommend for invalids, as well as for the table gener- 
ally. 

1256. T7ATEII GRTTEL-— Ingredients — A large spoonful of oat- 
meal, water, salt, and a litt e piece of butter.

sugar ; well whisk the yolks with the whites of four eggs, adding 
a liitle milk, then strain into a dish. When the milk boils, take 
it off the fire and strain it ; then stir the egg into it; return the 
whole to the saucepan and set it on the fire again, stirring con- 
s antly; let it come to the boiling point, then take it off the fire, 
pour it into a large jug, and continue stirring it till it is nearly 
cold. It should now have the consistency of thick cream, and 
is ready for being poured into custard glasses ; when the 
glasses are filled, grate a little nutmeg over them. 

1261. CAT7DLS- — Ingredients— One pt. of fine gruel, yolk of an 
egg beaten with sugar, a large spoonful of cold water, a glass 
of wine and a little nutmeg.

Cookery. mrs. clarke's cookery book. 341 

it boil one or two minutes, cool it, and strain off the whey. 
Lemon juice may be used instead of vinegar, if preferred; it is 
then called lemon whey. 

1272. WINE WHET.— Ingredients— One pint of milk, 2 glasses 
of white wine, 2 teaspoonfuls of sugar. 

Boil the milk ; the moment it boils stir in the wine with the 
siiqar ; let it boil once again, stand it to cool, strain off the

use and drink a wineglass at a time. 

1276. DANDELIOIT TEA-— Ingredients -Six or 8 dandelion 
roots, according to size, 1 pint of boiling water. 

Pull up the dandelion roots and cut off the leaves ; well wash 
the roots and scrape off a little of the skin. Cut them 'p into 
small pieces and pour the boiling water on them. Let them 
stand all night, then strain through muslin, and the tea is ready 
for use. It should be quite clear, and the color of brown 
sherry. One wineglassful should be taken at a time. The 
decoction will not last good for more than two or three days, 
and therefore it must only be made in small quantities.

THE DOCTOR. 



The following recipes are selected from eminent author- 
ities and can be relied upon, but while in all cases it is pru- 
dent to consult a medical man as soon as possible, the in- 
formation under this heading will be found invaluable where 
the doctor is not readily available. 



1277. Fractures. 

Fracture is said to be simple when there is no externa! wound ; 
compound, when complicated with lesion of the surrounding 
soft parts ; and comminuted when the bone is broken intu 
many fragments. The symptons of fracture are pain and ina- 
bility to move the limb. When there is great swelling, it is 
often difficult to ascertain the nature or even the existence of 
a fracture. The course of a simple fracture is a painful and 
inflamed swelling a few days after the accident, with more or 
less febrile reaction ; these gradually subside, and with proper 
treatment the bone unites in from one to two months, with or 
without deformity according to circumstances not always under 
the control of the surgeon. Complicated fractures often termin- 
ate in the death of portions of bone and of the soft parts, in 
unhealthy abscesses and tetanus, leading perhaps to fatal re- 
sults unless the limb be removed. The indications of treat- 
ment are to reduce or set the fragments and keep them at rest 
and in close contact so as to prevent deformity; all d sturbing 
muscles must be relaxed, the ends of the bones extended and 
the parts properly supported and kept in place, the limb band- 
aged, and some kind of splint is applied to keep it immovable 
of its natural length. The variety of bandage, splints, and 
apparatU3 for the different kinds of fracture is very great, and 
in nothing does American surgery stand more pre-eminent 
than in its ingenious and effectual instruments for the treat- 
ment of broken bones. When a surgeon cannot be procured 
immediately the broken limb should be kept as nearly as pos- 
sible in its natural position. The two portions of the bone must 
be pulled in opposite directions, until the limb is the same 
length as its fellow, then apply a splint and bind it to the part 

342 



The Doctor, mrs. clarke's cookery book. 343 

with a bandage. Of course when there is no deformity the 
pulling of the bones is unnecessary. Should there be much 
swelling a cold lotion should be used. If the patient is faint, 
give brandy and water, or sal-volatile and water. 

1278. Ho'V7 to Restore a Person apparently Drowned- 

Loosen everything around the neck. Turn the patient's face 
downward, and raise the body several inches higher than the 
head, and keep it in this position long enough to count five 
slowly. This will enable the water to escape from the mouth 
and nose. Place the patient on his back with the chest slightly 
raised (by some convenient article of clothing such as a folded 
coat or shawl) and the head in a straight line with the body. 
Then practice artificial breathing in this way : — Stand astride 
the patient's hips, grasp the arms, and raise them above the 
head until they nearly meet, which expands the chest ; then pull 
them down and press firmly in the sides of the chest ; this con- 
tracts the chest and thus forces the breath first in and then 
out. While this is going on let another person catch hold of 
the tongue with a piece of clbth and pull it out, it may be se- 
cured by fastening an elastic band over the tongue and under 
the chin ; this opens the little air-valve covering the air-tube. 
While this is going on remove all wet clothing, cover the body 
with warm blankets, etc., and rub the body vigorously. If 
signs of life appear, place the patient in a warm bed in a well- 
ventilated room, and give hot drinks, such as milk, tea, or 
coffee. 

1279. Scalds and Burns. 

The first object is to cover the injured part with some suit- 
able material, and this should be kept on until the cure is com- 
plete. Apply to the burn or scald a mixture of lime water and 
linseed oil by saturating the lint with the mixture. Do not re- 
move when dry, but saturate by the application of fresh outer 
layers from time to time. If nothing belter is at hand apply 
grated potato, flour, starch, ike. 

1280. Bruises. 

Excite as quickly as possible the absorption of bruised blood 
and apply butter, fresh raw beef, or even bathing with cold water 
is a very good though simple remedy. 

1281. Hemorrliasre 

may be checked by giving strong salt and water ; or by giving 
lemon-juice. 



344 MRS. Clarke's cookery book. The Doctor* 

If an artery be cut, tie a strong string above the cut to pre- 
vent the escape of blood. Tighten the string if necessary by 
placing a ruler or stick in the string, twist this round, so as to 
make a knot pressing tightly on the artery. The blood from 
an artery is always of a very bright red and comes out in jerks 
or spurts. 

1282. To Bemove a See-Stlngr. 

Remove the sting at once with a needle or the fingers ; press 
a key tightly over the stung part, the pressure will force the 
poison out. Wipe the place with clean linen, suck it and then 
dab with the blue-bag. 

1283. Bitos Of Snakes. 

These are dangerous and require powerful remedies. The 
bites of the various kinds of snakes do not have the same ef- 
fects, but people suffer from them in different ways. It is of the 
greatest importance to prevent the poison mixing with the 
blood and to remove the whole of it instantly from the body. 
Take a piece of tape or anything that is near and tie tightly 
around the part bitten ; it it be the leg or arm, immediately 
above the bite and between it and the heart, the wound should 
be sucked several times by any person near. There is no dan- 
ger to the person performing this kindness, providing his tongue 
or any part of the mouth has no broken skin. Having sucked 
the poison, immediately spit it out. A better plan is to cut out 
the central part bitten with a sharp instrument. This may not 
be a very pleasant operation for an amateur, but, as we have 
to act promptly in such an emergency, courage will come. After 
the operation bathe the wound for some time to make it bleed 
freely. Having done this rub the wound with a stick of lunar- 
caustic or, still better, a solution composed of sixty grains of 
lunar caustic dissolved in an ounce of water. This solution 
should be dropped into the wound. Of course the band tied 
round the wound in the firsl place must be kept on during the 
time these means are being adopted. The wound afterwards 
must be covered with lint dipped in cold water. There is gener- 
ally great depression of strength in these cases, it is necessary 
therefore to give some stimulant, a glass of hot brandy and 
water, or twenty drops of sal-volatile. When the patient has 
somewhat recovered give him a little mustard in hot water to 
make him vomit, if on the other hand the vomiting is continu- 
ous, a large mustard poultice should be applied to the stomach 
and one pill given composed of a grain of solid opium. Note. — 
Only one ot these pills must be given without medical advice. 

All these remedies can be acted upon until a surgeon arrives. 



The Doctor. Uks. cLarke's cookery book. 345 

1284. Bites of Dogs. 

The manner of treatment is the same as for snake-hites. 
Many writers on the subject are in favor of the wound being 
kept open as long as possiljle. Many persons do this by placing 
a tew beans on the wound and then putting a linseed meal 
poultice over the wound. 

1285. Treatment of Sprains. 

Immediately after the accident the part siiould be immersed 
in a bath at the heat of 100 deg., alter which leeches should 
be applied, and then a poultice of vinegar and bran, hikewarnj, 
or bread crumbs and camphorated spirits of wine ; the follow- 
ing lotion, when applied in the early stage, after blood has 
been freely drawn by leeches, rarely fails in affording great 
relief: — Gourlard's extract, half an ounce ; tincture of opium, 
two drachms ; vinegar, half a pint; camphor mixture, one pint 
and a half. Mix for a lotion, to be applied tepid by means 
of folded rags. After the inflammatory action has subsided, 

one of the loUowing Liniments should to used : 

1286. (i) Soap liniment, one ounce ; tincture of opium, two 
drachms ; camphorated spirits, two drachms. Mix for a lini- 
ment, and rub in night and morning. 

1287. (2) Camphorated spirits of wine, half an ounce ; cajaput 
oil and laudanum, of each, two drachms; olive oil, half an 
ounce. Mix for a liniment, and apply night and morning. 

1288. (3) Olive oil and spirits of turpentine, of each half an 
oz. Mix for a liniment, and use as above. 

1289. (4) When weakness remains after a sprain, pumping 
cold water on the part every morning, aided by a bandage or 
laced stocking to support the part, will be the most effectual 
means of remedying it. 

1290. Tor Sprained Ankle.— Bathe the ankle frequently with 
strong cold salt and water; sit with the foot elevated, keeping it 
cool. Diet, and take daily cooling drinks or medicine. Or 
bind on loosely, and as often as dry, first twenty-four hours, 
cotton batting, spread with beaten egg-whites ; after that, 
morning and night. 

1 291. To Bind a Sprained Ankle.— Put the end of the 

bandage upon the mstep ; then take it round and bring it over 
the same part again, and then round the foot two or three times; 
finish off with a turn or two round the leg above the ankle. 

1292. Sprained "Wrist-— Begin by passing the bandage 
round the hand, across and across, like the figure 8 ; leave out 



346 MRS. Clarke's cookery book. The Doctor. 

the thumb, and finish with a turn or two rotind the wrist. Apply 
arnica tincture. 

1293. Treatment of a Frozen Person. 

Chelius, a German authority, gives the following advice for 
restoring a frozen person. He should be brought into a cold 
room, and after having been undressed, covered up with snow 
or with cloth in ice-cold water, or he may be laid in cold water 
so deeply, that his mouth and nose are only free. When the 
body is somewhat thawed, there is commonly a sort of icy 
crust formed around it ; the patient must then be removed, 
and the body washed with cold water mixed with a little wine 
or brandy ; when the limbs lose their stiffness, and the frozen 
person shows signs of life, he should be carefully dried, and 
put into a cold bed in a cold room ; scents and remedies which 
excite sneezing, are to be put to his nose ; air to be carefully 
blown into the lungs, if natural breathing do^ not come on ; 
clysters of warm water with camphorated vinegar thrown up ; 
the throat tickled with a feather, and cold water dashed upon 
the pit of the stomach. He must be brought by degrees into 
rather warmer air, and mild perspirants, as elder and balm-tea 
(or weak common tea) with Minderin's spirit, warm wine and 
the like, may be given to promote gentle perspiration. 

1294. Bruises. 
In slight bruises, and those that are not likely to be 
followed by inflammation, nothing more is usually required 
than to bathe the part with spirit, as Eau-de-Cologne, brandy, 
&c., mixed with an equal proportion of vinegar and water. 

1295. In more severe cases, and where the accident is near 
an important part, as the eye, or any of the joints, it becomes a 
desirable object to prevent the approach of inflammation. For 
this purpose leeches must be employed, repeating them accord- 
ing to circumstances. If considerable fever be present, bleed- 
ing from the arm, purgatives, and low diet, may become neces- 
sary. 

1296. In the last stage of a bruise, where there is merely a 
want of tone in the parts, and swelling from the effused blood, 
&c., friction should be employed, either simply, or with any 
common liniment. Wearing a bandage, — pumping cold water 
on the part, succeeded by warm friction, — a saturated solution 
of common salt in water, have each been found successful. 
The roots of briony and Solomon's seal, bruised and applied 
as a poultice, are highly useful in hastening the disappearance 
of the discoloration caused by bruises.

1297. Accidents from Ed^e Tools, Hard Bodies, Ste- 
in all recent wounds, the first consideration is to remove for- 
eign bodies, such as pieces of glass, splinters of wood, pieces 
nf stone, earth, or any other substance that may have been in- 
iroduced by the violence of the act which caused the wound. 

Where there is much loss of blood, an attempt should be 
made to stop it with dry lint, and compression above the part 
wounded, if the blood be of a florid color; and below, if of a 
dark color. In proportion to the importance of the ptrt wound- 
ed, will be the degree of the discharge of blood, and the sub- 
sequent tendency to inflammation and its consequences. 

1298. Substances in the Eye. 

A substance getting in the eye may either lie disengaged 
on its surface, or, having penetrated the external coat, may 
there remain fixed. In the former case, it is easily removed 
by a camel-hair pencil, or a piece of paper rolled into the size 
of a crow-quill with the end softened in the mouth. 

1299. Sometimes the substance sticks in the corner, when, if 
it cannot be removed with a probe or fine forceps, the point 
of a lancet should be carefully passed under it so as to lift it 
out. 

1300. If the removal cannot be eff"ected without considerable 
difficulty, it is better to leave it to be detached by ulceration, 
taking every precaution to keep off undue inflammation, by 
avoiding a strong light, fomenting with warm water, etc. 

1301. To remove fine particles of gravel, lime, etc., the eye 
shonld be syringed with luke-warm water till free from them. 
Be particular not to worry the eye under the impression that 
the substance is still there, which the enlargement of some of 
the minute vessels make, the patient believe to be actually the 
case. 

1302. Substances in tlie Ear. 

Hard substances, such as peas, bits of slate-pencil, beads, 
etc., occasionally get lodged in the passage of the external ear. 
If the substance be within sight, and can be grasped readily 
with a small pair of forceps, that will be the best way to extract 
it ; but force must not, on any account, be used. 

1303. But the best and safest plan is to inject luke-warm wa- 
ter rather forcibly into the ear by means of a syringe, one that 
will hold at least two ounces. This will be found rarely to fail, 
the water passing beyond the substance, and being there con- 



348 MRS. CLARKE'S COOKERY BOOK. ThE DoCTOR, 

fined by the membrane, called the tympanum^ forces the former 
outwards. 

1304. Should the substance have swelled, or the ear become 
swollen, a little sweet oil must be poured into the ear, and left 
there till the next day, when syringing may be used. 

1305. Glass beads and similar substances, may be extracted 
by means of a probe, dipped into some appropriate cement, in- 
tro'iuced into the ear, and kept in contact with the body to be 
remo . ed, for a few moments till it has become set. 

1306. Sulistances in the Tliroat. 

A fish-bone, or pin, beinjj lodj,'ed in the throat, m'ly some- 
times be readily got rid of by exciting vomiting by tickling the 
backpart of the throat. 

1307. Another mode is td make the patient swallow a good 
mouthful of bread-crumb. ^ 

1308. Another expedient is to introduce a large goose-quill- 
down the throat, and then twirl it round, by this means the sub- 
stance may be disengaged, and so pass down into the stomach. 

1309. A plentiful draught of water will sometimes be suffici- 
ent, when the substance is merely engaged in the folds of the 
gullet. We would, however, particularly recommend in this 
case the white of an egg, and, if necessary, a second. 

1310. Disease of Infants. 

The most frequent of these are — i, disorders of the stomach ; 
2, disorders of the bowels ; 3, exhaustion ; 4, febrile affections ; 
5, exanthematous diseases, or those which are attended with 
eruptions of the skin ; 6, affections of the head ; 7, diseases of 
the thorax, or chest ; 8, affections of the abdomen, or belly. 

Disorders of the stomach generally depend on improper 
diet ; or they may be secondary, and the effects of a disordered 
or confined state of the bowels. They are often detected by 
acid or foetid eructations and breath, or by the unusually 
frequent regurgitation or vomiting of food. 

Disorders of the bowels can never be mistaken or overlooked 
by an attentive nurse, the evacuations in their number and 
appearance, being the perfect index to these disorders. 

It must never be forgotten, that whenever the system has 
been exposed to sources of exhaustion, this condition may be- 
come, in its turn, the source of various morbid affections which 
are apt to be ascribed to other causes, and treated by improper, 
and therefore dangerous, measures. If the infant has had 



The Doctor. Mrs. Clarke's cookery book. 349 

diarrhoea, or if it has been bled by leeches ; or if, without these, 
its cheeks are pale and cool ; and if, under these circumstances, 
it be taken with symptoms of affection of the head, do not fail 
to remember that this affection may be the result of exhaustion. 
This important subject seems to have been generally 
misunderstood. 

Fever is sooner detected. In every such case it is ad- 
visable not to tamper nor delay, but to send for the medical 
man, and watch the little patient with redoubled care and 
attention. 

Especially examine the skin, hour after hour, for eruptions. 
It may be measles or scarlatina, &c. It will be especially de- 
sirable to detect these eruptio s early, and to point them out 
to the physician. Above all things, let not a contracted brow, 
an unusual state of the temper or manner, unusual drowsiness 
or wakefulness, orstarting, and especially unusual vomiting, es- 
cape you. 

Be alive to any acceleration, or labor, or shortness of the 
breathing, or cough, or sneezing, or appearance of inflamma- 
tion about the eyes or nostrils. These symptons may portend 
inflammation within the chest, hooping-cough, measles. Pain 
of the body, with or without vomiting; or diarrhoea, with or 
without a morbid state of the bowels, oi of the discharges, 
ought also to excite immediate attention. One caution should 
be given on this subject : some of the most alarming and fatal 
affections of the bowels, like some affections of the head, are 
unattended by ac7tte pain or tenderness; their accession, on the 
contrary, is insidious, and it will require great attention to de- 
tect them early 

Another view, and another mode of the classification of the 
diseases of infants, full of interest, full of admonition is — i, as 
they are sudden ; or 2, as they are insidious ; or 3, as they are, 
in the modes of accession, intermediate between these two ex- 
tremes. 

Of the sudden affections, are fits of every kind, croup, and 
some kinds of pain, as that of colic ; of the second class are 
hydrocephalus, or water on the brain, and tubercles in t .e 
lungs or abdomen, constituting the two kinds of consumption. 
Fits, again, are cerebral, and arise from diseases within the 
head, or from irritation in the stomach and bowels, or trom ex- 
haustion ; or they are evidence of, and depend on, some mal- 
formation or disease of the heart. 

Domestic treatment should never be trusted in such terrific 
affections as these ; not a moment should be lost in sending 
for the medical man. 



350 MRS. Clarke's cookery book. The Doctor. 

If anything w&y be done in the meantime, it is — i, in either 
of the two former cases to lance the gums ; 2, to evacuate the 
bowels by the warm water injection, made more active by the 
addition of Brown Sugar ; 3, and then to administer the warm 
bath. An important point, never to be forgotten in the hurry 
of these cases, is to reserve the evacuations for inspection 
otherwise the physicians will be deprived of a very important 
source of judgment. 

In cases of fits arising plainly from exhaustion, there need 
be no hesitation in giving five diops of sal volatile in water, 
light nourishment may be added ; the feet must be fomented 
and the recumbent posture preserved. 

In fits arising from an affection of the heart the symptom is 
urgent difficulty of breathing ; the child seems as if it would 
lose its breath and expire. In such a case, ^o do nothing is the 
best course ; all self-possession must be summoned, and the 
infant kept perfectly quiet. Every change of posture, every 
effort, is attended with danger. 

Sometimes the attaci<s asstime the character of croup ; there 
is a crowing cough, and breathing; or there is a difficulty of 
breathing, and then a crowing inspiration. The former case is 
generally croup ; the latter is, in reality, a fit dependent on the 
morbid condition of the brain or spinal marrow, although it 
takes the appearance of an affection of the organs of respira- 
tion. 

In either case it is well to clear the bowels by means of the 
slow injection of from a quarter to half a pint of warm water, 
with or without brown sugar ; indeed this is the most generally 
and promptly useful of all our remedies in infantile diseases. 
To this the warm bath may always be added, if administered 
with due caution. For instance, it should not be continued so 
as to induce much flushing or paleness of the countenance. 

1311. Lleaales. 

Measles commences with the ordinary symptoms of fever. 
The attack is almost invariably attended with inflammation of 
the mucous membrane lining the air passages ; the eyes are red 
and watery ; there is dctluxion from the nostrils, hoarseness, 
and cough. The eruption commonly appears on the fourth 
day, at first about the head and neck, then the trunk and arms, 
and finally reaching the lower extremities ; it takes two or 
three days to complete its course and when it reaches the feet 
and legs has often begun to disappear from the face. All ages 
are liable to it. When the eruption is fully out, the cough, at 
first dry and troublesome, generally becomes softer and less 



The Doctor, mrs. clarke's cookery book. 351 

frequent, and at the end of six or seven from the coming 
out of the first papules they have disappeared. When danger 
occurs, it is from inflammation of the air passages. In all 
ordinary cases simple diet, the maintenance of an equable 
temperature, plenty of diluent drinks, attention should be paid 
to the bowels as they should be kept gently open, if a roasted 
apple or a little manna in the drink will not do this, give a 
mild saline aperient such as ipecacuanha wine and sweet spirits 
of nitre, i drachm; of tartrate of potash, 4 drachms; 
solution of acetate of ammonia i ounce ; syrup of poppies, 
2 drachms ; cinnamon or dill water sufficient to make 
4 ounces ; dose, a table or dessert spoonful three or four 
times a day. Where there is much heat of the skin, sponging 
with tepid vinegar and water will commonly relieve it, and also 
the itching. On the third or fourth day after the subsidence 
of the eruption a little opening medicine should be given and 
care must be taken to protect the patient against change 
of weather, and to restore the strength by a nourishing diet. 
Attention should be paid to the cough, and the proper re- 
medies given if required. Should the eruption suddenly dis- 
appear, then there is cause for alarm ; the patient should be 
directly put into a warm bath, and have warm diluent drinks ; 
if the pulse sinks rapidly, adminster wine whey or weak brandy 
and water. 

1312. Scarlet Fever. 

This fever is distinguished from other eruptive fevers by the 
fact of the eruption being an exanthema, an efflorescence, or a 
rash, these 'terms not being strictly applicable to vesicles and 
pustules. The disease sometimes commences with a chill, 
and in most cases vomiting is a primary symptom especially 
in children. The fever which at once occurs is usually intense, 
the axillary temperature often rising to 105°, or even higher. 
The surface of the body often gives to the touch a burning sen- 
sation. The rash appears in about twenty-four hours after 
the date of the invasion, and with few exceptions breaks out 
first on the face and neck. The color ol the rash is scarlet, 
whence the name. The skin is somewhat swollen and the rash 
occasions a burning sensation with in some cases intense itch- 
ing. Generally the eruption takes place in the throat, and the 
tonsils are more or less swollen. The cutaneous eruption is 
prolonged from four to six days. Then follows the stage of 
scaling, and in some instances the cuticle of the hands may be 
stripped off like a glove. In favorable cases the duration of 
this stage may be reckoned to be five or six days, when con- 



35^ MRS. CLARKE's C00K6RY BOOK. ThE DoCTOR. 

valescence is established. In other cases it is extremely severe 
and may prove fatal within a few days or even hours. Scarlet 
fever is highly contagious and the infectious material remains 
for a long time in garments, etc. Children are more suscep- 
tible than adults. The treatment in mild cases is very simple. 
Active medication is not indicated. It suffices to diminish the 
animal heat by sponging the body and giving cooling drinks 
observing proper hygienic precautions. Smearing the surface 
of the limbs with fat bacon allays the itching which is often 
very distressing. Should the symptoms show failure of the 
vital powers, supporting measures of treatment (alcoholic stim- 
ulants and alimenation) are indicated. Great care must be 
taken to keep the patient warm right through the disease as 
affections of the kidneys often follow cases of scarlet fever. 
It is important to isolate the patient and attendant from the 
healthy. Remove all curtains and carpets, and clothing not 
actually in use from the sick chamber. On removing the 
patient's linen or bed clothes, throw them into water and so 
convey to the wash. Chloride of lime should be set about the 
room in plates. When the patient can be removed from the 
room, scrub the room with chloride of lime in the water. It 
is wise to keep the patient in bed for three weeks. Should the 
eruption be slowin appearing,sponge the body with cold vinegar 
and water, wrap in a blanket and keep the patient warm. 
Should the throat be sore, keep hot bran poultice constantly 
applied. If the fever runs high in the first stage, and there is 
great inclination to vomit (before sponging), it is a good plan 
to give an emetic of equal proportions of antimonial and 
ipecacuanha wine; dose, a teaspoonful to a tablespoonful, ac- 
cording to age. 

1313. Eoopine: Oouerii. 

This well-known disease is chiefly, but not wholly, confined 
to the stages of infancy, and it occurs but once in a life-time. 
It may be described as a spasmodic catarrh, and its severity 
varies greatly ; sometimes being so mild as to be scarcely 
known from a cCmmon cough, at others, exhibiting the most 
distressing symptoms, and frequently causing death by its 
violent and exhausting paroxysms. 

The first symptoms of this cough are those of an ordinary 
cold ; there is probably restlessness and slight fever, with irri- 
tation in the bronchial passages ; this goes on gradually in- 
creasing in intensity for a week or ten days, and then begins 
to assume the spasmodic character ; at first the paroxysms are 
slight, and of short duration with a scarcely perceptible "hoop," 



The Doctor, mrs. clarke's cookery book. 353 

but soon they become more frequent and severe ; a succession 
of violent expulsive coughs is followed by a long-drawn inspir- 
ation, in the course of which the peculiar sound which gives 
a name to the disease is emitted; again come the coughs, and 
again the inspiration, following each other in quick succession, 
until the sufferer, whose starting eyes, livid face, swollen veins, 
and clutching hands, attest the violence of the struggle for 
breath, is relieved by an expectoration of phlegm resembling 
the white of an egg, or by vomiting. When the paroxysm is 
over, the child generally resumes its play, or other occupation, 
and frequently complains of being hungry. As the disease 
proceeds, the matter expectorated becomes thicker, and is more 
easily got rid of, and this is a sign of favorable progress : the 
spasmodic paroxysms become less frequent and violent, and 
gradually cease altogether ; but the changes here indicated 
may extend over a month or six months, according to circum- 
stances, the season of the year having much influence in has- 
tening or retarding them ; summer being, of course, the most 
favorable time. It is a common impression that, at whatever 
time of year an attack of Hooping Cough commences, it will 
not end until May ; this is simply because of the change in the 
weather which generally takes place in or about the course of 
that month. With a strong, healthy child (when pioper care 
is taken), there is little to apprehend from this disease, pro- 
vided it be not complicated with others, such as inflammation 
of the lungs, or any head afTection producing convulsions ; it 
then proves a most dangerous malady, and is fatal to many. 
With children of a full habit, the fits of coughing often cause 
bleeding at the nose, but this should not be viewed with alarm, 
as it relieves the vessels of the brain, and is likely to prevent 
worse consequences. 

To weakly children Hooping Cough is a very serious malady 
— to all it is frequently a very sore trial, but to them it is es- 
pecially so : therefore great care should be taken not to expose 
them to the danger of catching it ; that it is contagious there 
can be no doubt, and although some parents think lightly of it, 
and imagining their children must have it, at one time or 
another, deem that it matters little when, and therefore take 
no pains to protect them against it ; yet we would impress up on 
all our readers, who may have the care of infants, that a heavy 
responsibility lies at their door. It is by no means certain that 
a child will have this disease; we have known many persons 
who have reached a good old age and never contracted it ; and 
it is folly and wickedness needlessly to expose those placed 
under our care to a certain danger. 



354 MRS. CLARKE'S COOKERY BOOK. ThE DoCTOR. 



Like fever, Hooping Cough has a course to run, which no 
remedies, with which we are at present acquainted, will short- 
en ; the severity of the symptoms may be somewhat mitigated, 
and we may, by watching the course of the disease, and by 
use of the proper means, often prevent those complications 
which render it dangerous, and this brings us to the consider- 
ation of the proper mode of 

Treatment. — The first effort should be directed to check any 
tendency to inflammation which may show itself ; to palliate 
urgent symptoms, and stop the spasm which is so distress- 
ing a feature of the case. To this end, the diet must be of 
the simplest kind, consisting for the most part of milk and 
farinaceous puddings ; if animal food, it must not be solid, but in 
the form of Broth, or Beef-tea ; roasted Apples are £;ood ; and, 
for drinks, Milk and Water, Barley-water, Weak Tea, or Whey. 

Care must be taken to keep the bowels open with some 
gentle aperient, such as Rhubarb and Magnesia, with 
now and then a grain of Calomel or Compound Julep 
PDwder if something stronger is required. An emetic should 
be given about twice a week, to get rid of the phlegm — it may 
be Ipecacuanha Wine or the Powder. To relieve the cough, 
the following mixture will be found effective : — Ipecacuanha 
Powder, lo grains ; Bicarbonate of Potash, i drachm ; Liquor 
of Acetate of Ammonia, 2 ounces; Essence of Cinnamon, 8 
drops ; Water, (>%. ounces : Dose, a tablespoonful about everj- 
four hours. 20 drops of Laudanum, or i drachm of Tincture 
of Henbane may be added if the cough is very troublesome, 
but the former is objectionable if the brain is at all affected. 

For night restlessness, 2 or 3 grains of Dover's Powders, 
taken at bed-time, is good ; this is the dose for a child of three 
years old. Mustard poultices to the throat, the chest, and be- 
tween the shoulders, are often found beneficial ; so is an opiate 
liniment composed of Compound Camphor and Soap Liniment, 
of each 6 drachms, and 4 drachms of Laudanum. Roadie s 
Embrocation is a favourite application, and a very good one ; it 
is composed as follows : — Oil of Amber and of Cloves, of each 
% an ounce; Oil of Olives, i ounce ; a little Laudanumis, 
perhaps, an improvement. This may be rubbed on the belly 
when it is sore from coughing. Difficulty of breathing may be 
sometimes relieved by the vapour of Ether or Turpentine 
diffused through the apartment. In the latter stages of the 
disease, tonics are generally advisable. Steel Wine, about 20 
drops, with 2 grains of Sesquicarbonate of Ammonia, and 5 
drops of Tincture of Conium, in a tablespoonful of Cinnamon 
Water, sweetened with Syrup, is a g^ od form ; but a chanj^e of 



The Doctor, mrs. clarke's cookery book. 355 

air, with a return to a generous diet, are the most efifectual 
means of restoration to health and strength. 

Squinting, stupor, and convulsions are symptomatic of 
mischief in the brain ; in this case leeches to the temples, and 
small and frequently repeated doses of Calomel and James's 
Powder should be resorted to. Fever, and j,'reat difficulty of 
breathing, not only during the fits of coughing, but between 
them, indicate inflammation in the chest, on which a blister 
should be put, after the application of two or three leeches. In 
this case, the rule must be low diet, with febrifuge medicines, 
such as Acetate of Ammonia, Tartarized Antimony in Camphor 
Mixture, and Calomel and James's Powders. Some medical 
practitioners have recommended the application of Lunar 
Caustic to the glottis in this disease, but no unprofessional 
person should attempt this. Others have found the Tincture 
of artifical Musk serviceable, beginning with 3 or 4 minim 
doses at the outset, and going up to 10 or 12 minims, in Barley 
Water, two or three times a day. Diluted Nitric Acid we have 
frequently administered both to children and adults, with 
decidedly beneficial results ; from 5 to 10 drops iu plain or 
Cinnamon Water, sweetened ; it may be given very frequently ; 
a little Ipecacuanha Wine, and Tincture of Henbane or Hem- 
lock, about 5 drops, may be added to each dose. Cochineal 
and Salts of Tartar is the old popular remedy, and it i=;, no 
doubt, sometimes uselul, but v/e would rather not depend on 
it. 

Dr. Golding Bird recommends the following mixture: — Alum, 
25 grains ; Extract of Henbane, 12 grains, Syrup of Poppies, 
2 drachms ; Dill Water, sufficient to make 3 ounces : give a 
dessertspoonful every six hours. — The Family Doctor. 

1314. Diarrhoea— (Greok rto, to flow). 

Looseness of the bowels, sometimes called Flux. This 
is a very commom disorder, arising from a variety of 
causes, foremost among which may be mentioned suppressed 
perspiration, a sudden chill or cold applied to the body, acid 
fruits, or any indi£;estible food, oily or putrid substances, 
deficiency of bile, increased secretion of mucus, worms, strong 
purgative medicines, gout or rheumatism turned inwards, &c. 
Hence diarrhoea may be distinguished as bilious, jnucous, 
lienitery {where the food passes unchanged), caliac (where it 
passes oft in a white liquid state, like chyle), and verminose, 
produced by worms. 

The sytnpioms are frequent and copious discharges of 
feculent matter, accompanied usually with griping and 



356 MRS. Clarke's cookery book. The Doctor. 



flatulency , there is weight and uneasiness in the lower belly 
which is relieved for a time on the discharge *^aking place ; 
there is nausea, often vomiting ; a pale countenance, some- 
times sallow; a bitter taste in the mouth, with thirst and dry- 
ness of the throat ; the tongue is furred and yellow, indicating 
bile in the alimentary canal ; the skin is dry and harsh, and 
if the diseaee is not checked great emaciation ensues. 

The treatment must depend in some degree on the cause ; 
the removal of the exciting ihatter, by means of an emetic, or 
aperient medicines, will, however, be a safe proceeding at first ; 
if the Diarrhoea be caused by obstructed perspiration or expo- 
sure to cold, nauseating doses of Antimonial, or Ipecacuanha 
Wine, may be given every three or four hours, the feet put into 
a warm bath, and the patient be well covered up in bed. When 
the case is obstinate, resort may be had to the vapour bath, 
making a free use of diluents and demulcents. Where there 
is acidity of the stomach, denoted by griping pains and 
flatulency, take Chalk Mixture, with Aromati-c Confection, and 
other anti acid absorbents or alkalies, such as Carbonate of 
Potash, with Spirits of Ammcnia, and Tincture of Opium, or 
some other anodyne ; if from putrid or otherwise unwholesome 
food, the proper course, after the removal of the offending 
matter, is to give absorbents, in combination with Opium, or 
if these fail, acid and an anodyne ; the following is an 
efficacious formula : Diluted Sulphuric Acid, 2 drachms ; 
Tincture of Opium, y^ a drachm ; Water, 6 ounces ; take a 
tablespoonful every two hours. When the looseness proceeds 
from acrid or poisonous substances, warm diluent drinks should 
be freely administered, to keep up vomiting, previously excited 
by an emetic ; for this purpose thin fat broth answers well ; a 
purge of Castor Oil should also be given, and after its operation, 
small doses of Morphine, or some other preparation of Opium. 
When repelled gout or rhumatism is the cause, warm 
fomentations, cataplasms, blisters to the extremities, and 
stimulant purges such as Tincture of Rhubarb, to be followed 
by absorbents with anodynes ; if worms are the exciting cause, 
their removal must be first attempted, but drastic purgatives, 
often given for the purpose, are dangerous ; in this case, 
Turpentine and Castor Oil, i drachm of the first and 6 of the 
last, may be recommended. The Diarrhoea which often 
occurs in childhood during the teething, should not be sudden- 
ly checked, nor at all, unless it prevails to a hurtful extent ; if 
necessary to stop it, give first a dose of Mercury and Chalk, 
from 2 to 4 or 6 grain; . according to age, and then powder of 
Prepared Chalk, Cmnamon, and Rhubarb, about 3 grains of 



The Doctor, mrs. Clarke's cookery book. 357 



each every four hours. DiarrhcEa sometimes attacks pregnant 
women, and, in this case, its progress ought to be arrested as 
quickly as possible. In all cases of looseness of the bowels it is 
best to avoid hot thin drinks, unless given for a specific purpose ; 
the food, too, should be simple and easy of digestion ; Milk 
with Cinnamon boiled in it, thickened with Rice or Arrowroot, 
is good ; vegetables, salt meat, suet puddings and pies are not ; 
if there is much exhaustion, a little cool Brandy and Water 
may be now and then taken. When Dirrhoea is stopped, 
astringent tonics, with aromatics, should be given to restore 
the tone of the stomach. 

This disease may be distinguished from Dysentery, by 
being unattended by either inflammation, fever, contagion, 
or that constant inclination to go to stool without a discharge, 
which is common in the latter disease, in which the matter 
voided is sanguineous and putrid, while that in Diarrhoea is 
simply feculent and alimentary. — The Family Doctor. 

1315. Diphtheria- 

in diphtheria the false membrane accompanying inflamma- 
tion appears almost invariably in the fauces or throat, and in 
many cases it is limited to this situation. It may extend more 
or less over the mucus surface within the mouth and nostrils. 
It is not infrequently produced within the windpipe, giving 
rise to all the symptoms of true cr»up, and generally proving 
fatal. The disease rarely occurs except as an epidemic. Per- 
sons between three and twelve years of age are most apt to 
be affected with it, but no period of life is exempt from a lia- 
bility to it. Frequent vomiting, diarrhoea, hemorrhage from 
the nostrils or elsewhere, convulsions, delirium, and coma are 
symptoms which denote great danger. The chief objects in 
the treatment are to palliate symptoms and support the powers 
of life by the judicious employment of tonic remedies conjoined 
with alimentation and alcoholic stimulants. The latter are 
in some cases given in large quantity without inducing their 
excitant effects, and there is reason to believe that they are 
sometimes the means of saving life. The following treatment 
has been tried in our own family, and has been most success- 
ful : 

1 3 16. The Sulphur Treatment of Diphtheria. — An eminent 
physician is said to have worked great wonders in treating 
diphtheria with sulphur during the recent prevalence of an 
epidemic. A person who accompanied him says : " He put a 
teaspoonful of flour of brimstone into a wine-glass of water, 
and stirred it with his finger instead of a spoon, as sulphur 



358 MRS. Clarke's cookery book. The Doctor. 

does not readily amalgamate with water. When the sulphur 
was well mixed he gave it as a gargle, and in ten minutes the 
patient was out of danger. Instead of spitting out the gargle, 
he recommended the swallowing of it. In extreme cases in 
which he had been called just in the nick of time, when the 
fungus was too nearly closing to allow the gargle, he blew the 
sulphur through a quill into the throat, and, if the fungus had 
shrunk to allow of it, then the gargling. He never lost a pa- 
tient from diphtheria. If a patient cannot gargle, take a live 
coal, put it on a shovel, and sprinkle a spoonful or two of flour 
of brimstone at a time upon it : let the sufferer inhale it, hold- 
ing the head over it, and the fungus will die. If plentifully 
used, the whole room may be filled almost to suffocation, and 
the patient can walk about in it, inhaling the fumes, with doors 
and windows closed.'' 

1317. Tirphoid Fever. 

This fever is called by German abdominal typhus, and by Eng- 
lish and American writers, for the same reason, enteric fever. 
This characteristic, intestinal affection, is one of the essential 
points of distinction between typhoid and typhus fever. Typhoid 
fever is undoubtedly communicable, yet it is rarely com- 
municated to those who are brought into contact with cases of 
it, namely, physicians, nurses, and fellow patients in hospital 
wards ; and it occurs when it is quite impossible to attribute 
it to a contagion. It is more apt to prevail in the autumnal 
months than at other seasons. The early symptoms are chilly 
sensations, pain in the head, loins, and limbs, lassitude, and 
looseness of the bowels. During the course of the fever stupor, 
as in cases of typhus, is more or less marked. In the majority 
of cases there is a characteristic eruption, usually confined 
to the trunk, but sometimes extending to the limbs. The 
duration of the fever is longer than that of typhus, the average, 
dating from tiie time of taking to the bed, being about sixteen 
days in the cases which end in recovery ; it is somewhat less 
in the fatal cases. Milk is pre-eminently the appropriate 
article of diet, and alcoholic stimulants are sometimes tolerated 
in very large quantities without any of the excitant or in- 
toxicating effects which they would produce in health. Favour- 
able hygienic conditions are important, such as free ventilation, 
a proper temperature, and cleanliness. 

1318. Fits. 

Fainting fits are sometimes dangerous, at other times harm 
less ; should heart disease be the cause, the danger is great.

If from some slight cause, such as sight of blood, fright, ex- 
cessive heat, &c., there is no cause for alarm. It would be 
superfluous to enumerate the symptoms. The treatment: First, 
lay the patient upon his back with his head level with the feet, 
loosen all garments, dash cold water over the face ; sprinkle 
vinegar and water over the hands and about the mouth, apply 
smelling salts to the nose, and when the patient has recovered 
a little, give 20 drops of sal-volatile in water. 

1319. Apoplexy. 

These fits generally occur in stout, short-necked people, 
symptoms, sparks before the eyes, giddiness, confusion of ideas, 
when the patient falls down insensible ; the body is paralyzed, 
the face and head is flushed and hot, the eyes fixed, the breath- 
ing loud. Put the patient to bed, immediately raise the head, 
remove everything from the neck, bleed freely from the arm, 
if there is no lancet at hand use a penknife, put warm mustard 
poultices to the soles of the feet and the insides of the thighs, 
the bowels should be freely opened, take two drops of castor 
oil and mix with eight grains of calomel, put this as far back 
on the tongue as possible, the warmth of the throat will cause 
the oil to melt quickly, and so be absorbed into the stomach. 
If the blood vessels about the head are much swollen put eight 
leeches on the temple opposite the paralyzed side. Send for 
surgeon at once. 

1320. Epilepsy. 

These fits generally attack young persons. Symptoms : 
Palpitations, pain in the head, but as a rule, the patient falls 
dewn suddenly without warning. The eyes are distorted, foam- 
ing at the mouth, the fingers tightly clenched and the body 
much agitated ; when the fit is over, the patient feels drowsy 
and faint. Keep the patient flat on his back, slightly raise the 
head, loosen all garments round the neck, dash cold water 
upon the face, place a piece of wood between the teeth to 
prevent the patient hurting his tongue. After the fit give the 
following pills. 

1321. Dr. Oullea's Treatment of Epilepsy, or railing Pits. 

Take of ammoniate of copper, twenty grains ; bread crumb 
and mucilage of gum arable, a sufficient quantity to form it 
into a mass, which is to be divided into forty pills. In the 
beginning one of these is to be taken three times a day, and 
gradually increased to two, or even three pills, thrice a day.

1322. Hysteria. 

A nervous aflfection chiefly seen in females, and generally 
connected with uterine irregularities ; it is sometimes called 
Clavus or Globus Histericus., and is commonly known as Hys- 
terics. As this is a very common affection, amenable to do- 
mestic treatment, it is desirable that we should devote some 
little space to a consideration of it. First let us observe, that 
the age at which there is the greatest proneness to Hysteria, 
IS from that of puberty to the fiftieth year, that is 
from the accession to the cessation of menstrual 
life ; at the beginning and end of which it is more 
frequent and marked than at any other period. Single 
women, and the married who do not bear children are most 
subject to it, although it sometimes occurs at the early period 
of pregnancy and immediately after child-birth. Persons of 
studious and sedentary habits, and of scrofulous and weakly 
constitutions, are especially likely to be the subjects of Hys- 
teria ; as are indolent and plethoric persons, and those debili- 
tated by disease, or excesses of any kind : it may be excited by 
excessive evacuations, suppression of the natural secretions, 
strong mental emotions, or sympathy with others so affected. 
It is a curious circumstance connected with this affection that 
it simulates almost every disease to which humanity is liable. 
A patient suffering under Hysteria may have a rough, hoarse, 
croupy cough, loss of voice, hiccup, pain in the left side, flut- 
tering of the heart, running at the eyes and nose, spasmodic 
contractions and convulsive movements of various kinds, 
vomiting, copious evacuations, delirium, and all kinds of violent 
and unmanageable symptoms, which subside as soon as the 
hysterical paroxysm does. All this shows that the whole nerv- 
ous system is peculiarly influenced by the affection. An attack 
generally comes on with a sensation of choking ; it seems as if 
a ball were rising in the throat and threatening to stop the 
passage of the air ; then the trunk and limbs become strongly 
convulsed, so much so that an apparently feeble woman will 
require three or four strong persons to restrain her from injur- 
ing herself; then follows the hysterical sobbing and crying, 
with alternate fits of laughter ; generally the head is thrown 
back, the face flushed, the eyelids closed and tremulous ; the 
nostrils distended, and the mouth firmly shut ; there is a strong 
movement in the throat, which is projected forward, and a 
wild throwing about of the arms and hands, w-ith sometimes a 
tearing of the hair, rending of the clothes, catching at the 
throat, and attempts to bite those who impose the necessary 
restraint. After awhile, the deep and irregular breathing, the 



The Doctor, mrs. Clarke's cookery book. 361 

obvious palpitation of the heart, with the symptoms above 
enumerated will ctase ; there will be an expulsion of wind up- 
wards, and the patient will sink down, sobbinj;; and sighing, to 
remain tranquil for a shorter or longer period, at the end of 
which she may again start up, and be as vio.ent as ever; or 
she may go off inio a calm sleep, from which she will probably 
awake quite recovered. A fit of Hysteria may last for a few 
minutes only, or for several hours, or even days ; persons have 
died under such an infliction : it may generally be distinguished 
from epilepsy by the absence of foaming at the mouth, which 
is nearly always present in that disease, and also by the pecu- 
liar twinkling of the eyelids, which is a distinguishing symptom 
of great value, and a sign of safety. In epilepsy, too, there is 
complete insensibility, not so in Hysteria ; the patient retains 
a partial consciousness ; hence it behoves those about her to be 
cautious what they say ; if any remedies are suggested of which 
shi is likely to have a dread, her recovery may be greatly re- 
tarded thereby. In epilepsy there is laborious or suspended 
respiration, dark livid complexion, a protruding and bleedino- 
tongue ; rolling or staring and projected eyeballs, and a fright- 
ful expression of countenance. Not so in Hysteria ; the cheeks 
are usually red, and the eyes, if not hidden by the closed eye- 
lids, are bright and at rest ; the sobbing, sighing, short cries, 
and laughter, too, are characteristic of the latter affection. We 
point out these distinctions that no unnecessary alarm may be 
felt during fit of Hysteria, which is seldom attended with 
ultimate danger either to mind or body, although the symptoms 
are sufficiently distressing to cause anxiety. 

Treatment. — The first efforts must be directed to prevent the 
patient, if violent, from injuring herself ; but this should not be 
done in a rude, rough manner. It is, perhaps, best to confine 
her hands, by wrapping tightly round her a sheet or blanket. 
The dress should be loosened, especially round the throat, and 
the face freely exposed to fresh air, and both that and the 
head well washed with cold water ; if she can and will swallow, 
an ounce of Camphor Mixture, witli a teaspoonful of Ether, 
Sal volatile, Tincture of Assafoetida, or Valerian, may be ad- 
ministered ; strong Liquid Ammonia may be applied to the 
nostrils ; and if the fit is of long duration, an Enema injected, 
consisting of Spirits of Turpentine, Castor Oil, and Tincture 
of Assafoetida, of each half an ounce, in half a pint of Gruel. 
What is required is a strong stimulus to the nervous system; 
therefore, dashing cold water on the face, and hot applications 
to the spine, are likely to be of service. Sir A. Carlisle recom- 
mends that a polished piece of steel, held in boiling water for a 



362 MRS. Clarke's cookery book. The Doctor. 

minute or two, be passed down the back over a silk handker- 
chief. This has been found to prevent the recurrence of the 
paroxysm, which has before been periodic ; by which it would 
seem that the patient has some power of controlling the symp- 
toms, when a sufficiently strong stimulus is applied, to enable 
or induce her to exercise it. 

During the intermission < attacks of Hysteria, attention 
should be devoted to any constitutional or organic defects, from 
which they are likely to arise ; the patient's mind should be 
kept as tranquil as possible, and a tendency to all irregular 
habits or excesses held in check ; if plethoric, there should be 
spare diet, and perhaps leeching ; if scrofulous and weakly, 
good nourishing food and tonic medicines, particularly some 
form of Iron, the shower bath, regular exercise, cheerful com- 
pany ; antispasmodics, and remedies which have a gently stim- 
ulating effect, will frequently relieve the sleeplessness com- 
plained of by hysterical patients better than opiates and other 
narcotics. In such cases Dr. Graves recommends pills com- 
posed of a Grain of Musk and two or three Grains of Assafoetida, 
to be taken two or three times a da^. When there is headache, 
dry-cupping at the back of the neck, or between the shoulders, 
will probably be of service. A change in the mode of life, in- 
volving entering upon new cares and duties, will frequently 
effect a complete cure of Hysteria, which, it has been observed, 
seldom attacks women of a vigorous mind. It is extremely de- 
sirable that, in the education of young females, the bodily 
powers should be well exercised and devloped. Too little at- 
tention is paid to this generally, and the consequence is that a 
great many of our young women are weak and nervous, and 
frequently subject to hysterical affections. 

1323. Quinsy- 

Though called tonsillites, the inflammation is rarely confined 
to the tonsils, but involves the pharynx, the soft palate and the 
uvula and sometimes extends to the root of the tongue. It com- 
mences with a feeling of dryness and discomfort about the throat 
and with pain in swallowing. The mucous membrane lining the 
throat is reddened and the tonsils are more or less swollen. As 
the disease advances, the inflamed parts, at first dry, because 
covered with vicid mucous, and the distress of the patient is 
greatly enchanced by the effort which he is tempted to make ♦o 
remove this secretion. In many cases suppuration occurs in one 
or both tonsils ; when this takes places those organs are often 
enormously swollen, and, together with the obstruction of the in- 
flamed palate, may render breathing difficult and painful. In such 



The Doctor, mrs. Clarke's cookery book. ' 363 

cases the febrile reaction is strongly marked,the skin being hot 
and thepulse full and frequent, the patient is unable to take 
nourishi^ent and the voice becomes thick and characteristic of 
the disease. The disease though painful is attended with little 
danger ; but the inflammation may by extension involve the 
larynx, and thus prove fatal. The disease requires but little 
treatment. Where the mucous membrane alone is involved, a 
stringent gargle, repeated five or six times a day, usually gives 
relief. The food should be liquid — (soups, beef tea, milk, etc.,) 
and should be swallowed in large mouthfuls, which give less 
pain than smaller ones. If an abscess forms in either or both 
tonsils the greatest relief is obtained from frequent inhalations 
of warm steam, which acts as a poultice to the inflamed parts. 
As soon as the location of the abscess can be determined, it 
should be opened, after which there is usually no further 
trouble. 

1324. An Ezcellent Eemody for a Cold. 

Take a large tea-cupful of linseed, two pennyworth of stick- 
liquorice, and quarter of a pound of sun raisins. Put these into 
two quarts of soft water, and let it simmer over a slow fire till 
it is reduced to one ; then add to it a quarter of a pound of 
brown sugar-candy (pounded), a table spoonful of old rum, and 
a tablespoonful of the best white-wine vinegar, or lemon-juice. 
Drink half a pint at going to bed, and take a little when the 
cough is troublesome. This receipt generally cures the worst 
of colds in two or three days, and if taken in time, may be 
said to be almost an infallible remedy. It is a most balsamic 
cordial for the lungs, without the opening qualities which en- 
danger fresh colds on going out. It has been known to cure 
colds that have been almost settled into consumption, in lef.s 
thHn three weeks. The rum and vinegar are best to be added 
only to the quantity you are going immediately to take ; for, 
if it is put into the whole it is apt to grow flat. 

1325. Cold. 

The symptoms o^ a. cold are familiar to most persons, for there 
are few who have not experienced them ; as a general rule the 
treatment should be av'oidance of exposure to out-of-door at- 
mospheric influences, unless the weather be very fine and mild; 
warm diluent drinks and diaphoretics at night to promote per- 
spiration, with the use of the foot bath. The saying runs, 
" feed a cold and starve a fever," but this is not always the safe 
course ; If there is an absence of febrile symptons, which is 
rarely the case, a warm nourishing diet may be the rule, and 



364 MRS. Clarke's cookery book. The Doctor. 

medicines may be pretty nearly dispensed with, but if these 
symptons are present, the system must be reduced by low diet 
and aperient medicines ; two grains of Calomel, with ten grains 
of Dover's Powder should be given at bed-time, and a Senna 
draught in the morning, taking, during the day, a mixture like 
this : Sulphate of Magnesia, two drachma ; Sweet Spirits of 
Nitre, two drachms ; Wine of Tartarized Antimony, one 
drachm ; Liquor of Acetate of Ammonia, six ounces ; take a 
tablespoonful every four hours. A high medical authority has 
recently recommended a total abstinence from liquids, he says: — 
"To those who have the resolution to bear the feelings of thirst 
for thirty-aix or forty-eight hours, we can promise a pretty cer- 
tain and complete riddance of their colds ; and, what is per- 
haps more important, a prevention of those coughs which com- 
monly succeed them. Nor is the suftering from thirst nearly 
so great as might be expected." It is Dr. C. J. Williams who 
writes thus : — " We have never witnessed any evil from this 
abstinence from liquors for the time prescribed ; but it is not 
unlikely that it may do harm in persons with irritable stomachs; 
or in those liable to urinary disorders. Moderation in liquid 
food is one of the best preventives against the bad effects of 
exposure to cold. When there is a large quantity of liquid in 
the system there must be increased perspiration, and, there- 
fore, greater risk from the effect of cold." We mention this 
new light thrown on the subject of treatment for cold, without 
fully recommending its adoption, having tested the opposite 
method and found it efficacions ; it might do in some cases, 
but not, we apprehend, in the great majority. For directions 
for the treatment of cough and other concomitants of cold, see 
cough. 

1326. Colds (How to prevent). 

The Popular Science Monthly gives good advice in regard to 
the prevention of colds. The mistake is often made of not 
taking great care to put on extra wraps and coats when pre- 
paring for outdoor exercise. This is not at all necessary in 
robust persons. Sufficient heat to prevent all risk of chill is 
generated in the body by exercise. The care should be taken 
to retain sufficient clothing after exercise, and when at rest, to 
prevent the heat passing out of the body. Indeed, persons 
very often catch chills from throwing off extra clothing after 
exercise, or from sitting about in garments the material of 
which is not adapted to prevent the radiation of heat from the 
body. 



The Doctor, mrs. clarke's cookery book. 365 

1327. OOTlffll. 

A convulsive effort of the lungs to get relief of phlegm 01 
other matter ; it may be a sympton of Bronchitis, or Catarrh, 
or Croup, or Influenza, or Laryne^itis, or Phthisis, or Pleurisy, 
or Pneumonia, or Relaxed Uvula, also Hooping Cough. 

We can here lay down but a few general principles with re- 
gard to the treatment of simple cough without reference to the 
peculiar disease of which it may be symptomatic ; and first let 
us observe, that it may be either what is properly, as well as 
medically, termed dry or moist. In the former case, Opium 
and its preparations, are advisable, in the latter they should 
not be used ; the irritation will be best allayed by Henbane or 
Hemlock, either the Tincture or Extract, with demulcents, as 
Barley Water, Linseed-tea, etc., and Liquorice, either the Root 
boiled, or Extract ; it is well also to add from five to ten drops 
ol Ipecacuanha Wine to each dose ; inhalation also of the 
steam from boiling water will generally be found beneficial — 
and especially if some medicinal herb, such as Horehound or 
Coltsfoot, be infused in it. In moist coughs there should not 
be so much fluid taken, and the use of demulcents must be 
somewhat restricted. Opiates may be administered, but not 
too freely, either separately, or in cough mixtures ; Paregoric 
Elixir, in which the Opium is combined with Benzoic Acid and 
Oil of Aniseed (expectorants), and Camphor (antispasmodic), 
is perhaps the best form of administration ; a teaspoonful in a 
glass of water, generally allays the irritation, and frequent desire 
to cough which arises from it. In cases where there is difficulty 
of expectoration, some such mixture as this should be taken: — 
Compound Tincture of Camphor, four drachms ; Ipecacuanha 
Wine, and Oxymel of Squills, of each two drachms ; Mucilage 
of Acacia, one ounce ; Water, four ounces, mix and take a 
tablespoonful when the cough is troublesome ; for old people, 
two drachms of Tincture of Benzoin, commonly called Friar's 
Balsam, may be added to the above; and if there should be 
much fever, two drachms of Sweet Spirits of Nitre. For all 
kinds of cough counter irritants should be applied, such as 
blisters and warm plasters, rubbing in of stimulant ointments 
on the chest and between the shoulders ; those parts also 
should be well protected by flannels next the skin, dressed 
hare skin and other contrivances of the kind. For coughs 
which are more particularly troublesome by night, it is best to 
give the Opium, Hebane, or Hemlock, as the case may be, 
at bedtime, in the shape of a pill; of the Extracts of either of 
the latter, five grains may be given ; of the first, one or two 



366 MRS. Clarke's cookery book. The Doctor. 

grains of the Gum, or a quarter of a grain of Morphine. A 
long experience of their efficacy among a large number of dis- 
pensary patients enables the author to recommend with con- 
fidence the following pills ; take of Compound Squill Pill, one 
drachm ; Ipecacuanha Powder and Extract of Hyoscyamus, of 
each, half a drachm ; mix and make into twenty-four pills, 
take one or two on going to rest. 

Very frequently febrile symptoms accompany coughs, and 
then afulldiet is not advisable, and stimulants must be avoided. 
Great relief is often afforded by the use of the warm foot bath, 
and warm gruel, with a ten grain Dover's Powder after the 
patient is in bed ; then plenty of covering to encourage pers- 
piration. Coughs should never be neglected, they are so fre- 
quently symptomatic of organic disease; if they do not yield to 
simple remedies, let medical advice be sought, whether the 
patient be old or young. See Colds. 

1328. Headache- 
Headache may arise from a variety of causes ; consequently 
the preventive measures vary according to the nature of the 
attack. When it isof that kind which is dependent on rheum- 
atism, and which affects the muscles, extending often from the 
forehead to the back, and sometimes involving the temples, 
the patient should be as much as possible in the open air, and 
should use the shower-bath every morning. When the form 
of headache is accompanied with tenderness of the scalp, and 
acute pain on pressure, indicating an affection of the immedi- 
ate covering of the bones, — besides exercise in the open air, 
the head should be shaved, and washed twice a day, namely, 
morning and evening, with cold water, and afterwards gently 
rubbed with a towel for ten or fifteen minutes. The residence 
should be in a dry, somewhat elevated situation ; and quietude 
of mind should be maintained. When the pain in the forehead 
and the back of the head is obtuse, and accompanied with a 
sensation of torpor and oppression ; and when this occurs in 
weak and irritable persons, besides the necessary medical 
treatment, which ought not to be neglected, all mental appli- 
cations should be suspended, and cheerful society culti- 
vated ; the diet should be moderate, and the utmost attention 
paid to the state of the bowels. Exercise and shower-baths 
are as essential in this as in the other varieties of the head- 
ache. Lastly, in what is usually termed sick headache, den- 
oted by either acute or dull pain over the left temple, with some 
tenderness of the part, throbbing, and an incapacity at the 
time for any mental exertion, the whole arising generally from 



The Doctor, mrs. clarke's cookery book. 367 



indigestion, or some error in diet previous to the occurrence 
of the headache, it is scarcely necessary to say that prudence 
in diet, both with respect to quantity and quality, should be 
observed. Long fasting, excess of wine or any stimulant, pro- 
tracted sedentary occupations, hurry of business and anxiety, 
should be known to be exciting causes, and, consequently, as 
far as possible, avoided by those predisposed to sick headaches; 
in a few words, the duty of the head and the feet should be 
equally balanced. Proper diet and exercise, cheerfulness of 
mind, and agreeable sociable intercourse, will do more to reg- 
ulate the stomach and bowels, in those predisposed to this 
form of headache, than any plan of medical treatment which 
can be suggested. 

1329. Ceplialic Snuff. 

Lundyfoot snufFand as-abaracca leaves, of each two ounces; 
lavender flowers, two drachms ; essence of bergamot and oil of 
cloves, of each four drops. Grind the lavender with the snutT 
and leaves to a fine powder ; then add the perfume. Much 
recommended in headaches, dimness of sight, &c. 

1330. Bilious or Sick Eeadache. 

Headache is, in general, a symptom of indigestion, or der- 
anged general health, or in consequence of a confined state of 
the bowels. The following alterative pill will be found a val- 
uable medicine : — Take of calomel, ten grains ; emetic tartar, 
two, three, or four grains ; precipitated sulphuret of antimony, 
one scruple ; guaiacum in powder, one drachm. Rub them 
well together in a mortar for ten minutes, then, with a little 
conserve of hips, make them into a mass, and divide it into 
twenty pills. Dose. — One pill is given every night, or every 
other night, for several weeks in succession. 

1331. Eiccouerii- 

This may usually be removed by the exhibition of warm car- 
minatives, cordials, cold water, weak spirits, camphor julep, or 
spirits of sal volatile. A sudden fright or surprise will often 
produce the like efTect. An instance is recorded of a delicate 
young lady that was troubled with hiccough for some months, 
and who was reduced to a state of extreme debility from the 
loss of sleep occasioned thereby, who was cured by a fright, 
after medicines and topical applications had failed. A pinch 
of snuff, a glass of cold soda-water, or an ice-cream will also 
frequently remove this complaint.

1332. Cramp. 

When cramp occurs in the limbs, warm friction with the 
naked hand, or with the following stimulating liniment, will 
generally be found to succeed in removing it : 

The Ltniment, — Take of water of ammonia, or of spirit of 
hartshorn, one ounce; olive oil, two ounces. Shake them to- 
gether till they unite. 

When the stomach is affected, brandy, ether, laudanum, or 
tincture of ginger affords the speediest means of cure. The 
following draught may be taken with great advantage :-- 
Laudanum, forty or fifty drops ; tincture of ginger, two 
drachms ; syrup of poppies, one drachm ; cinnamon or mint 
water, one ounce. Mix for a draught. To be repeated in an 
hour, if necessary. 

In severe cases, hot flannels, moistened with compound 
camphor liniment and turpentine, or a bladder nearly filli-d 
with hot water, at 100 deg. or 120 deg. Fahr., should be applied 
to the pit of the stomach ; bathing the feet in warm water, or 
applying a mustard poultice to them, is frequently of great 
advantage. 

*^* The best preventives, when the cause of cramp is con- 
stitutional, are warm tonics, such as the essence of ginger and 
camomile, Jamaica ginger in powder, &c., avoiding fermented 
liquors and green vegetables, especially for supper, and wear- 
ing flannel next to the skin. 

1333. iTeuralgria (G-reek neuron, a nerve, and aigos, pain)- 

A painful affection of the nerves : when it occurs in those 
of the face, it is termed face-ague^ or tic-doloretix ; when it af- 
fects the great nerve of the lej>, it is called sciatica ; other parts, 
such as tiie fingers, the chest, the abdomen, &c., are also lia- 
ble to this agonizing pain, one of the most severe and wearing 
to which the human frame is liable ; the exact nature of it is 
not very clear, that is to say, the origin of the disease, for al- 
though its immediate seat is a nerve, or set of nerves, yet there 
must be some originating cause. It can frequently be traced 
to some decay, or diseased growth of the bone about those 
parts through which the nerves pass ; and in some severe cases 
i' has been found to depend upon the irritation caused by 
foreign bodies acting upon those highly sensitive organs. The 
only symptom of Neuralgia generally, is a violent plunging and 
darting pain, which comes on in paroxysms ; except in very 
severe and protracted cases, there is no outward redness nor 
swelling to mark the seat of the pain, neither is there usually 



The Doctor, mrs. clarke's cookery book. 369 

constitutional derangement, other than that which may be 
caused by want of rest, and the extreme agony of the suffering 
while it lasts, which may be from one to two or three hours, or 
even more, but it is not commonly so long. Tenderness and 
swelling of the part sometimes occurs, where there has been a 
frequent recurrence and long continuance of the pain, which 
leaves the patient, in most cases, as suddenly as it comes on ; 
its periodic returns and remissions, and absence of inflamma- 
tory symptoms, are distinctive marks of the disease. Among 
its exciting causes, we may mention exposure to damp and 
cold, especially if combmed with malaria ; and to these influ- 
ences a perso ■ with a debilitated constitution will be more sub- 
ject than another. Anxiety of mind will sometimes brmj; it on, 
and so will a disordered state of the stomach, more paiiicularly 
a state in which there is too much acid. 

As for treatmetit, that, of course, must depend upon the cause ; 
if it is a decayed tooth, which, by its exposure of the nerve to 
the action of the atmosphere, sets up this pain, it should be at 
once removed, as there will be little peace for the patient until 
there is ; if co-existent with Neuralgia there is a disordered 
stomach, suspicion should at once point thereto, and efforts 
should be made to correct the disorder there. If the patient is 
living in a moist, low situation, he should at once be removed 
to a higher level, and a dry, gravelly soil. Tonics, such as 
Quinine and Iron, should be given, and a tolerably generous 
diet, but without excess of any kind. In facial Neuralgia, 
blisters behind the ears, or at the back of the neck, have been 
found serviceable and, if the course of the nerve which appears 
to be the seat of mischief can be traced, a Belladonna plaster 
or a piece of rag soaked in Laudanum and laid along it, will 
sometimes give relief ; so will hot fomentations of poppies and 
camomiles, or bran poultices sprinkled with turpentine. In 
very severe cases ^ of a grain of Morphine may be givfn to 
deaden the nervous sensibility, and induce sleep, which the 
patient is often deprived of at night, the pain coming on as 
soon as he gets warm in bed. Sir Charles Bell's remedy for 
obstinate cases was i or 2 drops of Croton Oil, mixed with 
one drachm of Coiocynth Pill, divided into twelve. Weakly 
persons, however, must not venture upon taking this powerml 
remedy. 

An application of Chloroform on lint has sometimes proved 
very effectual in relieving severe Neuralgic pains, and so has 
aQ ointment composed of Lard and Veratrine, in the propor- 
tion of six grains to the ounce. 



37° MRS. Clarke's cookery book. The Doctor. 



A mixture of Chloroform and Aconite has been recommended 
for facial Neuralgia, the form of preparation being two parts of 
Spirits of Wine, or Eau de Cologne, one of Chloroform, and 
one of Tincture of Aconite, to be applied to the gums of the 
side affected, by means of a finger covered with a piece of 
lint, or soft linen, and rubbed along them ; the danger of drop- 
ping any into the mouth being thus avoided. When the pain 
is connected with some organic disease, as a decayed tooth, 
or chronic inflammation of the gums, or of the sockets or super- 
ficial necrosis of the bone, substitute Tincture of Iodine for 
the Spirit in the above formula. We would caution our readers 
strongly against the careless inhalation of Chloroform as a 
remedy for Neuralgia, which appears to be growing into a 
general practice ; several deaths have resulted from it, the 
practice being to pour a little on a pocket handkerchief, with- 
out much regard to quantity, ana hold it to the mouth until the 
required insensibility is produced. 'This remedy should never 
be administered, except under the supervision of a medical ad- 
viser. People at all liable to this painful affection should be 
extremely careful not to expose themselves to wet or cold : 
above all to avoid draughts. A very slight cause will often 
bring it on where there is the slightest tendency to it 

1334. Group. 

On the first appearance of croup, a teaspoonful of the fol- 
lowing mixture : — Ipecacuanha wine, half an ounce ; tartaric 
emetic, one grain ; distilled water, half an ounce. Mix, 
Should be immediately given, and repeated every ten minutes, 
until it excites vomiting. After its operation the child should 
be put in a warm bath, for ten to fifteen minutes, and a dose 
of calomel and James's powder given. If relief be not ob- 
tained from these measures, the entire throat should be cov- 
ered with leeches, say eight or ten, and the bowels emptied by 
the following injection : — Take of common turpentine two 
drachms, beat it up with the yolk of an egg, and add by de- 
grees half a pint of decoction of chamomile flowers, in which 
an ounce of glaubar salts has been dissolved ; strain it, and 
divide it into two equal parts, one of which is to be admin- 
istered night and morning. If the alarming symptoms are not 
checked in twelve hours, the warm bath is to be repeated, and 
calomel, in doses of from three to five grains, with three 
grains of James's powder in each, should be given every third 
hour. 

If a child recover from the attack of croup, every affection 



The Doctor, mrs. Clarke's cookery book. 371 

of the chest or lungs should be considered as important ; it 
should, therefore, be carefully guarded against cold, especially 
in damp weather, for which purpose the child should wear a 
chamois leather waistcoat next the skin, made to cover tlie 
neck and great attention be paid to the stomach and bowels, 
A child having been once attacked with croup is very liable to 
its return from any slis^ht exposure to cold. 

1335. Treatment of Bunions- 

This consists in removing all pressure from the part. The 
formation of a bunion may in the beginning be prevented, but 
only in the beginning ; for when actually formed, it is scarcely 
possible ever to get rid of it, and it remains an everlasting 
plague. To prevent the formation of a bunion, it is necessary 
whenever or wherever a boot or shoe pinches, to have it eased 
at once, and so long as that part of the foot pinched remains 
tender, not to put on the offending shoe again. When a bun- 
ion has once completely formeH, if the person wish to have 
any peace, and not to have it increase, he must have a last 
made to fit his foot, and have his shoe made upon it. And 
whenever the bunion inflames, and is painful, it must be 
bathed with warm water and poulticed at night. 

1336. Sty©. 

The stye is strictly only a little boil which projects from the 
edge ofr the eyelid. It is of a dark red color, much inflamed, 
and occasionally a great deal more painful than might be ex- 
pected, considering iia small size. It usually disappears of 
itself, after a little time, especially if some purgative medicine 
be taken. 

If the stye be very painful and inflamed, a small warm poul- 
tice o( linseed meal, or bread and milk, must be laid over it, 
and renewed every five or six hours, and the bowels freely 
acted upon by a purgative draught, such as the following : — 
Take of Epsom salts, half an ounce ; best manna, two 
drachms ; infusion of senna, six drachms ; tincture of senna, 
two drachms; spearmint water, one ounce; distilled water, 
two ounces. Mix ; and take three, four, or five tablespoonfuis. 

When the stye appears ripe, an opening should be made into 
it with the point of a large needle, and afterwards a little of the 
following ointment may be smeared over it once or twice a 
day. Ointment. — Take of spermaceti, six drachms; white 
wax, two drachms : olive oil, three ounces. Melt them to- 
gether over a slow fire, and stir them constantly until they are 
cold. 



372 MRS. Clarke's cookery book. The Doctor. 

1337. Tor Inflamedl or "Weak Eyes (i). 

Half fill a bottle with common rock salt; add the best of 
French brandy till all but full. Shake it, let it settle, and bathe 
the outside of the eye with a soft linen cloth on going to bed 
and occasionally through the day. This will be found a good 
application for pains and bruises generally. 

1338. Another way (2). 

Mix a few bread crumbs with the white of an egg, put it in 
a bag of white muslin, and apply it to the eye. It is best ap- 
plied at night or when lying down. After removing the poul- 
tice bathe the eye with warm water, using a piece of soft rag, 
not a sponge. 

1339. Doficleacy of Wax In the Ear- 
Deafness is sometimes the consequence ot a morbidiv dry 
state of the inner passages of the ear. In such cases, mtro- 
duce a piece of cotton wool, dipped in an equal mixture ofoil of 
turpentine and oil of almonds, or in the liniment of carbonate 
of ammonia. 

1340. Aconmnlation of "Wax In the Ear. 

To remedy this, which is a very frequent cause of deafness, 
introduce a small piece of cotton wool, upon which a little oil 
of almonds has been dropped, into the ear, and let it remain 
there for a day or two. Then syringe the ear with a little 
warm milk and water, or a solution of soap or with a solution 
of common salt and water, in the proportion of two drachms of 
the former to half an ounce of the latter. The solution of salt 
is the best solvent of accumulated wax in the ear. 

1341. To remove Nervous Anxiety- 
Keep the bowels regular with mild purgatives, take plenty of 
exercise in the open air, adopt a light nutritious diet, and seek 
pleasant society. A teaspoonful of carbonate of soda, or of 
magnesia, or a few drops of laudanum taken the last thing at 
night, will generally have the effect ol preventing watchfulness. 

1342. Hysterics. 

AssafcEtida, one drachm ; peppermint water, one ounce and 
a half; ammoniated tincture of valerian, two drachms; sul- 
phuric ether, two drachms. Mix. A dose of this mixture is a 
tablespoonful every second hour. 



IHEUOCTOR. MRS. CLARKE'S COOKERY BOOK. 373 



1343. To Froduce Ferspir&tion- 

Twelve drachms of antimonial wine and two drachms of 
laudanum. Of this mixture eighteen drops may be taken in 
water every five or six hours. 

1344. Lotion to remove Freckles- 
Mix two ounces of rectified spirits of wine, add two teaspoon- 
fuls of muriatic acid, with one pound and a half of distilled 
water. 

1345. Ointment for Chilljlains. 

Calomel and camphor, of each two drachms ; spermaceti 
ointment, eight drachms ; oil of turpentine, four drachms. Mix 
well together. Apply, by gentle friction, two or thiee times 
daily. 

1346. To raise a Blister Speedily- 

Apiece of lint dropped into vinegar of cantharides, and im- 
mediately after its application to the skin covered over with a 
piece of strapping to prevent evaporation. 

1347. Dyspepsia, Heartlsurn, and Acidity. 

Pure water, five ounces ; carbonate of ammonia, 3 drachms ; 
syrup of orange peel, one ounce. Mix. For a six-ounce mix- 
ture. 

1348. Warming Plaster. 

Burgundy pitch, seven parts, melt and add plaster of can- 
tharides, one part. Some add a little camphor. Used in chest 
complaints, local pains, etc. 

1349. Eules for the Preservation of Healtli. 

Adopt the plan of rising early, and never sit up late at night. 

Wash the whole body every morning with cold water, by 
means of a large sponge, and rub it dry with a rough towel, or 
scrub the whole body for ten or fifteen minutes with flesh- 
brushes. 

Drink waters generally, and avoid excess of spirits, wine, 
and fermented liquors. 

Sleep in a room which has free access to the open air, and is 
well ventilated. 

Keep the head cool by washing it with cold water when nec- 
essary, and abate feverish and inflammatory symptoms when 
they arise, by persevering stillness. 



374 MRS. Clarke's cookery book. The Doctor. 

Symptoms of plethora and indigestion may be corrected by 
eating and drinking less per diem for a short time. 

Never eat a hearty supper, especially of animal food ; and 
drink wine, spirits, and beer only after dinner. 

Exercise regularly adopted conduces to preserve the health 
and should always be taken by those who value so inestimabU 
a blessing.
