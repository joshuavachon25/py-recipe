INTRODUCTORY 

The purpose of this book is to teach the art of Good Cooking and to encourage 
the science of Good Living; the accomplishment of which is destined to be the 
crowning glory of woman. 

The pleasures and satisfaction in life are not mere living, but Good Living. All 
the necessaries and luxuries making up the sum of good living will receive con- 
sideration and mention in the following pages. 









m 






Much space will be devoted to the art of cooking and serving Good Things to ^S 

Eat and to the recommendation of the very best material and ingredients to use in ^ 

their preparation as well as the best implements and utensils to be employed in the k| 

work. lii 

Everything mentioned in this book has been selected on account of its general 

utility as being best adapted to the use of the small family. 

/ 

In addition to the provision for all wants of the inner man, special attention will 
be given to all those things which contribute to personal comforts and bodily 
necessities. 

Hygiene and Sanitation, the requisites to Good Health and Long Life, will be 
given consideration with special reference to the care of the body. 

It is to the housekeeper that we appeal direct ; no matter what her training may 
have been or what her experience and knowledge may be, we shall hope to present 
to her in the following pages all those things which tend to the best housekeeping 
and riiake of those duties rather a pleasure than a burden. 

Every housekeeper has learned to her cost that there are two kinds of recipes, ^ 
the practical and the theoretical. In this book will be found the practical, those ^ 
that have been tried, tested and that will work out. ^ 

Up to within the past few years Household Economy received but little con- 
sideration, notwithstanding it had its beginning at the "dawn of human history" 
and is now an exact science. 



Economy does not mean spending a small amount, but getting the largest returns 
from the money expended; money is not the only thing to be considered in the 
economy of the home and which must be judiciously handled, time is equally 
valuable, yet how few persons appreciate the value of time.

^%s 



We hear many complain of having worked hard all day and having accomplished 
nothing and that they are completely worn out; that is the result, generally, of 
lack of order and system. If you are familiar with your duties it is easy to apportion 
your- time, and as you become more famiHar with the routine of your duties, before 
you know it you are saving time. 

The wise housewife divides her time, even as the twenty-four inch gauge is 
divided, thus, she has a titne for everything, a place for everything and everything 
in its place ; the result is order, system and economy. 

She assigns certain hours for meals and she requires they be conformed to, other- v^ 

wise the routine of the house would be interfered with, confusion would result, to ^ 

say nothing of the food being over-cooked or served cold, than which nothing tends ^ 

more quickly to discourage the housekeeper. ^ 

n 

Do not make the common error of attempting too much; it is better to do a little ^ 

at a time and do that little well. Experience must teach you how best to arrange all ^S 

those things needed in your housekeeping, so that you will be required to take the ^ 

fewest number of steps. Order will add home comfort and beauty to your estab- ^ 

lishment and sweeten your daily life. ^ 



See that your kitchen fire be bright. 
And your hands be neat and skilled. 

For the love of a man oft takes to flight. 
If his stomach be not well filled.

SUGGESTIONS 



n 



The furnishings of the home should, in a measure, comform to the character of the 
house itself. It shotild not be over-furnished, for in that case in evinces bad taste 
and shows extravagance. 

Too often when it comes to furnishing the home, the useful is sacrificed to the 
aesthetic or the ornamental; the kitchen, the most important room in the house, 
being neglected or treated in a perfunctory manner. 

in visiting a house, apartments or rooms, with a view to leasing or renting them, 
probably the first thing critically examined by the housekeeper is the kitchen; 
first as to its size, then as to its surroundings relative to the other rooms in the 
house and, finally, as to its arrangement. 

The kitchen should be beautiful in its cleanliness and in its perfect arrangements. 
There should be as much light as possible. Wall and floor coverings shotdd har- 
monize, and it is even possible to include the common utensils in a color scheme for 
the reason that they can be purchased in a great variety of shades. 

The dining room can be made to fill the purpose of living or sitting room, if need 
be ; but it should be fitted with the necessary table and chairs. It should have a 
side-board or buffet, china closet and, if possible, a linen closet wherein may be 
stored all the table linen. 

Coming back to the kitchen and to the actual needs of that apartment, we will 
say primarily that those needs should be governed by your means, since the longer 
the purse the more elaborate and fully equipped can be the kitchen; however, 
for daily use, certain articles and a certain number of them, will be found sufficient 
for any housekeeper. The greater the number of culinary utensils, the greater 
the labor and care entailed. This should be avoided as much as possible, partic- 
ularly when one must do the work oneself. 

THE HOUSEKEEPER SHOULD 

First of all, select a good coal or gas range. Let it not be too large, but above all, 
buy the best make. If a gas range be beyond your means there are gas stoves, 
such as are used for ironing purposes, which may be bought very reasonably, and 
with them can be used a portable oven. This same oven can also be used with 
the two or more burner gasoline or alcohol stoves, where gas is not to be had. 

Be careful to buy utensils of a size small enough, except those to be used in case 
of company when the overfilling or use of too many small dishes is often annoi^ng 
and confusing. One should have for daily use one small coffee pot, one earthen 
teapot, one large water kettle with spout, two or three small pots with covers for 
vegetables, two small skillets and covers, one cake griddle and two small roasting 
pans. Add to these one large coffee pot, two large pots with covers, one large

skillet and one large roasting pan, a set of muffin rings, two large and two smaller 
sized pie pans, two jelly moulds and one cake pan, six graniteware pans ranging 
from one large to two medium and three small sizes, one medium and one small sized 
earthenware crock. 

A kitchen table, a kitchen closet or cabinet, two kitchen chairs, one dish pan, 
one soap holder, several plain water glasses, a flour bin, a flour sieve, a bread or 
cake box, a baking board, a bread board (on which to slice bread), a scale, a coffee 
grinder, a meat grinder and a small meat saw, a roller towel holder and a dish 
towel holder, a spice cabinet, a lemon squeezer, an :ce pick, a potato masher, a 
rolling pin, a .can opener, a cork screw, a soup and tea strainer, a fruit press, a 
funnel, one graduated quart measure, two egg beaters, two graters (a large and a 
small one), half dozen each kitchen tablespoons and teaspoons, two large cooking 
spoons, one cake turner, one ladle, one spatula, one carving or butcher knife, two 
small steel paring knives and a knife sharpener, one large and one small fork, 
two jars for drippings, one lard crock, one covered butter crock, shakers for pow- 
dered sugar, salt and pepper, also a tea and a coffee can with close fitting lids. 

As tin cans or earthen jars labeled for sugar, coffee, tea and all cereals and spices 
can be had in so many sizes, there should be no reason for keeping anything in paper 
bags; enough warning cannot be given to avoid having any articles lying around, 
because they will not only deteriorate, but will draw roaches, mice and ants. 

Dust pan and brush, broom, scrub brush and bucket must also be added, although 
these do not properly belong to the kitchen. Many, many more things may and 
perhaps must be added as the need arises; these are only a foundation, yet it is 
far wiser to make the every-day utensils serve many purposes, than to overstock 
your kitchen with things that you will only use once in a while. 

The mistake is often made by choosing a small ice box with a view to saving ice. 
Unless of the best standard make, the very small boxes are always more cheaply 
made and poorly lined, and therefore melt the ice more rapidly. The more modem 
flats and apartments are usually furnished with ice boxes and ranges, whereby quite 
an item is saved, but the average three and four-room apartments, renting for more 
moderate stmis, still require that the tenant furnish them. 

When laying in supplies, it pays to buy a little larger quantities, especially of 
the so-called dry articles, such as sugar, coffee, flour, etc. Not only does one buy 
more cheaply as a rule, but one avoids that pernicious habit of being out of things 
when needed. Watch your supplies so they do not get too low; rather buy a little 
too much and have it on hand, than need a thing badly just as you are about to 
cook a dish. 






Flour by the small sack, sugar by the ten-pound package, coffee, tea, etc., by 
the pound. Dried fruits, beans, macaroni, rice, barley, sago, tapioca, etc., keep 
for a long time, especially if kept in a dry, cool place. It is a good plan to always

keep on hand several cans of peas, com, tomatoes, salmon and fruit, so that in 
case of emergency or extra company you will be prepared. Soap and soap powders 
can be kept a long while, soap especially drying out and improving with age. 

Meats had better be bought in small quantities, unless the left-overs can be 
planned into tasty dishes for immediate use. 

Butter and lard can be bought in 1 and 2 pound quantities, if kept in tightly 
closed receptacles ; but if not properly kept they quickly absorb odors and become 
strong. If one has the room it is economical to buy potatoes by the bushel and 
apples by the peck.

CEREALS 

The reason for the extensive use of cereal foods in not hard to find; they contain 
large proportions of the necessary food ingredients with a very small proportion 
of refuse. They are also readily prepared for the table, and are palatable and 
easily digested. 

There are a great variety of ready-to-eat cereals, very convenient, wholesome 
and economical. 

As a diet, cereal foods are of much value for young children, also for the aged. 
When properly cooked they are soft and easily taken care of in the digestive tract ; 
they are preferable to more hardy foods and their use is certainly rational. 

In invalid dietetics cereal foods are, we might say, indispensable. The standard 
flours, meals and the modem prepared breakfast and special cereal foods all find 
their place, either when cooked in ordinary ways or prepared as gruels or other 
special dishes. 



All things considered, cereal foods as a class are nutritious, convenient, economical 
and worthy of an important place in the dietary scheme when judiciously combined 
with other foods.

Soups are not only nourishing but are useful as stimulants. They help to create 
appetite and start the digestive juices preparatory to receiving and digesting the 
solid foods. As an economical matter, soup is a rare vehicle for disposing of many 
of the left-overs both in meat and vegetables. Soups are rendered more nutritious 
by the addition of vegetables and small cubes of meat. In cold weather the thick 
soups should be given the preference, but in the spring and early summer, vegetable 
soups should dominate. 

All meats for soup, whether brisket, neck, joints or bone, should first be washed, 
then trimmed if too fat, put in cold water and allowed to stand about 15 minutes; 
then bring to a boil, add salt, skim and allow to cook slowly for at least 2 hours, 
then vegetables and seasoning may be added and allowed J to | hour longer boiling. 
Strain if only a clear broth is wanted, else mash vegetables through strainer when 
done, and if a thicker soup is wanted, add noodles, dumplings, rice, etc. 

Clear broth will keep quite a while if kept in a cool place and forms the foun-

In the economy of the household, fish plays an important part; and has come to 
be regarded as a very valuable food material, whether taken from the salt seas or 
from the fresh waters of the lakes or rivers. 

Fish as a food is cheaper than meat ; it is not quite so nourishing, but is usually 
easier of digestion. Fish are either white, or dark and oily in appearance. Dark 
fish have the oil distributed throughout the body, making the flesh dark colored, 
such as salmon, bluefish, mackerel and herring; white fish, like cod, haddock, 
trout, smelt or perch, have the fat secreted in the liver. 

Fish should not be eaten unless fresh, otherwise it is poisonous. When purchas- 
ing always choose fish that are in season. To determine freshness, examine the 
flesh, it should be firm, the eyes and gills should be bright. On account of its 
strong odor it should not be put in the ice box unless closely covered or wrapped. 

COD is one of the most prolific of the salt water fish ; on this account, and because 
of its cheapness and easy procurability, it forms from an economical standpoint 
one of the most important of fish foods. Large cod are cut in steaks. The skin 
of cod is white, heavily mottled with gray, and has a white line running the entire 
length of the fish on either side. Cod is in season the entire year. Those with 
small heads and thick necks are the best. 

HADDOCK is closely allied to codfish, though it is smaller and differently 
mottled. The distinguishing mark of haddock is a black line running the entire 
length of fish on either side. Like cod, it is cheap and in season all the year, but 
is best in October. Haddock when dried, smoked and salted is known as Finnan 
Haddie. 

HALIBUT is the largest of the fiat fish family, the skin on the under side being 
white, on the upper light or dark gray. Halibut is in season all the year. 

Turbot is the finest of salt water fish, similar to Halibut, but smaller and of 
more delicate flavor. Turbot is in season from January until March. 



SMELTS are small salt water fish and are sold by the pound. In season from 
July until February. 

FRESH WATER FISH 

^ TROUT vary in size and skin coloring. Lake trout are largest. 

SALMON TROUT is the name applied to trout caught in the Great Lakes.

BROOK TROUT are caught in brooks and small lakes ; they are superior eating, 
but expensive. Trout is in season from April until August. 

WHITE FISH is the finest fish found in the Great Lakes. 

SALMON is both a fresh and salt water fish, of pinkish orange color and weighing 
from 15 to 25 pounds. They are in season from May to September. 

SHAD is a fresh and a salt water fish. It is a silvery hue which becomes bluish 
upon the back. Jack Shad are cheaper than Roe Shad. They are in season from 
January to June. 

CAVIAR is the salted roe of the sturgeon caught in Russia. 

HERRING is usually smoked and salted. 

TO CLEAN FISH 

Fish are usually cleaned at the market, but should be gone over carefully before 
cooking. Scrape any scales which have not been taken off, by drawing a knife 
over the fish from tail towards the head. Wash fish or wipe carefully, with cloth 
wrung out in cold water; remove any clotted blood adhering to backbone. 



m 



n 






TO BROIL FISH 

Clean the fish thoroughly and wipe dry. Slices of large fish may be broiled ; small 
fish should be split down the back and broiled whole. Place the slices or split 
fish in a well greased broiler; first broil the flesh side then the skin side, turning 
often. When broiled, dot with butter and season with salt and pepper before 
serving. 

The more oily fish, those with dark flesh, are used for broiling; when the drier 
varieties are used, they should when broiled be spread with butter sprinkled with 
lemon juice and well seasoned before serving. 

Among the most delicate fish for broiling are lake or salmon trout and white fish, 
which are fresh water fish from "the Great Lakes, in season during the winter. 
Salmon, blue fish, shad, fresh mackerel, butter fish, sea trout, halibut, cod and 
salmon steak are good for broiling. 

TO FRY FISH 

Large fish are sliced; if small, split down the back and fry whole. Clean the fish 
thoroughly and wipe dry. Dip in well-beaten yolk of egg, then fine bread crumbs, 
flour or com meal ; pat the crumbs or meal on well so that same does not fall off 
and bum in the fat. To make extra nice, dip into the egg and bread crumbs or 
meal a second time before frying. Fry to a golden brown color in boiling lard, 
remove, drain well and serve hot. 

Small fish, like brook trout, smelts, perch, pickerel, crappie and bass, are usually 
fried whole or split, while cod, halibut, haddock, flounders, sole, etc., are cut in 
slices, steaks or fillets when fried.

TO BAKE FISH 

Clean the fish thoroughly and wipe dry. If it is to be stuffed, prepare the stuffing, 
place it in the fish and sew shut with white thread. Lay it in a well-greased pan, 
dredge with flour and dot with drippings or bacon fat. If the oven is very hot, 
cover the fish with a greased paper (cut to fit the pan) during the first part of the 
baking to prevent scorching; baste frequently; if there is not enough fat in the pan, 
add more ; unless well basted the fish will be dry. 

If the pan be first wel greased and then a sheet of greased brown paper put in, 
on which the fi h is laid, the fish will not stick to the pan, it can be more easily 
removed to the platter and the pan more readily cleaned. 

The best fish to bake are white fish, bass, pickerel, pike, red snapper, shad, etc., 
all having white fiesh. They should be basted often; a stuffing also serves to keep 
the fish moist as well as to season it. 

TO BOIL FISH 

Have the water just below the boiling point; if water is boiling the skin will cack. 
Select small firm fish, or a firm slice of a large one, clean thoroughly and wrap in a 
thin, coarse cloth, tying the ends. Small fish are usually boiled with heads left 
on, but the eyes removed. The average time required for boiling is 6 minutes 
per pound, unless the fish be very thick ; then it usually requires about 10 minutes 
per pound. If a regular fish kettle with drainer is not used, a plate may be placed 
in the pan and the fish laid upon it ; this will prevent the fish .sticking and will make 
it easier to remove same when cooked. A little salt in the water will add to the 
flavor and a tablespoon vinegar or lemon juice will keep the flesh white and firm. 

Fish should be boiled thoroughly until done; if not done they are very unwhole- 
some. 

The fish usually boiled are cod, haddock, halibut, salmon and fresh or salted 
mackerel. 

BOILED SALT MACKEREL 

Soak a salted mackerel all night. Scrape the skin off and put in skillet with fresh 
water enough to cover, boil 10 minutes. Place on platter and pour over it 3 round- 
ing tablespoons butter, which has been browned. Serve hot. Baked or boiled 
potatoes are very nice with this. 

HALIBUT AND TOMATO SAUCE 

Cook for 20 minutes 2 cups of tomatoes, 1 cup water, 1 sliced onion, 1 teaspoon 
salt, dash of pepper, 3 cloves and 1 tablespoon sugar; add to this 3 tablespoons 
butter and 3 tablespoons fiour moistened with a little water and stir until smooth, 
then cook all ten minutes and strain. 

Clean the fish, put in baking pan, pour around it half of the tomato sauce, bake 
35 minutes, basting often; remove to hot platter and pour around it the remaining 
sauce.

OYSTERS 



^2 



Of all the shell fish, oysters are probably the most popular; they are in season 
from September to May. In buying oysters, be sure to select those that are 
plump and free from green spots. Never let remain in a tin dish any length of 
time or in a warm place, as they spoil very quickly and become very poisonous. 

ESCALLOPED OYSTERS 

Mix I cup bread crumbs and 1 cup of cracker crumbs with | cup of melted butter; 
spread § of this over the bottom of a shallow baking dish, then put in 1 cup of 
oysters, well drained, and sprinkle with a little salt and pepper. Mix 4 table- 
spoons of the oyster liquid with 2 tablespoons of milk, cream or sherry wine and 
pour half of this over the layer of oysters; sprinkle another layer of crumbs, then 
another layer of oysters (1 cup), and the other half of the milk or wine and oyster 
liquor. Cover the top with remaining crumbs and bake 30 minutes in a hot oven. 
Never use more than two layers of oysters, as the middle layers are always un- 
derdone. 

FRIED OYSTERS 

Select large oysters, drain well, season with salt and pepper, roll in flour, then dip 
in beaten egg and roll in cracker or bread crumbs, fry in smoking hot lard until 
light brown, place on dish in layers and serve hot with slices of lemon. 

OYSTER LOAF 

Shoe off the top crust and scoop out the inside of a loaf of white bread, butter the 
inside of the shell thickly, pack with fried oysters, replace the top crust and bake 
15 minutes in a moderate oven.

Meat is the name applied to the flesh of all animals that are used for food. It 
is rarely eaten raw by civilized people. It is either roasted, stewed, fried or boiled. 
The chief object of cooking is the loosening of the tissues, which facilitates digestion 
by exposing them more fully to the action of the digestive juices. Another impor- 
tant object is to kill parasites, and thus render harmless organisms that might 
otherwise expose the eater to great risks. Minor, but by no means unimportant, 
objects are the coagulation of the albumen and blood so as to render the meat more 
acceptable to the sight, and the development and improvement of the natural 
flavor, which is often accomplished in part by the addition of condiments. In 
general, it is one of the most digestible of food materials. Recent experiments 
indicate that all kinds of meat are readily digested, less expensive cuts as well as 
the more costly. The higher priced cuts contain more of the so-called '"extractives," 
that is, flavors o the most pleasing quality, and it is these "extractives" which 
not only give the meat its agreeable flavor, but also actually stimulate the digestive 
processes. 

Meat is undeniably one of the more expensive items in the food bill of the ordinary 
family, and for this reason it is important that it be bought and used to the best 
pbssible advantage. 

It is also important to reduce waste by using as much as possible of the bone, 
fat and trimmings, not usually served with the meat itself. If nothing else can 
be done with them, the bones and trimmings can always be profitably used in the 
soup kettle and the fat can be kept for cooking, thus saving the more expensive 
butter and lard. The bits of meat not served with the main dish or remaining 
after the first serving can be seasoned and recooked in many palatable ways, or 
can be combined with vegetables, pie crust or other materials, and thus the meat 
flavor may be extended over a large number of inexpensive dishes. 

In fact, the number of tasty dishes which a good cook can make out of the 
cheaper cuts of meat or meat "left-over" is almost endless. Undoubtedly more 
time and skill are required in their preparation than in the simple cooking of the 
more expensive cuts, just as more time and skill are required for careful, intelligent 
marketing than for haphazard ordering. The real superiority of a good cook 
lies not so much in the preparation of expensive dishes or fancy dishes as in the 
attractive perparation of inexpensive dishes for every day and in the skillful com- 
bination of flavors. 

Some housekeepers seem to be prejudiced against economizing in such ways as 
those here suggested; but if the comfort of the family does not suffer and the meals

are kept as varied and appetizing as when they, cost more, little ground for this 
feeling should exist. It is surely not beneath the dignity of any family to avoid 
useless expenditure, no matter how generous the income. The intelligent house- 
keeper should take as much pride in setting a good table at a low price as the 
manufacturer does in lessening the expense and cost of the production of his factory.

GENERAL METHODS OF PREPARING MEATS FOR THE TABLE 

Paper should be removed from meat as soon as it comes from the market, for the 
reason that paper absorbs the juice and is apt to sour the meat. 

Meat may be washed and dried with a soft damp cloth, but it should never be 
allowed to remain in water, as the juices will draw out. 

The advantage of variety in the methods of preparing and serving are to be 
considered even more seriously in the cooking of the cheaper cuts of meats than 
in the cooking of the more expensive ones. An experienced teacher of cooking, a 
woman who has made very valuable contributions to the art of cooking, says that 
she tries "to reduce the cooking of meat to its lowest terms" and teaches three ways 
of cooking them. 

The first way is the application of intense heat to keep in the juices. This is 
suitable only for portions of clear meat where the fibers are tender. 

By the second method the meats are put in cold water and cooked in a low 
temperature; this is suitable for bone, gristle and the toughest portions of the meat, 
which for this purpose should be divided into small bits. 

The third way is a combination of the two methods for halfway cuts, namely, 
those that are neither tender nor very tough. 

The rnany varieties of meat dishes are usually only a matter of flavor and garnish- 
ment. In other words, of the three processes, the first is the short method — ^it 
aims to keep all the juices within the meat ; the second is a very long method for 
the purpose of getting all or most of the juices out; the third is a combination 
of the two, not so long as the second and yet requiring so much time that there 
is danger of the meat being rendered tasteless, unless certain precautions are 
taken, such as searing in hot fat or plunging into boiling water. 

Different kinds of cuts of meat vary considerably in price. Sometimes the 
cheaper cuts contain a larger proportion of refuse than the more expensive, and 
the actual cost" of the edible portion is greater than the apparent cost, Aside 
from this, the advantage of the more expensive cuts lies in tenderness and flavor 
rather than in nutritive value. Tenderness depends on the character of the muscle 
fiber and connective tissues of which the meat is composed. Flavor depends 
partly on the distribution of fat amongst the tissues, but mainly on nitrogenous 
bodies known as "extractives," which are usually more abundant and of more 
agreeable flavor in the more tender parts of the animal. All meat is made up of 
muscle fibers held together by connective tissues. When cooking, the heat dissolves 
the connective tissues and in a measure makes the meat more tender, but when

heated to or above boiling point, the intense heat, although it dissolves the connective 
tissues, nevertheless hardens the muscle libers; for this reason, tough meats should 
be cooked at a lower temperature than the boiling point, and for a long time, so that 
the tissue may be dissolved without hardening the muscle fibers. Cooking, especially 
in water, unless properly done, allows the escape into the water of the nutritious 
material of the meat. Where the liquid in which meat is cooked is to be used, as in 
soups and some stews, it is desirable to have the nutriment cooked out of the meat; 
but where the meat only is to be used it should be cooked so as to retain all the juices 
and extractives. Therefore, to retain all the extractives and juices, when not used 
s soup or stew meat, it is necessary to sear the exterior of the meat, either by 
lunging into boiling water or hot fat, or by direct application of heat as in roasting, 
, efore subjecting it to the long continuous cooking. 

Tough meat may be pounded or chopped to break the tissues to a certain extent 
and thus make it more tender. Besides using such methods to retain and develop 
the natural flavor of the meat, other flavors may be added to supplement them; 
these may be put into the meat before cooking or may be added in the form of 
relish or sauce. 

Vegetables of distinctive flavors, such as onions, carrots or celery; savory herbs 
such as parsley, sage, bayleaf or thyme; materials, such as vinegar, pickles or 
currant jelly; spices, such as pepper, cloves or curry mixtures, and sharp or highly 
seasoned meat sauces are all types of flavoring materials which are useful for such 
purposes, and which may be used in a great variety of ways.

GENERAL RULES FOR COOKING MEAT 

For boiling, plunge meat into boiling water and let it boil 8 or 10 minutes in order 
to quickly cook the outside, so that the juice inside will not escape; then set back 
on the stove, where there is sufficient heat to keep the water just below the boiling 
point and cook until meat is tender. Meat cooked in this way will be tender and 
juicy, whereas if rapidly boiled it will be tough, dry and flavorless. In boiling 
corned beef or any very salty meat, where it is necessary to draw out some of the 
salt, the meat should be put into cold, instead of boiling water, and should have 
the same long, slow cooking as fresh meat. 

For broths and beef tea, where the object is to draw out the juices, the meat 
should be cut in small pieces, put in cold water and cooked below the boiling point. 
For stews, the meat and bones should be cut small, covered with boiling water and 
cooked very slowly. For broiling, bright red coals are necessary to produce an 
intense hea^ to quickly cook the outside of the meat, thus preventing escape of 
juices. The broiler holding the meat should be frequently turned. A properly 
broiled' piece of meat is browned on the outside; the inside should be red and juicy. 
Pan' broiling is a good method for cooking ..steaks and .chops, when a bed of coals 
for broiling is not available. The frying pan in which the meat is to be broiled 
must be very hot when the meat is put in and the meat must be frequently turned ; 
the principle is the same as when using a broiler. , '■ T '*^ 

For roasting, great heat is needed at first to sear the outside of the meat, after 
which the heat may be reduced. It can be readily seen that the smaller the roast 
the greater the heat may be. If a very large roast is exposed to an intense heat, 
the outside will become burned before the heat can reach the inside. The time 
for cooking meats depends so much upon the size, thickness, amount of surface 
exposed and quality of meat, that it is impossible to give exact rules. The following 
table will, however, be a partial guide:

in 6 minutes, or the hand can be held inside from 12 to 15 seconds. For baking 
or roasting a small piece of meat, a quick oven is required and a shorter time; a 
quick oven will turn a piece of white writing paper dark brown in 4 minutes; the 
hand can be held inside from 8 to 10 seconds. 

PARTS OF ANIMALS USED FOR FOOD 

The following diagrams of a steer, calf, sheep and hog, show the positions of the 
different cuts of beef, veal, mutton and pork as they are sold in the markets and the 
tables show their various uses. A thorough knowledge of the subject can only be 
gained by frequnet visits to the market and a careful study of the cuts themselves. 
The butcher is usually willing to help his customers in such study.

BEEF 

Beef is the meat of the steer, ox or cow. It is the most nutritious and largely 
consumed of all meats. The quality of beef depends upon the age of the animal 
and the manner in which it was fed. Good beef should be firm, of fine grain, 
bright red in color and well streaked or corded with fat, which should be firm and 
of a light yellowish color.

VEAL 

Veal is the meat of young calf from 6 to 12 weeks old; from a very young animal 
it is unwholesome and hard to digest. Good veal is known by its pinkish colored 
flesh and white fat; when the flesh is colorless, the animal was too young to kill 
for food, or was not in proper condition. Veal is best during spring, but can be 
had all year. It' contains very little fat and always requires much butter or lard 
when being cooked to keep it from becoming dry and tasteless.

MUTTON 






n 



Mutton is the name given to the meat of the sheep. When the sheep is less than 
one year of age, the meat is usually called lamb. Spring lamb is from young sheep 
not more than 3 months of age and generally appears in market as early as January, 
but is scarce until March. Good mutton or lamb is fine grained and pink in color, 
the fat is white, hard and flaky. If the thin tissues or underskin comes off easily, 
the mutton is good. Lamb chops can be distinguished from mutton chops by the 
red color of the bone. Lamb should be cooked well done, while mutton is often 
cooked rare.

PORK 

Pork is the meat of pig or hog. It contains a larger percentage of fat than 
other meat, and when eaten fresh is the most difficult of digestion. It is in 
market all year, yet should be sparingly served, except during cold weather.

TRYING OUT FAT 

A double boiler is the best to use in trying out small portions of fat. There is no 
danger of burning the fat and the odor is much less noticeable than when it is 
heated in a dish set directly over the fire. 

CLARIFYING FAT 

To clarify fat, pour boiling water over it, boil thoroughly and then set it away to 
cool. The cold fat may be removed in a solid cake; any impurities will be found 
at the bottom of the cake and may be removed by scraping off. By repeating 
this process, 2 or 3 times, a clean, white cake of fat will be obtained. 

• A slightly burnt taste or any objectionable flavor can often be removed from 
fat by means of potatoes. After melting the fat, d op into it thick slices of raw 
potatoes, heat gradually ; when the fat ceases to bubble and the potatoes are brown, 
strain through a cloth placed in a strainer. 

Leaf lard is from the leaf shaped pieces of solid fat which lies inside the loin of 
the hog surrounding the kidneys. It is the best lard. 

SAVORY DRIPPINGS 

When rendering the drippings of fat meat, flavor with a small onion (do not cut it), 
a few leaves of savory and thyme, a teaspoon of salt and a little pepper. This 
is enough for 2 cups of fat. Strain the drippings, keep covered and in a cool place.

HOW TO COOK MEATS 

i 

I BROILED STEAK 

J^ Steak, whether sirloin, porterhouse or tenderloin, should be cut at least 1 inch ^^ 
^^ thick for broiling. ^^' 

Wipe meat with damp cloth, grease broiler with fat, place meat on it and turn 
every ten seconds for the first 2 minutes, then turn occasionally until browned. 
Steak 1 inch thick requires 5 to 7 minutes rare, 10 to 12 minutes medium and 15 
minutes well done. Place steak on platter, pour melted butter over it and season 
with salt and pepper. 



67 



^^l^^^ 



r^ Pan broiling is different than frying. For broiling only enough fat is used to keep ^ 
steak from sticking. ^ 

Wipe meat, remove fat, heat pan very hot and rub over with fat, put in the jjj 
steak, cook for 5 minutes, turning every 10 seconds at first, then let brown on 
each side. Season with salt and pepper and pour over it the browned drippings.

PAN BROILED STEAK 






FRIED STEAK OR CHOPS 

Steaks or chops of any kind when not cut thick, do not broil well, but should be 
fried. To fry them cut the c dges and place in skillet with plenty of hot butter 
and turn often. To prevent curling up, cut or nick the edges at intervals of about 
an inch. Experience will soon teach the length of time required to fry well, medium 
or rare. 



m 



BROILED RUMP ROAST 

Put a 4-pound piece of fat-covered rump in pan under gas broiler and turn until ai 

brown on all sides, then sprinkle with salt and add ^ sliced onion to the juice and (>? 

fat in pan, then put in upper oven with medium heat. One hour will cook the d| 

meat about medium. aj 

Then put 1 rounding tablespoon flour in pan (if there is too much fat, pour off a> 

part and use it for drippings) ; about | cup of fat in pan is enough ; let flour and ^ 

fat brown, then add J teaspoon salt and about 1 cup water and boil 1 or 2 minutes ; ^ 

serve roast and gravy hot. Roast prepared in this manner sliced cold and served aS 

with fried onions is very good. ^ 

ROUND STEAK WITH OYSTERS 

Dredge a round steak (cut ^ inch thick), with flour and a little salt. Then mix 
1 cup oysters with | cup of cracker crumbs, 1 rounding teaspoon butter, melted, 
1 teaspoon salt and 1 beaten egg. Spread this on round steak, roll and, tie or sew, 
place in pan, dot steak with butter and bacon or ham fat drippings, add | cup 
water and bake slowly for 2 hours, turning and basting occasionally. A filling 
made of sausage meat, mixed with J teaspoon salt and 1 beaten egg, may be sub- 
stituted for the oyster filling. 

STEW MEAT— Horseradish Gravy 

Boil 1 or 2 pounds of brisk or short ribs until tender. Blend 1 rounding tablespoon 
butter and 1 teaspoon flour in a pan, add J teaspoon of salt and 1 cup broth that 
meat was cooked in (balance of broth can be saved for soup stock), 2 tablespoons 
grated horseradish and 1 flat tablespoon sugar. Boil a few minutes and serve 
with meat. 

Meat from which soup has been made may be used as above.

GERMAN SOUR ROAST— Sauer Braten 

Interlard 3 pounds of shoulder or sirloin of beef with strips of ham or bacon fat. 
If one has no larding needle, use a very sharp and pointed little paring knife, cut 
down through the meat, enlarge the opening with the little finger and then slip 
in the strip of fat. Heat § cup of vinegar and J cup of water, pour over meat, 
having first rubbed the meat with salt, then add' 3 or 4 cloves, 5 teaspoon whole 
peppers, 4 allspice, 2 bay leaves and 1 onion cut in quarters. Let the meat stay 
in this pickle from 1 to 3 days. Heat 1 teaspoon butter and 1 tablespoon ham or 
bacon fat in a pot, take the meat out of the vinegar, dredge with fiour and place 
in the pot. When well browned, add half of the vinegar in which the meat was 
pickled, cover tightly and let it cook slowly 2 hours, gradually adding the rest of 
the vinegar as the other cooks away. A few carrots and a tomato added last, and 
then the whole strained and thickened with fiour moistened with water, make a 
delicious gravy. 



m 



POT ROAST 

Sprinkle with salt, 3-pound piece from rump, shoulder or bottom round of beef, 
dredge with flour, brown both sides in hot butter and bacon drippings in the pan 
and add 1 sliced onion. When brown, add 1 cup boiling water, cover closely

HUNGARIAN GOULASH 

Fry 2 ounces of pork until brown, cut 2 pounds top round of beef into 2-inch pieces, 
sprinkle with flour and cook together slowly for about 35 minutes in pot, stirring 
occasionally. Cover with water and let simmer about 2 hours, season with salt 
and pepper or paprika ; then have the following sauce ready and add to meat in pot ; 
let simmer together for 5 minutes before serving. 

Cook 2 cups of tomatoes, 1 stalk celery, 1 onion, 2 bay leaves, 6 whole cloves, 
6 black peppers and 1 blade mace for 20 minutes, run through sieve and add a 
little of the meat broth to it, also potatoes, carrots and green peppers cut in strips 
and cooked until tender. Thicken with 2 tablespoons flour moistened with water 
to each cup liquid and season \vith salt and paprika. Noodles or macaroni are 
served with this in place of potatoes. 

FILLET OF BEEF 

Procure a piece of fillet of beef weighing about 1 or 2 pounds, trim off part of the 
fat, so as to round the fillet, which cut into slices the thickness of your finger, 
beat them lightly with a pounder and cut at intervals the skin which covers 
the top of the fillet to prevent them curling up while broiling. Place them in a 
broiler over a sharp fire, turn three or four times, season with salt, pepper and 
melted butter. 

About 6 or 7 minutes will be sufficient to cook them. 

MINCED BEEF 

Boil a pound and a half of lean beef, then cut into small dice, which put upon the 
plate ; in a stew pan put 1 rounding teaspoon of finely chopped onions, with 1 round- 
ing tablespoon butter and stir over the fire until the onions become slightly browned, 
then stir in | tablespoon of flour, with which mix by degrees 1 cup of broth (or 
water) and 1 teaspoon of vinegar; let it boil 5 minutes, stirring it the whole time, 
then drop in the diced meat. Season rather highly with pepper and salt, and when 
hot pour it into a deep dish and serve with tippets of toasted bread or poached 
eggs on it. 

IRISH STEW 

Cut 2 pounds of short ribs into 3-inch lengths, put into enough boiling water to 
cover. Let simmer until tender, about 1| hours, then cut 3 medium sized pota oes 
into quarters, 1 onion and 2 tomatoes (or 2 tablespoons catsup), reason with 1 
teaspoon salt and J teaspoon pepper. Boil until all is tender, then thicken with 
flour moistened with water.

WHAT TO DO WITH MEAT SAVINGS 

If Porterhouse Steaks are too large, cut off the tougher part or small end and 
grind for hamburger or meat loaf, adding a little ground pork. a 

Fat May Be Trimmed from beef and rendered, also the fat drippings if too 

much to use for gravy must be poured off. Put all the beef fat in a small jar a 

and keep handy for use. It is better than butter in many cases and saves many ^ 

a pound of more expensive fat. ft 



Fat from Frying Bacon or fat pork should be saved in a small jar. 



If Ice is Kept or in winter when it is cold, one can buy a shoulder of veal for a 
small family, using the ends of shoulder for stew and the meaty part for roasting 
and slicing cold. 



Ham Ends may be bought reasonably; by carefully trimming rind and smoked 
part off and removing the string they can be used to boil with kraut, cabbage, 
greens and other vegetables. 



Bacon Rinds if carefully scrubbed and cleaned are good for seasoning and 
flavoring many vegetables; especially good to cook with navy beans, either for 
soup or baked beans. 



Trimmings of Fat and meat from pork are good to cook with cabbage, parsnips, 
butter beans, oyster plants, turnips, etc. 



Trimmings and Bones from lamb or mutton are good to cook with carrots or ^^ 
^ turnips. ^. 



Any pieces of meat too raw to be palatable may be put through the meat grinder 
^ and used for meat loaf or croquettes. 



Butt of Sirloin may be separated along sinews, the sinews trimmed off and 
f^ center piece of meat cut into steaks, using the outer portions for stew or hamburger.

Under the head of poultry, which is considered to be the best and most delicate of 
CC all articles of food provided for man's use, are included chickens, turkeys, geese, 
ducks, guinea fowls, etc. ^ 

Birds with light colored plumage pick easier and cleaner than dark ones. Capons ^g2 
are larger and much more tender than the ordinary chicken. j^'^^ 



A good fresh bird shows a well-rounded form, neat, compact legs, skin that is a 30 

clear yellow in color and free from blotches and pin feathers. The flesh should ^ 

be neither flabby nor soft and limber ; if the head is still attached to the body the ^ 

eyes should be bright and full. ^ 

The best way to test the age of a chicken is to press the end of the breast bone k| 

farthest from the head, between the thumb and finger; if it is a young fowl it will nn 

bend easily. The feet of young birds are soft and smooth. If the skin under the ^ 

wing of a dressed duck or goose breaks easily it is a good indication that same is 5J 

young. a) 



All poultry is better when killed the day before it is to be used; it should be 
thoroughly cleaned and kept in a cool place until time for cooking. 

When killing poultry either cut the throat or chop off the head and hold or 
hang with neck down until done struggling ; they bleed more freely. 

When done struggling and while still warm pick the feathers ; they can be picked 
dry or scalded and picked; be careful to draw all the pin feathers, then singe the 
bird by passing it through the blaze of a piece of lighted paper. 

After the bird has been thoroughly cleaned outside, make an incision at the 
rear of the end of the breast bone and remove the entrails ; be careful not to break 
the gall-sack, which is attached to the liver, as the least particle of gall will spoil 
the taste of the bird; then remove the craw, cutting the outside skin just below 
the neck. Cut the gizzard open and take out the inner skin, clean the heart and 
liver and put them all in cold water with a little salt. 






Cut out the oil bag on top near the point of the tail, then with a clean rag wash the 
bird in two or three waters until the water ceases to look bloody, using a little 
salt in the last water,, as it cleanes better. When thoroughly clean, tie string 
around neck, hang up and let drain out.

When filling poultry, fill the craw first and sew shut to keep the stuffing in. 
Always pack the stuffing, but never fill the bird completely full, as the stuffing 
will swell and become soggy. Take out all stitches before sending poultry to 
the table. 

OVEN TESTS 

For baking or roasting a large fowl a moderate oven is required and a longer 
time; a moderate oven will turn a piece of white writing paper dark brown in 6 
minutes or the hand can be held inside from 12 to 15 seconds. For small fowl a 
quick oven is required and a shorter time; a quick oven will turn a white piece of 
writing paper dark brown in 4 minutes ; the hand can be held inside from 8 to 10 
seconds. 









STUFFINGS 

PLAIN STUFFING 

Place 2 cups of stale gread or crumbs in a bowl, moisten with water enough to 
dampen well (but not enough to make the bread pasty) and cover to retain moisture. 
Fry a small chopped onion (do not brown) in 2 tablespoons of butter and bacon 
drippings, mix well with the damp bread crumbs and 1 beaten egg ; season with salt 
and pepper. 

This stuffing is excellent for all roast poultry, wild fowl, game or breast of veal. 



CELERY STUFFING 
Same as plain stuffing, adding 1 cup chopped celery. 

APPLE AND RAISIN STUFFING 

Place 1 cup stale bread in a bowl and dampen (do not get too wet), add 2 cups 
finely cut apples, 3 tablespoons sugar, 1 teaspoon salt and 1 cup washed raisins; 
mix thoroughly. 

This stuffing is preferred by some, especially for tame goose, duck and young 
pig, as the fruit neutralizes the excess animal fat.

HI. 






Buy your vegetables as fresh as possible; never accept any that are even slightly 
decayed. 

Vegetables if droopy, though not wilted, can be revived by putting in cold water 
for I hour, then in a wet cloth and on ice or in a cool place. 

Always wash thoroughly before preparing; after vegetables have been prepared 
for cooking they should be put in cold water. The water should usually be salted; 
boil vegetables until tender, though boiling too long makes com and asparagus 
tough. Old potatoes are improved by soaking in water. Lettuce can be cleaned 
a day ahead, if kept in tightly covered pan in ice box or cool place. Vegetables 
will keep nicely if wrapped in wet cloths and put near ice or in a very cool place; 
celery especially becomes crisp if cleaned and wrapped in wet cloths and put near ice. 

Parsley washed clean and put in glass jars tightly covered and placed in a cool 
place will keep fresh for a week. Vegetables such as parsnips, asparagus, oyster 
plant, turnips, etc., may be buried in dry sand or in a box of earth. 

Keep potatoes in a cool, dry place. 

Tomatoes can be peeled easily by first gently scraping all over with edge of a 
knife, then peeling comes off same as if dipped in boiling water. A sharp thin 
knife peels tomatoes best. Never scald tomatoes that are to be used for slicing; 
they lose their firmness. 

Strawberries put into screw-top jars, sealed air tight and kept in the ice box or a 
cool place will keep fresh from 3 to 4 days ; if left in the boxes they are apt to sour 
quickly. 

Rubbing potatoes with a thin coating of lard before baking will make the peeling, 
when done, as thin as that of boiled potatoes. 

Save all celery tops, dry and keep them in tightly covered jar, to be used for soup. 

HOW TO COOK VEGETABLES 

A knowledge of the composition of a vegetable furnishes the key to the manner 
in which it is to be treated, though protein, sugar, fat, mineral matter and water 
are all combined in it. In some vegetables the starch is found in the cellulose or 
woody tissue, but in whatever form it may occur, starch must be thoroughly cooked 
or it is unwholesome.

^^ 






Vegetables containing mostly protein and sugar with some starch, such as 
green peas and asparagus, require cooking on account of the starch, but to retain 
the sugar and other compounds the cooking should be done without violent boil- 
ing and with a small measure of water, since the water should form part of the 
finished dish. The same is true of spinach, mustard greens, etc. 






Vegetables with the starch in cellulose, such as parsnips, oyster plant, carrots 
and turnips, contain but little starch other than that found in their cellulose 
structure; this fiber, like animal fiber, is hardened by heat, and cooking should 

not be carried on at a temperature higher than the boiling point of water; this is \> 

accomplished by gentle boiling in an uncovered pot. The cooking should be (JK 

prolonged until the fiber is tender, but not longer. (^ 

— u 

Vegetables with much free starch, like potatoes, also breakfast cereals, rice, ^ 

macaroni, noodles* and other pastes used as vegetables, should be cooked at a ^ 

uniform temperature. To cook to perfection, keep the water just at the boiling ^ 

point and the pot uncovered until done. ^ 



When to Use a Large Quantity of Water 

Some varieties of onions strongly flavored and all members of the cabbage family 
require a large quantity of water when cooking ; it insures a more delicate flavor. 









When to Use Salt or Soda 

Hard water has a tendency to harden cellulose or woody fiber and thus keep sweet 
juices or other valuable compounds within the articles cooked; soft water acts in 
the opposite way. Salt added to water makes it hard, raises the boiling point 
and intensifies the color of green vegetables. Soda softens water and causes green 
vegetables to assume a faded look. As the appearance of food has much to do 
with our taste or distaste, certainly then, for aesthetic reasons, the use of salt in 
the cooking of green vegetables would be advisable; again, as green vegetables 
contain little woody tissue, but often sugar that we wish to retain, they should be 
cooked in salt water. Generally salt should be added to the water in which all 
vegetables, except those containing much cellulose, are to be cooked. Potatoes 
and onions never taste just right unless the water in which they have been cooked 
was salted. 

A teaspoon of salt to each quart of water will be found about right. 

Soft water if called for when the cellulose structure of dried peas, beans, etc., 
is to be made tender. If such water be not available, | teaspoon of bicarbonate 
of soda (baking soda) added to each quart of water in which the vegetables are 
to be cooked will soften the water.

BOILED POTATOES 

Peel potatoes very thin, removing eyes, etc., put into pot with enough water to 
cover, add 1 teaspoon salt to each quart of water and cook slowly from 25 to 40 
minutes until done. Stick with fork; if easily pierced, they are done. Pour the 
water off, sprinkle over about 1 level tablespoon of salt, place over low flame and 
shake four or five times or until potatoes look mealy. Cover partly with a lid; 
or, better still, a cloth, and remove to back of stove, if it is not convenient to serve 
at once. 

Potatoes are best served immediately after being cooked; standing any length 
of time spoils them. 

Unless potatoes are very young, pare and lay in cold water an hour or more 
before using to make them crisp. New potatoes should be scrubbed or scraped 
instead of peeled. 

Good potatoes, properly cooked, are mealy, no matter how good they may be, 
if cooked in simmering water they will become water-soaked and soggy. If potatoes 
are cooked in furiously boiling water the outside becomes soft and washes away, 
while there is a "bone" in the center. 



BAKED POTATOES 

Wash carefully, cut a small slice from each end, rub the potato with thin coating 
of fat, lay in the oven, turning them once during baking. Small potatoes bake 
in 30 to 35 minutes ; large potatoes take from 45 minutes to an hour. 



POTATOES ON HALF SHELL 

Bake large potatoes until they are soft, then cut in half lengthwise, scoop out the 
center into a bowl, mash and season with salt, pepper, butter and cream; beat 
very hard until light. Put mixture back into shells and brown in a very hot oven 
or under gas. 

STUFFED BAKED POTATOES 

Wash potatoes, but do not cut the ends off before putting into oven. Bake 3 
large potatoes until soft, then cut a slice off the top, scoop out the potatoes, mash 
and add | cup of milk and a goodly portion of minced, boiled or fried ham or bacon 
and a beaten egg. Mix well, place mixture in potato, brush with egg and bake 10 
to 15 minutes longer. 

MASHED POTATOES 

Peel and boil potatoes until done. Drain and steam for a minute after adding 
salt, then mash with potato masher. When free from lumps, add a generous 
lump of butter and milk enough to moisten. Beat vigorously for 5 minutes to make 
them white and creamy. A pinch of soda will make them very creamy, but if 
soda is used they must be served at once.

POTATOES WITH JACKETS ON 

Wash potatoes carefully and boil until done in salted water, then drain and steam ^ 
dry. 

Left-over boiled potatoes with jackets can be used for frying or potato salad, 
^ as this is the proper way to prepare them for those dishes. 



GERMAN FRIED POTATOES 

Remove skins from potatoes cooked in jackets and slice in round pieces. For 2 
cups of potatoes use 1 rounding tablespoon of lard and 1 tablespoon ham or bacon 
drippings. Have fat very hot in a skillet, put potatoes in it and remove to cooler 
part of stove or smaller flame, sprinkle 1 teaspoon of salt and J teaspoon pepper 
over them, and when nearly done, add | onion cut fine. Constantly toss with an 
egg turner while frying until slightly browned. 



FRENCH FRIED POTATOES ^ 

Peel potatoes, cut into strips and lay in cold water an hour or more before using. P) 
When ready to use, dry them and drop into deep sizzling fat. The fat should 
be hot enough to brown them quickly, when they will rise to the surface, as they 
will not rise until done. Remove with a skimmer when they rise. 






SARATOGA CHIPS « 

& 

Peel potatoes and cut in thin slices; throw into ice water for 20 minutes, dry with ^ 

clean napkin and drop into boiling lard ; when light brown take out with a skimmer, d|

POTATOES AU GRATIN ^ 

Dice or slice 2 cups of cooked potatoes and place in a buttered baking dish; pour 
over them a thin sauce made of 2 rounding tablespoons butter, 1 tablespoon flour, 
1 teaspoon salt, | teaspoon pepper, J teaspoon celery salt, IJ cups of hot milk, 
1 tablespoon chopped or grated cheese. 

Cover the top with bread crumbs moistened with melted butter. 

Bake in a moderately hot oven until well browned. If raw potatoes are used 
they will require longer baking than when cooked potatoes are used. 

LYONNAISE POTATOES 

Put 1 rounding tablespoon butter or drippings into frying pan; when melted, add 
small finely chopped onion, cook -2 or 3 minutes, then add 3 cups sliced cold boiled 
potatoes, season well with pepper and salt; fry a nice brown. ^g

For 2 cups of potatoes use 1 rounding tablespoon butter, 1 teaspoon salt, dust 
with cayenne pepper, toss the potatoes in this over a hot flame until the butter 
has been absorbed and the potatoes look brown. 
This is good to serve with fish or cold meats. 

O'REILLY POTATOES 

Have ready 2 cups of cold cooked potatoes chopped to the size of small beans, 
1 cup of canned tomatoes boiled to a thick pulp, 1 green pepper free from seeds 
and minced fine, 5 small onion minced, 2 tablespoons drippings or butter. Heat 
the fat in a skillet and cook the onion and pepper until soft, then add the potatoes

1 tablespoon sugar; heat until it bubbles (but do not let it brown), then add ^ 
cup vinegar and | cup of water. Let this come to a boil and pour while hot over 
the potatoes. More vinegar can be added if salad is not sour enough. Let the 
potatoes stand in this dressing at least an hour. Do not put in ice box ; it is better 
served a little warm. 

MAYONNAISE POTATO SALAD 

Peel cooked potatoes and slice or dice them. To each quart of potatoes while 
still warm, add 1 teaspoon onion juice, 1 tablespoon bacon drippings, 2 hard boiled 
eggs and 1 cup celery cut fine and pour over the following mustard mayonnaise 
dressing: Beat 2 eggs until foamy, add 1 tablespoon flour, 1 teaspoon of prepared 
mustard, | teaspoon of salt, 1 tablespoon sugar and a pinch of red pepper, beat

BAKED BEANS 

Soak 1 cup dry navy beans over night in plenty water; boil with piece of ham fat 
(or bacon rind thoroughly cleaned) and j onion until beans are tender and nearly 

dry. Remove ham fat or bacon rind and pour beans into a baking dish. Add ^ 

4 cup molasses, 1 teaspoon table sauce, 4 tablespoons catsup (or 1 cup of tomatoes) ^ 

and place a small piece of salt pork or a sausage among beans and bake 3 or 4 hours ^ 

or longer. ^ 

These can be baked on baking day or when oven is used for a long time ; other- ^ 
wise too much fire 's needed just for the beans alone. ^ 

Put a lid over the beans while baking until nearly done, then remove the lid ^ 
and brown. 



KIDNEY BEANS 

Soak 1 cup of kidney beans in plenty of water over night and boil with a pinch of 
soda for 5 minutes, then pour off water and put on to boil in fresh water. Cook 
with them a piece of fat brisket for about 1| hours, then add | can tomatoes or 3 
_jS tablespoons catsup, a dash of red pepper, 1 teaspoon celery salt, J onion and 1 
^i^ teaspoon of tablesauce. Boil | hour longer. 

DRY BUTTERBEANS 

Soak 1 cup butterbeans over night in plenty of water. In the morning put them on 
to cook with small piece of pork or ham in water enough to cover well and boil 
for 1 hour, very slowly. Cut 1 large potato (peeled) into dice, boil with beans 
until potatoes are soft, add 1 peeled apple cut into very thin slices; let this boil 
until done, then add 1 tablespoon vinegar and 2 tablespoons sugar. Do not add 
vinegar if apple is very sour. Add salt, if cooked with fresh pork, but not if cooked 
with ham, as that is usually salty enough. 

FRESH BEANS— Green or Wax 

String the beans and break or cut into small pieces. Boil a piece of bacon or ham 
for I hour, then add the beans and cook for half an hour longer or tintil beans are 
tender. Potatoes cut into quarters can aho be added. When done, sprinkle 
f^ with pepper and thicken with flour. 

SOUR BEANS 

Left-over beans (prepared as in foregoing recipe) make a palatable cold dish when 
mixed with a little bacon drippings, a raw sliced onion and enough vinegar to 
suit taste. 

COLD BEAN SALAD 






Stirring the beans, cook until tender, drain and let cool, 
add to beans and pour over German salad dressing. 
Left-over green or wax beans can be used. 



Cut J onion very fine.

HOT BEAN SALAD 

String beans, cook until tender and drain. Fry out enough bacon or ham fat to 
make J cup fat, leave the cracklings, add 1 rounding tablespoon flour, | small 
onion cut fine, cook until it bubbles, but do not brown, add 3 tablespoons vinegar, 
I cup water, 3 tablespoons sugar and 1 teaspoon salt. Boil for 15 minutes in ^ 
this mixture; serve as salad or hot vegetable. 

CANNED STRING OR WAX BEANS 

String 1 can beans, put in pot with enough water to cover, season with pepper 
and salt, add 1 teaspoon butter or drippings and boil about 10 minutes. 

DRIED GREEN PEAS 

Soak 1 cup peas over night in plenty water. In the morning put them on to cook 
in fresh water and boil very slowly for 1| hours, with a piece of ham or bacon; 
season with pepper and salt. 

YELLOW SPLIT PEAS 

Soak 1 cup split peas over night in plenty water, put on with salted water and 
cook until very soft. Put through a colander and add | cup of water that the peas 
were cooked in and | cup hot milk. 

Fry out ^ cup ham or bacon fat with J onion; leave cracklings in; add 1 tea- 
spoon butter and a dash of red pepper. Pour this over the strained peas, mix all 
well and serve. 

Sauer kraut and peas as above are especially good served with boiled or roasted 
beef. 

FRESH PEAS 

Shell peas, cover with cold water and skin. Cook until soft, then add salt, pepper 
and butter. If liked can be thickened with flour moistened with water. A few 
carrots cut fine and cooked with peas will improve the flavor. When peas are 
done they may be drained and milk or broth added, seasoned with salt, pepper and 
butter. If the pods are boiled first and this liquor, strained off and cooled, is used 
instead of water to boil the peas in, it will add to the flavor of the peas. 



Same as above but boiled with milk instead of water, and thickened with flour 
moistened with water.

FRESH OR CANNED PEAS AND DUMPLINGS 

Cook the peas unti' done, then season with salt, pepper and butter; add the dump- 
I'ngs by spoonsful and cook slowly for 15 minutes longer in covered pot. 

Dumplings: Boil 1 cup milk, 1 tablespoon butter, 1 teaspoon salt, 1 tablespoon 
sugar, I teaspoon nutmeg; when boiling sift in | cup flour, work the flour into 
the milk (over a low flame) until it becomes very thick and smooth ; steam a few 
minutes longer, then add the beaten yolk of 1 egg and work that into the mixture 
until smooth. Remove from fire and add the stiffly beaten white of the egg and 
work again till smooth. 

CANNED CORN 

To 1 can com add I cup milk, 1 teaspoon butter, season with salt and pepper, 
boil slowly for 10 minutes, thicken with | teaspoon corn starch dissolved in table- 
spoon water. 

BAKED CORN

beat well and season to taste with salt and pepper, thicken to heavy batter with 
flour moistened with water. Drop with tablespoon and fry with plenty butter 
in a hot skillet, turning when browned. If the skillet is heated just right the 
"oysters" will be light. It should not be too hot or the com will not cook, nor too 
cool or the fat will be absorbed and the com become heavy and soggy. 

Young housekeepers anxious to make good cooks of themselves should master 
this matter of heating any fat for frying, exactly right; much depends upon it. 

SUCCOTASH 

Boil 2 cups of tomatoes with 1 cup of fresh com until tender, add 1 tablespoon of 
butter, 2 tablespoons sugar, | teaspoon salt and j teaspoon pepper, thicken with 
^'i 1 teaspoon flour moistened with water.

crumbs, add 1 rounding tablespoon butter, | finely chopped onion, season well 
with salt and pepper, put in dish and bake | hour. 

WHOLE BAKED TOMATOES 

Take smooth round tomatoes, slice off the top and take out all the inside with a 
spoon. Put the juice and pulp in a bowl, mix with bread crumbs, finely chopped 
parsley, minced ham and butter, season with salt and pepper, make into a stuffing 
with which fill each tomato. Put a little piece of butter and 1 teaspoon bread 
crumbs on each one, cover with the sliced off top, put in a pan and bake 1 hour. 
If they still seem watery bake a little longer.

FRUIT SALAD MAYONNAISE 

Beat 3 eggs until foamy, then add | cup of sugar and beat 5 minutes, add | cup 
of vinegar and beat 5 minutes more, then put in a double boiler, add 1 rounding 
teaspoon of butter and beat constantly with egg beater until mixture thickens. 
It ought to be creamy when done. When cold and ready to serve add 1 cup or 
more whipped cream, to which may be added 1 teaspoon whiskey; it gives the 
dressing a better flavor. Vigorous and constant beating while mixing and boiling 
is the secret of this delicious dressing. 

MAYONNAISE DRESSING WITH OIL 

Put the yolks of 2 eggs in very cold plate or bowl, beat until light, add | teaspoon 
salt, I teaspoon dry ground mustard, a dash of cayenne pepper, 1 teaspoon powdered 
sugar and 1 teaspoon of the white of egg (to prevent curdling), then beat again 
until light. Now add drop by drop to egg mixture, j cup olive oil (or use 2 round- 
ing tablespoons butter, melted), stirring vigorously all the while. When the 
mixture gets too stiff to stir, add a few drops of lemon juice or vinegar, then the 
butter or oil again, drop by drop, until you have used 2 tablespoons vinegar or 
lemon juice and all the butter or oil. If too thick when ready to use, a few drops 
of vinegar may be used to thin it. 



Never put mayonnaise on a salad until the last moment before serving, 
there is a tendency to curdle, put on ice for a few minutes and then stir hard. 



If 



The secret of success in making this dressing is vigorous beating and a good 
quality of vinegar. 

MUSTARD MAYONNAISE DRESSING 



PJ- 



Beat 2 eggs until foamy, add 1 tablespoon flour, 1 teaspoon of prepared mustard- 

1 tespoon of salt,l tablespoon sugar and a pinch of red pepper, beat until well mixed- 
Boil 1 cup milk, then add milk very slowly to eggs, etc. , beating all the time. Return 
all to fire in pot milk was boiled in. Heat | cup of vinegar, ^ cup of water and 1 
teaspoon butter and add to other mixture. Beat constantly with egg beater until 
it comes to a boil, then cool. If it is not sour enough, add a few drops of lemon 
juice and beat. This also helps make it smooth if it looks a little curdled. Always 
use only the freshest of milk.

Home-made bread, owing to the cheapness and plentifulness of baker's bread 
has become a luxury or is altogether missing in many homes. 

This should not be the case, as good home-made bread is more nutritious, whole- 
some and digestible than most bread bought at the shops, besides it costs less than 
baker's bread. With care and perseverance any one can become a good bread 
baker. 

GENERAL RULES FOR BREAD MAKING. 

For white bread, use the best new process flour. Good flour in never dead white 
in color, but has a yellowish or creamy tint. If milk is used for mixing it should 
first be scalded and cooled, as that renders the dough less liable to sour. Be sure 
that the yeast is fresh. 



A yeast cake is fresh when it has an even yellow color throughout ; dark streaks 
indicate mold. Yeast must never be put in hot water, or hot milk, or be allowed 
to freeze, as freezing or subjecting it to great heat kills the little yeast plants of 
which it is composed. Keep yeast wrapped in the tinfoil in a cold place until 
ready to use. 



One cake of dry yeast is equivalent to ^ cake compressed yeast. 



Always put dry ingredients in bowl first and then add the liquid gradually; 
they will mix much smoother. 



Yeast is a plant and needs air to make a good growth, as well as water and an Pf 
even temperature. r| 

Dry yeast may be used in place of compressed and should be dissolved in the ^ 
same quantity of water as specified in recipes. r| 

'^ 



For bread the exact quantity of liquid cannot be given, this depending on the ^ 

kind of flour used. Bread dough should be kneaded steadily and quickly for ^ 

20 minutes, working in all the dry flour and adding a little more if the dough sticks ^ 
to the bowl or the hands. 



The proper way to knead is by pushing the dough with the palm of the hand, 
curving the fingers to keep the ball of dough from fiattening too much ; with every nS 
push turn the dough one quarter round and half fold it over.

k.5^fl»?&:flCi^i-^s 



Do not make the dough too stiff by adding too much flour or kneading too long. 
A soft dough makes the bread tender and it will keep better than if made with 
stiff dough. Knead until the dough has a silky smoothness, is full of bubbles and 
does not stick to the hands or board. 



Cover the sponge with a cloth, stand in a moderately warm place free from 
draughts and let it rise until it has doubled in bulk. In the daytime, in a warm 
kitchen, this will probably be about 4 hours ; at night, when the temperature is 
lower, the bread will be ready to mold into loaves early in the morning. Should it 
have risen fully before the cook is ready to attend to it, the dough may be "cut 
down" from the sides of the bowl and allowed to come up again. This will prevent 
over-raising and consequent souring. 



In forming into loaves, turn the dough on to a lightly floured board, divide 
into portions, knead lightly and put into greased pans; cover with a cloth and 
allow the dough to double its bulk. After being shaped into loaves the bread 
should be allowed to rise to double its bulk and then be baked. 



In baking bread have the oven only moderately hot when the bread first goes 
in, so as to allow it to rise to its fullest extent; then increase the heat to form a 
good crust, and finally, reduce it again to let the center of the loaf bake thoroughly. 
Two-pound loaves (before baked) require about three-quarters of an hour to bake 
and when done must be removed at once from the pans and put where the air will 
circulate freely around them until cold. 



A new baking pan should always be baked blue in the oven before it is used. 
When bread is baked remove from pan and place upside down to cool. If a crisp 
crust is desired allow bread to cool without covering; if soft crust, cover with a 
towel during cooling. When cool, place in a closely covered box. 



Bread is brushed with milk to make a darker crust ; if tops of loaves are brushed 
with butter before putting in the oven, the crust will be moist. When shortened 
with butter, bread has a good flavor, but is not as white as when lard is used. 



Good bread is light though fine grained throughout, it is not sticky and has no 
yeasty or sour smell; when pressed between the thumb and fingers the crumbs 
do not stick together, the crust is thin, crisp and brown. 



Never keep bread wrapped in cloth, as the cloth will absorb moisture and cause 
an unpleasant taste. 



y. Test oven by sprinkling a little flour on sheet of paper; if flour browns in 5 C^ 

^ minutes the oven is right for bread, if it browns in 3 minutes the oven is right for j,^ 

f^ biscuits. 

^ — 

y^ In ordinary small ranges, loaves need frequent turning to insure an even baking. 




145 



A bread box should be washed, scalded and aired frequently to keep bread 
from molding. jj\ 

51 

J^K Do not waste any dry, stale or broken bread; roll into crumbs, put in an air- ^ 
tight jar and crumbs will keep a long while. ?R 

Use stale bread for puddings and stviffings; it makes a lighter stuffing than 
fresh bread. Good for toast or milk toast.

Bread made occasionally of entire wheat or graham flour afEords a pleasant 
change and agrees with some people better than white bread. The dough for 
such should not be made stiff enough t& knead, because when kneaded such bread 
is apt to be hard and dry. The mixture should be of the consistency of a very 
thick batter and should be well stirred, beaten and raised. Loaves shotdd be put 
in the oven to bake before they have quite doubled in size. 

WHITE BREAD 
In the evening sift together 2 cups flour and | teaspoon sugar; stir into this 1 
cup lukewarm water, then add § cake compressed yeast dissolved in J cup luke- 
warm water; mix thoroughly and set to raise. 

Next morning thin the yeast mixture with 1 cup lukewarm water and stir in 
I rounding tablespoon lard. Sift intp a bowl 4 cups flour and | tablespoon salt, 
make a hole in the middle of the heap, pour in the yeast mixture and work the 
flour down into it with the hands. If too soft, add more flour; if stiff, rinse the 
bowl in which the yeast was set with a little lukewarm water and work this into 
the dough. 

Knead the dough well and set to raise until it doubles its btdk; when raised, 
cut down, handling lightly, mold into loaves and put in baking pan, let rise until 
nearly double in size, then put into moderate oven and bake with steady heat. 

MILK BREAD 
Same recipe as foregoing, using milk instead of water and omitting the lard, as 
the milk takes the place of shortening. 

RAISIN BREAD 
In the evening sift together 2 cups flour and ^ teaspoon sugar; stir into this 1 cup 
lukewarm water, then add ^ cake compressed yeast dissolved in | cup Itikewarm 
water-; mix thoroughly and set to raise. 

Next morning thin the yeast mixture with 1 cup Ivikewarm water and stir in 
I rounding tablespoon lard, 1 teaspoon sugar and 1 cup raisins. Sift into a bowl 
4 cups flour and | tablespoon salt, make a hole in the middle of the heap, pour 
in the yeast mixture and work the flour down into it with the hands. If too soft, 
add more flour; if stiff, rinse the bowl in which the yeast was set with a little luke- 
warm water and work this into the dough. Knead the dough well and set to raise 
until it doubles its bulk; when raised, cut down, handling lightly, mold into loaves 
and put in baking pans, let rise until nearly double in size, then put into moderate 
oven and bake with steady heat.

Next morning thin the yeast mixture with 1 cup scalded milk, which has been 
cooled until lukewarm and add | rounding tablespoon lard. Place in mixing bowl 
the 4 cups sifted flour (left from the night before), add | tablespoon salt, make a 
hole in the middle of the heap, pour in the yeast mixture and work the flour down 
into it with the hands. If too soft, add more flour; if stiff, rinse the bowl in which 
the yeast was set, with a little lukewarm water and work this into the dough. 

Knead the dough well and set to raise until it doubles its bulk; when raised 
cut down, handling lightly, mold into loaves and put in baking pans, let rise until 
nearly double in size, then put into moderate oven and bake with steady heat. 

BOSTON BROWN BREAD 

Sift and mix together 1 cup rye flour, 1 cup graham flour, 1 cup. commeal, 1 teaspoon 
baking soda and 1 teaspoon salt, then add 1 cup sour milk, 2 cups sweet milk 
and 1 cup molasses; mix all thoroughly. Pour the mixture into a welF buttered 
mold (have top, bottom and sides buttered), tie mold shut, place in double boiler 
or kettle of cold water and boil 4 hours. 

See that water does not boil to top of mold, also take care that it does not stop 
boiling. Do not flll mold more than f full ; the mixture must have room to swell. 
A 2j-pound baking powder can or 5-pound lard can are good substitutes for a 
regular mold.

GENERAL DIRECTIONS FOR MAKING CAKE 

Use none but the best materials for making cake. Rub the butter to a cream 
Some prefer to wash it in warm water to take out the salt. Cream the butter 
and sugar together, beat the whites and yolks of the eggs separately. The baking 
powder should be thoroughly mixed and sifted with the flour several times ; baking 
soda should be dissolved in sour milk or a little warm water. 



The success of your cake depends much on having the other ingredients thor- 
oughly beaten together before the flour and baking powder are added, after which 
stir as little as possible. 



Currants should be carefully picked over and washed in a colander until clean, 
then spread on tins before the fire, when dry; put away for use. Raisins should 
be seeded and cut or chopped, as preferred. 



To blanch almonds, pour boiling water over them, then drop into cold water 
and rub ofE the skins. 



Fruit should be dredged with flour before putting it into the cake, to prevent 
it sinking or settling to the bottom of the dough. 



Before making cake, have the fire right so coal will not have to be added while 
the cake is baking. Grease and flour the pans or line with greased paper. Measure 
all the ingerdients carefully. Cream butter until soft ; that is, rub it lightly against 
side of dish with back of spoon and work until creamy. Add the beaten egg 
yolks first, then the milk and flour, alternately, stir and mix all well together. 
The beaten whites of the eggs and flavorings should always be added last. 

Turn into pans and bake until mixture leaves the sides of the pan and is firm 
in the middle. Too great care cannot be taken with the baking ; half of the success 
of the cake depends upon the oven. Too hot an oven causes a crust to form and 
prevents the batter from rising easily and baking in the center. 



m 



Cake should rise to its full height before it begins to brown. If it bakes too 
strong underneath, place on a higher shelf or put asbestos mat under pan; if it 
bakes too stuong on top, cover with paper; do not handle or disturb just after 
putting in oven.

If cake calls for white of eggs only, use the yolks for fillings, puddings, sauces 
or mayonnaise dressing or a sunshine cake or some other cake calling for the yolks 
only. If a recipe calls for egg yolks only, save the whites and use for icing or use 
in some recipe calling for whites only, such as puddings, meringues, etc. 

When cake tin is lined with paper and the paper sticks to the cake when baked, 
it can be removed by turning the cake bottom upwards when partly cooled and 
brushing the paper with cold water until it is thoroughly damp. If not convenient 
to dampen the paper, it can be removed by tearing off in half -inch strips, commenc- 
ing by tearing the first strip off through the middle. If after a cake is baked it 
sticks to the bottom of the pan, merely turn the pan upside down and press a cold 
wet cloth to the bottom; this will bring the cake out quickly. 



OVEN TESTS 

For baking large cakes, loaf cake, etc., a moderate oven is required. A moderate 
oven will turn a piece of white writing paper dark brown in 6 minutes, or the hand 
can be held inside from 12 to 15 seconds. For small cakes, layer cakes, biscuits, 
etc., a quick oven is required; a quick or hot oven will turn a piece of white writing 
paper dark brown in 4 minutes; the hand can be held inside from 8 to 10 seconds.

Always put dry ingredients in bowl first and then add the liquid gradually; they ^j- 
will mix smoother. >1?

ICINGS 

PLAIN ICING 

Put 2 tablespoons of boiling water in a bowl and gradually stir in enough 
fectioner's sugar (about 1 cup) to make a mixture stiff enough to spread, 
add vanilla, lemon, orange or any flavoring extract to taste. It is usually 
to flavor icing same as the filling and cake itself. 

Using 2 tablespoons cream or milk, instead of water, improves the icing.

CHOCOLATE ICING 

Mix 2 or 3 tablespoons grated chocolate or cocoa with sugar, mix as in plain icing, 
add 5 teaspoon of melted butter and beat well. 

BOILED ICING 

Boil 1 cup sugar in ^ cup water until it threads from spoon. Beat egg white very 
stiff, pour syrup slowly on this, beating all the while. Continue beating irntil 
thick enough, then spread on cake. If beaten 'too long it will be lumpy; then add 
a few drops of lemon juice ; if not beaten long enough it will nm. It has a glossy 
surface and is soft underneath when done.

Pastry used for pies can be made very rich and expensive, although for general S'. 
use a plainer crust is as good and just as wholesome. Care should always be taken ^f 
to have all ingredients very cold and handle as little as possible. ^^ 

PLAIN CRUST 

For general use : Sift 3 cups pastry flour with 1 teaspoon salt several times ; then 
w th hands rub to crumbs with 1 cup lard, add j cup of ice water, beat vigorously 
1 minute and crust is ready. 

Roll thin and do not use too much flour to roll it in, as that toughens the crust. 
This quantity is enough for several pies. For 1 pie use 1 tablespoon lard to 3 
tablespoons flour, | teaspoon salt, and 2 tablespoons ice water. Rub the pie plate 
with lard, dust with flour, then line the plate with crust. Brush the crust (if 
wished richer) with melted butter, dust with flour and fill with pie material. When 
baking pies even if crust is not brushed with butter, be sure to dust with flour 
and always put in the oven for 2 or 3 minutes before filling; it prevents juices 
soaking into the crust. If water is added to fruit in pie do not add until pie has 
baked 10 minutes, then pour through a slit in upper crust, using a small funnel. 
Always moisten the edge of the lower crust with water before placing the top crust 
on it, press edges together with fingers or a fork so that the juices will not run out 
easily. 

RICHER PASTRY OR PIE CRUST 



Mix together | cup lard, 3 cups flour, 1 teaspoon salt, 1 teaspoon sugar and 1 cup 
of ice water. Sift flour, salt and sugar together, rub in lard with hands until 
crumby, add ice water slowly, handling lightly. Put the dough on board, roll 
out, spread with | cup butter, fold three times and roll up together; cut the pastry 
.across and roll out pieces to fit pie plate. 

COUNTRY APPLE PIE 

Peel 3 large apples and slice thin' 



Line a pie plate with crust and dust with flour, 
filling the pie almost to the top. 

Sprinkle with J cup of sugar (more if apples are very tart), dot with butter, 
sprinkle with a little cinnamon and pour over it one egg well beaten with | cup of 
milk. Cover with a top crust in which small slits have been cut, brush the crust 
with melted butter or lard and sprinkle with flour. Bake until brown and apples 
are tender, about | hour.

FRUIT PIES 

Line a pie plate with crust, dust with flour. Fill with any fruit desired, sprinkle 
with from | to 1 cup sugar, according to the tartness of the fruit, 1 rounding table- 
spoon butter and cinnamon if liked. Cover the top or not, as liked. If not covered, 
use milk or custard of 1 egg beaten with J cup of sugar, pinch of salt, and J cup 
milk to moisten fruit. Do not sprinkle with sugar, if custard is used. When pie 
is covered, brush the top crust with melted butter or lard, dust with flour, and after 
baking 5 or 10 minutes, add \ cup of water through slits in the top with small 
funnel. 

CHEESE PIE 

Line pie pan with rich crust about \ inch thick, dust with flour. Put through a 
seive 1 cup cottage cheese and beat until light with 2 egg yolks, | cup of sugar, ^ 
cup of milk and 1 teaspoon vanilla extract, then stir in tjae stiflly beaten whites of 
the 2 eggs. Pour into crust, sprinkle with cinnamon and bake about 20 minutes 
or till cheese is firm. 

MINCE PIE 

Mince pie is baked with 2 crusts ; use plenty of mince-meat for filling. Some dust 
the pie with powdered sugar before serving. Most people prefer mince pie served 
hot. 

MINCE-MEAT 

Plunge 3 or 4 pounds of beef, cut from neck or shoulder, into boiling water and boil 
until tender, then chop or grind fine, add 1| pounds raisins washed and cleaned. 
If pounds currants, the chopped rind of 2 lemons, 'juice of 1 lemon and 2 
oranges, 2 pounds sugar, \ pound of citron cut fine, 1 tablespoon salt, 1 grated 
nutmeg, 1 teaspoon ground ginger, 1 tablespoon ground mace, 1 teaspoon ground 
allspice, 1 teaspoon ground cloves, 2 tablespoons ground cinnamon and J gallon 
good cider. Let this all come to a boil, then remove from fire and when cool add 
2 pounds clean, sweet kidney suet ground fine, place in earthen jar, pour | cup of 
good whiskey over it and cover. A^en ready to bake pie, add 1 cup chopped 
apples and 2 tablespoons whiskey to 1 cup mince-meat for each pie. If put in the 
mince-meat when made, the apples become soft and do not taste so good as when 
put in fresh each time. The whiskey also loses much of its strength if put in too 
long ahead. A little whiskey should be poured over when made, it helps keep 
mince-meat from moulding. This makes quite a quantity ; it can be kept several 
weeks in winter by keeping in a cool place in tightly closed jars.

2 cups hot water, boil for 10 minutes, then add the juice of 2 lemons. Peel 3 oranges, 
cut them in slices and lay in a deep dish, pour the hot sauce over, then cover with 
whites of 3 eggs, beaten stiff with 3 tablespoons powdered sugar. Set in hot oven 
and brown top slightly. Serve very cold. 









SAUCES FOR DESSERTS AND PUDDINGS 

Boiling too rapidly ruins the fiavor of any sauce; it must boil once, but should 
never do more than simmer afterwards. 

PLAIN SAUCE 

Rub i cup butter and 1| cups sugar to a cream, to which add 2 well beaten eggs 
and just before serving add enough boiling water to make a thick cream, mix well, 
flavoring to suit. 

BRANDY SAUCE 

Cream 1 cup butter with 2 cups pulverized sugar, add 4 tablespoons brandy, 
i teaspoon each ground cinnamon and mace. Beat hard and set in a cold place 
until wanted. 

CLEAR SAUCE 

Boil 2 cups of water and 1 cup of sugar until clear and a little thick; flavor with 
wine, lemon juice or fruit juice.

To freeze ice cream perfectly, turn slowly at first, then faster and very quickly 
at the last. 

The finer the ice is chopped the more extensive will be its contact with can, hence 
the cream will freeze quicker and better. For rapid freezing, sprinkle the ice with 
plenty of salt when packing around can; the more freely salt is used the more 
rapid will be the freezing process. 

Remove dasher and mash cream down, pour off salt water in bucket and repack 
the freezer, cover closely after cream is done and let stand 1 hour to "ripen." 

Ice cream loses its sweetness in freezing, so better have mixture a little too sweet 
rather than not sweet enough before freezing. 

VANILLA ICE CREAM 

For 1 quart of ice cream : Scald § cup milk and beat 1 egg until foamy with I cup 
of sugar, gradually pour the hot milk over this, pouring all back into pan again and 
let it come to a boil, stirring constantly to keep it from curdling. Let this cool, 
then add f cup sugar, 1 cup cream, 1 cup of milk and 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract. 
Put into can and freeze.

PEACH ICE CREAM 

For 1 quart of ice cream : Scald | cup milk and beat 1 egg until foamy with f cup 
sugar, then gradually pour the hot milk over this, pour all back into pan again and 
let it come to a boil, stirring constantly to keep from curdling. Let this cool, then 
add I cup of sugar, 1 cup cream, ^ cup milk and J cup peaches. Put into can 
and freeze. Peaches or any other fruits should be mashed through a colander or 
coarse sieve, so there will be no Ivimps to freeze hard. Let stand 1 hour to ripen 
before using. 

STRAWBERRY OR BANANA ICE CREAM 

Same as peach, substituting strawberries or bananas for peaches. 



9J- 



THREE OF A KIND 

Mix juice of 1 lemon, juice of 1 orange, 1 large banana mashed to a pulp, 1 cup 
sugar and about 3 cups of water. Put in freezer, and when about half frozen add 
J cup of cream, then freeze and serve.

BOILED COFFEE 

Use 1 heaping tablespoon coffee to each cup water. Grind the coffee moderately 
fine and put into a perfectly clean coffee pot. Add enough cold water to moisten 
the coffee, then pour the measured boiling water over, cover the pot closely and boil 
10 minutes. Then pour in half a cup of cold water, draw the pot to the side of the 
range and allow it to stand 5 minutes to settle before serving. Never let the coffee 
boil after the cold water has been added. If coffee is left over, pour it off the coffee 
grounds before cooled, reheat with water and less fresh ground coffee will be required 
in the next coffee making. Always thoroughly wash, scald and dry the coffee pot 
after using. It is better to buy whole coffee and grind it at home. Coffee should 
be kept in an airtight can, it retains the aroma better. 

DRIP COFFEE 

Use 1 heaping tablespoon of coffee to each cup of water. Have coffee pulverized 
or ground fine as possible, put in drip sack, pour boiling water over it slowly; 
when all water needed has been added, pour out half of the coffee in a big cup 
or pitcher and pour over the grounds once more. 

TEA 

Put tea in earthen tea pot and pour on boiling water. Use 1 teaspoon of tea for 

each cup of water; allow to draw for 5 minutes, then serve. Never boil tea nor '^ 

allow it to remain long on the leaves, for in either case tannin, which is a poison, ^ 

will be extracted. ^ 

ICE TEA ^ 

Make a strong tea, strain into a glass pitcher; to every pint of tea allow 1 tablespoon 
of lemon juice and sugar to taste. Add cracked ice and serve. 

COCOA 

Mix 3 tablespoons of cocoa and 5 tablespoons sugar with about | cup of water; 
add to this 2 cups of milk and 2 cups water, heat together. Stir constantly and 
boil 3 or 4 minutes, then serve. 

CHOCOLATE 

Scald 3 cups of milk. Melt 1^ squares bitter chocolate over hot water, add i cup 
of sugar and pinch of salt, stir in 1 cup of boiling water; when smooth boil for a 
minute, then add to the scalded milk. Flavor with 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract. 
Serve in chocolate cups with whipped cream.

The chief difference between canning and preserving is in the amount of sugar used. 
In canning, from | to | is the most common quantity, while in preserving, from 
f to equal parts may be required, according to the acidity of the fruit. 

Canning is the more economical method and possesses the advantage of retaining 
more nearly the fresh flavor of the fruit. With many housekeepers the chances 
that a jar of fruit will keep perfectly, or that it will spoil, are about even. Many 
consider it a question of luck, but if fruit is cooked thoroughly, placed in sterilized 
jars and properly sealed, it must keep, and can neither mold nor frement. The 
jars must be free from cracks and used for no other purposes than canning fruit. 
The rubbers must be new and sterilized at the same time as the jars; it is not 
economy to use old rubbers. 

To insure success, three rules must be followed: 

1 . All fruit used, while ripe, must not be over-ripe nor at all soft. 

2. Absolute cleanliness must be observed in everything used for cooking and 
storing the fruit; have all jars, covers, rubbers, spoons, etc., steriUzed immediately 
before using. 

3. Cover all jars or glasses while the contents are still scalding hot so that no 
spores of mold may reach the fruit. In the case of jellies, if not convenient to 
seal them at once, cover with sheets of glass while cooling. 

To sterilize utensils and receptacles used in jelly-making and canning, wash 
thoroughly and place in a pan, cover with cold water and bring to a fast boil. Fill 
each jar or glass as removed from the boiling water without allowing time to cool. 

Jelly bags may be made of cheese cloth or muslin. Before using, wet with cold 
water, otherwise some juice will be absorbed by the bag and wasted. 

Canned fruits are richer if cooked in a syrup instead of in water to which sugar is 
added to form a syrup after the fruit is cooked. 

TO PREPARE SYRUPS FOR CANNED FRUITS 
For plums, peaches, cherries, pears, blackberries and other sweet varieties of fruits, 
use one pound of sugar to a quart of water. 

For the more acid fruits, such as currants, sour cherries, etc., use 1 pound of sugar 
to a pint and a half of water.. The longer the sugar and water are cooked together 
the heavier the syrup will be. Cook without stirring to prevent crystalizing. 

As a general rule 15 minutes cooking after reaching the boiling point will be 
sufficient to sterilize fruits, with the exception of very seedy ones, such as currants, 
which will take a Httle longer owing to the viscous nature of the substance sur- 
rounding the seeds.

THE SELECTION OF FRUIT 
Be sure that it has .been freshly gathered on a dry day and is not over-ripe. The 
finest flavor does not develop till the fruit ripens, but the pectin, which is the jelly- 
ing principle, loses some of its properties immediately after this stage; therefore, use 
fruit that is rather under than over-ripe, especially for jelUes and preserves. 

When washing is necessary place the fruit, a little at a time, in a coUander and run 
water gently through and over it, draining well afterwards. Peaches can be pared 
without waste by dipping a few at a time in boiling water and removing the skin 
with a sharp knife, as one would remove the skin of a tomato. 

TO CAN FRUIT IN JARS OVER THE FIRE 
Fill the jars with prepared fruit and place in a steamer or other large vessel contain- 
ing warm water. The jars must be protected from the bottom and sides of the 
vessel and from each other, either by putting them in a rack made for the purpose, 
or by placing hay, excelsior or paper under and around them. Put on the covers, 
but do not screw them down. Let the water come within four inches of the top of 
the jars, and cover the cooking vessel to prevent the escape of steam. Cook for 
15 minutes after reaching boiling point; take out the jars, one at a time, fill with 
boiling syrup, cover and cool. Tighten the covers when the fruit is cold. 

TO CAN BY OPEN KETTLE PROCESS 
Make a syrup of any desired sweetness. If a very rich flavor is wanted, make a 
syrup from sugar and extra fruit juice instead of sugar and water. Prepare the 
fruit, cook it in the syrup till tender and then fill and seal the sterilized jars as usual. 
It is the sterihzing, not the quantity of sugar used, that insures the keeping of fruit. 



'2^'^ 






t^ 



m 



TO CAN WITHOUT COOKING 

This method is suitable for sour fruits, such as rhubarb and gooseberries. Cut the 
former into 2 inch lengths; top and tail the latter. Fill the jars with the fruit and 
run cold water from the faucet into them for 10 minutes. Seal as usual. The 
natural acid of the fruit will keep it without cooking. 

Always examine the jars carefully before putting away and be sure the covers 
are screwed as tightly as possible. It is a wise precaution to turn each jar upside 
down for a short time. 

As all canned fruits keep better in a dark, cool place, an excellent plan is to 
put each jar Into a red or blue paper bag, which protects it from light. 

Cherries require 8 minutes boihng, with 6 ounces of sugar to the pound. 

Strawberries require 12 minutes boiling, with 8 ounces of sugar to the pound. 

Peaches (in halves) require 10 minutes boiUng, with 6 ounces of sugar to the 
pound. 

Pears (in halves) require 20 minutes boiling, with 6 ounces of sugar to the pound. 

Raspberries require 10 minutes boiling, with 6 ounces of sugar to the pound. 

Blackberries require 10 minutes boiling, with 8 ounces of sugar to the pound. 

Pineapples (sliced) require 15 minutes boiling, with 8 ounces of sugar to the 
pound.

The ycwmgberry, whiih is a cross between a strain of loganberry 
, and a T^ti^ ^4ewb'erry, has attained great popularity in Calif o;rnia. 
The berries are very large, deep wine color to black and have, a de-

berry, bftM^erry, dewberry and a dash of logan- 
berry to five just the desired zest to contilast with 
their swfjetfless. 
**^ The seeds of the youngberry are soft and few 
in number and the cores, too, are tender, making 
youngberries a delicious fruit to eat fresh, to use 
for jama and jellies, for pies and in any of the 
otl^r yra,yHn which the other berries are utilized. 
N6xt week the youngberries will be at the 
height ' of their season, consequently they will be 
of finer quality and lower in price than at any 
tim^ To take advantage of these qualities it will 
bo advisable to make your quantity purchases for

As youngberries, like all the berries, have a low natural pectin 
content, it is best to add commercial pectin to them when making 
jams and jellies. Not only may one thus be sure of the texture of

then press edges firmly together, 
using floured tines of a fork. 
Sprinkle lightly with sugbr and

JELLY MAKING 






m 



All fruits for jelly making should be gathered just before they are fully ripe and 
on a dry day. Acid fruits are most suitable, as they contain more pectin (the 
jellying principle) than the sweeter varieties. 

Strawberries and blackberries are difficult to make jelly from without the addi- 
tion of some other fruit, such as apple, currant, etc. 

TO COVER JELLIES 

There are three methods in common use : 

1. Dip a round of paper in either alcohol or brandy, lay it on top of the jelly 
as soon as it is cold and then put the tin cover of the glass over the top. 

2. Dip a round of paper in slightly beaten white of egg, cover the glass with 
this and press down till the paper adheres closely. The paper must be large 
enough to overlap the top of the glass at least half an inch on all sides. 

3. Cover the jelly, when cold, with melted paraffine wax, having the wax quarter 
of an inch thick, as it contracts when cold, and if too thin a portion of the jelly will 
be left uncovered. 

CURRANT AND GRAPE JELLIES 
Pick over the fruit carefully and remove all foreign matter; put in a preserving 
kettle and crush to liberate the juice; heat till it flows freely, then place in a jelly 
bag previously wrung out of cold water and let the juice drip slowly. It may be 
left to drip over night. Measure, heat to boiling point, add the heated sugar, 
a pound to each pint of juice, and boil 5 minutes; skim if necessary; test, and if it 
jells,. pour at once into glasses. Cover according to any of the directions given. 

If a light, dehcate color is desired in making currant jelly, the stalks must be 
removed. This takes time, but the result warrants it. 

In some cases good jelly can be made by using only | of a pound of sugar to 1 
pint of juice. This applies to fruits which contain a large proportion of sugar 
in themselves and also when the season is exceptionally dry and sunny.

APPLE, PLUM, CRABAPPLE OR QUINCE JELLY 

Wash, wipe and stem, from apples, crabapples and quinces remove the blossom- 
qmnces need hard rubbing to remove the fuzz; from plums remove the stones.' 
Cut all fruits into convenient sized pieces, using a silver knife to prevent dis- 
coloration, and add water, for apples and crabapples half as much water as fruit, 
for the other kinds of fruit use a little less water as they have more juice of their 
own. Cook until tender and strain through a jelly bag. Measure the juice and 
add the sugar, pound to pint, unless the fruit is very sweet, when a Httle less should 
be used; cook till the juice jellies when a little is cooled in a saucer; then put into 
glasses and cover. It mtist be remembered that too long boiling destroys the 
jellying principle; consequently, the fruit must not be allowed to cook longer than 
necessary. 

If sugar is heated after measuring, the jelly will be clearer and jell more quickly. 
The heating can be done while the fruit is coming to the boiling point. 

Jellies made by the cold process are the most delicate, but are not likely to keep 
quite as well as when fruit juice and sugar are cooked together. The method 
followed is the same as for ordinary jelly so far as the cooking, straining and meas- 
uring of the fruit and juice are concerned. 

The sugar — pound for pint — is added to the strained juice and dissolved; the 
steriHzed glasses filled and covered with sheets of glass to keep out the dust and 
attract the rays of the sun, and the jellies left in a sunny place until set. They 
are then covered according to directions given.

HYGIENE. 

Health is merely a matter of right living. Disease is not an accident, it follows 
cause and effect as does every other condition or occurrence. jjj 

Disease comes because of the habits and environments of life that produce it, ^ 
while perfect health of body and mind is directly dependent on cleanliness, exercise 
and wholesome diet. 

The most important factor to the well being of man is cleanliness, both internal 
and external, therefore it is imperative to breathe fresh air and an abundance of it. 
Spend a sufficient time in the open air and ventilate all indoors properly and 
thoroughly; in other words, breathe enough fresh air to cleanse and purify the 
blood, drink enough pure water at intervals between meals to wash away and 
eliminate from the body all poisons, impurities, tissue waste and disease producing 
elements. 



Fresh air and pure water are the great purifying and cleansing agents of nature 
that make prolongation and continuance of life possible. Without them life could 
not endure. 

External cleanliness implies that you must bathe and bathe often, wash and wash 
clean in plenty of water and spare not the soap. Bathe the body once a day, 
preferably in the morning, dry thoroughly with a coarse towel and rub the entire 
body vigorously. Comb and brush the hair each day, using a coarse comb and a 
stiff bristle brush. Never use towel, brush or comb used by others. Snuff a 
little diluted salt water up the nostrils each morning and gargle the throat with the 
same. Brush the teeth each morning with a good tooth brush, using pure water, 
and do hkewise at night before retiring. Antiseptics, cosmetics and other toilet 
preparations imdoubtedly make more pleasant this daily.routine of body care. 

Cleanly surroimdings are also most important, as the home, its furiiishings' 
wearing apparel and all utensils employed in the preparation and serving of foods 
should be clean and sanitary. 

Exercise of the body and min,d are so .^sential to develop form and cultivate 
the senses and prevent ailments that fully 75% of all the ills that man is heir to 
such as nervousness, indigestion, constipation, general debility, anamia, poor 
circulation, headaches and like derangements may be positively overcome by right 
living and properly cooked food; whereas another 20% of all diseases may be 
avoided by cleanliness because all infections and contagious diseases are directly 
traceable to the negligence of hygiene or body cleanliness. 



m 



SUGGESTIONS FOR THE SICK ROOM 

Keep patient in a bright, sunny room, without carpet or draperies, so it can be 
t<f cleaned and aired often and easily. Dust with damp cloth and wipe flour; do not 
sweep.

Air the room by pulling down the windows -| foot from the top and raise at the 
bottom, but be sure to keep the patient out of a draught and have well covered 
with a blanket until room is warm. Keep bed linen clean and keep under sheet 
free from wrinkles. 

Enough care cannot be taken in preparing the food, Serve in the prettiest 
dishes and arrange food as daintly and appetizingly as possible. 

Do not serve too large a quantity of food; small portions are more attractive. 
Do not leave soiled dishes or water glasses stand in the sick room. Do not bump 
or sit on the bed, walk lightly, close doors softly and do not speak loud or whisper; 
an even, gentle tone is best. 



INVALID COOKING 

BEEF TEA 

The best cut of beef for beef tea is from the top round, as that contains the most and 
best flavored juice. Wipe the meat, remove the fat, scrape with a .sharp pointed 
knife or cut in very small pieces, and as fast as it is cut or scraped, put it in a glass 
jar containing cold water, allowing 1 pint of water to 1 pound of meat. Cold 
water draws out the juice. Cover and let stand J hour, then place the jar in a 
kettle of cold water (place something under the jar in the kettle to prevent jar 
breaking). Set the kettle on back part of the stove and allow water to heat slowly; 
keep it just below the boiling point for 2 hours. Press contents of jar through a 
strainer to obtain all the juice, and add salt to taste; heat over hot, not boiling 
water, before serving. Save the meat, mix with cold cooked, mashed or chopped 
potatoes, season well and make into' hash for the family, using more fat or butter 
in warming than in making other hash. 



u 

^J 



TOAST WATER 

Toast slices of bread slowly until they are very brown, but not burned. Break into 
small pieces and add boiling water, allowing 1 pint of water to IJ cups of toast. 
Let it stand for | hour. Strain through cheese cloth, season with salt and serve 
very hot or very cold. The bread may be browned in the oven instead of being 
toasted. Toast water is given in cases of extreme nausea. Sometimes it can be 
retained on the stomach when nothing else can. 



MUTTON BROTH 

Remove the skin and fat from I5 pounds of neck of mutton, cut in small pieces and 
put in a kettle or stewpan with 2 quarts cold water and 1 teaspoon salt. Heat 
slowly, skim and cook on the back of the stove for 3 or 4 hours, or till meat is in 
shreds. Strain, cool, skim off the fat and heat again to boiling point, add 2 table- 
spoons barley to the broth, letting it cook until very tender, then strain and serve 
very hot. Barley contains the most easily digested form of starch, and for that 
reason, as a rule, it is better for an invalid than rice. 
The mutton may be saved and used in the way as the beef from the beef tea.

Every Housekeeper Should Have at least J dozen each of the different house- 
hold linens, more towels and napkins, if possible. But no matter what the quantity,

absorb the grease. 

Bread, when stale, may be dried and put through the meat chopper; this makes 
it much finer than rolling and does not take so much time. 

Bread or cake when warm should be cut with hot knife; dip knife in hot water 
and wipe dry. 

Black Spots on dishes and discolorations on teacups are removed by damp 
salt.

Pans and kettles should be filled with cold water and allowed to soak, away 
from heat; never place them on the stove to soak, it only makes them more difficult 
to clean. 

Pillow Cases may be made out of linen or Holland shades that have been 
discarded and washed several times. 

Paint on white goods, when still fresh, can often be removed by simply soaping 
it well and then pouring water over it. 

Paint Stains, when dry and old, may be removed from cotton or woolen goods 
with chloroform. It is a good plan first to cover the spot with olive oil or butter 
to soften it. 

Roaches can be poisoned by placing cucumber peelings around their haunts. 
Raisins and Currants, if rolled in flour before putting into a cake, will not 
sink to the bottom. 

Soap and Water should never be used on varnished work. 

Salt added to the whites of eggs will make them whip better; just a pinch to 
each egg. 

Salt and Sugar mixed together will sometimes stop coughing. 

Soap dried and grated, mixed with com meal and borax, is an excellent cleanser 
and whitener for the hands. Mix 1 cup grated soap with 2 cups fine corn meal 
and 1 teaspoon powdered borax. 

Suet should be chopped in a cool place and sprinkled with flour to prevent 
sticking together. 

Salt will clean a bottle or vinegar cruet nicely. " Use plenty coarse salt and 
very little water, shake vigorously until clean, then rinse. 

Silverware may be cleaned with soft leather or chamois dampened with water, 
and dipped in prepared chalk. Do not use soap on silverware ; it will dull the luster. 

Soap boiled in water until dissolved is fine for washing the hair; it cleanses 
better than cake soap. Boil scraps and small pieces to a thin paste. 

Salt mixed with cornstarch in proportion 6 to 1 will prevent lumping in salt- 
cellar. 

Salt and Vinegar is the best thing for scouring copper kettles. 

Sugar added to the water used for basting roast beef will. give it a rich brown 
color. 

Sieves should not be washed with soap, but cleaned with a brush and clear 
water, using washing soda if necessary. 

Soap is injurious to oilcloth ; better clean with milk and water. 

Shoes when damp inside should be stuffed with paper ; it will absorb the moisture 
and prevent them getting hard. 

Salt, in solution, is an antidote for many poisons. 

Salt, used as a tooth-powder about once a week, hardens the gums, makes the 
teeth white and sweetens the breath. Use very fine salt.

Salt will oirdle new milk, hence in preparing porridge, gravies, etc., salt should 
not be added until the dish is prepared. 

Starch with a few drops of kerosene added will make the ironing easier. 

Tinware may be cleaned and brightened by scouring with powdered washing 
soda. 

Turpentine added to the water in which your clothes are boiled will whiten them. 

Tea Stains can be prevented from spreading and be removed by pouring clear 
boiling water through strained fabric. 

Utensils should be well cared for; nothing more quickly characterizes good 
housekeeping than the care of kitchen utensils. "A good workman loves and cares 
for his tools." Such utensils as turn with cranks and have oil in their bearings 
should not be left in water, as the oil is thus washed out and the utensil quickly 
spoiled. Clean well with clear hot water and dry thoroughly before putting away. 

Utensils of all kinds, such as pans, pots, skillets, etc., should be cleaned with 
as much care on the outside as on the inside. Use clean, hot, soapy water, changing 
as soon as it becomes greasy; wash and rinse the dish towel after each using. Keep 
things clean — "do not get them so once a week." 

Varnish or Paint spots in cotton or woolen goods may be removed by apply- 
ing oil of turpentine or benzine ; after using either, the goods should be washed in 
soap suds; 

Velvet can be restored and the pile raised by covering a hot smoothing iron 
with a wet cloth and holding the velvet firmly over it ; the vapor rising will raise 
the pile of the velvet with assistance of a light whisk. 

Vegetables to be used for salads should be soaked and washed in cold salt 
water to remove germs, insects and worms. 

Vases if filled J ivll of sand will not be blown or knocked over so easily. 

Windows that creak should be oiled at the rollers with machine oil. 

Windows should not be washed with soap unless greasy. Use soft rags and 
clear water and finish with chamois or rag that does not leave lint. 

WHEN SERVING 

First. — Food should always be set down before the guests from the right side. 

Second. — When a dish is presented from which a guest is to help himself, it 
should be passed from his left. 

Third.— When a course is finished, remove the plates from the left side. Most 
of the minor particulars of ser\ang depend entirely upon the number of assistants 
in attendance. 

WHAT NOT TO DO AT THE TABLE 

Don't lean on the table with your elbows, or sit far back in your chair. 
Don't eat soup from the point of your spoon. Dip from you toward the edge 
of the soup plate. 

Don't ask for a second helping of soup or fish. 

Don't cut potatoes with a knife. Don't leave a spoon standing in your tea cup.

Don't pile food on the back of the fork. 

Don't cross the knife and fork on the plate. Lay them side by side, handles 
together 

Don't dip bread in gravy, tea or coffee. 

Don't butter a whole slice of bread. Break it off in small bits and butter each 
before eating it. 

Don't fold your napkin after having partaken of a formal meal ; leave it unfolded ^ 

on the table. r. 

Don't use toothpicks in the presence of others. ^

SOME REASONS 

Why We Take Milk or Cream in our Coffee: Because tea and coffee both 
contain tannic acid, which has a strong affinity for albumen and therefore is apt 
to injure the coating of the stomach; but when milk or cream, both containing 
albumen, is added to tea or coffee, the tannic acid is neutralized and the lining of 
the stomach is protected. 

Why We Add Vinegar to a Salad Dressing: Not only because it tastes 
better, but for a chemical reason, which is as follows: Raw vegetables are easily 
enough digested by cows and horses, but with difficulty by the human stomach, 
because they contain that hard, fibrous substance, cellulose. Acids dissolve 
cellulose, and vinegar is an acid; that is why we take it with salad and cabbage, 
and doubtless that is why it tastes so good, for the palate is an excellent judge of 
what is good for the stomach. Oil is for the very good reason that it protects 
the lining of the stomach from the action of the acid in the vinegar. 

Why We Take Butter on Bread : Partly because flour does not contain fat, 
but primarily because butter contains a trifling quantity of a substance called 
"extractives," which in some unknown way stimulates and aids digestion. 

Why We Use Pepper, Mustard and Spices: Because they tickle the glands 
of the stomach and make them work, thereby producing an abundant supply of 
digestive juices; they also stir up the liver, and a stirring up of this organ is im- 
portant for people who live sedentary lives.
