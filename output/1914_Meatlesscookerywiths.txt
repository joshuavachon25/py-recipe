PREFACE 

Since auto-intoxication is now held to be the cause of many 
of the most serious diseases of humanity, too much stress can- 
not be laid upon the immediate necessity of looking into die 
question of diet and removing those foods which are re- 
sponsible for the cause of ill health. 

In the case of heart trouble and high blood pressure, with 
the accompanying deterioration of otJier organs, Dr. Bishop 
has found from prolonged observation that the offending 
substance most often appears in meat, eggs, hsh and meat 
stock soups, but is not the same in all cases. 

One has only to read the morning paper to note the num- 
ber of men and women, unfortunately most often those liv- 
ing at high pressure in solving some of the problems of our 
complex civilization, who arc cut down without warning. 
One must be irresponsive indeed not to be impressed by the 
fact that something is radically wrong in our present mode 
of life. 

In a double sense, the way to a man's heart is by the 
food he is given, and the more elaborate the food, the more 
quickly does his heart succumb to the strain put upon it. So 
it falls upon the women to meet this condition, and without 
delay. 

The insidiousness of auto-intoxication is that it runs on 
for some time without showing any outward effect, so that 
when the crash comes the years of slow poisoning must be 
counteracted in a few days, and the tragic part of It is, so 
often, it is too late. 

The design of diis book is to meet these conditions, and 



Digitized by V^iOOS IC 



to bring before the public an assortment of attractive recipes 
to compensate the epicure for the loss of those dishes which 
long habit and an increasingly jaded appetite demand. In 
its preparation much valuable material has been derived 
from the bulletins issued on the subject by the Department 
of Agriculture. 

The bulletin on cheese explains from the result of scien- 
tific experiment the desirability of giving cheese an impor- 
tant place in one's diet. In Jonson's time, cheese was used 
as we use meat now, for the principal dish of the meal, but it 
has come to be used as a relish or side dish. And when Na- 
ture rebels against a hearty meal of proteins with cheese 
added, we say complacently that it was the cheese that caused 
the trouble, and relegate it to the list of indigestibles. 

The Government report has exploded the fallacy, putting 
this nutritious food in its proper place, instead of an addi- 
tion to a menu already heavy with proteins. 

So one need not, like Nebuchadnezzar, subsist on grass 
alone just because meat has been condemned, for there are 
many delicious dishes to take its place. 

A vegetable gelatine has been put on the market, which is 
much more delicate than the old-fashioned animal gelatine 
and has not the objectionable odor. There are also vege- 
table and nut oils to be used instead of animal fat of doubt- 
ful purity, for sihortening and frying. Egg, white of egg 
and chicken dishes have been added at the end of the book 
to be at hand if they may be added to the menu. 

I am indebted for many of the recipes to my friends and 
to patients of Dr. Bishop who have been kind enough to 
share with us the result of their successful experience. Also 
to Dr. C. F. Langworthy, expert in charge of Nutrition In- 
vestigation of the United States Department of Agricul- 
ture, who has allowed portions of his diarts to be used and 
k^recipes from the bulletins. I am under especial obligation

to the cells of the body. The only way to limit the damage 
is to exclude the ofleniUng article of food from the diet. 

Another important point in the matter is, that when a 
person is sensitive to a particular kind of food, the cells 
are almost as much irritated by a little of this food as by 
a great deal, so that a diet, to be of much use, has to be a 
strict diet. 

Many failures can be laid at the door of slight indulgence 
in the type of food to whidi the person is sensitive. This 
may happen unconsciously or because of the belief liiat a 
little will not do any harm. It is hard for an untrained per- 
son to believe that food damage can be entirely independent 
of any discomfort, but such is the case. 

Food poisoning has generally existed for five or ten years 
before the heart is sufficiently damaged to cause distress on 
exertion. 

If the person goes under the care of a competent specialist 
before any discomfort begins, as in those rejected by life 
insurance or accidentally examined, the task of the physician 
is very hard. It is his duty to persuade such a person that 
a strict diet is necessary, but the sick person does not feel 
any discomfort from his high blood pressure or leaking 
heart, and so he is in no position to appredate any of the 
improvement that may result from the adherence to a 
diet. 

On the whole, it is a fortunate diing if pain and expres- 
sion in the chest develop early in heart disease, as it gives 
an opportunity for treatment before the disease has ad- 
vanced. 

My own experience is, that heart disease and hardening 
of die arteries have usually existed about five years at the 
time the sufferer comes under observation. 

This will not always be so because there is a strong move-

lent by the life insurance companies to bring about the 
acaniination at regular Intervals of all persons who are in- 
sured, so as to detect the symptomless disease in time, and 
effect an early cure. 

The things that do damage are usually found in the group 
including eggs, fish, meat and stoclt soups, but there is no 
definite way of determining which of these things is at fault. 

This has to be accomplished by the study of each indi- 
vidual person, by means of the absolute withdrawal of all 
those things until there is an improvement in the action of 
the heart and blood vessels. Now one article of food, and 
then another is added to the diet, and it Is discovered by 
experiment which one the person can use without a return 
of the disorder. 

In the beginning, it may be only eggs, or fish, or meat, 
that is a source of irritation to the cells of the body. In 
persons very seriously ill with hardening of the arteries, all 
of these things are a source of irritation. 

It is comparatively easy for a physician to say, " Don't 
eat any eggs," but it is very hard to conduct cooking on this 
basis, and the cutting out of meat malces a tremendous de- 
ficiency in the fare of most households. Stock soups and 
fish are also missed. 

Mrs. Gillmore, in this book, has undertaken to compile 
the experience of persons who have honestly attempted to 
restore the health and prolong the lives of members of their 
family by providing attractive meals, which, at the same 
time, complied with the requirements of persons who had to 
consider their hearts and blood vessels. 

Mrs. Gillmore has contributed to a work that will help 
other women in this problem, and will measurably assist in 
the checking of the advance of a class of diseases that is now 
claiming twice as many victims as it did thirty years ago

BUTTERMILK CORNMEAL MUSH 
White cornmeal cooked in buttermilk makes a dish which 
resembles cottage dieese in flavor. It should be served 
very cold with cream. In making it, allow one part of corn-

to eadi cup of meal. 

BREAKFAST CEREALS WITH CHEESE 
That cheese combined with cereal foods makes a rational 
di^ as regards the proportion of nutrients it supplies has 
been proved by dietitians. Cheese and some of the crisp 
" ready to serve " cereal breakfast foods is a combination 
which is common, the cheese being melted with the cereal ' 
food, or simply served with it. 

There are many who relish a piece of dieese with the 
cooked cereal so commonly eaten for breakfast, and Hnd 
such a combination satisfying to appetite and taste. Oat- 
meal or some other home-cooked breakfast cereal prepared 
with cheese Is palatable, and such dishes have an advantage 
in that they may be served without cream and sugar. Since 
such a dish contains considerably more protein than the 
breakfast cereals as ordinarily served, it has a further ad- 
vantage in that it may well serve as the principal item of 
a breakfast menu, instead of a preliminary to other courses. 
Such a combination as cereals cooked with cheese, toast, 
fruit, and chocolate, makes a palatable as well as nutritious 
breakfast.

BREAD 



Lewis Carroll. 



4 pounds and 2 ounces of dour i^ pints of water 
J4 ounce of yeast J4 ounce of salt 

A bread-mixer should be used in making this bread. Best 
seconds flour is better than superfine flour. The water must 
be warm, but not too hot to bear the hand in. Dissolve the 
yeast In the water; add the salt, and stir all well together. 
Pour the liquid into the bread-mixer. Now add the flour 
which must be sifted. Fasten the top on the mixer, and turn 
the handle for exactly three minutes. Remove the cover, 
and have ready a well-floured pastry-board. Take a large 
knife and remove the dough from the central screw, divide 
it into four equal parts, and place each part In a well- 
greased bread-tin. Let the tins stand in a warm place for 
one hour to rise. The plate rack above an ordinary kitchen 
stove is a good place. Then put them in a very moderately 
heated oven, and after the first twenty minutes increase the 
heat until it is hot, but not so hot as is required for pastry. 
The loaves must bake for an hour. Bread is much better 
baked in tins; but If tins are not used, the dough must be di- 
vided into four, and formed into round cakes and placed on 
the oven shelves, which must be first floured. Three-quarters

measuring the quantities. 

WHITE BREAD 

In a quart measure, dissolve one yeast cake, add one 
tablespoon of salt, three tablespoons of sugar, two tablci 
spoons melted butter. Fill the measure half milk and half 
water, lukewarm, and pour into bread-mixer. Add three 
quarts of sifted flour, and turn the handle for ten or Bfteen 
minutes. Cover and let it rise until double in bulk; when 
properly risen, turn the handle a few times to collect the 
dough on die kneading blade, and remove to the board. 
This makes (our loaves. 

MILK BREAD 

Scalded milk i^ tablespoons butter 

y^ cake compressed yeast ^ tablespoon of salt 

^ tablespoon sugar ij^ quarts sifted flour 

Put into a pint measure the butter, salt and one-half cup 
of boiling water. Fill it up with scalded milk. When luke- 
warm, stir and pour into bread-mixer, keeping back enough 
of the liquid to thoroughly dissolve the yeast. Add the dis- 
solved yeast to the other liquids in the bread-mixer and lasdy, 
the sifted flour, slightly warmed. Knead 5ve minutes in the 
mixer. Set away in a warm place for one and one-half hours 
or until the dough is light. Knead again for five minutes. 
Set away in a warm place for an hour or more until well 
risen. Turn upon a molding board and shape in loaves. 
Place in buttered pans, and put in a warm place until light. 
Bake in a hot oven three-fourths of an hour. Remove from 
the pan and place the loaves in such a position that the air 
will reach all sides. This will form a crisp crust. To ob- 
tain a soft crust, wrap in a cloth.

It was a common, though not general, practice in New 
England to add cooked pumpkin to the other ingredients In 
making such bread as this, very much as sweet potato is used 
in the South, The sweet potato or pumpkin changes the 
flavor of the bread somewhat and apparently facilitates the

tends to keep it moist. However, if sweet potato or pump- 
kin, either home cooked or canned, can not be conveniently 
obtained, good bread can be made without it.

FRIED PASTE 

When paste, made according to any of the recipes, has 
been kept two or three days, and it is not required for tarts, 
etc., a very nice dish can be made by rolling it out three- 
quarters of an inch thick, and stamping it into small rounds, 
and frying these in oil. The oil must not be quite so hot as 
for general frying. Test it by throwing in a bit of bread, 
and put in the paste as soon as the bread crisps, and before 
the oil is hot enough to brown it, then the paste will be done 
perfectly. 

The rounds of pastry should have sugar sifted over them, 
and be piled on a dish paper. Any stewed fruit may be 
served with them.

a bowl, and mix the baking powder thoroughly with it, first, 
however, taking out three tablespoons for working the pastry. 
Rub one portion of the butter into the flour, and mix it with 
as little of the water as will make the paste smooth. Roll 
this out until it is an inch thick, then divide into halves. Put 
one half aside, and roll out the other until it is very thin, less 
than a quarter of an inch in thickness. Break up the second 
portion of the butter into small bits, and lay these over the 
paste, leaving a margin of quite an inch to allow for the 
butter spreading in rolling. Dredge with flour, and fold in 
three, then roll out until the paste is an inch thick. Treat 
the other half in exactly the same manner, using the Aird 
portion of the butter. When this is done, place the two 
pieces on top of one another, and roll out until half an inch 
thick. Now fold the paste, and place it between two dishes, 
and put it aside in a cool place until next day. 

When rolling out the paste for tarts, take care to keep 
it one way of the -grain. If in using the cuttings they are 
placed straight, one on top of the other, the last bit of paste 
will be as light and flaky as the first used. 

PASTE PUFF, OLD RECIPE 
I pound of flour i pound of butter 

A teaspoon of baking powder 
Take three ounces of flour from the pound, to use for 
working up the paste, and put the remainder in a bowl, mixing 
it well with the baking-powder. Divide the butter into four 
portions, and rub one into die flour ; then mix with as much 
water as will make a perfectly smooth paste. Now roll out 
the paste to the thickness of a shilling, and break up the butter 
into bits the size of a hazel-nut, placing them over the paste. 
Dredge lightly with some of the flour taken out for working. 
Be careful to leave a margin of an inch to allow for the butter 
spreading in rolling. Fold the paste into four, and roll out

BREAD, ETC. 41 

again to the thickness of a shilling. Repeat these directions 
exactly, in working in the third and fourth parts of the butter. 
When all the butter has been used fold the paste into three, 
and once again lengthwise. Lay it in a deep dish, and cover 
closely, letting Jt stand in a cool place for at least twelve 
hours. This paste will keep two or three days without bak- 
ing unless the weather is very hot. Be very careful in mak- 
ing up the paste into tartlets, tarts, etc., to keep it the way of 
the grain in rolling out or as flakes lie. The cuttings if 
placed flat, one on top of the other, and rolled out, will then 
be just as light and flaky as when rolled out at first. Some 
cooks spoil quite a quarter of the paste in making tardets, 
etc., by not observing this rule, for If the cuttings are gath- 
ered up carelessly in the hand, and made into a ball, and then 
rolled out, all the work of the cook Is spoiled, for paste 
treated so will be very little better than ordinary short-paste.

^^P Take out two large tablespoons of the flour to work up the 
paste, and mix the rest with the baking-powder. When 
these have been well-mixed, rub in the butter, and stir in as 
much water as will make a rather stiff paste. Flour a pastry- 
board, and roll out the paste to half an inch in thickness. 
Fold the pastry In three, and roll out again, when It will be 
ready for use. Keep the board and roUIng-pIn well floured 
with the flour that was taken from the pound at first. This 
pastry can be used equally well for either fruit or vegetable 
pies. If the paste is to be kept several days before using 
it should be wrapped in a napkin and put in a cool place so 
no crust will be formed. In making paste everything should 
be cold and the dough handled as little as possible.

See that the flour ts thoroughly dry, and then sift it. 
Squeeze the butter in a doth to remove all moisture. Now 
put the butter in an enameled stewpan, and let it stand on 
the stove until it runs to oil. It is necessary to heat the 
oiled butter so that the scum will rise, but care must be 
taken that it does not get too hot. When all the scum has 
been removed, the stewpan should be put in a cooler part of 
the stove, so that the sediment may settle. Skim off the 



Digitized by V^iOOS IC 



BREAD, ETC. 

froth very carefully, and pour the oil in a basin, leaving the 
sediment at the bottom of the stewpan. Remove the sedi- 
ment from the stewpan, and pour back, the oil — now clari- 
fied butter — and sprinkle in the flour gradually, stirring 
all the time. Put the stewpan on a slow fire, turned tow, 
and stir continually with a wooden spoon. Keep scraping 
the bottom of the pan to prevent mixture burning; be very 
careful about the scraping or the stirring, or the roux will 
be spoiled. As soon as the mixture begins to color a very 
little, put half of it into a jar for white roux. It must not 
turn more than a cream color, as it is intended to thicken 
white soups and white sauces. Now return the saucepan to 
the fire, and continue the stirring and scraping until the re- 
maining roux has become a bright brown. Be careful that 
it does not get too dark; a light chocolate color is the cor- 
rect shade. Immediately the roux is dark enough, remove 
it from the stove at once, but continue stirring for some min- 
utes, as enameled stewpans retain the heat after fhey have 
been removed from the fire, and the mixture would burn 
if the stirring was discontinued at once. Have ready a large 
slice of onion, and throw it into the roux, if there is any fear 
that it is getting too dark; this checks the heat at once. This 
is brown roux for thickening brown soups and gravies. It 
will keep for weeks, and although the process seems rather 
troublesome, it really in the end saves time. 

In using the roux it is best to scrape off the quantity you 
require with a spoon, and not add it to the soups and sauces 
in a lump.

tomato and an equal quantity of water. It is not necessary 
to cook this before adding to the white sauce, except to bring 
it to the boiling point. The pinch of soda must be added, 
however, to counteract the acidity of the tomatoes.

CHEESE ROLLS 

A large variety of rolls may be made by combining leg- 
umes, either beans of various kinds, cowpeas, lentils or peas, 
with cheese of various kinds, and adding bread crumbs to 
make the mixture thick enough to form Into a roll. Beans 
are usually mashed, but peas or small lima beans may be 
combined whole with bread crumbs and grated cheese, and 
enough of the liquor in which the vegetables have been 
cooked may be added to get the right consistency. Or, in- 
stead of beans and peas, chopped spinach, beet tops or head 
lettuce may be used. Homemade cottage cheese and the 
soft cream cheese of commerce, standard cheese, or English 
dairy may be used. Variety may be obtained also by vary- 
ing the flavoring. Among the best are onion, chives and 
sweet pepper. These should be cooked before mixing with 
the roll. Other flavors are mustard, curry, chopped olives, 
onion juice and nutmeg.

Break the macaroni into one-inch lengths, and throw it 
into plenty of boiling water. Scald the onion, and stick a 
few cloves into it, add to the macaroni, and boil quickly 
until the macaroni is cooked but not broken. Pour off the 
water, and drain well. Have ready a batter made of milk 
and flour, made by putting the flour into a basin and adding 
the milk slowly, stirring all the time, till half of it is used; 
then beat the batter well till bubbles form on top. Add the 
rest of the milk, and let it stand till the macaroni is cooked; 
this makes the batter lighter. Cut the tomatoes in halves, 
and put them on a buttered baking tin in a moderate oven, 
with the rest of the ounce of butter in small bits on the top of 
them. Bake till just tender, but not broken. Make the

fry a light brown. Lift out of the oil, drain on white paper, 
reheat the oil, and continue to dip in batter, and fry in oil

pan constantly — one way — until the whole of the cheese is 
melted and thoroughly mixed with the macaroni. Turn It 
out on a dish, and serve hot as possible. Another way of 
serving the macaroni makes a prettier dish: Instead of 
adding the cheese and butter to the macaroni in the sauce- 
pan, a layer of the macaroni may be put on the bottom of 
a well-buttered French baking dish, and part of the cheese 
scattered over it; then the rest of the macaroni must be put 
over the cheese, and the remainder of the cheese used as 
before. The top should be covered with fine bread crumbs, 
and the butter taken and broken up in bits, and placed over 
the top. This dish should now be placed in a hot oven, and 
quickly browned. 

It is necessary to stir the macaroni occasionally when boil- 
ing quickly in the water, and after the milk has been added, 
it must be stirred frequently, or it will stick to the pan and 
spoil.

J/^ pound onions Pepper and salt 

Break the macaroni into two-inch lengths, and throw it 
into plenty of fast-boiling water, and let it boil quickly, stir- 
ring occasionally, for half an hour, and then drain the water 
from it. Now add the milk with pepper and salt, and let it 
boil up quickly, and then simmer for another half hour, when 
the macaroni should be quite tender. Stir frequently to 
prevent It sticking to the pan. 

The onions In the meantime should have been peeled, 
sliced and boiled until tender in plenty of water. They 
must then be drained and slightly chopped. The tomatoes 
also must be thrown into boiling water for a few seconds, 
and when removed the skins will come off quite easily; they 
must now be sliced. 

Butter a good-sized French baking dish, and scatter in 
some bread crumbs; shake out ail that do not stick to the 
butter. Place a layer of macaroni at the bottom of the 
dish, and scatter over it a third part of the Parmesan. Over 
that place the chopped onions and then the sliced tomatoes, 
and then the remainder of the macaroni. Cover this with 
half the remaining Parmesan, and over that scatter the rest 
of the bread crumbs. Now scatter the last of the Parme- 
san, and over that the butter, broken up into small pieces, 
and place over top. Bake for about twenty minutes In a hot 
oven; it should be a rich brown all over. This is an excel- 
lent dish, and well repays the cook's trouble, If attention Is 
paid to all the details. If Genoa macaroni is used it re- 
quires a longer time to prepare than Naples. Twenty min- 
utes in the water is long enough for Naples. Macaroni 
should always be served hot as it becomes pasty when cold.

POLENTA 

This dish, which is common in Italy, differs little, except 
in name, from hasty pudding, though it is served in very 
different ways. Sometimes cheese is added during the cook- 
ing. Polenta is often reheated with tomato sauce. The 
dish is improved by sprinkling each layer of polenta with 
cheese. When the polenta is to be reheated, it is well to 
cut it into small pieces in order that the sauce may be well 
distributed through the dish.

FRIED CORN MEAL MUSH 
Padcing hasty pudding in granite pans, cutting it into 
slices and frying it makes a good dish. In Italy, polenta is 
spread out in thin layers on a board, and cut in small blocks. 
These blocks are crumbed and fried in deep oil or butter. 
Another method is to mix corn meal in three times its value 
of water, and cook it in water only long enough to form a 
mush, and complete the cooking by frying the meal in butter. 
This is not so stiff as ordinary fried corn meal mush. 
CORN MEAL MUSH WITH FRUIT 
Com meal mush is often served with dried fruits, par- 
ticularly with tigs and dates. In preparing such fruit for 
use with the mush, it is usually necessary to soften it. This 
can easily be accomplished by washing the fruit and then 
heating it in a slow oven. As a result of the heat the water 
remaining on the fruit is absorbed and the fruit softened 
and also dried on the surface. 

CORN MEAL MUSH WITH CHEESE 
For this dish yellow corn meal is usually used. For a 
mush made with one cup of yellow corn meal the usual allow- 
ance is one-half cup, or two ounces, of grated cheese. There 
is, however, no limit to the amount of cheese which can be 
added, and the addition of cheese tends not only to make a 
highly nitrogenous and nourishing dish, but also to make a 
dish which can be eaten without the addition of butter and 
cream. Like the ordinary com meal mush, it is often 
fried either in deep fat, after having been crumbed, or in a 
small amount of fat.

and stir thoroughly, using water enough to make a stiff 
paste. Form portions of paste into Hat dumplings about 
three inches in diameter. Have ready a kettle of boiling 
water and drop the dumplings in carefully, cover, and cook 
twenty minutes. These dumplings are often cooked mth 
turnip tops or other greens. Some cooks dredge the dump- 
lings with flour before boiling them. 

CORN MEAL CUTLETS 

Tiim com meal mush into bread tins previously wet with 

cold water; when cold, slice. Dip the sliced mush into 

bread crumbs. Place in a buttered pan, and bake in a quick 

oven until a rich brown. Serve with butter or maple syrup. 

BREAD CUTLETS 

Cut some neat slices of brown or white bread half an inch 
thick. Remove crust, and cut into large fingers; soak them 
in a mixture composed of milk, a little flour and sweet herbs 
and seasoning, and fry crisp, either in butter or oil. 

MUSHROOMS IN CREAM 
Peel and trim one pound of mushrooms and put them in a

BOILED ASPARAGUS 

Untie the bunch of asparagus, cut oS the tough portion 
of the stalk, remove the scales, and wash very thoroughly. 
When thoroughly cleansed, retie with a white tape wide 
enough not to cut the asparagus. Stand in a kettle of boil- 
ing, salted water, and cook uncovered for ten minutes, al- 
lowing the tips to remain out of the water. Then lay the 
bunch down so that it is wholly covered with water, and cook 
another five minutes. Remove from the water, and serve 
with a dressing of melted butter. If desired, the asparagus 
may be served on toast. The asparagus may be cut in small 
pieces and cooked if preferred.

Allow a tablespoon of butter to a pint of cooked cabbage. 
Have the kitchen windows open at the top while the cabbage* 
is boiling, and there will be little if any odor of cabbage in

water, and bring them quickly to the boiling point; skim 
them, and let them boil for twenty minutes. Drain them 
carefully, and put them into a buttered baking dish, add a 
little pepper and salt, and break the remainder of the butter 
in bits, and place it over the onions. Put them in a hot oven 
for a quarter of an hour. Now remove the dish from the 
oven, and sprinkle the grated cheese over the onions — do 
this very quickly — return to the oven until the cheese is 
melted and slightly browned, which should be in ten min- 
utes or less. Serve immediately. 

The white onions are the most delicate and are therefore 
more suitable as a vegetable than the yellow or red variety.

By controlling the temperature in heating the buttermilk,

gators that this cream is suitable for eating on bread in place 
of butter. 

DEVONSHIRE CREAM 

Devonshire cream somewhat resembles sweet cream in 
flavor and consistency. It is very much liked in England, 
where it is commonly eaten with fresh or preserved fruit, 
but is not so well known in America. 

To make Devonshire cream, allow a pan of whole milk 
to stand for twenty-four hours In a cool place or for twelve 
hours in a warmer place. Place the pan on the cooler part 
of the stove, and heat until the milk is very hot, but not to 
the boiling point. If heated too much, a thick skin will 
form on the surface. The more slowly the milk is heated, 
the better. Having been heated, the milk should be kept 
in a cool place fctr twenty-four hours, and then skimmed. 
The thick cream obtained has a characteristic flavor and 
texture.

Canned beans may be used if fresh ones are not obtainable. 
They should be cut into half-inch lengths. Vegetables other 
than those mentioned may be used. Cauliflower, beets, 
peas, celery, etc., may be substituted if desired. Two or 
three vegetables only may be used ; mix the vegetables with 
the French dressing. Garnish the salad with lettuce leaves. 

MACEDOINE SALAD NO. a 
Take one cupful each of cooked and diced carrots, flower- 
ets of cauliflower, diced beets, and artichoke bottoms, and 
add one cup of peas, one cup of asparagus tips, and one cup 
of fine cut string beans. Mix them lightly with Frendi 
dressing and serve on lettuce. This makes a better looking 
dish if the vegetables are cut with a potato scoop or a fancy 
cutter. If served on individual plates use the inside leaves 
of the lettuce which are curled like a cup. Place one leaf 
on each plate and fill with the mecedoine or arrange several 
leaves to form a cup.

CHEESE SALAD AND PRESERVES 

Epicures have devised a dish which consists of lettuce mth 
French dressing served with cream cheese and thick prepara- 
tions of currants or other fruits preserved in honey or sugar, 
which, owing to the fact that the seeds have been extracted 
by a laborious process, are fairly expensive. The soft 
cheese often found in market is also relatively expensive. 
There is a suggestion in this dish, however, for others which 
are much less costly. Buttermilk cream or ordinary cottage 
cheese served with lettuce or other green salad and a small 
amount of rich homemade preserves, is a combination with 
much the same character, and also very appetizing. 

CHEESE AND OLIVE SALAD 
Mash a cream cheese, and season with salt and paprika.

pepper and mustard. Stir over the fire or a gas-ring until it 
is quite melted. Have ready a piece of buttered toast about 
four inches square. Pour the cheese evenly over the toast,

PRUNE TOAST 

Wash, and soak sweet California prunes over night in cold 
water. Simmer on the back of the range for one to two 
hours, or until perfectly tender. Remove the seeds, and 
rub the prunes through a colander. When ready to serve, 
dip thoroughly toasted slices of bread or zwieback quickly 
in hot milk. Serve as individual portions on small plates- 
Over each slice put a spoonful of the prune puree. If de- 
sired this may be served with thin cream. 

FRUIT TOAST 
For each serving, allow one slice of crisp toasted bread 
and one-half cup of a fruit sauce such as apple sauce, peach 
sauce, etc. If berries or fruit juices are used, thicken with 
cornstarch in the proportion of two teaspoons of cornstarch 
to one of the liquid or sauce. If desired two slices of 
breakfast toast or one slice of zwieback may be substituted 
for the toasted bread.

CREAMED CELERY ON TOAST 

3 cups cut celery i tablespoon butter 

1 cup milk I tablespoon flour 

J4 teaspoon salt 
Clean, scrape and cut enough celery to make three cups. 
Cook until tender in boiling, salted water, which will require 
about forty-five minutes. Let the water boil away when 
done, leaving the celery with very little liquid. Prepare a 
thin white sauce of the remaining ingredients, and pour over 
the celery. Prepare the toast by trimming the crust from 
thin slices of bread. Cut diagonally, making triangular- 
shaped pieces of toast. Toast in a moderate oven until 
crisp. Dip slices of crisp toast into some hot milk or cream. 
Serve with a spoonful of the creamed celery upon each slice.

CREAMED OKRA ON TOAST 

To cook the okra pods put them in boiling water, using 
one teaspoon of salt to a quart of water; add one tablespoon 
of lemon juice to the water also. Cook about one-half hour 
or until the okra is tender. Drain the water from the okra, 
reserving one cup of it for the sauce. Prepare the sauce as 
follows : 

I cup water from the okra Y^ cup millc 

J^ cup cream 34 cup strained tomatoes 

I teaspoon salt 2 tablespoons flour 

2 tablespoons butter 

Heat the okra water, the cream and milk in a double 
boiler. Rub the flour and butter together, and pour over it 
a little of the heated liquid, stirring meanwhile. When 
mixed thin enough to pour, turn this back into the remainder 
of the hot liquid. Set In a double boiler, and stir until 
thickened. Add the salt and strained tomato just before 
serving. Place three or four of the okra pods on a nicely 
toasted slice of bread for each serving, and over this pour 
a spoonful or more of the prepared sauce. 

APSLEY RUSKS 
This form of toasted bread is much more easily digested 
than toast, as it is more completely cooked. The bread used 
in making the rusks must be at least three or four days old; 
new bread is difficult to cut into thin slices. The oven must 
be moderate, and the time taken in cooking will van- with

TOASTS 

its heat, averaging from twenty minutes to half an hour. 
Cut the bread thin, and place on the oven shelf or on a slide 
that fits on to the oven shelf, and can be taken in and out 
easily. The rusks must be carefully watched and turned, 
as they become brown on one side, and should be made fresh 
each day. 

CROUTONS 
Cut some slices of stale bread about half an inch thick. 
If the croutons are required for soup they should be cut into 
dice, but if for garnishing they may be stamped into any 
shape, or cut into three-cornered pieces. Fry them in hot 
salad oil, and drain them on an inverted sieve. 

BREAD -RASPINGS 
All pieces of bread should be put aside in a clean bowl, 
and when enough has been saved to fill a good-sized baking- 
tin, they should be baked, in a slow oven until they are a 
rich golden color all through. They should then be rolled 
on a pastry-board — a small quantity at a time — until they 
are fine enough for use, and then put into a biscuit-box with 
a well-fitting lid, which should be kept in a dry place. These 
raspings are used in many recipes, and a good supply should 
always be kept on hand. They are not only better and more 
easily digested than ordinary bread-crumbs, but they are 
much more economical, and are the means of every scrap 
of bread being utilized. As the rolling would scratch and 
dent the board and rolling-pin used for pastry, — and it is 
necessary to keep them perfectly smooth — a special rolling- 
pin and board should be kept for this purpose.

UNCOOKED CURD, OR FRENCH COTTAGE CHEESE 

The French make cheese from sour milk without heating 
it They pour the milk into earthen molds which have holes 
in the bottom. A very fine sieve may be used instead of the 
molds. The whey drips out, and the curd assumes a cus- 
tard-like consistency, and takes the shape of a mold. When 
sufficiently stiff, the cheese is chilled, and is eaten with sweet 
cream and sugar. It is a staple dessert in many French fam- 
ilies, especially in hot weather, and is delicious served with 
acid fruit, such as currants, or with strawberries. 

BUTTERMILK CHEESE 

To make the buttermilk cheese, heat buttermilk gradually 
to about 130 or 140 degrees F. Allow it to cool, and strain 
it. As the curd will settle to the bottom, most of the whey 
may be poured od before the draining is begun. 

This cheese is, of course, almost wholly without fat, and 
yet, probably because the particles of curd are very finely 
divided, it has a smooth consistency, which suggests the pres- 
ence of fat. It may be served seasoned with salt only, or 
it may be mixed with butter or cream and seasonings. It is 
suitable for combining with olives and pimientos, or for any 
use to which the ordinary cream cheeses are put. 

CHEESE WAFERS 
Butter thin crackers, and sprinkle thickly with grated 
cheese. Put in the oven, and bake until the cheese is melted

and the crackers are a delicate brown. Serve with salad 
or soup. 

CHEESE RELISH 
Spread bread which has been toasted or fried in deep oil 
with grated cheese, or with grated cheese mixed with a little 
mustard; then heat in the oven until the cheese is melted. 
This may be served with salad, or as a relish to give flavor 
to some dish such as boiled rice or hominy, which has no very 
marked flavor. 

CREAMED CHEESE ON WAFERS 
Mix Yogurt or Neufchatel cheese with just enough cream 
to form a heavy paste. Mix until smooth; form in rosettes 
by forcing through a pastry tube. Pipe the rosette in the 
center of a wafer or thin cracker, and put a bit of colored 
jelly on two opposite corners, or if preferred, a small rosette 
may be piped on each corner and a bit of bright colored Jelly 
placed in the center. 

BUTTER BALLS 

Cut the butter in small pieces the size of the balls desired, 
and put them In ice-water. Soak the butter paddles in boil- 
ing water ten minutes; then chill in ice water. Hold a pad- 
dle in the left hand, put on it a piece of butter and roll with 
the right paddle until round. If butter sticks, it must be 
chilled longer, or the paddles may be rubbed with salt and re- 
heated. 

SALTED ALMONDS

Cook the condensed tomato slowly one-half hour. Add 
the grated onion, sugar, cloves, cinnamon, and cook one- 
half hour longer. Then add the lemon juice. 

Canned tomatoes may be used instead of condensed to- 
matoes, in which case it will be necessary to use three pints. 
Cook them until reduced to one pint. Rub them through a 
colander, and proceed the same as above directed. 

POLISH SALAD

pickles, and mix all thoroughly in a bowl, and sprinkle over 
them a scant half teaspoon of white pepper, a heaping table- 
spoon sugar and a pinch of salt if necessary. Pour enough 
white wine vinegar over all to just cover. 
PICCALILLI 

Take one-half peck green tomatoes, two cabbages, nine 
onions, twelve cucumbers, six green peppers and one-quarter 
pound mustard seed. Chop all very fine. Make a strong 
brine of salt water, and boil the chopped piccalilli in it for 
about five minutes. Remove from the fire, and press out 
every drop of the brine; then mix in the mustard seed, and 
put a!I in a stone crock. Boil a gallon of pickling vinegar, 
and pour over hot. It may be used as soon as cold. 
TO MAKE FRESH CURD 

Take one pint of milk and one dessertspoon of essence of 
rennet. 

Warm the milk to blood heat on the fire, remove, and then 
add the rennet; let it stand aside until set, about an hour. 
Place the aird on a hair sieve, and put a plate on top of it, 
applying gentle pressure for about a minute, and then place 
a five pound weight on the plate and leave it to drip for about 
a quarter of an hour. Remove the weight and plate, scrap- 
ing up the curd into a heap, and repeat the pressing process, 
in all about three or four times to the hour. At the end of 
the hour an eleven pound weight may be put on and left on 
for another hour, at the end of which time the curd will be 
free from whey and of the consistency of tender fish. Fresh 
country milk will take a much less shorter time to set, say 
ten minutes, and require less rennet. Another way of get- 
ting the whey out of the curd is to hang it up in a cheesecloth 
to drain. This will take several hours, but the result is 
satisfactory. Curd may be flavored with vanilla, ginger, 
nutmeg, etc., added to the milk before warming.

VEGETABLE GELATINE 

An endless host. 

Of syllabubs and jellies and mince-pies. 

And other such lady-like luxuries. 

Shbllet. 

GENERAL DIRECTIONS FOR THE USB OF 
VEGETABLE GELATINE 

Soak the vegetable gelatine in warm water for twenty 
to thirty minutes. Remove from this water, and cook in 
boiling water — three cups to the box — keeping covered 
while cooking. Let it boil eight to ten minutes, or until it is 
perfectly clear. Strain through a wire sieve, or strainer. 

A box of the gelatine will solidify eleven cups, or nearly 
three quarts of liquid, inclusive of the water in which the 
gelatine is cooked. 

When a firm jelly which can be turned out of a mold is 
desired, use two cups of liquid to one cup of cooked vegetable 
gelatine — one-third box cooked in one cup of boiling water. 

A more delicate jelly, which may be served in the dish in 
which it is cooled, is made by using two and one-half to two 
and three-quarters cups of liquid to one cup of cooked veg- 
etable gelatine. 

Vegetable gelatine hardens in a few minutes at ordinary 
room temperature. 

Do not move jelly from molds until ready to serve.

BAKED APPLES 
6 medium-sized ^ples I cup water 

I lemon ^ cup sugar 

Wipe, core, and pare the apples. Put in baking dish 
with a slice of lemon on top of each. Make a syrup of 
the sugar and water. Pour around the apples, cover, and 
bake slowly until soft. Serve cold with cream or with one 
teaspoon jelly in the center of each apple. If desired, the 
apples may also be flavored with doves by placing four 
cloves in die side of each apple at an even distance apart. 

Sweet apples are always tough when cooked. The acid 
of the lemon helps to soften the cellulose of the apple. The 
skins of the apple break when baking because the steam of 
the apple must escape, therefore it forces an opening in the 
thinnest part of the skin. A line cut around the center of 
the apple will prevent its breaking. Basting apples ^ile 
cooking makes the skin tender. 

Steamed apples are served for baking apples in many of 
the best hotels and restaurants, as they retain their color 
and flavor much better than when baked. 

MAPLE APPLE 
1 cup maple syrup i cup water 

4 medium-sized apples 
Pare and core the apples. Heat the water and syrup to 
the boiling point. Drop the apples into the heated liquid, 
turning often in order to insure cooking uniformly. Re- 
move the apples when tender. Allow the liquid to cook 
down to a syrupy consistency, and pour over the apples.

fill the center of each apple with one tablespoon of htmcy 
and one teaspoon of butter; add the cup of hot water; cover 
the pan, and set In a rather quick oven. When the boiling 
point is reached, reduce the heat^ so that the apples will 
conk gently. Turn the apples occasionally; a few minutes 
before the baking is finished remove the cover, and let the 
apples brown slighdy. Serve with whipped cream. 

APPLE FRITTERS 
Appl« Batter 

Peel, and core the apples, and cut them into thiii slices; 
dip them in the batter, and fry in boiling oil. The fritten 
will be much improved if the slices of apples are boiled 
for one minute in sugar and water, and drained before dip- 
ping them in the batter.

oiu'-tliird of an inch thick, put on a cover, and bake in a 
iliili'k oven. When the crust is cooked, raise it carefully 
with a knife to see whether the apples are soft, and if not

soaked in, and strain it over them, leaving the sediment. 
Add the sugar, and let them boil up quickly, when they must 
be well skimmed. Now put them where they will simmer 
slowly, until they are quite tender but unbroken and they 
have turned a rich brown. This will take between three and 
four hours. If Normandy pippins are cooked quickly they 
are quite spoiled. 

APPLES WITH ROLLED OATS

Cook the rolled oats. Pare the apples, and cook in a 
syrup of the water and sugar. Turn frequently. When 
the apples arc done, fill the centers with cooked rolled oats. 
Boil down the syrup until of a rather thick consistency, and 
pour over the apples. Other left over cereals may be used 
in the same way. 



NORMANDY PUDDING 



* bread crumbs

6 small sour cooking apples 

Peel, slice and core the apples, or chop them up not too 
finely ; put them with all the other dry ingredients in a basin, 
and stir well. When thoroughly mixed, add the lemon 
juice and the finely grated rind of a half of it; also, a little 
brandy or rum if liked. Pour the mixture into a well 
greased mold, and tie over a greased cloth or paper, and 
steam for about three hours. Serve with white wine sauce. 
The use of rum or brandy is optional. The pudding Is much 
more tasty if one or the other is added. Serve both the 
sauce and the pudding very hot as the latter is not so delicious 
vhen cold.

ginger if preferred. 

APPLE JELLY NO. 2 
6 pounds of apples 3 pints of water 

Lump sugar 

Peel, core, and cut up the apples, and bake in a stew jar 
with three pints of water. When a pulp, turn into a jelly 
bag, and hang over a pan all night for juice to run through. 
To every pint of juice add one pound lump sugar, and boil 
one hour; when properly done, it will be stiff. Put into air- 
tight jars. 

APPLE MOLD 
4 pounds of apples 1 pound lump sugar 

Wipe the apples quite clean, core, and cut them up, and 
put in a stew jar in the oven with a little sugar sprinkled 
over, and stew till quite soft, and allow to cool. When cold, 
rub through a sieve. Rinse a preserving pan with cold 
water and put in the pulp, together with the sugar, and boil 
about half an hour, stirring all the time. It requires great 
care to prevent burning, and must be boiled quickly, or it 
will not set firmly in the mold, which must be rinsed with 
cold water before putting in the jelly. 

APPLE PUDDING 
Paste Apples Sugar 

Line a pudding bowl with paste according to recipe for 
paste for puddings. Fill it with sliced apples, and sweeten 
to taste. Put on cover of paste, and steam. A pudding

Scatter some finely shaved mild full-cream cheese over each 
layer of apple. When the dish is full, scatter bread crumbs 
over the top, and bake thirty to forty-five minutes, placing 
the dish in a pan of water so that the pudding will not bum. 
If preferred, this may be sweetened with molasses mixed 
with an equal amount of hot water, and poured over the 
top, a half cup of molasses being sufficient for a quart pud- 
ding dishful. 

Cheese may be used in place of butter in a similar way in 
other apple puddings. Apple pie made with a layer of finely 
shaved cheese over the seasoned apple and baked in the usual 
way is liked by many who are fond of cheese served with 
apple pie.

To draw the juice from the berries, put them in a jar, and 
bruise them slightly; then place the jar in a pan of boiling 
water and keep it boiling gently until the juice flows freely. 
Lay a piece of muslin in a iirie sieve, and pour the juice into it 
until no more flows; then turn the fruit into the sieve, and 
leave it to let the juice drain away from it, but it must not be 
pressed or the juice will be muddy. Measure the juice care- 
fully, and add the sugar in lumps, in the quantity given. 
Let it boil gently, and skim it carefully. When it has boiled 
for half an hour, pour a teaspoon on a cold plate, and if it 
sets the jelly is done; if not, let it boil a little longer. Put 
it in small pots, and cover when cold in the usual way. The 
flavor is much improved by one part of red currant juice 
being used to two parts of raspberry.

6 ounces sugar Paste 

Pick the gooseberries, and put them in a tart dish; cover 
them with sugar, and put in the water. Cover with paste, 
and bake in hot oven. When the paste is baked, it is better 
to place the tart on the top of the stove to simmer until the 
gooseberries are quite tender. If the crust is carefully 
lifted with a knife, a skewer may be inserted to see whether 
the gooseberries are sufficiently cooked, as the tart will be 
spoiled unless they are quite soft.

Put the green gages in a stewpan, and pour over them suf- 
ficient water to cover them, and let them boil up quickly, and 
continue boiling for a minute. Now turn them carefully in a 
colander, and as soon as they are cool enough to touch, 
remove the skins; they will come off quite easily. Make a 
syrup with the sugar and water, but do not let it boil after the 
sugar is melted. As each green gage has the skin removed 
drop it into the syrup. Bring them to boiling point, but do 
not let them boil; they must simmer very gendy for an hour. 
If they are carefully done they will be unbroken when they 
are cooked. All plums are much better by having the skins 
removed, as most of the acid which disagrees with many 
people is in the skins. 

DAMSON CHEESE

Thoroughly clean as many damsons as desired, break the 
skins with a fork, put into jars to stew in the oven till ten- 
der, sprinkling with sugar. When quite soft allow them 
to cool; then rub through a sieve, and to every pound of 
fruit add nine ounces of sugar. Put them in the preserving 
pan — rinsed out with cold water first — and boil until it 
is set. A few of the kernels blanched and sprinkled in when 
boiling is an improvement.

ter of the flour, and pour in gradually one cup of lukewarm 
water, a pinch of salt and a tablespoon of butter. Stir this 
slowly, making a smooth dough of it and adding a little 
more flour if necessary. Cover the dough, and set it in a 
warm place until you have pared half a peck of apples, and 
cut them very fine in this way: Pare, quarter, and take 
out the cores and seeds, and cut them very fine. Now cover 
the table with a clean cloth, sift flour all over it, and roll out 
the dough as thin as possible. Put your hands under the 
rolled dough, and stretch it gently so as to not tear it, walk- 
ing all around the table as you do this to get it even and as 
thin as tissue paper. Pour a few tablespoons of melted 
butter over the dough; then the apples, brown sugar, cinna- 
mon and raisins. Now take hold of the tablecloth with 
both hands about a yard apart, and begin to roll the dough,

BAKED EGGS WITH CHEESE 
4 whites of eggs J4 teaspoon salt 

I cup or four ounces grated cheese A few grains cayenne 
I cup fine, stale bread crumbs 

Break whites of e^s into buttered baking d^sh, or into 
ramequins, and cook them in a hot oven until they begin to 
turn white around the edge. Cover with the mixture of 
crumbs, cheese, and seasonings. Brown in a very hot oven. 
In preparing this dish, it is essential that the oven be very 
hot or the egg will be too much cooked by the time the cheese 
is brown. To avoid this, cover the eggs with white sauce be- 
fore adding the crumbs. 

The food value of this dish is very close to that of a 
pound of beef of average composition. 

For those who are particularly fond of cheese the amount 
of cheese in this recipe may be very much increased, thus 
making a much more nourishing dish. Or the amount may 
be reduced so as to give hardly more than a suggestion of 
the flavor of cheese.

MEATLESS COOKERY 



WITH SPECIAL REFERENCE TO 

DIET FOR HEART DISEASE, BLOOD PRESSURE 

AND AUTOINTOXICATION 



COMPILED BY 
MARIA MCILVAINE GILLMORE 



INTRODUCTION BY 

LOUIS FAUGERES BISHOP, M.D. 

Clinical Professor of Heart and Circulatory Diseases 
\ Fordham University 



Health is the second blessing that we mortals are capable oft 
a blessing that money cannot buy. — Izaak Walton.

To 

All those who are concerned in the prolongation of life 
this book is hopefully dedicated 



PREFACE 

Since auto-intoxication is now held to be the cause of many 
of the most serious diseases of humanity, too much stress can- 
not be laid upon the immediate necessity of looking into the 
question of diet and removing those foods which are re- 
sponsible for the cause of ill health. 

In the case of heart trouble and high blood pressure, with 
the accompanying deterioration of other organs, Dr. Bishop 
has found from prolonged observation that the offending 
substance most often appears in meat, eggs, fish and meat 
stock soups, but is not the same in all cases. 

One has only to read the morning paper to note the num- 
ber of men and women, unfortunately most often those liv- 
ing at high pressure in solving some of the problems of our 
complex civilization, who are cut down without warning. 
One must be irresponsive indeed not to be impressed by the 
fact that something is radically wrong in our present mode 
of life. 

In a double sense, the way to a man's heart is by the 
food he is given, and the more elaborate the food, the more 
quickly does his heart succumb to the strain put upon it. So 
it falls upon the women to meet this condition, and without 
delay. 

The insidiousness of auto-intoxication is that it runs on 
for some time without showing any outward effect, so that 
when the crash comes the years of slow poisoning must be 
counteracted in a few days, and the tragic part of it is, so 
often, it is too late. 

The design of this book is to meet these conditions, and 



PREFACE 

to bring before the public an assortment of attractive recipes 
to compensate the epicure for the loss of those dishes which 
long habit and an 'increasingly jaded appetite demand. In 
its preparation much valuable material has been derived 
from the bulletins issued on the subject by the Department 
of Agriculture. 

The bulletin on cheese explains from the result of scien- 
tific experiment the desirability of giving cheese an impor- 
tant place in one's diet. In Jonson's time, cheese was used 
as we use meat now, for the principal dish of the meal, but it 
has come to be used as a relish or side dish. And when Na- 
ture rebels against a hearty meal of proteins with cheese 
added, we say complacently that it was the cheese that caused 
the trouble, and relegate it to the list of indigestibles. 

The Government report has exploded the fallacy, putting 
this nutritious food In its proper place, instead of an addi- 
tion to a menu already heavy with proteins. 

So one need not, like Nebuchadnezzar, subsist on grass 
alone just because meat has been condemned, for there are 
many delicious dishes to take its place. 

A vegetable gelatine has been put on the market, which is 
much more delicate than the old-fashioned animal gelatine 
and has not the objectionable odor. There are also vege- 
table and nut oils to be used instead of animal fat of doubt- 
ful purity, for shortening and frying. Egg, white of egg 
and chicken dishes have been added ^t the end of the book 
to be at hand if they may be added to the menu. 

I am indebted for many of the recipes to my friends and 
to patients of Dr. Bishop who have been kind enough to 
share with us the result of their successful experience. Also 
to Dr. C. F. Langworthy, expert in charge of Nutrition In- 
vestigation of the United States Department of Agricul- 
ture, who has allowed portions of his charts to be used and 
recipes from the bulletins. I am under especial obligation

INTRODUCTION 

No physician who has not tried knows how difficult it is 
to bridge the gap between those of technical education and 
those who have not been so trained. 

The man with technical knowledge teaches and the un- 
trained person seems to understand, but any test will often 
show that no knowledge of particular value has been im- 
parted. 

There are only a dozen writers in the English language 
who excel in expounding real medical knowledge in a popular 
way. All the rest impart only a half-knowledge that retards, 
rather than advances, true medicine. 

So it is better that the practical application of dietetics 
should be taught by one who Is not trammeled by intricacies 
of medicine and who can work backward, as it were, from 
domestic science, to meet the medical demands. 

The demand in this case is to meet, by a very rigid diet, 
the needs of those who are threatened with serious dis- 
orders of the heart and blood vessels. 

Many years of study have brought me back to founding 
the diet of heart sufferers upon the basis of the old adage, 
" What is one man's meat is another man's poison." 

The scientific basis of this truth Is a long story of pro- 
found Interest involving nearly every branch of modern 
research, the action of germs, the chemistry of the proteins, 
and, curiously enough, the principles of vaccination. 

It has been found that, under certain circumstances, the 
cells of the body become sensitive to the protein element of 
certain kinds' of foods, and, from that time on, as long as 
this sensitiveness lasts, that kind of food acts asi a poison 



INTRODUCTION 

to the cells of the body. The only way to limit the damage 
is to exclude the offending article of food from the diet. 

Another important point in the matter is, that when a 
person is sensitive to a particular kind of food, the cells 
are almost as much irritated by a little of this food as by 
a great deal, so that a diet, to be of much use, has to be a 
strict diet. 

Many failures can be laid at the door of slight indulgence 
in the type of food to which the person is sensitive. This 
may happen unconsciously or because of the belief that a 
little will not do any harm. It is hard for an untrained per- 
son to believe that food damage can be entirely independent 
of any discomfort, but such is the case. 

Food poisoning has generally existed for five or ten years 
before the heart is sufficiently damaged to cause distress on 
exertion. 

If the person goes under the care of a competent specialist 
before any discomfort begins, as in those rejected by life 
insurance or accidentally examined, the task of the physician 
is very hard. It is his duty to persuade sudh a person that 
a strict diet is necessary, but the sick person does not feel 
any discomfort from his high blood pressure or leaking 
heart, and so he is in no position to appreciate any of the 
improvement that may result from the adherence to a 
diet. 

On the whole. It Is a fortunate thing if pain and oppres- 
sion in the chest develop early in heart disease, as it gives 
an opportunity for treatment before the disease has ad- 
vanced. 

My own experience Is, that heart disease and hardening 
of the arteries have usually existed about five years at the 
time the sufferer comes under observation. 

This will not always be so because there Is a strong move- 



INTRODUCTION 

ment by the life insurance companies to bring about the 
examination at regular intervals of all persons who are in- 
sured, so as to detect the symptomless disease in time, and 
effect an early cure. 

The things that do damage are usually found in the group 
including eggs, fish, meat and stock soups, but there is no 
definite way of determining which of these things is at fault. 

This has to be accomplished by the study of each indi- 
vidual person, by means of the absolute withdrawal of all 
those things until there is an improvement in the action of 
the heart and blood vessels. Now one article of food, and 
then another is added to the diet, and it Is discovered by 
experiment which one the person can use without a return 
of the disorder. 

In the beginning, it may be only eggs, or fish, or meat, 
that is a source of irritation to the cells of the body. In 
persons very seriously 11^ with hardening of the arteries, all 
of these things are a source of irritation. 

It is comparatively easy for a physician to say, " Don't 
eat any eggs," but It is very hard to conduct cooking on this 
basis, and the cutting out of meat makes a tremendous de- 
ficiency In the fare of most households. Stock soups and 
fish are also missed. 

Mrs. Gillmore, in this book, has undertaken to compile 
the experience of persons who have honestly attempted to 
restore the health and prolong the lives of members of their 
■ family by providing attractive meals, which, at the same 
time, complied with the requirements of persons who had to 
consider their hearts and blood vessels. 

Mrs. Gillmore has contributed to a work that will help 
other women In this problem, and will measurably assist In 
the checking of the advance of a class of diseases that is now 
claiming twice as many victims as it did thirty years ago

BUTTERMILK CORNMEAL MUSH 

White cornmeal cooked in buttermilk makes a dish which

very cold with cream. In making it, allow one part of corn- 
meal to six parts of buttermilk, and one teaspoon, of salt 
to each cup of meal. 

BREAKFAST CEREALS WITH CHEESE 

That cheese combined with cereal foods makes a rational 
dish as regards the proportion of nutrients it supplies has 
been proved by dietitians. Cheese and some of the crisp 
" ready to serve " cereal breakfast foods Is a combination 
which is common, th^ cheese being melted with the cereal 
food, or simply served with it. 

There are many who relish a piece of cheese with the 
cooked cereal so commonly eaten for breakfast, and find 
such a combination satisfying to appetite and taste"; Oat- 
meal or some other home-cooked breakfast cereal prepared 
with cheese is palatable, and such dishes have an advantage 
in that they may be served without cream and sugar. Since 
such a dish contains considerably more projtein than the 
breakfast cereals as ordinarily served, it has a further ad- 
vantage in that it may well serve as the principal item of 
a breakfast menu, instead of a preliminary to other courses. 
Such a combination as cereals cooked with cheese, toast, 
fruit, and chocolate, makes a palatable as well as nutritious 
breakfast.

BREAD, ETC. 

" A loaf of bread," the Walrus said, 
" Is what we chiefly need. 
Pepper and vinegar beside. 
Are very good indeed." 

Lewis Carroll. 

BREAD 

4 pounds and 2 ounces of flour 1^4 pints of water 
54 ounce of yeast 54 ounce of salt 

A bread-mixer should be used in making this bread. Best 
seconds flour is better than superfine flour. The water must 
be warm, but not too hot to bear the hand In. Dissolve the 
yeast in the water; add the salt, and stir all well together. 
Pour the liquid into the bread-mixer. Now add the flour 
which must be sifted. Fasten the top on the mixer, and turn 
the handle for exactly three minutes. Remove the cover, 
and have ready a well-floured pastry-board. Take a large 
knife and remove the dough from the central screw, divide 
it into four equal parts, and place each part in a well- 
greased bread-tin. Let the tins stand in a warm place for 
one hour to rise. The plate rack above an ordinary kitchen 
stove is a good place. Then put them in a very moderately 
heated oven, and after the first twenty minutes increase the 
heat until it is hot, but not so hot as is required for pastry. 
The loaves must bake for an hour. Bread is much better 
baked in tins ; but if tins are not used, the dough must be di- 
vided into four, and formed into round cakes and placed on 
the oven shelves, which must be first floured. Three-quarters 
of an hour to rise, and the same to bake will then be quite

measuring the quantities. 

WHITE BREAD 

In a quart measure, dissolve ond yeast cake, add one 
tablespoon of salt, three tablespoons of sugar, two table- 
spoons melted butter. Fill the measure half milk and half 
water, lukewarm, and pour into bread-mixer. Add three 
quarts of sifted flour, and turn the handle for ten or fifteen 
minutes. Cover and let it rise until double in bulk; when 
properly risen, turn the handle a few times to collect the 
dough on die kneading blade, and remove to the board. 
This makes four loaves. 

MILK BREAD 

Scalded milk ij^, tablespoons butter 

Yi cake compressed yeast J^ tablespoon of salt 

J4 tablespoon sugar ij4 quarts sifted flour 

Put into a pint measure the butter, salt and one-half cup 
of boiling water. Fill it up with scalded milk. When luke- 
warm, stir and pour into bread-mixer, keeping back enough 
of the liquid to thoroughly dissolve the yeast. Add the dis- 
solved yeast to the other liquids in the bread-mixer and lastly, 
the sifted flour, slightly warmed. Knead five minutes in the 
mixer. Set away in a warm place for one and one-half hours 
or until the dough is light. Knead again for five minutes. 
Set away in a warm place for an hour or more until well 
risen. Turn upon a molding board and shape in loaves. 
Place in buttered pans, and put in a warm place until light. 
Bake in a hot oven three-fourths of an hour. Remove from 
the pan and place the loaves in such a position that the air 
will reach all sides. This will form a crisp crust. To ob- 
tain a soft crust, wrap in a cloth.

It was a common, though not general, practice in New 
England to add cooked pumpkin to the other ingredients in 
making such bread as this, very much as sweet potato is used 
in the South. The sweet potato or pumpkin changes the 
flavor of the bread somewhat and apparently facilitates the 
rising of the dou^, improves the texture of the bread, and 
tends to keep it moist. However, if sweet potato or pump- 
kin, either home cooked or canned, can not be conveniently 
obtained, good bread can be made without it.

sufficient merely to pour the boiling water over the meal in 
a cold dish. If yellow meal is used, heat it a litde in addi- 
tion to pouring it into the boiling water, or mix meal and 
water and heat in a double boiler. When cool mix with 
the other ingredients and knead thoroughly. Place in a 
baking dish, and bake when risen su^ciently.

26 MEATLESS COOKERY 

Mix the corn meal and salt and pour over them enough 
boiling water to moisten the mixture but not to make a bat- 
ter. When cool add the molasses and the yeast mixed with 
a little water. Add the rye flour to the corn meal mixture 
gradually, alternating it, if necessary, with lukewarm water 
in order to keep the dough thin enough to be stirred with a 
spoon. Let it rise until light, form into a loaf, and bake in 
a slow oven four or five hours.

PARCHED CORN MEAL BISCUITS 

I cup yellow corn meal 2 cups peanut cream 

2 teaspoons salt 

Put the meal into a shallow pan, and heat in the oven until 
it is a delicate brown, stirring frequently. Make the nut 
cream by mixing peanut butter with cold water and heating. 
It should be the consistency of thick cream. While the nut 
r.ream is hot, stir in the com meal which should be hot. Beat 
thoroughly. The mixture should be of such consistency that 
it can be dropped from a spoon. Bake in small cakes on a 
greased pan. 

If preferred, these biscuits may be made with cream or 
with butter in place of peanut cream, and chopped raisins 
jTiay be added, one cup being the allowance for the quanti- 
ties given above. 

BEATEN CORN BREAD . 

^ cup white com meal J^ teaspoon salt 

^ cup white flour i tablespoon butter 

I teaspoon sugar Water 

Mix and sift the dry ingredients and rub the butter 
thoroughly into the mixture by means of a fork. Add a 
little water, enough to moisten the mixture throughout, but 
not too much, as it must be crumbly. Spread on a board, 
and beat thoroughly with a rolling pin or mallet, as is done 
with beaten biscuits, folding it over frequently to introduce 
air. RoU out about one-half inch thick, cut into small 
pieces, and bake in a moderate oven. In camp this can be 
baked in a hot greased pan propped up before a hot fire. 
When cooked there should be a layer of custard on top of 
the cake or small bits of custard distributed through it. 

A patent beating machine is now on the market which gives 
the same result as a rolling-pin with a greater saving of time 
and muscle. Serve the bread hot with plenty of butter.

FRIED PASTE 

When paste, made according to any of the recipes, has 
been kept two or three days, and it is not required for tarts, 
etc., a very nice dish can be made by rolling it out three- 
quarters of an inch thick, and stamping it into small rounds, 
and frying these in oil. The oil must not be quite so hot as 
for general frying. Test it by throwing in a bit of bread, 
and p«t in the paste as soon as the bread crisps, and before 
the oil is hot enough to brown it, then the paste will be done 
perfectly. 

The rounds of pastry should have sugar sifted over them, 
and be piled on a dish paper. Any stewed fruit may be 
served with them. 

PASTE PUFF FOR TARTS, ETC. 

I pound of flour J4 pound of butter 

I teaspoon of baking powder 

Divide the butter into three portions. Put the flour into 



40 MEATLESS COOKERY 

a bowl, and mix the baking powder thoroughly with it, first, 
however, taking out three tablespoons for working the pastry. 
Rub one portion of the butter into the flour, and mix it with 
as little of the water as will make the paste smooth. Roll 
this out until it is an inch thick, then divide into halves. Put 
one half aside, and roll out the other until it is very thin, less 
than a quarter of an inch in thickness. Break up the second 
portion of the butter into small bits, and lay these over the 
paste, leaving a margin of quite an inch to allow for the 
butter spreading in rolling. Dredge with flour, and fold in 
three, then roll out until the paste is an inch thick. Treat 
the other half in exactly the same manner, using the third 
portion of the butter. When this is done, place the two 
pieces on top of one another, and roll out until half an inch 
thick. Now fold the paste, and place it between two dishes, 
and put it aside in a cool place until next day. 

When rolling out the paste for tarts, take care to keep 
it one way of the grain. If in using the cuttings they are 
placed straight, one on top of the other, the last bit of paste 
will be as light and flaky as the first used. 

PASTE PUFF, OLD RECIPE 
I pound of flour i pound of butter 

A teaspoon of baking powder 

Take three ounces of flour from the pound, to use for 
working up the paste, and put the remainder in a bowl, mixing 
it well with the baking-powder. Divide the butter into four 
portions, and rub one into the flour ; then mix with as much 
water as will make a perfectly smooth paste. Now roll out 
the paste to the thickness of a shilling, and break up the butter 
into bits the size of a hazel-nut, placing them over the paste. 
Dredge lightly with some of the flour taken out for working. 
Be careful to leave a margin of an inch to allow for the butter 
spreading in rolling. Fold the paste into four, and roll out 



BREAD, ETC. 41 

again to the thickness of a shilling. Repeat these directions 
exactly, in working in the third and fourth parts of the butter. 
When all the butter has been used fold the paste into three, 
and once again lengthwise. Lay it in a deep dish, and cover 
closely, letting it stand in a cool place for at least twelve 
hours. This paste will keep two or three days without bak- 
ing unless the weather is very hot. - Be very careful in mak- 
ing up the paste into tartlets, tarts, etc., to keep it the way of 
the grain in rolling out or as flakes lie. The cuttings if 
placed flat, one on top of the other, and rolled out, will then 
be just as light and flaky as when rolled out at first. Some 
cooks spoil quite a quarter of the paste in making tartlets, 
etc., by not observing this rule, for if the cuttings are gath- 
ered up carelessly in the hand, and made into a ball, and then 
rolled out, all the work of the cook is spoiled, for paste 
treated so wiU be very little better than ordinary short-paste. 

PASTE FOR BOILED PUDDINGS 

I pound of flour i heaping teaspoon of baking 

6 ounces of butter powder 

Water 

Take out two large tablespoons of the flour to work up the 
paste, and mix the rest with the baking-powder. When 
these have been well-mixed, rub in the butter, and stir in as 
much water as will make a rather stiff paste. Flour a pastry- 
board, and roll out the paste to half an inch in thickness. 
Fold the pastry in three, and roll out again, when it will be 
ready for use. Keep the board and rolling-pin well floured 
with the flour that was taken from the pound at first. This 
pastry can be used equally well for either fruit or vegetable 
pies. If the paste is to be kept several days before using 
it should be wrapped in a napkin and put in a cool place so 
no crust will be formed. In making paste everything should 
be cold and the dough handled as little as possible.

I tablespoon of salad oil 

Mix the oil and flour together, and make into a smooth 
batter with the water. 

BATTER FOR FRYING SAVORIES 

]/2 pint of milk 2 ounces of flour 

J^ teaspoon of baking powder 

Mix the milk and flour very smoothly together, adding 
the milk a little at a time until it is all used; stir in the 
salt. The batter must always be mixed at least three hours 
before it is required or it will not be light. Add the baking 
powder just before the batter is used, and be careful to mix 
it very thoroughly. 

BATTER FOR FRYING SWEETS 

4 ounces of flour ^. ounce of sugar 

I ounce of butter i gill of water 

Mix the flour with a quarter of a pint of cold water to

in the flour and the water. Add the sugar last. It is then 
ready for use. 

ROUX BROWN AND WHITE FOR THICKENING 

I pound 2 ounces of flour i pound of butter 

See that the flour is thoroughly dry, and then sift it. 
Squeeze the butter In a cloth to remove all moisture. Now 
put the butter in an enameled stewpan, and let it stand on 
the stove until it runs to oil. It is necessary to heat the 
oiled butter so that the scum will rise, but care must be 
taken that it does not get too hot. When all the scum has 
been removed, the stewpan should be put in a cooler part of 
the stove, so that the sediment may settle. Skim off the 



BREAD, ETC. 43 

froth very carefully, and pour the oil In a basin, leaving the 
sediment at the bottom of the stewpan. Remove the sedi- 
ment from the stewpan, and pour back, the oil — now clari- 
fied butter — and sprinkle in the flour gradually, stirring 
all the time. Put the stewpan on a slow fire, turned low, 
and stir continually with a wooden spoon. Keep scraping 
the bottom of the pan to prevent mixture burning; be very 
careful about the scraping or the stirring, or the roux will 
be spoiled. As soon as the mixture begins to color a very 
little, put half of It into a jar for white roux. It must not 
turn more than a cream color, as it is intended to thicken 
white soups and white sauces. Now return the saucepan to 
the fire, and continue the stirring and scraping until the re- 
maining roux has become a bright brown. Be careful that 
it does not get too dark; a light chocolate color is the cor- 
rect shade. Immediately the roux is dark enough, remove 
It from the stove at once, but continue stirring for some min- 
utes, as enameled stewpans retain the heat after they have 
been removed from the fire, and the mixture would burn 
if the stirring was discontinued at once. Have ready a large 
slice of onion, and throw it into the roux, if there is any fear 
that It is getting too dark ; this checks the heat at once. This 
Is brown roux for thickening brown soups and gravies. It 
will keep for weeks, and although the process seems rather 
troublesome, it really in the end saves time. 

In using the roux it is best to scrape off the quantity you 
require with a spoon, and not add it to the soups and sauces 
In a lump.

MEAT SUBSTITUTES ' 83 

The above is a very satisfactory substitute for macaroni 
and cheese, and can be prepared in less time. 

BAKED CRACKERS AND CHEESE NO. 2 

9 or 10 butter crackers or soda i cup grated cheese 
crackers 34 teaspoon salt 

2 cups hot milk, whole or 
skimmed 

This is more quickly prepared than the preceding recipe, 
but as the milk is likely to curdle, it has not so good a con- 
sistency. 

Soak the crackers in the milk; place them in a buttered 
baking dish in alternate layers with the cheese; pour over 
them the remaining milk, and bake. This dish may be 
covered with buttered crumbs. Variety may be secured, in 
either this recipe or the preceding one, by putting a very 
small amount of mixed mustard on each cracker. 

CHEESE ROLLS 

A large variety of rolls may be made by combining leg- 
umes, either beans of various kinds, cowpeas, lentils or peas, 
with cheese of various kinds, and adding bread crumbs to 
make the mixture thick enough to form into a roll. Beans 
are usually mashed, but peas or small lima beans may be 
combined whole with bread crumbs and grated cheese, and 
enough of the liquor in which the vegetables have been 
cooked may be added to get the right consistency. Or, in- 
stead of beans and peas, chopped spinach, beet tops or head 
lettuce may be used. Homemade cottage cheese and the 
soft cream cheese of commerce, standard cheese, or English 
dairy may be used. Variety may be obtained also by vary- 
ing the flavoring. Among the best are onion, chives and 
sweet pepper. These should be cooked before mixing with 
the roll. Other flavors are mustard, curry, chopped olives, 
onion juice and nutmeg.

tuted beet tops, Swiss chard, or the outer leaves of lettuce. 

CHEESE WITH MUSH 

Cheese may be added to cornmeal or to mush made from 
any of the corn or wheat preparations now on the market. 
The addition of cheese to cornmeal mush is particularly de-

Scald the milk with the potassium bicarbonate; add the 
grated cheese, and stir until it dissolves. Dip the bread in 
this mixture, and fry it in the butter. The potassium bi- 
carbonate helps to keep the cheese in solution. It is desir- 
able, however, to keep the milk hot while the bread is being 
dipped. 

FRIED BREAD WITH CHEESE NO. 2 

Cut stale bread into thin pieces. Put two pieces together 
with grated cheese between them. Dip into milk, and fry

An advantage of omitting butter from cheese dishes and 
of substituting water or skimmed milk for whole milk is 
that it makes it possible to increase the amount of cheese 



88 MEATLESS COOKERY

those who like the flavor of cheese, and, also, because it 
tends to increase the tissue-forming value of the dish, partic-

Break the macaroni into one-inch lengths, and throw it 
into plenty of boiling water. Scald the onion, and stick a 
few cloves into it, add to the macaroni, and boil quickly 
until the macaroni is cooked but not broken. Pour off the 
water, and drain well. Have ready a batter made of milk 
and flour, made by putting the flour into a basin and adding 
the milk slowly, stirring all the time, till half of it is used; 
then beat the batter well till bubbles form on top. Add the 
rest of the milk, and let it stand tiU the macaroni is cooked ; 
this makes the batter lighter. Cut the tomatoes in halves, 
and put them on a buttered baking tin in a moderate oven, 
with the rest of the ounce of butter in small bits on the top of 
them. Bake till just tender, but not broken. Make the 



MEAT SUBSTITUTES 103 

salad oil very hot in the saucepan. When the macaroni 
is drained from the water, throw four or five bits of it into 
the hot oil. If it browns quickly, put in the other bits, and 
fry a light brown. Lift out of the oil, drain on white paper, 
reheat the oil, and continue to dip in batter, and fry in oil 
all the rest of the macaroni. Put the tomatoes in a ring, 
round a deep fire-proof dish. Heap the fried macaroni In 
the center. Put a border of the grated cheese round the 
outside edge of the ring of tomatoes. Make very hot in the 
oven. Serve at once in the dish in which it was baked.

half an hour. Now drain it, and add the milk to it, and a 
little pepper, bring it to the boiling point quickly, and then 
let it simmer gently for another half hour. The macaroni 
should be perfectly tender, but unbroken, and the cheese and 
butter may now be added, stirring the contents of the sauce-

pan constandy — one way — until the whole of the cheese is 
melted and tlioroughly mixed with the macaroni. Turn it 
out on a dish, and serve hot as possible. Another way of 
serving the macaroni makes a prettier dish: Instead of 
adding the cheese and butter to the macaroni In the sauce- 
pan, a layer of the macaroni may be put on the bottom of 
a well-buttered French baking dish, and part of the cheese 
scattered over it; then the rest of tiie macaroni must be put 
over the cheese, and the remainder of the cheese used as 
before. The top should be covered with fine bread crumbs, 
and the butter taken and broken up in bits, and placed over 
the top. This dish should now be placed in a hot oven, and 
quickly browned. 

It is necessary to stir the macaroni occasionally when boil- 
ing quickly in the water, and after the milk has been added, 
it must be stirred frequently, or it will stick to the pan and 
spoil. 

MACARONI AND CHEESE PUDDING 

4 ounces macaroni i pound Spanish onions 

3 ounces grated cheese i ounce white bread cnunbs 

4 sage leaves Pepper and salt to taste 

Break the macaroni into three and a half inch lengths, 
and put into boiling water, boiling for half an hour; then 
drain, and when cool, line a well-buttered pudding basin 
with the macaroni, and fill in with the following mixture: 
Scald the onion, and chop very finely with the sage leaves, 
add the cheese and bread crumbs, and mix well. Fill the 
basin with this, and cover with macaroni, then a cloth, and 
steam for three hours. Rice may take the place of macaroni 
for a change. 

If rice is used cook as for plain boiled rice in salted water 
and put In the baking dish In the same way as the maca- 
roni.

MACARONI SAVORY 

4 ounces macaroni J^ pound tomatoes 

4 ounces Parmesan cheese 2 ounces butter 

Y2 pint of milk 3 ounces bread crumbs 

y^ pound onions Pepper and salt 

Break the macaroni into two-Inch lengths, and throw It 
into plenty of fast-bolling water, and let It boll quickly, stir- 
ring occasionally, for half an hour, and then drain the water 
from It. Now add the milk with pepper and salt, and let It 
boil up quickly, and then simmer for another half hour, when 
the macaroni should be quite tender. Stir frequently to 
prevent It sticking to the pan. 

The onions in the meantime should have been peeled, 
sliced and boiled until tender In plenty of water. They 
must then be drained and slightly chopped. The tomatoes 
also must be thrown Into boiling water for a few seconds, 
and when removed the skins will come off quite easily; they 
must now be sliced. 

Butter a good-sized French baking dish, and scatter In 
some bread crumbs; shake out all that do not stick to the 
butter. Place a layer of macaroni at the bottom of the 
dish, and scatter over it a third part of the Parmesan. Over 
that place the chopped onions and then the sliced tomatoes, 
and then the remainder of the macaroni. Cover this with 
half the remaining Parmesan, and over that scatter the rest 
of the bread crumbs. Now scatter the last of the Parme- 
san, and over that the butter, broken up Into small pieces, 
and place over top. Bake for about twenty minutes In a hot 
oven ; it should be a rich brown all over. This is an excel- 
lent dish, and well repays the cook's trouble. If attention Is 
paid to all the details. If Genoa macaroni is used it re- 
quires a longer time to prepare than Naples. Twenty min- 
utes in the water Is long enough for Naples. Macaroni 
should always be served hot as it becomes pasty when cold.

IRISH STEW NO. 4 

Cut any cooked vegetables desired into dice, mix well and 
season with pepper, salt, minced onion, chives, parsley, cher- 
vil, or green pepper finely minced. The hash must be 
moistened with milk or water, half a cupful for a quart of 
hash. Melt a tablespoon of butter in a frying pan, put In 
the hash and spread lightly in the pan. Over this put dots 
of butter, using about a tablespoon. Cover the pan and 
place where the hash will not burn and cook half an hour, 
then fold and turn on a hot platter. A rich brown crust 
will have formed on the bottom of the hash if the heat was 
sufficient. Serve very hot.

POLENTA ' 

This dish, which is common in Italy, differs little, except 
in name, from hasty pudding, though it is served in very 
different ways. Sometimes cheese is added during the cook- 
ing. Polenta is often reheated with tomato sauce. The 
dish is improved by sprinkling each layer of polenta with 
cheese. When the polenta is to be reheated, it is well to 
cut it into small pieces in order that the sauce may be well 
distributed through the dish. 

SAUCE FOR POLENTA 

2 tablespoons of butter i cup thick strained tomato juice 

2 tablespoons of flour Salt and pepper 

Melt the butter, and cook the flour thoroughly in it; add 
the tomato juice and seasonings, and cook until smooth, stir-

FRIED CORN MEAL MUSH 

Packing hasty pudding in granite pans, cutting it into 
slices and frying it makes a good dish. In Italy, polenta is 
spread out in thin layers on a board, and cut in small blocks. 
These blocks are crumbed and fried in deep oil or butter. 
Another method is to mix corn meal in three times its value*^ 
of water, and cook it in water only long enough to form a 
mush, and complete the cooking by frying the meal in butter. 
This is not so stiff as ordinary fried corn meal mush. 

CORN MEAL MUSH WITH FRUIT 

Corn meal mush is often served with dried fruits, par- 
ticularly with figs and dates. In preparing such fruit for 
use with the mush, it is usually necessary to soften it. This 
can easily be accomplished by washing the fruit and then 
heating it in a slow oven. As a result of the heat the water 
remaining on the fruit is absorbed and the fruit softened 
and also dried on the surface. 

CORN MEAL MUSH WITH CHEESE 

For this dish yellow corn meal is usually used. For a 
mush made with one cup of yellow corn meal the usual allow- 
ance is one-half cup, or two ounces, of grated cheese. There 
is, however, no limit to the amount of cheese which can be 
added, and the addition of cheese tends not only to make a 
highly nitrogenous and nourishing dish, but also to make a 
dish which can be eaten without the addition of butter and 
cream. Like the ordinary corn meal mush, it is often 
fried either in deep fat, after having been crumbed, or in a 
small amount of fat. 

CORN MEAL DUMPLINGS 

2 cups com meal Boiling water 

I teaspoon salt Flour for dredging 

Mix the meal and salt; pour boiling water over the meal

and stir thoroughly, using water enough to make a stiff 
paste. Form portions of paste into flat dumplings about 
three inches in diameter. Have ready a kettle of boiling 
water and drop the dumplings in carefully, cover, and cook 
twenty minutes. These dumplings are often cooked with 
turnip tops or other greens. Some cooks dredge the dump- 
lings with flour before boiling them. 

CORN MEAL CUTLETS 

Turn corn meal mush into bread tins previously wet with 
cold water; when cold, slice. Dip the sliced mush into 
bread crumbs. Place in a buttered pan, and bake in a quick 
oven until a rich brown. Serve with butter or maple syrup. 

BREAD CUTLETS 

Cut some neat slices of brown or white bread half an inch 
thick. Remove crust, and cut into large fingers ; soak them 
In a mixture composed of milk, a little flour and sweet herbs 
and seasoning, and fry crisp, either in butter or oil. 

MUSHROOMS IN CREAM 

Peel and trim one pound of mushrooms and put them in a 
saucepan with one tablespoon of butter and cook a few min- 
utes. Add one tablespoon of cream, and cook until the 
mushrooms are tender. Season with salt, pepper, and serve 
on toast. 

BROILED MUSHROOMS 

Peel the mushrooms, remove the stems, and place the caps 
on a buttered broiler. Broil five minutes, until the mush- 
rooms are brown and tender. Place on a hot dish with a 
piece of butter in each cap and a drop of lemon juice. Dust 
with salt and pepper and serve very hot. They may also be 
served on hot buttered toast.

BOILED ASPARAGUS 

Unrie the bunch of asparagus, cut off the tough portion 
of the stalk, remove the scales, and wash very thoroughly. 
When thoroughly cleansed, retie with a white tape wide 
enough not to cut the asparagus. Stand in a kettle of boil- 
ing, salted water, and cook uncovered for ten minutes, al- 
lowing the tips to remain out of the water. Then lay the 
bunch down so that it is wholly covered with water, and cook 
another five minutes. Remove from the water, and serve 
with a dressing of melted butter. If desired, the asparagus 
may be served on toast. Thd asparagus may be cut in small 
pieces and cooked if preferred. 

ASPARAGUS IN CREAM 

Untie the asparagus, wash, remove the scales, and cut into 
half-inch pieces. Cook in sufficient boiling water — salted 
— to almost cover for ten to twelve minutes. Drain off 
the liquid, and pour over the asparagus some hot milk and 
cream in the proportion of one-third cream and two-thirds 
milk; also add butter for seasoning. One quart of aspar- 
agus will require one-third cup cream, two-thirds cup milk, 
two tablespoons butter and one-half teaspoon salt ; or a white 
sauce may be used.

If somewhat wilted, throw into cold water for a half hour 
or so. Remove the scales, and wash thoroughly by dashing 
up and down in several waters to make sure that all sand is 
removed. Cut into half-inch lengths, and cook in enough 
boiling, salted water to cover well. When both are tender, 
mix the vegetables and add the butter and cream for season- 
ing. They are also delicious without the cream.

one ounce of butter, and season them with pepper. Butter 
either a French baking dish or sufficient china scallop shells 
to hold the mixture, room being left in each shell for the 
Parmesan and bread crumbs. If a dish has been used, 
spread the Parmesan evenly over the artichoke puree, and 
then the bread crumbs in the same way. Break up the re- 
maining ounce of butter, and scatter over the dish. If the 
scallop shells are used, the Parmesan, bread crumbs and 
butter must be divided according to the number of scallops. 
They should be browned nicely in a quick oven.

BOILED CABBAGE 

Cut a small head of cabbage into four parts, cutting down 
through the stock. Soak for half an hour in a pan of cold 
water to which has been added a tablespoon of salt; this is 
to draw out any insects that may be hidden in the leaves. 
Take from the water, and cut into slices. Have a large 
saucepan half full of boiling water, and put in the cabbage, 
pushing it under the water with a spoon. Add one table- 
spoon of salt and one-quarter teaspoon of baking soda. 
Cook from twenty-five to forty-five minutes, depending upon 
the age of the cabbage.' Turn into a colander, and drain

Season with butter and pepper, and more salt if needed. 
Allow a tablespoon of butter to a pint of cooked cabbage. 
Have the kitchen windows open at the top while the cabbage 
is boiling, and there will be little If any odor of cabbage in 
the house. Over-cooking turns cabbage yellow, gives it a 
strong flavor, and is the cause of digestive disturbance. 

CABBAGE AU GRATIN 

Boil the cabbage, put it In a colander and press out all the

BOILED SPINACH 

Pick over the spinach, carefully removing all wilted leaves. 
Cut off the roots and the coarse fiber of the leaves which 
require longer cooking than the remainder of the leaves, toss 
into cold water, and wash thoroughly through several waters, 
taking care to agitate it considerably each time in order to 
free it from sand. Put to cook in boiling water, and let boil 
five minutes. Drain, salt, and allow it to finish cooking in 
the liquid which remains on the leaves. Cook until tender, 
which will require about twenty-five minutes. Drain off the 
excess moisture, if any, and chop very fine. Add butter — 
one tablespoon to a pint of the cooked spinach. Serve with

together with twine, and lift the marrow carefully into an 
oval baking dish. Pour the gravy over the marrow, and 
cover it closely with another dish over it. Baste occasion- 
ally, and bake for an hour in a hot oven. If it is baked with 
a French baking dish with cover, it can be sent to table in 
dish it is baked in. If an ordinary dish is used, it would 
still be better to serve in the dish in which it was baked, as 
the marrow might be difficult to remove, but a napkin must 
be fastened around the dish when served. 

STUFFED VEGETABLE MARROW NO. 2 

Peel the marrow, cut it in half lengthwise and remove the 
seeds. Fill the space with half a cup of chopped mushrooms, 
minced onions, some sage and lemon rind, one tablespoon of

gators that this cream Is suitable for eating on bread in place 
of butter, 

DEVONSHIRE CREAM 

Devonshire cream somewhat resembles sweet cream In 
flavor and consistency. It is very much liked In England, 
where it Is commonly eaten with fresh or preserved fruit, 
but Is not so well known In America. 

To make Devonshire cream, allow a pan of whole milk 
to stand for twenty-four hours In a cool place or for twelve 
hours In a warmer place. Place the pan on the cooler part 
of the stove, and heat until the milk Is very hot, but not to 
the boiling point. If heated too much, a thick skin will 
form on the surface. The more slowly the milk Is heated, 
the better. Having been heated, the milk should be kept 
In a cool place for twenty-four hours, and then skimmed. 
The thick cream obtained has a characteristic flavor and 
texture.

tuce or may be cut into slices and served on lettuce. 

Cheese balls are often served with salad. They are made 
of some soft cream dieese and are frequently combined with 
chopped chives, olives, sweet peppers, chopped nuts, etc., for 
the sake of adding flavor. Spinach extract, etc., is some- 
times mixed in for the sake of color. If the balls are rolled 
in chopped chives or parsley, both flavor and color are sup- 
plied.

CHEESE SALAD AND PRESERVES 

Epicures have devised a dish which consists of lettuce with 
French dressing served with cream cheese and thick prepara- 
tions of currants or other fruits preserved in honey or sugar, 
which, owing to the fact that the seeds have been e-^tracted 
by a laborious process, are fairly expensive. The soft 
cheese often found in market is also relatively expensive. 
There is a suggestion in this dish, however, for others which 
are much less costly. Buttermilk cream or ordinary cottage 
cheese served with lettuce or other green salad and a small 
amount of rich homemade preserves, is a combination with 
much the same character, and also very appetizing. 

CHEESE AND OLIVE SALAD

done, leaving the celery with very little liquid. Prepare a 
thin white sauce of the remaining ingredients, and pour over 
the celery. Prepare the toast by trimming the crust from 
thin slices of bread. Cut diagonally, making triangular- 
shaped pieces of toast. Toast in a moderate oven until 
crisp. Dip slices of crisp toast into some hot milk or cream. 
Serve with a spoonful of the creamed celery upon each slice. 

CREAMED SPINACH ON TOAST 

I pint cooked or canned spinach i cup white sauce 
Toast /4 teaspoon salt 

Drain the liquid from the spinach, and chop. Prepare 
the white sauce, and' add the spinach to it. Add salt, and 
reheat. Trim the crusts from the bread. Cut into trian- 
gular shaped pieces, and toast in a slow oven until crisp and 
nicely browned. Moisten it in a little hot milk or cream, 
and serve a spoonful of the creamed spinach upon each slice. 

ONIONS ON TOAST 

I dozen small Spanish onions i pint of white sauce or cream 

6 slices of toast sauce 

Remove the skins of the onions under cold water; cook in 



2i6 MEATLESS COOKERY 

boiling, salted water five minutes; pour off the cold water, 
drain, cover again with boiling, salted water. Cook one 
hour or until tender throughout, but not so soft that the 
shape is lost. Drain and serve two or three onions upon 
each slice of moistened toast. Prepare the sauce, and serve 
one or two spoonfuls of it upon each serving. 

CREAMED OKRA ON TOAST 

To cook the okra pods put them in boiling water, using 
one teaspoon of salt to a quart of water ; add one tablespoon 
of lemon juice to the water also. Cook about one-half hour 
or until the okra is tender. Drain the water from the okra, 
reserving one cup of it for the sauce. Prepare the sauce as 
follows : 

I cup water from the okra %. cup milk 

^. cup cream J4 cup strained tomatoes 

I teaspoon salt 2 tablespoons flour 

2 tablespoons butter 

Heat the okra water, the cream and milk in a double 
boiler. Rub the flour and butter together, and pour over it 
a little of the heated liquid, stirring meanwhile. When 
mixed thin enough to pour, turn this back into the remainder 
of the hot liquid. Set in a double boiler, and stir until 
thickened. Add the salt and strained tomato just before 
serving. Place three or four of the okra pods on a nicely 
toasted slice of bread for each serving, and over this pour 
a spoonful or more of the prepared sauce. 

APSLEY RUSKS 

This form of toasted bread is much more easily digested 
than toast, as it is more completely cooked. The bread used 
in making the rusks must be at least three or four days old ; 
new bread is difficult to cut into thin slices. The oven must 
be moderate, and the time taken in cooking will vary with 



TOASTS 217 

its heat, averaging from twenty minutes to half an hour. 
Cut the bread thin, and place on the oven shelf or on a slide 
that fits on to the oven shelf, and can be taken in and out 
easily. The rusks must be carefully watched and turned, 
as they become brown on one side, and should be made fresh 
each day. 

CROUTONS 

Cut some slices of stale bread about half an inch thick. 
If the croutons are required for soup they should be cut into 
dice, but if for garnishing they may be stamped into any 
shape, or cut into three-cornered pieces. Fry them in hot 
salad' oil, and drain them on an inverted sieve. 

BREAD-RASPINGS 
All pieces of bread should be put aside in a clean bowl, 
and when enough has been saved to fill a good-sized baking- 
tin, they should be baked in a slow oven until they are a 
rich golden color all through. They should then be rolled 
on a pastry-board — a small quantity at a time — until they 
are fine enough for use, and then put into a biscuit-box with 
a well-fitting lid, which should be kept in a dry place. These 
raspings are used in many recipes, and a good supply should 
always be kept on hand. They are not only better and more 
easily digested than ordinary bread-crumbs, but they are 
much more economical, and are the means of every scrap 
of bread being utilized. As the rolling would scratch and 
dent the board and rolling-pin used for pastry, — and it is 
necessary to keep them perfectly smooth — a special rolling- 
pin and board should be kept for this purpose.

UNCOOKED CURD, OR FRENCH COTTAGE CHEESE 
The French make cheese from sour milk without heating 
it. They pour the milk into earthen molds which have holes 
in the bottom. A very fine sieve may be used instead of the 
molds. The whey drips out, and the curd assumes a cus- 
tard-like consistency, and takes the shape of a mold. When 
sufficiently stiff, the cheese is chilled, and is eaten with sweet 
cream and sugar. It is a staple dessert in many French fam- 
ilies, especially in hot weather, and is delicious served with 
acid fruit, such as currants, or with strawberries. 

BUTTERMILK CHEESE 

To make the buttermilk cheese, heat buttermilk gradually 
to about 130 or 140 degrees F. Allow it to cool, and strain 
it. As the curd will settle to the bottom, most of the whey 
may be poured off before the draining is begun. 

This cheese is, of course, almost wholly without fat, and 
yet, probably because the particles of curd are very finely 
divided, it has a smooth consistency, which suggests the pres- 
ence of fat. It may be served seasoned with salt only, or 
it may be mixed with butter or cream and seasonings. It is 
suitable for combining with olives and pimientos, or for any 
use to which the ordinary cream cheeses are put. 

CHEESE WAFERS 
Butter thin crackers, and sprinkle thickly with grated 
cheese. Put In the oven, and bake until the cheese Is melted 

218 



MISCELLANEOUS 219 

and the crackers are a delicate brown. Serve with salad 
or soup. 

CHEESE RELISH 

Spread bread which has been toasted or fried In deep oil 
with grated cheese, or with grated cheese mixed with a little 
mustard; then heat in the oven until the cheese is melted. 
This may be served with salad, or as a relish to give flavor 
to some dish such as boiled rice or hominy, which has no very 
marked flavor. 

CREAMED CHEESE ON WAFERS 

Mix Yogurt or Neufchatel cheese with just enough cream 
to form a heavy paste. Mix until smooth ; form in rosettes 
by forcing through a pastry tube. Pipe the rosette in the 
center of a wafer or thin cracker, and put a bit of colored 
jelly on two opposite corners, or if preferred, a small rosette 
may be piped on each corner and a bit of bright colored jelly 
placed in the center. 

BUTTER BALLS 

Cut the butter in small pieces the size of the balls desired, 
and put them in ice-water. Soak the butter paddles in boil- 
ing water ten minutes ; then chill in ice water. Hold a pad- 
dle in the left hand, put on it a piece of butter and roll with 
the right paddle until round. If butter sticks, it must be 
chilled longer, or the paddles may be rubbed with salt and re- 
heated. 

SALTED ALMONDS 

I pint water i cup almonds 

yi cup salt 2 teaspoons butter or oil 

Blanch the almonds. Heat the salt and water, and when 
boiling add the nuts. Cook eight minutes. Drain, place 
them in a baking pan, and put the butter or oil over them 
with a brush. Bake until a delicate brown. Stir frequently.

Cook the tomatoes, celery and onions covered until very 
tender and quite thick. When almost done, add the salt. 
Add the lemon juice at the very last. 

SAVORY BEET 

I slice onion % beet or i small one 

Yt. teaspoon salt J^ teaspoon dry mustard 

Yi teaspoon Harvey's sauce 3 tablespoons cream 

3 tablespoons milk 
Fry a slice of onion in butter; then mix together half a 
teaspoon of salt, one-half teaspoon dry mustard, one-half 
teaspoon Harvey's sauce, one teaspoon flour, three table- 
spoons cream and the same of milk, pour it over the onion in 
the saucepan, and boil five minutes; lastly, slice in a (mod- 
erate sized boiled beet. This is to be eaten cold. 

CHILI SAUCE 

I pint condensed tomato i teaspoon cinnamon 

Yi cup lemon juice J4 teaspoon cloves 

4 tablespoons brown sugar 4 tablespoons grated onion 

Cook the condensed tomato slowly one-half hour. Add 
the grated onion, sugar, cloves, cinnamon, and cook one- 
half hour longer. Then add the lemon juice. 

Canned tomatoes may be used instead of condensed to- 
matoes, in which case it will be necessary to use three pints. 
Cook them until reduced to one pint. Rub them through a 
colander, and proceed the same as above directed. 

POLISH SALAD 

Soak six salt pickles in water about six hours. Then 
drain. Chop two sour apples, one large onion, with the 



MISCELLANEOUS 221 

pickles, and mix all thoroughly in a bowl, and sprinkle over 
them a scant half teaspoon of white pepper, a heaping table- 
spoon sugar and a pinch of salt if necessary. Pour enough 
white wine vinegar over all to just cover. 

PICCALILLI 

Take one-half peck green tomatoes, two cabbages, nine 
onions, twelve cucumbers, six green peppers and one-quarter 
pound mustard seed. Chop all very fine. Make a strong 
brine of salt water, and boil the chopped piccalilli in it for 
about five minutes. Remove from the fire, and press out- 
every drop of the brine ; then mix in the mustard seed, and 
put all in a stone crock. Boil a gallon of pickling vinegar, 
and pour over hot. It may be used as soon as cold. 

TO MAKE FRESH CURD 

Take one pint of milk and one dessertspoon of essence of 
rennet. 

Warm the milk to blood heat on the fire, remove, and then 
add the rennet; let it stand aside until set, about an hour. 
Place the curd on a hair sieve, and put a plate on top of it, 
applying gentle pressure for about a minute, and then place 
a five pound weight on the plate and leave it to drip for about 
a quarter of an hour. Remove the weight and plate, scrap- 
ing up the curd into a heap, and repeat the pressing process, 
in all about three or four times to the hour. At the end of 
the hour an eleven pound weight may be put on and left on 
for another hour, at the end of which time the curd will be 
free from whey and of the consistency of tender fish. Fresh 
country milk will take a much less shorter time to set, say 
ten minutes, and require less rennet. Another way of get- 
ting the whey out of the curd is to hang it up in a cheesecloth 
to drain. This will take several hours, but the result is 
satisfactory. Curd may be flavored with vanilla, ginger, 
nutmeg, etc., added to the milk before warming.

VEGETABLE GELATINE 

An endless host, 

Of syllabubs and jellies and mince-pies, 

And other such lady-like luxuries. ■ 

Shelley. 

GENERAL DIRECTIONS FOR THE USE OF 
VEGETABLE GELATINE 

Soak the vegetable gelatine in warm water for twenty 
to thirty minutes. Remove from this water, and cook in 
boiling water — three cups to the box — keeping covered 
while cooking. Let it boil eight to ten minutes, or until it is 
perfectly clear. Strain through a wire sieve, or strainer. 

A box of the gelatine will solidify eleven cups, or nearly 
three quarts of liquid, inclusive of the water in which the 
gelatine is cooked. 

When a firm jelly which can be turned out of a mold is 
desired, use two cups of liquid to one cup of cooked vegetable 
gelatine — one-third box cooked in one cup of boiling water. 

A more delicate jelly, which may be served in the dish in 
which it is cooled, is made by using two and one-half to two 
and three-quarters cups of liquid to one cup of cooked veg- 
etable gelatine. 

Vegetable gelatine hardens in a few minutes at ordinary 
room temperature. 

Do not move jelly from molds until ready to serve.

juice. Prepare the vegetable gelatine by soaking in warm 
water twenty minutes or more. Drain, and cook in the boil- 
ing water five to ten minutes. Strain, and add to the juices. 
Turn into molds wet with cold water. When firm, unmold, 
and serve upon a lettuce leaf with a salad dressing.

BAKED APPLES 

6 medium-sized apples i cup water 

I lemon ^4 cup sugar 

Wipe, core, and pare the apples. Put In baking dish 
with a slice of lemon on top of each. Make a syrup of 
the sugar and water. Pour around the apples, cover, and 
bake slowly until soft. Serve cold with cream or with one 
teaspoon jelly in the center of each apple. If desired, the 
apples may also be flavored with cloves by placing four 
cloves in the side of each apple at an even distance apart. 

Sweet apples are always tough when cooked. The acid 
of the lemon helps to soften the cellulose of the apple. The 
skins of the apple break when baking because the steam of 
the apple must escape, therefore it forces an opening in the 
thinnest part of the skin. A line cut around the center of 
the apple will prevent its breaking. Basting apples while 
cooking makes the skin tender. 

Steamed apples are served for baking apples in many of 
the best hotels and restaurants, as they retain their color 
and flavor much better than when baked. 

MAPLE APPLE 

I cup maple syrup i cup water 

4 medium-sized apples 

Pare and core the apples. Heat the water and syrup to 
the boiling point. Drop the apples into the heated liquid, 
turning often in order to insure cooking uniformly. Re- 
move the apples when tender. Allow the liquid to cook 
down to a syrupy consistency, and pour over the apples. 

HONEY APPLES 

6 medium-sized apples 6 teaspoons butter 

6 tablespoons honey i cup hot water 

Pare, and core the apples; place In a dripping pan, and 



272 MEATLESS COOKERY 

fill the center of each apple with one tablespoon of honey 
and one teaspoon of butter; add the cup of hot water; cover 
the pan, and set in a rather quick oven. When the boiling 
point is reached, reduce the heat, so that the apples will 
cook gently. Turn the apples occasionally; a few minutes 
before the baking is finished remove the cover, and let the 
apples brown slightly. Serve with whipped cream, 

APPLE FRITTERS 
Apples Batter 

Peel, and core the apples, and cut them into thin slices; 
dip them in the batter, and fry in boiling oil. The fritters 
will be much improved if the slices of apples are boiled 
for one minute in sugar and water, and drained before dip- 
ping them in the batter, 

APPLE TART 

Apples Cloves 

Paste Sugar 

Peel, and slice some apples, and fill a tart dish of the

water, or two if the tart is large. Put in one or two cloves 
if the flavor is liked. Line the edges of the dish with paste 
one-third of an inch thick, put on a cover, and bake in a 
quick oven. When the crust is cooked, raise it carefully 
with a knife to see whether the apples are soft, and if not 
let the tart remain on the stove until the apples are suffi- 
ciently cooked. 

NORMANDY PIPPINS STEWED 

J4 pound Normandy pippins 6 ounces sugar 

I quart water 

Wash the pippins well, and soak them over night in one 
quart of water. Remove the apples from the water with a 
spoon, so as to let all impurities sink to the bottom of the 



FRUIT DESSERTS 273 

bowl. Now pour off the water that the pippins have been 
soaked in, and strain it over them, leaving the sediment. 
Add the sugar, and let them boil up quickly, when they must 
be well skimmed. Now put them where they will simmer 
slowly, until they are quite tender but unbroken and they 
have turned a rich brown. This will take between three and 
four hours. If Normandy pippins are cooked quickly they 
are quite spoiled. 

APPLES WITH ROLLED OATS 

6 large applet i quart water 

iJ4 cups sugar i cup cooked rolled oats 

Cook the rolled oats. Pare the apples, and cook in a 
syrup of the water and sugar. Turn frequently. When 
the apples are done, fill the centers with cooked rolled oats. 
Boil down the syrup until of a rather thick consistency, and 
pour over the apples. Other left over cereals may be used 
in the same way. 

NORMANDY PUDDING 

6 ounces bread crumbs i saltspoon ground cloves 

6 ounces sugar I teaspoon ground cinnamon 

6 small sour cooking apples i lemon 

Peel, slice and core the apples, or chop them up not too 
finely ; put them with all the other dry ingredients in a basin, 
and stir well. When thoroughly mixed, add the lemon 
juice and the finely grated rind of a half of it; also, a little 
brandy or rum if liked. Pour the mixture into a well 
greased mold, and tie over a greased cloth or paper, and 
steam for about three hours. Serve with white wine sauce. 
The use of rum or brandy is optional. The pudding is much 
more tasty if one or the other is added. Serve both the 
sauce and the pudding very hot as the latter is not so delicious 
when cold.

MACARONI AND APPLE PUDDING 

1 pound of apples 2 ounces white bread crumbs 
4 ounces pipe macaroni i tablespoon cream 

2 ounces sugar Rind of Y^ lemon grated 

I ounce butter 

Cook the macaroni in boiling water for three-quarters of 
an hour or until it is tender but not broken; drain it well. 
Butter a pie dish or a pudding basin, and line with the 
macaroni. Now sprinkle it with bread crumbs. Pare and 
cut up the apples very fine ; mix with the grated lemon peel, 
cream and sugar. Fill the basin with this mixture, and 
sprinkle a few bread crumbs on top. Cut up the butter, 
and put small pieces on the bread crumbs. Now add a 
layer of macaroni; trim it round, cover with a plate, and 
bake one hour. Turn out and serve with a white sauce. 

RICE AND APPLE PUDDING 

1 breakfast cup of rice 2 cloves 

6 good looking apples J/2 lemon, rind only 

2 teaspoons sugar 

Boil the rice for a quarter of an hour in boiling water; 
strain through a hair sieve. Put a cloth into a pudding 
basin, lay the rice all around it like a crust ; quarter some ap- 
ples as for a tart, and lay them in the middle of the rice, 
add the sugar, lemon rind and cloves over the apples with 
rice, and tie the cloth fairly tight. Boil the pudding for 
one hour, or steam it for one and one-half hours, and serve 
with some sweet sauce poured over. 

APPLE JELLY NO. i 

7 pounds of apples 2 ounces root ginger 

2 ounces blanched almonds i teaspoon ground ginger 

3 pints water 

Boil the apples In the water for an hour and a half; then 
strain through a sieve. Add to each pint of liquor three- 



FRUIT DESSERTS 275 

quarters of a pound of sugar, and boil the liquor twenty 
minutes. Then add the sugar and ginger, and boil twenty 
minutes more. Put the jelly into small jars, and before it 
sets drop in the nuts. Lemon juice may be added instead of 
ginger if preferred. 

APPLE JELLY NO. 2 

6 pounds of apples 3 pints of water 

Lump sugar 

Peel, core, and cut up the apples, and bake in a stew jar 
with three pints of water. When a pulp, turn into a jelly 
bag, and hang over a pan all night for juice to run through. 
To every pint of juice add one pound lump sugar, and boil 
one hour ; when properly done, it will be stiff. Put into air- 
tight jars. 

APPLE MOLD 
4 pounds of apples i pound lump sugar 

Wipe the apples quite clean, core, and cut them up, and 
put in a stew jar in the oven with a little sugar sprinkled 
over, and stew till quite soft, and allow to cool. When cold, 
rub through a sieve. Rinse a preserving pan with cold 
water and put in the pulp, together with the sugar, and boil 
about half an hour, stirring all the time. It requires great 
care to prevent burning, ' and must be boiled quickly, or it 
will not set firmly in the mold, which must be rinsed with 
cold water before putting in the jelly. 

APPLE PUDDING 
Paste Apples Sugar 

Line a pudding bowl with paste according to recipe {oh 
paste for puddings. Fill it with sliced apples, and sweeten 
to taste. Put on cover of paste, and steam. A pudding 
made in a pint basin will take two hours to steam, and one 
made in a quart basin will take three hours. 



276 MEATLESS COOKERY 

ALMOND APPLE 

8 tart apples ^ pound almonds 

lyi cups sugar i lemon 

i^ cups water i tablespoon cornstarch 

Core, and pare the apples. Cut the lemon in half, and 
rub the apples with the lemon to prevent discoloration. 
Make a syrup of the sugar and water. Cook the apples 
in the syrup. Remove from the syrup when done, and place 
in a pudding dish. Press obliquely into them the blanched 
almonds split in halves. Dredge the apples and almonds 
with sugar, and brown in the oven. Add one cup water 
and one teaspoon lemon juice to the syrup. Moisten the 
cornstarch with a little cold water, and add to the hot syrup. 
Cook five minutes. Place the apples in a serving dish, and 
pour the syrup around them. Serve cold with whipped 
cream. 

BROWN BETTY 
3 cups chopped apples j4^ teaspoon nutmeg 

2 cups bread crumbs Juice and rind )4. lemon 

J4 cup sugar J4 cup water 

^ teaspoon cinnamon 2 tablespoons butter 

Mix the sugar with the spices. Arrange one-half of the 
crumbs in the bottom of the pan. Place one-half the apples, 
one-half the sugar and one-half the lemon juice, also one- 
half the melted butter, over them, then one-fourth of the 
bread crumbs and the remainder of the apples, the sugar, 
the lemon and the melted butter. Over all this pour the 
water. If apples are very juicy, omit all or part of the 
water. Cover with the remaining fourth of the bread 
crumbs. Put in a moderate oven, cover, and bake until 
the apples begin to get tender ; then remove the cover. 

BROWN BETTY WITH CHEESE 
Arrange in a deep earthenware baking dish, alternate 
layers of bread crumbs and thinly sliced apples. Season 



FRUIT DESSERTS 277 

with cinnamon, also a little clove if desired and brown sugar. 
Scatter some finely shaved mild full-cream cheese over each 
layer of apple^ When the dish is full, scatter bread crumbs 
over the top, and bake thirty to forty-five minutes, placing 
the dish in a pan of water so that the pudding will not burn. 

If preferred, this may be sweetened with molasses mixed 
with an equal amount of hot water, and poured over the 
top, a half cup of molasses being sufficient for a quart pud- 
ding dishful. 

Cheese may be used in place of butter in a similar way in 
other apple puddings. Apple pie made with a layer of finely 
shaved cheese over the seasoned apple and baked in the usual 
way is liked by many who are fond of cheese served with 
apple pie. 

APPLE SNOW BALLS 
ij^ cups rice 6 to 8 apples 

3^ quarts water 2 tablespoons sugar 

syi teaspoons salt i teaspoon cinnamon 

Cook the rice in boiling salted water, and drain and dry. 
Wash, core and pare the apples. Wring out small pudding 
cloths, or squares of cheese cloth, in hot water. Spread 
the rice one-third inch over the cloth, place apples in the 
center, with one teaspoon of sugar mixed with one-sixth tea- 
spoon of cinnamon in the center. Draw up the cloth around 
the fruit until it is covered with rice. Tie in the apples 
being careful not to have the rice and cloth in folds, and 
steam until fruit is tender — one-half to three-quarters of 
an hour. Serve with lemon sauce or cream. 

PINEAPPLE CREAM DESSERT 

'^2 cup rice i ciip cream 

2 slices Hawaiian pineapple 2 tablespoons sugar 

Boil the rice until tender but not broken. Drain, and 
dry for about five minutes in a moderate oven and cool. 



27'8 MEATLESS COOKERY 

Cut the pineapple intd small pieces, and add the sugar. Stir 
the rice occasionally, as It is cooling, to prevent its packing. 
When the mixture is thoroughly cold, whip the cream until 
stiff. Heavy cream is preferable, but thin cream may be 
made to whip if thoroughly chilled. Fold the whipped 
cream into the mixture. 

PEACH TRIFLE 

2 pounds of peaches 4 ounces sugar 

I gill of water Stale plain cake 

I gill cream 

Cut the peaches in halves, removing the stones, cook them 
with the sugar and water until tender, but not broken. Re- 
move the center of the cake, being careful not to break it, 
leaving a wall about an inch and a quarter thick all around. 
Soak this with the syrup, and fill the corners with the fruit. 
Whip the cream with a teaspoon of sugar, and put around 
the top of the cake, leaving the fruit piled up in the center. 

PEACHES AND CREAM WITH RICE BISCUIT 

Select thoroughly ripened peaches or whole halves of 
canned fruit. Place a half peach on a toasted rice biscuit, 
and serve immediately with whipped cream. 

RASPBERRY JAM 

I pound of raspberries ^ pound of crushed loaf sugar 

When the fruit has been carefully picked, put it with the 
sugar in layers on a dish, or in a deep bowl, according to the 
quantity of fruit that is to be preserved. Let it remain for 
four hours, and then turn it into a preserving pan, and bring 
it to a boiling point quickly, stirring almost continuously to 
prevent from burning. Remove the scum as it rises or the 
jam will not be clear. Let it boil gently for three-quarters 
of an hour, after it boils evenly all over. Turn it into jars, 



FRUIT DESSERTS 279 

and when cold cover in the ordinary way, and store it in a 
dry place. 

RASPBERRY JELLY 
I pint of raspberry juice i pound of loaf sugar 

To draw the juice from the berries, put them in a jar, and 
bruise them slightly; then place the jar in a pan of boiling 
water and keep it boiling gently until the juice flows freely. 
Lay a piece of muslin in a fine sieve, and pour the juice into it 
until no more flows; then turn the fruit into the sieve, and 
leave it to let the juice dr^in away from it, but it must not be 
pressed or the juice will be muddy. Measure the juice care- 
fully, and add the sugar in lumps, in the quantity given. 
Let it boil gently, and skim it carefully. When it has boiled 
for half an hour, pour a teaspoon on a cold plate, and if it 
sets the jelly is done; if not, let it boil a little longer. Put 
it in small pots, and cover when cold in the usual way. The 
flavor is much improved by one part of red currant juice 
being used to two parts of raspberry. 

COOKED SULTANAS 
Pick over, and clean any quantity of sultanas, and cover 
them with boiling water at night, and they are ready for 
breakfast next morning. May be eaten alone or with por- 
ridge or wheat flakes and cream.

MELON COMPOTE 

2 pounds melon i teaspoon ground ginger 

4 ounces sugar Ginger 

A bay leaf 
Take off the hard outside of the melon, and remove all the 
center, cut into pieces about the size of a plum. Make a 
syrup of the sugar flavored with a little of the melon peel, 
bay leaf and the ginger, in about half a pint of water; let 
this simmer for about an hour, and pour it over the pieces 
of melon, 

BAKED PEARS 

6 medium-sized pears J^ cup brown sugar 

Butter 

Select firm and ripe pears, without blemish. Cut in halves 
lengthwise. Remove the core, and sprinkle with brown 
sugar, using a tablespoon for each pear. Dot each half with 
two or three small bits of butter. Bake until tender and 
nicely browned in a moderate oven. Serve with whipped 
cream. 

BLACKBERRY JELLY 

Blackberries Yz pound sugar to every pint of juice 

Put as many blackberries as desired into a jar, and sprinkle 
a little sugar over; then put in the oven for three hours to 
draw out the juice. When sufficiently tender, strain through 
coarse muslin or cloth, squeezing out as much juice as pos- 
sible. To each pint of juice allow half a pound of lump 
sugar, and boil in a preserving pan until it is set. 

STRAWBERRY OR GOOSEBERRY FOOL 

I pound of either fruit i gill of water or milk 

J4 pound sugar . i gill of cream 

Cook the fruit in the water' or milk with the sugar for 
twenty minutes, or until tender and well cooked; then rub 



FRUIT DESSERTS 281 

through a sieve with a wooden spoon. When the fruit is 
cold add the cream, mi^ well, and serve cold. 

STRAWBERRY PUDDING 

2 ounces of flour i ounce sugar 

4 ounces butter 2 tablespoons strawberry jam 

J4. teaspoon carbonate soda 
Beat the butter to a cream; add it to the sugar. Sprinkle 
the flour in gradually, stirring all the time. Stir in the jam; 
add the soda last. Steam in a well-buttered mold or basin 
for four hours. 

QUEEN'S TARTLETS 

Puff paste Sugar 

Fresh strawberries or raspberries Whipped cream 

Make the paste according to the recipe for puff paste. 
When the tartlet cases are baked and just cool, fill them with 
either fresh strawberries or raspberries, slightly broken up 
and covered with sugar. Leave room for the whipped 
cream, which must be put on top. 

GOOSEBERRY TART 

I pound green gooseberries 2 tablespoons water 

6 ounces sugar Paste 

Pick the gooseberries, and put them in a tart dish; cover 
them with sugar, and put in the water. Cover with paste, 
and bake in hot oven. When the paste is baked, it is better 
to place the tart on the top of the stove to simmer until the 
gooseberries are quite tender. If the crust is carefully 
lifted with a knife, a skewer may be inserted to see whether 
the gooseberries are sufficiently cooked, as the tart will be 
spoiled unless they are quite soft. 

GREEN GAGES STEWED 

I pounid of green gages 6 ounces sugar 

% pint water 



282 MEATLESS COOKERY 

Put the green gages In a stewpan, and pour over them suf- 
ficient water to cover them, and let them boil up quickly, and 
continue boiling for a minute. Now turn them carefully in a 
colander, and as soon as they are cool enough to touch, 
remove the skins; they will come off quite easily. Make a 
syrup with the sugar and water, but do not let it boil after the 
sugar is melted. As each green gage has the skin removed 
drop it into the syrup. Bring them to boiling point, but do 
not let them boil; they must simmer very gently for an hour. 
If they are carefully done they will be unbroken when they 
are cooked. All plums are much better by having the skins 
removed, as most of the acid which disagrees with many 
people is in the skins. 

DAMSON CHEESE 

Damsons Sugar 

Thoroughly clean as many damsons as desired, break the 
skins with a fork, put into jars to stew in the oven till ten- 
der, sprinkling with sugar. When quite soft allow them 
to cool; then rub through a sieve, and to every pound of 
fruit add nine ounces of sugar. Put them in the preserving 
pan — rinsed out with cold water first — and boil until it 
Is set. A few of the kernels blanched and sprinkled in when 
boiling is an improvement.

rind, and cook until tender and quite dry^ 

CURRANT PUDDING 

6 slices stale bread i pound red currants 

4 ounces raspberries 4 ounces sugar 

I gill of cream 
Cook the fruit and sugar together for ten minutes; then 
dip the slices of bread into the juiCe, and line a plain pudding 
basin with It, each piece overlapping. Then fill the basin 
with the fruit, put a piece of bread on top, cut the bread 
round the edge to make it even with the basin; put a plate 
over and a heavy weight on top, and leave it until it sets, 
which will be in about four hours. Turn out, and put the 
whipped cream on top. This can be made with various kinds 
of fruit In season. 

CASSEROLE OF ORANGES 

6 oranges J4 ounce vegetable gelatine 

8 ounces sugar 

Soak the gelatine in a pint of cold water; put it In a 
brass stewpan with the sugar, and let It boil for five minutes, 
taking care It does not burn. Have the oranges ready, 



284 MEATLESS COOKERY 

peeled, and separated into quarters, taking out all seeds and 
all white skin, add them to the liquid, and boil for ten min- 
utes. Take out the oranges, and place them in a mold. 
Reduce the liquid by boiling until it is barely enough to fill 
the mold, and pour over. Serve cold. 

ORANGE MERINGUE 

4 ounces rice i quart milk 

2 ounces sugar Any flavoring desired 

Boil the rice in the milk for four hours until all the milk 
is absorbed. Pour into a basin, and let it get cold, and turn 
out in a glass dish. Pour over a compote of oranges, and 
put whipped cream on top. 

ORANGE PUDDING 

4 oranges i tablespoon ground rice 

2 tablespoons sifted sugar i pint of milk 

Peel, and cut the oranges into thin slices, and remove all 
the pits and white skin, and sift over the sugar. Warm the 
milk. Make a smooth paste of the ground rice with a little 
water, and add to the milk; stir until thick, and then pour 
over the fruit. Serve either hot or cold. 

ORANGE COMPOTE 

6 oranges i pint of water 

8 ounces of sugar 
Peel, and cut the oranges into rounds. Save all the juice, 
and put it, with some shreds of peel — no white, into the 
water with the sugar. Boil this for one hour to make a 
syrup, and pour over the rounds of oranges, and cool. 

ORANGE BREAD DESSERT 

Cut the cruets from a three-quarter inch slice of fruit or 
graham bread. Spread with butter, and over each put small 
cubes of orange, amounting to about one-half an orange. 



FRUIT DESSERTS 285 

On top of this put a spoon of whipped cream. This simple 
dessert may be varied by using different fruits, such as pine- 
apple, very ripe bananas, soaked or steamed prunes or other 
sauces. The addition of a spoon of whipped cream makes 
a dainty dessert of what would otherwise be a plain sand- 
wich. 

ORANGE FLUFF 

J4 cup sugar J4 cup orange juice 

5 tablespoons cornstarch i tablespoon lemon juice 

I pint boiling water 

Mix the cornstarch and sugar. Stir into the boiling water. 
Stir constantly, and cook directly over the fire until it 
thickens. Put in a double boiler, and cook from one to two 
hours. Cornstarch cooked from one to two hours loses the 
raw taste which is objectionable tp many people. Add the 
fruit juices. Stir until thoroughly mixed; then pour into 
molds wet with cold water. Serve with a sauce made as 
follows : — 

J4 cup butter ^ cup water 

^ cup sugar i tablespoon cornstarch 

J4 cup orange juice i tablespoon lemon juice 

Moisten the cornstarch with a little cold water, and stir 
into one-half cup of the boiling water. Then set in a double 
boiler, and cook for one or two hours. Cream the butter, 
and add the sugar gradually. Add the remaining one-quar- 
ter cup of boiling water. Turn all slowly into the cooked 
cornstarch, and cook until it thickens slightly. Remove 
from the fire, and add the orange and the lemon juice. 
Serve cold. 

ORANGE FRITTERS 

I pint of milk 2 tablespoons sugar 

4 ounces flour 2 sweet oranges 

Few drops vanilla essence 

Mix the flour with a little of the cold milk, put the re- 



286 MEATLESS COOKERY 

mainder of the milk into a double saucepan, and when nearly 
boiling, add the flour and the milk; when thickened strain 
well, and put back into the saucepan to obtain the right con- 
sistency; add the sugar and essence of vanilla. 

Peel the oranges, divide into sections, remove the white 
skiQ, and pits, and cook in half a pint of water and four 
ounces of sugar for about ten minutes; then take up, and 
drain on a sieve. Drop the orange sections into the above 
batter, mixing the whole carefully. Fry the fritters in hot 
butter or oil, taking each orange section up with a spoon, 
with ample batter to well cover it, and so dropping it to 
the fat. Do not fry too many at a time. When of a golden 
color take them up, and drain well on a paper or a cloth. 
Dredge with icing sugar, and serve plain or with an orange 
flavored syrup. These are also used to garnish a rice or 
vermicelli mold. 

MARMALADE 

12 Seville oranges lO pounds of sugar 

6 sweet oranges Rind and juice of 2 lemons 

Slice the oranges v^ry thin, removing all seeds. Put the 
seeds in a small basin, and pour over them a pint of boiling 
water, and allow them to stand until next day. Put the sliced 
oranges Into a stone pan with six quarts of cold water, and 
let them stand for twenty-four hours. Put on to boil with 
the strained liquid from the seeds, and boil for two hours ; 
then add the sugar, and boil another hour or until set. This 
makes about fifteen pounds of marmalade.

CRANBERRY SAUCE 

I quart cranberries i cup sugar 

ij^ to 2 cups water 
Pick over the cranberries very carefully, wash, and cook 
in boiling water. Add the sugar, and cook slowly until the 
berries are soft and tender. The intense acidity of the ber- 
ries may be partly obviated by first parboiling them just for 
five minutes. Then remove from fire, force through a 
strainer, and cool.

twenty-five minutes and pour in a wet mold. 

APPLE CHARLOTTE 

Take one quart of flour which is sifted with two teaspoons 
of baking powder, one teaspoon salt, and rub a little but- 
ter in it. Mix with milk but do not make the dough stiff. 
Mix with this dough two quarts of sliced apples; then line 
a baking pan with hot butter ; pour in the mixture about half 
an inch thick, and put flakes of butter on top. Bake in a 
quick oven. Turn out on a flat dish and serve with a hard 
or wine sauce. 



FRUIT DESSERTS 289 

APPLE ROLL 

Sift one pint of flour into a bowl, make a hole in the cen- 
ter of the flour, and pour in gradually one cup of lukewarm 
water, a pinch of salt and a tablespoon of butter. Stir this 
slowly, making a smooth dough of it and adding a little 
more flour if necessary. Cover the dough, and set it in a 
warm place until you have pared half a peck of apples, and 
cut them very fine in this way: Pare, quarter, and take 
out the cores and seeds, and cut them very fine. Now cover 
the table with a clean cloth, sift flour all over it, and roll out 
the dough as thin as possible. Put your hands under the 
rolled dough, and stretch it gently so as to not tear it, walk- 
ing all around the table as you do this to get it even and as 
thin as tissue paper. Pour a few tablespoons of melted 
butter over the dough; then the apples, brown sugar, cinna- 
mon and raisins. Now take hold of the tablecloth with 
both hands about a yard apart, and begin to roll the dough, 
it will almost roll itself if the cloth is lifted high enough. 
Butter a large cake pan, hold it against the edge of the table, 
and roll the dough into it. Bake an even brown, basting 
often with butter. 

CHERRY ROLL 

Make a dough of one pint of flour, a pinch of salt and a 
little lukewarm water, being careful not to make it too stiff- 
Slap the dough back and forth on the board, holding it in 
the right hand, and hitting it on the board. Do this for 
fifteen minutes ; then put the dough in a warm covered bowl, 
and set in a warm place for half an hour. Stem and pit two 
quarts of sour cherries. Grate into them some stale bread 
and the peel of half a lemon. Add half a pound or more of 
sugar, some ground cinnamon and about four ounces of 
pounded sweet almonds, and mix all thoroughly. Proceed 
now as with the apple roll in rolling out the dough, sprinkling 



290 MEATLESS COOKERY 

over the thin dough the cherry mixture. Then roll by hold- 
ing up one end of the cloth. Fold the dough into a double 
knot, put in a buttered pan, and bake a light brown. Baste 
often while baking. Secure the edges of the dough so the 
juice will not escape, and butter the top before putting in 
the oven. 

CHERRY ROLY-POLY 

Make a biscuit dough, and roll it out until it is about 
quarter of an inch thick. Pit, and stew a pint of cherries 
and sweeten to taste. 

Spread over the dough thickly, and roll it, taking care to 
keep the cherries from falling out. Wrap a cloth around 
it, and sew it up loosely with coarse thread, allowing plenty 
of room for the dough to expand. 

Set it in a steamer, and steam for an hour and a half. 
Serve with sugar a:nd cream. 

STRAWBERRY SHORTCAKE 

4 cups flour 4 teaspoons baking powder 

1 teaspoon salt i quart strawberries 

2 ounces butter Milk 

Hull the berries, sweeten and mash them slightly with a 
spoon, and stand aside. Sift the salt and baking powder 
with the flour and cut in the butter; add sufficient milk to
