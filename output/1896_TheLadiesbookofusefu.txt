I O the ladies of America is this h'ttle work, " The Ladies' Book of 
Useful Information," dedicated. It is a book written ex- 
pressly for women. This book is full from cover to cover of useful and 
necessary information for women. Never before has so much knowledge 
with which women should be acquainted been printed in one book. It is 
a perfect storehouse of useful facts. Almost every lady spends many 
dollars every year for cosmetics, medir-nes, household articles, etc., which 
this book would save her. 

This is a book which every lady should have, and which every mother 
should place in the hands of her daughters as they come to years of 
understanding. Every girl of twelve and upwards should read this 
valuable work. 

Many books costing from three to five dollars do not contain half 
the information contained in this work. Everything described in this 
preface is taught in this book. 

It teaches ladies the secret of Youth, Beauty, Health. 

The first chapter teaches all about Personal Beauty. 

Every lady desires to be beautiful, and it is the duty of every woman 
to be as attractive as possible. All may enhance their charms and be 
lovely by following the directions of this book. Few persons know how 
to improve their natural looks so as to captivate, charm, and win the 
admiration of those whom they meet. This book tells the wonderful 
secret — all the ancients ever knew, and all that has been discovered 
since. It teaches how to wondei fully improve the person in loveliness. 
The real secret of changing an ordinary looking person into one of great 
beauty makes this book of great value. Nature does something for us, 
but art must make the perfect man or woman. 

If you desire bright, melting eyes, a clear, soft, rose-tinted complexion, 
beautiful hands and graceful figure, well developed and perfect, use the 
knowledge which you will find in this book. 

It teaches how to acquire a beautiful, delicate loveliness which can- 
not be surpassed, and which can be retained to a very late age. By 
means of this teaching a woman of thirty-five or forty can easily pass for 
a girl of twenty-five.

4 PREFACE. 

It teaches how to conceal the evidence of age, and how to make the 
most stubbornly red and rough hands beautifully soft and white. 
Remember that " The Ladies' Book of Useful Information " does 
not teach the use of paint and powder, which is injurious to the skin, but 
how to make the c/ieek s:;low with health, and the neck, arms and hands 
to rival the lily in whiteness. It teaches how to cure Greasy Skin, 
Freckles, Pimples, Wrinkles, Blackheads, Crow's-feet, Blotches, P'ace 
Grubs, Tarf, Sunburn, Chapped Hands, Sore Lips, etc. 

It teaches how to cure and prevent redness and roughness, and to 
make the skin soft, smooth, white and delicate, producing a perfectly 
natural appearance. It teaches how to cure and refine a coarse skin, so 
that it will be clear and white. 

It tells what has never before been published : How to restore 
a fair, rosy complexion to its original freshness, after it has become sallow 
and faded. This is a wonderful secret, and is sure in its results. It will 
also cause those who have always been pale to have beautiful, bright, 
rosy cheeks, and the eyes to be brilliant and sparkling. 

It teaches how to have soft, white and attractive hands, even though 
compelled to do housework. Every lady desires to have nic: hands, and 
all may do so by following the directions of this bock. The most coarse, 
rough, red hands will, by following this teaching, become beautifully 
delicate and white, and it causes very little trouble to care for them. 

It teaches how to care for the hair so as to improve the growth and 
to have a beautiful and luxuriant head of hair ; how to keep the skin 
of the scalp healthy, to cure Dandruff, to prevent the hair falling, and to 
Lave it of a nice glossy hue. 

It teaches how to have clear and brilliant eyes, with beautiful, long, 
drooping lashes ; also, hov/ to cure sore and weak eyes. 

It teaches how to care for the teeth so as to have them white and 
sound, telling how to treat those that are decayed, and how to prevent 
the decay of sound ones. 

It teaches how to have beautiful ripe red lips, and how to cure 
sore and chapped lips. 

It teaches how to cure Warts, Corns, Bruises, Sprains, Cold Feet, 
Bad Breath, etc. 

It teaches how to bleach, purify and whiten the most stubbornly 
red, rough skin, so that it will be beautifully clear and white ; and a 
complexion that is naturally passable will be admired by all who see it 
after being treated, as here described.

When you desire the " love " of any one whom you meet, you can 
very readily reach him if you observe the directions here given.

Principles. 

Treats of the proper age to marry : which marriages are the most 
happy ; which are the most productive of handsome children ; how 
nature assists arrt in the choice of partners ; the attributes of a handsome 
couple, etc. 

Chapter six : Sexual Intercourse — Its Laws and Conditions — Its 
Use and Abuse. 

There is an alarming and increasing prevalence of nervous ailments 
and complicated disorders that could be traced to have their sole origin 
in the ignorance, which is so universal, of the laws of these organs. 

This chapter teaches all about sexual morality ; how men and 
women should live ; the law from the age of puberty to marriage ; the 
law of marriage ; what a man who truly loves a woman will do ; a true 
union ; how women are protected ; the false and the true sense of duty ; 
what is the most powerful restraint from evil. 

The above is discussed in a chaste, simple manner, and should be 
read by every lady. There is nothing impure in this book from beginning 
to end, but subjects in which women are woefully ignorant are discussed 
in a plain, moral manner to which no objection can be raised. 

Chapter seven : Marriage. 

What marriage is; how far back the marriage tie has existed; polygamy, 
what it is ; monogamy, what it is ; polyandry, and what it is ; marriage 
customs ; the basis of a happy marriage, etc.

Perhaps there is no more eventfal period in the history of woman 
than that in which she first becomes conscious that the existence of 






i 



PREFACE. 



another beiiig is dependent upcn her own, and that she carries about 
with her the first tiny rudiments of an immortal soul. 

This chapter explains all the signs of pregnancy ; the changes that 
take piace in the face and neck ; the suppression of the monthly flow ; 
changes in the breast, etc. 

Then it gives a sure test for the detection of pregnancy. It tells 
how a pregnant woman should live during the period of gestation. 

Childbirth is not necessarily either painful or dangerous. It can be 
accomplished easily and safely and with comparatively no pain by 
following the directions given in " The Ladies' Book ok Useful 
Information." 

Numerous instances are known where ladies who had previously 
suffered with severe labor in childbirth have, by attending to the direc- 
tions here given, been delivered of fine, healthy children with comparative 
east. 

No mother who has attended to the teaching here given but has 
blessed the knowledge of it, and it has saved many a young mother much 
needless terror. 

It tells all about the ailments that almost always torment women 
during the trying time of pregnancy, making life itself seem a burden. 

These troubles are : Morning Sickness, Toothache, Palpitation of 
the Heart, etc. It shows that thfere is no necessity for women suffering 
as they almost invariably do during this time ; but that these troubles 
may be overcome by sin.ple, safe remedies which are described in this 
book, and which may be sately taken by the patient, 

It tells all about the medicine which is taken by the Indian women 
of North America during the period of gestation. It is well known that 
the women of these tribes suffer very little during childbirth, and it is 
almost all due to the effects of this wonderful medicine. 

The recipe for this medicine, " Parturient Balm," was obtained from 
an Indian doctor, and is given in this book, together with instructions as 
to how it is to be taken. 

This chapter alone is worth the price of the book to any lady. 
Every mother, and everyone who ever expects to become a mother, 
should carefully study the above chapter, as it may be the means of 
saving her much pain and suffering. 

The same chapter explains all about a case of labor : the signs 
that show when labor has commenced ; what to give to help the patient ; 
the different kinds of pains ; the length of time between the pains ; the 



8 



PREFACE. 



7 



length of time the pains should last, etc.; the taking of the child from the 
mother ; how to care for the child ; the taking away of the afterbirth ; what 
to do in case of flooding ; how to relieve afterpains, etc. 

It also explains what "Abortion " is ; what causes abortion ; \/hat 
causes premature labor ; the difference between the two ; symptoms of 
threatened abortion, and how to prevent the same if possible ; what to do 
for miscarriage, and to try and prevent it, etc. 

The ninth chapter teaches all about : Menstruation — Change of 
Life — Falling of the Womb, etc. Tells the time of life at which the 
menses should appear. 

Every mother should watch her young daughter as she nears this 
critical time. The health for many years to come depends to a great 
extent on how a girl passes this period. This chapter tells all the 
symptoms of the near approach of the monthly flow. It shows a mother 
how to care for her daughter, and to see that she has proper attention 
during this time. 

It tells the age at which the periodical flow should commence ; the 
symptoms of its approach ; how a girl should be treated at this time ; 
how to cure Chlorosis, or Green Sickness ; how to relieve and cure 
painful and suppressed menstruation, etc. 

If the instructions of this book are followed in cases like the above, 
it will save many young girls much needless suff*ering. 

This chapter also treats on : Whites, or Flour Albus, and Falling of 
the Womb. 

Many delicate women suffer great agony through these two distressing 
complaints. This chapter describes all the symptoms of these complaints, 
and gives simple, safe remedies for them. A lady can easily attend to 
herself and avoid exposure. 

It also treats on Change of Life. 

By the phrase " Change of Life," or " The Critical Period," we 
understand the final cessation or stoppage of the menses. This chapter 
explains all about this trying time, the symptoms of its appearance, and 
the ages at which it usually occurs. 

With proper care this period may be safely passed, and a happy and 
comfortable old age be spent. All the dangers incident to this period are 
described, and how to successfully combat them.

Chapter eighteen gives twelve recipes for articles needed in every 
household. It will tell you how to save a large percentage of household 
expenses, and also how to have a great many of the articles you use in 
your daily housework of a superior quality, vastly better than the ones 
you are using at the present time. 

It is a fact not generally known, that a great many of the articles 
used in daily household work cost little more than one-tenth of the price 
the consumer pays. We purpose to show the readers of this book how to 
have, in most instances, better articles than those they buy, for a small 
percentage of the cost. To do this, we have, by our own personal investi- 
gation, gathered a number of valuable recipes together, and have paid for 
the privilege of using them. 

We give in " The Ladies' Book of Useful Information " twelve 
recipes which have never before been published, and which, if you once 
possess, you will never wish to be without, as they are truly valuable 
secrets. 

The list is as follows : Healing salve ; Magnetic croup cure ; Worm 
elixir ; Brilliant self-shining stove polish ; Wonderful starch enamel ; 
Royal washing powder ; Magic annihilator ; I X L baking powder ; 
Electric powder ; French polish or dressing for leather ; Artificial honey. 

It also contains a list of all the poisons and their antidotes. It 
describes the symptoms of poisoning and how to proceed in each case.

book of great value. Nature does something for us, but art must make the 
perfect man or woman. If you desire bright, melting eyes; a clear, soft, 
rosy-tinted complexion; beautiful hands; and graceful figure, well-developed 
and perfect, use the knowledge which you will find in this book. 

It teaches how to conceal the evidence of age; how to make the most 
stubbornly red and rough hands beautifully soft and white. Remember 
that " The Ladies' Book of Useful Information " does not teach the use 
of paint and powder, which is injurious to the skin, but how to make the 
cheek glow with health, and the neck, arms, and hands to rival the lily in 
whiteness. It teaches how to cure Greasy Skin, Freckles, Wrinkles, 
Pimples, Blackheads, Crow's-feet, Blotches, Face Grubs, Tan, Sunburn, 
Chapped Hands, Sore Lips, etc. It teaches how to cure and ])revent 
redness and roughness, and to make the skin soft, smooth, white and 
delicate, producing a perfectly healthy and natural appearance. It teaches 
how to cure and refine a coarse skin, so that it will be clear and white. 

It teaches how to have soft, white and attractive hands, even though 
compelled to do housework. Every l?dy desires to have nice hands, and 
all may do so by following the directions of this chapter. 

It teaches how to care for the hair so as to improve the growth and 
to have a beautiful and luxuriant head of hair ; how to keep the skin of 
the scalp healthy ; to cure dandruff; to prevent the hair falling, and to 
have it of a nice color. 

It teaches how to have clear and brilliant eyes, with beautiful, long, 
drooping lashes. Also, how to cure sore and weak eyes.

CHAPTER I. 
PERSONAL BEAUTY. 

Treating of the Care of the Skin, Hair, Teeth, and Eyes, 

so as to have each arrive at the highest degree 

of beauty of which each is capable. 

A great object of importance, of care to every lady, isjhe care of her 
complexion. There is nothing more pleasing to the eye than a delicate, 
smooth skin ; and besides being pleasing to the eye, is an evidence of 
health, and gives additional grace to the most regular features. 'J'he 
choice of soaps has considerable influence in promoting and maintaining 
this desideratum. These should invariably be selected of the fmest kinds, 
<nnd used sparingly, and never with cold water, for the alkali which, more 
or less, mingles in the composition of all soaps has an undoubted tend- 
ency to irritate a delicate skin ; warm water excites a gentle perspiration, 
thereby assisting the skin to throw ofif those natural secretions which, if 
allowed to remaui, are likely to accumulate below the skin and produce 
roughness, pimples, and even eruptions of an obstinate and unpleasant 
character. Those soaps which ensure a moderate fairness and flexibility 
of the skin are the most desirable for regular use, 

Pomade.s, when properly prepared, contribute in an especial manner 
to preserve the softness and elasticity of the skin, their effect being of an 
emollient and congenial nature ; and, moreover, they can be applied on 
retiring to rest, when their effects are not liable to be disturbed by the 
action of the atmosphere, muscular exertions or nervous influences. 

The use of paints has been very correctly characterized as "a species 
of corporeal hypocrisy as subversive of delicacy of mind as it is of the 
natural complexion," and has been, of late years, discarded at thejoiletie 
of every lady.

TIIK LADIES HOOK 



The use of cosmetics lias been common in all age;, and in every land. 
Scripture itself records the painting of Jezebel; and E/ekiel, the prophet, 
speaks of the eye-painting common among the women; and jcremiali, of 
rending the face with painting — a most exjiressive term for tlie destruction 
of beauty by such means. E''or the surest destroyers of real beauty are its 
simulators. The usurper destroys the rightful sovereign. 

That paint can ever deceive people, or really add beauty for more 
than the duration of an acted charade or play, when "distance lends 
enchantment to the view," is a delusion ; but it is one into which women 
of all times and nations have fallen — from the painted Indian squaw to 
the rouged and powdered denizen of London or Paris. 

Milk was the favorite cosmetic of the ladies of ancient Rome. They 
applied plasters of bread and ass's milk to their faces at night, and 
washed them off with milk in the morning. 

As a cosmetic, milk would be harmless, but we doubt its power of 
improving the skin. As a beverage, no doubt, it whitens the complexion 
more than any other food. 

But before we speak of improving the complexion, it will be well to 
explain to our readers the nature and properties of the skin. 

This is what an American physician has recently told us about it : — 

THE SKIN -ITS BEAUTY, USES, CONSTRUCTION, 
MANAGEMENT, ETC. 

Every person knows what the skin is, its external appearance, and its 
general properties ; but there are many of my readers who may not be 
aware of its peculiar and wonderful construction, its compound character, 
and its manifold uses. It not merely acts as an organ of sense, and a 
protection to the surface of the body, but it clothes it, as it were, in a 
garment of the most delicate texture and of the most surpassing loveliness. 
In perfect health it is gifted with exquisite sensibility, and while it 
possesses the softness of velvet, and exhibits the delicate hues of the lily, 
the carnation, and the rose, it is nevertheless gifted with extraordinary 
strength and power of resisting external injury, and is not only capable of 
repairing, but of actually renewing itself. Though unprotected with hair, 
wool or fur, or with feathers or scales, as with the brute creation, the 
human skin is furnished with innumerable nerves, which endow it with 
extreme susceptibility to all the various changes of climate and of weather, 
and prompt the mind to provide suitable materials, in the shape of cloth- 
ing, to shield it under all the circumstances in which it can be placed.

The importance of the due exposure of the body to daylight or 
sunlight cannot be too strongly insisted on. Light and warmth are 
powerful agents in the economy of our being. '1 he former especially is 
an operative agent on which health, vigor, and eveii beauty itself, depend. 
Withdraw the light of the sun from the organic world, and all its various 
beings and objects would languish and gradually lose those charms which 
are now their characteristics. In its absence, the carnation tint leaves the 
cheek of beauty, the cherry hue of the lips changes to a leaden-purple, the 
eyes become glassy and expressionless, and the complexion assumes an 
unnatural, cadaverous appearance that speaks of sickness, night and death. 
So powerful is daylight, so necessary to our well-being, that even its 
partial exclusion, or its insufficient admission to our apartments, soon tells 
its tale in the feeble health, the liability to the attacks of disease, and the 
])allid features (vacant and sunken, or flibby, pendent and uninviting) of 
their inmates. Even the aspect of the rooms in which we i)ass most of 
our time, and the number and extent of their windows, is perceptible, by 
the trained eye, in the complexion and features of those that occupy them. 
So in the vegetable world — the bright and endlessly varied hues of flowers, 
and their sweet perfumes — even their "ery production — dei)er '' on sunlight. 
In obscure light plants grow lanky and become pale and feeble. They 
seldom produce flowers, and uniformly fail to ri|)en their seeds. In even 
partial darkness the green hue of their foliage gradually pales and 
disappears, and new growths, when they appear, are blanched or 
colorless. 

The best method of keejjing the skin clean and healthy, by ablution 
and baths, may here be alluded to. The use of these, and the washing of 
the skin that forms i)art of the daily duties of tlie toilet, appear to be very 
simple matters, but writers on the subject differ in ojiinion as to the 
methods to be followed to render them perfect cleansers of the skin. 
Some of them regard the use of soap and water applied in the form of 
lather with the hands, and afterwards thoroughly removed from the skin 
by copious aff"iisions, rinsing or sluicing with water, or immersion in it, as 
the best method. This is probably the case \Vhen the skin is not materi- 
ally dirty, or its pores or surface obstructed or loaded with the residual 
solid matter of the perspiration or its own unctuous exudation and 
exuvise. To remove these completely and readily, something more than 
simple friction with the smooth hand is generally required. In such cases 
the use of a piece of flannel or serge, doubled and spread across the hand, 
or of a mitlen of the same material, will be most ready and effective. 



24 



THE ladies' book 



Friction with this — first with soap, and afterwards with water to wash the 
soap off — will be found to cleanse the skin more thoroughly and quickly 
than any other method, and, by removing the worn-out portion of its surface, 
to impart to it a healthy glow and hue that is most refreshing and agree- 
able. This effect will be increased by wiping and rubbing the surface 
thoroughly dry with a coarse and moderately rough, but not a stiff, towel, 
instead of with the fine, smooth diapers which are now so commonly 
employed. At the bath, the fleshbrush usually provided there will 
supersede the necessity of using the flannel. 

The small black spots and marks frequently observed on the skin in 
hot weather, particularly on the face, generally arise from the accumu- 
lation of the indurated solid matter of the perspiration in its pores. 
When they assume the form of small pimples (acne punctata), and often 
when otherwise, they may be removed by strong pressure between the 
fingers, or between the nails of the opposite fingers, followed by the use 
of hoi, soapy water. 

The subsequent daily application of a weak solution of bichloride of 
mercury — as in the form commonly known as Gowland's lotion — or of 
sulphate o{ zinc, will completely remove the swelling, and generally pre- 
vent their re-formation. 

Eruptions are too well known to need any lengthy description 
here. They are usually classified, by writers on the subject, into : ani- 
nialcular eruptions, or those due to the presence of animalcula (minute 
acari) in the scarfskin, which occasion much irritation, and of which the 
itch furnishes a well-marked example ; papular eruptions, or dry pimjjles ; 
pustular eruptions, or mattery pimples, of which some forms are popularly 
known as crusted tetters ; scaly eruptions, or dry tetters ; and vesicular 
eruptions, or watery pimples. 

The treatment of all of the above, except the first, in simple cases, 
where there is not much constitutional disarrangement, consists mainly in 
attention to the general principles of health, cleanliness, exercise, food, 
ventilation, and clothing. Occasional doses of mild saline aperients 
(Epsom salts, cream of tartar, or phosphate of soda, or of sulphur com- 
bined with cream of tartar) should be taken, and warm or tepid bathing, 
preferably in sea-water, or, if not convenient, rain \vater, frequently 
had recourse to. Stimulants of all kinds should be avoided, and the red 
meats, ripe fruits, and the antiscorbutic vegetables should form a con- 
siderable portion of the diet. Lemonade, made by squeezing the juice of

a lemon into a half-pint tumbler full of water, ai \ sweetening with a little 
sugar, should be frequently and liberally taken as one of the best bever- 
ages in such cases. To relieve the itching and irritation (except in the 
pustular, crusted, and vesicular varieties), brisk friction with a flesh- 
brush or a fleshglove may be employed. The parts should also be 
wetted with an appropriate lotion after each friction or bath, or the use of 
soap and water. 

In all the scaly eruptions, iodide of potassium internally, and 
iodurctted or sulphuretted lotions or baths are invaluable. In many of 
them of a malignant or obstinate character, as Lepra Psoriasis, Lupus, 
etc, small doses of solution of arsenite of potassa (liquor arsenicalis ; 
the dose, from 3 to 5 drops, gradually and cautiously increased to 7 to 9 
drops, twice a day, after a meal) i)rove highly serviceable. In the forms 
of psoriasis popularly called baker's itch, grocer's itch, and washer- 
woman's itch, the application of ointment of nitrate of mercury, diluted 
with ten or twelve times its weight of lard, has been highly recommended. 
A course of sarsaparilla is also in most cases advantageous. 

The small, hard, distinct pimples — "acne, or acne simplex" of 
medical writers — that occur on the forehead, and occasionally on the 
temples and chin, generally yield to stimulating lotions,, consisting 
of equal parts of strong vinegar, or spirit, and water, or to weak lotions 
of sulphate of zinc, assisted by occasional doses of cooling laxatives, as 
the salines, or a mixture of sulphur or cream of tartar. 

Freckles, or the round or oval-shaped yellowish or browni'>h-yellow 
spots, resembling stains, common on the face and the backs of the hands 
of persons with a fair and delicate skin who are much exposed to the 
direct rays of the sun in hot weather, ate of little importance in them- 
selves, and have nothing to do with the general health. Ladies who 
desire to remove them may have recourse to the frequent application of 
dilute spirit, or lemon juice, or a lotion formed by adding acetic, hydro- 
chloric, nitric, or sulphuric acid, or liquor of potassa, to water, until it is 
just strong enough to slightly prick the tongue. One ])art of good 
Jamaica rum to two parts of lemon juice or weak vinegar is a good form 
of lotion for the purpose. The effect of all these lotions is increased by 
the addition of a little glycerine. 

The preceding are also occasionally called " common freckles," 
"summer freckles," and "sun freckles." In some cases they are very 
persistent, and resist all attempts to remove them while the exposure that 



26 



THE LADIES BOOK 



t 



!!t 



produces them is continued. Their appearance may be prevented by 
the greater use of tlie veil, parasol or sunshade, or avoidance of exposure 
to the sun during the heat of the day. 

Another variety, popularly known as cold freckles, occur at all 
seasons of the year, and usually dei)end on disordered health or some 
disturbance of the natural functions of the skin. Here the only external 
application that proves useful is the solution of bichloride of mercury and 
glycerine, or Gowland's lotion. 

The Itch — " psora " and " scabies," of medical authors ; the "gale" 
of the French, — already referred to, in its common forms is an eruption 
of minute vesicles, generally containing animalcula (acari), and of which 
the principal seats are between the fingers, bend of the wrist, etc. It is 
accompanied by intense itching of the parts affected, which is only aggra- 
vated by scratching. The usuil treatment is with suli)hur ointment 
(simple or compound) well rubbed in once or twice a day; a spoonful 
(more or less) of flowers of sulphur, mixed with treacle or milk, being 
taken at the .'^ame time, night and morning. Where the external use of 
sulphur is objectionable, on account of its smell, a sulphuretten bath or 
lotion, or one of chloride of lime, may be used instead. In all cases 
extreme cleanliness, with the free use of soap and water, must be strictly 
adhered to. 

The small, soft discolorations and excrescences of the skin, popu- 
larly called moles, may be removed by touching them every second or 
third day with strong acetic or nitric acid, or with lunar caustic. If 
covered with hair they should be shaved first. 

Extreme paleness of the skin, when not symptomatic of any 
primary disease, generally arises from debility, or from the languid 
circulation of the blood at the surface of the body ; often, also, from 
insufficient or improper food, want of outdoor exercise, and the like. 
The main treatment is evident. Warm b.iths, friction, and stimulating 
lotions and cosmetics may be here employed, together with a course of 
some mild chalbeate (as the lactate, protophosphate, or ammonia-citrate 
of iron) and hypophosphate of soda. 

Roughness and Coarseness of the skin, when not depending 
on any particular disease, may be removed or greatly lessened by daily 
friction with mild unguents or oil, or by moistening the parts, night and 
morning, with a weak solution of bichloride of mercury containing a 
little glycerine.

Rashes and redness of the skin, of a common character, often 
arise from very trifling causes, among which indigestion, suppressed 
perspiration, irritation, and the like, arjf the most frequent. Nettle rash 
or urticaria, so called from the appearance and tingling sensations resem- 
bling those caused by the sting of nettles, in some people, is very 
apt to follow the use of indigestible and unwiiolesome food It is usually 
of short duration and recurrent. The treatment consists in the adminis- 
tration of mild saline aperients, and, in severe cases, of an emetic, par- 
ticularly when the stomach is still loaded witii indigestible matter. These 
should be followed by copious use of lemonade made from the fresh 
expressed juice. The patient should be lightly but warmly clothed 
during the attack, and exposure to the cold, or to draughts of cold air, 
should be carefully avoided. The further treatment may be similar to 
that noticed under "eruptions." To prevent the recurrence of the attack, 
the objectionable articles of food, and any other known exciting causes, 
must be avoided. Red rash, red blotch, or fiery spot, a common conse- 
quence of disordered health, a sudden fit of dyspepsia, and, in females, 
of tight lacing, and rose rash, false measles, or roseola, having commonly 
a similar origin to the preceding, for the most part require ihe same 
treatment. 

Scurf — "furfur or furfura " — i:. a formation depending on the natu- 
ral and healthy expoliation of the skin on every part of the body on 
which hair or down grow.^, but most extensive and observable or. the 
scalp, on account of the abundance and darker color of the hair there. 
Scurfincss, or excessive scurfiness, is the result of morbid action, and may 
be treated by the frequent use of the fleshbrush or hairbrush, ablution 
with soap and water, and the use of mild stimulating, astringent, or deter- 
gent lotions. 

Scurvy — "scorbutus" of medical writers — is a disease which, even 
in its incipient and early stages, when its presence is often unsuspected, 
is most injurious to the skin and com])Iexion. It usually commences 
with unnatural sallowness, debility, and low spirits. As it proceeds, the 
gums become sore, spongy, and apt to bleed on the slightest pressure or 
friction ; the teeth loosen, and the breath acquires a fcetid odor ; the legs 
swell, eruptions appear on different parts of the body, and at length the 
patient sinks under general emaciation, diarrhoe 1, and hemorrhages. 
Its chief cause is improper food, or, rather, the absence or insufticient 
supply of fresh meat and vegetables in the diet ; to which cold, humidity, 



28 



THE ladies' book 



want of exercise and fresh air may be added as secondary ones. Hence 
its frequent, fatal visitations formerly on shipboard, and its still occasional 
occurrence in ill-victualled ships during long voyages. The treatment 
mainly consists in adopting a liberal diet of fresh animal food and green 
vegetables, with ripe food and an ample allowance of mild ale or beer, or 
lemonade made from the fresh expressed juice, as beverages. In serious 
cases, tonics, as quinine and steel, should also be administered. 

Wi inkles and looseness of the skin depend chiefly on the attenua- 
tion of the cutis or true skin and the reduction in the bulk of the under- 
lying surfacial portions of the body. They cannot be regarded as a 
disease of the skin ; but are the result of long continued bad health, 
anxiety and study, and of general emaciation and old age. Clean' iness, 
nutritious food, vigorous outdoor exercise, agreeable occupation of the 
mind, and an equable and happy temper, retard their formation. What- 
ever tends to promote the general health and to increase the bulk of the 
body, and particularly the disposition of fat in the cellular tissues, also 
tends to remove them and to increase the smoothness and beauty of the 
skin. The free and frequent use of wai n water and soap, followed by the 
daily use of mild, stimulating, cosmetic lotions or fomentations, or friction 
with warm oil of a like character, and cod-liver oil internally, is all that 
art can do for the jnirpose. 

Excoriations, in popular language, are those cases of soreness 
produced by chafing under the arms, behind the ears, and in the wrinkles 
and folds of the skin generally. They occur chiefly in infancy, and in 
stout persons with a delicate skin, who perspire excessively. Extreme 
cleanliness, and carefully wiping the parts dry after washing, with the 
subsequent use of a little violet powder, or finely powdered starch, or 
French chalk scraped or grated very fine, dusted over the parts once or 
twice a day, will generally remove them and prevent their recurrence. 

WASHES FOR THE FACE. 

We do not approve of face washes, but as some ladies will use thenv 
we recommend the following as harmless : Dampen with glycerine tem- 
pered with rose-water, then powder with the finest magnesia. It imparts 
a charming whiteness. 

Less harmless, but more frequently used, is to procure five cents' 
worth of bismuth, of flake while, and of powdered chalk ; mix with five 
cents' worth of rose-water Great care must be taken to wash off" this 
preparation before retiring to rest, as the bismuth is of a hurtful nature.

To Remove Freckles. — Freckles are of two kinds : Those oc- 
casioned by exposure to the sunshine, and consequently evanescent, are 
denominated " summer freckles " ; those which are constitutional and 
permanent are called " cold freckles." With regard to the latter, it is 
impossible to give any advice which will be of value. They result from 
causes not to be affected by mere external applications. Summer 
freckles are not difficult to deal with, and with a little care the skin may 
be kept free from this cause of disfigurement by using either of the 
following lotions : — 

First : Scrape horse-radish into a cup of sour milk, let it stand twelve 
hours, strain, and apply two or three times a day. 

Second : Into half a pint of milk squeeze the juice of a lemon, with 
a spoonful of brandy, and boil, skimming well ; add a dram of rock alum. 
Apply freely. 

Magic Lotion for Removing Freckles. — Dissolve three grains 
of borax in five drams each of rose-water and orange-flower water. A 
splendid and harmless remedy is equal parts of pure glycerine and rose- 
water, applied every night and allowed to dry on the skin. 

To Remove Freckles and Tan. — Tincture of benzoin, one pint ; 
tincture of tolu, one-half pint ; oil rosemary, one-half ounce. Put one 
teaspoonful of the above mixture in one-quarter pint of water, and then 
with a towel thoroughly bathe the face. Do this every night and 
morning. 

To Expel Freckles. — Finely powdered nitre is excellent. Apply 
it to the face with the finger moistened with water and dipped in the 
powder. 

Cleopatra's Freckle Balm. — A splendid article. Venice soap, 
one ounce ; lemon juice, half ounce ; oil of bitter almonds, quarter ounce ; 
deliquidated oil of tartar, quarter ounce ; oil of rhodium, three drops. 
Dissolve the soap in the lemon juice, then add the two oils, and put the 
whole in the sun till it acquires the consistency of ointment, and then 
add the oil rhodium. Anoint the freckly face at night with this balm, 
and wash in the morning with pure water. 

Lemon Cream for Sunburn and Freckles. — Put two spoon- 
fuls of sweet cream into half a pint of new milk, squeeze into it the juice 
of a lemon, add half a glass of genuine French brandy, a little alum and 
loaf sugar ; boil the whole, skim it well, and when cool it is fit for use.

Wash to Prevent Sunburn.— Take two drams of borax, one 
dram of Roinan alum, one dram of camphor, half an ounce of sugar 
candy, one pound of ox-gall. Mix and stir well together, and repeat the 
stirring three or four times a day until it becomes transparent ; then 
strain it through filtering or blotting paper, and it will be fit for use. 
Wash the face with the mixture before you go into the sup. 

Grape Lotion for Sunburn. — Dip a bunch of green grapes in a 
basin of water; sprinkle it witii powdered alum and salt mixed ; wrap 
the grapes in paper, and bake them under hot ashes ; then express the 
juice, and wash the face with the liquid, which will remove either freckles, 
tan or sunburn. 

To Soften and Whiten the Skin — Pate Axerasive of 
Bozin. — This celebrated perfume has the distinction of being highly 
commended by the French Royal Academy of Medicine. It is better 
for toilet use than soaps, which contain alkali. 

Take powder of bitter almonds, eight ounces ; oil of the same, 
twelve ounces ; savon vert of the perfumes, eight ounces ; spermaceti, 
four ounces ; soap powder, four ounces ; cinnabar, two drams ; essence 
of rose, one dram. Melt the soap and spermaceti with the oil in a bath 
water ; add the powder, and mix the whole in a marble mortar. It forms 
a paste which softens and whitens the skin better than any soap. 

To Remove Red Pimples. — .Sulphur water, one ounce; acetated 
liquor of ammonia, quarter ounce ; liquor of potassa, one grain ; white 
wine vinegar, two ounces ; distilled water, two ounces.

To Cure Profuse Perspiration. — Baihe the hands, feet, and 
parts of the body where the perspiration is greatest, with a cold infusion 
of rosemary and sage, and aftervards dust the stockings and under- 
garments with a mixture of two drams of camphor, four ounces of orris 
root, and sixteen ounces of starch, the whole reduced to a fine powder. 
Put the mixture in a coarse muslin bag, and shake it over the clothes. 

Cleopatra's Enamel for Whitening the Hands and Arms.— 

One ounce of myrrii, four ounces of iioney, two ounces of yellow wax, six 
ounces of rose-water. Mix well together ihe wax, honey and rose-water 
in a dish held over boiling water, and add the myrrh while hot. Rub 
this thickly over the skin before going to bed. 

To Cure Freckles and Parched or Rough Skin. -Take one 
ounce of sweet almonds, or of pitachia nuts, half a j)int of elder or rose 
water, and one ounce of pure glycerine ; grate the nuts and ])ut the 
powder in a little linen or cotton bag, and squeeze it for several minutes 
in the rose-water ; then add the glycerine and a little perfume. Use it 
by wetting the face two or three times a day. This is a grateful applica- 
tion for a parched, rough skin, and is good for the removal of freckles. 
It should be allowed to dry thoroughly. When it feels pasty or sticky it 
may be washed off with a little warm water without soap. 

TO PURIFY THE BREATH. 

There is nothing more disagreeable to peoi)le with whom we asso- 
ciate than for them to be able to detect a bad odor from our breath when 
in their company. Yet a great many are afflicted in this way. The 
following will purify and sweeten the breath : Chlorate of lime, seven 
drams ; vanilla sugar, three drams ; gumeratic, five drams. Mix well 
with warm water to a stiff paste, and cut into lozenges. Take a lozenge 
occasionally. 



TO BLEACH AND PURIFY THE SKIN OF THE FACE AND NECK. 

A celebrated physician gives the following as a good skin bleacher 
and purifier : Haifa pint of skim milk; slice into it as much cucumber as 
it will cover, and let it stand an hour ; then bathe the face, neck, and 
hands. Wash them off with clean soft water when the cucumber extract 
is dry. If the skin is rough from exposure to the wind, an application of 
buttermilk at night, washed o.T with fine carbolic soap in the morning, 
will make the skin smooth and natural.

To Permanently Remove Black Specks or "Flesh- 
worms." — Sometimes little black specks appear about the base of the 
nose, or on tiie forehead, or in the hollow of the chin, which are called 
flesh-worms, and are occasioned by coagulated lymph that obstructs the 
pores of the skin. They niay be squeezed out by pressing the skin, and 
ignorant people suppose them to be little worms. They are permanently 
removed by washing with very warm water, and severe friction with a 
towel and then applying a little of the following preparation : Liquor of 
potassa, one ounce ; cologne, two ounces ; white brandy, four ounces. 

French Face Wash Purifies and Brightens the Com- 
plexion.— Take equal parts of the seeds of the melon, pumpkin, gourd, 
and cucumber, pounded till they are reduced to powder ; add to it suffi- 
cient fresh cream to dilute the flour, and then add milk enough to reduce 
the whole to a thick paste. Add a grain of musk and a few drops of the 
oil of lemon. Anoint the face with this, leave it on twenty or thirty 
minutes, or over night if convenient, and wash off with warm water. It 
gives a remarkable purity and brightness to the complexion. 

Or, try this ; splendid. — Infuse a handful of well-sifted wheat bran 
for four hours in white wine vinegar ; add to it five yolks of eggs and two 
grains of musk, and distill the whole. Bottle it, keep carefully corked for 
fifteen days, when it will be fit for use. Apply over night, and wash in 
the morning with tepid water. 

To Remove Pimples. — There are many kinds of pimples, some 
of which partake almost of the nature of ulcers, which require medical 
treatment ; but the small red pimple, which is most common, may be 
removed by applying the following twice a day : Sulphur water, one 
ounce; acetated liquid of ammonia, one-quarter ounce; liquor of potassa, 
one grain ; while wine vinegar, two ounces ; distilled water, two ounces. 
These pimples are sometimes cured by frequent washing in warm water 
and prolonged friction with a coarse towel. The cause of these pimples 
is obstruction of the skin and imperfect circulation. 

To Remove Tan. — Creme de'l Endos. — New milk, half a pint ; 
lemon juice, one-quarter ounce ; white brandy, half ounce. Boil the 
whole and skim it clear from all skum. Use night a.:d morning. 

A Cosmetic Bath. — Take two pounds of barley or bean flour, 
eight pounds of bran, and a few handfuls of Borage leaves. Boil these 
ingredients in a sufficient quantity of spring water. This both cleanses 
and softens the skin in a superior manner.

Kalydor for the Complexion. — For pimples, freckle - tanned 
skin, or scurf on the skin. Take emulsion of bitter almonds, one pint ; 
oxymuriate of quicksilver, two and one-half pints ; sal ammoniac, one 
dram. To be used moderately by means of a sponge, after washing the 
face and hands with pure soap and warm water. 

To Improve the Skin. — Take two ounces of Venice soap and 
dissolve it in two ounces of lemon juice. Add one ounce of the oil of 
bitter almonds and a like quantity of the oil of tartar. Mix the whole 
and stir it well till it has acquired the consistence of soap, and use it as 
such for the hands. The paste of sweet almonds, which contains an oil 
fit for keeping the skin soft and elastic and removing indurations, may be 
beneficially applied to the hands and arms. 

Wash a la Marie Antoinette. — Gives a beautiful brilliancy to 
the complexion. Take half a dozen lemons and cut them in small pieces, 
a :mall handful of the leaves of white lilies and southernwood, and infuse 
them in two quarts of cows milk, with an ounce and a half of white sugar 
and an ounce of rock alum. These are to be distilled in palneum niarise. 
The face at bedtime is to be rubbed with this liquid, and it will give a 
beautiful luster to the complexion. It is a safe application, and its effects 
are certain. 

Liquid Rouge. — Harmless — a perfect imitation of nature. For 
ladies who wish to use a little artificial bloom the following is recom- 
mended. A liquid rouge to produce a perfect imitation of the colors of 
nature is prepared as follows : Add to a pint of French brandy, half an 
ounce of benzoin, an ounce of red sandalwood, half an ounce of Brazil 
wood and the same quantity of rock alum. Cork the bottle carefully, 
shake it well once a day, and at the end of twelve days it will be fit for 
use. The checks are to be lightly touched with it. 

Milk of Roses. — This is a cosmetic. Pound an ounce of almonds 
in a mortar very finely ; then put in shavings of honey soap in a small 
quantity. Add enough rose-water to enable you to work the composition 
with the pestle into a fine cream ; and in order that it may keep, add to 
the whole an ounce of spirits of wine, by slow degrees. Scent with otto 
of roses. Strain through muslin. Apply to the face with a sponge or a 
piece of lint. 

Circassian Cream. — This celebrated preparation is made, accord- 
ing to a published recipe, in this way : Castor oil, one pint ; almond 



wm

oil, four ounces ; liquid potassa, three drams ; essence of bergamot, oil of 
cloves, and oil of lemon, in equal quantities ; and about a dozen drops of 
otto of roses. 

Toilet Vinegar. — Add to the best malt vinegar, half a pint of 
cognac and a pint of rose-water. Scent may be added, and if so, it should 
be first mixed with the spirit before the other ingredients are put in. 

Bloom Rose. — This is a preparation of carmine for the face and 
lips. Take a quarter of a dram of carmine and place it in a phial with 
half a dram of liquid ammonia ; keep for a few days, occasionally shaking 
the mixture ; then dilute with two ounces of rose-water, to which half a 
dram of essence of roses has been added. Draw off and keep a week or 
ten days, then apply with the corner of a soft handkerchief, taking care 
that if the color is too bright it is reduced by means of pure water. 

Certain Cure for Eruptions, Pimples, Etc. — Having in 
numerous instances seen the good effects of the following prescription, I 
can certify to its perfect remedy : Dilute corrosive sublimate with the oil 
of almonds, apply it to the face occasionally, and in few days a cure will 
be effected. 

To Clear the Complexion, and Reduce the Size.— It is 

essential that the blood should be cleansed. Take a teaspoonful of 
powdered charcoal, mixed with water or honey, for three successive nights, 
then use a seidlitz powder to remove it from the system. It acts splendidly 
upon the system and purifies the blood; but under no circumstances must 
the physic be neglected to carry the chemicals from the system ; if not, 
ill effects are certain to follow. 

To Cure and Refine a Stippled or Blotched Skin. — A small 
dose of teraxacum every other night will most materially aid in refining 
the skin. It is a month's or six weeks' job to accomplish the desired 
result. You must also wear a mask of quilted cotton, wet in cold water, 
over night. Do not get discouraged, for it is worth the trouble. 

TO CURE AND PREVENT WRINKLES. 

Pomade d'Hebe. — This pomade is used for the removal of 
wrinkles. To make : Melt white wax, one ounce, to gentle heat ; add 
juice of lily bulbs, two ounces ; add honey, two ounces ; rose-water, two 
drams; and otto of roses, a drop or two. Use twice a day.

Lotion for Wrinkles. — Heautifies the face, preserves the freshness 
of youth, and gives a beautiful brilh'ancy to the skin. Take the second 
water of barley, one pint, and strain liirouj^h a piece of fine linen ; add a 
dozen drops of the balm of Mecca ; shake it well together until the balm 
is thoroughly incorporated with the water, which will be effected when the 
water assumes a whitish or turgid appearance. Before applying, wash the 
face with soft water. If used once a day, this lotion will beautify the face, 
remove wrinkles, preserve the freshness of youth, and give a surprising 
brilliancy to the skin. 

Wash for Wrinkles. — Take two ounces of the juice of onions, 
two ounces of the white lily, two ounces of Norboune honey, and one 
ounce of white wax ; jnit the whole into a new earthen pipkin until the 
wax is melted, then take the pipkin (crock) off the fire, and continue 
stirring briskly until the mixture grows cold. This should be applied en 
going to bed and allowed to remain on till the morning. 

To Remove Wrinkles. — To one fiuid ounce of tincture of gum 
benzoin add seven fluid ounces of distilled rose-water and one-half ounce 
of glycerine. Bathe face, neck, and hands with it at night, letting it 
dry on. \Vash off in the morning with a very little pure white castile 
soap and soft water. This is a famous cosmetic, and has been sold 
under various names. It is an excellent remedy for tan, freckles, and 
sunburn also. 



HOW TO HAVE BRILLIANT, BEAUTIFUL EYES. 

Beautiful eyes are the gift of nature ; but even those of the greatest 
beauty may owe something to the toilet, while those of an indifferent 
kind are very susceptible of improvement. We entirely discountenance 
any tampering with the eye itself, with a view to giving it luster or bright- 
ness. The sight has often been injured by the use of belladonna, prepa- 
rations of the calabar bean, eyebright, and other substances having a 
strong effect on the eyes. But without touching the eye itself, it is pos- 
sible to give the effect of brightness, softness, etc., by means of the eyelids 
*nd eyelashes. Made-up eyes are by no means desirable, and to many 
are singularly displeasing ; but the same may be said of made-up faces 
generally. Some ladies are, however, persuaded thcit it adds to their 
charms to give the eyes a long, almond shape — after the Egyptian type — 
while very many are persuaded that the eye is not seen to advantage 
unless its apparent size is increased by the darkening of the lids. Both

THE ladies' book 



these effects are produced by kohl, a black powder, which may be pro- 
cured at tlie chemist's, and is mixed with rose-water and applied with a 
camel's-hair brush. 

To Cure Weak Eyes. — It is well to have on the toilet table a 
remedy for inflamed eyes. Spermaceti ointment is simple and well 
adapted for the purpose. Apply at night, and wash off with rose-water 
in the morning. Golden ointment will serve a like purpose. Or, there 
is a simple lotion made by dissolving a very small piece of alum and a 
piece of lump sugar of the same size in a quart of water. Put the 
ingredients into water cold and let them simmer. Bathe the eyes 
frequently with it. Sties in the eyes are irritating and disfiguring. 
Foment with warm water ; at night apply a bread and milk poultice. 
When a white head forms, prick it with a fine needle. Should the inflam- 
mation be obstinate, a little citerine ointment may be applied, care being 
taken that it does not get into the eye, and an aperient should be tried. 

To Improve the Eyelashes. — Many people speak highly of this 
secret. Trim the tiny points slightly, and anoint with this salve : Two 
drams of ointment of nitric oxida of mercury, and one dram of lard. 
Mix the lard and ointment well, and anoint the edges of the eyelids night 
and morning, after each time, with milk and water. This will restore the 
lashes when all other remedies fail. It is not known in this country, and 
is a valuable secret. 

To Cure Weakness of Eyes. — Sulphate of copper, fifteen grains ; 
camphor, four grains ; boiling water, four ounces. Mix, stiain, and 
when cold make up to four pints with water. Eathe the eyes night and 
morning with a portion of the mixture. 

How to Have Beautiful Eyelashes. — The effect of the eyes is 
greatly aided by beautiful eyelashes. These may be secured to a certain 
extent by a little care, especially if it is taken early in life. The extreme 
ends should be cut with a pair of small, sharp scissors, care being taken 
to preserve the natural outline, not to leave jagged edges. Attention to 
this matter results in the lengthening of the lashes. Dyeing them is 
another expedient often resorted to for increasing their effect. A good 
permanent black is all that is needed, and for this use Indian ink. As 
an impromptu expedient to serve for one night, a hairpin held for a few 
seconds in the flame of a candle, and drawn through the lashes, will serve 
to color them well, and with sufficient durability. It need scarcely be

added that the hairpin must be sulTered to grow cold before it is used, or 
the coiiseciueiice may be that no eyelash will be left to color. Good eye- 
brows are not to be produced artificially. It is possible, however, to 
prevent those that are really good from degenerating through neglect. 
When wiping the face dry after washing, pass a corner of the towel over 
the forefinger and set the eyebrows in the form you wish them to assume. 
And when oiling the hair, do not forget to oil the eyebrows also. 

To Cure Watery and Inflamed Eyes. — Foment frequently with 
decoction of poppy heads. When the irritation and intlammation occur, a 
teaspoonful of cognac brandy in four ounces of spring water may be used 
three or four times in the course of the day as a strengthening lotion. 

General Care of the Eyes. — The eyes, of all the features, stand 
pre-eminent for their beauty and ever-varying powers of expression, and 
for being the organs of the most exalted, delicate and useful of the 
senses. It is they alone that " reveal the external forms of beauty to 
the mind, and enable it to perceive them, even at a distance, with the 
speed of light. It is they alone tb.at clothe the whole creation 
with the magic charms of color, and fix on every object the identity of 
figure. It is the eyes alone, or chiefly, that reveal the emotions of the 
mind to others, and that clothe the features with the language of tae soul. 
Melting with pity, or glowing with hope, or redolent with love, benevo- 
lence, desire, or emulation, they impart to the countenance those vital 
fascinations which are the peculiar attributes of man." " And when the 
mind is subdued by fear, anxiety or shame, or overwhelmed by sorrow or 
despair, the eyes, like faithful chroniclers, still tell the truthful story of 
the mental disquietude. And hatred, anger, envy, pride, and jealousy, 
ambition, avarice, discontent, and all the varied passions and emotions 
that torment, excite or depress the human soul, and find a resting 
place in the human breast, obtain expression in the eyes. At one mo- 
ment the instruments' of receiving and imparting pleasure, at another the 
willing or passive instruments of pain, their influences and changes are 
as varied and boundless as the empire of thought itself." Through their 
silent expressions the mind reveals its workings to the external world in 
signs more rapid and as palpable as those uttered by the tongue. It is 
"the eyes alone that stamp the face with the outward symbol of animation 
and vitality," and which endue it with the visible "sanctity of reason." 
The eye is, indeed, the chief and most speaking feature of the face, and 
the one on whose excellence, more than any other, its beauty depends.

Theories have been based on'even the peculiar color of the eyes. 
Thus, it is said that dark blue eyes are found chiefly in persons of 
delicate, refined or effeminate mental character ; light blue eyes, and 
more particularly gray eyes, in the hardy and active ; hazel eyes, in the 
masculine, vigorous, and profound ; black eyes, in those whose energy is 
of a desultory or remittent character, and who exhibit fickleness in 
pursuits and affection. Greenish eyes, it is asserted, have the same 
general meaning as gray eyes, with the addition of selfishness or a 
sinistro. disposition. These statements, however, though based on 
some general truths, and supported by popular opinion, are liable to so 
many exceptions as to be unreliable and valueless in their individual 
applications. 

Shakespeare is said to have had hazel eyes ; Swift, blue eyes ; Mil- 
ton, Scott, and Byron, gray eyes. Wellington and Napoleon are also said 
to have had gray eyes. 

A beautiful eye is one that is full, clear, and brilliant ; appropriate 
in color to the complexion, and in form to the features, and of which the 
connected parts — the eyelids, eyelashes, and eyebrows, which, with it, in 
a general view of the subject, collectively form the external eye — are also 
beautiful, and in keeping with it. 

To increase the beauty and expression of the eyes, various means are 
occasionally had recourse to, nearly all of which, except those herein 
mentioned in conn.-'ction with the eyelashes and eyebrows, are not merely ' 
highly objectionable, but even dangerous. Thus, some fashionable ladies 
and actresses, to enhance the clearness and brilliancy of their eyes before 
appearing in public, are in the hi bit of exposing them to air slightly 
impregnated with the vapor of prussic acid. This is done by placing a 
smgle drop of the dilute acid at the bottom of an eyecup or eyeglass, 
and then holding the cup or glass against the eye for a few seconds, with 
the head in an inclined position. It has also been asserted, and I believe 
correctly, that certain ladies of the demimonde rub a very small quantity 
of belladonna ointment on the brow over e<\ch eye, or moisten the same 
part with a few drops of tincture of belladonna. This produces dilation 
of the pupil, and gives that peculiar fullness and an expression of languor 
to the eyes which, by some, is regarded "s exceedingly fascinating. The 
use of ihese active medicinals in this way must be manifestly injurious ; 
and when frequent, or long continued or carried to excess, must neces- 
result in impaired vision, if not in actual blindness.

The following means of repairing and restoring the sight, which has 
for some time been going the round of the press, being based on scientific 
principles, may be appropriately inserted here : 

For nearsightedness, close the eyes and pass the fingers, very gently, 
several times across them outward, fron* the canthus, or corner next the 
nose, towards the temple. This tends slightly to flatten the corner and 
lens of the eye, and thus to lengthen or extend the angle of vision. The 
operation should be repeated several times a day, or at least always after 
making one's toilet, until shortsightedness is nearly or completely removed. 
For long sight, loss of sight by age, weak sight, and generally for all those 
defects which require the use of magnifying glasses, gently pass the finger, 
or napkin, from the outer angle or corner of the eyes inward, above and 
below the eyeball, towards the nose. This tends slightly to " round 
up " the eyes, and thus to preserve or to restore the sight. It should be 
done every time the eyes are washed, or oftener. 

TO HAVE A BEAUTIFUL MOUTH AND LIPS. 

The beauty of the human mouth and lips, the delicacy of their 
formation and tints, their power of expression, which is only inferior to 
that of the eyes, and their elevated position as the media with the palate, 
tongue, and teeth, by which we communicate our thoughts to others m an 
audible form, need scarcely be dilated on here. The poet tells us that: 

" Tlie lips of woman out of rose.-, take 

The tints with which they ever stain themselves. 

They are the beautiful, lofty shelves 

Where rests the sweetness which the young hours make, 

And which the earnest 1? y, whom we call Love, 

Will often sip in sorrow or in play. 

Health, when it comes, doth ruddiness approve, 

But his strong foe soon flatters it away ! 

Disease and health for a warm pair of lips, 

Like \otk and Lancaster, wage active strife : 

One on his banner front the White rose keeps, 

And one the Red ; and thus with woman's life, 

Her lips are made a battle-field for those 

Who struggle for the color of a rose." 

A beautiful mouth is one that is moderately small, and has a well- 
defined and graceful outline ; and beautiful lips are gracefully molded, 
neither thick nor thin, nor compressed nor lax, and that are endowed 
with expression and are tinted with the hues of health. 

The ladies of Eastern nations commonly heighten the hue and fresh- 
ness of their lips by means of cosmetics, a ])ractice which in Western 
Europe is only adopted on the stage, and occasionally by courtesans and 
ladies of the domimonde.

Chapped lips most frequently occur in persons witii pale, bluish, 
moist lips and a languid circulation, who are much exposed to the wind 
or who are continually moving from heated apartments to the external air. 
East and north-east winds are those that generally produce them. The 
occasional application of a little cold cream, lip salve, spermaceti ointment, 
or any other mild unguent, will generally prevent them, and remove them 
when they have already formed. A still more elegant and effective pre- 
ventive and remedy is glycerine diluted with about twice its weight of 
eau de-rose, or glycerinated lip salve or balsam. 

The moist vesicular eruption of the lips, referred to above, may also 
generally be prevented by the use of glycerine, or any of the preparations 
just mentioned. After its accession, the best treatment is to freely dust 
the affected portion of the lips with violet powder, finely powdered starch, 
prepared chalk, or French chalk or talc reduced to an impalpable pow- 
der by scraping or grating it. 

The following formulas of preparations aic all valuable for beautify- 
ing and preserving the beauty of the lips : — 

White Lip Salve — No. 1. — Take half a pound spermaceti oint- 
ment, li(iuify it by the heat of warm water, and stir in one-half dram 
neroli or essence de petit-grain. In a few minutes pour off the clear 
portion from the dregs (if any) and add twenty drops of oil of rose. 
Lastly, before it cools, pour it into jars. 

Lip Salve — No. 2. — This indispensable adjunct to the toilet is 
made by melting in a jar, placed in a basin of boiling water, a quarter of 
an ounce each of white wax and spermaceti; flour of benzoin, fifteen 
grains; and half an ounce of oil of almonds. Stir till the mixture is cool. 
Color red with two-penny worth of alkanet root. Splendid for keeping 
the lips healthy and of a beautiful crimson color, 

French Lip Salve. — Lard, twenty-six ounces ; white wax, two 
ounces ; nitre and alum in fine powder, of each one-half ounce ; alkanet 
to color. 

German Lip Salve. — Butter of cacao, one-half ounce; oil of 
almonds, one quarter ounce; melt together with a gentle heat, and add 
six drops of essence of lemon. 

THE CARE OF THE TEETH. 

The influence which the teeth are capable of exercising on the 
personal appearance is usually known and admitted.

The teeth have formed especial objects of attention, in connection 
with the toilet and cosmetic art's, from almost the earliest ages of the 
world to the present time. History and tradition, and the researches of 
archswologists among the remains of the prehistoric nations of the East, 
show us that even dentistry may trace back its origin to a date not very 
long subsequent to the "confusion of tongues." 

We are told that the ancient Welsh took particular care of their 
teeth, by frequently rubbing them with a stick of green hazel and a 
woollen cloth. To prevent their premature decay, they scrupulously 
avoided acid liquids, and invariably abstained from all hot food and 
drink. 

Europeans pride themselves on teeth of pearly whiteness ; but many 
Asiatic nations regard them as beautiful only when of a black color. 
The Chinese, in order to blacken them, chew what is called " betel " or 
" betel nut," a common masticatory in the East. The Siamese and the 
Tonquinese do the same, but to a still greater extent, which renders their 
cceth as black as ebony, or moie so. As the use of the masticatory is 
generally not commenced until a certain age, the common practice is to 
stain the teeth of the boys and girls with a strong preparation of it, on 
the former attaining the age of ten or twelve. 

Keeping the lips apart and breathing through the mouth instead of 
the nose, and, particularly, sleeping with the mouth open, are habits which 
are very prejudicial to the teeth and gums. In this way the mouth forms 
a trap to catch the dust and gritty particles floating in the atmosphere, 
which soon mechanically injure the enamel of the teeth by attrition. 

On the subject of cleanliness in connection with the teeth and 
mouth, it may be said that the mouth cannot be too frequently rinsed 
during the day, and that it should be more particularly so treated after 
each meal. Pure cold water is the best for the i)urpose. It not only 
cleans the teeth and mouth, but exerto a tonic action on the gums, which 
warm water, or even tepid water, is deficient in. When cold water cannot 
be tolerated, tepid water may be employed, the temperature being slightly 
lowered once every week or ten days until cold water can be borne. 
Every one who abhors a foetid breath, rotten teeth, and the toothache, 
would do well to thoroughly clean his teeth at bedtime, observing to 
well rinse the mouth with cold water on rising in the morning, and again 
in the day once, or oftener, as the opportunities occur. With smokers, 
the use of the toothbrush the last thing at night is almost obligatory if

they value their teeth and wish to avoid the unpleasant flavor and sensa- 
tion which teeth fouled with tobacco smoke occasion in the mouth on 
awakening in the morning. 

As to tooth powders or pastes to be used with the brush, the simplest 
are the best. Plain camphorated chalk, with or without a little finely 
powdered ])umice stone or burnt hartshorn, is a popular and excellent 
tooth powder. It is capable of exerting sufficient friction under the 
brush to ensure pearly whiteness of the teeth without injuring the 
enamel, whijst the camphor in it tends to destroy the animalcula in the 
secretions of the mouth, whose skeletons or remains constitute, as we 
shall presently see, the incrassation popularly called " tartar." Recently- 
burnt charcoal, in very fine i)Owder, is another excellent tooth powder, 
which, without injuring the enamel, is sufficiently gritty to clean the 
teeth and remove the tartar from them, and possesses the advantage of 
also removing the offensive odor arising from rotten teeth and from 
decomposing organic matter. The charcoal of the heavy hardwoods, as 
lignum-vitse, boxwood, oak, are the best ; and these, as to quality, range 
in the order given. Still more valuable as a dentifrice is areca nut char- 
coal, which, besides possessing the properties of the other vegetable 
charcoals in an eminent degree, has valuable ones peculiar to itself. 

Some dentists, and some persons in imitation of them, in order to 
whiten the teeth, rub their surfaces with hydrochloric acid, somewhat 
dilute ; but the practice is a most dangerous one, which, by a few 
repetitions, will sometimes utterly destroy the enamel and lead to the rapid 
decay of all the teeth so treated. Should the teeth be much discolored, 
and ordinary tooth powder prove ineffective, a little lemon iuice used 
with the brush will generally render them perfectly white. It should only 
be employed occasionally, and the mouth should be well rinsed with 
water afterwards. A little of the pulp of an orange, used in the same 
way, is also very effective and safe, as are also ripe strawberries, which 
may be either rubbed on the teeth with the fingers or applied with the 
brush. The last form, perhaps, the very best natural dentifrice known. 
Besides possessing singular power in whitening and cleaning the teeth 
and rapidly removing tartar, they destroy the offensive odor of rotten 
teeth and impart an agreeable fragrance to the breath. 

The importance of a judicious attention to the teeth, in connection 
with health, cleanliness, and personal comfort and appearance, cannot be 
too often alluded to and enforced.

It is no exaggeration to say that, taking the whole community, there 
are few, very few, who clean their teeth, or even wash tlieir mouths, once 
a day. With the masses the operation, if jjerformed at all, is confined to 
the Sabbath day, or to holidays ; whilst refined, educated, and cleanly 
persons regard the opreation of cleaning the teeth as a daily duty, as 
necessary as washing the face and hands. The dirty and vulgar — the two 
words are here synonymous — wholly neglect it, ai.o too often even con- 
sider it as unnecessary, effeminate, and absurd. The consequences of 
the careless performance, or the neglect, of this really necessary personal 
duty arc not long in being developed. Passing over the degradation of 
the other features, the offensiveness of the breath, often to a degree 
which renders the individual uncompanionable, and the unfavorable im- 
pression which, like other marks of uncleanliness, they convey of the taste 
and habits of their possessor, as the immediate effects of habitually 
neglected and dirty teeth, let us look at the more distant, but not less 
certain, ones : — 

In rases of ordinary toothache, even severe ones, chewing a small 
piece of really good pellitory will often give relief in a few minutes. 
Chewing a piece of strong, unbleached Jamaica ginger will often do the 
same in light cases. The celebrated John Wesley recommended a " few 
whiffs '■■ at a pipe containing a little caraway seed mixed with tobacco as 
a simple and ready means of curing the toothache. I can bear testi- 
mony to the fact that in some cases it succeeds admirably. 

Scarcely anything is more disagreeable, and in marked cases, more 
disgusting, than ftetid breath. It is unpleasant to the person that has 
it, and it renders him unfit for the society of others. The cause of stink- 
ing breath may generally be traced to rotten teeth, diseased stomach, or 
worms. When the first are the cause, the teeth should be thoroughly 
cleansed and then "stopped " in the manner already indicated ; or, when 
this is impracticable, the offending *ooth, or teeth, may be removed and 
replaced by artificial ones. When this cannot be done, or is incon- 
venient, the evil may be greatly lessened by the frequent use of an 
antiseptic tooth powder, areca nut charcoal or camphorated chalk. Dirty 
teeth, even when quite sound, always more or less taint the breath. 
When a foul or a diseased stomach is the cause, mild aperients should be 
administered ; and if these do not succeed, an emetic* may be given, 
scrupulous cleanliness of the teeth being observed, as in the former case. 
When v'orms are the cause, worm medicine, under medical direction, 
will be necessary.

§1 



To Cure Foul Breath. — When bad breath is occasioned by teeth, 
or any local cause, use a gargle consisting of a spoonful of solution of 
chloride of lime in half a tumbler of water. 

To Have White and Beautiful Teeth. — An article known as 
" The Queen's Tooth Preserver " is made as follows : One ounce of 
coarsely powdered Peruvian bark, mixed in half a pint of brandy for 
twelve days. Gargle the mouth (teeth and gums) with a teaspoonful of 
this liquid, diluted with an equal quantity of rose-water. Always wash 
off the teeth after each meal with water. Also, twice a day, wash the 
teeth with the ashes of burned bread — bread burned to ashes. 

For Decayed Teeth. — There is nothing better than two scruples of 
myrrh in tine powder, one scruple of juniper gum, and ten grains of 
alum, mixed in honey. Apply often to the teeth. 

To Cure Toothache. — Take equal parts of camphor, sulphuric 
ether, ammonia, laudanum, tincture of cayenne, and one-eighth part oil 
of cloves. Mix well together. Saturate with the liquid a small piece of 
cotton, and apply to the cavity of the diseased tooth, and the pain will 
cease immediately. 

Premium Tooth Powder. — Six ounces prepared chalk, one-half 
ounce cassia powder, one ounce orris ; mix well. 

Mouth Pastilles for Perfuming the Breath. — First: Extract 
of liquorice, three ounces ; oil of cloves, one and a half drams ; oil of 
cinnamon, fifteen drops. Mix, and divide into one-grain pills. 

Second: Catechu, seven drams; orris powder, forty grains; sugar, 
three ounces ; oil of rosemary (or of cloves, peppermint, or cinnamon), 
four drops. Mix, and roll flat on oiled marble slab, and cut into very 
small tablets. 

Teuchwanger's Tooth Paste. — Powdered myrrh, two ounces ; 
burned alum, one ounce ; cream tartar, one ounce ; cuttlefish bone, four 
ounces ; drop lake, two ounces ; honey, half a gallon. Mix. Reduce 
the proportion for a small quantity. 

Fine Tooth Powder. — Powdered orris root, one ounce ; Peruvian 
bark, one oun(;p ; prepared chalk, one ounce ; myrrh, one-half ounce. 
Mix. 

To Remove Offensive Breath.— For this purpose, almost the 
only substance that should be admitted to the toilet is the concentrated

solution of chloride of soda. From six to ten drops of it in a wineglass- 
ful of spring water, taken immediately after the operations of the toilet 
are completed. 

In some cases, the odor arising from caries is combined with that of 
the stomach. If the mouth be well rinsed with a teaspoonful of the 
solution of the chloride in a tumbler of water, the bad odor of the teeth 
will be removed. 

Rye Tooth Powder. — Rye contains carbonate of lime, carbon- 
ate of magnesia, oxide of iron, manganese, and silica, all suitable for 
application to the teeth. Therefore, a fine tooth powder is made by 
burning rye, or rye bread, to ashes, and grinding it to powder by passing 
the rolling-pin over it. Pass the powder through a sieve, and use. 

Camphorated Chalk. — This favorite tooth powder is easily 
made. Talk a pound of prepared chalk, and with this mix two drams of 
camphor very finely powdered, and moisten with spirits o^ wine. 
Thoroughly mix. 

To Remove the Yellow Color from Teeth. — Take of dry 
hypochlorite of lime, one-half dram ; red coral, two drams. Tincturate 
and mix thoroughly. This powder is employed in the following manner : 
A new brush is slightly moistened, then dipped in the powder and 
applied to the teeth. A few days after the use of this powder the teeth 
will ac<[uire a beautiful white color. 

Camphor Paste. — Take one ounce of oil ammoniac, four 
drams of camphor. Let the above be very finely powdered, then mix it 
with sufficient honey to make it into a smooth paste ; triturate it until 
entirely smooth. This is a most excellent paste for preserving and 
beautifying the teeth. 

Preservative Tincture for the Teeth and Gums, — Take four 
drams of camphor, one ounce of tincture of myi rii, one ounce of tincture 
of bark, and one ounce of rectified s])irits of wine ; mix them, and j^ut 30 
or 40 drops in a wineglassful of water. Pour a little of this upon your 
brush before you apply it to the powder, and when the teeth are clean, 
wash the mouth, teeth, and gums with the remainder. It will in ordinary 
cases prevent toothache. 

Powerfully Cleansing Dentifrice. — Take fine powder of pumice 
stone, four diams ; fine powder of cuttlefish bone, four drams ; add one 
scruple of subcarbonate of soda. Mix them well together, color and 
scent according to taste, and then pass it through a fine sieve.

Infallible Cure for Toothache. — Take alum, reduced to an 
impalpable powder, two drams ; nitreous spirits of etiier, seven drams. 
Mix, and apply them to the tootii. This is said to be an infallible cure 
for all kinds of toothache, unless the disease is connected with rheu- 
matism. 

Mixture for Decayed Teeth. — Make a balsam with a sufficient 
quantity of honey, two scruples of myrrh in fine powder, a scruple of gum 
juniper, and ten grains of rock alum. A portion to be applied frequently 
to the decayed tooth. 

To Whiten and Beautify the Teeth. — Take gum tragacanth, 
one ounce ; pumice stone, two drams ; gum arable, one ounce ; cream of 
tartar, one ounce. Dissolve the gums in rose-water, and adding to it the 
powder, form the whole into little sticks, which are to be dried slowly in 
the shade, and afterwards kept for use. Use on the brush like soap. 

HOW TO HAVE SOFT, WHITE AND BEAUTIFUL HANDS. 

There are very few beautiful hands, but to make the hands beautiful 
rests, with scarcely an exception, with the possessor. Now that chiro- 
mancy has become so fashionable as to be a part of a great many entertain- 
ments, it is very desirable that the hands should present an attractive 
appearance. A soft, white, delicate hand, with neatly-kept nails, forms 
an important factor in a pleasing personal appearance, and is something 
any man or woman may possess themselves of with a little care, Of 
course it goes without saying, that requisite is perfect cleanliness of both 
the hands and nails. The best and purest soap should be used, and 
when soft water cannot be obtained, a kw drops of ammonia, or a little 
borax, should be added to the water in which the hands are washed, and 
they should always be thoroughly dried. A lotion of one ounce glycerine, 
one ounce rose-water, ten drops of carbolic acid, and forty drops of 
hamamelis, is excellent to use on the hands before they are dried each 
time they are washed. 

Persons who do housework should wear the India rubber gloves 
which are made for the purpose and can be purchased in any size for 
from $1.00 to $(,25 as they are with or without wrists. 

Rubbing the hands once or twice a day in oatmeal tends to whiten 
them and make them soft and flexible. 

The following bleaches the hands and arms and makes them beauti- 
fully soft and white : —

Bleaching Lotion. — Bitter almonds, ten ounces; iris powder, one 
ounce ; pulverized horse-chestnut, two ounces ; essence of bergamot, one 
dram ; carbonate of potash, two drams ; mix. Use on the hands after 
washing, and on retiring for the night. 

Five grains of chloridated lime in a pint of warm water will whiten the 
hands and remove all stains, but as this is not always ([uite harmless to a 
delicate skin, it is i)erhaps better to remove stains with a cut of lemon, 
and use the preparation given above for whitening them. 

Tight lacing and tight sleeves, and even tight shoes, will cause the 
hands to be an unsightly red, for which no lotion or care is a remedy. 
If, however, all the clothing is worn so as to allow a free circulation, and 
the directions which have been given are regularly and constantly followed, 
any hand wii! become white, supple and delicate — a pleasure to both 
possessor and beholder; and it is really worth the care, which after a little 
time becomes a fixed habit and so is scarcely noticeable, to have such 
hands. 

To Make the Hands White and Delicate.— Should you wish 
to make your hands white and delicate, wash them in hot milk and water 
for a day or two. On retiring to rest, rub them well over with palm oil, 
and put on a pair of woollen gloves. The hands should be thoroughly 
washed with hot water and soap the next morning, and a pair of soft 
leather gloves worn during the day ; they should be frequently rubbed 
together to promote circulation. Sunburnt hands should be washed in 
lime water or lemon juice. Should they be severely freckled, the following 
will be good to use : Take of distilled water, half a pint ; sal ammoniac, 
half a dram; oxymuriate of quicksilver, four grains ; divide the two last 
in spirit, and gradually add the water to them ; add another half pint of 
water, mix well together, and it is ready for use. It should be applied 
as often as desirable, with a piece of soft sponge. If rose-water is substi- 
tuted for distilled water, the effect is pleasanter. 

Remedy for Chapped Hands. — The simplest remedy is the 
camphor ball, to be obtained of all chemists. Powdered hemlock bark 
put into a piece of muslin and sprinkled on the chaps is highly recom- 
mended. Or, wash with oatmeal, and afterwards rub the hands over with 
dry oatmeal, so as to remove all dampness. It is a good thing to rub the 
hands and lips with glycerine before going to bed at night. A good oil is 
made by simmering : Sweet oil, one pint ; Venice turpentine, three 
ounces ; lard, half a pound ; beeswax, three ounces. Simmer till the wax 
is melted. Rub on, or apply with a rag.

To Cure Red Hands. — Wash them frequently in warm, not hot, 
water, using honey soap and soft towel. Dry with violet jiowder, and 
again with a soft, dry handkerchief. Take exercise enough to promote 
circulation, and do not wear gloves too tight. 

Almond Paste for the Hands. — Take one pound of sweet 
almonds, one-quarter of a pound of bread crumbs, one half a pint of 
spring water, one-half a pint of brandy, and the yolks of two eggs. 
Pound the almonds with a few drops of vinegar or water, to prevent them 
oiling ; add the crumbs of bread, which moisten with the brandy as you 
mix it with the almonds and the yolks of eggs. Set this mixture over a 
slow fire, and stir it continually or it will adhere to the edges. 

Almond Paste for Chapped Hands (which will preserve them 
smooth and white). — The daily use of the following paste will keep tiie 
hands smooth and white: Mix a quarter of a pound of unsalted hog's 
lard, which has been washed in common, and then in rose, water, with the 
yolks of two fresh egi^s and a large spoonful of honey. Add as much 
paste from almonds (well pounded in a mortar) as will work it into a 
paste. 

General Remarks. — The human hand, regarded cither with 
reference to its ingenious construction and usefulness, or to its beauty, 
stands alone, in its superlative excellence, in the whole animal world. In 
no species of animal is the hand so wonderfully formed and so perfectly 
developed as in man. 

To preserve the delicacy and beauty of the hands, some little care, 
and moie than that which is ordinarily bestowed on theiu, is required. 
Foremost in consideration must be the subject of cleanliness. Dirty and 
coarse hands are no less marks of slothfulness and lowbreeding than 
clean and delicate hands are of refinement and gentility. To promote 
softness and whiteness of the skin, mild emollient soaps, or those 
abounding in oil or fiit, should alone be adopted for common use ; by 
which means the tendency to contract chaps and chilblains, and rough- 
ness from drying winds, will also be lessened. The coarse, strong kinds 
of soap, those abounding in alkali, should be rejected, as they tend to 
render the skin rough, dry and brittle. Rain, or soft, water is the best 
natural water for washing the hands, as it cleanses them more rapidly and 
completely than ordinary hard water, and with the use of less soap. It 
may be advantageously used tepid, or even warm ; but hot water should 
be avoided. Distilled water, when obtainable, is preferable to even rain

water. In the absence of tliese, water that has been boiled and allowed 
to settle and cool may be emi)loyed. With hard water the hands are 
cleansed with diftkulty, and though it may be readily softened by the 
addition of a little soda, such an addition tends to make the skin of a 
delicate hand somewhat hard and rough. If hard water must be used to 
wash with, the only harmless substance that can be conveniently added 
to it is a little good powdered borax, This will also cause it to exert a 
genial action on the skin. Oatmeal and warm water used every night 
and morning as a wash will whiten and soften the roughest and darkest 
hands. 

Coarse, Red, Dark-Sklnned Hands may be whitened by the 
occasional use of a few grains of chloride of lime, with warm water, in the 
manner mentioned above. 

• 

Roughness of the Hands, induced by exposure to cold and 
drying winds, may, in general, be removed by the use of a little powdered 
pumice stone with the soap in washing them. The subsequent applica- 
tion, jjarticularly at night, of the above lotions, or of two or three drops 
of almond or olive oil, well rubbed in, will usually effect the object con)- 
pletely. 

The hands may be preserved dry for delicate work by rubbing a 
little club moss (lycopodium), in fine powder, over them. So repellent is 
this substance of moisture, that if a small quantity of it be sprinkled on 
the surface of a basin of water, the hand, by a little adroitness, may be 
plunged to the bottom of the basin without becoming wet. 

Excessive moisture or perspiration of the hands without obvious 
cause is generally indicative of debility, or disordered stomach, and 
requires corresponding treatment. Frequently washing the hands in 
moderately cold water often proves a local remedy for the inconvenience. 
The addition of a few grains of alum, sal ammoniac, or sulphate of zinc, 
or of a teaspoonful of vinegar, to the water greatly increases its efficacy. 
Extremely delicate and susceptible persons cannot always bear the 
excessive perspiration of their hands to be thus suddenly lessened, and 
therefore some discretion should be exercised by them in their attempts 
to check it. 

The Finger Nails require special attention if we desire to pre- 
serve them in their highest condition of beauty and usefulness. To keep 
them clean, the iiailbj-ush and soap and water should be used once 
or oftener daily, as circumstances demand. Once a day at least,

on wiping the hands after washing them, and whilst they are 
stil! soft from the action of the water, the free edge of the scarf- 
skin, which, if not attended to, is apt to grow upward over the nails, 
should be gently loosened and pressed back in a neatly rounded form, 
by which the occurrence of cracks and sores about their roots (agnails, 
nail springs, etc.) will be prevented, and a graceful, oval form, ending in 
a crescentlike space of white, will be ensured. The skin, as ^ rule» 
should never be cut, pared, picked or torn off, as is commonly dt .id 

the less it is meddled with, otherwise than in the way just mention ,., the 
better. The ends or points of the nails should be pared once every week 
or ten days, according to the rapidity of their growth, which somewhat 
varies with the season of the year and the habit of the individual. This 
is best done with a sharp penknife or nail-knife. Scissors are less con- 
venient for the purpose, and Have the disadvantage of straining and dis- 
torting the nails during the process. 

The length and shape of the nails, both for beauty and use, should 
exactly correspond with the tips of the fingers. Nails extending beyond 
the ends of the fingers are vulgar, clawlike, and inconvenient ; whilst if 
shorter, particularly much shorter than the fingers, they are unsightly and 
of little use, and cause the tips of the fingers to become thick and '"'umsy. 
Biting the nails should "be avoided as a dirty and disagreeable h and 
one utterly destructive to their beauty, strength, and usefulness. 

To remove stains and discolorations of the nails, a little lemon juice 
or vinegar and water is tbe best application. Should this fail, a few grains 
of salt of sorrel, oxalic acid, or chloride of lime, each diluted with warm 
water, may be applied, care 'leing taken to thoroughly rinse the hands in 
clean water, without soap, afterwards. Occasionally a little pumice stone, 
in impalpable powder, or powdered cuttlefish bone, putty |)ovvder (pol- 
isher's peroxide of tin), may be used along with water and a piece of wash- 
leather, flannel, or the nailbrush, for the same purpose. The frequent 
use of any of these substances is, however, injuriovis to the healthy 
growth, strength, and permanent beauty of the nails. The common prac- 
tice of scraping the surface of the nans cannot be too strongly censured, 
as it causes them to become weak and distorted. Blows on the nails, 
and, indeed, violence to them in any form, also distorts and marks them. 

The ladies of Oriental nations commonly dye the nails; and amongst 
many savage tribes the same practice is adopted, and is not confined to 
the gentler sex. Amongst Western Europeans, and Americans, white 
and regularly-formed nails are alone esteemed.

Chapped Hands are common among persons with a languid cir- 
culation, who are continually "dabbling" in water during cold weather, 
and particularly among those with a scrofulous taint, who, without the 
last, expose their ungloved hands to bleak, cold winds. The best pre- 
ventives, as well as remedies, are the use of warm gloves out of doors, and 
the application, night and morning, of a little glycerine, diluted with 
twice its weight of water, or a little cold cream, spermaceti cerate, salad 
oil, or any other simple unguent or oil, which should be well rubbed in, 
the superfluous portion beini^ removed with towel. This treatment will 
not only preserve the hands from the effects of cold and damp, but also 
tend to render them soft and white. Deep chaps which have degenerated 
into sores should be kc^pt constantly covered with a piece of lint wetted 
with glycerine or spread with spermaceti ointment, the part being at the 
same time carefully preserved from dirt, cold, and wind. It is said that 
a once favorite actress, celebrated for the beauty of her hands, even when 
in the "sere and yellow leaf," covered them nightly with the flare of a 
calf or lamb, with the fat attached, over which was drawn a glove or mit- 
ten of soft leather. The application of a little glycerine or fitty matter, 
in the way just indicated, would have been equally effective. 

Warts, like chilblains, are too well known to require description. 
They chiefly attack the hands, and particulary the fingers, but sometimes 
occur on other p' ''tions of the body. They may be removed by rubbing 
or moistening thei xtremitii s every day, or every other day, witli lunar 
caustic, nitric acid, > incentrated acetic acid, or aromatic vinegar, care 
being taken not to wash the hands for some hours after. The first is an 
extremely convenient and manageable substance, from not being liable to 
drop or spread ; but it produces a black stain, which remains till the 
cauterized surface peels off". The second produces a yellow stain, in depth 
proportioned to the strength of the acid employed. This also wears off 
after the lapse of a few days. The others scarcely discolor the skin. 

To Cause the Skin to become Satin-smooth, and to Smell 
like a bunch of Violets. — Any one using the following preparation 
w''l be noted for the fair softness of her complexion and the delicate 
pt rfume which emanates from her person. For ladies who like perfume, 
and care for a satin-smooth skin, the following is an invaluable toilet 
preparation ; — 

Have your druggist mix for you one ounce tincture of orris, one ounce 
tincture of benzoin, ten drops oil of neroli, and ten drops oil of lemon.

To use this perfume, add a tablespoonful of it to about a pint of warm 
water. It will turn as white as milk, and the real perfume will be given 
off, whereas while in the bottle it has anything but a pleasing odor. Now, 
after your bath, just take a soft cloth and go ever yourself with this milk, 
dry thoroughly, and you will smell like a bunch of violets. The perfume 
may be altered to suit you, or you may add any handkerchief ey^ ict, but 
don't omit the benzoin, for that is what gives permanence to the perfume 
and softness and smoothness to the skin. 

To Cause Those Who have Lost the Bloom and Fairness 
of Early Youth to Regain Them. — Many ladies who as young girls 
were fair with a lovely jsy bloom, lose these beauties very early in life ; 
very many do this at twenty, or very little later, and become sallow and 
heavy-eyed, thus losing their principal charm. Now, this is very easily 
remedied. Go to your druggist and ask him for some iron pills and for 
some simple ]Durgative to take with them. Get from him directions for 
taking both, and take strictly according to his directions. In a very short 
time you will again be fair and rosy and your eyes bright and sparkling ; 
in fact, you will seem to have renewed your youth, and, indeed, you will 
feel like another person, so light-hearted will you become, in addition to 
your return of beauty. 

THE HAIR. 

Its Estimation, Structure, Growth, Management, Etc. — 

The hair is not '-niy invaluable as a protective covering of the head, but 
it gives a finish and imparts unequalled grace to the features which it 
surrounds. Sculptors and painters have bestowed on its representation 
their highest skill and care, and its description and praises have been 
sung in the sweetest lays by the poets of all ages. Whether in flowing 
ringlets, chaste and simple bands, or graceful braids artistically disposed, 
it is equally charming, and clothes with fascination even the simplest 
forms of beauty. 

O wondrous, wondrous, is her hair ! 
A bri>'''ed wealth of golden brown, 
That drops on neck and temples bare. 

If there is one point more than another on which the tastes of man- 
kind appear to agree, it is that rich, luxuriant, flowing hair is not merely 
beautiful in itself, but an important, nay, an essential, auxiliary to the 
highest development of the personal charms. Among all the refined 
nations of antiquity, as in all time since, the care, arrangement and

i- 



decoration of the hair formed a prominent and generally leading portion 
of their toilet. The ancient Egyptians and Assyrians, and other 
Eastern nations, bestowed on it the most elaborate attention. The 
ancient Jews, like their modern descendants, were noted for the luxuri- 
ance and richness of their hair and the care which thty devoted to it. 
Glossy flowing black hair is represented to have been the glory of the 
ancient Jewess, and in her person to have exhibited charms of the 
most imposing character; whilst the chasteness of its arrangement was 
only equalled by its almost magic beauty. Nor Was this luxuriance, and 
this attention to the hair, confined to the gentler sex, for among the pagan 
Orientals the hair and beards of the males were not less sedulously 
attended to. Among the males of Judah and Israel, long flowing ringlets 
appear to have been regarded as highly desirable and attractive. The 
reputed beauty and the prodigious length and weight of the hair of 
Absalom, the son of David, as recorded in the sacred text, would be 
sufficient to startle Lhe most enthusiastic modern dandy that cultivates 
the crinal ornament of his person. Solomon the Wise, another son of 
David, conceived the beauty of hair sufticiently dignified to express 
figuratively the graces of the Church. 

Tlic hair, though devoid of sensibility and unsusceptible of expression 
under the influence of the will and the ordinary mental feelings, like the 
mobile portions of the face, and though it may be popularly regarded 
rather in -the light of a parasitic growth than as an essential portion of the 
body, is capable of being affected by the stronger emotions and passions, 
and even of aiding the; • expression in the features. Who is there that, at 
some period or other of his life, if only in childhood, in a moment of sudden 
terror or horror, has not experienced the sensation popularly described as 
" the hair standing on end? " Or who is there that, at some time or other, 
has not witnessed the partial erection of the hair in children or females 
under like violent emotions, or seen the representation of it in sculi)tiires 
or paintings ? Tnose passions, so aptly styled by Gray " the vultures of 
the mind," frequently affect with wonderful rapidity the health of both 
the body and the mind, which wreck the hair soon sympathizes with and 
shares. Instances are recorded in which violent grief in a few weeks has 
blanched the hair and anticipated the effects of age; and others in which 
intense terror or horror has affected the same with even greater celerity, 
the change having occurred in a few days or even in a few hours. 

Besides daily attention to the hair, something else is necessary to 
insure its cleanliness and beauty and the perfect health of the skin of the

f i 



head from which it springs. For this purpose the head should be 
occasionally well washed with soap and water, an abundance of water 
being used and great care being subsequently taken to thoroughly rinse 
out the whole of the soap with the water in which the head has been 
washed. The water may be either tepid or cold, according to the feelings 
or habit of the person ; and if the head or hair be very scurfy or dirty, or 
hard water be used, a few grains of soda (not potash or pearlash) may be 
advantageously added to the water. This will increase its detersive 
qualities. After the hair has been washed, which should be done quickly, 
though thoroughly, it should be freed as much as possible by pressure 
with the hands and then wiped with a soft, thick towel, which should be 
done with care, to avoid entangling it. After laying it straight, first with 
the coarse end of the dressing comb and then with the finer portion, it 
may be finally dressed. 

In ordinary cases once every two or three weeks is often enough to 
wash the hair and head. The extreme length of ladies' hair will some- 
times render the process of washing it very troublesome and inconvenient. 
In such cases the patient and assiduous use of a clean, good hairbrush, 
followed by washing the partings and the crown of the head with soap 
and water, may be substituted. 

The occasional washing of the head is absolutely necessary to pre- 
serve the health of the scalp and the luxuriance and beauty of the hair 
when much oil, pomatum or other greasy substance is used in dressing it. 

Medical writers have frequently pointed out the ill effects of the free 
or excessive use of oily or greasy articles for the hair ; but their warnings 
appear to be unheeded by the mass of mankind. Some object to their 
use altogether. There are, however, exceptions to every rule, and some 
of these exceptions are noticed elsewhere in this volume. The ill effects 
referred to chiefly occur from their being used when not required, and in 
excess, and are aggravated by the neglect of thorough cleanliness. 

To improve the growth and luxuriance of the hair, when languid or 
defective, the only natural and perfectly sate method that can be adopted 
is to promote the healthy action of the scalp by increasing the vigor of 
the circulation of the blood through its minute channels. For this pur- 
pose nothing is so simple and effective as gentle excitation of the skin by 
frequent continued friction with the hairbrush, which has the convenience 
of ease of application and inexpensiveness. The same object may be 
further promoted by the application of any simple cosmetic wash or 



OF USEFUL INFORMATION.

Other preparation that will gently excite or stimulate the skin or exercise 
a tonic action on it without clogging its pores. Strong rosemary water 
or rosemary tea, and a weak solution of the essential oil of either rose- 
mary or garden thyme, are popular articles of this kind. They may be 
rendered more stimulating by the addition of a little ammonia or a little 
spirit, or both of them. The skin of the head should be moistened 
with these on each occasion of dressing the hair, and their diffusion and 
action promoted by the use of a clean hairbrush. Aromatized water, to 
which a very little tincture or vinegar of cantharides (preferably the 
former) has been added, may also be used in the same way, and is in 
high repute for the purpose. When the skin is pale, lax, and wrinkled, 
astringent washes may be used. Strong black tea is a convenient and 
excellent application of this kind. When the skin and hair are dry, and 
the latter also stiff and untractable, a little glycerine is an appropriate 
addition to each of the preceding washes or lotions. The occasional use 
of a little bland oil, strongly scented with oil of rosemary or of origanum, 
or with both of them, or with oil of mace, or very slightly tinctured with 
cantharides, is also generally very serviceable when there is poorness and 
dryness of the hair. When the hair is unnaturally greasy and lax (a 
defect that seldom occurs), the use of the astringent washes just referred 
to, or of a little simple oil slightly scented with the essential oil of bitter 
almonds, will tend to remove or lesson it. 

All the articles named above promote the glossiness and waviness of 
the hair, and are also among the simplest, safest, and best applications 
that can be employed v/hen the hair is weak and begins to fall off. 

To impart some degree of curliness or waviness to the hair when it 
is naturally straight, and to render it more retentive of the curl imparted 
to it by papers or by other modes of dressing it, various methods are 
often adopted and different cosmetics employed. The first object 
appears to be promoted by keeping the hair for a time in a state inter- 
mediate between perfect dryness and humidity, from which different parts 
of its structure, being unequally affected in this respect, will acquire 
different degrees of relaxation and rigidity, and thus have a tendency to 
assume a wavy or slightly curly form, provided the hair be left loose 
enough to allow it. For this purpose nothing is better than washing the 
hair with soap and water, to which a few grains of salt of tartar (carbonate 
of potash) have been added ; or it may be slightly moistened with any of 
he hair washes mentioned in the last paragraph, in each half-pint of 
which a few grains of the carbonate (say ten or twelve), or a teaspoonful

of glycerine, has been dissolved. The moistened hair, after the applica- 
tion of the brush, should be finally loosely adjusted as desired with the 
dressing-comb. The effect occurs as the hair dries. When oils are 
preferable to hair washes, those strongly scented with the oil of rosemary, 
to which a few drops of oil of thyme or origanum may be added, appear 
to be the most useful. 

To cause the hair to retain the position given to it in dressing it, 
various methods and cosmetics are commonly employed. When the 
arrangement is a natural one and the hair healthy and tractable, the free 
use of the hairbrush will usually be sufficient for the purpose. When 
this is insufficient, the application of a few drops of oil, or, better still, 
moistening the hair with a little simple water, will effect the object satis- 
factorily. In very elaborate and unnatural styles of dressing the hair, and 
to cause it to remain in curl or to retain its position during dancing, or 
violent exercise, bandoline and cosmetique or hard pomatum are the 
articles commonly employed in fashionable life. Mild ale or porter has a 
similar effect, and is often substituted for the preceding expensive cosmetics. 
The frequent use of any of these articles is objectionable, as they clog up 
the pores of the skin and shield both it and the hair from the genial 
action of the atmosphere, which is essential to their healthy vigor. They 
should, hence, be subsequently removed by carefully washing the head 
with a little soap and tepid water. Their use may be tolerated in dress- 
ing for the ballroom, but on no other occasion. Simple water skillfully 
employed, as noticed elsewhere, is the best and safest mixture, and under 
ordinary circumstances is amply sufficient for the purpose. 

The practice of artificially changing the color of the hair, and 
particularly of dyeing it, has descended to us from remote antiquity, and 
though not so common in Western Europe as formerly, is still far from 
infrequent at the present day. This might be inferred from the multitude 
of nostrums for the purpo'se continually advertised in the newspapers, 
and from the number of persons who announce themselves as practicing 
the art, even though the keen and experienced eye did not frequently 
detect instances of it, as it now does, in the hair and beards of those we 
see around us. The recent rage after light auburn or reddish hair in 
fashionable I'fc has, unfortunately, greatly multiplied these instances. The 
consideration of the subject, however, in its ethical relations does not 
come within the province of the present work, and I shall confine myself 
to pointing out how the color of the hair may be changed in the safest 
and most satisfactory manner.

To change the color of the hair various methods and preparations 
are employed. The principal of these are intended to darken it, but 
sometimes the contrary is aimed at. Whichever object is desired, it is 
necessary that the arcicle or preparation employed to carry ■'*; out be not 
of a caustic or irritant nature, capable of injuriously affecting the delicate 
skin to which it is applied, or that it may be liable to come in contact 
with, as is the case with many of the nostrums vended for the purpose. 
Some of the substances that necessarily enter into the composition of 
hair strains and hair dyes, or that are used in connection with them, 
possess these objectionable properties in a high degree, and can, there- 
fore, only be safely employed in a state of proper dilution and combi- 
nation. If any doubt exists respecting such an article, it is a wise pre- 
caution to regard it with suspicion and to test its qualities before apply- 
ing it for the first time. This may be done by placing some of it on the 
soft skin of the inner side of the wrist or fore-arm, and allowing it to 
remain there as long, and under the same conditions, as it is ordered to 
be left in contact with the hair or skin of the head or face. In this way 
the injury or loss of the hair, sores, and other serious consequences that 
too often follow the use of advertised and ill-prepared hair dyes may be 
generally avoided. 

To gradually darken the shade of the hair on these principles, pro- 
vided its normal sulphur be still secreted by the hair-bulbs and be still 
present in its structure, it will, therefore, generally be sufficient to occa- 
sionally employ a weak solution of any of the milder salts of iron as a hair 
wash. The menstruum may be water, to which a little spirits and a few 
drops of oil of rosemary to increase its stimulating qualities have been 
added. In applying it, the head being first washed clean, care should be 
taken to thoroughly moisten the whole surface of the hair and the skin of 
the head with the wash ; and its absorption and action should be promoted 
by the free use of a clean hairbrush. Wine is the favorite solvent for 
the iron ; ale and beer are also sometimes so employed. Most of the 
fashionable ferruginous hair washes also contain a few grains of acetate of 
copper or distilled verdigris, the objections to which have been already 
pointed out. 

The daily use of oil or pomatum, with which a few grains of car- 
bonate of lead, lead plaster, or trisnitrate of bism-ith, have been blended 
by heat and careful trituration, has generally a like effect on the hair to 
ferruginous solutions ; so also has a leaden comb, but its action is very

uncertain. None of these last are, however, safe for long-continued use. 
Atrophy of the scalp, baldness, and even local paralysis, have sometimes, 
though rarely, been caused by them. 

When the normal sulphur of the hair is absent, or deficient, the pre- 
ceding substances fail to darken the hair. In this case the desired effect 
may often be produced by also moistening the head, say twice a week, 
with water, to which a little sulphuret of potassium or hydrosulphuret of 
ammonia has been added. 

When it is desired to dye or darken the hair more rapidly, as in a 
few hours, or even a few minutes, plumbite of lime, plumbite of potassa, 
or nitrate or ammonia— nitrate of silver — is usually employed. The first 
is commonly produced by the admixture of quicklime with oxide of lead 
(litharge), carbonate of lead, or acetate of lead. These ingredients 
should be in appropriate proportions, but very generally the reverse is 
the case in those of the shops. 

It may be laid down as a rule that when the lime is in greater pro- 
portion than about two to one of the oxide, and to the corresponding 
equivalents of the other substances mentioned, or when the lime has not 
been prepared in a proper m inner, the compound is not safe, and very 
likely to prove injurious to the skin and hair-bulbs, and perhaps to act 
as a depilatory. The effects of these lead dyes arise partly in the way 
previously described and partly by direct chemical action between the 
sulphur of the hair and the lead which they contain, sulphuret of lead 
being formed in the surfacial portion of the hair. It is on the last that 
their more immediate effect depends. If there be no sulphur in the hair, 
they will not darken it. After the necessary period of contact, they 
should be gently but thoroughly removed from the hair and skin by 
rubbing them off with the fingers, and by the use of the hairbrush, the 
head being then washed clean with tepid watei Should the tint imparted 
by them not be deep enough, or be too fiery, it may be darkened and 
turned on the brown or black by moistening the hair the next day with a 
very weak solution of sulphuret of potassium, or of hydrosulphuret of 
ammonia. 

None of the compounds of lead stain the skin, an advantage which 
has led to a preference being given to them hy many persons who are 
clumsy manipulators, and to the more extensive use of them than of other 
hair dyes.

The salts of silver above referred to are more rapid in their action 
as hair dyes than those containing lead. It is only necessary to wash 
the hair quite clean and free from grease, then to moisten it with a weak 
solution of one of them, and, lastly, to expose it to the light, to effect the 
object in view. Sunlight will fully darken it in a few minutes, but in 
di/Tused daylight it will take two or three hours, or longer, to acquire the 
deepest shade. To avoid this delay and inconvenience, the common 
practice is, a few minutes afier applying the silver solution, to moisten or 
wet the hair with a solution of sulphuret of potassium, or of hydrosul- 
phuret of ammonia. The effect is immediate, and the full depth of shade 
which a silver solution of the strengh employed is capable of imparting 
is at once produced. A few minutes later and the hair and skin may be 
rinsed with tepid water, gently wiped dry, and the hair finally adjusted 
with the comb. The effect of its application, its rapid action, and the 
satisfactory nature of the effect produced, all tend to render a solution of 
nitrate of silver the favorite hair dye of those who have sufficient skill and 
steadiness of hand to use it properly. 

It will be useful here to inform the inexperienced reader that all 
solutions and compounds which contain nitrate of silver stain the skin as 
well as the hair, if they be allowed to touch it. These stains may be 
removed, when quite recent, by rubbing them with a piece of rag or 
sponge wetted with a weak solution of potassium, of hydrosulphuret of 
ammonia, or of iodide of potassium ; but as this is attended with some 
trouble and ir convenience, the best way is to avoid the necessity of 
having recourse to it. The hairdressers commonly adopt the plan of 
smearing hard pomatum or cosmetique over the skin immediately sur- 
rounding the hair to be operated upon, in order to protect it from the 
dye. By very skillful manipulation, and the observance of due precau- 
tions, the hair may be thoroughly moistened with the silver solution 
without touching the adjacent skin ; but this can only be done when the 
hair of the head is under treatment by a second party. 

In reference to the tone and shades of color given by the substances 
commonly employed to dye the hair, it may be useful to state that the 
shades given by preparations of iron and bismuth range from dark brown 
to black ; those given by the salts of silver, from a fine natural chestnut to 
deep brown and black, all of which are rich and unexceptional. The 
shades given by lead vary from reddish-brown and auburn to black ; and 
when pale or when the dye has been badly applied or compounded, are 



-I

generally of a sandy, reddish hue, often far from agreeable. However, 
this tendency of the lead dyes has recently led to their extensive use to 
impart that peculiar tint to the light hair of ladies and children which is 
now so fashionable. Other substances, hereafter referred to, are, how- 
ever, preferable, as imparting a more pleasing hue. 

The reddish tint produced by lead, as already hinted, may be gener- 
ally darkened into a brown, more or less rich, by subsequently moistening 
the hair with a weak solution of either sulphuret of potassium or hydro- 
sulphuret of ammonia. 

The favoriie compounds for external use in baldness, and, perhaps, 
the most convenient and best, are such as owe their stimulating (piality 
to cantharides or Spanish flies, or to their active principle, cantharidine. 
This application of these drugs has received the sanction of the highest 
medical authorities, both in Europe and America. The leading profes- 
sional hair-restorers now rely almost exclusively on cantharides, and all 
the more celebrated advertised nostrums for restoring the hair contain it 
as their active ingredient. 

Oils and pomades, very strongly impregnated with the essential oil of 
garden thyme (origanum) and rosemary, and lotions or liniments contain- 
ing ammonia with a like addition of these essential oils, probably come 
next in the frequency of their use as popular restoratives of the hair in 
actual and incipient baldness. 

To Have Elegant Hair. — Every girl should have thick, magnificent 
hair. It is essential to clip the ends of the hair once a month after a child 
is four years of age. Ammonia and warm water is an excellent wash for 
the hail and scalp, and gives life and vigor to it when all other articles fail. 

Wild Rose Curling Fluid.— Take two drams (avoirdupois) dry 
salt of tartar ; (carbonate of potassa) powdered cochineal, half dram ; 
liquor of ammonia and spirit de rose, each one fluid dram ; glycerine, 
one fourth ounce; rectified spirit, one and one-half imperial fluid ounces ; 
distilled water, eighteen ounces ; digest with agitation for a week, and then 
decant or filter. The hair to be moistened with it, and then loosely 
adjusted. The effect occurs as it dries. 

To Cause the Hair to Grow very Thick. — One of the most 
powerful stimulants for the growth of the hair is the following : Take a 
quarter of an ounce of the chippings of alkanet root, tie in a scrap of 
coarse muslin, and suspend it in a jar containing eight ounces of sweet oil

for a week, covering it from the dust. Add to tliis sixty drops tincture 
of cantharides, ten drops oil of rose, sixty drops of neroli, and sixty drops 
oil of lemon. Let this stand twenty days, closely corked, and you will 
have one of the greatest hair-invigorators and hair-growers that this world 
has ever i)roduced. 

Lola Montez Hair Coloring. — This celebrated woman published 
the following, and claimed that it was as harmless as any preparation that 
would really color the hair : Ten grains of gallic acid, one ouncp of acetic 
acid, one ounce of tincture of sesgurichloride of iron. Dissolve the 
gallic acid, sesgurichloride, and add the acetic acid. Wash the hair 
with soap and water; when dried, apply the dye by dipping a fine comb 
in it and drawing through the hair so as to color the roots thoroughly. 
Let it dry, then oil and brush well. 

Hair Restorative. — Four drams oxide bismuth, four drams 
spermaceti, four ounces pure hog's lard. The lard and spermaceti should 
be melted together. When nearly cool, stir in the bismuth and perfume. 
Prevents the hair from turning gray, and restores gray hair. 

For Bald Heads. — A most valuable remedy for promoting the 
growth of the hair is an application, once or twice a day, of wild indigo 
and alcohol. Take four ounces of wild indigo and steep it about a week 
or ten days in a pint of alcohol and a pint of hot water, when it will be 
ready for use. The head must be thoroughly washed with the liquid, 
morning and evening, application being made with a sponge or soft brush. 

Another excellent preparation is composed of three ounces of castor 
oil, with just enough alcohol to cut the oil, to which add twenty drops 
tincture of cantharides, and perfume to suit. This not only softens and 
imparts a gloss to the hair, but also invigorates and strengthens the roots 
of t'le hair. 

Excellent Hair Wash. — Take one ounce of borax, half an ounce 
of camphor ; powder these ingredients very fine and dissolve tiiem in one 
quart boiling water. When cool the solution will be ready for use. 
Dampen the hair frequently. This wash effectually cleanses, beautifies, and 
strengthens the hair, preserves the color, and jirevents early baldness. 
The camphor will form into lumps after being dissolved, but the water 
will be sufficiently impregnated. 

To Cure Baldness. — Cologne water, two ounces ; tincture of 
cantharides, two drams ; oil of lavender or rosemary, of each ten drops.

These applications must be used twice a day for three or four weeks, but 
if the scalp becomes sore they may be discontinued for a time or used at 
longer intervals. 

When the hair falls off, from dimin'i-jhed action of the scilp, prepara- 
tions of cantharides are excellent. The following will cause the hair to 
grow faster than any other preparation : Beef marrow (soaked in several 
waters, melted and strained), half a pound ; tincture cantharides (made 
by soaking for a week one dram of powdered cantharides in one ounce of 
proof spirit), one ounce ; oil of bergamot, twelve drops. 

Stimulants for the Hair.— Vinegar and water form a good wash 
for the roots of the hair. A solution of ammonia is often used with good 
effect for the same purpose. For removing scurf, glycerine diluted with 
a little rose-water will be found of service. Any preparation of rosemary 
fonns an agreeable and highly cleansing wash. The yolk of an egg 
beaten up in warm water is a most nutritious application to the scalp. A 
very good application is made in this way : Take an ounce of powdered 
borax and a small piece of camphor and dissolve in a quart of boiling 
water. The hair must afterwards be washed in warm water. Many 
heads of hair require nothing more in the way of wash than soap and 
water. The following recipe will strengthen the hair and prevent its 
falling out : Vinegar of cantharides, half an ounce ; eau de cologne, one 
ounce ; rose-water, one ounce. The scalp should be brushed briskly 
until it becomes red, and the lotion should then be applied to the roots of 
the hair twice a day. 

The Golden Hair Secret. — The rage for light, gold color, or 
even red hair, which has prevailed for some time, has led to various 
expedients for procuring it. Many ladies have sacrificed fine heads of 
hair, and in place of their own dark tresses have adopted light wigs ; but 
the prevailing absurdity has been the use of strong alkalies for the purpose 
of turning dark hair light. This is the purpose of the ausicomus fluid, 
which may be procured of any hairdresser ; but we warn our fair readers 
that the use of these products is apt to be disappointing. They certainly 
will tur/i black to a brick-dust hue, but the color is often disagreeable. 
It is apt to present itself in patches in different hues, and the effect on 
the hair is terrible — it often rots and crumbles away. In place of this 
absurd practice, we recommend the following as available for trying the 
effect for dress purpose : Procure a packet of gold powder of the hair- 
dresser. Have ready a very weak solution of gum and water, and one of

the small perfume vaporizers now in use. When the hair has been 
dressed, sprinkle it with gum and water by means of the vaporizer and 
then shower on the gold powder. It may be put on thick enough to 
hide the color of the hair, and owing to the gum it cannot be danced off. 
The effect by artificial liglu is beautiful. 

For Keeping the Hair Crimped or Curled in Summer. — 

A quarter of an ounce of gum tragacanth, one pint rose-water, and five 
drops of glycerine ; mix and let stand over night. If the tragacanth is 
not dissolved, let it remain half a day longer ; if it is thick add more 
rose-water and let it remain for some hours. If then it is a smooth 
solution, nearly as thin as glycerine, it is fit for use. Dampen the hair 
before crimping or curling. 

To Bleach the Hair. — It has been found in the bleaching of hair 
that gaseous chlorine is the most effectual. The hair should be cleaned 
for that purpose by a warm solution of soda and washed afterwards with 
water. While moist it is put into a jar with chlorine gas introduced 
until the air in the jar looks greenish. Allow it to remain on for 
twenty-four hours, and then, if necessary, repeat the operation. 

A New French Remedy for Baldness.— Croton oil, one of the 
best French remedies for baldness, is employed by simply adding to it 
oil or pomade, and stirring or agitating the two together until admixture 
or solution is complete. The formula adopted by the eminent French 
physician who introduced this remedy, and who speaks in the most 
confident and enthusiastic way of the success attending its use, is : 
Take croton oil, twelve drops (minims) ; oil of almonds, four troy grains. 
Mix. A little is to be well rubbed on the scalp twice a day. Soft down, 
we are assured, appears in three weeks. 

For Improving the Hair. — Palma Christi oil for thickening the 
hair: Take one ounce of I'alma Christi oil, add oil of lavender or 
bergamot to scent it. Let it be well brushed into the hair for two or 
three months, particularly applying it to those parts where it may be most 
desirable to render the hair luxuriant. This is a simple and valuable oil, 
and not in the hands of any monopolist. 

To Dye the Hair Flaxen. — We have heard the following is 
effective : Take a quart of lye prepared from the ashes of vine twigs, 
briony, celandine roots, and tumeric, of each half an ounce ; saffron and 
lily roots, of each two drams ; flowers of mullein, yellow stechas, broom,

and St. John's wort, of each a dram. Boil these together and strain ofT 
the h'qiior clear. Frequently wash tiie hair with the fluid, and it will 
change it, we are told, in a short time to a beautiful flaxen color. 

A Powder for Preserving the Hair. — The following powder 
has the name of facilitating the regeneration of the hair and strengthen- 
ing its roots. Still more valuable properties have been ascribed to it, 
such as that of rousing the imagination to vigorous eff'orts and strength- 
ening the memory — delightful properties if they could be realized by such 
simple means. 'I'ake an ounce and a half of red roses; a small quantity 
each of calamus, aromaticus (sweet scented flag), and of the long 
cyperus ; an ounce of benzoin; six drams of aloes (the wood of) ; half 
an ounce of red coral, and the same (juantity of amber; four ounces of 
bean flour ; and eight ounces of the root of Florentine iris. Let the 
wliule be mixed togellier and reduced to a very tine powder, to which 
add a few grains of musk. This powder is to be sprinkled on the hair in 
the same manner as hair powder is generally used, and, having remained 
for a time embedded with the hair, to be removed by means of comb and 
brush ; and to be occasionally applied and removed. It is said to 
regenerate the hair and strengthen the roots, and to i)ossess the properties 
which are above enumerated. 

To Make the Hair Grow and to Prevent It from Falling.— 

'J'lie following recipes are selected from a work published some years 
ago in Paris, entitled " Manuel Cosnietique des Plantes " : — 

Take the roots of young vines, the roots of hemp, and young 
cabbages, of each two handfuls. Dry, and then burn them. Make after- 
wards a lye with the ashes. Before the head is washed with this lye it 
must be rubbed with honey, and continue both for three successive days. 
This will not only make the hair grow, but restore it upon bald places, 
under certain habits and constitutions of body. Pulverize some parsley 
seed, and use it as hair powder for three nights at the commencement of 
the year, and it will prevent your hair from falling. 

To Make the Hair Grow Quick.— Dip, every morning 
of your comb in the juice of nettles, and comb the hair r><i»<n- 

Mixture for Shampoo. — Bay rum, one pint icture can 
tharides, one dram ; carbonate of ammonia, one half diani ; sa' tartar, 
one half dram. Mix.

To Prevent the Hair Falling Out.— Boxwood shavings, six 
ounces ; proof spirit, twelve ounces ; spirits of rosemary, two ounces ; 
spirits of nutmeg, one half ounce. Mix. 

Wash for Scald Heads.— Take one half ounce of sulphate of 
potassa, one pint of lime water, one ounce of soap liniment. Mix, and

POWDERS AND THEIR USES. 

The powders usually sold by druggists are injurious to the complex- 
ion, owing to harmful ingredients. If a powder is perfectly pure, a 
moderate use of it will not harm the complexion, but if it is impure it 
soon causes the face to turn sallow and yellow. The following is per- 
fectly pure, and is a splendid article, giving a lovely, retined complexion: — 

Boston Burnet Powder for the Face.— Five cents' worth of 
bay rum, five cents' worih of magnesia snowflake, five cents' worth of 
bergamot, five cents' worth oil of lemon ; mix in a pint bottle and fill up 
with rain water. Perfectly harmless, and splendid. 

Queen Bess Complexion Wash. — Put in a vial one dram of 
benzoin gum in i)owder, one dram nutmeg oil, six drops of orange-blos- 
som tea or apple blossoms ; put in half a' pint of rain water, and boiled 
down to a spoonful, and strained ; one pint of sherry wine. Bathe the 
face morning and night ; it will remove all flesh-worms and freckles, and 
give a beautiful complexion. Or, put one ounce of powdered gum benzoin 
in a pint of whisky. To use : Put in water in washbowl till it is milky. 

FLESH -WORMS -TO CURE. 

Black specks on the nose disfigure the face. Remove by washing 
thoroughly in tepid water, rubbing with a towel, and applying with a soft 
flannel a lotion made of three ounces of cologne and half an ounce of 
liquor of potash. 

TO WHITEN THE SKIN AND REMOVE FRECKLES 

AND TAN. 

Bathe three times a day in a preparation of three quarts water, one 
quart alcohol, two ounces of cologne and one of borax, in proportion of 
two teaspoons mixture to two tablespoons soft water.

TREATING OF MISCELLANEOUS MATTERS. 

The Human Tempe*'aments. — By these are meant certain types, 
forms or conformations of the human body, each known and distin- 
guished from the other by certain characteristics, which enable those who 
are familiar with these peculiarities to readily distinguish one tempera- 
ment from the others. The existence of the temperaments is believed to 
depend upon the development of certain parts or systems in the body, 
and each is accompanied by different degrees of activity of the brain, 
and corresponding difference in the talents and manifestations of the 
individual. They are four in number, viz.: Nervous, Sanguine, Bilious, 
and Lymphatic. When the brain and nerves are predominant, it is 
termed the nervous temperament ; if the lungs and blood vessels consti- 
t'..tionally predominate, the sanguine ; if the muscular and fibrous systems 
are in the ascendency, the bilious ; and when the glands and assimilating 
organs are in the ascendency, it is termed the lymphatic ox phlegmatic. 

First : The nervous is indicated by fine, thin hair, small muscles, 
thin skin, pale countenance, brilliant eyes, with great quickness and 
sensitiveness to impressions, and is really the mental or intellectual 
temperament. 

Second : The sanguine is known by a stout, well-defined form, a full 
face, florid complexion, moderate plumpness, firm flesh, chestnut or sandy 
iiair, and blue eyes. This is the tough, hardy, wo'-king temperament, 
excessively fond of exercise and activity, and a great aversion to muscu- 
lar quiescence and inactivity, and consequently averse to books and close 
literary pursuits. 

Third : The bilious is indicated by a thin, spare face, dark skin, 
black hair, firm flesh, moderate stoutness, with rough, harsh, and strongly 
marked features. This temperamei, gives great will, elasticity, and 
powers of endurance, and, when combined with the nervous, is the great, 
efficient, moving temperament in the great events of the world. 

Fourth : The lymphatic is indicated by paleness, roundness of the 
form, softness of muscle, fair hair, sleepy, half-closed eyes, and a dull, 
sluggish, inexpressive face. In this temperament the brain and all other

parts of the body appear to be slow, dull, and languid, and the whole 
body little else than one great manufactory of fat. These temperaments, 
however, are rarely found pure, but mixed or blended in an almost end- 
less variety of ways, producing the ever-varying peculiarities of human 
charactei and intellect.

A child born on Sunday shall be of long life and obtain riches. 

A child born on Monday will be weak and effeminate. 

Tuesday is more unfortunate still, though a child born on this day 
may, by extraordinary vigilance, conquer the inordinate desires to which 
he will be subject ; still, in his violent attempts to gratify them, he will 
be in danger of a violent death. 

The child born on Wednesday will be given to a studious life, and 
shall reap great profit therefrom. 

A child born on Thursday shall attain great honor and dignity. 

He who calls Friday his natal day shall be of a strong constitution,

IMPORTANT ADVICE TO FEMALES. 

It has often been observed, and experience has shown the observa- 
tion to be a true one, that some event of importance is sure to happen to 
a woman in her thirty-first year, whether it prove for her good or it be 
some evil or temptation ; therefore we advise her to be circumspect in 
all her actions. If she is a maiden or widow, it is probable she will marry 
this year. If a wife, that she will lose her children or husband. She will 
either receive riches or travel into a foreign land; at all events, some 
circumstance or other will take place during this remarkable year of her 
life that will have great effect on her future fortunes and existence. 

THE MAGIC RING. 
To know whom you will marry, and what kind of a fate 
you will have with them. — Borrow a wedding ring, concealing the 
purpose for which you borrow it ; but no widow's or pretended marriage 
ring will do — it spoils the charm ; wear it for three hours at ieast before 
you retire to rest, and then suspend it, by a Iiair off your head, over your 
pillow ; write within a circle resembling a ring, the sentence fro.ii the 
matrimonial service beginning with,"?^////! this ring I thee wed" and n.mnd 
the circle write your own name at full length, and the figures that stand 
for your age ; place it under your pillow, and your dream will fully explain 
whom you are to marry, and what kind of a fiite you will have with them. 
If your dream is too confused to remember it, or you do not dream at all, 
it is a certain sign that you will nevci be married.

PHYSIOGNOMICAL SIGNS OF A GOOD GENIUS. 

A straight, erect body, neither over tall nor short, between fat and 
thin. The flesh naturally soft. The skin neither soft nor rough, but a 
medium between. The complexion white, verging to a blush of redness. 
The hair between hard and soft, usually of a brown color. The head and 
face of a moderate size. The forehead rather high. The eyes manly, 
big, and clear, of a blue or hazel color. The aspect mild and humane. 
The teeth so mixed that some are broad and some narrow. A subtle 
tongue, and the voice between intense and remiss. The neck comely and 
smooth. The channel-bone of the throat appearing and moving. The 
back and ribs not over fleshy. The shoulders plain and slender. The 
hands indifferently long and smooth. The fingers long, smooth, and 
equally distant. The nails white, mixed with red, and shining. The 
carriage of the body erect in walking. 



ELECTRICAL PSYCHOLOGY, OR PSYCHOLOGICAL 
FASCINATION. 

The most easy, sure and direct mode to produce electro-psychological 
communication is to take the individual by the hand, in the same manner 
as though you were going to shake hands. Press your thumb with moderate 
force upon the ulnar nerve, which spreads its branches to the ring and 
little finger. The pressure should be nearly one inch above the knuckle, 
and in range of the ring finger. Lay the ball of the thumb flat and par- 
ticularly crosswise so as to cover the minute branches of this nerve of 
motion and sensation. When you first take your subject by the hand, 
request him to place his eyes upon yours, and to keep them fixed, so that 
he may see every emotion of your mind expressed in the countenance. 
Continue this pressure for half a minute or more, then request him to close 
his eyes, and with your fingers gently brush downward several times over 
the eyelids, as though fastening them firmly together. Throughout the 
whole process feel within yourself a fixed determination to close them, so 
as to express that determination fully in your countenance and manner. 
Having done this, place your hand on the top of his head and press your 
thumb firmly on the organ of individuality, bearing partially downward, 
and with the other thumb still pressing the ulnar nerve, tell him. You 
cannot open your eyes ! Remember that your manner, your expression 
of countenance, your motions, and your language must all be of the same 
positive character. If he succeed in opening his eyes, try it once or twice 



70 



THE ladies' book 



more, because impressions, whether physical or mental, continue to deepen 
by repetition. In case, however, that you cannot close his eyes, nor see 
any effect produced upon them, you should cease making any further 
efforts, because you have now fairly tested that his mind and body both 
stand in a positive relation as regards the doctrine of impressions. If 
you succeed in closing the subject's eyes by the above mode, you may 
then request him to put his hands on his head, or in any other position 
you choose, and tell him, Vou cannot stir them ! In case you succeed, 
request him to be seated, and tell him, You cannot rise ! If you are suc- 
cessful in this, request him to put his hands in motion, and tell him, Yoti 
cannot stop them ! If you succeed, request him to walk on the floor, and 
tell him. You cannot cease walking ! As so you may continue to perform 
experiments, involving muscular motion and paralysis of any kind that 
may recur to your mind, till you can completely control him in arresting 
or moving all the voluntary parts of his system. 



r 



MESMERISM. 

If you desire to mesmerize a person, who has never been put in that 
state, nor in the least affected, the plan is to set him in an easy posture 
and request him to be calm and resigned. Take him by both hands, or 
else by one hand and place your other gently on his forehead. But with 
whatever part of his body you choose to come in contact, be sure to always 
touch two points, answering to the positive and negative forces. Having 
taken him by both hands, fix your eyes upon his, and, if possible, let him 
contentedly and steadily look you in the face. Remain in this position 
until his eyes close. Then place both your hands on his head, gently 
pass them to his shoulders, down the arms, and off at the ends of his 
fingers. Throw your hands outward as you return them to his head, and 
continue these passes till he can hear no voice but yours. He is then 
entirely in the mesmeric state. When a person is in the mesmeric state, 
whether put there by yourself or someone else, you can awake him by the 
upward passes, or else do it by an impression, as follows : Tell him, 
" I will count three, and at the same instant I say three I will slap my 
hands together, and you will be wide awake and in your perfect senses. 
Are you ready ? " If he answers in i affirmative, you will proceed to 
count " One, two, three ! " The word three should be spoken suddenly, 
It yn a very loud voice, and at the same instant the palms of the hands 
it is \ be smitten together. This will instantly awake him.

HOW TO MAKE PERSONS AT A DISTANCE 
THINK OF YOU. 

Let it be particularly remembered that *' faith " and concentration of 
thought are positively needful to accomplish aught in drawing others to you, 
or making them think of you. If you have not the capacity or under- 
standing to operate an electric telegraph battery, it is no proof that an 
expert and competent person should fail in doing so. Just so in this 
case ; if faith, meditation, or concentration of thought fail you, then will 
you also fail to operate on others. First, you must have a yearning for 
the person you wish to make think of you ; and, secondly, you must learn 
to guess at what time of day or night he may be unemployed — passive — 
so that he may be in a proper state to receive the thought which you 
dispatch to him. If he should be occupied in any way, so that his 
nervous forces were needed to complete his task, his " human battery," or 
thought, would not be in a recipient or passive condition, therefore your 
experiment would fail at that moment. Or, if he were under heavy 
narcotics, liquors, tobacco, or gluttonous influences, he could not be 
reached at such moments. Or, if he were asleep, and you operated to 
effect a wakeful mind or thought, you would fail again at the moment. 
To make a person at a distance think of you (whether you are acquainted 
with him or not, matters not), I again repeat, find out or guess at what 
moment he is likely to be passive — by this I mean easy and careless ; 
then, with the most fervent prayer or yearning of your entire heart, mind, 
soul, and strength, desire he may think of you. And if you wish him to 
think on any particular topic in relation to you, it is necessary for you to 
press your hands, when operating on him, on such mental faculties of 
your head as you wish him to exercise towards you. This demands a 
meager knowledge of Phrenology. His " feeling nature," or " propen- 
sities," you cannot reach through these operations, but when he thinks of 
you (if he does not know you, he imagines such a being as you are) he 
can easily afterwards be controlled by you, and he will feel disposed to 
go in the direction where you are, if circumstances permit and he is his 
own master, for, remember, circumstances alter cases. I said you cannot 
reach his "feeling," but only his "thinking," nature, truly, but after he 
thinks of you once his " feeling nature," or propensities, may become 
aroused through his own organization. In conclusion on this topic, let 
me say that if you wish the person simply to think of you, one operation 
may answer ; but, on the contrary, if you wish him to meet you /^"^^ 
where you are, all you have to do is to persevere, in a lawful and Ctwice 



72 



THE LADIES BOOK 



manner, to operate, and I assure you, in the course of all natural things — 
that is, if no accident or very unfavorable circumstances occur — he will 
make his way towards you, and when he comes within sight, or reaching 
distance of you, it will be easy to manage him.

HOW TO CHARM THOSE WHOM YOU MEET AND 

LOVE. 

When you desire to make any one "love" you with whom you meet, 
although not personally acquainted with him, you can very readily reach him 
and make his acquaintance, if you observe Ihe foregoing instructions in addi- 
tion to the following directions : Suppoiie you see him coming towards 
you, in an unoccupied mood, or recklessly or passively walking past 
you, all that remains for you at that moment is to concentrate your 
thought, and send it into him as before explained, and, to your astonish- 
ment, if he was passive, he will look at you, and now is your time to 
send a thrill to his heart, by looking him carelessly, though determinately, 
in the eyes, and praying him, with all your heart, mind, soul, and strength, 
that he may read your thought and receive your true love, which God 
designs we should bear one another. This accomplished, and you need 
not, and must not, wait for a cold-hearted, fashionable, and popular 
Christian introduction; neither should you hastily run into his arms, but 
continue operating in this psychological manner, not losing any con- 
venient opportunity to meet him at an appropriate place, when an unem- 
barrassed exchange of words will open the door to the one so magnitized. 
At this interviev/, unless prudence sanction it, do not shake hands, but 
let your manners and loving eyes speak with Christian charity and ease. 
Wherever or whenever you meet again, at the first opportunity grasp his 
hand in an earnest, sincere, and affectionate manner, observing at the 
same time the following important directions, viz.: As you take his bare 
hand in yours, press your thumb gently, through firmly, between the bones 
of the thumb and the forefinger of his hand, and at the very instant when 
you press thus on the blood vessels (which you can before ascertain to 
pulsate) look him earnestly and lovingly in the eves, and send all your 
heart's, mind's, and soul's strength into his organization, and he will be 
your friend, and if you find him not to be congenial, you have him in your 
power, and by carefully guarding against evil influences, you can reform 
him to suit your own purified, Christian, and loving taste.

CHAPTER III. 



A SPECIAL CHAPTER FOR YOUNG WOMEN. 



1 






MARRIAGE. 

Advice upon this subject is very much needed. I am assured 
that it is a subject not often talked of in families — at least, as it ought 
to be — nor is it much alluded to in the pulpit, and the result is 
that young people commonly get their notions about it from those only a 
little older than themselves, and who therefore know but little more than 
they do, or from those who form their opinions from the abuse they see 
of it and so hold degrading and unworthy ideas respecting it. Sometimes 
all that is known about it amounts to this, that it is a delightful thing to 
be married. 

It is quite true that it often is, and always ought to be, delightful ; 
still, you know it is frequently the reverse. You cannot, then, be too 
cautious in the matter. 

Nothing can be more orderly, right, proper, and holy than marriage. 
It is not, however, quite so simple an affair as you may faicy. Hvery 
good thing (and this is one of the best) requires some effort to obta d it, 
and unless you take the right course you must not expect to succeed. 

You may often see a young woman who, from not enterlai in>^' 
correct views on the point, is certainly taking a wrong course, her 
endeavors being rather to make what she considers a good match than 
by acquiring kind and orderly habits to qualify herself to become worthy 
of a worthy husband. 

That the best things are liable to the greatest abuses is notorious, 
and from the lamentable fact that marriage is often abused we may fairly 
infer its pre-eminent worth. In truth, there is nothing more valuable. It 
is, then, highly injurious to entertain low notions respecting it, and men 
who indulge in loose conversation on the subject are likely at the same 
time to think meanly of women. Beware of them, and if you hear them 
expressing such opinions in your presence, withdraw from them at once as 
unworthy of your company. Never fear but they will respect you the 
more for the rebuke. 









74 



THE ladies' book 



Of course you are looking forward to settling happily, and will do 
your best for that purpose. On this let me remark that all happiness 
(that is, all that is genuine, and therefore worthy of the name) comes from 
connection with the one great source of all good, and He has freely and 
fully provided all the means necessary for our being happy, both here 
and hereafter. He has placed each of us where it is best for us to be, 
and in the circumstances that are best for us at the time, and this applies 
to you and to me now. Howsoever much appearances may be to the 
contrary, He cares as much for each of us as if we were the sole objects 
of His care. It is only by doing our duty in humble dependence on His 
assistance, which He never withholds, that we can be happy. It behooves 
you, then, to consider well what is your duty, in order that you may do it 
and may enjoy the blessings He is so ready to bestow. I hope you may 
have been a loving and dutiful daughter, an affectionate sister, and a 
faithful friend ; then you may have good ground of hope for the future. 



I 



WHEN A PROSPECT OF MARRIAGE 



occurs you cannot do better than consult your mother, aunt, or other 
discreet relative that has your welfare at heart, from whom you may 
reasonably expect the best and most disinterested advice ; and this it 
will be well for you to be guided by. Women of mature years can judge 
far better than you whether a man is likely to make a good husband. 
You should likewise quietly and cautiously make your own observations 
among your married acquaintances, especially where you believe there is 
a comfortable and happy home. You will doubtless find that to a very 
great extent this happy home depends on the wife's management and 
economy. Very often it happens that when two husbands have the same 
income, with the same number of children, there will be comfort in the 
one home and discomfort in the other. Now, there must be a reason for 
this, and you should endeavor to find it out and profit by the lesson. It 
is said " Cleanliness is next to godliness," and truly the value of clean- 
liness cannot be overrated. In point of time, it should go before 
godliness, for where there is not cleanliness there can hardly be godliness ; 
and the health of body and mind are greatly dependent on these two. 
Moreover, where can there be complete happiness without health ? 

One of the most prolific sources of matrimonial difficulties is the lack 
of knowledge on the part of wives of the duties of housekeeping. In these

days there are a hundred young ladies who can drum on the piano to one 
who can make a good loaf of bread. 

YET A HUNGRY HUSBAND 

cares more for a good dinner than he does — as long as his appetite is 
unappeased — to listen to the music of the spheres. Heavy bread has 
made many heavy hearts, given rise to dyspepsia — horrid dyspepsia — and 
its herd of accompanying torments. Girls who desire that their husbands 
should be amiable and kind, should learn how to make good bread. 
When a young man is courting, he can live well at home ; or, if he has to 
go a distance to pay his addresses, he usually obtains good meals at an 
hotel or an eating-house ; but when he is married and gets to house- 
keeping, his wife assumes the functions of his mother or his landlord, and 
it is fortunate for her if she has been educated so as to know what a good 
table is. Those who are entirely dependent upon hired cooks make a 
very poor show at housekeeping. The stomach performs a very imi)or- 
tant part in the economy of humanly, and wives who are forgetful of this 
fact commit a serious mistake. 

You know full well that most young men — and most young women, 
too — are desirous of marrying and having a family ; but they do not 
sufficiently consider that it is God who gives them this desire, and that for 
the wisest of purposes j not only that this world may be peopled, but also 
that its inhabitants may be prepared for heaven. 

Nothing is more certain than that

the fairest opportunities for preparing for a better world. In it we have 
others dearer than ourselves to think about and provide for ; and in doing 
so, we have often to practice that very useful virtue, self-denial. Let me 
here impress upon you most deeply, that it is only by making others 
happy that we can become happy ourselves. The angels, we may be 
assured, are happy, because they are always actively good ; and for a 
similar reason it is that God himself is infinitely happy. If you try to 
secure you own happiness by any other means than a faithful discharge of 
your duty to God and your neighbor, you will certainly fail.

I dare say you will find that 

YOUNG MEN ARE FOND OF YOUR COMPANY, 

and of paying you every polite attention, and you, as a right-minded 
woman, are well pleased to be so treated. It is due to you as a nioman. 
Now, each of them is, or ought to be, looking out for a wife, and it is well 
that you should know this. It is, too, more important than you perhaps 
are aware, that you should be carefully making your own observations, so 
that when the time arrives for one of them to ask you to become his wife 
you may not be taken by surprise, but may know how to act on the 
occasion. 

Let me caution you here against a failing that is common among 
young women. I mean that of making themselves too cheap. They feel 
flattered by the attentions paid to them, and are not sufficiently aware 
that many young men are fond of indulging in flattery ; and such, if they 
find a young woman weak enough to be pleased with it, will perhaps piay 
upon her feelings and gain her affections without having any honorable 
intentions towards her. 

As a protection against such, I recommend you to have a proper 
respect for yoursei and to consider with what object or purpose you 
receive their attentions. If you respond without an object, you may be 
doing them wrong ; if you accept them when they have no right intentions, 
you allow them to wrong you. For this purpose consider well what you 
are — a human being intended for an eternity of bliss. God has made you 
a woman ; and, believe me, as there is no fairer, so there is no nobler 
creature than woman. She is formed to be her husband's helpmate and 
the mother of his children, and the all-important work of training these 
for heaven depends mainly upod her. Clreat, then, is her responsibility ; 
but God has given her the requisite love and power to do her duty with 
satisfaction and delight. He has placed you in this beautiful world that 
by doing your duty as a daughter, sister, wife, mother, and friend, you may 
become fitted to enter His heavenly kingdom. 

During your courtship let me entreat you to be very careful and 
circumspect. There is no period of life that can compare with this 
delightful season. It is, or should be, full of sunshine and sparkling with 
the poetry of life ; but alas ! to many it is the opposite. A want of judg- 
ment — a momentary indiscretion — has not only blotted out this beautiful 
springtime of life, but has marred, darkened, and blighted the whole of 
the after lifetime.

No maiden can, under any circumstances, i)lace her character in the 
hands of any man before marri. No matter how sincere the love, 

how ardent the protestations, how earnest or plausible the pleadings, you 
must not, you cannot, surrender your honor. You must preserve your 
prudence and virtue ; it is only by possession of these that you can keep 

THE LOVE AND RESPECT OF YOUR LOVER. 

Be firm, be circumspect ; a rash word or a fals*^ step may extinguish 
forever all your bright hojies and ])rospective joys. Even should your 
lover redeem his promises and take you to be his wife, this indiscretion, or 
crime, will surely hang over you like a curse, creating discord, trouble, 
and sorrow, the greatest portion of which will fall to your share. 

You must know that young men, however amiable, wor^ihy or honor- 
able they may be, may, in a moment of intense excitement, commit a sin 
that in their calmer moments they would not be guilty of for worlds. 

But under all circumstances you will be looked upon to resist any 
advances, and maintain your purity and virtue. No matter how high the 
tide of i)assion may run in unguarded moments, and set in against heaven 
and against society, the terrible and painful ebb will surely follow and 
leave you stranded forever on the bleak and barren shore of your earthly 
existence. 



THERE IS NO STATE OF LIFE MORE HONORABLE, 

useful, and happy than that of a wife and mother. There must and ever 
will be inequalities of station, but happiness is equally attainable in them 
all. To be happy, however, you must be good. Of course, I do not 
mean absolutely good, for " there is none good but One " ; but I mean 
that you should be relatively good, and should aim at becoming better 
and more innocent as you advance in life. Now, you cannot respect 
yourself unless you know that you are worthy of respect ; and if you 
do not respect yourself, you cannot expect that anybody else will ; and in 
such case you will not be worthy of the love of any good man, and none 
such will be likely to pay court to you. If, however, you take the right 
means, in which I include prayer for divine guid.ince, you will have the 
respect and friendship of all your acquaintances, and then in God's own 
time, and, let me add, without your seeking it, the man whom you can 
make happy will present himself and propose to make you his wife, if it 
be God's will that you should become one.

Here are two very important i)oints for your consideration : First, 
that it should be your constant endeavor to

!i I 



MAKE YOUR HUSBAND HAPPY; 

and, second, that before you consent to marry him, you should ascertain 
that he has tliose qualifications that will secure your iiappiness. It most 
nearly concerns yourself that you do your duty to God and your neigh- 
bor at all times, so that it beconT^s your habit ; and you will find it much 
easier, and safer, too, to do it every day rather than on only particular 
occasions ; for this would require a special effort, and for the time, per- 
haps, put you into a state of excitement, which, in all probability, would 
be followed by a depression of spirits. What you should rather aim at 
is a uniformly cheerful state of mind, resulting from a conscious and 
confident dependence on Providence. If your husband knows from 
experience that sucii is your character, he cannot fail, provided he be 
worthy of you, to be content and happy. 



IT IS THE NATURE OF YOUNG WOMEN 

to be alTectionate, and it is pleasant and usual for them to have several 
dear friends, enjoying more or less of their confidence. Among these 
may be included some of their male acquaintance. Now, while they may 
esteem each of these as they would a dear cousin, they should know and 
act upon the knowledge tiiat it is only to o/ie they can give their unlimited 
confidence and individual affection as a wife. It is the height of cruelty 
and wickedness for either a man or a woman to trifle with another's 
affection. Such base conduct has cost many a young womaw her health 
and peace, and even her life, and cannot, therefore, be too much depre- 
ciated and avoided. 

Let me, then, advise you to be 

VERY CAUTIOUS 

before you allow a young man to pay you such marked attentions as may 
lead to marriage. It is not, you know, to terminate in seven years, like 
an apprenticeship or a commercial partnership, but it is an engagement 
for the life of one of the parties. I want you, then, to profit by the 
experience of others, too many of whom enter into marriage from light 
and low considerations, and not to settle in life till you, and also your

friends, see tliat there is a reasonable prospect of your securing happiness, 
as well as comfort and a respectable position. 

When a young woman has property or expects it, or is possessed of 
superior personal attractions, she should be especially prudent in her 
conduct towards the numerous admirers which such (pialifications usually 
attract. No woman should allow herself to accept the attentions of any 
man who does not i)ossess those sterling qualities which will command 
her respect, or whose love is directed to her fortune or beauty rather than 
herself. On such a one she can place no reliance, for should illness or 
misfortune overtake her she may find herself deprived of that love which 
she had valued as the great treasure of her life. Possessed of this, she 
feels that earthly riches are but of secondary importance, and that the 
want of them can never make her poor. 

Moreover, a worthier man than any of her interested suitors may 
have a sincere respect and affection for her, but be kept in the back- 
ground by the overzealous attention of his rivals. Still, if she has 
sufficient self-command to patiently and calmly investigate their general 
private character, she may find reason to decline their suit, and may 
discover that the more modest and retiring youth is the one that is 
deserving of her love. 

While on this subject, let me caution you against the foolish affecta- 
tion which some girls j)ractice in order to attract the attention of young 
men. In their company be natural in your manners, open and friendly 
and ready to converse on general subjects ; not appearing to expect that 
every one who pays you the ordinary courtesies of society is going to fall 
in love with you. This mode of behavior, which is more common with 
those who are vain of their beauty than with others, frequently leads to 
such young women being more neglected than their less pretending 
sisters ; for prudent young men, who are impressed with the necessity of 
a right decision in the all-important step of marriage, instinctively shrink 
from those who seem unwilling to give them a fair opportunity of judging 
whether their hearts and minds are as attractive as their persons. 

You may innocently admire many a young man for the noble 
qualities God has bestowed upon him, without at all entertaining the idea 
either that he would make you happy as his wife, or you hiia as your 
husband. Thank God we are constituted of such different temperaments 
that all may find suitable partners without clashing with each other's 
tastes, if they will only be content to watch and wait.

It is the part of a young man to watch, to be actively desirous of 
meeting with a suitable partner. In doing this, his first consideration 
should be to seek for such a one as he can make happy ; not to look 
primarily for beauty, fortune, wit, or accomplishments — things '11 very 
[,ood in themselves, but by no means constituting the essentials of happi- 
ness. If he is influenced by pure and simple motives, he will not find, or 
expect to find, more than one that can satisfy his desire, and he will not 
be in much danger of exciting the envy or the rivalry of his companions. 

Cn the other hand, it is becoming in a young woman to 

WAIT PATIENTLY 

till, from the assidu')us and respectful attentioi s of a young man, she can 
h?.ve no doubt that he is in earnest, when, and not before, she may freely 
give him her company, and with every v^xpertation of a happy result. 
Be assured that no sensible young man is ever attracted by a young 
woman whom he sees on the lookout for a lover ; he is more likely to 
think meanly of her, and to avoid her society. 

It may, however, happen that a young man makes the offer before 
the young woman knows "nough of him for it to be right fov ner to 
accept it, and before he, on his part, ought to take the step. In such 
case it would b: well for her, even supposing she is inclined to like him, 
to tell him that he has taken her by surprise, and that sne cannot think 
of entering on so important a subject without consultin,'^ her friends, to 
whom she accordingly refers him. It would then become her duty to 
in'timate to him that, although his attentions are agreeable to them, he 
must wait a while, till, from further acquaintance, they are enabled to 
judge whether it will conduce to the mutual happiness of their daughter and 
himself for her to accept the offer he has so kindly made. 

But it is not only young men who 

ARE APT TO BE HASTY 

in the?e matters. It it as is well known, not uncommon for parents, 
especially mothers, very soon after a young man has begun to pay atten- 
tion to their daughter, to give him to understand that they wish to know 
his intentions in reference to her. By such proceedings a young man may 
be taken ab'-ck, ...nd either hurry into a match, which turns out unhappily, or 
be; led to wiil)draw from a union which might liave resulted in the happi- 
ness of all the parties concerned.

That your parents shotild wish you to be married is only natural, 
especially if iheir own marriage has been a happy one. It will be gratify- 
ing to them to see a worthy young man paying attention to you, and 
most ])roI)ably they will let things take their own course. Marriage is 
too important a matter to admit of being hastened. 

There are, I am aware, unwise par nts, who, from various motives, 
will throw obstacles in the way of young people who are desirous of 
coming together. Some are so selfish as to be unwilling to part with 
their daughter, preft-rring their own happiness to hers. Others are so 
silly as to think no ordinary man good enough for her, and therefore, if 
they had iheir own way, would have her to become an old maid. 
Fortunately, sue! shortsighted peoi)le are not infrequently outwitted. 

If your jiarents are, as I hope they are, reasonable in their views and 
expectation-:, one of the chief concerns of their life will be the promotion 
of your happiness, and it behooves you to pay the utmost deference to 
their opinion ; and should they, from circumstances they become aware 
of, dtem it advisable that you should either postpone or even break off 
an engagement, they will doubtless give you such weighty reasons as will 
justify you in acting on their advice. Where, however, as sometimes 
happens, they unwisely refuse their consent to their child's marriage at a 
time when she well knows from her own feelings, and also from the 
sanction she receives from the opinion of trustworthy and judicious 
friends, that she would be making a real sacrifice were she to comply 
with their wishes ; if, I say, under such circumstances siie acts di.s- 
obediently and marries the man she loves, more blame attaches to the 
parents than to herself, and the sooner they forgive her tiie better. 

It is very common for young men, when going into the company of 
young woman, together with their best dress to put on their best 
behavior ; in fact, to assume a character which is not their natural one, 
but far superior to it. , 

Some hold th" opinion that 

"ALL IS FAIR IN LOVE AND WAR." 



To me it appears there cannot be greater folly and wickedness than 
for young people who are thinking of marrying to attempt to deceive 
each other. What is the good of it ? A very short period of married 
life will entirely dispel the illusion. I suppose people of the world may 



It 



l[

THE ladies' book 



i; I. 



think it fair to overreach one another in their dealings, saying " everyone 
for himself." They have no intention of seeking to promote the other's 
happiness ; present gain is all they want. But a married pair, to be 
happy, must 

RESPECT AND ESTEEM, AS WELL AS LOVE, 

each other; and this cannot be attained except by the constant endeavor 
to ife as well as to appear true and good. 

That young men should behave well in the presence of women is 
only natural and right ; none but a fool would do otherwise. But you, 
long before thinking of marrying, should take all fair means to learn what 
is the general conduct and habits of your male acquaintance in their 
family circle and with their daily connections. " Are they good-humored 
and kind — able to bear the troubles they meet with ? Are they indus- 
trious, frugal, temperate, religious, chaste ? Have they had the prudence 
to insure against sickness and death ? " Or, on the other hand, are they 
addicted to drinking, smoking, betting, keeping late hours, frequenting 
casinos, etc.? Your mother and other prudent friends will assist you to 
find this out. Those who do not come up to the proper standard, how- 
ever agreeable they may be as acquaintance, certaikily cannot make good 
husbands. In company of such, it behooves you to be well on your guard, 
and accept no attention /rom them. Should you marry such a one, you 
would be sure to be miserable. 

While, however, it is quite right that you should be careful about the 
character of the young man who is paying court to you, it is of far more 
importance to you that you should be careful about your own, and this 
whether you marry or not, Indeed, a chief object in our being placed in 
this world is that we may acquire good habits, and so be fitted to associ- 
ate with the just made perfect in heaven ! 

Be very guarded in your actions and demeanor. Cultivate purity of 
heart and thought. 

No woman is fit to become a wife who is not perfectly modest in 
word, deed, and thought. No young man, who is worth having, would 
ever entertain the thought for a moment of taking the girl for a wife who 
is habitually careless in her conversation and displays a levity in her 
manners. Young men may like your free and hearty girls to laugh and 
talk with, but is to taking one for a wife, let me assure you they would 
not tolerate the idea for a moment.

You may at times be unavoidably compelled to hear a vulgar word 
spoken or an indelicate allusion made ; in every instance maintain a rigid 
insensibility. It is not enough that you should cast down your eyes or 
turn your head, you must act as if you did not hear it ; appear as if you 
did not comprehend it. You ought to receive no more impression from 
remarks of this character than a block of wood. Unless you maintain 
this standmg, and preserve this high-toned purity of manner, you will be 
greatly depreciated in the opinion of all men whose opinion is worth hav- 
ing, and you deprive yourself of much influence and lespect which it is 
your privilege to possess and exert. 

COURTSHIP, AFTER ALL, IS A MOMENTOUS 

MATTER. 

After taking all the counsel that may be offered, you must at last, in 
a great measure, rely on your own judgment. Within a few short months 
you have to decide, from what you can see of a man, whether you will 
have him in preference to your parents, friends, and all others that you 
know, to be a life companion. What can you do ? How shall you 
judge? How arrive at a correct conclusion ? My dear young girl, there 
is only One who can assist you. He, in His mercy to your helplessness 
and weakness, has given to every virtuous and pure-minded woman a 
wonaerful, mysterious, and subtle instinct ; a peculiar faculty that cannot 
be analyzed by reason, a faculty that men do not possess, and one in 
which they do not generally believe. At this all-important period, this 
eventful crisis in your life, this womanly instinct guides and saves you. 
You can feel in a moment the presence or influence of a base, sensual, 
and unworthy nature. An electric-like thrill animates you, and you are 
naturally repulsed from him. When your suitor is a man of incongruous 
temper, ungenial habits, and of a morose and unsympathetic disposition, 
this same precious, divine instinct acts, and the man feels, though he can- 
not tell why, that all his arts and aspirations are in vain. It will seldom 
be necessary for you to tell him verbally of his failure ; but should such 
a one blindly insist upon intruding his attentions, do not hesitate to tell 
him kindly but firmly your decision. Should your suilor be one who is 
worthy, who will make you happy, this same blessed instinct will whisper 
in your soul the happy news. From the first interview there is frequently 
thrown around the maiden a peculiar, undefined spell ; she will feel dif- 
ferently in his presence, and watch him with other eyes than she has for

the rest of men, and in due time, when lie shall ask her to decide iijjon 
the question which shall seal the temi)oral and eternal destiny of two 
human kouIs, she will gladly resjjond, giving in loving trustfulness that 
which is the most precious, the most enviable thing on earlh : a maiden's 
heart, a woman's love. 

Many persons, of both sexes, however amiable and pure their minds 
may be, should conscientiously abstain from marriage. This applies to 
all who have a tendency to consumption, scrofula, insanity, or any other 
of those diseases which are so frecpiently transmitted to offspring. This 
very important matter is not sufficiently known, and tlierefore is not 
attended to as it ought to be ; hence the great amount of sickness and 
e.irly death among children. 

'i'he tendency to inherit qualities is very evident in the case of drunk- 
ards, whose children are often inclined to practice the vice of their parents. 
The children of the blind, and of the deaf and dumb, are also liable to be 
afflicted as their ])arents were. 'I'hese facts go far to show that it is liter- 
ally true that the sins of the fathers are visited upon the children. It is, 
however, gratifying to know — and there are many well-altesled cases to 
prove it — that whereas the liildren born to a man while he was addicted 
to drunkenness were similarly addicted to that vice, those born after he 
gave up his vicious indulgence, and by that means improved his bodily 
health, were free from the evil tendency. 



' 



One strong reason 



WHY NEAR RELATIONS SHOULD NOT INTERMARRY 



is that, as the same general tendencies prevail in families, when the parents 
are nearly related they are veiy likely to have the same evil tendency, 
whatever that may be ; and, therefore, there is a great probability that 
their children will also have the same, but more strongly developed, and, 
consequently, the difficulty of their overcoming it will be much increased. 

How plainly, then, ir. it the duty of those about to marry, as well as 
of those who are married, to strive to their uunost, with God's help, to 
overcome disorderly habits of every kind ■ for, be assured, it is only by 
such means they can hope to be blessed with good and healthy children, 
and thereby contribute to their own happiness, and at the same time to 
the improvement ff the race as subjects both of this world and of heaven.

As it is by no means certain tiiat you will marry, and the time may 
come when it will no longer be convenient to your parents to support you, 
it will 1)0 good for you, keeping these contingencies in mind, to qualify 
yourself to earn your own maintenance by some honest industry. You 
will then have a right feeling of independence, and not be tempted to 
marry, as too many young women do, not from the true principle of 
sincere affection, but mainly for a living. They may thus obtain a com- 
petence, and jog on comfortably, but they have no right to expect that 
genuine hapfiiness which I recommend you to aim at. ^Vhen, too, you 
see so many left widows, with small families, and, as we say, totally 
unprovided for, you will become sensible of the soundness of the advice 
I am offering you. As the Lord's lender mercies are over all His works, 
it is evident, from what is occurring around us, that trouble and adversity 
are better suited to the state of some people, to ])rt;)are them for their 
eternal destination, than any amount of prosperity would be. The pooi- 
are no less His children than the rich, and he cares equally — that is, 
inlinitely — for them all. It is certainly wise, then, to be prepared to 
meet adversity, should He suffer it to come upon you. 

Again, suppose you should not liave any suitable offer of marriage, 
such as you would feel it your duty to accept, you are not on that account 
to be disheartened, and fancy yourself overlooked by Providence. 

Single life is evidently the best for some persons; they escape many 
troubles which i)(^rhaps they would find it very hard to bear. There are 
many ways in which single people can lead a useful life, and be 



AS HAPPY AS THE DAY IS LONG. 

No one tiiat is actively useful can be unhappy. What do you see 
around you ? Many, I admit, who are not so haj^py as we should like 
them to be ; but in most cases, if we could fully investigate the matter, it 
would perhaps be found to have arisen from their thinking too much about 
themselves and not enough for others. But, on the other hand, it not 
infrequently happens, when a woman is left, and sees that the support 
and welfare of herself and children depend on her own exertions, she is 
enabled to so successfully put forth her energies and to employ her talents 
which, till she needed them, she hardly knew she possessed, as to surprise 
both herself and the most sanguine of her friends. 

Now, it must be confessed that we are fallen creatures, and therefore 
prone to evil. We are consequently always in danger of going wrong

and forming bad Iiabits, but our Heavenly Father watclies over us at all 
times and gives us power to "refuse the evil and choose the good." We 
are, I know full well, too much inclined to yield to evil influences ; still, 
as we always have divine aid if we implore it, I am not sure that, on the 
whole, it is not as easy to acquire good habits as bad ones. This much 
is certain, that whichever we acquire, they are likely to remain with us 
and are not easily to be got rid of. 

Among the subjects deserving attention as affecting our happiness is 
one on which, perhaps, I am not entitled to say much. I refer to dress. 
Now, I hold it to be a duty for people to dress well — that is, according 
to their ])osition, means, and age ; and this not so much for their own 
sakes as for the sake of giving pleasure to others. It is, I admit, difficult 
to determine how mucli of one's income should be devoted to dress, but 
I think few will deny that at present dress occupies too much time, 
attention, and money. For my own part, I confess I am most affected by 
female dress, and although certainly I like to see women well dressed, 
and would rather see them a little too fine than slovenly, I am often 
pained at witnessing the extravagance and, to me, ridiculous taste 
exhibited. Whenever I see a handsome and expensive dress trailing in 
the dirt, I regard it as culpable waste and in bad taste, and when I see it 
accidentally trodden on I am not sorry. I am inclined to believe that 
many women can hardly find time or opportunity to perform any useful duty; 
they have quite as much as they, poor things, can do to take care of their 
dress. I also believe (and this is the serious point of the matter) that 
many a young man is deterred from soliciting a maiden in marriage by 
knowing that his means would not enable him to let her dress as he is 
accustomed to see her, and this is doubtless one of the many reasons 
why so many of both sexes remain unmarried. I hold, too, that what- 
ever forms an obstacle to marriage has a tendency at the same time to 
obstruct the entrance to heaven. 

I will now allude to some of the duties which will devolve upon you 
as a wife ; and recollect that it is on the faithful discharge of these duties 
that your happiness, here and hereafter, mainly depends. All labor is 
honorable, and you know who it is that says, " My Father worketh 
hitherto, and I work." Being married, you must make your husband feel 



t 



"THERE IS NO PLACE LIKE HOME." 

His business* will probably take him from home most of the day, and it 
should be your care, as I doubt not it will be y^^^r delight, to see to his

t 



comfort, both before he starts and when he returns. It mr.y somcumps 
happen in his fighting the battle of life that he has to encountf^r much 
that is unpleasant, and he may return home depressed. You will then 
have to cheer him, and be assured no one can do it so effectually, so 
pleasantly— aye, and so easily — as yourself. 

It is not to sweep the house, and make the bed, and darn ;he socks, 
and cook the meals, chietly, that a man wants a wife. If this is .^11 that 
he needs, hired help can do it cheaper than a wife. If this is all, when n 
young man calls to see a young lady, send him to the pantry to taste the 
bread and cake she has made. Send him to inspect the needlework and 
bedmaking ; or put a broom into her hands and send him to witness its 
use. Such things ate important, and the wise young man will (juietly 
look after them. But what a true man most wants of a true wife is her 
companionship, sympathy, courage, and love. The way of life has many 
dreary places in it, and a man needs a companion to go with him. A 
man is sometimes overtaken with misfortune ; he meets with failure and 
defeat ; trials and temptations beset him ; and he needs one to stand by 
and sympathize. He has some stern battles to fight with poverty, with 
enemies, and with sin ; and he needs a woman that, while he puts his 
arm around her and feels that he has something to fight for, will help him 
fight ; that will put her lips to his ear and whisper words of counsel, and 
her hands to his heart and impart new inspirations. All through life — 
through storm and through sunshine, conflict and victory, and through 
adverse and favoring winds — man needs a woman's love. The heart 
yearns for it. A sister's or a mother's love will hardly supply the need. 
Yet many seek for nothing further than success in nousework. Justly 
enough, half of these get nothing more ; the other half, surprised beyond 
measure, have got more than they sought. Their wives surprise them by 
bringing a nobler idea of marriage, and disclosing a treasury of courage, 
sympathy, and love. 

And I would here caution you against giving way to little misunder- 
standings in early married life. Sometimes trifling matters, for want of 
some forbearance or concession on one side on the other, perhaps on 
both sides, accumulate into serious results. These differences might be 
avoided by married partners studying each other's peculiarities of char- 
acter, with the aim of mutually correcting, in a kindly spirit, any wrong 
tendency or temper which may sometimes show itself. Should you find 
you have inadvertently given pain to your husband, do not rest until you

have ascertained the cause of his disquiet and succeeded in allaying the 
unhappy feeling. 'I'he earnest desire to please each other should by no 
means terminate on the wedding day, but be studiously continued through 
married life. Each should always endeavor to think the best of the 
other, and instantly reject every thought that might tend to weaken the 
bond of mutual preference and perfect trust. 

If he be wise, he will leave the housekeeping entirely to you; his 
time and attention can be better employed elsewhere. To enable you to 
do this wisely, you should, long before you marry, become familiar with 
the quality and prices of articles of consumption, and where they can best 
be obtained. Every wife should be able to cook well, whether she has to 
do it herself or not. Health and good humor greatly depend upon the 
food being of good ([uality, well cooked, and nicely served up. She 
should also be able, if needful, to make and mend her own and children's 
clothes. 

Too much importance cannot be attached to cleanliness. Men may 
be careless as to their own personal appearance, and may, from the 
nature of their business, be negligent in their dress, but they dislike to 
see any disregard in the dress and appearance of their wives. Nothing 
so depresses a man and makes him dislike and neglect his home as to 
have a wife who is slovenly in her dress and unclean in her habits. 
Beauty of face and form will not compensate for these defects. The charm 
of purity and cleanliness never ends but with life itself. These are 
matters that do not involve any great labor or expense. The use of the 
bath, and the simplest fabrics, shaped by your own supple fingers, will be 
all that is necessary. These attractions will act like a niagnet upon your 
husband. Never fear that there will be any inQuence strong enough to 
take him from your side. 

An experience of many years of observation has convinced me that 
where a pure, industrious, and cheerful wife meets her husband with a 
bright smile on the threshold of her dwelling, that man w^ill never leave 
the home for any other place. 

As all people are liable to illness, e^ery young woman should aim at 
being an efficient nurse. In case of illness, it is now generally admitted 
that good nursing is of more value than medicine. To a sick husband, a 
little gruel or other trifle prepared and given by his wife's own hands will 
confer much more benefit than if prepared and given by another. Should 
it happen to you to fall ill, you may expect your husband to do his best ;

hut you must not be surprised if he is not your equal in that deijartment. 
Nursing is one of the many useful things wiiich women can do better 
than men. A practical knowledge of nursing will enable you to be use- 
ful beyond your own family, and will enhance your value as a neighbor. 

You have often, I trust, experienced the pleasuie of serving others 
from disinterested motives, and found that the pleasure has been deeper 
and purer when you have engaged in doing good to those who could not 
make you any return. This you have found to be the case wherever you 
have had charge of a baby — one of those little ones of whom the Lord 
says : " Tlieir angels do always behold the f;ice of my Father which is in 
heaven." You have perhaps been surprised to fmd how easy it was to 
perform such a duty, and let me assure you that you may always expect 
to find it easy to perform your duty in that state of life to which it shall 
please (iod to call you. He never reipiires anything from any of His 
creatures beyond what He gives them power to do. He is no hard task- 
master. You have only to look to Him and do your best, and then you 
may safely leave the result in His hands. 

Of all God'.s creatures, I know no ha])pier one than a young mother 
with a good husband and a healthy baby. I say a htaltliy baby, for tliat 
implies healthy parents, especially a healthy mo'.her. .She may justly 
feel ])roud that (lOd has intrusted a youno; immortal to her care, and she 
should at all times bear in mind that it is His gift. While it is on all 
hands considered honorable to hold a commission from the President, 
and to fill a higii office, contributing to the welfare of many i)eople, a 
mother may feel her office at least as honorable, seeing she has intrusted 
to her the rearing and training of an immortal being, and that she holds 
her commission direct from the King of Kings. For. recollect, it is only 
by God's blessing that she becomes a mother ; for such is the present 
state of society that many very worthy married people have not the 
privilege of offspring, although they are intensely fond of children and seem 
to have no other earthly want. They may, nevertheless, be very useful, 
and therefore happy, in a different sphere, by the adoption of nephews 
and nieces or in some similar way. 



AT THE BIRTH OF HER FIRST CHILD 

there is opened in the mother's heart a new well of love, such as she had 
not known before ; and although she may fancy that this is all spent 
upon her babe, it is not so, for she loves her God, her husband, and 




if ist

THE LADIES BOOK 



everybody else better than ever. The father, too, is similarly affected ; 
he also has a warmer love for his wife and for all his connections. 

A similar idea is well expressed by M()hler, a (lerman writer, who 
says: "The power of selfishness, which is inwoven with our whole 
being, is altogether broken by marriage, and by degrees love, becoming 
more and more pure, takes its place." When a man marries he gives him- 
self uj) entirely to another being ; in this affair of life he first goes out of 
himself, and inilicts the first deadly wound on his egotism. Hy every 
child with which his marriage is blessed, nature renews the same attack 
on his selfhood, causes him to live less for himself, and more — even 
without being distinctly conscious of it — for others ; his heart expands in 
proportion as the claimants upon it increase, and, bursting the bonds of 
its former narrow exclusiveness, it eventually extends its sympathies to 
all around. 

Whenever a mother is supplying her bady with the food which (lod 
has so wisely provided for it, or is ministering to any other of its numer- 
ous and increasing wants, she may feel that everything she does for it is 
pleasing to her Heavenly Father and has its immediate reward in the delight 
she experiences in the act. 

I can fancy that when a mother has washed her baby, and before 
she dresses it has a good romp with it, smothering it with kisses, calling 
it all the beauties and darlings and pets and jewels she can think of, and 
talking any amount of nonsense at the top of her voice — the baby all the 
while cooing, chirping, or even screaming with delight — at such a time, 
I say, I can easily fancy that the angels are looking on approvingly and 
enjoying the scene. And why not? "Of such is the kingdom of 
heaven." » 

From the time that an infant first becomes conscious of its wants, 
and long afterwards, it looks to its mother to supply them all, fully believ- 
ing her able to do so. She is, in fact, in place of God to it, and it v/'ould 
be well for many of us if we trusted our Heavenly Father as simply and as 
fully as the infant does its earthly mother. 

' Those who know no better, when they see a mother patiently watch- 
ing her sleeping babe, might wonder that she does not feel the want of 
company. She has, however, company that they know not of, and of 
which even she herself may not be conscious. If only our eyes were open, 
we might see that she is not the only one that is so engaged — that angels

are .ilso occupied in watching tho babe and in supporting her. I entirely 
agree with Dr. Watts, where, in his " Cradle Hymn," lie makes tlie motlier 

say : 

" i lush I my hahe, lie Htill and shimber, 
Holy angels gunnl thy bed." 

You probably know tlie beautiful Irish superstition that when a baby 
smiles in its sleep the angels are wliis[)ering to it. 

" Jkfore I became a father, I took lutle or no interest in babies ; 
I rather thought them troublesome things. IJut the arrival of one of my 
own wrought a great change in me. It enlarged at once my views and 
my heart, and I had higher and stronger motives to exertion. My interest 
in them has not yet begun to v/caken, and I have no reason to think it 
ever will." 

Girls are differently constituted from boys. God makes the intellect 
predominate in males, and affection in females. Accordingly, a little girl 
early shows a love for a doll, regarding it quite as her baby and never 
taking into account that it is not alive. She has many of a mother's cares 
and anxieties, as well as pleasures, about it; indeed, as many as she is then 
capable of. It is a constant source of amusement and employment to 
her. In all this we may plainly see the hand of Providence. It forms a 
suitable introduction to some of the interesting and imi)ortanl duties which 
will devolve on her if it should be His good pleasure for her to become a 

mother. ; 

•*-.>■■■ 

You will, I dare say, readily see the object I now have In view. It 
is that I wish to impress on you how desirable it is that you should take 
every opportunity of becorair!g acquainted with the habits and wants of 
babies, and the best way of managing them. The more you have to do 
with them the more you will like the labors, and the easier and more 
delightful it will become. It is fair that, before you have children of your 
own, you should get your knowledge as io the management of them by 
experience with other people's. I take it for granted you will at all limes 
do your best for them. You will then have but little cause to fear acci- 
dent ; and if accident should happen, as with all your care it sometimes 
will, you will have more confidence in your powers, and will be more likely 
to do what is best at the moment, than if you were unused to chi'^ren. 
Much of the disease and early death that happens among children arises 
from the ignorance of the mothers, who, however, are much more to be 
pitied than blamed in the matter. They had never been taught their 
duties toward their future offspring.

THE LADIES* BOOK 



Few mothers are, perhaps, sufficiently aware of the great influence 
which their manners, habits, and conversation have upon the tender minds 
of their children, even from birth. The child should grow up with a feel- 
ing of reverence for its parents, which can only be the case when wisdom, 
as well as affection, is exercised in its bringing up. Hence the necessity 
of the mother fitting herself, both intellectually and morally, for her sacred 
office, that the child may become accustomed to yield perfect obedience 
to her wishes, from a principle of love, and may acquire, as it advances in 
life, the habit of yielding a like obedience to that which is right. 

As you well know that you are not perfect yourself, you must be 
prepared to find that your husband has also his imperfections, and it is no 
unimportant part of your duty to help him to get rid of them. Indeed, it 
is one of the highest uses of marriage for each partner to assist the other 
on the journey to the heavenly Canaan. But before you attempt to point 
out a fault in him, consider how you had best proceed so as to attain 
your object ; for unless you adopt a judicious mode, and an affectionate 
as well as earnest manner, you may do as much harm as good. You must 
also carefully watch your opportunity ; for what would be favorably 
received at one time and under certain circumstances, might under other 
circumstances give offence and altogether fail of the good eiTect'intended 
and hoped for. You do not know how powerful you may be for good to 
your husband. There is much truth in the saying, " A man is what a 
woman makes him." 

Prev.ous to your marriage it will be expedient for you not to give 
your lover that full and unlimited confidence which it will be your duty — 
and your inclination, too — to give him when he becomes your husband. 
I refer chiefly to family and other private matters, not to anything he 
ought to know to enable him to judge of your character and position. 
Many unhappy marriages have been brought about through the young 
woman letting it be known that she has "great expectations.'" A worth- 
less fellow may, in consequence, have succeeded in winning her hand. 

There is another point to which I must just allude before concluding 
this address. It is doubtless the order of Providence for marriage to take 
place, when possible, on our arriving at years of maturity. But I would 
guard you against the evil results of too early marriage, before either 
body or mind is perfectly matured. We scarcely need consult either 
medical or moral science to satisfy ourselves on this by no means 
trifling point. We may find in society too many sad instances of such

/'. 



immature and indiscreet unions. The minds of young persons should be 
expanded by a certain amount of experience 'm the world before entering 
upon engagements involving so many momentous duties. 

In your daily walks abroad, if you examine the countenances of 
those you meet, you will doubtless be led to conclude that there is a 
great deal of disease and misery in the world ; but* judging from my own 
observation, I think you will find that tlie greater number of persons 
exhibit signs of health and happiness. Much of the disease and misery 
with 7/hich the world is afflicted is the direct result of the misconduct of 
the individuals themseh'es ; but no little of it is attributable to their 
parents, who have neglected or violated God's laws of health, their mis- 
conduct thus affecting their Jescendants to the "third and fourtji genera- 
tion." I cannot, therefore, too much impress upon you the importance 
of your honestly trying to find out any bad habits to which you are 
inclined, with a view to getting rid of them, one by one, and supplying 
their place by good habits. By pursuing this course you will not only 
do much for , ■ "/.Vu hap])iness, but also for that of your children, if 
God should bleh m with a family. Children, you know, are often 
striking likenesses of their parents, and in their minds and h .bits they 
likewise often resemble them. You should strive, then, to be good — net 
from mere self-love and that you may get to heaven, but because your 
duty to others requires it. 

Earl Granville, when laying the foundation-stone of the Alexandria 
Orphanage, in England, thus expressed himself in reference to the great 
value of children : " Eew will deny that a ciiild is ' ar. inestimable loan,' 
as it has been called, or refuse to acknowledge, with one of our greatest 
poets, that the world would be a somewhat melancholy one if there were 
no children to gladden it." Children, more than any other earthly thing, 
equalize the conditions of society — to rich and poor they bring an 
interest, a pleasure, and an elevaton which nothing else that is earthly 
does. 

Now, young people, before they think of engaging themselves, should 
clearly know each other's peculiar views of religion ; because if they 
differ seriously on this point there is danger of it interfering with that full 
confidence which is so essential to happiness.

CHAPTER IV. 



lm\ 



I 



LOVE AND MARRIAGE. 

The attraction of' the sexes for each other, though based upon the 
dual principle of generation which pervades the living world and which 
has its analogies in the attractive forces of matter, yet pervades the whole 
being. 

LOVE IS NOT MERELY 

the instinctive desire of physical union, which has for its object the 
continuation of the species — it belongs to the mind as well as to the 
body. It warms, invigorates, and elevates every sentiment, every feeling ; 
and in its highest, purest, most diffusive form unites us to God and all 
creatures in Him. 

ALL LOVE IS 

essentially the same, but modified according to its objects and by the 
character of the one who loves. The love of children for their parents, 
of parents for offspring, brotherly and sisterly love, the love of friendship, 
of charity, and the fervor of religious love, are modifications of the same 
sentiment — the attraction that draws us to oar kindred, our kind; that 
binds together all races and humanity itself, resting on the fatherhood of 
God and the brotherhood of man. It is but natural that this love should 
vary in degrees. Atvractions are proportional to proximity. Family is 
nearer than country ; ve prefer our own nation to the rest of the race. 

Each individual has, also, his own special -attractions and repulsions. 
There is love at first sight and friendship at first sight. We feel some 
persons pleasant to us ; to be near them is a delight. Generally such 
feelings are mutual — like flows to like, or as often, perhaps, differences fit 
into each other. We seek sympathy with our own tastes and habits, or 
we find in others what we lack. Thus the weak rest upon the strong, the 
timid are fond of the courageous, the reckless seek guidance of the 
prudent, and so on. The sentiment of 

LOVE FOR THE OPPOSITE SEX 

— tender, romantic, passionate — begins very early in life. Fathers and 
daughters, mothers and sons, have a special fondness for each other, as.

also, have brothers and sisters ; but the boy soon comes to admire 
someone, generally older than himself, who is not a relation. Very little 
girls find a hero in some friend of an elder brother. 

FONDNESS FOR COUSINS 

generally comes more from opportunity than natural attraction, though a 
cousin may have very little appearance of family relation. The law 
appears to be that free choice seeks the diverse and distant. A stranger 
has always a better chance with the young ladies of any district than the 
young men with whom they have always been acquainted. Savages seek 
their wives out of their own tribe. 

It is my belief that naturally (I mean in a state of pure and unper- 
verted nature, but developed, cultivated, and refined by education) every 
man loves womanhood itself, and all women so far as they approximate 
to his ideal ; and that in the same way every woman loves manhood, and 
is attracted and charmed by all its gentle, noble, and heroic manifesta- 
tions. By such a man, every woman he meets is reverenced as a mother, 
sister, daughter, or, it may be, cherished in a more tender relation, which 
should be at first, and may always remain, free from any sensual desire. 
Such love may have many objects, each attracting the kind and degree of 
affection which it is able to inspire. Such love of men for women, and 
women for men, may be free and will be free just in the degree in which 
it is freed from the bondage of sensual passion. 



i. 



SUCH LOVE HAS A DIRECT TENDENCY 

to raise men above the control of their senses. The more of such 
loA'e one has and the more it is diffused, the less the liability to sink 
into the lower and disorderly loves of the sensual life. 

The idea that every attraction, every attachment, every love between 
the sexes must lead to marriage — that no love can be tolerated but with 
that end in view — is a very false and mischievous one. It deprives men 
and women of the strength and happiness they might have in pure 
friendships and pure loves, and it leads to a multitude of false and bad 
marriages. Two persons are drawn together by strong attractions and 
tender sentiments for each other who have no more right to be married 
than if they were brother and sister, but who have the same right to love 
each other., But their true sentiments for each other, and consequent

relation to each other, are not understood by those around them and 
perhaps not by themselves. They are urged by the misapprehension of 
others, by their expectation, by ignorant gussip, by the prejudice of 
society, based upon low and sensual estimates of life, to marry ; they find 
that they must either marry or lose the happiness they have in each 
other's society, and they make the irrevocable mistake. 

When it is understood that there are 

OTHER LOVES 

than that of marriage ; when the special attraction that justifies union for 
life, and the begetting of offspring, is discriminated from all the other 
attractions that may bring two souls into very near and tender relations 
to each other, there will be more happiness in the world and fewer 
incomi)lele, imperfect, and, iheiefore, more or less unhappy, marriages. 
Nothing can be more detestable than that playing with fire which goes 
by the name of 

FLIRTATION ; 

but there are men and women who have the happiness of living and of 
being tenderly and devotedly loved by persons of the opposite sex — 
loved i)urely, nobly, happily — without injury and with great good. V^hen 
such loves are accompanied by perfect trust in the goodness, purity, 
truth, and honor of the beloved, there can be no jealousy, no desire for 
selfish absorption, no fear of deprivation of any right. There is no 
reason why a huoL>and or a wife should limit the range of pure and spirit- 
ual affection to near relatives. 



THE MAN WHO CAN LOVE 

a sister as sisters are often loved, may love in the same way, or as 
purely, any woman who might be his sister. As men and women learn 
to purify their lives, the world will grow more tolerant and love will 
become more universal. The tender and fervent exhortations to mutual 
love to be found in the Gospels and Epistles of the New Testament are 
now almost without a meaning. But they had a meaning to those to 
whom they were addressed, and when we are better Christians, and bring 
our lives to the purity of Christian morality, they will have a meaning to 
us and we shall learn that, in a sense we have not dreamed of, God is 
Love.

IN THE HUMAN RACE ALL CIRCUMSTANCES POINT TO 

MONOGAMY 

as the lawful or natural condition. Males and females are born in almost 
equal numbers. If there are two or three per cent, more of males than 
females, the risks of life with males soon make the number even. There- 
fore, as i\ rule, no man can have more than one wife without robbing his 
neighbor. 

Polygamy is therefore a manifest injustice, and may become the 
most grievous of all monopolies. 

Children are the most helpless of all young creatures and require the 
care of parents for the longest period. The care of a husband for his 
wife, and of a father for his child, is an evident necessity. The proper 
care and education of a single child should extend over at least fifteen 
years, and that of a family may reach to thirty years, or throughout the 
greatest part of an ordinary life. During all periods of pregnancy, child- 
bearing, nursing, and the education and care of a family, every woman 
has a right to the sympathy, sustaining love, and constant aid of her 
husband. No man has a right to desert or leave helpless, or even 
dependent upon others, except in extraordinary cases, the mother of his 
children. 

Marriage, like celibacy, shouiJ be a matter of vocation. 



i 



THE SPECIAL OBJECT OF MARRIAGE 

is to have children ; the co-operating motive is that two persons drawn to 
each other by a mutual affection may live helpfully and happily togeti\er. 
A selfish marriage, for its merely animal gratifications — a marriage in 
which strength, health, usefulness, often life itself, are sacrificed to 
sensuality and lust — is a desecration of a holy institution, and somewhat 
worse in its consequences than promiscuous profligacy, for the conse- 
quences of that may not fall upon one's childien and posterity. 

There are many persons who have no right to mar.'-y. There should 
be a kind and amount of love that will justify and sanctify such a relation. 
There should be a pure motive and the fixed intention of making the 
relation what it ought to be to husband, wife, and children. There should 
be a reasonable assurance of the power to provide for a family. There 
should be that amount of health, that freedom from bodily and mental 
disease, that physical and moral constitution which will give a reasonable 
prospect of children whose lives will be a blessing to themselves and to 
society.

When there is deformity of body, or an unhappy peculiarity of temper 
or mind liable to be inherited, people should not marry, or if they live 
together, should resign the uses of marriage. People should conscien- 
tiously refrain from propagating hereditary diseases. Persons near of kin 
are wisely forbidden to marry, for there is in such cases the liability of 
imperfect generation — the production of blind, deaf, idiotic or insane 
offspring. 

SHOULD MARRIAGE BE FOR LIFE? 

As a rule, undoubtedly. Every real, proper, true marriage must be. It 
takes a lifetime for a husband and wife to make a home and rear and 
educate and provide for a family of children. But what if people make 
mistakes and find that thoy are not suitably married ? These are 
mistakes very difficult to remedy. If a man, after deliberately making his 
choice of a woman, ceases to love her, how can he honorably withdraw 
from his relation to her, and enter upon another, 

WHEN SHE STILL LOVES HIM, 

and is ready to fulfill her part of the contract? Laws cannot very well 
provide for mistakes. If the distaste for each other be nutual, and both 
parties desire to separate, a separation may of course be permitted ; but it 
is a serious question whether two such persons can go into the world and 
find new partners, with justice to the rest. The law which permits of no 
divorce certainly bears hard upon individual cases ; but if it leads' to 
greater seriousness and care in forming such relations, it may be, on the 
whole, the best thing for society that it should be strictly observed.

CHAPTER V. 

WHEN TO MARRY — HOW TO SELECT A PARTNER 

ON RIGHT PRINCIPLES. 

The proper age to marry is a somewhat vexed question, but need- 
lessly so, because that age varies much, according to temperament and 
other circumstances relating to the individual. Although after puberty 
the sexual organs are capable of reproduction, yet it by no means follows 
that they should be used for that [nirpose. Their early activity is 
intended for the perfection of the body and mind, and not for the con- 
tinuation of tlie species. 

VERY EARLY MARRIAGE, 

therefore, should be avoided, because the nervous force expended in 
amative indulgence is imperatively recjuired in both sexes for developing 
the physical and mental faculties. The zoosperms produced by the male 
in the first years of puberty are inferior in power and less capable of 
producing healthy offspring than those of mature years. The early germs, 
also, of the female are less fitted for fecundation than those that appear 
later in life ; nature evidently intending these early efforts to be used on 
the individuals themselves in building up their bodies, strengthening their 
minds, and preparing them to reproduce their species in maturer years. 
There is a serious day of reckoning for early ind'ilgence ; for precocious 
persons (unless their constitutions are as powerful as their desires) who 
give way to their passions at their first exactions, barter their youth for 
their enjoyment, and are old and weary of the world at an age when 
people of more moderate habits are only in the meridian of pleasure and 
existence. 



i' 



GENERALLY THE BEST AGE TO MARRY, 

where the health is perfect, is from twenty-one to twenty-five in the male 
and from eighteen to twenty-one in t! female. As a general rule, 
marriages earlier than this are injurious and detrimental to health. Men 
who marry too young, unless they are of cold and phlegmatic constitu- 



rr 



If

tion, and thus moderate in their conduct, become partially bald, dim of 
sight, and lose all elasticity of limb in a f'^w years ; while women in a 
like position rarely have any bloom on their cheek or fire in their eye by 
the time they are twenty-five. And all profound physiologists agree that 
from the same cause tlie mental faculties suffer in the same ratio. 

A medium, however, is to be observed. It is not well to defer till 
middle age the period of connubial intercourse ; for too tedious spinster- 
hood is as much calculated to hasten the decay of beauty as too early a 
marriage. Hence, there is rarely any freshness to be seen in a maiden 
of thirty ; while the matron of that age, if her life has been a happy one, 
and her hymeneal condition of not more than ten years' standing, is 
scarcely in the heyday of her charms. And the same rule will apply 
with equal force to the other sex ; for, after the first prime of life, bache- 
lors decay and grow old much faster than married men. 

The rich are qualified for marriage before the poor. This is owing 
to the superiority of their aliment; for very nutritious food, and the con- 
stant use of wines, coffee, etc., greatly assists in developing the organs of 
reproduction ; whereas the food generally made use of among the peas- 
antry of most countries — as vegetables, corn, milk, etc.— retards their 
growth. Owing to this difference of diet, the daughter of a man of 
wealth, who keeps a good table, will be as adequate to certain duties of 
married life at eighteen as the daughter of a humble peasant at twenty- 
one. Singular as it may seem, it is none the less true, that love novels, 
amorous conversations, playing parlor games for kisses, voluptuous 
pictures, waltzing, and, in fact, all things having a tendency to create 
desire, assist in promoting puberty and preparing young persons for early 
marriage. Those who reach this estate, however, by artificial means and 
much before the natural period will have to suffe* for it in after life. 

The female who marries before the completion of her womanhood — 
that is, before her puberty is established — will cease to grow and proba- 
bly become pale and delicate, the more especially if she become preg- 
nant soon after marriage. A person who is thus circumstanced will also 
be liable to abortions and painful deliveries.

three years after the age of puberty. Many instances could be cited of 
the injurious effects resulting from not observing this rule. The case of

the son of Napoleon I. is a notable instance, who, at the age of fifteen or 
sixteen, began his career of sexual indulgence, which ended his life at the 
early age of twenty-one years. He was an amiable, inoffensive, and 
studious youth, beloved by his granafather and the whole Austrian 
court ; and though the son of the most energetic man that modern times 
has produced, yet, from his effeminate life, he scarcely attracted the least 
public attention. 

Let me, therefore, advise the male reader lO keep his desires id lead- 
ing-strings until he is at least twenty-one, and tiie female not to enter the 
pale of wedlock until she is past her eighteeth year ; but after these 
periods marriage is their proper sphere of actibn, and one in which they 
must play a part or suffer actual pain as well as the loss of one of the 
greatest of earthly pleasures.

MARRIAGES ARE MOST HAPPY 

and most productive of handsome and healthy offspring when the husband 
and wife differ, not only in mental conformation, but in bodily construc- 
tion, A melancholy man should mate himself with a sprightly woman, 
and vice versa ; lor otherwise they will soon grow weary of the monotony 
of each other's company. By the same rule should tiie choleric and the 
patient be united, and the ambitious and the humble ; for the opposites 
of their natures not only produce pleasurable excitement, but each keeps 
the other in a wholesome check. In the size and form of tlie parties the 
same principles hold good. Tall women are not the ideals of beauty to 
tall men ; and if they marry sucli, they will soon begin to imagine greater 
perfections in other forms than in those of their own v/ives. And this is 
well ordered by nature, to prevent the disagreeable results which are 
almost certain to grow out of unions where the parties have a strong 
resemblance. 

For instance, tall parents will probably have childrcii taller than 
either, and mental imbecility is the usual attendant of extreme size. The 
union of persons prone to corpulency, of dwarfs, etc., would have parallel 
results ; and so, likewise, of weakly and attenuated coupleiw The tall 
should marry the short, the corpulent the lean, the choleric the gentle, and 
so on, and the tendency to extremes in the parents will be corrected in 
the offspring. 

Apart from these considerations, there are reasons why persons of 
the same disposition should not be united and wedlock. An amiable 



xoa

wife to a choleric man is like oil to troubled waters ; an i!l-tempered one 
will make his life a misery and his home a hell. The man of studious 
habits should marry a woman of sense and spirit rather than of erudition, 
or the union will increase the morotony of his existence, which it would be 
well for his health and spirits to correct by a little conjugal excitement j 
and the man of gloomy temperament will find the greatest relief from the 
dark forebodings of his mind in the society of a gentle, but lively and 
smiling partner. 

However, in some particulars the dispositions and constructions of

or they will have but few enjoyments in common. The man of lull 
habits and warm nature had better remain single than unite his destinies 
with a woman whose heart repulses the soft advancements of love ; and 
the sanguine female in whose soul love is the dominant principle should 
avoid marriage with a very phlegmatic person, or her caresses, ins. :ad of 
being returned in kind, will rather excite feelings of disgust. Thus the 
discriminations to be made in the choice of a partner are extremely nice. 

Nature generally assists art in the choice of partners. \/e instinc- 
tively seek in the object of our desires the qualities which we do not 
possess ourselves. This is a most admirable :.r:angement of Providence> 
as it establishes an equilibrium and prevents people from tending to 
extremes ; for it is known that unions of dwarfs are fruitful of dwarfs, 
that giants proceed from the embrace of giants, and that offspring o*" 
parents alike i'^ritable, alike passive, alike bashful, etc., inherit the 
prominent qualities of both to such a degree as to seriously interfere 
with their prospects in the world. 

It has another advantage. Through its means " Every eye forms 
its own beauty "; hence, what one person rejects is the l/eau ideal of 
another's conceptions, and thus we are all provided for. 

In fine, with man as with animals, the best way to improve the breed 
is to cross it, for the intermarriage of like with like and relative with 
relative not only causes man to degenerate, but if the system became 
universal would in time bring the human race to a termination altogether. 

A male or female with a very low forehead should carefully avoid 
marriage with a person of like conformation, or their offspring will, in all 
probabilty, be weak-minded or victims to partial idiocy.

The system of crossing is so perfect that marriages between persons 
of different countries are likely to be pleasant and fruitful. Speaking on 
this subject, an English writer says: "The Persians have been s") im- 
proved by introducing foreigners that they have completely succeeded in 
washing out iheir Mongolian origin." And the same author adds to the 
effect that in those parts of Persia where there is no foreign intercourse 
the inhabitants are sickly and stunted, while in those that are frequented 
by strangers they are large and healthy. 

To make what is called 

"A HANDSOME COUPLE," 

the female should be about three inches less than the male, and the 
parties should be proportionately developed throughout their system. 



"A WELL-FORMED WOMAN," 

says a modern physiologist, " should have her head, shoulders, and chest 
small and compact ; arms and limbs relatively short ; her hauiiches 
apart ; her hips elevated ; her abdomen large, and her thighs voluminous. 
Hence, she should taper from the center up and down. ^Vhereas, in a 
well-formed man the shoulders a;e more prominent than the hips. 
Great hollowness of the back, the pressing of the thighs against each 
other in walking, and the elevation of one hip above the other, are 
indications of the malformation of the pelvis." 

From the same writer I take the following, which is applicable here. 
It is very correct in its estimates of beauty in both sexes : — 

" The length of the neck should be proportionately less in the male 
than in the female, because the dependence of the mental system on the 
vital one is naturally connected with the shorter courses of the vessels 
of the neck. 

" The neck should form a gradual transition between the body and 
head — its fullness concealing all prominences of the throat. 

" The shoulders should slope from the lower part of the neck, 
because the reverse shows that the upper part of the chest owes its width 
to the bones and muscles of the shoulders. 

" The upper part of the chest should be relatively short and wide, 
independent of the size of the shoulders, for this shows the vital organs 
which it contains are sufficiently developed.

" The waist should taper a litt'e farther than the middle of the trunk, 
and be marked, especially in the back and loins, by the approximation of 
the hips. 

"The waist should be narrower than the upper part of the trunk and 
its muscles, because the reverse indicates the expansion of the stomach, 
liver, and great intestine, resulting from their excessive use. 

" The back of woman should be more hollow than that of man ; for 
otherwise the pelvis is not of sufficient deptn for parturition. 

*' Women should have more extended loins than men, at the 
expense of tiie superior and inferior parts, for this conformation is 
essential to gestation. 

" The abdomen should be larger in woman than in man, for the 
same reason. 

" Over all these parts the cellular tissue, and the plumpness con- 
nected with it, should obliterate all distinct projection of muscles. 

" The surface of the whole female form should be characterized by 
its softness, elasticity, smoothness, delicacy, and polish, and by the 
gradual and easy transition between the parts. 

" The moderate plumpness already described should bestow on the 
organs of woman great suppleness. Plumpness is essentij.l to beauty, 
especially in mothers, because in them the abdomen necessarily expands, 
and would afterwards collapse and become wrinkled. 

"An excess of plumpness, however, is to be guarded against. 
Young women who are very fat are co'd and prone to barrenness. 

*' In no case should plumpness be so predominant as to destroy the 
distinctness of parts." 

A male and female formed on the above models would be well 
matched and have fine children.

CHAPTER VI. 

SEXUAL INTERCOURSE — ITS LAWS AND CONDI- 
TIONS-ITS USE AND ABUSE. 



There is an increasing and alarming prevalence of nervous ailments 
and complicated disorders that could be traced to have their sole origin 
from this source. Hypochondria, in its various phases, results from the 
premature and unnatural waste of the seminal fluid. Then speedily 
ensues a lack of natural heat, a deficiency of vital power, and conse- 
quently indigestion, melancholy, languor, and dejection ensue ; the victim 
becomes enervated and spiritless, loses the very attributes of man, and 
premature old age soon follows. 

IT IS A PREVALENT ERROR 

that it is necessary for the semen to be ejected at certain times from the 
body; that its retention is incompatible with sound health and vigor of 
body and mind. This is a very fallacious idea. The seminal fluid is too 
precious — nature bestows too much care in its elaboration for it to be 
wasted in this unproductive manner. It is intended, when not used for 
the purpose of procreation, to be reabsorbed again into the system, giv- 
ing vigor of body, elasticity and strength to the mind, making the 
individual strong, active, and self-reliant. When kept as nature intended, 
it is a perpetual fountain of life and energy — a vital force which acts in 
€very direction, a motive power which infuses manhood into every 
organ of the brain and every fiber of the body. 

THE LAW OF SEXUAL MORALITY 

for childhood is one of utter negation of sex. Every child should be 
kept pure and free from amative excitement and the least amative 
indulgence, which is unnatural and doubly hurtful. No language is 
strong enough to express the evils of amative excitement and unnatural 
indulgence betbre the age of puberty ; and the dangers are so great that 
I see no way so safe as '

regarding them at the earliest age. A child may be taught, simply as a 
matter of science, as one learns botany, all that is needful to know, and 
such knowledge may protect it from the most terrible evils. 

The law for childhood is perfect purity^ which cannot be too care- 
fully guarded and protected by parents, teachers, and all caretakers. The 
law for youth is perfect continence — a pure vestalate alike in both sexes. 
No indulgence is required by one more than the other — for both nature 
has made the same provision. The natures of both are alike, and any — 
the least — exercise of the amative function is an injury to one as to the 
other. 



MEN EXPECT 



Ml, 



that women shall come to them in marriage chaste and pure from the 
least defilement. Women have a right to expect the same of their hus- 
bands. Here the sexes are upon a perfect equality. 

On this subject. Dr. Carpentar (physiological works) has written like 
a man of true science, and, therefore, of true morality. He lays it down 
as an axiom that i/ie development of the individual and the reproduction 
of the species stand in an inverse ratio to each other. He says : "The 
augmented development of the generative organs at puberty can only be 
rightly regarded as preparatory to the exercise of the organs. The 
development of the individual must be completed before the procreative 
power can properly be exercised for the continuance of the race." And 
in the following extract from his " Principles of Human Physiology." he 
confirms my statement respecting the unscientific and libertine advice of 
too many physicians : " The author would say to those of his younger 
readers who urge the wants of nature as an excuse for the illicit gratifica- 
tion of the sexual passions, ' try the effects of close mental application to 
some of those ennobling pursuits to which your profession introduces you, 
in combination with vigorous bodily exercise, before you assert that 
appetite is unrestrainable and act upon that assertion.' Nothing tends 
so much to increase the desire as the continual direction of the mind 
toward the objects of its gratification, whilst nothing so effectually 
represses it as a determined exercise of the mental faculties upon other 
objects and the expenditure of nervous energy in other channels. Some 
works which have issued from the medical pre«is contain much that is 



t

t 



calculated to excite, rather than to repress, the propensitj' ; and the 
advice sometimes given by practitioners to their patients is immoral as 
well as unscientific." 

EVERY IV N AND EVERY WOMAN, 

living simply, purely, and temperately — respecting the laws of health in 
regard to air, food, dress, exercise, and habits of life — not only can live in 
the continence of a pure virgin life when single, and in the chastity 
which should be observed by all married partners, but be stronger, 
happier, and in every way better by so living. 

Chastity is tiie conservation of life, and the consecration of its forces 
to the highest use. Sensuality is the waste of life, and the degradation of 
its forces to pleasure divorced from use. Chastity is life ; sensuality is 
death. 

FROM THE AGE OF PUBERTY TO MARRIAGE 

the law is the same for both sexes — full employment of mind and body, 
temperance, purity, and perfect chastity in thought, word, and deed. 
The law is one of perfect equality. There is no license for the male 
which is not equally t'^e right of the female. There is no physiological 
ground for any indulgence in one case more than in the other. No man 
has any more right to require or expect purity in the woman who is to be 
his wife than the woman i;:^s to require and expect purity in her 
husband. It is a simple matter of justice and right. No man can enter 
upon an amative relation with a woman, except in marriage, without 
manifest injustice to his future wife, unless he allow her the same liberty ; 
and also without a great wrong to the woman, and to her possible 
husband. 

It is contended that the sins of men against chastity are more venial 
than those of women, because of the liability of women to have children. 
But men are also liable to be the fathers of childre.i, who are deeply 
wronged by the absence of paternal care. The child has its rights, and 
every child has the right to be born in honest, respectable wedlock, of 
parents able to give it a sound constitution and the nurture and education 
it requires. The child who lacks these conditions is grievously wronged 
by both father and mother. 



I

THE LAW OF MARRIAGE 



is, that a mature man and woman, with sound health, pure lives, and a 
reasonable prospect of comfortably educating a family, when drawn to 
each other by the attraction of mutual love, should chastely and tem.per- 
ately unite for offspring. The sexual relation has this chief and control- 
ling purpose. The la'v of nature is intercourse for reproduction. Under 
the Christian law, marriage is the symbol of the union of Christ with the 
Church ; husband and wife are one in the Lord ; they are to live in 
marriage chastity, not in lust and uncleanness ; and there cannot be a 
more hideous violation of Christian morals than for a husband to vent 
his sensuality upon a feeble wife, against her wishes and when she has 
no desire for offspring and no power to give them the healthy constitu- 
tions and maternal care which is their right. 

The law of Christian morality is very clear. It is the sexual union 
first and chiefly for its principal object. It is for the husband to refrain 
from it »vhenever it is not desired ; whenever it would be hurtful to 
either ; whenever it would be a waste of life ; whenever it would injure 
mother or child, as during pregnancy iind lactation. 

A MAN WHO TRULY LOVES A WOMAN 

must respect and reverence her, and cannot make her the victim of his 
inordinate and unbridled, selfish and sensual nature. He will be ever, 
from the first moment of joyful possession to the last of his life, tender, 
delicate, considerate, deferent, yielding to her slightest wishes in the 
domain of love, and never encroaching, never trespassing upon, never 
victimizing the wife of his bosom and the mother of his babes. We 
have romance before marriage, we want more chivalry in marriage. 

This is not the world's morality, yet it seems to one the world must 
respect it. This high and pure Christian morality is not always enforced 
by Christian ministers, some of whom yield too much to human sensuality 
and depravity, instead of maintaining the higher law of Christian purity, 
which is but nature restored or freed from its stains of sin. The world 
requires that unmarried women should be chaste, while it gives almost 
unbridled license to men. A girl detected in amours is disgraced and 
often made an outcast. In young men such irregularities are freely 
tolerated. They are *' a little wild " ; they " sow their wild oats " ; but 
open profligacy, the seduction of innocence, the ruin of poor girls, 
adultery, harlotry and its diseases do not hinder men from marrying, nor

from requiring that, those they marry should have spotless reputations. 
It is not for a moment permitted that women in these matters should 
behave like men, and a pure girl is given to the arms of a wasted 
debauchee, and her babes are perhaps born dead, or suffer through life 
with syphilitic diseases, while she endures a long martyrdom from dis- 
ordered, diseased, and unrestrained sensuality. For the unmarried, 
young men, soldiers, sailors, and all who do not choose to bear the 
burdens of a family, society has its armies of prostitutes — women like 
others, and more than others, or in less reputable fashion, the victims of 
the unbridled lust of men. They are everywhere tolerated as 

"NECESSARY EVILS," 

and, in some places, protected or regulated ; and, from economical or 
philanthropic considerations, or both, combined efforts are made to free 
them from the contagious diseases which for some centuries have been a 
curse attending this form of the violation of the laws of nature — one of the 
consequences of lust which is the divorce of the sexual instinct from its 
natural use and purpose. 

The Christian 

LAW OF MARRIAGE, 

as set down in die Holy Scriptures, and defined by the best writers on 
moral theology, is in harmony with nature, in consonance with the higher 
nature of man. "God hath set the earth in families." Adultery is a sin, 
because it disorders that divine arrangement. Fornication is a sin, because 
it prevents pure marriages. Prostitution is a sin, because it is a sacrifice 
of women, who might be wives and mothers, to the aelfish lusts of men. 
All useless indulgence is a waste of life, and a kind of suicide. In a pure 
marriage union, men and women unite themselves with God in acts of 
creative power. The progress of humanity depends upon individual 
development and the conditions of generation and gestation. With 
culture and a harmonized development, we acquire a higher and more 
integral life. When two parents are in their highest condition and in 

A TRUE UNION 

with each other, the child combines the best qualities of both parents. 
When parents are not in the unity of a mutual love., the child may be 
inferior to either i^arent. The intensity of mutual love tends to the repro-

duction of the best faculties of beta parents in the child. When men or 
women are exhausted or diseased the race deteriorates. Health is there- 
fore one of the conditions of progress. 

" It is all very fine," I shall be told, " to talk of purity and chastity ; 
but we must take men as they are. How are you going to make men 
pure and chaste, and respectful of the purity of women ? How can you 
get men with strong amative propensities to live like anchorites ? " 

How can you get men to do anything right, or refrain from any 
wrong thing? There are three motives — fear of punishment, hope of 
reward, and sense of right or the principle of duty. The first of these is 
the lowest, but often the most effectual ; the second is higher, and appeals 
to hope and the love of happiness ; the third, the highest of all motives, 
pure and unselfish as the love of truth, as in mathematics, acts on noble 
minds with great power. Men of real conscientiousness love the right for 
its own sake. Tliey are just from love of justice ; pure from a sense and 
love of purity. They love good, and God as the source of all good ; and 
do right, not from fear or hope, but from pure love. 

We must appeal to all motives. Men refrain from theft and other 
dishonest conduct from the dread of disgrace and punishment, because 
they see that "honesty is the best policy,'" and from a sense of justice 
and regard to the rights of property, or a sense of honor which makes a 
mean action impossible. By similar motives great numbers are restrained 
from drunkenness and other vices. Children are to be restrained from 
impurity by the fear of the terrible consequences of unnatural indulgence 
in causing disease and pain, by the hope of a pure, healthy and happy life 
of love in manhood and womanhood, and by a sense of the beauty and 
holiness of chastity and the sacredness of the functions by which the 
race is recreated and preserved. The religious feelings that our bodies 
are to be kept pure, healthy, and holy in every way as the temples of 
the Holy Ghost cannot be too early instilled into the infant mind, which 
is open to the highest sentiments of veneration, devotion, and heroic 
religion. In youth there are the same motives. Indulgence in solitary 
vice is self-destructive of all that youth most values — a profanation of his 
own body. 

SEDUCTION 

is a desecration of what he should hold in the most tender reverence. To 
the young man, womanhood should be sacred, and every woman, mother, 
sister, beloved of the present or the future, should never be wronged by

one thought of impurity. In this matter instinct goes with right. The 
inward voice supports the outer law of morality. Kefore men can be- 
come bad, their instinctive modesty must be broken down. Unless very 
badly born, with disordered amativeness, hereditary from a diseased and 
lustful parentage, they must be pejverted and corrupted before they can 
act immodestly and impurely. 

WOMEN ARE PROTECTED 

by a strong public sentiment around them. They have the dread of 
disgrace. For them to yield to their own affectionate desires, or the 
solicitations of a lover, is a fall, is ruin. They have the hope of a loving 
husband, a happy home, and the respect of society. And in woman 
passion has commonly less force, and the sentiment of modesty and 
purity more power. Women are weak in yielding to solicitation, giving 

EVERYTHING FOR LOVE; 

but we see how protective of female virtue are these motives to vast 
numbers. 

Men can perfectly restrain the sensual part of their natures when- 
ever they have a strong motive to do so. A child would be simply mad 
who was not controlled by the presence of father, mother, and persons he 
resi)ecled or feared. Young men have no difficulty when they are in 
the company of pure women. They are in no trouble when their lives are 
full of mental and muscular activity, and particularly if their habits of 
eating simply and temperately, of refraining from heating and exciting 
stimulants, and sleeping in cold beds and fresh air, are such as health 
requires. There needs but the strong will to live purely in any one, and 
at any age, the will that comes from the high motives of conscience and 
religion, or all motives combined. A strong sense of what is just and 
right controls even the motions of our bodies and actions which seem to 
be involuntary. A man who has a vivid sense of the right and duty of 
refraining from sensuality, and preserving his own purity of niind and 
body and the chastity of all women, will do so even in his dreams. 
When the will is right, all things are soon brought into its subjection. 
The mind controls the organization, and the life forces are directed into 
other channels. A strong man, full of 

LIFE AND LOVE, 

can safely hold a virgin in his arms, and respect her virginity, if he have

but the motives and the will to do so. If he be pure in his will, how can 
he commit impurity? If a woman be sacred in his eyes, how can he 
profane her? It is not that men have not the power of restraint, the 
power to do right ; it is that they lack the motive. They have lost the 
sense of right ; they are even impelled to do wrong by the pressure of 
opinion around them. Boys and young men are driven into liberlinage 
by the r'dicule of their companions. Vice is considered manly. They 
seek sensuality in an evil emulation, as they learn to smoke, or gamble, or 
drink ; and, later on, vanity has often more to do with excess than the 
force of lust. Young men seduce girls that they may boast of it. They 
keep mistresses because it is the fashion. They exhaust themselves 
because they wish to give a high idea of their manly powers. Even in 
marriage, women are injured and have their health destroyed by yielding 
weakly, or from 






A FALSE SENSE OF DUTY, 

to a husband whose own motive is the desire to acquit himself manfully 
in what he considers his marital duties. Men and women are, in thou- 
sands of cases, wretched victims to what they imagine to be the wants or 
expectations of each other. A man, ignorant of the nature of women 
and the laws of the generative function, goes on in a process of miserable 
exhaustion, to please his wife. She submits, sometimes in pain, often in 
disgust, weariness, and weakness, to what she dare not, from 

LOVE OR FEAR, 

refuse. Men have to know what is right and to will to be right. This 
will is omnipotent. God he'ps those who have the will, who have even 
the desire, to do right. 

If the presence of those we fear or reverence, respect or love, 
restrain us from sin and stimulate us to right action, faith in the existence 
and presence of God and angels, and the spirits of the departed, nun': 
have a more powerful and pervading influence. No one who really 
believes in the existence of a Supreme Being, no one who is strongly 
impressed with the reality of a spiritual life, can go on doing what he 
knows to be wrong. A religious faith is therefore the most powerful of 
r.ll restraints from evil and incitement to good.

CHAPTER VII. 



MARRIAGE. 



WHAT IS MARRIAGE? 



Marriage is in law the conjugal union of man with woman, and is the 
only state in which cohabitation is considered proper and irreprehensible. 
The marriage relation exists in all Christian communities, and is considered 
the most solemn of contracts, and, excepting in Protestant countries, it is 
regarded as a sacrament. In some countries its celebration falls under the 
cognizance of ecclesiastical courts only, but in the United States it is 
regarded as merely a civil cuntract, magistrates having, equally with 
clergymen, the right to solemnize it, though it is usually the practice to 
have it performed by a clergyman and attended with religious ceremonies. 
Marriage, as a legalized custom, is of very ancient origin. It is doubtful 
whether even the primitive man was not governed in the intercourse of 
the sexes by some recognition of the union being confined to one chosen 
one. No greater promiscuity can certainly be supj^osed than occurs in 
the lower animals, where pairing is the law. The nobler animals, as the 
lion, elephant, etc., never have but one mate, and even in case of death 
do not remate. As men advanced, civil codes were inaugurated and 
certain protection given to the choice of the parties. The earliest civil 
code regulating marriage, of which we have any account, was that of 
Menes, who, Herodotus tells us, was the first of the Pharaohs, or native 
Egyptian kings, and who lived about 3,500 years before Christ. The 
nature of his code is not known. 

The Biblical account extends further back, but it does not appear 
that any laws existed regulating marriage, but each one was allowed to 
choose his wife and concubines, and it is supposed that common consent 
respected the selection. Next, Moses gave laws for the government of 
marriage among the Israelites. The early Greeks followed the code of 
Cecrops, and the Romans were also governed in their marital relations by 
stringent laws. In fact, the necessity of some law regulating the inter- 
course between the sexes must have become very apparent to all nations

or communities at a very early period. It certainly antedates any legal 
regulations with regard to the possession of property. It is very probable 
that every community did by common consent afford to each male one or 
more females, and the presumption is iliat such choice or assignment, as 
the case may have been, was respected by common agreement as inviola- 
ble. It is doubtful if ever promiscuity was the law or privilege with any 
community of men, even in their primitive state. The possession of reason 
is antagonistic to such a belief; and man was most j^robably elevated 
above the beast by the faculty of reason in this respect as in others. 
Promiscuous indulgence is always evidence of debauchery, and a 
departure from that natural course whi< > is prompted by an innate sense 
of propriety characterizing mankind. The law is very indefinite with 
regard to what constitutes a legal marriaj4e. It is an unsettled question, 
both in England and this country, whether a marriage solemnized by 
customary formalities alone is legal, or if one characterized by the mere 
consent of the parties is illegal. 'J'he latter has been held as legal in some 
instances in both countries. Kent, in his " Commentaries," lays down the 
law that a contract made so that either party recognizes it from the moment 
of contract, and even not followed by cohabitation, amounts to a valid 
marriage, and also that a contract to be recognized at some future period, 
and followed by consummation, is equally valid. It is unfortunate that 
the law is so undecided in this respect. The decisions arrived at, for 
or against, were not dependent upon any recognized law, but seem to be 
influenced by the character of the cases, either for favor or discountenance. 
As long as the law recognizes cohabitation legal only in marriage, it seems 
to me that if consummated under consent of the parties to bear marital 
relations with each other, or promise of marriage, the act should be 
unhesitatingly pronounced as the equivalent of a valid marriage in all 
instances. If cohabitation is only a marital prerogative, the law should not 
stultify itself by recognizing it as possible to occur in any other relation. 
If either of the parties is merried, the law defines it as adultery, and 
very properly defines the punishment. It is necessary to the progress of 
the age that some such principle should be recognized in common law so 
as not to subject the decision of the question to the individual opinion of 
any judge. It would at once obviate the confusion of sentiment now held 
in regard to it and besides arrest the decision in test cases from mere 
caprice of the tribunal. It is certainly as correct a principle as any in 
common law, and would, in its operations as a statute law, be free from 
injustice, and capable of doing much good.

POLYGAMY -WHAT IT IS. 

Polygamy is a state in which a man has at the same time more than 
one wife. It has existed from time immemorial, especially among the 
nations of the East. The custom was tolerated by the laws of Moses, 
and, in fact, no positive injunction against it is found in the whole of the 
Old Testament. It is (juestionable whether more than one was recog- 
nized as the bona fide wife, the others simply being wives by right of 
concubinage. But if polygamy was in its strictest sense the legal custom, 
it soon grew unpopular, for no trace of it is met in the records of the 
New Testament, where all the passages referring to marriage imply mo- 
nogamy as alone lawful. The custom has been almost universal in the 
East, being sanctioned by all the religions existing there. The religion 
of Mohammed allows four wives, but the permission is rarely exercised 
except by the rich. 

In Christian countries polygatny was never tolerated, the tenets of 
the Church forbidding it, though Charlemagne had two wives, and Sigbert 
and Chilperich also had a plurality. John of Leyden, an Anabaptist 
leader, was the husband of seventeen wives, and he held that it was his 
moral right to marry as many as he chose, 

In England the punishment of polygamy was originally in the hands 
of the ecclesiastics. It was considered a capital crime by Edward I., but 
it did not come entirely under the control of the temporal power until a 
statute of James I. made it a felony, punishable by death. George III. 
made it punishable by imprisonment or transportation for seven years. 

It is the offspring of licentiousness, and its advocates merely wish to 
give legal color to licentious habits. Every student of history will find 
that as soon as a nation became morally depraved, polygamy was prac- 
ticed, and that monogamy was the rule in all countries truly civilized. 

Polygamy has, of late years, been most shamefully revived and out- 
rageously practiced in face of law by the Mormons. They claim it as a 
religious duty, and defend the system by claiming thai unmarried v/omen 
can in the future life reach only the position of angels who occupy in the 
Mormon theocratic system a very subordinate rank, being simply minis- 
tering servants to those more worthy, thus proclaiming that it is a virtual 
necessity of the male to practice the vilest immorality in order to advance 
the female to the highest place in heaven. 

Mormonism is a religion founded by Joseph Smith, who was born in 
Sharon, E. V., Dec. 23rd, 1805, and killed at Carthage, 111., June 27th, 
1844.

THE ladies' book 



It is a most singular fact that a sect like the Mormons could have 
been established in a country peopled with such law-abiding people as of 
the United States, and maintain a system of marriage antagonistic to the 
law and religion of the land. Neither could they have done so if they 
had not possessed two great virtues, tem|)crance and industry. It is to 
be hoi)ed that the legal jjrocess now instituted for its abolition will effec- 
tually remove the bl(H from the national escutcheon. 

The " Oneida Communists " are essentially polygamic, although they 
have no marriage system. They do not marry, and ignore all marriage 
codes. Cohabitation is under no restrictions between the sexes. Mar- 
riage is also not observed among the " Shakers." 

MONOGAMY WHAT IT IS. 

This is the conjugal union of a male with one female only. We 
have seen that monogamy was coequal with civilization, and that most 
probably the majority of the males had but one wife, even among 
polygamic nations. Universal polygamy is practically iini)ossible, the 
scarcity of females and the poverty of the males forbidding it, The 
excess of females is not so great in any country as to allow to each male 
more than one wife, except the male portion is depleted by long and 
disastrous wars. Monogamy has done more for the elevation of the 
female than any other custom of civilization. The rich could only afford 
to practice polygamy, and should the poor imitate the example it would 
necessarily subject the wives to a state of serfdom. In the economy of 
nature it is designed that the male should be the protector of the female, 
and that by his exertions the provision of food and raiment should be 
secured. In polygamous nations the femal'i has not attained that social 
state that she has reached in countries where the male is entitled to but 
one female as his wife. Woman's highest sphere is ^or in the harem or 
zenana, but in that dignified state in which she is the sole connubial 
companion of but one man. It is debasing to her nature, and subversive 
of her dignity in the rank of humanity, to make her the equal only with 
others in the marital union with one male. She becomes only the true, 
noble and affectionate being when she is conscious of a superiority to 
others in the connubial companionship with her accepted one. The 
female bird chirps but for her single mate, and she is pugnaciously 
monogamic, as well as virtuous, allowing neither male or female at or 
near her home. The spirit of independence she gains by being the mate 
of but one male gains for her the victory over the intruders.

The pliysical and men'u.1 welfare of iht; female in also dependent 
upon monogamic marriage. We have demonstrated tl::vt temperate indul- 
gence is conducive to the sanitary condition of the sexes, and that abso- 
lute abstinence is opposed to the designs of nature. It is also evident 
that the male is not endowed with greater power, vigor or capacity than 
the female ; therefore, confinement or limitation of the congress to the 
companionship of one male with one female, as in monogamic marriage, 
gives the healthy balance to the marital union. The polygamic husband 
must either suffer from the consequences of excessive indulgence or his 
wives from poverty of sexual gratification ; probably both would be the 
case. 

POLYANDRY 

is equally as proper as polygamy, yet it never in the history of man 
obtained a foothold. The system is more logical than polygamy, because 
the wife's dependence would be distributed between two or more hus- 
bands, in which case she would be better insured against poverty and 
her support would be guaranteed by greater probability. 

We have now described the history and aspect of the two customs, 
and will conclude the subject by remarking that a man is morally and 
physically entitled to but one wife, and that a plurality is a great wrong to 
the female and in total opposition to the ordinance of nature. Wher- 
ever polygamy is the custom the female is held in slavish subjection. It 
only prospers in proportion to the ignorance of the sex. Intelligent and 
civilized woman will always rebel against such debaaement and servitude.

MARRIAGE CUSTOMS. 

It would probably be interesting to many to de:;cribe the marriage 
ceremonies observed by different nations, but to enter into a descriptive 
detail would occupy too much space. It is suilicient to say that while 
some wives are wooed and won, others are bought and sold ; while in 
some countries the husband brings the wife to his home, in others, as in 
Formosa, the daughter brings her husband to her father's house, and he is 
considered one of the family, while the sons, upon marriage, leave the 
family forever. In civilized countries, the ceremonies are either minis- 
terial or magisterial, and are more or less religious in character ; while in 
others, less civilized, the gaining of a wife depends upon a foot-race, in 
which the female has the start of one-third the distance of the course, as

is the custom in Lapland. In Caffraria, the lover must first fight himself 
into the affections of his ladylove, and if he defeats all his rivals she 
becomes his wife without further ceremony. Among the Congo tribes, a 
wife is taken upon trial for a year, and if not suited to the standard of 
taste of the husband, he returns her to her parents. In Persia, the wife's 
status depends upon her fruitfulness ;• if she be barren, she can be put 
aside. In the same country they have also permanent marriages and 
marriages for a certain period only — the latter never allowed to exceed 
ninety years. 

In fact, the marriage ceremonies differ in nearly all countries. To 
us some may appear very absurd, and yet our customs may be just as 
amazing to them. It matters but little how a conjugal union is effected 
so long as sanctioned by law or custom and it obligates the parties, by 
common opinion, to observe the duties pertaining to married life. 

THE BASIS OF A HAPPY MARRIAGE. 

The state of conjugal union should be the happiest in the whole of 
tlie existence of either man or woman, and is such in a congenial mar- 
riage. Yet in the history of very many marriages contentment or happi- 
ness is palpably absent and an almost insufferable misery is the heritage 
of both ])arties. It is therefore important that previous to the marital 
union the parties should take everything into consideration that fore- 
shadows happiness after marriage, as well as everything calculated to 
despoil conjugal felicity. 

The first requisite of congenial marriage is love. Without being 
cemented by this element the conjugal union is sure to be uncongenial. 
It is tlie strongest bond, the firmest cord, uniting two hearts inseparably 
together. Love for the opposite sex has always been a controlling in- 
fluence with mankind. It is the most elevating of all the emotions and 
the purest and tenderest of all sentiments. It exerts a wonderful power, 
and by its influence the grandest human actions have been achieved. Of 
what infinite worth it is to either sex to be compensated with a worthy 
and satisfying love, and how ennobling to the impulses and actions il is 
to bestow the sentiment upon one worthy to receive and willing to return. 



LOVE IS THE MAINSPRING 



that regulates the harmony of conjugal life, and without it there is a void 
in the machinery, productive only of jars, convulsive movement, and a

grating and inharmonious action. The soul yearns for love and to love, 
and unless the desire is compensated human life is a blank and becomes 
a purposeless existence. Love ever stimulates the good and suppresses 
the bad, if kept in a proper channel and guided by pure affections. 

Another requisite of a happy marriage is health. No person has a 
moral right to engage in wedlock who cannot bring to his partner the 
offering of good health. 

Another consideration is evenness of temper. In the wooing days 
everyone is a lamb, and only becomes the howling wolf after marriage. 
Circumstances that ruffle the temper in the presence of the intended are 
but like the harmless squib, but would become like the explosive torpedo 
in his or her absence or in after-marriage. Quarreling caused by matri- 
monial dilTerences is the most frequent cause of infelicity, and most of 
it is caused by an innate irate temper of either husband or wife. 

The tastes should not Le dissimilar. Some of them may be unim- 
portant, but others are a fruitful source of disagreement. The social wife 
will never be contented with tlie unsocial husband, and the gay husband, 
though his gayety may not be commendable, will always accuse his wife 
if she lacks a social disposition to a great extent. The religious wife will 
never excuse a tendency to irreligion in her husband, and though he may 
be far from being immoral, she is unhappy if he does not participate in 
her devotions. The one devoted to children will never be happy with 
one having a natural repugnance for them. In this way we might multi- 
ply facts illustrative of the importance of an investigation into the simi- 
larity of taste previous to marriage. Great love, however, overcomes 
almost every obstacle. 

THE PARTIES SHOULD BE NEARLY OF ONE AGE. 



"► 



The husband should be the elder. The union of the old husband to the 
young wife, or the reverse, is seldom a happy one. It is seldom that 
such a marriage occurs in which the incentive is not the wealth of either 
of the parties. 

Marriages are usually contracted to gratify various desires, as love, 
fortune or position. The results are more truthfully stated by an emi- 
nent divine in the following : 

" Who marries for love, takes a wife ; who marries for fortune, takes 
a mistress ; who marries for position, takes a lady."

To a man there is but one choice that he can rationally make, a 
marriage of love. My female readers, I hope, will decide rather to wed 
a husband than the master or the elegant gentleman. 

A little foresight, a little prudence, and a little caution will prevent 
in most cases the entrance into a marriage which, by the very nature of 
the alliance, is certain to be an unhappy and improper one.

CHAPTER VIII. 

PREGNANCY -LABOR -PARTURITION. 

Perhaps there is no more eventful period in the history of woman 
than that in which she first becomes conscious that the existence of 
another being is dependent upon her own and that she carries about 
with her the first tiny rudiments of an immortal soul. 

THE SIGNS OF PREGNANCY 

are various. Many females are troubled with colic pains, creeping of the 
skin, shuddering, and fainting fits immediately on conception taking 
place. Where such symptoms occur immediately after connection, they 
are a certain indication of impregnation. 

A REMARKABLE CHANGE 

takes place in the face in most cases, varying in time from three days to 
three months. The eyes are dull and heavy, and present a glassy 
appearance ; the nose pinched up ; the skin becomes pale and livid, and 
the whole countenance appears as if five or ten years' advance in life had 
been taken at a single step. 

Another important and remarkable sign, and one the most to be 
relied on, is an increase in the size of the neck. This often occurs at a 
very early period, and many females, by keeping a careful daily measure- 
ment of the neck, can always tell when they are pregnant. 

A suppression of the menstrual flow is another strong presumptive 
sign. It is true a partial flow of the menses often occurs after pregnancy, 
from the lower part of the womb, but when the flow is suddenly stopped 
without any apparent cause, pregnancy is generally the predisposing 
cause. 

SOON AFTER CONCEPTION 

the stomach often becomes affected with what is called morning sickness. 
On first awaking, the female feels as well as usual, but on rising from her 
bed qualmishness begins and perhaps while in the act of dressing 
retching and vomiting takes place.

This symptom may occur almost immediately after conception, but 
it most frequently commences for the first time between two and three 
weeks after. Now and then it is experienced only during the last six 
weeks or two months of pregnancy, and subsides about the time the 
movements of the child begin to be felt. 

CHANGES IN THE BREAST 

are generally considered as strong signs of pregnancy. When two 
months of pregnancy have been completed, an uneasy sensation of 
throbbing and stretching fullness is experienced, accompanied by 
tingling about the middle of the breasts, centering in the nipples. A 
sensible alteration in their appearance soon follows, they grow larger 
and more firm. The nipple becomes more i)rominent, and the circle 
around its base altered in color and structure, constituting what is called 
the aieola, and as pregnancy advances milk is secreted. 

THE PERIOD OF GESTATION, 

at which these changes may occur, varies much in different females. 
Sometimes, with the exception of the secretion of the milk, they are 
recognized very soon after conception ; in other instances, particularly in 
females of a weakly and delicate constitution, they are hardly preceptible 
until pregnancy is far advanced or even drawing toward its termination. 
The changes in the form and size of the breasts may be the result of 
causes unconnected with pregnancy. They may enlarge in consequence 
of marriage, from the individual becoming stout and fat or from 
accidental suppression of the monthly flow. 

The changes which take place in the nipple, and around its base, 
are of the utmost value as an evidence of pregnancy. 

ABOUT THE SIXTH OR SEVENTH WEEK 

after conception has taken place, if the nipple be examined it will be 
found becoming turgid and prominent, and a circle forming around its 
base, of a color deeper in its shade than rose or flesh color, slightly 
tinged with a yellowish or brownish hue, and here and there upon its 
surface will be seen little prominent points from about ten to twenty in 
number. In the progress of the next six or seven weeks these changes 
are fully developed, the nipple becoming more prominent and turgid than 
ever, the circle around it of larger dimensions, the skin being soft,

bedewed with a slight degree of moisture, frequently staining the linen in 
contact with it ; the little prominences of larger size, and the color of the 
whole very much deepened. 

Calculations of the 



DURATION OF PREGNANCY. 

founded upon what has been observed to occur after casual intercourse, 
or perhaps a single act, in individuals who can have no motive to tell us 
what is false, are likely to be correct. The conclusion drawn from these 
is, that labor usually, but not invariably, comes on about 280 days after 
conception, a mature child being sometimes born before the expiration of 
the forty weeks, and at other times not until that time has been exceeded 
by several days. A case is on record where the pregnancy lasted 287 
days. In this case the labor did not take place until that period had 
elapsed from the departure of the husband for the East Indies, conse- 
quently the period might have been longer than 287 days. 



CHILDBIRTH IS A NATURAL PROCESS, 

and however complicated and painful habits or disease have made it, yet 
the work must be left to nature. Any efforts to assist or Jiurry matters 
will only end in harm. The only cases where interference is justifiable is 
where her powers are exhausted or some malformation exists or malpre- 
sentation occurs. When labor is about to commence, the womb descends 
into the bottom of the belly and the motions and weight of the child will 
be felt much lower down than usual. If in a natural position the bead 
will fall to the mouth of the womb and press upon it. This drives 
forward the membranes which retain the water at the orifice, and at the 
proper moment they break and labor then commences. 

Labor is caused by involuntary contractions of the uterus and 
abdominal muscles. By their force the liquor amnii flows out, the head 
of the fuetus is engaged in the pelvis, it goes through it, and soon passes 
out by the valve, the folds of which disappear. These different phenom- 
ena take place in succession and continue a certain time. They are 
accompanied with pains more or less severe, with swelling and softening 
of the soft parts of the pelvis and external genital parts, and with an 
?,bundant mucous secretion in the cavity of the vagina. All these circum- 
stances, each in its own way, favor the passage of the foetus.

THE LADIES BOOK 



It is proper here to remark that parturition is not necessarily either 
painful or dangerous. It is well known that women in an uncivih'zed 
state suffer very little pain or disablement in bringing forth children. 
Generally neither pregnancy nor labor interrupt the ordinary avocation of 
the mother, except for an hour or two at the birth itself. The suffering 
and debilitating influences that often attend childbirth now are caused by 
our unnatural modes of living and nonattention to the laws of health. 
Numerous well-authenticated instances are known where women who had 
previously suffered with severe labor in childbirth have, by attention to 
health and diet as here shown, been delivered of fine healthy children 
with comparative ease. 

From the 

BEGINNING OF PREGNANCY 

more than ordinary care should be used in taking regular exercise in the 
open air, being careful to avoid fatigue and overexertion. During the 
whole period of pregnancy every kind of agitating exercise, such as run- 
ning. Jumping, jolting in a carriage, and plunging in cold water, should be 
carefully avoided, as W2II as the passions being kept under perfect control. 



M! 
Ml 



IW 



THE DIET 

must chiefly consist of fruits and farinaceous food, as sago, tapioca, rice, 
etc. In proportion as a woman subsists upon aliment which is free from 
earthy and bony matter will she avoid pain and danger in delivery ; 
hence, the more ripe fruit, acid fruit in particular, and the less of other 
kinds of food, but particularly of bread or pastry of any kind, is consumed, 
the less will be the danger and sufferings of childbirth. Nearly all kinds 
of fruit possess two hundred times less ossifying principle than bread or 
anything else made of wheaten flour. 

Honey, molasses, sugar, butter, oil, vinegar, etc., when unadulterated, 
are entirely free from earthy matter. Common salt, pepper, coffee, 
cocoa, spices, and many drugs are much worse than wheaten flour in 
their hardening and bone-forming tendency, and should therefore be avoid- 
ed. The drink should be tea or lemonade made with water, soft and 
clear, and, when practicable, distilled. 

No mother who has adopted this mode of living but has blessed the 
knowledge of it, and it has saved many a young mother from needless 
terror.

In the third month of pregnancy, but not before, the belly begins to 
enlarge or swell, and gradually increases in size till the full term of preg- 
nancy is completed. Between the sixteenth and twentieth week the 
womb rises up into the belly, and the motion of the child is felt, which is 
called 

QUICKENING. 

The first time a woman is with child this sensation of quickening is 
like that of a bird fluttering within her ; at other times she feels a tickling 
or i)ushing sensation, or the child gives a kick or a jump, and this, too, 
with so much energy as to move the petticoats, a book, or any light 
article she may have in her lap. 

It is important to remember these symptoms, and the order in which 
they occur : first, cessation of the menses ; second, morning sickness ; 
third, swelling and darting pains in the breast, and dark color around the 
nipples ; fourth, gradual enlargement of the abdomen or belly ; fifth, the 
movement of the child. 

In ninety-nine cases out of a hundred, if these symptoms are present 
the woman is j)regnant. Pregnant women are generally affected with 
heartburn, sickness of a morning, headache, and that troublesome dis- 
ease, toothache, which accompanies pregnancy ; all of which may usual y 
be avoided by keejiing the bowels gently open with seidlitz powders, 
caster oil, or pills of rhubarb, which should be taken occasionally, either 
alone or in combination with colocynth and soap. A clyster made of 
warm soapsuds will often be sufficient if repeated every few days ; or 
senna and manna; and if there is any aversion to taking medicine, give 
some simple articles, such as roasted apples, figs, prunes, or anything that 
will quiet the stomach and prevent costiveness of the bowels. 



THE TOOTHACHE 

often complained of by pregnant women, and which may occur at 
any period, is seldom relieved by extraction, having its seat in the ad- 
jacent nerves of the face or jaws, and is neuralgic. The teeth ought not 
to be drawn during pregnancy, unless urgently required, but should be 
relieved by applying hot fomentations to the face, as a camomile poul- 
tice. Rubbing the jaw externally with spirits of camphor or laudanum, 
or applying mustard plasters or blisters behind the ears, will afford relief.

THE CRAMPS OF THE LEGS. ETC., 

in pregnancy, caused by the pressure of the enlarged womb on the nerves, 
are often troublesome, but not attended with any danger, and may be 
speedily relieved by a change of posture, and friction, or rubbing with 
opodeldoc, spirits of camphor, or hot whisky and salt. Palpitation of the 
heart occurs frequently, and usually about the period of quickening. In 
general, it is the result of a disordered stomach and may be relieved by 
attention to diet and moderate doses of magnesia and Epsom salts, of 
equal quantities. 

THE PALPITATrON OF THE HEART 

may be produced by a morbid state of the nerves, and is then termed 
hysterical. Attention in all such cases should be paid to the diet, air, 
exercise, etc , with the view of improving the strength, the bowels being 
kept open by mild means. All exciting or agitating subjects should be 
carefully avoided, and the mind of the pregnant woman kept calm and 
tranquil ; for the mind, in the early stages of pregnancy, exercises the 
most powerful influence over the child through life ; and how many 
peculiar traits of character have been indelibly fixed upon their offspring 
from these exciting causes is evident in many families. 

When the palpitation occurs from the state of the nerves, as before 
described, producing uncomfortable feelings, a teaspoonful of the tincture 
of castor or asafretida, with an equal quantity of compound spirits of 
lavender, mixed in a little water, will seldom fail to afford relief, which 
may, if necessary, be repeated on its recurrence. 

MORNING SICKNESS 

is one of the most painful feelings attendant on the pregnant state, and 
it is one of those which medicine commonly fails to relieve. A cup of 
camomile or peppermint tea, taken when first awaking, and suffering the 
patient to be still for an hour, will frequently alleviate the distressing 
sickness ; but should it recur during the day, and if these means fail, two 
or three teaspoonfuls of the following mixture should then be taken either 
occasionally or, when the vomiting and hea'-tburn are more continual, 
immediately after each meal : 

Take of — 

Calcined magnesia, . . , One dram ; 

Distilled water, Six ounces ; 

Aromatic tincture of rhatany, . . . . Six drams ; 

Water of pure ammonia, One dram.

Mix. The anxiety and sometimes despondency of mind — in other words, 
lowness of spirits — to which pregnant women are more or less liable 
greatly depends on the state of their general health and the natural tem- 
per and character of the individual ; but it can be greatly aggravated, 
and may often be excited by circumstances or officious persons. Let me, 
then, urge upon you the important necessity of keeping the mind as tran- 
quil and cheerful as possible, particularly during the first four months of 
pregnancy. A judicious course of this kind will produce the most bene- 
ficial and well-balanced mind in the child ; while, if the contrary, a 
desponding and nervous temperament, with many other peculiarities, will 
be the consequence. 

SURE TEST FOR THE DETECTION OF PREGNANCY. 

M. Nauche has found that the urine of pregnant women contains a 
particular substance, which, when the urine is allowed to stand, separates 
and forms a pellicle on the surface. M. Enguiser, from an extensive 
series of observations, has confirmed the fact, and ascertained that kis- 
teine, as this particular substance has been called, is constantly formed 
on the surface of the urine of women in a state of pregnancy. The urine 
must be allowed to stand for from two to six days, when minute opaque 
bodies are observed to rise from the bottom to the surface of the fluid, 
where they gradually unite and form a continuous layer over the surface. 
This layer is so consistent that it may be almost lifted off by raising it 
by one of its edges. This is the kisteine. It is whitish, opalescent, 
slightly granular, and can be compared to nothing better than the fatty 
substance which floats on the surface of soups after they have been 
allowed to cool. When examin'^d by the microscope, it has the aspect of 
a gelatinous mass without determinate form ; sometimes cubical shaped 
crystals are discovered on it, but this appearance is only observed when 
it has stood a long time, and is to be regarded as foreign to it. The 
kisteine remains on the surface for several days ; the urine then becomes 
turbid, and small opaque masses become detached from the kisteine and 
fall to the bottom of the fluid and the pellicle soon becomes destroyed. 

The essential character of the urine of pregnancy, then, is the pres- 
ence of the kisteine ; and the characters of the pellicle are so peculiar 
that it is impossible to mistake it for anything else, A pellicle sometimes

There exists, likewise, a very marked difference between its mucous 
aspect and that of kisteine ; a difference which is difficult to describe, but 
which is easily recognized. 

Kisteine appears to exist in the urine from the first month of preg- 
nancy till delivery. It has even been recognized in the urine of a few 
gravid animals.

ABORTION. 

Abortion, or miscarriage, means, in plain language, a woman losing 
her child previous to the seventh month of her pregnancy; that is, before 
its due time. ^Vhen this occurs after that period it is called 

PREMATURE LABOR. 

Miscarriage involves pain and weakness in addition to the loss of 
offspring, and is often a severe trial to the maternal constitution. It may 
occur at any period of pregnancy, but particular stages are more liable to 
the accident than others. These are generally considered to be about 
the time of the first menstruation after conception ; again at the twelfth 
week, and toward the seventh month ; and the liability is increased at 
those times which correspond to the menstrual period. When abortion 
has once taken place it is more likely to occur again, and some have so 
strong a tendency to it that they never go beyond a certain stage, but 
then invariably miscarry.

THE CAUSE OF ABORTION 

may exist in the constitution of the female herself, being the result of 
weakness and irritability, or of an overfall habit or a diseased condition 
of the womb ; or the foetus, or child, may die or be deficient in develop- 
ment, when it is cast off like a blighted fruit. Suckling af*er conception 
has taken place is not infrequently a cause of miscarriage. Active 
diseases occurring during pregnancy, such as fever?, severe inflammation, 
eruptive fevers, etc., are almost certain to occasion the expulsion of the 
uterine contents. Continued diarrhoea and the action of strong purgative 
medicines, j^articularly the aloetic, are dangerous. This is a very good 
reason for those who are pregnant avoiding all quack aperient medicines ; 
they almost all contain aloes, and may be very injurious. All undue 
exertion or agitation of body or mind, sudden jerks or jumps, riding on 
horseback in the early stage, or in a shaking carriage in the latter stages 
of pregnancy, may any of them bring on miscarriage. To these may be 
added : exertion of the arms in doing anything on a level above the 
head ; costive bowels and straining consequent therein ; sexual 
indulgence, or, in plain language, too much connection with your 
husband ; and luxurious habits. Those who have once suffered from 
abortion ought to be extremely careful during succeeding pregnancies, 
and all ought to bear in mind the possibility of the occurrence. 

THE SYMPTOMS OF THREATENED ABORTION 

vary with the constitution. In the strong and plethoric it is often 
preceded by shivering and febrile symptoms and by a feeling of weight 
in the lower bowels. In the weak there is languor, faintness, flaccidity 
of the breasts, general depression, and pains in the back and loins. 
Intermittent pains, and discharge of blood from the passage, tell that the 
process has begun. If miscarriage occurs within the first month or two 
after conception, the process may be accomplished with so little incon- 
venience as to escape notice and be mistaken for a menstrual period. 
More generally, however, the severity of the pain and an unusual clotted 
discharge of blood render the case evident. The pain, the discharge, 
and, at the same time, the danger of an abortion, are in proportion to the 
advancement of the pregnancy. When a miscarriage goes on, the pains 
increase in force and frequency, and continue, with discharge of blood, 
fluid or in clots, until the ovum, or first formation of the child, is expelled ; 
after which both become moderated till they cease altogether and the

red flow gives place to a colorless one. It is very important that those 

in attendance upon the patient should examine every clot that comes 

away. If large, tear it in pieces, that they may ascertain whether the 

contents of the womb are expelled or not, for there is no safety or rest, 

where miscarriage is progressing, till it has taken place and everything 

is cast off. 

AS SOON AS A FEMALE 

experiences threatenings of abortion she ought at once to retire to bed, 
upon a mattress, and keep perfectly quiet till every symptom has 
disappeared. Sometimes this simjile measure, promptly adopted, is suffi- 
cient to avert the threatened evil. If there is much feeling of fullness, and 
the patient is of full habit generally, eight or a dozen leeches may be 
applied to the lower part of the bowels ; if there is fever, saline medicines 
may be given, such as the common effervescing draft of carbonate of soda 
and tartaric acid or lemon juice; or, if the bowels are much confined, seidlitz 
powders, assisting the action by cold clysters, if necessary. When the 
pains are severe, particularly in the weak and irritable, twenty or thirty 
drops of laudanum should be given, and may be repeated in a few hours 
if the symptoms are not improved. In the case of profuse discharge, the 
patient should be kept very lightly covered, movement avoided, and every 
article of food or drink given cold, or iced if possible, provided the vital 
powers are not excessively reduced. Cloths dipped in cold or iced water 
should also be applied to the lower part of the body and frequently 
changed. Acid drinks, with cream of tartar, may be freely given. Ten 
or fifteen drops of elixir vitriol may be given in a wineglassful of water 
every two or three hours. Should slight faintness come on, it is better 
not to interfere with it, but use outward remedies — camphor, cold water, 
vinegar, etc.— as they maybe salutary. If it reaches to an extent to 
threaten life, stimulants, as brandy and water, and others, must 
be had recourse to. Profuse and continued discharge, though it may not 
threaten life, must occasion a weakness which will take a long time to 
overcome, and which may ultimately, if not properly attended to, 
promote the development of other diseases of the womb. 



J 



IF THE FLOODING IS PROFUSE 

and uncontrolled by the means before mentioned, one grain and a half of 
sugar of lead may be given every two or three hours, and washed down 
with a drink of vinegar and water, to which, if there is much pain, add 
from five to ten drops of laudanum.

Pieces of linen or cotton cloth should be soaked In a strong solution 
of alum, or a decoction of oak bark, and then well oiled ; with this cloth 
plug the passage or birthplace ; or, some of this astringent wash may be 
thrown up with a syringe. 

But, during the time and after miscarriage, the general strength must 
be supported by a strengthening diet, such as soups, meat, etc., avoiding 
stimulants as much as possible. Nevertheless, in some cases wine or 
malt liquors may be necessary in convalescence, or when recovering, and 
if so may be assisted by tonic or strengthening medicines, such as contain 
mineral acid. Hark or iron are generally given as the most appropriate 
remedies. The bowels will, in some cases, recpiire strict attfntion, as 
indeed they do throughout, and for this purpose castor oil is a good 
medicine, or clysters of cold or tepid water are most useful. A teaspoon- 
ful of Epsom salts dissolved in half a pint of water, either cold or slightly 
warmed, to which add fifteen drops of elixir vitriol, forms a most excel- 
lent and mild i)urgative, which should be taken before breakfast. In all 
cases where the constitution of the woman has a tendency to miscarriage 
or abortion, a quiet state of mind should be observed, avoiding all violent 
exertions, particularly lifting heavy weights. These principles of treatment 
are to be kept in mind in the management of miscarriage : 

The first, to prevent it, if poss^ible, by rest, opiates, etc. 

The second, to allay pain, moderate the discharge of blood, and to 
save and support the strength of the patient. 

The third, when abortion must take place, to expedite the separation 
of the ovum and free the contents of the womb. This is generally done 
by simply occasionally drinking cold water, and in JifHcult cases, if neces- 
sary, by the administration of spurred rye. The dose is a strong infusion 
or tea given every twenty or thirty minutes until the desired effect is 
produced, as long as the stomach will bear it. 

The health of pregnant females should at all times be an object of 
great care and interest ; and they should be impressed with the conviction 
that while

they may, by proper care and attention, lay the foundation for their 
future health and that of their offspring ; while by neglect and impru- 
dence in this matter, they may not only enfeeble their constitution, but 
entail upon their children an inheritance of infirmity and disease.

Miscarriage, or abortion, which includes all cases in which delivery 
takes place before the sixth month, seldom occurs without being pre- 
ceded, or accompanied, or followed, by a morbid discha.ge of blood 
from the womb, which is commonly known by the name of flooding. 
Abortion, or miscarriage, takes place with the first pregnancy, and during 
the first two months ; therefore, great care should be observed during 
this period, as any cause which either destroys the life of the child in the 
womb or brings on morbid or premature contractions in that organ may 
induce miscarriage. Coughing severely, or vomiting, a blow or fall, or a 
.nisstep leading to an effort to prevent falling, may, and does frequently, 
result in miscarriage ; and this having once occurred, it is, without proper 
care, exceedingly liable to be the case again at the same period of a 
subsequent pregnancy. The same result may follow any vivid moral 
impression ; for fright, or mental excitement by passion, or witnessing any 
accident, will be found often to end in miscarriage. In some healthy 
females, however, it occurs without any other cause than mere fullness ot 
blood. A bleeding from the womb is often in such cases a first symptom 
of abortion, and should be attended to as early as possible before it goes 
to any considerable extent. The amount of flooding, in most cases, is in 
proportion to the early period of pregnancy at which it takes place, for 
in the latter months there is seldom much blood lost. But there are cases 
in which pregnant women will lose blood repeatedly from the womb and 
yet not miscarry, but these are very rare cases. 

In most cases, the occurrence of a woman's flooding between the 
first and fourth months, unless very slight, or quickly relieved, is usually 
followed by a miscarriage ; but as soon as the child and its • lembranes 
are both expelled by the contraction of the womb the flooding soon 
ceases. In many such cases it is often very difficult, and sometimes 
impossible, to deliver the afterbirth and membranes, which remain and 
finally pass off after i)utrefaction has taken place, resulting in long and 
offensive discharges from the womb, and which, unless treated by the 
most skillful management, frequently result in many internal mischiefs of 
a serious character, such as ulcers, cancers, etc. 

In all cases, those who are constitutionally disposed to abortion, or 
have a tendency to miscarriage, should take great care to preserve a quiet 
state of mind and to avoid all violent exertion ; and all active purgatives 
should be avoided, and expos, re to great heat or cold, during the time of 
gestation or pregnancy.

When the miscarriage has really taken place, and the fcetus, or child, 
is expelled, together with the contents of the womb, the same precautions 
should in general be observed as in childbirth. 

TO PREVENT MISCARRIAGE, 

when it is threatened, or on ti,e appearance of the first symptoms, the 
patient should lie down and be as quiet as possible ; live on very light 
diet ; bowels be kept freely open ; and an injection of thirty drops of 
laudanum should be given in half a pint of slippery elm tea. Should 
flooding be present, cold lemonade should be drank freely, and cloths 
wet with cold or ice water applied to the thighs and lower part of the 
birthplace, which should be repeated until the flooding is relieved. 

MEANS OF PREVENTING ABORTION. 

To prevent abortion, women of weak or relaxed habit should use 
solid food, avoiding great quantities of tea, coffee, or other weak or 
watery liquors. They should go soon to bed and rise early, and take 
frequent exercise, but avoid fatigue. They should occasionally take half a 
pint of the decoction of lignum-vitae, boiling an ounce of it in a quart of 
water for five minutes. 

If of a full habit, they ought to use a spare diet and chiefly of the 
vegetable kind, avoiding strong liquors and everything that may tend to 
heat the body or increase the quantity of blood ; and when the symptoms 
appear, should take a dram of powdered nitre in a cup of water gruel 
every five or six hours. 

In both cases the patient should sleep on a hard mattress and be 
kept cool and quiet ; the bowels should be kept regular by a pill of white 
walnut extract or bitterroot.

CHAPTER IX. 



MENSTRUATION. 

Though this is not a disease, but a healthy function, and as, from 
various causes, derangement of the function occurs, it is proper that it 
should be perfectly understood. Menstruation is the term applied to the 
phenomenon that attends the rupture of what is called the Graafian 
follicles of the ovaries and the discharge of an ova, or egg. It is a bloody 
discharge from the female genitals ; not differing from ordinary blood, 
excepting that it does not coagulate, and in its peculiar odor. The blood 
comes from the capillaries of the womb and vagina. 

MENOPHANIA. OR THE FIRST APPEARANCE 

of the menses, is usually preceded by a discharge of a *luid whitish 
matter from the vagina, by nervous excitement, and by vagut pains and 
heaviness in the loins and thighs, numbness of the limbs, and swelling 
and hardness of the breasts. The first appearance is an evidence of 
capacity for conception. It generally appears aboiit the age of fourteen, 
but varies from nine to twenty four years. In warm climates women 
begin to menstruate earlier and cease sooner than in temperate regions ; 
in the cold climates the reverse of this holds as a general rule. The 
manifestations of approaching puberty are seen in the development of the 
breasts, the expansion of the hips, the rounded contour of the body and 
limbs, appearance of the purely feminine figure, development of the voice, 
and the child becomes reserved and exchanges her plays for the pursuits 
of womanhood. 

More or less indisposition and irritability also precede each succes- 
sive recurrence of the menstrual flux, such as headache, lassitude, uneasi- 
ness, pain in back, loins, etc. The periods succeed each other usually 
about every twenty-eight days, although it may occur every twenty-two, 
twenty, eighteen, fifteen, or thirty-two, thirty-five, or forty days. The 
most important element is the regularity of the return. In temperate 
climates each menstrual period ordinarily continues from three to six 
days, and the quantity lost from four to eight ounces. The menses 
continue to flow from the period of puberty till the age of forty-five or

135 



fifty. At the time of its natural cessation the flow becomes irregular, 
and this irregularity is accompanied occasionally by symptoms of 
dropsy, glandular swellings, etc., constituting the critical period, turn 
or change of life ; yet it does not appear that mortality is increased by it, 
as vital statistics show that more men die between forty and fifty than 
women. 

It should be the 



- 



DUTY OF EVERY MOTHER 

or fema'e in charge of a child in whom age or actual manifestations 
suggest the approach of puberty to acquaint her with the nature of her 
visitation and the importance of her conduct in regard to it. She should 
be taught that it is perfectly natural to all females at a certain period, and 
that its arrival necessitates caution on her part with regard to exposure to 
wet or cold. The author has made the acquaintance of the history of 
many cases of consumption and other diseases which were directly 
induced by folly and ignorance at the first menstrual flow. The child is 
often kept in extreme .gnorance of the liability of womanhood occurring 
to her at a certain age, and, hence, when she observes a flow of blood 
escaping from a part, the delicacy attached to the locality makes her 
reticent with regard to inquiry or exposure ; she naturally becomes 
alarmed, and most likely attempts to stanch the flow by bathing or 
applying cold water to the part, thus doing incalculable mischief 

This purely feminine physiological function should be well studied 
and understood by all females. At least, they should know that the 
phenomenon is a r.atural one, liable to disorder, and that the best 
interests of their general health demands care and prudence on their 
part to maintain regularity, etc., of the flow. Disregard of such a duty 
will surely entail much misery. 

DELAYED AND ORSTRUCTED MENSTRUATION. 

When the menses do not appear at the time when they may 
naturally be expected, we call it delayed or obstructed menstruation. It 
is, however, of great importance to know whether a girl is sufficiently 
developed to make it necessary for the menses to appear, although she 
may have reached the proper age. As long as the girl has not increased 
physically, if she has not become wider across the hips, if her breasts 
have not become enlarged, and if she experience none of the changes 
incident to this period, an effort to force nature is positively injurious. 



136 



THE LADIES BOOK 



In this case a general treatment will be called for. She should be 
required to exercise freely in the open air, retire early to bed and rise 
at an early hour in the morning. She should not be allowed to be 
closely confined to school, if attending. Her diet should be generous, 
but free from all rich food, which will disorder the stomach. If, how- 
ever, she is fully developed, and she suffers from time to time from con- 
gestions of the head, breast or abdomen, it will be necessary to interfere. 
The following are symptoms which will generally be found in these cases: 
Headache, weight, fullness, and throbbing in the center of the cranium 
and in the back part of the head ; pains in the back and loins ; cold feel 
and hands, becoaiing sometimes very hot ; skin harsh and dry ; slow 
pulse, and not infrequently attended with epilepsy. 

TREATMENT. 

It is well for the patient, a few days before the period, to take a warm 
hip bath or foot bath twice a day, and at night, when retiring, to apply 
cloths wet in warm water to the lower part of the abdomen. 

The bowels should be kept open by some mild catharsis, as castor 
oil or a pill of aloes. If there is pain and fullness of the head during 
the discharge, or before it, use the following : 

Tincture of aconite leaves, . . . . . . Two drams ; 

Tincture of belladonna, One dram ; 

Tincture of cantharides, . . . . . . One dram ; 

Morphia, Three grains ; 

Simple syrup Quarter ounce. 

Mix. Dose : One teaspoonful three times a day. If the pain is severe 
it may be taken every two hours. 

Between the monthly periods, if the system is weak, the following 
may be taken : 

Precip. carbonate of iron, Five drnms ; 

Extract of conium Two drams ; 

Balsam Peru One dram ; 

Alcohol, . . Four ounces ; 

Oil wintergreen, Twenty drops ; 

Simple syrup, Eight ounces. 

Dose : Two teaspoonfuls three times a day. Shake the mixture before 
using.

CHLOROSIS, OR GREEN SICKNESS. 

This disease generally occurs in young r.nmarried females who are 
weak and delicate. It manifests itself about the age of puberty, and is 
accompanied by feeble appetite and digestion. There is no menstrual 
discharge, or else it is very slight. 

It is caused by innutritions food and residence in damp and ill- 
ventilated apartments. It may be hered:*: .ry, all the females of the family 
being liable to the same disease. Those who drink largely of tea, coffee, 
diluted acids, bad wines, and indulge in tight lacing, are predisposed 
to this disease. Among the exciting causes may be mentioned disturbing 
emotions, unrequited love, homesickness, depression of spirits, etc. 
When we lake into consideration the fact that the cause of the disease is 
impoverishment of the blood, the treatment will not be difficult. 



TREATMENT. 

Exercise freely m the open air ; protect the body from chilliness with 
warm clothing and plenty of it. The patient should sleep on a mattress 
in a well-ventilated room. The diet should be nourishing without being 
stimulating. It is important that the habits should ue regular and the 
mind kept cheerful by society and innocent amusements. Before the 
medical treatment is commenced the exciting causes of the disease must 
be removed. A complete change must be made in the existence of the 
patient. If she is confined closely at school, she must be removed ; if she 
is inclined to confine herself to the house, send her to the country. 
Picture to her the danger she is in by the continuance of such a life ; g\\ e 
her plenty of outdoor exercise. The mental and moral causes are the 
most difficult to remove, but a change of scenery and new friends will da 
much towards it. For those who are shut up in factories, or who work 
all day in a stooping position, a change of employment must be made. 
A bath of tepid water in th morning, followed by a brisk rubbing, will 
be beneficial ; also the frequent use of the sitting-bath, and the sponge 
bath in the evening. Active exercise should precede and follow all baths. 
During menstruation all applications of water should be omitted. The 
following remedies are recommended by a famous Philadelphian doctor. 
They are to be taken on alternate days ; that is, take No. i one day. 
No. 2 the next day, etc.: 

No. I. — Precip. carbonate of iron, five drams; extract of coniura, 
two drams ; balsam Peru, one dram ; oil cinnamon, twenty drops ; simple

syrup, eight ounces ; pulverized gum arabic, two drams. Mix. Dose : 
Two teaspoonfuls three times a day, every other day, after meals. Shake 
before using. 

No. 2. — Tincture of nux vomica, one dram ; syrup iodide of iron, one 
ounce ; simple syrup, four ounces. Mix. Dose : One teaspoonful three 
times a day, every other day, after meals. 

Another treatment is as follows : 

Clear the bowels with the following mixture : Sulphate of magnesia, 
one ounce ; nitrate of potash, ten grains ; extract of liquorice, one scruple; 
compound infusion of senna, five and one-half ounces ; tincture of jalap, 
three drams ; spirit of sal volatile, one dram. Mix. Dose : Two or 
three tablesj)oonfals at a time, at intervals of two hours until an effect is 
produced. This is to be followed by sulphate of iron, five grains ; extract 
of gentian, ten grains. Make into three pills and take a pill twice a day, 
with the compound aloes or rhubarb pill every night. 

PROFUSE MENSTRUATION - MENORRHAGIA. 

By menorrhagia we understand an immoderate flow of the menses. 
There is no fixed amount of blood which is lost at the menstrual period, 
but it varies in different women. It will average, however, from four to 
eight ounces. The quantity discharged may be estimated by the number 
of napkins used. Each napkin will contain about half an ounce, or one 
tablespoonful, so that eight napkins would contain four ounces ; twenty, 
ten ounces ; etc. In some females the discharge may be excessive with- 
out impairment of the general health. 

Some females are predisposed to uterine hemorrhages, from a relaxed 
or flabby state of the texture of the uterus. Frequent childbearing, 
abortion, high living, too prolonged and frequent suckling, may induce 
flooding. Among the exciting causes we may mention overexertion, 
dancing, falls, lifting heavy weights, cold, and mental excitement. 



i 



III! 



TREATMENT. 

The patient must lie down on a hard bed, and abstain from all 
stimulating food and drinks. The room should be cool and she should 
be lightly covered with bedclothes. Soak the feet in warm water, and if 
the flowing is excessive apply cloths wrung out in vinegar and water to 
the lower bowels. The hips must be elevated higher than the head. 
Only in extreme cases should plugging be resorted to. This may be done

by pieces of linen, about kour inches square, thrust into the vagina until 
it is full, and a bandage applied between the legs. Cold hip baths and 
vaginal injections of cold water will be beneficial when the hemorrhage is 
slight. 

Use also the following : 

Diluted sulphuric acid, Two drams ; 

Syrup of orange peel Two ounces ; 

Cinnamon water, One ounce. 

Mix, Dose : A teaspoonful in a wineglassful of water, two or three 
times a day. 

If there is much pain administer the following every two or three 
hours : 

Morphia, Quarter grain ; 

Cayenne, Four grains ; 

Rosin, Four grains. 

Mi:*-, Give in blackberry syrup.

PAINFUL MENSTRUATION -MENSTRUAL COLIC — 
DYSMENORRHEA. 

Dysmenorrhea means a difficult monthly flow, and is always pre- 
ceded by severe pains in the back and lower part of the abdomen. It 
is caused by taking cold during the period ; fright, violent mental 
emotions, obstinate constipation, sedentary occupations, smallness of the 
mouth and neck of the womb. Females subject to this trouble are 
generally relieved by marriage. The symptoms are severe bearing-down' 
pains in the region of the uterus, like labor pains ; restlessness, coldness, 
flashes of heat, with headache ; aching in the small of the back, lower 
part of the abdomen, and thighs ; the discharge is scanty, and contains 
shreds of fiber and clotted blood. 



TREATMENT. 

The patient should immediately go to bed and cover up warmly. 
Stimulating food and drinks should be avoided. Use a warm foot bath 
and sitting-bath, with hot poultices of hops or cloths wet in hot water 
applied to the abdomen. 

In the interval of the menses, take active exercise, with a tepid hip 
bath three nights in the week, injecting some of the water high up in the

vagina. Keep the bowels open by a pill of aloes and myrrh, and take 
a small teaspoonful of the volatile tincture of guiacum three times a day, 
in water. On the approach of the period, take the following at night : , 

Calomel, Three grains ; 

Opium, One grain. 

In the morning a dose of caster oil, and on the appearance of the menses, 
the Dover's Powder and mixture as before. Repeat this treatment, in 
each interval, until i.armanently relieved. 

The following is recommended by an eminent physician, to be taken 
a few days before the period : 

Acetous tincture of colchicum, . . . . Three drams ; 

Magnesia, One dram ; 

Sulphate of magnesin, Three drams ; 

Distilled mint or cinnamon water, . . Four ounces. 

Mix. Dose : A small wineglassful every two or three hours until 
it operates. This should be preceded the night before by a small dose 
of blue pill. 



i 



SUPPRESSION OF THE MENSES — AMENORRHCZA. 

By suppression is meant a disappearance of the menses after they 
have become established, and may be either acute or chronic. It is 
caused by cold caught during the flow, by exposure to night air or by 
wetting the feet ; fear, shocks, violent mental emotions, anxiety, fevers 
and other acute diseases. Chronic suppression may be either a conse- 
quence of the acute, or caused by delicate health ; also, from diseases of 
the ovaries or womb. It may also be occasioned by an imperforate 
hymen, in which case it must be cut open by a physician. 



I i\ 



TREATMENT. 

When the suppression is caused by some disease in the system, that 
disease must be cured before the menses will return. For sudden sup- 
pression, use the warm sitting-bath or foot bath. Apply cloths wet in 
warm water to the lower part of the abdomen, and drink freely of warm 
water. If the suppression is chronic and the patient is delicate, in the 
interval between the menses use the shower or the full bath of cold or 
tepid water, rubbing the body briskly with a coarse towel, especially 
around the abdomen, loins, and genital organs.

As soon as the discharge lias ceased, a warm hip bath will generally 
bring it on. If there is ranch inflammation of the uterus, give the fol- 
lowing : 

Tincture aconite leaves Two drams ; 

Sweet spirits of nitre, One ounce ; 

Simple syrup, Three ounces. 

Dose : One teaspoonful every two or three hours. 

If the discharge cannot be brought on, wait until the next period. 
A few days before the term the bowels should be freely opened and kept 
open until the period for the di.>charge has arrived. A pill of aloes and 
iron is one of the best that can be given. Give from one to three pills 
daily. If there is no evident reason for the discharge not appearing, 
such as pregnancy, inflammation of the neck of the womb, and the 
woman is suffering from the suppression, use the following : 

Caulophyllin, One dram ; 

Extract aconite, . . Eight grains ; 

Aloes Ten grains ; 

Sulphate of iron, Ten grains. 

Make into forty pills. Dose : Two or three pills, taken night and 
morning. 

The remedies should always be taken a few days before the period 
arrives for the menses. If the chronic suppression is the result of any 
acute disease, the health must first be re-established, otherwise it would 
be wrong to force the menses. When this has been done, immediately 
before the return of the period a warm hip bath should be taken every 
night for six nights, and one of the following pills taken three times a day: 

Fresh powdered ergot of rye, . . . . Fifty grains ; 

Barbadoes aloes, Twelve grains ; 

Essential oil of juniper, Twelve drops. 

Make into twelve pills with syrup or mucilage, washing down each pill 
with a cupful of pennyroyal tea. 

CESSATION OF THE MENSES -CHANGE OF LIFE. 

By the phrase, " change of life," or, the critical period, we understand 
the final cessation, or stoppage, of the menses. It usually takes place 
between the ages of forty and fifty, although in some cases it may occur 
as early as thirty, and in others not until sixty. However, we can expect 
the change about the forty-fifth year.

The symptoms will vary according to the constitution of the woman. 
In some the change occurs by the discharge gradually diminishing in 
quantity; in others, by the intervals between the periods being lengthened. 
A woman may pass this period without having any more unpleasant 
symptoms than an occasional rush of blood to the head, or a headache. 
Others, however, may have very severe symptoms arise, which will 
recpiire the care of an intelligent physician. These disagreeable sensa- 
tions should receive a careful consideration and not be hushed up with 
the reply that these complaints arise from the " change of life " and will 
vanish whenever that change takes place. The foundation of serious 
trouble may be laid which will make the remainder of her existence a 
burden and cut short a life which might have been conducted to a good 
old age. While this change is in progress, in probably the majority of 
cases there is more or less disturbxnce of the health. It is sometimes 
quite impossible to say exactly what is the trouble with the patient, except 
that she is out of health. The following are some of the symptoms which 
may arise : Headache, dizziness, biliousness, sour stomach, indigestion, 
diarrhcea, piles, costiveness, itching of the private parts, cramp and 
colic of the bowels, palpitation of the heart, swelling of the limbs and 
abdomen, pains in the back and loins, paleness and general weakness. 

TREATMENT. 

Eat and drink moderately ; sleep in airy, well-vei;tihted rooms ; 
exercise daily in the open air, either by walking or riding ; avoid violent 
emotions ; shun exposure to wet, stormy weather, wet feet, etc. 

Keep the bowels regulated with the following : 

Mercurial pill, one grain ; ipecac powder, one-half grain ; compound 
rhubarb pill, three grains. Mix for a pill to be taken every night. 

Or, one ounce of hicra picra, or powdered aloes with castella, mixed 
in a pint of gin, which should stand for four or five days, after which a 
tablespoonful in a glass of water may be taken every morning or second 
morning, as the case may be. 

If the patient is large and fleshy, of full habit, the following is 
recommended : 

Sulphate of magnesia, one and one-half ounces ; compound infusion 
of roses, five ounces; cinnamon water, one ounce. Mix. Dose: Two 
tablespoonfuls once a day.

If there are nervous symptoms prominent, give valerianate of zinc, 
eight grains ; tincture of valerian, two drams ; orange flower water, three 
and a half ounces ; syrup of red poppies, two drams. Mix. Dose : A 
tablespoonful every six hours. 

FALLING OF THE WOMB 

(Prolapsus iiti-ri ). 

Falling of the womb is simply a sinking down of the organ, and may 
be so slight as not to be noticed or so great that the organ will protrude 
between the legs through the external opening. It is not a disease of the 
womb itself, but of some of its supports. 

So long as the vagina retains its natural size and the ligaments are 
but two and a half inches long the organ will not be displaced. What- 
ever tends to relax and weaken the system may cause the complaint. The 
muscles of the abdomen which support the intestines being weakened 
from any cause will allow the intestines to press down upon the womb 
and its ligaments, and, in consequence of this constant pressure, they give 
way. Another cause is too early exercise after childbearing. Flooding 
and leucorrhoea, or whites, if allowed to continue for a long time, will 
produce it ; in delicate females, continued running up and down stairs, 
also tight lacing, dancing, leaping, and running, particularly during the 
period of menstruation, when the womb is increased in weight by the 
blood contained in it. Tiie use of medicines to loosen the bowels, which 
is very common among many, is still another cause of the disorder. 

Most females who are troubled with falling of the womb think that 
it is necessary to a cure that they should wear some kind of a support to 
the abdomen. These supporters, however, do a vast amount of harm, for 
by being worn tightly around the abdomen they increase the pressure on 
the bowels, tnus forcing down, more and more, the womb and its append- 
ages. All that is necessary is to raise up the womb to its natural position, 
and use an instrument that will keep it in place. This instrument is called 
a pessary. This pessary is a ring or hollow cup-shaped globe, made of 
gold, silver, ivory, wood or gutta-percha, and is placed in the vagina or 
birthplace, thus supporting the womb. The cold hip bath should be 
used once a day, at the same time injecting cold water into the vagina 
with a syringe. Lie down as much as possible, and avoid becoming 
fatigued. Apply cold bandages to the abdomen on going to bed. 

If the womb hps descended to the external orifice it is often neces 
sary to restore it to its natural position by pressing it upward and back-

ward by a finger or two pressed into the vagina. If the process be 
accompanied with pain, the vagina should be well washed by injections 
of thick flax seed or slippery elm bark tea for a day or two before the 
astringent washes are used. 

Avoid tight corsets and heavy skirts, suspond the undergarments 
from the shoulders and not from the waist, as is usually done. Use i)lain 
vegetable diet, and avoid tea, coffee, spirituous drinks, and all sensual 
indulgences. Allow the clothes to be loose. These things must b»» 
attended to closely. The diet should be plain and nourishing, but 
stimulating. 

Use an injection of an infusion of white oak bark, geranium, or a 
solution of alum, in the proportion of on«; ounce to the pint of water. If 
there is inflammation of the womb, this must be subdued before using the 
pessary. Give tincture of aconite, compound i)owder .;f ipecac and 
opium, with injections of an infusion of hops and lubelia, or an infusion 
of belladonna. 

If there is heat and difiiculty in passing water, drink an infusion of 
marsh mallow and spearmint. If the patient is weak, give the following 
tonic : 

Sulphate quinine, twenty-five grains ; citrate of iron (soluble), thirty- 
five grains. Make into twenty-four powders. Take a powder thre 
times a day, after each meal, in sweet wine. 

LEUCORRHCEA — WHITES -FLOUR ALBUS. 

The word leucorrhcea is derived from two Greek words, and means 
literally a " white discharge." It is also known as " flour albus," 
^'whites," and "female weakness," and consists of a "light colorless 
discharge from the genital organs, varying in hue from a whitish or color- 
less to a yellowish, light green, or to a slightly red or brownish ; varying 
in consistency from a thin, watery, to a thick, tenacious, ropy substance ; 
and in quantity from a slight increase in the healthy secretion to several 
ounces in the twenty-four hours." This discharge generally occurs 
between the ages of fifteen and forty-five, seldom during infancy or old 
age. When it occurs in young female children, it will not infrequently be 
produced by the presence of pinworms in the vagina, which make their 
way there from the rectum. There will be intense itching of the parts, 
and the worms can be removed with a small piece of cloth, after sepa- 
rating the lips.

This disease may be either acute or chronic. The acute form 
generally results from taking cold, and is simply a catarrhal inflammation 
of the mucous membrane lining the vagina. The chronic form is but a 
continuation of the acute, an 1 is generally caused by the acute stage 
having been neglected or improperly treated. Ulceration of the neck of 
the womb sometimes results. There are two forms of ;eucorrhcea : 
Vaginal leucorrhcca, when the discharge comes from the walls of the 
vagina ; and cervical leucorrhcca, when the discharge proceeds from the 
neck of the womb. 

Causes : Taking cold from sitting on the ground, or exposure of 
the neck and shoulders ; over sexual excitement, and sexual intercourse ; 
tight lacing ; piles, miscarriages, and abortions ; displacements of the 
womb ; purgatives, improper articles of diet ; warm injections, or injec- 
tions of any kind ; late hours, etc. It may also be hereditary. 

I'REATMENT. 

The treatment, to be successful, requires that the patient should first 
be placed in a favorable condition. Anything which tends to excite the 
disease must be avoided, as dissipations, late suppers, etc. The diet 
must be plain and nourishing without being stimulating, and be taken 
regularly. Exercise, short of fatigue, will be beneficial. The clothing 
should be warm and worn loosely, especially about the waist. Water is 
of great imixirtanc" in the treatment of this trouble. The sitting-bath 
may be used every iay, and injections of cold or tepid water should be 
used three or four tii. es a day, according to the severity of the discharge. 

An injection of v eak green tea will be found good in some mild 
cases, as also swee* cider or a weak solution of alum. 

One of the best tonics is the muriated tincture of iron, of which take 
twenty or twenty -five drops in half a tumbler of water three or four times 
a day. An excellent injection is made by taking three drams of tannic 
acid and an ounce of alum, dissolving in a quart of water, and inject one- 
third three times a day. The bowels should be kept open by Rochelle 
or Epsom salts, or seidlitz [)owder. When there is great debility of the 
organs, or when the disease has been brought on by exposure to cold, 
pregnancy, abortions, etc., the following will be found very successful : 

Tincture of aloes, two ounces ; muriated tincture of iron, four drams. 
Mix. Dose : Thirty-five drops in water three times a day. At the 
same time use the following injection : Sulphate of zinc (white vitriol), 
two drams ; sugar of lead, two drams. Mix in one quart of water, and 
use one-fourth for each injection.

Stomach and bowels, and will generally settle the stomach very soon in 
case of vomiting or nausea. It should always be kept in the house. 
Where it is needed for immediate use, it may be made in an hour or less 
by using alcohol instead of brandy and by boiling all in a stone jug, 
uncorked, by placing the jug in a vessel of boiling water, shaking or 
stirring frequently. 

PILE OINTMENT. 

Take say a teacupful of hog's lard, put in a flat or pewter dish, and 
take two bars of lead, flattened a little, and rub the lard with the flat ends 
and between them till it becomes black or of a dark lead color. Then burn 
equal parts of cavendish tobacco and old shoeleather in an iron vessel 
till charred. Powder these and mix into the lard till it becomes a thick 
ointment. Use once or twice a day as an ointment for the piles. An 
infallible cure. 

WARTS AND CORNS. 

The bark of the common willow burnt to ashes, mixed with strong 
vinegar and applied to the parts, will remove all warts, corns, and other 
excrescences. 

DEAFNESS. 

It is seldom that the power of hearing once entirely lost can ever be 
restored, and not always that even partial deafness can be cured, though 
it may often be relieved. Partial deafness is frequently owing to the 
accumulation and hardening in the ear of the ear wax, which may generally 
be remedied by dropping into the ear such articles as are calculated to 
soften, relax, and stimulate. For this purpose the following preparations 
are recommended as the best : ' 

Take sulphuric ether, one ounce, and add to it one dram pulverized 
corbonate of ammonia. Let it stand a few days to form a solution. If it 
does not all dissolve, pour off carefully the liquid from the dregs, and of 
this liquid drop into the ear once a day from three to six drops. The 
patient should lay his head upon the opposite side at the time, and 
remain in that position a few minutes to allow the liquid to penetrate. 
This preparation is highly recommended, and if persevered in will, it is 
said, overcome almost any partial deafness or greatly relieve it. 

ANOTHER. 

Take pure olive oil, say one ounce, and half an ounce each of the 
tincture of lobelia and tincture of cayenne. Mix ; and from a warm

teaspoon drop into the ear four to six drops of this twice a day, shaking 
the vial well always before using it. This is relaxing, softening, and 
stimulating, and in all ordinary cases will answer the purpose, Turkey 
oil (or grease) is said to be still better than olive oil and may be used 
instead of it in this preparation. The following remedy, long kept a 
seci-et, is said to be infallible where it is possible for anything to effect a 
cure : 

Take a common eel, remove the skin and intestines, and hang it up 
before the fire and let the oil drip into a pan or vessel. When done 
dripping, bottle the oil, and of this drop into the ear once a day or twice a 
day five or six drops from a warm teaspoon. I have heard remarkable 
accounts of the efficacy of this remedy, and doubt not but it is good. I 
believe it has never been published but once before. The secret was 
obtained with some difficulty from an old negro. 

INVERTED TOE-NAIL. 

This is a very troublesome and often painful affection. The edges 
or sides of the nail are disposed to turn down and grow into the flesh, 
giving rise to inflammation, ulceration, and often great pain and suffering. 
The best remedy I have ever known in this difficulty is to scrape with 
some sharp-pointed instrument, as the point of a penknife, a sort of 
groove or gutter in the center of the nail lengthways from the root 
to the end. It must be scraped down to near the quick, or as thin 
as it can be borne. This renders the nail " weak in the back," so that it 
will gradually and ultimately turn up at the sides until the edges come 
above and over the flesh. Continue this as fast as the nail grows out and 
grows thicker, and you will eventually succeed in getting the nail in its 
proper shape and position. It will be proper to poultice if there is much 
inflammation, and also apply healing salve. If ulceration, bathe the part 
also occasionally with tinctures aloes, myrrh, and opium, equal parts 
mixed. — Gunn's Domestic Physician.

CHAPTER Xr. 
THINGS FOR THE SICK ROOM. 

Many people are ignorant of what constitutes good, nourishing, 
refreshing food and drink for sick people. The following dishes are all 
palatable and nourishing, and are very refreshing to an invalid. Every 
one should Iiave these recipes for " Things for the sick room " :

Pearl barley, two ounces ; boiling water, two quarts. Boil to one 
quart, and strain. If desirable, a little lemon juice and sugar may be 
added. This may be taken freely in all inflammatory and eruptive dis- 
eases : measles, scarlet fever, small-pox, etc. 

RICE WATER. 

Rice, two ounces ; water, two quarts. Boil one hour and a half, and 
add sugar and nutmeg to suit the taste. When milk is added to this it 
makes a very excellent diet for ciiildren. Should the bowels be too loose, 
boil the milk before adding. 

SAQE TEA. 

Dried leaves of sage, half an ounce ; boiling water, one quart. Infuse 
for half an hour, and strain. May add sugar if desired. Balm, pepper- 
mint, spearmint, and other teas are made in the same way.

condition of the patient. 

GRAPES. 
In all cases of fever, very rijie graj^es of any kind are a beneficial 
article of diet, acting as both food and drink and possessing soothing and 
cooling qualities. They are also extremely grateful to every palate. 

TOAST. 

To make a most excellent toast for a reduced or convalescent patient, 
take bread twenty-four or thirty-six hours old, which has been made of a 
mixture of fine wheat flour and Indian meal and a pure yeast batter 
mixed with eggs. Toast it until of a delicate brown, and then (if the 
patient be not inclined to fever) immerse it in boiled milk and butter. If 
the patient be feverish, spread it lightly with cranberry jim or calves'-foot 
jelly. 

RICE. 

In all cases where a light and nice diet for patients who ha*'^ 
or are afflicted with diarrhoea or dysentery is required, rice, ays. 

cooked form, is most agreeable and advantageous. It may L iven w . 
benefit to dyspeptics, unless costiveness accompanies the dyspep.sia. Vo 
make rice pudding, take a teacupful of rice, and as much sugar, uvo

quarts of milk, and a teaspoonful of salt. Bake, with a moderate heat, 
for two hours. Rice flour made in a batter and baked upon a griddle 
makes a superb cake ; and rice-flour gruel, seasoned to the taste, is most 
excellent for the sick room. 

BREAD JBLLY. 

Boil a quart of water and let it cool. Take one-third of a common 
loaf of vheat bread, slice it, pare ofi" the crust, and toist it to a lighi 
brown. Put it in water in a covered vessel and boil gently till you 
find, on putting some in a spoon to cool, the liquid has become a jelly. 
Strain and cool. When used, warm a cujiful, sweeten with sugar, and 
add a little grated lemon peel. 

BICB QRUEL. 

Ground rice, one heaping tablespoonful ; water, one quart. Boil 
gently for twenty minutes, adding, a few minutes before it is done, one 
tablespoonful of ground cinnamon. Strain and sweeten. Wine may be 
added when the case demands it. 



WATER QRUEL. 

Oat or corn meal, two tablespoonfuls ; water, one quart. Boil for 
ten minutes and strain, adding salt and sugar if desired by the patient.

pudding of it, and improve the flavor agreeably to the desire of the patient 

or convalescent by adding raisins, sugar, prunes, lemon juice, wine, 

spices, etc. 

BEEF LIQUID. 

When the stomach is very weak, take fresh lean beef, cut it into 
strips and place the strips into a bottle with a little salt ; place in a kettle 



i6o 



THE ladies' book 



of boiling water and let it remain one hour ; pour off the liquid and add 
some water. Begin with a small quantity, and use in the same manner 
and under similar circumstances as beef tea. Tliis is even more nourish- 
ing than beef tea. 

BEEF TKA. 

Cut one pound of lean beef into shreds, and boil for twenty minutes 
in one quart of water, being particular to remove the scum as often as 
any rises. When it is cool, strain. This is very nourishing and pala- 
table, and is of great value in all cases of extreme debility where no 
inflammatory action exists, or after the inflammation is subdued. In very 
low cases a small teaspoonfiil may be administered every fifteen or 
twenty minutes, gradually increasing the amount given as the powers of 
life return. In cases of complete prostration, after the cessation of long 
exhausting fever it may be used as directed above, either alone or in 
conjunction with a little wine. 

PANADO. 

Put a little water on the fire, with a glass of wine, some sugar, and a 
little grated nutmeg ; boil all together a itw seconds, and add pounded 
cracker or crumbs of bread, and boil again for a few minutes. 



'' 



FRENCH MILK PORRIDGE. 

Stir some oatmeal and water together; let the mixture stand to clear, 
and pour off the water. Then put more water to the meal; stir it well, 
and let it stand till the next day. Strain through a fine sieve, and boil 
the water, adding milk while so doing. The proportion of water must be 
small. With toast this is admirable. 



COFFEE MILK. 

Put a dessertspoonful of ground coffee inco a pint of milk ; boil a 
quarter of an hour, with a shaving or two of isinglass; let it stand ten 
minutes, and theii pour off. 

RESTORATIVE JELLY. 

Take a leg of well-fed pork just as cut up, beat it and break the bone ; 
set it over a gentle fire, with thrs.^ gallons of water and simmer to one. 
Let half an ounce of mace and the same of nutmeg stew in it. Strain 
through a fine sieve. When cold, take off the fat. Give a coffee cup 
of this three times a day, adding salt to the taste. This is very valuable 
in all cases of debility where animal food is admissible.

DRINK IN DYSENTERY. 

Sheep's suet, two ounces ; milk, one pint ; starch, half an ounce. 
Boil gently for thirty minutes. Use as a common drink. This is excel- 
lent for sustaining the strength in bad cases of dysentery. 

CRUST COFFEE. 

Toast slowly a thick piece of bread cut from the outside of a loaf 
until it is well browned, but not blackened ; then turn upon it boiling 
water of a sufficient quantity, and keep it from half an hour to an hour 
before using. Be sure that the liquid is of a rich brown color before you 
use it. It is a most excellent drink in all cases of sickness. 

CRANBERRY WATER. 

Put a teaspoonful of cranberries into a cup of water and mash them. 
In the meantime boil two quarts of water with one large spoonful of corn 
or oat meal and a bit of lemon peel ; then add the cranbenies and as 
much fine sugar as will leave a smart flavor of the fruit ; also a wineglass- 
ful of sherry, Boil the whole gently for a quarter of an hour, then strain. 

WINE WHEY. 

Heat a pint of new milk until it boils, at whicli moment pour in as 
much good wine as will curdle and clarify it. Boil and set it aside until 
the curd subsides. Do not stir it, but pour the whey off carefully, and 
add two pints of boiling water with loaf sugar, 

ORANGE WHEY. 

Milk, one pint ; the juice of an orange with a portion of the peel. 
Boil the milk, then put the orange into it and let it stand till it coagulates. 
Strain. 

MUSTARD WHEY. 

Bruised mustard seed, two tablespoonfuls ; milk, one cpiart. Boil 
together for a few minutes until it coagulates, and strain to separate the 
curd. This is a very useful drink in dropsy. A teacupful may be taken 
at a dose, three times a day. 

CHICKEN BROTH. 

Take half a chicken, divested of all fat, and break the bones ; add to 
this hilf a gallon of water, and boil for half an hour. Season with sail. 



l62 



THE ladies' book 



VEGETABLE SOUP. 

Take one potato, one turnip and one onion, with a little celery or 
celery seed. Slice, and boil for an hour in one quart of water. Salt to 
the taste, and pour the whole upon a piece of dry toast. This forms a 
good substitute for animal food and may be used when the latter would 
be improper. 

CALVES'-FOOT JELLY. 

Boil two calf's feet in one gallon of water until reduced to one 
quart. Strain, and when cool skim carefully. Add the white of six or 
eight eggs, well beaten ; a pint of wine, half a pound of loaf sugar, and 
the juice of four lemons. Mix them well, boil for a few minutes, stirring 
constantly, and pass through a flannel strainer. In some cases the wine 
should be omitted. 

SLIPPERY ELM JELLY. 

Take of the flour of slippery elm, one or two tablespoonfuls ; cold 
water, one pint. Stir until a jelly is formed. Sveeten with loaf sugar or 
honey. This is excellent for all diseases of the throat, chest, and lungs ; 
coughs, colds, bronchitis, inflammation of the lungs, etc. It is very 
nutritious and soothing. 

NUTRITIVE FLUIDS, 

Following will be found directions for preparing three nutritious 
fluids, which are of great value in all diseases, either acute or chronic, 
that are attended or followed by prostration ; debility, whether general 
or of certain organs only; derangement of the digestive organs, weak 
stomach, indigestion, heartburn or sour stomach, constipated bowels, 
torpidity or want of activity of the liver, thin or poor blood. These 
fluids are highly nutritious, supplying to the blood, in such a form that 
they are most easily assimilated, the various elemea:s which are needed 
to enrich it and thus enable it to reproduce the various tissues of the 
body that have been wasted by disease. In cases where the stomach has 
become so weakened and sensitive that the lightest food nr drinks cannot 
be taken without causing much uneasiness and distress hese fluids are 
invaluable. They strengthen the stomach and neutralize all undue 
acidity, while at the same time they soothe the irritation by their bland 
and demulcent qualities. When carefully and properly prepared, accord- 
ing to the directions following, they very nearly resemble rich new milk 
in color and consistency, vhile their taste is remarkably i)leasant. Care

should be taken that all the ingredients are of the best quality. Soft 
water must be used in all cases. Fresh rain water is to be preferred, but 
spring water may be used if perfectly soft. Hard water will cause the 
fluids to be of a yellow color, and if the milk is old they are apt to 
separate : 

FLUID NO. I, 

Put a pint of new milk (the fresher the better) and two pints of soft 
water, in a vessel perfectly free from all greasy matter, over a slow fire. 
Rub two even teaspoonfuls of superfine wheat flour and two teaspoonfuls 
of carbonate of magnesia, together with a little milk, into a soft batter, 
free from lumps ; add this to the milk and water as soon as they begin to 
boil. Boil gently for five minutes — /lo ioiiger — stirring constantly. Pour 
into an earthen or glass dish to cool, adding at the same time two tea- 
spoonfuls of loaf sugar and one teaspoonful each of saleratus and table 
salt, rubbed fine. Stir until cold. The fluid must not be allowed to 
remain in a metallic vessel of any kind, and it must be kept in a cool 
place. 

FLUID NO. 2. 

Put one pint of fresh milk and two pints of soft water in a vessel 
over a slow fire. Rub together with a little fresh cream into a soft batter, 
free from lumps, one tablespoonful each of good sweet rye flour, ground 
rice, and pure starch ; which add to the milk and water as soon as they 
begin to boil. Boil for five minutes, stirring constantly. Remove from 
the fire and add three teaspoonfuls of loaf sugar and one teaspoonful 
each of saleratus and table salt. Observe the same precautions as in 
No. I. 

FLUID NO. 3. 

Put in a vessel, over a slow fire, one pint of fresh milk and two pints 
of soft water. When they begin to boil, add one tablespoonful of wheat 
flour, twotablespoonfuls of pure starch, and two teaspoonfuls of carbonate 
of magnesia, rubbed together with a little milk into a soft batter, free 
from lumps. Boil gently for five minutes, stirring constantly. Pour into 
an earthen vessel to coo!, and add one teaspoonful of the best gum 
arable dissolved in a little warm water, one teaspoonful each of saleratus 
and table salt, and one tablespoonful of pure strained honey. Stir until 
cold. The same precaution must be observed as in preparing No. i. 



i64 



THE LADIES BOOK 



DIRECTIONS. 

One half pint or less of these fluids may be taken at a dose, and at 
least three pints should be taken during the day and the amount 
gradually increased to two or three quarts. Commence with No. i and 
use two weeks, then use No. 2 for the same length of time, after which 
No. 3 is to be used for two weeks. Continue their use as long as 
necessary, taking each for two weeks before changing. In all the 
diseases mentioned above, the use of these fluids, in connection with 
proper remedies, will insure a speedy restoration to health. 

GUM ACACIA RESTORATIVE. 

Take two ounces of pure white gum arabic (procure the lump, the 
powdered is very apt to be adulterated), pulverize it well, and dissolve 
by the aid of a gentle heat in a gill of water, stirring constantly. When it 
is entirely dissolved, add three tablespoonfuls of pure strained honey. 
Let it remain over the fire until it becomes of the consistency of a jelly. 
The heat must be veiy gentle, it must not boil. If desirable, flavor with 
lemon or vanilla. This will be found a very pleasant article of diet for a 
weak stomach. When the articles used are pure it will be transparent 
and of a light golden color. This will be borne by the weakest stomach 
when everything else is rejected. It is highly nutritious. 

MALT INFUSION. 

Infuse one pint of ground malt for two hours in three pints of scald- 
ing water. The water should not be brought quite to the boiling point. 
Strain ; add sugar, if desired ; flavor with lemon juice. This is an 
excellent drink in inflammatory fevers, acute rheumatism, etc. 

PEAS. 

Take young and fresh shelled green peas, wash them clean, put them 
into fresh water, just enough to cover them, and boil them till they take 
up nearly all the water. This dish, if prepared according to directions, 
and eaten warm, will not harm any invalid, not even one suffering from 
diarrhoea. 

MILK. 

In some cases where a milk diet is advisable, owing to the peculiar 
condition of the I'alient's stomach it will cause distress. This is 
frequently the case where there is undue acidity. In such cases, let it be

prepared in the following ma ner and it will be found to set well : Take 
a teacupful of fresh milk, heat nearly to boiling ; dissolve in it a tea- 
spoonful of loaf sugar; pour into a large sized tumbler, and add sufficient 
plain soda water to fill it. Prepared in the above directed manner it will 
be free from all unpleasant effects. 

SOUPS FOR THE CONVALESCENT. 

To extract the strength from meat, long and slow boiling is neces- 
sary ; but care must be taken that the pot is never off the boil. All soups 
should be made the day before they are used, and they should then be 
strained into earthen pans. When soup has jellied in the pan, it should 
not be removed into another. When in danger of not keeping, it should 
be boiled up. 

EGGS. 

In cases of extreme debility, eggs are most excellent. They should 
never be boiled hard. The best way to prepare them is to beat them 
well with milk and sugar. When it will be appropriate to the case, add 
some fine pale sherry wine. 

MILK FOR INFANTS. 

Fresh cow's milk, one part ; water, two parts ; sweeten with a very 
little loaf sugar. When children are raised by hand it is always necessary 
to dilute the milk. As the child advances in age the proportion of water 
stated above may be gradually lessened. 

WATER GRUEL. 

Corn or oat meal, two tablespoonfuls ; water, one quart. Boil ten 
or fifteen minutes, and strain. Add salt and sugar to suit the taste of the 
patient. This should be used freely during and after the operation of 
cathartic medicines.

THINGS CURIOUS AND USEFUL. 

TO GET CLEAR OP MOSQUITOES. 

Take of gum camphor a piece about one-third the size of an egg 
and evaporate it over a lamp or candle, taking care that it does not 
ignite. The smoke will soon fill the room and expel the mosquitoes. 

HOW TO GET RID OF BEDBUGS. 

Bedbugs cannot stand hot alum water ; indeed, alum seems to be 
death to them in any form. Take two pounds of alum, reduce it to a 
powder — the finer the better — and dissolve it in about four quarts of 
boiling water. Keep the water hot till the alum is all dissolved ; then 
apply it hot to every joint, crevice and place about the bedstead, floor, 
skirting or washboard around the room, and every place where the bugs 
are likely to congregate, by means of a brush. A common syringe is an 
excellent thing to use in applying it to the bedstead. Apply the water 
as hoi as you can. Apply it freely, and you will hardly be troubled any 
more that season with bugs. Whitewash the ceiling with plenty of 
dissolved alum in the wash, and there will be an end to their dropping 
down from thence on to your bed. 

TO OBTAIN FRESH-BLOWN FLOWERS IN WINTER. 

Choose some of the most perfect buds of the flowers you would 
preserve, such as are latest in blowing and ready to open. Cut them off 
with a pair off iicissors, leaving to each, if possible, a piece of stem about 
three inches long. Cover the end of the stem immediately with sealing 
wax, and when the buds are a little shrunk and wrinkled wrap up each 
of them separately in a piece of paper perfectly clean and dry and lock 
them up in a dry box or drawer, and they will keep without corrupting. 

In winter or at any time when you would have the flowers blow, take 
the buds at night and cut off the end of the stem sealed with wax and 
put the buds in water wherein a little nitre or salt has been diffused, and 
the next day you will have the pleasure of seeing the buds opening and 
expanding themselves and the flowers display their most lively colors 
and breathe their agreeable odors.

TO INCRBASB THE LAYING OF BOaS IN HENS. 

Pulverized Cayenne pepper, half an ounce, to be given to one dozen 
liens, mixed with their food every second day. 

THE NEW AND BEAUTIFUL ART OP TRANSFERBINQ 
ON TO GLASS. 

Colored or plain engravings, photographs, lithographs, water colors, 
oil colors, crayons, steel plates, newspaper cuts, mezzotints, pencil, writ- 
ing, show cards, labels, or, in fact, anything. 

DIRECTIONS. 

Take glass that is perfectly clear (window glass will answer), clean 
it thoroughly ; then varnish it, taking care to have it perfectly smooth ; 
place it where it will be perfectly free from dust ; let it stand over night, 
then take your engraving, lay it in clear water until it is wet through (say 
ten or fifteen minutes), then lay it upon a newspaper, that the moisture 
may dry from the surface and still keep the other side damp. Imme- 
diately varnish your glass the second time, then place your engraving 
upon it, pressing it down firmly, so as to exclude every particle of air ; 
next, rub the paper from the back until it is of uniform thickness, so thin 
that you can see through it, then varnish it the third time and let it dry. 

These transferred pictures make lovely ornaments for table, racket, 
mantel, etc. 

MATERIALS FOR MAKING THE VARNISH. 

Take two ounces balsam of fir to one ounce spirits of turpentine. 
Apply with a camel's-hair brush. 

TO PREVENT HORSES BEING TEASED BY FLIES. 

Boil three handfuls of walnut leaves in three quarts of water ; sponge 
the horse (before going out of the stable) between and upon the ears, 
neck, and flank. 



TO PREVENT PLIES LIGHTING ON WINDOWS, PICTURES, 

MIRRORS, ETC. 

No fly will light on a window or other article which has been washed 
in water in which garlic has been boiled.

TO MAKE LEATHER WEAR FOREVBH. 

Let it receive as much neat's-foot oil as it will take. If regularly- 
repeated every three months, leather so treated seems to be impervious to 
outward action and will last for years. 

TO RENDER PAPER FIREPROOF. 

Whether the paper be plain, written, printed, or even marbled, stained, 
or painted for paper hangings, dip it in a strong solution of alum water 
and thoroughly dry it. In this state it will be fireproof. 

TO PREPARE WATERPROOF BOOTS. 

Take three ounces of spermaceti and melt it in an earthen pot over 
a slow fire ; add thereto six drams of India rubber cut into slices, and 
after it dissolves add of tallow, eight ounces ; amber varnish, four ounces. 
Mix it, and it will be ready for use immediately. 

TO CURE DRUNKENNESS. 

Keep the patient for one week freely dosed with figwort. This is a 
sure cure. 

TO CURE LAZINESS. 

Give the patient an occasional dose of ferri. The sulphate of ferri 
is the best. It acts on the liver and vital organs, and is a sure cure for 
laziness. 

TO EXTRACT THE ESSENTIAL OIL FROM ANY FLOWER. 

Take any flower you like, which stratify with common salt in a clean 
glazed pot; when filled to the top, cover it well and carry it to the cellar ; 
forty days afterwards put a crape over a pan and empty the whole to 
strain the essence from the flowers by pressure. Bottle this essence, and 
expose it for four or five weeks in the sun and dew of the evening to 
purify. One single drop of this essence is enough to scent a whole quart 
of water. 

TO TAKE LEAF PHOTOGRAPHS. 

A very pretty amusement, especially for those who have just com- 
pleted the study of botany, is the taking of leaf photographs. One very 
simple process is this : At any druggist's get an ounce of bichromate of 
potassium. Put this into a pint bottle of water. When the solution 
becomes saturated — that is, the water has dissolved as much as it will —

pour off some of the clear liquid into a shallow dish ; on this lloiit a piece 
of ordinary writing paper till it is thoroughly moistened, and let it dry in 
the dark. It should be of a bright yellow color. On this put the leaf, 
under it a piece of black soft cloth and several sheets of newspajjer. Put 
these between two pieces of glass (all the pieces should be of the same 
size) and with spring clothespins fasten them together. Expose to a 
bright sun, placing the leaf so that the rays will fall upon it as nearly 
perpendicular as possible. In a few moments it will begin to turn brown; 
but it requires from half an liour to several hours to jiroduce a perfect 
print. \Vhen it has become dark enough, take it from the frame and 
put it into clear water, which must be changed every few minutes until 
the yellow part becomes white. Sometimes the veinings will be quite 
distinct. By following these directions it is scarcely possible to fail, and 
a little practice will make perfect. 



TO MAKE LAMP WI0K8 INDESTRUCTIBLE. 

Steep common wicks in a concentrated aqueous solution of tungstate 
of soda, and then dry thoroughly in an oven. 

TO MAKE DIFFERENT KINDS OF PERFUMES.

CHAPTER XIII. 



HOME DECORATION. 



The chief features to be observed in house furnishing are color, form, 
and proportion. All stiffness of design in furniture should be avoided. 
Do not attempt to match articles, but rather carry out the same idea as 
to color and form in the whole. It is not en rtgie to have decorations 
in sets or pairs ; the arrangements should all be done with odd pieces. 
Every room in the house should be arranged for occupancy, having 
nothing too good for use, and the judicious housewife will follow a 
medium course and adopt no extreme of fashion. 

The style and arrangement of the furniture should correspond with the 
size of the room, with a due regard to the place a piece of furniture or 
ornament will occupy. The order of arrangement in furnishing is subject 
to individual taste, but the following suggestions may not be inappro- 
priate : — 

In decorating a dining-room, deep, rich tones should be used ; a 
drawingroom or parlor should hn,ve bright, checrlul shades ; in a library 
use deep, rich colors, which give a sense of worth ; a sleeping-room 
should have light, pleasing tints, which give a feeling of repose. 



THE HALL. 

The hall being the index to the whole house, due care should there- 
fore be given to its furnishing. Light colors and gilding should be 
avoided. The wall and ceiling decorations now mostly used are in dark, 
rich colors, shaded in maroons or deep reds. Plain tinted walls and 
ceilings in fresco or wainscot are also frequently used. The latest shades 
of wall paper come in wood colors, dark olive-greens, stone color, and 
grays, in tile, arabesque and landscape designs, and with these are used 
a corresponding dado and frieze. 

A tile or inlaid floor is the most appropriate, but if circumstances do 
not admit of one of these, a floor stained a deep wood-brown, base board 
and moldings to correspond, may be substituted, when India mattings 
and rugs may be used. 



172 



THR ladies' book 



The colors now in vogue for hall carpets are crimson or Pompeiian 
reds, with small figures of nioss-grcen or peacock-blue. The prevailing 
shades of the walls and (loot should be incorporated in the stair carpet. 

If the hall is narrow, none but the most essential pieces of furniture 
should be used ; but if wide enough, there may be a lounge placed 
against one of the walls, an old fashioned clock of the cuckoo style set in 
a quiet corner, two high-backed chairs ujiholstered in leather, a table, an 
umbrella-stnnd placed near the door, a jardiniere filled with troi)ical 
plants set near the foot of the stairway, and a hall mirror with a deer's 
head and antlers placed above it and a wooden or marble slab under- 
neath. The slab should be covered with a Roman scarf, allowing a fall 
of twelve inches at each end. The hatrack must also find a place. 
Family portraits or a few well-selected pictures are appropriate for these 
walls. 

If the door-lights are not stamed glass, lace shades in designs of 
birds, cupids, and garlands of flowers are used ; also, etchings in various 
colors and designs are worked on different fabrics. Crimson silk shades 
lined with black netting are very desirable, as the light penetrating 
through them fills the hall with a rich, subdued glow. 



THE PARLOR. 

The furnishing of the parlor should be subject to its architectural 
finish. The first things to be considered are the walls and floor. The 
former may be decorated in fresco or papered, according to individual 
taste and means. The prettiest styles of parlor paper are light tints of 
gray, olive, pearl, and lavender grounds, and in small scroll patterns, 
panels, birds, and vines, finished in heavy gold traceries, with dado and 
frieze to correspond. 

The styles of carpet mostly used are Brussels, Wilton, tapestry, and 
Axniinster. A tapestry carpet in light canary ground, with clusters of 
lotus, or begonia leaves, makes a charming background to almost all the 
colors generally used in upholstery. 

In selecting the furniture, the first thought should be given to its 
true worth. Chairs and couches should be chosen for comfort rather 
than for style. They should be of solid make, easy, graceful, and of 
good, serviceable colors and materials. The most serviceable woods to 
select in frames are ebony, oak, walnut, cherry, and mahogany. These 
frames are finished in different styles — plain, carved, inlaid, and gilt — and

are upholstered in all shades of satin, plush, rep, silk, and damask. 
'I'hese come at prices within the means of a slender purse. That slip|)ery 
abomination in the shape of haircloth furniture should be avoided. The 
latest design in parlor furniuire is in the Turkish style, the upholstery 
being made to cover the frame. Rich Oriental colors in woolen and 
silk brocades are mostly used, and tlie trimmings are cord and tassels or 
heavy fringe. 

Formerly tiie parlor appointments were all in sets or i)airs. but this 
fashion is no longer observed, as tlie most tastefully arranged parlor has 
now no two pieces of furniture alike ; but two easy-chairs placed oppo- 
site each other are never out of place. Here may stand an embroidered 
ottoman, there a quaint little chair, a divan can take some central posi- 
tion ; a collage piano, covered with some embroidered drapery, may 
stand at one end of the room, while an ebony or mahogany cabinet, with 
its panel mirrors and quaint brasses, may be placed at the other end, its 
racks and shelves affording an elegant display for pretty pieces of bric-a- 
brac. 

Marble-topped center-tables are no longer in use. Tables in inlaid 
woods, or hand-painted, are used for placing books or albums on. A 
small, airy-looking table, elaborately mounted in gilt, may stand near a 
window or wall. The mantel mirror, with its beveled edges and small 
racks arranged on each side, looks very effective when decorated with 
pretty oddities — ferns, grasses, and pieces of old china. A jardiniere 
filled with living jilants and placed near a bay window makes an elegant 
ornament. Care should be taken in arranging that the room be not over- 
crowded. There should be a few good i)ictures or j)ainted plaques 
mounted in i)lush hung on the walls ; a ])ortrait may be placed on a 
common easel and drained with a scarf in old gold or peacock-blue, and 
tiny lambrequins, painted or embroidered, may hang beneath a bracket 
supporting a bust or flower-vase. 

An embroidered scarf with fringed ends may be placed on the back 
of a chair or sofa in place of the old lace tidy. A sack made of small 
pieces of bright-colored plush or silk in crazy work may be flung across 
the table, the ends drooping very low. The mantelpiece may be covered 
with a corresponding sash, over which place a small clock as centerpiece 
and arrange ornaments on each side — statuettes, bannerets, flower- 
holders, small Japanese fans, pieces of odd china, painted candles in 
small scenes, may all find a place on the mantel.

Window curtains of heavy fabric, hung from brass or plush mounted 
poles, may be gracefully draped to the sides, "'hile the inner lace ones 
should be hung straight and be fastened in the center with some orna- 
ment or bow of ribbon corresponding in shade to the general tone of 
the room. The straight shades next to the glass may correspnnd in tone 
to the outside walls or window-facings ; but this is a mere matter of 
taste. White or light-tinted shades, finished in etching or narrow lace, 
are always in vogue. 

The dado shades are the latest innovation in window decoration. 
Thei;e come in all colors, from the lightest to the daikest shades, with 
dado in tile, arabesque and fresco patterns, finished in lace, fringe, and 
brasses. 

Portieres (curtain doors) have superseded folding doors. These 
should be in shades to contrast with die general blending of the colors in 
the room. The fabrics mostly used are India goods, but they may be of 
any material, from expensive tapestries, satins, and plushes, to ten-cent 
factory cottons. The curtains, if made from striped tapestry and 
Turcoman, will give the finishing artistic touches to almost any room, but 
the last softening polish comes only from the genial presei.oC of trailing 
and climbing vines. 

THE SITTING-ROOM. 

The sitting or everyday room should be the brightest and most 
attractive room in the house. Its beauty of decoration should not be so 
much in the richness and variety of material as in its comfort, simplicity, 
ana the harmony of its tints — the main features being the fitness of each 
article to the needs of the room. In these days of so many advantages 
much can be done in adornment by simple means. 

The wal' papeis taostly used come in grounds of cream, amber, rose, 
pale olive, fawn, ceil blue and light gray, with designs and traceries of 
contrasting hues. 

The carpet, it 'U tapestry, looks more effective if in grounds of pale 
canary or light gray, with designs in bright-colored woodland flowers and 
borders to match. The nev/ ingrain carpets, with their pretty designs 
and bright colors, are very fashionable for rooms that are much used. 

\ 'hatt/er may be the prevailing tint ot the carpet, the window 
curtains should follow it up ui lighter tones or contrast with it. The 
curtains may correspond with the coverings of the chairs, sofa, mantel

and table draperies in color and fabric. If the furniture is of wicker, 
bamboo or rattan, the curtains should be of Japanese or any kind of 
Oriental goods. Curtains of muslin (either white or tinted), gay-colored 
chintzes, lace or dotted Swiss muslin, looped back with bright-toned 
ribbons, lool: very pretty and are appropriate for the sitting-room at 
almost any season. That clumsy structure called the cornice, for putting 
up curtains on, has hn.ppily given place to the more light and graceful 
curtain pole. 

One large table, covered with a pretty embroidered cloth, should be 
placed in some central location for a catch-all. A low divan, with a pair 
Oi' scjuare, soft pillows, may stand in some quiet nook ; a rocker, hand- 
somely upholstered, with a pretty tidy pinned to its back ; a large, soft 
easy-chair ; a small sewing-chair placed near a table ; and a bamboo 
chair, trimmed with ribbons, will be tastefully arranged in the room. 
Window stands and gypsy tables may be draped with some rich fabric, 
the surrounding valance being caught up in small festoons and fastened 
with bows or tassels, finished around the edge of the table with cord or 
quilted ribbon. 

If the furniture is old or in sets it can be covered with different- 
patterns in cretonne or chintz, which not only protects the furniture but 
breaks u]) the monotony and lends a pleasing variety to the room. A 
Turkish chair is a grand accessory to the family room. This may be 
made by buying the frame and having it upholstered in white cotton 
cloth and covering it with a rich shade of cretonne, finishing it with cord 
and fringe. 

A foot-rest frame can be made in the same way and covered with a 
piece of homemade embroidery, finishing it off with a cord or narrow 
gimp around the edge. Homemade easels, screens, and pedestals may 
be made out of black walnut, and when stained and draped look 
exceedingly pretty. An old second-hand cabinet may be bought at a 
trifle, and when po r led up may be set in a corner on which to display 
some pieces of bric-a-brac. 

If the house has no library, the sitting-room is just the place for the 
bookcase. 

With house plants in the windows, a room of this character, with 
floods of sur.siiine, makes a most attractive and comfortable living-room.

THE LIBRARY. 

The walls of the library should be hung with rich, dark colors, the 
latest style in wall paper being a black ground with old gold and olive- 
green designs. 

The carpet comes in Pompeiian red, with moss-green and peacock- 
blue patterns. Statuary and the best pictures should find a place in the 
library. The library table should be massive and the top laid with 
crimson baize. There should be a few high-backed chairs, upholstered 
in leather, a reading-chair, soft rugs, foot-rests, a mantel mirror, a few 
mantel ornaments, and the piece de resistance — the bookcase. In large 
libraries the bookcases are built in the wall. It is quite in vogue to 
hang curtains on rods in front of bookcases instead of doors, but we 
think the old style is the best, inasmuch as the books may be seen and 
the glass doors exclude the dust. 

Heavy curtains of raw silk, Turcoman, and canton flannel, with a full 
valance at the top, are used for the window drapery.

CHAMBERS. 

The walls of bedrooms should be decorated in light tints and 
shadings, with a narrow rail and deep frieze. Most housekeepers prefer 
rugs and oiled floors to carpets, but this is a matter of individual taste. 
Rugs are as fashionable as they are wholesome ani tidy. These floor- 
coverings should be darker than the furniture, yet blending in shade. If 
carpets are chosen they should be the lightest shades and in bright 
field-flower jjatterns. Avoid anything dark and somber for the sleeping- 
room. Pink and ceil blue combined are very pretty, scarlet and gray, 
deep red and very light blue. Dark blue with sprays of lily of the valley 
running through it is exceedingly ))retty for bedrooms. Dark furniture 
will harmonize with all these colors, but the lighter shades are preferable. 
Cretonnes in pale tints and chintzes in harmonizing colors are used for 
light woods. Square pillows of cretonne on a bamboo or wicker lounge 
are very pretty. Canton matting is often used, either plain or in colored 
])aiterns. 

Formerly the bed-coverings were spotlessly white, but the profluent 
tide of color has included these also. The coverings now in vogue are : 
Nottingham lace, darned net, applique, antique lace, and Swiss muslin. 
These are used over silk and silesia for backgrounds, and are exceedingly 
l)retty, with pillow shams to match. Cretonnes, chintzes, dimities, and 
silk in crazy work and South Kensington patterns are also used.

Cheese cloth, bunting, Swiss muslin, cretonne, and Swiss curtains 
are used for window drapery. These may be trimmed witli the same 
fabric or antique lace. They are hung on poles above the windows and 
draped back witii ribbons. 

The appointments of a bedroom are a low couch, a large rocker, a 
small sewing-chair, a workbasket, footstools, a toilet table prettily 
draped with muslin, or a dressing-case, brackets for vases, flowerpots, a 
few pictures, small table, hanging shelves for books, etc., and the bed. 

The washstand should have a full set of toilet mats, or a large towel 
with a colored border may be laid on it ; also, a splasher placed on the 
wall at the back of the stand is very essential. A screen is a very desir- 
able part of the bedroom appointments. A rug should be placed in front 
of the bed and dressing-case. 



THE DINING-ROOM. 

The dining-room should be furnished with a view to convenience, 
richness, and comfort. Choose deep, rich grounds for the walls — bronze- 
maroon, black, PomiJeiian red, and deep olive — and the designs and 
traceries in old gold, olive or moss green, with dado and frieze to 
correspond. Or, the walls may be wainscoted with oak, walnut, maple, 
etc. Some are finished in plain panels, with different kinds of wood ; 
others, again, are elaborately carved, with fruit, flowers, and emblems of 
the chase. 

The floor is the next point for consideration. It may be of tile or 
laid in alternate strips of different colored woods, with a border of 
parquetry. Rugs or carpets may be used on these floors or dispensed 
with, according to taste. If a carpet'is used, the dark, rich shades found 
in the Persian and Turkish designs should be chosen. 

The window drapery siiould be those deep, rich colors that hold 
their otvn despite time and use — the pomegranates, rich crimsons, 
dark blues, dull Ponipeiian reds, and soft olives. These curtains may be 
hung on poles, and should fall in heavy folds to the floor, then looped 
bacrv "ith a wide embroidered dado. 

Screens of stained glass are now used in the windows. They are 
both useful and ornamental, for they exclude the strong rays of the sun, 
and the light filtering through them beautifies the room with its many 
mellow hues.

Dark wood should be used for the furniture. The chairs should be 
chosen in square, solid styles, and upholstered in embossed or plain 
leather, with an abundance of brass or silver headed nails which are used 
for upholstering leather and add much to the substantial appearance of 
the articles. 

The dining-table should be low, square or bevel cornered, heavily 
carved, and when not in use should be covered with a cloth correspond- 
ing in shade to the window drapery. 

A buffet may stand in one corner for the display of ceramics or 
vlecorated china. The sideboard should be of high, massive style, with 
shelves and racks for glassware and pieces of china. 

A few pictures — two or three fruit pieces and one or two plaques 
of still life — are appropriate. 

A case of stuffed birds, a few large pots of tropical plants, and a 
fernery are in keeping with the dining-room appointments. A three-leaf 
folding Japanese screen should not be forgotten ] also, a lamp shade of 
antique lace, lined with crimson silk, is very desirable. 

THE KITCHEN. 

It is a remark too )ften made that this or that " is good enough for 
a servant." If all knew that unpleasant surroundings made unpleasant 
servants and ill-prepared meals, we think more pains would be taken to 
have pleasant and comfortable kitchens. There should be a pleasant 
window or two through which fresh air and floods of sunlight may come, 
a few plants on the window sill, a small stand for a workbasket, an easy- 
chair that the servant may " drop into " when an opportunity offers, the 
walls painted or calcimined with some cheerful tint, and a general air of 
comfort pervading the whole kitchen. — T/ie Popular Art Instructor.

CHAPTER XIV. 
FLORAL. 

HOW TO CARE FOR HOUSE PLANTS. 

Plants that require a higli or low temperature or a very moist 
atmosphere and plants that bloom only in summer are undesirable. 
Procure fresh sandy loam, with an equal mixture of well-rotted turf, leaf 
mold, and cow-yard manure, with a small quantity of soot. In repotting 
plants use one size larger than they were grown in. Hard burned or 
glazed pots prevent the circulation of air. Secure drainage by broken 
crockery and pebbles laid in the bottom of the pot. An abundance of 
light is important, and when this cannot be given it is useless to attempt 
the culture of flowering plants. If possible they should have the morning 
sun, as one hour of sunshine then is worth two in the afternoon. Fresh 
air is alsf' essential, but cold, chilling drafts should be avoided. 
Water from one to three times a week with soft, lukewarm water, 
draining off all not absorbed by the earth. 

DO NOT PERMIT 

water to stand in the saucers, as the only plant thriving under such 
treatment is the calla lily ; and even for these it is not necessary, unless 
while blooming. Dust is a great obsiacle to the growth of plants. A 
good showering will generally remove it, but all the smooth-faced plants 
(such as camellias, ivies, etc.) should be carefully sponged so as to keep 
the foliage clean and healthy. 

PLANTS SUCCEED BEST 

in an even temperature, ranging from sixty to seventy degrees during the 
day and from ten to twelve degrees lower at night. If troubled with 
insects, put them under a box or barrel and smoke from thirty to sixty 
minutes with tobacco leaves. • 



FOR THE RED SPIDER 

the best remedy is to lay the plants on the side and sprinkle well or 
shower. Repeat if necessary. If manures are used, give in a liquid 
form.

Some of the plants most suitable for parlor culture are: Pelar- 
goniums, geraniums, fuchsias, palms, begonias, monthly roses, camellias, 
azaleas, oranges, lemons, Chinese and English primroses, abulilons, 
narcissus, heliotrope, petunias, and the gorgeous flowering plant, 
Poinsett ia pukhcrrivia. Camellias and azaleas require a cooler tempera- 
ture than most plants, and the Poinsettia a higher temperature. Do not 
sprinkle the foliage of the camellia while the flower buds are swelling or 
it will cause them to droop, nor sprinkle them in the sunshine. They 
should have a temperature of about forty degrees and more shade. By 
following these rules, healthy flowering plants will be the result. 

A good way 

TO START SLIPS 

is to partly break off" the slip (but do not entirely sever it from the parent 
stock), leaving it hanging for ten or twelve days ; then remove and plant 
in a box of half sand and half leaf mold and it will be well rooted in a 
week. Do not water too freely or the slip will rot. 

If house plants are watered once a week with water in which is mixed 
a few drops of ammonia they will thrive much better. Sometimes small 
white worms are found in the earth — lime water will kill them. Slir up 
the soil before pouring it on, to expose as many as possible. For 
running vines, burn beef bones and mix with the earth. 

TO KEEP PLANTS WITHOUT A FIRE AT NIQHT. 

Have made, of wood or zinc, a tray about four inches deep with a 
handle on either end, water-tight. Paint it outside and in, put in each 
corner a post as h'gh as the tallest of your plants, and it is ready for use. 
Arrange your flowerpots in it and fill between them with sawdust. This 
absorbs the moisture falling from the plants when you water them and 
retains the warmth acquired during the day, keeping the temperature of 
the roots even. When you retire at night spread over the posts a blanket 
or shawl, and there is no danger of freezing. 

SURE SHOT FOR ROSE-SLUGS. 

Make a tea of tobacco stems and a soapsuds of whale oil or carbolic 
soap ; mix and apply to the bush with a sprinkler, turning the bush so as 
to wet the under as well as the upper part of the leaves. Apply, before 
the sun is up, three or four times.

TO PRBPARB AUrUMN LEAVES AND PERNS. 

Immediately after gathering take a moderately warm i on, smear it 
well with white wax, rub over each surface of the leaf once, applying 
more wax for each leaf. This process causes leaves to roll about as 
when hanging on the trees. If pressed more they become bt'ttle and 
remain perfectly flat. Maple and oak are among the most desifaL'c, and 
may be gathered any time after the severe frosts ; but the sumac and ivy 
must be secured as soon after the first slight frost as they become 
tinted or the leaflets will fall from the stem. Ferns may be selected any 
time during the season. A large book must be used in gathering them, 
as they will be spoiled for pressing if carried in the hand. A weight 
should be placed on them until they are perfectly dry ; then, excepting 
the most delicate ones, it will be well to press them like the leaves, as 
they are liable to curl when placed in a warm atmosphere. These will 
form beautiful combinations with the sumac and ivy. 

TO PREPARE SKE;LBT0N LEAVES. 

When properly prepared, skeleton leaves form a companion to the 
scrapbook or collection of pressed ferns, fronds, etc. This is a tedious 
operation and requires skill n-id great patience to obtain satisfactory 
results. Some leaves are easier to dissect and make better specimens 
than others, and, as a rule, a hard, thin leaf should be chosen ; that is, 
when a special variety is not required. 

Among those which are skeletonized most successfully are the 
English ivy, box elder, willow, grape, pear, rose, etc. They should be 
gathered during the month of June, or as soon as the leaf is fully 
developed. The leaves should be immersed in a vessel of rain water and 
allowed to remain till decomposed. When this takes place, press the 
leaf between pieces of soft flannel, and the film will adhere to the flannel, 
leaving a perfect network. Dry off gradually and clean the specimen 
with a soft hair pencil. Place between folds of soft blotting paper, and 
when perfectly dry place in your collection. 

TO BLEACH THE LEAVES, 

dissolve one half pound of chloride of lime in three pints of rain water, 
strain, and use one part of the solution to one of water. For ferns, use 
the solution full strength. When perfectly white remove to clear water, 
let stand for several hours, changing water two or three times, float out 
on paper, and press between blotting paper in books,

HANOINO BASKETS. 

A correspondent of the Gardener's Monthly tells of a new style of 
banging barket made of round maple sticks about one inch in 
diameter, eight inches in length at the bottom, increasing to fourteen at 
the top. In constructing, begin at the bottom and build up, log cabin 
fashion ; chink the openings with green moss and line the whole basket 
with the same. These are easily kept moist, and the plants droop and 
twine over them very gracefully. i\ good way to keep the earth moist 
in a hanging basket without the trouble of taking it down is to fill a 
bottle with water and put in two pieces of yarn, leaving one end outside. 
Suspend the bottle just above the basket and allow the water to drip. 
This will keep the earth moist enough for winter and save a great deal of 
time and labor. Plant morning gloiy seeds in hanging baskets in winter ; 
they grow rapidly and are very pretty. — Buckeye.

CHAPTER XV. 



THE LAUNDRY. 



TELLING OF A GREAT MANY USEFUL .\ND LABOR-SAVING PRACTICES FOR 

THE LAl'NDRY. 

TO MAKE WASHING FLUID. 

Bring to a boil one pound of sal soda, half a pound of unslaked 
lime, a small lump of borax, and five quarts of water. Let cool, pour otf^ 
and bottle. Use one teacupful to a boiler of clothes. This is superior. 

GALL SOAP. 

For washing woolens, silks, or fine prints liable to fade. One pint 
beefs gall, two pounds common bar soap cut fine, one quart boiling soft 
water ; boil slowly, stirring occasionally until well mixed. Pour into a 
flat vessel, and when cold cut into pieces to dry. 

TO TAKE OUT SCORCH. 

If a shirt bosom or any other article has been scorched in ironing, 
lay it where bright sunshine will fall directly on it. It will entirely 
remove it. 

BLUING. 

Take one ounce of Prussian blue, one-half ounce )f oxalic acid ; 
dissolve in one quart of perfectly soft rain water. Insert a quill through 
the cork of the bluing bottle to prevent waste or putting too much in 
clothes and you will be pleased with the result. One or two tablespoons 
of it is sufficient for a tub of water, according to the size of the tub. 
Chinese blue is the best and costs twelve and a half cents an ounce, and 
the acid will cost three cents. 

COFFEE STARCH. 

Make a paste of two tablespoons best starch and cold water ; when 
smooth stir in a pint of perfectly clear coffee, boiling hot ; boil five or ten 
minutes. Stir with a spermaceti or wax candle. Strain and use for all 
dark calicoes, percales, and muslins. 



i84 



THK LADIRS' BOOK 



FLOUR STARCH. 

Have a clean pan or kettle on stove with one quart boiling water, 
into which stir three heaping tablespoons flour, previously mixed smooth 
in a little cold water ; stir steadily until it boils and thereafter enough to 
keep from burning. Boil about five minutes, and strain, while hot, 
through a crash towel. The above quantity is enough for one dress, and 
will make it nice and stiff. 

TO MAKE FINE STARCH. 

Wet the starch smooth in a little cold water in a largo tin pan, pour 
on a quart of boiling water to two or three lables])oons of slarch, stirring 
rapidly all the whik- ; place on stove, stir until it boils and then occa- 
sionally. Boil from five to fifteen minutes, or intii the starch is perfectly 
clear. Some add a little salt or butter or pure lard or stir with a sperm 
candle ; others add a teaspoon of kerosene to one quart of starch. This 
prevents the stickiness sometimes so annoying in ironing. 

Cold starch is made from starch dissolved in cold water, being 
careful not to have it too thick. Since it rots the clothes, it is not 
advisable to use it. 

ENAMEL FOR SHIRT BOSOMS. 

Melt together, with a gentle heat, one ounce white wax and two 
ounces spermaceti. Prepare in the usual way a sufficient quantity of 
starch for a dozen shirt bosoms, put into it a piece of this enamel the size 
©fa hazelnut. This will give your clothes a beautiful polish. 

TO CLEAN ARTICLES MADE OF WHITE ZEPHYR. 

Rub in flour or magnesia, changing often. Shake off and hang in 
the open air a short time. 

HOW TO CLEAN VELVET. 

Invert a hot flatiron, ])lace over it a single thickness of wet cotton 
cloth, lay on this the velvet (wrong side next the wet cloth), rub gently 
with a dry cloth until the pile is well raised, take off the iron, lay on a 
table, and brush it with a soft brush or cloth. 

TO CLEAN RIBBONS. 

Dissolve white soap in boiling water ; when cool enough to bear the 
hand, pass the ribbons through it, rubbing gently, so as not to injure the

texture ; rinse through lukewarm water and pin on a board to dry. If 
the colors are brij^ht yellow, maroon, crimson or scarlet, add a few drops 
of oil of vitriol to the rinse water ; if the color is bright scarlet, add to the 
rinse water a few drops of muriate of tin. 

TO TAKE OUT PAINT. 

Ecjual parts of ammonia and spirits of turpentine will take paint out 
of clothing. Saturate the spot two or three times, and then wash out in 
soapsuds. 

• TO REMOVE INK STAIN. 

Immediately saturate with milk, soak it up with a rag, apply more, 
rub well, and in a few minutes the ink will disappear. 

TO TAKE OREASE OUT 

of silk, woolens, paper, floors, etc., grate chalk thick over the spot, cover 
with brown i)aper, set on it a hot flatiron and let it remain until cool ; 
repeat if necessary. Tiie iron must not be so hot as to burn jiapcr or 
cloth. 

FRUIT STAINS. 

Colored cottons or woolens stained with wine or fruit should be wet 
in alcohol and ammonia, then sponged off gently (not rubbed) with 
alcohol ; after that, if the material will warrant it, washed in tepid soap- 
suds. Silk may be wet with this prenriration when injured by these stains. 

TO REMOVE IRON RUST. 

While rinsing clothes, take such as nave spots of iron, wring out, dip 
a wet finger in oxalic acid and rub on the spot, then dip in salt and rub 
on and hold on a warm flatiron, and the spot will immediately disappear ; 
rinse again, rubbing the place a little with the hands. 

TO TAKE OUT MILDEW. 

Wet the cloth and rub on soap and chalk, mixed together, and lay in 
the sun ; or, lay the cloth in buttermilk for a short time, take out and 
place in the hot sun ; or, put lemon juice on and treat in the same way. 

TO WASH WOOLEN GOODS. 

Many woolen goods, such as light-colored, heavy sacques, nubias, 
etc., may be washed in cold suds and rinsed in cold water. The gar- 
ments should be well shaken out and pulled into shape.

THE ladies' hook 
TO WASH FLANNELS IN TEPID WATER. 



The usefulness of liquid ammonia is not as universally known among 
housewives as it deserves to.be. If you add some of it to a soapsuds 
made of a mild soap it will prevent the flannel from becoming yellow or 
shrinking. It is the potash and soda combined in sharp soap which tend 
to color animal fibers yellow ; the shrinking may be partially due to this 
agency, but above all to the exposure of the flannel while wet to the 
extremes ot low and high temperature. Dipping it in boiling water cr 
leaving it out in the rain will also cause it to shrink and become hard. 
To preserve their softness, flannels should be washed in tepid suds, rinsed 
in tepid water, and dried rapidly at a moderate heat— Buckeye.

CHAPTER XVI. 

HOW TO DO YOUR OWN STAMPING AND MAKE 
YOUR OWN PATTERNS. 

In the following chapter are given full instructions for dry and wet 
stamping, explaining how to make stamping powder, how to mix white 
paint for stamping dark goods and black paint for stamping light goods. 

The articles necessary are a sheet of writing paper and a piece of 
transfer paper. The transfer paper can be made by rubbing white paper 
with a composition consisting of two ounces of tallow, one-half ounce 
powdered blacklead, one-quarter pint linseed oil, and sufficient lampblack 
to make it of the consistency of cream. These should be melted 
■"■\Ci r-.nd rubbed on the paper while hot. When dry it will be fit for 

Ub.. 

In order to make a perforated pattern of ,ny engraving, procure a 
piece of writing paper larger than the design to be traced and put a piece 
of transfer paper on the writing paper, then place both sheets directly 
under the engraving and pin the three slieets together at one end, having 
the transfer paper between and dark side facing the writing paper. You 
then take a quill with a fine point (a knitting needle will do nicely) and 
without leaning too hard go over all the outline of the engraving. You 
must be careful not to press your fingers on the engraving, as this would 
cause a deposit of powder the same color as the transferring paper on the 
writing paper. Now remove the transfer paper and you have the design 
accurately traced and the pattern is ready to be perforated. Lay a 
couple of folds of velvet or felt on the table, place the pattern on this, 
and with a needle of medium size or tracing-wheel prick out the pattern, 
being careful to follow the outline closely and make the perforations 
quite close. 

MECHANICAL ENLARGEMENT OF DESIGNS. 

The simplest way s to enlarge by the eye, as the artists do. One 
method is to divide the whole design into squares and rule off" the paper 
to be enlarged in corresponding squares of larger size. Each portion 



i88 



THE ladies' book 



within the square is then exactly reproduced, copying the portion in the 
smaller square. For embroidery designs especially we should think this 
would be very good. 

DRY STAMPING. 

This is done by a process known as pouncing. The process is as 
follows : Place the pattern (rough side up) on the material to be 
stamped, placing heavy weights on the corner to keep it from slipping ; 
then rub the powder over the perforations with the pouncet or distributor 
described below till the pattern is clearly marked on the material. This 
can be ascertained by lifting one corner of the pattern slightly. Then 
remove the pattern carefully, lay a piece of thin paper over the stamping 
and pass a hot iron over it. This melts the gum in the powder and 
fastens the pattern to the material. The iron should be as hot as possible 
without scorching the cloth. Should the heat change the color of the 
material, iron it all over. Do not do any stamping by this process on a 
hot or damp day if it can be avoided. Keep the powder in a cool, dry 
place. In stamping with liglit-colored powder, the best way to fasten it 
is to hold the back of the cloth against the stovepipe or the face of the 
iron. French stamping is better, however, for all dark materials. To 
take the powder up on ihe distributor, have a tin plate with a piece of 
woolen cloth glued on the bottom, sprinkle a little powder on the cloth, 
and rub the distributor over it, taking care to shake off all the powder 
you can — enough will remain to stamp the pattern clearly. 

TO MAKR A DISTRIBUTOR. 

Take a strip of fine felt almost an inch wide (a strip from an old 
felt hat is as good as anything), roll it up tightly into a roll, leaving the 
end flat, and rub the end jver a piece of sand paper to make it smooth 
and even. 

TO MAKE BLUE POWDER. 

Take equal parts of gum damar and white rosin and just enough 
Persian blue to color it. Mix well together. 

Other colors are made the same, using for coloring chrome yellow 
(for light-colored powder), burnt sienna, lampblack, etc. Black powder 
is improved by adding a little blue to it. 



TO MAKE WHITE POWDER. 

Take one ounce white lead ; half ounce gum arabic, in the im- 
palpable powder; half ounce white rosin, in the fine powder. All well mixed. 



mm 



OF USEFUL INFORMATION. 



SUPERIOR DARK BLUE POWDER. 



189 



One ounce white rosin ; one half ounce gum sandarac ; one half 
ounce Prussian blue, in fine powder. Mix all thoroughly. 



FRENCH INDELIBLE STAMPING. 

This is the best process for all dark materials ; in fact, this and the 
blue powder are all that will ever be needed. By this process a kind of 
paint is used instead of powder, and a brush instead of a pouncet. Place 
the pattern on the cloth, smooth side up if you can (though either side 
will work well), weight the pattern down as in stamping. Rub the paint 
evenly over the perforations, and it will leave the lines clean, sharp and 
distinct. After the stamping is done, the pattern must be cleaned 
immediately. This is done by placing the pattern on the table and turning 
benzine or naphtha over it to cut the paint and then wiping the pattern 
dry on both sides with an old cloth, or, better still, with common waste — 
such as machinists use to clean machinery ; this is cheap and absorbs the 
paint and naphtha quickly. Hold the pattern up to the light to see if the 
holes are all clear ; if they are not, wash it the second time. Do not use 
the pattern for powder imm.ediately after it has been washed ; 'et it dry a 
short time, otherwise the moistened gum will clog the perforations. 



TO MAKE THE PAINT. 

Take zinc white, mix it with boiled oil to about the thickness of 
cream, add a little drying, such as painters use. Keep in a tin pail (one 
holding about a pint is a good size) ; have a piece of board cut rourd, 
with a screw in the center for a handle, to fit loosely into the pail ; drop 
this on the paint and it will keep it from drying up. Add a little oil 
occasionally to keep the paint from growing too thick, and it will always 
be ready for use. 

THE BRUSH. 

Take a fine stencil brush (or any brush with a square end), wind 
it tightly with a string from the handle down to within one half inch of 
the end ; this will make it just stiff enough to distribute the paint well. 
Keep the brush in water, to keep it from drying up, taking care to wipe 
off the water before using. 



1 90 



THE LADIES' BOOK 



THB CABB OP PATTKRNS. 

New patterns, before being used, should be rubbed over on the 
rough side with a smooth piece of pumice stone ; this wears off the burr 
and makes the stamping come out cleaner and finer. When patterns are 
so large that they have to be folded, iron out the creases before using 
hem After using the patterns for powder stamping, snap the pattern 
to shake the powder from the perforations. After ucmg the patterns for 
pamt stamping they should be washed thoroughly with naphtha until 
the perforations are all perfectly clear. Keep the naphtha awav from the 
hre. After the pattern has been washed, do not use it for powder until 
It has had tune to thoroughly dry, otherwise it will gum up the holes and 
spoil the pattern. 

If these directions are carefully followed the stamping will always be 
satisfactory. ~/5?/«/rt!r Art Instructor.

CHAPTER XVII. 
BRONZE WORK. 

Bronzing is the latest improvement in waxwork, and if properly 
made cannot be detected from the most expensive artistic bronze. It 
answers for table, mantel, and bracket ornaments, and may be exposed to 
dust and air v. '^liout sustaining the slightest injury. It can be dusted with 
a feather duster like any piece of furniture, and is a very desirable and 
inexpensive ornament. 

The colors required in bronze are : Silver bronze, golu bronze, 
copper bronze, fire bronze, and green bronze. 

THE ART OF MAKING A VASE IN BRONZE. 

For instruction, let us take a vase to be finished in copper bronze. 
First the vase must be molded. The casting material is one part wax, 
one part spermnceti, two parts mutton tallow. Melt the three articles 
together and color with burnt umber. Have a coil of fine hair wire, cut 
into one-half inch lengths, and when the mixture is melted to the con- 
sistency of thick cream stir in the cu* wire by degrees until there is a 
sprinkling of it throughout the mixture ; then pour into the elastic mold 
and let stand till perfectly cold and solid ; then loosen the sections of the 
mold and take it out. Should any of the ends of the wire project, they 
can be cut with a pair of sharp scissors. Trim the seams caused by the 
sections of the mold ; then take a piece of soft flannel cloth, dip it in 
the refined spirits of tupentine and polish the vase with it, after which it 
is ready for bronzing. 

Take copper bronze No. 4000, and with the tinting brush bronze the 
vase evenly, and polish it with a soft piece of white silk. Now take 
another brush and with copper bronze No. 6000 give it the last coat. 
The vase is now ready for draping. The most simple drapery is an ivy 
vine. Take an embossed ivy leaf (or embossed muslin leaves, as they 
are named), lay a fine wire along its midrib, leaving two or three inches 
of wire for stem ; cover the leaf with brown sheet wax, press them 
together well with the finger and thumb to make the wax adhere to the 
leaf, get the impression, and hold the wire firmly ; then lay another piece 



192 



THE ladies' book 



of wax on the under side, press the edges together and cut away the 
superfluous wax, leaving the edge plain (the ivy leaf is not serrated), cover 
the wire stem with wax and the leaf is ready for bronzing. Rub both 
sides with turjientine, give one coat of bronze No. 4000, then the last 
coat of bronze No. 6000. When all the leaves are finished, weave them 
into a spray, grading them from large to small till the end of the vine is 
reached, then bronze and drape around the vast in an easy, natural way. 
The natural fall leaves, pressed, make pretty draperies for these kinds 
of vases. Sprays of mixed leaves, oak leaves and acorns, small maple 
leaves, the holly leaf and berry, mixed ivy and fern leaves, and many 
other kinds of leaves and vines are equally pretty. 



THE AET OP MAKING A MOTTO IN BRONZE. 

Take a box frame of the ordinary motto-frame size (gilt face) and 
line it with either crimson or royal purple velvet, and it is ready for any 
design. The word "Welcome" is the simplest to begin with. Take a 
thick blotting pad, lay it on a table, n'.b some arrowroot or rice power 
over its upper surface, and lay a sheet of either calla or pond lily wax, 
extra thick, on this powdered surface. Select the style of letter preferred ; 
German text is very appropriate for the motto " Welcome." Cut the 
pattern letters out in pasteboard, or any kind of thick paper, if tin letter- 
cutters are not convenient. 

Begin with the letter W. Lay it on the sheet of wax and cut out 
the waxen letter after the pattern with a penknife previously dipped in 
water. Next cut the E, and so on till the seven letters are cut out, care 
being taken to powder the blotter every time a new sheet of wax is laid 
on. Lay the back of the box on the tabic, having melted glue ready, 
and with a camel's-hair brush apply a small portion of it to the back of 
each letter as it is set in its relative position, pressing it gently against the 
velvet with the palm of the hand. The letters should be set an inch 
apart, and when all on the frame should be set away until the glue is 
thoroughly dry and the waxen letters adhere firmly to the velvet, then 
they are ready for ornamenting. This is done in various ways, and all 
depends on the artist's taste, but a few suggestions may not be amiss. 

Take a two-inch fern-cutter and cut the ferns out of double sheet 
wax ; then bronze them as directed on both sides, either with gold or 
silver bronze. Begin with draping the letter W. Take the stem end of 
the fern leaf and with the bead end of the curling-pin fasten it to the

lower side of the letter; then turn it over and fasten it down in the 
middle, letting the point turn outward. Set the ferns on the letters in 
such a way as not to obscure their form, /. <?., the form of the letters. If 
the motto is made in white wax it should be frosted with diamond dust. 

A pretty style of motto is clisped hands in the center, of pure white 
wax, surrounded with sprays of fine flowers and buds, finished in fire 
bronze. 

Another style of motto is a vase in the center, from which vines in 
different colors of bronze run. Green, fire, and copper bronzing should 
have a light background ; silver and gold bronzing should have a dark 
background. 

THE ART OF MAKING A FLORAL BASKET IN BRONZE. 

Take a medium-sized basket (chip or any solid substance), brush it 
with glue on the inside, fill it with moss, and set it away to dry till the 
moss is stuck to the basket. The moss should be raised in the center in 
the form of a mound. Have the wax sheeted in carmine. Make the 
center of the basket in roses, rosebuds, and carnations, as they are the 
most durable. Mold the petals over the embossed muslin petals and 
bronze them with fire bronze — Nos. 4000 and 6000 — as previously 
directed. Drape the basket and the handle in smilax, having the wax for 
the smilax sheeted in chrome green • then mold over the embossed 
mushn leaves, bronze in green bronze, and drape loosely. Such a basket 
makes a pretty table ornament. 

DIRECTIONS FOR BRONZING. 

All kinds of ornaments may be made in bronze — small animals, fish, 
shells, birds, statuary, etc. The mixture for casts should be the same 
shade as the bronze used. 

Fish may be bronzed in silver, gold, and copper bronze ', shells in 
silver, copper, gold, and some may be tinted with fire bronze on the 
exterior of the shell, but the interior of almost all shells mi",t be tinted 
with paint ; dogs in zinc, silver, and copper ; birds in almost any shade. 

GREEN BRONZE STATUARY. 

Prepare the mixture in chrome green No. i, A little rosin may be 
added and a thick sp ikling of cut wire. Trim the object and rub with 
spirits of turpentine, men apply the green bronze — the two numbers, as 
directed. 



194 THE ladies' book 

COPPER BRONZE STATUARY. 

Prepare the mixture in burnt umber and proceed as directed. 

BRONZING STATUETTES. 

Statuettes, or any object in plaster of Paris, may be made to 
resemble bronze by first rendering the plaster nonabsorbent with drying 
linseed oil and then painting it with a varnish made by grinding waste 
gold leaf with honey or gum water. 

Another method is by first painting the article, after it has been 
rendered nonabsorbent, of a dark color made of Prussian blue, yellow 
ochre, and verditer, ground in oil. Before this becomes quite dry, 
bronze powder of several colors should be dusted on those most 
prominent parts which may be supposed to have worn bright. Plaster 
casts may also be made to resemble bronze to a certain extent by merely 
brushing them over with graphite, which is a brilliant blacklead. 

METHOD OP MAKING EMBOSSED MUSLIN LEAVES. 

Take a piece of green muslin or calico and size it well with isinglass, 
then take the natural leaf, lay the sized piece of muslin over it on the 
under or veined side ot the leaf, let the muslin remain on it till almost 
dry and the impression is set ; then with a pair of sharp scissors cut 
the muslin around the leaf, either plain or serrated. 

The impression may be taken of any leaf or flower in this way. 
The use of muslin leaves tends to make the work more durable and is 
found very convenient for the artist. 

THE ART OF MAKING EXOTIC LEAVES. 

The begonia rex makes a beautiful parlor plant. Five or seven 
leaves make a nice-sized plant. Select five or seven healthy begonia 
leaves of different sizes, as no two leaves of the rex are of one size on 
the same plant. Cut the leaves closely off the stem and immerse them 
in a solution of cold water and castile soap. Leave them in this twelve 
hours before using. Melt the wax to the consistency of cream, in chrome 
green, permanent green, dark olive-green, and verdigris-green. Now 
take a leaf out of the soapsuds and lay it on a marble slab, keeping the 
under surface or veined side uppermost ; then with a camel's-hair brush 
lay on the melted wax in different shades, following the shades of the 
natural leaf. The soapsuds having made the leaf transparent, all the

HW 



OF USEFUL INFORMATION. 



»9S 



shades and spots can be plainly seen on the veined side, which is the 
side the waxen leaf has to be formed on. The belt of light green over 
the silvery markings of the leaf should he put on with verdigris-green. 
Begin the leaf in the center and continue on each side of the midrib till 
the edge is reached and the leaf has a tl:ick coating of wax. Then lay a 
wire along the midrib or center of the leaf, fasten it in the wax by 
pressing, care being taken to leave it long enough for eight or nine inches 
of stem. Wire must also be laid on all the side ribs or veins leading to 
the midrib. These small wires are all brought to the center wire and laid 
evenly by its side till they all come to the stem, where they are all 
twisted around it to form one long, thick stem. Give the leaf another 
coating of dark olive-green wax (this covers the wires), then finish with a 
thin coating of burnt umber tinted with Vandyke brown, and the under 
surface of the leaf is finished. Remove the natural leaf from the waxen 
and tint the veins lightly with carmine. Brush a little carmine loosely 
on the darkest shade in the center of the leaf, and before it sticks blow off 
as much as possible, when enough will be left to give it that reddish- 
green tint peculiar to the begonia rex leaf. The next is to finish the 
silver belt or silvery leaf-markings midway between the center and the 
edge of the leaf. This strip must be rubbed with spirits of turpentine ; 
then with the tinting brush apply a coating of silver bronze (Nos. 4000 
and 6000), care being taken that the bronze does not scatter over the 
leaf. Now the leaf is finished. 

If the work is done according to directions, the waxen leaf will be a 
true copy of the original. Contine in the same way till all the leaves are 
made, then wax the stems and run them through the begonia stemming, 
when they may be arranged in their natural growing manner in a flower- 
pot filled with moss ; or, if preferred, the flowerpot may be filled with 
wax, in ierreverte green, and the stems must be placed in it before the 
wax gets hard. 

HOW TO MAKE BEGONIA STEMMING. 



Procure the bristles of a very young pig, five or six weeks old. 
After washing, put them in a very strong solution of chloride of lime and 
let them remain in it till whitened ; then rinse well in warm water till free 
from chlorine. Color them while damp, some in difl"erent shades of green 
and some in different shades of brown. After the bristles are ready, the 
next thing is to make the stemming. Take a square piece of cambric and 



a 




196 



THE LADIES BOOK 



■fasten it in a stretcher, then give it a thick coating of mastic varnish, and 
when the varnish is dry cut the cambric on a true bias into straight strips 
of difiirent widtlis, from an inch to tv/o inches, and half a yard in length. 
Lay one of these strips on a table or some smooth sur.'ace, add 
another coat of varnish, then cover it with glaucous green tlock, care being 
taken to leave a narrow margin bare on one side to lap under the other 
when the piping is being made. Dip the bristles in mastic varnish, 
sprinkle them thickly over the flock, and leave for twenty-four hours to 
dry ; when thoroughly dry, revarnish the bare edge, and turn it in under- 
neath the other edge, thus forming the strip into a pipe, ready to receive 
the wire stems of the leaves. Brown and crimson flock may be ustd. 

For begonia rex, use crimson Hock ; for the rubra, use glaucous 
flock ; and for the palmata, use brown flock. Very good stemming may 
be made by tinting canton flannel, which has a very long nap or pile,. 

GERANIUM LEAVES- ROSE GERANIUM. 

This leaf is of a dark chrome green. Prepare the wax in two shades, 
dark chrome green and light ; immerse the leaves in soapsuds for six 
hours ; take out of the soapsuds and lay it on the marble slab. As there 
is neither shading nor marking on the leaf, all that is required is to give it a 
coat of dark chrome green, thick enough to prevent the wires from 
showing ; then lay the wires over the veins and coat them over with a 
light shade of green. Remove the natural leaf, and as the texture of the 
rose gerai'ium leaf is rather rough, rub it over with green flock mixed with 
hair powder. The stems may be left in different lengths. 

The best directions that we can give for the tinting and marking of 
leaves is to copy from nature. The cyclamen leaf is well adapted for the 
practice of marking and tinting. 

The leaf of the pond lily, lotus, canna, maranta, rubber tree, 
magnolia, camellia, orange, and all leaves which have a waxy surface, 
should either be varnished or bronzed. 

All kinds of leaves may be made by the foregoing directions. —

DECAL.COMANIA. 

This is another name for a style that has been in vogue for an in- 
definite period of time, and comes under the head of transferring. It is 
almost superf uous to mention the variety of purposes to which decalco- 



i^issmm

y 



mania may be applied, as it can be transferred upon everything for which 
ornamentation is required, and the variety of designs which are printed 
especially for it is so great that something may easily be procured to suit 
the taste of the most fastidious. 

A few of the articles that may be decorated can be mentioned by waj' 
of showing what a variety this style of ornamentation will embrace : All 
kinds of crockery, china, porcelain, vases, glass, book-cases, folios, boxes, 
lap desks, ribbons, dresses, etc. The method of transferring beautiful 
designs is so simple, and all the materials requisite for the art so easily 
procured, that it brings it within the means of everyone. Flat surfaces 
are more suitable than concave or convex ones for this style of decorating, 
for when the surface is curved the design has to be cut to accommodate 
the shape, and in this way is often spoiled unless done by the most careful 
and skillful hand. The materials required are cement, copal varnish, 
designs, a duck-duill sable, and a flat camel's-hair brush. 

Cut your designs neatly with a small pair of scissors, apply the 
cement by means of the sable to the article to be decorated, place on 
your design and press equally over its entire surface to exclude the air; 
dampen it a little and keep pressing equally so that the design may adhere 
firmly in every part. When the cement is sufficiently dry dampen again 
with water (a little more freely) and remove the paper. Be careful in 
manipulating this process, or you will remove some of the colored part 
with it. If such should occur, instantly replace it as well as you are able, 
or, if you have a knowledge of Oriental painting, your panacea will 
be in that. You can retouch with these colors and bring it back nearly 
to its original beauty. In case you have no knowledge of Oriental 
painting, match the colors as nearly as possible with water-color paints, 
allow time to dry, and varnish with copal. 

Sometimes the cement becomes too thick for use. It may be 
restored to its proper flowing consistency by placing the bottle in a bed 
of warm sand; and can then be applied while warm. If you apply your 
design to a dark groundwork, it would be desirable to give your picture a 
coating of Winsor and Newton's Chinese white. The reason for this is 
that some parts of the picture are semi-transparent, and these would lose 
their brilliancy if transferred directly upon a dark background without 
first painting.

TO TRANSFER ON WOOD. 

Dissolve some salt in soft water, float youi engraving on the surface — 
picture side uppermost — and let it remain about an hour. The screen, 
box or table on which you wish to transfer the design should be of bird's- 
eye maple or other light-colored hardwood, varnished with the best copal 
or transfer varnish. 

Take the picture from the water, dry a little between blotters, place 
the engraving — picture side downwards — on the varnished wood and 
smooth it nicely. If the picture entirely covers the wood after the margin 
has been cut off so that no varnish is exposed, lay over it a thin board, 
on which place a heavy weight, and leave it for twenty-four hours. If you 
wish but a small picture in the center of the surface of the wood, apply 
the varnish only to a space the size of the picture Dip your finger in 
the solution of salt and water and commence rubbing off" the paper ; the 
nearer you come to the engraving the more careful you must be, as a hole 
in it will si)oil your work. Rub slowly and patiently until you have taken 
off every bit of the paper and left only the black lines and touches of 
your picture on the wood, in an inverted direction. Finish up with two 
or three coats of copal varnish. 

TO TRANSFER ON SILK. 

Apply a coating of mastic varnish to the design and allow it to dry; 
then with a brush wash the paper surrounding the design carefully ; this 
removes from the paper the preparation, which would otherwise soil the 
silk. Apply a second coating of the same varnish, and when this is 
slightly dried place the design upon the silk or other fabric to be decorated, 
and with the roller press it well down. With the brush wet the back of 
the paper covering the design, when the paper may be at once lifted off. 
Another method is to cut out the design carefully and cover it with a thin 
coating of mastic varnish, and lay it upon the silk or other fabric (which 
should be dampened) and roll thoroughly with a rubber roller ; dampen 
the back of the paper with the brush and lift it off as previously directed.

TO MAKE WAX FLOWERS. 



The following articles will be required to commence waxwork : Two 
pounds white wax, one quarter pouad hair wire, one bottle carmine, 
one bottle ultramarine blue, one bottle chrome yellow, two botOes chrome 
green No. i, one bottle each of rose pink, royal purple, scarlet powder,

and balsam fir ; two dozen sheets white wax. This will do to begin with. 
Now have a clean tin dish, and pour therein a quart or two of water ; then 
put in about one pound of the white wax and let it boil. When cool 
enough so the bubbles will not form on top it is ready to sheet, which is 
done as follows : Take half of a window pane, 7x9, and, after having 
washed it clean, dip into a dish containing weak soapsuds ; then dip into 
the wax, and draw it out steadily and plunge it into the suds, when the 
sheet will readily come off. Lay it on a cloth or clean paper to dry. 
Proceed in like manner until you have enough of the white ; then add 
enough of the green powder to make a bright color, and heat and stir 
thoroughly until the color is evenly distributed, then proceed as for sheet- 
ing white wax. The other colors are rubbed into the leaves after they are 
cut out, rubbing light or heavy according to shade. 

For patterns you can use any natural leaf, forming the creases in wax 
with the thumb nail or a needle. To put the flowers together, or the 
leaves on to the stem, hold in tiie hand until warm enough to stick. If the 
sheeted wax is to be used in summer, put in a little balsam of fir to make 
it hard. If for winter, none will be required. 

You can make many flowers without a teacher, but one to assist in 
the commencement would be a great help, tiiough the most particular 
thing about it is to get the wax sheeted. The materials I have suggested 
can be procured at any drug store, and will cost from $3.00 to $4 50.

CHAPTER XVIII.

A"- 



■i 1 



Dear lady subscriber, if you are a housekeeper, or ever intend to be 
one, this chapter will more than repay you for what you have given for 
this book. It will tell you how to save a large percentage of your house- 
hold expenses, and also how to have a great many of the articles you use 
in your daily household work of a superior quality — vastly better than 
the ones you are using at the present time. 

It is a fact not generally known that a great many of the articles 
used in daily household work cost little more than one-tenth of the price 
the consumer pays for them. We propose to show the ladies of our great 
Continent how to have, in most instances, better articles than those they 
are in the habit of purchasing, and at a small percentage of the cost. To 
do this, we have, by our own personal investigation, gathered a number 
of valuable recipes together, and have paid for the privilege of using 
them. Remember, these are not common recipes, but a full explanation 
of the manufacture of different articles needed in every household ; and 
they combine the embodied wisdom of practical and successful men and 
women of the past and present. 

We give in this chapter a number of recipes which have never before 
been published, and which, once possessing, you will never wish to be 
without, as they are truly marvelous discoveries. The first three every 
mother should have ; the remainder no housekeeper should be without.

HEALING SALVE. 

This salve heals all sores, chaps, cuts, bruises, sore lips, chafed limbs, 
roughness, etc. It is invaluable as a healing ointment and may be 
applied to the tenderest skin without injury, and yet it will heal the most 
painful sores. A three-ounce box will only cost you ten cents, and the 
directions are so plain that a child can follow them. 

Recipe : Take one ounce of sweet oil, one-half ounce of camphor 
gum, and one-half ounce of mutton tallow. Melt all together over a slow 
fire, and stir continually until cold. 

To use : Rub on part affected at night ; wash off in the morning 
with warm water and castile soap.

No. 2 is 

MAGNETIC CROUP CURE. 

This is the best remedy for croup ever discovered. It will save parents 
mvich trouble and anxiety. With this remedy all that is necessary is (if 
you have r. ' fear of croup on putting your child to bed) to take a piece 
of brown paper large enough to cover the throat and chest and spread it 
with the ointment and put across the throat and lungs ; place over that 
severd thicknesses of flannel so as to keep the stomach warm, and keep 
in place with a string or bandage. Put the child to bed, and you need 
have no fear of croup that night. This ointment is also excellent for cuts, 
bruised or sores. Twelve cents will make enough to last a year, even if 
you use it frequently. 

Recipe: One-half pound of lard, quarter of a pound of raisins, 
quarter pound of fine cut chewing tobacco. In the morning place the 
tobacco in a tin can and cover it with water ; set it on the stove and let it 
cook and boil all day, replacing the water when it is necessary ; then 
squeeze all the juice from the tobacco. The next morning chop your 
raisins, put them in the tobacco water and cook well till noon ; then again 
squeeze the raisins out of this water. Now to this water add the lard 
and let them simmer together until the water is evaporated. Now the 
croup remedy is ready for use. On putting the child to bed, if you fear 
an atit»ck, take a piece of brown paper large enough to cover the throat 
and chest and spread it over with the ointment and put it across the 
throat and lungs. Place over that and tie several thicknesses of flannel ; 
put the child to bed, cover up warmly, and you need have no fear of 
croup that night. 

If taken with croup unexpectedly, on hearing the cough, spread a 
piece of brown paper with the ointment and lay it acro.ss the throat and 
chest ; then heat flannel as hot as can be borne and lay over the paper ; 
change in about ten minutes for another hot cloth. If no fire is on while 
waiting for it, heat cloths on a lamp chimney. As soon as you get the 
stomach covered and warm, give a teaspoonful of melted butter ; repeat 
the dose in five minutes. 

No. 3 is 

WORM ELIXIR. 

The best remedy for worms known. No mother should be without it. 
Also, if given occasionally it is a splendid preventive. Children will 
never be troubled with worms who are given a dose of this once a month, 
or fortnight.

Recipe : Take gutn myrrh and aloes, of each one ounce ; saffron, 
sage leaves, and tansy leaves, of each half an ounce ; tincture in a pint 
of brandy two weeks, and give to children a teaspoonful once a week to 
once a month as a preventive. They will never be tuubled with worms 
as long as you do this. 

WORM VERMIIUGE. 

Make a strong decoction of sage, two parts ; wormseed, one part ; 
strain, and add sugar enough to make into candy, and let the child eat 
of it. Infallible. 

No. 4 is 

BRILLIANT SELF-SHINING STOVE POLISH. 

This is one of the greatest inventions of the age. It has been the 
result of a large amount of study on the part of the inventor to perfect a 
polish that would work easily and satisfactorily in a perfectly dry state, 
thereby obviating the diagreeable task of mixing and preparing. A good 
stove polish is an absolute necessity in every family. To be assured that 
this is the best you need give it only one trial. Now, remember, first, 
that this polish requires no water or mixing like the various cake and 
powder polishes ; second, that it is self-shining and no labor is required ; 
and third, that it has no equal in the world. 

Below are the recipe and directions for preparing this polish. You 
can prepare enough in ten minutes to last a year. A box holding two 
ounces will cost but three cents. 

Recipe: Get from the hardware store plumbago (blacklead), pulverize 
it finely and it is ready for use. 

Directions for use : Use a damp woolen rag, dip in the polish and 
apply to the stove ; then rub with a dry cloth, and a most beautiful polish 
will appear.

clothes clear and white ; it makes clothes iron smoothly, and prevents the

iron sticking ; it makes old linen look like new ; and it saves a woman 
many hours' hard work each week. It is easily made, and five cents' 
worth will last an ordinary family six months. 

Recipe : Melt half a pound of refined parafline wax in a tin pan 
over a slow fire. When melted remove from the fire and add twenty 
drops of oil of citronella. Take a tin pan and oil with sweet oil, put the 
pan on a level table, and pour in enough of the hot wax to make a depth 
of an eighth of an inch. When cool, but not cold, cut in pieces about 
the size of an ordinary candy lozenge. Lay them aside to cool, but do 
not let them touch each other. 

Directions for use : To a pint of boiling starch stir in one cake. 
Use starch while warm. 
No. 6 is 

ROYAL WASHING POWDER 

— the laundress' assistant ; warranted not to injure the finest fabric. No 
acid ; no potash. In the wash room it saves time, labor, expense, 
muscle, temper, and hands. The clothes will come out cleaned and 
white, without wear or tear or rubbing on washboards, therefore will last 
twice as long. For housecleaning it is unequaled. One girl can wash 
more clothes, paint, walls, windows or floors in a day with perfect ease 
with this powder than she could in four days with hard labor, soap, and 
scrubbing brush, and the paint will look new and bright. It only requires 
to be tested to be appreciated. Packages of one pound will only cost 
seven cents. 

Recipe: Mix any quantity of soda ash with an equal quantity of 
carbonate of soda crushed into coarse grains. Have a thin solution of 
glue or decoction of linseed oil ready, into which pour the soda until 
quite thick. Spread out in a warm apartment to dry. When dry shake 
up well and pack away for use. Use as other washing powders. 

No. 7 is 

MAGIC ANNIHILATOR. 

Removes all kinds of grease and oil spots from every kind of 
wearing-apparel — such as coats, pants, vests, dress goods, carpets, etc. — 
without injury to the finest silks or laced. It will shamjjoo like a charm, 
raising the lather in proportion to the amount of dandruff and grease in 
the hair. A cloth wet with it will remove all grease from door knobs, 
window sills, etc., handled by kitchen domestics in their daily round of 
kitchen work. For cleaning silver, brass, and copper ware it cannot oe

beaten. It is certain death to bedbugs, for they will never stop after 
they have encountered the Magic Annihilator. It is useful for many 
other things. A quart bottle costs about ten cents. 

Recipe : To make half a gallon, lake aqua ammonia, one pint ; soft 
water, one-half gallon ; best white soap, one-half pound ; saltpetre, one 
ounce. Shave the soap fine, add the water, boil until the soap is 
dissolved, then add the saltpetre, stirring until dissolved. Now strain, 
let the suds settle, skim off the dry suds, add the ammonia, and bottle 
and cork at once. 

Directions for use: For grease spots, pour upon the article to be 
cleaned a sufficient quantity of the Magic Annihilator, rubbing well with 
a clean sponge and applying to both sides of the article. Upon carpets 
and coarse goods where the grease is hard and dry use a stiff brush and 
wash out with clear cold water. For shampooing, take a small quantity, 
with an equal quantity of water ; apply to the hair with a stiff brush, 
brushing into the scalp, and wash out with clear . ater. For killing 
bedbugs, apply to the places they frequent. 

No. 8 is 



I X L BAKING POWDER. 

An unsurpassed article. Can be relied on for strength and purity. So 
many of the baking powders sold contain injurious substances and are 
altogether unrel'able. This powder can be relied on for strength and 
purity. It produces the most delightfully white, light and flaky biscuits. 
For cakes it is unsurpassed. Try it and be convinced. This powder is 
composed of the very best and purest substances, and therefore is 
perfectly wholesome. Any lady can prepare enough in a few minutes 
to last her six months. It will only cost a trifle — not one-quarter of 
what you would have to pay your grocer for the same amount. 

Recipe : Take one pound of tartaric acid (in crystals), one and one- 
half pounds bicarbonate of soda, and one and one-half pounds of potato 
or corn starch. Each must be powdered separately, well dried by a slow 
fire, and well mixed through a sieve. Pack hard in a tin, or paper glazed 
on the outside. Buy the articles from a druggist. 

Directions for use : For biscuits, pie crust, johnnycake, etc., use 
three teaspoonfuls to one qUtUt of flour or meal ; for cakes, two tea- 
spoonfuls to a teacup of flour, Mix well with the flour,

housekeeper needs. It is used for gold, silver, plated ware, German 
silver, copper, brass, tin, steel, window glass, or any material where a 
brilliant luster is required. To make two ounces costs but three cents, 
and it is the best article of its kind known. 

Recipe: To one pound best quality whiting add one-half pound 
cream tartar and three ounces calcined magnesia. Mix thoroughly to- 
gether and store away for use. 

Directions for use : Use the polish dry, with a piece of canton 
flannel moistened with water or alcohol, and finish with the polish dry.

FRENCH POLISH OR DRESSING FOR LEATHER. 

This is a grand article. All that is necessary is to have your boots 
clean and apply this dressing with a sponge. The boots appear like the 
very best French leather. Much hard work is saved, as no brushing is 
required. To make a quart vessel full will only cost about twenty cents. 

Recipe : Mix half a pint of the best vinegar with a quarter pint of 
soft water ; stir into it one ounce of glue (broken up), two ounces log- 
wood chips, one-sixteenth ounce of finely-powdered indigo, one-sixteenth 
ounce of the best soft soap, one-sixteenth ounce of isinglass. Put the 
mixture over the fire, let it boil ten minutes or more ; then strain, bottle 
and cork. When cold it is fit for use. Apply with a sponge. 

No. 1 1 is 

ARTIFICIAL HONEY. 

Equal to bee honey, and often mistaken by the best judges to be 
genuine. It is palatable and luxurious. All persons are more or less 
aware that honey should be used in every household, and it would be so 
if every family could have it at a very moderate price. As a health- 
establishing nutriment in the chamber of the invalid, and as a delicious 
luxury for the well, honey cannot be too highly recommended. Any one 
using this honey regularly will find that he is strengthened and refreshed 
by it. He will have greater energy, and if at all inclined to dyspepsia 
will find himself greatly helped. This honey costs but eight cents per 
pound to prepare, and our directions are so simple a child ten years old 
can follow them.

Recipe: Take two ounces of slippery elm bark and put into three 
quarts of warm water and let it stand four hours ; strrin and add eight 
pounds of white sugar ; boil four minutes ; then add one pound of bee 
honey while hot. Flavor with a drop of the oil of peppermint and a 
drop of the oil of rose. 



Any lady will readily see what a saving the possession of the above 
recipes may cause in her household expense. Thus, you can get a ten 
cent box of stove i)olish for three cents, a twenty-five cent package of 
washing powder for seven cents, a twenty-five cent box of starch enamel 
for five cents, etc. Any of the articles contained in the list will take but 
a short time to prepare a large supply. 

POISONS AMD THEIR ANTIDOTES. 

The first thing to do in a case of poisoning is to cause the ejection 
of the poison by vomiting. To do this, place mustard mixed with salt 
on the tongue and give large quantities of lukewarm water ; or, tickle the 
throat with a feather. These failing, instantly resort to active emetics, like 
tartar emetic, sulphate of copper or sulphate of zinc. After vomiting 
has taken place with these, aid it, if possible, by copious draughts of warm 
water until the poison is entirely removed. Of course, if vomiting cannot 
be induced the stomach pump must be employed, especially if arsenic or 
narcotics have been taken. The following table may be useful for emer- 
gencies : — 

POISONS. ANTIDOTES. 

Acids, Alkalies : Soap and milk, chalk or soda. 

Alkalies Vegetable acids, vinegar, oil in abundance. 

Alcohol, Common salt, moderately. 

Arsenic, Send for 'he doctor and his stomach 

pump. 

Antimony, Oak bark, strong green tea. 

Baryta or lime, Epsom salts, oils, magnesia. 

Bismuth, White of eggs, sweet milk. 

Copper, White of eggs, strong coffee. 

Gases, Cold douche, followed hy friction. 

Iodine, . . Starch, wheat flower in water. 

Creosote, White of eggs, sweet milk.

Turkish Lotion is not a paint or powder, but a new and great 
discovery — a cleansing, healing, wliitening tonic that causes the cheek to 
glow with healthy action of the skin, and the neck, arms and hands to 
assume an exquisite pearly whiteness. By its use all redness and 
roughness is prevented and the skin is beautified and rendered soft, 
smooth, and white, thereby imparting a delicate, refined loveliness 
impossible to describe. Any lady using Turkish Lotion will present a 
fresh, youthful, natural appearance, with a pearly, rose-tinted complexion 
that is positively bewitching. It is without doubt the best face lotion 
ever discovered, being as it is a medicated lotion possessing healing 
qualities. Many ladies are troubled during cold weather with sore lips, 
rough, parched skin, and chapped hands up^'i the slightest exposure. 
By moistening at night with this wash the parts affected, all soreness and 
roughness will be completely cured and the face and hands will be as 
delicately soft and smooth as those of a little child. 

No one need suffer any longer from any defect of the skin. 

Recipe for Turkish Lotion : To one fluid ounce of tincture of gum 
benzoin add seven fluid ounces of distilled rose-water and one-half ounce 
of glycerine. 

Directions for use : Bathe face, neck, and hands with Turkish 
Lotion at night, letting it dry on. Wash off in the morning with a very 
little pure white castile soap and soft water. If the water is hard, add a 
very little dissolved borax. This will prevent and cure greasy skin, 
freckles, tan, wrinkles, pimples, blackheads, crow's-feet, blotches, sunburn, 
chapped hands, sore lips, rough skin, etc. 

To Cure Sallowness : Use as above directed, and ask your druggist 
for some good iron tablets. Take as directed. In a short time your com- 
plexion will be beautifully white and rose-tinted. 

To Remove Hairy Moles and Superfluous Hair : Procure prepared 
pumice stone from your druggist ; cut the hair as close as possible to the 
skin, dip the pumice in cold water and rub on the part on which the 
hairs grow, commencing gently at first (as it may cause slight irritation of 
the skin), then gradually increase the friction. After using the pumice 
stone, anoint freely each time with Turkish Lotion. Do this twir^ daily, 
and it will surely remove superfluous hair. 

Always, after using Turkish Lotion, rub gently with the hands until the 
skin becomes dry. This will remove and prevent wrinkles and lines.
