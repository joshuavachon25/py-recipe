" The art of cookery, when not allied with a degenerate 
taste or with gluttony, is one of the aiteria of a peoples 
civilization." 

" We grow like what we eat ; 

Bad food depresses, good food exalts us like an 
inspiration." 



PREFACE 

WITH the advancement of the art of cookery, 
it has become impossible to compress within 
the limits of a single volume the wealth of material 
which is at hand. It is now seventeen years since 
The Boston Cooking-School Cook Book was first 
published. Since that time it has been frequently 
revised and a large number of new recipes added, 
first in the form of an appendix and addenda, later 
incorporated in logical order throughout the volume. 
But the results of the labors and experiments of 
the last seven years have, I believe, justified the 
publication of an entirely new work. It will be 
understood that this new work is in no sense a sub- 
stitute for my earlier one, but rather a sequel. 
It is, let me repeat, a comprehensive survey of the 
progress of the last few years and contains recipes 
economical and simple as well as expensive and elab- 
orate, covering the whole range of cookery. 

My earnest hope is that the book will fulfil a 
real and vital need. I cannot send it forth without 
an expression of sincere appreciation for the kindly 
aid of enthusiastic pupils and devoted teachers.

A New Book of Cookery 

CHAPTER I 
HOW TO MEASURE AND COMBINE INGREDIENTS 

THERE is nothing which has done so much to 
place cookery on an improved basis as the almost 
universal introduction of accurate methods in 
measuring. A generation or two ago each household 
had its favorite cups and spoons of varying sizes 
which helped as guides in measuring. It was in these 
days that one often heard the statement, " Cooks are 
born, not made." Good judgment coupled with 
experience taught some to measure by sight, which 
was a step towards good results, but the vast ma- 
jority needed definite guides. Thus arose the neces- 
sity of uniform measuring cups and spoons which 
are an essential in every kitchen. 

Measuring cups (holding one-half pint), divided 
into quarters or thirds, are made of tin, graniteware, 
or glass and may be bought of any dealer in kitchen 
furnishings or at large department stores. Measur- 
ing spoons come in two sizes, the smaller of which is 
called a teaspoon, the larger a tablespoon. Mixing 
spoons, which are somewhat larger than tablespoons, 
should not be confounded with them. A case knife, 
which is used for levelling as well as dividing ingre- 



2 A NEW BOOK OF COOKERY 

dients, is also necessary to make measuring as 
accurate as is possible. 

All ingredients are measured level. 

A cupful is measured level. 

A tablespoonful is measured level. 

A teaspoonful is measured level. 

TO MEASURE DRY INGREDIENTS 

I. By cwpfuls. 

Put in the ingredient to be measured by spoon- 
fuls or from a scoop, round slightly and level with a 
case knife for a cupful. For fractions of cupfuls 
fill in like manner to correct division line indicated 
in cup. Never shake the cup while filling. 

II. By teaspoonfuls or tablespoonfub. 

Dip spoon in ingredient, fill, lift, and level with a 
case knife having the sharp edge of knife towards 
tip of spoon. Divide "v^dth a case knife lengthwise 
of spoon for a half spoonful. Divide halves cross- 
wise for quarters, and quarters crosswise for eighths. 
Less than one-eighth teaspoonful is called a few 
grains. 

TO MEASURE BUTTER, LARD, AND OTHER 
SOLID FATS 

I. By cupfuls. 

Pack solidly into cup and level with a case knife for 
a cupful. For fractions of cupfuls pack in like man- 
ner to correct division line indicated in cup.

HOW TO MEASURE INGREDIENTS 3 

II, By teaspoonfuls or tablespoonfuls. 

Pack solidly into spoon and level with a case knife. 
Divide with a case knife lengthwise of spoon for a 
half spoonful. Divide halves crosswise for quarters, 
and quarters crosswise for eighths. 

TO MEASURE LIQUIDS 

I. By cupfuls. 

Pour liquid to be measured into cup and fill to very 
top for cupfuls. A cupful of liquid is all that the cup 
will hold and cannot be easily moved from one place 
to another without overflowdng. For fractions 
of cupfuls fill in like manner to correct division hne 
indicated in cup. 

II. By teaspoonfuls or tablespoonfuls. 

Dip spoon in liquid, fill and lift, taking up all the 
spoon will hold. When dry ingredients, liquids, 
and fats are all called for in the same recipe, measure 
in the order given, thereby using but one cup. 

HOW TO COMBINE INGREDIENTS 

Next to measuring comes care in combining, — 
a fact not always recognized by the inexperienced. 
Three ways are considered, — stirring, beating, 
and cutting and folding. 

To stir, mix by using circular motion, widening 
the circles until all is blended. Stirring is the motion 
ordinarily employed in all cookery, alone or in com- 
bination with beating. 



4 A NEW BOOK OF COOEERY 

To heat, turn ingredient or ingredients over and 
over, continually bringing the under part to the sur- 
face, thus allowing the utensil used for beating to be 
constantly brought in contact with bottom of the 
dish and throughout the mixture. 

To cut and fold, introduce one ingredient into an- 
other ingredient or mixture by two motions: with a 
spoon, a repeated vertical downward motion, known 
as cutting, and a turning over and over of mixture, 
allowing bowl of spoon each time to come in contact 
with bottom of dish, is called folding. These re- 
peated motions are alternated until thorough blend- 
ing is accomplished. 

By stirring, ingredients are mixed; hy heating, 
a large amount of air is inclosed; hy cutting and 
Jolding, air already introduced is prevented from 
escaping.

Anniversary Cake 

Bake Grandma's Pound Cake mixture in a buttered 
and floured round pan about seven inches in diameter. 
Remove from pan, cover with Confectioners' Frost- 
ing and decorate as shown in illustration or as one's 
fancy dictates. 

Foliage is best made of citron thinly sliced. The 
dark-green outside makes attractive leaves, though 
all may be used to advantage. The little candies for 
the flowers may sometimes be procured at small 
shops, though the greatest variety can be bought of 
a dealer in confectioners' supplies; also the little 
silver-like dragees, which are so ornamental. The 
flowers are made on a basis of angelica, cut with a 
pen-knife into thin shavings, worked with the hands 
into small balls, then flattened into lozenge shapes, 
which make a sticky foundation on which the candies 
may be placed; candied rose leaves and violets 
may also be used. The cake in the illustration is 
decorated with daisies and chrysanthemums, golden- 
rod and forget-me-nots. 

The little disks were made of angelica, shaped in 
half-spheres, dipped in white of egg, and then in the 
dragees, and the conventional decorations were cut 
from thin slices of citron.

Bake Sponge, Angel or Moonshine cake mixture

heavy brown paper (buttered side up) and fasten 
securely with a string. Steam and bake. Take 
from pan, remove paper, and let stand until cold. 
Wrap in cheese-cloth, wrung out of brandy, and 
store in a cool dry place from one to three months, 
occasionally sprinkling with brandy. Work one- 
third pound almond paste with white of one egg 
until smooth and add one-fourth cup fine granulated 
sugar. Spread bottom and sides of cake with mix- 
ture, put in oven and bake until paste is browned. 
This prevents frosting from becoming discolored. 
Cool and spread with a layer of Ornamental Frost- 
ing (see p. 353) and let stand until frosting is set. 

Ornament by forcing frosting through a pastry 
bag and tubes or cones made of paper which comes 
for this purpose and dragees. The doves shown in 
illustration are shaped on paper, dried and then 
placed on cake, being held in place by a small quan- 
tity of soft frosting.

Next time you bake or fry 
Try COTTOLENE 



Wherever you now use butter or lard in short- 
ening or frying, just try COTTOLENE, the 
original — and best — vegetable-oil cooking fat; 
you'll be delighted with the results. 

COTTOLENE makes cakes even lighter, and 
finer in texture, than when butter is used — and 
not one in a thousand can taste the slightest differ- 
ence. In piecrust, doughnuts, and for all frying, 
COTTOLENE gives better results than lard, and 
is very much more wholesome. 

COTTOLENE costs only about half as much as 
butter and there is a still further saving in the fact 
that one-third less COTTOLENE is required ; a 
pound of COTTOLENE will go as far as a pound 
and a half of either 
butter or lard. 

Try COTTO- 
LENE in one of 
your favorite re- 
cipes; one test will 
convince that COT- 
TOLENE is "equal 
to butter, better 
than lard, more 
economical than 
either."

DR. WILEY'S TRIBUTE 
TO BREAD 



"Measured by actual nutritive power 
there is no other complete ration which 
in economy can compare with bread." 



Of course Dr. Wiley meant good 
bread. 

The secret of good bread is proper 
fermentation. A clean, pure, strong 
and uniform leaven brings out in the 
bread the nutritive properties of the 
wheat. It makes the bread more 
palatable, digestible and wholesome. 

Such a leaven is FLEISCHMANN'S 
YEAST. Used by the best bread 
makers of the country with perfect 
success for nearly half a century.

*PURE* 

EXTfiftCrS 






SQUIRE'S 

KETTLE RENDERED 

PURE LEAF LARD 

A GENERATION ago there was only 
one kind of lard, — made from fat 
taken from any part of the hog. 
Today there is in use Leaf Lard, made 
from the raw leaf only; Lard made from 
fat taken from other parts of the pig, and many substitutes for 
Lard, made from cotton-seed oil, beef drippings, oils and any 
other substance which has some shortening power. 

The leaves are Nature's way of storing up food in the years 
of plenty for the year of famine. The bear lives all winter with- 
out eating, but food is required to sustain life. He goes into 
winter quarters fat; he comes out lean. Nature is particular. 
She stores up only the best, — that which has the greatest sus- 
taining power for the least volume. The leaf is Nature's food, 
— the finest, sweetest of fats. The chemical composition and 
physical structure of leaf are similar to that of pure, rich cream. 
It looks and tastes different from other fat. It has a flaky ap- 
pearance and a sweet, nutty flavor. Only about four and one- 
naif per cent of a healthy, well-fed animal is leaf. 

Squire's Pure Leaf Lard is made exclusively from the leaves 
of healthy porkers. Mr. Squire was the first manufacturer to 
make a Lard a little better than any other and yet he invented 
no new process. He made it, and it is made today, just as 
Leaf Lard was made in the New England kitchen years before. 
He melted the pure, raw leaf in an open kettle over a fire, 
strained it through cloth, and ran it into pails to cool. New 
England families were quick to appreciate the difference. 
They noticed a flaky appearance, the absence of any pig odor 
and a sweet, nutty flavor. 



THOUSANDS of dollars have been spent in New England in the last few 
years advertising substitutes for Lard; yet such substitutes have never 
interfered with the increasing demand for Squire's Pure Leaf Lard. 
"You can fool all the people some of the time and some of the people all the 
time, but you can't fool all the people all the time." John P. Squire did not 
believe in fooling any of the people any of the time. There is no food sub- 
stance manufactured which has greater shortening power than Squire's Kettle 
Rendered Pure Leaf Lard. It is Nature's food, —better than mother used to 
make. Remember the distinction between Leaf Lard and Pure Lard. Look 
for the word "Leaf" in the label and ask for Squire's and the best is yours.

Are the Best Because 

The Hub Improved Flue heats 5 sides of the oven. 

(Other ranges heat only 4 sides.) 

The Hub Flue makes 
only 4 turns to reach

flues make 6 turns.) 

THEREFORE: 33^% lesS

No water bugs or roaches — they will 
not cross a surface washed with Sulpho- 
Napthol.

Coffees and Teas 

True to Name 

There is a wide variation in the price of coflfee and tea 
because there is a wide difference in th^e fla'vor. 

Genuine Java coffee, field ripened and cured by the 
Old Dutch Government process, has a mellow richness 
of flavor unequalled by any other coffee. We import 
the best Java Coffee produced in the Dutch East Indies. 

Genuine Mocha of high quality is rarely brought to 
the United States. Our own agent in Arabia sends us 
the finest produced. 

There are four flavors in tea: "Oolong" from Formosa, 
"English Breakfast" from China, "Green" from Japan, 
and "Orange Pekoe" from India and Ceylon. From 
each country comes a little tea that is delicate and fine in 
flavor. We import from all these countries teas nvorth 
from 30 cents to 60 cents a pound, and a few teas 
ivorth from $1.00 to $2.00. 

After January, 191 3, we can mail anywhere any 
quantity of coffee or tea at very reasonable prices. You 
can have coffee and tea fresh, uniform, and of genuine 
fine flavor if you want it. Write us for prices.

^'Almost as Necessary as 
the Cook/' 

Speaking of Ivory Soap, a Cincinnati woman recent- 
ly made the statement that it is "almost as necessary 
as the cook." 

It is. You can keep house without a cook, but not 
without soap. You must have it; and the purer it is, 
the better. 

Ivory Soap is pure — purer than soaps that sell for 
five times its price; very much purer than einy soap 
that sells at or anywhere near its price. 

And because of its purity. Ivory Soap is available 
for scores of purposes for which ordinary soaps are un. 
safe and unsatisfactory. 

More and more, American housekeepers appreciate 
that fact. More andmore, they realize that Ivory Soap 
is a product on which they can rely. It is pure. And 
purity, in soap, is as necessary as it is in food.

" The art of cookery, when not allied with a degenerate 
taste or nrith gluttony, is one of the criteria of a people's 
civilisation." 

" We grow like what we eat ; 
Bad food depresses, good food exalts us like an 
inspiration." 



PREFACE 

WITH the advancement of the art of cookery, 
it has become impossible to compress within 
the limits of a single volume the wealth of material 
which is at hand. It is now seventeen years since 
The Boston Cooking-School Cook Book was first 
published. Since that time it has been frequently 
revised and a large number of new recipes added, 
first in the form of an appendix and addenda, later 
incorporated in logical order throughout the volume. 
But the results of the labors and experiments of 
ihe last seven years have, I believe, justified the 
publication of an entirely new work. It will be 
understood that this new work is in no sense a sub- 
stitute for my earlier one, but rather a sequel. 
It is, let me repeat, a coniprehensive survey of the 
progress of the last few years and contains recipes 
economical and simple as Well as expensive and elab- 
orate, covering the whole range of cookery. 

My earnest hope is that the book will fulfil a 
real and vital need. I cannot send it forth without 
an expression of sincere appreciation for the kindly 
aid of enthusiastic pupils and devoted teachers.

A New Book of Cookery 

CHAPTER I 
HOW TO MEASURE AND COMBINE INGREDIENTS 

nnHERE is nothing which has done so much to 
-*■ place cookery on an improved basis as the almost 
universal introduction of accurate methods in 
measuring. A generation or two ago each household 
had its favorite cups and spoons of varying sizes 
which helped as guides in measuring. It was in these 
days that one often heard the statement, " Cooks are 
born, not made." Good judgment coupled with 
experience taught some to measure by sight, whidi 
was a step towards good results, but the vast ma- 
jority needed definite guides. Thus arose the neces- 
sity of uniform measuring cups and spoons which 
are an essential in every kitchen. 

Measuring cups (holding one-half pint), divided 
into quarters or thirds, are made of tin, graniteware, 
or glass and may be bought of any dealer in kitchen 
furnishings or at large department stores. Measur- 
ing spoons come in two sizes, the smaller of which is 
called a teaspoon, the larger a tablespoon. Mixing 
spoons, which are somewhat larger than tablespoons, 
should not be confounded with them. A case knife, 
which is used for levelling as well as dividing ingre- 



2 A NEW BOOK OF COOKERY 

dients, is also necessary to make measuring as 
accurate as is possible. 

All ingredients are measured level, f 

A cupful is measured level. ^ 

A tablespoonful is measured level. 

A teaspoonful is measured level. 

TO MEASURE DRY INGREDIENTS 

I. By cwpfuls. 

Put in the ingredient to be measured by spoon- 
fuls or from a scoop, round slightly and level with a 
case knife for a cupful. For fractions of cupfuls 
fill in like manner to correct division line indicated 
in cup. Never shake the cup while filling. 

II. By teaapoonfuls or tablespoonfuls. 

Dip spoon in ingredient, fill, lift, and level with a 
case knife having the sharp edge of knife towards 
tip of spoon. Divide with a case knife lengthwise 
of spoon for a half spoonful. Divide halves cross- 
wise for quarters, and quarters crosswise for eighths. 
Less than one-eighth teaspoonful is called a few 
grains. 

TO MEASURE BUTTER, LARD, AND OTHER 
SOLID FATS 

I. By cupfuls. 

Pack solidly into cup and level with a case knife for 
a cupful. For fractions of cupfuls pack in like man- 
ner to correct division line indicated in cup.

II. By teaspoonfuls or tablespoonfub. 

Pack solidly into spoon and level with a case knife. 
Divide with a case knife lengthwise of spoon for a 
half spoonful. Divide halves crosswise for quarters, 
and quarters crosswise for eighths. 

TO MEASURE LIQUIDS 

I. By cwpfids. 

Pour liquid to be measiu-ed into cup and fill to very 
top for cupfuls. A cupful of liquid is all that the cup 
will hold and cannot be easily moved from one place 
to another without overflowing. For fractions 
of cupfuls fill in like manner to correct division line 
indicated in cup. 

II. By teaspoonfuls or tablespoonfuls. 

Dip spoon in liquid, fill and lift, taking up all the 
spoon will hold. When dry ingredients, liquids, 
and fats are all called for in the same recipe, measure 
in the order given, thereby using but one cup. 

HOW TO COMBINE INGREDIENTS 

Next to measuring comes care in combining, — 
a fact not always recognized by the inexperienced. 
Three ways are considered, — stirring, beating, 
and cutting and folding. 

To stir, mix by using circular motion, widening 
the circles until all is blended; Stirring is the motion 
ordinarily employed in all cookery, alone or in com- 
bination with beating. 



4 A NEW BOOK OF COOKERY 

To heat, turn ingredient or ingredients over and 
over, continually bringing the under part to the sur- 
face, thus allowing the utensil used for beating to be 
constantly brought in contact with bottom of the 
dish and throughout the mixture. 

To cut and fold, introduce one ingredient into an- 
other ingredient or mixture by two motions: with a 
spoon, a repeated vertical downward motion, known 
as cutting, and a turning over and over of mixture, 
allowing bowl of spoon each time to come in contact 
with bottom of dish, is called folding. These re- 
peated motions are alternated until thorough blend- 
ing is accomplished. 

By stirring, ingredients are mixed; by beating, 
a large amount of air is inclosed; by cutting and 
folding, air already introduced is prevented from 
escaping. 



CHAPTER II 

BEVERAGES 

Hawaiian Five o'clock Tea 

A LLXDW to each cup of five o'clock tea three cubes 
-^^' prepared pineapple cubes and sugar to taste. 
For pineapple cubes, put one-half cup syrup drained 
from canned pineapple in small saucepan, add two 
tablespoons sugar and one-half cup canned sliced 
pineapple, cut in half-inch cubes. Bring to the 
boiling point, and let simmer until syrup has been 
almost absorbed by fruit. 

Lemon Cut Sugar 

Rub entire surface of blocks of domino sugar over 
the rind of a lemon which has been washed and 
wiped until dry. Store in a glass jar, and use to 
sweeten and flavor five o'clock tea. 

Orange Cut Sugar 

Rub entire surface of blocks of domino sugar over 
the rind of an orange which has been washed and

Anniversary Cake 

Bake Grandmother's Pound Cake mixture in a 
buttered and floured round pan about seven inches 
in diameter. Remove from pan, cover with Con- 
fectioners' Frosting and decorate as shown in illus- 
tration or as one's fancy dictates. 

Foliage is best made of citron thinly sliced. The 
dark-green outside makes attractive leaves, though 
all may be used to advantage. The little candies for 
the flowers may sometimes be procured at small 
shops, though the greatest variety can be bought of 
a dealer in confectioners' supplies; also the little 
silver-like drag^es, which are so ornamental. The 
flowers are made on a basis of angelica, cut with a 
pen-knife into thin shavings, worked with the hands 
into small balls, then flattened into lozenge shapes, 
which make a sticky foundation on which the candies 
may be placed; candied rose leaves and violets 
may also be used. The cake in the illustration is 
decorated with daisies and chrysanthemums, golden- 
rod and forget-me-nots. 

The little disks were made of angelica, shaped in 
half-spheres, dipped in white of egg, and then in the 
dragees, and the conventional decorations were cut 
from thin slices of citron.

The art of cookery, when nol allied wiih a degenerate 
taste or wUk gluttony, is one of the criteria of a people's 
dviUsation'' 



t€ 



We grow hke what we eat ; 

Bad food depresses, good food exalts us like an 
inspiration" 



PREFACE 

T ^ TTTH the advancement of the art of cookery, 
▼ ▼ it has become impossible to compress within 
the limits of a single volmne the wealth of material 
which is at hand. It is now seventeen years since 
The Boston Cooking-School Cook Book was first 
published* Since that time it has been frequently 
revised and a large number of new recipes added, 
first in the form of an appendix and addenda, later 
incorporated in logical order throughout the volume. 
But the results of the labors and experiments of 
the last seven years have, I believe, justified the 
publication of an entirely new work. It will be 
understood that this new work is in no sense a sub- 
stitute for my earlier one, but rather a sequel. 
It is, let me repeat, a oomprehensive survey of the 
progress of the last few years and contains redpes 
economical and simple as well as expensive and elab- 
orate, covering the whole range of cookery. 

My earnest hope is that the book will fulfil a 
real and vital need. I cannot send it forth without 
an expression of sincere appreciation for the kindly 
aid of enthusiastic pupils and devoted teachers.

A New Book of Cookery 

CHAPTER I 
HOW TO MEASURE AND CX)MBINE INGREDIENTS 

THERE is nothing which has done so much to 
place cookery on an improved basis as the ahnost 
wiiversal introduction of accurate methods in 
measuring. A generation or two ago each household 
had its favorite cups and spoons of varying sizes 
which helped as guides in measuring. It was in these 
days that one often heard the statement, " Cooks are 
bom, not made." Good judgment coupled with 
experience taught some to measure by sight, which 
was a step towards good results, but the vast ma- 
jority needed definite guides. Thus arose the neces- 
^ty of uniform measiuing cups and spoons which 
are an essential in every kitchen. 

Measuring cups (holding one-half pint), divided 
into quarters or thirds, are made of tin, graniteware, 
or glass and may be bought of any dealer in kitchen 
furnishings or at large department stores. Measur- 
ing spoons come in two sizes, the smaller of which is 
called a teaspoon, the larger a tablespoon. Mixing 
spoons, which are somewhat larger than tablespoons, 
should not be confounded with them. A case knife, 
which is used for levelling as weU as dividing ingre- 



2 A NEW BOOK OF COOKERY 

dients, is also necessary to make measuring as 
accurate as is possible. 

All ingredients are measured level. 

A cupful is measured level. 

A tablespoonf ul is measured level. 

A teaspoonf ul is measured level. 

TO MEASURE DRY INGREDIENTS 

I. By cujjfuls. 

Put in the ingredient to be measured by spoon- 
fuls or from a scoop, round slightly and level with a 
case knife for a cupful. For fractions of cupfuls 
fill in like manner to correct division line indicated 
in cup. Never shake the cup while filling. 

II. By teaspoonfuU or tablespoonfuls. 

Dip spoon in ingredient, fill, lift, and level with a 
case knife having the sharp edge of knife towards 
tip of spoon. Divide with a case knife lengthwise 
of spoon for a half spoonful. Divide halves cross- 
wise for quarters, and quarters crosswise for eighths. 
Less than one-eighth teaspoonful is called a few 
gruns. 

TO MEASURE BUTTER, LARD, AND OTHER 

SOLID PATS 

L By cupfuls. 

Pack solidly into cup and level with a case knife for 
a cupful. For fractions of cupfuls pack in like man- 
ner to correct division line indicated in cup.. 



Five O'Clock Tea Trav. 



■■ FiVR O'CLOCK Cup of Tea. 



HOW TO MEASURE INGREDIENTS 3 

II. By teaspoonfida or tablespoonfuh. 

Pack solidly into spoon and level with a case knife. 
Divide with a case knife lengthwise of spoon for a 
half spoonful. Divide halves crosswise for quarters, 
and quarters crosswise for dghths. 

TO MEASURE UQUIDS 

L By cwpfvls. 

Pour liquid to be measured into cup and fill to very 
top for cupfuls. A cupful of liquid is all that the cup 
will hold and cannot be easily moved from one place 
to another without overflowing. For fractions 
of cupfuls fill in like manner to correct division line 
indicated in cup. 

II. By teaspoonfida or tableapoonfids. 

Dip spoon in liquid, fill and lift, taking up all the 
spoon will hold. When dry ingredients, liquids, 
and fats are all called for in the same recipe, measure 
in the order given, thereby using but one cup. 

HOW TO COMBINE INGREDIENTS 

Next to measuring comes care in combining, — 
a fact not always recognized by the inexperienced. 
Three ways are considered, — stirring, beating, 
and cutting and folding. 

To atir, mix by using arcular motion, widening 
the circles until all is blended. Stirring is the motion 
ordinarily employed in all cookery, alone or in com- 
bination with beating. 



4 A NEW BOOK OF COOKERY 

To heal, turn ingredient or ingredients over and 
over, continually bringing the under part to the sur- 
face, thus allowing the utensil used for beating to be 
constantly brought in contact with bottom of the 
dish and throughout the mixture. 

To ctd and fold, introduce one ingredient into an- 
other ingredient or mixture by two motions: with a 
spoon, a repeated vertical downward motion, known 
as cutting, and a turning over and over of mixture, 
allowing bowl of spoon each time to come in contact 
with bottom of dish, is called folding. These re- 
peated motions are alternated until thorough blend- 
ing is accomplished. 

By stirring, ingredients are mixed; by beating, 
a large amount of air is inclosed; by cutting and 
folding, air already introduced is prevented from 
escaping.

in diameter. Remove from pan, cover with Con- 
fectioners' Frosting and decorate as shown in illus- 
tration or as one's fanqr dictates. 

Foliage is best made of citron thinly sliced. The 
dark-green outside makes attractive leaves, though 
all may be used to advantage. The little candies for 
the flowers may sometimes be procured at small 
shops, though the greatest variety can be bought of 
a dealer in confectioners' supplies; also the little 
silver-like drag^, which are so ornamental. The 
flowers are made on a basis of angelica, cut with a 
pen-knife into thin shavings, worked with the hands 
into small balls, then flattened into lozenge shapes, 
which make a sticky foundation on which the candies 
may be placed; candied rose leaves and violets 
may also be used. The cake in the illustration is 
decorated with daisies and chrysanthemums, golden- 
rod and forget-me-nots. 

The little disks were made of angelica, shaped in 
half-spheres, dipped in white of egg, and then in the 
drag6es, and the conventional decorations were cut 
from thin slices of citron.

MAGIC COVERS 

for 

ROLLING PIN G? BREAD BOARD 



Magic 
Covers are a 
great saving of time, 
strength, and material, and 
are neat, durable, and effectual. 
By their use, the softest dough can be 
handled without the slightest possibility of 
sticking to moulding board or rolling pin. One set 
will last for years and they will save many times their cost 
in material alone. They are highly recommended by 
the leading schools of Domestic Science. Miss 
Farmer says: «I consider Magic Covers a 
necessity in every up-to-date kitchen. 
They are used in all my class 
rooms and are recom- 
mended in special, class 
and demonstra- 
tion work.**
