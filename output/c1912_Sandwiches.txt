SANDWICHES 

Sandwiches may be made from one of 
three or four kinds of bread; whole wheat 
bread, Boston brown or oatmeal bread, white 
bread and rye bread made into square, deep 
loaves ; in fact, all bread used for sandwiches 
should be made especially for the purpose, 
so that the slices may be in good form, and 
sufficiently large to cut into fancy shapes. 

The butter may be used plain, slightly 
softened or it may be seasoned and flavored 
with just a suspicion of paprika, a little white 
pepper, and a few drops of Worcestershire 
sauce. 

For ordinary sandwiches use the bread 
without toasting. For canapes, toast is to 
be preferred. Sandwiches are principally 
used for buffet lunches or evening sociables, 
where only a light, substantial lunch is re- 
quired. In these days they are made in 
great varieties. Almost all sorts of meat, if 
properly seasoned, may be made into deli- 
cious sandwiches. If the meat is slightly 



8 MRS. RORER'S SANDWICHES 

moistened with cream or olive oil, sand- 
wiches for traveling, provided each one is 
carefully wrapped in oiled paper, will keep 
fresh three or four days. The small French 
rolls may have the centres scooped out, the 
spaces filled with chicken salad or chopped 
oysters, and served as sandwiches. The 
rolls may be made especially for that pur- 
pose, not more than two inches long and one 
and a half inches wide; with coffee, they 
make an attractive meal easily served. 

Ordinary sandwiches may be made either 
square, triangular, long, narrow, round or 
crescent shaped. One slice of bread will 
usually make one round sandwich and one 
crescent, provided the cutting is done eco- 
nomically. Meat used for sandwiches should 
be chopped very fine and slightly moistened 
with cream, melted butter, olive oil or may- 
onnaise dressing well seasoned. Fish should 
be rubbed or pounded in a mortar; add 
enough sauce tartare to make it sufficiently 
moist to easily spread. 

Turkey, chicken, game, tongue, beef and 
mutton, with their proper seasonings, moist- 
ened with either mayonnaise or French 
dressing, make exceedingly nice sandwiches. 



MRS. RORER'S SANDWICHES 9 

To Keep Sandwiches 

It is frequently necessary to make sand- 
wiches several hours before they are needed. 
As they dry quickly they must be carefully 
wrapped or they will be unpalatable. Wring 
from cold water two ordinary tea towels; 
put one on top of the other. An old table- 
cloth will answer the purpose very well. As 
fast as the sandwiches are made put them 
on top of the damp towel ; when you have the 
desired quantity, cover the top with moist 
lettuce leaves ; fold over the towels, and put 
outside of this a perfectly dry, square cloth. 
Sandwiches will keep in this way for several 
hours, and in perfectly good condition. On 
a very warm day they may be covered all 
over with moist lettuce leaves ; use the green 
ones that are not so palatable or sightly for 
garnishing. 

Bread 

To make good sandwiches, especially 
when one is a long way from a city, it is 
quite necessary to know how to make sand- 
wich bread, which is quite different, or 
should be, from ordinary bread. Compressed 



io MRS. RORER'S SANDWICHES 



yeast is always to be preferred, but if one 
cannot get it, the next best is good home- 
made yeast. Bread for sandwiches must be 
baked in rather large square pans, and must 
be just a little lighter and softer than bread 
for the table. The following recipes will, I 
am sure, help the "out of town" housewife. 
Nut bread is usually made into simple bread 
and butter sandwiches ; the nuts in the bread 
are quite sufficient filling. 

Yeast 

4 good sized potatoes 

1 quart of boiling water 

2 tablespoonfuls of sugar 
i tablespoonful of salt 

Pare and grate the potatoes into the hot 
water, stir over the fire until it reaches boil- 
ing point, and simmer gently for five min- 
utes. Take from the fire, add the sugar and 
salt, and when lukewarm add a cupful of 
yeast, or two dry yeast cakes that have been 
moistened in a little water, or one cake of 
compressed yeast. Turn the mixture into a 
jar and cover with a saucer. Stir it down 
as fast as it comes to the top of the jar. 
When it falls, or ceases to be very light, 



MRS. RORER'S SANDWICHES n 

which will be five or six hours, pour it into a 
bottle, put the cork in very loosely and stand 
it in a cold place. Use one cupful of this to 
each two loaves of bread. 

German Potato Bread 

Boil one potato until tender; mash it 
through a sieve, add to it a half pint of warm 
water and a teaspoonful of sugar. Stir in 
one cupful of flour and one cupful of yeast ; 
let this stand for two hours, or until very 
light. It is better to make this at seven 
o'clock, so the bread may be sponged at nine 
or ten. Scald a pint of milk, add to it a pint 
of water, beat in a quart and a pint of flour. 
The batter should be thick enough to drop, 
rather than pour from the spoon. Then stir 
in the potato starter, and stand in a place 
about 65 Fahr. over night. Next morning 
knead thoroughly, adding flour. Put this 
aside until very light, about two hours , then 
mold into loaves, put it into square greased 
pans, and when light bake in a moderately 
quick oven three-quarters of an hour. 

This recipe will make two box loaves and 
a dozen rolls. 



12 MRS. RORER'S SANDWICHES 

Nineteenth Century Bread 

Scald a pint of milk, add a pint of water, 
a teaspoonful of salt, and when lukewarm, 
one compressed yeast cake moistened in a 
little warm water. Add sufficient whole 
wheat flour to make a batter, beat thor- 
oughly, cover and stand aside two and a half 
hours; then stir, adding more whole wheat 
flour until you have a dough. Knead quickly, 
separate into loaves, put each in a square 
greased pan, cover and stand in a warm place 
about one hour, until very light. Slash the 
top with a sharp knife, brush with water and 
bake in a moderate oven three-quarters of an 
hour. 

White Bread 

Add a pint of water to a pint of scalded 
milk; when lukewarm add one compressed 
yeast cake, moistened, and a teaspoonful of 
salt. Add sufficient flour gradually, beating 
all the while, to make a dough. Knead this 
dough until it is soft and elastic, and free 
from stickiness. Put it into a greased bowl, 
stand it in a warm place three hours. Sepa- 
rate it into loaves, knead five minutes, put 



MRS. RORERS SANDWICHES 13 

the loaves in square greased pans and stand 
aside until very light. Slash the top with a 
sharp knife, brush with water, and bake in a 
moderate oven three-quarters of an hour. 
This should make two loaves, or a dozen 
bread sticks and a dozen rolls. 

Nut Bread 

I quart of flour 

4 level teaspoonfuls of baking powder 
i teaspoonful of salt 
i cupful of chopped nuts 
i^ cupfuls of milk 

Add the baking powder and salt to the 
flour and sift them. Add the nuts, mix thor- 
oughly and gradually add the milk. Knead 
this into a loaf, put it into a square pan, 
brush the top with melted butter, let it stand 
twenty minutes, and bake in a moderate oven 
three-quarters of an hour. 

Anchovy Sandwiches 

Beat a quarter of a pound of butter to a 
cream, adding gradually two tablespoonfuls 
of lemon juice, a saltspoonful of paprika, two 



14 MRS. RORER S SANDWICHES 

tablespoonf uls of anchovy paste. Spread this 
on thin slices of bread, put two together, 
trim off the crusts, and cut into triangles. 

Anchovy and Egg Sandwiches 

Mash the yolks of four hard-boiled eggs 
with two tablespoonfuls of melted butter or 
olive oil, add a half teaspoonful of salt, a 
Hash of paprika and a tablespoonful of an- 
chovy paste or two mashed anchovies. 
Spread this between thin slices of buttered 
bread, press the slices together, trim off the 
crusts and cut into triangles. 

Sardines may be used in the place of an- 
chovies, 

Cold Beef Sandwiches 

Take the remains of cold roasted beef, 
and chop very fine ; put it into a bowl ; to each 
half pint of meat, add a half teaspoonful of 
salt, a tablespoonful of tomato catsup, a tea- 
spoonful of Worcestershire sauce and a tea- 
spoonful of melted butter; work this to- 
gether. Cut the crust from the ends of a 
loaf of whole wheat bread; butter lightly 



MRS. RORER'S SANDWICHES 15 

and slice ; so continue until you have the de- 
sired number of slices ; spread the slices with 
a layer of the seasoned meat; put two slices 
together, and cut into desired shapes. 

Caviar Sandwiches No. I 

Beat a quarter of a pound of butter to a 
cream ; add two tablespoonfuls of onion juice, 
the same of lemon, a saltspoonful of paprika, 
and gradually four tablespoonfuls of caviar. 
Spread this on thin slices of brown bread or 
pumpernickel, put two together, press lightly 
and cut into long, narrow shapes. 

Caviar Sandwiches No. 2 

Cut slices of bread in crescent-shaped 
pieces, butter one side and toast. Have 
ready two hard-boiled eggs, remove yolks, 
put them through sieve, chop whites very 
fine, and spread toast with layer of caviar; 
then sprinkle over first a little of whites, then 
a little of the yolks of the eggs. Put over in 
the form of a ring a piece of onion, the onion 
having first been cut into thin slices, and 
then separated. 



16 MRS. RORER'S SANDWICHES 

Celery Sandwiches 

Cut slices of bread, butter one side and 
toast. Cut the white part of celery into thin 
slices, cover it over the bread, then cover this 
with a layer of mayonnaise dressing, cover 
with another piece of toast, cut into squares 
and serve. All sandwiches of this kind must 
be used as soon as made. 

Celery Salad Sandwiches 

Put four eggs into warm water ; bring to 
the boiling point, and keep there, without 
boiling, for fifteen minutes. Take the white 
portion from one head of celery; wash and 
chop it very fine. Remove the shells from 
the hard-boiled eggs, and either chop them 
very fine or put through a vegetable press, 
and mix with them the celery ; add a half tea- 
spoonful of salt and a dash of pepper. But- 
ter the bread before you cut it from the loaf. 
After you have a sufficient quantity cut, put 
over each slice a layer of the mixed egg and 
celery; put right in the center of this a tea- 
spoonful of mayonnaise dressing, and sort of 
smooth it all over. Put two pieces together 



MRS. RORER'S SANDWICHES 17 

and press them lightly. Trim off the crusts, 
and cut the sandwiches into pieces about two 
inches wide and the length of the slices. 



Rolled Bread and Butter Sandwiches 

Beat the butter to a cream. Remove the 
crusts from the loaf, butter each slice before 
you cut it off, and roll at once. These may 
be tied with narrow baby ribbon or wrapped 
at once in waxed paper, fringing and twist- 
ing the ends. 

Rolled Chicken Sandwiches 

Trim the crusts from the entire loaf, but- 
ter each slice and cut it off as thin as possi- 
ble; spread it quickly with the mixture, roll 
and wrap it at once in waxed paper. If the 
bread is home-made and cracks in the roll- 
ing, put a colander over a kettle of boiling 
water, throw in it a few slices at a time, as 
soon as they have softened spread them with 
soft butter, then cover with the mixture, roll 
and wrap in waxed paper. 

To make the mixture, chop sufficient cold 
boiled chicken to make a pint. Rub together 



1 8 MRS. RORER'S SANDWICHES 

two level tablespoonfuls of butter and two 
of flour, add slowly a half cupful of hot milk, 
stir over the fire for a minute, then add the 
chicken, a level teaspoonful of salt, a half 
teaspoonful of celery seed, a saltspoonful of 
white pepper, a dash of red pepper, a tea- 
spoonful of onion juice and a grating of nut- 
meg; mix and cool. This will make four 
dozen rolled sandwiches. 

Sandwiches a la Rorer 

Chop sufficient white meat of cooked 
chicken to make a half pint. Select two fine 
bunches of cress, and with a sharp knife 
shave it very fine. Wash and dry the crisp 
portion from a head of lettuce. Put the 
yolks of two eggs into a saucepan, add the 
juice from two lemons and stir over hot 
water until the mixture is thick; take from 
the fire and add slowly two tablespoonfuls of 
olive oil; add this to the chicken and season 
with a half teaspoonful of salt and a dash of 
pepper. Butter a slice of white bread, put 
over a rather thick layer of the chicken mix- 
ture, then a slice of brown bread, buttered 
on both sides; cover this with a thick laver 



MRS. RORER S SANDWICHES IQ 

of cress, dust it lightly with salt and pepper, 
then another slice of white bread, buttered; 
press these firmly together, trim the crusts 
and cut into fingers. 

Chicken and Almond Sandwiches 

Chop sufficient cold cooked chicken to 
make a half pint. Chop a quarter of a 
pound of blanched almonds, add them to the 
chicken, add four tablespoonfuls of cream, a 
half teaspoonful of salt and a dash of pep- 
per ; mix thoroughly, put between thin slices 
of buttered bread and cut into crescents or 
rounds. 

Chicken and Lettuce a la Kendall 

Put sufficient cold boiled chicken through 
the meat chopper to make a half pint, pound 
it in a mortar or rub it in a bowl with the 
hard-boiled yolks of four eggs, four table- 
spoonfuls of thick cream, a half teaspoonful 
of salt, a dash of pepper, and if you have it, 
two saltspoonf uls of celery seed ; in the win- 
ter you may add a half cupful of finely chop- 
ped celery. Butter thin slices of white bread, 



2O MRS. RORER'S SANDWICHES 

cover them with this mixture, place on top 
a slice of brown bread buttered on both sides, 
then a thick layer of shredded celery, with a 
tablespoonful of mayonnaise in the middle, 
then another slice of buttered white bread; 
press together, trim the crusts and cut into 
fingers. 

Princess Sandwiches 

Chop sufficient cold chicken to make a 
half pint, add the juice of half a lemon, two 
tablespoonfuls of melted butter or olive oil, 
twelve walnuts chopped very fine, a half tea- 
spoonful of paprika and a half teaspoonful 
of salt. Put this mixture between thin slices 
of buttered bread, trim the crusts and cut 
into fingers. 

Windsor Sandwiches 

Chop sufficient cold boiled chicken to 
make a half pint, add a half cupful of finely 
chopped celery, a half teaspoonful of salt, a 
dash of pepper and four tablespoonfuls of 
cream ; mix. Chop sufficient cold boiled ham 
or tongue to make a half pint, add a table- 
spoonful of tomato catsup, a few drops of 



MRS. RORERS SANDWICHES 21 

Worcestershire sauce and a dash of pepper. 
Trim the crusts from an entire loaf of bread, 
butter the end of the loaf and cut off a thin 
slice, and so continue until you have the de- 
sired quantity of bread. 

Shred one head of Romaine or a bunch 
of cress. This of course must be crisp and 
dry. Put a layer of the chicken mixture on 
the buttered side of a slice of bread, put on 
top another slice of buttered bread, then a 
thick layer of the shredded cress or Romaine. 
Put a thick layer of the tongue mixture on 
another slice of bread and cover it over the 
cress. Press firmly together and cut the 
slices directly into halves the long way. 
Wrap in waxed paper or tie with baby rib- 
bon. Served at afternoon teas. If well 
made, they are the most elaborate and dainty 
of all sandwiches. 

Tea Biscuit Sandwiches 

Put one quart of flour into a bowl; add 
four level teaspoonfuls of baking powder, a 
teaspoonful of salt, and sift. Rub in two 
level tablespoonfuls of butter and add suffi- 
cient milk to make a dough. This dough 



22 MRS. RORER'S SANDWICHES 



must not be soft, but must be sufficiently stiff 
to handle quickly. Knead quickly and roll 
into a sheet a quarter of an inch thick. Cut 
into good-sized round biscuits ; they must be 
at least two and a half to three inches in 
diameter. Brush them with milk and bake 
in a quick oven. When done, cut the center 
from each biscuit, leaving a wall one inch 
thick; take out the crumb. Fill this space 
with deviled chicken. Chop sufficient cold 
cooked chicken to make a pint ; add gradually 
eight tablespoonfuls of melted butter, cream 
or olive oil, a dash of cayenne, a saltspoonf til 
of white pepper, a saltspoonful of celery seed 
and a saltspoonful of paprika. When thor- 
oughly mixed fill the spaces just even and 
send at once to the table. These are nice 
for porch suppers, and may be served with 
either tea, coffee or chocolate, or may be 
used as an accompaniment to mayonnaise of 
tomatoes. 



MRS. RORER'S SANDWICHES 23 

Cheese Sandwiches No. I 

Butter thin slices of pumpernickel or 
brown bread; put between each two slices a 
very thin layer of Swiss cheese, put two to- 
gether, and cut into triangles; garnish with 
cress. 

Cheese Sandwiches No. 2 

Chop fine a quarter of a pound of soft 
American cheese ; put it into a saucepan, add 
the yolk of one egg beaten with two table- 
spoonfuls of cream, a saltspoonful of salt, a 
dash of red pepper and half a teaspoonful of 
Worcestershire sauce. Have ready cut and 
buttered a sufficient number of slices of 
bread, either white or whole wheat. Stir the 
cheese over the fire until it is thoroughly 
melted; take from the fire and when cool 
spread it between the slices of bread and but- 
ter; that is, spread it on one slice and cover 
with the other; press two together and cut 
into forms. 



24 MRS. RORER'S SANDWICHES 

Cheese Sandwiches No. 3 

Rub or pound until perfectly smooth or 
well mixed one tablespoonful of butter, two 
tablespoonfuls of soft club-house cheese, a 
tablespoonful of grated Parmesan, a salt- 
spoonful of salt, and a teaspoonful of an- 
chovy paste; add a teaspoonful of tarragon 
vinegar and a half saltspoonful of pepper. 
Cut the bread into thin slices, toast it until 
it is crisp, not hard; spread this mixture on 
one slice, cover it with another, and cut into 
shapes. 

Workman's Cheese Sandwiches 

Cut slices of brown bread about a half 
inch thick. Do not remove the crusts. Take 
a half pint of cottage cheese ; press it through 
a sieve; add to it two tablespoonfuls of 
melted butter, a half teaspoonful of salt and 
two tablespoonfuls of thick cream. Beat 
until smooth and light. Spread each slice 
of bread thickly with the cheese mixture, 
then put a very thin slice of white bread on 
top of the cheese, then cheese and brown 
bread, press together. Have the outside 
brown bread with a layer of cheese on each, 



MRS. RORER'S SANDWICHES 25 

and between the layers of cheese a slice of 
white bread. These are palatable, and are 
very much better for the average workman 
than bread and ham. 

German Sandwiches 

Put a half pound of Swiss cheese through 
the meat grinder ; add to it the yolks of two 
eggs, four tablespoonfuls of olive oil, a dash 
of cayenne and a half teaspoonful of salt. 
Rub until you have a perfectly smooth paste. 
Put this mixture between layers of buttered 
rye bread and serve. Do not trim the crusts 
nor cut. 

Honolulu Sandwiches 

Put two Spanish sweet peppers (pimien- 
tos), one Neufchatel cheese, one pared and 
quartered apple and twelve blanched almonds 
through the meat grinder. These may be 
put through alternately, or mixed as you 
grind. Rub the mixture, add a half tea- 
spoonful of salt and a saltspoonful of pap- 
rika. Spread this between thin slices of but- 
tered white or brown bread. Press, cut the 
crusts and cut into fingers. 



26 MRS. RORER'S SANDWICHES 

My Favorite 

Y* pound of American cheese 

y 2 cupful of thick sour cream 

i teaspoonful of Worcestershire sauce 

i tablespoonful of tomato catsup 

^4 teaspoonful of salt 

Y-Z teaspoonful of paprika 

Chop or mash the cheese, add gradually 
the cream, and when smooth add all the other 
ingredients. Spread this mixture on thin 
slices of buttered bread, cover the top with 
chopped cress, then cover with another slice 
of bread, press the two together, trim off the 
crusts and cut into triangles. 

Creole Sandwiches 

Put a half pound of American cheese 
through your meat grinder, add to it one 
Neufchatel cheese, mix well together; add 
one fresh peeled chopped tomato. Peel the 
tomato and cut it into halves; squeeze out 
the seeds and chop the flesh quite fine. Add 
one finely chopped sweet red pepper. Add a 
half teaspoonful of salt and a little black 
pepper; mix and spread between slices of 
white bread, or you may use one slice of 



MRS. RORER S SANDWICHES 2J 

white with one slice of whole wheat bread. 
These are usually served cut into rounds 
with an ordinary cake cutter. If you cut 
these economically you can make one good 
sized round sandwich and a crescent from 
each, or if you use a very small cutter you 
should make four round sandwiches. 

Curry Sandwiches 

Rub one Neufchatel or Philadelphia 
cream cheese to a paste. Add one pimiento, 
chopped fine; a dozen almonds put through 
the meat grinder ; a dozen pecan meats, also 
ground; a tablespoonful of tomato catsup, a 
level teaspoonful of curry and two table- 
spoonfuls of desiccated grated cocoanut. 
Mix thoroughly, add sufficient olive oil to 
make a smooth paste, and spread between 
thin, unbuttered slices of white bread; trim 
the crusts and cut into long fingers. These 
are nice to serve with plain lettuce salad at 
dinner. 



28 MRS. RORER'S SANDWICHES 

Deviled Cheese Sandwiches 

Put one pound of American cheese 
through your meat chopper. Add two table- 
spoonfuls of tomato catsup, one teaspoonful 
of Worcestershire sauce, a half teaspoonful 
of paprika, a dash of cayenne, two table- 
spoonfuls of olive oil or melted butter, four 
tablespoonfuls of sherry and a half teaspoon- 
ful of salt. Mix until perfectly smooth, and 
spread between thin slices of buttered bread ; 
trim the crusts and cut into triangles. 

Roquefort Sandwiches 

Mash a quarter of a pound of Roquefort 
cheese, adding gradually sufficient melted 
butter to make a paste. Spread this between 
slices of buttered bread, press together, trim 
the crusts, and cut into fingers. 

Camembert Sandwiches 

Spread Camembert cheese between slices 
of buttered whole wheat bread, trim the 
crusts and cut into shape. These may be 



MRS. RORERS SANDWICHES 29 

served after lunch with coffee, or are ex- 
ceedingly nice for picnics or for afternoons 
where coffee is served. 

Cottage Cheese Sandwiches 

These are nice for country picnics. The 
cottage cheese should be made rather dry. 
After it has drained and is quite dry, mois- 
ten it by adding either thick cream or melted 
butter ; do not make it too soft. Add a salt- 
spoonful of black pepper and a palatable sea- 
soning of salt. Spread between slices of 
buttered whole wheat or white bread, press 
the two together, trim the crusts and cut 
into shape. 

Salt-Cucumber Sandwiches 

Spread the bread, and cut the slices about 
half an inch thick. Then cut a German or 
Holland cucumber into very thin slices; put 
these slices all over the bread. Take the 
center from a head of lettuce; hold it to- 
gether, and slice it down in sort of shreds; 
put this over the cucumber, and have ready 
some white meat of chicken, cut into the 



3O MRS. RORER S SANDWICHES 

thinnest possible slices, and cover the lettuce 
with chicken ; then sprinkle over more shred- 
ded lettuce and a little mayonnaise ; put over 
another slice of buttered bread; press the 
two together, trim into shape and serve on 
a napkin in a pretty wicker basket. 

Cucumber Sandwiches 

These are very nice to serve with a fish 
course in place of bread or rolls and a salad. 
Slice the cucumbers very thin and soak them 
in ice water for one or two hours. They 
must be crisp and brittle and made just at 
serving time. Beat together three table- 
spoonfuls of olive oil, one tablespoonful of 
vinegar, a saltspoonful of salt and a dash of 
pepper ; stand this dressing on the ice until it 
thickens. Butter thin slices of bread, cover 
them with a layer of cucumbers that have 
been drained and dried on a napkin, sprinkle 
over the dressing, put on another layer of 
buttered bread. Press together, trim the 
crusts and cut into triangles. Heap these at 
once on a napkin and send to the table.

Curried Oyster Sandwiches 

Butter a slice of bread before you take it 
off the loaf; cut it about a half inch thick 
and remove the crusts. First of all, cover 
each slice with a thin layer of hard-boiled 
egg that has been pressed through a sieve 
or chopped very fine. In the center of this 
sandwich put the soft parts of six pickled 
oysters. Put a tablespoonful of butter and 
one of flour into a little saucepan ; mix with- 
out melting; add a gill of thick cream, a 
teaspoonful of onion juice and a teaspoonful 
of curry and a half teaspoonful of turmeric. 
Bring to boiling point; beat and stand away 
until perfectly cold. When you are ready 
to serve the sandwiches, cover each one with 
a thin layer of this sauce ; put a slice of bread 
on top, press together, and serve. The 
sauce must not go over the sandwiches until 
you are ready to serve ; and then, remember, 
you have but one layer between two slices of 
bread.

Curried Egg Sandwiches 

Hard boil four eggs, remove the yolks 
from the whites; chop the whites very, very 
fine, and press the yolks through a sieve. 
Add to the yolks gradually four tablespoon- 
fuls of melted butter or olive oil, a half tea- 
spoonful of salt, a teaspoonful of onion juice, 
a half teaspoonful of curry, and rub until 
thoroughly smooth. Spread thin slices of 
bread, cover them with a very thin layer of 
the yolk mixture, then a layer of the chopped 
whites, another slice of buttered bread. 
Press together, trim the crusts and cut into 
shapes. 

Curried Sardine Sandwiches 

Remove the heads, tails and bones from 
one large box of sardines. Rub them to a 
paste, add a tablespoonful of melted butter, 
a half teaspoonful of curry powder and a 
saltspoonful of salt. Spread this mixture 
between slices of buttered bread, press the 
two together, trim the crusts and cut into 
shape. 



MRS. RORER S SANDWICHES 33 

Curried Chicken Sandwiches 

Chop sufficient cold boiled chicken to 
make a half pint. Rub together one table- 
spoonful of butter and one tablespoonful of 
flour ; add a half cupful of cold milk, and stir 
over hot water until you have a smooth, thick 
paste. Add the chicken gradually to this, 
mashing and rubbing all the while. Add a 
level teaspoonful of curry powder, a half tea- 
spoonful of salt, a teaspoonful of onion juice 
and a teaspoonful of lemon juice. When 
cold, spread between layers of buttered 
bread, trim the crusts and cut into shapes. 

Almost any bits of left-over meat may be 
substituted for the chicken and made into 
sandwiches of this kind. 

Crab Sandwiches 

Remove the meat from six hard-boiled 
crabs; mix it with four tablespoonfuls of 
mayonnaise dressing; put it between slices 
of bread and butter and press two together ; 
trim off the crusts, cut into triangles and 
serve at once. 



34 MRS. RORER'S SANDWICHES 

Crab and lobster sandwiches should not 
be allowed to stand for more than an hour, 
and then must be wrapped carefully in a 
clean, damp cloth. 

Cream of Chicken Sandwiches 

Take sufficient white meat of chicken to 
make a half cup; chop and pound it; reduce 
it to a paste. Put a teaspoonful of granu- 
lated gelatin in two tablespoonfuls of cold 
water ; then stand it over the fire until it has 
dissolved. Whip a half pint of cream to a 
stiff froth. Add the gelatin to the chicken; 
add a teaspoonful of grated horseradish and 
a half teaspoonful of salt. Stir this until it 
begins to thicken, cool and add carefully the 
whipped cream and stand it away until very 
cold. When ready to make the sandwiches, 
butter the bread and cut the slices a little 
thicker than the usual slices for sandwiches. 
Cover each slice with this cream mixture; 
trim off the crusts and cut sandwiches into 
fancy shapes. Garnish the top with olives 
cut into rings. In the center of each sand- 
wich make just a little mound of capers, 
using the olives at the four corners; each 



MRS. RORERS SANDWICHES 35 

sandwich may be garnished in a different 
way. Little pieces of celery, with the white 
top attached, make also a pretty garnish. 
These sandwiches are not covered with a 
second slice of bread. 



Deviled Sandwiches 

Chop a quarter of a pound of cold, boiled 
tongue very fine; add to it two tablespoon- 
fuls of olive oil, a dash of red pepper, a tea- 
spoonful of Worcestershire sauce, and a salt- 
spoonful of paprika ; mix and add the hard- 
boiled yolks of three eggs that have been 
pressed through a sieve. Put this between 
thin slices of bread and butter, and garnish 
with water cress. 



Egg Sandwiches No. I 

Take the hard-boiled yolks of six eggs 
and rub them to a paste, adding gradually

Fish Sandwiches 

Rub to a smooth paste a quarter of a 
pound of cold, boiled fish; add half a tea- 
spoonful of Worcestershire sauce, a table- 
spoonful of olive oil, a half saltspoonful of 
salt, and a half saltspoonful of black pepper. 
Spread the slices of bread on the loaf, cut 
them off about a half inch in thickness ; trim 
off the crusts, put on each slice dainty let- 
tuce leaves, and fill the center with the fish 
mixture. Cover with another layer of but- 
tered bread from which you have trimmed 
the crusts, and press the two together. 

Flaked Fish Sandwiches 

Flake cold boiled white fleshed fish, dust 
it with salt and pepper and sprinkle it with

mayonnaise in the center, put on another 
layer of chopped cress, then a slice of but- 
tered brown bread. Press together and cut 
into halves. 

Spanish Sandwiches

spoonful of tomato catsup, two saltspoonfuls 
of paprika, four tablespoonfuls of chopped 
parsley, a half teaspoonful of salt, and at last 
stir in four tablespoonfuls of mayonnaise 
dressing. Spread this between thin slices of 
buttered bread, trim the crusts and cut into 
shape.

middle and cover with another slice of but- 
tered bread. Press together, trim the crusts 
and cut into triangles. 

Swedish Sandwiches

salt, pepper and lemon juice. Rub the bot- 
tom of a bowl with a clove of garlic, add a 
half cupful of mayonnaise, four finely chop- 
ped gherkins, twelve chopped olives and two 
tablespoonfuls of capers. Mix and stir in 
two tablespoonfuls of finely chopped parsley.

plain slice of bread, do not butter the bread, 
cover it with fish, put on top a crisp lettuce 
leaf, then cover with another slice of bread 
that has been spread with the dressing. 
Press, trim the crusts and cut into fingers. 



MRS. RORER'S SANDWICHES 39 

French Chicken Sandwiches 

Chop the white meat of one chicken very 
fine; pound to a paste. Add one-half tea- 
spoonful of salt and a dash of red pepper. 
Cover one tablespoonful of gelatin, with a 
tablespoonful of cold water, soak it for about 
five minutes, then add to it ten tablespoon- 
f uls of thick cream ; stand this over teakettle 
and stir until gelatin is dissolved. Now, beat 
into this the chicken, stand it aside in a 
square pan until cold. Cut the chicken into 
very thin slices ; put a slice on a slice of but- 
tered bread ; cover this with another slice of 
bread and cut into shape. 

Game Sandwiches 

Remove the breasts from two partridges 
after they have been baked or roasted. Chop 
the meat rather fine ; reduce two sardines to 
a paste. While you are mashing the sar- 
dines, add gradually about two tablespoon- 
fuls of soft butter, a dash of red pepper and 
a half teaspoonful of salt. Spread the bread 
first with the sardine paste; then sprinkle 
over the chopped game; dust this with salt 



40 MRS. RORER'S SANDWICHES 

and a little pepper; cover with another slice 
of bread, press lightly ; trim into shape. 



German Sandwiches 

Cut thin slices of rye bread ; butter before 
you take them from the loaf. Spread each 
slice with a thin layer of limburger cheese. 
Cut bologna sausage into the thinnest possi- 
ble slices ; cover the limburger with the sliced 
bologna, and then a thin piece of pumper- 
nickel ; cover with another slice of bread that 
has been coated with a layer of cheese. Press 
the two together; do not remove the crusts. 
Serve on a napkin in a wicker basket.

same as tongue sandwiches. 



MRS. RORER S SANDWICHES 4! 

Indian Sandwiches 

Take two sardines, remove skin and 
bones, put them into mortar and pound fine ; 
add a teaspoonful of anchovy paste, a dash 
of salt and red pepper and the hard-boiled 
yolks of six eggs, rubbed smooth; stir two 
tablespoonfuls of olive oil into the mixture 
at the last. Cut bread into slices about half 
an inch thick, remove crusts, then cut into 
crescent-shaped pieces, toast, butter and 
cover with the mixture, serve at once. 

Lettuce Sandwiches 

Have bread made into a large, square 
loaf, take off the crust from one end, butter 
and then cut into slices. Take the white part 
of lettuce, wash and wipe it perfectly dry; 
have ready three hard-boiled eggs, remove 
the yolks, put them through a sieve and rub 
to a perfectly smooth paste with four table- 
spoonfuls of very thick cream. Add one- 
half tablespoonful lemon juice and then stir 
in about four tablespoonfuls of whipped 
cream ; season with red pepper and add tea- 
spoonful of salt. Cover slices of bread with 



42 MRS. RORER S SANDWICHES 

leaves of lettuce, put on a goodly quantity 
of dressing and then on top of this another 
slice of bread. This may be served in 
squares tied together with ribbon, or they 
may be pressed and cut into long narrow 
pieces. Of course, they must be made only 
a short time before serving. 

Lobster Sandwiches 

Whole wheat bread or the ordinary Bos- 
ton brown bread is the most desirable for 
these sandwiches. Plunge the lobster into 
hot water; bring to boiling point, and sim- 
mer gently three-quarters of an hour; re- 
move the meat, and cut it with a silver knife 
into dice. Now, sprinkle the lobster with a 
little salt, red pepper and a tablespoonful of 
tarragon vinegar. Allow it to stand for a 
few minutes, and then sprinkle over two or 
three tablespoonfuls of melted butter. As 
soon as the butter has chilled on the lobster, 
put a goodly layer over a slice of buttered 
bread; cover with another slice of bread; 
press the two together, and remove the 
crusts. Remember, there is only one layer 
of lobster between two slices of bread. 



MRS. RORER'S SANDWICHES 43 

Lobster Salad Sandwiches 

Cut fine the solid portion from one boiled 
lobster, put it into a bowl, dust it lightly with 
salt and pepper and sprinkle over two table- 
spoonfuls of lemon juice. Make a half cup- 
ful of mayonnaise from the yolk of one egg 
and eight tablespoonfuls of olive oil. Select 
crisp lettuce leaves. Mix the mayonnaise 
with the lobster, put a thin layer over a slice 
of buttered bread, cover with a lettuce leaf, 
put another thin layer of lobster on top of the 
lettuce leaf, then a second slice of buttered 
bread. Press firmly together, cut off the 
crusts and cut the slices into halves long 
ways, or you may make it into three fingers. 

Mutton Sandwiches 

Chop a half pound of cold, cooked mut- 
ton very fine; add two tablespoonfuls of 
cream or olive oil, a tablespoonful of capers, 
half a teaspoonful of salt, and a saltspoonful 
of pepper ; mix thoroughly. Butter the slices 
on the loaf ; cut them one-half inch thick, and 
trim off the crusts. Spread thickly with the 
mixture; put at each of the four corners a 



44 MRS. RORER'S SANDWICHES 

mint leaf; put on top another slice of but- 
tered bread, from which you have trimmed 
the crust, press the two together, and cut 
from corner to corner making four triangles. 
These sandwiches may also be flavored 
with tomato catsup. 

Mutton Club Sandwiches 

Cut brown bread into rounds or circles 
with an ordinary cake cutter. Chop one-half 
pound of cold, boiled mutton rather fine ; add 
two tablespoonfuls of olive oil, half a tea- 
spoonful of salt, and a saltspoonful of pap- 
rika. Peel four or five quite solid tomatoes, 
cut them into slices and push out the seeds. 
Put a slice of tomato on top of a round of 
bread, fill the space from which you have 
taken the seeds with the mutton mixture; 
put on top another round of buttered bread, 
and press the two together. You may, if 
you like, put on top of the tomato a lettuce 
leaf, and in the center of that half a tea- 
spoonful of mayonnaise dressing. Nice for 
luncheon on a warm day. 



MRS. RORER'S SANDWICHES 45 

English Mutton Sandwiches 

Chop sufficient cold boiled mutton to 
make a pint. Add to it two tablespoonfuls 
of capers, a half teaspoonful of salt, six ta- 
blespoonfuls of cream or olive oil and a salt- 
spoonful of pepper. Mash carefully and put 
between layers of buttered bread; trim the 
crusts and cut into triangles. 

Spring Lamb Sandwiches 

Grind sufficient lamb to make a half pint, 
putting through the meat grinder with the 
lamb the leaves from six stalks of mint. Add 
a half teaspoonful of salt, two tablespoonfuls 
of melted butter or cream, and a saltspoonful 
of pepper. Rub this to a paste and spread 
between toasted English muffins. Leaves of 
mint may be put over the top of the lamb be- 
fore putting the muffins together. 

Turkish Sandwiches 

Chop sufficient cold roasted mutton to 
make a pint; add two solid tomatoes from a 
can of tomatoes, or two fresh tomatoes. 



4 6 

peeled, the seeds pressed out and the flesh 
chopped fine. Add a half cupful of pinons 
or pine nuts, and sufficient olive oil to bind 
the whole together. Spread this between 
thin, warm milk or beaten biscuits and serve 
for afternoon tea or supper. 

Picnic Sandwiches 

Take the ordinary French rolls; make a 
round opening in the top of each, and then, 
with your finger, scoop out all the crumb, 
leaving the roll in shape with a very small 
opening on top. Save the little piece of 
crust from the top of the opening. Mix to- 
gether four olives, one gherkin, a tablespoon- 
ful of capers and one large green, sweet 
pepper, chopped very fine. Chop fine two 
ounces of tongue, and mix it with the white 
meat of one chicken, chopped fine. Mix .o- 
gether, and moisten with a well-made may- 
onnaise dressing. Fill this into the roll, put 
on the top, and arrange neatly on a napkin 
in a wicker basket; serve at once. The rolls 
may be prepared and the mixture made some 
time before serving, but the two should be 
put together at the last moment. 



MRS. RORER'S SANDWICHES 47 

Potato Sandwiches 

Mash four good-sized boiled potatoes; 
add a level teaspoonful of salt, four table- 
spoonfuls of thick cream, and the yolks of 
four hard-boiled eggs rubbed to a smooth 
paste, a saltspoonful of pepper, two table- 
spoonfuls of olive oil; mix thoroughly until 
you have a perfectly smooth paste. Put this 
between slices of brown bread and butter, 
trim off the crusts, and cut into triangles. 
The top may be garnished with cress or let- 
tuce. 

Salad Sandwiches 

Chop fine half a pound of cold, cooked 
chicken; mix with it six tablespoonfuls of 
mayonnaise dressing; add half a teaspoonful 
of salt and a saltspoonful of pepper ; put this 
between slices of bread and butter, and cut 
into fancy shapes. 

These sandwiches may also be trimmed 
with lettuce or cress, and almost any meat 
may be substituted for the chicken. If beef 
is used, a tablespoonful of tomato catsup may 
be added; with mutton a tablespoonful of 
capers. Beef is much better garnished with 



48 MRS. RORER'S SANDWICHES 

cress, mutton with mint, chicken with lettuce 
or celery. 

Lobsters and crabs may be mixed with 
mayonnaise and used as a salad sandwich; 
garnish of course with lettuce. 

Fish Salad Sandwiches 

Flake one can of salmon, or an equal 
quantity of cold boiled fish. Add to it a half 
teaspoonful of salt, a dash of cayenne and 
one ordinary cucumber, grated and drained. 
Just before serving time butter the bread, cut 
it into thin slices, put over the top a layer of 
the flaked fish, then a thin layer of mayon- 
naise or sandwich dressing and another cov- 
ering of bread. Press together, trim the 
crusts and cut directly across the slice, mak- 
ing two long sandwiches about an inch and 
a half to two inches wide. 

Sardine Salad Sandwiches 

These, like salmon sandwiches, are made 
from materials usually in every household, 
and can be made at a moment's notice. Stir 
four tablespoonfuls of oil into an egg, add a 



MRS. RORER'S SANDWICHES 49 

few drops of vinegar or lemon juice. Re- 
move the sardines from the oil, take off the 
tails and heads and remove the bones. Mash 
them in a bowl, add a tablespoonful of vin- 
egar, or the same amount of lemon juice. If 
you have lettuce or cress, either shred it, or 
put one leaf between the fish and the buttered 
bread. 

Sardine Sandwiches 

Cut slices of bread about one-half an inch 
thick, butter and toast; trim off the crust. 
Remove skin and bones from the sardines, 
lay them carefully over toast; have ready, 
chopped very fine, some olives and capers, 
mixed together ; sprinkle these over the sar- 
dines, then a teaspoonful of lemon juice to 
each sandwich. Cut into any shape you may 
desire and they are ready to serve. 

Swiss Sandwiches 

Put half a pound of ordinary schmier- 
kase into a bowl, rub it perfectly smooth; 
add, a teaspoonful at a time, four tablespoon- 
fuls of thick cream, two tablespoonfuls of 
melted butter, half a teaspoonful of salt, and 



5O MRS. RORER S SANDWICHES 

a saltspoonful of pepper. Butter the slices 
of bread on the loaf ; cut each off about a half 
inch in thickness, trim off the crusts and 
spread with the cheese mixture; put on top 
a layer of pumpernickel or rye bread ; on top 
of that another thin layer of cheese, and 
on top of that another layer of white bread 
and butter ; press these lightly together. If 
the crusts have been trimmed off, cut the 
slices into three or four finger shaped sand- 
wiches. They should be the length of the 
slice and about one inch wide. These are 
exceedingly nice garnished with cress. 

In arranging them for serving, put a 
layer of sandwiches and a layer of cress all 
through the basket or dish. 

Tongue Sandwiches 

Chop cold boiled tongue very fine. To 
each cupful stir in two tablespoonfuls of 
melted butter, dash of red pepper and about 
one-half teaspoonful of onion juice. Have 
bread sufficiently stale to cut nicely. Remove 
end crust, butter and cut a very thin slice; 
remove the crusts. Spread it with the ton- 
gue paste, roll each sandwich carefully, tie 



MRS. RORER'S SANDWICHES 51 

with narrow ribbon and put away until 
wanted. These can be made several hours 
before serving. 

Sandwich Dressing 

Put four tablespoonfuls of vinegar and 
three of water into a saucepan over the fire ; 
add a half teaspoonful of salt and a half salt- 
spoonful of pepper. Beat the yolks of four 
eggs until creamy, add slowly to them the 
hot mixture. Stir over hot water until it is 
the consistency of mayonnaise dressing. 
Take from the fire and add carefully two 
level tablespoonfuls of butter. 



Farmer's Sandwiches 

Butter each slice on the loaf, slice it off 
very thin. Remove the crusts, lay a crisp 
lettuce leaf on one half the buttered slices, 
spread with sandwich dressing and cover 
with a slice of buttered bread. Press the two 
together and cut into triangles. Cress, Ro- 
maine, or bleached chicory may be used in 
place of lettuce. These are more appetizing 



52 MRS. RORER'S SANDWICHES 

than ordinary bread and butter sandwiches, 
and are made from materials found in every 
household. 

Farmer's Egg Sandwiches 

Put six eggs into warm water, bring to 
a boil and keep at boiling point, without boil- 
ing hard, for a half hour. Throw them into 
cold water, remove the shells and cut them 
into slices lengthwise. A very fine wire is 
best for cutting eggs. Butter the slices on 
the loaf, then cut them off, cover with slices 
of hard-boiled eggs, dust lightly with salt 
and pepper. Spread the eggs carefully with 
sandwich dressing, put on another slice of 
buttered bread, press the two together and 
cut into triangles. If you have lettuce or 
cress put a leaf over the dressing. 

Deviled Beef Sandwiches 

Chop remains of cold cooked beef very 
fine. To each pint add one tablespoonful of 
tomato catsup, a dash of cayenne, two table- 
spoonfuls of melted butter, a teaspoonful of 
Worcestershire sauce, a half teaspoonful of 



MRS. RORER'S SANDWICHES 53 

paprika and a tablespoonful of onion juice. 
Rub to a paste and put between thin slices of 
buttered bread, trim off the crusts and cut 
into triangles. 

Corned Beef Sandwiches 

Chop sufficient cold cooked corned beef 
to make a pint. Add to it a teaspoonful of 
horseradish, four tablespoonfuls of melted 
butter or olive oil and four or five tablespoon- 
fuls of finely-shredded water cress. Put this 
between slices of buttered whole wheat or 
brown bread; trim the crusts and cut into 
triangles. 

Plain Corned Beef Sandwiches 

Butter an equal quantity of white and 
whole wheat bread. Cut the cooked corned 
beef into very thin slices. Put a slice on a 
slice of buttered bread, put on top a tea- 
spoonful of creamed horseradish sauce, 
spread it out, cover with cress leaves, or 
crisp lettuce leaf, put on a slice of whole 
wheat bread, press the two together, trim 
the crusts and cut into fingers about one 
inch wide. 



54 MRS. RORER S SANDWICHES 

To make the creamed horseradish sauce, 
stir thick, dry whipped cream into dry horse- 
radish. If the horseradish is in vinegar, 
press out the vinegar and then fold in the 
whipped cream. 

Sandwiches a la Stanley 

Cut cold beef loaf or roll into very thin 
slices. Bake three or four bananas, and 
make a creamed horseradish sauce according 
to preceding recipe. Butter white or whole 
wheat bread, put on first a slice of meat, then 
just a thin layer of the mashed baked banana, 
then a teaspoonful of horseradish sauce, and 
another slice of bread. Press together, trim 
the crusts, cut into triangles and serve. 
These sandwiches should be served soon 
after they are made. 

English Salt-Beef Sandwiches 

Whip a half cupful of cream until it is 
very stiff. Put four tablespoonfuls of freshly 
grated horseradish or horseradish pressed 
free from vinegar into a bowl, add the yolk 
of an egg and a saltspoonful of salt ; mix and 



MRS. RORER'S SANDWICHES 55 

fold in the whipped cream. Have ready very 
thin slices of cold boiled salt beef. Butter 
thin slices of bread, put on a layer of salt 
beef, then a thin layer of the horseradish 
sauce and another layer of buttered bread. 
Press together, trim the crusts and cut into 
triangles. 

Sandwiches a la Bernhardt 

Chop sufficient very rare cold roasted 
beef to make a half pint; mix with it a dash 
of cayenne, a half teaspoonful of salt, a table- 
spoonful of tomato catsup, a tablespoonful of 
mango chutney, two shallots, a half clove of 
garlic and a tablespoonful of olive oil. 
Spread this on a thin slice of buttered brown 
bread, cover it with leaves of cress, and then 
put on another thin slice of buttered white 
bread. Press the two together, cut into 
crescents or triangles. 

East Indian Lentil Sandwiches 

Take any left-over boiled or stewed len- 
tils and press them through a sieve. To 
each half cupful of this mixture add a half 



56 MRS. RORER'S SANDWICHES 

cupful of chopped pecans, a level teaspoonful 
of curry and a saltspoonful of salt. Spread 
thin slices of brown bread with butter, then 
put over a thick layer of this mixture and 
cover with chopped parsley. Cover with 
another layer of brown bread, press together, 
trim the crusts and cut into fingers. 

Nut-Butter Sandwiches 

Mix one glass of nut butter with two ta- 
blespoonfuls of olive oil and one tablespoon- 
ful of chopped pimientos. Spread this on a 
slice of unbuttered brown bread, cover with 
finely-chopped cress or shredded lettuce, 
place on top a slice of buttered bread, press 
the two together, trim the crusts and cut into 
fingers an inch wide. 

Filipino Sandwiches 

Add one grated pineapple to a tumbler 
of peanut butter, mix thoroughly, add a ta- 
blespoonful of lemon juice, a dash of cay- 
enne, a half teaspoonful of paprika. Put this 
between thin slices of brown bread, buttered ; 
press together and cut into halves. 



SWEET SANDWICHES 

Under this heading we place all those 
dainty sandwiches that are made from thin 
slices of bread and butter and a jam or fruit 
filling. They are usually cut into circles; it 
is more economical to do this before the 
bread is buttered, unless you can cut rounds 
from one side, and a crescent above it. Al- 
most any sweet may be used. Serve with 
chocolate or coffee according to the fruit, 
either for an afternoon tea or an "evening/' 

Cherry Sandwiches 

Chop a quarter of a pound of candied 
cherries very fine, adding occasionally as you 
chop them a few drops of orange juice, if 
you use wine, a few drops of sherry. Mix 
thoroughly and spread over water thins, 
making it a little deeper in the center than at 
the edges. These sandwiches are better 
made from crackers than from bread. Ar- 
range neatly on a pretty glass dish, and they 
are ready to serve. 



58 MRS. RORER'S SANDWICHES 

Fig Sandwiches 

Split a dozen figs and scrape out the soft 
portion, rejecting the skins; work this to a 
paste. Cut the slices of bread from the loaf, 
buttering before you cut them; make them 
quite thin. Remove the crusts, and spread 
this thick paste over the bread and roll care- 
fully; press for a moment until there is no 
danger of the roll opening; roll each in a 
piece of tissue paper; twist the ends as you 
would an old-fashioned "secret," or they may 
be tied with baby ribbon. These are exceed- 
ingly wholesome and palatable. 

Fruit and Nut Sandwiches 

These are perhaps the most attractive of 
all the sweet sandwiches. 

Put through the meat chopper a quarter 
of a pound of almonds with half a pound of 
washed figs, the same quantity of dates, the 
same of raisins, and a pound of pecan nuts ; 
put them through alternately so that they 
will be mixed in chopping. Pack the mix- 
ture into round baking powder tins, pressing 
it down firmly, and stand it aside over night. 



MRS. RORER'S SANDWICHES 59 

When wanted, dip the tin in hot water, 
loosen it with a knife and "shake out the mix- 
ture. With a sharp knife cut into very thin 
slices and put them between two rounds of 
buttered bread. Serve with chocolate. 

The combination may be varied ; candied 
cherries, citron or any of the candied fruits 
may be substituted for the dates and figs. 
Brazilian and pine nuts may be substituted 
for a portion of the pecans. 

Orange Marmalade Sandwiches 

These sandwiches may be made precisely 
the same as fig sandwiches, substituting the 
orange marmalade for the figs. 

Sponge Cake Sandwiches 

Bake a sponge cake in a square loaf ; cut 
it into slices a quarter of an inch thick; cut 
the slices into rounds with a small biscuit 
cutter. With another small cutter take out 
the center leaving the ring; put this ring on 
top of a solid round making sort of a patty 
as it were; fill the spaces with a mixture of 
chopped candied fruit that has been soaked 



6o MRS. RORER'S SANDWICHES 

in orange juice over night; cover the top 
with the meringue made from white of egg 
and sugar; put them in the oven to brown, 
dish neatly and they are ready to use. These 
cannot stand over an hour as the fruit will 
soften the cake. 

Fresh Fruit Sandwiches 

These sandwiches are exceedingly nice to 
serve for afternoon teas. They must be used 
soon after they are made. They will, how- 
ever, if wrapped in a damp napkin, keep for 
an hour, but as fruit is soft the bread is liable 
to become moist, which spoils the sandwich. 

Butter the bread and put between layers 
of sliced strawberries, dusted with powdered 
sugar; or raspberries, or large blackberries 
cut into halves; or peaches, finely chopped; 
or apple seasoned with a little salt, pepper, 
olive oil and lemon juice; or sliced bananas 
with a dash of lemon juice, are all nice. 

Raisin Sandwiches 

Put one-half pound of seeded raisins 
through the meat grinder, add a quarter of a 
pound of almonds that have been blanched, 



MRS. RORER'S SANDWICHES 61 

dried and ground. Add a half tumbler of 
quince jelly, mix thoroughly and put between 
thin slices of buttered white bread. These 
sandwiches are very nice in place of cake for 
afternoon teas or evening companies. 

Afternoon Teas 

Stone a quarter of a pound of dates, put 
them through a meat grinder, add to them a 
half tumbler of nut butter, mix until smooth, 
add four tablespoonf uls of sweet cream and 
a tablespoonful of orange juice. Put this 
mixture between thin slices of white buttered 
bread, press together, trim the crusts and 
cut into fingers or four small triangles. 

Nut and Apple Sandwiches 

Put a half cupful of thick stewed apples 
into a bowl, add the grated yellow rind of 
quarter of an orange and one cupful of finely 
chopped mixed nuts. Spread this on saltines, 
Uneedas, or any crisp cracker. Put on top 
another cracker and serve at once. These 
are very nice for children's parties. Of 
course one may use buttered bread, either 
white or brown. 



62 MRS. RORER'S SANDWICHES 

Grape Fruit Sandwiches 

Spread any crisp cracker with a thin 
layer of grape fruit marmalade, put on top 
another cracker and serve at once. 

Ginger Sandwiches 

Put four or five pieces of ginger through 
your meat chopper. Stir this paste into a 
half cupful of orange marmalade. Put be- 
tween slices of buttered bread, press them 
together, trim the crusts and cut into fingers. 
These are nice for afternoon teas. Ginger 
and carrot marmalade are also very nice. 



CANAPES 

These are slices of bread cut. into fancy 
shapes, toasted or quickly fried in hot oil, or 
they may be spread with butter and browned 
in a quick oven. One slice only is used for 
each canape. The mixture is spread on top, 
the top garnished, and the canape used at 
once. 

Anchovy Canapes 

Cover a round or square of toast with 
anchovies th^t have been mashed and sea- 
soned with a little tomato catsup. Put a 
little chopped celery around the edge as a 
garnish and send at once to the table. 

Caviar Canapes 

Season the caviar with onion and a very 
little lemon juice; spread over a round or 
square canape, put chopped onion around the 
edge, garnish the top with a hard-boiled egg ; 
place on paper mats and send at once to the 
table. These are used as first course at lunch 
or dinner. 



64 MRS. RORER'S SANDWICHES 

Swedish Canapes 

Cut thick slices of whole wheat or Gra- 
ham bread, trim the crusts and hollow out 
the centers, being careful not to make a hole 
all the way through. Pound or mash the 
hard boiled yolks of three eggs with a table- 
spoonful of anchovy paste or two anchovies, 
two tablespoonfuls of butter and a dash of 
lemon juice. Cut a dill pickle lengthwise 
into slices an eighth of an inch thick, then 
cut these slices into long strips a half inch 
wide. Cut large pickled beets into strips of 
the same width. Cut a dozen pimolas into 
halves. Butter the bread, fill with the paste, 
put over the strips of dill pickle, leaving one 
inch between each strip. Cross these with 
strips of pickled beets, put half of a pimola 
into each square. Dish on paper mats. 
Serve as an appetizer before soup. 

Chopped Tongue Canapes 

Chop cold, cooked tongue very fine; sea- 
son it with two tablespoonfuls of olive oil 
and a dusting of pepper ; spread it over the 
top of a round of toasted bread ; garnish the 



MRS. RORER'S SANDWICHES 65 

edge with the small leaves of cress, put a 
little grated hard-boiled egg in the center 
and send at once to the table. 



Sardine Canapes 

Remove the skin and pound the sardines 
to a paste; put a thick layer of this paste 
over the top of a round of toasted bread. 
Cut one gherkin into very thin slices, ar- 
range them overlapping around the edge; 
put a little finely chopped hard-boiled egg in 
the center, and they are ready to serve. 



Fish Canapes 

Pound a quarter of a pound of cooked 
fish to a paste ; season it with a few drops of 
onion juice, a saltspoonful of salt, and a dash 
of black pepper. Stir into it two tablespoon- 
fuls of sauce tartare; spread this on six or 
eight rounds of buttered bread browned in 
the oven; garnish the tops with grated cu- 
cumber and send to the table. 



66 MRS. RORER'S SANDWICHES 

Deviled Oyster Canapes 

Cut slices of bread into squares, toast 
and remove the crusts. Remove the hard 
part from a pint of pickled oysters, place 
oysters over bread, close together and in 
rotation, dust thickly with red pepper; put 
over as a thin covering a highly seasoned 
sauce mayonnaise, and serve. Do not put 
over a second piece of bread. 

Pate de Foie Gras Canapes 

For twenty-four sandwiches take one 
tureen of foie gras. Remove the fat, and 
mash the foie gras to a perfectly smooth 
paste, adding gradually four tablespoonfuls 
of soft, not melted, butter; add a dash of 
cayenne and a half teaspoonful of salt and 
about ten drops of onion juice, and press the 
whole through a sieve. Cut slices of bread 
into fancy shapes and toast; crescents are 
very pretty. Cover each slice thickly with 
this paste ; garnish with hard-boiled white of 
egg, cut into diamonds or tiny crescents, and 
olives cut into rings. Arrange neatly, and 
they are ready to serve. 



MRS. RORER'S SANDWICHES 67 

Hot Canapes 

A canape is the half of a sandwich, as it 
were. Minced meats of various kinds are 
served on one slice of bread. In many books 
they are called "uncovered sandwiches/' The 
cold canapes are placed always among the 
appetizers and served before the soup. They 
are made of such materials as caviar, sar- 
dines, anchovies, pickled oysters, pickled lob- 
ster, deviled shrimps, or a mixture of one or 
two of these materials. 

A hot canape, however, is served in the 
place of fish or as an entree. If they are 
dressed with either fish or shell-fish they will 
take the place of that course. When made 
from chicken, sweetbreads or game, should 
be served as an entree, following the fish. 

Fish Canapes 

Pick apart sufficient cold cooked fish to 
make a half pint. Rub together two level 
tablespoonf uls of butter and two of flour, add 
a half pint of milk, stir until boiling, add a 
half teaspoonful of salt, a teaspoonful of soy, 
a dash of red pepper and a half saltspoonful 



68 MRS. RORER'S SANDWICHES 

of black pepper. When this is hot add the 
fish and four or five nice sliced mushrooms; 
stand over hot water, without stirring, until 
the fish is thoroughly heated. While this is 
heating, trim the crusts from six slices of 
bread; toast the one side carefully. Have 
ready in your pastry bag with a star tube a 
pint of light mashed potatoes; press in a 
rope-like* form, or in small rosettes, around 
the edge of the bread on the untoasted side. 
Brush the bread with a little melted butter, 
put them in the oven until the potatoes and 
bread are a golden brown. Dish these on 
square paper mats on individual plates, fill 
the centers with the creamed fish and send at 
once to the table. 

Canned salmon may be used in the place 
of fresh boiled fish. 



MRS. RORER'S SANDWICHES 69 

Lobster Canapes 

1 three-pound lobster 
The yolks of two eggs 

2 level tablespoonfuls of butter 
2 level tablespoonfuls of flour 

pint of milk 

tablespoonful of chopped parsley 
level teaspoonful of salt 
saltspoonful of white pepper 
pint of mashed potatoes 
6 slices of bread 

Toast the bread and arrange the potatoes 
according to the preceding recipe. Rub the 
butter and flour together, add the milk ; when 
boiling add the seasoning and the lobster. 
When very hot stir in carefully the well- 
beaten yolks of the eggs. Stir this until it 
is smoking hot, but be careful not to boil, or 
it will curdle. Fill this on top of the toast 
that has been garnished with potatoes, dust 
with chopped parsley and send to the table. 

Shrimps may be substituted for lobster. 



70 MRS. RORER'S SANDWICHES 

Sweetbread Canapes 

1 pair calf's sweetbreads 
YZ can of mushrooms 

2 level tablespoonfuls of butter 
2 level tablespoonfuls of flour 

YZ, pint of milk 
YI teaspoonful of salt 
i saltspoonful of pepper 

Boil the sweetbreads carefully for three- 
quarters of an hour; throw them into cold 
water; pick them apart, rejecting the mem- 
brane. Chop the mushrooms very fine, add 
them to the sweetbreads. Rub the butter 
and flour together, add the milk ; when boil- 
ing add the salt, pepper, sweetbreads and 
mushrooms ; cover and stand over hot water 
ten to fifteen minutes. Serve them on slices 
of bread, garnished with mashed potatoes 
pressed through a star tube. 



MRS. RORERS SANDWICHES 7! 

Canapes a la Trinidad 

Half the white meat from one boiled chicken 

1 pair of sweetbreads 

6 large fresh mushrooms 

2 level tablespoonfuls of butter 
2 level tablespoonfuls of flour 

YZ pint of milk 

2 yolks of hard-boiled eggs 

i level teaspoonful of salt 

i saltspoonful of pepper 

Cut twelve slices of bread ; trim the crusts 
so the slices will be of even size. Cut out 
the centers from one-half the slices, leaving 
a wall of one inch. Toast the solid slices. 
Brush the untoasted edge of the bread with 
a little white of egg, lay on the rims and put 
them in the oven to toast on the upper side. 
Pick the sweetbreads apart, after they are 
carefully cooked, rejecting the membrane. 
Slice the mushrooms. Cut the chicken into 
dice. Put the butter into a saucepan, add the 
mushrooms, toss for a minute until the mush- 
rooms are slightly softened, then add the 
flour, mix, and add the milk, salt and pepper. 
Cover this on the back part of the stove for 
ten or fifteen minutes until the mushrooms 
are cooked; then add the meat. Stand this 
over hot water ten or fifteen minutes. The 



72 MRS. RORER'S SANDWICHES 

toast should now be done and crisp. Ar- 
range each canape on a square of lace paper 
on an individual heated dish, put the mixture 
in the center, garnish with the yolk of the 
eggs pressed through a sieve. Garnish the 
very top with a little chopped truffle or a 
little chopped parsley. These are the hand- 
somest of all hot canapes, and while they are 
usually served following the soup at dinner, 
they may be used for the main course at a 
ladies' luncheon, or at a supper. 

Game Canapes 

Cut any pieces of left-over game into dice. 
Put two tablespoonfuls of butter and two of 
flour in a saucepan, add a half pint of stock. 
When boiling add a half can of very fine 
mushrooms, a tablespoonful of chopped ham, 
a tablespoonful of chopped parsley, a level 
teaspoonful of salt and a saltspoonful of pep- 
per. Bring this to a boil, add the game; 
stand over hot water for fifteen or twenty 
minutes until the game has absorbed part of 
the sauce, then add two tablespoonfuls of 
sherry or Madeira, and fill into the square 
canapes made the same as in preceding recipe. 



MRS. RORER S SANDWICHES 73 

Lamb Canapes 

2 cans, or one quart of cooked peas 

1 blade of mace 

2 level tablespoonfuls of butter 
2 level tablespoonfuls of flour 

Y? pint of stock 

I teaspoonful of kitchen bouquet 
Y-Z teaspoonful of salt 

1 tablespoonful of chopped onion 

2 tablespoonfuls of claret 
I saltspoonful of pepper 

Put the butter and onion in a saucepan, 
shake it over the fire, then add the cold boiled 
lamb, cut into blocks; you should have one 
pint. When this is boiling add all the sea- 
soning and stand the mixture over hot water 
on the back of the stove while you make the 
canapes. Press the peas through a sieve; 
the pulp must be quite dry ; add to it a palat- 
able seasoning of salt and pepper and one or 
two tablespoonfuls of melted butter. Put 
these in a pastry bag. Toast the bread on 
one side, put the peas around in rope-like 
form, or roses, on the untoasted side, making 
a border sufficiently high to hold the lamb. 
Stand in the oven until the bread is carefully 



74 MRS. RORER'S SANDWICHES 

toasted. Arrange them on lace papers on 
heated plates, fill the center with the lamb 
mixture and send to the table. 

Club-House Sandwiches 

Club-house sandwiches may be made in 
a number of different ways, but are served 
warm as a rule on bread carefully toasted at 
the last moment. Put on top of a square of 
toasted bread a thin layer of broiled ham or 
bacon; on top of this a thin slice of Holland 
pickle, on top of that a thin slice of cold 
roasted chicken or turkey, then a leaf of let- 
tuce in the center of which you put a tea- 
spoonful of mayonnaise dressing; cover this 
with another slice of buttered toast. Press 
the two together, and cut from one corner to 
another making two large triangles, and 
send at once to the table. 

People not using ham may make a palat- 
able sandwich by putting down first a layer 
of cold boiled tongue, then a layer of Hol- 
land cucumber, a layer of turkey or chicken, 
another layer of cucumber and the slice of 
toast. Garnish with little pieces of water 
cress before putting on the last slice. 



SCENTED SANDWICHES 

There is a group of rather aesthetic sand- 
wiches made from thin slices of bread and 
butter flavored or scented with flowers. 
Among those in common use are clover, rose 
and the nasturtium. 

The crust is trimmed off from the out- 
side of the loaf; the loaf placed down in a 
clean stone jar in a nest of clover blossoms; 
the butter is put in a piece of cheese cloth 
and also covered with clover, and the jar 
covered over night. The next morning the 
bread and butter will have the flavor of 
clover. 

Rose Sandwiches 

In making rose sandwiches cover the 
bread and butter with rose leaves over night. 
Put a few rose petals between the slices when 
making the sandwiches. 



76 MRS, RORER'S SANDWICHES 

Nasturtium Sandwiches 

Cover the bread and butter with nastur- 
tium flowers over night. In making the 
sandwiches place at each corner of the slice 
a flower, so that in cutting from corner to 
corner you have a little triangular sandwich 
holding a nasturtium flower uncut. 

Violet Sandwiches 

These are made the same, covering the 
slice of bread and butter with the petals of 
the violet.

SOME OTHER BOOKS 
Published by 

Arnold and Company 



Mrs. Rorer's 
NEW Cook Book 

A big book of 731 pages, abundantly illustrated. Its 
bigness is no criterion of its goodness. The fact that 
it is the best work of the best years of Mrs. Rorer's 
life ; that it is a complete new book telling of the things 
one needs to know about cooking, living, health, and 
the easiest and best way of housekeeping these are 
what make for goodness, and place this book far in 
advance of any other of a like nature. 

The New Cook Book covers all departments of 
cookery. A masterly exposition of each subject is 
given, followed by recipes for the proper preparation, 
cooking and serving of the various kinds of foods. 
There are over 1500 recipes in the book. 

The illustrations are an important feature. One 
set of pictures shows the proper dressing of the table 
during a course dinner. Then there is a complete set 
showing the method of carving meats, poultry, game, 
etc.; and many others illustrating special features of 
the book.

Mrs. Rorer's f 
Philadelphia Cook Book 

This is the standard book of Mrs. Rorer's that has 
been before the public for a number of years. It has 
no connection with Mrs. Rorer's New Cook Book. 
Each book is independent of the other, and the posses- 
sion of one forms no reason for doing without the 
other. 

The Philadelphia Cook Book is full of good things, 
and, like all of Mrs. Rorer's works, is eminently prac- 
tical. It is a standard of excellence, in that it is 
full of the brightest things in cookery; the recipes 
are absolutely reliable, and the general instructions 
to housekeepers of the most helpful and necessary 
character. 

Nearly all cook books assume some knowledge and 
experience on the part of those who use them, but Mrs. 
Rorer makes her explanations so clear, and gives such 
definite directions, as to quantities, that the beginner 
has no difficulty in successfully accomplishing all the 
book calls for. Then there are frequent hints as to 
the proper use of left-overs, how to market, and, in 
many ways, information is given that is alike useful to 
the experienced cook as to the tyro in matters culinary. 

The book is full of choice recipes, every one of 
which has been successfully tested by Mrs. Rorer and 
found to come out right. This alone is of incalculable

Mrs. Rarer ^s 

Vegetable Cookery and Meat 
Substitutes 

This book has a twofold object: 

1. To show the value of vegetables in their relation to 
diet and health, how to prepare, cook and serve 
them, what to eat under certain conditions of health, 
and thus have them perform their proper work. 

2. To give to the prudent housewife a knowledge of 
combinations of foods in the shape of toothsome 
recipes to take the place of meat, or as we call 
them Meat Substitutes. 

It goes without saying that we all know too little 
about the value of vegetables as food. We eat them 
because they are palatable, not realizing their immense 
importance as body builders. Here they are classified, 
and thus made to give us a right idea of their use. 

Then as to Meat Substitutes. It is not necessary 
to be a vegetarian to desire a change from a meat diet. 
There are health reasons often demanding abstention 
from meats; or economy may be an impelling motive; 
or a desire for change and variety in the daily bill of 
fare may be warrant enough. However we look at it 
here is the wonder book to point the way to better and 
healthier living. 

There is an abundance of the choicest and most 
palatable recipes, and they are given in such a manner, 
that if the directions are followed, the results are sure. 
You cannot make mistakes.

Mrs. Rorer's 
Every Day Menu Book 

In the course of her teaching and editorial work, 
there have come to Mrs. Rorer frequent requests for 
a book that will provide a daily bill of fare, one that 
will be at once rational, its directions easy of accom- 
plishment, and give an excellent variety. Hence this 
Menu Book. 

It contains a menu for every meal in the year, 
systematically arranged by months and days ; menus for 
special occasions, such as holidays, weddings, luncheons, 
teas, etc.; illustrations of decorated tables for various 
social events, with appropriate menus; menus arranged 
for the seasons both as to food and decorations; a 
department of menus without meats. A fine volume 
that ought to commend itself to every housekeeper.

and valuable recipes for cakes of all sorts and condi- 
tions. Some need filling, some need icing well, here

Mrs. Rorer's 

Canning and Preserving 

The only book on the subject worth the name. In 
it Mrs. Rorer discusses at length the canning and pre- 
serving of fruits and vegetables, with the kindred 
subjects of marmalades, butters, fruit jellies and syrups, 
drying and pickling. The recipes are clearly and simply 
given. In the new edition now presented, the author 
has brought the book up to date, and has included 
many new, rare and original recipes that have been 
accumulating since the book was first introduced. It 
has always been a favorite book with the public, and

Mrs. Rorer's 
My Best 250 Recipes 

It would be strange indeed if, out of the multitude 
of recipes Mrs. Rorer has invented and used during 
her long career as a teacher, writer and lecturer, she 
did not have some that appealed to her more strongly 
than others. She has gathered these together, classi- 
fying them under their different heads. There are Best 
20 Soups; Best 20 Fish Recipes; Best 20 Meats; Best 
20 Salads; Best 20 Desserts; Best 20 Sauces, Vegeta- 
bles, Fruit Preserves, Luncheon Dishes, Ices, Summer 
Recipes, Left Overs, Game and Poultry, Breads and

Mrs. Rorer's New Salads 

For Dinners, Luncheons, Suppers and Receptions. 
With a group of ODD SALADS and some CEYLON SALADS. 

A salad made from a succulent green vegetable and 
French dressing, should be seen on the dinner table 
in every well-regulated household three hundred and 
sixty-five times a year. These green vegetables contain 
the salts necessary to the well being of our blood; the 
oil is an easily-digested form of fatty matter ; the lemon 
juice gives us sufficient acid; therefore simple salads 
are exceedingly wholesome. 

During the summer, the dinner salad may be com- 
posed of any well-cooked green vegetable, served with 
a French dressing; string beans, cauliflower, a mixture 
of peas, turnips, carrots and new beets, boiled radishes, 
cucumbers, tomatoes, uncooked cabbage, and cooked 
spinach. In the winter serve celery, lettuce, endive and 
chicory.

Mrs. Rorer's Dainties 

Possibly no part of the daily bill of fare so taxes 
the ingenuity of the housewife as the dessert, that final 
touch to the meal that lingers in the palate like a bene- 
diction. We tire of constant repetitions of familiar 
things. We want variety. Why not have it when 
there are so many ways and means of gratifying our 
tastes. Mrs. Rorer has given here a number of choice 
things covering quite a range of possibilities.

Made-Over Dishes 

How to transform the left overs into palatable and 
wholesome dishes. With many new and valuable 
recipes. 
We quote from the author's introduction: 

"Economical marketing does not mean the purchase 
of inferior articles at a cheap price, but of a small 
quantity of the best materials found in the market; 
these materials to be wisely and economically used. 
Small quantity and no waste, just enough and not a 
piece too much, is a good rule to remember. In roasts 
and steaks, however, there will be, in spite of careful 
buying, bits left over, that if economically used, may 
be converted into palatable, sightly and wholesome 
dishes for the next day's lunch or supper.

faction that can be had with a Chafing Dish. Few 
people know how to use one successfully, although the

enced person can be sure of results. It is a handy 
thing in an emergency, and it forms a delightful adjunct 
to a supper or dinner. Guests are always interested in 
watching the evolution of some delectable dish, and

her skill.
