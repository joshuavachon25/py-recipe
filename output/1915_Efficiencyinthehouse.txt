preface 



This is a book for every woman. Its object is to save time for the 
busy woman and to solve problems for the young housewife. It is a 
simple plan for business administration in the household. It makes 
it possible for every woman, whether her income be large or small, to 
keep the daily expenses under her personal control and to state 
clearly, at the end of each month, how much money she has spent and 
for what. 

Good administration is as valuable in the home, where the family 
income is spent, as in business, where the family income is made. 

As compared with English, French, German and Italian households, 
there is much unnecessary waste in American homes. Money has 
been acquired with comparative ease, and, in many cases, is carelessly 
spent. It is a satisfaction to any woman to feel that the trust imposed 
upon her by her husband, whose income she spends, is borne faithfully, 
intelligently and well. This book is written to aid every woman to 
arrive at this state of mind easily. It is a short cut towards efficiency. 
It is meant to give to American husbands a square deal. 

The efficient housewife must understand her profession. No man 
could hope to succeed in business who is ignorant of its details. The 
beginner gives his best thought to understanding what is required to 
assure success. Housekeeping is woman's business and to succeed 
she must pursue business methods. 

The most important fact for a business man to know is what capital 
he has and what income he can afford to spend. This knowledge his 
wife has a right to share. Every woman is as vitally interested in her 
husband's future as he. If she has the intelligence to spend money 
wisely she has the wisdom to save money intelligently. A man's wife 
should be his business partner. This is a fact which few American 
men are willing to admit. They supply their wives with money in the 
most generous fashion, but they rarely give them their business con- 
fidence. American wives seldom know the amount of their husband's 
capital or income and so lose the great opportunity for self-develop- 



Preface 

ment which the feeling of responsibility for the mutual good would 
produce. The extravagance of many .women is the direct result of 
this lack of understanding and responsibility and is fundamentally 
the fault of American men. Every woman is entitled to understand 
her husband's business prospects, which are also hers, and to have at 
her disposal a regular monthly allowance with the understanding that 
her part in the family partnership is to spend money wisely and to 
keep within her income. The women whom I have known who have 
enjoyed such a frank business relationship with their husbands have 
responded loyally and intelligently to such responsibility. I believe 
that all women would do so. 

Household management in America seems to be in an unsettled 
state. 

An English household is carefully adjusted, from the housekeeper, 
butler, and lady's maid, who are called "upper servants" and have 
special privileges, to the scullery maid, who stands abashed in the 
presence of these exalted personages and calls them "Miss" and 
"Mister." What food and drink are served in the servants' hall is a 
thing of long usage and its simple wholesomeness is never questioned. 

French women are noted for their efficient management of the 
family income, perhaps partially due to the fact that every woman 
who marries is possessed of a "dot" and therefore is spending her 
own money as well as her husband's. The French have taught us 
the delight of a thoughtfully chosen, perfectly cooked dinner, but 
we have yet to learn from them the thrift and skill in utilizing little 
things which is one of their most admirable characteristics. 

In Germany the "haus frau" takes the care of her servants seri- 
ously and deserves the reputation which she has won for efficiency. 
It requires a clear head as well as a generous heart to provide for her 
household. German servants enjoy five inexpensive meals a day: 
coffee and rolls at seven; bread, cheese or sausage and beer at eleven; 
the food remaining after the family dinner at two, usually served as a 
stew of meat and vegetables, which is their most hearty meal of the 
day; bread and coffee at four; and at eight or later the food remaining 
from the family supper. German women are thoroughly trained in 
all pertaining to the household and look upon their capable manage- 
ment as a duty which they owe to the family fortunes. 

The Italian method of conducting domestic affairs is the fine art of 
avoiding unnecessary effort. The butler and maid prepare the simple 



Preface 

breakfast of coffee, rolls, and butter, and carry the trays to the family 
bedrooms. At ten o'clock the chef arrives, having bought and paid 
for all that he requires for the day for the designated number of per- 
sons to be served at luncheon and dinner. At ten F. M. he presents 
his menus for the following day, with his account of what he has spent 
for the luncheon and dinner just served. Everything is bought in the 
small quantities required for the dishes selected, and when he leaves 
at night his kitchen is empty; all that remains to remind one of his 
skill is a tall earthen jar filled with olive oil from which he dips what 
he needs and which never turns rancid. The butler buys the flowers, 
fruits, and what is required for breakfast, and presents his statement 
every morning. All is done easily, efficiently and graciously, every- 
thing is paid for every day, and the Italian mistress of the household 
knows, with no effort, just how much she is spending and for what. 
This is the perfection of household efficiency. 

In America enormous fortunes have been made in dizzy haste. Per- 
sons of simple tastes and surroundings suddenly find themselves multi- 
millionaires with a palace and a retinue of servants who appear to 
know much more about managing a household than they do. They 
take the course of least resistance and allow their servants to manage 
them, while they uncomplainingly pay the bills. The result is unfair 
to the servants, who, if they grow unruly under such lax management, 
as is apt to be the case, are totally unfitted for a less extravagant 
household. They lose all sense of money value and personal respon- 
sibility. 

Many American women who have had every advantage which 
wealth, culture, and travel can give, take upon themselves the re- 
sponsibilities of a household with no preliminary experience or train- 
ing. They have not enjoyed the benefit of the generations of common- 
sense customs of the English women, the carefully enlightened thrift 
of the French women, the well drilled routine of the German women, 
or the intelligent facility which the centuries have cultivated in the 
Italian women. Every household is a law unto itself, from those in 
which all the ordering is left to extravagant servants and the bills 
unquestioningly paid, to those in which insufficient attention is given 
to the servants' food and comfort, and there is constant dissatisfaction 
and change. We all know homes which answer to 'each of these 
descriptions as well as the charming, well-ordered American homes 
whose sunny atmosphere is an instant assurance that here dwell kind- 



Preface 

ness, order, and a just attention to the comfort and well-being of 
all. The result of this inequality of domestic arrangement is uni- 
versal confusion. Nothing is finally settled, as in the European 
countries mentioned, where generations of one family have lived in the 
same environment according to the same traditions, and the simple 
but wholesome arrangements made for the servants are never ques- 
tioned. There is a stability and restfulness about such well-ordered 
households which Americans residing there find very grateful. Amer- 
ican homes will only arrive at this perfection of organization with its 
consequent atmosphere of repose when American women unite upon 
a wise, simple, effective plan of domestic management which is con- 
sidered representative of American women as a nation. 

A descriptive word readily associates itself in one's mind with 
women of the nationalities mentioned English common-sense, 
French thrift, German organization, Italian facility. There is no 
such word which is universally accepted as descriptive of American 
women. They are considered charming, witty, adaptable, clever, but 
they are never spoken of as wise and thrifty managers of household 
expenses, and the carelessness with which they spend money has 
become proverbial. 

Are American women content to rest under this stigma? Many do 
not deserve it, but it is applied to all. 

Has not the moment arrived when we must accept our responsi- 
bilities seriously and crystallize our national tendencies into a national 
character, in which our women, as a nation, are worthy of the fine 
achievement of our men, as a nation? 

American men lead the world in capable business administration- 
Their minds have grasped and successfully solved such gigantic prob- 
lems that they have elevated the word "business" to a level with the 
most honored professions. Why should American women not emulate 
American men? Why should we not be honored as they are, for the 
intelligent business administration of our homes, until we are known, 
not as extravagant spenders, but as efficient organizers and admin- 
istrators of our households? 

Household efficiency depends upon a carefully planned daily rou- 
tine. The responsible person should know how much she can spend 
per month. This will determine the number of servants employed 
and the style of living. Her two chief sources of outlay will be ser- 
vants' wages and the food supply for her household. It is in the oil- 



Preface 

/nary department that the efficient housewife proves her value. The 
intelligent buying of food is a science, its arrangement in attractive 
and varied form is an art. 

The plan of housekeeping here given has been used by the writer 
for many years. It is because several of her friends have asked for a 
copy and used it successfully that she is encouraged to share it with 
the public. It is easy to understand and to follow. Its success de- 
pends upon the thing necessary to produce success in every business, 
the faithful performance of a daily duty. The duty is simple and 
requires only ten or fifteen minutes of time, but the responsible 
person should not delegate it to others. 

At the head of each calendar day in this book are menus for the 
household dinner and supper and breakfast for the following day. 
The breakfast is placed last because the daily orders are to be written 
each morning and include the food to be purchased for the three meals 
following. 

These menus are prepared for the use of persons of widely differing 
incomes. They are nutritious, economical, and of a pleasing variety. 
They repeat after three weeks and include the fish, vegetables, and 
fruits in season in different months of the year. Any family whose 
income is limited will find them nourishing and attractive and they 
are suitable for growing children. 

In families where few servants are employed it is convenient to 
give them what remains after the family meals have been served. 
In such a household the food is simple and there is comparatively 
little entertaining. 

In a more complex household, where the servants are more numerous 
and frequently prepare and serve luncheons and dinners of several 
courses, it is well to give them their meals before they are called upon 
to perform these duties. In many houses the servants breakfast at 
seven, dine at twelve, and have their supper at half-past five, and their 
meals are cooked separately. These menus are also intended for use 
in such households, the responsible person writing in the spaces in- 
dicated on the opposite pa^e the menus for her family table for lunch- 
eon, dinner, and breakfast for the following day. 

Below the household menu is an order list with spaces headed, 
''meats," "vegetables," "groceries," etc. The daily duty to be per- 
formed by the responsible person is this: She writes in the spaces 
indicated what food she wishes to have served at her table, with the 



Preface 

number to be provided' for written above. The cook looks over these 
and the household menus and states how much meat, fish, butter, 
eggs, groceries, etc., will be required to prepare the coming meals, and 
the responsible person writes the quantity of each in the allotted 
.pace. At the end of the month the bills must correspond with these 
order lists. In this way she can personally control the expenditures 
in her household. 

There are two vital facts which every efficient housekeeper must 
know: The quantity of each variety of food necessary comfortably to 
supply her family, and its cost. A careful housekeeper will add the 
amounts of sugar, rice, etc., used for three months or more, divid 
the result by the number of months and arrive at an average. In this 
way she may prepare a list of groceries, canned fruits, canned vege- 
tables, etc., to be purchased at the beginning of every month. If she 
entertains many guests the amounts will vary, but she has a good 
working basis. There are several grades of most foods differing in 
price, and they should be tried and the particular quality to be used 
decided. The second vital fact, the price, is easily learned. Food 
prices vary from season to season, and all tradesmen will supply a 
list if required, most of them keeping printed forms for this purpose. 
A price list for the coming month should be sent with each month's 
bills. 

These are the methods of carefully counting the cost in little things 
which men use in successful business. 

At the beginning of each month's menus in this book will be found 
a list of meats, vegetables, etc., to which the current prices are to be 
added. At the end of each month's menus is a table of wages paid, 
with a line for the total amount, also spaces indicated for the house- 
keeping bills, with a line for the total amount, so that the responsible 
person may know at a glance just how much has been spent during 
the past month and for what. 

Is this not more satisfactory than having bills come in which one 
does not feel quite sure are correct, or finding them higher than ex- 
pected without knowing that the prices of many foods have advanced 
with the winter season? It can easily be understood that the daily 
orders with which the monthly bills are to be compared must have 
been written by the responsible person with her own hand if she is to 
be able to state positively what is correct in the bills received and what 
may be an error.

Preface 

These household menus do not include chicken, game, or the choicer 
cuts of beef, all of which are expensive and of no greater nutritive 
value than the meats selected. They are prepared with the idea that 
it is as easy to buy exactly the quantity of food required to serve a 
given number as to buy a large quantity and use it several times until 
it is finished. These quantities may be increased or decreased in pro- 
portion for a greater or smaller number to be served. Careful con- 
sideration of just what will be required to prepare the menus for 
household and dining-room is a task requiring care and intelligence. 
It is gratifying to find how capably and with what interest a cook will 
plan these order lists when once they are understood. 

Above the luncheon and dinner menus are spaces for the names of 
guests. If the same guests are entertained frequently it is convenient 
to know the menus served to them so that they may be varied. 

I have found in the International Cook Book, a most useful guide 
in planning menus, whether simple or elaborate. It is compiled by 
Filippini, the noted chef of Delmonico's, and its three thousand re- 
cipes are arranged in menus for every day of the year with a discern- 
ment worthy of this culinary artist. 

The young housekeeper may find the following suggestions useful: 

It is well to use an ink pencil or fountain pen in writing these menus 
and order lists, as the book is to be in constant use for a year and lead 
pencil marks rub and become blurred. 

It is economical to buy a side of lamb every Saturday morning at 
the wholesale price and have it cut up by the butcher, who will keep 
it in his cold room for several days, if necessary, until needed. The 
leg and shoulder are used for the servants' Sunday and Tuesday 
dinners. The nine French chops and loin roast, from which four or 
five long strips may be carved, may be used in the dining-room. Chops 
bought separately cost much more per pound. 

The art of creating new and tempting dishes from the food remaining 
from the family table is worthy of the careful consideration of every 
woman. The remains of roast chicken may be used as a curry with 
rice and chutney, served in aspic jelly with a salad, with mushrooms 
in Swedish timbales, or as hashed chicken with a poached egg for 
breakfast. Endless variety may be given the family table if a little 
thought is expended upon what is so important a part of daily life. 

The household menus are so arranged that if it is necessary to make 
use of portions of food left from the dining-room the household order 



Preface 

may be omitted and the other foods substituted, but it is usually 
quite practicable so to plan the menus that the dining-room and 
kitchen menus do not conflict. 

The household menus call for bread and butter with breakfast. 
The hot bread used in the dining-room is to be prepajed immediately 
before the family breakfast, so that it may be light and fresh. A 
sufficient quantity is to be baked to include the amount required for 
the kitchen supper, for which it is to be reheated, thus assuring to the 
servants' table the same variety enjoyed in the dining-room with very 
little effort on the part of the cook. Milk toast, hot cakes, and pop- 
overs must be freshly made for supper. 

The cereals are to be cooked in a double boiler for several hours 
the day before they are to be used and serve the household and dining- 
room tables. The quantity needed can only be learned by experience, 
as all do not enjoy this course at breakfast. An average amount for 
six persons in the kitchen is one third of a pound. Corn meal is listed 
among the cereals, as it is very nutritious, and, if cooked for several 
hours the day before with three cups of water and a teaspoonful of 
salt to one cup of corn meal, instead of the usual two cups to one of a 
cereal, it is a delicious breakfast food. Hot milk is served with the 
kitchen coffee and cold milk with the cereals. The milk at the top of 
the bottle contains cream and is used with cereals or desserts. 

The following is a list of the quantities of fish, meats, vegetables 
and fruits required for six persons in the household menus : 

For breakfast, eight eggs and three quarters of a pound of bacon. 
The number of eggs needed varies with different households and 
must be determined by experience. One and one half pounds of 
corned beef for hash, two pounds of sausage, six snappers, one and 
one half pounds of shredded cod fish for cod fish balls, a two-pound 
flounder. It is economical to buy the entire flounder, not the filet. 
In summer the Sunday sausage is replaced by scrambled eggs and 
bacon. 

Quantities of meats and fish required for six persons for dinner and 
supper in these menus, which repeat after three weeks:

tration, is a list of prices of the foods required in the household menus

May I repeat that these prices are only approximate, as the cost

and according to the quality of food selected. 

These calculations do not include spices, salt, baking powder, etc., 
as they are used in such small quantities. 

The woman is happy who finds housekeeping interesting and home- 
making a joy. If this book serves in the smallest degree in establishing 
a simple, useful, practical method of housekeeping for American 
women, if it aids them in discharging their household duties more 
easily, quickly, and efficiently, if it liberates their energies so that 
they may enter into and enjoy the other varied interests which offer 
such opportunities for self-development and human service for the 
modern woman, it will have fulfilled its highest destiny.

i^reface 



This is a book for every woman. Its object is to save time for the 
busy woman and to solve problems for the young housewife. It is a 
simple plan for business administration in the household. It makes 
it possible for every woman, whether her income be large or small, to 
keep the daily expenses under her personal control and to state 
clearly, at the end of each month, how much money she has spent and 
for what. 

Good administration is as valuable in the home, where the family 
income is spent, as in business, where the family income is made. 

As compared with English, French, German and Italian households, 
there is much unnecessary waste in American homes. Money has 
been acquired with comparative ease, and, in many cases, is carelessly 
spent. It is a satisfaction to any woman to feel that the trust imposed 
upon her by her husband, whose income she spends, is borne faithfully, 
intelligently and well. This book is written to aid every woman to 
arrive at this state of mind easily. It is a short cut towards efficiency. 
It is meant to give to American husbands a square deal. 

The efficient housewife must understand her profession. No man 
could hope to succeed in business who is ignorant of its details. The 
beginner gives his best thought to understanding what is required to 
assure success. Housekeeping is woman's business and to succeed 
she must pursue business methods. 

The most important fact for a business man to know is what capital 
he has and what income he can afiford to spend. This knowledge his 
wife has a right to share. Every woman is as vitally interested in her 
husband's future as he. If she has the intelligence to spend money 
wisely she has the wisdom to save money intelligently. A man's wife 
should be his business partner. This is a fact which few American 
men are willing to admit. They supply their wives with money in the 
most generous fashion, but they rarely give them their business con- 
fidence. American wives seldom know the amount of their husband's 
capital or income and so lose the great opportunity for self-de\'elop- 



preface 

ment which the feeling of responsibility for the mutual good would 
produce. The extravagance of many women is the direct result of 
this lack of understanding and responsibility and is fundamentally 
the fault of American men. Every woman is entftled to understand 
her husband's business prospects, which are also hers, and to have at 
her disposal a regular monthly allowance with the understanding that 
her part in the family partnership is to spend money wisely and to 
keep within her income. The women whom I have known who have 
enjoyed such a frank business relationship with their husbands have 
responded loyally and intelligently to such responsibility. I believe 
that all women would do so. 

Household management in America seems to be in an unsettled 
state. 

An English household is carefully adjusted, from the housekeeper, 
butler, and lady's maid, who are called "upper servants" and have 
special privileges, to the scullery maid, who stands abashed in the 
presence of these exalted personages and calls them "Miss" and 
"Mister." What food and drink are served in the servants' hall is a 
thing of long usage and its simple wholesomeness is never questioned. 

French women are noted for their efficient management of the 
family income, perhaps partially due to the fact that every woman 
who marries is possessed of a "dot" and therefore is spending her 
own money as well as her husband's. The French have taught us 
the delight of a thoughtfully chosen, perfectly cooked dinner, but 
we have yet to learn from them the thrift and skill in utilizing little 
things which is one of their most admirable characteristics. 

In Germany the "haus frau" takes the care of her servants seri- 
ously and deserves the reputation which she has won for efficiency. 
It requires a clear head as w-ell as a generous heart to provide for her 
household. German servants enjoy ii\'e inexpensive meals a day: 
coffee and rolls at seven; bread, cheese or sausage and beer at eleven; 
the food remaining after the family dinner at- two, usually served as a 
stew of meat and vegetables, which is their most hearty meal of the 
day; bread and coffee at four; and at eight or later the food remaining 
from the family supper. German women are thoroughly trained in 
all pertaining to the household and look upon their capable manage- 
ment as a duty which they owe to the family fortunes. 

The Italian method of conducting domestic affairs is the fine art of 
avoiding unnecessary effort. The butler and maid prepare the simple 



Preface 

breakfast of coffee, rolls, and butter, and carry the trays to the family 
bedrooms. At ten o'clock the chef arrives, having bought and paid 
for all that he requires for the day for the designated number of per- 
sons to be served at luncheon and dinner. At ten p. M. he presents 
his menus for the following day, with his account of what he has spent 
for the luncheon and dinner just served. Everything is bought in the 
small quantities required for the dishes selected, and when he leaves 
at night his kitchen is empty; all that remains to remind one of his 
skill is a tall earthen jar filled with olive oil from which he dips what 
he needs and which never turns rancid. The butler buys the flowers, 
fruits, and what is required for breakfast, and presents his statement 
every morning. All is done easily, efficiently and graciously, every- 
thing is paid for every day, and the Italian mistress of the household 
knows, with no eftort, just how much she is spending and for what. 
This is the perfection of household efficiency. 

In America enormous fortunes ha\'e been made in dizzy haste. Per- 
sons of simple tastes and surrounding? suddenly find themselves multi- 
millionaires with a palace and a retinue of servants who appear to 
know much more about managing a household than they do. They 
take the course of least resistance and allow their servants to manage 
them, while they uncomplainingly pay the bills. The result is unfair 
to the servants, who, if they grow unruly under such lax management, 
as is apt to be the case, are totally unfitted for a less extravagant 
household. They lose all sense of money \'alue and personal respon- 
sibility. 

Many American women who ha\'e had every advantage which 
wealth, culture, and travel can give, take upon themselves the re- 
sponsibilities of a household with no preliminary experience or train- 
ing. They have not enjoyed the benefit of the generations of common- 
sense customs of the English women, the carefully enlightened thrift 
of the French' women, the well drilled routine of the German women, 
or the intelligent facility which the centuries have cultivated in the 
Italian women. Every household is a law unto itself, from those in 
which all the ordering is left to extravagant servants and the bills 
unquestioningly paid, to those in which insufficient attention is given 
to the servants' food and comfort, and there is constant dissatisfaction 
and change. We all know homes which answer to each of these 
descriptions as well as the charming, well-ordered American homes 
whose sunny atmosphere is an instant assurance that here dwell kind- 



preface 

ness, order, and a just attention to the comfort and well-being of 
all. The result of this inequality of domestic arrangement is uni- 
versal confusion. Nothing is finally settled, as in the European 
countries mentioned, where generations of one family have lived in the 
same environment according to the same traditions, and the simple 
but wholesome arrangements made for the servants are never ques- 
tioned. There is a stability and restfulness about such well-ordered 
households which Americans residing there find very grateful. Amer- 
ican homes will only arrive at this perfection of organization with its 
consequent atmosphere of repose when American women unite upon 
a wise, simple, effective plan of domestic management which is con- 
sidered representative of American women as a nation. 

A descriptive word readily associates itself in one's mind with 
women of the nationalities mentioned — English common-sense, 
French thrift, German organization, Italian facility. There is no 
such word which is universally accepted as descriptive of American 
women. They are considered charming, witty, adaptable, clever, but 
they are never spoken of as wise and thrifty managers of household 
expenses, and the carelessness with which they spend money has 
become proverbial. 

Are American women content to rest under this stigma? Many do 
not deserve it, but it is applied to all. 

Has not the moment arrived when we must accept our responsi- 
bilities seriously and crystallize our national tendencies into a national 
character, in which our women, as a nation, are worthy of the fine 
achievement of our men, as a nation? 

American men lead the world in capable business administration- 
Their minds have grasped and successfully solved such gigantic prob- 
lems that they have elevated the word ''business" to a level with the 
most honored professions. Why should American women not emulate 
American men? Why should we not be honored as they are, for the 
intelligent business administration of our homes, until we are known, 
not as extravagant spenders, but as efficient organizers and admin- 
istrators of our households? 

Household efl&ciency depends upon a carefully planned daily rou- 
tine. The responsible person should know how much she can spend 
per month. This will determine the number of servants employed 
and the style of living. Her two chief sources of outlay will be ser- 
vants' wages and the food supply for her household. It is in the cul- 



Preface 

inary department that the efficient housewife proves her value. Trie 
intelligent buying of food is a science, its arrangement in attractive 
and varied form is an art. 

The plan of housekeeping here given has been used by the writer 
for many years. It is because several of her friends have asked for a 
copy and used it successfully that she is encouraged to share it with 
the public. It is easy to understand and to follow. Its success de- 
pends upon the thing necessary to produce success in every business, 
the faithful performance of a daily duty. The duty is simple and 
requires only ten or fifteen minutes of time, but the responsible 
person should not delegate it to others. 

At the head of each calendar day in this book are menus for the 
household dinner and supper and breakfast for the following day. 
The breakfast is j^laced last because the daily orders are to be written 
each morning and include the food to be purchased for the three meals 
following. 

These menus are prepared for the use of persons of widely differing 
incomes. They are nutritious, economical, and of a pleasing variety. 
They repeat after three weeks and include the fish, vegetables, and 
fruits in season in different months of the year. Any family whose 
income is limited will lind them nourishing and attractive and they 
are suitable for growing children. 

In families where few servants are employed it is convenient to 
give them what remains after the family meals have been served. 
In such a household the food is simple and there is comparatively- 
little entertaining. 

In a more complex household, where the servants are more numerous 
and frequently prepare and serve luncheons and dinners of several 
courses, it is well to give them their meals before they are called upon 
to perform these duties. In many houses the servants breakfast at 
seven, dine at twelve, and have their supper at half-past five, and their 
meals are cooked separately. These menus are also intended for use 
in such households, the responsible person writing in the spaces in- 
dicated on the opposite page the menus for her family table for lunch- 
eon, dinner, and breakfast for the following day. 

Below the household menu is an order list with spaces headed, 
'"meats," "vegetables," "groceries," etc. The daily duty to be per- 
formed by the responsible person is this: She writes in the spaces 
indicated what food she wishes to have served at her table, with the 



Preface 

number to be provided for written above. The cook looks over these 
and the household menus and states how much meat, fish, butter, 
eggs, groceries, etc., will be required to prepare the coming meals, and 
the responsible person writes the quantity of each in the allotted 
.pace. At the end of the month the bills must correspond with these 
order lists. In this way she can personally control the expenditures 
in her household. 

There are two vital facts which e^•ery efficient housekeeper must 
know: The quantity of each variety of food necessary comfortably to 
supply her family, and its cost. A careful housekeeper will add the 
amounts of sugar, rice, etc., used for three months or more, divide 
the result by the number of months and arrive at an average. In this 
way she may prepare a list of groceries, canned fruits, canned vege- 
tables, etc., to be purchased at the beginning of every month. If she 
entertains many guests the amounts will vary, but she has a good 
working basis. There are se\'eral grades of most foods differing in 
price, and they should be tried and the particular quality to be used 
decided. The second vital fact, the price, is easily learned. Food 
prices vary from season to season, and all tradesmen will supph' a 
list if rec[uired, most of them keeping printed forms for this purpose. 
A price list for the coming month should be sent with each month's 
bills. 

These are the methods of carefully counting the cost in little things 
which men use in successful business. 

At the beginning of each month's menus in this book will be found 
a list of meats, vegetables, etc., to which the current prices are to be 
added. At the end of each month's menus is a table of wages paid,, 
with a line for the total amount, also spaces indicated for the house- 
keeping bills, with a line for the total amount, so that the responsible 
person may know at a glance just how much has been spent during 
the past month and for what. 

Is this not more satisfactory than ha\ing bills come in which one 
does not feel cjuite sure are correct, or finding them higher than ex- 
pected without knowing that the prices of many foods have advanced 
with the winter season? It can easily be understood that the daily 
orders with which the monthly bills are to be compared must have 
been written by the responsible person with her own hand if she is to 
be able to state positively what is correct in the bills received and what 
may be an error. 



Preface 

These household menus do not include chicken, game, or the choicer 
cuts of beef, all of which are expensi^■e and of no greater nutritive 
value than the meats selected. They are prepared with the idea that 
it is as easy to buy exactly the cjuantity of food recjuired to serve a 
given number as to buy a large cjuantity and use it several times until 
it is finished. These quantities may be increased or decreased in pro- 
portion for a greater or smaller number to be served. Careful con- 
sideration of just what will be required to prepare the menus for 
household and dining-room is a task requiring care and intelligence. 
It is gratifying to find how capably and with what interest a cook will 
plan these order lists when once they are understood. 

Above the luncheon and dinner menus are spaces for the names of 
guests. If the same guests are entertained frequently it is convenient 
to know the menus served to them so that they may be varied. 

I have found in the International Cook Book, a most useful guide 
in planning menus, whether simple or elaborate. It is compiled by 
Filippini, the noted chef of Delmonico's, and its three thousand re- 
cipes are arranged in menus for every day of the year with a discern- 
ment w^orthy of this culinary artist. 

The young housekeeper may find the following suggestions useful: 

It is well to use an ink pencil or fountain pen in writing these menus 
and order lists, as the book is to be in constant use for a year and lead 
pencil marks rub and become blurred. 

It is economical to buy a side of lamb every Saturday morning at 
the wholesale price and have it cut up by the butcher, who will keep 
it in his cold room for several days, if necessary, until needed. The 
leg and shoulder are used for the servants' Sunday and Tuesday 
dinners. The nine French chops and loin roast, from which four or 
five long strips may be carved, may be used in the dining-room. Chops 
bought separately cost much more per pound. 

The art of creating new and tempting dishes from the food remaining 
from the family table is worthy of the careful consideration of every 
woman. The remains of roast chicken may be used as a curry with 
rice and chutney, served in aspic jelly with a salad, with mushrooms 
in Swedish timba'es, or as hashed chicken with a poached egg for 
breakfast. Endless variety may be given the family table if a little 
thought is expended upon what is so important a part of daily life. 

The household menus are so arranged that if it is necessary to make 
use of portions of food left from the dining-room the household order 



preface 

may be omitted and the other foods substituted, but it is usually 
quite practicable so to plan the menus that the dining-room and 
kitchen menus do not conflict. 

The household menus call for bread and butter with breakfast. 
The hot bread used in the dining-room is to be prepared immediately 
before the family breakfast, so that it may be light and fresh. A 
sufhcient quantity is to be baked to include the amount required for 
the kitchen supper, for which it is to be reheated, thus assuring to the 
ser\-ants' table the same \-ariety enjoyed in the dining-room with very 
little effort on the part of the cook. Milk toast, hot cakes, and pop- 
overs must be freshly made for supper. 

The cereals are to be cooked in a double boiler for several hours 
the day before the}- are to be used and serve the household and dining- 
room tables. The quantity needed can only be learned by experience, 
as all do not enjoy this course at breakfast. An average amount for 
six persons in the kitchen is one third of a pound. Corn meal is listed 
among the cereals, as it is very nutritious, and, if cooked for several 
hours the day before with three cups of water and a teaspoonful of 
salt to one cup of corn meal, instead of the usual two cups to one of a 
cereal, it is a delicious breakfast food. Hot milk is served with the 
kitchen coffee and cold milk with the cereals. The milk at the top of 
the bottle contains cream and is used with cereals or desserts. 

The following is a list of the quantities of fish, meats, vegetables 
and fruits required for six persons in the household menus: 

For breakfast, eight eggs and three quarters of a pound of bacon. 
The number of eggs needed \aries with difi'erent households and 
must be determined by experience. One and one half pounds of 
corned beef for hash, two pounds of sausage, six snappers, one and 
one half pounds of shredded cod fish for cod fish balls, a two-pound 
flounder. It is economical to buy the entire flounder, not the filet. 
In summer the SuncUn' sausage is replaced by scrambled eggs and 
])acon. 

Quantities of meats and fish required for six persons for dinner and 
suj>iH'r in these menus, which repeat after three weeks:

Dried apples — f lb. Macaroni — ^ package 

Dried Apricots — f lb. Cheese with Crackers — ^ lb. 

E\ery kitchen should be supplied with a reliable scales, and meat 
and other foods should be weighed occasionally. 

It is a simple thing to calculate household expenses if the quantities 
re([uired and prices paid are known. The following, by way of illus- 
tration, is a list of prices of the foods recjuired in the household menus 
for the first week in January, for six persons.

This is an average of 63c. a day per person. 

May I repeat that these prices are only approximate, as the cost 
of food varies greatly in different localities and at different seasons 
and according to the quality of food selected. 

These calculations do not include spices, salt, baking powder, etc., 
as they are used in such small quantities. 

The woman is happy who finds housekeeping interesting and home- 
making a joy. If this book serves in the smallest degree in establishing 
a simple, useful, practical method of housekeeping for American 
women, if it aids them in discharging their household duties more 
easily, quickly, and efficiently, if it liberates their energies so that 
they may enter into and enjoy the other varied interests which offer 
such opportunities for self-development and human service for the 
modern woman, it wall have fulfilled its highest destiny.
