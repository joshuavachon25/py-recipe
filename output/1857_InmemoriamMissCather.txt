Thk following Testimonials to the Christian charabtcr and 
usefulness of Miss Oatherink Brown were tailed forth at the 
time of her sudden death, while in the midst of her usefulness. 
They have been collected in this form at the request of many 
affectionate friends who wished to have some memorial ol 
her. It is earnestly hoped, that the consistent character and 
devoted piety which the gracious Spirit of God enable^ the 
lamented deceased to .maintain during, life, will have its 
influence on some who may peruse the following pages, and 
that even by her death fresh fruit of her labours may Ih' 
found, in bringing glory to that Saviour whom it was her 
delight to serve while on earth.

F/o»j //,« (f r«?) PrMyterian Mivtionarij Record. 
AVe have never liad\ to record the death of one 
not officially connected with the Church, whose re- 
moval has occasioned! HO' preat a blank, or who 
has been so generally laniented as the late Miss 
Krown. The suddennesk of her removal, also has 
invested it with peculiar! interest. It was sudden 
even for death by accident ; a blow on the forehead 
and cheek seems to hav^ stunned her ; she fell 
and the water rushing into the carriage, strangle(i 
her while yet unconscious. The passage from earth 
to heaven was instan^taneoi^s, probably without one 
pang or fear. 

Miss Brown was born in Scotland ; she was se- 
cond daughter of Mr. Peter Brown, and sister of 
ATr. George Brown, M.P.P., came with the rest 
ot her father's family to this continent, and after 
residing for some years in New York, removed 
to Toronto in 1844. It is, of cburse, of the latter 
part ot her life only that we are led to speak. For 
about twelve years she was associated with her- 
sisters in conducting a select school for the edu- 
cation of young ladies. Her zeal as a teacher was 
only equalled by her success. While making the

tlioroiijj;Ii gTouiiding; and adyanccineiit of lier pupilK 
in all useful knowledge, one object, Bliewaseciually 
bent on educating tlie lieart, cultivatfeg tlie affec- 
tions, and bringing thcRoul to the foot of the croHs. 
Her affectionate addresses, her prayers, her private 
conversatioifs, and her faithful letters will live for 
ever in the hearts of those who were privileged to 
enjoy them. From the time that a Sabbath*ochool 
was first, formed in ednnection with Knox's Church, 
she had a class there. Latterly, it was a numerous 
class of advanced pupils, many of whom came from 
other churches to wait upon her instructions. Into 
this work her M'holc soul was thrown, and we know 
that in many instances her labours were crowned 
with marked spiritual fruit. Besides these more 
ordinary labours, she was a a regular visitor and 
tract distributor in a poor district of the city ; and 
it has been our privilege to be led by her to the bed 
of the dying, and to hear from their lips, as well as 
from those of many afflicted ones, a gratefiil testi- 
mony borne to the self-denying kindness, unosten- 
tatious liberality, and Christian .consideration with 
which she ministered both to their temporal and spirit- 
ual necessities. Besides the branch of the Church 
to Avhich she immediately belonged,- every institu- 
tion of a religious and philanthropic nature, shared 
her attention, and was earnestly advocated by her. 
Thus, by her many labours of love, she held a high 
place in the esteem and affection of the community, 
and of this, the very large assemblage from every 
rank, and every religious denomination, which at- 
tended her obsequies, was certain evidence. 

Miss Brown did not allow her public engagements

Ut iiitcrforc witli private or domestic duties Wliile 
nseful III society, she was a dutiful daui^hter and 
devoted sister. She ever t^ied to make home 
happy, and with pains-taking care, never omitted 
tlie Hiiurtl offices of kindness on which lioniestic 
happiness so much depends. Hej. friendship was 
highly prized by her more familiar friends A 
sprightly, b«t genial disposition, unaffected kind- 
ness, genuine sympathy, uncommon intellectual 
vigour and sterling worth, mode her society alike 
pleasing and profitable. 
But religionabovc all distinguished her : it directs 
^ her talents, and made her what she was. 
Her religion was deep, intelligent, earnest, and 
somewhat, though not peculiarly, emotional. Pos- 
sessed of great natural conscientiousness, duty 
was her delight ; knd fervent love to her Redeemer 
led her to lay herself out for his service. She mani- 
fested a wholejlome indifference for the follies of 
tashionable society, and pursued th6 nobler objects of 
life which she had setbefoi-eher— namely, tlie glory 
o| (xod and the good of men,— with unfaltering d^ 
cision, fixedness of purpose, and untiring energy 
Uuring a painful illness last summer, her Christian 
character matured very rapidly. In a season of 
great bodily weakness, her soul was mightily as- 
sailed, and she passed through one of those fiery 
trials which often overtake many of God's eminen't 
servants. Deep waters passed over her in a nijrht 
ot gloom when God's face was hid. In these few 
weeks she tasted as much of the Refiner's fire as 
IS spread in most cases over an experience of many 
years. She came forth purified. The ima.>e of her 



*3aviour shoiic forth lattemy with, even a purer, 
clearer lustre. The last fe\^ weeks of her life were 
BDent in labours more abundant, and in laying 
plans for exteiisive futur j usefulnesH. With a 
mind serene aim peaceful, 1 ving in the land of Beu- 
lah, she rejoiced with jojl unspeakable and full 
of glory, and to one of her Nearest friends, she said 
a few days before she w^s called away, " Re- 
joice with me now, as you have wept with me, for 
I am full of joy. I am like a little child lying in 
the bosom of my Saviour." lu a word, Miss Brown 
was a true woman, for whom nature had done 
much, and grace more ; whose inner life was a life 
of faith, and her outward life, the fruits of the Spirit. 
We have referred to her engagement* as a teach- 
er of youthj and also her labours in connection with 
a Bible class. It may be interesting to notice that, 
ere her sudden removal, she had completed her ar- 
rangements for withdrawing from the. school with 
which she had been for many years connected. This 
was considered advisable in consequencd*of her ill- 
ness during the past summer. Her Sabbath class 
was also provided for, having been, until her health 
should be re-established, committed to the charge 
of a lady in every respect competent, and in whom 
^[is8 Brown had the fullest confidence. , Thus, un- 
consciously, her house was set in birder : and, wfiieu 
the message was broughtr— " come up hither," she 
had nothing to do but obey. Her wDrk on earth 
was endedr- every arrangement was completed, so 
that, notwithstanding her very sudden call, there 
we 8 no confusion or derangement in any matter 
with which she was connected.

Prom the Toronto Tima. ^ '* 

Our last issue contained the sad tidings of 
the death of Miss Catherine Brown, by the late 
accident on the New York Central Kailn.adii.*enr 
.Syracuse, on the 15th instant. Miss Brown was 
second daughter of Mr. Peter Brown of Toronto 
and sister of Mr. George Brown, M. P.P. She had 
lately recovered from a severe illness, and was on 
her way to pay a visit, in company with her aged 
father, to relatives in New York, when the fatal 
accident occurred, cuttinglier down in the prime 
ot life, and in° the midst of her usefulness. The 
interest taken by the deceased in the charitable 
institutions of the City, her unremitting laKiurs 
tor the poor and the distressed of every class iir^a 
more private way, her great worth, m well as th** 
melancholy cir^^umstances attending her death, all 
point her out ^s one justbe elaiiijing a somewhat 
extended obituaij notice. jpH^ 

Miss Brown's mind, niiiwallv of a high order 
was richly cultivated and stortnl with large and 
varied information; and thu^ she invariablv im- 
pressed those who enjoyed her society with an 
exalted sense of female intellect, and, this not

We would not intrude iipon the sacred sancti- 
ties of Home, else could we speak of the deep- 
gushing aftection which so strongly knit her heart 
to dear relatives and friends — of that generous and 
ever cheerful digposition which made her the idol 
of every family meeting, and around whom, as an 
attracting centre, all loved to gather and hold 
social converse. In whatever relation we regard 
her, whether as a daughter, a sister, a teacher, or a 
friend. Miss Catherine Brown was a nrtble Christian 
woman, and her lif<^-unhappily too short— is tittej 
to teach important lesgons. 

From the Toronto Globe, 20th October. '' 

" Yesterday afternoon the remains of Miss Gather 
rine Brown were borne to the tomb by a numeroii^ 
company of sorrowing relatives and friends. In^ 
timately known to a wide social circle ; and, foi^ 
years past, an earnest labourer in every cause of 
charity and benevolence, the sad circumstances of 
her death excited a degree of feeling rarely wit- 
nessed. From the arrival of the remains in To^ 
ronto to the hour of interment, her bier was sur- 
rounded by weeping friends, who had known and 
loved her, and by persons who had profited by her 
counsels, and who claimed one last look. < 

Few person's possess the vigorous intellect, the 
energy of character, the firmness of purpose, 
coupled with winning gentleness, and the fervent 
piety displayed by Oftth^rine Brown. In opposi-

notwithstanding, to be a daily visitor at the bed- 
side of the sick and the dying, and the ever-ready 
counsellor of tlie poor and distressed. She was a 
noble Christian woman, and many are then; who 
will ever bless her as the kiui|yn8tructres8 who 
led their thoughts to things etlQIl- 

Miss Brown was in the very vigour of life, and 
to till appearance had a long terra of usefulness 
befove her. Completely recovered from a painful 
illness, she was proceeding with her father to pay 
a long-promised visit to relatives in New York, 
when the sad Railway accident at Syracuse sud- 
denly t^^rminated her earthly career.

From the Montreal Argm. 

We learn with deep rejfret throuji^h a private let- 
ter from Toronto, that a sad accident liappened 
on Thursday, on the New York Central Railway, 
by which Miss Brown, a sister of Gcorj^e Brown,' 
Esq., M. P. P., a lady of high accomplishments,' 
beloved by all her family, and admired by all who 
had the happiness of her acquaintance, lost her 
life. 



From the Barric 'Advance. 
We regret to learn that Miss Brown met with a 
sudden death by the late accident on the New York 
Central Railroad. This unexpected and painful 
bereavement to her relatives and acquaintances is, 
however, much sweetened with an assurance of her 
being prepared to meet the summons of her God. 
She was an exemplary, pious young lady 
agreeably and unassuming in her ,deportment' 
and a helper of the distressed and afflicted' 
The church, and even the world, could badly 
bear the loss; but it was the will of Heaven, 
whose mysterious purposes we can scarcely coln- 
prehend, and He, who " doeth all things well " 
may have taken her as a " guiding star" to those 
who should follow in her track.

road, by whifirMi«ji Brown, siriter of Mr. George 
Untwn, luid been killed, and Ui: Peter Brown, his 
fatlier, dangerounly linrt. Tlie latter piece of intel- 
ligence! proved afterwards t»» bo somewhat exag- 
gerated, but th<> death of Miss Hrowh was (sonfirni- 
ed, to the griefof a wide circle of Christian frietfds 
by whom she was most highly esteemed for her 
many virtues. 



^ From tite Brampton Timcu. 

The remains of Miss Brown were brought to To- 
ronto on Saturday night, and buried on Monday, 
when a vast jiuniber of mourners attended. No 
individual could be missed more by the benevolent^ 
institutions of Toronto than this lady of good 
worky. She taught for the purpose of increasing 
her means, so as to clothe the naked, to feed the 
hungry and t6 spread tlic light of the gospel, 
hyery day that she could spare Was spent in vis- 
iting the afflicted, persuading the thoughtlpss, en- 
couraging the repentant, and ii^ soliciting sub- 
scriptions to carry on iiiore exterisively her labonrs 
of love amJ charity. Few could 'refuse responding 
to her appeals, so earnest were her pleadings, and 
captivating her manners. Never was there a 
wonian more adapted for the Christian missionary's 
work than she. How many hundreds of the poor 
and needy in Toronto will depW)re the loss of Miss

the duuf^htcr thus sirddoiily called away, with nii- 
inen)H8 relatives, will .derive p^reat comfort, uuddr 
tlieir heavy affliction, from the fact that the departed 
was a sincere Christian, ever zealous in hef Master's 
cause. 



From Ifie Berlin Telegrnph. 

Miss Brown was a lady who,by her many amiable 
qualities, but especially her general Christian de- 
portment, was esteemed by all who had the pleasure 
of her acquaintance. Her sudden death will be 
felt as a severe blow to her relatives and numer- 
ous friends, by whom she was beloved, but especi- 
ally by her aged father, to whom she was strongly 
attached, which afforded him a source of pleasure 
jjnd comfort in his declining years, that' nonp but 
an affectionate parent can properly appreciate. 
The relatives of the deceased have our heart- 
felt sympathies for the irreparable breach whicli 
this accident "lias made in their family circle, and 
"the deep s(»rrow into which they have been so sud- 
denly plunged.' 



From the Cobourg Sun. 

Miss Brown's funeral took place on Monday in 
Toronto, It was attended by the largest concourse 
of people ever witnessed in Toronto on a similar oc- 
casion. The deceased was deservedly esteemed 
for her kindness and unostentatious piety.

"The teachei's of this l^abbatli School acknowledge 
the hand of Almighty God in the painful dispensa-

services of Miss Brown, as teacher of .the senior fe- 
male class. Thej' cannot but recall the long and 
able services rendered by her in this department, 
ever since the forniation of the present congregation ; 
and the devotion and ea(^nc8t^ess for which she was 
so distinguished in other ll^ldp of usefulness, were 
no less shown in this department of duty, and, tohei* 
a labour of love.

" The teaclieiH feel that in the event which has ta- 
ken place, the Sabbath School }iaH suffered a loss of 
no ondinar^ magnitude. Her presence from time to 
time at the meetings of4iic teachers for the st'Udy of 
the lessons, and for the general interests of the school, 
> gave" ample proof how deeply she felt the weight of 
the solemn work in which she was engag\jd, and the 
zeal displayed by her during the maiiy years of lier 
connexion with it, brought out, in bold relief*those 
traits of charactc£-4ec which she was so eminent. 
Rarely has it fallen to the lot of any Suntiay School, 
to h4ye enjoyed for so many years, the services of 
one 80 full of that Christian spirit which kindles as 
it proceeds, and gains liew strength as i^ contem- 
plates the high and holy work of being engaged in 
^he service of Christ, and advancing the cause . of 
the Divine Redeemer, in connexion with the inter- 
ests of the young. That she was eminently^fitted- 
for this holy work, nont; can doubt who knew her ; 
and the everrness of her temper, the gentleness of^ 
her spirit^ and Christian meekness, these increasing 
in strength day by day, like a steady light, attract- 
ed around her for Sabbath instruction, a nimiber who 
wdre not connected with the congregation, but who 
valued her instruction for hter own^ake, aiid her 
Christian example. Her own elass, over which she 
watched with unceasing care, and whoso spiritual 
interests were uppermost in luer thoughts, are de^ 
prived of an affectionate teacher and faithful guide ; 
and it is not too much to expectthat ihe seed sown 
for so many years, with earnest prayer for its 
ripening, will produce, by God's blessing, saving 
results intiie converHion of not a few w)io wore the

Oone from amongst ns ! In her narrow home 
Sa*lly we laid all of her tha^could die ; 
And scarcely deemed we in thai boor o^woe, 
A Father's voice had called hcr\o the sky. 
Xo slow disease had preyed upon |ier frame. 
Years had nojb sprinkled jret herhe^ with grey ; 
Hope, clinging yet to what we wished might be, 
Picturdd ber;here fgr many a fotute day. 
Yet her hoar came. Tli^ bow diTJnely bent. 
Winged the death-arrowto hey ransomed breast ; 
With scarce a sigh or straggle, het freed soul. 
Without one pang of parting, entered rest. 
* Fondly we might have wished that; thoM dear lips 
Had spoken fikrewella, or percbaoo^ had smiled. 
But this to one so loving and beloved, 
A Father's tender mercy spared hit child. 
Death, by her SaViourVdeath bereft of sting, 
CVme— though with terrors— not with long alarms : 
And, as a messenger a vanquished foe, 
Bore her from earth into l^r Father's arms. 
Made meet for glory. Could unerring love 
. Withhold the guerdon when the fight was won, 
Or for our comfort in this " vale of tears," 
Keep her.a moment when her work was done ? 
. ' Tis hers to triumph^ and thou^ ours to weep, 
We chide the wish that would havgkept her here 
To toil and suffer in tJiis world of sin, 
Far from her promised rest in yonder sphere.

A voice beyond the eepnlcbre declares : 
" Blest are the dead who slumber in the Lord." 
She is with Je8n8,~and that crown of Life, 
The hope of which made all her labonra s^t 
That blood-bonght crown, the gift of Jemw' love, 
With joyful praise she casts at Jesns' feet. 
Temptations vex no more ; no care can grieve ; 
Within the mansions of that world of light

' But as a vision of a dreary night. 

Into oblivion's shade long passed away, 
Before the snn^ine of an endless day. 

Gone from amongst ns 1 Not in hopeless grief, 
Gently we laid her in her narrow bed. 
mere, with returning Spring shall violets blow, 
Like Resurrection hopes above her head,—
