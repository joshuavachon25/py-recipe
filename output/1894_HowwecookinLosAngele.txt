Good cooks always use the best 
materials in preparing food. 

It is of still greater importance 
that your medicines should consist 
of the purest drugs. 

We devote ourselves mainly to the pre- 
scription trade, and in this department are used 
only chemicals and parmaceutical preparations 
from the best manufacturers, both foreign and 
American. It is with confidence that I invite 
the public to have their prescriptions prepared 
at my store. Purity and accuracy is my motto.

PREFACE 

THE Publishers of this book, firmly believing that it 
is no more expensive to furnish a table with food 
which is well and appetizingly prepared, than it is to 
furnish it with food which is poorly prepared, have earnestly 
endeavored to provide a cook-book so superior that if the 
general direcftions and recipes are faithfully followed, 
failures with the consequent discomforts may be avoided. 
To accomplish this, scores pf ladies have been commun- 
icated with, and asked to furnish two, three or more of 
what they considered their choicest recipes. Thus have 
the recipes for the various departments been secured with 
the names of the donors attached. 

A reference to the list of contributors we feel is a 
guarantee of the worth and popularity of this book. We 
have presented American, Spanish, German and French 
departments — a thing unusual. 

Great care has been taken to give concise general 
directions for each chapter ; indeed, to make this book so 
valuable that no lady, whether rich or poor, can afford tO' 
be without it.

FOOD COMBINATIONS 



Miss R. R. Paxton 



If only two vegetables are used with lean meat, use one 
starchy and one green. The objecft of eating is to repair 
the body which is constantly throwing off used up material, 
and during the period of growth to form new tissue. 

The nutritive supply must be adapted to the require- 
ments of the system, nitrogen must be replaced by nitrogen, 
carbon by carbon. We therefore need a mixed diet, which 
must be varied according to individual peculiarities, age, 
occupation, climate, etc. As a general thing, five or six 
times as much carbonaceous as nitrogenous food is required 
— the nitrogen forming tissue, the carbon producing heat. 

SOUP 

Crackers, croutons, breadsticks. 

FISH 

Potatoes, bread, cucumbers. Potatoes prepared in var- 
ious ways. Garnish fish prettily. 

BEEF=ROAST 

White and sweet potatoes, corn, peas, asparagus, cauli- 
flower, tomatoes. 

BEEF=BOILED 

Potatoes, carrots, turnips, parsnips, cauliflower, cabbage, 
spinach. 

VEAL 

As for beef. 

MUTTON 

Potatoes, peas, spinach, asparagus, cauliflower, rice, cold 
slaw. 



26 How We Cook in Los Ayigeles 

LAMB 

Same as mutton. 

PORK 

This in a carbonaceous food, and should be combined 
with food containing nitrogen, as beans, peas, lentils, cab- 
bage. With ham, which is very oily, we use eggs (which 
are highly nitrogenous) apple sauce, horse radish, turnips,, 
tomatoes. 

TURKEY 

Potatoes, onions, turnips, cold slaw, in facft any vege- 
table, cranberry sauce, currant jelly. 

CHICKEN 

Boiled rice, rice croquettes, tomatoes, potatoes, cauli- 
flower, cold slaw. 

DUCKS 

Potatoes, peas, turnips, onions, parsnips, macaroni. 
SMALL BIRDS 

These are nice roasted with a strip of bacon pinned 
around them. Pin with a sharp wooden tooth pick. 

LIVER 

Onions, bacon, potatoes. 

BRAINS 

Peas. 

SWEETBREADS 

Peas, tomatoes. 

VENISON 

Potatoes, tomatoes, spinach, rice, currant or wild plum 
jelly. 



OLD TIME HOSPITALITY 



Jessie Benton Frea\ont 



Washington was my chief home although we had two 
others equally ours, for one was my father's house in St. 
Loufs and the other my mother's — and our birthplace in 
Virginia, a colonial grant to my great grandfather a Scotch 
officer, whose wife came over reluctantly. ( I do not blame 
her, it is weary work to leave home and old civilization for 
a new country), but as this is altogether a paper on domes- 
tic and social habits, I only refer to her as having 
stamped her Virginia home with the comfort and decorum 
and much of the elegance of French housekeeping. For 
Scotland and France were in close relations through the past 
century, and to this day we find the good traces in their 
gardens and housekeeping, and I feel its life-long benefits in 
health, for there, as well as in St. Louis, which was com- 
pletely a French town in my early day, we were saved from 
the over-use of meats, and were used to fowls and vege- 
tables carefully prepared and served as a course. Soups, 
from the "gumbo" to clear bouillons were the rule in all 
households. The whole health is influenced by this pre- 
dominance of lighter food, fruits and vegetables; with breads 
of all kind and soups, these make not only better health 
but better tempers and promote temperance in eating by 
maintaining a calm stomach. This is a fad with me. From 
both sides, my father as well as my mother, we were trained 
to nicety and giving as well as receiving pleasure from the 
family table. The best education in all things comes from 
unconscious imitation and influence of environment, when 
later, the reasons are given one is fortified against less refined 
influences. 

We were four little sisters and it was the law to be fresh 
and tidy, and in the parlor a quarter of an hour before dinner 



28 How We Cook in Los Angeles 

— in Washington this was at five to meet the daily hours of 
the Senate. 

My father, who was certainlj- one of the most largely 
useful and busy men in Government affairs never omitted 
his care for the family. He was our chief teacher, with 
masters coming at fixed hours to add their teachings in 
languages and general studies, for we were homebred. And 
my mother, who overlooked her household as only a Southern 
woman wdth slaves had to do, filled her social position also, 
fully, while by her example we were trained to "pretty 
manners." 

One invariable inflexible law was maintained, and I kept 
to it in my young household, and wherever I could have 
instilled it into young families. Not only were we to be 
quite tidy in person but we were to keep, for that hour of 
family reunion whatever we had seen or known through the 
day — of things or from books — which would give pleasure 
to all. And if any opposite state of mind cropped out, any 
crossness or temper, or small rudeness, nothing was said ; 
but the next day that child ate by itself at a side table 
with its face turned from us : all education my father held 
should be on the lines we must follow more fully as we grew 
older. This "sending to Coventry" of a social offender was 
what would surel^^ overtake us when we were grown if we 
made ourselves unwelcome, it was the law of "Doing to 
others as we would be done by," not preached but acted on. 

This I write to show the family atmosphere that made 

dinners a charming time of social exchange of one's best, 

and not exclusively a function of necessity, or for empty 

show. 

Washington had always exceptional advantages in people 

to meet in that way. From all over the country great 

lawyers brought cases before the Supreme Court — these 

met on common ground at my father's, where the ruinous 

hospitality of (the past) South had full sway. Many men 

have told me since, that never had they sat at such real 

feasts of brilliant minds, and delicate excellence of food as at 



Old Time Hospitality 2g 

that table round. Not only lawyers, but the great interests, 
from the shoes of L,ynn to the sugars of Louisiana — the 
military men of the day fresh from Indian wars — on into the 
Mexican war, for my father was for twenty-eight years 
chairman of the Senate Military Committee and understood 
their needs and was their powerful ally — the many interest- 
ing, travelled, diplomats with all of whom there were inter- 
national interests and with some close personal relations — 
these made a constantly recurring yet varying set of agreeable 
guests who might well say they looked forward to their 
business visits to Washington as bringing them again to that 
delightful table. 

We grew up from babyhood, most of our children were 
born there too — in that dear home. Then it was burned in 
1855. In 1856 the South excommunicated me — to go against 
my people was hard, but there was no choice possible, and in 
1858 my father died. Often I ran down from New York to 
stay a day or so with him — but my mother was gone and 
only my father turned the old look of welcome — the younger 
people looked, and felt me, gone from their ideas, and it 
was more pain than pleasure, but I kept my children as 
much as I could with their grandfather. Except for brief 
stays in California, and longer in Europe, I lived in that 
uncommon atmosphere for nearly thirtj^ years. 

Your request brought up so much of the past I just had 
to tell you why I was from a very early age a practised 
critic and comprehending person at ceremonious dinners — 
invited, and not entirely misplaced either as a guest at 
splendid dinners in New Orleans, and in Washington at the 
Presidents and the best houses of foreign ministers as well 
as our own people of high position. From my twelfth 

year on I was on dinner lists, for I was tall for my age, and 
spoke French and Spanish so well I was constantly put by 
some Minister whose English was elementary, and who had 
no shyness in asking me to interpret — nor had my good 
home training left me any false shyness, for usages, people 
and all I was familiar with in my own home. 



JO How We Cook in Los Ayigeles 

And now I will tell 3-ou of some dinners of my young 
time: 

Mr. Van Buren had been our minister to England and 
liked elegance. He found the President's house rather 

shabby, and though he and his three sons made a family 
of men only, yet men can have nice and pretty ideas as 
well as women. Congress was slow in voting new furniture, 
and the old satins and velvets below had to go on. 
But the smaller dining-room, and the library and sitting- 
rooms above were all made fresh and cheerful at the 
President's expense by English chintzes. Lots of books, 
piclures, china things, such as are usual now, gave another 
effect to these rooms which were not open to the public, 
and the dreadfully open windy hall below he had protected 
by a glass screen — later a Tiffany art glass screen divided 
the long enclosure. Mr. Van Buren also used his own 
beautiful table furnishings. When he was asked if it was 
true as a certain Senator had said in a speech against him, 
that he was "an aristocrat wasting the people's money on 
gold spoons." "I do own gold tableware", he said — "and the 
Senator knows it is mine, for he has had the spoons in 
his mouth, often, at my table." 

Smith Van Buren was just eighteen, and his father invited 
a birthday company of suitable ages — the youngest attaches 
and young Americans, and the girls were all under 
sixteen — I was just thirteen. The President came in for 
dessert. The dinner was like all other dinners which 
never seem to get awaj- from the soup, fish, entrees, filet 
de boeuf and salad and game — served quickly and quietly 
in courses, but one innovation was the fresh flowers in 
place of the great table decoration brought from Paris long 
before — that venerable long mirror, with its ormolu balustrade 
and its groups of statuettes upholding baskets of artificial 
flowers. Those flowers were still on duty in President 
Polk's time when I had reached the mature age of twenty- 
three. But for us, in our early spring time, the President had 
ordered tulips and hyacinths, and for the first time I saw 



Old Time Hospitality ji 

them used naturally, in old-time champagne glasses at each 
plate. The ices too, were moulded and colored to imitate 
fruits, and there were the unfailing tall pyramids of oranges 
in quarters, and grapes, all covered and hung with a network 
of spun sugar. And each girl had a lovely and large bon-bon 
box from Paris with the finest candies and fruit glaces. 

The next 3"ear the whole house had been made over 
fresh; and I was again there at a great dinner, this time in 
the State dining-room, for I was one of eight bridesmaids, 
(all under sixteen, as the bride was that age), though the 
"bridegroom who was the Russian minister was over sixty, 
and the groomsmen matched his age : Mr. Buchanan, the 
English minister, the Belgian and so on. Artificial flowers 
and marble cupids were good enough for this December and 
Maj' business, and we nearly fell asleep over the length of the 
dinner, for our groomsmen took advantage of our youth to 
be at their ease and talked to each other and dined seriously. 
Everything was very much as it is now — only more 
prolonged, but Washington has always had its liberal foreign 
infusion and is exceptional in having had always a fixed 
order of society and usages. So it was in advance of other 
localities in breaking the shell of provincialism. 

Both in our Virginia and St. Louis homes, and alwaj^s in 
"Washington, I was only among the sort of people who had 
neither wish nor temptations to coarse feeding or anj^ habits 
of intemperance in food or drink. My father's well 

known contempt and avoidance of any form of self-indulgence 
naturally brought him like companionship. I was almost 
thirty before I ever saw a gentleman stupefied b}^ drink. 
Perhaps I had an exceptional life, but since my earlier 
•days I have seen many people, and I am constantl}' pleased 
and cheered to see how right prevails over wrong; and good 
outnumbers bad, and generally I feel it is a fairly good world, 
and we can each make it the better and more beautiful by 
doing our ver}' best just around us — which is my moral from 
our family dinner table. 



J 2 How We Cook hi Los Angeles 

The Sunday dinner was, always, an especial pleasure to 
all of us. It had been, in m}^ father's unmarried time, the 
day when he and his more intimate friends could dine at 
leisure as they were free from business. But my mother, 
with her Scotch-Presbyterian training, felt differently. I 
have heard my father laughingly explain how she "weaned 
liim" — being a womanly as well as a clear-headed woman 
she made no opposition to old habits, (for my father was 
nearly forty when he married), but she made the family 
luncheon on Sundays so attracflive, so flattering to all his 
preferences, that any friend he wished to have he would 
ask home from church — and so it came that we grew up 
to it as a special pleasure to have my father at that one 
o'clock meal — the wholesome hour. Mr. Sumner coming 
in by chance once, begged to be invited other Sundays, and 
for seven years he was always when in Washington, 
expedled and nearly always in his favorite place facing the 
flower-stand — in a broad south window.

It was always a cold dinner, for my mother felt the 
servants should have the day of leisure also. She had 
grown up among slaves who could objedl to nothing — and 



Old Time Hospitality jj 

though our own servants were free-born, and some had 
been set free by my parents, yet the id^a of claiming equal 
rights to rest, or religion, did not occur to them — but it 
did to my mother to give them. For this everything was 
prepared on Saturday. 

But our cook "Aunt Betsey" who lived twenty-three years 
with us had been not only "a born cook" but "made" by 
training under a French chef (and pra(5lice under a 
Virginia housekeeper ) and each thing was as completely 
delicately good, and handsome to see too, as for a fine supper 
of to-day. Onl}^ claret on the table: my father was really 
temperate in food and almost wholly so in drink — abstem- 
ious is a better word, for his tastes were refined. For 
example, the turkey was never roasted for he thought that 
"coarse", but steamed, with a stufiing of oysters, and a 
white sauce of cream and herbs. This was Mr. Sumner's 
delight, for he greatly enjoyed nice food ( as Longfellow's 
letters show) also the delicate flavor of the bufialo tongues, 
a luxury not easily had, but sent through the Fur Company 
to my Father. He had said in a speech on the future 
Railways of the West that the bufialos were the natural 
engineers who had found the best passes across the Rocky 
Mountains. For this Mr. Sumner called them "Engineers' 
tongues". The only hot thing was the potato, which could 
be left in the hot ashes of the covered fire — for cooking 
ranges were unknown at first and then despised by both 
epicures and cooks. With the natural hunger-hour, the 
pleasant people, the unusual freedom from work-a-day 
obligations no wonder the food seems so good, and it was 
as good and attradlive as it was satisfying. It was a favor 
to be asked — verbally — to our Sunday early dinner. There 
was always provision made for more people though it was 
if possible confined to very few. Years later when I had 
a sea-side home at Nahant, near Longfellow's, Mr. Sumner, 
who always made his friend long visits there, came regularly 
in the old intimate way to my house — "I get tired of fish- 
dinners", he would say, and "you keep house like 



J/ How We Cook in Los Angeles 



your mother — I never feel I intrude or disturb any one". 
It was my "well-done" as one of that centre of wit, of 
large ideas, of large hospitality, represented at our home 
table. 

Los Angeles, May 14, 1894. 



MRS. ALCOTT'S TABLE 



Mrs. C. M. Severance 



Through the infecftious enthusiasm of a friend I was 
beguiled into a pledge which I find must now be re- 
deemed, despite its evident lack of fitness to the matter in 
hand. For of all imaginable roles, that of catering to the 
public taste in the way of menus, or in recipes for popular 
dishes, is for me, a most grievous "misfit." But, as a com- 
promise, •and perhaps as a novelty, I have been kindly per- 
mitted to give as my contribution, what will be a mere 
outline or hint of my own ideal menu and cooking, as illus- 
trated practically at the table of Mrs. Bronson Alcott, the 
sturdy and capable mother of our famous Louisa and her 
sisters. 

In later years the family purse was well filled by the re- 
sults of lyouisa's profitable literary work. But when I was 
first a guest, the luxury of a hired cook was not to be in- 
dulged; and the brave housemother put before her visitors the 
work of her own hands and brain, the latter a factor not to be 
had for the asking, nor for any given number of dollars per 
week, from our untrained maidens of our time. 

The element of brains and the charming home atmosphere 
no doubt counted for much in the relish of the food. Cer- 
tainly to me those meals were "fit to set before a king," so 
dainty were they in their getting up, so delicate in their 
flavors, so perfect in kind and color, "so done to a turn," 
after the best fashion of our grandmotheis. 

No odor of frying fat, or of crude, pungent vegetables 
polluted the pure, fresh air of the house. The usual "cuts 
and joints" being replaced by deliciously-cooked breads, by 
"crushed wheat" moulded into the appetizing and artistic 
forms of corn, melons, and other pretty fruits, and smothered 
in genuine cream; or by pears and apples baked to a luscious 



J 6 How We Cook hi Los A7igeles 

tenderness and a rich brown: so that these special dishes came 
to stand with me, for the veritable plain living which is the 
poetic accompainment of high thinking, ''the feast of reason'' 
which begets, or at least does not hinder, the flowing together 
over it, of noble souls. And those meals gave us not 
"roasted I^ady," but a useful, sweet, gracious hostess, gener- 
ous of herself as well as of her stores, with no smell of the 
kitchen upon her garments, nor worry of it on her placid 
face. For nearly all these dishes were prepared in the early 
morning hours, and cooled by the Concord breezes for the 
summer days delight and refreshment. And of such meals 
the bluff old Abernethy w^ould not have needed to utter his 
strong statement that "we dig our graves with our teeth;" 
for by such diet; which discards the unnecessary stimulus of 
condiments, of high flavors, and harmful, because too tempt- 
ing a variety at any one meal; a normal appetite is cultivated 
and satisfied, which keeps instinctively to "the golden mean of 
not too much." 

But for such meals it is evident that no special recipes are 
needed, beyond the suggestion of the skillful use of the cook's 
good brains, a scrupulous exactness of measure, and of time, 
and the use of only the best material. I may add, however, 
directions for one item of this simple meiui, and that some- 
what modified by later experiment, the "Graham biscuit or 
roll," now called the whole wheat gem. 

Take of this modern meal (which includes all the nutritit^u^'i^ 
ous elements of the grain, leaving out only the harsh outer 
husk,) I cupful, ij4 cupsof fresh milk, or of cold water a trifle 
more or less, the former making the gem moister within and 
crisper and browner of crust. Beat the meal and milk to- 
gether smartly, then pour the mixture into very hot, iro?i gem- 
pans and put these into a very hot oven. Twenty minutes, 
or less, will take to give an even nut-brown color, and eaten 
with fresh butter they will give the full sweetness of the grain 
and of the well-baked crust. To a natural, health}' appetite 
no item of the gourmand's feast can be more tempting nor 
eaten with keener relish. 



Mrs. AlcotVs Table 37 



Saying this I will no doubt find myself justified in the 
eyes of "the world's people" in my opening statement of 
being a misfit in a 19th century cook-book, and must appeal 
from this to the verdict of the better time coming in the 20th 
century, where I am confident of winning my case. 



TABLE DECORATIONS 



Mrs. Anna Bancroft 



[The following charming letters were kindly contributed b}' Mrs. 
AnnajBancroft, who has spent six months in Chicago, at the World's 
Fair as assistant to Mrs. Candace Wheeler, the latter being Diredlor 
of the Women's Building. Mrs. Wheeler is President of the Associated 
Artists of New York City — indeed was the founder of that society'.] 



My DBA.R M.: — I have lately had the pleasure of accept- 
ing several very pleasant invitations to breakfasts, luncheons, 
etc., and as you said in your letter, that you wanted to do 
some entertaining, I thought you might like to know how 
they do that sort of thing here. 

I,ast Wednesday, I went to a breakfast which will long 
linger in my memor}^ the decorations being so charming. 
It was given by a young couple, both artists, who are famed 
for their informal entertainments. One leaves with the 
thought that here, at least, they have rested in an oasis in 
the dreary desert of most social functions. Formality began 
and ended with the written invitations. One felt perfe(5lly 
certain when greeted by the host, in white flannels, and the 
hostess, in an airy, white, lace-trimmed "confe(5lion", that 
a good time was coming. Nothing was formal, nothing stifi". 
And, although eighteen people of different tastes and char- 
adlers, sat down together, each felt the atmosphere of the 
house at once; and long before the table was reached, was 
in a frame of mind to be delighted with everything, and to 
add his or her share to the general entertainment. 

The breakfast room was the perfection of brightness. 
The shades and hangings had been taken away from the 
windows to allow the sun to pour through a lattice-work 
of green vines so cleverly woven back and forth that 



Table Decorations jg 



Nature seemed the handmaiden. Vines were trailed from 
the sides of the room to the chandelier, hiding the fixtures, 
and forming a bower over the dainty table; in the center 
of which was a large bowl filled with white sweet peas, 
whose delicate fragrance could not interfere with the most 
fastidious appetite, as a heavier odor might have done. The 
dainty green of the asparagus vine trailed o'er the blossoms 
and along the table in every direction. Before each guest 
were individual flower-holders filled with the same blossoms; 
the vine running around each plate formed a refreshing 
nest for the good things to come. The center bowl and 
holders were of the dainty rainbow ware that refle(5ls the 
many shades of pinks, purples and blues; and here, together 
with the sunlight, furnished just enough color to add 
character to the whole. Almost no silver was used. The 
linen was embroidered in light and airy designs; everything 
was simple and refreshing. And the eyes and brains of 
all, feeling the effect, the conversation partook of the 
brightness and crispness of the hour. 

Well might the hostess sit smiling and unconcerned. If 
the cook had not been "on time", nor the menu all that 
it should have been, every one, by this time, was too 
agreeably impressed to be affecfted by such trifles. 

As I looked at the table, I thought how the scheme 
might be varied from green and white by using forget-me- 
nots, pink sweet peas, mignonette, or the pink and white 
Lady Washington geraniums. 

The menu was — well it would take too long to tell of 
its delights, so I will leave that for another letter. 



Yours, A. 



My Dear M.: — As in your last, 5'ou seemed pleased 
with what I wrote you about the breakfast decorations, 
and expressed your willingness "to sit at the feet of the 
scribe," I will tell you something about some lovely 
luncheons it has lately been my good fortune to attend. 



^o How We Cook in Los Angeles 



I,uncheons are the pride, and alas! often the downfall 
of many a hostess. In the hands of some women, they are 
dreams of fairy land — everything that is beautiful, artistic, 
and satisfactory. While another poor mortal with a wild 
desire to outshine her dearest friend, will take the greatest 
liberties with the materials on hand. Colors run riot. The 
drawn work and embroidery and other art (?) works are 
trotted out — the more the merrier. Gossip has its fling; it 
always does when things are at sixes and sevens; and one 
goes home with the feeling that she has been looking 
through a kaleidescope. The brain is weary, the eyes are 
tired, and the digestion upset. In spite of the wild craze 
for over-decorating, however, the best-dressed tables are 
becoming more simple each year, and consequently, more 
refined. Fancy work is used in moderation, and flowers 
in less profusion. But pardon my preaching, as I have 
just come from such a lovely luncheon which I will not 
describe; but tell you about two or three I attended lately 
which were really soul, or perhaps I might say mind, satis- 
fying. 

At the first one, given by a bride in return for some 
luncheons given by her school friends, the decorations were 
pink azalias. The table was covered with drawn work and 
would have looked very much over-trimmed but for the 
beautiful color scheme which was so perfect that I was 
tempted to forgive the hostess for spoiling her eyesight. 
By the way, more handwork is put on the linen, nowadays, 
than ever before. An artistic hostess finds she must exer- 
cise great judgment in order to have everything embroidered 
and befuddled just enough. But to return to my table. 
The cloth of very fine linen was bordered with fifteen 
inches of drawn work, and lined with delicate pink silk 
fringed, and hanging about an inch below the fringe of the 
cloth. An oblong runner, almost entirely drawn, beautifully 
worked and lined with the same pink, reached to the edge 
of the plates. 

An oblong cut glass dish filled with azalias, white with 



Table Decorations // 



pink edges, and maiden hair fern graced the center. At 
every plate was placed a little white spoon made of twisted 
tissue paper with a bunch of tiny pink blossoms tied on 
the handle with white ribbon. These served a double 
purpose; the salted almonds being in the bowl of the 
spoon and the name of each guest in gilt lettering on the 
handle; as dainty a name card as one would wish to see. 
The sherbet glasses were hidden in beautiful tissue paper 
tulips, white with deep edges and dashes of pink color. A 
small lace doyley lined with pink set off these pretty 
flowers. Larger doilies with the same lining were under 
the finger bowls of cut glass; a single azalia and spray of 
maiden hair fern floating on the water. Potted azalias and 
ferns were in effective positions about the room. The 
china service was in white and gold. 

Last week, Mrs. S. gave a luncheon to her sister. She, 
Mrs. S., is a beautiful brunette who goes in for style (with 
a capital S) and stunning effects that startle rather than 
soothe. The decorations of the room were in yellow and 
black. The runner and napkins were embroidered in deep 
yellow ribbons, bowknots and ends. In the center, a low, 
flat dish was filled with yellow and black pansies (pulled 
up by the roots instead of picked) giving the impression of 
a bed of growing flowers which was made more real by 
the bunches being raised in the center of the bed. From 
this glowing wealth of colors, rose a brass standard lamp, 
the base, and part of the standard completely hidden by the 
pansies. The shade, which was immense, almost a canopy 
for the table, was made of light yellow silk with a very full 
and deep flounce. Perched all over the top of this were stuff- 
ed black-birds in every conceivable position, and looking as if 
a flock had settled there for the afternoon, A few birds 
with out-stretched wings hovered over the table and about 
the room. These were suspended from the ceiling by 
invisible wires. Bunches of yellow pansies alternated with 
black ones at the plates. Great dishes of the pansies were 
placed on sideboard and dresser; and a round table in the 



4-2 How We Cook in Los Angeles 

bay window was simply a bed of yellow and black flowers. 
On the name cards, which were painted in water colors, 
were pretty girls, who on some were in yellow tulle, and 
on others, in black tulle; those in yellow being placed with 
the yellow pansies, and those in black with the black 
flowers. 

Mrs. G. gave a dainty forget-me-not lunch to the M's 
who were just starting for Europe. This was a great 
contrast to the yellow and black affair of Mrs. S. The 
linen was all embroidered in forget-me-nots and white 
ribbon. A pot of tall maiden hair fern spread its feathery 
sprays high and far over the table. Banked so as to 
completely hide the pot, and reaching almost to the plates 
was a garden of the forget-me-nots apparently growing in 
their own foliage. At each cover was a bunch of the same 
flowers; and a little pin tray in the center of which was 
painted a wreath of forget-me-nots, the name of the guest, 
and the date of the luncheon. They were souvenirs as well 
as name cards and were too pretty to be lost on the waj^ 
home. The ices were served in paper ice-cups twined 
with spra3'S of the same dainty blue flowers; and a spray 
was also dropped into each finger bowl. Four silver 
standard lamps were placed about the room; the shades 
of white silk completely covered with artificial forget-me- 
nots. As a background to the whole, potted plants were 
placed in all the corners and around the room. The china 
service at this lunch was delicate blue and silver. 

But this letter is unconscionatle long so I must close. 

Yours ever, A. 



My Dear M.: — What of dinners? Don't I go to any or 
don't they give dinners now ? Yes to . both questions, 
although I think luncheons predominate. There is very 
little difference between the luncheon and dinner decora- 
tions. There is so much attempted for the luncheon that 
little new is left for the heavier meal, and people are 



Table Decorations ^j 



satisfied to decorate in much the same manner. At one or 
two places, they have used the bare table; but I think, and 
have good authority for thinking, that that is only suitable 
for informal luncheons, late teas, and theatre suppers; or 
when the repast is Bohemian in its nature. At a dinner 
where many courses are served and where silver, glass, and 
china are used in abundance, the bare boards are cold and 
do not show off the elegance and daintiness of the neces- 
sary decorations. .Crumbs, bits of fat, etc., that are always 
dropped upon a table do not brush easily from the wood 
but leave greasy little roads running from corner to 
corner, that are anything but appetizing. This is not so 
at an informal lunch or supper, as the crumbs are allowed 
to remain unmolested during the meal. There is a fresh- 
ness and a cleanliness to a white-dressed table that is very 
appetizing, and the flowers with other decorations show to 
the very best advantage. 

At a dinner I attended lately, the decorations were 
quite unique; being made of the new crepe paper. In the 
center of the table was a large, round, flat dish of maiden 
hair fern; with lavender and deep purple orchids of the 
butterfly variety made of the paper. The tall central lamp 
of brass had an immense square shade of the white crepe 
paper with deep purple fringe tinted in water color. A 
scroll work in purple was painted above this edge. Large 
bows of the paper wired, and pasted in two opposite 
corners gave a light and butterfly effect. Fifteen large 
orchids, each four inches across, made of paper and beauti- 
fully painted to represent the natural flowers were scattered 
over the entire top and side. A big bow and a bunch of 
the orchids were tied about half way up the standard of 
the lamp. The table was round and seated twelve. At 
regular distances from the center, and from each other, were 
tall candle sticks covered with white paper. The candles 
were white, and had quite good sized shades all bordered 
with the same purple-tinted edges and trimmed with small 
orchids. As the shades were furnished with mica 



How We Cook m J^os Angeles 



chimneys and spreaders, there was no blaze to flame up 
and startle all, just when X\ie guest of honor had reached 
the point of his story. At the covers of the ladies were 
beautiful white baskets made of twisted paper, tinted and 
trimmed to match the shades, and each filled with a 
pound of delicious candy. The name of each lady was 
painted in gold on a white ribbon tied to the handle. 
Alternating with these beautiful souvenirs were penwipers 
for the gentlemen. Two cunning little brownies of 
opposite sexes, one dressed in white, the other in deep 
purple, stood on a mat of crocheted paper and held in 
their tiny hands the name cards of the gentlemen who 
were to carry them home. The ice-cups were white, buried 
in a wreath of orchids. Nothing daintier or less expensive 
could be devised for an effective decoration. 

At another dinner, the table was trimmed with white 
pond lilies; the leaves and long, rubber-like stems adding 
much to the grace and elegance of arrangement. From 
the chandelier hung an immense bunch of the white 
blossoms and leaves which had been pulled from the 
bottom of the lake instead of being picked. The long 
stems hung quite to, in fact touched, a round mirror which 
formed a good sized lake in the middle of the large round 
table. Around the edge and trailing over the glass were 
the blooms and leaves. At intervals, the bunches of flowers 
were raised like a mound to hide a small fairy lamp with 
a pink shade that shed a faint glow over the glass and 
flowers. As the entire lighting was shaded in faint pink 
the same efiecft was produced all over the room. At each 
cover was a fairy lamp completely hidden with a bunch 
of flowers and leaves. A card painted and cut out to 
represent the real flower bore the name and served as a 
souvenir. The patties were served in pond lilies made 
of paper, and the large natural leaves were pinned together 
with little sharp twigs to make pretty cups for the ices. 
The whole effecl was charming. 

But for the present, adieu, A.

This may not be aesthetic, but it is ''fin de siecle". As 
many flowers take on this glowing shade called "nature's 
red", it will not be difficult to decorate the table with 
brilliant magenta which is most effective with cut glass, 
and the satin damask of the cloth. 

At each plate, place quite a broad bow of magenta 
ribbon with a spray of pretty white flowers tied in it. On 
one loop, painted in silver, the name of the guest and date 
of luncheon. Have white candles with little magenta 
shades. Fill bonbon dishes with magenta and white candies. 
Place around the edge of a cut glass olive dish a circle of 
magenta pickled beets. Decorate pickle dishes in the same 
fashion. Another dish with small magenta radishes will 
add another touch of color.

SALADS 



E. p. E. 



In salad making, the best success is obtainable only by 
a close observance of three very important rules, viz.: 

I. The ingredients composing the salad and dressing 
must be suitabl}^ chosen. 

II. They must be introduced into the mixture in a 
certain specific order. 

III. The method of mixing must be suited to the nature 
of the ingredients. 

A dressing should not be the prominent feature of a 
salad. It should be a dressing only; an adjunct to tone 
down too sharp an acid, or a flavor too pungent ; or to 
render more distinctive the individuality of the fruits, 
vegetables, etc., composing the salad. This is the true 
mission of the dressing. 

There are four distinct classes of salad dressing: 
I. Transparent dressing. 2. French dressing. 
3. Cream dressing. 4. Mayonnaise dressing. 

TRANSPARENT ORANGE DRESSING 

Three oranges (juice only); 4 ounces of sugar; i lemon 
(juice only); i &gg. 

Beat together, using the white and shell of the Q^g. 
Heat to boiling point. Simmer five minutes. Strain. 
If liked, a little of the grated peel of both orange and 
lemon may be added. 

JELLIED TRANSPARENT ORANGE DRESSING 

Add to the above mixture before heating a half ounce 
■of gelatine soaked in half a gill of water. 



6o How We Cook in Los Angeles 



TRANSPARENT TOMATO DRESSING 

One pint of tomato, stewed and strained ; i tablespoon 
arrowroot mixed in cold water; i ounce butter; )^ teaspoon 
each of sugar and salt; a little pepper. 

Boil tomato and arrowroot two minutes. Add butter, 
salt, pepper, and sugar. Nice either hot or cold with any 
kind of meat salad. 

FRENCH DRESSING 

Four teaspoons of vinegar; ^ teaspoon of salt; ^3 tea- 
spoon of pepper. Mix, and pour over salad, then add 
Rowland's olive oil to taste. 

CREAH DRESSING 

One pint of boiling cream; 2 ounces of flour; 2 ounces- 
of butter. Stir the flour and butter to a smooth paste, add 
the boiling cream and cook two minutes. Remove from 
the saucepan, and add the batter, stirring until cool and 
perfectly mixed; then season to taste with lemon juice, 
vinegar, salt, pepper, mustard, capers, minced onion, 
parsley, chopped pickled cucumbers; any or all of these. 

SOUR CREAM DRESSING 

One cup of sour cream; y^ cup of vinegar or lemon- 
juice; season with salt and ca^^enne pepper. Use on vege- 
table or fish salads. 

HOT CREAfl DRESSING 

One ounce of flour; i ounce of butter; i pint sweet cream r 
salt, and pepper. Cook flour and butter together two 
minutes; add cream, and season to taste. Use on cauli- 
flower, beets, potatoes, or any vegetable. 

HAYONNAISE DRESSING 

One teaspoon of mustard; i teaspoon of salt; i^^ tea- 



Salads 6t 

spoons of vinegar; i yolk of egg; y^ pint Howland's olive 
oil. 

Use a two quart bowl to allow room for beating. Mix 
the mustard, salt and vinegar; add the 5'olk, beat well, add 
the oil, pouring it in, in a fine, thread-like stream, beating 
rapidly all the time. Vinegar or lemon juice may be added 
if required to make it of the proper consistency. 

COOKED MAYONNAISE DRESSING 

Fiv^e yolks of eggs, 5 tablespoons vinegar; 4 ounces of 
butter; y^ pint sweet cream; salt, pepper and mustard. 

Beat in the yolks, cook in boiling vinegar until stiff, 
being careful to stir clean from the sides of the bowl 
while cooking. Remove from the fire, add the butter; 
stirring until cool and smooth. Season to taste, and thin 
with cream. Oil may be used in place of cream if preferred. 



MAYONNAISE SAUCE 

Mrs Henderson's Cook Book. 

* Yolk of I &%z ; 2 .saltspoons salt ; i saltspoon mustard 
powder ; oil (Howland's) ; vinegar ; lemon juice ; cayenne 
pepper. 

Beat yolk of &z% well, in cold bow^l, with silver fork ; then 
add salt and mustard worked well together. Mix in last, a 
little good oil, slowdy, a few drops at a time, alternated with a 
few drops of vinegar. In proportion as the oil is used, the 
sauce should gain consistency. When it begins to have the 
appearance of jelly, alternate a few drops of lemon juice with 
the oil. When the ^%^ has absorbed a gill of oil, finish the 
sauce by adding a very little pinch of cayenne pepper, and 
one and a half teaspoons of good vinegar. These proportions 
will suit most tastes, yet some may prefer more oil and mus- 
tard. Be cautious in the use of cayenne. * 
By beating the ^%% a minute before adding the oil, there 
is little danger of the sauce curdling ; yet if by adding too 



62 How We Cook in Los Angeles 

much oil at first it should curdle, interrupt the operation im- 
mediately. Beat the yolks of one or two eggs on another 
plate, add the curdled mayonnaise by degrees and finish by 
adding oil, lemon juice, salt, pepper, and cayenne according 
to taste.

vinegar. 

Beat the yolks, add cream, sugar, salt, mustard, pepper, 
and cayenne. Mix thoroughly. Bring the vinegar to the 
boiling point, add the butter and boil again. Pour this on the 
other ingredients, and mix well. 

This dressing, if bottled when cold, and stored in a cool 
place, will keep good for weeks. 



MAYONNAISE DRESSING 

Mrs. H. Z. Osborne. 

Yolks of two eggs; i tablespoon soft butter; Vi teaspoon 
dry mustard; 3 tablespoons Rowland's olive oil; the juice of 
one lemon; Vs teaspoon salt; a dash of cayenne pepper and

briskly with silver fork one or two minutes, add the softened 
butter, then the mustard, and the oil, a teaspoonful at a time. 
Stir constantly for two minutes, and add the sugar and cay- 
enne pepper, and lastly, the lemon juice, and salt. Stir all a 
minute or two, or until very smooth and well blended. 

If you follow directions carefully, you will have a dressing 
that has not " curdled " and will not curdle, and can easily be 
made in ten minutes.

JO How We Cook hi Los Angeles 

and cover with boiling water. Salt and simmer gently twenty

CHICKEN SALAD 

Mrs. Hendersou's Cook Book. 

One chicken; white celery stalks; 3 tablespoons vinegar; 
I tablespoon Rowland's olive oil; salt, pepper, mustard. 

Boil chicken till tender, when cold, separate the meat from 
the bones. Cut into small bits; do not mince it. Cut some 
white, tender stalks of celery into three-quarters inch lengths. 
Mix chicken and celery together; stir into them a mixture in 
the proportion of three tablespoons of vinegar to one of oil; 
pepper, salt, mustard to taste. Set this aside for an hour or 
two. When ready to serve mix the chicken and celery with a 
mayonnaise dressing, reserving a portion of the mayonnaise to 
mark the top. Garnish with fresh celery leaves, stick a bunch 
of these in the center of the salad and from the center to each 
of the four sides, sprinkle rows of capers. 

Chicken salad is often made of lettuce instead of celery. 
Marinate the chicken alone a moment before serving, add the 
small, tender, sweet lettuce leaves, then pour mayonnaise 
dressing over the top. Garnish with the center heads of let- 
tuce, capers, cold chopped red beets, or sliced hard-boiled 
eggs. Sometimes little slips of anchovy are added for a gar- 
nish. When on the table it should all be mixed together. 

Many may profit by this recipe for chicken salad, for it is 
astonishing how few understand making so common a a dish. 
It is often minced and mixed with hard-boiled eggs for a 
dressing.

CHICKEN 5ALAD 

Mrs. E. A. Otis. 

In mixing chicken salad allow one yolk of an egg to each 
chicken, and to four chickens one and a half pints of olive 
oil. Pick the chickens apart with fingers, removing carefully 
all fat and skin. Then take celery, pick likewise into small 
pieces and add it to the chicken until there is an equal quan- 
tity of each. If celery cannot be obtained, use lettuce pre- 
pared in the same manner. 

For the dressing one level teaspoon of salt to each yolk of 
an egg; pepper to taste, one teaspoon of dry mustard, and 
juice of one lemon, more if the lemon is not very juicy. The 
oil should be added a few drops at a time, stirring constantly. 
While stirring, add an occasional drop of vinegar. To this 
mixture add the last thing one-half cup of rich cream, and 
when thoroughly mixed, pour over the salad just before it is 
served. The object of the lemon is to cut the oil, and make 
the dressing of a cream-like consistency. 

SALAD OF STUFFED EGGS 

Mrs. L. J Rose. 

One dozen eggs; 2 tablespoons Ho wland's olive oil; onions, 
salt, red pepper.

SOUPS 



M. B. W. 



Broth, or stock, may be made by boiling the cracked 
joints of beef, veal, or mutton in water; in the proportion 
of two and one half pints to each pound of bones and meat. 
The bones and meat should be of about equal weight. 
Chicken and veal added to beef make a more delicate soup. 

Put the meat in the pot, cover with cold water, and let 
it come to a boil, then skim. Next set the pot where it 
will simmer slowly four or five hours, when it should be 
done. 

The next day, when the broth is cold, and and the fat 
which has hardened on the top has been removed, a nice 
jelly will be formed, which, if kept in a cold place, should 
keep one week. When vegetables are used, they should 
be added only in time to become well cooked. If onions 
are used, they should be fried in a little hot butter, before 
they are added to the soup. Potatoes and cabbage should 
be boiled in separate water, before they are added to a soup. 

Just before dinner each day, if soup is to be served, it 
is only necessary to cut off some of the jelly, heat it, serve 
it alone or add any flavoring desired, as onion, tomato, 
asparagus, green peas, macaroni, vermicelli, tapioca, or any- 
other flavoring. 

Stock should be kept in a stone jar, and is valuable 
aside from making soups, for gravies, sauces, and stews. 

TO CLEAR SOUP STOCK 

Allow the white and shell of one egg for every quart 
of stock. Set it on the fire and stir till hot, let simmer 
ten minutes, then add a cup of cold water, and strain 
through a fine strainer or napkin. 



Soups "js 

SOUP 

MRS. B. C. WHITING. 

All flavoring should be added to the soup after the 
stock is made and when cold; no vegetables should be boiled 
with stock, as it gives it a bad flavor. Boil the vegetables 
first and press them through a colander, then add them to 
the stock, and boil two minutes; otherwise soups disagree 
with some people. 

CARAflEL FOR COLORING SOUPS 

MRS. LINCOLN. 

Melt one cup sugar with one tablespoon of water in a 
frying pan. Stir until it becomes a dark brown color. 
Add one cup of boiling water; simmer ten minutes and 
bottle when cool. This should be always kept on hand, 
as it is useful for many purposes. It gives a rich, dark 
color to soups, coffee, and jelly; is more wholesome than 
browned butter in sauces, and is delicious as a flavoring in 
custards and pudding sauces. 

PROFITEROLES FOR SOUP 

MRS. FRANK K. PHILLIPS. 

One fourth cup boiling water; 2 eggs; Y-z scant cup 
flour; yl cup butter. 

Put the water and butter in a sauce pan and place on 
the fire. When it boils rapidly add the flour all at once. 
Beat well with a strong spoon for two minutes. Turn into 
a bowl and put away to cool. When cool add the eggs 
one at a time and beat 15 minutes. Roll the size of peas 
and drop on buttered tins, and bake ten minutes. 

TO riAKE FORCE MEAT BALLS 

MRS. J F. CONROY.

little fine onion, salt, pepper, and bread crumbs; dip in ^%^ 
and fry. Before serving put balls in soup and boil once,

BOUILLON 

Juliet Corson. 

This is the most elaborate, and at the same time the most 
delicate, and nutritious soup that can be made. 

Four quarts of cold water; 4 pounds soup beef and bone; 
I chicken or fowl weighing from 3 to 4 pounds; the small end 
of a leg of veal, (the knuckle). One large carrot; i small 
onion; i large turnip; 3 roots parsley; i blade of mace; i dozen 
whole cloves; i stalk celery; i dozen pepper corns; i hz.y leaf; 
a sprig of any dried herb, (sage excepted); i tablespoon of 
salt. 

Carefully pluck, singe, draw, and truss the fowl for boiling. 
Cut the beef in a large piece from the bone. Break the bones 
in small pieces, removing the marrow; put them in the bottom 
of the soup kettle; lay on them the beef and fowl; pour in the 
water and let it gradually heat and boil, removing all scum as 
it rises. Peel the onion, carrot and turnip, leaving them 
whole; stick the cloves in the onions. Wash the parsley with 
stalk and leaves Attached; in the midst of it put the mace, bay 
leaf, celery, pepper corns, etc. Wrap the roots and leaves of 
the parsley about these and tie in a compact little bundle. 
(This makes a bouquet or fagot of herbs). After the soup is 
skimmed clear, add the bouquet, the vegetables, and the level 
tablespoon of salt. Cover the kettle, and place it where its 
contents will boil slowly from one side, for three hours at 
least. When the chicken is tender take it up. It can be used 
for any of the dishes made of cooked chicken. 

Strain the bouillon through a clean towel laid double in a 



Soups 77 

colander set over an earthen bowl. When cold, remove every 
particle of fat. Mix for each quart, the white and shell of an 
egg> with one tablespoon of cold water in a sauce pan; pour in 
the bouillon, set it over the fire, stirring occasionally to keep 
the &^g loosened from the pan until it begins to boil; then 
place where it will boil gently until the soup looks clear as 
wine, under the thick scum of ^ZZ- Strain again through 
folded towel and colander, allowing it to run through without 
squeezing the towel, as that might force through some tiny 
particle of the ^%Z- It should be perfectly clear and spark- 
ling, and of the color of amber. 

The bouillon after it is clarified will keep from three to ten 
days, according to the weather. Sealed in jars it will keep 
indefinitely.

FISH 



M. B. W. 



Fish should never be allowed to stand; but should be 
cleaned immediately, in strongly-salted water. After they are 
cleaned, they should be washed with a cloth wet in salt water, 
then wrapped, sprinkled with salt and put in a cool place. 
Fish should never be soaked; nor put in an ice-chest, as any 
food which may be in the chest will absorb the odor. Ice 
may be placed around, but should not touch the fish; ice and 
water have a tendency to soften fish: a soft fish is unfit to 
eat.

lyivers of 4 or 5 fowls and as many gizzards; 3 tablespoons 
melted butter; i chopped onion; i tablespoon Worcestershire, 
or other pungent sauce; salt and white pepper to taste; a few 
truffles — if you can get them. 

Boil the livers until quite done; drain and wipe dry, and, 
when cold, rub them to a paste in a Wedgewood mortar. 
lyCt the butter and onion simmer together very slowly at the 
side of the range for ten minutes. Strain them through thin 
muslin, pressing the bag hard to extract the full flavor of the 
onion, and work this well into the pounded liver. Turn into 
a larger vessel, and mix with it the rest of the seasoning, 
working all together for a long while. Butter a small china 
or earthenware jar or cup, and press the mixture hard down 
within it, interspersing it with square bits of the boiled giz- 
zards, to represent truffles. Of course, the latter are pref- 
erable; but, being scarce and expensive, they are not alwaj^s 
to be had. If you have them, boil them and let them get 
cold before putting them into the pattie. Cover all with 
melted butter, and set all in a cool, dry place. 

This pattie is a delicious relish, and is more easily attain- 
able than would at first appear. The livers of a turkey and 
a pair of chickens or ducks will make a small one, and these 
can be saved from one poultry day to another, by boiling 
them in salt water, and keeping in a cool place. Or, one can 
often secure any number of giblets, by previous application at 
the kitchen of a restaurant or a hotel.

CREOLE FRICASSEE 

Mrs. E. M. Ross. 

Cut chicken, or any other fowl, into pieces, and allow it 
to lie in cold salted water for 30 minutes, take out and dry 
with a towel. Rub each piece with a little black and red 
pepper and dredge them lightly with flour. Have two table- 
spoonfuls of ham fat boiling hot in the saucepan, brown the 
chicken in this. When well-browned on both sides, put in a 
few rings of onions, and when these are pale brown, add a 
pint and a half of hot water — celery, salt and pepper to taste; 
cover closely and cook gently until the chicken is tender. 
The Creoles color this gravy very often with Chili pepper, 
which gives it a fine red color.

POULTRY AND GAME 



M. B. W. 



In roasting or boilitig whole any fowl, truss it. 

To broil, split the body down the back, and lay it open. 

Cut the joints, do not break the bones, when preparing a 
fowl for fricassee. 

The longer fowl or game can be kept perfectly sweet, 
before cooking, the more tender it will be. 

ROAST TURKEY 

Mrs. W. G. W. 

The turkey should be carefully plucked, singed with white 

paper, neatly drawn, washed inside, and thoroughly dried 

with a cloth. Cut off the neck close to the back, leaving 

enough of the skin to turn over on the back. Cut off the 

legs in the joints, draw out the strings from the thighs, and 

flatten the breast bone — to make it look plump. Fill the 

breast and body with the dressing, sew up carefully, truss 

firml5\ Dredge with flour and put in the oven. Baste freely, 

first with butter and water, then with the gravy in the pan.

BONED ROASTED TURKEY 

Mrs. W. J. Brown. 

Slit the skin down the back, and raising one side at a 
time with the fingers, separate the flesh from the bones with 
a knife; when the legs and wings are reached, unjoint them 
from the body, and cut through to the bone, then turn back 
the flesh and remove the bones. The turkey may be 
reshaped, by stuffing with any dressing preferred, sew 
together, press the wings close to the back, tie firmly. Baste 
often with water, seasoned with salt and butter. Roast until 
thoroughly done. Carve across in slices. Serve with cran- 
berry sauce, or ]e\\y. 

BOILED TURKEY 

Practical Housekeeping.

deeply, and rub in plenty of mustard. Pour over them the 
gravy and juice of meat. Pepper and salt liberally; put in 
Worcestershire sauce, cayenne pepper and a dash of garlic. 
Let it stand all night to become thoroughly impregnated. 
Before breakfast put in stew pan on fire and stew thoroughly, 
pouring the juice with plenty of butter in the stew pan. 

HARYLAND FRIED CHICKEN 

Juliet Corson. 

To prepare the chicken; remove the feathers, singe it, wipe 
it with a wet towel. Draw it without breaking the intestines, 
and there will be no need of washing it. Cut it in joints, as 



Poultry and Game 



for fricassee; dip each joint quickly in cold water, then at once 
roll it in ilour, seasoned with salt and pepper, covering it thor- 
oughly. Melt lard in a large, shallow frying pan, covering 
the bottom a quarter of an inch deep. When the fat begins to 
smoke, put in the chicken, leaving spaces between the pieces. 
Fry slowly until it is a light brown, and tender. Allow three- 
quarters of an hour for preparing the entire dish. 

FRIED YOUNG CHICKEN 

Mrs. W. H. Pendleton. 

Flour, butter, lard, salt, chicken. 

Cut the chicken in pieces; salt, roll in flour and fry slowly' 
in equal quantities of hot butter and lard, until of a fine 
brown. 

BROILED CHICKEN 

Practical Housekeeping. 

Cut the chicken open on the back, lay on the meat board,, 
and pound until it will be flat on the gridiron. Broil over 
coals until of a nice brown. It will cook much better if cov- 
ered with a pie tin, pressed down with a weight, so that all 
parts of the chicken may lie close to the gridiron. While the 
chicken is broiling, boil the liver, gizzard and heart in a pint 
of water; when tender, chop fine, add flour, butter, pepper, 
salt. Stir a cup of sweet cream in the water in which the3' 
were boiled. When the chicken is cooked, dip it in the gravy 
while hot, return it to the gridiron for a minute, then put it 
in the gravy, boil half a minute, and serve hot. Cook quail 
in the same way. 

ROAST GOOSE 

Miss Parloa. 

Stuff the goose with a dressing made as follows: 
Potatoes boiled, peeled, and mashed fine and light; i table- 
spoon salt; I teaspoon pepper; i teaspoon sage; 2 tablespoons of 
onion juice; 2 of butter. Truss, and dredge well with salt, 
pepper and flour. Roast before the fire, (if weighing eight 



1^2 How We Cook in Los Angeles 

pounds), one and one-half hours; in the oven, one and one 
■quarter hours. Make gravy as for turkey. No butter is 
.required for goose, it is so fat. Serve with apple sauce. 

ROAST DUCK 

Miss Parloa. 

Ducks to be good must be cooked rare; for this reason it is 
best not to stuff. If you do stuff them use the goose dressing, 
and have it very hot. The better waj^ is to cut an onion in 
two, and put in the body of the bird, then truss, and dredge 
with salt, pepper and flour, and roast, if before the fire, forty 
minutes, if in the oven, thirty minutes. The fire must be very 
hot, and the oven a very quick one. Serve with currant jelly, 
and a sauce, made the same as for turke3\ 

ROASTED TEAL DUCK 

Mrs. Anna Ogier. 

Pick, clean, and hang the ducks two days. Make a stufi"- 
ing of bread crumbs, salt, pepper, onions, and a small piece of 
butter. Lay them in a pan, dredge with flour, pepper and 
salt. Baste frequently. 

HOW TO DRESS A DUCK DRY 

Mrs. Carl Schutze. 

The feathers of a duck can be easih' removed while the 
natural heat remains in it. 

Select a heavy piece of board, longer and broader than the 
bird. Drive two nails firmly in the top, and to these tie the 
duck securely, as soon as slaughtered. Set the board in slant- 
ing position on the table. Scald wings and tail that the 
larger feathers may be removed easily. Pick breast and back 
first. Work as rapidly as possible, using both hands. Hold 
the bird first by the wings, then bj^ the feet over a quick 
blaze so as to remove hairs. 

Place the edge of a knife-blade under pin-feathers and 
remove by grasping them between thumb and blade.

BREAKFAST QUAIL 

J. A. Graves. 

Prepare the birds by opening in the back, place them in a 
dripping pan, season with salt, pepper, and a generous supply 
of butter; add enough water to cover the bottom of the pan, 
then place them in a hot oven. Turn the birds frequently, 
basting them with the seasoned water in the pan, which 
gradually cooks down, making a fine gravy. By constant 
basting, the birds when well done and nicely browned, will be 
rich and juicy and of a finer flavor than when broiled. 

Serve on buttered toast. 

BROILED QUAIL 

Mrs. Adelia Hal!. 

Dress the birds carefully, and lay them a little time in 
salted water. Split down the back, dry with a cloth, rub with 
butter, and place them on a gridiron over a clear fire. Turn 
them frequently. Dip them in melted butter, seasoned with 
salt. Day slices of thin toast nicely buttered upon a hot dish, 
place a bird, breast upward, upon each slice. Garnish with 
currant jelly.

fitting cover. Add the water, pepper pods, a slice of bacon, 
salt and black pepper to taste. Cover and boil one hour, 
then add the onion quartered, the celery chopped, corn cut 
from the ear, tomatoes, and potatoes, and more water if 



/J/ How We Cook in Los Angeles 



required. Stew one hour and a half. Regulate the quantity 
of vegetables according to taste. Corn and tomatoes add 
much to the flavor. A few rabbits, quartered and cooked 
with the birds is an improvement. Canned corn maj^ be used 
if fresh is not in season. 

LARDED AND ROASTED GROUSE 

Mrs. Frank K. Phillips. 

Clean, and rinse quickly in cold water. Season with salt 
^and pepper. Dredge with butter and flour. Put one onion 
inside, roast half an hour in hot oven.

can be cooked in the same way. 

PIGEON PIE 

Everj'day Cook Book. 

Clean and truss three or four pigeons. Rub outside and 

inside with a mixture of pepper and salt. Fill with bread and 

butter stuffing or mashed potatoes. Sew them up. Butter, 

and line with pie crust, the sides of a pudding dish, and lay in 

the birds. For three large tame pigeons, cut quarter of a 

pound of sweet butter, strew this over them, with a large 

teaspoon of salt, a small teaspoon of pepper, and, if liked, 

some minced parsley. Dredge with a tablespoon of wheat 

flour, add water to nearly fill the pan, lay skewers across the 

top, cover with puff" paste crust. Cut a slit in the middle. 

Ornament the edge. Bake in a quick oven one hour, then 

brush the crust with the yolk of egg beaten with a little milk, 

and finish baking. All small birds may be cooked in this 

manner. 

WILD PIGE0N5 WITH OLIVES 

Mrs. E. F. C. Klokke. 

Clean, wash, and salt the pigeons. Brown them in hot but- 
ter, then stew them in broth or water for from fort^'-five to 
sixty minutes. Add broth or water from time to time to 
prevent burning. Bjil pickled olives in water for from five 
to ten minutes, add them to the grav\'; stew them, a few 
moments, and serve with the birds. 



Poultry and Game /jj 



ROAST WILD DUCK 

Mrs. W. G. W. 

Before roasting, parboil them, with a small peeled carrot 
placed in each; this will absorb the fishy flavor which most 
wild ducks have. When parboiled, throw away the carrots, 
and lay the ducks in fresh water half an hour. Dry, and 
stuff with bread crumbs seasoned with pepper, salt and sage 
(or onion.) Roast until brown and tender, basting alter- 
nately with butter and water, and the drippings. When the 
ducks are taken up, add a teaspoon of currant jelly and a 
pinch of cayenne pepper to the gravy; thicken with browned 
flour, and serve in a tureen. 



FRIED RABBIT 

Mrs. J. W. Hendricks. 

A young cottontail rabbit; bacon; flour; hot lard. 

Soak the rabbit four or five hours in strong, salt water. 
Cut in pieces suitable for frying. Roll in flour, and drop 
into hot lard, to which two or three good-sized pieces of 
bacon have been added. Season well. Cook thoroughly 
and it will be as nice as chicken. 



BARBECUED RABBIT 

Two tablespoons vinegar; i tablespoon made mustard; 
pepper, salt, butter, parsley. 

Clean and wash the rabbit; open it all the way on the 
under side. Lay it flat in salted water for half an hour. 
Wipe dry, and broil it, gashing the thick part of the back 
that the heat may penetrate it. When brown and tender, 
put it on a hot dish, add pepper, salt and butter; turning 
it over and over, that it may absorb the butter. Cover 
and set in the oven for five minutes. Heat the vinegar, 
and mustard; pour it over the rabbit; garnish with crisp 
parsley, and serve.

JACK RABBIT FRIED 

Mrs. Carl Schutze. 

Sufficient fat for cooking; a little chopped parsley; pepper, 
salt. 

Dress rabbit and soak over night in very salt water. 
Joint. Cut the back across the spine into pieces two inches 
thick. Wipe pieces as dry as possible and immerse in deep 
fat, very hot. Four minutes time will cook the thinner 
pieces, and eight minutes will be required for the joint of 
the hind leg if very large. Watch carefully that the pieces 
do not burn. When done, dredge with salt, pepper and 
parsley. Laj^ on butcher's paper that the fat may be ab- 
sorbed, and place in oven till ready for use. This way of 
cooking preserves the game taste liked by so many. 

JACK RABBIT FRICASSEE 

Mrs. Carl Schutze. 

One onion; a few pepper corns; a little cream; a piece 
of butter; salt. 

Dress rabbit, and soak over night in very salt water. 
When ready for use, joint; put it in a large saucepan with 
the onion, sliced, and sufficient water to cover. Boil five 
minutes before turning off the water. Season with salt 
and whole pepper corns. Remove rabbit and onion to a 
hot platter. Skim off pepper corns and thicken the gravy. 
Add cream and butter and boil once more before turning 
over the rabbit. 

SQUIRRELS 

Recipes for rabbit and squirrel are interchangeable. The 
large fat California squirrels have tender, savory meat. 



MEATS 



M. B. W. 



Meat should not be allowed to remain in the paper in 
which it is sent from the market; the paper imparts a dis- 
agreeable taste, aside from absorbing the juices. Meat 
should be cut across the grain of the muscle. If necessary 
to clean, scrape fresh meat, or wash all over with a clean, wet 
cloth. Do not place meat in water. Wipe perfectly dry 
before cooking. Never put meat directly on ice; hang, or 
place on a dish in the refrigerator, not in the ice chamber. 

Salt meats should be put to cook in cold water, fresh 
meats in boiling water. In boiling meats, if more water is 
required, add hot water, and be careful to keep the water on 
the meat constantly boiling. 

BEEF a la MODE— Southern Style 

Mrs. J. F. Couroy. 

Seven to lo lbs. beef round, shoulder is best; i table- 
spoon allspice; i tablespoon cinnamon; i tablespoon 
cloves; carrots, turnips, onions, garlic, bacon, fresh pork, i 
pint water. 

Bind the beef with a strip of muslin to keep in shape. 
Cut five turnips and five carrots in strips about three inches 
in length, and a third of an inch in width; boil them, but not 
so tender that they will break. Cut pork into strips of the 
same size, make incisions in the beef an inch apart, in each 
of these put a piece of pork, of carrot, and of turnip, which 
have been rolled in the mixed spices; use small bits of 
garlic occasionall}'. When all are filled place in a spider 
with a pint of water; dredge with flour; bake slowly two 
hours; then add to the pan whole onions, carrots, and turn- 
ips; lay small pieces of bacon on the beef; bake another

Remove the cloth from the beef, and serve it on a dish 
with the whole vegetables placed around it, and small pieces 
of fat on top. 

ROAST BEEF 

A. C. B. 

A sirloin or rib roast is best. Have the bones removed. 
Roll the meat and fasten in shape with skewers or tie with 
strong string. Place on a rack in a dripping pan and put in 
a very hot oven to sear it over in order to retain the juices. 
Keep the oven closed for about ten minutes, then open, 
dredge with flour, salt and pepper, and baste with the gravy. 
Turn the meat when necessary and baste often. Bake a six- 
pound roast one hour if liked rare, and an hour and a quarter 
if liked well done. Serve with gravy made from the drippings 
of the meat; or any favorite sauce. 

LARDED FILLET OF BEEF 

Mrs. M. B. Welch. 

The fillet must be well trimmed and freed from fat and 
skin. Then lard it neatly; put the trimmings of pork or 
bacon, with which you have larded it, in the bottom of the 
dripping pan; pour into the pan a cup of good beef stock, or 
hot water, though the stock is much the better; sprinkle salt 
and pepper over the fillet, put it in the pan, and bake from 
half to three-quarters of an hour, according to the size of the 
fillet, basting frequently, and adding, if necessary, a little 
stock occasionally. Serve with mushroom sauce.

Beat whites and yolks separately. Mix the ingredients 
into a smooth batter. Pour drippings from the roast into a 
baking dish, add the batter, and bake twenty minutes. 
Serve immediately. It is not good except it be hot. This is 
"better than the old waj- of baking in the pan with the roast. 

BROILED STEAK 

Mrs. R. M. Widney. 

Steak to be good should be at least three-fourth inch 
thick. Trim, put in double broiler, and cook over a bed of 
clear coals for ten minutes if you wish a rare steak, from 
twelve to fifteen for a well-done steak. Turn constantly. 
Serve on a hot platter with first-class butter, pepper and 
salt. Do not stick a knife or a fork into the meat as this 
injures it. Many serve with mushroom, tomato and other 
sauces.

Put the venison in a large kettle, cover with water, and 
boil until tender; drain off the water, put the butter with 
salt and pepper in the kettle, set over a moderate fire, and let 
brown, first on one side, and then on the other. Venison 
cooked in this way retains its natural flavor, and will be found 
delicious. 

HAH BONES 

Mrs. Jessie Beuton Fremont. 

"The Funeral of a Ham." This is the startling name 
the Germans give their final use of the unsightly "ham- 
bones" —too good still to be thrown away, but too ugly to 
bring to table. 

The bone, itself, goes into the soup kettle and from the 



/^/ How We Cook in Los Angeles 

broth it flavors, the}- take enough to stew gently, {boiling 
fast, kills flavors and hardens meat), the shavings of ham that 
had remained on the bone. 

Put these in the broth with a Chili pepper, a very little 
garlic, soup-herbs and a laurel leaf — pungent, but sparingly 
used flavors, and let them assimilate by slozv, steady heat. 
Then make mashed potatoes into a lining for a pudding- 
dish (you can also use boiled macaroni in the same way;) 
and lay in the stewed ham in light layers alternating 
with potatoes (or macaroni) and bake so it will look light 
and brown, like a potato souffle. There may be some 
baking powder to make the brown top crust and sides, or 
cream, (I really do not know how it is done, but it should 
be brown and raised like a nice dish of baked mashed 
potatoes) and sent to the table in the dish in which it was 
baked. It is simple enough — most excellent and flavoroiis, 
or only fit for a railway eating-station — according to the in- 
telligent patience of the cook. 

BAKED HAH 

Mrs. S. Speedy 

Scrape, and wash a nice, plump liam. Mix a paste of flour 
and water. Roll it out about an inch in thickness, cover the 
entire ham with this, wetting the edges to make them adhere. 
Bake three hours. 

BAKED HAfl 

Everyday Cook Book 

Wash and scrape the ham, then cover with cold water and 
simmer gently, until the skin can be pulled off (probably two 
or three hours). When skinned, and in the dripping pan, 
pour over it one teacup of vinegar, and one of hot water in 
which one teaspoon of mustard has been dissolved. Bake 
slowly two hours, basting often. Then cover the ham all 
over to the depth of an inch with brown sugar, pressing it 
down firmly. Set it in a very slow oven. The sugar will 
soon form a thick crust. It should remain in the oven a full 
hour. Then remove from the pan, drain, and place upon a 



Meats 7/5 

dish. When the ham is cool, but not cold, press it by turning 
another flat dish on top with a weight on it. Pressing makes 
the ham slice firmly. 

BOILED HAH 

Mrs. R. M. Widney 

Take a ham weighing from twelve to fourteen pounds, 
wash thoroughly, cover with cold water, and cook slowly, 
from five to six hours. When nearly cold, remove the ham 
from the water in which it boiled and draw off the skin. Have 
ready six or eight well rolled soda crackers, with which is 
mixed about three tablespoons of sugar; spread over ham, 
place in a moderately hot oven, for thirtj' or forty minutes. 

BROILED HAH 

Practical Housekeeping. 

Broil slices of ham on a hot gridiron until the fat runs 
out, and the meat is slightly brown ; then drop the slices into 
a pan of cold water, drain and return to the gridiron; repeat 
several times until the ham is done. Place on a hot platter; 
add a little butter, and serve at once. Pickled pork and 
breakfast bacon may be broiled in the same way. 

HAH FOR TOAST 

Mrs. S- C. Hubbell. 

One-fourth pound lean ham; i tablespoon cream or milk; 
I tablespoon melted butter; yolks of three eggs.

ROAST PIG 

Mrs. J. M. B. 

Select a pig from four to six weeks old. Clean it 
thoroughly using a teaspoon of soda in the water you wash 
the inside with. Wipe dry and stuff with a dressing made of 
bread crumbs highly seasoned with butter, sage, salt and 
pepper. Sew it up. Skewer the fore legs forward, and the 
hind legs backward. Rub it over with butter, and sprinkle 
with salt, pepper and flour. Put it in a dripping pan with a 
little water and bake about three hours, basting often. It is 
not necessar)^ to have the oven very hot at first; be careful 
not to let it burn. When done, place it on a platter; garnish 
with parsley and put an apple or small ear of corn in its 
mouth. 

ROAST 5PARE RIBS 

Trim off the rough ends; crack the ribs across the middle, 
rub with salt, sprinkle with pepper, fold over, stuff with plain 
turkey dressing. Sew up tightly, put in dripping pan with a 
pint of water. Baste frequently, turning once, so that both 
sides may be of a rich brown. 

TO FRY TRIPE 

Take prepared tripe, wash and wipe dry. Cut it four 
inches square; dip first in ^"g^, then in flour; fry slowly to a 
delicate brown, in butter. Add to the gravy a wine-glass 
each of vinegar and water; boil up and pour over the dish 
with the tripe. 

BROILED TRIPE 

Prepare tripe as for frying; lay on a broiling iron over a 
clear fire; let broil gently on both sides; Serve on a hot 
platter with plenty of butter. Garnish with lemon or parsley.

Take twelve or fifteen pounds of beef, cut from the round; 
cut it into four pieces; put into a jar or cask, and cover with 
brine made as follows: To one gallon boiling water, dissolve 
rock salt until, when cold, a fresh ^^^ will float. Turn a 
plate over the meat, and press it down with a stone. One 
teaspoon of saltpetre will give the meat a red color. In about 
four days, pour off the brine, boil, skim, and cool, and pour 
over the meat again. Six days will corn thoroughly. 



SAUCES 



M. B. W. 



Sauces are often a failure, because the flour is not sufii- 
ciently cooked. When the flour and water are mixed and 
added to the boiling liquid, the sauce should boil at least ten 
minutes. 

A quicker and better way is to cook the dry flour in the 
hot butter, thus insuring a smooth sauce, free from grease, 
and of excellent flavor.

VEGETABLES 



A C. B. 



All vegetables are best when fresh and crisp; celery, 
lettuce, cucumbers, and radishes should be kept in cold 
water. New potatoes should be prepared just before cooking 
and put on in boiling water. Old potatoes should be peeled 
and put into cold water an hour before cooking; then drain 
off the water and put into cold water and set over the 
fire; when they are barely done, drain off the water and set 
on back of the stove. A small quantity of caj'enne pepper 
put into the water when cooking cabbage and onions will 
somewhat neutralize the disagreeable odor. 

ASPARAGUS ON TOAST 

Mrs. G. W. White. 

Asparagus; soda; salt; pepper; butter; cream or milk; 
toasted bread.

leaves, trim awa}' the lower leaves, and the ends of the others. 
Cook in boiling salted water, with the tops downward, half 
an hour. Drain, remove the choke — or internal filamentous 
portion — and serve with drawn butter. 

BEETS 

Mrs. Henderson. 

Be careful not to prick, or cut the skin before cooking, as 
the}^ will then lose their color. Put them into boiling water, 
and boil until tender. If they are served hot, season them 
with butter, pepper, and salt; if cold, slice and pour vinegar 
over them, or cut in dice, and mix with other cold vegetables 
for a salad. 

STRING BEANS 

Mrs. W. B. Abernethy 

One and a half quarts beans; i small onion; i tablespoon

stirring once or twice to prevent burning; then cover with 
boiling water and cook until tender. If the water needs 
replenishing be sure it is boiling. When cooked season with 
salt, pepper, and teaspoon sugar, and sift in a little flour.

CAKE 



Miss Farmer, Boston Cooking School. 



In making cake only the best materials should be used ; 
and these, with accurate measurements and care in baking, 
can hardl}' fail to produce good results. 

Pastry flour should always be used, and fine granulated 
sugar, unless otherwise specified. If bread flour is used 
instead of the pastry, less is required ; allowing a difference 
of one tablespoonful for each cupful called for by the recipe. 
The materials should first be brought together and prepared 
and the pans buttered. Use clarified butter for this, procuring 
it b}' melting the butter and carefully turning it off so that 
the salt which sinks to the bottom, may be left behind. It is 
easier to use a small brush in buttering. The pans may be 
papered, if liked, but a thin dusting of flour is just as good, 
dredging the pan with flour and then shaking out all that 
one can, leaving only as much as will be taken up by the 
butter, which will be only a fine dust. Square or round pans 
are best for cake, as they are more easily handled and the 
cake bakes more evenly. The cake should not be poured into 
the pan, but put in by spoonfuls, one in- each corner first and 
then in the center, smoothing it over and having the sides 
and corners, if anything higher than the center, as they will 
cook quicker and shrink more. For baking cake a rather 
moderate oven is required for most kinds. 

No thermometer has as yet been invented which can satis- 
factorily test the heat of the oven, and it must be tested by 
the hand or by flour, which if nicely browned in five minutes, 
will show the temperature to be just right. If too hot, the 
heat may be reduced in any way most convenient, not, 
however, by placing water in the oven unless absolutely 
necessary as the moisture generated will interfere with the 



Cake J g^ 

proper baking of the cake. Baking cake may be divided into 
four stages. In the first quarter the cake should begin to rise. 
In the second, it should rise more and brown slightly. In 
the third it should rise to its full height, double its height 
when first put in the oven, and brown more. In the fourth 
quarter it should finish baking and shrink from the pan, 
which shows it is done. This last test does not apply to bride 
or pound cake, which should be tested with the finger. If it 
leaves a depression the cake is not thoroughly baked, but if it 
is firm to the touch it is done. A cake should be watched 
carefully in the baking, timing by the clock, and turning the 
cake as often as necessary; only making sure that each motion 
is a gentle one.

PUDDINGS AND THEIR SAUCES 



BOILED PUDDINGS 

Miss K. R. Paxtoii. 

Grease the mold very thoroughly and there will be no 
danger of sticking. Do not fill the mold as room must be 
allowed for the pudding to swell. Put the mold into a kettle 
of boiling water. It is not necessary for the water to cover 
the mold; half way to the top of mold is sufficient; when the 
water gets too low, replenish with boiling water. The kettle 
must be covered with a tight fitting lid to keep in steam. 
Put a flat-iron on the lid to keep it down tight. On no ac- 
count, allow the water to stop boiling. If pudding is boiled 
in a bag, dip it in boiling water, wring, sprinkle with flour, 
tie up the pudding in the bag leaving room for it to swell. 

Bavarian creams, gelatine, corn starch, or any pudding 
served in a form; wet mold with cold water; pour out water 
but do not wipe the mold; pour in pudding and put in cold 
place; when ready to serve, turn it out in dish. 

PLUM PUDDING 

Mrs. J. P. Widuey.

spoon cinnamon; i small teaspoon salt; ^ pound currants; 
^ pound candied lemon or orange peel — chopped; 3 pints 
milk; ^ cup butter; 6 eggs; i nutmeg; i pound stoned 
raisins; ^ pound citron — chopped fine. 

Pour the milk over the cracker crumbs, beat the yelks of 
the eggs, sugar and butter until light, and add them. Stir 
in all the fruit, first adding to it a trifle of flour, to prevent 
its sticking. Add the beaten whites of eggs last. Butter a 
large mold, or two smaller ones, and put in pudding, leaving 
room for rising. Cover close and steam five hours. Serve 
with hot sauce, or cold hard sauce. 

This has proved most excellent, and is enough for 18 per- 
sons.

spice and cinnamon to flavor. (The brown sugar and spice 
give the requisite color), after which put on a prettily per- 
forated top crust, and bake in a very quick oven a few 
moments. 

The deception was most complete and readily accepted. 
Apples at this early date were a dollar a pound, and we 
young people all craved a piece of mother's apple pie to 
appease our homesick feelings.

CREAMS AND CUSTARDS 



K. R. P. 



Wherever we mention milk or cream in the following 
recipes, it is self-understood that we speak of the ordinary 
unprepared article. As, however, pure concentrated milk, 
commercially known as Highland Brand Evaporated Cream, 
is largely used in many families to the exclusion of all other 
forms of milk, owing to its uniform wholesome qualities, 
besides its convenience and economy, our book would not be 
complete without giving directions for its use. 

As it is simply pure milk partially dessicated, the addition 
of about three parts of water to one part of Highland Evapor- 
ated Cream restores it to its original fluidity, and after thus 
diluting it, you may use it in precisely the same manner, for 
either cooking or drinking as ordinary milk. 

For coffee or cocoa it may be used undiluted, about two 
teaspoons to the cup. 

As a dressing for fruits, cereal foods, etc., it should be 
diluted with about two parts of water, which gives it the rich- 
ness of cream, 

A mixture of one part of Highland Evaporated Cream to 
about four parts of ordinary milk also answers instead of 
dairy cream for ice cream and other purposes. 

GENERAL DIRECTIONS FOR ICE CREAM. 

MISS K. R. PAXTON. 

For the best ice cream only the best materials should be 
used. Good cream, granulated sugar, ripe fruit or the best 
flavoring extracts. Do not use milk, corn starch, gelatine or 
eggs, except for Neapolitan cream. Half the cream should be 
scalded, as it makes a smoother frozen cream. If extract is 
used dissolve the sugar in the scalding cream. If ripe fruit 
is used dissolve one-half sugar in the scalding cream and mix 
the other half with the fruit. Flavoring and fruit should be 



Creams and Cnsiards 2^^ 

added when the cream is nearly frozen, that is, when it turns 
hard. 

For a four-quart freezer about ten pounds of ice and four 
pounds of rock salt will be required. Chip the ice in a tub 
with an ice chipper, or else put it in a coarse sack and pound 
with a mallet. Mix the ice and salt. Place the freezing can 
in the tub being careful to put the ball of the can in the socket 
of the tub; put in dasher, pour in mixture (scalded cream and 
sugar dissolved in it, and the unscalded cream), put on cover, 
fasten on crank, then turn the handle to see if it works prop- 
erly, then pack with the ice and salt, pounding it down solid. 
Turn slowly and steadily until it turns a little hard, take off 
cover and add flavoring or else the sweetened, strained fruit, 
cover, turn until you can turn it no longer, take out dasher, 
scrape it off and work the cream well with a wooden paddle 
for about ten minutes. Put on cover, put cork in dasher hole, 
repack with ice and salt, cover with a piece of old carpet, and 
let it stand an hour or two before using. If it is to be molded, 
fill the molds with cold water, pour out water but do not wipe. 
Pack in the frozen cream after you have worked it well — close 
the molds and bind with strips of muslin dipped in melted 
butter, then bury in ice and salt for an hour or more. When 
ready to serve wash off the molds with cold water, and the 
cream will soon slip out.

a silver fork tear it into small pieces. Mix the remainder of 
the sugar with this, stirring often until sugar is dissolved. 
When the scalded cream is cold, put in the can with the 
remainder of the cream and freeze. When it begins to turn 
hard, add the pineapple and sugar, to which has been added 
half the rind and juice of orange, finish freezing, remove dasher 
and beat according to directions.

a frosting of the whites of the eggs, and spread over the top, 
sprinkle a little sugar over and brown in oven. 

IV10US5ES 

Miss Parloa. 

This dish is really a mossy froth. Whip cream and drain 
it, for if there is any liquid cream in the mousse it will not be 
perfect. Pack the mold in salt and ice, using five pints of salt 
for a gallon mold. Put the mousse preparation into the mold, 
cover and set away for four or six hours. Six hours is always 
best. If the mold be lined with white paper, the mousse will 
have a smoother and handsomer appearance when turned out 
on a dish, but it takes a little longer to freeze. It is a great 
improvement to line the bottom and sides of the mold with a 
sherbet that will combine with the flavor of the mousse.

BEVERAGES 



DIRECTIONS FOR MAKING TEA 

H. Jevue. 

To make a perfect cup of tea, the water must be fresh and 
quickly boiled, and the teapot hot — an earthen one being 
preferable. 

Put one teaspoonful of tea for each pint of water into the 
warm pot, pour in the boiling water and let stand from three 
to four minutes on the back part of the stove. Never allow 
to boil. 

Serve tea from the first infusion, and, if a second cup is 
wanted, make fresh tea, unless you have transferred the 
liquid from the leaf before the tannin has had time to be 
extracted. 

Tea is a healthful beverage, if made and used as above; 
but as commonly used by the majority, it can be properly 
called a soup made of tea leaves. There is also more danger 
of too large a quantity of leaf being used than too little. 
Very few people like a strong tea. 

Avoid cheap teas, as one pound of good quality will go as 
far as two pounds of common, if used intelligently, 

CARE OF COFFEE POT 

Mrs. R. M. Widuey. 

Never allow cold coifee or grounds to remain in the coffee 
pot. Empty, wash thoroughly and dry well, as soon as the 
meal at which you have used coffee is over. If cold cofi"ee 
remains, it can be used to wet the coffee for next time, A 
fruitful cause of poor coffee is a poorly-kept coffee pot, 

CHURCH SOCIAL COFFEE 

Mrs. W. J. Horner. 

Half pound coffee; i gallon boiling water; i egg. 
Put coffee in a bag and boil three or four minutes. 



Beverages 2^g 

COFFEE 

Mrs. W. B. Abernethy. 

Use a mixture of 'ji Java and ]/>> Mocha, finely ground. 
Allow I heaping tablespoon of ground coffee for each cup, 
and for each four cups of coffee add % teaspoon chicory. In 
the evening prepare the coffee for breakfast, by mixing the 
required quantity with the white of &%%. Add enough cold 
water to cover and let stand till morning, in a closely- covered 
bowl. Put the mixture in the coffee pot which mtist. be kept 
clean and dry. Add i cup cold water and let come to the boil, 
then pour in the required amount of boiling water, and put 
where it will keep verj' hot but not boil. If for dinner, mix 
six hours before the meal is served. 

COFFEE 

Mrs. I. R. Dunkelberger. 

Equal weights of Mocha and Java make the best coffee. 
To make one quart coffee, grind one large cup of coffee. Put 
into pot with one ^ZZ'^ ^"^ sufficient cold water to moisten. 
Let it stand till the coffee swells; then pour on boiling water, 
and let it stay over fire till it reaches the boiling point; take 
off; let stand five minutes; turn off into another pot, and 
send to table to be served with boiled cream.

Serve a piece of orange in each glass. 

RASPBERRY VINEGAR 

Mrs. E. F. Speiice. 

Three pounds raspberries to i quart white wine vinegar. 
Put in stone jar for three days. Strain through flannel bag. 
To each pint juice, one pound cube sugar. Place over a 
gentle fire. Boil ten minutes. Bottle, seal and keep in a 
cool place. Blackberry vinegar may be made in same way — 
allowing 5^4 pounds sugar to 3 pints juice. 

Mixed with ice-water makes a delicious drink for warm 
weather. 

STRAWBERRY VINEGAR 

Mrs. Wm. J. Robinson, Monctou, Canada. 

Let one gallon strawberries stand 48 hours in one quart 
cider vinegar; then mash and strain, and add one pound 
sugar to every pound juice. Put it over the fire and let it 
simmer very slowly for half an hour. Skim well, bottle, and 
when cold, cork tight. 

I have kept this for two years.

RECIPE FOR PRESERVING ORANGES 

sister Imnianuel. 

Five dozen oranges; lo gallons water; 2 pounds common 
salt. 

The oranges should be of good size — thick skinned, and 
not too ripe. Grate the surface lightly. Place them in a shal- 
low vessel, so that they are not crowded, and let them come to 
a boil in the water and salt. Take out carefully, and throw 
them into fresh cold water. Set them in a cool place, changing 
the water every two hours, for three days. The second day 
remove the seeds and juice, but not the pulp. This can be 
done by making an incission in one end of the oranges. Con- 
tinue to change the water every two hours, wiping each orange 
dry with a coarse towel, and pressing out the water after each 
change. Do this gently. Prepare a syrup as follows: 

Syrup — first day. Five gallons water; 3^ pound white 
sugar to one pound fruit. Boil over a slow fire three hours, 
then take out the fruit and let it drip. 

Second day — Make a new syrup. Five gallons water; one 
pound sugar to one pound fruit. The oranges must be put in 
the syrup when it is cold, then brought to a boil. (If fruit is 
put in hot syrup, the surface is toughened like leather). Take 
out fruit and let drip. 

Third day — Make a new syrup. Pound for pound, boil to 
the consistency of thick molasses. When cold put in the 
oranges. They are now ready for use or for jars. 

lycmons and citrons are prepared in the same way.

How to riake Crystallized Chinese Oranges. 

Mrs. Juan Foster. 

Take oranges not quite ripe, cut oflF the colored part of the 
rind carefully with a sharp knife; cut a hole where the stem 
has been, sufficiently large to take out all the inside. Be care- 
ful not to change the form of the orange. When they are 
clean inside and outside, cover them with water and salt for 
24 hours. Then change the water, but this time omit the 
salt. Do this for five or six days, or until all the bitterness 
has disappeared. Then put them in boiling water and boil for 
twenty minutes; then put them immediately in cold water; 
then allow them to drain while preparing the syrup. The 
syrup is made by putting equal quantities by weight of sugar 
and fruit in enough water to give the consistency of ordinary 
S3'rup. Boil the fruit in the syrup over a slow fire until the 
syrup attains the consistency of 'Sxoufty. Take the fruit out 
and let it dry in a convenient place. 

Small lemons or limes are crj'stallized by the same process, 

except that thej^ are simply cut in two before being placed in 

the brine. 

LEMON PRESERVES 

Maria de los Doniinguez de Francis. 

Ten pounds fruit; 10 pounds sugar; y^. gallon water. 

Grate the lemons well. Make an incision in one end. Put 
them in water, with two pounds of salt, and boil them a few 
minutes. Then throw them immediately into cold water. 
Wash, and squeeze them slightl3\ Keep them in cold water 
two days, changing the water twelve times each day, so that 
the juice and seeds will come out — the last time — squeeze 
them again, drain, and dry on a towel. The day before they 
are to be cooked, prepare the sj'rup, boil, skim, and cool it 
over night. In the morning, put the lemons which have been 
drained and dried, into the cold syrup, and boil them seven or 
eight hours. 



PRESERVE OF ORANGE OR LEMON FLOWERS 

ording to the Formula of Don Diego Granada, Chief Cook of His Majesty, the 
King Don Felipe III. 

Take the flowers from the tree when the}- are well opened; 



2'j8 How We Cook in Los Angeles 

wash them, boil them for a little while; change the water and 

boil them again until they are very tender. Take them out 

of this last water and when the flowers are cool, open them 

one by one as you would a book. Put them in a vessel (olla) 

with their weight of sugar and a little musk. Stir them 

up with the sugar, slowly; put them over a slow fire until the 

sugar thickens, spread them on a marble table, separate the 

flowers one from another as rapidly as possible, and allow to 

dry. 

TO PRESERVE FIGS WHOLE 

Marie de la Domingues de Francis. 

One-half cup lime; i bucket water; syrup for lo lbs figs 
made of lo fts sugar; i gal. water, cold. 

Use half ripe figs, prick them twice with a fork. Stand 
them in the lime water over night, in the morning wash, and 
throw them into cold water, drain them. When the syrup 
has boiled and been well skimmed, put over the figs and cook 
them very slowly seven or eight hours, 

PRESERVE OF HUSKMELON 

Mrs. Juan Foster. 

Take a melon not quite ripe, cut it into longitudinal 
pieces; cut away the rind and the white nearest to the rind 
and throw away; soak what is left for three days in salted 
water. Then put them in clear water for six days, changing 
the water every day. Then boil them until they are tender, 
rub them in cold water, drain them until all the superfluous 
moisture has disappeared. Then put them in a round 
earthen vessel (olla), cover them with clarified sugar (com- 
mon syrup), and leave them for eight days, so as to absorb 
the syrup. After this boil them in the syrup for about one 
hour over a slow fire and keep them in a proper place. If 
you wish you can put any kind of essence you prefer, or 
none at all. 

TO CURE OLIVES 

Mrs. Isabel del Valle, of Camulos. 

Cut the olives from the tree when they are not over-ripe. 
Put them in fresh water and change it every third day until 



Spanish Department 2j^ 

the bitterness is removed. Prepare a lye of wood ashes and 
if possible let it be the ashes of grape vines, as experience 
has taught that this is the best. They should remain in this 
lye twenty -four hours. Take them from it and put them in 
salt water and keep for use. 

HOW TO MAKE OIL FROM OLIVES 

Mrs. Juan Foster. 

Cut the olives from the tree when quite ripe; keep them 
for three weeks in the dark, mill them; put the paste in sacks, 
strong but porous; press them and you have oil of the best 
quality. To have a second grade of oil put the paste, after 
being pressed, in hot water, and press it again. This water 
mixed with the oil should be put in jars or pans, and when 
the oil comes to the top it must be taken off and filtered and 
put in bottles. 

If you add a little salt to the oil before filtering you will 
be repaid for the trouble. 

CHILI SAUCE 

Mrs. W. H. Workman. 

Dry red peppers; onions; salt. 

Remove the seeds from the peppers; soak them in boiling 
water until soft; remove the skins by rubbing them through a 
coarse sieve; season with salt, and a small quantity of finely 
chopped onions. If too thick add water. Use as a sauce, or 
in gravies, and stews. 

CHILI COLOROW

RAISIN MAKING IN CALIFORNIA 



James Boyd, Riverside, Cal. 



Our best table raisins are made from a white grape called 
the Muscat of Alexandria, and by some the Muscatel. Our 
seedless raisins come from the large clusters of raisins picked off 
in packing, also from the broken clusters when putting them 
through the stemmer preparatory to assorting and packing. 
There is also a seedless grape called the Sultana, which makes 
a very excellent raisin for cakes, etc. The Sultana, as well as 
a new variety of seedless grapes called the Thompson's Seed- 
less, do well in California. The Zante currant which is made 
from a small, seedless black grape, has not so far been success- 
fully grown in California. These varieties of grapes, which 
are natives of Europe, do not succeed in the States beyond the 
Rocky mountains, for climatic reasons. 

Our California grapes are grown in the same way that the 
native grape is grown in the Eastern States, except that we do 
not trellis them or need to protect them in winter, and in 
pruning, which is done every spring, they are cut back so that 
they look like a row of dry stumps until they start growing in 
the spring when the vineyards look beautiful in their rich 
green. 

The grapes begin to ripen in August, but for raisin making 
they have to be very ripe, and are not fit to make into raisins 
until thej^ are rich and full of sugar. Grapes that are fit to 
make into raisins require to be very solid and fleshy, unlike 
wine grapes, that require plenty of juice. When picking, 
which is usually well along in September and early in October, 
all imperfect berries are removed from the clusters and the 
bunches are then laid on trays, which are made of thin lumber 
the size being usuall}' two feet b}^ three feet. They are left in 
the sun for the curing process, until the exposed surfaces begin 
to shrivel, which happens generally in ten days or two weeks, 



Raisin Making J05 



when they are turned by simply placing an empty tray on top 
of a full one and reversing the two, when the fresh surface is 
left exposed to the sun for about two weeks longer, or until 
they are properly cured, when they are slidden ofif the trays 
into large boxes called sweat boxes; where they are kept until 
the moisture is equalized through the whole and the stems get 
tough, when they are ready for packing. 

The packing is usually done in large packing houses by 
firms who make a business of packing and marketing the 
fruit. The packing is usuallj'- done by women and girls for all 
choice fruit, but for loose raisins which are generally shipped in 
sacks; machinery is much used for stemming and cleaning, 
and men usually do this part of the work. 

In the early years of raisin making everything was packed 
in boxes, but now much of the fruit is put in sacks to save ex- 
pense for boxes and packing. 

The process of raisin making is clean and agreeable all 
through. The production has increased so within the last five 
years, that California furnishes nearly enough to supply the 
whole of the United States. Owing to lack of co-operation 
among the growers, the business is not as remunerative as 
in former years, but steps are being taken to remedy the evil 
complained of. 



DRIED FIGS 



As Prepared by D. H. Burnham, Riverside. Contributed by 

Mrs. lOLA M. COLBURN. 



Use White Smyrna, or some thin-skinned variety of white 
fig, thoroughly ripe when picked, and must be dried quickly. 
Use raisin trays for drying. All trays filled during the day 
are placed that night in the bleaching house and subjected to 
the fumes of a little burning brimstone; other nights, if 
there is any dampness at all, they should be covered. In the 
morning they are placed in the sun. When partially cured 
turn in trays, same as raisins. Only a few days is required 
to dry them if the weather is good. Watch carefully so as 
not to let them get too dry, as that spoils them. Go over the 
trays and pick them out as soon as cured. The better the fig 
the sooner it is cured. When taken from trays they are put in 
large sacks of cotton cloth like flour sacks, and put in a cool 
place to sweat. While still moist and pliable from sweating 
they should be packed in boxes and pressed. The main 
points to be considered are, i, The quality of the fresh fig. 2, 
Its thorough ripeness. 3, Bright, perfectly dry weather. 4, 
The care which does not allow them to get too dry. 

Figs cured in this way are excellent without the bleach- 
ing process, and are preferred by many for their own use. 

While in the business, Mr. Burnham took the first pre- 
mium for several 3^ears at the Riverside Citrus Fairs, on his 
cured figs. 



SMALL FRUITS 



F. Edward Gray, Alhambra 



They who possess a home in Southern California, be it city 
lot, suburban acre or extensive ranch, naturally aim to make 
it attractive. 

Not the least among the means of making it such, within 
or without, is a well maintained small fruit garden. 

With straw, black and raspberries properly cared for, 
growing within the home enclosure, the good housekeeper 
always has the wherewithal at hand to brighten up her table 
and please the taste of her most fastidious guest. 

THE BLACKBERRY 

Although dark of hue this branch is by no means the 
black sheep of the berr)' family. It keeps you at a respectable 
distance with its vicious thorns, but after careful persistency 
you will find it as attractive and beautiful as any of its kin. 

There is one thing about the blackberry, the most decided 
ill treatment will not kill it. Once plant it in your garden, it 
will remain there forever, and a da3^ 

It requires a sunny place, succeeding best in a light soil, 
possibly not so rich as the raspberry as it has a tendency to 
rankness. 

Set out as early in winter as possible. If 5'ou need more 
than one row, allow six feet between each row, with plants 
three feet apart in the rows. They require more room than 
the raspberry, and should have support. Stakes at the ends 
of the rows with wires stretched from end to end will sustain 
them nicely. 

Keep the growth down to three feet, if possible, more can 
be done with the thumb and finger at the right time than 
with pruning shears after neglect. Pinch back the green 



joS How We Cook in Los Angeles 

canes in early May and June with a result that you will have 
better shaped plants and a greater abundance of fruit. 

Two varieties is all that is necessary and will give you 
more than you and your neighbors' children will need. 

Crandall's Early is not only an excellent berry and prolific 
bearer but will ripen three weeks earlier than any other and- 
last some times as late as December, but this is not desirable 
as it is not the berry for preserving and canning, as is the 
Kittatinny, for under good culture this latter variety is very 
large, sweet, rich and melting when fully ripe. It reaches its 
best condition if allowed to ripen on the vines. 

THE STRAWBERRY 

To make a success of your strawberry patch, the ground 
should be thoroughly cultivated and pulverized; properly 
deepened and enriched. A sandy loam will give the most 
satisfactory results. No shade, and an abundance of mois- 
ture are some of the chief needs of the strawberry. 

Two hundred plants will be sufiicient for an ordinary fam- 
ily. Procure young plants; set them out in the fall or win- 
ter just before the first rains, and you will get quick returns 
of the luscious fruit. 

Select equal proportions of the "Monarch and "Sharp- 
less" varieties and you will have berries every month in the 
year. 

Prepare the ground in ridges, say from twelve to fifteen 
inches apart, according to the volume of water at your com- 
mand. Set the plants one foot apart on top of the ridge. In 
planting, excavate a place for each plant sufficiently large to 
put the roots, spread out, down their whole length; fill and 
press earth firmly; be careful that crown of plant does not go 
below the surface. 

Set a new bed every year with thrifty young plants. Pull 
up old plants after two years' bearing. 

THE RASPBERRY 

To succeed with this crimson, melting berry, prepare the 



Small Fruits jog 



ground as thoroughly and in same manner as for the straw- 
berry, using care not to overfertilize, 

Kstablish your row of plants where they will have partial 
shade, along a fence or hedge, if possible. Plant them out 
as early as possible in the winter to receive the full benefit of 
the rains, cutting back the old canes six inches from the 
surface. 

Keep the ground level, don't let it bank up against the 
plants, mulch well with hay or long grass to preserve the 
moisture. Support the plants with stakes. Be liberal with 
water and you will have fruit every day — and for Christmas. 

As for variety, none will give such general satisfaction as 
the Cuthbert, deservedly known as the "Queen of the Mar- 
ket." The berries are of the largest size; very firm; deep 
rich crimson; flavor excellent and very prolific. 

Don't waste time and space in planting out the the Black 
Cap varieties; they will not do well in this climate and only 
produce sour fruit and bitter disappointment. 



FRUITS 



Mrs. W. J. Brown 



Fruit should be carefully selected for canning or preserving 
and should be used as soon as possible after it is picked. 
Berries should be preserved the same day they are picked. 
Pears, peaches and apricots should be firm but not fully ripe 
as they then retain their shape and have abetter flavor. Use 
only the best granulated sugar for putting up fruit or making 
jellies. To prevent fruit from fading or being injured by the 
chemical action of the light through the glass jar, wrap two 
or three thicknesses of paper around jars. The most satis- 
factory way of canning fruit after it is prepared is to place 
it with care in glass jars, until they are full, then fill to 
about an inch of the top with rather hot syrup prepared with 
the right quantity of sugar as given in the general directions 
which follow; fasten on the covers tight enough to lift by, but 
not air tight, then place several thicknesses of cloth on the 
bottom of the boiler to prevent the jars breaking; set the jars 
in and fill to about two or three inches of the tops of the jars 
with tepid water, and boil the required length of time accord- 
ing to general directions — that is after the water commences 
to boil rapidly in the boiler. When cooked, take out, being 
careful to cover the jar that the air may not strike it, 
or it will break; set on a folded towel wet with cold water, 
remove the cover and fill with hot syrup, or if the required 
amount of sugar has been used, fill with boiling water; see 
that there are no air bubbles in the jar, fasten on the cover 
securely, invert the jar and and let it stand twenty-four 
hours. If the fruit is sufficiently cooked, the rubbers good, 
and the jars air tight, your fruit will keep indefinitely. 

As jellies and jams grow dark by cooking after the sugar 
is added, boil the fruit or juice well before adding the sugar, 
which should be heated in the oven but not allowed to brown. 



Fruits 



Sn 



When the jelly is read}' to remove from the fire, have 
ready a heated pitcher with a piece of cheese cloth, wet with 
hot v;ater, over the top; pour the jelly through the strainer; 
and if the cloth is wrung out of hot water, there will be no 
waste of jelly. Have the glasses standing in a pan of hot 
water; take them out and drain a moment and turn the jell)' 
in from the pitcher; or if a silver teaspoon is placed in the glass 
and then the jelly poured in, there will be no danger of the 
glass cracking. 

It is thought by some that fruit must be sweetened in 
order to keep from spoiling, but such is not the case. Fruit 
properly cooked, put up while boiling hot in air tight jars 
will keep just as well as the sweetened; and is preferable when 
intended for pie-making. 

The fruit closet should be cool and dry; if too warm, the 
fruit may spoil; if too damp, it will mold. Jars of fruit should 
be examined two or three days after filling; if any of the 
syrup leaks out, they should be opened and the fruit used for 
jam, as it will have lost its delicacy of color and flavor — an 
item so desirable in canned fruits.

CANNED BLACKBERRIES AND RASPBERRIES 

Mrs. W. J. Brown. 

[yook over the fruit carefully, drop into a pan of cold water; 
remove from water with the hands, let drain, then fill 
the jars; add the syrup and follow the preceeding "General 
Directions." 

FOR CANNING BLACKBERRIES 

Mrs. S. H. Fairchild. 

Put the berries in a vessel with a little water to create 
steam and sufficient to boil; add one teacup sugar to every two 
lbs of berries. Make a batter of one tablespoon flour and a 
little water to every quart of fruit, after being cooked, beat 
thoroughly until it is perfectly free from lumps; when berries 
come to a boil, stir in batter very gently to avoid mashing 
them. Use care at this point to prevent burning; when they 
are of the thickness of syrup, can immediately. Berries put 
up in this way keep better and have a more natural flavor 
than when put up in any other way. Raspberries and ripe 
currants may be canned in the same manner with equal 
success — currants requiring more sugar. 

CANNED STRAWBERRIES AND GOOSEBERRIES

according to general directions. 

CANNED SWEET CORN 

O. G. M. 

Take fresh, sweet corn, when tender, and cut from the 
cob before cooking; put in glass jars and pack it tight; when 
full, fasten covers sufficiently to keep out the water. Place 
several thicknesses of cloth on bottom of boiler; pack in the 
jars, one over the other, and cover them with cold water.

mash well in in an earthen dish and add i pound best granu- 
lated sugar to each pound or pint of fruit. Put the berries 
in a porcelain or granite preserving kettle and boil fifteen 
minutes, add the sugar, (which should be heated in the oven) 
and boil fifteen minutes longer, stirring often to prevent 
burning. If the fruit is very juicy, it may require to boil ^ 
of an hour. Put in jelly glasses or fruit jars.

PINE APPLE JAH 

Mrs. W. J. Brown. 

Pare the pine apple carefully; grate it, and add Y\ pound 
granulated sugar to a pound of fruit. Boil about fifteen min- 
utes and seal in glass jars. 

CURRANT JAM 

A. C. B. 

Remove the currants from the stems, crush them and boil 
fifteen minutes. Add the same quantity of sugar heated and 
cook but fifteen minutes longer, being careful not to burn. 

PEACH BUTTER 

Mrs. Wm. F. Marshall. 

Use thoroughly-ripe peaches; pare them; remove the 
stones and take pound for pound of peaches and sugar. Cook 
the peaches until they are soft, then add half the sugar and 
boil half an hour; then add the remainder of the sugar, and 
boil an hour and a half, stirring constantly to prevent burn- 
ing. If the flavor of the peach stone is desired, crack some 
of the stones, boil a few minutes in a small quantity of water, 
and add to the fruit, or season with cinnamon and cloves, if 
preferred. 

APPLE AND PEAR BUTTER 

Mrs. M. G. Moore. 

One peck each apples ^nd pears; ^ dozen quinces; 5 
pounds lightest brown sugar. 

Pare, core and cut into pieces the apples and pears; add 
the quinces and boil, stirring often till smooth and rich in 
coloring, then add the sugar and stir constantly till the 
bubbles gather in the middle and cook outwardly. Put in 
earthen jars and keep in a cool, dry place. The sun must 
not be allowed to fall upon it. 

APPLE BUTTER 

Mrs. R. W. Widney. 

Ten gallons cider; i bushel apples. 

The day before making the butter, boil the cider down 
one-half. The apples should be peeled, cored, and put in the 



j/(5 How We Cook in Los Angeles 

boiled-down cider, as rapidly as possible in the earlj^ morning 
of the day in which the butter is made. At first it will be 
necessary to stir only every few moments; later on, as the 
apples are dissolved, the butter should be stirred constantly. 

In the absence of the great copper kettles that our grand- 
mothers used, I usually get a large new, tin wash-boiler. 
The butter should be cooked until when taken out the cider 
will not separate, but the whole be a thick, smooth 
substance — a butter indeed. The cooking requires a full day. 
The butter burns or scorches so easily that it is necessary to 
constantly stir, so as to scrape the entire surface of the bot- 
tom of the kettle. 

APPLE AND QUINCE CHEESE 

Mrs. C. C. Thomas. 

Six pounds quinces; 3 pounds apples; 4 pounds white 
sugar. 

Prepare as for preserving. Cook the quinces first in 
enough water to cover. When tender, add the apples and 
cook till done, then add the sugar and boil a few minutes as 
for jelly. Pour into shallow tin pans; when cold, cover with 
white paper dipped in white of ^zz- Cut into thin slices or 
cubes, and serve for lunch. 

LEnON BUTTER 

Mrs. T. F. McQpmant. 

One cup sugar; i cup boiling water; i tablespoon flour; 
I tablespoon butter; i ^z%; i lemon. 

Mix together the sugar, butter, flour, ^ZZ — well beaten, 
and the juice of the lemon, with a little of the grated rind. 
Pour this into the boiling water and cook slowly. Stir well 
to prevent burning. 

ORANGE riARHALADE 

Mrs. G. W. White. 

Slice very thin twelve oranges and five lemons, using the 
entire fruit, but removing all the seeds carefully. To every 
pound of fruit add one quart of water. Set away for twenty- 
four hours. 



Fruits jiy 

Second Morning. — Boil the fruit till tender. Set away 
twenty-four hours. 

Third Morning. — To each pound of the boiled fruit add 
one pound of sugar. Boil until the liquid makes a jelly. 

ORANGE MARMALADE— English Recipe 

Mrs. Heury Smith. 

One dozen oranges; 4 good sized lemons; i^^ pints water 
to each pound sliced fruit; i pound and 2 ounces sugar to each 
pound fruit. 

Slice the oranges and lemons verj^ thin, and take out the 
seeds, then add the water and let stand 24 hours. Then boil 
till the peel is tender, (about i hour), let this stand till quite 
cold, take out the fruit and weigh it, and to every pound 
allow I pound 2 ounces sugar. Boil this one hour, taking 
great care it does not burn. Stir well with wooden or agate 
spoon. When done put in glasses and seal while hot. It is 
best not to boil too long in one pan, as it is very quick to 
burn. 

ORANGE MARHALADE 

Miss Eloise Forinau. 

Four dozen oranges; 4 lemons; ^ pounds granulated 
sugar to every pound of oranges after the peel is removed. 
Less sugar for very sweet fruit. Peel two dozen removing as 
little of the white lining as possible. Cat the peel into narrow 
strips about an inch long, with the scissors. Put in cold water 
and let it come to a boil. Change the water three times and 
boil peel until tender. Extract all the juice from these 
oranges. Carefully remove white skin, stringy part and seeds 
from remaining oranges, (2 dozen), and cut the pulp into 
small pieces. Put juice, pulp and sugar into a porcelain ket- 
tle; add the lemon juice and boil twenty minutes. Skim care- 
fully, add the orange peel, which has been thoroughly drained 
after boiling; the sliced peel of the four lemons and boil the 
mixture until clear; from one half to one hour. Put into jelly 
glasses when cold. Cover and set away for one month. This 
makes a dozen glasses of very rich marmalade. 



St8 How We Cook in Los Angeles 

ORANGE MARMALADE 

Mrs. W. J. Brown. 

Use as many oranges as desired, reserving the very thin 
peel, (yellow part only), of 3 oranges out of 12. Cut the peel 
in fine shreds with a pair of scissors, and soak in salt water 
over night. In the morning drain off the water, rinse the peel, 
and put on the stove in clear cold water; boil till tender, drain 
off the water and add to the pulp of the oranges, prepared as 
follows: 

Remove every particle of the peel, white skin and seeds, 
from the oranges, cut the pulp or segments into small pieces, 
measure the peel and pulp of oranges, and use one pint of best 
granulated sugar to each pint of prepared fruit. Drain off 
some of the juice of the oranges into a preserving kettle, add 
the sugar, boil up and skim, then add the peel and pulp; boil 
about thirty minutes, or until sufficiently thick, remove from 
stove, and put in glass jars or jelly glasses. 

ORANGE FLOWER SYRUP 

Miss E. Benton Fremont. 

One pint fresh white orange petals; i quart rich syrup, 
made of granulated sugar and water. 

Select, and wash without bruising, the white petals of the 
orange flowers. While the petals drain on a cloth, prepare a 
rich syrup of granulated sugar and water, allowing one quart 
for each pint of blossoms. After skimming the syrup care- 
fully, drop in the petals and simmer only two minutes, stir 
gently, strain and bottle; seal while hot. It will be a delicate 
sea green color, retaining all the fragrance of the flower and 
reminding one when opened, of an orange grove in Spring. A 
teaspoonful added to a glass of water makes a most delicious 
drink, and is regarded by the Floridians as a nerve tonic. 
This is also a very agreeable flavoring for custards, icing or 
pudding sauces. 

PRESERVED BLACKBERRIES 

A. C. B. 

Look over, wash, and weigh the fruit, using pound for 



Fruits ^ rg 

pound of fruit and sugar. Put the berries and sugar on the 
stove, and let it come to a boil slowly, then cook about an 
hour, being careful not to let it burn, pour into glass jars and 
seal while hot. 

PRESERVED STRAWBERRIES 

A. C. B. 

Use one pound best granulated sugar to each pound of 
berries; place them in the kettle on back of stove until the 
sugar is dissolved, then boil slowly until the berries are clear, 
skim out the berries carefully and boil the syrup until thick, 
then carefully put the berries in the hot sj-rup and let them 
boil up, then put in glass jars and seal. 

PRESERVED PEACHES 

Mrs. W.J. Brown. 

Use peaches before they are perfectly ripe. Select them 
of even size, pare, remove the stones, weigh the fruit and 
allow a pound of sugar to each pound of fruit. Use just enough 
water to dissolve the sugar. When boiling hot put in one 
layer of the prepared fruit, and three peach stones to each 
quart, simmer slowly about ten minutes, then turn each piece 
over carefully and simmer until the fruit is clear, then put in 
jars carefully and seal. If the syrup is not all needed to fill 
the jar, add the sugar to it for the next jar and cook as before. 
A low, broad granite pan is best to use. 

PRESERVED PEARS 

Mrs. Helen W. Watson. 

Bartlett pears are best for preserving. Use them before 
they become soft. Pare, cut in halves or quarters, and use a 
pound of sugar to each pound of fruit. Put the sugar in the 
preserving kettle with just enough water to dissolve it. Let 
it boil slowly until the required color is obtained. 
If you prefer to have them white, remove the fruit as 
soon as it becomes clear, boil down the syrup, drop in the 
pears, let them come to a boil, then put in jars and seal. By 
cooking them slowly several hours they will become a rich, 
dark color. 



j^o How We Cook in Los Angeles 

PRESERVED QUINCE3 

Mrs. Frank Miller. 

Select quinces of even size. As you peel and core them 
throw into cold water. Make a syrup of i pint water and i 
pound granulated sugar to every pound of fruit. Bring the 
syrup to a boiling point, drain the fruit from the cold water, 
and add to the boiling syrup. Boil slowly until they become 
the desired color. 

GRAPE PRESERVES 

Mrs. W. J. Brown. 

Use muscat, or raisin grapes. Cut the grapes open wixh. a 
knife, remove the seeds, and to each pound of fruit allow one 
pound best granulated sugar. Cook slowly for thirty minutes 
or until the grapes are perfectly clear. Put in glass jars and 
seal. Delicious. 

FIQ PRESERVES 

Mrs. M. R. Siusabaugh. 

Select figs that are not over ripe; White Smyrna preferred. 
Pare them, and use as many pounds of sugar as fruit. Cover 
fruit with sugar and set in refrigerator over night. Pour off 
the syrup thus formed in a preserving kettle and heat it. Place 
enough figs to cover bottom of kettle and boil until a light 
amber color, and dip out and place in the jar. Keep adding 
and dipping out as fast as done, until all are cooked, and then 
pour hot syrup over figs and seal. 

PRESERVED FIGS 

Mrs. S. C. Hubbell. 

Select fine, large, white figs, of equal ripeness. Peel, and 
weigh them. Cover wdth water, boil slowly until tender, but 
not broken. Take them out with care and lay on platter. 
Prepare a thick syrup of sugar — as many pounds as of fruit — 
boil, and skim it, then put in the figs, and cook slowly until 
transparent. When nearly done, add a few slices of lemon. 
Put in glass jars. Many persons add a little ginger also.

PRESERVED FIGS 

Mrs. C. H. Haas. 

Use white figs, picked the day before preserving. Peel and 
weigh them, and use ^ pound sugar to one pound fruit. 
Sprinkle the sugar over the figs and let them stand over 
night. Pour the syrup ofi'and boil it down. When thick put 
the figs in and cook gently until clear, then drain through a 
sieve and boil the syrup down again. Put the figs in and boil 
slowly I hour. Use i lemon sliced, to every 3 pounds of figs. 

LOQUOT PRESERVE 

Mrs. Alice Cooper. 

Remove skins and stones from the loquots. Allow one 
pound of granulated sugar to one pound of fruit. Boil until 
clear, and seal in glass jars. A little of this preserve used in 
making fruit cake adds to its richness. 

ORANGE PRESERVE 

Mrs. J. C. Joplin, Orange Co. 

Use ripe navel oranges, peel them carefully, be sure to 
remove all the white, also the end and stem running through 
the center, using great care not to break the orange. Throw 
in cold water a few hours, when you can remove more of the 
white, then drop them into boiling water. Have ready a 
syrup made of i}^ pounds granulated sugar to one pound of 
fruit. L,ift the oranges out of the water with a skimmer, 
drain well and drop them into the boiling syrup, and cook till 
they are clear. When done put in glass jars and seal while 
boiling hot. If you do not remove all the white, the preserve 
will be bitter. 

ORANGE PEEL PRESERVE 

Mrs. J. C. Joplin, Orange Co. 

Soak the peel in strong salt water nine days, changing 
the water every three days, then dry on a sieve. Make a 
syrup of one pound sugar to one quart water. Put the peel 
in and simmer until transparent. This is nice to put in with 
the preserved oranges. If the peel is cut in halves it is nice to 



^22 How We Cook in Los Angeles 

put a preserved orange into the peel when served. If careful 
in placing; it makes a very pretty, as well as palatable dish. 

PRESERVED CITRON 

Mrs. C. H. Haas. 

Remove the inside, cut in quarters, peel and put in a jar of 
strong brine and let stand three days. Drain off and put in a 
new brine three days. Drain second water off and put in third 
brine three days, then drain and soak three days in fresh 
w^ater. The twelfth day make a syrup of ^ pound sugar to i 
pound fruit. Put in the citron and cook till clear. Orange 
or lemon peel can be preserved in the same waj'. 

GREEN ALMOND PRESERVES 

Miss E. Beuton Fremont. 

The shell of the almond must be soft; pierce them through 
in several places with a strong, coarse needle. Then lay them 
for five days in cold water, changing the water each morning. 
On the fifth daj' put the almonds in boiling water and cook 
until they are easily pierced by a thin, pointed sliver of wood. 
Take them out and drain oS" the water and sprinkle with granu- 
lated sugar; ^ pound sugar to i pound almonds; cover with a 
clean cloth and let stand all night. Next morning pour off" 
the syrup, boil the almonds again for a few moments and 
repeat the sprinkling of sugar as before. Do this three or four 
times in all, depending on the tenderness of the almonds. 
Then to the syrup which has been each morning drained off" 
from the almonds, add sugar in the proportion of y{ pound to 
each ^ pound already used. Boil to a syrup, skim carefullj', 
then drop in the almonds and let them boil a few minutes. 
When the}' are cooled, put in air-tight jars, and set in a cool 
but dry place.

from 15 to 20 minutes, or until it thickens. 

STRAWBERRY JELLY No. 1 

Mrs. Z. L- Parmelee. 

Put the fruit in a preserving kettle on back of stove, when 
the juice separates from the berries let it come to the boiling 
point. Then turn into a jelly bag and drain. Measure the 
juice and allow 3/| pound granulated sugar to one pint juice. 
Heat the sugar thoroughly, stirring often to prevent burning. 
Boil the juice rapidly for 25 minutes. Add the sugar and 
stir until dissolved. Boil from 2 to 5 minutes. Then remove 
from stove and pour into jelly glasses. Set awa}' a day or 
two, then cover with paper, brushed over with white of &^g, 
and keep in a dark, dr}', cool place. 

STRAWBERRY JELLY No. 2 

Mrs. J. M. Johustou. 

Boil currants and strain out the juice, likewise straw- 
berries. 

To I cup currant and 2 cups berry juice, use 3 cups sugar.

CURRANT JELLY, No. 1 

Mrs. W. J. Brown. 

The best jellj^ is made from currants when they first ripen, 
before they are thoroughly ripe. 



J 2/ How We Cook in Los Angeles 

Pick the currants from the stems, crush them in an earthen 
dish, put the pulp in a jelly bag- to drain, but do not squeeze 
as it will make the jelly cloudy. To i pint of juice, 
use one pint of best granulated sugar. Put the sugar in the 
oven to heat, stirring it often to prevent burning. Boil the 
juice rapidl)^ twenty minutes in a porcelain or granite kettle, 
skimming well, add the sugar that has been heated and let it 
come to a boil, then strain into glasses. When cold, cover it 
with paper cut to fit the glass, and brush over with the white 
of egg. Tie paper over the glass and set in a cool, dark, dry 
place. 

By squeezing the fruit after it has been drained, one can 
make a jelly that will not be as clear, but it will answer for 
some purposes. 

CURRANT JELLY, No. 2 

Look over the fruit, remove all the imperfect currants, 
put over the fire and scald; drain in a jelly bag, boil the juice 
fifteen minutes. Skim well, add the heated sugar and boil 
five minutes, turn into glasses and cover as directed in No. i. 

GOOSEBERRY JELLY

the sugar in the oven, and boil the juice rapidly half an 
hour; skim it, then add the sugar and boil half an hour longer. 

TOKAY GRAPE JELLY 

Mrs. Guy Smith, Tustin. 

Wash and clean the grapes carefully. Boil slowly one 
hour, stirring frequently. Strain through a colander and 
then through a fine bag; do not squeeze. Measure juice and 
boil twenty minutes; then add one pint of sugar to each 
pint of juice and boil five minutes longer. Put in glasses 
and cover with paper dipped in alcohol to prevent moulding. 



Fruits J 2^ 

GRAPE JELLY 

Mrs. Frank Miller. 

Use the grapes before they are fully ripe. Wash and 
drain them, removing all imperfect ones; put them into a 
kettle, mash and cook them until their skins are broken, 
then strain through a flannel bag; and to each pint of juice use 
one pound of sugar. Boil the juice rapidly fifteen minutes, 
then add the sugar and boil from five to ten minutes longer. 

LOQUOT JELLY 

Mrs. G. L. Arnold. 

One lb sugar to i pint juice. 

Wash the fruit and put in water enough to half cover. 
Boil slowly until the juice is extracted, strain and add sugar 
in the above proportion. Boil until it will jelly, then fill the 
glasses. 

LOQUOT JELLY 

Mrs. W. H. Barnard. 

Cut off blossom end of loquot. Boil in water until soft; 
squeeze out and strain through a jelly bag. Use ^ lb of sugar 
to I ft) of fruit, weighing both before boiling. 

PLUM JELLY 

Mrs. R. M. Widuey. 

Remove the stems, wash, put in the preserving kettle, 
cover with water and boil until well done; pour in jelly bag 
and drain. To each pint of juice allow one pint sugar; put 
on the stove and boil rapidly twenty minutes; skim, add 
heated sugar and boil from ten to fifteen minutes; remove 
from stove and put in glasses. Red plums make beautiful 
jelly. 

PEACH JELLY 

Mrs. A. W. Bessey, Orange Co. 

Put the peaches in the preserving kettle with a little water, 
cover. Heat slowl}' and cook until the peaches will mash 
readily, then turn into a jelly bag and drip until the pulp is 
dry. Boil the juice rapidly twenty minutes, skimming it 



J 26 Hoiv We Cook in Los Angeles 

often. Remove it from the fire, measure and return it to the 
fire; as soon as it boils again, add as many pounds of sugar 
as you have pounds of juice, and boil until it jellies. Pour 
into tumblers, and stand aside two or three days; then cover 
with paper and put in a cool, dry place. 

Apricot jelly is made much the same way; but be sure to 
use fruit that is not too ripe. A beautiful jelly is made by 
using half apricot and half blackberry juice. 

GUAVA JELLY 

Mrs. E. R. Smith. 

After washing the fruit, put it into the fruit kettle, putting 
more than enough water to cover the fruit; cook until soft, 
run through a fruit strainer and add the same quantity of 
sugar as there is juice, boiling and testing as in other fruit 
jelly. Guavas require more water than any other jelly fruit. 
The late guavas are the best for jelly. 

PINEAPPLE JELLY 

Mrs. J. J. Ayers. 

One and one- half quarts of wetting all together (scant

sugar in the oven to heat; put on the juice letting it boil 20 
minutes, then add the sugar and boil 5 minutes. Remove 
from the stove and pour into jelly glasses which are set on a 
folded cloth, wet in cold water, to avoid their breaking. If 
you desire a darker colored jelly, boil the sugar with the 
juice for 25 minutes. 

BANANA JELLY 

Mrs. A. S. Baldwin. 

Half box gelatine; y^ pint cold water; Yt, pint boiling 
water; yi cup sugar; 2 bananas. 

Soak the gelatine in the cold water till soft, then add the 
boiling water and sugar. Stir thoroughly and strain into 
molds wet with cold water. When partly cold, stir in the 
bananas sliced thin. 

ORANGE JELLY 

Mrs. J. P. Widney. 

Wash the oranges and, with a silver spoon, remove the 
pulp. (If a flavor of the peel is desired, squeeze a few of the 
oranges with a lemon squeezer. This will give sufficient 
flavor without making the jelly bitter). Boil quickly in a 
porcelain or granite kettle. Drain through a jelly bag, with- 
out squeezing. Add one pound of sugar to a pint of juice, 
and boil rapidly for 20 minutes. If managed rightly, the 
jelly will be of a clear, amber color and delicious. 

ORANGE JELLY 

Mrs. A. S. Baldwin. 

Half box Cox's gelatine; ^ pint cold water; i cup sugar; 
^ pint orange juice. 

Soak the gelatine in the cold water for ten minutes, then

OLIVE CULTURE IN CALIFORNIA 



J. L. HOWLAND, Pomona 



lyittle attention has been paid to the cultivation of the olive 
until the past few years, and the only variety known here 
formerly was the Mission, brought by the Spanish padres from 
Spain, and planted at the old missions. Some of these trees 
are still standing, though planted a century ago — mostly 
neglected, or at best slightly cultivated. This proves the lon- 
gevity and tenacity of life of the olive, and that when once 
rooted it will hold its own even under adverse circumstances. 
"We have authentic records of its living to be over three hun- 
dred years old, so when we plant an olive orchard we are not 
planting merely for our own benefit, but for future genera- 
tions. 

The olive, because of the moderate care which it requires 
and the copiousness and value of its product, may be consid- 
ered one of the most valuable of trees. Though it is limited in 
its possible extension, the Italian growers already look for- 
ward with dread to its being cultivated in other countries, and 
now California seems likely to prove a formidable rival. But 
the fear would seem to be unfounded, as the only source of 
supply for olives pickled, and pure olive oil in the United 
States is limited to this State. 

The demand for the pure article is constantly growing, both 
abroad and at home, and it is doubtful if the production 
abroad will any more than supply the European market. 

The growth of the olive is to be, it seems to me, one of the 
leading and most permanent industries of Southern Califor- 
nia. It will give us what is nearly impossible to buy now, 
pure olive oil, in place of the cottonseed and lard mixture in 
common use. It is a most wholesome and palatable article of 
food. 

The experiments have gone far enough to show that the 



Olive Ctilture in California jjj 

industry is remunerative. * * A mature olive grove in 
good bearing is a fortune. I feel sure that within twenty-five 
years this will be one of the most profitable industries of Cali- 
fornia, and that the demand for pure olive oil and edible fruit 
in the United States will drive out the adulterated and inferior 
commercial products. But California can easily ruin its rep- 
utation by adopting the European systems of adulteration. 

In regard to soil suitable for the olive, it will live in any 
soil except a dry and compact or wet one. It is safe to say 
that the olive prefers a soft, friable, moderately cool soil, and 
one rich in lime and potash; a soil that the roots can extend 
through in all directions, and that will admit of the free cir- 
culation of air and moisture. The olive will flourish wherever 
its roots will penetrate easily and there is plenty of lime and 
alkali, such as a loose soil of rocky clay, or sand, of granite or 
volcanic formation. 

I consider the best age at which to plant the olive to be 
two or three years, for the reason that the one-year old 
plants and roots are apt to be soft and sappy, and the loss will 
be much greater in transplanting them from the nursery to 
the orchard than the older trees which have their roots and 
stems hardened. 

The proper distance at which to plant olive trees is from 
twenty to thirty feet, as they need a great amount of sun and 
light to bring the fruit to perfection. If planted closer, in a 
few years every other tree will have to be taken up, and that 
will leave too much vacant space. 

The olive should be planted as early in the winter as the 
land can be suitably prepared, (of course that will depend on 
how early the rains come), and especially on dry lands they 
must be planted as early as possible so as to get all the bene- 
fit of the winter rains. 

It is a great mistake not to take good care of olive trees 
when they are first planted. The olive is rather a difiicult 
tree to transplant, and should be given the same care as the 
orange tree until it gets started; after that there is no fruit 
tree which will stand so much abuse. 



jj/ How We Cook in Los Angeles 

In the first place the ground should be plowed good and 
deep, say twelve inches, and the clods mashed. The holes 
should be from eighteen inches to two feet deep, and as wide. 
As soon as the trees are planted they should be thoroughly 
irrigated, and again in about a week (if it does not rain), after 
that in two weeks, and then in a month. After they once gftt 
started, give them about the same water you would a decidu- 
ous orchard. On dry lands the trees should be given about 
two pailfuls of water when planted, and the same amount 
three or four times during the first summer. 

KINDS TO PLANT: 

The following list has been made up from my own experi- 
ence for the last eight years and are all varieties I would plant 
for myself: 

For pickles — Regalis, Columella, Polymorpha, Manzanillo. 

For oil — Rubra, Pendulina, Uvaria, Nevadillo Blanco, 
Oblongo. 

Oil and pickles — Columella, Pendulina, Mission. 

USES OF OLIVE OIL AS A FOOD 

Olive oil is an excellent substitute for lard for frying cer- 
tain articles of food. The use of oil dates back to the patri- 
archal epoch in Jewish history, from which it has come down 
almost without change to the Arabs of to-day, who make 
various kinds of cakes by frying or boiling mixtures of flour 
or meat in olive oil. 

In Spain and Italy, where olive oil enters most generally 
into the cuisine of the people, it almost entirely replaces but- 
ter and lard. It is used for salads, for seasoning all kinds of 
vegetables, and for frying vegetables, fish and meats. 

LOCATIONS FOR GROWING SUPERIOR OLIVES 

ELWOOD COOPER, SANTA BARBARA 

I have purchased the olives grown in the San Fernando 
Valley for two or three years. One of the parties had the 
Old Mission orchard, another had a young orchard grown 
not far from the Mission. These were the finest and largest 
olives I have ever seen grown in California. Just across the 



Olive Culture in California S35 



mountains, north, the olives grown are also verj^ fine. The 
San Fernando olives I used in making oil, as I did not keep 
them separate from my own, I, of course, cannot tell how 
they compared in quantity and quality of oil. I suspect 

that the trees were irrigated, and hence the larger size of the 
berries. 

It has been stated that by irrigation the fruit is larger, 
which is important for pickling, but that the crop will not 
yield more oil; but I am satisfied that with the average rainfall 
of 17 inches which falls in Santa Barbara, Ventura and lyos 
Angeles Counties, that there is no better olive district on the 
face of the earth. Of course, there are conditions of heat in 
certain localities that is not the best for olives, but I have 
never seen anything on this side of the tunnel that would 
indicate too much heat for any of our fruits. The olive crops 
that I bought were in successive years and demonstrated 
beyond doubt the adaptility of the valley for olive growing. 



PICKLES 



PICKLING OLIVES 

J. L. Howland, Pomona. 

For the purpose of pickling, the olives must be picked just 
as they commence to turn red, about one month before matur- 
ity. Each berry should be picked carefully by hand and 
placed gently in a basket or can of water; they are then placed 
in vats and covered with water, to which is added a solution of 
American lye of one pound to every ten gallons of olives. The 
solution should be drawn off and poured over the olives ever}'- 
hour or so, till the lye has penetrated to the pit — or very 
nearly so — which can be told by cutting an olive open with a 
knife. It should be turned to a yellowish color to the pit. 
The lye should then be drawn off and fresh water poured on 
the olives, and changed every few hours for the first day. 
After that it should be changed every twenty-four hours for a 
week or ten days, till all the lye has been washed out and the 
olives are perfectly fresh. Then put them in a weak solution 
of salt for a week, after which time this should be drawn off 
and a stronger solution of 14 ounces of salt to a gallon of 
water should be poured over them. The salt should be first 
dissolved in hot water, then strained and water added till it is 
of the right strength. The olives should, also, be kept out of 
the sunlight. 

TO CURE OLIVES 

Mrs. Flora M. Kimball, National City. 

Take i lb concentrated lye ; 10 gallons olives, Water 
sufficent to cover them. 

Stir them from the bottom daily, and change the lye when 
the strength seems exhausted. Taste frequently to ascertain 
when the bitterness is extracted from the fruit. It requires 
from one to two weeks to accomplish this, as there is a diflfer- 
ence in the strength of the lye. When free from the bitter 
taste add clear water and change it every day until the water 
runs off clear. Then put it in a weak brine. 



Pickles JJ7 

PICKLED OLIVES 

Mrs. E. F. C. Klokke. 

Take the olives from the tree when they are ripe, dark 
brown or black. Prick each one with a silver fork in three 
or four places. Place them in fresh water, without salt, for a 
week, changing the water every twenty-four hours. After 
that, put them in salt and water, and change the same every 
forty-eight hours till they are good to eat. 

OLIVE PICKLING. 

Mrs. Guy Smith, Tustin. 

Carefully pick the olives, keeping those of a color to 
gether. All green, all red, or turning red, or black — small 
green ones are not ripe enough to be good. To four gallons 
of olives, take one flb of concentrated lye and four gallons of 
water. Dissolve the lye in a small quantity of boiling water. 
Keep the olives all under the water, and stir several times each 
day. Keep the olives in the lye three days, when the bitter- 
ness should be out; soak in fresh water four days, changing 
the water at least twice each day. When no taste of bitter- 
ness, or of lye, is left, cover with brine; one pint of salt to 
one gallon of water. Keep every olive under the brine. 
Black and ripe olives need more salt to keep them. 

PICKLING 0LIVE5 

J. C. M. Rainbow, San Diego, Cal. 

Dissolve I pound of American concentrated lye in 12 gal- 
lons of water, put in the olives and let them stand three days 
and nights, stirring frequently. Draw oflf the water and add 
a new lye of the same strength as the first, and let it stand 
3 days, do this the third time, or till the. bitterness is taken 
out, then soak in fresh water, changing it till free of lye, then 
place them in brine for use. 



Directions for making oil can be found in Spanish Depart- 
ment.

Mrs. Geo. B. Dunham, Moreno. 

Three-fourths gallon chopped cabbage; i^ tablespoons all- 
spice; I gallon chopped green tomatoes; i^^ tablespoons 
broken mace; 6 tablespoons mustard; i^ tablespoons cinna- 
mon; 3 tablespoons celery seed; i tablespoon cloves; i 
tablespoon black pepper, ground; ^ ft sugar; 3 quarts 
vinegar. 

Sprinkle the cabbage and tomatoes with salt, let stand 
over night. In the morning squeeze lightly in a cheese 
cloth bag to free the mixture from excess of water. 

Place in a granite ware pan, add spices, sugar, and 
vinegar. The allspice, mace, cinnamon, and cloves should be 
chopped, not ground. Boil fifteen minutes, stirring. In 
this climate I have found best to seal. 

PICKLED WALNUTS 

Mrs. Cameron Thom. 

One quart vinegar; i ounce black pepper; i ounce ginger; 
1 ounce eschalots; i ounce salt; i ounce pepper; i ounce 
mustard seed. 

Secure the walnuts before they become woody. Steep 
them in brine one week, then put them in a kettle with new 
brine and allow them to simmer gently. Drain and put in a 
cool place until they become black, (about two days), then 
put them in the hot pickle of vinegar and spices. 

riARTYNIA BEAN PICKLES 

Mrs. M. G. Moore. 

One gallon beans; 3 pounds brown sugar; 

The beans should be tender enough to pierce with your 

nail. Scald with fresh, weak brine seven times, every other 

day. Cook them until tender, and proceed as with any other 

sweet pickle. 

GREEN PEPPER PICKLES 

Mrs. M. G. Moore. 

Peppers; vinegar; cabbage; cucumbers; mace; cloves; 
cinnamon; mustard. 

If the peppers are preferred less pungent, open the top of 



Pickles j/^5 

each and remove half the seeds. L,ay them in a brine of salt 
and water strong enough to bear an ^%^. lyCt them remain 
in this two weeks, being careful that the brine covers them 
and to remove the scum as it rises. If they are not yellow 
at the end of two weeks, let them remain a little longer. 
When yellow, take them from the brine, wash, and place in 
a kettle of cold water, cover with grape leaves, set near the 
fire where they will get hot, but not cooked. When they are 
greened, drain, pack in jars, and pour over them cold, spiced 
vinegar. If the3^ are to be stuffed, chop cabbage and cucum- 
bers very fine. Season highly with mace, cloves, cinnamon 
and mustard seed. Stufi" each pepper with this preparation 
and tie it with a thread. 

The bell pepper here is not too fiery for pickling. 

PICKLED ONIONS 

Mrs. John Beckwith. 

Small, , white onions; vinegar; unground black pepper; 
unground allspice. 

Peel the onions and put them in dry bottles or jars. Pour 
over them enough cold vinegar to cover them. To each jar, 
add two teaspoons of allspice and the same of black pepper. 
Cover securely and put in a dry place; they will be ready for 
use in a fortnight. 

This is a simple recipe, but very delicious, the onions 
being nice and crisp. 

PICKLED CABBAGE 

Mrs. M. G. Moore. 

One cabbage; i spoonful cloves; 2 spoonfuls allspice; 
vinegar. 

Quarter cabbage as for boiling. Steam until about three-

salt on each layer. Scald the vinegar with the spices, and 
pour it over the onions while hot. After twenty-four hours, 
repeat the scalding of the vinegar. The onions will be ready 
for use in three or four days. 



CANDIES 



Mrs. W. T. Carter 



The materials used in the home manufacture of the finest 
quality of so called French candy are neither expensive nor 
difficult to obtain. Aside from sugar, the basis of all confec- 
tions, these materials consist chiefly of flavors and colorings. 
These can be procured from your druggist or grocer. The 
basis of Cream Nuts, Chocolate Drops, Butter Cups, Cream 
Bars, Cocoanut Drops and many others is '"fondant", or in 
other words, gramdated sugar creamed. 

TO HAKE FONDANT 

Take of granulated sugar 4 pounds; water, i quart; cream 
tartar, yi teaspoon. Mix the sugar and water together in a 
granite or porcelain kettle and put over a hot fire; when it comes 
to a boil, add the cream tartar. I^et the syrup cook to the 
consistency of jelly, keeping the sides of the kettle wiped 
down with a cloth and cold water. Try the syrup by drop- 
ping into a cup of cold water; when it can be rolled into a 
ball, it is done and should be taken instantly from the fire 
and the kettle placed in a large vessel of cold water; now 
flavor with one tablespoon vanilla. While it is still warm — 
not hot — stir the mass briskly with a wooden spatula or 
paddle, always stirring in the same direction, until it is 
perfectly white and of a soft creamy texture. lyCt the stirring 
be brisk and uninterrupted in order that the syrup may not 
granulate. After the sugar creams, turn it out on to a sheet 
of tin, or a cake board and knead as you would dough or 
bread. When it is worked until perfectly smooth, • the 

cream is ready for use, and should be put into an earthen jar 
and covered with a damp cotton cloth and closely covered. 
It will keep for weeks, and can be sliced like butter. 



J ^8 How W/e Cook in Los Angeles 



CREAM WALNUTS 

Take from the fondant pieces the size wanted and roll them 
into little balls, then press upon them the half of a walnut kernel 
until flattened; set on edge to dry. Cream dates, cream 
figs, and cream almonds are all made in the same way. 
CHOCOLATE CREAH DROPS 

Balls the size and shape of small birds' eggs are made of 
the fondant, and when they are hardened (which will be in lo 
or 12 hours), they may be dipped in chocolate which has been 
melted; the vessel containing the melted chocolate must be 
kept in pan of hot water to prevent hardening. Throw the 
drops into the melted chocolate, one at a time, and immedi- 
ately dip them out with a bent wire or a table fork and set 
them on a slightly buttered paper to dry. When dry, they 
are ready to be eaten or put into boxes. 

Fruit Drops of all kinds are made in the same way, 
except that the fondant must be flavored with the desired 
fruit flavor, and instead of the chocolate coating, use the 
fondant which should be colored to represent the fruit: as, 
red for the strawberry flavor, yellow for lemon or peach, etc. 
Melt the fondant to be used for a glace, add the coloring and 
keep warm; but if it should become too stiff, add carefully a 
few drops of hot water, 

WALNUT CREAM BAR 

Have ready a quantity of walnuts finely '^chopped. Melt 
over a slow fire the desired quantity of fondant; add the 
walnuts and, if desired, finely sliced citron, chopped raisins, 
etc. Turn into a shallow pan lined with buttered paper; 
when cold, cut into bars, 

COCOANUT BAR 

Proceed in exactly the same manner, except you thicken 
the melted fondant with dessicated or grated cocoanut, 
COCOANUT CAKES OR KISSES 

Prepare as for cocoanut cream bars, and while the mixture 
is hot, spread on buttered paper or tins in cakes the desired 



Candies j^fg 

size; these can be varied by the use of different coloring 
matter: making some pink, some yellow, some chocolate, etc. 
This fondant, which is the basis of all the preceeding candies, 
or "bon-bons", is also used to glaze cakes, biscuits, etc., and 
is called "French glace", "sugar icing", "Conserve", etc. 
When used for covering cakes, it must be diluted and poured 
over them. If for small cakes or biscuits, melt, color, or not, 
as you fancy, and dip them in. I have confined my recipes 
exclusively to French candies. To go into full details con- 
cerning all kinds of candies would require too much space. 
These I have very often and very successfully made.

GRAHAM GEMS 

Mrs. T. F. McCamant. 

Mix a batter of graham flour and water. Let it stand 
until sour, the same as for old-fashioned buckwheat cakes. 
When of the proper consistency, add a little melted suet or 
butter and salt. While your gem tins are heating, stir in 
thoroughly ^ teaspoon soda. Bake in a hot oven. The 
quantity of soda must necessarily be regulated by the sourness 
of the batter, it is not always alike. "Practice makes 

perfect." 

GRAHAM PANCAKES 

Mrs. T. F. McCamant. 

Mix the same as for gems, only thinner and leave out the 
shortening. Sour milk may be used instead of water. A 
little sugar put in the batter will make the cakes brown nicer.

HINTS 



Cold tea is excellent for cleaning grained wood. 

The ashes of wheat straw make an excellent silver polish. 
Apply with soft leather or chamois. 

Little bags of unground pepper pinned to hangings and 
among clothes in wardrobes will keep away moths. Ground 
black pepper sprinkled plentifully into fur will preserve 
effectually from moths. 

Sprinkle fine meal on grease spots in your carpet. Let it 
remain several hours and it will have absorbed the grease. 

Tar on cotton goods can be removed by spreading clean 
lard on the part stained, and allowing it to remain for some 
little time. 

Rub ink stains on linen with clean tallow before washing 
and boiling. 

To remove grease from silk goods, wash with ether. 

Mrs. W. B. A. 

To set the color in any cotton or linen goods, dissolve 
one tablespoon of sugar of lead in a pail of very hot water. 
This will be sufficient for lo or 12 yards of goods. Dip 
thoroughly, seeing that every part is evenly wet. Keep in 
the water from 20 to 30 minutes. This will not injure the 
most delicate color, but fix it iudellibly. If you feel at all 
doubtful, try a small piece of your goods — dry, then wash in 
the ordinary way. 

Lemon juice and salt will usually remove rust. 

To take stains from silk, use i part essence of lemon and 
5 parts spirits of turpentine. Apply with a linen cloth. 

EVENING SUPPERS 

Mrs. J. J. Ayers. 

One gallon of ice-cream for every twenty guests; one hun- 



7<5/ How W^e Cook i7i Los Angeles 

dred and fifty sandwiches for every hundred people; five 
chickens and one dozen heads celery to fifty persons; twenty 
cakes for every hundred persons. 

TO PURIFY WATER 

Mrs. George Bixby. 

Pare a cactus, slice, and lay in bottom of water pitcher. 



A little kerosene oil, stirred into starch, will prevent flat- 
irons from sticking. 

Kerosene will remove the smoke of coal oil stoves from 
tins. 

Red Seal, Granulated 98 per Cent. Lye or Potash. 

p. C. Thomson, 955 Otsego Street, Phil. 

For making lo pounds of hard soap without boiling. 
Take 5^ pounds of clean grease, free from salt, melt in 
ordinary pan or kettle, and set aside to cool until lukewarm. 
While the grease is cooling, take one can of Thomson's Red 
Seal I^ye or Potash, and dissolve the contents in y/z pints 
cold water, in an earthen or iron vessel or pan. When the 
lye or potash is about summer heat, pour it slowly into the 
grease — not the grease into the lye. Stir until the lye and 
grease are thoroughly combined and become thick, when the 
stirring should cease. Set in a cool place till the soap 
becomes hard.

Something to 
Cook with 

All the Cook Books in the world won't make good 
cooking if you haven't the right things to Do With. In 
a rude age rude things, meat broiled on heated stones. 
Evolution all the way up. Now its our self-basting roast- 
ing pans, and all the new kinks in agate ware kettles and 
cookers. You will find prices at the Big Department Store 
about one third less than anywhere in the cit3^ No matter 
what you want for the kitchen, we have it, and if it comes 
from us its good.

Even a competitor calls Marion Harland's letter April 5, 
1893, commending Cleveland's Baking Powder, 

A Handsome Tribute. 

He tries, however, by inserting old quotations in his 
advertisement, to make the public believe that this 
letter of Marion Harland's applied to his own baking 
powder and not to Cleveland's, as it actually does. 

Some people think such advertising is " smart "; 
others believe it is dishonest. One thing is sure ; 
"smart", tricky and deceptive advertising is a poor 
way to regain lost confidence or lost trade. 

Here is Marion Harland's letter in full, with 
date and signature : 

April 5th, 1893. 

I wish to sa}' that I use and recommend one and onlj^ one 
baking powder, and that is Cleveland's. 

Years ago I did use others and spoke favorably of them at 
the time. In preparing the new edition of "Common Sense in 
the Household," however, I thought it best to substitute baking 
powder in the recipes instead of cream-of-tartar and soda, and 
made a careful investigation of the baking powder question. 

Finding Cleveland's Baking Powder to be really the best, I 
recommended it in "Common Sense in the Household," and now 
use it exclusively. y. ,
