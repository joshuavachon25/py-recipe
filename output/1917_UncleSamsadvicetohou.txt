Ten Lessons on 
Food Conservation 



FOOD THE DECIDING FACTOR 

This year there is not enough food in the world 
for the world's needs. This is the fact, whether the war 
be long or short and regardless of its outcome. 

Our allies must have more food than they can raise, 
and we must send them more than we can readily 
spare. To do this requires a few definite changes in 
our daily habits, but they can easily be made. Neither 
producers nor dealers nor consumers can effect this 
alone. The women who administer our households 
can not bring it about. It can not be done by legis-* 
lation. Only by cooperation — universal, generous, 
whole-souled, decisive— can we do it. This coopera- 
tion must begin in the home. Housewife, father, 
and children are equally concerned and equally under 
obligation to enter the partnership. The outcome of 
the war and the welfare of the world depend upon their 
actively participating with others in this program. 

Why is the great issue of success or failure in this 



2 ADVICE TO THE HOUSEWIFE 

war dependent on the United States? What causes 
brought about this universal shortage of food? 

First. Unkindness of nature. Late springs, droughts, 
hurricanes, poor conditions of rainfall, unexpected 
frosts, and periods of intense heat have played havoc 
with crops the world over. The season of 1916 will go 
down as one of the worst seasons in agricultural his- 
tory. Our own crop of winter wheat is below normal. 
Argentina, normally an exporting country, claims to 
have barely enough wheat for her own needs. 

Second. Reduced productivity of the soil in Europe. 
This condition has been brought about by bad manage- 
ment, unskilled work, and lack of fertilizers; and 
these in turn can be explained by the withdrawal of 
men from farm and field to army and factory, and the 
employment on the soil of overworked women, unskilled 
old men, and listless prisoners. Furthermore, the 
vicious submarine has sunk boat after boat filled with 
nitrates and fertilizers, conspiring to augment the 
pauperization of the earth, so that reduction in soil 
productivity was inevitable. For three years the world 
has been engaged in a ghastly competition of destruc- 
tion and the soil is now beginning to take its revenge. 

Such depletion in food supplies as these causes have 
brought about has made of food conservation an im- 
perative necessity. One striking example of this is 
seen in the fact that in Germany to-day no food is 
fried. It is all boiled or stewed. Grease from the 
kitchen sink is carefully treasured, and soap, the 
basis of which is edible fat, has become a luxury of 
millionaires. Candles, another fat product, have 
disappeared. France and England also lack fats, 
though in a lesser degree, and unless" the women of 
America realize the extreme importance of not wasting 



LESSONS ON FOOD CONSERVATION 3 

and of not consuming one unnecessary bit of butter 
or other animal fat, we may later be in the same 
predicament. 

But the problem of food production and conservation 
and the necessity for a food administration to deal 
with it would have arisen whether we entered the war 
or not. The nations of Europe that are now our 
allies have always been large importers of our food- 
stuffs. Because of their absorption in hostihties dur- 
ing the last three years they have been forced to buy 
from us an ever-increasing proportion of their food- 
stuffs. This demand must inevitably have grown 
more pressing, and our own spare resources as events 
progressed would inevitably have been exhausted. 

Nor would the coming of peace solve the food 
problem. Most people are imder the dangerous de- 
lusion that the mere ceasing of the firing of the big 
guns would bring bread to the world's table. That 
idea must be banished. It is essential that the nation 
should realize the permanency of our food problem. 
Peace, so far as we are concerned, means that to the 
demands of those who are now our aUies would be 
added the demands of those who are now our enemies. 
We could not be indifferent to their himger and so our 
diminished stores would be still more rapidly depleted. 

Why, then, if food exhaustion is so universal, may 
we not rely on the speedy collapse of Germany's 
resistance? The answer is that before the war Germany 
and her allies were almost four-fifths self-supporting, 
whereas England was only one-fifth, France one-half, 
and Italy, at an optimistic estimate, perhaps two- 
thirds. Germany, moreover, was a nation given to 
over-eating. The reduction of her rations was at first 
a benefit rather than a detriment to her population. 



t ADVICE TO THE HOUSEWIFE 

Although in the last two years she has suffered severely 
her problem from the beginning has been only to in- 
crease her production by approximately 25 per cent. 
In spite of bad harvests she seems to have been able at 
least to meet the emergency, and if reports do not 
falsify she can do 30 indefinitely. She has possessed 
herself of what lised to be the western fringe of Russia. 
She is cultivating much of Belgium and a large acre- 
age of northern France. Her latest conquest of Rou- 
mania has given her possession of the plains around 
the lower Danube, perhaps the most fertile soil in the 
world. Further, Germany has a tremendous and 
intricate food organization and no one within her 
borders dares to waste a crumb. Considering all these 
facts it would be the height of folly for America to 
assume anything less than Germany's power to endure. 
The position of our allies in western Europe is essen- 
tially different. Dependent, even in peace times, on 
importations from the outside, they drew their food- 
stuffs from almost every other country in the world. 
They can not now get supplies from central Europe — 
Germany, Austria-Hungary, Bulgaria, and Turkey — 
with which they are at war. Neither can they obtain 
grain from Roumania nor from Russia. With the best 
will in the world to aid, and presumably large stores 
of foodstuffs to sell, Russia is handicapped by the 
disorganization of her railroads. Even before the 
revolution her transportation S3rstem was paralyzed. 
To correct these conditions overnight is impossible. 
There will have to be a national rehabilitation before 
the allies can reasonably hope for help from their 
great free friend of the East. India and Australia, 
too, can send but a part of their surplus to England 
or France because of the shortage of tonnage caused 



LESSONS ON FOOD CONSERVATION S 

by the depredations of the submarines. Further- 
more^ the long trip from these far countries to the home 
ports is uneconomical and wasteful at a time when 
every inch of cargo space and every hour of cargo time 
has to be conserved. Nor can help be looked for 
from the great food-producing nations of South America, 
for they also have shared in the general crop depression, 
and it is doubtfid if they will have enough even for 
themselves. 

The United States is the greatest food-producing 
country. We have a larger acreage of land in crops 
than any other nation, except perhaps China. This 
acreage is nearly equal to that of all Europe, excluding 
Russia. For the moment Russia's crops count only 
for herself. From all this it will be clear that what 
our allies need from us in the way of cereals for human 
and animal food is enormous. Their total require- 
ments are nearly 1,000,000,000 bushels. Of this 
amount native production and imports from other 
countries can supply but a small part; most of it 
must come from us. Yet this amount is far beyond 
any surplus that we shall have if we keep up our 
usual eating habits. We have never exported more 
than 500,000,000 bushels of cereals in a year, yet the 
needs abroad call for nearly twice that. 

The moral is clear. We must reduce our own con- 
sumption. Our highest obligation in this war is to 
make sure that we do not fail om* allies in their hour of 
need, just as our deepest duty to ourselves is to plan 
to-day, intelligently and patriotically, to provide against 
the possible shortage of next spring. It is within our 
power not only to protect ourselves and to create a 
surplus big enough to meet the most pressing needs 
of these people if we enforce on ourselves a few minor 



6 ADVICE TO THE HOUSEWIFE 

economies. Already our allies have sacrificed their 
bravest and best for the cause which is now our cause. 
Their sacrifices must go on^ but they must not be 
allowed to starve. However generous our giving, this 
summer and fall there confronts France and England 
and Italy the blackest and most agonizing winter they 
have ever had to endure. Such minor deprivations as 
we may suffer seem petty in comparison. Regulate 
ourselves we must if only to keep them in the trenches 
and to avert high prices, discontent, and general busi- 
ness and industrial depression in America this winter 
and next spring. Loyalty to those whose cause we 
have espoused and duty to ourselves counsel and oblige 
us to economy. 

There is no suggestion of dictation in this appeal. 
The economies outlined impose no hardships. All 
must do their bit, but in appl3dng the measures our 
nation's chief reliance must be on the women. They 
have the direction of the households of the land. In 
this, as in all wars, their great service is the aU-im- 
portant task of food conservation. 

We would be blind to hard facts if we were not aware 
that many women throughout America, in the face of 
present high prices, regard the demand upon them 
for new economies as something of an impertinence. 
" How can you ask us to economize," many of them 
will say, " when already we have not enough money 
to buy things necessary to support life? What we 
want to know is not how we can cut down the amount 
of food, but how we can increase it." 

To this just criticism it should be said plainly that the 
projected food administration will take definite meas- 
ures to do away with food speculation where it may have 
existed, and to stabilize prices at fair levels. But 



LESSONS ON FOOD CONSERVATION 7 

new economies must also be pointed out so that the 
whole people can extend the purchasing power of a 
dollar. 

At the moment there is no actual shortage of food- 
stuffs in this country if we were only to feed ourselves. 
We have more than enough to feed ourselves; a great 
deal more. The terrific uplift in prices is due to the 
world's demand on our food surplus, the actual size 
of which is smaller than ever before in the history of 
our coimtry. This has been, of course, an incentive to 
speculation and the advance has come about because 
of the haphazard way in which buyers have bid against 
each other until they raised the prices sky-high. 

Under the new food-control regime it is hoped that 
prices can be kept from going higher if they are not 
reduced. It would be a serious error to suppose that 
any decrease in prices means any lessening in the need 
for saving and of economizing. In most European 
countries the Governments are dictating daily food 
rations for their inhabitants. The question of high 
or low prices must not blur our vision of the basic 
economic realities beneath. It is a matter of general 
supply. Put simply, it means that no matter how low 
prices may go nor how high they may reach, the real 
problem is. Can we produce enough for ourselves and 
enough more to make up the deficiency of our allies? 

We can if we so desire. Autocracy believes we can 
not do it; believes that as members of a democracy 
we are too selfishly individualistic to desire it, too 
weak to accomplish it even if we did wish it. It admits 
our fighting abiUty but derides our power of self- 
control and self-sacrifice. Apart then from our obli- 
gation to the allies, it is incumbent on America to 
prove that democracy needs no tyrant's rod to govern 



8 ADVICE TO THE HOUSEWIFE 

its ways or its appetites. We have already undertaken 
broad measures to increase our production of food, 
and our intelligence, our sense of value, of the object 
to be accomplished will inspire us to decrease our 
consumption. We shall be saving for victory. 

In a sense the United States is taking part in a great 
cooperative experiment. It has entered the family 
of nations. It has assumed tremendous responsibilities. 
Its allies are dependent on it and expect high perform- 
ance from it. Yet unless we practice among ourselves 
what are no more than a few minor deprivations, west- 
ern civilization can not go on. It may be reiterated 
once more that the necessity for these economics is 
actually independent of any political or military 
events which may supervene in the immediate future. 
The world crisis compels them. 

In conclusion let us again define the situation that 
confronts us, so we may realize how great is the task 
to which we have pledged our honor and our faith. 

Take the basic food of the world — wheat. It seems 
probable that all that we now have plus what we can 
raise this year plus the Canadian crop will amount to 
about 1,000,000,000 bushels. We and Canada would 
ordinarily eat half of that. We need to save in addi- 
tion seed for next year and a small safety margin. 
This brings our joint total needs up to 700,000,000 
bushels, and leaves 300,000,000 for export. The 
imperative needs of our allies in addition to what they 
raise themselves are just twice that amount. The 
problem then is to meet the difference between the 
600,000,000 bushels that they need and the 300,000,000 
bushels that we have to send them. 

Perhaps it will be more comprehensible if we drop 
the terms of bushels and express the problm in units. 



LESSONS ON FOOD CONSERVATION 9 

assuming that every unit represents 10,000,000 bushels 
of wheat. On that basis we and Canada together have 
100 units of wheat. We need 70 units for ourselves 
and so can spare 30 units. But our allies need 60 
units of wheat. The problem then is to make the 30 
units that we can spare fit their need for 60 units. 

The only solution then lies in sharing the inescapable 
privations and sacrifices. We know that we have 
30 units to spare, and it may be that by sacrifice and 
economy we can increase that to 45 \mits. Our allies 
need 60 units, but it may be that by sacrifice and econ- 
omy they can get along on 45. The present prospects 
are that in any event 5 units of wheat will be sunk 
by the submarines, but that we must try to avoid. 
Our immediate duty is to save and send overnseas 
450,000,000 bushels of wheat, when we have only 
two-thirds of that amount to spare. If each of us 
should eat three and one-half slices of bread for every 
five slices we each have been accustomed to, the desired 
result would be achieved, the victorious conclusion 
of the war would be assured, and tens of thousands 
of deaths from starvation would be avoided. 

I. SAVE THE WHEAT 
The Wheat Supply of the World 

Despite the rigid measure adopted to reduce con- 
sumption among the allies, they will require to import 
next year larger amounts of cereals and meats than ever 
before. The large failure of the winter wheat harvest 
in France and England, larger consmnption by armies 
in the field and munition workers, the reduced produc- 
tivity of the land by reduction in man power, the sink- 



10 ADVICE TO THE HOUSEWIFE 

ing of cargoes by submarines all pile up one increasing 
demand upon another^ despite the efforts of the 
women in the fields. Moreover, the allies are more 
isolated to-day in their sources of food than ever before, 
even during the war. It requires three times the 
tonnage and double the danger to bring wheat from 
Australia and India than from the Atlantic seaboard, 
and to-day these sources are largely unavailable. 
The crop failure in the Argentine gives no hope from 
that quarter until next March or April, and the allies 
are, of course, isolated from the normal supply of 
Russia, Roumania, and Bulgaria. They are thus 
dependent upon North America for the vast majority 
of their food imports. 

In a general way it may be stated that this country 
normally produces a surplus of most commodities, and 
that our problem is to secure the effective and econom- 
ical distribution of these suppUes; to induce as large 
an export surplus for the benefit of our allies as we can; 
to protect om* own requirements; to ask the whole 
community to assist us in building up this surplus 
by every effort of economy that we can devise, and to 
set up such machinery as will furnish this balance 
wheel on prices. 

At best the food of our allies will be a privation loaf, 
and every ounce we can add to it is a contribution to 
, their strength and constancy in the war. 

I think that it is recognized by all thinking men that 
the world war and the economic forces which have been 
set up have disorganized the ordinary balances and 
checks on prices. For instance, the price of wheat 
in normal times is a factor, not only of supply in the 
United States, but all the supplies in every country 
in the world.

The United States Must Conserve Wheat 

1. By eliminating waste in the use of all breads and 
cereal products. 

2. By eating more vegetables in place of other foods, 
especisJly during the summer months. 

3. By substituting for wheat breads those breads 
which, whether made at home or by the baker, com- 
bine with wheat flour from 10 to 25 per cent of other 
cereal products or suitable flours or meals, as peanut 
flour, soy-bean flour, or with potato or sweet potato. 

By using other cereals for bread making — ^for in- 
stance, rye, which will make a yeast-raised bread, 
and others, Hke com, oatmeal, kaffir, and buckwheat, 
which can be used without flour to make '' quick 
breads," such as com pone, buckwheat shortcake, 
oat cake, and kafib pone. 

1. Eliminating Waste of Bread 

1. Through the efforts of the food administration 
many wholesale bakers have agreed to stop taking 
back unsold bread from the retailers. This alone 
may save 5 per cent of the waste. We can not afford 
to sell stale bread for animal feed. The women of 
the coimtry must cooperate with the retailers and order 
their bread 24 hours before it is to be deUvered. 

2. The bakers are agreeing to put on the market 
fewer kinds of breads, and these in smaller sizes, so 
that here again waste will be lessened. 

3. All stale bread may be utilized through combin- 
ing bread crumbs in the making of quick breads, 
yeast breads, scalloped vegetables, and similar dishes 
and desserts. Cutting the loaf on the table as needed 
also tends to lessen waste. 



12 ADVICE TO THE HOUSEWIFE 

2. Conserriiig the Wheat through Increasing the Proportion of 

Vegetables in the Diet 

We as a people are depending largely upon cereals 
for our energy supply. It is easily possible to use less 
cereal and make larger demands for energy on starchy 
vegetables. Our average consumption of potatoes 
per capita is about 9 ounces per day. If we could be 
induced to take an additional daily average of only 
4 ounces of potatoes — ^that is, about one good-sized 
potato — oiu* demand for bread would be reduced 
by about that amount per individual. Other heat- 
giving foods, such as sweet potatoes, bananas, com, 
peas, and beans, may be used to reduce the demand 
upon cereals. On such a basis we may advocate de* 
creased bread consumption. 

8. Conserving One-fourth Our Wheat through Using 

Liberty Breads 

For those of us who, through force of habit, demand 
bread three times a day, what is known as liberty bread 
may be used much more Uberally in place of the wheat- 
flour loaf. These liberty breads are made by using the 
entire wheat ground into flour or substituting other 
cereals for part of the wheat flour. Corn is the native 
American cereal upon which we can rely for bread. Alone 
or mixed with flour it can be used in very many ways 
as a foodstuff. It is no new thing to us, and in depend- 
ing upon it at this time we are only going back to earlier 
customs which have survived in the South more than 
in the North. It is sometimes said that too much 
corn is unwholesome, but this is not true. Pellagra, 
the disease once attributed to it, is not due to com, 
but to another cause. For centuries barley and rye 
have been staple breadstuffs. It is within recent years 



LESSONS ON FOOD CONSERVATION 13 

that barley has dropped out of the diet of Americans 
so largely as a breadstuff, though retained in some 
special forms, particularly in infant feeding. Returned 
to its former place, it will take the place of thousands 
of bushels of wheat and will produce a bread delicious 
in both flavor and texture. If we are willing to sub- 
stitute for wheat flour from 20 to 35 per cent of other 
cereals, we can easily free the wheat needed for ship- 
ment to the allies. 

Food Value and Importance of Bread in the Dietary 

In the United States wheat bread is universally 
used and has become the chief means of giving the 
needed energy in the diet. Its tissue^building power is 
below that of most animal foods, dried peas, and beans 
and is unsatisfactory unless supplemented by other 
food products. Our safety in its use Ues in the fact 
that we have always combined it in the diet with other 
foods — ^meat, peas, beans, or animal soups rich in 
gelatin. We measure its value primarily by the energy 
which it yields rather than by its power to supply 
protein, ash, and growth-regulating substances needed 
to build or repair body tissue, though even in this 
respect it is a valuable supplement to the materials 
on which we chiefly rely as tissue builders. 

Comparative Food Value and Cost of Different Cereal 

Products 

Estimates of the food values of the following common 

cereals are approximately equivalent. Patent flour, 

corn meal, rye, and rice yield about 1600 calories, 

and oatmeal 1800 calories, per poimd. 

Note. — It may be of local interest to secure from retailers in 
a town the price of the various cereals in 1913 as compared with 
the present price. 



14 ADVICE TO THE HOUSEWIFE 

Use Local Cereal Products 

A study should be made of the available local 
supply for the State or section of the country, using 
those cereals which are grown and ground in the imme- 
diate locaUty. Corn meal and rolled oats are avail- 
able in almost every section of the United States. Bar- 
ley and rye are less generally grown and sold in the retail 
markets. Rice may be used in so many other ways 
that its use in bread making is a minor factor. There 
promises to be a large yield of buckwheat which may 
be used in conserving our wheat supply. What we 
need to push is the use of barley flour, buckwheat 
flour, and rye flour. Kaffir and other grain sorghums 
are to be noted also, as they are of especial value in the 
sections in which they are grown. There is no dif- 
ficulty in grinding and putting upon the market any of 
these products. It may not be wise at this time to 
advocate the seUing of blended flours, as under the 
internal-revenue act it makes the work of the food 
commission arduous. Do your own blending in mak- 
ing homemade products. 

Emergency Breads 

Selection for Demonstration. Three from the follow- 
ing Ust of products: 

Com-meal griddle cakes, oatmeal muffins, and Indian 
pudding are suggested. 

Introductory StatemerUs. Make it a principle to 
increase the use of corn meal to the maximum. Pound 
for pound, the energy value of com meal is equivalent 
to that of wheat flour. Every time corn meal is used 
where before we used wheat products^ we are helping 
to win the war. 



LESSONS ON FOOD CONSERVATION 15 

Have corn-meal mush for breakfast; add figs, dates, 
or other fruit, for variety;^ serve fried mush; use corn 
meal in quick breads, yeast breads, desserts. The 
breads are Ught, palatable, and capable of frequent use 
in the weekly dietary. Likewise, make the maximum 
use of oatmeal or rolled oats. Omit all wheat break- 
fast cereals. Use oatmeal or rolled oats, and secure 
variety through adding fruit. Use rolled oats to con- 
serve one-fourth the wheat in making muffins, rolls, 
and yeast-raised bread. 

Proportions and Directions

Corn-meal and Oatmeal Teast Breads 

Introductory StaUments. Corn-meal yeast bread, 
satisfactory in texture and mild in flavor, can be made 
using 20 per cent by measure or 25 per cent by weight 
of total cereal as com meal. The flavor of white corn 
meal is less distinctive and the bread made from it 
differs in color from that of the usual wheat loaf less 
than that made from the yellow meal. These breads 
may be made by combining dry corn meal with the 
flour, but the product is less satisfactory than that in 
which the meal is first cooked as for corn-meal mush. 
The manipulation is the same as for wheat bread, 
except that it is a little more diffiicult to knead into the 
mush the full amount of flour and the dough is some- 
what softer and stickier. Baking should occur in a 
slower oven, and should continue over a longer period — 
at least an hour. 

Oatmeal yeast bread is coarser than wheat bread 
and is not unlike graham bread in appearance. It has 
a sweet, nutty flavor, much liked by persons who care 
for whole wheat or dark breads. Some care is neces- 
sary in combining the rolled oats with the mixture. 
The most satisfactory method has been found to be that 
of pouring the hot liquid over the rolled oats, allowing 
the mixture to cool rather slowly (about half an 
hour). Longer soaking of the oats produces a some- 
what moister bread. The manipulation is the same as 
for wheat bread. The dough is a bit softer. Baking 
requires about 45 minutes. 



18 ADVICE TO THE HOUSEWIFE 

Proportions and Directions 

All proportions are for one loaf. The amount of yeast 
provides for a very short process — 3i to 4 hours. One-half the 
yeast suggested will make bread in 5 hours. 

One cake of dry yeast used as a starter should produce yeast 
for six loaves. In all cases the amount of liquid should be 
equal to that added with the compressed yeast in the recipe 
given. 

COHN-MEAL YEAST BREAD (1 LOAF)

Let rise imtil about double its bulk, knead again, and put in 
the pan. When light, bake in a moderate oven for at least 
an hour. 

In mixing the dough the flour and corn meal are to be used 
as separate ingredients, because the corn meal must be scalded 
or a grainy bread results. When the corn meal mixture is 
removed from the stove, the housewife will doubt her abihty 
to add the amount of floor called for. The flour will work 
in, as required, but a stiffer, stickier dough than that to which 
she is accustomed will result.

Use Barley, Rye, Boiled Rice, and Boiled Potato in 

Bread Making 

Cottonseed Flour — Demonstration of Barley, Rye, Itico, or 

Potato Flour Yeast Breads 

Selection for Demonstration. Two of above breads, 
according to local and available products. 

Barley Yeast Bread. Introductory statements: Bread 
may be made using wheat flour and barley flour in 
mixtures containing from 33} to 50 per cent barley 
flour. The bread containing one-third barley flour 
is light, palatable, and of especially pleasant flavor. 
A larger percentage produces a heavier, darker bread 
of pronounced barley flavor. The manipulation for 
this bread is the same as for wheat bread. The con- 
ditions and time for baking are also the same. The 
loaf is smaller. 

Proportions and directions: 

BARLEY YEAST BREAD 

1 cup milk and water, or water 

(8 oz.)- IJ cups barley flour (4 oz.). 

1 tablespoon sugar H oz.)* 2} cups wheat flour (9} oz.). 

1 tablespoon fat (i oz.). i cake compressed yeast (i oz.). 

1 teaspoon salt (i oz.). 

Soften the yeast in part of the liquid. Combine ingredients. 
Mix into a dough. Knead and let rise to double original bulk. 
Knead again. Put in the pan, and when again double in bulk 
bake about 45 minutes. 

Rye Yeast Bread. Introductory statements: Com- 
mercial rye breads are made of a mixture of wheat and 
lye flours, known in the trade as 50-50. Rye flour 



20 ADVICE TO THE HOUSEWIFE 

has much less expansion than wheat flour; hence the 
loaves are smaller. The manipulation is the same 
throughout as for wheat bread. 
Proportions and directions: 

RYE YEAST BREAD 

1 cup milk and water, or water 

(8 oz.)- 2i cups rye flour (7 oz.). 

1 tablespoon fat (} oz.). 2i cups wheat flour (9 oz.). 

2 tablespoons sugar (1 oz.). } cake compressed yeast (} oz.) 
1 teaspoon salt (} oz.). 2 tablespoons water (1 oz.). 

Combine ingredients. Mix into dough and knead. Let 
rise until double original bulk. Knead again. When again 
double bulk, bake about 45 minutes. 

Rice Yeast Bread. Rice has many other uses, as in 
puddings, etc., and is much in demand among the allies. 
Therefore its use should not be stressed in connection 
with emergency breads. 

Cooked rice, combined with wheat flour makes 
deUcious muffins and yeast bread. There are many 
ways of cooking the rice. The basic principles may- 
be stated as follows: First, cook the rice so as to con- 
serve all mineral matter and other soluble products. 

Method: After the rice is thoroughly washed it 
should be put in a thick iron kettle or stoneware baking 
dish, cold water added so that the water stands three- 
quarters of an inch to an inch clear above the rice. 
A heavy or weighted cover should be used to seal the 
dish. Cook slowly over direct heat or in the oven 
until all the water has been absorbed and the grains 
are soft and steam escapes from the vessel. This is 
the Japanese method. The second method, more 
frequently used in the United States, is to lise a very 
large amount of boiling water to a small amount of 



LESSONS ON FOOD CX)NSERVATION 21 

rice, the rice being added slowly enough not to stop the 
boiling. The water is boiled briskly 20 minutes, or 
until the kernels are tender. Then it is drained in a 
colander or strainer, set on the back of the stove, 
or put in a sUghtly warm oven or in a pan over hot 
water, to dry ofiE a bit. There results a flufify mass of 
large, plump grains, each perfectly distinct in itself, 
instead of the gummy mush so often served as boiled 
rice. 

The rice yeast bread is very white in color, is moister 
than wheat bread, and keeps moist longer. It is 
handled in much the same manner as wheat bread. 
The first dough, however, is much stiflfer, and after once 
rising the hght dough is so soft that it can not be 
kneaded with the hands. It should be well stirred 
with a strong spoon and placed in the pans, looking 
much like a stiff drop batter. After baking, the upper 
crust is less smooth than that of our famiUar wheat 
flour loaf. 

Proportions and directions: 

These amounts make two large or three small loavea oi bread.

Potato Yeast Bread. Introductory statements : Boiled 
potatoes, mashed and combined with wheat flour may 
be used in making a bread of good flavor and texture. 



22 ADVICE TO THE HOUSEWIFE 

The potato bread is slightly darker in color than 
patent flour bread and is also somewhat more moist. 
It is relished by persons who do nor care for any but 
so-called " white bread.'' Two manipulations are 
satisfactory. Either all the flour may be added in 
the first mixture, making a dough which is very stiff 
and difficult to knead or a part of the flour may be 
reserved and added with the second kneading. In 
either case the dough is soft at the second handling, 
but after baking it produces a satisfactory loaf. 
Proportions and directions: 

The following amounts make three loaves of bread. 

POTATO YEAST BREAD 

} cup milk and water, or water 

(4 oz.). 4 cups boiled potatoes.

II. SAVE THE MEAT 
World Supply of Meats 

The world's available supply of meat is not sufficient 
to meet the needs of the United States and of our allies 
unless we practice economy, particularly in the con- 
sumption of those meats which are readily transported, 
namely, beef, mutton, and pork. 

Any attempt to give exact figures which will state 
the world's supply of meat is hopeless, but a few figures 
may indicate the condition in the United States 
January 1, 1917. At that time we had 63,617,000 
cattle, 67,453,000 swine, and 48,483,000 sheep. This 
includes all dairy stock, which must be saved to meet 
the increasing demand for milk and milk products. 



LESSONS ON FOOD CONSERVATION 23 

The figures for France, England, and Italy are all of 
them at least a year old, and therefore can not be given 
as representing present conditions. France has 
attempted to save her dairy cattle. The sale of 
meat has been restricted by legislation. The horses 
killed at the front are shipped directly to Paris for sale 
in the public markets. Even this additional supply 
has not met the demand, so that the sale of meat is not 
only restricted in amount to individuals but is also 
restricted to certain days in the week. England, be- 
cause of lack of cattle feed due to the increased acreage 
devoted to raising field crops for human consumption, 
is reducing her total livestock through increased slaugh* 
ter for hiunan use. Her food regulations, issued in 
May of this year, therefore show a definite increase 
in the amount of meat that may be purchased per 
individual. This condition must necessarily be tem- 
porary, and England will be again reduced to a very 
restricted meat requirement. France and Italy have 
long used meat economically, depending upon the use 
of small amounts of meat to make the vegetable prod- 
ucts savory, either in the form of soups or stews or 
pastries. 

General HaUt of Meat Consumption ia the United 

States 

When the British commission was sent over from 
England in 1909 to study the living conditions of the 
American workmen as contrasted with the conditions of 
the English workmen, they published a voluminous 
report as the result of the study in all sections of the 
East, Middle West, and South. These studies showed 
conclusively that the diet of the American people was 



24 ADVICE TO THE HOUSEWIFE 

very much better than the diet of the English workmen, 
but the striking point was our lavish use of our meat 
supply. This, in spite of the fact that the lessening 
of the free pasture land and the increased cost of feed 
grains had brought about a condition of lessened 
meat production relative to the population of the 
country. Careful summaries show that the present 
daily consumption of beef is S-jfir ounces per capita, 
and of pork 4if^ ounces per capita.^ The suggestion 
that is being made is that we as a people reduce 
this total consumption 1 ounce per day, and if 
possible an additional ounce be replaced by the use 
of all kinds of fish, preferably a local supply; by 
increased use of whole cream cheese and a local use of 
poultry and eggs, where the prices are not prohibitive. 
If the suggestion of doubUng the quantity of vegetables 
used is followed, the diet will be improved in variety 
without lowering its nutritive value. 

Need of Tissue Building in the Diet 

The need of tissue-building material in the diet is 
so well understood that the only discussion necessary 
here is in connection with the amount of protein and 
the character of the protein in the foods available for 
man. All proteins are made up of complex nitrogen 
products, which are often called '' building stones." 

Some proteins contain these *' building stones " in 
proper proportion for the building of new tissue. 
Others lack some of the essential *' building stones.'' 
The foods containing the first type are called com- 
plete or eflScient tissue-building foods. The others 
are known as incomplete or inefl&cient tissue-building 
foods. The value of meats in the diet lies in the fact 

i This includes refuse or meAt as purchased. 



LESSONS ON FOOD CONSERVATION 25 

that they belong to the complete type of protein foods, 
and therefore when used Uberally in the diet the neces- 
sity for intelligent choice is eliminated. The list 
of perfect or efficient proteins includes beef, veal, 
mutton, lamb, pork, poultry, game, fish, cheese, 
milk, and eggs. The inefficient proteins, those which 
need supplementing with more or less from those of the 
first group are soy bean, peanuts, navy beans, wax 
beans, kidney beans, lima beans, dried peas, lentils, 
nuts, corn, wheat, oats, barley, rye, buckwheat, 
gelatin. 

For the yoimg child, the youth and anyone recover- 
ing from a wasting disease there must be combinations 
of protein foods which will give the right combination 
of ** building stones." As has been stated, for the 
young child milk stands first on the list. For the adult 
the need for large amounts of the more nearly perfect 
proteins is not apparent. Their diet can be more 
easily restricted to a Umited use of the first list and a 
liberal use of the second. 

Adequate Combinations of Protein Foods 

In any discussion of exchange values in this class of 
foods the relative digestibility of the proteins is an 
important factor. The proteins in the first list are, 
as a rule, quite completely and easily digested. The 
proteins of the second group are not so easily or com- 
pletely digested. They contain a great deal of what is. 
called ** roughage," which while it has the advantage 
of aiding in the quicker elimination of waste material 
from the aUmentary canal, has the disadvantage of not 
permitting the protein to be so completely absorbed. 
In some cases bacterial action in the alimentary canal 
may be increased with this type of food, hence in- 



26 ADVICE TO THE HOUSEWIFE 

dividual peculiarities may prevent their more liberal 
use. As a general rule, the proper combinations of 
these foods may be given as follows: 

Cereals do not help each other out because their 
*' building stones " do not supplement each other. 

Legumes (peas, peanuts, and beans) do not help 
each other for the very same reason. 

Most legumes, combined with cereals, make a more 
nearly efficient protein combination. 

Gelatin supplements the lack of some of the '' build- 
ing stones " in most of the cereals, but it does not help 
out the lack in the legumes. 

The combination of any of these with milk or cheese 
or meat or eggs is efficient. 

Safe Standard to Follow 

The diet of the American people should be so selected 
that the average for men, women, and children is at 
least 70 grams (about 2| ounces) of protein a day. 
One-fourth to one-third of this may come from cereal 
foods, one-seventh may come from milk and its prod- 
ucts, one-seventh to two-sevenths from animal pro- 
teins, the remainder to be secured from a wise com- 
bination of vegetables and fruit. The detail of this 
is a study by itself. 

Working Program 

Because of the diffictdty of securing adequate trans- 
portation facilities, it is wise to use very largely the 
local supply of animal foods, discouraging as much as 
possible the killing of young animals, as veal and lamb. 
Poultry and eggs, game in season, and all varieties of 
fish should be used, but next to maintaining our regular 



LESSONS ON POOD CONSERVATION 27 

bread supply, the most important factor is to increase 
the use of milk in so far as our supply will admit. 
The present supply seems to indicate per capita allow- 
ance of about i quart a day. In case of lack of ade- 
quate amount for the family, it is wiser to Umit the 
use of the milk to direct consumption by children and 
to the use in the preparation of foods for the table. 
The utilization of the protein from the cereals in the 
feeding of the dairy cow shows that we recover more 
of the proteins in milk than we would if it were used to 
produce muscle. 

1. For example, we recover from 35 to 50 per cent 
of the protein in the feed when it comes to us in the 
form of milk, but only from 10 to 20 per cent in the 
form of beef proteins. In other words, we get 300 per 
cent more return on the investment through the con- 
sumption of milk. For this reason every ounce of the 
available milk supply should be used as food, either 
in the form of milk itself, whole or skim, or in the form 
of whole-milk cheese or cottage cheese and butter. 

2. Vegetable food, as peas, beans, peanuts, lentils, 
cereals, as oats, rye, barley, and any local supply of 
nuts may be used to supplement a milk, fish, or egg 
diet. 

3. No meat should be wasted. All left-over meats 
may be used as a source of flavor as follows: In vege- 
table soups, stews, goulashes, gravies, pies, creamed 
meats, cereal pilafs, chowders, casserole dishes, and 
with green vegetables. 

4. Fresh fish may be used in the same way that meats 
are used, and with proper choice of flavoring material, 
are often preferred to the meat dishes. 

5. Cheese may be used as a supplement to all of the 
group of protein foods that are listed under incom- 



28 ADVICE TO THE HOUSEWIFE 

plete proteins. The soup kitchens of the Germans 
may teach us many lessons on how to extend the use 
of meat as flavor. 

III. SAVE THE SUGAR 

In common parlance sugar refers to the *' cane sugar " 
obtained from sugar cane or beet root, but the chemist 
distinguishes between various kinds. The latter vary 
more in flavor than in final digestibility and food 
value. The use of sugar (present in fruits, vegetables, 
etc.) in the United States has been on an average 
practically 4 ounces per day per capita. While not 
all of us use 4 ounces of. sugar daily, many of us will be 
found to use that amount and even more if we include 
all forms of sweets, i.e., not only the sugar eaten on 
fruits and cereals, or in tea, coffee, etc., but also that 
used in general cooking, and in cakes, desserts, pre- 
serves, candies, " soft drinks," etc. The fact that 
there is now a limited supply to meet all demands for 
sugar will require us to reduce our consumption. 
From present indications it would seem that if we 
could reduce it to an average of 3 ounces daily we would 
meet the situation. The experience in Europe seems 
to indicate that the use of sugar is largely for the psy- 
chological effect of the sweet flavor, which helps make 
palatable the less highly flavored foods such as cereals. 
It, has been used in the armies in the form of jams. 
Ian Hay tells some amusing stories of Enghsh " Tom- 
mies " who would face any danger cheerfully, but 
broke into open rebellion when deprived of their 
strawberry marmalade. 

Americans have come to consider a generous amount 
of sugar as a necessij^y of life, but on analysis we find 



LESSONS ON FOOD CX)NSERVATION 29 

that its use can be defended only on the psychological 
ground of the palatability its flavor lends to the diet, 
and (under special conditions of muscular exertion) on 
the ground that its energy becomes available to the 
body more rapidly than that of the other nutrients. 

On the other hand, the excessive use of sugar is not 
only economically extravagant but may cause digestive 
disturbances. The amount which one can eat with 
impunity depends on the muscular activity, the amount 
of other foods in the diet, and, in case large quantities 
of sugar are consumed, on the tolerance of the individ- 
ual for it. Persons of great muscular activity, Uke 
athletes, soldiers on exhausting marches, or the never- 
quiet schoolboy, require more energy-yielding food than 
less active persons of the same size and weight, and their 
craving for sweets may be legitimate. Under-nourished 
children of the city poor, who spend their pennies for 
candies, may obtain in this way a desirable supplement 
to their inadequate meals. But where the meals are 
adequate or even excessive, eating sweets in addition 
overtaxes the digestive organs, tends to corpulency, 
and spoils the appetite for less highly flavored but 
equally nutritious food. The latter consideration is 
of especial importance with children, whose appetite 
for sweets is much stronger than that of adults and than 
their own appetite for the more essential tissue-build- 
ing foods. 

Working Program 

As a working program on reducing the present use 
of sugar the following may be recommended : 

1. Train the family to use little or no sugar on the 
breakfast cereals or replace by fruits eaten with the 
cereal or dried fruits, raisins,^ dates, etc., cooked with 



30 ADVICE TO THE HOUSEWIFE 

it. Most palates crave less sugar on these foods if the 
latter are well cooked and carefully salted. 

2. Reduce the use of soft drinks, lemonade, etc., in 
the making of which sugar is used very liberally. 

3. In preparing the food for the family give prefer- 
ence to recipes which call for less sugar, and if possible 
omit it from yeast bread; reduce the use of candies 
and cakes, especially kinds in which large quantities 
of sugar are used. Especially discourage the eating 
of candy between abundant meals. 

4. Use sirups, as com sirup, apple sirup, and other 
fruit sirups, molasses and sorghum sirups, and honey 
wherever it is possible to utilize these products in the 
place of ordinary sugar. Remember that a good 
sirup can be made on the farm from apple '' culls " 
and used as a table sirup or in cooking. 

5. Use more fruits, both fresh and dried, to give 
the desired sweet flavor to the diet* 

IV. SAVE THE FAT 

It has been estimated that on the average over 3} 
ounces (about 96 grams) of fat purchased as such — 
that is, butter and other table fats, cooking fats and 
cooking and table oils — ^are included in the food pro- 
vided for each person in the United States. This could 
be cut down to a little over 2 ounces (60 grams) without 
danger to health, provided the kinds of fat used were 
carefully chosen and all the fat from meat trimmings 
and meat cookery were used to advantage. At present 
fats are chosen more for pleasant flavor and culinary 
convenience than with reference to their distinctive 
nutritive value. The waste from this class of foods is 
large. City garbage has been found to yield from 



LESSONS ON FOOD CX>NSERVATION 31 

35 to 40 pounds of fat per ton, all coming from homes, 
hotels, and restaurants. 

If fat were needed only for the production of energy 
in the body, it would be a relatively simple matter to 
cut down on our use of lard, butter, table oils, and other 
separated fats, and depend more on cereals, potatoes, 
and other starchy foods. Recent discoveries regarding 
the substances which regulate the growth and repair 
of body tissue, however, have shown that such a course 
would not be safe. Associated with fat in certain food 
materials, especially in the fat of milk and eggs, such 
meat fats a^ suet, and the small amounts of fat found 
in the green leaves of potherbs and salad plants are 
minute quantities of recently discovered and as yet 
unnamed substances most important in nutrition. 
These are sometimes referred to as '' growth deter- 
minants." When these are lacking, even in an other- 
wise adequate diet, growth of new tissue and repair 
of old does not take place as it normally should. We do 
not^yet know exactly how much of these substances is 
found in different kinds of fats, or how much is needed 
by children or adults, but it is now impossible to con- 
sider the question of fat in the diet without consider- 
ing them. 

Conditions in the warring nations of Europe where 
the fat ration has been cut to the lowest limit have 
shown that such a practice hinders the normal growth 
of children, the maintenance of health in adults, and the 
repair of body tissue after wounds. 

The list of foods in which these ''growth deter- 
minants '' are chiefly found includes egg yolk, butter, 
cream, rich milk, cream cheese, and the leaves of most 
of the growing plants that are used for greens or salad. 
Lower in the list will come the table butter substitutes 



32 ADVICE TO THE HOUSEWIFE 

— suet, beef drippings, and possibly goose and chicken 
fats. It is possible that the other animal fats and most, 
if not all, of the vegetable oils lack this ''growth 
determinant/' 

V. METHODS OP ELIMINATING WASTE 

(a) Eliminate waste by utilizing all fat left from 
meats. This is probably the most important house- 
hold method of reducing the consumption of fat. A 
great many women do not realize that the trimmings 
from beefy pork, mutton, and fowl can be rendered and 
used in cookery instead of fats specially piu'chased for 
that purpose. Directions for preparing and using 
them will be found in any good cookbook. 

In some households the amount of fats which accu- 
mulates from the meats served is larger than can be used 
for cooking; in such cases it should be used for making 
soap, or it should be given away or sold to some one 
who will use it. Better still, its accumulation should 
be avoided by choosing and using meats more carefully. 

If the fat from meat trimmings or tried out in cookery 
is available, use it with rational economy when fat must 
be purchased for cookery. 

As far as possible avoid cooking by means of frying 
and saut^ing. If these methods are followed, use 
rendered fats such as those referred to, not fats specially 
purchased for the purpose. 

(6) Households in which cream is now freely used 
may with care reduce the amount consumed without 
greatly lessening attractiveness of the meals. ** Top 
milk " may be used in tea and coffee and on cereals, 
baked apples, etc. Unless the meal is otherwise lack- 
ing in fat, cream desserts should be sparingly used. 



LESSONS ON FOOD CONSERVATION 33 

Substituting water ices made with fresh fruits for ice 
cream not only saves fat but utilizes '' perishables." 

(c) We may save table butter by serving smaller 
portions; not because we should attempt to decrease 
materially the use of butter on the table, but because 
so often the portion served is larger than is needed or 
even desired. Although that which is left on the butter 
plates might be utilized for cooking, cheaper fats should 
be used for that purpose. 

The recommendation of the food administration is 
to eUminate the use of butter in cookery in order to 
make the supply go around so that we may have 
butter for table use. While all of us may not agree 
to this, still the more nearly we fulfill that request 
the more nearly will we meet the vital needs of our 
own people and the Army at the front. 

(d) Children should be trained and adults encour- 
aged to eat all the fat served with meat. This prevents 
waste and lessons the amount of separated fat needed 
in the daily food. 

In all of these recommendations we must remember 
the psychology of the individual is the most potent 
factor with which we have to deal. If the issue is 
pushed too hard or without great tact, we may defeat 
our own purpose to save a small portion of our food 
supply for those who are battling to maintain the object 
for which our nation was created — ^liberty and democ- 
racy.

INTRODUCTION 

How can the housekeeper tell whether or not she is 
providing the food which her family needs and is get- 
ting the best possible returns for the money she spends? 
Unfortunately, the price she pays for food is no test 
of the nourishment it yields to the body. Tomatoes 
at 5 or 10 cents apiece in winter do not build body 
tissues nor furnish fuel for the body engine any better 
than those at 5 cents a quart in summer, nor does fancy 
capon at 40 cents a pound nourish the healthy body

more generously than fowl at half the price. Appetite 
is not always a safe guide. A child's appetite might 
be satisfied with a diet of nothing but sugar, but this 
certainly would not be good for him. Neither can 
hunger and its satisfaction always be relied on. A 
bulky diet of potatoes or bananas alone would soon 
make a person feel that he had eaten enough, but would 
not furnish all that the body needs. 

Evidently what a person who plans meals ought to 
know is what things the body needs in its food and how 
these needs can be filled by the ordinary food materials. 
This paper is intended to give such information in a 
simple way. It should make plain that different 
kinds or classes of foods serve different uses in the body 
and should help the housekeeper to choose those which 
will serve all these uses without waste. 

The Day's Food 

A man who does fairly hard muscular work would be 
likely to get the food which his body needs if supplied 
daily with such a combination of foods as the following: 

1} pomids of bread, having about the same food value as 1 
pound of such cereal preparations as wheat or rye flour, 
oatmeal, com meal, rice, etc. 

2 oonoes, or i cup, of butter, oil, meat drippings, or other fat. 

2 ounces, or I cup, of sugar; or i cup of honey, or sirup, or an 
equivalent amount of other sweet. 

l\ pounds of food from the following: Fresh fruits and green 
or root vegetables. 

12 ounces of food from a class which may be called '* meats and 
meat substitutes "; that is, moderately fat meats, poultry, 
fish, eggs, cheese, dried legumes (beans, peas, lentils, cow- 
peas, and peanuts). Milk also belongs among these foods, 
but because of the large amount of water it contains half 
a glass, or 4 ounces, of it would be required to equal an 
ounce of any one of the others. 



36 ADVICE TO THE HOUSEWIFE 

A man who works hard out of doors all day probably 
would need more food than this, and one who sits all 
day at his desk would need less. The amouxfts given 
are suitable for a man who^ Uke a salesman in a store, 
walks about more or less and does more or less of such 
work as Ufting. 

A family consisting of a man and a woman who do 
moderately hard muscular work and three children — 
say, between 3 and 12 years of age — ^would get the food 
they require if supplied daily with: 

4} pounds of bread, having the same food value as 3 pounds of 
wheat or rye flour, oatmeal, com meal or hominy, or rice; 
or about 2} pounds of cereals and 5 or 6 medium-sized pota- 
toes. 

i cup of fat (butter or butter with oil, beef drippings, or other 
fat) — a weekly allowance of 2} to 3 pounds. 

A little more than 1 cup of sugar, or a weekly allowance of 4 
pounds; or an equivalent amount of some other sweet. 

4 pounds in all of fresh fruits and fresh or root vegetables. 
One of the two following, the choice depending on the age of 

the children: 

3 quarts of milk and 1 pound of other foods taken from the meat 
and meat-substitute group. 

2 quarts of milk and li pounds of other foods taken from the 
meat and meat-substitute group. 

This rather rough calculation is based on the assump- 
tion that cereals contain, on the average, about 12 
per cent protein, 1 per cent fat, and 75 per cent carbo- 
hydrates, and that 1 pound of bread contains about 
§ of a pound of cereal; that butter, oil, lard, and 
other fatty foods average 90 per cent fat; that fresh 
fruits and fresh and root vegetables average about 
i per cent protein and 10 per cent carbohydrates, with 
negligible quantities of fat; and that meats, fish, 
eggs, cheese, etc., as piu'chased, may be considered to 
average about 14 per cent each of protein and fat. 



WHAT THE BODY NEIEDS 37 

The estimate also assumes that all the fat obtained 
with the meats, etc., is utilized, being either eaten 
with the meat or saved for use in cookery. Under these 
conditions the fuel value of the diet would be about 
10,000 calories per family per day, or the equivalent 
amount of 3,000 calories per man per day; the protein 
value would be about 330 grams per family, or 100 
grams per man per day. 

The cereals in such a ration would include 1} pounds 
of bread, one ordinary-sized portion of rolled oats 
(one-fourth pound in all), and one of rice for each per- 
son (one-half pound in all), and a pound of flour for 
use in cooking. The meat and meat-substitute group 
would include 2 quarts of milk, 1 pound of beef, and two 
eggs. 

In such combinations of food materials bread and 
other preparatioAs of cereals are used as freely as 
they can be without making the ration one sided or 
unattractive. Such cereal foods form a very whole- 
some and economical basis for the diet, whether the 
cereal is used as a breakfast dish, as flour or meal in 
bread and cakes, or in other ways. A diet equally 
nourishing and wholesome might be planned with less 
cereal, but this wotdd make it necessary to increase 
the amount of the more costly foods, such as meat, 
fruits, vegetables, and sweets. When cereals are used 
as largely as in the diet just described it is most im- 
portant that they be made as attractive as possible. 
This means good bread, well-cooked and carefully 
salted breakfast cereals, and inexpensive but well-made 
and seasoned cakes and puddings. Rice, macaroni, 
and hominy can often be made more appetizing and 
nutritious by combining with them small amounts 
of materials which are not so cheap and have more 



38 ADVICE TO THE HOUSEWIFB 

distinctive flavors. Among these are meat and cheese, 
and onion, tomato, and other seasoning vegetables. 
Examples of such combinations are rice and meat,- 
meat pie, or meat with dumplings; macaroni and 
cheese; tomatoes cooked with bread crumbs or rice; 
and cereal and fruit puddings, or cereal and milk 
puddings. 

The following meals are given, not because they are 
recommended above many others that might be used, 
but simply to show that such foods can be combined 
into dishes such as are commonly used in American 
homes. 

SAMPLE MEALS FOR A FAMH^T 

(Man, woman, and three small children) 

BREAKFAST 

Fruit, H pounds of fresh fruit (equiyalent to 3 medium-sized 
oranges, 5 small apples, or a quart-box of strawberries), 
or 3 or 4 ounces of dried fruits (equivalent to 10 or 12 dates 
or 4 or 5 figs). 

Cereal breakfast food, 4 ounces before being cooked, or about 
1} pints after it is cooked. The equivalent in food value in 
puffed or flaked, ready-to-eat cereaJs would be 5 or 6 cups. 

Milk on cereal, i cup for each person. 

Sugar on fruit, on cereal, or in coffee, 2} level tablespoons or 
li ounces. 

Bread, 8 slices, or 8 ounces. 

Butter, li ounces, or 2i cubic inches. 

An egg or 2 ounces of meat, fish, or poultry for each older person 
and a glass of milk for each young child. 

DINNER 

Meat, or fish, } pound per grown person; or, for each child, 

an egg or a glass of milk. 
Potatoes (5 medium sised), 1} pounds. 
Another vegetable (turnips, spinach, com, cauliflower, or other), 

1 pound. 



WHAT THE BODY NEEDS 39 

Bread, 8 slices, or 8 ounces. 

Butter, li ounces, or 2} cubic inches. 

Steamed apple (or other fruit) pudding. (Ingredients: Two 

cups flour, 2 tablespoons butter, } cup milk, 4 apples, 1 

tablespoon sugar.) 
Sauce. (Ingredients: One-half cup sugar, H tablespoons flour, 

2 teaspoons butter, I cup water, flavoring.) 

SUPPER 

A gravy made out of 1 pint of skim milk, } cup flour, 2 level 
teaspoons butter, and 4 ounces salt or smoked fish (just 
enough for flavor). To this can be added the egg yolk 
left from the frosting of the cake. (See below.) 

Rice, 8 ounces, or 1 cup, measured before being cooked. 

Bread, 8 slices, or 8 ounces. 

Butter, 11 ounces, or 2} cubic inches. 

One-half of a cake. (Ingredients for whole cake: One-fourth 
cup butter, i cup sugar, 1 egg, i cup milk, 1| cups flour, 
2} teaspoons baking powder.) 

Frosting made with 1 egg white and } cup sugar. 

What fhe Day's Food Should Provide 

The above meals would supply the following sub- 
stances in about the right proportions to keep the family 
in healthful condition and to make the food taste 
good, providing they were well prepared. 

A. Mineral substances of great variety (lime salts, 
compounds of phosphorus, iron, and others). — ^These 
are used by the body for building material and are found 
in all parts of it. They also produce substances within 
the body tissues which tend to offset acid substances 
produced in the tissues in the course of digestion of 
meats and cereals and serve many other important 
uses. Without fruits and vegetables the meals would 
be likely to lack certain mineral substances. With- 
out milk they would be lacking in a mineral substance 
specially needed by children; that is, lime. 



40 ADVICE TO THE HOUSEWIFE 

B. Protein, — ^Protein serves as fad for the body and 
also provides a certain important element, nitrogen, 
which is needed in the case of children for growth and 
in the case of both children and grown people to keep 
the body in repair. Without the meat or meat sub- 
stitutes (incIucUng milk) the meals would be lacking 
in this body-building material. 

C. Starch. — ^This is one of the chief fuels of the body 
and is supplied mainly by the cereal foods. 

D. Sugar. — ^This serves as fuel for the body and to 
flavor the food. It is found in milk, fresh fruits and 
many other materials but unless small amounts of very 
sweet materials — sugar itself, sirup, or. honey — are 
used, the diet is likely to be lacking in it. 

E. Fat. — ^This serves as body fuel and also improves 
the flavor and texture of the food. It is present in 
meats, nuts, and many other foods, but unless small 
amoxmts of specially fat materials, like butter, oil, or 
cream, are used, the meals are likely to be lacking in 
it. Moreover, dishes cooked without a certain amount 
of fat and meals served without butter or some 
substitute seem, to most persons, dry and unpala- 
table. 

F. CeUvlose. — This is the material which makes up 
the framework of plants. It gives bulk to the diet 
and may tend to prevent constipation. Without the 
fruits and vegetables the meals would be lacking in 
this important element. 

G. Certain newly discovered substances in very small 
anumnts, which are believed to play an important part 
in keeping people well and in promoting the growth of 
children. Without milk in the diet some of these sub- 
stances, particularly those necessary for children, 
would be lacking, and without meat, milk, eggs, fruits, 



WHAT THE BODY NEEDS 41 

and vegetables others needed by persons of all ages 
might not be present in sufficient amounts. 

H. Flavorings and condimenU. — In most families 
some materials are used in preparing or serving food 
which add to the attractiveness of the meals without 
furnishing the body any nourishment. Among these 
are salt, pepper, vinegar, lemon juice, spices, season- 
ing herbs, horse-radish, flavoring extracts, and many 
other materials often spoken of as '' condiments." 
These are not discussed at length, because they are not 
absolutely needed by the body. They may, however, 
be very useful in making an otherwise unattractive diet 
taste good. In fact, the secret of making inexpensive 
meals attractive lies largely in the skillful use of season- 
ing and flavors, and in this way may well be worth the 
cost they add to the diet even if they do not increase 
its actual food value. 

Any kind of food contains one or more of the sub- 
stances just described, and they are combined in as 
many different ways as there are kinds of food. A 
satisfactory diet contains all of them and each in its 
proper proportion, and the problem of planning meals 
is really that of choosing foods which will do this. 

Grouping Foods to Show Their Uses 

Perhaps as easy a way as any to select the right foods 
is to group the different kinds according to their uses 
in the body and then to make sure that all the groups 
are represented regularly in the meals. Fortunately 
no more than five groups need be considered: (1) 
Fruits and vegetables; (2) meats and other protein^ 
rich foods; (3) cereals and other starchy foods; (4) 
sweets; and (5) fatty foods. The materials under 



42 advicb1to2the_ housewife 

each of these heads have their special uses. It will 
be helpful, therefore, for the housekeeper to form the 
habit of thinking of the many different kinds of food 
which she handles as grouped in some such way as 
the following: 

Group 1. — Fruits and vegetables, such as apples, 
bananas, berries, citrus fruits, spinach and other 
greens, turnips, tomatoes, melons, cabbage, green 
beans, green peas, green com, and many other vegeta- 
bles and fruits. Without these the food would be 
lacking in mineral substances needed for building the 
body and keeping it in good working condition; in 
acids which give flavor, prevent constipation, and serve 
other useful purposes; and in minute quantities of 
other substances needed for health. By giving bulk 
to the diet they make it more satisfying to the appetite. 

Group 2. — Meat and meat substitutes, or protein* 
rich foods: Moderately fat meats, milk, poultry, fish, 
cheese, eggs, dried legumes (beans, peas, lentils, cow- 
peas, peanuts), and some of the nuts. These are 
soiurces of an important body-building material, 
protein. In the case of children part of the protein 
food should always be whole milk. 

Group 3. — Foods rich in starch: Cereals (wheat, 
rice, rye, barley, oats, and corn) and potatoes (white 
and sweet). Cereals come near to being complete 
foods, and in most diets they supply more of the 
nourishment than any other Idnd of food. It is not 
safe, however, to hve only on cereals. The grains may 
be simply cleaned and partially husked before cooking, 
as in cracked wheat and Scotch oatmeal; they may be 
ground into flour and used as the basis of breads, 
cakes, pastry, etc. ; or they may be partially cooked at 
the factory, as in many breakfast preparations; or 



WHAT THE BODY NEEDS 43 

they may be prepared in the form of such pastes as 
macaroni^ noodles, etc. In all these forms they furnish 
the body with the same general materials, though in 
different proportions. 

Group 4. — Sugar (granulated, pulverized, brown, and 
maple), honey, molasses, sirup, and other sweets. 
Unless some of the fuel is in this form the diet is likely 
to be lacking in flavor. 

Group 5. — Foods very rich in fat: Bacon, salt pork, 
butter, oil, suet, lard, cream, etc. These are important 
sources of body fuel. Without a little of them the food 
would not be rich enough to taste good. 

Some food materials really belong in more than one 
group. Cereals, for example, supply protein as well as 
starch; potatoes supply starch as well as the mineral 
matters, acids, cellulose, and body-regulating sub- 
stances, for which they are especially valuable; and 
most meat supplies fat as well as protein. For the sake 
of simplicity, however, each material is here grouped 
according to the nutrient for which it is usually con- 
sidered most valuable. These points are all brought 
out in more detail in other bulletins which discuss the 
special groups. 

The lists given below show some of the common food 
materials arranged in these five groups. If the house- 
keeper will consult them in planning meals until she 
has learned where each kind of food belongs, she will 
have taken the first step toward providing a diet 
which will supply all the food needs of her family. 
It will be only one step, to be siu-e, but it should pre- 
vent two mistakes — ^that of serving meals that have 
not sufficient variety, and that of cutting down in the 
wrong places when economy either of time or money 
is needed: 



44 ADVICE TO THE HOUSEWIFE 

Gboup 1. — Foods depended on for mineral maUers, vegetable aeide, 

and body^egvlating auhstances 

Fruits: Vegetables: 

Apples, peara, etc. Salads — lettuce, celery, etc. 

Bananas. Potherbs or " greens." 

Berries. Potatoes and root vege- 

Melons. tables. 

Oranges, lemons, etc. Green peas, beans, etc. 

Tomatoes, squash, etc. 

Gboup 2,^^Foode depended on Jot protein. 

Milk, skim milk, cheese, etc. Fish. 

Eggs. Dried peas, beans, cowpeas. 

Meat. etc. 

Poultry. Nuts. 

Gboup 3. — Foode depended on for starch. 

Cereal grains, meals, flours, etc. Cakes, cookies, starchy pud- 
Cereal breakfast foods dings, etc. 
Bread. Potatoes and other starchy 
Crackers. vegetables. 
Macaroni and other pastes. 

Gboup 4. — Foode depended on for sugar. 

Sugar. Candies. 

Molasses. Fruits preserved in sugar, Jel- 

Sirups. lies, and dried fruits. 

Honey. Sweet cakes and desserts. 

Gboup 6. — Foods depended on for fat. 

Butter and cream. Salt pork and bacon. 

Lard, suet, and other cooking Table and salad oils, 
fats. 

Thinking of foods according to the group to which 
they belong or according to the nutrient which they 
supply in largest amount will help the housekeeper 
to see whether in the meals she plans she has supplied 
all the different materials needed, especially whether 



WHAT THE BODY NEEDS 45 

there is the necessary, though small, amount of tissue- 
building mineral matters and body-regulating materials 
(group 1), and of tissue-building protein (group 2). 
When she has made sure that these are present, she 
may safely build up the bulk of the diet from whatever 
materials from the other groups seem economical, 
wholesome, and appetizing. By means of this group- 
ing she will be reminded that meals consisting only 
of cereal mush (group 3) served with butter (group 5) 
and sirup (group 4) would not be a complete ration 
and would almost surely be lacking in body-building 
material, because there are no foods from either group 1 
(fruits and vegetables) or group 2 (protein rich). It 
will become clear, also, that a school lunch of a kind 
far too frequently served, consisting of bread and 
cake, is lacking in the same way, and that a glass of 
milk (group 2) and an apple or an orange (group 1) 
would make it far more nearly complete. She will 
learn the wisdom of serving fruit (group 1) rather 
than a whipped-cream dessert (group 5) or a suet 
pudding (groups 3 and 5) after a course including a 
generous portion of fat meat (groups 2 and 5). 

The grouping will also help the housekeeper who 
wishes to save money or time to simplify her meals with- 
out making them one-sided or incomplete. For ex- 
ample, if she has been serving bread, potatoes, and rice 
or hominy in one meal, she will see that one or even 
two of them may be left out without omitting any 
important nutrient, providing a reasonable quantity 
of the one or two remaining is eaten. It will show her 
that a custard which is made of milk and eggs, two 
foods from group 2, would hardly be needed after a 
meal in which a liberal supply of meat had been served, 
provided one ate heartily of all, and that a child does 



46 ADVICE TO THE HOUSEWIFE 

not need milk at the same meal with an egg or meat. 
It will suggest that baked beans or other legumes, or 
thick soups made of legumes, are substitutes for meat 
rather than foods to be eaten with meat. 

This method of planning prevents substituting one 
food for another which has an entirely different use. 
It prevents the housekeeper, for example, from trying 
to give a pleasant variety by using an extra amount 
of cakes or sweet desserts in the place of fruit and 
vegetables when the latter seem difficult to obtain. 
Sugar is nutritious and has a valuable place in the diet, 
but the nourishment it furnishes is fuel and not the 
body-building and body-regulating materials which are 
found in fruits and vegetables, and it is not safe to 
cut them out, even if the meals can be made attractive 
without them. Fortunately, they are not always so 
hard to obtain as it seems, and the wise housekeeper 
will make every effort to supply them. In general, 
economy within each group is safer then using an inex- 
pensive food from one group in place of an expensive 
one from another group. 

Thinking in terms of these groups will also help when 
laying in supplies. Dried peas and beans and dried 
fish, canned fish, and meat, and some kinds of cheese 
keep for a long time and can be used in place of fresh 
meat in an emergency. Fruits and vegetables put 
up when they are abundant will help to supply this 
important group in winter. 

Farm women can look even farther ahead, and often 
can plan to raise a variety of foods for use when it is 
difficult to buy at reasonable prices; for example, 
enough beans to give the family a generous supply. 
Though navy beans have been most largely used in 
this country, there are many other good and easily 



WHAT THE BODY NEEDS 47 

grown kinds that can be choeen to give variety. In 
the south cowpeas should be not overlooked. If 
sugar is high in price honey can be produced, and home- 
made or purchased sorghum, maple, or cane sirup can 
bemused. 

How to Tell Whether or Not the Diet is Adequate 

It is very hard for a housekeeper to know exactly 
how much of each of the food substances or nutrients 
her family needs or exactly how much of each she is 
giving them. The exact amount which each person 
needs depends upon age, sex, size, and amount of work 
done with the muscles. An elderly person, or one of 
quiet habits, needs less food than a vigorous, young 
one; a large person more than a small one; a man more 
than a woman; grown persons more than children; 
and a farmer working in the hayfield, a mechanic, or a 
football player more than a man who sits at his desk 
all day. 

In order to calculate exactly how much starch, 
sugar, fat, protein, etc. (or, what is equivalent to this, 
how much protein and energy), the family needs one 
would have to know exactly how much muscular 
work each member was performing and also exactly 
how much of the different nutrients each food con- 
tained and exactly how much each person would 
eat. This, of course, would mean a great deal of 
figuring. Fortunately, such exactness is not neces- 
sary in ordinary life. If a little too much or too 
little of one nutrient is provided at a single meal or 
on a single day a healthy body does not suffer, because 
it has ways of storing such a surplus and of using its 
stored material in an emergency. The danger would 
come if the diet taken week in and week out always pro- 



48 ADVICE TO THE HOUSEWIFE 

yided too much or too little of some one nutrient. 
Against this danger the housekeeper can more easily 
protect her family. 

Habit and custom help greatly, because they usually 
are based on what the experience of generations has 
proved is wise and healthful, though, of course, there 
are bad habits and outgrown customs in food as in 
everything else. Good food habits, it must be re- 
membered, include cleanliness and order in every- 
thing that has to do with food and meals and leisurely 
ways of eating. Equally important are a liking for 
all kinds of wholesome foods, even if they have not 
always been used in one's home or neighborhood, 
and eating reasonable amounts, without being either 
greedy or over-dainty. Every effort should be made to 
train children in such good food habits. If older 
people have not learned them, they, too, should try 
to do so, for such things are very important not only 
to health but also to economy. To refuse to eat some 
wholesome dish simply because one is not accustomed 
to it may prevent the use of some very desirable and 
economical food. To feel that there is any virtue in 
providing more food than is needed shows poor taate 
as well as poor economy. 

The health and appearance of the family are a good 
test of the wholesomeness of their diet. If they are 
strong, well developed for their ages, free from ail- 
ments, and full of energy and ambition, one may safely 
say their food agrees with them. But if they are list- 
less and ailing, or not as well developed either physically 
or mentally as they should be, and if a competent 
physician finds that there is no special disease to account 
for these bad symptoms, a mother may well ask herself 
if the food is right, and if not, how she can make it so. 



WHAT THE BODY NEEDS 4P 

In such cases she might, for instancOi apply for in- 
formation on food and diet to her State leader in agri« 
culture and home economics and to the home-econ- 
omics department of her State agricultural college. 

General Suggestions 

It is believed that it is impossible to plan the meals 
for a family wisely without at least as much knowledge 
of how different kinds of food serve the body as this 
bulletin has given and that the safest short cut to good 
planning Ues in considering foods in the five groups 
here described. Ways of making economical use of the 
materials in each group can not be discussed in this 
bulletin, but a few general suggestions for getting the 
most for one's money in the matter of food may be 
made here. 

Use cereals (flour, meal, cereal breakfast foods, etc.) 
freely, taking pains to prepare them with great care 
and to vary the kind used from day to day if necessary 
to keep people from tiring of them. 

Remember that a quart of whole milk a day for each 
child, to be used as a beverage and in cookery, is not 
too much. 

Remember that while skim milk should never be sub- 
stituted for whole 'milk as the principal food in a child's 
diet, it is as valuable as whole milk as a source of 
protein and mineral matters in the general diet. 

Remember that, except in the case of milk for chil- 
dren, the amount needed of foods specially useful for 
body-building purposes — ^that is, meats and meat 
substitutes, fruits, and vegetables — ^is not large, but 
what is needed is needed very much. 

Do not be ashamed to plan closely. Thrift in food 



50 ADVICE TO THE HOUSEWIFE 

means providing enough food, neither too little nor 
too much. 

Notice carefuUy how much of such staples as iSour, 
sugar, milk, cooking fat, etc., is used each week for a 
month, and see if there are any ways of cutting down the 
quantity consumed. 

Buy nonperishable materials in quantities if better 
prices can be secured and there is a good storage place 
in the home. Neighbors can sometimes club together 
to get lower rates. 

Try to make the dishes served of such size that there 
will be enough to satisfy the appetite of the family 
and no imnecessary table and plate waste. 

Do not be above noticing whether anything usable 
is thrown away with the garbage, which always shows 
how thriftily food is used in a household. 

Many inexpensive materials can be mad«^ attractive 
and the diet can be pleasantly varied by a wise use of 
different flavorings. 

*^ Finicky '' tastes in food often prevent the use of 
many valuable materials which might be the means 
of saving money. 

Good food habits are an important part of personal 
hygiene and thrift. Children get such habits by having 
suitable amounts of suitable foods served to them and 
then being expected to eat what is set before them. 

True economy lies not only in buying wisely, but also 
in making the fullest possible use of what is bought.

INTRODUCTION 

Under ordinary conditions, 1 to 1} pounds of fresh 
fruits and vegetables (the equivalent of an apple or an 
orange, two medium-sized potatoes, and an average- 
sized helping of some other vegetable) is probably all 
that even a grown person really needs in the course of 
a day. He may desire more because of their fine 
flavor or refreshing character, but the necessary 
health-promoting substances would probably be ob- 
tained from the amount mentioned. These supply 
less then a tenth of all the fuel and the protein needed, 
but a relatively large part of the iron, calcium, and phos- 
phorus.

Uses of Fresh Fruits and Vegetables in the War 

Emergency Diet 

In an emergency, when fresh frtdts and vegetables 
are relatively abundant they may with advantage be 
used partly to replace cereals and sugar, and to a less 
extent meat. Under such circumstances it is the part 
of wisdom to examine the Ust of fruits and vegetables 
and to see which can be used in such a way as to save 
cereals or sugar, and which used in such a way as to 
save meat. 

Fresh fruits and vegetables can be used in large quan- 
tities with Uttle danger, providing they are carefully 
cleaned and handled. It is even safe to say that there 
is absolutely no danger from the fruits and vegetables 
themselves, the only real diflSculty Ijdng in the fact 
that, being bulky, they quickly satisfy the appetite and 
sometimes lead people to leave out of their diet the 
more substantial foods — meats, cereals, etc. — which 
are needed either for fuel or for body-building pur- 
poses. This fact should always be kept in mind in 
finding uses for these bulky foods. 

Classification of Staple Food Savers 

Under the present unusual circumstances, the various 
fresh fruits and vegetables may be classed as follows: 

Meat Savers. Shelled green peas, shelled green 
beans (Lima, kidney, etc.), shelled green cowpeas 
(common in the South), shelled green soy beans (com- 
mon in the South). 

Cereal Savers. Potatoes, sweet potatoes, partially 
ripe bananas (cooked). 

Su^ar Savers. Sweet potatoes, all fruits. 



FRESH FRUITS AND VEQETABLES 58 

Using Shelled Green Beans and Peas to Save Meat 

Beans and peas contain more protein than other 
fresh vegetables. This, however, is not the same as the 
proteins of meat, milk, or egg, and should not be used 
to the exclusion of the others. When, however, beans 
and peas are freely used, less milk, meat, and eggs are 
needed. For these reasons these vegetables are here 
called, not meat substitutes but meat savers. The 
following foods or combinations of foods supply as 
much protein as one-fourth pound of beef of average 
composition: 

Eight or 9 ounces of shelled green peas or beans. A large 
dish of green peas may be used in place of meat for dinner occa- 
sionally. Many persons like peas cooked with mint or served 
with mint sauce. 

One egg and 4 or 6 ounces of shelled green peas or beans. 
An omelet with peas (1 egg and 1 cup peas per person) or a 
baked pea or bean souffle may be used as a meat substitute. 
(See recipe on p. 60.) 

One cup skim milk and 4 ounces of shelled green peas or beans. 
A Lima bean chowder made with skim milk is a good lunch 
or supper dish. (See recipe on p. 60.) 

Using Potatoes to Save Cereals 

A small potato (3 to 4 ounces) suppUes as much starch 
as a large sUce of bread (1 ounce), but rather less pro- 
tein. Potatoes eaten abundantly make it possible to 
get along with less bread. Potatoes can be substituted 
for about one-fourth of the wheat flour used in making 
ordinary bread and rolls. Recipes are given in Far- 
mers' Bulletin 807.* These call, however, for old 
rather than new potatoes. Mashed potatoes may be 
used in place of biscuit crust in making meat pies. 

> Bread and bread making in the home. 



54 ADVICE TO THE HOUSEWIFE 

Mashed potato, sliced and fried may be used in place 
of bread and butter and makes a good breakfast dish. 
A very large variety of attractive salads may be made 
by combining potatoes with other vegetables — peas, 
beans, beets, cucumbers, radishes, onion, etc. Cottage 
cheese and potato salad go well together. This cheese 
has always been made in small quantities in the home, 
and now the Department of Agriculture is recom- 
mending to dairymen that they make it as a means of 
utilizing their large quantities of skim milk. This 
should make cottage cheese a more common article 
of trade than it has been in the past. 

Sweet potatoes can be used in the same way as white 
potatoes. Bananas baked or fried supply considerable 
starch, though the amount can not be exactly stated, 
because as the fruit ripens the starch changes to sugar. 
Green bananas peeled and boiled can be used like 
mashed potatoes, or may be sliced raw and fried. 

Using Fruits to Save Sugar 

All ripe fruits contain sugar. The amount varies 
from about 3 ounces or i cup per pound in fresh figs 
and plums to about J ounce per pound in watermelon. 

If the water is driven ofif from fruits, as in the drying 
process, the sugar becomes far more prominent than 
it is in fresh fruits. Dried fruits, therefore, taste far 
sweeter than fresh ones and are for this reason often 
classed among the sweets. It should be remembered, 
however, that sugar is present in all fresh fruits, even 
in the most acid ones, and that those persons who wish 
to do so can economize on other kinds of sugar by 
eating large amounts of fresh fruits in unsweetened 
forms. 



FRESH FRUITS AND VEGETABLES 55 

< 
In warm weather melons and other fruits may be used 
in place of " made " desserts, which usually contain both 
butter and sugar. Fruit and ice-cold junket, which can 
be prepared from skim milk, make a refreshing dessert 
and utilize perishable foods chiefly. Or the dessert 
course may be omitted entirely and a fruit salad with 
cottage cheese may be used in its place. 

Making Fresh Fruits and Vegetables Help out on the 

Protein and Fuel of the Diet 

The following list of foods provides a day's ration for 
three men or four women (about 11 ounces of protein 
and over 10,000 calories). It is suitable for those who 
can get large supplies of fresh fruits and vegetables. 
These foods supply over one-fifth of the protein and 
nearly a third of the fuel, whereas in the amounts 
used in the ordinary mixed diet they seldom supply 
more than a tenth of either. j

ever, when large amounts of vegetables are to be intro- 
duced into the diet, as at present, it is desirable to know 
a variety of ways in which to prepare them. For this 
reason the following recipes are given. 

Vegetable Soups 

Good vegetable soups may be made by finely chop- 
ping any vegetable or combination of vegetables and 
cooking in water with a Uttle rice or farina for thicken- 
ing. The chopping is most conveniently done with a 
food grinder. The following recipe calls for a com- 
bination of vegetables, which is only one out of many 
which can be used. Left-over vegetables can be used 
in soups of this kind. 

VEGETABLE SOUP 

2 turnips. 6 tomatoes or 1 pint can of 

2 potatoes. tomatoes. 

1 onion. * 2 sprigs parsley. 

6 stalks celery with tips. 1} teaspoons salt. 

2 carrots. } teaspoon pepper. 
1 quart water. 2 tablespoons rice. 

Wash and pare the vegetables and put them through the 
meat chopper, using the finest blade. Combine all the ingre- 
dients and cook tmtil the vegetables and rice are soft. 

The water in which rice has been cooked may be used in 
preparing this dish instead of rice itself. 



[-Vegetable Soups 

These soups offer a good way in which to utiUze 
vegetables and also skim milk, which is often thrown 
away. 

MILK-VEGETABLE SOUP, METHOD NO. 1 

The soup for which the recipe is given above can be 
made with milk, providing no acid vegetables are used. 
This has the advantage over some other ways of making 



58 ADVICE TO THE HOUSEWIFE 

milk-vegetable soups of preserving all of the juices of 
the vegetables. The cooking should be done in a 
double boiler to prevent scorching and curdling. This 
is a slow process, however, for the temperature in the 
double boiler is below the boiling point, and for this 
reason the vegetables should be chopped very finely. 

MILK-VEGETABLE SOUP, METHOD NO. 2 

Milk-vegetable soups may be thickened with flour. 
The general proportions are as follows: 

Ingredients, — Liquid, 1 cup. This may be milk 
(whole or skim), vegetable pulp, or the water in which 
vegetables have been cooked. 

Fat, i tablespoon or less. This may be butter, 
butter substitute, or drippings. The fat from bacon 
or salt pork gives a particularly good flavor. 

Flour, i tablespoon. 

Method of Preparing. — Melt the butter, add the 
flour, and cook one or two minutes, being careful not 
to brown. Add the liqmd and stir until the mixture 
thickens. Season with salt and pepper. 

The following is a typical recipe: 

STRING-BEAN SOUP 

2 quarts string beans. Salt. 

i cup flour. Pepper. 

i cup or less of fat. Milk, whole or skim, enough to 

1 small slice of onion. make 2 quarts of soup. 

Cook the beans until tender in as little water as possible^ 
drain, and rub through a sieve. Add the bean liquor and milk 
enough to make 2 quarts. Melt the butter, add the flour, and 
cook carefully one or two minutes. Add the liquid and cook 
until the mixture thickens. Season with salt and pepper. 

Part of the beans can be cut into small pieces and served 
in the soup, if desired. The addition of large amounts of such 
pieces and of sliced potatoes converts the soup into a chowder. 



FRESH FRUITS AND VEGETABLES 50 

MILK-VEGETABLE SOUP, METHOD NO. 8 

Soups can be thickened with stale bread, which makes 
it possible to utilize still another food sometimes thrown 
away. Half a small slice of bread or about } ounce 
of bread is enough to thicken 1 cupful of soup. The 
following is a typical recipe: 

LETTUCE SOUP 

1 head lettuce, or the equivalent 1 large slice of stale bread, 

in the outer leaves of lettuce. Butter or other fat, if desired. 

1 small slice onion. Salt and pepper. 

2 quarts skim milk. 

Put the lettuce and onion through the meat chopper with the 
bread to save the juice. Put into a double boiler with the 
skim milk and cook until the lettuce is soft. Add fat (if desired) 
and the salt and pepper. 

Vegetable Chowders 

Vegetable chowders offer another good way of using 
vegetables and also skim milk. They differ little from 
milk-vegetable soups made according to Method No. 1, 
except that less liquid is used and the vegetables are 
usually cut into small pieces instead of being chopped 
finely. For this reason chowders seem more substan- 
tial. As in the case of the vegetable soups, it is a mis- 
take to be confined to any definite recipe, for under 
these circumstances materials are often wasted which 
should be used. The following typical recipe is there- 
fore only suggestive: 

MIXED VEGETABLE CHOWDER 

} pouna salt pork or bacon. 4 medium-sized potatoes. 

1 onion. 3 carrots. 

6 medium-sized tomatoes or 1 2 cups skim milk. 

pint stewed tomatoes. 2 tablespoons flour. 

1 green pepper. 2 teaspoons salt. 



60 ADVICE TO THE HOUSEWIFE 

Put the bacon or pork, onion, and pepper through the meat 
chopper and cook carefully about 5 minutes. Add the water 
and tomatoes and cook until the vegetables are tender. Cut 
the potatoes and carrots into small pieces and cook in water 
until tender, drain, and add with the skim milk to the other 
ingredients. Thicken with flour mixed with a little oold milk. 

LIMA-BEAN CHOWDER 

i pound salt pork. 1 pint or i pound green shelled 

1 onion. Lima beans. 

1 green pepper. 4 small potatoes. 

3 cups skim milk. Salt and pepper. 

Put the pork, onions, and pepper through the grinder. Cook 
carefully for 2 or 3 minutes, being careful not to bum. Add 
either the beans or the potatoes with water enough to cover and 
cook until the vegetables are soft. Cook the other vegetable 
separately and when soft add with the milk to the other mix- 
ture. Reheat and season. 

The protein in the above dish is equal to that in about 
i pound of beef of average composition. 

Any vegetable may be used in place of the beans. 
Corn and salsify are perhaps oftenest so used. 

Vegetable Souffl6 or Baked Omelet 

These dishes are a good way to combine eggs and 
vegetables. If made with the green shelled legumes 
(peas, beans, soy beans, or cowpeas), they may be 
considered meat savers. 

GENERAL RECIPE 

(1) A thick sauce made with } cup fat, } cup flour, and 1 cup 

liquid which may be milk (whole or skim), cream, meat 
stock, or the water in which vegetables have been cooked. 

(2) 1 cup thick vegetable pulp made by draining cooked vege- 

tables and then mashing them or putting them through 
a sieve. 



FRESH FRUITS AND VEGETABLES 61 

(3) 3 eggs, the whites and yolks beaten separately. 

(4) Flavoring. Salt, pepper, onion juice, and any one of the 

following may be used: Very finely chopped parsley, 

chives, or ham, or i teaspoon curry powder. Bacon 

used in making the sauce gives a good flavor. 

Mix the vegetable pulp, seasoning, sauce, and well-beaten 

®SS yolks. Carefully fold in the well-beaten whites of the eggs, 

put into a buttered baking dish, and bake in a slow oven until 

firm. 

The amount of vegetables in this dish may be increased by 
serving vegetables around the souffle. 

The following is a typical recipe in which the protein 
is equivalent to that in 10 or 11 ounces of average 
beef. 

GREEN-PEA SOUFFLfe 

} cup fat. Salt. 

i cup flour. Pepper. 

1 cup skim milk. A few drops onion juice, or a

3 eggs. 

Combine the ingredients as directed above. 

Other Vegetables 

Directions for preparing these vegetables in other 
ways and also for preparing vegetables not mentioned 
above can be found in Department of Agriculture 
bulletins. : 

Conclusions 

When fresh fruits and vegetables are abundant and 
cheap they can be used in large enough amounts to 
effect an important saving of staple foods. If used 
intelHgently, there is no danger that the diet will lack 
fuel or protein. Fresh legumes may be used to a certain

extent in place of meat, potatoes in place of breads and 
fruit in place of sugar. In connection with these 
foods, however, it is safe and highly desirable to use skim 
milk and its products, which, Uke fresh fruits and vege- 
tables, are perishable and can be profitably used near 
the place of production.

CARE OF FOOD IN THE HOME 



Mrs. MARY HINMAN ABEL 



Prepared under the Supervision of the Office of Experi- 
ment Stations 

A. C. TRUE, Director 



INTRODUCTION 

The woman who presides over a household should 
consider as one of her most important functions the 
purchase of food and its storage preliminary to use in 
the kitchen. Should she be living on a farm she will 
buy less in amount than the woman who Uves in the 
town or city, but, on the other hand, the storage of 
food will demand more of her attention. In both 
cases, if inteUigence and care are lacking, financial 
loss will ensue and the family table will be less attrac- 
tive and wholesome than it should be. 

Most families have traditions and well-established 
customs to guide them in the handling and storing 

63 



64 ADVICE TO THE HOUSEWIFE 

of foods, but since the customs of one family may di£Fer 
widely from those of another, it is well to examine 
and compare them in order to select the best. Scien- 
tific investigation has also thrown light on many of 
the processes concerned and the result of such labors 
should be at the service of the householder. The 
health and efficiency of the family is the chief object 
of her care, and it is an end well worth the effort. 

Teasts, Molds, and Bacteria, and the Spoiling of Food 

In the buying, storing, and handUng of food it is most 
important that we reaUze the causes of what is called 
the *' spoiling " of food. This knowledge is com- 
paratively recent. 

The Nature of Teasts, Molds, and Bacteria 

Countless numbers of tiny living things called micro- 
organisms, a word meaning simply '' small living 
things," are everywhere found which will grow in the 
food man has prepared for his own use and cause it 
to spoil. Indeed, the kind of food required by man and 
animals seems to be that which is also best suited to 
these microscopic plants. 

It is this very demand for highly organized food 
which brings them into such close relation to all prob- 
lems that concern the food of man. These micro- 
scopic plants flourish in the kitchen, storeroom, ice 
box, milk room, and cellar. If the conditions are 
favorable they reproduce themselves with incredible 
rapidity, one bacteriimi in the course of a day produc- 
ing a million more minute plants like itself. The bulk 
of these minute forms of life are harmless, under 
certain conditions; some are useful, Uke those which 



CARE OF FOOD IN THE HOME 65 

ripen milk; and many are harmful, since they cause 
waste or may be, what is much more serious, a direct 
cause of disease. 

Molds, yeasts, and bacteria may be found in the 
cleanest room, but they exist in far greater numbers 
in dirty quarters, where, for instance, crumbs of food 
have been allowed to decay and dust to accimiulate. 
Not only do .the micro-organisms appropriate our 
food, with the result that the food sours, rots, or 
putrefies, but they sometimes, in addition, leave 
behind disagreeable consequences hke the musty and 
moldy odor and flavor of some spoiled foods, or the sub- 
stances called ptomaines, which are sometimes poison- 
ous. The housekeeper's success in preserving food 
from deterioration depends very largely on her abiUty 
to reduce the number of these unbidden guests to the 
lowest possible limit. 

The science of bacteriology has given us a new 
meaning for the scrubbing, airing, and sunning that for 
many generations good housekeepers have success- 
fully practiced; it shows us that the storing and han- 
dling of foods are essential bacteriological questions, 
and on that account some knowledge of the nature of 
these microscopic plants is here in order. 

Teasts and their Utilization 

Not until milUons of yeast cells are massed together 
do they become visible to the eye as in the compressed 
yeast cake. Yeast plants are practically everywhere 
and are of many varieties, some being called " wild 
yeasts," in distinction from those we have learned 
to cultivate for the making of bread and brewing 
of beer, and the fermentation of wine and cider. The 
old-fashioned method of making " milk-rising " or 



66 ADVICE TO THE HOUSEWIFE 

" salt-rising " bread depended on wild yeast faUing; 
into the dough and causing the bread to rise, a method 
not always successful, because other organisms, the 
bacteria, also had a chance at the dough and some- 
times got the better of the yeast in the struggle for 
food, and the result of their life in the dough was 
sour or bitter bread. 

Even when we are able to utilize the life processes 
of the yeast plant, its good offices are paid for with a 
certain amount of food material; thus, when introduced 
into the bread dough it breaks up part of the sugar 
present into alcohol and carbonic-acid gas, and the 
gas becomes tangled and stretches out in the glutenous 
mass, making the porous loaf which at the right moment 
is stiffened by the heat of the oven. 

In the same way the wild yeast attacks the sugar 
in the stewed fruit that has stood exposed on a warm 
day, or the jelly left uncovered, or sometimes even when 
apparently covered, only in these cases the gas evolved 
serves no useful purpose and the fermentation ruins 
the taste of the food. 

Yeasts grow best at a temperature of 70 to 90** F.; 
therefore, food that is to be protected from their action 
must be kept well below this point. 

Molds and their Prevention 

The appearance of mold as growing on bread, cheese, 
and other foods is familiar to every housewife; mildew 
on cloth is a less commonly recognized form of mold. 

The spores (i.e., the minute reproductive bodies) of 
the different varieties of mold are everywhere present, 
and they need only warmth and moisture to enable 
them to grow on many kinds of food. These organisms 
are always at work in damp cellars and in dark and 



CARE OP FOOD IN THE HOME 67 

damp corners of rooms; they are borne on the feet of 
insects, they are on the skins of all fruits, and in the 
dust flying in the air. They are not fond of light and 
they require no great abundance of air, flourishing 
best in foods that are piled close together, leaving small 
undisturbed air spaces and moisture. They always 
start on the surface and throw their thread-like fila- 
ments down into the substance below. Take, for 
example, a fine ripe apple and closely examine the skin. 
If it is in good condition and attractive it is almost 
certain that the flesh is protected in the natural way by 
an unbroken skin which resists the entrance of molds 
and other micro-organisms. If, however, the apple 
has begun to spoil, it is almost certain that the skin 
has been broken. 

When fruits touch each other, the point of contact 
is Kkely to be moister than the rest of the fruit, and for 
this and other reasons it is a favorite place for the 
starting of mold or other growth. If the skin is 
perfectly firm and we rub it with a clean cloth to dry 
it and to remove as many as possible of the mold 
germs, then wrap the apple in soft paper and put it 
in a cold place, precautions have been taken which 
should hinder or prevent decay. If, however, the fruit 
is kept in a warm and damp place, and touching other 
fruits, its decay is certain. In deaUng with all varie- 
ties of microscopic life we have learned that ,to prevent 
them from getting a start is the all-important thing. 
The growth, once begun, is diflBcult to arrest. 

The first requisite is absolute cleanliness in the 
storage place. This is not to be attained by the use of 
soap and water alone. Fresh air, sunshine, and white- 
wash are important aids. Shelves should be washed 
clean and then dried; but the undue use of water 



68 ADVICE TO THE HOUSEWIFE 

should be avoided, as moisture is one of the chief 
requisites of growth. A cellar may be kept dry by- 
placing in it dishes of unslaked lime, which takes up 
the moisture with avidity. When the Ume crumbles 
apart, losing entirely its crystaUine character, it h&s 
become '' slaked/' will take up no more water, and must 
be renewed. 

The growth of most molds is retarded by lights 
ventilation, and low temperature. Light and ventila- 
tion are important. The right degree of cold for each 
different product has been studied experimentally, 
and a knowledge of low temperature in relation to the 
growth of bacteria and fungi forms the basis of the cold- 
storage industry. 

Bacteria and How to Control Them 

From the standpoint of household sanitation bacteria 
are by far the most important of the three groups of 
micro-organisms under consideration. They are many 
times smaller than the yeasts, and their power of repro- 
duction is almost unhmited. They require at least 
25 per cent of moisture in which to live and multiply, 
and they prefer darkness to light, and while as a class 
they grow best at a comparatively high temperature, 
80 to 95^ F., most of them are killed by an exposure 
to 150-160^ F. of moist heat. A repeated application 
of boiling temperature is necessary, however, to kill 
the spores which certain kinds produce. 

Bacteria are very widely distributed; the soil teems 
with them; they are in the air, in water, and in all 
food exposed to dust and air, milk being a favorite 
habitat. The flesh of healthy living animals is free 
from them, but when slaughtered and marketed the 
surface is almost certain to acquire bacteria, like all 



CARE OF FOOD IN THE HOME 

things which are exposed to air and dust. They are 
inside the human body, often performing important 
functions, as in intestinal digestion. In short, wher- 
ever organic material is exposed to their inroads there 
they are found. 

It is said that the numbers of bacteria are in direct 
relation to density of population. We can not get 
away from them without going into the highest moun- 
tains or to the polar regions; but we can protect our 
food supply from their undue growth by reversing 
all the conditions that they require for their develop- 
ment. 

It is of primary importance that bacteria be pre- 
vented from getting their start. Hence, only such 
foods should be bought as are in the freshest and best 
possible condition. Since succulent fruits, milk, raw 
meat, and meat products are especially subject to bac- 
terial action, they must be given unusual attention. 
They should be consumed as soon as possible after pur- 
chase or subjected to the following conditions: Uten- 
sils that come in contact with them must be thoroughly 
scalded, or better, boiled. The hands and clothing 
of the worker must be kept clean and every effort made 
to avoid contact with dirt. Of cooked foods, moist 
vegetables, cooked fruits, moist made dishes like 
meat pies and similar dishes are particularly liable to 
" spoil " or " sour," and the importance of clean 
utensils, of keeping the foods protected from dust, 
etc., can not be too often pointed out. 

The temperature at which food is kept should be re- 
duced to that best suited to it, which is usually as near 
the freezing point as possible. Highly putrescible 
food, as meat, is thus kept for months in cold storage, 
and a good ice box will keep such food for days in per- 



70 ADVICE TO THE HOUSEWIFE 

feet condition. Cool, clean storage is as important 
for many cooked foods as for raw. 

Since the water content of food must be above 25 
per cent before bacterial life is possible in it, we may 
preserve food by drying it. This method, often in 
combination with salting and smoking, is applied to fish, 
meat, vegetables, and fruit. 

By exposing food to 150-160*" F. of heat for half 
an hour all varieties of bacteria would be killed except 
a few that are very resistant to heat. In the case 
of spore-forming bacteria, the spores would in cer- 
tain cases resist this degree of heat. The pasteuriza- 
tion of milk offers a familiar example of a food that is 
kept from spoiUng by this method. 

After thorough boiling food may be sealed from the 
outer air by the well-known method of canning. 

Most varieties of bacteria are killed in a few hours 
by direct sunshine, but it must be direct. The recesses 
of a dark room are Uttle affected by what sunshine 
may filter into its depths. Contents of storerooms 
should now and then be sunned, and such rooms 
should be regularly aired. 

We may often make use of substances that inhibit 
bacterial growth. These tiny organisms can not Uve 
in a very heavy sugar solution, a fact made use of in 
preserving fruits. Vinegar, spices, salt, and wood 
smoke have a like effect, and their use is familiar in 
pickled and spiced vegetables and fruits and in salted 
and smoked meats. 

Ptomaine Poisoning 

In some foods bacteria in the early stages of their 
action leave no disagreeable or unhealthful effects, so 
far as yet proved. Meat is in some measure ripened 



CAKE OF FOOD IN THE HOME 71 

by bacterial action, and the " gamey '^ taste given meat 
by *' hanging " comes in part from the same cause, 
though in both cases the changes are chiefly due to the 
action of ferments normally present. 

It is not easy to draw the line between the harmless 
ripening processes and the bacterial changes classed 
as decay, but if the bacteria are allowed to grow 
without hindrance the time comes when the food, 
either animal or vegetable, attacked by bacteria, 
breaks up into a loathsome mass. 

The food may become dangerous, even before it 
shows outward signs of decomposition, for the bacteria 
naay, as they feed upon the proteids, give off substances 
known as ptomaines, hardly to be recognized without 
laboratory apparatus, but some of which are very 
poisonous to man. Certain apparently mysterious 
cases of illness have been traced to such causes, and 
milk, fish, meat, cheese, baked beans, ice cream, and 
other foods have all been found responsible for " food 
poisoning." It is no uncommon thing to hear that a 
large number of the persons attending a banquet were 
taken violently ill within a few hours after, all with 
very similar symptoms. In some cases the illness has 
been of brief duration, in others it has continued for 
days, or even resulted in death. In one instance the 
offending food may have been lobster salad, in another, 
cold-storage chicken, in still another, ice cream. 
These severe cases of wholesale poisoning generally 
occur in the summer and after a very heated term. 
Doubtless many milder cases, called summer com- 
plaint, are due to the same cause. This sort of poison- 
ing is not a true bacterial disease; that is, it is not due, 
as is typhoid fever, to the growth of an organism in 
the body, but the illness results from the introduction 



72 ADVICE TO. THE HOUSEWIFE 

into the system of poisonous substances already formed 
in the food by the bacteria. 

It is not known imder what conditions these peculiar 
poisons are developed in foods; we know only that they 
are the result of bacterial action not so advanced as to 
give warning to the senses. It is a safe rule to eat 
very sparingly of foods which are liable to such changes 
in hot weather, and especially where the methods of 
preparation are not known or where the serving of a 
large number of people at the same time brings an undue 
strain on the culinary forces, in which case material 
is certain to be served which has been prepared a con- 
siderable time in advance and not properly cooled 
and stored. 

Disease " Germs " and Polluted Water 

The so-called " germs " of typhoid fever, diphtheria, 
and tuberculosis are bacteria, and as they may be con- 
veyed by means of water or food this danger is a very 
real and serious one. 

As a proof that contaminated water is the direct or 
indirect source of typhoid-fever infection it may be 
mentioned that the statistics of 10 large European cities 
whose water supply is drawn from pure mountain 
lakes and streams showed in 1905 a death rate very 
much lower than that of a large number of American 
cities whose average death rate from typhoid fever 
was 34 per 100,000 inhabitants.^ 

The germs of typhoid fever, like those of cholera, 
are voided in the feces and urine of the patient. Be- 
cause of carelessness or ignorance in the disposal of 
these excreta they find their way into surface drainage, 
reach brooks and streams, and defile wells. Such 

1 Jour. New England Waterworken' Absoo., 19 (1005), No. 4, p. 575. 



CARE OF FOOD IN THE HOME 73 

infected water used as a beverage may readily cause 
typhoid. By means of milk cans washed in such water, 
or by the hands and clothing of persons who have 
nursed typhoid patients, the germs are planted in 
milk, and in this nutritive medium they develop with 
wonderful rapidity, so that milk becomes, next to water, 
the great carrier of typhoid. It is also known to have 
carried diphtheria and scarlet fever and it has well been 
called the most valuable and the most dangerous 
food. The relation of flies and dust to typhoid and 
other diseases is discussed later. 

For protection from a polluted water and milk 
supply we must look chiefly to sanitary laws and their 
rigid enforcement. In such laws the housekeeper who 
is seeking to guard the health of her family has, or 
should have, the most lively interest. She should 
understand them herself, report any cases of dis- 
obedience that may come to her notice, and be willing to 
work for the passage of better laws if they are needed. 

If the water supply is not known to be well guarded 
from pollution, the existence of a disease like typhoid 
fever in any locality requires that the greatest precau- 
tions must be taken in every house. The drinking 
water must be boiled to destroy any disease-producing 
bacteria possibly contained in it, and this boiled water 
must be used for cleaning the teeth, for washing such 
vegetables and fruits as are consumed raw, and also 
in rinsing dishes and cooking utensils. 

The tubercle bacillus, the cause of tuberculosis, 
should also be guarded against, though it is not likely 
to be carried by city water. Food may become in- 
fected with it from contact with a person suffering 
from the disease, and it is not unreasonable to forbid 
any such to aid in preparing meals. It is also a reason- 



74 ADVICE TO THE HOUSEWIFE 

able measure to prohibit the sale of milk from a farm 
where the disease is known to exist. 

The Necessity of Catttion in the Use of Raw Foods 

The numerous cautions suggested in this bulletin 
may seem unnecessary, but a few facts will show that 
they are not extreme. 

In older civilizations, where the soil has been ex- 
hausted and needs constant manuring, cooked fruit 
and vegetables rather than raw are much more the 
rule than with us. In densely-peopled China, where 
night soil is used to fertilize the land, the eating of 
raw vegetables is said to be very rare. It is easy to see 
why such foods uncooked might be very dangerous. 
Although such methods are not followed to any great 
extent in the United States, raw fruits and vegetables 
may be a menace to health. Methods of washing fruits 
and vegetables are discussed in another section. 

A Russian authority, Professor Metchnikoff,^ be- 
cause of the possible presence of disease micro-organisms 
and minute animal pests, as intestinal worms, strongly 
advises against the eating of any raw food whatever, 
even if it has been washed in boiled water. Although 
this view may be considered extreme for American 
conditions, it shows what care must be taken in the 
purchase and the cleaning of food that is to be consumed 
raw. 

Kitchen methods in many of their details fail to meet 
the requirements of sanitary science. The cook is not 
trained in bacteriology; she does not know what clean- 
liness means from the laboratory point of view. The 
old-fashioned hatred of dirt for its own loathsome 
sake is the best substitute for this knowledge, but 

s The New Hygiene. New York, 1907. 



CARE OF FOOD IN THE HOME 75 

it is not enough. For instance, boiling has long been 
known to kill whatever was the cause of " spoiling " 
of food. However, most housekeepers did not " boil 
out '' the milk pans, etc., but simply scalded them. 
" Scalding " is an indefinite term; if boiling hot water 
is used, and enough of it, scalding would doubtless be 
effective, but too often when the facts in the case are 
not thoroughly understood such a process is carelessly 
carried out and the desired end is not accompliedied. 
When in such cases the milk spoils very quickly it is 
often attributed to the weather or to bad luck. The 
housekeeper who understands the causes of spoiling, 
and who knows that the microscopic plants responsible 
for it may be destroyed by a sufficient degree of heat 
applied for the proper time, is much more likely to be 
successful than one who works by rule of thumb. 
Here, as in so many other household problems, knowl- 
edge is essential. How is the ignorant cook to know 
that what lurks unseen in crack or seam may bring 
to naught all her precautions? The homely old dictum 
that the only way to conquer dirt is by " eternally 
keeping at it " is as true as ever it was, but as we have 
come to realize more and more the insidiousness and 
omnipresence of the enemy to health, and that in the 
form of bacteria Jt consorts with dirt, we realize also 
that every housekeeper and houseworker must be made 
to understand something about the microscopic forms 
of life which are harmful, and how to apply all the 
weapons which modern science has discovered for their 
destruction. 

Flies and Food 

The intelligent housekeeper of this generation has 
at her command a wealth of scientific knowledge that 



76 ADVICE TO THE HOUSEWIFE 

may be applied to the solution of problems in home 
sanitation. Of great value are the means which 
have been devised, thanks to the work of the Bureau 
of Entomology of this Department, the agricultural 
experiment stations, the state boards of health, and 
investigators in many universities and other institu- 
tions, to prevent the spread of disease by insects and 
other forms of animal life. In the nature of things, 
the importance of this matter was not recognized 
until it had been shown with certainty that such ani- 
mal life played an^'important part in the transmission 
of disease. Two varieties of mosquitoes are generally 
conceded to be absolutely necessary to the transmission, 
respectively, of malaria and of yellow fever, since the 
organism that causes these diseases must first undergo 
a complicated series of changes in the body of the 
insect before it is capable of producing a new case. 
Thus, the mosquito bites a yellow-fever patient and 
takes the micro-organism into its body, and there for 
some twelve days it is developed to the stage of matur- 
ity, after which time and not before the mosquito 
can convey the disease by biting. In such cases the 
insect is called an " intermediary host." Both dis- 
eases are now successfully fought by exterminating 
the breeding places of the mosquito and by the screen- 
ing of dwellings. 

Insects play a still larger part as mechanical carriers 
of disease germs, the greatest menace of all in our daily 
life being the common house fly, known to scientists 
as the Musca domestica. It is not a biter, like the 
horsefly and some other flies, or like the mosquito, 
but it has its own way of carrjring infection. It breeds 
in manure and it feeds on it; it feeds on the sputum 
of diseased throats and lungs, on typhoid dejecta, 



CABE OF FOOD IN THE HOME 77 

and refuse of all kinds, and by means of its hairy 
feet and legs it carries about and distributes particles 
of these vile feasts, which frequently contain living 
germs capable of producing a new case of disease. In 
still another way does the fly spread disease — disease 
germs taken into its body in food are known to remain 
alive in the intestines and also for days after they are 
ejected in the " specks," i.e., in the fly excrement. 
By recent experiments with animals this has been 
proved true of both the tuberculosis and the typhoid 
bacillus, the germs in the " speck " having actually 
given the disease from 9 to 15 days after it was voided 
by the fly. Also the eggs of worms that it draws 
into its body with water that it drinks are known to 
remain alive and to hatch after being ejected. 

The case against flies is well proved, and yet they 
are allowed to infect the joint of meat exposed for 
sale by the butcher, the bread and sweetmeats of the 
confectioner's counter, berries and other fruit, the edge 
of the milk pail, the kitchen table and utensils, and the 
food of our table. They were shown to be the prin- 
cipal carrier of the typhoid fever which attacked 
20 per cent of the United States soldiers in the Cuban 
war and furnished 86 per cent of the deaths. As the 
report * states, " Mies undoubtedly served as carriers 
of infection. ... It is probable that the infection 
was [also] disseminated to some extent through the 
air in the form of dust.'' Furthermore, it is pointed 
out that the men undoubtedly spread the disease 
by means of infected material conveyed on their 
persons and clothing. Water was not regarded as an 
important factor in the spread of typhoid fever in the

national encampment of 1898. Since that time 
BO may well-proved cases have been traced to the fly 
that Dr. L. 0. Howard ^ recommends that the name 
" typhoid fly '' should be generally adopted, in order 
to call attention to the danger of allowing this insect 
access to our dwellings. 

In the monthly report of one of our state boards of 
health^ is graphically described a scene familiar to 
many of us: 

In front of a grocery, boxes of blackberries were exposed for 
sale. They were slightly gray; dust and swarms of flies wer% 
present. On the sidewalk, within 6 feet of the berries, some 
poor diseased mortal had spat, and this sputum was circled with 
flies. A moment's observation showed that they flew back and 
forth, not only between the berries and the sputum, but 
also between the berries and the gutter filth and street manure. 
But, most wonderful, people purchased those nasty berries 
and ate them raw. 

It was found later that much diarrhea existed in the 
neighborhood, caused possibly by bacteria transmitted 
by these very flies. 

We are far too tolerant of the presence of this filthy 
and dangerous insect. Its breeding grounds should be 
the first point of attack. The Bureau of Entomology 
of the Department of Agriculture has given a great 
deal of attention to the matter, and the publications 
of the Bureau should be consulted for full data on the 
subject. A summary may be found in an earlier 
bulletin of this series.'^ On the authority of this 
Bureau it is stated that at least 95 per cent of the 
town and city flies are bred in heaps of horse manure 
left in roads, fields, and stables. The remedy proposed

is stricter enforcement of the laws governing the clean- 
ing of streets, and the covering of all manure pits 
in town and country, with occasional spraying with 
crude petroleum. The manure pile and the barnyard 
are the fly-breeding groimd of the farm. 

To urge the housewife to work for public measures 
to insure such sanitary reforms is not asking her to 
go too far afield. In her own house she will endeavor 
by the use of screens and fly paper and similar means to 
protect herself from this dangerous insect. But she 
will wage an unequal battle unless the root of the evil 
is attacked, and this can only be done by removing 
manure and other refuse, that form the breeding places 
of the fly. This question is considered in the govern- 
ment documents referred to. 

Briefly, the manure should be collected in pits where 
it may be kept covered, or where it may be treated with 
kerosene oil or some other material which kills the eggs 
and larvse. It is of still greater importance that 
flies should never have access to human excreta. 

Dust in its Relation to Food 

What is the composition of dust? It has been de- 
scribed as a little of everything. In the paved streets 
of cities and towns earthy particles from the soil are 
always present. While street dust in the country 
is largely made up of powdered earth of the road mixed 
with finely ground manure, in cities its Ughter particles 
are principally dried horse manure with more or less 
dried powdered sputum; facts sufl&ciently disgusting 
to give us a hearty aversion to dust as an accidental 
accompaniment to any article of food. The dust of 
rooms contains earthy particles, minute fragments of 



80 ADVICE TO THE HOUSEWIFE 

clothing fiber, bits of abraded skin, and pieces worn 
away from Walls, floor, and furniture, also mold spores, 
bacteria, and street dust in greater or less quantity, 
according to the location. 

Every precaution should be taken if there is illness 
in a house, particularly tuberculosis or other infectious 
or contagious disease, to prevent the micro-organisms 
which cause the disease from getting into the air and 
dust. Dr. Michael Prudden ^ gives the results of 
attempts to count the bacteria in the dust of New York 
streets. A culture plate of 3} inches in diameter was 
exposed for 5 minutes with the following results: 
Central Park, near street, collected 499 bacteria; 
Union Square, collected 214 bacteria; large dry goods 
store, collected 199 bacteria; street while being swept, 
collected 5,810 bacteria. 

The daily examination of the milk of a certain model 
dairy revealed suddenly a great increase in the bacterial 
count. The physician and the bacteriologist examined 
the premises and watched every process in a vain effort 
to determine the cause until it was noticed that the 
milk pails were put to sun where the dust blew on them. 
This cause removed, the bacterial count returned to 
normal. 

These air and dust bacteria are not necessarily harm- 
ful, but where large numbers are present there are 
likely to be among them those which produce disease. 
A number of cases of illness are on record directly 
traceable to fruit, but it is difficult to determine whether 
in such cases infection has come through dust settling 
on the food or through direct contact of the fruit with 
infected human beings. 

Better market inspection is needed, better protection

CARE OF FOOD IN THE HOME 81 

for food from dust both in transit and when on sale, 
and a more rigid canying out of existing laws, but, 
above all, a demand for clean food on the part of the 
buyer. 

Precautions should also be taken against dust after 
the food is delivered at the house. In modern dairying 
much stress is laid on the fact that sweeping the 
stable before milking fills the air with bacteria which 
are likely to infect the newly drawn milk. The same 
danger arises if food and dishes are left exposed in 
kitchen or pantry during sweeping. Tests have been 
made to determine how gfeat this danger really is 
in ordinary household practice, and it has been found 
not only that molds, yeasts, and bacteria are much 
more abundant in the air during sweeping, but that 
those stirred up by the sweeping do not settle back 
again for several hours afterward. Evidently, then, 
it is not sufficient to cover food and dishes during 
the actual sweeping; they should remain protected 
for some hours. Dusting with a dry cloth or feather 
duster also stirs the micro-organisms into the air; 
for this reason a damp cloth to which they will stick 
is greatly preferable for cleaning in kitchen, pantry, 
and china closet; in fact, everywhere. These consider- 
ations also show the great sanitary advantage of 
modern cleaning dievices, of which a number of sorts 
are now on the market, by which the dirt is sucked 
through tubes into suitable receptacles. Bits of damp 
newspaper or damp sawdust sprinkled on a floor will 
hinder dust from rising when the room is swept, but 
the wooden or linoleum-covered floor ef a well-kept 
kitchen and pantry should furnish very little dust. 
Larger particles should be lightly brushed up and the 
floor washed every few days. 



82 ADVICE TO THE HOUSEWIFE 

Pet Anixnals in the Kitchen 

Another possible source of danger, but one frequently 
overlooked, would seem to be the pet animals of the 
household. The fur of even the most cleanly cats and 
dogs must come in contact with many things which we 
would not care to have touch our food. In many f amiUes 
where the animals are not allowed in the Uving rooms 
for fear of soiUng furniture they are given free range 
in kitchen and pantry, where the chances are they 
will leave more or less loose hair and dirt which may 
find its way to food utensils or to food. 

A word should also be said regarding animal pests. 
Rats and mice are regarded by all housekeepers as 
destructive and disagreeable in every way, and no 
one cares to eat food which they have touched. Traces 
of the presence of mice may sometimes be noted in 
cereals and other foods sold from open boxes and 
similar containers in markets and shops which are care- 
less in such matters. This suggests another reason 
for keeping such foods in glass jars or tin cans or 
similar receptacles in shops and in the pantry and 
storeroom. In addition to the food which they destroy 
and the pecuniary loss involved, rats and mice are a 
menace to health, as they are known to be carriers of 
disease. Many investigations have been reported 
which show their connection with the spread of tri- 
chinosis and with bubonic plague. Data summarized 
by the New York State Department of Health^ 
indicate that the rat may be a large factor in 
transmitting diphtheria and other communicable dis- 
eases.

for de8tro3ring these pests are considered in an earlier 
bulletin of this series.^ 

The Food Supply 

That food which is brought into the home shall be 
clean and of good quality is a matter of the greatest 
importance. Vegetables and fruits should be grown 
iand milk and other dairy products produced under 
the most sanitary conditions only, and all the products 
of the farm and garden which pass through the 
dealer's or manufacturer's hands should reach the 
kitchen in a clean and wholesome condition. 

Since the passage of the National Pure Food and 
Drugs Act, giving to the United States Government au- 
thority to enforce stringent laws against the adultera- 
tion and misbranding of foods which enter into inter- 
state commerce, and the more rigid enforcement of 
similar state laws which regulate these matters in many 
of the States, a great burden has been Ufted from the 
shoulders of the buyer. This legislation has enor- 
mously decreased the deceptions formerly practiced by 
some manufacturers, and since it insures that the name 
and description on bottle and package shall not mis- 
represent the contents, the buyer, if he knows what he 
wants, will have no difficulty in obtaining it, while the 
honest manufacturers and dealers (and they have 
without doubt always outnumbered the others) will 
also be protected. This matter in its various aspects is 
taken up in publications of the Bureau of Chemistry^ 
of this Department. 

The national laws regarding the inspection of meat 
and meat products are a further and very important

protection of the home food supply. Publications 
of the Bureau of Animal Industry ^ of this Department 
deal with the question of meat inspection in relation to 
wholesomeness and quality. But the buyer has still 
to choose among many varieties of food that have all 
met the requirements of the law. There are, for 
instance, many kinds of canned vegetables that should 
be carefully compared as to flavor and water content. 
A 10-cent can of tomatoes that consists of a little 
partly ripened pulp swimming in water may be much 
dearer than a 15-cent can with a lower water content. 
The writer compared two cans of tomatoes on the basis 
of the amount of pulp of a given consistency that they 
yielded on straining. As the 16-cent can yielded twice 
as much as the 10-cent can, and the pulp was also of a 
better flavor, the cheaper can should really have sold 
for 7 or 8 cents in order to vie with the other in real 
food value. 

Clean Shops and Markets a Necessity 

The buyer as well as the merchant is responsible for 
the dirty market and shop, for if they were not toler- 
ated by the purchaser they could not exist. The condi- 
tion of the food when it enters the home is a matter 
of the utmost importance in relation to the subse- 
quent handUng and use, and great care is to be exer- 
cised in choosing clean rather than dirty places in 
which to purchase food. As yet the buyer has but 
little protection through the enforcement of law regard- 
ing unhygienic conditions existing in places where 
food is offered for sale. Let us hope, however, that this 
state of things will soon mend. In some States the 
boards of health are already active in the inspection of 

' U. S. Dept. Agr., Bur. Animal Indus. Giro. 125. 



CARE OF FOOD IN THE HOME 85 

dairies, and the inspection of slaughterhouses has made 
great progress under the United States laws. 

Even to the untrained eye the markets and provision 
stores are often dirty places. In too many of them all 
manner of foods are exposed to dust and flies, and in the 
long Ust may be found many that are " ready to eat," 
such as cooked meats, butter, cheese, bread, cake, figs, 
dates, pickles, and candy. In boxes on the floor, 
leaning at an angle against the counter, or on the pave- 
ment outside, may often be seen green vegetables, 
macaroni, and fresh fruits exposed to street dust which 
is in good part finely ground horse manure and other 
filth. A crate of berries may be seen on a stand out- 
side unprotected from dust or from the visits of count- 
less flies. 

There are, of course, many market men and grocers 
who have clean, well-kept, and sanitary places of busi- 
ness, but the care of the market stall or provision store 
is too often in the hands of people who are not only 
ignorant of the hygienic reasons for avoiding dirt 
but also devoid of any real instinct for cleanliness, 
in so far, at least, as it applies to commercial matters. 
In such shops the meat block is seldom scraped and 
scrubbed, oysters are opened into dirty pails, and 
floors and shelves are infrequently cleaned. The 
grocer's assistant may come in directly from unhar- 
nessing the horse to take your crackers from the 
barrel, and his hands are not washed between drawing 
a fowl and cutting a beefsteak. The butcher or grocer's 
apron in a case recently noted served some of the uses 
of a handkerchief and yet it was in almost constant 
contact with food. Such topics are not pleasant, 
but conditions will not be mended until housekeepers 
take notice of such things, protest against them, and 



86 ADVICE TO THE HOUSEWIFE 

confine their bujring to the shops which are run by 
men who can be trusted to abolish all such uncleanly 
ways. 

If the average person finds these conditions and 
practices offensive, because they are unclean and 
unnecessary, how much more disturbed are those who 
have learned that in addition such practices involve 
bacterial contamination of foods, some of which are 
eaten raw. 

The praise and blame of the buyer has much to do 
with keeping up the standards of the dealer, and it is 
held by some writers that the growing use of the tele- 
phone in ordering the dinner, thus bringing about 
absentee buying, is responsible for many bad condi- 
tions. 

If buyers will think of these things and patronize 
the clean, progressive, and sanitary shops in preference 
to the others it will do much to insure better standards. 
It is the opinion of many, however, that the law is, 
or should be, the final resource. In some cities asso- 
ciations of housekeepers have joined in demanding 
better hygienic conditions in markets and have ob- 
tained what they sought. 

Sanitation of Bakeries 

When we buy a loaf of bread in a shop whose counters 
are clean and whose show case carries a tempting array 
of cakes and rolls, we are not to conclude, as a matter 
of course, that the bakery at the rear or below stairs 
would also meet our approval. Not one customer in a 
thousand sees the conditions under which bread and 
pastry are manufactured, and it is this very removal 
from public view and criticism that constitutes the 
chief difficulty in enforcing existing laws for the proper 



CAKE OF FOOD IN THE HOME 87 

construction of bakeries and for sanitary methods 
of carrying on the business. 

Not long ago one-half the bread consumed in London 
came from cellar bakeries, and while it is true that a 
cellar bakery may be hygienic, the chances are strongly 
against it. 

There are, of course, very many sanitary and clean 
bakeries and workmen who are careful in their work 
and neat in habits, but the reverse condition too often 
prevails. One London bakery is described in a recent 
report as 30 feet long by 7 or 8 in width, with bags of 
flour ranged on one side and the dough tubs placed 
along the other. In the same room were found open 
sanitary arrangements, poor sewerage leaking out foul 
gases, a defective oven letting out fumes of coal gas, 
open cracks in the ceiling through which sifted dust 
from the store above, and the stifling air was unchanged 
by ventilation. 

In one of our Northern States a few years ago health 
inspectors examined 547 bakeries in 25 towns and 3 
cities and reported that from a sanitary standpoint 
270 were distinctly bad, 222 not especially bad, 44 
satisfactory, and 11 worthy of especial commendation.^ 
Similar conditions have been found in other localities.^ 

Most difficult to change are the personal habits of 
the workmen where they are careless and lacking in 
cleanliness. 

In some bakeries floors and even vats were scrubbed 
but once a year; in some there was no provision made 
for washing the hands. 

From such bakeries most persons do not care to buy 
their bread, if they are willing that men should be

88 ADVICE TO THE HOUSEWIFE 

allowed to labor in such surroundings. It should not 
be forgotten that the buyer of food has many oppor- 
tunities to help in raising standards that will affect 
the whole community. It is quite within the rights 
of the buyer to insist on inspecting the place where 
the food is prepared, but it is better to accompany 
the official inspector. Some of the bakeries will be 
found above reproach, and these are the ones which 
the careful housewife should patronize. 

The inspection of bakeries is provided for by legis- 
lative enactments in some cities and States and is an 
important hygienic measure. Great improvements 
have been made in recent years in the construction of 
bakeries and in bread-making machinery and other 
equipment, all of which makes for more sanitary condi- 
tions. It is encouraging to note that progressive bakers 
reaUze the importance of cleanliness and sanitation 
and manifest a marked interest in all that pertains to 
such matters. As an instance of this may be men- 
tioned the work of the bakers' institute in one of the 
Western States.^ 

It has been proposed that a law should require that 
the loaf of bread, as soon as baked, should be put in 
a paper bag and thus handled and transported, but it 
is sometimes difficult to carry out reforms of this kind 
if they conflict with the prejudices of the buyer. A 
baker in one of the large cities whose methods were 
known to the writer started this method but did not 
succeed in popularizing it. People wanted to " see the 
bread," and it entailed an expense which the buyer 
was not willing to meet and which the baker thought 
that his profits would not warrant. Other cities 
or bakeries have without doubt had a different experi-

GAB£ OF FOOD IN THE HOME 89 

ence. At any rate, bread or rolls thus wrapped in 
paper, often of a transparent nature, are served in 
some restaurants and hotels and on some dining cars. 

The Quality of Meats 

In order to become a good judge of meats it is very 
helpful to have a few lessons from an experienced buyer. 
The different cuts will thus be easily learned, but the 
quaUty of the meat depends on so many factors, as 
the age of the animal, the breed, and the method of 
fattening, that it is easy to make mistakes in choosing, 
and the buyer will often be wise in accepting informa- 
tion from the dealer, if he is one who prides himself on 
keeping first-class meats. Having found such a one, 
the customer who wishes to save time and money will 
continue to buy of him. The very large amount 
of meat which some housekeepers provide is not neces- 
sary. In general it is better to use a reasonable amount 
of that which is in prime condition rather than to econo- 
mize on the quaUty. The meat is easily supplemented 
by other dishes, and the whole meal will thus be better 
balanced than would be the case if a larger amount 
of inferior meat were provided. Although not generally 
understood, it is just as important that the cheaper cuts 
of meat, as well as the dearer ones, should come from a 
well-fattened animal. 

The True Price of Meats 

There is an apparent and a true price of meats, a 
fact that is not always considered. It may be more 
economical to pay 15 cents for a cut of clear meat than 
8 cents for one that contains nearly half its weight of 
bone, sinew, and fat. The apparent price of chicken 
may be 20 cents a pound, but its real price will often 



90 ADVICE TO THE HOUSEWIFE 

be 50 cents, when the weight of head, legs, entrails, 
crop, and bones is taken into account. 

Poultry 

There is much discussion regarding the merits of 
drawn and undrawn poultry. Most dealers contend 
that in warm weather a fowl which has had entrails 
and crop removed spoils much mbre quickly, because 
of the extent of cut surface exposed, than does undrawn 
poultry. The writer found in a large city market but 
one dealer who kept drawn poultry, and he said that he 
could not do so except for the fact that steady cus- 
tomers took all of his stock, so that nothing was left 
on his hands. The extra price that he charged per 
pound was only su£5icient to make up for the loss in 
weight. 

The Massachusetts State Board of Health ^ has 
recently studied this question and found that if the en- 
trails were so drawn that none of their contents were 
spilled inside the body, the bird kept better than in the 
undrawn state. The work of the Bureau of Chemistry 
on this subject is referred to later. 

It is greatly to the housekeeper's advantage to buy 
fresh, well-drawn poultry, for not only is the flavor 
injured by the unclean practice of allowing the entrails 
to remain in the body, but it is thought to favor the 
development of ptomaines. It has been shown that 
after death the intestinal juices with their contained 
bacteria are able to pass through the walls of the intes- 
tines into the muscle fiber, and this process goes on 
even though the fowl is kept at a very low tempera- 
ture. In some States cold-storage fowls are required 
by law to be sold as such.

CAHE OF POOD IN THE HOME 91 

Fish 

Regarding fish, one quality is so all-important that 
the buyer is warranted in giving the order: " Any 
kind that is fresh." The dealer knows what he is 
selling. The buyer may not be' able to discover 
from lack of experience in the effect of ice and cold 
storage. It is safe to rely on a good dealer if the buyer 
is a good judge of fish when it comes on the table and 
then holds the dealer strictly to account. Fish that 
has been kept for a week or more on ice has lost its 
distinctive flavor, although it may not be spoiled. 
It has what the cook calls a " woolly " taste. Shellfish 
form a delicious addition to the diet, but if they have 
been grown or fattened in sewage-infected water they 
may carry disease germs. As it is in general impossible 
to learn their origin, the rule of never eating them in 
the raw state is adopted by many. The practice of 
fattening or '' floating " oysters in fresh or in brackish 
water robs them of much of their fine flavor, and 
since the most accessible supply of such water is at 
the outlet of streams, and as such streams are fre- 
quently polluted by sewage, many persons beUeve that 
this practice should be forbidden by law. 

In many European cities fish are sold alive, the cus- 
tomer selecting his fish as it swims in a tank. It would 
seem that this excellent method might be used in our 
own cities, especially those situated on the seaboard, 
at least for customers who are fastidious and who are 
willing to pay an extra price for special articles when 
it is warranted. 

Vegetables 

Only those who have been accustomed to eating green 
vegetables fresh from the garden realize in what poor 
condition are many of the vegetables sold to the city 



92 ADVICE TO THE HOUSEWIFE 

buyer. Some varietieSi as green peas, are so delicate 
in flavor that even a few hours' removal from the vines 
brings about a change. Indeed, the market gardener 
has been obliged to develop the keeping qualities of 
vegetables and fruit at the expense of flavor. 

If lightly packed and transported only a short 
distance, the deterioration in most vegetables is not 
noticeable, but if closely packed for any length of time 
changes due to the action of enzyms or " ferments " 
normally present in the Uving tissue take place, with a 
consequent loss of flavor. 

In green corn, for example, the ferments present 
begin immediately to destroy the contained sugar, 
and thus the corn is robbed of flavor very shortly 
after picking. These changes are often accompanied 
by changes in appearance by which they may be de- 
tected, especially in green corn and in peas and beans. 
Pods inclosing peas should be crisp and plump. String 
beans should not have a faded look or any suspicion 
of toughness or limpness when broken. Green corn 
should show fresh husks or '' shucks " of good color, 
not wilted or partly dry, nor lacking the "bright " 
look of the fresh ear. Cabbages should be crisp and 
bright of color. Cucumbers, turnips, and carrots 
should be firm to the touch. Lettuce, if of the headed 
variety, should have firm, bleached hearts, showing 
no trace of the rusty red look that announces long 
keeping. It will keep its freshness longer if the root 
is left on. 

Some market men and grocers grow part or all of their 
own vegetables, and make a practice of having only 
fresh ones of good quality in stock, though the com- 
bination of market gardener and grocer is, in the nature 
of things, not common. A much larger number of 



CARE OF FOOD IN THE HOME 93 

market men and grocers are very particular to procure 
for sale only fresh vegetables, and here again the dis- 
criminating buyer will patronize the dealer who is to 
be trusted. 

When housekeepers buy vegetables of peddlers, they 
should patronize, if possible, the grower rather than 
the huckster. The grower must sell out and go home, 
and it is to the huckster that he sells his surplus, 
and this surplus is often so manipulated as to sell for 
fresh goods until the next market day. The huckster 
in his off hours may often be seen trimming off the 
wilted outside leaves of celery, cabbage, and lettuce and 
giving a fresh surface to the stem, and sometimes rinsing 
or sprinkUng the lettuce with water not infrequently 
far from clean. The beets which were left over, after 
losing little by little their tops, are sold by measure to 
whoever will buy. 

It may be said in general that when a given vegetable 
is cheapest then it is best, for all conditions are then 
favorable to its development. Potatoes should be 
bought in a fuUy ripened state, not too young, nor is 
it necessary to eat them when they have become too 
old, as it is easy to find substitutes such as boiled 
rice, hominy, and similar foods. 

Veget bles of medium size, neither very large nor 
very small, will be generally found to be the best, and 
most housekeepers consider them the most economical, 
as they may be cooked and served with least waste. 

The Storage of Food 

In earher times a larger proportion of the food was 
stored at home than is now the case. Even in cities 
and towns supplies were commonly purchased in bulk. 
Owing to the improvement in transportation facilities 



94 ADVICE TO THE HOUSEWIFE 

and to other changed conditions storage of food outside 
the home has developed into an enormous industry. 
As was the case with markets and food manufactories 
the storage plant is a matter in which the housewife is 
interested, as it has to do with the character of the food 
which comes into the home. 

Commercial Cold Storage 

Cold storage as applied to whole carcasses of beef 
and mutton has been of great service to the buyer. By 
its aid prices are equalized and we are furnished even 
in summer with meat that has been made tender by 
keeping. 

The service rendered by cold storage of fish and 
poultry is not so thoroughly well established. The 
subject is being carefully investigated by experts. 
Apparently, if the process is carried out in the best 
manner and the goods not kept too long m storage, the 
cold-storage fish and poultry are wholesome. From 
the results of an investigation of the quality, flavor, 
and wholesomeness of cold-storage turkeys, drawn and 
undrawn, the changes brought about by storage, and 
similar matters carried on for the Buffalo, N. Y., 
Department of Health,^ the conclusion was drawn 
that under proper regulation cold storage can be safely 
employed for poultry, but that regulation is essential. 
The question of the effects of cold storage on the char- 
acter of meat and other food products, the compara- 
tive merits of drawn and undrawn poultry, and similar 
matters are being investigated by the Bureau of Chem- 
istry of this Department and are discussed in its 
publications.^

CARE OF FOOD IN THE HOME 95 

With all cold storage foods it is important that there 
shall not be a long interval between removal from stor- 
age and cooking, and this is particularly the case with 
poultry and fish. Foods that have been frozen and 
then thawed seem to furnish particularly good ground 
for bacterial growth, or what we call " spoiling." 

Storage of fruits and vegetables, which is coming 
more and more into use, gives us many out-of-season 
articles. The same is true to a great extent of turkeys 
and other domestic poultry, for food of this kind is 
largely of seasonal production, and cold storage seems 
to be the only method by which the fresh material can 
be kept for a long period for market purposes. In 
the case of many sorts of cold-storage fruits and vege- 
tables it is the common opinion that their quality is 
hardly as good as that of fresh ones. On the other 
hand, if handled under the best conditions much of the 
cold-storage goods, such as apples and other fruits, 
is of excellent quality. Indeed, it is difficult to imagine 
how housekeeping could be carried on, particularly 
in large cities and towns under modern conditions of 
home construction (with limited storeroom, etc.) 
without the cold-storage industry. For this reason 
it is all the more important that the housewife should 
be informed as to the best ways to handle such com- 
modities, and should use her influence to insure the 
best conditions in the cold-storage industry. 

The Storeroom in the Home 

The storeroom for food may be the tiny closet of 
the flat dweller in a city or the cellar of the village or 
farm house. In the last case it often has a commercial 
as well as a household value, since it keeps fruits and 



96 ADVICE TO THE HOUSEWIFE 

vegetables in good condition until marketed, as well as 
until they are needed for the home table; but in any 
case, it should be cool, dry, clean, and regularly aired. 

It may be well to describe a cellar that is badly 
built and carelessly kept, in order to see what should be 
exactly opposite conditions. 

Such a cellar may be dug in wet ground, without 
suflScient drainage of the subsoil; it may even be in 
contact with open sewers or drains, which have been 
proved in certain cases to contain specific organisms 
capable of producing disease. In many cases the cellar 
built against an earth wall is not protected from damp- 
ness by a layer of moisture-proof cement, and the water 
may stand in drops on its surface. Again, it may be 
dug to such an extent below the surface of the ground 
that the windows are wholly inadequate for lighting 
and ventilation. 

It may have an earthen floor, or one of badly matched 
boards impossible to keep clean. It will probably 
have a musty smell, proof positive that mold plants 
are there and ready to attack any fruit and vegetables 
stored on its shelves or in its dirty bins. 

If, in addition to this faulty construction, the cellar 
is badly kept, bits of rotting fruit and vegetables being 
left about, not only will these conditions favor the 
spoiling of food, but they may prove injurious to the 
health of the family living above stairs. 

A cellar that meets modern requirements must be dug 
in ground that is well drained either naturally or by 
artificial means. It must be remembered that a cellar 
is not, first of all, a storeroom; it is an essential part 
of a well-planned house, especially necessary in our 
Northern States, in helping to keep an equable tem- 
perature; and if its walls and floor are what they should 



CAKE OP FOOD IN THE HOME 97 

be it prevents dampness and ground air from rising 
into the house. 

If the house is set close to the ground the cellar win- 
dows must be wide enough to compensate for their lack 
in height, and must be set opposite each other in order 
to insure good draft. A method that is sometimes used 
is to dig out a space in front of a window, making a 
little area which, laid in either brick or stone, may be 
whitewashed and reflect light into the cellar. This 
method also allows of sinking the cellar window deeper 
and obtaining better ventilation. 

This matter and related topics are considered in a 
recent volume ^ on farm home construction and similar 
questions. 

The walls and floor of this cellar should be laid in 
Portland cement to keep out moisture, and the walls 
and ceiUng should be whitewashed twice a year. Even 
if a cellar is kept very clean, the earthy smell of vege- 
tables that arises from it when it is weU stocked is not 
agreeable — ^another reason for good ventilation and 
frequent airing. A separate room may be partitioned 
off from the cellar in one corner for storage purposes. 
This can then be kept darker than one would wish 
to keep the rest of the cellar. Such a room must, of 
course, be aired now and then. In this storage room 
should be placed a movable safe with wire-netting 
sides, and a swinging shelf; and broad shelves should be 
built high enough so that barrels may be shoved under 
them. 

The writer once saw in Holland a cellar that met every 
possible requirement of hygiene. The floor and side 
walls were of closely matched tiles laid in cement, 
making it as tight as a dish and as easily cleaned.

98 ADVICE TO THE HOUSEWIFE 

It was not large, but its wall space was so utilized that 
it furnished ample storage faciUties for a large restau- 
rant. 

Hot-weather Storage 

The storage of food in cold weather is a comparatively 
simple matter, since the low temperature, which is a 
prime requisite for checking the growth of bacteria 
and molds, is furnished by nature and we have only 
to guard against freezing. The keeping of perish- 
able foods in warm weather is best accomplished by 
artificially cooled air. 

Ice Machine 

On a large dairy farm or wherever the household is 
large enough to warrant it an ice machine may be used 
which is driven by an electric motor of suitable horse- 
power, or by a gas or some other suitable engine, which 
operates a brine tank and furnishes very cold dry air 
to the ice chest. Such clean, dry air at a constant 
low temperature furnished from outside is so superior 
a method of cooling food that the ordinary ice chest 
seems a poor thing in comparison, though in the ma- 
jority of homes it is the only resort. 

Ice Chests 

There are many varieties of ice chest or refrigerator, 
all built on one of two general plans. In one kind both 
ice and food are kept in one large compartment. In 
the other the ice is placed in a top compartment, below 
which are cupboards for the food; the principle here 
utilized is that cold air seeks a lower level and that the 
air cooled by the melting ice will sink to the shelves 
below. It probably better utilizes a given amount of 
ice, for the further reason that the ice compartment 



CARE OF FOOD IN THE HOME 99 

may remain tightly closed except when being filled. 
In both cases the air space between the outside wall 
and the zinc lining is filled with some nonconducting 
material, as cork or asbestos. 

It is of great convenience to have the ice chest built 
against the outer wall of kitchen or pantry, so that it 
may be filled from the outside by means of a small door 
cut for that purpose. In such a case it is of course 
advisable to choose a wall on which there is little 
or no sunshine. The ice box may also be drained by a 
pipe leading to the outside and then properly cared for, 
thus saving much labor in the empt3ring of pans. It 
is not considered safe to connect it with the house sewer 
because of the danger of sewer gases " backing " into 
it, even if a good trap is provided. 

Care of Ice Chests 

If on a warm summer day you put your hand into an 
ice box well filled with ice you may think that the tem- 
perature is very low, and yet it is in all probability 
nearer 60® than 40° F. As low a temperature as 40° or 
45° is only to be obtained in a very well-constructed 
box with a large receptacle for ice, and then only for 
a short time after it is filled. A box that maintains 
but 60° is, however, very useful in keeping food from 
day to day. 

The ice box, no matter how well cooled, is and must 
be damp, and dampness is one of the requirements for 
bacterial growth. It must be remembered, also, that 
some varieties of bacteria grow at low temperatures. 
Therefore the interior of an ice chest should be wiped 
every day with a dry cloth and once a week everything 
shoidd be removed, so that sides, shelves, and drain 
may be thoroughly scalded. The water must be 



100 ADVICE TO TBDB HOUSEWIFE 

actuaUy boiling when it is poured in, and the process 
repeated several times. 

In the small ice chests, where all the ice space must 
, be utiUzed, the cube of ice will be a tight fit, and it is 
difficult to lower it to the grating. If the ice is put on a 
piece of stout cloth whose ends are long enough to reach 
above the top, it may be lifted by these ends and 
easily deposited in place. The cloth folded about it 
serves also to protect the ice from the heat of the 
outside air, and holds any bits of dirt that may have 
been frozen into the ice, thus preventing them from 
setthng to the floor of the box or lodging in the drain 
pipe. The cloth should be scalded after each using. 
A folded newspaper laid on the floor of the one-com- 
partment ice box serves the same purpose as to clean- 
liness. It must be remembered that refrigerator ice 
is often dirty, and that it may bring in putrefactive 
or even typhoid bacilli, for most bacteria are resistant 
to low temperature and are not destroyed by freezing. 
On this account no food should be brought into direct 
contact with it, nor should it be put into drinking water, 
unless its purity is above suspicion. 

All cooked food should be cooled as soon as possible 
before being placed in the ice box. Butter may be 
kept from taking up the flavors of other food by 
keeping it in a tightly covered receptacle. Milk 
requires more access of air, but in a clean ice box in 
wUch no strong-smelling food is kept milk should 
remain uninjured in flavor for 12 to 24 hours. If 
vegetables or other foods of pronounced odor are kept 
in glass jars with covers or in covered earthenware 
receptacles there will be fewer odors to be communi- 
cated. Portions of canned food should never be 
put into the ice box in the tin can. Such food does 



CABE OF FOOD IN THE HOME 101 

not of necessity develop a poisonous product, as has 
sometimes been claimed, but experiments show that 
ptomaines are particularly liable to develop in such 
cases. Casting out this somewhat remote possibility, 
the '' tinny " taste acquired by such keeping is enough 
to condemn the practice. 

Foods that are to be eaten raw, such as lettuce and 
celery, should be carefully cleaned before being placed 
in the ice box, and may with advantage be wrapped 
in a clean, damp cloth. If they are to be kept for some 
days they should, however, be put in without remov- 
ing the roots, the further precaution being taken to 
wrap them carefully in clean paper or to put them into 
grocers' bags. 

Water for Cooling Food 

There are many ways of lowering temperature by 
utilizing the fact that water when evaporating draws 
off heat from surrounding objects. If a pitcher of 
water be wrapped with a cloth which is kept saturated 
and exposed to a draft of air the temperature of the 
water in the pitcher will be lowered by several de- 
grees. 

A receptacle in which food is placed may be cooled 
in the same way. Take a wooden box with a sound 
bottom made of one piece and invert it. Tack a layer 
of cotton batting over it and cover with some coarse 
cloth. It is now to be kept wet by some contrivance 
that will furnish an automatic drip. The writer used 
for this purpose an old aluminum pan which had in it 
a half dozen very tiny holes, and when filled with water 
it supplied just enough water to keep the cloth satu- 
rated. Under this box lettuce in cold water, a cold 
pudding, a pat of butter, and other food were placed 



102 ADVICE TO THE HOUSEWIFB 

and kept in good condition. A pan of milk lowered 
into another of cold water is kept from souring many 
hours longer than if it was unprotected from the sur- 
rounding air. Spring water of low temperature is 
used by many farmer's wives to keep milk and butter 
cool, and a '' spring house " is a common thing on many 
farms, though less depended upon than was the case 
before ice houses, refrigerators and ice chests became so 
common. 

It is also an old-fashioned practice to lower foods in 
covered pails into the well and suspend them not far 
above the surface of the water. 

Winter Storage of Food 

In the Southern States storage problems are not the 
same as in regions where the winter is severe, and many 
roots and other vegetables may be left in the ground 
with Uttle or no protection, while crops may even be 
grown throughout the year, thus doing away largely 
with the need of winter storage. In the greater part 
of the United States, however, the problem of keeping 
at least a part of the food supply through the cold 
season is an important one, and the more important 
the longer the winter season. 

The farmer will without question keep in cellar or 
storeroom or outside cave or pit the surplus of what is 
raised on the farm. Whether it is wise for others to 
buy food in large quantities and store it for winter 
use depends on whether it can be bought at a sufficiently 
low price to pay for the care and risk that the keeping 
entails, as well as on market facilities, the amount of 
storage space available, and similar factors. But 
the storing of smaller quantities of food is both con- 



CABE OF FOOD IN THE HOME 103 

venient and economical and is an absolute necessity 
for families who live at a distance from market. 

A Window Storage Box 

The dweller in a small apartment who has no cool 
cellar in which to store perishable articles may find 
an outside window box useful in winter. 

A carpenter may be hired to construct a box that will 
exactly fit outside a kitchen window, if possible on the 
north side. Such a device has been described in a num- 
ber of books and bulletins.^ It should come halfway 
up the lower sash and contain two deep shelves, and 
when the sash is raised the contents of these shelves 
are easily accessible. In freezing weather the sash 
may be left up, and thus the box becomes a part of the 
warmed room. A sash curtain will conceal it from the 
room. Such a window box is often fully as great a 
convenience in the farm or village home as in the city 
flat. 

A more inexpensive way is to hang a neat wooden 
box, well cleaned, on strong nails or spikes outside the 
window. A heavier box may be supported on brackets. 
The box should have a tight-fitting hinged Ud and be 
lined with asbestos paper to equalize extremes of tem- 
perature, while a lining of oilcloth will admit of easy 
cleaning. A shoe box would be good for this purpose. 
It might be painted the color of the house. 

The Keeping of Vegetables, Fruits, and Meats 

The following hints regarding the keeping of differ- 
ent kinds of food may be found useful:

and Garden; No. 3, p. 62 — Housekeeping; also Reading Lesson Sup. 1. 



104 ADVICE TO THE HOUSEWIFE 

Potatoes are kept without difficulty in a cool, dry, 
and dark place. Sprouts should not be allowed to grow 
in the spring. 

Such roots as carrots, parsnips, and turnips remain 
plump and fresh if placed in earth or sand-fiUed boxes 
on the cellar floor. 

Sweet potatoes may be kept until January if cleaned, 
dried, and packed in chaff so that they will not touch 
each other. 

Pumpkins and squash must be thoroughly ripe and 
mature to keep well. They should be dried from time 
to time with a cloth and kept, not on the cellar floor, 
but on a shelf, and well separated from each other. 

Cabbages are to be placed in barrels, with the roots 
uppermost. 

Celery should be neither trimmed nor washed, but 
packed, heads up, in long, deep boxes, which should 
then be filled with dry earth. 

Tomatoes may be kept until January, if gathered 
just before frost, wiped dry, and placed on straw- 
covered racks in the cellar. They should be firm and 
well grown specimens, not yet beginning to turn. As 
they ripen they may be taken out for table use, and any 
soft or decaying ones must be removed. 

Apples, if for use during the autumn, may be stored 
in barrels without further precaution than to look 
them over now and then to remove decaying ones; 
but if they are to be kept till late winter or spring 
they must be of a variety known to keep well and they 
must be hand-picked and without blemish or bruise. 
They should be wiped dry and placed with Uttle crowd- 
ing on shelves in the ceUar. As a further precaution 
they may be wrapped separately in soft paper. 

Pears may be kept for a limited time in the same 



CABE OF FOOD IN THE HOME 105 

way, or packed in sawdust or chaff, which absorbs 
the moisture which might otherwise favor molding. 

Oranges and lemons are kept in the same way. 
Wrapping in soft paper is here essential, as the un- 
covered skins if bruised offer good feeding ground for 
mold. Oranges may be kept for a long time in good 
condition if stored where it is very cold but where 
freezing is not possible. Lemons and limes are often 
kept in brine, an old-fashioned household method. 

Cranberries, after careful looking over to remove soft 
ones, are placed in a crock or firkin and covered with 
water. A plate or round board placed on top and 
weighted serves to keep the berries under water. 
The water should be changed once a month. 

In winter large pieces of fresh meat may be purchased 
and hung in the cellar; Thin pieces, as mutton chops, 
are sometimes dipped in mutton suet, which keeps the 
surface from drying and is easily scraped off before 
cooking. 

Turkeys, chickens, and other birds should be care- 
fully drawn as soon as killed and without washing himg 
in the coolest available place. 

Smoked ham, tongue, beef, and fish are best put in 
linen bags and hung in the cellar. 

Salt pork and corned beef should be kept in brine 
in suitable jars, kegs, or casks, and should be weighted 
so as to remain well covered. A plate or board weighted 
with a clean stone is an old-fashioned and satisfactory 
device. 

Eggs may be packed for winter use in limewater or 
in water-glass solution, methods which are described 
in an earlier btilletin ^ of this series. Many house- 
keepers have good success in packing them in bran, 

1 U. S. Dept. Agr., Farmers' Bui. 128. 



106 Tadvice to the housewife 

in oats, or in dry salt, but according to experiments 
summarized in the aforementioned bulletin, the pref- 
erence is to be given to the 10 per cent solution of water 
glass. Exclusion of the air with its accompanying 
micro-organisms and the prevention of drying out are 
what is sought in all cases. Packed eggs are not 
equal to fresh eggs in flavor, but when they are well 
packed are of fairly good quality and perfectly whole- 
some. 

Storage of Groceries, Meats, Cooked Food, and 

Canned Goods 

Flour comes packed both in barrels and in bags, and 
the form in which it shall be purchased and kept is of 
importance to the housewife. Bags have certain 
advantages over the barrel for both producer and 
consumer; they pack into freight cars with no waste 
of space, and the cloth for 8 bags costs less than one 
barrel; for the consumer, also, it is often convenient 
to buy in small quantities. But, on the other hand, 
the bag is too often very flimsy in texture, so that it 
allows flour to sift out, and is also easily soiled by 
contact with a damp or dirty floor. The purchaser 
may well require that the bags be made of good ma- 
terial, so that the contents may be protected from dust 
and dirt. 

On this question Prof. Harry Snyder, of the Uni- 
versity of Minnesota, says: 

There is no question whatever but what flour improves by 
storage up to 6 months, and it will then hold its own for some 
time, depending upon the character of the wheat and the thor- 
oughness with which impurities are removed. 

As a general proposition it seems certain that it is economical 
for the consumer to buy flour in bulk rather than in small 



CABE OF FOOD IN THE HOME 107 

sacks at a time. In the fall of the year a small sack of flour 
for trial purposes can be purchased of the grocer and at the same 
time he can set aside a barrel of the same flour of the same 
shipment for future delivery, provided the first sample proves 
satisfactory. As a general rule the price of flour advances from 
fall to spring sufficiently, to more than cover the interest item 
involved and at the same time the consumer is assured of a good 
quahty of flour. 

Aside from accidental contamination the chief de- 
structive agencies in stored flour and similar materials 
are fungi and bacteria. The fungi or molds break 
down chiefly the starches of the flour, forming organic 
acids which make the flour sour. The bacterial growths 
which are present are chiefly forms which liquefy or 
break down the gluten, the acid presumably aiding 
in this. This matter has been studied by H. G. Bell,^ 
among others, in connection with the problem of com- 
mercial storage, and he recommends storage in well- 
lighted, warm, and dry rooms as a preventive of the 
development of fungi and bacteria, a method as 
applicable to farm and town homes as to commercial 
conditions. 

The various prepared or " self-raising '' flours are 
more expensive than the mixture that the housewife 
can easily make by adding the requisite amount of 
baking powder to flour and sifting it several times. It 
is a convenience and a saving of time to keep this mix- 
ture on hand, as one sifting provides enough for a 
month's use in cakes and mufl&ns. 

The fact that many breakfast cereals that were once 
sold only in bulk can be bought in packages is a great 
advantage from a sanitary point of view. The contents 
of these packages, if bought fresh and if well cared for, 
will remain in good condition for months. If made in 

lOper. MiUer, 13 (1908), p. 591; Amer. MiUer, 37 (1909), p. 280. 



108 ADVICE TO THE HOUSEWIFE 

clean factories, such goods have had little chance for 
contamination from dust and dirt. 

If breakfast cereals are brought in bulk they should 
be kept in tight receptacles in a cool, dry place. Crack- 
ers may be kept like breakfast cereals, either in the 
packages, in which many sorts are marketed, or in tin 
boxes or in jars. 

Corn meal spoils more readily than flour, and for most 
famiUes it is best to buy in small quantities. 

Rice, tapioca, macaroni, and similar dry materials 
may be kept without any trouble in covered cans or 
small crocks in a dry, clean place. The same method 
is advisable for raisins, Zante currants, evaporated 
and dried fruits, and similar supplies. 

Sugar and salt are best kept, the former in tin, the 
latter in wooden or crockery receptacles. 

Glass preserve jars are perhaps the best and most 
convenient of all containers for small quantities of 
almost any food material. 

Bread and Other Cooked Foods 

While cooUng, newly baked bread should be lightly 
covered with a clean cloth or paper to prevent mold 
germs and dust from falling upon it, but should not 
be tightly wrapped in a thick cloth as is the practice 
in some households, for unless it is aired when taken 
from the oven, it is Ukely to become " soggy " and 
damp and thus offers an excellent medium for cultiva^ 
tion of molds. When perfectly cold the bread should 
be placed in a close receptacle that has been thor- 
oughly scalded and aired. If bread is to be kept for 
more than 2 or 3 days in damp, hot weather, the jar 
or box should be taken out and sunned for a short 
time now and then, and again scalded and dried. 



CAKE OF FOOD IN THE HOME 109 

On no account should portions of a former baking be 
stored with a new batch. 

Cake and cookies should be cooled after baking and 
kept in tin boxes or in earthenware jars, which, Uke 
bread boxes, should be often scalded and aired. Even 
if these foods are to be eaten at the next meal it is well 
to keep them in some such receptacle, as it insures 
protection from dust. A cake, pudding, or pie put 
out of a window uncovered to cool or in any other place 
where it is exposed to dust, and in summer also to 
flies, is something that no careful housewife would 
place on her table if she stopped to think how easily 
the food may be contaminated. 

Canned Fruits and Other Canned Goods 

Commercial canned goods may be advantageously 
bought by the dozen in the autumn, and they do not 
seem to suffer from even a poor storage place, provided 
it is not so damp that the cans rust through. If dirty 
or dusty, the cans should always be carefully wiped 
before they are opened to prevent accidental soiling 
of the contents. 

Vegetables and fruits canned at home and home- 
made jelUes, jams, and similar foods should be kept 
in dry, airy storage places, out of direct.light. The cans 
and jars used should be of good quality, and all the 
usual precautions of good rubber rings (if they are 
used), and so on, should be taken. These matters are 
discussed in earlier bulletins ^ of this series. 

Canning may also be made use of daily for tem- 
porary preservation of food, and it is especially valu- 
able where ice-chest facilities are not good. When 
making soup stock a large quantity is made as easily 

> n. S. Dept. Agr., Farmers* Buls. 203 and 350. 



110 ADVICE^ TO THE HOUSEWIFE 

as a small, and the surplus may be poured, while hot, 
into fruit jars and sealed. Boiled milk may be thus 
canned and cooked vegetables which may be at the 
time plentiful or cheap. Mince meat may also be 
canned, but it will keep a long time in an ordinary 
receptacle if melted suet be poured over the top. 

Such canning, especially of soup stock or milk, is 
only recommended for a few days' keeping, and every 
precaution should be taken that is familiar in the ordi* 
nary canning of fruit or vegetables. 

Labeling Foods in Packages and Cans 

Many otherwise good housekeepers are very indif- 
ferent about labeling. They trust to their memory 
as to what is in each jar or package, and sometimes 
with disastrous results. All stores should be plainly 
labeled. 

Care and Utilization of Fats 

Fats that are derived from the cooking of bacon, ham, 
chicken, beef, and other meats, should be kept, each 
in its own receptacle, to be used for different purposes. 

Home rendering of both suet and leaf lard has its 
advantages, because the product is generally superior 
to what can be bought for the same price. 

Both suet and leaf lard require cooking in order to 
loosen the fat from the tougher membrane that holds 
it. For this purpose the material is cut in small pieces 
and covered with water and allowed to cook slowly 
for some time until no more water remains and the 
scrap has turned to a light brown. 

A better method for suet is that used by German 
housewives, who economize on butter by the use of 
beef fat more than do American housekeepers. The 



CARE OF FOOD IN THE HOME 111 

suet is cut in small pieces and covered with water, 
in which it is allowed to soak for a day, the water 
being changed once in the time. It is then drained 
and put into an iron kettle with one-half teacup of 
skim milk to every pound of the suet. It should 
be cooked very slowly until the sound of boiling entirely 
ceases. When it has partly cooled, it should be care- 
fully poured off. This fat has no unpleasant taste or 
odor, and in many recipes may be substituted for part 
of the butter. Some cooks add a pound of leaf lard 
to 4 or 5 of the suet; this makes a softer fat, as lard 
has a lower melting point than beef fat. 

An old-fashioned method of clarifying fat from the 
soup kettle, or from cooked meats, so that it may be 
used in the kitchen, is to add the cold fat to a Uberal 
quantity of cold water, then heat slowly and let cook 
for an hour or more. When cold, the cake of fat is 
removed and the lower portion, which will contain the 
small particles of meat, etc., should be scraped away and 
the white, clean fat saved. If the flavor or color or 
both are not satisfactory the process may be repeated 
several times. Another method which is often recom- 
mended is to cook a number of sUces of raw potato 
in the boiling fat. 

When an ice chest is used fat in small quantities may 
be easily kept sweet for cooking purposes. If lard 
is rendered at home in quantity sufficient for a long 
time, it should be kept covered in tins or earthen jars, 
in a cool, dry place, as in a cellar or storeroom. 

In some families where fat from cooked meats is 
not used in the kitchen it is made into soap for laundry 
or even toilet use. Directions for making soap at 
home may be found in most good books on house- 
keeping. Some questions concerned with soap making 



112 ADVICE TO THE HOUSEWIFE 

at home are considered in a discussion of laundry 
and other cleaning problems by Miss Rose/ of the 
Home Economics Department of the Agricultural 
College at Cornell University. 

Cooking butter may be bought at a lower price than 
table butter, but it should be rendered before using. 
It may be foimd to have some degree of - rancidity, 
and to correct this condition there must be mixed 
with it i to 1 teaspoonf ul of baking soda to the pound. 
It should be melted and cooked down slowly imtil the 
froth rises and the sound of cooking ceases, then 
skimmed and poured oflf carefully from the dregs. 
Unless to be used immediately, } tablespoonful of 
salt per pound should be added. One-third less of 
this clarified butter is equivalent to the quantity of 
ordinary butter called for in any recipe. In India 
and some other tropical countries this rendered butter, 
called " ghee " or some other special name, is a product 
much used by the native population, and through their 
example by others, who have found by long experience 
that butter will keep in good condition in this form 
while it would generally spoil if stored as made. 



of Food and Utensils in the Kitchen 

The handling of food before it reaches the home is a 
matter of the greatest importance to the housekeeper, 
as it has a very important relation to the condition of 
the food and to its keeping qualities, wholesomeness, 
and other characteristics after it is purchased. 

In preceding sections it has been shown what are the 
dangers from market dirt and dust, from flies, and other 
animal life, from the soiled hands and garments and 

1 The Laundry: Cornell Reading CourBes for Fanners' Wives, n. s. 1, Sani- 
tation. 



CARE OF FOOD IN THE HOME 113 

utensils of butcher and grocer, milkman, and delivery 
boy. It is not too much to say that when the food 
reaches our door much of it is an object of suspicion, 
and this will be the ca^e until market inspection is far 
better than at present. But we have now to consider 
what treatment shall be given to perishable food when 
it comes into the kitchen. 

Meats 

The dealer must be especially enjoined to tie up the 
meat in a secure package, else the brown paper in which 
it is loosely wrapped will not protect it thoroughly 
in transit. This paper should not go with the meat 
into the ice box. 

When meat is received the skin side should be rubbed 
with a cloth wet in hot water and then carefully 
scraped with a knife. The thin outer skin of lamb 
should be" entirely removed in order to avoid the dis- 
agreeable taste due to any contact with the hair of the 
animal. The cut surface should also be carefully 
scraped, and, to prevent drying, be covered with paraffin 
paper or rubbed with salad oil, or, in case the meat is 
to be kept for some time, entirely covered with melted 
suet. The meat should then be put on a plate in the 
(ce box. 

Poultry 

The skin of poultry is frequently very dirty when 
brought from market and fowls should be not only 
washed, but scrubbed with a soft brush and warm 
water in which a teaspoonful of baking soda has been 
dissolved. Such treatment will prevent the dis- 
agreeable " henny " taste often noticeable in cooked 
poultry. 



114 ADVICE TO THE HOUSEWIFE 

Poultry should be drawn immediately, and unless 
it is known to have been killed very recently it should 
be thoroughly washed on the inside and used soon. 
Poultry that is drawn directly after killing, on the 
contrary, keeps better if it is not washed until used. 
It should be hung in a cold place or put in the ice 
box with a piece of charcoal inside the body. 

Cold-storage chickens should under no circumstances 
remain in a warm room before cooking. Such poultry 
must be kept at a low temperature and cooked as soon 
as possible. All cold-storage food when brought into 
a warm temperature spoils quickly, and without 
doubt many cases of illness traced to the use of such 
food are really due to careless handling and delay in 
cooking. 

Washing Vegetables 

If deteriorated vegetables are brought into the 
kitchen no method of handling will restore them 
to first-class condition. Even good ones will not be 
at their best unless they are properly cared for after 
being received. After all that has been said in this 
bulletin regarding the possibilities of dangerous micro- 
organisms having lodged upon vegetables, it may seem 
superfluous to insist again that any which are to be 
eaten raw should be thoroughly washed. It is of course 
useless to wash them with water which is itself danger- 
ous, and in any case where the water supply is not 
considered safe for drinking, boiled water should be 
used for washing vegetables and fruit after the first 
rough dirt has been removed by hydrant water. 

As to the method of washing vegetables, a few cau- 
tions are in order. Some people never choose aspara- 
gus at table unless it has been prepared by some one 



CABE OF FOOD IN THE HOME 115 

who is very careful, as they do not wish to bite down on 
sand, for the cleaning of this vegetable requires con- 
science as well as care. The bunch should be placed, 
heads down, in water for some hours and should be 
shaken back and forth to dislodge the particles of 
earth. Spinach is another vegetable which requires 
the best cleansing to free it from grit. After the roots 
have been cut off it should be washed in a number of 
waters and Ufted out of the pan each time in loose 
handfuls before the water has been drained off. 

Celery and lettuce and other salad plants, because 
eaten raw, must be washed with the greatest care. 
They should be searched leaf by leaf for insect life, 
washed in several waters, and then wiped dry with a 
clean cloth and put in a cold place to become crisp. 

Washing Fruits 

A German investigator, B. Ehrlich,* having esti- 
mated by careful experiments the number of bacteria 
to be found on market fruit, tried different methods 
of washing it without injuring the flavor. He washed 
grapes, apples, and pears that had been exposed to 
street dust, each time examining the wash water for 
the number of bacteria present. While the first wash 
water 3delded large numbers, the second contained 
only a few, and the third a negUgible number. A 
basin of water was used for the purpose, the fruit 
being moved about in it. When running water was 
used, five minutes' time was allowed. Fruits with a 
firm, smooth skin should be rubbed before washing 
with a clean cloth to start the dirt. 

The cleaning of delicate berries is a difi^cult matter. 
Such fruit should be purchased with care to avoid all 

L 1 Arch. Hyg., 41 (1901), p. 152. 



116 ADVICE TO THE HOUSEWIFE 

that are too soft or which show sand or other visible 
dirt. Strawberries, because they grow so near the 
ground, should not be purchased after a rain, which 
wiU spatter them with muddy drops. Only the fresh- 
est and cleanest berries should be served raw; more 
doubtful specimens should be cooked. By immersing 
them in water a few at a time and handling carefully, 
such fruits may be washed without much loss of flavor. 
These matters are also discussed in an earlier bulletin ^ 
of this series. 

Dried figs and dates are very commonly eaten with- 
out cooking, or even washing, and yet they have been 
exposed for an unknown length of time to the contagion 
brought by dust, flies, and dirty hands. In how many 
houses are oranges washed before they are brought to 
the table, or the lemon before it is sliced for the tea 
or lemonade, or before the skin is grated for flavoring? 
Yet the skin is often very dirty. 

Shelled nuts purchased in market should always be 
washed and scalded before they are used, as they are 
commonly exposed to dust, and perhaps to flies. 
They can afterwards be dried on a clean cloth before 
using. 

Many careful housewives wash nuts in the shell 
before cracking, as this prevents accidental soiUng 
of the kernels. 

Washing Eggs 

The ordinary way to break an egg is to hit it against 
another egg or over the edge of the mixing bowl and 
let the contents stream over the side of the shell with- 
out considering whether the latter is clean or not. 
Even if there is no visible dirt, the shell may not be as 

^ U. S. Dept. Agr., Farmen* Bui. 293. 



! CARE OF FOOD IN THE HOME 117 

clean as it seems, for it may have come from a dirty 
nest or have been untidily handled. Eggs should there- 
fore always be washed before breaking. 



Dishwasliing 

The bacteriologist finds no kitchen clean enough and 
the ordinary methods of washing dishes he is hkely to 
call a " smear." 

Dishes have been tested to determine the number of 
organisms that remain on them after '^ ordinary " 
washing as compared with a method that requires 
an application of hot water with the help of soap, or 
better still, carbonate of soda, a thorough rinsing in 
hot water, and wiping with a sterilized cloth (that is, 
one which has been in boiling water since it was used 
before). By this latter method the dishes were prac- 
tically sterile while many organisms were left on the 
dishes that were washed by the " ordinary " method. 

One might ask what harm they will do if present. 
Oftentimes none, but if the bacteria are those which 
convey disease, dirty dishes may be the means of giving 
it to well persons. But most of all, persons who are at 
all thoughtful of such things do not want any dirt 
which may be prevented by good methods, simply 
because dirt in itself is sufficiently unpleasant. 

In washing milk utensUs it is first necessary to remove 
with warm water all traces of the milk before scalding 
water is used. Because of the cream adhering to the 
sides soap is used also, but the greatest care must 
be taken to remove by repeated rinsing every trace of 
soap. A telltale flavor of soap in the morning cream 
has more than once revealed careless habits in the 
kitchen, and made it evident that all the soap was not 



118 ADVICE TO THE HOUSEWIFE 

removed in rinsing. The utensils must then be dipped 
into absolutely boiling water for a moment. 

It is an important matter to wash the milk bottle 
in which milk is now commonly delivered to customers. 
By this we refer to the washing of the full bottle be- 
fore it is opened. It is safe to say that this is seldom 
done. But notice the bottle as it is brought into the 
kitchen, the milkman grasping it with his hand over 
the top. These hands perhaps more often than not 
have harnessed his horse, have been grasping the 
reins all the morning, have opened and shut doors, run 
along stair railings, have perhaps wiped mouth or nose, 
and yet the thoughtless housekeeper or cook, regarding 
the white cap as full security from the outer world, 
pours out the milk over a very dirty bottle brim. 
Milk bottles should be put under the hot water spigot 
for a moment and wiped dry with a clean cloth before 
opening. Most housewives agree that milk bottles 
should be carefully rinsed before they are returned, 
perhaps more from a feeUng for cleanliness than for 
absolute necessity, as the milk bottles in all well- 
managed dairies are thoroughly scrubbed and washed 
before refilling. If such violations of this practice as 
recently came under observation are noted, when the 
driver of a dairy wagon washed out some milk bottles 
in a public drinking fountain provided for horses, 
refilled them, and disposed of them to other customers, 
complaint should be made to the dairy, and if this is 
not sufficient, to the board of health. 

Care of the Water Cooler 

Water is an indispensable food adjunct and so may 
be properly spoken of here. The water and the ice 
supply should both be above suspicion. The question 



CARE OF FOOD IN THE HOME 110 

of wells, water, and ice supply has been discussed in 
earlier bulletins of this series.^ The greatest care 
should be taken to keep clean and in good condition 
all vessels in which water is used for household pur- 
poses. Water coolers, if used, should be of some mate- 
rial like porcelain or enameled ware which is easily 
kept clean. They should be scalded out at frequent 
intervals. The ice, if it comes in contact with the 
water, should be of known quality. If such ice can 
not be secured, a water cooler shoidd be used in which 
the ice is in a separate receptacle and does not come 
in contact with the water. Many famiUes cool drink- 
ing water by putting it in the ice box in glass fruit 
jars or bottles. Perfect clearness is an indication of 
purity in ice. Cloudy ice full of bubbles or snow ice 
should not be used in direct contact with food, and ice 
which contains dirt of various kinds frozen in it should 
be regarded with suspicion. 

If it is believed that the water is not pure, it may 
be boiled or filtered, or both. If filters are used, every 
precaution should be taken to keep them clean and in 
good condition and to rely only on such as really 
purify the water. Earthenware filters may be sterilized 
by placing in a pan or kettle of water and boiling them 
out after they have been thoroughly scrubbed with a 
brush. A small piece of wood should be placed under 
the jar to prevent direct contact with the bottom of the 
pan. 

The water cooler in public places should always be 
in charge of a responsible person who will keep it 
clean and in good condition. Some sort of a sanitary 
drinking fountain is desirable. The public drinking 
Gup of the sort usually seen should not be permitted.

120 ADVICE TO THE HOUSEWIFE 

It is uncleanly and furnishes a ready means of trans- 
mitting disease. 

Recent experiments made by the Kansas State Board 
of Health ^ give results which are in accord with the 
work of other investigators and plainly showed the 
presence of mouth bacteria and other micro-organisms, 
including those which cause pneumonia, on drinking 
cups from an office building, a ward school, and a rail- 
road station. This means that the user of the public 
drinking cup runs the risk of taking into his mouth 
more or less of the saliva of some other person and 
may take with it micro-organisms causing virulent 
disease as wcill as the ordinary mouth bacteria which 
are doubtless harmless. These unpleasant and danger- 
ous features may be avoided by the use of proper drink- 
ing fountains and cups. 

In many homes a glass or cup is placed by the water 
pail or water cooler and is used by all the members of 
the family. Such a custom should not be followed. 
Although it is necessarily less dangerous than the 
public drinking cup, it is not a cleanly practice and is 
many times without doubt responsible for the spread 
of colds and other minor ailments throughout a family. 

Personal Cleanliness in the Kitchen 

There may sometimes be observed in the cooked 
dish a loss of flavor, not a bad taste, but a lack of what 
is appetizing. It would be interesting to know in 
how many cases this comes from a lack of cleanliness 
in utensils and methods. 

Personal cleanliness is of course essential in the 
kitchen, and every good housekeeper endeavors to 
maintain a high standard in such matters. Some food

CARE OF FOOD IN THE HOME 121 

manufactories make special efforts to secure cleanli- 
ness and hygienic surroundings, and the good example 
they set should be generally followed. 

" Food and fingers are carriers of contagion." The 
proper way of washing the hands, if seriously taught 
and seriously practiced, in the market and in the 
kitchen, would go far to remove the source not only 
of infection but of such additions to the food as are 
disgusting to think of. In this matter some food 
manufactories are cleaner in their methods than are 
our kitchens. In one large bakery, where information 
was collected, the rule is in force that every employee 
shall wash his hands on returning to the room after 
leaving it for any purpose whatever. 

The running tap, Uke the shower bath, offers a great 
improvement over old methods of washing. Few 
will have patience to fill and refill the hand basin until 
the hands are bathed at last in clean water, but this 
result is easily accomplished under the tap. The 
nailbrush and nail cleaner must have their place in the 
kitchen, and their use must be insisted on before bread 
or cake is mixed and after work at all soiling in char- 
acter. 

Every one will admit that there is need for exercising 
great care in coughing and sneezing wherever such 
necessary acts may be annoying to others. When one 
recalls that experiment has shown that a fine spray 
of saliva may be thrown in all directions for a dis- 
tance of 4 or 5 feet by a violent sneeze or cough and 
that often the cause of the cough or sneeze is some- 
thing which can be thus communicated to others, it is 
evident that there is abundant reason for caution. 
Particularly is this essential wherever food is prepared, 
exposed, or served. 



122 ADVICE TO THE HOUSEWIFE 

Uae of Paper in the Kitchen 

Paper has many uses in the kitchen. The cook needs 
a piece of paper on which to drain the fried croquette 
or fritter, and she reaches out for the brown paper that 
came around the meat or for the grocer's bag. She 
turns to the same source when she wishes paper for 
lining a cake pan. A little reflection will show how far 
from cleanly is this practice. 

In every kitchen should be found a roll of grocer's 
paper on its frame. You are sure here of something 
that has not been handled since it was rolled up by 
machinery in the factory. Paraffin paper should also 
be at hand for covering food, for wrapping up sand- 
wiches for school lunches, and for similar purposes. 

Importance of Good House Plans and Home 

Conveniences 

The care of food in the home and all other forms of 
household work are greatly facilitated by right planning 
and the use of suitable materials for the construction 
and furnishing of the home. An adequate and con- 
venient water supply and other conveniences are 
essential, not only for comfort and for saving labor, 
but also from the standpoint of home hygiene. The 
question of home conveniences, the arrangement of a 
kitchen, and similar topics are considered in other 
bulletins ^ of this series and in many volumes on the 
house and house construction.^ 

Cleanliness in Public Eating Places

CARE OP FOOD IN THE HOME 123 

to the public is a matter to which most persons who 
patronize them have given at least occasional thought. 

Perhaps the most common attitude toward this sub- 
ject of the " temporary home," as toward markets 
and other places where food is handled or prepared 
before it reaches the home kitchen, is that it is least 
disturbing to put it out of mind and to forget unpleasant 
things which, it is assumed, can not be remedied. 

This is not the right attitude, for the subject has a 
direct relation to comfort and to health and is one in 
which public sentiment is perhaps the chief factor in 
securing regulation. Legislation regarding the in- 
spection and regulation of hotels, restaurants, and 
other places where meals are served is in force in some 
cities and contemplated in others. The results of the 
inspection of restaurant and lunch-room kitchens in 
Washington, D. C, by the board of health indicates that 
the matter is one which needs to be under control, and 
concerning which the pubUc has a right to full informa- 
tion, so that the clean places may be patronized and the 
others avoided. 

Proper ventilation in hotel and restaurant kitchens, 
suitable sanitary conveniences for employees, and 
whatever else makes for clean food are matters of public 
hygiene which are of the same importance as is the case 
with bakeries, markets, candy factories, and other 
places where food is handled. 

There are other matters which are also worth con- 
sidering in this connection. 

It is no very uncommon thing to notice in a hotel, 
restaurant, or dining car, and often in those which 
pride themselves on the excellence of their service, 
practices which would not be permitted if due atten- 
tion was paid to all matters of hygiene. For instance, 



124 ADVICJE TO THE HOUSEWIFE 

it may be sometimes noted that finger bowls which 
have not been washed since a previous service are placed 
before guests. Soiled napkins may also be seen occa- 
sionally in use for wiping off table dishes before ser- 
vice. It is certain that such practices where they exist 
would not continue if supervision by the manage- 
ment was as thorough as it should be or if patrons 
were not indifferent to them or lacking in observation. 

The public owes a duty to the management in such 
matters and all such violations of the laws of hygiene 
and cleanliness should be reported to the proper per- 
son. Here, as in most other instances, the remedy 
Ues in the hands of the pubUc. 

On the other hand, there is no ground for a general 
suspicion of the methods in use in hotels and restau- 
rants. Probably in the majority of cases a great deal 
of attention is given to kitchen and serving-room 
equipment, which is designed as regards both material 
and method of construction in such a way that it may 
be readily kept clean, and good hotels and restaurants 
are constantly endeavoring to make sure that food is 
handled, cooked, and served in a cleanly manner. 
In general, carefully managed hotels welcome inspec- 
tion of their kitchens and storerooms by visitors. 

In conclusion it may be said that the preparation of 
food must more and more come to be considered as an 
occupation that requires of the person who undertakes 
it knowledge and habits quite beyond what is now 
expected of a person who is simply a " good cook." 

It is even more essential that the housewife who 
buys food and who attends to her own food preparation 
should have such knowledge.

THE HOME VEGETABLE GARDEN 



W. R. BEATTIE 

Assistant Horticulturist, Bureau of Plant Industry 



INTRODUCTION 

It would be impossible to make an accurate estimate 
of the value of crops grown in the kitchen gardens of 
the United States, but from careful observation the 
statement can safely be made that a well-kept garden 
will yield a return ten to fifteen times greater than 
would the same area and location if devoted to general 
farm crops. A half acre devoted to the various kinds 
of garden crops will easily supply a family with $100 
worth of vegetables during the year, while the average 
return for farm crops is considerably less than one- 
tenth of this amount. A bountiful supply of vegetables 
close at hand where they may be secured at a few 
moments' notice is of even more importance than 
the mere money value. 

Fresh vegetables from the home garden are not 
subjected to exposure on the markets or in trans- 
portation and are not liable to become infected in any 

125 



126 ADVICE TO THE HOUSEWIFE 

way. Many of the products of the garden lose their 
characteristic flavor when not used within a few 
hours after gathering. By means of the home garden 
the production of the vegetable supply for the family 
is directly under control, and in many cases is the only 
way whereby clean, fresh produce may be secured. The 
home vegetable garden is worthy of increased atten- 
tion, and a greater number and variety of crops should 
be included in the garden. 

Suggestions are herein given as to the location of the 
garden, the soil and its preparation, fertilizers^ seeds, 
and plants, with brief cultural methods for a number 
of the more important crops. 

Location of the Garden 

The question of the proximity to the house or other 
buildings is of great importance when locating the gar- 
den. In old homesteads the garden was generally 
located directly adjacent to the house, requiring but 
a few steps from the kitchen to reach the extreme 
parts of the garden. The work of caring for a garden 
is usually done at spare times, and for this reason alone 
the location should be near the dwelling. In case the 
site chosen for the garden should become unsuitable 
for any cause it is not a difficult matter to change 
the location. Many persons prefer to plant the garden 
in a different location every 5 or 6 years. 

The lay of the land has considerable influence upon 
the time that the soil can be worked, and a gentle slope 
toward the south or southeast is most desirable for the 
production of early crops. It is an advantage to have 
protection on the north and northwest by either 
a hill, a groups of trees, evergreens, a hedge, buildings, 



THE HOME VEGETABLE GARDEN 127 

a tight board fence, or a stone wall to break the force 
of the wind. 

Good natural drainage of the garden area is of prime 
importance. The land should have sufficient fall to 
drain off surplus water during heavy rains, but the 
fall should not be so great that the soil will be washed. 
The surface of the garden should not contain depres- 
sions in which water will accumulate or stand. Waste 
water from surrounding land should not flow toward 
the garden, and the fall below should be such that there 
will be no danger of flood water backing up. The 
garden should not be located along the banks of a creek 
or stream that will be liable to overflow during the grow- 
ing season. 

A good fence around the garden plot is almost indis- 
pensable, and it should be a safeguard against all farm 
animals, including poultry, and should be close enough 
to keep out rabbits. A tight board fence will accom- 
plish this result and also serve as a wind-break. 

Plan and Arrangement of the Garden 

It would be difficult to give a plan or specific arrange- 
ment for a garden that would suit all demands, and such 
a plan must be devised by each individual grower. 
Suggestive arrangements, however, are here presented, 
with the idea that thay can readily be changed to suit 
local conditions. 

Kind of CultiTation to be Emjiloyed 

The first consideration in planning the arrangement 
of a garden is the kind of cultivation that is to be 
employed. Where the work is to be done mainly 
by means of horse tools the arrangement should be 
such as to give the longest possible rows, and straight. 



ADVICE TO THE HOUSEWIFE 



THE HOME VEGETABLE GARDEN 



Fia. 2. — PIui of • City-lot or Buk-ywd Qaidin. 60 b)> SO FoH. 



130 ADVICE TO THE HOUSEWIFE 

outlines should be followed. The garden should be free 
from paths across the rows, and turning spaces should 
be provided at the ends. (Fig. 1.) For hand culti- 
vation the arrangement can be quite different, as the 
garden may be laid off in sections, with transverse 
walks, and the rows can be much closer for most 
crops. (Fig. 2.) Horse cultivation is reconmiended 
whenever possible, as it very materially lessens the 
labor and cost of caring for the crops. 

Location of Crops 

The second matter for consideration is the location 
of permanent crops, such as asparagus and rhubarb, 
and if any of the small fruits, such as raspberries, cur- 
rants, and gooseberries, are to be planted within the 
garden inclosure, they should be included with the per- 
manent crops. The area devoted to the hotbed, 
cold frame, and seed bed shoidd be decided upon, 
but these may be shifted more or less from year to year 
or located in some convenient place outside of the 
garden. 

Where there is any great variation in the composition 
of the soil in different parts of the garden it will be 
advisable to take this into consideration when arrang- 
ing for the location of the various crops. If a part of 
the land is low and moist, such crops as celery, onions, 
and late cuciunbers should be placed there. If part 
of the soil is high, warm, and dry, that is the proper 
location for early crops and those that need quick, 
warm soil. 

Succession of Crops 

In planning the location of the various crops in the 
garden, due consideration should be given to the matter 
of succession in order that the land may be occupied 



THE HOME VEGETABLE GARDEN 131 

at all times. As a rule it would not be best to have 
a second planting of the same crop follow the first, 
but some such arrangement as early peas followed by 
celery, or early cabbage or potatoes followed by late 
beans or corn, and similar combinations, are more 
satisfactory. In the South as many as three crops 
may be grown one after the other on the same land, 
but at the extreme north, where the season is short, 
but one crop can be grown, or possibly two by some 
such combination as early peas followed by turnips. 

Preparation of the Soil 

Where there is considerable choice in the location 
of the garden plot, it is often possible to select land 
that will require very Uttle special preparation. On 
the other hand, it may be necessary to take an unde- 
sirable soil and bring it into suitable condition, and it 
is generally surprising to note the change that can be 
wrought in a single season. 

Drainage 

There are very few soils that are not improved 
'^y some form of drainage. Heavy clay soils are 
benefited most by drainage, but sandy soils having 
a clay subsoil are made warmer and greatly improved 
by having the excess soil water removed quickly. 

Plowing 

Autumn is the time for plowing hard or stiff clay 
soils, especially if in a part of the country where freez- 
ing takes place, as the action of the frost during the 
winter will break the soil into fine particles and render 
it suitable for planting. Sandy loams and soils that 



132 ADVICE TO THE^ HOUSEWIFE 

contain a large amount of humus may be plowed 
in the spring; but the work should be done early in 
order that the soil may settle before planting. In 
the Southern States, where there is not sufficient frost 
to mellow the soil, this process must be accomplished 
by means of frequent cultivations, in order that the air 
may act upon the soil particles. It is desirable to 
plow the garden early, at least a few days sooner than 
for general field crops. 

Sandy soils will bear plowing much earlier than heavy 
clay soils. The usual test is to squeeze together a 
handful, and if the soil adheres in a ball it is too wet 
for working. In the garden greater depth of plowing 
should be practiced than for ordinary farm crops, 
as the roots of many of the vegetables go deeply into 
the soil. SubsoiUng will be found advantageous in 
most cases, as the drainage and general movement 
of the soil moisture will be improved thereby. 

Hand spading should be resorted to only in very 
small gardens or where it is desirable to prepare a 
small area very thoroughly. 

Smoothing and Polveiiziiig fhe Soil 

After plowing, the next important step is to smooth 
and pulverize the soil. If the soil be well prepared 
before planting, the work of caring for the crops will 
be very materially lessened. It is not sufficient that 
the land be smooth and fine on top, but the pulverizing 
process should extend as deep as the plowing. Some 
gardeners prefer to thoroughly cut the land with a 
disk harrow before plowing, so that when it is turned 
by the plow the bottom soil will be fine and mellow. 
After the plow the disk or cutting harrow is again 
brought into play and the pulverizing process com- 



THE HOME VEGETABLE GARDEN 133 

pleted. If the soil is a trifle too dry and contains 
lumps, it may be necessary to use some form of roller 
or clod crusher to bring it down. For smoothing the 
surface and filling up depressions a float or drag 
made from planks or scantlings will be found ser- 
viceable. 

Special Preparation 

For growing certain crops it has often been found 
advisable to prepare the ground in a special manner. 
Such crops as beets, radishes, and onions are some- 
times grown on beds 6 to 10 feet in width and raised 
6 to 8 inches, with narrow walks between. 

From Baltimore southward, cabbage, cauliflower, 
or and similar crops are frequently grown on top 
on the side of ridges. When the plants are set on 
top of the ridge, better drainage for the roots is 
secured. When set on the south side of the ridge, 
greater warmth and earUer maturity wiU be secured, 
and when planted on the north side, the growth is 
retarded. For growing celery and a few similar crops 
it has often been found advisable to place the plants 
in furrows or slight trenches in order that the soil 
removed may be available for working in around 
the plants as they mature. 

Fertilizers 

The kind of fertilizer employed has a marked influence 
upon the character and quality of the vegetables pro- 
duced. For the garden only those fertiUzers that have 
been carefully prepared should be used. Fertilizers 
of organic composition, such as barnyard manure, 
should have passed through the fermenting stage before 
being used. The use of night soil generally is not to 



134 ADVICE TO THE HOUSEWIFE 

be recommended^ as its application, unless properly 
treated for the destruction of disease germs, may prove 
dangerous to health. 

Barnyard Manure 

For garden crops there is no fertilizer that will com- 
pare with good, well-rotted barnyard manure. In 
localities where a supply of such manure can not be 
secured it will be necessary to depend upon commercial 
fertiUzers, but the results are rarely so satisfactory. 
In selecting manure for the garden, care should be 
, taken that it does not contain any element that will 
be injurious to the soil. An excess of sawdust or shav- 
ings used as bedding will have a tendency to produce 
sourness in the soil. Chicken, pigeon, and sheep ma- 
nures rank high as fertiUzers, their value being some- 
what greater than ordinary barnyard manures, and 
almost as great as some of the lower grades of commer- 
cial fertilizers. The manure from fowls is especially . 
adapted for dropping in the hills or rows of plants. 

Commercial Fertilizers 

Commercial fertilizers are sold under a guaranteed 
analysis, and generally at a price consistent with their 
fertiUzing value. No definite rule can be given for 
the kind or quantity of fertilizer to be appUed, as this 
varies with the crop and the land. At first the only 
safe procedure is to use a good high-grade fertilizer 
at the rate of from 1,000 to 2,000 poimds to the acre 
and note the results. Market gardeners frequently 
apply as much as 2,500 pounds of high-grade fertiUzer 
per acre each year. 

Where plants are not to be transplanted twice, but 
remain in the plant bed until required for setting in 



THE HOME VEGETABLE GARDEN 135 

the garden, it may be necessary to thin them somewhat* 
This part of the work should be done as soon as the 
plants are large enough to pull, and before they begin 
to *' draw " or become spindling from crowding. 

When thinnnig plants in the plant bed it should be the 
aim to remove the centers of the thick bunches, leaving 
the spaces as uniform as possible. When thinning 
the rows of seedlings in the garden the best plants 
should be allowed to remain, but due consideration 
should be given to the matter of proper spacing. Fail- 
ure to thin plants properly will invariably result in 
the production of an inferior crop. 

Effects of Transplanting 

At the North, where the growing season is short, 
it is necessary to transplant several of the garden 
crops in order to secure strong plants that will mature 
within the hmits of the growing season. In the South- 
ern States the season is longer, and transplanting, 
while desirable, may not be necessary, as many crops 
that must be started indoors at the North can be planted 
in the garden where they are to remain. Transplant- 
ing should be done as soon as the seedlings are large 
enough to handle, and again when the plants begin to 
crowd one another. 

Aside from producing more uniform and hardy 
plants, the transplanting process has several other 
very marked influences. Certain crops which are 
grown for their straight roots are often injured by 
having their roots bent or broken in transplanting. On 
the other hand, such plants as celery, which at first have 
a straight root and are grown for their tops, are greatly 
benefited by transplanting. In all cases transplanting 
has a tendency to increase the number of small roots, 



/

and these are the main dependence of the plant at the 
time it is set in the open ground. 

For further information on this subject, see Farmers' 
Bulletins Nos. 77 on The Liming of Soils, 192 on Barn- 
yard Manure, and 222, Experiment Station Work, 
XXVIII, which contains a chapter on the Home 
Mixing of Fertilizers. 

Seeds and Plants for the Garden 

The supply of seeds for the garden should be secured 
some time in advance of the planting season. During 
the winter months send for the catalogue of some 
seedsman in your part of the country and make a 
selection of the kinds and quantities of seeds that 
you desire to plant. Garden seeds can frequently 
be secured of some local dealer who handles them in 
conjunction with other goods. Many of the garden 
seeds lose their vitality after one year's time, and old 
seeds should, as a rule, not be relied upon. 

Throughout the Northern States it is desirable to 
start plants of certain crops before the danger of 
frost has passed. The simplest method of starting a 
limited number of early plants is by means of a shallow 
box placed in a south window of the dwelling. After 
the plants appear, the box should be turned each day 
to prevent the plants drawing toward the light. 

Early Plants in Hotbeds 

The most common method of starting early plants 
in the North is by means of a hotbed. The hotbed 
consists of an inclosure covered with sash and supplied 
with some form of heat, usually fermenting stable 
manure, to keep the plants warm and in a growing 



THE HOME VEGETABLE GARDEN 137 

condition. As a rule, the hotbed should not be placed 
within the garden inclosure, but near some frequently 
used path or building where it can receive attention 
without interfering with other work. The hotbed 
should always face to the south, and the south side 
of either a dwelling, barn, tight board fence, hedge, 
or anything affording similar protection, will furnish 
a good location. 

In the North the hotbed should be started in Febru- 
ary or early in March, in order that such plants as the 
tomato and early cabbage may be well grown in time 
to plant in the open ground. There are two or three 
forms of hotbeds that are worthy of description, 
and the plans suggested may be modified to suit local 
conditions. 

A temporary hotbed, such as would ordinarily be 
employed on the farm, is easily constructed by the use 
of manure from the horse stable as a means of furnishing 
the heat. Select a well-drained location, where the bed 
will be sheltered, shake out the manure into a broad, 
flat heap, and thoroughly compact it by tramping. 
The manure heap should be 8 or 9 feet wide, 18 to 24 
inches deep when compacted, and of any desired length, 
according to the number of sash to be employed. The 
manure for hotbed purposes should contain sufficient 
litter, such as leaves or straw, to prevent its packing 
soggy, and should spring slightly when trodden upon. 

After the manure has been properly tramped and 
leveled, the frames to support the sash are placed in 
position facing toward the south. These frames are 
generally made to carry 4 standard hotbed sash, and 
the front board should be 4 to 6 inches lower than the 
back, in order that water will drain from the glass. 
Three to five inches of good garden loam or specially 



138 ADVICE TO THE HOUSEWIFE 

prepared soil is spread evenly over the area inclosed 
by the frame, the sash put on, and the bed allowed to 
heat. At first the temperature of the bed will run 
quite high, but no seeds should be planted until the 
soil temperature falls to 80^ F., which will be in about 
three days. 

Hotbeds having more or less permanence may be so 
constructed as to be heated either with fermenting 
manure, a stove, a brick flue, or by means of radiating 
pipes suppUed with steam or hot water from a dwell- 
ing or other heating plant. For a permanent bed in 
which fermenting manure is to supply the heat, a pit 
24 to 30 inches in depth should be provided. The 
sides and ends of the pit may be supported by brick 
walls or by a lining of 2-inch plank held in place by 
stakes. 

Standard hotbed sash are 3 by 6 feet in size, and 
are usually constructed of white pine or cypress. As 
a rule, hotbed sash can be purchased cheaper than they 
can be made locally, and are on sale by seedsmen and 
dealers in garden supplies. In the colder parts of the 
country, in addition to glazed sash either board shut- 
ters, straw mats, burlap, or old carpet will be required 
as a covering during cold nights. It is also desirable 
to have a supply of straw or loose manure on hand to 
throw over the bed in case of extremely cold weather. 

During bright days the hotbed will heat very quickly 
from the sunshine on the glass and it will be necessary 
to ventilate during the early morning by slightly raising 
the sash on the opposite side from the wind. Care 
should be taken in ventilating to protect the plants 
from a draft of cold air. Toward evening the sash 
should be closed in order that the bed may become 
sufficiently warm before nightfall. 



THE HOME VEGETABLE GARDEN 139 

Hotbeds should be watered on bright days and in the 
morning only. Watering in the evening or on cloudy 
days will have a tendency to chill the bed and increase 
the danger from freezing. After watering, the bed 
should be well ventilated to dry the foliage of the plants 
and the surface of the soil, to prevent the plants being 
lost by damping-off fungus or mildew. 

Early Plants in Cold Frames 

The construction of cold frames is the same as for 
temporary hotbeds except that no manure or other 
heating material is provided. Cold frames are covered 
by means of ordinary hotbed sash, or cotton cloth 
may be substituted for the sash. In the North the 
use of the cold frame is for hardening oflf plants that 
have been started in the hotbed, preparatory to setting 
them in the garden. In the South, where the weather 
is not so severe, the cold frame is made to take the place 
of the hotbed in starting early plants. The same 
methods of handling recommended for a hotbed should 
apply to a cold frame, and thorough ventilation should 
be maintained. 

The Seed Bed 

In the broadest sense the entire garden is a seed bed, 
as the seeds of many of the crops are planted where 
they are to grow. As the term "seed bed " is used 
here it refers to some specially prepared place for start- 
ing plants, from which they may be transplanted to 
their permanent positions in the garden. The location 
of an outdoor seed bed should be such that it may be 
conveniently reached for watering, and it should be 
naturally protected from drying winds. 

Good soil for a seed bed consists of one part of well- 



140 ADVICE TO THE HOUSEWIFE 

rotted manure, two part3 of good garden loam or rotted 
sods, and one part of sharp, fine sand. The manure 
should be thoroughly rotted, but it should not have 
been exposed to the weather and the strength leached 
out of it. The addition of leaf mold or peat will tend 
to make the soil better adapted for seed-bed purposes. 
Mix all the ingredients together in a heap, stirring 
well with a shovel, after which the soil should be sifted 
and placed in boxes or in the bed ready for sowing 
the seed. 

Weed seeds, and the spores of fungous diseases that 
are present in the soil for a seed bed, may be killed by 
placing the soil in pans and baking it for an hour in a 
hot oven. 

Seed Sowing 

Garden seeds should always be sown in straight rows, 
regardless of where the planting is made. If a window 
box is employed for starting early plants in a dwelling, 
the soil should be well firmed and then laid off in straight 
rows about 2 inches apart. The same method holds 
good for planting seeds in a hotbed, cold frame, or 
bed in the garden, except that the rows should be far- 
ther apart than in the window box. By planting 
in straight rows the seedUngs will be more uniform 
in size and shape, and thinning and cultivating will be 
more easily accomplished. In all cases where the 
soU of the seed bed is not too wet, it should be well 
firmed or pressed down before laying off and marking 
for sowing the seeds. After the seeds are sown and 
covered, the surface should again be firmed by means of 
a smooth board. 

No definite rule can be given for the depth to which 
seeds should be planted, for the depth should vary 



THE HOME VEGETABLE GARDEN 141 

with the kind of seed and with the character and condi- 
tion of the soil. In heavy clay and moist soils the cov- 
ering should be lighter than in sandy or dry soils. In 
all cases the depth should be uniform, and when plant- 
ing seeds in boxes or a bed the grooves in which the 
seeds are planted should be made with the edge of a 
thin lath. 

Care of the Seed Bed 

The seed bed should never be allowed to become dry, 
but great care should be taken that too much water 
is not apphed. Plants require the action of air upon 
their roots, and an excess of water in the soil will exclude 
the air. Too frequent and heavy waterings will cause 
the damping-off of the seedlings. 

The Handling of Plants 

Successful transplanting of indoor-grown plants to 
the garden or field depends largely upon their proper 
treatment during the two weeks preceding the time 
of their removal. Spindling and tender plants will 
not withstand the exposure of the open ground so well 
as sturdy, well-grown plants, such as may be secured 
by proper handling. 

Hardening Off 

Plants grown in a house, hotbed, or cold frame will 
require to be hardened off before planting in the garden. 
By the process of hardening off, the plants are grad- 
ually acclimated to the effects of the sun and wind 
so that they will stand transplanting to the open 
ground. Hardening off is usually accomplished by 
ventilating freely and by reducing the amount of water 



142 ADVICE TO THE HOUSEWIFE 

applied to the plant bed. The plant bed should not 
become so dry that the plants will wilt or be seriously 
checked in their growth. After a few days it will 
be possible to leave the plants uncovered during the 
entire day and on mild nights. By the time the plants 
are required for setting in the garden they should be 
thoroughly accUmated to outdoor conditions and can 
be transplanted with but few losses. 

Special Methods of Transplanting 

A large number of garden crops, including melons, 
cucumbers, and beans, do not transplant readily from 
the seed bed to the open ground, and some special 
means for handling the plants must be employed 
where extra early planting is desired. A common 
practice among gardeners is to fill pint or quart berry 
boxes with good soU and plant a single hill in each 
box. 

Another method is to cut sods into pieces about 2 
inches thick and 6 inches square and place them, 
root side upward, on the greenhouse bench or in the 
hotbed, the hills being planted in the loamy soil held 
in place by the roots of the grass. When the weather 
becomes sufficiently warm, and it is desired to set the 
plants in the garden, the berry boxes or pieces of sod 
are placed on a flat tray and carried to the place where 
the planting is to be done. Holes of sufficient size 
and depth are dug and the boxes or sods are simply 
buried at the points where it is desired to have the hills 
of plants. The boxes should be placed a little below 
the surface, and fine earth worked in aroimd the plants. 
If it is thought desirable, the bottoms of the boxes 
may be cut away when set in the garden. 



THE HOME VEGETABLE GARDEN 143 

Setting in the Open Ground 

A few hours before removing plants from the seed 
bed or plant bed they should be well watered and the 
water allowed to soak into the soil. This will insure 
a portion of the soil adhering to the roots and prevent 
the plants from wilting. If the plants have been 
properly thinned or transplanted it is often possible 
to run a knife or trowel between them, thus cutting 
the soil into cubes that are transferred with them to 
the garden. 

Where the soil does not adhere to the roots of the 
plants it is well to puddle them. In the process of 
puddling, a hole is dug in the earth near the plant 
bed, or a large pail may be used for the purpose; 
and a thin slime, .consisting of clay, cow manure, and 
water, is prepared. The plants are taken in small 
bunches and their roots thoroughly coated with this 
mixture by dipping them up and down in the puddle 
a few times. PuddUng insures a coating of moist 
earth over the entire root system of the plant, prevents 
the air from reaching the rootlets while on the way to 
the garden, and aids in securing direct contact between 
the roots and the soil. 

Previous to setting out plants, the land should be 
worked over and put in good condition, and everything 
should be ready for quick operations when a suitable 
time arrives. The rows should be measured oflf, but 
it is well to defer making the furrows or digging the 
holes until ready to plant, in order to have the soil 
fresh. The time best suited for transferring plants 
from the plant bed to the open ground is when there is 
considerable moisture in the air and clouds obscure 
the sun, and if the plants can be set before a shower 



144 ADVICE TO THE HOUSEWIFE 

there will be no difficulty in getting them to grow. 
During seasons when there is very Uttle rain at plant- 
ing time, or in irrigated regions, evening is the best time 
to set the plants. 

It is possible to set plants in quite dry soil, provided 
the roots are puddled and the earth well packed about 
them. When water is used in setting plants it should 
be applied after the hole has been partially filled, and 
the moist earth should then be covered with dry soil 
to prevent baking. Where water is available for 
irrigation it will be sufficient to puddle the roots and 
then irrigate after the plants are all in place. 

Plants should be set a trifle deeper in the garden 
than they were in the plant bed. The majority of 
plants require to be set upright, and where the dibble 
is used for planting, care should be taken that the soil 
is well pressed around the roots and no air spaces 
left 

Time of Planting 

No definite rule can be given regarding the time for 
planting seeds and plants in the garden, for the date 
varies with the locality and the time that it is desired 
to have the crop mature. A Uttle practice will soon 
determine when and how often sowings should be made 
in order to escape frost and mature the crop at a 
time when it will be most useful. Certain crops will 
not thrive during the heated part of the summer, and 
their time of planting must be planned accordingly. 

Protection of Plants 

Some plants require protection from the direct rays 
of the sun in summer or from cold in winter, and there 
are many that need special protection while they are 



THE HOME VEGETABLE QABDE N 145 

quite small. Seedlings of many of the garden crops 

are unable to force their way through the crust formed 

on the soil after heavy rains, and it is necessary either 

to break the crust with a steel rake or soften it by 

watering. 

Protection from Heat 

In parts of the country where the sunshine is ex- 
tremely hot during a part of the summer, some plants, 
especially those that are grown for salad purposes, 
are benefited by shading. Shading is often used 
in the care of small plants when they are first trans- 
planted. 

Where boards are available they can be used for 
protecting plants that have been set in rows in the gar- 
den, by placing them on the south side of the row at 
an angle that will cast a shadow over the plants, and 
holding them in place by short stakes driven in the 
ground. Laths, wooden slats, cotton cloth, or shaded 
sash are frequently used to protect plant beds from the 

heat of summer. 

Protection from Cold 

For protecting plants from cold in winter several 
kinds of materials are used, such as boards, cloth, pine 
boughs, straw, manure, or leaves. There are a num- 
ber of crops of a tropical nature that may be grown 
far north, provided they are properly protected during 
the winter. 

Several of the annual crops can be matured much 
earUer in the spring if they are' planted in the autumn 
and protected during the winter. Plants of this kind 
can often be protected by means of boards set at an 
angle on the north side of the row instead of on the 
south. A mulch of manure, straw, or leaves forms a 
good protection, but care should be taken that the 



146 ADVICE TO THE HOUUEWIKE 

mulch does not contain seeds of any kind, or serious 
trouble wiD attend the further cultivation of the crop. 
Plants are Uke animals in that they require air, and 
care should be exercised in putting on the winter cover- 
ing not to smother them. Coarse, loose materials are 
better for a winter covering then fine, easily-compacted 
substances. 

Cultivation of Garden Crops 

Frequent shallow cultivation should be employed 
for most garden crops, and during dry weather the 
depth should not exceed 2 inches. By keeping the 
surface soil well stirred what is termed a '^ dust mulch " 
is formed, and while this kyer of finely divided soil wiU 
become quite dry it prevents the escape of moisture 
through the pores of the soil. A mulch consisting of 
fine manure, clippings from the lawn, or any similar 
material, spread to a distance of 10 or 12 inches around 
the plants will preserve the moisture; but the mulch 
should not be so heavy as to exclude the air. 

A crust forming over the soil after a rain or watering 
is detrimental to plant growth, and should be broken 
up as soon as the land can be worked. To determine 
when the soil is sufficiently dry for cultivation, apply 
the usual test of squeezing in the hand. Sandy soils 
can be worked much sooner than clay soils after a rain. 
Too much importance can not be placed upon the 
matter of thorough cultivation of the garden, and if 
the work is promptly and properly done there will be 
little difficulty in controlling weeds. 

Tools for Use in the Garden 

There are a number of one-horse cultivators that are 
especially adapted for work in the garden. These 



THE HOME VEGETABLE GARDEN 147 

may be provided with several sizes of teeth and shovels, 
and are easily transformed for various kinds of work. 
In working the crops while they are small, the harrow 
or smaller teeth may be used, and later when the 
plants become larger, the size of the shovels may be 
increased. Many gardeners, however, prefer to use the 
harrow teeth at all times. 

When it is desirable to ridge up the soil around a 
crop, the wings, or hillers, may be put on either side of 
the cultivator. A one-horse turning plow is useful for 
running off rows or throwing up ridges. Aside from 
the horse tools in general use on the farm, there are only 
one or two cultivators that will be required for the 
garden, and these are not expensive. 

The outfit of hand tools for the garden should include 
a spade, a spading fork, a cut-steel rake, a 10-foot 
measuring pole, a Une for laying off rows, a standard 
hoe, a narrow hoe, dibbles, a trowel, an assortment 
of hand weeders, a watering can, a wheelbarrow, and 
if the work is to be done largely by hand the outfit 
should also include some form of wheel hoe, of which 
there are a number on the market. 

Irrigation of Garden Crops 

Throughout the portions of the country where rains 
occur during the growing season, it should not be neces- 
sary to irrigate in order to produce the ordinary gar- 
den crops. In arid regions, where irrigation must be 
depended upon for the production of crops, the system 
best adapted for use in that particular locality should 
be employed in the garden. Wherever irrigation is 
practiced the water should not be applied until needed, 
and then the soil should be thoroughly soaked. 
After irrigation, the land should be cultivated as soon 



148 ADVICE TO THE HOUSEWIFE 

as the surface becomes sufficiently dry, and no more 
water should be applied until the plants begin to show 
the need of additional moistiu'e. Constant or exces- 
sive watering is very detrimental in every case. Apply 
the water at any time of the day that is most conven- 
ient and when the plants require it. 

By the subirrigation method of watering, lines of 
farm drain tiles or perforated pipes are laid on a level 
a few inches below the surface of the soil. This S3rstem 
is especially adapted for use in back-yard gardens 
where city water is available and where the area imder 
cultivation is small. Subirrigation is expensive to 
install, as the Unes of tiles should be about 3 feet apart, 
or one line for each standard row. By connecting 
the tiles at one end by means of a tile across the rows, 
the water may be discharged into the tiles at one point 
from a hose, and will find its way to all parts of the sys- 
tem, entering the soil through the openings. 

For further information on irrigation see Farmers' 
Bulletin No. 138, entitled " Irrigation in Field and 
Garden." 

Precautions to Avoid Attacks of Insects and Diseases 

In the control of insects and diseases that infest 
garden crops it is often possible to accomplish a great 
amount of good by careful sanitary management. 
In the autumn, after the crops have been harvested, 
or as fast as any crop is disposed of, any refuse that 
remains should be gathered and placed in the compost 
heap, or burned if diseased or infested with insects. 
Several of the garden insects find protection during the 
winter under boards and any loose material that may 
remain in the garden. Dead vines or leaves of plants 
are frequently covered with spores of diseases that 



/ 



THE HOME VEGETABLE GARDEN 149 

affect those crops during the growing season, and these 
should be burned, as they possess very little fertilizing 
value. 

For information on garden insects and their control, 
address the Bureau of Entomology of this Department. 

The diseases of garden crops are too numerous for 
attention in a publication of this nature. Specific 
information can be secured by addressing the Chief 
of the Bureau of Plant Industry of this Department. 

Cultttral Hints for Garden Crops 

Artichoke, Globe 

Deep, rich sandy loam, with a liberal supply of well- 
rotted manure, is best suited for growing artichokes. 
Plant the seeds as soon as the soil is warm in the spring, 
and when the plants have formed three or four leaves 
they may be transplanted to rows 3 feet apart and 2 
feet apart in the row. The plants do not produce 
until the second season, and in cold localities some form 
of covering will be necessary during the winter. This 
crop is not suited for cultivation north of the line of 
zero temperature. 

After the bed is once established, the plants may be 
reset each year by using the side shoots from the base 
of the old plants. If not reset, the bed will continue 
to produce for several years, but the burs will not 
be so large as from new plants. The bur, or flower 
bud is the part used, and the burs should be gathered 
before the blossom part appears. If they are removed 
and no seed is allowed to form, the plants will continue 
to produce until the end of the season. 

The heads, or burs, of the French artichoke are pre- 
pared for the table by boiling, and served with melted 
butter or with cream dressing. 



150 ADVICE TO THE HOUSEWIFE 

Artichoke, Jerosalem 

The Jerusalem artichoke will grow in any good 
garden soil, and should be planted 3 to 4 feet apart 
each way, with three or four small tubers in a hill. 
If large tubers are used for planting they should 
be cut the same as Irish potatoes. Plant as soon as the 
ground becomes warm in the spring and cultivate as 
for corn. A pint of tubers cut to eyes will plant about 
thirty hills. The tubers will be ready for use in 
October, but may remain in the ground and be dug 
at any time during the winter. 

The tubers are prepared by boiling until soft, and are 
served with butter, or creamed. They are also used for 
salads and pickles. 

The Jerusalem artichoke is not of great importance 
as a garden vegetable, and the plant has a tendency 
to become a weed. 

Asparagus 

Asparagus should have a place in every home vege 
table garden where it will thrive. This crop can|be 
grown on almost any well-drained soil, but will do 
best on a deep mellow, sandy loam. There is little 
possibility of having the land too rich, and liberal 
applications of partly rotted barnyard manure should 
be made before the plants are set. The seeds of aspara- 
gus may be sown during the early spring in the rows 
where the plants are to remain, and the seedlings 
thinned to stand 14 inches apart in the row at the end 
of the first season. It is usually more satisfactory 
to purchase two-year-old roots from some seedsman 
or dealer. The price of good roots is generally about 
$1.25 per hundred, and one to two hundred plants 
will be found sufficient to supply the ordinary family. 



THE HOME VEGETABLE GARDEN 151 

The roots should be transplanted during the late 
autumn or early spring. 

Before setting out the plants the land should be 
loosened very deeply, either by subsoil plowing or deep 
spading. It is a good plan to remove the topsoil, and 
spade manure into the subsoil to a depth of 14 or 16 
inches; then replace the topsoil and add more manure. 
There are two methods of setting an asparagus bed, de- 
pending entirely upon the kind of cultivation to be em- 
ployed in the garden. If horse tools are to be used, 
the plants should be set in rows 3^ feet apart and 14 
inches apart in the row. On the other hand, if the gar- 
den space is limited, the plants should be set in a 
solid bed, 1 foot apart each way, and cultivated by 
hand. In setting asparagus the crowns should be 
covered to a depth of 4 or 5 inches. At the North 
it will be desirable to mulch the asparagus bed during 
the winter with 3 or 4 inches of loose manure or straw. 
In the South the covering during the winter will not 
be necessary, but the bed should receive a dressing of 
manure or fertilizer at some time each year, preferably 
in the autumn. 

The part of the asparagus used as a vegetable is the 
young shoots that are thrown up during the early 
spring. The shoots are removed when about 4 or 5 
inches in length by cutting shghtly below the sur- 
face of the ground, but care should be taken that the 
knife is not thrust at an angle or the crowns will be 
injured. If so desired, the shoots may be blanched by 
ridging up over the rows with loose, sandy soil or by 
allowing the mulch to remain and the shoots to make 
their way through it, but unblanched asparagus always 
has a better flavor than blanched, is more easily pro- 
duced, and is most satisfactory for home use. Too 



152 ADVICE TO TEIE HOUSEWIFE 

heavy mulching has a tendency to retard the growth 
of the shoots by keeping the ground cold until late 
in the spring. 

No shoots should be removed the first year the plants 
are set in the permanent bed, and the period of cutting 
should be short the second year. After the second 
year the plants become well estabUshed, and with 
proper fertiUzing and care the bed wiU last indefi- 
nitely. During the cutting season all of the shoots 
should be removed, as the roots will cease to throw up 
shoots as soon as one is allowed to mature. When 
the shoots become tough and stringy, or are no longer 
desired for use, the cutting should cease and the tops 
should be allowed to grow during the siunmer. Late 
in the autumn, when the tops become dead, they can 
be removed and burned, the soil between the rows 
cultivated, and a fertilizer or mulch applied. For full 
information, see Farmers' Bulletin No. 61, entitled 
"Asparagus Culture." 

There are several methods of preparing asparagus 
shoots for the table, the more common of which are as 
follows: 

(1) Boil the shoots until tender in water to which a 
small quantity of salt has been added; serve while hot, 
as greens, with a little butter, vinegar, salt, and pepper. 

(2) Boil as above and serve either with plain butter, 
or creamed. The shoots can be cooked entire or cut 
into short pieces, and when creamed they are fre- 
quently served on toast. 

Beans 

Beans thrive best in a rather warm, sandy loam, but 
may be grown on almost any kind of soil. For the 
best results the soil should not be too rich in nitrogenous 



. 1 



THE HOME VEGETABLE GARDEN 153 

matter, or the plants will run to foliage and stems at the 
expense of the crop of pods. Heavy clay soils are 
not well adapted to bean culture, owing to the tendency 
of the soil to bake and prevent the seedlings from com- 
ing up evenly. The bean does not draw heavily upon 
the soil and is suitable for rotation with other garden 
crops. 

Beans will not withstand frost, and the first plant- 
ings in the spring are frequently lost in this manner. 
It is very little trouble, however, to make a planting 
of beans, and the first planting should be made as 
soon as the ground is reasonably warm; this to be 
followed by a second and a third planting at intervals 
of about a week or ten days. It sometimes happens 
that the first planting will be killed by frost, and that 
the second will come through the ground immediately 
after the frost and mature several days ahead of those 
planted to replace the ones that were killed. 

There are several classes of edible beans, including 
both climbing and bush sorts, all of which are valuable 
as foods and of great commercial importance. The 
various types and varieties of beans are too numerous 
for discussion here, and a few cultural hints only 
will be given. 

In the cultivation of beans, the general rules for the 
care of garden crops should be adhered to, and fre- 
quent shallow stirring of the soil practiced. For a 
constant supply of bunch or snap beans, successive 
plantings should be made, the final planting being 
made about 8 weeks before time for frost in the autumn. 
In the South, plantings should be made as soon as the 
ground begins to warm, and continue until hot weather 
sets in. * Toward the end of summer one or two 
plantings should be made for a fall crop. 



154 ADVICE TO THE HOUSEWIFE 

For the production of bunch dry beans, such as Red 
Eidney, White Kidney, or White Marrow, plantings 
may be made almost any time during the first half of 
the summer. This class of bean is generally planted 
as late as possible to have the crop ripen just before 
early frost in the autumn. Bunch beans are generally 
planted in rows 30 inches apart, and the plants allowed 
to stand singly 3 or 4 inches apart, or they are planted 
in hills of 3 to 5 plants each, 12 to 15 inches apart. 
Good results may be obtained from planting Kidney 
or Marrow beans in the cornfield alongside the hills 
after the corn has been cultivated once or twice. 

Pole beans require a somewhat richer soil than the 
bunch type, and should be planted in hills 3 by 4 or 
4 by 4 feet, and, as the name implies, they require a pole 
or some similar support. Plant the seed during the 
early summer. Several varieties of climbing bean may 
be planted in the cornfield and allowed to cUmb upon 
the hills of corn. The old-fashioned corn bean belongs 
to this type. 

The Lima bean, both pole and bush, forms one of the 
most desirable products of the garden. This crop 
thrives best when the soil is quite rich; in fact, good 
Lima beans can not be grown in poor soil. They should 
not be planted until the soil becomes thoroughly 
warm. Place the seed in hills, 8 or 10 to the hill, and 
after the plants become established thin to 4 or 5. 
The hills should be 4 or 5 feet apart for the pole varie- 
ties and 2 or 3 feet apart for the dwarf or bunch 
varieties. It is a good plan to make up the hill with a 
Uttle additional manure well mixed with the soil. 
Cover the beans about 1) inches, placing them with 
the eye downward. 

When planting beans of any kind, the seed should not 



THE HOME VEGETABLE GARDEN 155 

be covered to a greater depth than 2 inches when the 
soil is moderately dry, and if the soil is wet, the cover- 
ing should be very slight. 

For additional information the reader is referred to 
Farmers' Bulletin No. 121, entitled ^* Beans, Peas, 
and Other Legumes as Food." 



Beets 

The red garden beet may be grown in any good 
soil, but rich sandy loam will give the best results. 
Sow the seeds in the spring as soon as danger of frost 
has passed. Beets should be planted in drills 12 to 
18 inches apart, and when the plants are well up they 
should be thinned to 4 or 5 inches in the row. If 
desirable to plant in rows 3 feet apart for horse cultiva- 
tion, the seeds may be sown in a double drill with 6 
inches between, leaving 30 inches for cultivation. Two 
oimces of beet seed are required to plant 100 feet of 
row, or 5 pounds to the acre. As a rule each seed 
ball contains more than one seed, and this accounts for 
beets coming up very thickly. The seed should be 
covered to a depth of about 1 inch. For a succession 
of yoimg beets during the summer, plantings should be 
made every 4 or 5 weeks during the spring months. 
Beets intended for winter storage should not be sown 
until late in the summer, the crop being harvested and 
stored in the same manner as turnips. Sugar beets 
are often substituted for the ordinary garden beet, 
especially for winter use. 

Beets are used for pickles, or are boiled, sliced, and 
fried in butter, adding a little vinegar just before re- 
moving from the fire. The young plants are used for 
greens. 



156 ADVICE TO THE HOUSEWIFE 

Borecole (See Kale) 
Brussels Sprouts 

This crop is closely related to cabbage and cauli- 
flower, and may be grown in the same manner. Instead 
of a single head, Brussels sprouts form a large number 
of small heads in the axils of the leaves. As the heads 
begin to crowd, the leaves should be broken from the 
stem of the plant to give them more room. A few leaves 
should be left at the top of the stem where the new 
heads are being formed. Brussels sprouts are more 
hardy than cabbage, and in mild climates may remain 
in the open ground all winter, the heads being removed 
as desired. For winter use in cold localities, take up 
plants that are well laden with heads and set them close 
together in a pit, cold frame, or cellar, with a little 
soil around the roots. The uses of Brussels sprouts 
are similar to those of cabbage, but they are con- 
sidered to be of a superior flavor. 

Bur Artichoke (See Artichoke, Globe) 

Cabbage 

For early spring cabbage in the South, sow the seeds 
* in an outdoor bed and transplant to the garden before 
January 1. In the North, plant the seeds in a hotbed 
during February and set the plants in the open ground 
as early as the soil can be worked. For a late crop in 
the North, plant the seeds in a bed in the open ground 
in May or June and transplant to the garden in July. 
Early cabbages require a rich, warm soil in order that 
they may mature early. For late cabbages the soil 
should be heavier and more retentive of moisture and 
not so rich as for the early crop, as the heads are liable 



THE HOME VEGETABLE GARDEN 167 

« 
to burst. Cabbages should be set in rows 30 to 36 

inches apart and 14 to 18 inches apart in the row. 
Where the plants are set out in the autumn and allowed 
to remain in the ground over winter, they are usually 
placed on top of ridges. Early cabbage must be used 
soon after it has formed solid heads, as it will not keep 
during hot weather. 

Late cabbage may be buried in pits or stored in cellars 
or specially constructed houses. The usual method 
of storing cabbage is to dig a trench about 18 inches 
deep and 3 feet wide and set the cabbage upright, 
with the heads close together and the roots bedded 
in soil. As cold weather comes on, the heads are cov- 
ered slightly with straw and then 3 or 4 inches of earth 
put on. Slight freezing does not injure cabbage, 
but it should not be subjected to repeated freezing and 
thawing. If stored in a cellar or building, the heads are 
generally cut from the stems and stored on slatted 
shelves or in shallow bins. While in storage, cabbage 
should be well ventilated land kept as cool as possible 
without freezing. 

Cantaloupe (See Melon — Muskmelon) 

Cardoon 

The cardoon is a thistle-like plant, very similar in 
appearance to the Globe artichoke, but is grown as an 
annual. The seeds are sown in early spring in a hot- 
bed or cold frame, and the plants transplanted later to 
the open ground. The cardoon should be planted in 
rows 3 feet apart and 18 inches apart in the row on 
rich soil, where it can secure plenty of moisture and 
make rapid growth. Toward autumn the leaves are 
drawn together, and the center blanched in the same 



158 ADVICE TO THE HOUSEWIFE 

manner as endive. If intended for winter ime, the 
leaves are not blanched in the garden, but the plants 
are lifted with considerable earth adhering to the roots 
and stored closely in a dark pit or cellar to blanch. 

The blanched leaf stems are used for making salads, 
soups, and stews. 

Carrot 

The culture of the carrot is practically the same as 
the parsnip, except that carrots are not thinned so 
much and are allowed to grow almost as thickly as 
planted. Carrots should be dug in the autumn and 
stored the same as parsnips or turnips. Any surplus 
can be fed sparingly to horses, mules, or cattle. 

The roots of the carrot are used at all times of the 
year, mostly in soups, but they may be boiled and served 
with butter, or creamed. 

Cauliflower 

GauUflower requires a rich, moist soil, and thrives best 
under irrigation. Cauliflower will not withstand as 
much frost as cabbage. The culture is the same as for 
cabbage until the heads begin to develop, after which 
the leaves may be tied together over the heads in 
order to exclude the light and keep the heads white. 

The tender heads of cauliflower are boiled and served 
with butter, or creamed, and are also used for pickling. 

Celeiiac 

A large-rooted form of celery used for cooking only. 
Cultivate the same as celery, but banking or blanching 
is not required. The roots may remain in the ground 
until wanted for use, provided a light covering be 
applied to prevent freezing. 



THE HOME VEGETABLE GARDEN 159 

C6l6ry 

For the North, sow the seed in a hotbed or cold frame 
and transplant to the open ground. Celery plants are 
generally improved by transplanting twice. In the 
South the plants are not started until late in the sum- 
mer and the crop is matured during the early winter. 
Celery seeds are very small and are slow in germinating, 
and the temperature of the seed bed should be kept 
low. The seed bed should be especially well prepared 
and the seeds should not be covered to a greater depth 
then I inch. Watering should be attended to very 
carefully and the bed should not dry out. After 
the plants are up, care should be taken that the bed 
does not become too wet and the plants damp off. 
Five hundred plants will be sufficient for the ordinary 
family, and they should be set 6 inches apart in rows 
3 to 5 feet apart. 

Celery requires a deep, rich, moist soil, with plenty 
of well-rotted barnyard manure or fertilizer and fre- 
quent shallow cultivation. In the garden, celery may 
be planted after some early crop, such as lettuce, 
radishes, peas, or beans. As soon as the plants attain 
considerable size the leaves should be drawn up and a 
Uttle soil compacted about the base of the plant to 
hold it upright. If the blanching is done with earth, 
oare shoiUd be taken that the hearts of the plants do 
not become filled. Boards, paper, drain tiles, or 
anything that will exclude the light may be used for 
blanching, but earthing up will produce the finest 
flavor. 

Celery may be kept for winter use by banking with 
earth and covering the tops by means of leaves or 
straw to keep it from freezing, or it may be dug and re- 



160 ADVICE TO THE HOUSEWIFE 

moved to a cellar, cold frame, vacant hotbed, or pit, 
and reset close together, with the roots bedded in 
earth. While in storage, celery should be kept as cool 
as possible without freezing. 

The blanched stems of celery are eaten in the raw 
state, and both the stems and enlarged roots are 
stewed and creamed. Celery seed is used for flavor- 
ing soups and pickles. 

For further information on celery read Farmers' 
Bulletin No. 148, entitled " Celery Culture." 

ChervU 

Under the name of chervil two distinct plants, known 
as salad chervil and the turnip-rooted chervil, are 
cultivated. The seeds of the salad chervil are sown in 
spring and the crop will thrive on any good garden 
soil. The seeds of the turnip-rooted chervil should 
be sown in the early autumn, but they will not ger- 
minate until the following spring. 

The edible part of this plant is the root, which some- 
what resembles the carrot and is used in the same man- 
ner. The leaves are used the same as parsley for gar- 
nishing and in flavoring soups. 

Chicory 

Chicory is grown for two or three purposes. The 
root of this plant is the common adulterant of coffee, 
and large quantities are used for this purpose. The 
commercial growing of chicory is confined to a few 
sections, as the crop will not thrive on every kind of 
soil. 

A deep, rich loam, without excessive amounts of clay 
or sand, is desirable, and soil that is not too rich in 



THE HOME VEGETABLE GARDEN 161 

nitrogenous matter is best suited to the production 
of roots. 

The roots of chicory are frequently placed in soil 
under a greenhouse bench or in a warm cellar and cov- 
ered with a foot or more of straw, or with a light 
covering of straw and then several inches of warm 
manure. Under this covering the leaves will be formed 
in a solid head, which is known on the market as 
witloof. 

Chicory has run wild in some parts of the country 
and is considered a bad weed. The handsome blue 
flowers of the chicory, which are borne the second sea- 
son, are very attractive. 

As a pot herb, chicory is used like spinach, but the 
leaves should be boiled in two waters to remove the 
bitter taste. As a salad the roots are dug in the autumn 
and planted in cellars or imder a greenhouse bench, 
where they produce an abundance of blanched leaves, 
which are eaten raw. The blanched leaves are also 
boiled and used as greens. 

Chive 

This is a small onion-like plant having flat, hollow 
leaves which are used for flavoring soups. The chive 
rarely forms seeds, and it is propagated by the bulbs, 
which grow in clusters. The leaves may be cut freely 
and are soon replaced by others. 

Cibol (See Onion) 

Citron 

The citron is a type of watermelon with solid flesh 
which is used for preserves and sweet pickles. The 
rind of the watermelon is frequently substituted for 



162 ADVICE TO THE HOUSEWIFE 

citron. The cultivation of the citron is the same as for 
the watermelon. 

Cive (See Chhre) 

CoUards 

The culture and uses of coUards are the same as for 
cabbage and kale. CoUards withstand the heat better 
than either cabbage or kale, and a type known as Geor- 
gia coUards is highly esteemed in the Southern States. 
CoUards do not form a true head, but instead a loose 
rosette of leaves, which, when blanched, are very 
tender and of delicate flavor. 

Com Salad 

Corn salad is also known as lamb's-lettuce and fetti- 
cus. Sow the seed during the early spring in driUs 
14 to 18 inches apart and cultivate the same as for 
lettuce or mustard. For an extra early crop the seed 
may be planted during the autumn and the plants 
covered Ughtly during the winter. In the Southern 
States the covering wiU not be necessary and the plants 
will be ready for use during February and March. 
The leaves are frequently used in their natural green 
state, but they may be blanched by covering the rows 
with anything that will exclude the light. Com salad 
is used as a salad in place of lettuce, or mixed with 
lettuce or water cress. The flavor of corn salad is 
very mild, and it is improved by mixing with some 
other salad plant for use. It is also boiled with 
mustard for greens. 

Corn, Sweet 

Plant sweet com as soon as the soil is warm in the 
spring, and make successive plantings every two weeks 



THE HOME VEGETABLE GARDEN 163 

until July, or the same result can be attained to some 
extent by a careful selection of early, medium, and 
late varieties. Plant the seeds in drills 3 feet apart 
and thin to a single stalk every 10 to 14 inches, or plant 
5 to 6 seeds in hills 3 feet apart each way, and thin out 
to 3 to 5 stalks in a hill. Cover the seeds about 2 
inches deep. Cultivate frequently and keep down all 
weeds, removing suckers from around the base of the 
stalk. 

Sweet corn should be planted on rich land, and the 
method of cultivation is practically the same as for 
field corn, but should be more thorough. There are 
a number of good early varieties, and for a midsummer 
and late sort there is none better then Stowell's Ever- 
green. 

Cress 

Under the name of cress there are two forms, the 
water cress and the upland cress. The upland cress, 
sometimes called peppergrass, is easily grown from seed 
sown in drills a foot apart. As the plants last but a 
short time, it will be necessary to make a sowing 
every few days if a continuous supply is desired. 

Water cress can be grown all the year in small open 
ditches containing running spring water. It is best 
and most easily produced in water from rather warm 
springs in limestone regions. A sufficient supply for 
family use can be grown in a small spring-fed brook, 
and the plants may be started either from small pieces 
of plants or from seed. Cress is used in salads, to 
which it imparts a pleasant pungency. 

CttCttxnber 

The soil for cucumbers should be a rich sandy loam, 
rather moist, but not wet. Plant in hills 4 feet apart 



164 ADVICE TO THE HOUSEWIFE 

each way as soon as all danger of frost is past. It is a 
good plan to work thoroughly a shovelful of well- 
rotted manure or a small handful of fertilizer into 
each hill in addition to the regular manuring of the 
land. The manure in the hill will give the plants a 
good start. Cuciunbers are frequently planted in 
drills about 7 feet apart and thinned to 12 or 18 inches 
apart in the row. If it is desirable to secure extra 
early cucumbers, the plants may be started in a hot- 
bed and transplanted to the garden by means of berry 
boxes. In the South, cucumbers are planted in the 
open ground as early as February or March. Cucum- 
ber seedlings are easily injured by cold, even where 
no frost occurs, and throughout the northern part of 
the country the planting should be deferred until the 
soil is warm. 

While young, the cucumber plants are frequently 
destroyed by a small beetle that attacks the lower 
part of the stem and the under side of the leaves. To 
preserve the plants some remedy will be necessary, 
and where only a few hills are grown for family use 
the beetles may be kept off by covering the plants with 
frames over which fly screen or mosquito netting has 
been stretched. Another method of protecting the 
plants is to set an arch of wire or one-half of a barrel 
hoop over the hill, and spread a piece of mosquito net- 
ting over this support. The edges of the netting may 
be laid down by covering with earth, and as soon as the 
plants are beyond danger of attack, the netting may be 
stored for future use. 

For further information on the protection of cucumber 
plants from the striped beetle see Circulars 31 and 59 
of the Bureau of Entomology. 

Cucumbers should receive frequent shallow cultiva- 



THE HOME VEGETABLE GARDEN 165 

tion until the vines begin to run freely; after this very 
little attention is required except to pull out stray 
weeds as they may appear. In order to keep the vines 
in good bearing condition, no fruit should be allowed 
to ripen, and when grown for pickles the fruits should 
all be removed while quite small. 

As cucumbers are subject to several diseases, the old 
vines and fruits should all be destroyed and the crop 
should not be planted two years in succession on the 
same land. As a rule garden cucumbers and melons 
will not be greatly injured by diseases. Full informa- 
tion on this subject can be secured by consulting 
Farmers' Bulletin No. 231, entitled " Spra3ring for 
Cucumber and Melon Diseases.'' 

Dandelion 

Sow the seed of dandelion in spring in drills 18 
inches apart, covering it i inch deep. Thin the 
plants to about 12 inches apart and give good clean 
cultivation throughout the summer. In the colder 
parts of the country it may be desirable to mulch 
slightly during the winter to prevent the plants heav- 
ing out of the soil. Early the following spring the 
plants will be ready for use as greens, but they are 
greatly improved if blanched by setting two boards in 
the form of an inverted letter V over the row. The 
blanching not only makes the leaves more tender but 
destroys a part of the bitter taste. Dandelion greens 
should be boiled in two waters to remove the bitter- 
ness. 

Eggplant 

The plants for this crop should be started and handled 
in the same manner as described for the tomato. 



166 ADVICE TO] THE HOUSEWIFE 

After the weather has become settled and the groiind 
quite warm, set the plants in the garden in rows 3 feet 
apart and 2 feet apart in the row. The soil best adapted 
to the production of eggplant is a fine, rich sandy loam; 
and it should be well drained. Cultivate freely and keep 
the plants growing rapidly. Many growers believe 
that fresh stable manure should not be used in connec- 
tion with the growing of eggplant and that the land 
should not contain unfermented vegetable matter 
to any extent. 

Eggplant is used in several wasrs, among which are 
the following: Peel and cut into slices } inch thick, 
soak in salt water 1 hour; boil until tender; then coat 
with rolled crackers or flour and fry in butter or fat. 
Another method is to steam or bake the eggplant 
whole and serve in the shell, the pulp being eaten 
with salt, pepper, and butter. 

Endive 

The endive is a form of chicory. Sow the seeda 
thinly in drills, and when the plants are well established 
thin to 8 inches. Water and cultivate thoroughly in 
order that a good growth of leaves may be made. 
When the leaves are 6 to 8 inches in length, draw them 
together and tie them so the heart will blanch. The 
leaves should not be tied up while wet, or decay will 
follow. The heads should be used as soon as blanched. 
For winter use, sow the seeds rather late and remove 
the plants, with a ball of earth adhering to the roots, 
to a cellar or cold frame, and blanch during the winter 
as required for use. 

Endive is used as a salad at times of the year when 
lettuce and similar crops are out of season.

Garlic 

Garlic is closely allied to the onion, but will remain 
in the ground from 1 year to another if undisturbed. 
Garlic is planted by setting the small bulbs, or cloves, 
either in the autumn or early spring. The culture is 
practically the same as for the onion. The bulbs are 
used for flavoring purposes. 

Georgia CoUards (See Collards) 

German Celery (See Celeriac) 

Ground Cherry (See Physalis)

Horse-radish 

Horse-radish will thrive best in a deep, rich soil, 
where there is plenty of moisture. The rows should 
be 3 feet apart and the plants 12 to 18 inches apart in 
the row. Tops cut from large roots or pieces of small 
roots are used for planting. A comparatively few 
hills of horse-radish will be sufficient for family use, 
and the roots required for starting can be secured of 
seedsmen for 25 or 30 cents a dozen. This crop will 
require no particular cultivation except to keep down 
the weeds, and is inclined to become a weed itself if 
not controlled. 

The large fleshy roots are prepared for use by peel- 
ing and grating. The grated root is treated with a 
little salt and vinegar and served as a relish with 
meats, oysters, etc. The roots should be dug during 



168 ADVICE TO THE HOUSEWIFE 

the winter or early spring before the leaves start. 
After being treated with salt and vinegar, the grated 
root may be bottled for summer use. 

Husk Tomato (See Physalis) 

Irish Potato (See Potato, Irish) 

Jerusalem Artichoke (See Artichoke, Jemsalem) 

Kale, or Borecole 

There are a large number of forms of kale, and 
these are thought by some to be the original type of the 
cabbage. Kale does not form a head and has con- 
voluted leaves and thick leaf stems. It is cultivated 
the same as cabbage, but may be set somewhat closer. 
This crop is very hardy and will live through the 
winter in the open ground in localities where freezing 
is not too severe. The flavor of kale is improved by 
frost. 

Kale is used for greens during the winter, and as a 
substitute for cabbage. 

Kohl-rabi 

Kohl-rabi belongs to the same class as cabbage and 
cauUflower, but presents a marked variation from either. 
It is, perhaps, half-way between the cabbage and tur- 
nip, in that its edible part consists of the swollen stem 
of the plant. For an early crop, plant and cultivate 
the same as for early cabbage. For a late crop or for 
all seasons in the South, the seed may be sown in drills 
where the crop is to be grown, and thinned to about 
8 inches apart in the row. The rows should be from 
18 to 36 inches apart, according to the kind of cultiva- 
tion employed. The fleshy stems should be used while 
they are young and quite tender. 



THE HOME VEGETABLE GARDEN 169 

Prepare kohl-rabi for the table in the same manner 
as turnips, which it very much resembles when cooked. 

Lamb's-Lettuce (See Com Salad) 

Leek 

This plant belongs to the same class as does the onion, 
but requires somewhat different treatment. Leeks 
can be grown on any good garden soil and are usually 
sown in a shallow trench. The plants should be thinned 
to stand about 4 inches apart in the row, and the 
cultivation should be similar to that for onions. After 
the plants have attained almost full size, the earth is 
drawn around them to the height of 6 or 8 inches to 
blanch the fieshy stem. The leek does not form a 
true bulb like the onion, but the stem is uniformly 
thick throughout. Leeks are marketed in bunches 
like young onions, and they may be stored the same 
as celery for winter. 

Leeks are used for flavoring purposes and are 
boiled and served with a cream dressing the same as 
young onions. 

Lettuce 

This crop attains its best development in a rich 
sandy loam in which there is plenty of organic matter. 
Lettuce thrives best during the early spring or late 
autumn and will not withstand the heat of sum- 
mer. In order that the leaves may be crisp and tender, 
it is necessary to force the growth. The usual method 
of growing lettuce for home use is to sow the seeds 
broadcast in a bed and remove the leaves from the 
plants as rapidly as they become large enough for 
use. A much better method is either to thin or trans- 
plant the seedlings and allow the plants to form 



170 ADVICE TO TEDS HOUSEWIFE 

rather compact heads and then cut the entire plant for 
use. 

In the Southern States, the seeds may be sown dur-< 
ing the autumn and the plants allowed to remain 
in the ground over winter. At the North, the seeds 
may be sown in & hotbed or cold frame and the seed- 
lings transplanted to the open ground, or the seeding 
may be in rows in the garden and the plants thinned 
to 5 or 6 inches in the row. Lettuce may be grown 
in rows about 12 inches apart. In order to produce 
crisp and tender lettuce during the summer months, 
it may be necessary to provide some form of partial 
shading. 

Melon — Moskmelon* 

A sandy loam with plenty of well-rotted barnyard 
manure will be found to be adapted to the cultivation 
of the muskmelon. When commercial fertilizer is 
used instead of manure, it should be applied at the 
rate of from 500 to 1,000 pounds of high-grade material 
to the acre. The muskmelon requires a long season 
to develop and is easily injured by frost or even by 
cool weather. 

For an early crop in the North, start the hills in a 
hotbed in berry boxes and plant out after the soil be- 
comes warm. For the main crop throughout the coun- 
try the seeds are planted in the open ground as soon as 
the soil is reasonably warm. Place the hills about 6 
feet apart each way, with 8 or 10 seeds in a hill. After 
the plants become established, thin out all but the four 
best ones. Another method is to sow in drills and thin 
to single plants 18 inches to 2 feet apart. Good culti- 
vation should be maintained until the vines interfere. 

Muskmelons are subject to a number of diseases, 



THE HOME VEGETABLE GARDEN 171 

and while the plants are quite young they are attacked 
by the cucumber beetle. The same precautionary 
measures as are recommended in the case of cucumbers 
should be observed for both troubles. 

There are a number of good varieties of muskmelons, 
and the Rocky Ford, or Netted Gem, is one of the best. 

Melon — Watermelon 

The cultivation of the watermelon is practically the 
same as for the muskmelon, except that the plants 
grow larger and require more room for development 
than those of the muskmelon. Watermelons require 
that the soil should contain a larger percentage of sand 
than muskmelons, and that the land should be quite 
rich. Watermelons should be planted 10 feet each way 
between the hills, or in drills 10 feet apart and thinned 
to 3 feet apart in the drills. The watermelon seed- 
lings must be protected from the cucumber beetle until 
the foUage becomes toughened. 

Multiplier Onion (See Onion) 

Muskmelon (See Melon — Muskmelon) 

Mustard 

Almost any good soil will produce a crop of mustard. 
The basal leaves of mustard are used for greens, and as 
the plants require but a short time to reach the proper 
stage for use, frequent sowings should be made. Sow 
the seeds thickly in drills as early as possible in the 
spring, or for late use sow the seeds in September or 
October. The forms of white mustard, of which the 
leaves are often curled and frilled, are generally used. 
Mustard greens are cooked like spinach. 



172 ADVICE TO THE HOUSEWIFE 

New Zealand Spinach 

The plant known as New Zealand spinack is not a true 
spinach, but grows much larger and should be planted 
in rows 3 feet apart, with the plants 12 to 18 inches 
apart in the row. Some difficulty may be experienced 
in getting the seeds to germinate, and they should be 
soaked 1 or 2 hours in hot water before planting. 
New Zealand spinach is satisfactory for growing in 
warm climates, as it withstands heat better than the 
ordinary spinach. The fleshy leaves and tender stems 
are cooked the same as spinach. 

Okra, or Gumbo 

Sow the seeds of okra in the open after the ground has 
become quite warm, or start the plants in berry boxes 
in a hotbed and transplant them to the garden after 
all danger of frost is past. The rows should be 4 feet 
apart for the dwarf sorts and 5 feet apart for the 
tall kinds, with the plants 2 feet apart in the row. 
Okra does best in rather rich land and requires frequent 
shallow cultivation until the plants cover the ground. 

The young pods are the part used, and these are em- 
ployed principally in soups, to which they impart a 
pleasant flavor and mucilaginous consistency. If the 
pods are removed from the plants and none allowed 
to ripen, the plants will continue to produce pods until 
killed by frost, but the best pods are grown on young 
plants. Okra pods can be dried or canned for winter 
use. 

For further information on okra, see Farmers' 
Bulletin No. 232, entitled ''Okra: Its Culture and 
Uses." 



THE HOME VEGETABLE GARDEN 173 

Onions 

A rich sandy loam containing plenty of humus is 
best suited to the production of onions. This crop 
has been grown very successfully on the muck beds of 
the States bordering on the Great Lakes. The usual 
plan on a small scale is to plant 1 or 2 quarts of '' sets '' 
in drills 12 to 18 inches apart and 2 to 3 inches apart 
in the row, covering about an inch deep. When a large 
acreage is to be grown the soil is made very fine and 
smooth and the onion seed is sown in drills and then 
thinned to 2 or 3 inches apart after the plants become 
estabhshed. For the best results from seed, sow in 
cold frames during the fall or in a hotbed in the early 
spring and transplant to the open ground as soon as 
the soil is in good condition to work. 

Onions require frequent shallow cultivation and it 
may be necessary to resort to hand work in order to 
keep the crop free from weeds. If it is desired to hasten 
the maturity of the bulbs by preventing continued 
growth of the tops, this may be accompUshed by roll- 
ing an empty barrel over the rows and breaking down 
the tops. After the tops are practically dead the onion 
bulbs should be removed from the soil and spread in 
a dry, well ventilated place to cure, after which they 
may be stored in crates or bags for winter use. 

There are several kinds of onions that may remain 
in the soil over winter. The MultipUer or Potato onion 
can be planted from sets in the autumn and will pro- 
duce excellent early green onions. This type of onion 
is peculiar in that a large onion contains a number of 
distinct hearts, and if planted will produce a number 
of small onions. On the other hand, a small onion 
contains but one heart and will produce a large onion. 



174 ADVICE TO THE HOUSEWIFE 

A few large onions should be planted each year to 
produce the sets for the following year's planting. 

Another variety is the Top or Tree onion, which 
produces a large number of bulblets above ground on 
the top of a stem. The small bulbs can be planted 
in the autumn and will produce onions the following 
season. 

The small onion, known as the shallot, is frequently 
planted in early spring for its small bulbs, or " cloves," 
which are used in the same manner as onions. The 
leaves are also used for flavoring. 

The cibol or Welsh onion is grown either from seeds 
or bulbs. Where the climate is not severe, the seed 
may be sown in the autumn, and the leaves, which are 
used for flavoring soups, will be ready for use in the 
spring. 

For additional information on the onion, see Farmers' 
Bulletin No, 39, entitled " Onion Culture." 

Oyster-plant (See Salsify) 

Parsley 

After soaking the seeds of parsley for a few hours 
in warm water, they may be sown in the same manner 
as celery seed and the plants transplanted to the open 
ground. At the North, parsley will live over winter 
in a cold frame or pit, and in the South it will thrive 
in the open ground during the winter, but it can not 
withstand the heat of summer. The plants should 
be set in rows 12 inches apart and every 4 inches in 
the row. 

The leaves of parsley are used for garnishings around 
meats and for flavoring soups. 



^THE HOME VEGETABLE GARDEN 176 

Parsnip 

Sow the seeds of parsnips as early as convenient in 
the spring in drills 18 inches to 3 feet apart* Thin the 
plants to stand 3 inches apart in the rows. The pars^ 
nip requires a rich soil and frequent cultivation. The 
roots can be dug late in the fall and stored in cellars or 
pits, or allowed to remain where grown and dug as 
required. for use. It is considered best to allow the 
roots to become frozen in the ground, as the freezing 
improves their flavor. As soon as the roots begin to 
grow the following spring they will no longer be fit for 
use. All roots not used during the winter should be 
dug and removed from the garden, as they will produce 
seed the second season and become of a weedy nature* 
When the parsnip has been allowed to run wild the root 
is considered to be poisonous. 

To prepare parsnip for the table, .boil the roots until 
tender and then cut in sUces and l)rown in butter. 
They may also be roasted with meat the same as pota- 
toes. 

Peas 

Garden peas require a rather rich and friable soil with 
good drainage in order that the first plantings may be 
made early in the spring. Fertilizers that are high 
in nitrogenous matter should not be apphed to the 
land immediately before planting, as they will have a 
tendency to produce too great growth of vines at the 
expense of pods. Land that has been well manured 
the previous year will be found satisfactory without 
additional fertilizer. A sandy loam is to be preferred 
for growing peas, but a good crop may be produced 
on clay soils; however, the pods will be a few days later 



176 ADVICE TO THE HOUSEWIFE 

in forming. Peas are easily grown and form one of the 
most palatable of garden products. 

The first plantings should be of such varieties as 
Alaska or Gradus, which make a small but quick 
growth, and may or may not be provided with sup- 
ports. The dwarf sorts like American Wonder come 
on later, require very Uttle care, and produce peas of 
fine quality. The tall-ferowing sorts of the Telephone 
type are desirable for still later use on account of 
their large production and excellent quality. Sugar 
peas have tender pods and if gathered very young the 
pods may be eaten in the same manner as snap beans. 
In order to maintain a continuous supply of fresh 
peas, plantings should be made every 10 days or 2 
weeks during the spring months, beginning as soon as 
the ground can be worked. In the extreme South peas 
may be grown during the entire winter. 

For the best results peas should be planted in the 
bottom of a furrow 6 inches in depth and the seeds 
covered with not more than 2 or 3 inches of soil. If 
the soil is heavy, the covering should be less than 
2 inches. After the plants attain a height of 4 or 5 
inches the soil should be worked in around them until 
the trench is filled. The rows for peas should be 3 
feet apart for the dwarf sorts and 4 feet apart for the 
tall kinds. A pint of seed will plant about 100 feet 
of single row. Many growers follow the practice of 
planting in a double row with a 6-inch space between. 
The double-row method is especially adapted for the 
varieties that require some form of support, as a trellis 
can be placed between the two rows. 

Brush stuck in the ground will answer for a support 
for the peas to cUmb upon. Three-foot poultry netting 
makes a desirable trelUs. If peas are planted for 



THE HOME VEGETABLE GARDEN 177 

autumn use, the earliest varieties should be em- 
ployed. 

Peppers 

Plant the seed of peppers in a hotbed, and transplant 
to the open ground as soon as it is warm, or sow the 
seeds in the garden after all danger of frost is past. 
When grown in the garden, the plants should be in rows 
3 feet apart and 15 to 18 inches apart in the row. 
The plants require about the same treatment as the 
tomato. There are a large number of varieties of the 
pepper, including the large sweet sorts used for pickling 
and the small hot kinds, such as Chili, Tabasco, and 
Cayenne. 

Peppergrass (See Cress) 

Physalls 

The physalis is also known as the ground-cherry or 
husk-tomato. Sow the seed in a hotbed or cold frame 
and transplant to the garden after danger of frost is 
past, or the seeds may be sown in the row where the 
plants are to remain and thinned to 12 or 18 inches. 
No particular care is required except to keep them free 
from weeds. There are a large number of varieties 
of the physalis, and the fruits vary in size and color. 
The variety commonly used in gardens produces a 
bright-yellow fruit, which is about the size of an ordi- 
nary cherry. Toward fall the fruits will drop to the 
ground and will be protected for some time by their 
husks. If gathered and placed in a cool place the fruits 
will keep for a long time. The physalis will self-sow 
and may become a weed, but it is easily controlled. 
A few of the volunteer plants may be Ufted in the spring, 
and placed in rows instead of making a special sowing 



178 ADVICE TO THE HOUSEWIFE 

of seed. Ten plants will produce all the husk-tomatoes 
desired by the average family. The fruits are excel- 
lent for making preserves and marmalade. 

Pie-plant (See Rhubarb) 

Potato, Irish 

A rich, sandy loam is best suited to the production 
of Irish potatoes, and the fertilizers employed should 
contain high percentages of potash. The main crop 
of Irish potatoes for family use should be grown else- 
where, but a small area of early ones properly belongs 
in the garden. The preparation of the soil should be 
the same as for general garden crops. 

Early potatoes should be planted as early in the spring 
as it is feasible to work the land, irrespective of locality. 
This will require planting in January in the extreme 
Southern States, and as late as May in the extreme 
Northern States. Late potatoes are extensively grown 
in the North, and the planting should be done late in 
May or during June. The rows should be 2J to 3 
feet apart, and the hills 14 to 18 inches apart in the row. 
Lay off the rows with a one-horse plow or lister, and 
drop the seed, one or two pieces in a place, in the 
bottom of the furrow. Cover the seed to a depth of 
about 4 inches, using a hoe or a one-horse plow for the 
pxurpose. One to three weeks will be required for the 
potatoes to come up, depending entirely upon the 
temperature of the soil. The ground may freeze 
slightly after the planting has been done, but so long 
as the frost does not reach the seed potatoes no harm 
will result, and growth will begin as soon as the soil 
becomes sufficiently warm. 

As soon as the potatoes appear above the ground 
and the rows can be followed, the sxurface soil should be 



THE HOME VEGETABLE GARDEN 179 

well stirred by means of one of the harrow-toothed 
cultivators. Good cultivation should be maintained 
throughout the growing season^ with occasional hand 
hoeingy if necessary, to keep the ground free from weeds. 
Toward the last the soil may be well worked up around 
the plants to hold them erect and protect the tubers 
from the sun after the vines begin to die. 

After digging the potatoes they should not be allowed 
to lie exposed to the sim or to any light while in storage, 
as they soon become green and unfit for table use. 
Early potatoes especially should not be stored in a damp 
place during the heated part of the summer, and 
will keep best if covered with straw in a cool, shady 
shed until the autumn weather sets in, after which 
they can be placed in a dry cellar or buried in the open 
ground. The ideal temperature for keeping Irish 
potatoes is between 36** and 40** F., but they will not 
withstand any freezing. 

Potato Onion (See Onion) 

Potato, Sweet 

The sweet potato is of a tropical nature and succeeds 
best in the warm, sandy loam soils of the Southern 
States. Sweet potatoes are, however, grown commer- 
cially as far north as the southern line of the State of 
Pennsylvania, and for family use even in southern New 
York and Michigan. A warm, loose sandy soil is best 
adapted to the production of sweet potatoes, and good 
drainage is essential. In order to improve the drainage 
conditions, it is customary to set the plants on top of 
ridges which are thrown up by means of a plow, two 
furrows being turned together. For best results the 
soil should be well fertilized throughout, but in com- 



180 ADVICE TO THE HOUSEWIFE 

mercial sweet potato culture the plan is frequently 
adopted of placing the fertilizer or manure in a furrow 
and then turning the ridge up over it. The manure 
should be evenly distributed, and it is advisable to 
run a cultivator once or twice in the furrow to mix 
the manure with the soil. Too much manure in one 
spot under the hill will produce a large growth of vine 
at the expense of the potatoes. 

Toward the northern part of the area over which 
sweet potatoes are grown it is necessary to start the 
plants in a hotbed in order that the length of season 
may be sufficient to mature the crop. The roots 
that are too small for marketing are used for seed, and 
these are bedded close together in the hotbed and cov- 
ered with about 2 inches of sand or fine soU, such as 
leaf mold. The seed should be bedded about 5 or 
6 weeks before it will be safe to set the plants in the 
open ground, which is usually about May 15 or May 20. 
Toward the last the hotbed should be ventilated very 
freely in order to harden oflf the plants. 

The ridges for planting sweet potatoes should be 3 
to 5 feet apart and the plants about 14 inches apart in 
the row. Cultivate sufficiently to keep the surface 
soil loose and free from weeds, and the vines will soon 
cover the ground, after which no cultivation will be 
necessary. In the warmer parts of the country the 
seed is not bedded, but is cut in small pieces and planted 
in the ridges instead of plants. After the plants come 
up and begin to make vines freely, pieces of the vines 
are removed and used as cuttings for planting addi- 
tional areas, the cuttings taking root and growing 
the same as plants grown from seed. In this manner 
3 and 4 plantings are made, the last being as late as the 
middle of July. If a rainy spell be selected for making 



THE HOME VEGETABLE GARDEN 181 

and planting the cuttings, very few will fail to grow, 
and an excellent crop may be produced. 

To the north, sweet potatoes are dug as soon as the 
vines are nipped by frost. In the South the potatoes 
are allowed to remain in the ground until a convenient 
time for handUng them, and in Florida or Texas they 
are frequently left until required for use. Sweet pota- 
toes should be dug on a bright, drying day when the 
soil is not too wet. On a small scale they may be dug 
with a spading fork, and great care should be taken that 
the roots do not become bruised or injured in the proc- 
ess of handling. It is desirable that the roots should 
lie exposed for 2 or 3 hours to dry thoroughly, after 
which they may be placed in a warm, well ventilated 
room td cure for several days. The proper temperature 
for curing sweet potatoes is from 80° to 90*^ F. and 
45° or 55° F. afterwards. A small crop may be cured 
around the kitchen stove, and later stored in a dry room 
where there will be no danger of their becoming too 
cold. Sweet potatoes should be handled as little as 
possible, especially after they have been cured. 

Sweet potatoes are used the same as Irish potatoes, 
and may also be employed in making pies the same as 
squash. For further information the reader should 
obtain Farmers' Bulletin No. 129, entitled " Sweet 
Potatoes." 

Pumpkin 

The true pumpkin is hardly to be considered as a 
garden crop, and, as a rule, should be planted among 
the field corn. Plant where the hills of corn are miss- 
ing and cultivate with the corn. 



182 ADVICE TO THE HOUSEWIFE 

Radish 

The radish is quite hardy and may be grown through- 
out the winter in hotbeds at the North, in cold frames 
in the latitude of Washington, and in the open groimd 
in the South. For the home garden the seed should 
be sown in the open ground as soon as the soil is mod- 
erately warm. Plant in drills 12 to 18 inches apart, 
and as soon as the plants are up, thin them slightly to 
prevent crowding. Radishes require to be grown on a 
quick, rich soil, and some of the earUer sorts can be 
matured in 2 to 3 weeks after planting. If the radishes 
grow slowly they will have a pungent flavor and will 
not be fit for table use. For a constant supply suc- 
cessive plantings should be made every 2 weeks, as 
the roots lose their crispness and delicate flavor if 
allowed to remain long in the open ground. As a rule a 
large percentage of radish seed will grow, and it is often 
possible by careful sowing to avoid the necessity of 
thinning, the first radishes being pulled as soon as 
they are of sufficient size for table use, thus making 
room for those that are a little later. Radishes will 
not endure hot weather and are suited to early spring 
and late autumn planting. 

There are a number of varieties of winter radishes, 
the seed of which may be planted the latter part of 
summer and the roots pulled and stored for winter use. 
These roots should remain in the ground as long as pos- 
sible without frosting and should then be dug and 
stored the same as turnips. This type of radish will 
not compare with the earlier summer varieties, which 
may be easily grown in a hotbed or cold frame during 
the winter. One ounce of radish seed is sufficient to 
plant 100 feet of row, and when grown on a large 



THE HOME VEGETABLE GARDEN 183 

scale 10 to 12 pounds of seed will be required to the 

acre. 

Rhubarb 

The soil for rhubard should be deep, and there is little 
danger of having it too rich. Like asparagus the seed- 
Ung plants of rhubarb can be grown and transplanted. 
Ten to twelve good hills are sufficient to produce all 
the rhubard required by the average family, and 
these are most easily estabUshed by planting pieces of 
roots taken from another bed. Good roots may be 
secured from dealers and seedsmen at about $1.50 a 
dozen. The old hills may be divided in the early 
spring or late fall by digging away the earth on one 
side and cutting the hill in two with a sharp spade, 
the part removed being used to estabHsh a new hill. 

The usual method of planting rhubarb is to set the 
plants in a single row along the garden fence, and the 
hills should be about 4 feet apart. If more than one 
row is planted the hills should be 3 J or 4 feet each way. 
The thick leaf stems are the part used, and none 
should be pulled from the plants the first year after 
setting. Rhubarb should receive the same treatment 
during winter as asparagus, and the plants should never 
be allowed to ripen seed. The roots may be brought 
into the greenhouse, pit, cold frame, or cellar during 
the winter and forced. Rhubarb does not thrive in 
warm climates. 

The use of rhubarb is principally during the early 
spring for making pies and sauces, and the stems 
may be canned for winter use. 

Rttta-baga 

The culture of the ruta-baga is the same as for the 
turnip, except that the former requires more room and a 



184 ADVICE TO THE HOUSEWIFE 

longer period for its growth. The roots are quite 
hardy and will withstand considerable frost. The ruta- 
baga is used like the turnip, and also for stock feed. 
Two pounds of seed are required for one acre. 

Salad Chervil (See Chervil) 

Salsify, or Vegetable Oyster 

Sow seeds of salsify during the spring in the same 
manner as for parsnips or carrots. At the South, a 
sowing may be made in summer to produce roots for 
winter use. One ounce of seed is required to plant 
100 feet of row, and on a large scale 10 pounds to the 
acre. After the plants are well established they should 
be thinned sufficiently to prevent their crowding. 
The cultivation should be the same as for parsnips 
or carrots, and frequent use of a wheel hoe will avoid 
the necessity for hand weeding. Salsify may be dug 
in the autumn and stored or allowed to remain in the 
ground during the winter, as its treatment is the same 
as for parsnips. Salsify is a biennial, and if the roots 
are not dug before the second season they will throw 
up stems and produce seed. It is of a weedy nature 
and care should be taken that it does run wild by seed^ 
ing freely. 

Salsify is deserving of more general cultivation, as it 
is one of the more desirable of the root crops for the 
garden. The uses of salsify are similar to those of the 
parsnip, and when boiled and afterwards coated with 
rolled crackers and fried in butter it has a decided oyster 
flavor, from which the name vegetable oyster is derived. 

Scallion (See Onion) 
Shallot (See Onion) 



THE HOME VEGETABLE GARDEN 185 

Spinach 

Spinach thrives in a rather cool climate and attains 
its best development in the Middle South, where it 
can be grown in the open ground during the winter. 
Large areas of spinach are grown near Norfolk, Va., 
cuttings being made at any time during the winter 
when the fields are not frozen or covered with snow. 
When the weather moderates in the early spring, the 
plants make a new growth, and a large crop of early 
greens is available. North of the latitude of Nor- 
folk, spinach can be planted in the autumn and carried 
over winter by mulching with straw or leaves. Sow 
the seeds of spinach in drills 1 foot apart at the rate of 
1 oimce to 100 feet of row or 10 to 12 pounds to the 
acre. To produce good spinach, a rich loam which 
will give the plants a quick growth is required. As 
ordinarily grown, spinach occupies the land during 
the autumn and winter only and does not interfere 
with summer cultivation. 

Spinach is an easily grown garden crop, and there is, 
perhaps, no other of its kind that will give as good 
satisfaction. Three or four ounces of seed, planted 
in the autumn after a summer crop has been harvested 
from the land, will produce an abundance of greens 
for the average family during the late autumn and early 
spring. In gathering spinach the entire plant is 
removed rather than merely cutting off the leaves. 
The larger plants are selected first, and the smaller 
or later ones are thus given room to develop. No 
thinning is required if this plan of harvesting is prac- 
ticed. 

Squash 

There are two types of the squash, the bush varie- 
ties, which may be planted in hills 4 or 5 feet apart 



186 ADVICE TO THE HOUSEWIFE 

each way, and the running varieties, which will require 
from 8 to 16 feet for their development. Squashes 
may properly be grown in the garden, as 3 or 4 hills 
will produce all that are required for family use. They 
require practically the same soil and cultural methods 
as the muskmelon. A number of varieties are used 
during the summer in the same manner as vegetable 
marrow, but squashes are principally used during the 
winter, in much the same way as pumpkins, to which 
they are superior in many respects. Squashes are also 
used extensively for pie purposes. The varieties known 
as Hubbard and Boston Marrow are most commonly 
grown. 

Squashes, like pumpkins, should be handled carefully 
to avoid bruising, and should be stored in a moderately 
warm but well ventilated room. 

Sweet Potato (See Potato, Sweet) 
Sweet Com (See Com, Sweet) 

Tomato 

At the North it is very desirable to start tomato 
plants in a house or in a hotbed, and transplant once 
or twice in order to secure strong, vigorous plants 
by the time all danger from frost has passed. In the 
South the plants are started in cold frames or in beds 
in the open ground and protected by cotton cloth dur- 
ing the cool weather. In the southern parts of Florida 
and Texas large fields of tomatoes are planted in the 
same manner as corn, by placing five or six seeds in a 
hill where the plants are to be grown. After the seed- 
lings become established, all but the two best are 
thinned out, and later but one is left in the hill. 

The tomato is one of the crops that can be hastened 



THE HOME VEGETABLE GARDEN 187 

to maturity by carefully growing the plants indoors 
and transplanting to the open ground. Pot-grown 
plants are especially desirable, and they may be brought 
to the blooming period by the time it is warm enough 
to plant them safely in the garden. If the plants are 
not to be trained, but allowed to lie on the ground, 
they should be set about 4 feet apart each way. If 
trimmed and tied to stakes, they may be planted in 
rows 3 feet apart, and 18 inches apart in the row. 

The tomato is one of the American vegetables that 
have come into general use during the past half century 
and it now forms one of the most important of our 
garden crops. The uses of the tomato are too numer- 
ous and too well known to require attention here. 
For complete information regarding this vegetable, 
read Farmers' Bulletin No. 220, entitled " Tomatoes.'* 

Top Onion (See Onion) 

Tree Onion (See Onion) 

Turnip 

The turnip requires a rich soil, and may be grown 
either as an early or a late crop. For an early crop, 
sow the seeds in drills 12 to 18 inches apart as early 
in the spring as the condition of the soil will permit. 
Two pounds of seed are required to plant an acre. 
After the plants appear, thin to about 3 inches. The 
roots will be ready for use before hot weather. For 
late turnips the seeds are usually sown broadcast on 
land from which some early crop has been removed, 
generally during July or August, but later in the South. 
Turnips are quite hardy and the roots need not be 
gathered until after several frosts. Turnips may be 
stored in a cellar or buried in a pit outside. Before 
storing, the tops should be removed.

VegetaUe Mexrow 

The so-called vegetable marrows are closely allied 
to the pumpkin, both as to species and habit of growth, 
the principal difiFerence being that the vegetable mar- 
rows are used while quite young and tender, and may 
be baked and served very much the same as sweet 
potatoes. The vegetable marrows should receive 
thorough cultivation in order that a tender product 
may be secured, and should be gathered while the 
outside skin is still so tender that it may easily be broken 
by the finger nail. The flesh is either boiled and 
mashed or baked in the oven and served with butter 
while hot.

HOME CANNING OF FRUITS AND VEGETABLES 

AS TAUGHT TO CANNING CLUB MEMBERS 
IN THE SOUTHERN STATES

Work in the South, States Relations Service 



INTRODUCTION 

Canning has become the most widely used and 
popular means of preserving large quantities of fruits 
and vegetables. The original form, flavor, color, and 
texture of fruits and succulent vegetables are retained 
to a greater degree by canning than by any other 
means. For this reason, certain delicately flavored 
vegetables are most attractive when canned. Another 
advantage is that canned foods are ready for almost 
immediate serving. It must be remembered that other 
means of preserving foods are very desirable, especially 
during the present season when conservation of all 
food products should be practiced. For example, 
legumes, like lima beans and peas, and root crops, 
like carrots and beets, while attractive when canned 

191 



192 ADVICE TO THE HOUSEWIFE 

in a succulent stage, are more nutritious and more 
economically stored when mature. Simimer cabbage, 
cauliflower, and cucumbers are better saved in brine 
than canned. Other vegetables also can be brined. 
Many vegetables, such as sweet com and green string 
beans, can be dried, and in this stage furnish variety 
and serve as a substitute for canned vegetables. If 
properly dried and stored these vegetables are at- 
tractive and wholesome. A publication (Farmers' Bui. 
841) dealing with drying may be obtained from the 
United States Department of Agriculture. 

This bulletin will deal wholly with methods for can- 
ning, preserving, and jelly making. The directions 
given are chiefly for those products which seem most 
worth preserving in these ways, and the methods are 
those which seem best suited to the products. 

Sterilization 

Cause of Spoilage 

Foods decompose or spoil because they are attacked 
by living germs, minute forms of plant Uf e of the lowest 
order. Three types of these tiny organisms cause foods 
to spoil, namely, molds, yeasts, and bacteria. These 
are present constantly everywhere, in air, water, and 
soil, and on food. All except molds are so minute as to 
be invisible without the aid of a microscope, and all 
exist in teeming millions. 

Molds are of first interest because the housekeeper is 
familiar with their appearance in the growing stage in 
which they attack foods, and even fabrics, causing 
rapid destruction. Molds thrive in dampness and dark- 
ness and prefer freedom from currents of air. They 
require oxygen, moisture, and warmth, and feed upon 



HOME CANNING OP FRUITS, ETC. 193 

sugar and starches. Since they can grow in the pres- 
ence of acids, fruit and tomatoes are readily attacked 
by them. The fruiting parts of molds bear spores 
which serve the same purpose as seeds of higher plants. 
These invisible spores are produced in such quantities 
as to be present in the air at all times, ready to develop 
upon any foods which are exposed. Molds are killed 
easily by moist heat. The practice of steriUzing foods 
in jars and seaUng immediately eUminates all trouble 
with mold. 

Yecists also must be controlled in canning. Yeasts 
are of many kinds, all one-celled plants, which repro- 
duce by budding, that is, by the growth of a bud on 
the edge of a cell. This bud quickly becomes full 
grown and breaks away from the mother cell. Some 
yeasts have another means of reproduction, that is, 
by the production of spores within the cell. 

The use of yeast in bread making is familiar. When 
suppUed with food (in the form of sugar), warmth, 
moisture, and air, yeasts grow, breaking up the sugar 
and producing alcohol and a gas called carbon dioxid. 
Bubbles of this gas are seen when canned fruits fer- 
ment. Since yeasts are abundant in the air and on the 
surface of fruits and vegetables, it is always necessary 
to destroy them on food being canned, to seal con- 
tainers air-tight, and to prevent further entrance 
of these organisms into the canned foods. Yeasts 
usually are killed by moist heat at 190** F. (simmering). 

Bacteria are much more difficult to destroy than 
molds and yeasts and are the chief foe to combat in 
all preserving of foods. They also are one-celled plants, 
smaller than yeasts, and usually reproduce by division. 
So rapid is this reproduction that a single bacterium 
may produce millions more in a few hours. Bacteria 



194 ADVICE TO THE HOUSEWIFE 

require for their growth warmth, moisture, and food. 
Certain species of bacteria thrive without air. Since 
few bacteria thrive in acids or in the presence of much 
ugar, their destruction is less difficult in fruits and 
tomatoes than in such vegetables as corn, peas, and 
beans or in meats, which are the most difficult of all 
foods to can safely. 

Bacteria in their active growing state can be killed 
by subjecting them to moist heat at boiling tempera- 
ture for different lengths of time. Unfortunately for 
the canner many kinds of bacteria have the power 
under adverse conditions of producing spores, which are 
much more resistant to heat than are the growing 
stages. These spores may be compared to the seeds 
of higher plants in their abiUty to withstand adverse 
conditions. It is known that some spores are able 
to resist boiling temperature for hours. All bacteria 
in the spore state can be destroyed by subjecting 
them to a temperature of 240° to 250® F., moist heat. 
This temperature can be secured only with steam 
under pressure. Almost all the bacteria which are 
80 resistant to heat when in the spore state are abun- 
dant in cultivated soil, and therefore present upon 
the pods and husks of such vegetables as corn, peas, 
and beans, which contain the food upon which the spore- 
bearing forms thrive. The presence of these bacteria 
upon the parts of vegetables to be canned, therefore, 
is almost inevitable. The difficulty of steriUzation is 
increasingly great when such vegetables have been 
bruised or allowed to stand, or have among them de- 
cayed portions. 

Emyms. Fruits and vegetables, after being gath- 
ered, undergo natural changes which cause staleness 
and injure the quality. These changes take place 



HOME CANNING OF FRUITS, ETC. 193 

with varying rapidity in different foods and are due 
to the action of substances known as enzyms, which 
have the power to cause ripening and other changes. 
The dehcate flavors of many fruits are thus destroyed 
when they are allowed to stand too long before being 
canned. 

Methods of Sterilization . 

The term steriUzation, when applied to canning, is 
used to cover the process of inclosing the food in cans 
or jars which afterwards can be sealed air-tight, and 
subjecting it to sufficient heat to kill all Uving organ- 
isms. To be effective, sterilization must be followed 
immediately by sealing the containers air-tight to 
prevent further entrance of molds, yeasts, or bacteria. 

Formerly a common household practice in canning 
(applied chiefly to fruits and tomatoes) consisted in 
cooking the material to be canned in an open kettle, 
transferring it, while boiUng hot, to hot sterilized 
jars, and at once sealing with a Ud which also had been 
sterilized. That this practice is uncertain is shown 
by the frequency with which a growth of mold appeared 
on the fruit canned in this way, causing loss. This 
method is objectionable not only because it so fre- 
quently results in insufficient steriUzation, but also 
because it gives a product of inferior quality. Its use 
is also attended by discomfort and inconvenience to the 
housekeeper who is forced to do most of the work 
indoors over a hot stove. Moreover, with the excep- 
tion of tomatoes, vegetables can not be canned by this 
method with the certainty that they will keep. For 
these reasons sterihzation of fruits and vegetables 
after being packed in containers has largely superseded 
the open-kettle method. 



196 ADVICE TO THE HOUSEWIFE 

Since certain vegetables are frequently attacked by 
spore-bearing bacteria^ a longer period of sterilization 
at boiling temperature is required for them than for 
fruits. Often they are sterilized by boiling 3 to 5 hours. 
The spores of some species of bacteria have been 
known to resist even 5 hours' boiling. Since this gives 
a chance for failure, the laboratory practice of inter- 
mittent or fractional sterilization is appUed to house- 
hold canning when a hot-water canner is used for proc- 
essing certain vegetables. Intermittent steriUzation 
consists of applying boiling temperature to vegetables 
already packed in containers for a period on each of 
three successive days, sealing the jar immediately after 
each boiling or ''processing" if the Ud has been 
loosened to allow for the expansion caused by heat. 
After each daily processing the containers are kept 
at ordinary temperature, under which the spores not 
killed by boiUng develop into bacteria of the easily- 
killed vegetative or growing state, which are then 
destroyed by the next period of boiling. Rarely do 
any spores fail thus to develop and be destroyed by 
the third processing. Processing for 1 hour in a water 
bath at boiling temperature on the first day, repeated 
on the second and third days, will ordinarily sterilize 
beans, peas, and corn in quart jars, if these vegetables 
are selected properly and handled carefully. The flavor 
of vegetables thus processed is finer than when they 
are subjected to high temperatures. This is the 
safest method to follow with hot-water canners. When 
a steam-pressure outfit is used, a higher temperature 
can be obtained and the period of steriUzation short^ 
ened, at the same time eliminating the uncertainty 
of securing complete sterilization. 



HOME CANNING OF FRUITS, ETC. 197 

Aids to Sterilization 

The first essential for complete sterilization with the 
use of either the hot-water canner or the steam-pressure 
outfit is absolute cleanliness in surroundings and in all 
utensils used in canning. Tables should be well cleaned 
and may be covered with white oilcloth. Garbage 
cans must be provided to hold peelings and other 
refuse. To allow these to fall upon the ground to 
decay near the place of canning will result in produc- 
tion of spores which wiU rise in dust and infect the mate- 
rial being canned. 

Greater safety will follow if containers and lids are 
sterilized by boiling for 15 minutes after being washed 
thoroughly. They should then be inverted on a clean 
surface until used. Cleanse rubbers by dropping for 
a minute into a boiling solution of soda and water 
(1 quart of water to 1 teaspoonful soda), removing from 
fire at once to prevent injury to them. 

Testing the Seal 

After fruits and vegetables are canned and set aside 
for 24 hours, lightning seal or hermetic jars may be 
tested by raising the clamp and attempting to Uft 
the jar by the lid. If the lid comes off, the jar is either 
not sealed or the food is fermenting. If the Ud remains 
tight, the chances are that its contents are keeping. 
Screw-top jars may be tested by simply inverting to 
see if there is any leak. Test all jars, so that when 
faulty sealing alone exists, jars may be reprocessed and 
contents saved. If the food is fermenting it should 
be discarded. However, the tight seal is not always 
an indication that the food is keeping. Some foods are 
often attacked by bacteria, which thrive without 



108 ADVICE TO THE HOUSEWIFE 

the presence of aor, and which decompose canned foods 
without producing any gas. When these have not 
been killed by processing^ the food may appear good 
and the jar remain sealed yet the contents be unfit 
for use. In tin these spoils are known as " flat sours *' 
because the can is not bulged and shows no indication 
of spoiUng. This kind of failure is more often due to 
canning stale vegetables. Fibers of stale vegetables 
become tough and heat will not penetrate them so 
easily. Therefore the period for steriUzation should 
be lengthened. 

Very often plants absorb from the soil or from fer- 
tilizers certain minerals that have a tendency to make 
the fibers of the plant more resistant to heat^ thereby 
necessitating a longer period of steriUzation in order 
to destroy all spores present. 

Equipment for Canning in the Home 

When canning in small quantities, it is not necessary 
to pwchase special equipment, although inexpensive 
portable equipment for use in or out of doors may be 
purchased. If considerable canning is done, such 
outfits will prove convenieirt and save labor. Espe- 
cially is this true when a comfortable out-of-door 
place can be selected for the work. 

The method of packing fruits and vegetables into 
containers and sterilizing the product after it is packed 
has superseded to a very large extent the old plan of 
cooking the food in an open kettle, transferring it 
hot to the jar, and sealing without any further steriliza- 
tion. Since this is true, the first consideration is a 
sterilizing vessel. This is sometimes caUed a processor. 
Cooking the food in the jar to sterilize it is known as 



HOME CANNING OF FRUITS, ETC. 19& 

processing. This cooker must be large enough to 
hold a convenient number of packed jars and must 
be fitted with a false bottom and a tight cover. A 
wash boiler, bucket, or galvanized tub can be used for a 
processor. It may be used on the kitchen stove or 
placed on a furnace built out of doors. One important 
factor is to be able to bring the water in this cooker 
quickly to the boiling point and maintain this tem- 
peratiu*e steadily. The false bottom is a rack which 
keeps the jars from coming in contact with the metal 
which is next to the frame. This prevents breakage. 
Racks made of strips of wood are probably the best. 
Sometimes wire netting, or perforated galvanized 
trays, are used. If the latter material is used, it 
should be raised about 1 inch or 2 inches above the 
bottom of the vessel. 

Types of Canners 

Hotr-water Canner, Several convenient types of 
portable canners are on the market. The simplest 
hot-water outfit is one to be placed on the kitchen 
stove. Another, more complete, has a fire box 
attached and is used out of doors. These outfits 
also include blanching trays, tongs for handling hot 
jars, a false bottom, and tools necessary for seaUng 
tin cans. The canner which has been described is 
commonly known as a water-bath canner. 

The type of canner should be chosen with reference 
to the kind and amoimt of canning to be done. The 
small hot-water canner is the least expensive of the 
commercial outfits for home canning. For inexperi- 
enced people it is also more easily handled. This 
type of canner is preferable for processing fruits and 
tomatoes. They are sterilized easily at boiling tern- 



200 ADVICE TO THE HOUSEWIFE 

perature and the texture, flavor, and color of the 
finished products, processed at this temperature, are 
superior to those which have been subjected to the 
higher temperatures. 

Water-seal Canner. Another type of canner is 
known as the water seal. The advantages of this type 
of canner are that only a small quantity of water is 
needed and it can be raised quickly to the boiling 
point with the use of very little fuel. A steady tem- 
perature also can be maintained easily. When the 
Ud is in place a sUght pressure is secured and this makes 
it possible to maintain a temperature 2® or 3** higher 
than the boiHng point. 

In this bulletin no separate time-table for processing 
in the water-seal canner is given, because the differ- 
ence in temperature obtained in the two types of canner 
is not sufficient to warrant a close distinction in length 
of processing periods. 

Steamr-pressure Canner. The steam canner is con- 
structed out of strong material and provided with a 
tightly fitting Ud, which when clamped in place makes 
it possible to hold steam under pressiu'e and obtain 
a correspondingly high temperature. It has a steam 
gauge and thermometer attached to the lid. These 
attachments register the temperature and the corre- 
sponding number of pounds pressure. Since the stean 
canner is made of very heavy material, a grec.t,er 
degree of heat is required to bring up the temperature 
quickly. 

When large quantities of vegetables such as beans, 
peas, corn, etc., are to be canned, much time, labor, 
and fuel can be saved if the steam-pressure outfit is 
used. These vegetables, if processed in a water bath, 
need to be cooked either continuously for a long period 



HOME CANNING OF FRUITS, ETC. 201 

or intermittently. When a higher temperature is 
retained during the processing^ the length of time may 
be considerably shortened. 

Convenient Utensils 

Whether a homemade or commercial canner is 
used it is necessary to assemble certain utensils which 
are found ordinarily in every home. For grading, 
sorting, and washing, shallow trays, pans, or bowls, 
and vegetable brushes are needed. In washing berries 
a colander or sieve should be used. For blanching, 
squares of cheese-cloth or a wire basket, together with 
a large vessel for holding the boiling water, should be 
provided. This vessel should be deep enough to 
submerge a convenient quantity of the products to be 
blanched. Slender-pointed knives are convenient for 
peeUng, paring, and cutting. It is much better to use 
a silver knife for peeling fruits, as the fruit some- 
times is discolored by steel.' When canning in large 
quantities, slicers, corers, pitters, and food choppers 
will make it possible for one to work more rapidly. 
A half-pint measuring cup, teaspoon, tablespoon, 
spatula, scales, salt per cent scale, and saccharometer 
will aid in securing accurate results. If the product 
to be packed is to be cooked, wooden spoons, sieves, 
and saucepans are necessary. Packing paddles and 
sirup paddles will aid in filling the jars. If the can- 
ning is to be done out of doors, tables of convenient 
height, a covered garbage pail, and a flytrap are needed. 
The most convenient portable canners contain both 
processing and blanching compartments. A kerosene 
stove which burns a gas flame gives intense heat and 
is convenient for use in jelly making, preserving, and 
concentrating ketchups and sauces. 



202 ADVICE TO THE HOUSEWIFE 



Containers 

For home use, glass jars are more economical than 
tin, because they can be used many times and with 
care will last for years. New rubbers must be used 
each year, and it pays to get the best quaUty of red 
rubbers. 

The best type of jar for home use is one with the so- 
called Ughtning seal, having a glass hd held in place 
by a wire clamp. This Ud is not only more sanitary, 
but with care can be used as long as the jar lasts. For 
intermittent processing the Ughtning-seal jars are 
suitable, because the Ufting of the wire clamp each day 
during processing insures that the jar will not be broken 
by expansion and the rubber not worn by the unscrew- 
ing of the cap. 

Another type is the hermetic seal, with a lacquered 
metal top. The top has around the inner edge a 
narrow gasket of composition which, when heated, 
softens and adheres to the glass. The top is held in 
place during the processing by a wire clamp. It is 
fielf-seaUng as it cools and is not suitable for intermit- 
tent processing. 

If the old-fashioned screw-top jar is used good caps 
are essential for safety. After having been used the 
edge of this cap becomes flared and the porcelain 
lining frequently is loosened from the top. This lid 
then not only is difficult to steriUze but may fail to 
give an air-tight seal. If such jars are on hand and 
must be used it will be better to use them for the 
canning of fruits, preserves, and other products easily 
steriUzed and to secure jars of the lightning-seal type 
for vegetables which are more difficult to sterilize. 



HOME CANNING OF FRUITS, ETC. 203 

Anangement of Equipment 

Discomfort and fatigue can be lessened greatly by 
careful planning of the arrangement of equipment used 
in canning. When working indoors it is often possible 
to -carry on much of the preparation of fruits and 
vegetables on the porch, thus minimizing the work of 
clearing away refuse afterward. Canning is a much 
more attractive work when it is done in a cool, shady, 
outdoor place free from dust. This is especially true 
when several members of the family or a group of club 
members are working together. It is well to have two 
tables so the different stages of the work may be kept 
distinct. On the first table, for instance, may be 
placed vessels for sorting and grading, a supply of 
fresh cold water for washing the fruit, and a blanching 
basket or squares of cheese-cloth. On the second 
table place paring knives, spoons, measuring cups, 
scales, wooden paddles, sirup, brine, or seasoning, 
fresh clean cloths, and bowls or pans. Use this table 
for peeling and packing and place the garbage can 
near it. When jars have been sterilized they may be 
brought in trays to this table, inverted on a clean 
surface, and covered until needed. The canner should 
be placed so as to be convenient to both tables and 
should be provided with stovepipe high enough to 
convey the smoke above the heads of the workers. 

Management of Steam-pressure Canner. In the bot- 
tom of the steam-pressure canner (retort) pour boiling 
water to a depth of from 1 to 1| inches. Place canner 
over the fire so that the water can boil vigorously. 
Put cans in the crate, and lower this into retort. Put 
on the cover and screw down clamps so cover is on 
steam tight. Turn pet cock so steam can not escape 



204 ADVICE TO THE HOUSEWIFE 

and adjust safety valve to the number of pounds steam 
pressure desired. Raise temperature by quick fire 
until the gauge on cover of retort shows the desired 
steam pressure. Then open safety valve or pet cock 
a little in order to let dead steam escape. Partly close 
again so only a very small amoimt of steam can escape, 
but do not close entirely. Coimt time from the 
moment steam pressure in canner reaches the pres- 
sure desired. Keep a steady fire going in order to 
maintain a uniform temperature until time is up. 
Then open pet cock or safety valve to let all steam 
escape before unfastening the clamps or screws holding 
lid down. When the gauge shows that all steam has 
escaped, unfasten the clamps, take oiBf the cover, and 
lift the crate out. When processing in glass it is im- 
portant to cool the retort somewhat before removing 
the containers in order to prevent loss of Uquid from 
them. As soon as the jars are taken from the canner 
the lids should be tightened and a cloth spread over the 
jars, to protect from drafts of air, until cold. If cans 
are used, test for leaks by immersing in cold water. If 
any are found, cans must be resoldered and again proc- 
essed in canner. 

Canning in Glass 

Select jars which are appropriate for the fruit or 
vegetable to be packed, considering the size of the con- 
tainer from the standpoint of the quantity desired when 
opened, the size of the fruit or pieces of fruit to be 
packed, and the ease of steriUzation. 

Sterilizing Jars. Wash these jars and place them, 
side down, in a vessel and cover with cold water. Bring 
this water slowly to the boiling point and aUow to 
boil for 15 minutes to sterilize the jars. 



HOME CANNING OF FRUITS, ETC. 205 

Sorting and Grading. While the jars are being 
sterilized, sort and grade the fruit or vegetables accord- 
ing to size and degree of maturity. Discard all fruit 
that is overripe, underripe, or unsound. Vegetables 
which are in choice condition for the table — that is, 
young, tender, and fresh — ^are suitable also for canning. 
Those which have become stale are more di£G[cult to 
steriUze and the loss of flavor and deterioration in 
texture resulting from staleness make them unsuitable 
for canning. 

Following the sorting and grading, thorough wash- 
ing is necessary before proceeding to paring, coring, 
or slicing. Some fruits and vegetables require scald- 
ing in order to remove peeling. 

Blanching. Blanching consists of plunging the vege- 
table or fruit into boiUng water for a short time. 
Use a wire basket or cheese-cloth square for this. 
The blanch gives a more thorough cleansing, improves 
the texture, and insures a clearer liquor. Jt also 
shrinks the fruit or vegetable and makes it more 
flexible. A full pack is then made more easily. The 
time required for blanching varies with the state of 
maturity. (See time-table, pp. 225, 226.) After blanch- 
ing the fruit or vetegable is placed for an instant into 
cold water to make more crisp and to aid further in 
shrinking. 

Packing. After selecting fruit or vegetable for 
uniformity in size and quality it should be arranged 
with reference to symmetry and the best use of the 
space within the jar. In placing the fruit or vege- 
table in a jar a thin, slender, flexible paddle, made out 
of cane or other suitable wood, is useful. 

When the jar has been packed as full as possible 
without crushing the pieces the sirup, brine, or season- 



206 "^ ADVICE TO THE HOUSEWIFE 

ing is added. The paddle is also used to take out 
bubbles of air after the liquor has been added to the 
pack. 

Adjusting the Rvbber and Cap. Immediately before 
using, cleanse the rubber by dropping, for a minute, 
into a soda bath (1 tsp. soda to 1 qt. boiling water). 
Flatten the rubber in its groove, without the presence of 
any seed or particle of the fruit, before placing the cap. 
When a screw-top jar is used, screw the cap evenly 
about halfway. When a glass-top jar with wire clamp 
is used, place the lid on evenly and raise both clamps 
up, the upper one fastened to hold the lid in place. 
With a hermetic jar, fasten the cap on the jar evenly 
with the clamp. This type of jar is self-sealing as it 
cools. 

Processing. Place the jars in a water bath on a 
rack (a wooden rack is good) to avoid breaking. Have 
the water the same temperature as the contents, let-* 
ting it come to within 2 inches of the tops of the jars. 
Have a tight cover for the vessel to keep the steam 
around the tops of the jars which are above water. 
Do not count time until the water begins to boil; keep 
it boiling steadily for the time required. Seal the 
jars air-tight promptly at end of processing and remove 
them from the bath, being careful not to allow a cold 
draft to strike them. In intermittent processing, raise 
the clamps of the jars at the beginning of each process- 
ing to allow for expansion. Seal at close of each pro- 
cessing. The hermetic jar can not be used for intermit- 
tent processing. 

Storing. Before storing allow jars to stand for 12 
hours or more. Then examine the seal. With a light- 
ning seal or hermetic closure, take off the clamp and 
test the lid to see if it is tight. With a screw-top 



HOME CANNING OF FRUITS, ETC. 207 

jar, simply invert the jar to see if there is any leak. 
Btore all products in a cool, dry, dark place. 

Sirups. In canning fruits the use of the sirups indi- 
cated in the table will give excellent jresults. These 
sirups have been selected with reference to securing 
good color, texture, and flavor in the finished product. 
For instance, sour fruits, such as cherries and plums, 
require a heavier sirup than sweet cherries, peaches, or 
berries. These sirups range in density from 10® to 
50® as measiu*ed by a Balling saccharometer. The 
table is prepared to enable one to secure uniform results 
without the use of a saccharometer. No. 1 sirup is 
of 10® density. No. 2 of 20® density, and so on. 

To make these sirups boil sugar and water together 
in the proportion given below until sugar is dissolved. 
Strain all impurities out of the sirup before using: 

Sirup No. 1, use 14 ounces sugar to 1 gallon water. 
Sirup No. 2, use 1 pound 14 ounces sugar to 1 gallon water. 
Sirup No. 3, use 3 pounds 9 ounces sugar to 1 gallon water. 
Sirup No. 4, use 5 pounds 8 ounces sugar to 1 gallon water. 
Sirup No. 5, use 6 pounds 13 ounces sugar to 1 gallon water. 

Measurements. If no scales are available, the 
amounts of sugar may be approximated by measur- 
ing, using 1 pint for each pound and 16 tablespoons 
to the half pint. For the recipes given in this bulletin 
all measurements are level and the standard measur- 
ing cup holding i pint is used. Abbreviations used 
are c, cup; tbsp., tablespoon; tsp., teaspoon; oz., 
ounce; and lb., pound. 

Fruits 

The temperature obtained in a hot-water bath can- 
ner is the best to use in canning fruits. The time for 



208 ADVICE TO THE HOUSEWIFE 

processing, given in each recipe which follows, is 
intended for this water-bath outfit with temperature 
at boiUng, and should not be counted until boiling 
begins. 

Apples. Apples shrink more in canning than most 
fruits and for this reason should be blanched for 1 
minute. Plunge them into a cold bath, then pack. 
Cover with No. 1 sirup, and process quart jars 12 
minutes. 

This method of canning apples is not economical 
because the apple is juicy and needs no water added. 
A better method perhaps is to make a sauce out of the 
apples. This may be done by steaming them until 
tender and passing them through a sieve. Allow 1 c. 
sugar to each gallon of pulp. Reheat until the sugar 
is dissolved, pack hot in sterihzed jars, and process quart 
jars 12 minutes. 

Berries. For dewberries, blackberries, loganberries, 
huckleberries, raspberries, and currants practically 
the same methods of canning may be used. The 
condition of the fruit will have much to do with the 
quaUty of the product. Berries should be gathered 
in shallow trays or baskets and not in deep vessels 
which allow them to be bruised and crushed. They 
should be uniformly ripe, sound, and as large as 
possible. 

The flavor of canned berries will be finer if sugar is 
used in canning. It is best to make this into a sirup. 
The use of berry juice instead of water in this sirup 
will give a richer color and flavor. For fine berries, 
use a No. 3 sirup, substituting berry juice for water. 

After the berries have been sorted carefully and 
washed Hghtly by placing in a colander and pouring 
water over them, instead of immersing them in water, 



HOME CANNING OF FRUITS, ETC. 209 

pack as closely as possible without crushing. This 
can be done better by putting a few berries into the 
jar, pressing them gently into place, and proceeding 
layer by layer, than by nearly filling the jar loosely and 
then trying to press them down. 

Fill jars full of fruit and cover with sirup. ' Process 
pints 10 minutes and quarts 12 minutes. 

Cherries. When canned whole, cherries should be 
blanched for 15 seconds to prevent spUtting. For 
sour cherries use No. 4 sirup; and for sweet ones No. 3. 
Process quarts 25 minutes. 

Figs. Figs for canning should be sound and firm. 
Sprinkle 1 c. of soda over 6 quarts of figs and add 
1 gallon of boiling water. Allow the figs to stand in the 
soda bath for 5 minutes. Drain and rinse thoroughly. 
Bring 2 quarts of the No. 3 sirup to boiling and add the 
well-drained figs. Allow the fruit to boil in this sirup 
for 1 hom*. Place the fruit carefully in the jars and 
then fill to overflowing with the sirup. Process quart 
jars for 30 minutes. 

Gooseberries. Since green gooseberries contain suf- 
ficient acid to preserve them without sterilizing, they 
may be packed, like rhubarb, in cold water or as a 
sauce. 

Make the sauce by cooking together the sugar and 
fruit in the proportion of J c. of sugar for each quart 
of gooseberry pulp. When the sugar is dissolved, 
pack the sauce hot and process for 10 minutes. Ripe 
gooseberries are oacked in a No. 3 sirup and processed 
as other berries. 

Guava. Only firm, sound guavas should be used for 
canning. Pare the fruit, cut into halves, and remove 
the seeds. Float the halves in boiUng water for 20 
seconds. Drain and pack carefully as for peaches. 



210 JADVICE TO THE HOUSEWIFE 

Fill the jars to overflowing with No. 4 sirup and process 
quarts for 25 minutes. 

Peaches. Before preparing fruit make sirup No. 3 
or 4 (see sirup table), allowing about 1 c. of water for 
each quart jar. Put in one cracked peach pit for e very- 
quart of sirup. Boil for 5 minutes and strain. 

Sort the fruit, using firm, sound, uniform peaches for 
canning and putting aside the soft broken ones for 
jam. Peeling may be done by immersing in boiling 
water about 1 minute or until skins slip easily. Re- 
move, plunge for a minute into cold water, and slip off 
the skins. Cut into halves and pack at once, placing 
the halves in overlapping layers, the concave surface 
of each half being downward and the blossom end 
facing the glass. FiU each jar with sirup and paddle 
carefully to remove air bubbles. Process quarts 20 
minutes and half gallons 35 minutes. 

Firm, perfect peaches may be floated in boiling water 
for about 20 seconds after being peeled. They are 
then cut in halves, seeds removed, and packed as 
indicated above. By floating the peaches in this 
manner, they are made more flexible and pack to better 
advantage; they also become mellow, absorb more 
sirup, and are finer in flavor. 

Pears. Select ripe pears which are not too soft. 
Peel, blanch by lowering for 15 seconds in boiling water, 
put in cold bath, drain, and pack rapidly This blanch 
will make the hard varieties of pears pack better and 
give them a more transparent appearance. When 
packed whole, leave stems on and place each layer 
stems up, letting the second row fill the spaces between 
the two stems, and repeat. 

When the jars have been packed with fruit, fill 
with No. 3 sirup and process quarts for 25 minutes. 



HOME CANNING OF FRUITS, ETC. 211 

Plums. Select sound, uniform fruit. Prick with 
needle to prevent bursting. Pack as firmly into the 
jars as possible without crushing and fill with a No. 4 
sirup. Process quarts for 15 minutes. 

Rhubarb. Because of its extreme acidity, rhubarb 
can be canned safely without processing. Select young, 
tender rhubarb and cut either into 24nch pieces or 
into lengths to fit the jar when placed vertically. Pack 
in sterilized jars in vertical rows. Cover with fresh 
cold water and allow jars to stand 10 minutes. Drain 
oflf the water and again fill to overflowing with fresh 
cold water. Use steriUzed rubber, cap and seal at 
once. In the far South rhubarb should be processed 
in a hot-water bath, pints 10 minutes, quarts 20 min- 
utes, at boiling. 

Since rhubarb contains much water, a better and 
more economical product could be secured by canning 
rhubarb sauce. Cut the rhubarb into 1-inch lengths 
and steam until tender. For each quart of sauce 
add I c. of sugar. Pack hot in sterilized jars and proc- 
ess quarts for 10 minutes. 

Fruit Juices. The juices of such fruits as grapes, 
currants, blackberries, strawberries, raspberries, elder- 
berries, and cherries make a deUcious and wholesome 
drink, and should be much more widely used in the 
home. The flavor of these juices is finer when they are 
steriUzed below the boihng point. Select sound ripe 
fruit, crush, and heat slowly to about 180° F., simmer- 
ing point. Strain through double thickness of cheese 
cloth, and if juices free from sediment are wanted, 
let stand in a cool place for a few hours. Then pour 
off carefully to free from the dregs, which will remain 
in bottom of vessel. The addition of sugar will make 
flavor finer. It may be used in any desired proportion. 



212 ADVICE TO THE HOUSEWIFE" 

a fair allowance being 1 c. of sugar to 1 gallon of juice. 
It is more economical to sweeten some fruit juice with 
the natural sirup obtained from the same fruit — for 
example, apple and grape. Pour the juice into steril- 
ized bottles, put steriUzed stoppers in Ughtly, set 
bottles on rack in water bath, and process at simmer- 
ing point for 30 minutes. Remove from water bath, 
put stoppers in tightly, and when cool dip top of bottle 
into melted parafhn or sealing wax. A good wax 
may be made by melting together equal parts of 
rosin and beeswax. 

These homemade fruit juices will be excellent for use 
in gelatin desserts, puddings, sauces, ice cream, sher- 
bet, etc. They can be bottled without any sugar 
and later made into jelly. This method for grape 
jelly insures the getting rid of crystals, _which are 
objectionable in jelly./ 

Vegetables! 

Either the water bath or the steam-pressure canner 
may be used in processing vegetables. For certain 
vegetables that are difficult to steriHze, there is an 
advantage in the saving of time, labor, and fuel by 
the use of a steam-pressure canner. The temperatures 
in the following recipes are given in Fahrenheit read- 
ings, because this thermometer ordinarily is furnished 
with steam-pressure outfits. The time given for 
processing under steam is for one continuous period. 
In canning vegetables that have become somewhat 
stale, the period of processing should be lengthened. 
(See time-table.) 

Brining and Seasoning. Brine or water is added, 
immediately after packing, to such vegetables as need

I 

to be surrounded by liquid either for proper prepara- 
tion or for sterilization. No more liquid is allowed 
than is actually necessary to cover the contents after 
as full a pack as possible is made. For seasoning 
tomatoes, peas, lima beans, and corn, a mixture of 
sugar and salt is added. This seasoning improves 
the flavor of these vegetables greatly. Mix the sugar 
and salt in the proportion of one-third salt and two- 
thirds sugar. Add the seasoning at the rate of 1 level 
tsp. for each pint of vegetables. Brine for beans, 
okra, etc., should contain 2 J oz. salt to 1 gallon of 
water. For asparagus a heavier brine is needed. 

Asparagiis. It is of the greatest importance that 
asparagus for canning be fresh and tender. Select 
tips of uniform size and niaturity and wash them. 
Cut in right length for cans, scrape oflf tough outer 
skin, and tie in bundles. Blanch by immersing the 
lower ends part way in boiUng water for 2 minutes. 
Then immerse the entire tips for 1 to 2 minutes longer. 
Plunge into cold water, then pack neatly, tips up. 
Fill jars with brine (4i oz. salt to 1 gallon water) 
and process pints in a hot-water bath 1 hour on each 
of three successive days or in a steam-pressure canner 
30 minutes imder 10 lbs. steam, at a temperature of 
240® F. In the far South it may be necessary to raise 
the temperature to 250*^ F. for the same period. 

String Beans, The Refugee is a good variety for 
canning. The beans should be tender and fresh. 
When the beans within the pod have grown to any size, 
canning is more difficult and the product of poorer 
quaUty from a commercial standpoint. For canning, 
only well-sorted, small, tender beans should be used. 
String the beans and cut them into 2-inch lengths; 
cutting diagonally or " on the bias '' gives a pretty 



214 ADVICE TO THE HOUSEWIFE 

product. In glass they may be canned whole, packed 
log-cabin fashion in square jars. Blanch 3 to 8 
minutes or imtil the pod will bend without breaking, 
and plunge into cold water for an instant. Drain 
well, pack quickly, and cover with brine. When the 
beans are young and tender, process quarts 2 hours 
continuously at boiling temperature, or, if more mature 
beans are packed, process intermittently, or 45 minutes 
under 10 lbs. steam, at a temperatiu-e of 240° F. 

Lima beans are treated as string beans, except that 
sugar and salt seasoning are added instead of brine. 
This seasoning is added when the jar is half packed 
with beans. When the jar is filled with beans, cover 
them with clear water, paddle to remove air bubbles, 
and process as for peas. 

Baby Beets. The best variety of beet for canning 
is the Detroit. From the standpoint of quaUty, 
only young, tender beets should be canned. Sort, 
putting uniform size together. In preparing beets 
for boiling, be careful not to cut the stems oflf too closely 
or to break the root. This will cause loss of juice 
with accompanying loss of color and flavor. Boil 
until three-fourths done, peel, pack in layers of three 
or four, fitting the second layer into the spaces left by 
the first layer, and repeat. Cover with clear hot 
water. Process quart jars 1 hour at 212*^ F. or 30 min- 
utes under 5 lbs. steam. Do not allow cold water to 
touch the beets after they have been cooked. 

Carrots. Proceed the same as for beets. 

Corn. Much depends upon careful selection of 
tender, juicy corn before it reaches a starchy stage. 
It should never stand longer than a few minutes after 
being taken from the stalk. Corn which has passed 
the milky stage or is stale is very difficult to sterilize. 



HOME CANNING OF FRUITS, ETC. 215 

Blanch on the cob 1 to 3 minutes. Cut; pack into 
jars to within 1-inch of the top. Add salt and sugar 
seasoning and cover with clear water. Paddle to allow 
liquor to penetrate to the bottom of the jar. Process 
quarts at 212** F. intermittently for Ij hours on the 
first day and 1 hour on the two succeeding days, rais- 
ing the clamp during each processing. Corn expands 
in cooking and jars may be broken unless Uds are 
loosened during processing. For pints, let the period 
of processing be 1 hour each time. With steam under 
pressure, process corn 1 hour and 20 minutes under 15 
lbs. pressure at a temperature of 250** F. Take every 
precaution to have good rubbers. 

Okra. Select young, tender pods, remove stem 
without cutting into seed pod. Blanch 6 to 8 minutes. 
Plunge into cold salt bath as for peas. Pack, cover 
with brine, and process intermittently, or 30 minutes 
under 10 lbs. steam pressure. 

Pe€L8. Peas are more difficult to can than most 
other vegetables, and great care should be taken to 
have them very fresh and young. They are best 
gathered in the early morning or when cool. Work 
should be done rapidly, and peas should not stand 
after being shelled. Shell and sort, putting peas of 
the same size and degree of maturity together. Be 
sure not to use hard ripe peas among tender ones. 

Blanching is very important. If well done it pre- 
vents cloudy Uquor, makes the peas tender, and also 
removes some of the gluey substance which coats 
them. Blanch 1 to 4 minutes, depending upon the 
maturity of the peas. Put again into cold salt water (1 
tbsp. salt to 1 qt. water) for an instant after blanching. 

Drain and pack to within 7 inch of the top of the 
jar. If too full; some of the peas will burst and make 



216 ADVICE TO THE HOUSEWIFE 

the liquor cloudy. Add sugar and salt seasoning, 
fill with water, and paddle well. . 

If peas are very small and tender, process pints at 
boiling for 2 hours continuously. If medium-sized 
peas are packed, process intermittently at boiUng 
or 45 minutes under 10 lbs. steam pressure. 

Peppers. The best sweet peppers for canning are 
the Spanish varieties known as pimentoes. The fruit 
of these peppers has very thick flesh, tough skin, and is 
comparatively smooth and free from ridges. The 
bell peppers are not suitable varieties for canning. 
Peppers should be ripe, sound, and free from bruises. 
Sort, using the whole peppers for canning and small 
or broken peppers for products such as sauces, soups, 
chutneys, and Dixie reUsh. Prepare for peehng by 
placing peppers in a hot oven for 6 to 8 minutes, being 
careful not to allow them to become hot enough to 
discolor. Peel, cut out stem, remove seeds, and pack 
dry in flattened layers. No water or seasoning is 
used in the preparation of these peppers; the proc- 
essing brings out a thick liquor which almost covers 
them in the can. Process pints for 30 minutes. 

Sweet Potatoes. The canning of sweet potatoes with 
uniformly successful results is diflScult. It is very 
much better to use correct methods of storing than 
to can them. 

A sweet potato which is dry and mealy when canned 
is desirable. The Nancy Hall is one of the best varie- 
ties for canning. Triumph and Southern Queen also 
are used. 

Processing sweet potatoes intermittently tends to 
darken the product; therefore a continuous period 
of processing at boiUng is advised for home use. Select 
absolutely sound potatoes a&d grade, putting together 



HOME CANNING OF FRXHTS, ETC. 217 

those of the same size. Boil or steam until three- 
fourths done. Peel and pack hot at once to prevent 
discoloring. Process 3 to 5 hours continuously at 
boiling, or 70 minutes at 250° F. 

Concentrated Vegetable Soup. Any desired mixture 
of vegetables may be packed for home use. A good 
combination consists of 1 quart concentrated tomato 
pulp, 1 pint corn or tiny lima beans, 1 pint okra, 4 
tsp. salt and sugar seasoning, 1 small onion chopped, 
and J c. of chopped sweet red pepper. Cook the 
tomatoes, pepper, and onion, put through a sieve to 
remove seeds, and cook down to about the consistency 
of ketchup. Measure, add the corn or beans and okra, 
which have been prepared as for canning, add season- 
ing, and cook all together for 10 minutes. Pack and 
process quarts for 2 hours continuously at boiling, 
or for 30 minutes under 10 lbs. steam pressure. (See 
recipe for tomato paste.) 

Spinach, Prepare the spinach by cutting off all 
dead leaves and roots. Cover each peck of spinach 
thus prepared with scalding soda solution (1 tsp. 
soda to 1 gallon water) and allow to stand for 2 min- 
utes. Wash thoroughly through several cold waters, 
and drain well. Blanch in rapidly boiling water for 
4 minutes. Drain well, pack into jars, cover with 
boiling brine, and process pint jars 1 to 2 hours at 
boiling, or 30 minutes under 5 lbs. steam pressure. 

If it is desirable to can other greens, these directions 
may be followed. 

Tomato, Select firm, uniformly red, ripe tomatoes of 
medium size. Put into trays and lower into boiling 
water for 1 minute. Remove and cut out the core 
with a slender-pointed knife without cutting into the 
seed cells. Peel promptly and pack into jars. Add 



218 ADVICE TO THE HOUSEWIFE 

sugar and salt seasoning and fill the jars with a thick 
tomato sauce. This procedure is economical^ because 
each quart jar will give whole tomatoes for salads or 
baking and a tomato pur^e for soups or sauces. This 
piu'^e or sauce, which is poured over the whole tomatoes, 
is made by cooking the small or broken tomatoes until 
tender. The seeds are then removed and the pulp 
is concentrated by boiUng to about the consistency 
of ketchup. Process quarts 25 minutes at boihng. 

Tomato Sauce or PurSe. If a more economical utili- 
zation of space within the jar is desired, a more con- 
centrated mixture can be packed. This also pro- 
vides for the use of small or broken tomatoes and large 
tomatoes unsuited for canning. 

Cut the tomatoes and add 1 large-sized onion 
chopped and 1 c. chopped sweet red pepper to each 
gallon of tomatoes. Cook until tender, put through 
a sieve, and add sugar and salt seasoning in the pro- 
portion of 1 tsp. to each quart of pulp. Cook until 
the consistency of ketchup, stirring constantly. Pack 
hot into jars or bottles and process pint jars 25 minutes 
at boihng. 

Vegetable Mixtures. Attractive and economical vege- 
table mixtures to be served in salads, with omelets or 
escalloped dishes, and as garnishes for meat dishes can be 
packed. This can be done often when small quantities 
are left from packing different vegetables whole. 
Any desired combinations may be made. Vegeta- 
bles maturing in the same season should be used. 
A good combination for the spring would be carrots, 
peas, string beans, and onions. A mixture which 
could be made from the fall garden might consist 
of peppers, celery, onions, and small Hma beans. All 
these vegetables are prepared separately, as for canning, 



HOME CANNING OF FRUITS, ETC. 219 

and packed In layers in the jar. Each layer should be 
packed as tightly as possible before the next is added. 
When the jar is filled, cover with brine and process 
2 hours continuously or intermittently. Beets can 
not be used in this mixture because they discolor the 
entire contents of the jar. 

The time-tables given for processing are safe only 
when young vegetables are seciired. Mature or tough 
vegetables require a longer period or higher tem- 
perature. 

Canning in Tin 

Before undertaking canning in tin, special equipment, 
including capping steel, tipping copper, fire pot for 
heating tools, cans with solder-hemmed caps, flux, 
sal ammoniac, and wire solder, must be secured. 
Follow all instructions for canning in glass up to the 
point where packing is done. See time-table for 
blanching period and for processing period for con- 
tainers of different sizes. Note also the vegetables 
and fruits which require enamel-lined or inside-lac- 
quered cans. 

NUMBER OF^CANS PER BUSHEL YIELDED BY THE 

FOLLOWING VEGETABLES 

1 bushel of tomatoes yields 24 No. 2 cans. 
1 bushel of tomatoes 3rields 18 No. 3 cans. 
1 bushel of beans yields 20 No. 2 cans. 
1 bushel of beans jdelds 14 No. 3 cans. 
1 bushel of peas in hull yields 25 No. 2 cans. 
100 ears of com yields 30 No. 2 cans. 

Flux is used in cleaning and retinning tools and is 
also used in sealing the cans. It is brushed around 
the cap before the hot tool is applied; and causes the 
solder to adhere to the tin. 



220 ADVICE TO THE HOUSEWIFE 

Making Flux. Put some commercial hydrochloric 
(muriatic) acid into a glass or crockery vessel (not 
metal), add strips of sheet zinc imtil no more can be 
dissolved. To this add an equal quantity of water. 
Label this " Flux " and use carefully. When canning, 
have one vessel (a can will do) with enough flux in 
it to clean the tools. Keep separately in a glass bottle 
the quantity to be used in seaUng cans. 

Cleaning and Tinning the Steel and Copper. It is 
of first importance to have the capping steel and 
tipping copper in good condition. These may need 
to be rubbed with coarse sandpaper or on a soft brick 
to smooth them, or the steel may have to be filed 
to remove the rust. In the latter case care must 
be taken to keep the edge of the steel true. Both 
the capping steel and tipping copper must be kept 
tinned or coated with solder to make the solder flow 
evenly when sealing. Have ready in a can a handful 
of sal ammoniac mixed with a few pieces of solder. 
Heat the already smoothed capping steel or tipping 
copper until almost red hot, dip into the flux, then into 
the sal ammoniac and solder, turning it about and 
rubbing until bright and well coated with solder. 
Then dip into the flux again. 

Packing. (See table, p. 225, for size of cans to use 
for different vegetables.) The Federal laws require 
cans packed for sale to be filled as full of food as is 
practicable for processing and to contain only enough 
Kquor to fill the spaces and cover the contents. Weigh 
a sufficient number of cans before and after filling to 
obtain an accurate idea of average net weight. On 
account of expansion in processing, corn can be packed 
less full than other vegetables. These instructions do 
not cover the canning of corn for market. Mark the 



HOME CANNING OF FRUITS, ETC. 221 

cans with a pencil or knife to show contents. Plan 
in advance and work rapidly. Let one person do the 
packing and another attend to the weighing. Do not 
allow filled cans to stand before adding liquor and 
exhausting. To do so will injure the product. 

Adding Brine, Sirup, or Water. After adding to 
within i inch of top, shake the can gently to displace 
all air within it. Now clean and wipe the groove 
around the opening. SUp on the cap, and weigh before 
seaUng to be sure of having the required weight. 

Fluxing and Capping. Apply the flux carefully 
around the groove, making sure that none of it enters 
the can. Use a small brush or cord, or little mop 
made by tying a piece of clean white cloth around 
the end of a small stick. The flux is used to make the 
solder adhere to the tin. Apply the clean, hot capping 
steel, holding the cap in place with the center rod while 
you lower the steel, and turn it steadily until the solder 
flows. Hold the rod firmly and Uft the steel with a 
sudden twist, to swing the melted solder around the 
groove evenly. 

A good fire pot can be made out of a galvanized 
bucket if ingenuity be employed. Charcoal or corn cobs 
can be used as fuel. 

Exhausting. Place the cans in trays, and lower into 
boiling water to within 1 inch of the top to, drive the 
air out of the cans. Let them stay the shortest possible 
time necessary to drive out the air. Ordinarily 3 
minutes is enough, and the temperature need not again 
reach boiling before cans are taken out. Exhausting 
is necessary. If omitted, the air left in the can ex- 
pands, causing it to bulge. The can may not resume 
normal shape again, or if it does and is exposed to a 
warmer temperature it may again expand; giving the 



222 ADVICE TO THE HOUSEWIFE 

appearance of a " swell/^ This will not only prevent 
sale of that can, but may also cut off future orders. 
Furthermore, the presence of air may cause the tin to 
dissolve more readily and enter into the food. 

Tipping. Close the small hole in top of the can 
immediately after exhausting. Apply flux as for cap- 
ping, and use a little wire solder to close the hole. 
Hold the solder with the left hand near the hole, and 
barely touch the hot copper to it, so that only a bead 
will drop and cover the hole. This makes a neat tip. 

Processing. Boil the cans which have been exhausted 
and tipped, to sterilize the contents. Have the water 
boiUng vigorously when the cans go in. Lower 
cans slowly under the water and look out for any show- 
ers of bubbles from the can. These show that it 
leaks at the point from which the bubbles come and 
must be taken out and resoldered. Begin counting 
time when the water first boils after immersing the 
cans. Keep it boiling constantly. In intermittent 
processing, the vegetable is processed for 1 hour on 
each of 3 successive days. The time sometimes is 
reduced to 2 days with very young string beans and 
some more easily sterilized vegetables. It is not 
possible to state the shortest time which may be 
used safely, because of the varying conditions. 

Cooling. Cool all canned products as quickly as 
possible to stop the cooking, which breaks down the 
fruit and injures the flavor and color. Plunge the cans 
into very cold water immediately, especially when 
processing intermittently. Never stack cans close to- 
gether until entirely cold. 

Labeling. After 8 to 10 days, or immediately before 
selling, label all cans. Place the sealed end down, 
so that the opposite end will appear at the top when 



HOME CANNING OF FRUITS, ETC. 223 

placed on the shelf. Use a rather dry paste, and put 

it only on the end of the label, so that no paste will 

touch the tin. If paste touches the can, it may cause 

rust. Where a damp climate causes cans to rust 

easily, the outside of the can may be lacquered before 

being labeled. Net weight in pounds and ounces, 

and packer's name and address, should appear on each 

label. 

Standards (or 4-H Brand Canned Vegetables 

Tomatoes. Cans to contain not less than 2 pounds 
1 oimce tomatoes in No. 3 and not less than 1 pound 
4 ounces tomatoes in No. 2 cans. To be filled with 
sound ripe fruit, carefully peeled and cored; tomatoes 
to be whole or in large pieces, firm, uniformly red, and 
of good flavor. No juice in excess of the amount 
present in the tomatoes canned is allowed. Any water 
is considered an adulteration. 

Tomatoes and Green Pepper. Cans to contain not 
less than 2 pounds packed in No. 3 cans. For this 
pack add 1 medium-size green sweet pepper, after 
removing the stem and seeds, to each can of tomatoes. 

String Beans. Net weight, in No. 3 can, before hquor 
is added, should be at least 1 pound 8 ounces, brine 
8 to 10 ounces. Net weight in No. 2 can should be 
13 ounces beans and about 8 ounces Uquor. Beans 
to be tender, green, uniform in size, well strung, and 
of good flavor. The net weight appearing on label 
for No. 3 can should be 2 pounds, and for No. 2 can 
1 pound 5 ounces. 

Peas. No. 2 cans to have at least 13} ounces net 
weight of peas and about 8} ounces liquor; peas to be 
fairly uniform in size, tender, whole, and of good 
flavor; Uquor clear. Net weight appearing on label 
should be, for No. 2 cans, 1 pound 8 ounces. 



224 ADVICE TO THE HOUSEWIFE 

Baby Beets, To be packed in No. 2 lacquered tins, 
about 30 baby beets to each can, maximum size 1} 
inches in diameter and average size 1 inch in diameter. 
No. 2 can to have at least 16 ounces whole beets and 
4 ounces liquid. Net weight appearing on label 
should be, for No. 2 cans, 1 pound 4 ounces. 

Okra. Net weight of contents in No. 3 can should 
appear on label, 2 pounds. Only yoimg, tender okra 
should be packed, and it is best simply to remove the 
cap without cutting into the seed pod and to pack it 
whole. Brine is added as explained in the table. 

Peppers. No. 2 cans to contain from 8 to 10 whole 
peppers. Flat No. 1 cans to contain 4 or 5 whole 
peppers. Net weight of contents appearing on the 
label should be for No. 2 can not less than 1 pound, 
or flat No. 1 can not less than 8 ounces. 

Soup Mixture. This should consist of a mixture 
which is made in the proportion of one-half tomato 
pulp, one-fourth corn or tiny lima beans, and one- 
fourth okra, with seasoning added. One sUce of onion 
2 inches in diameter should be added to each No. 2 can. 
The tomatoes should be heated, rubbed through a sieve 
and cooked down to about the consistency of ketchup 
before measuring; then the corn, okra, onion, and sea- 
soning should be added and cooked until the corn 
and okra are about three-fourths done. Then pack 
into cans and follow directions as given in the table 
below. Net weight appearing on label of No. 2 can 
should be 1 pound 4^ ounces. 

Standards for 4-H Brand Canned Fmits 

Figs. The net-weight contents of a No. 2 enamel- 
lined can of figs should, as shown on the label, be not 
less than 1 pound 6 ounces. Figs should remain

NoTK. — Berries, cherries, currants, figs, gooseberries, May haws, and plums 
when packed in tin must be put in enamel-lined cans. 

To make the sirups recommended, boil sugar and water together in the pro- 
portion given below until sugar is dissolved. Strain all impurities out of the 
sirup before using. 

Sirup No. 1, use 14 ounces to 1 gallon water. 
Sirup No. 2, use 1 pound 14 oimces to 1 gallon water. 
Sirup No. 3, use 3 pounds 9 ounces to 1 gallon water. 
Sirup No. 4, use 5 poimds 8 ounces to 1 gallon water. 
•Sirup No. 5, use 6 pounds 13 ounces t-o 1 gallon water. 
The sirup for canned berries is made out of berry juice instead of water. 

whole and a No. 2 can should contain about 30 to 35 
whole figs. 

Peaches. A No. 3 can should have at least 1 pound 
5 ounces solids (from 10 to 12 halves of peaches) and 
11 ounces liquid, and the net weight appearing on label 
should not be less than 2 pounds. 

Pears. The net weight in a No. 3 can should be 
not less than 2 pounds, having 11 ounces liquid, 1 
pound 5 ounces solids (from 12 to 14 halves of pears). 



HOME CANNING OF FRUITS, ETC. 227 

Berries. The net weight of a No. 3 can of black- 
berries or raspberries should be 2 pounds; of a No. 2 
can, 1 pound 6 ounces; whole berries weighing about 
one-half of total in each case. The berries should be 
large, whole, and of good color and flavor. The sirup 
used in packing must be made out of strained berry 
juice and sugar, with no water added. Enamel- 
lined cans always should be used. 

Jams, Fniit Butters, and Marmalades 

Jams are made of small fruits which are not whole or 
firm enough to use for preserves. No attempt is made 
to retain the original shape of the fruit, the finished 
product having a uniform consistency. Marmalades 
have a more jelly-like texture, and thin slices of the fruit 
appear suspended throughout the mixture. In fruit 
butters and pastes frequently less sugar is used than 
in jams, and the product is more concentrated. Con- 
serves may be made of large or small fruits, cooked 
in the same manner as jams. Sometimes nuts are 
added. 

With jams, preserves, and jellies, it is advisable to use 
a chemical thermometer. Centigrade reading ranging 
from 0** to 110**, which, having fewer figures than a 
Fahrenheit instrmnent, is more easily read. The stem 
of this instrument should be 12 or 14 inches long, so 
that the reading will appear far enough above the sur- 
face to be easily seen. Fahrenheit readings given in 
recipes are approximate. 

Well glazed, hermetically sealed stoneware jars with 
capacity of 8 oz. and up, are suitable and attractive con- 
tainers for packing jams, marmalades, relishes, and 
pickles. 



228 ADVICE TO THE HOUSEWIFE 

Jams and marmalades may be packed hot in ster- 
ilized jars and sealed immediately. When packing 
for market, however, it is far safer to process them 
both to insure steriUzation and a tight seal. Proc- 
ess pints for 30 minutes at simmering (87^ C.) or 
188^ F. 

Apple Butter.* Measure the apples, wash to remove 
dirt, slice into small pieces, and for each bushel of apples 
add 4 gallons of water; boil until the fruit is soft, then 
rub through a screen or sieve. 

To the pulp from each bushel of apples add 2 gallons 
of cider that has been concentrated to one-half its 
original volume. Bring to a boil and add 12 lbs. 
of sugar. Continue the cooking, and just before the 
consistency desired for finished apple butter is reached 
add spices, cinnamon, and cloves, according to taste. 
When the butter is as thick as desired, place in ster- 
ilized containers and seal immediately. 

Berry Jam. In selecting berries for jam, the ripe, 
broken ones will give fine color and flavor, but about 
one-half the quantity should be slightly underripe. 
This is necessary to give a jelly-like consistency to 
the product. Cooking in small quantities also helps 
to retain color and flavor. Weigh the berries and 
allow three-fourths of a pound of sugar to each pound 
of fruit. Rapid cooking with constant care is essential. 

In stirring jam use a wooden spoon or paddle, mov- 
ing it across the center of the vessel first one way and 
then the opposite and next aroimd the pan, gently 
moving the mixture from the bottom of the pan, being

same test as required for finished jelly; that is, when 
a little is held a moment and cooled in a spoon, it will 
not pour from the side of the spoon but will fall in a 
sheet or flake. Pack and seal while hot. 

Fig Jam. Select very ripe figs, remove all stems, 
treat them with scalding soda solution, and rinse 
thoroughly. (See Fig. Preserves, p. 237.) Cook in 
quantities nor larger than 3 lbs. at one time. Allow 
1} lbs. sugar to each 3 lbs. of figs. Add barely enough 
water to start the cooking (about one-half cup), 
crush the figs, heat to boiling, and add the sugar. 
Cook rapidly to 105 *" C. or 221** F., following instruc- 
tions given under Berry Jam. Pack and process at 
simmering for 30 minutes. 

Guava Paste. Wash the guavas, remove blossom 
end, and cut into small pieces. Add sufficient water to 
start cooking without burning, cook imtil very soft, 
rub through a sieve; a flour sifter may be used success- 
fully. Measure the part which has passed through 
the sieve and for each cup of guava add one-half cup 
of sugar. Continue the cooking (stirring constantly 
to prevent burning) until the excess of water is driven 
off, which is recognized by the manner in which the 
mixture leaves the pan on stirring. Remove from the 
fire, pour on a marble slab or on paraffin paper, and 
when cold cut into slices and pack in a box Uned with 
paraffin paper. 

Peach jam. 

2} lb. peaches cut into small pieces. ) c. peach juice. 

1 lb. sugar. i tsp. whole cloves. 

6 whole allspice. 1 tsp. cinnamon bark. 

1 cracked peach seed. 1 sprig mace. 
1 inch ginger root. 

(Tie spices in cheese-cloth bag.) 



230 ADVICE TO THE HOUSEWIFE 

Cook all together until thick as marmalade and 
dear (to 105** C. or 221** F.). Pack hot in hot jars 
and seal at once, or process. 

Citrus Fruit Marmalade (three-day method).* 1 
grapefruit; 1 orange; 1 lemon. Wash fruit and then 
cut very thin through pulp and rind, discarding all 
the seeds. Weigh the fruit and to each pound of the 
fruit add 3 poimds of water. Let stand over night. 
Next day boil for 30 minutes and let stand for 24 
hours. Next day measure or weigh the fruit, and for 
each pound or portion of fruit juice add 1 pound or 
portion of sugar. Bring to a boil and cook until it 
jellies, stirring so as to keep from burning. Place in 
glasses or jars while still hot, allow to cool, and then 
cover with paraffin. 

Sweet Orange or Grapefruit Marmalade,* Wash the 
fruit, weigh the peel and discard one-fourth of it, 
and note the weight of edible portion plus the remaining 
peel. Place peel in water, boil for 5 minutes, and pour 
ofif water. Again cover peel with boiling water and 
allow to simmer over the fire imtil tender. Pour oflf 
water and add cold water to harden the peel. Then 
cut into as thin slices as possible. Place edible part 
of the orange or grapefruit in a kettle with twice the 
amount of water as of fruit, and boil until the pulp 
has disintegrated. Strain through a muslin or cheese- 
cloth bag, and for each pound of the edible portion 
and shredded peel add 1} lbs. sugar. Boil until the 
jellying point is reached. 

Sour Orange Marmalade.* 

1 pound peeled sour oranges. 

2 pounds watei. 
1 pound sugar. 



HOME CANNING OF FRUITS, ETC. 231 

Preparation of the peel: Wash fruit, remove peel; 
discard one-fourth of the peel, using the portion free 
from blemish. Cut this peel into as thin sUces as 
possible, place in a kettle with four times its weight of 
water, boil for 10 minutes, and drain free from water. 
Repeat this process three times. 

Preparation of the juice: After the peel has been 
removed, weigh the fruit, cut into small pieces, place 
in a kettle, and for each pound of orange add 2 lbs. 
water. Boil until it thoroughly disintegrates. Pour 
into a flannel jelly bag and press until no more juice 
can be obtained. Again drain juice through a clean 
flannel jelly bag without pressing. 

Pour this juice into a kettle, add the peel, bring to a 
boil, add 1| lbs. sugar for each pound of friiit, and con- 
tinue the boiUng until the jelly stage is reached, which 
is indicated by the flaking or sheeting from the spoon. 

Grape Jam. Select grapes about one-half of which 
are underripe rather than entirely ripe. Wash and 
stem the fruit. Separate the pulp from the skins. 
Cook pulps for 10 minutes and press through a sieve 
or colander to remove seeds. Add three-fourths cup 
of water to each quart of skin and boil imtil tender. 
Then put the pulp and skins together and measure. 
For every quart of the mixture use 1 lb. of sugar. 
Bring the fruit to a boil, add the sugar, and cook, 
stirring frequently until it will give the jelly test or 
reaches 105° C. or 221** F. Pour into steriUzed jars 
and process as for jam. 

Gingered Pears. Use pears not quite ripe, peel, core, 
and cut into thin slices. To 8 lbs. of pears, allow 6 
lbs. sugai, 1 cup of water, and the juice of 4 lemons. 
Cut the lemon rinds into thin strips, and add them. 
Also add one-eighth pound of ginger root cut into 



232 ADVICE TO THE HOUSEWIFE 

pieces. Simmer untU thick as marmalade. Pack 
like peach jam. 

Damson Plum Conserve. 

4 pounds plums. 2 oranges. 

3 pounds sugar. 1 pound raisins. 

1 pound shelled nuts. 

Remove the seeds and chop the plums. Peel the 
oranges and slice thinly one-half of the peel. Discard 
the other peel and the seeds. Mix chopped plums, 
orange pulp, sliced peel, sugar and raisins. Cook all 
together rapidly until bright and thick as jam. Add 
nuts 5 minutes before removing from the fire. If a 
thermometer is available, cook to 102® C. or 215** F. 
Add the nuts and cook to 103*" C. or 217** F. Remove 
from fire, cool, and pack into jars. 

Figs, after treating with soda as for preserves, may 
be made into conserve by this method. 

Fruit pastes, as they are called, consist of boiled- 
down fruit pulp with sugar added according to the acid- 
ity of the fruit, and are improved in flavor if several 
varieties of fruit are mixed. After the fruit paste is 
made (see recipes), it can be colored red, yellow, or 
green with harmless vegetable colors. The coloring 
is stirred into the boiling mass after removing from the 
fire. Different flavors also can be added at this stage 
if desired. The paste is poured out in a half-inch 
layer on flat dishes, marble, or glass slabs, which are 
first rubbed with a cloth dipped in a good salad oil. 
The dishes are then exposed to draft for a couple of 
days, after which the paste is cut into figures. If the 
paste is well boiled down it is dried more easily. (Many 
small forms useful for cutting the paste can be had on 
the market.) The paste can also be cut with a common 



HOME CANNING OF FRUITS, ETC. 233 

knife or with a fluted vegetable knife, or it can be cut 
in round cakes, the center of which is again cut with 
a smaller circular cutter; there will thus be both rings 
and small round cakes. The cut paste is placed on 
paper, sprinkled with crystallised sugar or common 
granulated sugar. Then it stands again a couple of 
days exposed to draft, is dipped in crystallized sugar 
and packed in a tin or wooden box lined with parch- 
ment paper and with layers of the same paper placed 
between the layers of paste. 

The paste can be kept thus and served as dessert, 
and as garnishing on creams and custards, frozen 
creams, large cakes, etc. 

Apricot Paste. 1 lb. powdered sugar to 1 lb. fruit 
pulp. Rub the fruit pulp through a pur^e strainer 
and weigh it. Add the sugar, put it over a slow fire, 
and cook until very thick, so that when a spoon has 
been passed through it the mess does not run together 
immediately. Then pour the paste upon flat dishes 
which have been rubbed with oil, and allow it to dry. 
Cut and pack in layers as directed above. 

In the same manner raspberry, strawberry, and cur- 
rant pastes are made. 

Quince Paste. J lb. powdered sugar for each pound 
of fruit pulp. Wipe the fruit, cut into quarters, remove 
flower and core, and cook in water until very tender. 
After rubbing the pulp through a sieve, weigh it and 
add the required amount of sugar. It is then cooked 
xmtil very thick. Scalded and chopped nut kernels 
may be added. The pulp remaining after the juice 
has been extracted for quince jelly may be used also. 

Gooseberry Paste. 1 lb. powdered sugar for each 
poimd of fruit pulp. Use part ripe and part slightly- 
underripe berries.! Cook as previously described. 



234 ADVICE TO THE HOUSEWIFE 

This paste may be colored before it is poured out. 
Different flavoiB also can be added to the gooseberry 
as weD as chopped or sGced almonds €r other nuts. 

Apple Paste.^ \ lb. powdered sugar to 1 lb. polp 
as mbbed through a sieve. For this product apples 
that are of lower grade than is required for some other 
purposes can be used. Cut the apples into quarters. 
Remove flower, stem and core. Put fruit into ccdd 
water until it is ready to be cooked. Boil tender under 
cover and over a very low fire in order not to scorch. 
Rub the tender apples through a coarse sieve, weigh, 
and put in the kettle to be cooked with the sugar 
under constant stirring until it is rather firm. It can 
be varied in taste by the aid of different additions, as, 
for instance, vanilla, peppermint, or orange flavor, 
or cooked with either finely cut citron, finely cut lemon 
peel, or blanched and cut nut kernels. The paste is 
poured out, dried, and kept as the others. 

Other fruit pastes can be made of cherries, plums, 
kumquats, guavas, and other tropical fruits. 

It is often advisable to make several different pastes. 
When nearly dry (before cutting) place different colored 
or different flavored layers on top of each other as in a 
layer cake. With a sharp knife cut in one-half inch 
strips through all layers and dry. 

Tomato Paste. 

1 qt. thick strained tomato pulp. } tsp. salt. 

1 slice onion. 1 tsp. sugar. 

4 tbsp. chopped sweet red pepper 1 tbsp. mixed spices, 
pulp, or 1 tsp. paprika. 

Cook spices, tied in bag, with tomato pulp in a pan 
over boiling water for about three hours, or until the 
paste is thick enough to hold the shape of spoon when 

1 The recipes for tbe fruit pastes were furnished by Mr. Frants P. Lund.

tested by dipping out a spoonful. Pack hot, process 
small jars 15 minutes in water bath at 212^ F. 

Preserving 

A preserve is the product resulting when whole fruits 
are cooked in sirup until clear and transparent. When 
properly made the fruit in the preserve keeps its form, 
is plump, tender, clear, and of good color, the sur- 
rounding sirup being also clear and of proper density. 

In making preserves the object is to have the fruit 
permeated with the sirup. It is well known that if 
two liquids of different densities be brought into con- 
tact with each other they tend to mix or diffuse until 
they equalize each other and become of the same 
density. This diffusion takes place through the cell 
walls of fruit or vegetables as readily as if they were 
not present between the fruit juice and the denser 
liquid. If fruit were placed at once in a very heavy 
sirup the difference in density between the two Uquids 
would be so great that the sirup would absorb the fruit 
juice rapidly. This would cause the fruit to shrink 
and become shriveled and toughened. The sirup 
can then enter the fruit with great difficulty. In order 
to prevent shrinkage it is necessary to put fruit at 
first into this sirup and increase its density slowly 
enough for diffusion to take place and for the fruit 
to be permeated with the sirup. This is done by 
boihng the fruit in sirup or by alternately cooking 
and allowing the product to stand immersed in the 
sirup, the density of the sirup being increased by 
evaporation or by substituting a heavier sirup for the 
lighter one after each period of standing. It at any 
time the fruit shrivels or wrinkles, the sirup should 



236 ADVICE TO THE HOUSEWIFE 

be made less dense by the addition of water. If 
this process be carried on gradually enough, the fruit 
may be completely saturated with sugar (as is the case 
with crystaUized products) without shrinking. 

In order to measure the density of Uquids accu- 
rately and proceed with certainty, instruments called 
hydrometers have been devised. The one for the 
special purpose of measuring the density of sugar 
solution is known as a saccharometer. One type of 
saccharometer is a shot-weighted glass spindle gradu- 
ated from to 70 degrees, a Balling scale being used. 
When placed in water the spindle rests on the bottom 
of the vessel and the reading at the surface is zero. 
As the density is increased the spindle rises until when 
the solution is saturated with sugar at the tempera- 
ture indicated the reading is 100. This saccharometer 
is inexpensive and is accurate enough for ordinary use. 
The Brix scale has the same gradations of density as 
the Balling, but is sUghtly more accurate, and costs 
more. It may be secured mercury-weighted. In using 
a saccharometer it is necessary to have a vessel of the 
same depth, in which to float it to make the reading. 
This must be very narrow in order not to demand 
so large a quantity of sirup to measure its density. 
A 250 cubic centimeter glass cylinder or a brass sac- 
charometer cup is used. 

For fruits Uke peaches, peaite, watermelon rind, etc., 
preserving should be begun in sirup not heavier than 
30*" Balling (No. 3 in table, p. 226). Juicy fruits Uke 
berries can be put at the beginning into a heavier sirup, 
about 40** Balling, because the abundant juice of the 
fruit quickly reduces the density of the sirup before 
shrinking can take place. Finished preserves are 
packed in a sirup ranging from 50^ to 60^ Balling. 



HOME CANNING OF FRUITS, ETC. 237 

Sirup made with very acid fruits can be made heavier 
than pure sugar sirups without danger of crystaUiza- 
tion, because the acid inverts some of the sugar, chang- 
ing it to a form which will not crystalUze readily. 

Since long cooking injures the color and flavor of 
fruits, it is desirable to cook delicate fruits such as 
berries for as short a time as possible. CooUng rapidly 
after cooking gives preserves a better color and flavor 
than can be secured when they are packed hot. Stand- 
ing immersed in sirup after cooking also helps to plump 
them. If berry preserves are covered for a brief time 
before removing from fire and the vessel left covered 
while cooUng, the product will be more plump. 

For cooUng, shallow enamel trays or pans are desir- 
able. Tin can not be used because fruits will dis- 
color in it. Pack preserves cold, bring the sirup in 
which they have stood to boiling test, and if of proper 
density pour over the packed preserves, paddUng to 
remove all air bubbles. If not of the right weight 
for packing, the sirup must be concentrated by boil- 
ing. To seal properly and to insure safety from mold 
it is necessary to process all preserves. Since they 
can be steriUzed below the boiling point, processing 
at simmering (89** C.) for 30 minutes is preferable 
to boihng, because this temperature will give better 
color. 

Fig Preserves. 6 qts. figs; 2 qts. sugar; 3 qts. 
water. Put the figs into a boiling soda solution (1 c. 
soda to 6 qts. of boiling water) and allow figs to remain 
about 5 minutes. Rinse the figs well by putting them 
through two cold baths. Drain the fruit thoroughly 
and add gradually to the skimmed sirup, which has been 
made by boiling the sugar and water together for 10 
minutes. Cook rapidly until the figs are clear and 



238 ADVICE TO THE HOUSEWIFE 

tender (about 2 hours). Carefully lift the fruit out and 
place in shallow pans. Cover the figs with the sirup 
and allow to stand overnight. Pack the cold figs 
in sterilized jars, fill each jar to overflowing witli the 
sirup. Cap, clamp, and process. 

Strawberry Preserves. 2 lbs. berries; 1| lbs. sixgax; 
1 c. berry juice. Pick over the fruit and put to^etiier 
all firm, perfect berries. Shghtly heat, crush, and 
strain the others to obtain the juice. Make a sirup 
of the sugar and juice, bring to the boiUng point, 
remove from the fire, and cool before adding the berries. 
Add the berries a few at a time. Place again over the 
fire and heat slowly to boiUng. Cook rapidly to 106® C 
or 223 ^^ F. If a thermometer is not at hand, cook 
until berries are bright and transparent. Cool and 
pack cold in steriHzed jars. Process at simmering 
(87® C. or 188® F.) to give best results in color and 
flavor. For 12-oz. or pint jars at this temperature, 
process for i hour. Other berries may be preserved 
in the same way. 

Watermelon Preserves. Cut 1 lb. watermelon rind 
into inch squares. Allow to stand overnight in clear 
water. Drain and cover with about 30® sirup (2 c. 
sugar to 1 qt. water). Boil for 25 minutes. Let stand 
overnight immersed in sirup. Next morning add juice 
of I lemon and three slices of lemon additional for each 
pound. Cook until transparent (about 1 hour). Let 
stand until cold. Pack, add the sirup, garnishing with 
sHces of lemon, cap, and process. 

Gingered Watermelon Rind. To each pound of rind 
cut into 1-inch squares, add 2 qts. of water and 1 oz. 
slacked lime. Let stand in hme water overnight. 
Next morning drain and let stand 1 to 2 hours in fresh 
cold water. Drain well and boil rapidly in strong 



HOME CANNING OF FRUITS, ETC. 239 

ginger tea (1 oz. ginger to 1 qt. water) for 15 minutes. 
Drain, put into a 30° sirup made by using 1 pt. strained 
ginger tea with a qt. water and 1) lbs. of sugar. Cook 
until tender and transparent (about 1^ hours). After 
boiUng a half hour add half a lemon sUced thin. Place 
in shallow pans to cool, having the rind well covered 
with sirup. When cool arrange pieces attractively 
in jars, cover to overflowing with sirup. Cap, clamp, 
and process. 

Uniform products can be more easily obtained by 
using the saccharometer to test the density of the sirup. 
The packing sirup for preserved and gingered water- 
melon rind and figs should be of 55° density, Balling 
saccharometer. 

Cherry Preserves. 4 lbs. cherries; 3 lbs. sugar; 1 c. 
cherry juice. Make a sirup of the sugar and fruit juice, 
cool, add seeded cherries, and cook rapidly until fruit 
is clear and sirup is of the proper consistency. If a 
thermometer is used, finish cherry preserves at 106° 
to 108° C. or 223° to 226° F. Cool, pack into jarg, 
and process as for other preserves. 

Jelly Making 

A good jelly should be bright, of good color, and clear. 
When removed from the glass, it should retain the shape 
of the mold. The jelly can be cut with a distinct 
cleavage, retaining the angles where cut. It should 
sparkle and be tender enough to quiver without 
breaking. 

Fruit for Jelly Making. The juice from certain 
fruits, such as grape, apple, crab-apple, orange, kum- 
quat, and currant is better suited for making a natural 
fruit jelly than juices from other fruits. The juices 



240 ADVICE TO THE HOUSEWIFE 

from these fruits contain the properties necessary for 
jelly making. The best fruits for jelly making contain 
pectin and acid. Pectin, the fundamental jelly- 
making substance, does not exist in some fruits in 
sufficient amount to make jelly without the addition 
of pectin from some other source. The peach, straw* 
berry, and cherry are examples of fruits which contain 
acid but are lacking in pectin. Pear, guava, and quince 
contain pectin but are deficient in acid. If the missing 
property be added to each of these fruits, a jelly with 
the color and flavor of the fruit selected can be made. 
Extracting the Juice. Wash such fruit as berries, 
grapes, and currants in running water and add 1' cup 
of water for each pound of fruit. For apples, quinces, 
guavas, and such hard fruits, wash, slice, and add 
3 c. water to each poimd of fruit. The fruit should be 
cooked until tender, a small quantity of water being 
added to help extract the juice. The fruit juice will 
flow more freely when heated than when cold, and 
the cooking develops the pectin. As soon as the fruit is 
tender the liquid should be squeezed through a cheese- 
cloth and then be allowed to drip, without pressure, 
through a flannel jelly bag. Over-cooking of the 
fruit is apt to result in a cloudy jelly. After cooling 
the juice to room temperature, test it to determine 
the amount of pectin present. This test gives some 
idea of the proper proportion of sugar to juice. Add 
1 tbsp. 95 per cent grain alcohol to an equal volume of 
cooled fruit juice and shake gently. The effect of the 
alcohol is to bring together the pectin in a jelly-like 
mass. If a large quantity of pectin is present it will 
appear in one mass or clot when poured from the glass. 
This indicates that equal quantities of sugar and juice 
may be used. If the pectin does not slip from the glass 



HOME CANNING OF FRUITS, ETC. 241 

in one mass, less sugar wiU be required. A fair propor- 
tion is f e. of sugar to 1 c. of juice. If the pectin is 
thin and much separated, ^ c. of sugar allowed for 
each cup of juice will be sufficient. 

Qiuintity of Juice to Cook. The quantity of juice 
to be cooked at one time will depend upon the size 
of the vessel and the methods of heating available. 
The capacity of the vessel used should be four times 
as great as the volume of juice to be cooked. If the 
attempt is made to cook a large quantity of juice at 
one time over a slow flame, there will be a loss of color 
and a decrease in the yield, partly due to the destruc- 
tion of the pectin. 

When to Add the Sugar. When the proportion of 
sugar to juice has been determined, measure the fruit 
juice and place over the fire to cook. When the juice 
begins to boil, add the sugar immediately and stir 
until the sugar is dissolved. By adding the sugar when 
the juice begins to boil, more time is given for the 
inversion of the sugar by the acids of the fruit and there 
is less danger of crystallization. 

Cooking the Jelly. After the sugar has dissolved, 
the cooking should be as rapid as possible. Finished 
jelly can be obtained more quickly by rapid cooking. 
Long cooking will tend to darken the product and de- 
stroy the pectin, which will cause the finished jelly 
to be less firm. 

Testing for the Finished JeUy. A thermometer can 
be used to great advantage to show when the jellying 
point is almost reached. No exact temperature can 
be given, because the jellying point differs with dif- 
ferent fruits, with the quantity of sugar used, and with 
the same fruits at different seasons. In using a 
thermometer for cooking apple jelly it has been noted 



242 ADVICE TO THE HOUSEWIFE 

that the temperature is seldom less than 105^ C. 
or 221 ** F. or more than 106* C. or 223* F. While the 
temperature for guava jelly is approximately 108* C. 
or 226* F.f a temperature less than this will give a 
sirupy product. With grape and currant jelly, between 
106* C. and 107* C. or 223* F. and 224* F. will give 
the best results. 

Since no definite temperature can be given for the 
finished jelly, the most convenient means of determin- 
ing when it is finished is to test it with a spoon or paddle. 
Dip a spoon or wooden paddle in the boiling mass. 
Remove and cool by moving it back and forth for a 
few seconds and then allow the jelly to drop from it. 
As long as there is sirup present it wiU run or drop 
from the spoon. When the jellying point is reached, 
it will break from the spoon in fiakes or sheets. When 
this jelly stage is reached, remove from the fire imme- 
diately and skim. Skimming at this point saves waste. 

Filling Glasses. After skimming the jelly, pour at 
once into hot sterilized glasses and set aside to cool. 

Cooling and Sealing. Cool as rapidly as possible, 
avoiding dust which will give contamination with mold. 
When the jelly is cold, cover it with melted paraffin. 
By running a pointed stick around the edge of the glass 
while the paraffin is still hot, a better seal can be 
obtained. 

Storing. Jelly should be stored in a cool, dark, dry 
place. If jelly is stored for a long period of time, it 
will deteriorate in texture, color, and flavor. 

Mistakes to Avoid. Soft Jelly. Jellies sometimes are 
sirupy because more sugar has been used than the 
fruit juices require or because boiUng after the addition 
til sugar was not continued long enough to drive off 
excessive water. 



HOME CANNING OF FRUITS, ETC. 243 

Tough Jelly. Jelly is tough or stringy because too 
small an amount of sugar was used for the quantity 
of fruit juice taken or because the boiling was con- 
tinued after the jellying point had been reached. 

Crystals in Jelly. Crystals appear throughout the 
jelly because of an excess of sugar. When sugar is 
boiled with an acid for a sufficient length of time^ 
it is changed into a form which does not crystallize. 
Crystals are found in jelly sometimes because the juice 
is boiled to too great a concentration before the addi- 
tion of sugar; or in boiUng, the sirup spatters on the side 
of the pan and dries, and in pouring the finished product, 
these crystals are carried into the glasses of jelly 
and in that way the jelly becomes seeded with crystals. 

Cloudy Jellies. This may be due to having cooked 
the fruit too long before straining off the juice or to not 
having used sufficient care in straining the juice. 
Sometimes it is noticed in apple and crab-apple jelly 
that although it is clear when first made, the jelly 
becomes cloudy after a time. In these cases it usually 
is due to the use of partly green fruit, the starch in 
this fruit probably causing the cloudy appearance. 

Apple Pectin. 

1 pound apple pulp (or skins and cores). ^ 
Juice of 1 lemon. 
4 pounds water. 

Boil for I to f hour, press the juice through a cloth 
bag, then allow this juice to drain without pressure 
through a heavy flannel or haircloth jelly bag. This 
juice when cold should be tested with alcohol to deter- 
mine the proportion of sugar to add to a volume of 
juice. Pectin can be bottled, processed for 15 minutes 

* Only sound fruit should be used, not decomposed or worm-eaten fruit.

jelly making. 

Orange Pectin. Cut or scrape the yellow rind from 
the peel of the orange, the white portion remaining 
being passed through the food chopper and weighed. 
For each pound of this prepared peel add 2 lbs. of water 
and 4 tbsp. of lemon juice, mix thoroughly, and allow 
to stand 15 minutes. Then add 2 lbs. water, boil 10 
minutes, let stand overnight. Next morning boil 
10 minutes, allow to cool, press to remove juice, and 
then drain juice through a flannel bag. If not desired 
for immediate use, bottle and process as for apple 
pectin. 

Mint and Orange (or Apple) Pectin Jelly. 

1 pint concentrated orange (or apple) pectin juice. 

1 lb. sugar. 

2 drops oil peppermint. 

2 drops green vegetable coloring. 

Bring the orange or apple pectin juice to boiling, 
add sugar, and boil rapidly until the jellying point is 
reached. At this point 2 drops of green vegetable 
coloring matter is added, together with 2 drops of 
oil of peppermint. Stir thoroughly, and pour while 
hot into clean, sterilized jelly glasses. After a few 
moments the scum which rises to the top may be re- 
moved from the jelly easily with a spoon. Complete 
jelly as previously directed.

INTRODUCTION 

If food products are left in their natural state, 
most of them spoil in a few hours or a few days owing 
to the growth on their surface or* in their tissues of 
bacteria, molds, or other organisms of decay. If such 
organisms usually present in food can be killed and 
the entrance of other organisms prevented, the food 
can be kept in good condition practically indefinitely. 

1 A few products, suoh as soup stock and food combinations, owing to their 
phsrslcal condition, are packed hot. The general principles involved, however, 
are the same in all other regards. 

247 



248 ADVICE^ TO THE HOUSEWIFE 

It is this destruction of organisms and protection of the 
food from contamination that is accomplished by can- 
ning — the preparation and treatment before paddng 
and process of placing food products in air-tight con- 
tainers and sterilizing them. 

Most home makers are familiar with some form of 
canning. Much of the canning practiced in homes, 
however, has been restricted to the putting up of 
fruits. The canning of vegetables and of meats has 
been considered until recently, by all but a relatively 
few persons, to be too complicated to be done satis- 
factorily in the home. By the method adopted for 
use in the home canning-club work of the United 
States Department of Agriculture in the Northern 
and Western States, however, it has been foimd to be 
a relatively simple matter to can practically any food 
product in the home, with ordinary kitchen equip- 
ment and with the expenditure of comparatively little 
labor. This method of canning is described in the 
following pages and is intended primarily for use in the 
Northern and Western States. By its use the time 
required for the treatment of food to prepare it for 
keeping is reduced to a minimum. 

Preparations for Canning 

The first steps in the canning method described in 
this bulletin, as in all canning, consist in the prepara- 
tion and cleaning of containers and in the preparation 
of the products to be canned by washing, paring, trim- 
ming, and cutting into pieces where division is neces- 
sary. 

Those engaged in the work should start with clean 
hands, clean utensils, clean, sound, fresh products, 



ONE-PERIOD, COLD-PACK CANNING 249 

and pure, clean, soft water. No vegetables or fruits 
which are withered or unsound should be canned. If 
possible, only fruits and vegetables picked the day 
of canning should be used. Peas and corn, which lose 
their flavor rapidly, should be canned, in fact, within 
5 hours if a choice product is desired. 

Before the preparation of the products is begun 
the containers should be washed. If glass or crockery 
jars are used, they should be placed in a vessel of cold 
water over a fire to heat. They will then be hot and 
ready for use when the products have been prepared 
for packing. 

All grit and dirt should be washed carefully from the 
materials to be used. All products should be graded 
especially for ripeness. Large fruits and vegetables 
should be pared if necessary, and small fruits, berries, 
and greens picked over carefully. 

Steps in Canning 

After the materials have been cleaned and put 
into the shape in which they are to be canned, and con- 
tainers have been cleaned and tested, the canning pro- 
cedure for most products by the one-period cold-pack 
method consists of five steps — scalding or blanching, 
cold-dipping, packing, processing, and seaHng. In 
canning berries and all soft fruits the blanching is 
dispensed with. 

The products to be canned are blanched or scalded 
usually by being placed, in a cheese-cloth bag or dipping 
basket, into boiling water and allowed to remain there 
from 1 to 15 minutes, depending on the kind of prod- 
uct. In the case of greens and green vegetables, how- 
ever, the scalding is accomplished most satisfactorily 



260 ADVICE TO THE HOUSEWIFE 

in steam, as volatile oils and other substances remain in 
the food under this treatment. Such products may be 
put into a colander, set over a vessel of boiling water 
and covered as tightly as possible. Better results may 
be obtained, however, by the use of a steam cooker. 

As soon as the product is removed from the boiling 
water or steam, it should be dipped into cold, clean 
water and immediately removed and drained for a 
few moments. The temperature of the water used for 
cold dipping shotdd be as low as possible. 

The product should be packed carefully into hot 
jars as soon as removed. In the case of fruits, boiling 
hot sirup or hot water is then added. In the case of 
vegetables, hot water usually is used and salt is added 
for seasoning. The scalded rubbers and tops of jars 
are put into place, the tops of cans sealed, and the 
containers are placed in a hot-water bath, pressure 
cooker, or other similar device for processing. 

Processing is the final application of heat to sterilize 
the product and is continued for a period determined 
by the character of the product and the kind of appara- 
tus used (see time schedule pp. 283-286). The con- 
tainers should be placed in the processing vessel as 
soon as they are filled. 

Immediately after the termination of the processing 
period, while the products are still hot, glass and similar 
^ containers must be sealed. 

Jars should then be placed in a tray upside down to 
cool, and closely examined for leaks. If leakage occurs, 
the covers should be tightened until they are com- 
pletely closed. 

Tin cans may be cooled by plunging them in cold 
water. When the pack;pd containers are thus cooled, 
they should be stored in a cool, dry place not exposed 



ONE-PERIOD, OOLD-PACK CANNING 261 

to freezing temperature. Most products packed in 
glass jars will bleach or darken if exposed to light. 
It is well, therefore, to wrap jars in paper. From time 
to time, especially during very hot weather, both 
glass jars and tin cans should be examined to make 
certain that there are no leaks, swellings, or other 
signs of fermentation. 

Equipment Required 

Whatever type of apparatus is used for processing 
or sterilizing, a number of utensils are needed for 
properly handUng the products during the proceeding 
steps. These include five or six acid-proof pans with 
covers for use in handling and blanching acid fruits, 
two tablespoons, one set of measuring spoons, one 
wire basket or several yards of cheese-cloth for use in 
blanching, six wiping cloths, two hand towels, one 
duplex fork for lifting hot jars, several sharp paring 
knives, a generous supply of clean hot and cold water, 
a garbage pail for scraps, and a good stove or other 
heating device. 

For processing, home canners may choose from among 

several types of apparatus, according to their needs 

and means. The outfits in common use are of five 

general types: 

1. Homemade Outfits 

Homemade outfits are constructed of such utensils 
as wash boilers, tin pails, milk cans, metal washtubs, 
and lard pails. Such canners should have well-fitting 
covers and false bottoms or lifting platforms of metal 
or wood. The latter are to support jars or cans to 
prevent direct contact with heat and also to permit a 
free circulation of water and steam around and under 
the containers. 



252 ADVICE TO THE HOUSEWIFE 

8. Hot-water-b«th Commercial Outflts 

Hot-water-bath commercial outfits are constructed 
usually for outdoor work, and have a sterilizing vat, 
lifting trays, fire box, and smoke pipe, combined in 
one piece. They are light and convenient, and are 
planned as portable outfits. The products should 
be sterilized in such outfits in completely sealed tin 
cans or partially sealed glass jars immersed in boiling 
water. The only advantage of these outfits over the 
homemade devices is that they are more convenient 
and have all the necessary equipment for operation. 
Both the homemade and hot-water commercial canners 
are classed as hot-water-bath outfits. 

8. Water-seal Outfits 

Water-seal outfits consist of a double-walled bath 
(a) and cover (6) which projects down into the water 
between the outer and inner walls, thus making three 
tin or galvanized metal walls, and two water jackets 
between the sterilizing vat and outer surface of the 
canner. A higher temperature may be maintained 
more uniformly with such an outfit than with the hot- 
water-bath outfits, since the free escape of steam is 
prevented and a slight steam pressure is maintained. 
The water-seal outfit may prove more economical of 
heat, especially in the canning of vegetables and meats, 
where high temperatures are necessary for complete 
sterilization. 

4. Steam-pressure Outfits 

Steam-pressure outfits are made to carry from 5 to 30 
pounds of steam pressure, and are equipped with a 
steam-tight sterilizer, Ufting crate, thermometer or 
pressure gauge, safety valve, and steam pet cock. The 



ONE-PERIOD, CX)LD-PACK CANNING 253 

pressure canner may be regulated easily so as to main- 
tain different temperatures. It is thus adaptable for 
118^ in sterilizing various vegetables and food products. 

5. Aluminum Pressure Cookers 

Aluminum pressure cookers are combination out- 
fits for general cooking purposes wMch are used also 
for home canning of fruits, vegetables, and meats. 
They may be used for canning during the canning sea- 
son and as cookers during the entire year. As a type, 
these pressure cookers are light in construction and 
economical of heat. They are made entirely of alumi- 
num and will carry as high as 30 pounds steam pressure. 
They are equipped with a steam-pressure gauge, safety 
valve, and pet cock, as are steam-pressure outfits. 

Operation of Hot-water Bath and Water-seal Outfits 

Difficulties in the operation of hot-water bath canning 
outfits may be avoided if the following rules are 
observed: 

(1) Support the jars on a perforated platform suf- 

ficiently to permit the circulation of water 
under and around the jars. 

(2) Have the water cover the tops of the jars by 

at least 1 inch. 

(3) Count time as soon as the water begins to boil 

vigorously. 

(4) Remove the jars from the water and tighten 

the covers as soon as the time is up. 

Liquid may be lost from the jars during the steriliz- 
ing period if the water in the canner does not cover 
the tops of the jars, if the covers to the jars are adjusted 
too loosely, or if the platform in the bottom of the 



254 ADVICE TD THE BOTJSEWIFE 

canner does not permit the water to circulate under- 
neath. Towels, excelsior, newspapers, hay, and the 
like are unsatisfactory for use in the bottoms of hot- 
water-bath outfis. Use a slat or perforated platform. 

Operation of Steam-pressure Csnners 

To secure the best results in the operation of steam- 
pressure canners, the following precautions should be 
observed: 

(1) Place each jar in hot water or in the canner as 

soon as packed. 

(2) Have the water come to the platform, but not 

above it; add hot water occasionally to pre- 
vent its boiling dry. 

(3) Have the canner absolutely steam-tight. 

(4) When the canner has been filled, fasten the 

opposite clamps moderately tight; thentigjiten 
each pair of clamps fully. 
(6) Allow the pet cock to remain open untU live 
steam escapes from it. 

(6) Close the pet cock completely. 

(7) Force the pressure to the required point before 

counting time. 

(8) Maintain a uniform pressure during the sterilizing 

period. This may be done by turning down 
gas or oil flame or moving canner off the 
stove partially. 

(9) Allow the canner to cool until the steam gauge 

registers zero before opening the pet cock. 

(10) Remove the jars from the canner and tighten 

the lids as soon as the canner is opened. 

Liquid will be lost from jars during the sterilizing 
period ff steam leaks at the joint and around the fit- 
tings; a the pressure is allowed to fluctuate, as by 



0NE-PERI0D,1 OOLD-PACK CANNING 255 

running up to 12 pounds, down to 7 pounds, and back 
to 10 pounds; if steam is allowed to blow from the 
pet cock during or at the close of the steriUzing period; 
if a vacuum forms in the canner; or if the wire bails 
on the glass-top jars are so loose that they will not go 
in with a snap. 

Containers 

The method of canning here described does not re- 
quire the use of a particular type of container. Glass 
jars, crockery jars (with air-tight tops) or tin cans 
of practically any type may be used if they are care- 
fully cleaned and properly handled and sealed. When 
products are canned for use in the home, glass jars are 
perhaps preferable to tin cans. Jars may be sealed 
without the use of special apparatus and may be 
used over and over again if properly taken care of and 
if new rubbers are used each time. Tin cans, on the 
other hand, must be thrown away after being opened. 

Tin cans, however, have certain advantages. They 
exclude Ught and so prevent bleaching, and they 
may be handled, packed, and transported more 
safely then glass jars. When products are canned 
for sale, tin cans are preferable except for local use in 
some sections and for fancy trade. 

The use of specific types of containers and the neces- 
sary steps to be taken in testing, preparing, sealing, 
cooUng, and storing them are discussed in an appendix 
to this bulletin.

Legal Restrictions upon the Sale of ^Canned Products 

If home-canned products are to be sold, certain 
legal restrictions which are placed upon the sale of 
canned goods must be observed. If they are to be sold 
wholly within the State, information concerning the 
State food laws should be obtained by writing to the 
State Food Commissioners or the State Board of Health. 
If the products are to be shipped in interstate commerce, 
information should also be obtained concerning Fed- 
eral laws and regulations by writing to the Bureau of 
Chemistry, United States Department of Agriculture, 
Washington, D. C. Products made and sold wholly 
within the District of Columbia or the Territories are 
also subject to the Federal Food and Drugs Act. 

Altitude Changes and Home Canning 

The directions given in this bulletin for canning all 
kinds of vegetables, fruits, soups, meats, and combina- 
tions are based upon an altitude from sea level to 1,000 
feet and upon the use of the quart jar or container. If 



ONE-PERIOD, COLD-PACK CANNING 



257 



using smaller jars, reduce the time a trifle; if using 
larger jars, increase the time. 

For altitudes above 1,000 feet the time of steriliza- 
tion should be increased at the rate of 10 per cent for 
each 500 feet. 

Brines 

Brines of various strengths are used in canning some 
vegetables. The table following shows the propor- 
tions of salt and water required to make brines of 
given percentage strengths.

Seasoning 

In seasoning f oods'it should be kept in mind that most 
vegetables as well as meats are injured in flavor and 
quaUty by an excessive use of salt for seasoning in the 
canning process. A little salt is very palatable, and 
its use should be encouraged, but it is better to add no 
salt in canning than to use too much. Salt can be 
added to suit the taste when canned goods are served. 

Sirups 

Sirups are employed usually in canning fruits. A 
formula much used in some sections for sirup is 3 quarts 



258 ADVICE TO THE HOUSEWIFE 

of fiugar to 2 quarts of water, boiled to a thin, meditim- 
thin, medium-thick, or thick sirup. The formula 
sometimes called the Eastern formula is 3 quarts of 
water to 2 quarts of sugar, boiled to a thin, medium* 
thin, medium-thick, or thick sirup. The iBirst formula 
may be used in canning all kinds of fruits delicate 
in flavor and texture and when sugar is low or reason* 
able in price. When sugar is high in price and the 
character of the fruit is such that less sugar is required, 
the Eastern, formula may be used. 

Sirups of the approximate densities desired may be 
made easily without regard to the table of sirup densi- 
ties already given, and without the use of an instru- 
ment for determining density if the following points 
are kept in mind: 

Thin sirup is sugar and water boiled sufliciently to 
dissolve all of the sugar, but is not sticky. Such sirup 
has a density of from 12 to 20 per cent. 

Medium-thin sirup is that which has begun to thicken 
and becomes sticky when cooled on the finger 
tip or spoon (density of from 20 to 40 per cent). 
Medium-thick sirup is that which has thickened 
enough to roll or pile up over the edge of the 
spoon when it is poured out (density of from 40 
to 50 per cent). 
Thick sirup is that which has become so thick that 
it is difficult to pour out of a spoon or container, 
but is not sugared . (density of from 60 to 64 per 
cent). 
Thin sirups are used for all sweet fruits such as cher- 
ries, peaches, apples, etc., that are not too delicate 
in texture and color. Medium-thin sirups are used 
in the canning of the medium-sweet fruits, such as 
blackberries, currants, dewberries, huckleberries, rasp- 



ONE-PERIOD, CX)LD-PACK CANNING 



259 



berries, etc. Medium-thick sirups are used in the can- 
ning of all sour fruits, such as gooseberries, apricots, 
sour apples, etc., and deUcately colored fruits, such as 
strawberries and red raspberries. Thick sirup is used 
in preserving and making all kinds of sun-cooked pre- 
serves. 

How to Determine Sirup Density 

Unsatisfactory results frequently follow the use of 
sirups which are not of the density best suited to the 
particular purpose for which they are employed. The 
following table gives the proportions of sugar and water 
required to prepare sirup of the desired density. 
No allowance has been made for evaporation during 
heating.

Canning Fruit without Sugar 

All fruits can be canned successfully for future use, 
for jelly making, pie filling, salad purposes, etc., without 
the use of sugar by simply adding hot water instead of 
the hot sirups. It has been found practicable also with 
certain vegetables to substitute sugar for salt in the 
canning process, and then add other seasoning to taste 
when serving. 



260 ADVICE TO THE HOUSEWIFE 

In canning fruit without sugar, can the product the 
day it is picked. Cull, stem, seed, and clean fruit by 
placing in strainer and pouring cold water over it. 
Pack the product carefully in hot glass jars or tin cans 
until full. Use tablespoon, wooden ladle, or table knife 
for packing purposes. Pour boiling hot water over 
the product in the hot jar. Place rubbers and caps 
in position, not tight. If using tin cans, seal completely. 
Place product in the steriUzer, vat, or canner, and ster- 
ilize for the length of time given below according to 
the particular type of outfit used: 

Mintttes. 

Hot-water bath, homemade or commercial 30

After steriUzing remove the filled containers. Seal 
jars; invert to cool and test the joints. Wrap in paper 
to prevent bleaching and store in a dry, cool place. 
If tin cans are used it will be found advantageous to 
plunge them into cold water immediately after sterihza- 
tion to cool them quickly.

Com seems to give home canners more trouble than do most 
products; but, with care and study, com may be canned as 



262 ADVICE TO THE HOUSEWIFE 

easily as any other product grown in the garden. A little 
experience in selecting the ear and the ability to recognise com 
that is just between the milk and the dough stage are important. 
Cut the com from the cob with a. sharp, thin-bladed knife, and 
pack it at once into sterilized jars. Best results can be obtained 
when one person cuts the com from the cob and one person 
fills the containers. If it is necessary for one person to work 
alone he should cut off sufficient com to fill one jar, pour on 
boiling water, add salt, place the rubber and the cap in posi- 
tion, and put the jar into the canner or hot water at once. 
Com expands a little in processing, and for this reason jars 
should not be filled quite full. Com that has reached the 
dough stage before being packed wiU have a cheecfy appearance 
after canning. Corn should never be allowed to remain in the 
cold-dip water, and large quantities should not be dipped at 
one time imless sufficient help is available to handle the pro- 
duct quickly. Water-logged or soaked com indicates slow and 
inefficient packing. 

When canning sweet com on the cob, follow same directions 
but pack whole ears in jars instead of the cut-off com. 

Home Canning of Field Com. This product is commonly 
known as com club breakfast food, or 4-H brand food product. 
The corn should be selected between the milk and the dough 
stage. Wide-mouthed glass jars or tin cans should be used for 
canning this product. Avoid packing container too full, as the 
product swells during the sterilization period. The corn 
should be canned the same day it is picked from the field, if 
possible. The yellow field com makes a yellow, butter-Hke 
food product when ground and canned. Avoid mixing the 
white and the yellow or Bloody Butcher com in the same batch 
of food products. Secure a good grade of food chopper for 
grating the com. Small 10-cent hand graters can be used, but 
work with these is too slow and tedious. 

Blanch the com ears in boiling hot water or live steam for 
10 minutes. Bemove and dip quickly in cold water. Cut 
the corn from the cob with a sharp, thin-bladed knife. Feed 
the com to the food chopper and grind to a pulp. Cook this 
product in a kettle, add one level teaspoonful of salt to each 
quart, and a little butter, and sweeten a trifle with sugar. Cook 
(stir while cooking) until the product has assumed a thickened 
or paste-like mass. Then pack this product immediately in

Mushrooms, Caution: Unless you are absolutdy sure that 
you know a mushroom when you see it, do not run the risk of gather^ 
ing and using for food what you think are mushrooms. A large 
numbers of persons are poisoned every year because of carelessness 
in this regard. Many very poisonous plants closely resemble 
edible mushrooms. Can mushrooms immediately after picking; 
if aUowed to stand they become unfit for iLse. (See Farmers* 
Bulletin 796, Some Common Edible and Poisonous Mushrooms.) 

Wash and trim the mushrooms. If small, can them whole; 
if large, they may be cut into sections. Blanch the mushrooms 
in boiling water 5 minutes. Remove and plunge them quickly 
into very cold water. Pack in hot glass jars and add boiling 
water to cover; add one level teaspoonful of salt to the quart.

How to Prevent the Fading of Beets. Small beets that run 
40 to the quart are the most suitable size for first-class packs. 
The older the beet the more chance there is for loss of color. 
When preparing the beet, leave on 1 inch of the stem and all 
of the tail while blanching. Blanch not more than 5 minutes, 
and cold-dip. The skin should be scraped from the beet, not 
peeled. Beets should be packed whole, if possible. Well- 
canned beets will show a slight loss of color when removed from 
the canner, but will brighten up in a few days. 
\' Greens or Potherbs. A large number of cultivated and wild 
greens are edible, and if canned by this method will make a 
succulent and valuable food for the winter and spring months. 



266 ADVICE TO THE HOUSEWIFE 

Among the cultivated greens are Swiss chard, kale, Chinese 
cabbage leaves, upland cress, French endive, cabbage sprouts, 
turnip tops, young tender New Zealand spinach, beet tops, 
dandelion, young tender dasheen sprouts, native mustard, 
Russian mustard, collards, and tender rape leaves. Among the 
wild greens are pepper cress, lamb's quarter, sour dock, smart- 
weed, sprouts, purslane, or " pusley," pokeweed sprouts, 
dandelion, marsh marigold, wild mustard, and milkweed 
(tender sprouts and young leaves). 

Can greens the day they are picked. Wash clean, sort thor- 
oughly, allowing no foreign weed leaves or other vegetable 
matter to remain. Rid the greens of all sand, dirt, dry and 
decayed or diseased leaves. Place the greens in a crate or 
cheese-cloth, and blanch in live steam, either in an improvised 
homemade steamer or a regular commercial steamer for 15 min- 
utes. Remove the greens and plunge quickly into cold water. 
Place on the table and cut into convenient lengths. Pack 
tight in hot jars or tin cans. Add hot water to fill the container, 
and season to taste. The product will be slightly improved 
if a few strips of boiled bacon or chipped beef are added. A 
little olive oil also improves the flavor. If using glass jars, 
place rubbers and tops in position; partially seal. If using 
tin cans, cap and tip completely. Sterilize for the length of

grapes, huckleberries, peaches, plums, raspberries, and straw- 
berries. 

After hulling, seeding, stemming, or skinning the fruit, place 
fruit in a strainer and rinse by pouring cold water over it. 



268 ADVICE TO THE HOUSEWIFE 

Pack from strainer into hot jars or cans without crushins^ 
using big spoon or ladle. Hot sirup previously prepared should 
be poured over the fruit at once. Before packing a second jar, 
place rubbers and caps in position, not tight. If using tin cans, 
seal completely. Enameled tin cans should be used for all highly 
acid berries. Sterilize for the length of time given below for

Another Recipe for Strawberries. Canned by this recipe, 
strawberries will not rise to the top of the sirup. Use only 
fresh, ripe, firm, and soimd berries. Prepare them and add 8 
ounces of sugar and 2 tablespoonsful of water to each quart of 
berries. Boil slowly for 15 minutes in an enameled or acid- 
proof kettle. Allow the berries to cool and remain several 
hours or overnight in the covered kettle. Pack the cold berries 
in hot glass jars or enameled tin cans. Put the rubbers and 
caps of jars in position, not tight. Cap and tip tin cans. Ster-

Apple-pie Filling. The only difference between the canning 
of apples for pie filling and canning them whole, as by the direc- 
tions above, is that the apples should be sliced immediately 
after paring into cold, slightly salted water. It will be found 
desirable to can first-grade apples either whole or quartered 
and second-grade apples sliced for use for pie filling. Second- 
grade apples and products prepared from poor stock should not 
be sold, of course, without labels which make the grade plain. 

Fruit Juices 

The fruit juice may be pressed out of fruit by means of a cider 
press, special fruit press, or other improvised presses; then 
heated in an acid-proof kettle up to 110** F. The fruit juice 
may then be poured into ordinary hot jars, hot bottles, or tin 
cans, and handled by the same directions as those for canning 



270 ADVICE TO THE HOUSEWIFE 

of fruit itself. If poured into miscellaneous bottles, it is sug- 
gested that the fruit juice be sterilized as follows: 

Make -a cotton stopper and press into the neck of the bottle 
and leave during the sterilization period. Set bottles in boiling 
hot water up to the neck of the bottle, sterilize the fruit juioe 
for 40 minutes at a temperature of 165^ F. Remove the prod- 
uct, press cork in top over cotton stopper immediately. If the 
cork fits well, no paraffin need be used. If it is a poor cork, it 
may be necessary to dip the cork in a melted solution of wax 
or paraffin. Fruit juices and apple cider when handled in this 
way will not " flatten in taste " and will keep fresh for future 
use. 

Simp Made from Windfall Apples and Apple Cider > 

Add 5 ounces of powdered calcium carbonate to 7 gallons of 
apple cider. Powdered calcium carbonate (carbonate of lime), 
or to give it its common name, precipitated chalk, is low-priced 
and harmless. Boil the mixture in a kettle or vat vigorously 
for 5 minutes. Pour the liquid into vessels, preferably glass 
jars or pitchers; allow to stand 6 or 8 hours, or until perfectly 
clear. Pour the clear liquid into a preserving kettle. Do not 
allow sediment at bottom to enter. Add to the clear liquid one 
level tablespoonful of lime carbonate, and stir thoroughly. 
The process is completed by boiling down rapidly to a clear 
liquid. Use density gauge or candy, thermometer and bring 
the temperature up to 220** F. If a thermometer is not avail- 
able, boil until bulk is reduced to one-seventh of the original 
volume. To determine whether the sirup is cooked enough, 
test as for candy — by pouring a little into cold water. If boiled 
enough it should have the consistency of maple sirup. It 
should not be cooked long enough to harden like candy when 
tested. 

When the test shows that the sirup has been cooked enough, 
pour it into fruit jars, pitchers, etc., and allow it to cool slowly. 
Slow cooling is important, as otherwise the suspended matter 
will not settle properly and the sirup will be cloudy. 

A good way to insure slow cooling is to stand the vessel, full 
of sirup, in a bucket or a wash boiler of hot water or to place them 
in a fireless cooker. The white sediment which settles out

ONE-PERIOD, COLD-PACK CANNING 271 

during cooking is called ** malate of lime ** and is a harmless 
compound of lime with the natural acid of the apple. When 
the sirup is cooled, it should be stored in fruit jars, bottles, or 
jugs and crocks. Place the rubber and cap or cotton stopper 
or cork in position, and tighten. Place the container in boiling 
hot water and sterilize for the length of time given below for 
the particular type of outfit used:

Remove jars and tighten covers. Invert to cool, and test the 
joints. Store for future use. This recipe is for making sirup 
primarily for home consumption. If the product is to be sold, 
legal requirements as to labehng should be ascertained and 
complied with. 

Preserves 

The one-period, cold-pack method of canning will be found 
especially helpful in eliminating the necessity of using paraffin 
or other wax tops for jellies, jams, and preserves. Three recipes 
and directions for canning jellies, jams, and preserves by this 
method follow to illustrate the application of the method. The 
use of containers with screw tops is recommended for these 
products. This will make unnecessary the expense and trouble 
of using paraffin, and will make the melting, molding, and 
deterioration of the top parts of the packs less likely. 

Strawberry. Make a sirup of 1 quart of water and 11 poimds 
of sugar and cook it in an open kettle until the usual temperature 
for making candies, jeUies, etc., is reached. If a candy ther- 
mometer is used cook the preserves until they reach a tem- 
perature of 265° F. A candy thermometer resigters 265** P. 
when placed in the sirup. Add 8 pounds of berries to the sirup. 
Cook very slowly, just at the boiling point. Stop the cooking 
when the thermometer registers 219** F. and pour into shallow 
pans to cool. Hasten the cooling by pouring sirup over the 
berries. Skim while cooking. Fill into hot jars. Put the rub- 
ber and cap in position, not tight. Cap and tip if using enameled 
tin cans. Sterilize for the length of time give^ below for the

Vegetables for Soup 

If it is impracticable to obtain materials for making soup 
stock in the summer when vegetables are abundantly available, 
the vegetable portion of the soup may be canned alone. The 
preparation of soup from cans of such vegetable combinations 
will be a relatively simple matter whenever stock is available, 
as it should be in most households if meat refuse is properly 
utilized. 

Soak 6 pounds of lima beans and 4 pounds of dry peas over 
night. Boil each i hour. Blanch 16 pounds of carrots, 6

Meats 

While meats may be canned successfully if directions 
are followed carefully, it is perhaps advisable for 
beginners in canning to start with vegetables and fruits, 
taking up the canning of meats only after thorough 
famiUarity with the process described in this bulletin 
has been acquired. If canned meat products are to 
be offered for sale through interstate shipment, inquiry 
should be made of the United States Department of 
Agriculture and State food regulating agencies in regard 
to the steps which must be taken to comply with the 
United States meat-inspection regulations and local 
laws.

All vegetables, meats, and other food products used in the soup 
combinations should be prepared and treated prior to steriliza- 
tion in the same way as when canned separately, and then 
mixed, packed, and thoroughly sterilized. 

This time schedule is based upon the 1-quart pack and upon 
fresh products at altitudes up to 1,000 feet. For higher alti- 
tudes, increase the time 10 per cent for each additional 500

When processing fruits in steam-pressure canners, not oyer 
5 pounds of steam pressure should be used. 

When processing vegetables, do not use over 15 pounds of 
pressure. 



< Special Canning Precautions and Suggestions 

I Mold on Canned Goods 



I Mold may develop on canned goods if the seal is 

J defective; if , after sterilizing, the tops are removed from 

I the jars to replace the rubber rings; and if the jars are 

kept in a damp place where the rubbers may decompose. 



I Shrinkage during Sterilization 

' Shrinkage may occur during sterilization because 

of improper and insufficient blanching and cold-dipping, 
careless packing, poor grading, sterilizing for too long 
a period, or lack of jugdment in the amount and size 
of product put into the container. 

BUachlng Greens 

The proper way to blanch all greens or potherbs is 
in a steamer or in a vessel improvised to do the blanch- 
ing in steam above the water line. If this is done, 
a high percentage of mineral salts and volatile oil is 
retained in the product. 

Spedal Requirements of Com, Peas, Beans, and Asi»aragu8 

Canned corn, peas, beans, and asparagus may show 
no signs of spoilage and still when opened have a sour

288 'ADVICE TO THE HOUSEWIFE 

taste and a disagreeable odor. This specific trouble is 
known to the canner as '' flat-sour/' and can be avoided 
if the canner will use fresh product, that is, one which 
has not been gathered more than 5 or 6 hours, and will 
blanch, cold-dip, and pack one jar of product at a time, 
and place each jar in the canner as it is packed. The 
first jar in will not be affected by the extra cooking. 
When the steam-pressure canner is used the jars or 
cans may be placed in the retort, the cover placed 
in position, but not clamped down until the retort is 
filled. Rapid cooling of these products prevents over- 
cooking, clarifies the liquid, and preserves the shape 
and texture. 

APPENDIX 
Handling and Sealing Containers 



Glass Jsrs 

Glass jars of several types are available for use in 
home canning. The types in most general use, how- 
ever, are those with metal screw-tops, those with 
glass and spring-tops, and those with suction seal tops. 
While large-necked bottles and jars not provided with 
sealing tops can not be used for canning, they can be 
used as containers for preserves, marmalades, jellies, 
and other fruit preparations in which heavy or thick 
sirups are used. Such jars can be capped with paper 
and paraffin, or, in the case of jellies and stiff mar- 
malades, with paraffin alone. 

Before food to be canned is prepared for packing, 
jars should be tested, washed, and placed in a vessel 
of cool water on a stove to heat. The jars should be 
kept hot in the water imtil needed for packing. To 



ONE-PERIOD, COLD-PACK CANNING 289 

test screw-top jars, place the top on the jar without a 
rubber, and screw down tight. If a case knife can be 
inserted easily between the top and the glass, the top 
usually is defective. Another test is to screw the top 
down lightly on a rubber and pull the rubber from 
its position. If, when released, the rubber ring returns 
to its position between the top and the jar, the top is 
defective. 

If a glass top, placed on a jar without a rubber, rocks 
when pressed, it is defective. The wire bails which hold 
glass tops in place should go on with a snap even when 
the tightening lever on the clamp spring is up. If the 
bail is not tight it should be removed from the tighten- 
ing lever and bent until it fits tightly. This tightening 
of the bail should be done every year. 

Only good, elastic rubber rings should be used. Prac- 
tically this means new rubbers, as rubbers seldom 
will stand use a second time. The product to be canned 
should be placed in jars while the jars are hot. Rub- 
bers and tops should then be put in place, but the 
sealing levers should not be tightened until after proc- 
essing. 

Glass jars, of course, must be handled carefully to 
prevent breakage. Hot jars should not be brought into 
contact with cold metal, stone, or water, or placed in a 
draft of cold air. Cold jars should not be placed in 
hot water, nor have hot Uquids poured into them. The 
wire bails of glass-top jars should not be so tight that 
the tops will be crushed when the levers are pressed 
down in sealing. 

Crockery Jars 

^ Several types of crockery jars which have rubber 
top and clamp spring adjustment for seaUng hermetic- 



290 ADVICE TO THE HOUSEWIFE 

ally may be purchased. These jars, in sizes ranging 
from 1 pint to 1 gallon, may be used successfully in 
connection with the one-period, cold-pack method of 
canning. They should be handled in the same man- 
ner as are the clamp-spring, glass-top jars. Crockery 
jars should be washed with special care since they 
do not show the presence of dirt as do glass jars. 
They should be heated thoroughly before they are 
filled with food products. 

For all packs in crockery jars of more than 1 quart 
size, the time for steriHzation should be increased 
10 to 20 per cent over the steriHzation period scheduled 
for glass jars of the same size. 

This is necessary because the crockery jars will 
not transmit heat as rapidly as the thin glass jars or 
tin cans. On the other hand, they do not cool as 
rapidly as do the glass jars, thus giving the product 
a Uttle longer period under high temperature. It is 
also possible when using crockery jars to plunge 
them into cold water a short while (but not immedi- 
ately) after removal from the steriUzer in order to 
effect the rapid cooling of the product. When this 
rapid cooling system is used it will not be necessary 
to increase the time required for cooking. 

Tin Cans 

Most products may be packed in plain tin cans. 
A few products, however, should be packed in enameled 
cans in which the enamel prevents the products from 
acting chemically on the tin coating of the container. 
Enameled cans should be used for greens, beets, 
strawberries, cherries, pumpkin, squash, fish, poultry, 
and meat. 

Tin cans are practicable for the home canning of 



ONE-PERIOD, COLD-PACK CANNING 291 

fruits, vegetables, greens, soups, and meats, and their 
use is considered by many persons to simplify the opera- 
tion and make possible the accomplishment of more 
work in a given time. Products packed in tin cans 
are handled easily in transportation and storage. 

SIZES OF TIN CANS 

Several standard sizes of tin cans are in common 
use for home canning purposes and may be had in 
either sanitary or cap-and-hole type: 

NUMBER, SIZE, AND DIAMETER OF OPENINGS OF 

TIN CANS 

No. of Sise of Can Diameter of Openinc 

Can. (Inches). (Inches).

2 2AX4A 2A or 2^ 

3.... 4i X4J 2Aor2A 

10 6AX6J 2A or 2A 

TYPES OF TIN CANS 

There are two general types of cans on the market 
that are used as containers for food. 

The sanitary or rim-seal can consists of can and cover 
pressed into a definite shape. That part of the cover 
that comes in contact with the can is coated with a 
compound or fitted with a rubber film, paper gasket, 
or ring that makes a perfect seal when the cover is 
crimped on the can. The seal can be made only with 
a machine constructed for the purpose. No heat or 
solder is required to make the seal. 

Special Rimrseal Cans. Several types of rim-seal 
cans differ from the ordinary sanitary can in con- 
struction. They are made for use in special machines. 

Cap^nd-hole Tin Cans. The cap-and-hole can con- 



292 ADVICE TO THE HOUSEWIFE 

sists of a can and cover. The cover carries a rim of 
solder. The cap is fastened on the can by the appli- 
cation of heat, as described later. 

USE OF MBGHANICAIi SEALERS FOB SAmTART OB BIM-SEAL CAUB 

In canning in tin cans to be sealed with mechanical 
sealers, the recipe is followed as for glass jars, and the 
boiling water or sirup poured over the product. The 
can should be sealed immediately after the boiling 
liquid is added. Two distinct operations are required 
to seal either the sanitary or the rim-seal can. When 
the can is placed in the machine and clamped into 
position the first roll is applied, while the can is re- 
volved. This operation should be continued until 
the cover is locked into position on the can and the 
lap joint made. The second roll is then applied and 
the can revolved to close the joint and thus hermetic- 
ally seal the can. These mechanical sealers are adjust- 
able to handle No. 2, No. 2|, No. 3, and No. 10 sani- 
tary cans. Complete instructions are furnished with 
the machines. 

TESTING JOINT OB SEAIi 

To determine if the machine is adjusted properly, 
place three or four tablespoonfuls of water in a can, and 
seal. Hold the sealed can under the surface of hot 
water for three minutes. If air bubbles rise from the 
can, it indicates that the seal has not been made 
properly. Special rim-seal cans should be handled 
according to instructions of the manufacturer. 

SEALING CANS 

When tin cans are used as containers they are sealed 
by soldering, or, if of the " sanitary " type, by me- 



ONE-PERIOD, COLD-PACK CANNING 293 

chanical sealing machines, as described above. Cans 
must be sealed before they are processed. If solder 
is used, the equipment required includes a capping 
iron, a tipping copper, soldering flux, a small brush, 
a porcelain, glass, or stoneware cup in which to keep 
the soldering flux, sal ammoniac, a few scraps of zinc, 
solder, a soft brick for poUshing irons, and a file. 
If a hand sealing machine and solderless cans are 
use(}, all other equipment and material are unneces- 
sary. 

)f Soldering Flux. Soldering flux is a solution of zinc 
in crude muriatic acid. It is used for cleaning the 
irons , and for brushing the tin and solder surfaces, 
so that the solder will adhere to the tin. It may be 
made as follows: Place 2 or 3 ounces of muriatic acid 
(purchased at a drug store) in a porcelain, stoneware, 
or glass jar and add as much sheet zinc in small pieces 
as the acid will dissolve; when the zinc has dissolved, 
dilute the solution to twice its quantity with water 
and strain through a piece of cloth. Flux is always best 
when it has stood at least 12 to 16 hours before being 
used. Keep the flux well mixed and free from dust and 
dirt. Care should be taken not to spill the flux on 
clothing. 

Soldering flux ready for use may be purchased at 
some drug stores and hardware stores. Sometimes 
a powdered rosin is used as a substitute for the flux. 
Recently a soldering paste has been manufactured 
^Aieh is desirable for use in canning work, because 
it is convenient and clean to handle. 

Tinning the Capping Iron. Clean the iron with a 
file, brick, or knife; heat it sufficiently to melt a little 
solder in the sal ammoniac (5 or 10 cents' worth pur- 
chased at a drug store) ; then place the iron in the mix- 



294 ADVICE TO THE HOUSEWIFE 

ture of sal ammoniac and solder, and rotate it until the 
soldering edge of the iron is thoroughly covered with 
the solder. 

Tinning the Tipping Capper. The tipping copper is 
tinned in much the same way as the capping iron. 
Sometimes it is desirable, however, to file the tipping 
copper sufficiently to make it smooth and to correct 
the point. The copper should be filed to nearly a 
sharp point. All particles of smudge, burned materials, 
etc., should be removed from the iron before tinning. 
Heat the copper and rotate the tip of it in the mixture 
of sal ammoniac and solder, until it has been covered 
with the melted solder and is as bright as silver. 

When capping the full cans, arrange them in rows 
upon the table while the capping and tipping irons 
are in the fire heating. Take a handful of solder- 
hemmed caps and place the caps on all cans ready to 
be capped. Place a finger on the venthole, hold the 
cap in place, and run the brush containing a emsB, 
amount of flux around the solder-hemmed cap, evenly, 
with one stroke of the hand. Be careful not to get 
the flux inside of the can. Do this with all cans ready 
to be capped. Then take the capping iron from the 
fire, and insert the upright steel in the center. Hold 
the capping iron above the cap until the center rod 
touches the cap and holds it in place. Then bring 
the cap down in contact with all four points of the 
solder*hemmed cap, and rotate back and forth about 
three strokes. Do not bear down on the capping 
iron. A forward and backwdxd rotation, if properly 
applied, will solder the cap in place perfectly. Remove 
the capping iron and inspect the joint. If any pin- 
holes are found, recap or repair with the tipping cop- 
per. It may be necessary to use a piece of wire solder 



ONE-PERIOD, COLD-PACK CANNING 295 

or a waste solder rim from a cap to add more solder 
to the broken places or pinholes of a cap. 

Tipping a Tin Can. With the flux jar and brush 
conveniently at hand, dip the brush in the flux and 
strike the venthole a side stroke lightly with the brush 
saturated with flux. Place the point of the wire solder 
over the venthole. Place upon this the point of the 
hot, bright, tipping copper. Press down with a rotary 
motion and remove quickly. (If a waste solder- 
hemmed cap rim is available, this may be used instead 
of the wire solder.) 

With a Uttle practice a smooth, perfect joint is 
easily made. 

SUGGESTIONS ON ORDERING TIN CANS 

In buying hole-and-cap cans it always is necessary 
to state whether you desire plain tin or enameled 
(lacquered) cans. In bu3ring caps always ask for sol- 
der-hemmed caps and give the diameter of the can 
opening. For whole fruits and vegetables, cans with 
2i^inch or even larger openings are preferable. Since 
the size of the can opening varies, and ordinarily it 
will not be advisable to have more than one capping 
iron, it is recommended that the larger size (23^-inch) 
capping iron be purchased.

DRYING FRUITS AND VEGETABLES IN THE 

HOME 

With Recipes for Cooking 



INTRODUCTION 

One of the most prominent features of the food con- 
servation program of European countries has been the 
universal drying of fruits and vegetables. The sur- 
plus vegetables in the city markets were forced by the 
Governments into large municipal drying plants. 
Community driers were established in the trucking 
regions, and even itinerant drying machines were sent 
from farm to farm, drjring the vegetables which other- 
wise would have gone to waste. In addition, large 
quantities of dried vegetables from Canada and this 
country were shipped to France during the last two 
years, and there is a possibility that dried fruits and 
vegetables may continue to be shipped abroad in con- 
siderable quantities, to supplement the concentrated 
food diet of the men in the trenches. 

The dr3dng of vegetables may seem strange to the 
present generation, but to our grandmothers it was no 
novelty. Many housewives even to-day prefer dried 

296 



DRYING FRUITS AND VEGETABLES 297 

sweet com to the product canned by the old method, 
and say also that dried pumpkin and squash are ex- 
cellent for pie making. Snap beans often are strung 
on threads and dried above the stove. Cherries and 
raspberries still are dried on bits of bark for use instead 
of raisins. In fact, many of the everyday foodstuffs 
already are dried at some stage of their preparation 
for market. The common dried fruits, such as prunes, 
raisins, figs, dates, and apples, are staples in the 
world's markets, while beans and other legumes, 
tea, coffee, cocoa, and various manufactured foods, 
like starch, tapioca, macaroni, etc., are dried either in 
the sun and wind or in specially constructed driers. 

Even though the drying of fruits and vegetables 
as practiced a few decades ago on many farms has 
become practically a " lost art/' the present food 
situation doubtless will cause a marked stimulation 
of drying as a means of conserving the food supply. 
This country is producing large quantities of perish- 
able foods this year, which should be saved for storage, 
canned, or properly dried. Drying is not a panacea 
for the entire waste evil, nor should it take the place 
of storing or canning to any considerable extent where 
proper storage faciUties are available or tin cans or 
glass jars can be obtained readily and at a low cost. 

The advantages of drying vegetables are not so appar- 
ent for the farm home as they are for the town or city 
household, which has no root cellar or other place in 
which to store fresh vegetables. For the farmer's 
wife the new methods of canning probably will be better 
than sun drying, which requires a somewhat longer 
time. But shorter methods of dr3dng are available, 
and the dried product holds an advantage in that 
usually it requires fewer jars, cans, or other containers 



298 ADVICE TO THE HOUSEWIFE 

than do canned fruits or vegetables; also dried material 
can be stored in receptacles which can not be used for 
canning. Then, too, canned fruit and vegetables 
freeze and can not be shipped as conveniently in winter. 
Dried vegetables can be compacted and shipped with 
a minimum of risk. 

To the housewife in the town the drying of vegetables 
and fruits presents special advantages. During the 
season when the market is oversupplied locally and 
prices are low she can lay in a stock, dry it, and put 
it away for a winter's emergency without its taking up 
much of the needed small storage space in her home. 
If she is accustomed to canning her fruit and vegetables 
and finds she can not secure jars or tin cans, she can 
easily resort to drying. 

With simple and inexpensive facilities, all house- 
wives can save quantities of food which are too small 
conveniently to can. A few sweet potatoes or apples 
or peas or even a single turnip can be dried and saved. 
Even when very small quantities are dried at a time, 
a quantity sufficient for a meal will soon be secured. 
Small lots of several dried vegetables, such as cabbage, 
carrots, turnips, potatoes, and onions, can be com- 
bined to advantage for soups and stews. 

This bulletin records some of the points brought 
out in a preUminary investigation of the home drsring 
of fruits and vegetables which has been conducted by 
the department. 

Principles and Methods of Drying 

Three main ways of drsdng are applicable in the 
home manufacture of dried fruits and vegetableSi 
namely, sun drying, drying by artificial heat, and dry- 



DRYING FRUITS AND VEGETABLES 299 

ing by air blast. These, of course, may be com- 
bined. In general, most fruits or vegetables, to be dried 
quickly, must first be shredded or cut into slices, be- 
cause many are too large to dry quickly or are covered 
with a skin, the purpose of which is to prevent drying 
out. When freshly cut fruits or vegetables are to be 
dried by means of artificial heat, they should be exposed 
first to gentle heat and later to the higher temperatures. 
If the air applied at the outset is of too high a tempera- 
ture, the cut surfaces of the sUced fruit« or vegetables 
become hard, or scorched, covering the juicy interior 
so that it will not dry out. Generally it is not desirable 
that the air temperature in drying should go above 
140** to 150° F., and it is better to keep it well below 
this point. Insects and insect eggs are killed by 
exposure to heat of this temperature. 

It is important to know the degree of heat in the drier, 
and this can not be determined very accurately except 
by using a thermometer. Inexpensive oven thermom- 
eters can be found on the market, or an ordinary 
chemical thermometer can be suspended in the drier. 
If a thermometer is not used, the greatest care should 
be given to the regulation of the heat. The tempera- 
ture in the drier rises rather quickly and the product 
may scorch unless close attention is given. The reason 
sun dr3dng is popularly believed to give fruits and 
vegetables a sweeter flavor lies probably in the fact 
that in the sun they never are scorched, whereas in 
the oven or over a stove, scorching is likely to occur 
unless careful attention is given them. 

Drying of certain products can be completed in some 
driers within 2 or 3 hours. The time required for dry- 
ing vegetables varies. However, it' can be determined 
easily by a little experience on the part of the person 



300 ADVICE TO THE HOUSEWIFE 

doing the drying. The material should be stirred 
or turned several times during the dr3dng in order to 
secure a uniform product. 

The ability to judge accurately as to when fruit has 
reached the proper condition for removal from drier 
can be gained only by experience. When sufficiently 
dried it should be so dry that it is impossible to press 
water out of the freshly cut ends of the pieces, and 
will not show any of the natural grain of the fruit on 
being broken, and yet not so dry that it will snap or 
crackle. It should be leathery and pliable. 

When freshly cut fruits or vegetables are spread 
out they immediately begin to evaporate moisture 
into the air around them, and if in a closed box will 
very soon saturate the air with moisture. This will 
slow down the rate of drying and lead to the formation 
of molds. If a current of dry air is blown over them 
continually, the water in them will evaporate steadily 
imtil they are dry and crisp. Certain products, espe- 
cially raspberries, should not be dried hard, because if 
too much moisture is removed from them they wiB 
not resume their original form when soaked in water. 
On the other hand, the material must be dried suffi- 
ciently or it will not keep, but will mold. Too great 
stress can not be laid upon this point. This does not 
mean that the product must be baked or scorched, but 
simply that it must be dried uniformly through and 
through. 

It will be found advisable also to "condition" 
practically all dried vegetables and fruits. This is 
best done in a small way by placing the material in 
boxes and poiiring it from one box into another once a 
day for 3 or 4 days, so as to mix it thoroughly and give 
to the whole mass an even degree of moisture. If the 



DRYING FRUITS AND VEGETABLES 301 

material is found to be too moist, it should be returned 
to the drying trays for a short drying. 

Preparation of Food for the Drier 

In large factories the vegetables are put through 
special shredders and sheers not adapted for home 
use, but convenient and inexpensive machines which 
can be used to great advantage are on the market. 
The meat grinder with its special disks can be used 
in certain cases; the common kraut sheer will cut 
into slices large vegetables such as potatoes and cab- 
bage; and the rotary hand sheer is adapted for use on 
a very wide range of material. A large sharp kitchen 
knife may be used when a handier cutting device is 
not available. Care should be taken that the material 
is shced thin enough but not too thin. From an 
eighth to a quarter of an inch is a fair thickness for 
most of the common vegetables to be shced and dried. 
Very small shces or strips dry more quickly because 
they expose a greater surface to the air than do larger 
cut pieces. But if cut too fine they are more difficult 
to handle in drying, appear to lose somewhat in flavor, 
and can not be used so advantageously to make 
dishes hke those prepared from the fresh foods. 

The shcing machines are not suitable for children's 
use, for they will cut fingers as mercilessly as they do 
vegetables and fruits, and even adults should exercise 
great caution in their use in the home. 

Cleanhness is as necessary in the preparation of 
vegetables and fruits for drying as in their preparation 
for canning, perhaps even more so. To secure a fine 
quality of dried products much depends upon having 
the vegetables absolutely fresh, young, tender, and per- 
fectly clean. If steel knives are used in paring and 



302 ADVICE TO THE HOUSEWIFE 

cutting, have them clean and bright so as not to dis* 
color the vegetable. The earthy smell and flavor will 
cling to root crops if they are not washed thoroughly 
before sUcing, and one decayed root may flavor several 
kettles of soup if the sUces from it are scattered through 
a whole batch of dried material. High-grade drit^d 
''roof vegetables can only be made from peeled 
roots. 

In the preparation of large quantities of potatoes a 
potato peeler may be utiUzed. The potatoes are thrown 
by centrifugal force against a rough surface which, 
tmder streams of water provided by the perforated tin 
container above, nicks off the outer skin and leaves only 
the eyes to be dug out. 

Blanching of vegetables is considered desirable by 
some housekeepers, although it is not strictly essential 
to successful drying. It is claimed that the blanch 
gives a more thorough cleaning, removes the strong 
odor and flavor from certain kinds of vegetables, and 
softens and loosens the fiber. This allows the moisture 
in the vegetable to evaporate more quickly and uni- 
formly. It also quickly coagulates the albuminous 
matter in the vegetables, which helps to hold in the 
natural flavors. Blanching consists of plunging the 
vegetable into boiling water for a short time. Use a 
wire basket or cheese-cloth bag for this. After blanch- 
ing the required number of minutes, drain well and 
remove surface moisture from vegetables by placing 
between two towels or by exposing to the sun and air 
for a short time. 

Apparatus for Drying 

The dr3ring of fruits and vegetables in the sun is a 
simple process if they have been prepared properly. 



DRYING FRUITS AND VEGETABLES 303 

In its simplest form such drying consists in spreading 
the freshly prepared sUces or pieces on sheets of paper, 
or, if there is danger of the product's sticking, spreading 
on old pieces of mushn held down with stones. Bright, 
hot sunny days are chosen for this work, and a close 
watch is kept to see that no rain or dew wets the prod- 
uct. If flies and other insects are abundant, a mosquito 
bar is thrown over the product. Once or twice a day 
the sUces are stirred or turned over with the hand, and 
the thin ones which dry first are taken out. Sun dry- 
ing has much to recommend it, since it requires no 
expenditure of fuel and there is Uttle danger of the 
product becoming overheated. Dust, however, gathers 
on the product, and, unless it is protected carefully, 
flies, and especiaUy certain insects which habitually 
attack dried fruits, wiU lay their eggs upon it. These 
eggs later will hatch out, and the worms, or larvae, 
will riddle the dried fruits or vegetables, rendering 
them unfit for the table. 

Fruits and vegetables, when dried in the sun, gen- 
erally are spread on large trays of uniform size, so 
constructed that they can be stacked one on top of the 
other and protected from rain by means of a cover 
made of oilcloth, canvas, or roofing paper. 

A very cheap tray can be made of strips of lumber 
I inch thick and 2 inches wide, which form the sides 
and ends, and lath which is nailed on to form the bot- 
tom. Spaces i inch wide should be left between the 
laths for ventilation, and the trays can be raised off 
the ground by placing them on poles or an improvised 
trestle. As laths are 4 feet long, these lath trays are 
most economical of material when made 4 feet in 
length. 

Better but more expensive trays can be made by 



804 ADVICE TO THE HOUSEWIFE 

substituting galvanized-wire screen, i or } inch mesh, 
for the laths, in which case the most economical size 
would depend upon the width of the wire screen 
obtainable. 

A cheap and very satisfactory drier for use over the 
kitchen stove can be made by any handy boy or car- 
penter from a small amount of small-mesh galvanized- 
wire netting and a number of laths or strips of wood 
about ^ inch thick and 2 inches wide. The screen 
may be tacked directly on the framework to make the 
drying shelves, or the framework can be made to 
support separate trays. By using two laths nailed 
together, the framework can be stiffened, and larger 
trays made if desirable. This iform or any of the 
Ughter makes of driers can be suspended from the 
ceiUng over the kitchen range or over the oil, gasoline, 
or gas stove, and it will utilize the hot air which rises 
during the cooking hour. It can be raised out of the 
way or swimg to one side by a crane made of lath, 
when the stove is required for cooking purposes, and 
lowered or swung back to utilize the heat which 
otherwise would be wasted, when the top of the stove 
is not in use. 

Another homemade cookstove drier that can be 
used on a wood or coal range or a kerosene stove can 
be made easily and cheaply. Dimensions: Base 24 
by 16 inches; height 36 inches. A base 6 inches high 
is made of galvanized sheet iron. This base slightly 
flares toward the bottom and has two small openings 
for ventilation in each of the four sides. On the base 
rests a box-like frame made of 1 or 1| inch strips of 
wood. The two sides are braced with IJ-inch strips 
which serve as cleats on which the trays in the drier 
rest. These are placed at intervals of 3 inches. The 



DRYING FRUITS AND VEGETABLES 305 

frame is covered with tin or galvanized sheet iron which 
is tacked to the wooden strips of the frame. Thin 
strips of wood may be used instead of tin or sheet 
iron. The door is fitted on small hinges and fastened 
with a thumb latch. It opens wide so that the trays 
can be removed easily. The bottom of the drier is 
made of a piece of perforated galvanized sheet iron. 
Two inches above the bottom, is placed a soUd sheet of 
galvanized iron which is 3 inches less in length and width 
than the bottom. This sheet rests on two wires fastened 
to the sides of the drier. This prevents the direct heat 
from coming in contact with the product and serves 
as a radiator to spread the heat more evenly. 

The first tray is placed 3 inches above the radiator. 
The trays rest on the cleats 3 inches apart. A drier 
of the given dimensions will hold 8 trays. The frame 
of the tray is made of 1-inch strips on which is tacked 
galvanized screen wire, which forms the bottom of 
the tfay. The tray is 21 by 15 inches, making it 3 
inches less in depth than the drier. The lowest tray 
when placed in the drier is pushed to the back, leaving 
the 3-inch space in front. The next tray is placed even 
with the front, leaving a 3-inch space in the back. 
The other trays alternate in the same way. This per- 
mits the current of heated air to pass around and over 
the trays. A ventilator opening, about 2 inches wide 
and 6 inches long, is left in the top of the drier, through 
which the moist air may pass away. 

This principle of construction is followed so that 
currents of heated air will pass over the product as 
well as up through it, gathering the moisture and pass- 
ing away. The movement of the current of air induces 
a more rapid and uniform drying. The upper trays 
can be shifted to the lower part of the drier, and the 



306 ADVICE TO THE HOUSEWIFE 

lower trays to the upper part as drying proceeds, so 
as to dry the products uniformly throughout. 

Still another home drier is the cookstove oven. 
Bits of food, left overs, especially sweet corn, can be 
dried on plates in a very slow oven or on the back of 
the cookstove and saved for winter use. If the 
oven is very warm the do6r should be left ajar and the 
temperature of the oven often noted. Trays for use 
in the oven can be made from a convenient-sized gal- 
vanized wire screen by bending up the edges 1 or 2 
inches. 

Cookstove driers on the market are of two types. 
One type consists of a series of trays upon which 
the material to be dried is spread. These trays are 
placed in a framework one above the other, forming 
a compartment through which the heated air rises, 
canying off the moisture. The second type consists 
of a shallow flat metal box filled with water and de- 
signed so that one end can rest on the back of the stove 
and the other on a leg reaching to the floor. It also 
may be supported over a lamp. 

The use of an electric fan in facilitating drying can 
be highly recommended. This is feasible for those 
who already own a fan. It has been found that many 
sliced vegetables and fruits placed in long trays 3 
by 1 foot and stacked in two tiers, end to end, before 
an electric fan, can be dried to the requisite dr3mess 
within 24 hours. Some require much less time. For 
instance, sliced string beans and shredded sweet pota- 
toes will dry, before a fan running at a moderate speed, 
within a few hours. In many cities the electric fan 
will cost not more than one-fourth of a cent an hour 
to run. The fan should be placed close to the stack 
of trays, and they should not be filled so full that 



DRYING FRUITS AND VEGETABLES 307 

the air can not pass freely through them. The fan 
method has a marked advantage in that the product 
keeps cool owing to evaporation while it is being 
dried, thus tending to retain the color and eliminate 
spoilage. 

Directions for Drjring 

Many of the products for which directions are given 
here may be dried either with or without preUminary 
blanching. In such cases both methods are described. 
Alternative methods are designated by letters. 

Sweet Com 

Only very young and tender corn should be used for 
drying, and it should be prepared at once after gath- 
ering. 

(a) Cook in boiling water 2 to 5 minutes, long enough 
to set the milk. Cut the kernels from the cob with a 
sharp knife, taking care not to cut off pieces of the cob. 
Spread thinly on trays, and place in position to dry. 
Stir occasionally until dry. 

(b) Boil or steam on the cob 8 to 10 minutes, to set 
the milk. To improve flavor, a teaspoon of salt to a 
gallon of water may be used. Drain well and cut 
corn from cob, using a very sharp and flexible knife. 
Cut grains fine, only half way down to the cob, and 
scrape out the remainder of grain, bring careful not 
to scrape off any of the chaff next to the cob. Dry 
from 3 to 4 hours at 110^ to 145** F. When field com 
is used, good, plump roasting-ear stage is the proper 
degree of ripeness. A pound of dried corn per dozen 
ears is an average yield. 

(c) The corn may be dried in the sun. Dry in 
oven 10 to 15 minutes, and finish drying in the sun. 



306 ADVICE TO THE HOUSEWIFE 

Sun drying, of course, is not satisfactory in moist 
weather. 

Pack in cartons or boxes for a few days to " condi- 
tion/' as described on page 300. 

String or Snap Beans 

All varieties of string beans can be dried, but only 
beans in ideal condition for table use should be selected 
for this purpose. 

(a) Wash; remove stem, tip and " strings." Cut or 
break the beans into pieces | to 1 inch long, and place 
on trays, and dry. They also can be run through the 
sheer and then dried quickly. 

(6) Prepare as directed above, but instead of cut- 
ting the beans, thread them on coarse, strong thread, 
making long '' necklaces " of them, and hang them 
above the stove or out of ooors until dry. An old- 
fashioned recipe calls for boiUng the pods until nearly 
cooked through, before drying. 

(c) Wash and string beans carefully. The very 
young and tender beans can be dried whole. Those 
that are full grown should be cut in | to 1 inch lengths 
with vegetable sheer or a sharp knife. It is better to 
cut beans than to snap them. They are then put in 
a bag of cheese-cloth or in a wire basket and blanched 
in boiUng water for 6 to 10 minutes, depending on the 
maturity of the bean. One-half teaspoon of soda may 
be added to each gallon of boihng water to help set the 
green color in the beans. Remove surface moisture 
by placing between two towels or by exposing to the 
sun and air for a short time. Dry young string beans 
2 hours, more matured beans 3 hours. Begin drying 
at temperature of 110^ F. and raise temperature grad- 
uaUy to 145** F. 



DRYING FRUITS AND VEGETABLES 309 

Wax beans are dried in the same manner as the green 
string beans. 

" Condition " as described on page 300. 

Lima Beans 

Lima beans can be shelled from the pod and dried. 
If gathered before maturity, when young and tender, 
wash and blanch from 5 to 10 minutes. Length of 
time for blanching depends upon size and maturity 
of beans. Remove surface moisture and dry from 3 
to 3^ hours at same temperature as string beans. 

Dry Shelled Beans (Important in the South) 

Beans of different kinds, after maturing and drying 
on the vines, can be treated as follows: Shell, wash, 
spread in thin layers on the trays of the drier and heat 
10 minutes, beginning at 160^ F. and gradually raising 
the temperature to 180** F. This high temperature 
is for the purpose of destroying aU insect eggs that 
may be on the beans. Cowpeas or any field pea can 
be treated in the same way. Cool and store carefully. 
It might be added that the heating of the bean or 
pea destroys its vitaUty. When so treated it can 
not be used for seed. 

Okra 

(a) Small, tender pods sometimes are strung on a 
stout thread and hung over the stove to dry. If dried 
in that manner, heat in oven before storing on trays. 

(6) Wash, blanch 3 minutes in boiling soda water, 
and dry 2 to 3 hours at 110** to 140** F. Use i teaspoon 
soda to a gallon of water. Dry young and small tender 
pods whole. Older pods should be cut in ^-inch slices. 



310 ADVICE TO THE HOUSEWIFE 

Peppers 

(a) Peppers may be dried by splitting on one side, 
removing seed, drying in the air, and finishing the dry- 
ing in the drier at 140^ F. A more satisfactory method 
is to place peppers in biscuit pan in oven, and heat until 
skin blisters, or to steam peppers until skin softens, 
peel, split in half, take out seed, and dry at 110^ to 
140^ F. In drying thick-fleshed peppers like the pi- 
mento, do not increase heat too quickly, but dry slowly 
and evenly. 

(6) Small varieties of red peppers may be spread in 
the sun until wilted and the drying finished in the 
drier, or they may be dried entirely in the sim. 

(c) Peppers often are dried whole. If they are large 
they can be strung on stout thread; if small, the whole 
plant can be hung up to dry. 

Peas 

(a) Shell and spread on trays and dry. 

(6) Shell full-grown peas with nonedible pod, blanch 
the peas from 3 to 5 minutes, remove surplus moisture, 
spread in single layer on trays, and dry from 3 to 3§ 
hours. Begin drying at 110** F., raising temperature 
very slowly in about Ij hours to 145® F. Continue 
drying 1§ or 2 hours at 145° F. 

(c) Shell full-grown peas, passing through a meat 
grinder, spread on trays, and dry. Whole peas take 
longer to dry, but when cooked they resemble fresh 
peas. The ground peas dry more quickly but make a 
product which can be used successfully only in the 
preparation of soup or pur^e. 

(d) When drying the very young and tender sugar 
peas, use the pod also. Wash and cut in i-inch pieces. 



DRYING FRUITS AND VEGETABLES 311 

Blanch in boiling water 6 minutes. Remove surplus 
moisture and dry the same length of time and at the 
same temperature as string beans. It is not necessary 
to use soda when blanching peas.

Garden Beets, Onions, Leeks, Cairots, Turnips, Parsnips, 
_ _i Cabbage 

Beets: (a) Select young, quickly grown, tender 
beets. Wash, peel, slice about i inch thick, and dry. 

(b) Boil the whole beets, imskinned, until a little more 
than three-fourths done. Dip in cold water, peel, 
and slice into i or ^ inch slices. Dry 2} to 3 hours 
at 110** to 150** F. 

Turnips: Turnips should be treated in the same 
way as beets. 

Carrots : Varieties having a large, woody core should 
be avoided. 

(a) Wash, peel, slice lengthwise into pieces about i 
inch thick, and dry. 

(b) Clean, scrape, or pare, and slice into |-inch slices. 
Blanch 6 minutes, remove surface moisture, and dry 
2^ to 3 hours. Begin dr3ring at 110^ F. and raise 
temperature gradually to 150^ F. 

Parsnips, kohl-rabi, celeriac, and salsify are dried 
by the same methods. , 

Onions: (a) Select well-matured onions and remove 
the outside papery covering. Cut off tops and roots. 
Slice into |-inch pieces and dry quickly. Store in a 
light-proof container to avoid discoloration. 

(6) Wash, peel, and sUce onions into i to J-inch slices. 
To avoid any unpleasantness, peel and slice while 
holding under water. Blanch in boiling water 5 
minutes. Remove surface moisture and dry 2} to 



312 ADVICE TO THE HOUSEWIFE 

3 hours, beginning at 110^ F. and raising temperature 
gradually to 140** P. 

Leeks are handled in a similar manner, cut into 
jt-inch strips and dried. 

Cabbage : (a) Select well-developed heads of cabbage 
and remove all loose outside leaves. Split the cabbage, 
remove the hard, woody core, slice the remainder of 
the head with a kraut cutter or slicer, and dry. 

{b) Shred or cut into strips a few inches long. 
Blanch 10 minutes, drain, remove surface moisture, 
and dry 3 hours at 110** to 145*" F. 

All these products should be *^ conditioned " as 
described on page 300. 

Spinach and Parsley 

Spinach that is in prime condition for greens should 
be prepared by careful washing and by removing the 
leaves from the roots. Spread the leaves on trays to 
dry thoroughly. Slicing will greatly facilitate drying. 

Parsley should be treated in the same way as spinach. 

Beet TopSy Swiss Chard, Celery, and Rhubarb 

Beet tops : Tops of young beets in suitable condition 
for greens should be selected and washed carefully. 
Both the leafstalk and the blade should be cut into 
sections about i inch long, spread on screens, and 
dried. 

Swiss chard and celery should be prepared in the 
same way as beet tops. Celery also may be prepared 
in the same way as pumpkins and summer squash. 

Rhubarb: Choose yoimg and succulent growth. 
Prepare as for stewing, by skinning the leafstalks 
and cutting into pieces about i inch to } inch in length. 
Do not use the blade of the leaf. 



DRYING FRUITS AND VEGETABLES 313 

All these products should be *' conditioned '' as

Irish Potatoes 

Select good, sound, well-matured potatoes. 

(a) Wash and boil or steam until nearly done. Peel 
and pass through a meat grinder or a potato ricer- 
Collect the shreds in layers on a tray and dry until 
brittle. If toasted slightly in an oven when dry, the 
flavor is improved somewhat. 

(b) Boil or steam until nearly done, peel as above, 
cut into i-inch sUces, spread on trays, and dry until 
brittle. 

Peeling may be omitted, but the product will be 
very much inferior in flavor. 

Sweet Potatoes 

Select sound, mature roots. 

(a) Wash, boil until nearly done, peel, and run 
through the meat chopper. Spread on trays and dry 
until brittle. 

(b) Treat as above, but slice instead of running 
through the meat chopper. 

(c) Wash, peel, slice, spread on trays, and dry. A 
somewhat brighter product will result if the sliced 
potato is dipped in salt water just before drying. 

Cauliflower 

Clean, divide in small bunches, blanch 6 minutes, 
and dry 2 to 3 hours at 110*" to 145** F. Cauliflower 
will turn very dark when dr3dng, but will regain part 
of the color in soaking and cooking. Dried cauli- 
flower is especially good in soups and omelets. 

Brussels sprouts may be handled in a similar way, 
but^add a pinch of soda to the blanching water. 



314 ADVICE TO THE HOUSEWIFE 

PompUiif and Squaah 

(a) Select sound, well-grown specimens. Cut into 
strips; peel these; remove all seeds and the soft part 
surrounding them. Cut stripe into smaller bits not over 
i inch thick and 2 inches long, and dry. 

(b) Pare and cut into about ^-inch strips and blanch 
3 minutes. Remove surface moisture and dry slowly 
from 3 to 4 hours, raising temperature from 110^ 
to 140** F. 

Pack and ** condition " as described on page 300. 

Soup Miztores 

Each vegetable used in the soup mixture is prepared 
and dried separately. They are put together in pro- 
portions desired, the preferred flavoring vegetables 
predominating. A combination of several vegetables 
makes the most desirable soup mixture. Those most 
often used are carrots, cabbage, onions, celery, pota- 
toes, and okra. 

Herbs 

Celery tops, parsley, mint, sage, and herbs of all 
kinds need not be blanched, but should be washed well 
and dried in the sun or in the drier. These are good 
for flavoring soups, purees, gravies, omelets, etc. 

Apples, Pears, and Quinces 

Early varieties and sweet apples are not well adapted 
to drying. Winter apples should be used for this pur- 
pose. 

(a) Peel, core, trim, and slice i inch thick. Dip 
in weak salt solution containing 8 te^poons of salt 
to 1 gallon of water. Spread on trays and dry. It is 
only necessary to dry apples long enough for them to 
become tough and somewhat leathery. 



DRYING FRUITS AND VEGETABLES 315 

(b) Pare, core, and cut into eighths, or core and slice 
in rings, using fruit or vegetable slicer. As apples 
discolor quickly, do not let them stand long before 
drying. To prevent discoloration, as the fruit is 
prepared it may be dipped for 1 minute in a. cold salt 
bath, using 1 ounce of salt to 1 gallon of water. Re- 
move surplus moisture and dry at 110® to 150** F., 
raising temperature gradually. Dry from 4 to 6 hours, 
and longer if necessary. 

Pears are dried in the same way as apples. They 
may be steamed 10 minutes before drying. 

Quinces are treated in the same was as pears.

Raspberries'] 

(a) Sort out imperfect berries, spread the selected 
berries on trays, and dry. Do not dry so long that 
they become hard enough to rattle. The dr3ring 
should be stopped as soon as the berries fail to stain 
the hand when pressed. 

(6) Pick leaves and stems from fruits and spread 
fruits on trays. Handle carefully and do not bruise. 
Spread in thin layer, and dry slowly. Raise tempera- 
ture gradually from 110** to 125** F. in about 2 hours. 
Do not raise temperature higher than 130® F. until 
a considerable portion of the moisture has evaporated, 
as otherwise expansion will occur and juice will be lost 
by dripping. This is accompanied by loss of flavor 
and color. Finish drying berries at 140** F. for 2 to 
3 hours. It is necessary to dry berries from 4 to 5 
hours. 

Blackberries, dewberries, and huckleberries can be 
dried in the same way as raspberries.

316 ADVICE TO THE HOUSEWIFE 

Peaches 

Peaches usually are dried unpeded, but they will 
be better if peeled before drying. 

(a) Remove the stones, cut the fruit into halves, or 
preferably into smaller pieces, and spread on trayB to 
dry. 

(b) Cut in halves, pit, lay in trays pit side up, and 
dry at same temperature and for same length of time 
as applies. 

Peaches should be packed carefully and " condi- 
tioned " as described on page 300. 

Plums and Apricots 

Plums: (a) Plums are not peeled, but the pits are 
removed, the fruit being cut into halves and dried in 
the same way as peaches. 

(6) Select medium-ripe plums, cover with boiling 
water, cover the vessel and let stand 20 minutes. 
Small, thin-fleshed varieties are not suitable for drying. 
Drain, remove surface moisture, and dry from 4 to 6 
hours, gradually raising temperature from 110^ to 
160^ F. 

Apricots are handled in the same way as plums. 

Pack and '' condition '' as described on page 300. 

Cherries 

(a) Remove stems of cherries and, if the fruit is 
large, the pits also. Spread out on trays to dry. 
Small, black cherries can be dried when containing 
the stones. 

(b) Wash, remove surface moisture, and spread 
cherries, unseeded, in thin layer on trays. If cherries 
are seeded there will be a loss of juice. Dry from 2

Precautions against Insects 

Two kinds of moths stand out prominently among 
insects that attack dried fruits and vegetables. They 
are much more Ukely to get into the fruit during the 
process of drying than to find their way through 
boxes into the products stored inside them. This 
appUes particularly to drying in the sun. 

A small moth called the Indian-meal moth is the 
most destructive insect that attacks dried fruits and 
vegetables. It is about | inch long and has a cloaked 
appearance, one-third gray and the rest copper brown. 
The fig moth is about the same size, but is a dark neu- 
tral gray. A minute, flattened, chocolate-brown beetle 
usually accompanies these moths and does consider- 
able damage. Both of the moths deposit their eggs 
on fruit when it is on the drying racks— generaUy 
at dusk or after dark, as they are not fond of day- 
light. It takes from 3 to 10 days for the eggs to hatch 
into whitish or pinkish grub-like caterpillars and from 
6 to 10 weeks from the laying of the eggs till the appear- 
ance of the moth to lay another lot of eggs; and since 
a number of " broods " or generations are produced 
yearly, if a few of these moth eggs are stored away on 
dried fruits or vegetables, hundreds of caterpillars are 
produced and many pounds of valuable material may 
be destroyed during the course of the winter if it is 
stored in a warm room. Warm dark bins or dried 
fruit in sacks offer especially favorable places for 
their development. It is evident that the larger the 



318 ADVICE TO THE HOUBEWIFB 



amount d material in a package, the greater the chance 
of a few eggs doing a great deal of damage. Small 
cartons or containers have the advantage of confining 
the injiuy from these moths to small quantities of 
material^ for, if the containers are closed tightly, they 
can not easily escape from them and infest other pack- 
ages, which may not have been infested previously. 

In sun drying, if the drying racks are screened early 
in the evening and at night, the cheese-cloth or fly 
screen battened down, and the dried fruit and vegetables 
stored in tight paper sacks in a cool place, no danger 
ordinarily need be feared from these insects. As an 
additional precaution, the dried product, before being 
stored, may be heated to 140^ F. long enough to allow 
the heat to penetrate throughout. This will sterilize 
it if already infested. 

In drying by artificial heat, the process itself ordi- 
narily will sterilize the product. But after drying it 
should be stored promptly, to prevent infestation. 

Directions for Packing and Storing 

Although not necessary, tin cans or glass jars make 
good receptacles for storage of dried fruits or vegetables. 
Pasteboard boxes with tight covers, stout paper bags, 
and patented paraffin paper cartons also afford ample 
protection for dried products when protected from 
insects and rodents. The dried fruit or vegetables 
must be protected from the outside moisture and will 
keep best in a cool, dry, well-ventilated place. These 
conditions, however, are difficult to obtain in the more 
humid regions, and there moisture-tight containers 
should be used. 

If a small amount of dried product is put in each 
receptacle, just enough for one or two meals, it will not 



DRYING FRUITS AND VEGETABLES 3113^ 

be necessary to open a container the contents of which 
can not be consumed in a short time. The use of the 
small container also makes it more difficult for insects 
to spoil large quantities of the dried fruits or vegetables. 
If a paper bag is used, the upper part should be twisted 
into a neck, bent over, and tied tightly with a string. 
If a further precaution against spoilage is necessary 
the bag can be coated with paraffin by painting it 
with a brush which has been dipped into melted paraffin. 
Another precaution may be taken by placing the small 
bags in a tin container with a tightly fitting eover, 
such as an ordinary lard can or pail. All bags should 
bear a label indicating what they contain. 

If fruits or vegetables are packed in tight containers 
immediately upon being dried thoroughly, they will 
remain just as brittle as they were when taken from the 
drier. If, however, they are not dried thoroughly, 
they will " sweat " and soon mold. To prevent this 
the material should be examined within 24 hours after 
packing, and if it appears moist it must be dried 
further. 

Recipes for Cooking Dried Fruits and Vegetables 

It must be remembered that the water which has been 
dried out of the fruits or vegetables must be restored 
to them before cooking and that this process requires 
time. In general, the longer it takes to dry, the longer 
should the dried products soak. Because the kind 
of vegetable (old and tough or young and tender), 
the size of the pieces (large or small), and the amount of 
moisture which the dried product contains affect the 
length of time the vegetable should soak, the house- 
keeper must use her best judgment in selecting the 
method of preparation best suited to her own products. 



'320 ADVICE TO THE HOUSEWIFE 

Once soaked, dried vegetables and fruits can be 
cooked in almost any of the ways in which fresh ones 
can be cooked, recipes for which are given below* 
These are in use by commercial concerns. 

SNAP BEANS 

Soak oyemight or 8 to 12 hours, using 10 pints of water to 
1 pound of beans, or 3 times as much water as beans. Boil 
3 hours in the same water, with a slice of bacon; drain off water 
and add salt, pepper, and butter. Cream sauce may be usedL 
Four ounces of dried beans will serve 10 people. 

BEETS 

Dried, sliced beets, if soaked too long, lose their red color 
and good flavor. Soaking for 2 hours (2 parts water to 1 part 
beets) should be sufficient. They should then be cooked in the 
same water for about 1} hours. If they are cooled in the same 
water in which they are cooked, it is believed that the color 
is improved. Cured by process B. 

Dried beets, after soaking, may be cooked in various ways, 
the same as fresh beets. 

Creamed Beets. Soak 1 cup of dried beet root in 2 cups of 
water from 6 to 8 hours. Cook until tender. Cool in the 
same water. Drain off water. Add 2 tablespoons of sugar, 
i cup of vinegar, i cup of water, tablespoon of butter, and a 
little salt; heat together to boiling point, thicken a little with 
flour and water well blended. Serve hot. Cured by proc- 
ess A. 

Pickled Beets. Cook as above, add vinegar and spices and 
sweeten to taste. Dried beets may seem to lose color, but 
cooling in the water in which they were boiled will tend to 
restore the natural color. 

Buttered Beets. Soak 2 cups of dried beets for two hours 
in 4 cups of cold water and cook until tender. Drain and add 
to the beets 2 tablespoons of butter, 1 teaspoon of salt, and 
i teaspoon of pepper. Stir carefully in order to butter and sea- 
son each slice of beet without breaking it. Serve hot. 



DRYING FRUITS AND VEGETABLES 321 



CARROTS 

BftUered Carrots. Very young carrots do not require soaking. 
They may be placed in cold water (about 3 cups of water to 1 
cup of dried carrots) and cooked slowly for about 1} hours. 
If the carrots are old and cut in large pieces for drying, soaking 
2 to 8 hours or even overnight may be necessary. Drain off 
water, add salt and pepper, and serve buttered or with drawn 
butter or cream sauce. 

To use with boiled or roast meats, soak as above, boil in same 
water 10 minutes, and drop in with the meat. 

Carrot Pudding, Soak } cup of dried carrots in 2} cups of 
water 6 to 8 hours, or overnight. Add to the carrots 1 cup of 
raw potatoes, 1 cup of dried cherries, and f cup of suet, and chop 
up fine. Then add 1 cup of flour, 1 cup of sugar, i teaspoon 
salt, 1 teaspoon cinnamon, i teaspoon cloves, } teaspoon nut- 
meg, } teaspoon soda well mixed. Stir until thoroughly mixed. 
Steam 3 hours and serve hot with pudding sauce. 

CELERY 

Soak 8 to 12 hours, or overnight, using 12 pints of water to 1 
pound of celery, or 3 parts of water to 1 part of celery. Boil in 
same water until tender and serve with cream and a tablespoon 
of butter. 

CORN 

Soak the com for 2 to 4 hours in water, using 2 cups of water 
to 1 cup of com. Some housekeepers prefer to soak it over- 
night, but if this is done the corn should be kept in a very cool 
place so that it does not sour. Cook the com in the water in 
which it was soaked for an hour or more. Then season with 
butter, salt, and pepper, and if desired, a very little sugar also. 
Some housekeepers prefer to add milk to the water in which the 
com is cooked or to use cream in place of butter for seasoning it. 

ONIONS 

Dried, thinly sliced onions may be cooked slowly without 
previous soaking, about 2 cups of water being needed for each 
cup of dried onion. If very dry, the onions are better if soaked 
from 2 to 6 hours and then cooked in the same water until 



322 ADVICE TO THE HOUSEWIFE 

tender. After cooking, the onions may be used like any other 
onions, in a great variety of ways. 

PARSNIPS 

Soak the parsnips for 2 to 4 hours in water, using 2 caps of 
water to 1 cup parsnips, or 1 part parsnips to 2 parts water. 
Cook in the same water 30 minutes. Drain off water and 
brown in butter or other fat, or serve with cream sauce. 

IRISH POTATOES 

Soak 6 to 8 hours, or overnight, using 8 pints of water to 1 
pound of potatoes, or 2 parts of water to 1 part of potatoes. 

Fried Potatoes. Boil in the same water about 6 minute. 
Drain and fry in the same way as fresh potatoes. 

Mashed Potatoes, Boil in the same water 20 to 30 minutes. 
Drain and steam 5 to 10 minutes and then mash, adding salt, 
pepper, butter, and milk. 

Dried Cooked Potatoes. If* the potatoes were cooked before 
drying, it will not be necessary to soak them before cooking. 
Place the dried potato in a double boiler, add about 2 cups of 
milk to 1 cup of potato*, cover, and steam until soft. Beat, 
season with salt, pepper, and butter, and serve like fresh mashed 
potatoes. 

SWEET POTATOES 

' Dried raw sweet potatoes may be soaked and cooked like 
Irish potatoes (see above). In preparing dried cooked sweet 
potatoes for the table, water should be substituted for the milk 
used in steaming the Irish potatoes. Except for this, the 
same method can be followed. 

RHUBARB 

Stewed Rhubarb. Soak 6 to 8 hours, or overnight, using 12 
pints of water to 1 pound of rhubarb, or 2 parts of water to 1 part 
of rhubarb. Cook in the same water until done and sweeten 
to taste. 

Rhubarb Pie. Soak 1 cup of dried rhubarb in 2 cups of water 
8 to 12 hours. Cook in the same water 30 minutes, then make 
into a pie as if it were fresh rhubarb 



DRYING FRUITS AND VEGETABLES 323 



SPINACH 

Dried spinaeh takes up water very readily and may be cooked 
slowly without previous soaking. If preferred, it can be soaked 
2 to 6 hours, which will shorten the time required for cooking. 
A little salt pork added to the spinach improves the flavor, 
or it may be buttered when served. 

SQUASH 

Soak 8 to 12 hours, or overnight, using 10 pints of water to 
1 pound of squash, or 3 parts of water to 1 part of squash. 

Mashed SgtMsh. Boil slowly in the same water 1 hour. Mash 
well and add salt, pepper, and butter. 

Squash Pie, Soak 1 cup of dried squash 8 to 12 hours in 3 cups 
of water. Cook in the same water 1 hour and mash well. Mix 
thoroughly 1 egg well beaten, } cup of sugar, } teaspoon salt, 
and 1 tablespoon flour. Stir in } teaspoon each of cinnamon, 
nutmeg, allspice, and ginger, a pinch of cloves, and 1} cups of 
milk. Add squash. Bake in a hot oven. 

APPLES 

Soak 6 to 8 hours, or overnight, using 6 pints of water to 1 
pound of apples, or 3 parts of water to 1 part of apples. Two 
hours' soaking is sufficient for thinly sliced apples. Commercial 
apples are sulphured and do not discolor. 

Apple Sauce, Cook about 30 minutes in the same water; 
then add 1 cup of sugar to 1 pound of fruit, i teaspoonful of 
nutmeg or cinnamon^ and mash. 

iipple Pie, Cook in the same water about 5 minutes to make 
them tender, then drain off water and use in pie in the same way 
as fresh apples. One pound of dried apples will make eight large 
pies. 

CHERRIES 

Soak 6 to 8 hoursi or overnight, using 4 pints of water to 1 
pound of cherries, or 3 parts of water to 1 part of cherries. 

Stewed Cherriee, Cook slowly in the same water and sweeten 
to taste. One pound of dried cherries will serve 15 people. 

Cherry Pie. Soak } cup of dried cherries in 1 pint of water 
6 to 8 hours. Heat in the same water 15 minutes. Drain 



324 ADVICE TO THE HOUSEWIFE 

off the juice and use the cherries in the pie in the same way as 
fresh cherries. Add a little sugar to the juice drained off, 
boil down to a sirup, and pour over the pie hot as it is served. 

PRUNES 

Soak 6 to 8 hours, or oyemight, using 2 pints of wat^r to 1 
pound of prunes, or 2 parts of wat«r to 1 part of prunes. 

Stetoed Prunes, Cook slowly in the same water and sweeten 
to taste. 

Spiced Prunes, Drain off water and add to it the following: 
For every 2 pounds of soaked up prunes, 1 pound ,of sugar, 
} pint of vinegar, 1 teaspoonf ul cinnamon, 1 teaspoonf ul allspice 
and cloves. Put spices in a cloth. Boil the above 15 or 20 
minutes until sirupy, then add prunes, and cook slowly about 
30 minutes. 

RASPBERRIES 

Soak 4 to 5 hours, using 6 pints of water to 1 pound of rasp- 
berries, or 1} parts of water to 1 part of raspberries. Cook in 
the same water 20 minutes and sweeten to taste. Use in the 
same way as fresh raspberries. 

OKRA 

Dried okra should be soaked until soft and used in the same 
way as fresh okra in the preparation of soups and stews. 

CABBAGE 

Creamed: Put heaping cupful in 7 cups of cold fresh water 
and bring very slotdy to a hoU, and boil steadily for 30 minutes. 
Do not cover kettle during cooking. Add i teaspoon salt.

INTRODUCTION 

/Methods of preserving vegetables by salting or 
fermenting them have been practiced for a long time, 
and vegetables so prepared are known to be whole- 
some food. Recent experiments by the Department 
of Agriculture have shown that a great many vege* 
tables may be satisfactorily preserved by such methods, 
which deserve a wider use in the home than they have 
had in the past. One advantage that these methods 
possess is that they make use of containers which could 
not be used for canning. For example, old kegs, lard 
and butter tubs, stone crocks or jars, wide-mouthed 

326 



FERMENTATION AND SALTING 327 

glass jars, and glass preserving jars without coversi 
if thoroughly cleaned, may be used for the storage of 
salted or fermented vegetables. Another advantage 
is that, with a given amount of labor, a great deal more 
material can be cared for by these methods than could 
be preserved in the same time if canning or drying 
alone were depended upon. 

General Principles of &e Methods 

The methods of preservation considered in this bulle- 
tin group themselves naturally under three heads: 
(1) Fermentation with dry salting, (2) fermentation 
in brine, and (3) salting without fermentation. 

When vegetables are either packed dry with 2 or 3 
pounds of salt to every 100 pounds of material, as in 
the making of sauerkraut, or are covered with a brine 
containing 5 pounds of salt to every 12 gallons of 
water, as in the preparation of dill pickles, the sugars 
present in the vegetables are extracted from them and 
are fermented by the lactic-acid-forming bacteria which 
are present naturally in great numbers on the surface 
of the fresh material. After this action has gone on to 
to a certain point, enough of this lactic acid is formed to 
kill the bacteria and prevent any further change in 
the material, provided certain precautions are taken 
to prevent the growth of molds. The lactic acid per- 
meates the fermented material and gives it a character- 
istic flavor not unhke that of a weak vinegar solution. 
This flavor is reUshed by many. The lactic acid has 
no harmful effect. It is the same acid which is present 
in sour milk and it is digested and utilized by the body 
as a source of energy. 

If the vegetables are covered with a very strong 



328 ADVICE TO THE HOUSEWIFE 

brine, or are packed with a fairly large amount of salt^ 
lactic-add fermentation and also the growth of other 
forms of bacteria and molds are prevented. This 
method of preservation is especially appUcable to those 
vegetables which contain so little sugar that sufficient 
lactic acid can not be formed by bacterial action to 
insure preservation of the material. 

In the well*known method of vinegar pickling, 
the acetic acid of the vinegar acts Uke the lactic acid 
produced by fermentation, as a preservative, prevent- 
ing the growth of bacteria or molds. Sometimes bri- 
ning precedes pickling in vinegar, and often the pickling 
is modified by the addition of sugar and spices, which 
add flavor, as well as help to preserve the fruit or vege- 
tables. In some cases olive oil or some other table 
oil is added to the vinegar, as in the making of oil 
cucumber pickles. 

Equipment Needed 

A supply of clean wooden kegs or stone crocks is the 
first requisite. For home use, the smaller sizes are pref- 
erable as a rule, because the contents will then be used 
up more quickly and there will be less chance of molding 
from standing too long after the kegs or crocks are 
opened. Wooden kegs holding 5 or 10 gallons are a 
convenient size. New kegs are preferable, but old 
ones, such as beer or cider kegs, may be used if they are 
thoroughly washed and steamed to remove any unde- 
sirable odor or flavor which might be imparted to 
the foods packed in them. Wooden vessels of yellow 
or pitch pine are undesirable, since they are apt to 
give a disagreeable taste to the foods. Stone crocks 
or jars holding from 1 to 5 gallons are convenient. 
Stoneware is less hkely to absorb flavors than wood, 



FERMENTATION AND SALTING 329 

and stone jars may be obtained in smaller sizes than 
wooden kegs. Wide-mouthed bottles or glass jars, 
which are not suitable for canning, may also be used 
for salting or fermenting small quantities of foods. 

A supply of ordinary fine salt, which can be pur- 
chased in bulk for about 2 cents per pound, is most 
satisfactory for general use. Table salt will do very 
well, but is rather expensive if large quantities of 
vegetables are to be preserved. The rather coarse 
salt (known in the trade as " ground alum salt ")> 
which is used in freezing ice cream, can be used. Rock 
salt should not be used because it is too coarse and 
is likely to contain impurities. 

Clean white cloth (cheese-cloth or muslin) is neces- 
sary for covering the material after it is packed into 
the container. It will be found convenient to cut 
this into circular pieces about 6 inches larger in diam- 
eter than the stone crock or keg. Two or three thick- 
nesses of cheese-cloth, or one thickness of muslin or 
heavier cloth, should be spread over the top of the 
vegetables. 

Roimd pieces of board about 1 inch or more in thick- 
ness will be needed to put on top of the cheese-cloth. 
The boards should be a little smaller in diameter than 
the inside of the crock or the head of the keg or tub, 
so that they will slip in and out easily. The pieces 
may be sawed out at a lumber mill, or may be made 
at home by fastening together several boards with 
cleats and rounding them with a small saw and a car- 
penter's shave. Almost any wood may be used except 
yellow or pitch pine, which is likely to impart an 
undesirable flavor to the vegetables. For small con- 
tainers, if preferred, heavy plates of suitable size can 
be used instead of boards. 



330 ADVICE TO THE HOU8EWIFB 

One or more clean bricks or some clean stones may 
be used as weights to hold down the mass in the keg 
or crock. 

ParafGin is needed to pour over the liquid in the 
containers (after fermentation has ceased) to prevent 
mold. 

A pair of kitchen scales or steelyards and a quart 
or gallon liquid measure complete the necessary equip- 
ment. 

Fermentation with Dry Salting 

As has already been stated, fermentation with dry 
salting consists in packing the material with a small 
amount of salt. No water is added, for the salt extracts 
the water from the vegetables and forms the brine. 
The method, in general, is as follows: 

Wash the vegetables, drain off the surplus water, 
and weigh them. For each 100 pounds of the vege- 
tables weigh out 3 pounds of salt; for smaller quan- 
tities use the same proportion (3 per cent by weight) 
of salt. Cover the bottom of the keg, crock, or other 
container with a layer of the vegetables about 1 inch 
thick and sprinkle over this a Uttle of the salt. Do not 
add too much of the salt to the first layers packed, 
but try to distribute it equally among the different 
layers so that the quantity which has been weighed 
out will be sufficient for the given quantity of vege- 
tables packed. If a little of the salt is left over, it 
can be added to the top layer, but if more has to be 
added than has been weighed out, the finished product 
will taste too salty. Continue adding layers of the 
material sprinkled with salt until the container is 
about three-fourths full. Sprinkle the last of the salt 
on the top layer and spread over it one or two thick- 



FERMENTATION AND SALTING 831 

nesses of cheese-cloth^ tucking them down at the sides. 
On the cloth place one of the round pieces of board, 
or a plate, as just described, and on this put a clean 
stone or one or two clean bricks. The size of the 
weight depends on the quantity of material being pre- 
served. For a 5-gallon keg a weight of 10 pounds will 
be sufficient, but if a larger barrel is used, a heavier 
weight will be needed. The weight added should be 
sufficient to extract the juices, to form a brine, which 
will cover the top in about 24 hours, and sometimes it 
may be necessary to add more stones after the material 
has stood a while, if a brine does not form. 

After it is packed, allow the container to stand in a 
moderately warm room to ferment. The salt and 
pressure of the weight soon extract water from the vege- 
tables and form a brine, which soon covers the whole 
mass. The stone and board serve to keep the vege- 
tables beneath the surface of the Uquid. If the weight 
is not sufficient for this purpose, a larger stone or 
more bricks should be added. As the fermentation 
goes on, bubbles arise to the surface of the Uquid. 
The rate of fermentation depends principally upon the 
temperature. In warm weather it requires only 8 to 
10 days; in cool weather 2 to 4 weeks may be neces- 
sary. When bubbling stops, fermentation is com- 
plete. A good way to determine this is to tap the 
receptacle gently; if no bubbles arise, fermentation 
is finished. 

The containers should then be placed in a cellar 
or other cool storeroom and the surface of the liquid 
treated to prevent the development of a scum of 
mold. If this is not done a thin film will appear on the 
surface of the brine soon after fermentation ceases, 
which will spread rapidly and develop into a heavy 



832 ADVICE TO THE HOUSEWIFE 

folded membrane. This scum is a growth of micro- 
organisms which feed upon the acid formed by fer- 
mentation. If allowed to grow undisturbed^ all the 
acid will eventually be destroyed and the fermented 
material will spoil. This scum must be prevented from 
forming if the product is to be kept for a considerable 
time. Exclusion of air from the surface of the brine 
will entirely prevent its formation. There are three 
feasible methods of accomplishing this. 

The first method is to cover the surface with very 
hot^ melted paraffin. If the paraffin is sufficiently hot 
to make the brine boil when poured upon it, a smooth, 
even layer will be formed before hardening,- making ' 
a perfectly air-tight seal. Before adding paraffin the 
containers should be set where they will not be dis- 
turbed until ready for use, as any attempt to move 
them afterwards may break the seal and necessitate 
resealing. Paraffin has the advantage of ease in han- 
dling, and of being easily separated from the fermented 
vegetables when they are removed. Further, it can 
be used over again and thus, the expense is small in the 
long run. If it becomes dirty it can be purified by 
heating very hot and straining through several thick- 
nesses of cheese-cloth. One disadvantage in the use of 
paraffin is that the formation of gas below the layer 
will break the seal; therefore it should not be used 
until fermentation has ceased. If the paraffin breaks, 
it should be removed, remelted, and replaced. 

The second method is to pack a barrel or keg full 
and then replace the head. Fill the barrel or keg 
as full as possible with the fresh material to be fer- 
mented and then add the round board and weights 
exactly as described heretofore. Let the barrel stand 
for 48 hours to allow part of the gas to escape. Then 



FERMENTATION AND SALTING 333 

remove the board and weight, and head the barrel or 
keg up tight. Bore a small hole (about | inch) in 
the head and fill the barrel full with brine (made by 
dissolving f cup salt in 1 gallon water) so that there is 
no air space. Allow the barrel to stand until the fer- 
mentation has stopped, adding more brine at intervals 
to keep the container full. When bubbling has stopped, 
plug the vent tight. If the barrel does not leak, fer- 
mented products put up in this manner will keep 
indefinitely. 

The third method is to use an oil, like cottonseed 
oil, which floats on the surface and eflfectively prevents 
air from reaching the brine. Brine covered with a 
layer of cottonseed oil or some other wholesome 
oil about i inch thick will keep indefinitely. The only 
objection to liquid oils is the difficulty of getting at 
the preserved vegetables without getting them covered 
with the oil, which is difficult to remove. Before the 
vegetables are to be removed, the oil should be skimmed 
or siphoned off from the surface of the brine. 

If oil or paraffin is used to cover the brine, it is advis- 
able, after fermentation is finished, to adjust the amount 
of brine used, and the weights on the cover, so that the 
brine comes up to but not over the cover. In this case 
only the brine exposed between the cover and sides 
need be oiled or paraffined, thus saving covering 
material. 

Experiments by the department have shown that 
the following vegetables may be preserved success- 
fully, under home conditions, by the above method of 
fermentation by dry salting: Cabbage (sauerkraut), 
string beans, beet tops, and turnip tops, and it is 
probable that others may be added to this list as a 
result of further experiments. In general the method 



334 ADVICE TO THE HOUSEWIFE 

described above should be followed for all y^etables 
preserved by this method, with modifications in the 
preservation of some of them as follows: 

Saoerkraiit or Fennented Silt CabtMge 

In many parts of the country it is a general belief 
that only late or fall cabbage is suitable for making 
sauerkraut. Such, however, is not the case. If 
properly handled and stored, sauerkraut of excellent 
quaJity can be produced from cabbage matiuing at any 
season of the year. The essential points are the use 
of only mature, sound cabbage, scrupulous cleanli- 
ness throughout the process, and proper care of the 
surface of the brine after fermentation is completed. 

In making sauerkraut for home purposes, the outer 
green leaves of the cabbage should be removed, just 
as in preparing the head for boiling. In addition all 
decayed or bruised leaves should be discarded and the 
core removed. If an instrument for this purpose is 
not available it is advisable to quarter the heads and 
slice off the part of the core remaining on each quarter. 
The cabbage should be shredded by one of the hand- 
shredding machines sold upon the market for such 
purposes, or if one is not available the heads may 
be cut into thin sUces with a slaw cutter or a large 
knife. 

The shredded cabbage should be packed immediately 
into a perfectly clean, water-tight receptacle, such as a 
cider or wine barrel, keg, or tub. As it is packed into 
the receptacle, add salt in the proportion of 1 pound 
of salt to 40 pounds of cabbage, distributing it evenly 
throughout the cabbage, as described. Experiments 
have shown that approximately 2§ pounds of salt 
to each 100 pounds of shredded cabbage give the 



FERMENTATION AND SALTING 336 

best flavor to the resulting kraut. When the barrel 
or crock is nearly full, the cabbage should be pressed 
down as firmly as possible and covered with a clean 
board cover. It is advisable but not essential that 
clean cloth be placed over the cabbage before the cover 
is put into place. The salt soon extracts a considerable 
amount of the cabbage juice from the cabbage, and a 
sufficient weight of clean brick or stone should be 
added to cause the brine to rise up to the wooden 
cover. Set the container aside until fermentation is 
complete, skim off any scum that forms and protect 
the surface by pouring over it a layer of paraffin, as 
described. If paraffin is not added, the scum de- 
velops very rapidly during warm weather and soon 
destroys the acid of the brine and the sauerkraut 
beneath. If the sauerkraut is made during the fall 
and stored in a cool place, there is no absolute neces- 
sity of a layer of paraffin, since the low temperature 
will prevent the growth of the organism which destroys 
lactic acid and causes decomposition. No doubt the 
popular idea that sauerkraut made from early cabbage 
will not keep is based upon the fact that the fermenta- 
tion of sauerkraut made from such cabbage occiu*s 
in warm weather and the rapid growth of scum soon 
destroys both brine and kraut if the surface is not 
properly protected. 

String Beans 

String beans should be young and tender and not 
overgrown. Remove the tip ends and strings, cut or 
break the beans into pieces about 2 inches long, and 
pack as described on page 330. If desired, the beans 
may be shredded by cutting lengthwise several times, 
and the fermented product prepared like sauerkraut. 



336 ADVICE TO THE HOUSEWIFE 

Beet Tops and Turnip Tops 

Wash to remove grit and follow general directions 
as described on page 330. 

Fermentation in Biine 

As stated above, some vegetables which do not 
contain sufficient water are better fermented by cover- 
ing them with a weak brine. 

Wash the vegetables, drain off the surplus water, 
and pack them in a keg, crock, or other utensil until it 
is nearly full (within about 3 inches of the top of the 
vessel). Prepare a weak brine as follows: To each 
gallon of water used add | pint of vinegar and f cup 
of salt and stir until the salt is entirely dissolved. 
The amount of brine necessary to cover the vegetables 
will be about equal to one-half the volume of the mate- 
rial to be fermented. This is very easily calculated by 
knowing the contents of the container used. For 
example, if a 5-gaIlon keg is to be packed, 2? gallons 
will be needed. It is best to make up at one time all 
the brine needed on one day. A clean tub or barrel 
can be used for mixing the brine. Pour the brine over 
the vegetables, and cover as described. Set the ves- 
sel and its contents away in a moderately warm room 
to ferment. When fermentation has stopped, the 
container should be placed in a cool cellar or store- 
room and the surface of the liquid treated, to pre- 
vent mold, by one of the methods described above. 
Before adding the paraffin or cottonseed oil, any 
scum or mold which may have formed on the surface 
of the liquid should be removed by skimming. 

Experience has shown that the following vegetables 
may be preserved satisfactorily by fermenting in 
brine: cucumbers, string beans, green tomatoes, beets, 



4 



FERMENTATION AND SALTING 337 

beet tops, turnip tops, corn, and green peas. The 
general directions given should be followed, but some 
modifications are desirable in the preserving of in- 
dividual vegetables by this method, and these are 
given in the following pages. 

Cocombers 

Wash the cucumbers and pack into a clean, water- 
tight keg or crock. On the bottom of the container 
place a layer of dill and a handful of mixed spice. 
When the container is full, add more dill and spice. 
Add sufficient brine to cover the material. When 
nearly full, cover with a clean cloth and a board cover 
weighted with stone, as described. The dill and spices 
may be omitted if desired. 

String Beans 

Remove the ends and strings from the beans and cut 
into pieces about 2 inches long, pack in the container, 
cover with brine, and ferment, as described on page 336. 

Green Tomatoes 

Green tomatoes should be packed whole and pre- 
pared as cucumbers. The dill and spice may be added 
if desired. 

Beets 

Beets must be scrubbed thoroughly and packed 
whole. If peeled or sUced before being fermented, the 
beets lose considerable color and flavor. 

Beet Tops and Turnip Tops 

These should be washed thoroughly and packed into 
the container without being cut up. 



338 ADVICE TO THE HOUSEWIFE 

Peas 

Green peas should be shelled and packed in the same 
way as string beans. It is advisable to use fairly small 
containers for peas so that the quantity opened up 
will be used before it has a chance to spoil. 

Com 

Husk and clean the silk from the com; wash and 
place the ears on end in the jar, packing the jar nearly 
full. Pour the brine over the ears; add cover and 
weights. Fermented corn has a sour taste, which 
may not be relished if the com is eaten alone. For 
this reason it will be preferable in most cases to pre- 
serve com by canning, drying, or by salting, as described 
on page 339. Fermented corn, however, may be used 
in the preparation of some dishes, such as chowders, 
omelets, etc., where its flavor will be masked to some 
extent by the other ingredients, and the acid taste of 
the fermented corn may not be objectionable to some 
people. 

Salting without Fermentation 

In this method the vegetables are packed with enough 
salt to prevent fermentation or the growth of yeasts or 
molds. The following directions should be followed 
in salting vegetables: 

Wash the vegetables, drain ofif the water, and then 
weigh them. For each 100 pounds of vegetables weigh 
out 25 pounds of salt. For smaller quantities use the 
same proportion of salt (one-fourth of the weight of the 
vegetables). Spread a layer of the vegetables about 
1 inch deep on the bottom of a clean keg, tub, or crock, 
and sprinkle heavily with some of the salt. Try to 
distribute the salt evenly among the different layers 
packed so that the quantity weighed out wiU be 



! 

I 



FERMENTATION AND SALTING 339 

just enough to pack the vegetables. Continue adding 
layers of vegetables and salt until the container is 
nearly full and then cover with the clean cloth, board, 
and weighty as in the case of fermentation by dry 
salting. The keg or other container should then be 
set aside in a cool place. If the salt and pressure of 
the weight have not extracted sufficient brine to 
cover the vegetables, after 24 hours, prepare a strong 
brine by dissolving 1 pound of salt in 2 quarts of water 
and pour enough of this over the vegetables to come 
up to the round wooden cover. There will be a small 
amount of bubbUng at the start, as in the case of the 
fermented vegetables, but this will not continue 
for long. Just as soon as the bubbling has stopped, 
the surface of the hquid should be protected by one of 
the methods described. 

Experiments have shown that the following vege- 
tables may be satisfactorily preserved by the above 
method: dandeUons, beet tops, turnip top, spinach, 
chard, kale, cabbage, string beans, green peas, and corn. 
The string beans should be cut in 2-inch pieces, as in 
their preparation for fermentation. The peas should 
be shelled and packed according to the directions given 
above. Cabbage should be shredded and packed 
in the same way as in the manufacture of sauerkraut. 
Corn, however, requires somewhat different treatment, 
and the directions for salting it are as follows: 

Salted Com 

Husk the ears of corn and remove the silk. Cook 
in boiUng water for about 10 minutes to set the milk. 
Cut oflf the corn from the cob with a sharp knife. 
Weigh the corn, and pack in layers with one-fourth its 
weight of fine salt, as described above. 



340 ADVICE TO THE HQDBEWIFB 

Care and Storage of Fennented and Salted Pcoducts 

If properly prepared and stored^ fermented and salted 
products will keep for a long time. It is absolutely 
necessary to prevent mold from growing on the surface 
of the brine of fermented vegetables by the addition 
of paraflin or in some other way^ as described. Pro- 
tection of the surface of salted vegetables is desir- 
able^ but not necessary if the containers are covered to 
prevent the evaporation of the brine. Practically all 
of the trouble with the fermented or salted products 
may be traced to carelessness in protecting the surface 
of the brine. In case mold should develop upon the 
surface^ or the brine should become evaporated so that 
the upper layers of the food spoil, this does not mean 
necessarily that the entire contents of the vessel 
has spoiled, even though the upper layers may have 
a very disagreeable odor. The molds and other 
organisms which cause the spoiling do not penetrate 
rapidly to the lower layers, and by carefully remov- 
ing the spoiled material from the top, adding a little 
fresh brine and pouring hot paraffin on the top, the 
remainder of the contents of the vessel may be saved. 
After fermentation has ceased, the containers of 
salted and fermented vegetables should be stored in a 
cool place. They should be protected from rats, mice, 
and vermin, which might eat through the paraffin 
layer and get at the contents. 

Preparation of Fermented and Salted Vegetables for 

the Table 

Some fermented and salted vegetables, like cucum- 
bers, are eaten raw; others, like cabbage (sauerkraut), 
are usually cooked. In general the fermented and 



FERMENTATION AND SALTING 341 

salted products may be prepared for the table in much 
the same manner as the fresh vegetables, except that 
before being cooked they should be soaked in fresh 
water for several hours or longer, if necessary, to 
remove the salt, the water being changed several times. 
In some cases it may be necessary also to change 
the water once or twice during the boiUng of the salted 
vegetables. In this, one should be guided by taste. 

Fermented vegetables, after being removed from the 
container, should be rinsed thoroughly in fresh water 
and then cooked without soaking if a product having 
a decidedly acid flavor is desired. If one does not 
desire the acid flavor, it may be modified to any extent 
or removed almost entirely by soaking the fermented 
vegetables as directed above for the salted product. 

The following suggestions and recipes are given as a 
guide in the preparation of salted and fermented vege- 
tables for the table. These have been tested and found 
to give satisfactory results. 

Dandelions, Spinach, Kale, and Other Greens 

The salted greens, after they have been soaked to 
remove the salt, may be boiled with fat meat, or 
boiled plain, served with a cream saiuce and garnished 
with hard-boiled eggs. When so prepared they taste 
much like the fresh greens, although, natiu'ally, they 
lose some of their flavor during the salting and fresh- 
ening process. 

The fermented greens may be soaked and cooked 
in the same way as the salted greens, but, in general, 
it is desirable to cook them without soaking and to 
preserve the acid flavor, which is very similar to 
that of the fresh greens when boiled and served with 
vinegar. 



342 ADVICE TO THE HOUSEWIFE 

Beets 

Rinse the fermented beets and boil in the same 
manner as fresh beets. When thus prepared they 
have a flavor which is not unlike the common pickled 
beets, and they may be served as a pickle, with butter, 
or used in the preparation of salads, vegetable hashes, 
etc. 

String Beans 

The salted string beans should be soaked to remove 
the salt and then cooked in any of the ways in which 
fresh string beans are prepared. The fermented 
string beans may be cooked without soaking and served 
as a vegetable or as an ingredient of a salad, the acid 
flavor being agreeable to many persons. Young 
and tender string beans may be fermented and eaten 
raw in the same way as cucumber pickles. 

Com 

To prepare the fermented or salted com for the 
table, rinse it thoroughly and soak it for 4 or 5 hours, 
changing the water frequently. In general it wiU 
be found more satisfactory to remove practically 
all of the acid flavor from the fermented corn. After 
soaking, place the corn in cold water and bring to boil, 
pour off the water, add fresh cold water, bring to 
boil again, and cook until tender. The cooked salted 
or fermented corn may be used in the following recipes 
which are given below, or may be served as stewed 
corn or succotash.

INTRODUCTION 

For those persons who are fortunate enough to 
control land for the growing of vegetables in sufficient 
quantity for the needs of the family, storage will prove 
an economy. Likewise, it will often prove an economy 
to grow late vegetables to store. Home storage is of 
importance at all times, but especially so if the price 
of suitable containers for use in canning and drying 
is high. Crops of suitable sorts that mature at a 
season when they can be preserved by storing, should 
be kept in their natural condition instead of being 
canned or dried. Not only is it possible to reduce the 
cost of the menu materially by growing and storing 

346 



HOME STORAGE OF VEGETABLES, ETC. 347 

vegetables for home use, but the satisfaction of having 
a supply of fresh vegetables near at hand, so that 
regardless of markets and winter temperatures the 
list may be varied, is something that can not be 
measured in dollars and cents. 

A half-acre garden, if cared for properly, will produce 
far more vegetables than the average family can con- 
sume during the maturing period of the crops. Only 
a small portion of the garden should be devoted to 
those vegetables which must be used as soon as they 
reach maturity. Beets, late cabbage, carrots, celery, 
onions, parsnips, potatoes, sweet potatoes, salsify and 
turnips may be stored in their natural condition, and 
should be grown, to the extent of the family needs, 
for storage for winter use. Beans of various kinds, 
including the Limas, may be stored dry. The suc- 
cessful storage of vegetables is not at all difficult; 
in fact, good storage facilities already exist in most 
homes, it being only necessary to make use of the cellar, 
the attic, a large closet, or some other part of the 
dwelling, depending upon the character of the prod- 
uct to be stored. 

Types of Storage 

A Storage Room in the Basement of the DweUing 

A cool, well-ventilated cellar under the dwelling offers 
good conditions for the storage of vegetables. Many 
cellars are not well suited for storing vegetables because 
of poor insulation or lack of ventilation. Cellars 
containing a furnace for heating the dwelling, usually 
are too warm and too dry for the storage of root crops. 
It is often possible, however, to partition off a room, 
either in one comer or at one end of the cellar, where 
the temperature may be controlled by means of out- 



348 ADYICaS TO THE HOUSEWIFE 

side windows. At least one window is neoessaiy, and 
two or more are desirable for admitting li^t and for 
ventilation. 

CONBTBUCnOir OF THE 8TOBAGX BOOM 

The sise of the storage room should be detennined 
by the space available and the amount of material to 
be stored. Natural earth makes a better floor than 
concrete or brick, as a certain amount of moisture is 
desirable. The walls of the storage room should be 
parallel to the walls of the cellar. Lay 2- by 4-inch 
scantling flat on the floor; and secure them with p^3 
driven into the floor, or by nailing them to the top of 
short posts set in the ground. Set 2- by 4-inch studding 
from the sill to the ceiling, spacing them 16 inches apart 
from center to center. Locate the door to the storage 
room at the most convenient point, making it laige 
enough to admit barrels, boxes, etc., a good size being 
2^ feet wide by 6} feet high. Set the studs on either 
side of the door 32 inches apart, which will allow for 
the door and the frame. Put a header over the door, 
allowing 1 inch for the frame and { inch for the sill 
at the bottom. Set the studs against the walls where 
the cellar walls and storage-room walls meet. Care 
exercised in making the frame square and plumb 
will enable the builder to get the structure tight with a 
minimum of labor. A good room is made by covering 
the studding on the outside with tongue-and^roove* 
material, but a better way is to sheathe the outside with 
plain lumber, tack building paper on this, and side 
with tongue-and-groove material. This construction, 
in connection with lath and plaster or wall board on the 
inside, makes an excellent room. 
. Ventilation may be secured by opening one or more 



home;storage of vegetables, etc. 349 

windows. An air duct constructed of wood, metal, 
or terra cotta, and fitted in one of the windows, is 
desirable, as it permits the cool air to enter at the bot- 
tom of the room. Two or more joints of 6-inch stove- 
pipe, one with a damper and an elbow, may be used. 
A piece of board with a hole the size of the pipe is 
fitted in the window in place of one of the panes of 
glass. Another pane of glass may be removed from the 
sash and a small hinged door fitted in its place, which, 
when opened, allows the heated air to escape. In 
cold weather both the hinged door and the damper 
in the stovepipe must be closed. The windows in the 
storage room should be darkened in order to protect 
the vegetables from the Ught. 

Barrels, crates, boxes, or bins may be used as con- 
tainers for the various vegetables, but movable con- 
tainers are preferable to built-in bins, as it is possible* 
to remove them for cleaning. It is advisable to con- 
struct shelves or a slat floor to keep the crates, boxes, 
baskets, and other containers off the ground. This 
is highly desirable, to insure a free circulation of air 
and to prevent the containers from harboring mice, 
rats, and other vermin. The shelves for canned 
goods along one side of the room need not be more 
than 6 inches wide. 

Otttdoor Storage CeUaire 

Outdoor storage cellars or caves are excellent for the 
storage of many vegetables. They are particularly 
desirable on the farm, as they afford convenient and 
inexpensive storage facilities for surplus vegetable 
crops that otherwise might be lost. They possess all 
the advantages of the storage room in the basement 
and are superior in many respects. The outdoor 



350 ADVICE TO THE HOUSEWIFE 

storage cellar can be maintained at a uniform tempera- 
ture over a long period. It is possible to keep the 
cellar cool, and quickly to reduce the temperature of 
the stored product to the desired point for safe storage, 
by opening the door during the night and closing it 
in the morning before the air becomes warm. AH 
ventilators should likewise be kept tightly closed 
until the outside air is again cooler than that within 
the cellar, when they should be opened, unless the out- 
side temperature is so low as to be dangerous. This 
safeguards the product and adds to the efficiency of 
the storage chamber. Vegetables can be more con- 
veniently placed in such a cellar than in the storage 
room in the basement of a dwelling. 

When the chief use of the outdoor storage cellar 
is for storing turnips, beets, carrots, and other root 
crops commonly used as stock food, it should be lo- 
cated near the stable, where the material will be con- 
venient for winter feeding. When it is to be used 
for vegetables for the table, the cellar should be acces- | 
sible from the kitchen at all times. If apples or other 
fruits are to be stored in an outdoor ^storage cellar 
it is desirable to have a two-compartment cellar, 
one for vegetables and one for apples, with a ventilating 
apparatus in each compartment. 

CONSTBUCnON OF THB OUTDOOB STOBAQB CBLLAB 

As the root cellar must be weatherproof, that is, 
capable of being kept free from moisture and free from 
frost, its type and construction vary with the geo- 
graphical location. In the southern portion of the 
country the structure is usually entirely above ground, 
and is protected by only a few inches of sod and 
with straw, leaves, etc. In northern sections outdoor 



HOME STORAGE OF VEGETABLES, ETC. '3S1 

storage cellars are made almost entirely below ground 
and covered with a foot or two of earth. 

STORAOB IN BBGIONS OF MILD WINTBBB 

An aboveground storage cellar suited to conditions 
in southern sections of the United States may be 
built on a well-drained site at slight expense. A row 
of posts may be set 5 or 6 feet apart, extending 7 or 
8 feet above the surface of the ground, with a ridge- 
pole placed on top of them. Against each side of the 
ridgepole a row of planks or puncheons is placed, with 
their opposite ends resting in a shallow trench 4 or 5 
feet from the line of posts. The ends are boarded up, 
a door being provided in one end of the structure, and 
the roof covered with sod to a depth of 5 or 6 inches. 

8TOBAGE IN BBQIONS OF SBVBBB FBBBZBS 

In sections where low temperatures prevail it is 
necessary to insulate the storage house, so that the 
vegetables will not freeze. An aboveground type of 
storage house much used in many sections of the 
North has thick walls filled with insulating material, 
such as sawdust or shavings. The construction is of 
frame, and the walls are usually 10 to 12 inches thick. 
Both the inside and the outside walls are sheathed with 
matched lumber so as to make them air-tight. The 
rafters are ceiled on the under side with the same 
material and the space between the rafters filled with 
dry insulating material. The use of building paper 
in the roof and walls of the storage house is of great 
assistance in insulating. Ventilation is provided in 
the same manner as in the outdoor storage cellar built 
of concrete. 



362 ADVICE TO THE HOUSEWIFE 

A type of storage cellar much used in northern sec- 
tions of the country is built partly under ground. 
The walls are of masonry and extend to a point just 
above the surface of the ground. On these walls, plates 
are set and a roof of frame construction erected. The 
roof structure is ceiled on the imder side of the rafters, 
and some suitable insulating material, such as dry 
sawdust or shavings, packed in the space between the 
rafters; and then the sheathing, paper, and roofing 
material are applied as in the case of the aboveground 
type of storage cellar described in the previous para- 
graph. This type of structure is preferable in many 
respects to the aboveground type, as it is easier to 
maintain the temperature at the proper point and its 
insulation is a comparatively easy matter. 

Protection from freezing may be secured with a sim- 
pler type of structure by making it entirely under 
ground. In order to avoid steps down to the level of 
the floor, with the consequent extra labor in storing 
and removing the vegetables, a sidehill location is 
desirable. 

The excavation in the hill should be of the approxi- 
mate size of the cellar, using the dirt for covering the roof 
and for banking the sides of the structure. A frame 
is erected by setting two rows of posts of uniform height 
in the bottom of the pit near the dirt walls, and a third 
line of posts, about 6 feet higher, through the center of 
the pit. These posts serve as supports for the planks or 
pimcheons forming the roof of the structure, as with the 
above-ground type of storage cellar already described. 
The door is placed at one end and a ventilator put in 
the roof. The whole structure, with the exception of 
the portion occupied by the door, is covered with dirt 
and sod. The thickness of the covering must be deter- 



HOME STORAGE OF VEGETABLES, ETC. 353 

mined by the location; the colder the climate the 
thicker the covering. The dirt covering may be sup- 
plemented in winter by a layer of manure, straw, corn 
fodder, etc. Outdoor storage cellars usually are left 
with dirt floors, as a certain degree of moisture is desir- 
able. These cellars may also be made of concrete, 
brick, hollow tile, stone, or other material. 

OUTDOOB STORAGE CELLABS BUILT OF CONCBBTB 

The type of outdoor storage cellar described above, 
while low in first cost, is short Uved, as the conditions 
in the cellar are favorable to the decay of wood. The 
concrete storage cellar, although rather high in first 
cost, as compared with wood, is a permanent structure. 
Concrete possesses several advantages over brick, 
stone, or other decay-resisting materials. In the 
construction of a small structure suitable for the home, 
it is possible to make the roof self-supporting and to 
employ unskilled labor, thus lessening the cost. It 
is a simple matter to waterproof concrete, a feature 
highly desirable in a storage cellar. 

For detailed information in reference to the mixing 
and handUng of concrete, the reader is referred to 
Farmers' Bulletin 461, entitled " The Use of Concrete 
on the Farm." 

The site for the concrete storage cellar should be 
selected with the same considerations in mind as for 
the wood-frame cellar, namely, a well-drained con- 
venient location, preferably a sidehill, into which it 
may be built. The excavation should be just large 
enough for the dirt walls to serve as the outside form 
for the concrete. For that portion of the wall which 
is above the surface of the ground, a board form must 
be used. The inside form usually is made of boards 



354 ADVICE TO THE HOUSEWIFE 

held in place by scantling spaced about 18 inches 
apart. Temporary supports should be placed across 
the top to carry the form, so that it ^dll be of size 
and shape desired. The side walls and roof should 
be so constructed that there will be no joints to -weaken 
the structiu'e. The form for the ceiling xnay be 
slightly arched by setting a temporary line of poets 
through the middle of the excavation. A plate 
placed on these posts a few inches higher than the height 
of the side walls, will allow the form boards to be 
laid crosswise of the cellar, springing the ends down 
and securing them to the forms for the inside of the 
walls. An arch a few inches high makes a strong roof 
and helps in ventilating the cellar. 

The whole structure, with the exception of the portion 
occupied by the door, is covered with earth to prevent 
freezing, the thickness of the earth covering depending 
upon the geographical location. In the colder sections 
of the country 2 or 3 feet is not too much, and addi- 
tional protection may be given by using a supple- 
mentary covering of straw, fodder, or manure. In 
severely cold weather, both the top and bottom air 
ducts must be closed. It is well to cover the outside 
ends of the air inlets by woven wire in order to prevent 
small animals from entering the storage cellar. 

A popular type of cellar is 10 feet wide, 12 feet long, 
and 8 feet high and will contain the products of an acre 
garden. The walls are of 6-inch concrete reinforced 
by f-inch iron rods. The floor is earth, as this permits 
good moisture conditions for the storage of vegetables. 
The structure is provided with a ventilating flue in 
the roof and an air inlet in the floor for the admis- 
sion of cool air. 

The storage capacity may be increased by making 



HOME STORAGE OF VEGETABLES, ETC. 356 

the structure longer, but when this is done additional 
ventilators must be provided. If the width is increased, 
either middle piers should be used to assist in carrying 
the roof, or the roof should be arched. A cellar 6 
feet wide, 8 feet long, and 7 feet high will provide the 
necessary storage space for the products of a small 
home garden and may be built in the same manner 
as the one described above. 

THB BTOBAGS CELLAB ITNDBR AN OUTBUILDING 

Sometimes it is possible to build a storage cellar as 
the lower story of, and foundation for, an outbuilding. 
When this is done it is desirable to have the cellar 
almost entirely under ground and well insulated by 
banking the outside walls with dirt. The ceiling of the 
cellair may be made frostproof by constructing a double 
wall to be filled with dry sawdust, shavings, or other 
insulating material. Concrete is a good material of 
which to construct the side walls of the cellar, although 
brick, stone, tile, etc., may be used. The entrance may 
be through the floor of the room above, or through an 
outside door placed in one end of the cellar and reached 
by steps or a grade entrance. Ventilation may be 
secured by placing a shaft from the ceiling of the cellar 
through the room above to the roof, or by placing the 
ventilators in the side walls near the ceiling. The 
inlet ducts should be put in the floor, as in other out- 
door concrete cellars, and their outer ends covered with 
wire screen. 

Storage in Banks or Pits 

Outside banks or pits are used very generally for 
keeping vegetables. The conical pit is used commonly 
for such vegetables as potatoes, carrots, beets, turnips, 



366 ADVICE TO THE HOUSEWIFE 

salsify, parsnipsi and heads of cabbage; and is con- 
structed as follows: A well-drained location should 
be chosen and the product piled on the surface of the 
ground; or a shallow excavation may be made of suit- 
able size and 6 or 8 inches deep, which may be lined 
with straw, leaves, or similar material, and the vege- 
tables placed on the litter in a conical pile. The vege- 
tables should then be covered with straw or similar 
material and finally with earth, to a depth of 2 or 3 
inches. As winter approaches, the dirt covering should 
be increased until it is several inches thick. The depth 
of the earth covering is determined by the severity of 
the winters in the particular locality. It is well to 
cover the pits with straw, corn fodder, or manure 
during severely cold weather. 

The amount of ventilation necessary will depend upon 
the size of the pit. Small pits containing but a few 
bushels of vegetables will receive suj£cient ventilation 
if the straw between the vegetables and dirt is allowed 
to extend through the dirt at the apex of the pile. This 
should be covered with a board or piece of tin held in 
place by a stone to protect it from rain. In larger pits 
ventilation may be secured by placing two or three 
pieces of rough boards or stakes up through the center 
of the pile of vegetables^ so that a flue is formed. This 
fiue is capped by a trough formed of two pieces of board 
nailed together at right angles. 

Vegetables keep very well in sucn pits, but it is 
difficult to get them out in cold weather, so that when 
a pit is opened it is desirable to remove its entire con- 
tents at once. For this reason it is advisable to con- 
struct several small pits rather than one large one, 
and instead of storing each crop in a pit by itself it is 
better to place a small quantity of several kinds of 



HOME STORAGE OF VEGETABLES, ETC. 367 

vegetables in the same pit, so that it will be necessary 
to open only one bank to get a supply of all of them. 
In storing several crops in the same bank, it is a good 
plan to separate them with straw, leaves, or other 
material. The vegetables from the small pit may be 
placed temporarily in the storage room in the base- 
ment, where they will be easily accessible as needed 
for the table. 

Storage of Various Vegetables 

Beans and Peas 

Beans may be kept for winter use by picking the pods 
as soon as they are mature and spreading them in a 
warm, dry place, such as an attic floor, until the beans 
are thoroughly dry. Then shell, and store in bags hung 
in a dry, well-ventilated place until needed. Allow 
navy and other bush beans to matiu'e on the vines until 
a maximum number of pods are ripe; then pull the 
whole plant and cure it Uke hay. After thorough 
dr3ring, thrash the beans, and store as suggested 
above. 

Peas may be treated like bush beans and stored in 
the same manner. 

Late Beets 

Storage for beets may be of any of the types described. 
The beets should be pulled and the tops cut off when 
the soil is dry. If they are to be kept in the storage 
room in the basement or in an outdoor storage cellar, 
they should be placed in ventilated barrels, loose 
boxes, or, better still, in crates. If sufficient space is 
available in the cellar, it is a good plan simply to place 
them in small piles along the wall. Storage in large 



358 ADVICE TO THE HOUSEWIFE 

piles should be avoided, as it is liable to cause heatmg 
and decay. 

For storage in banks or pits, prepare the beets as for 
storage in the room in the basement or in the out- 
door cellar. Select a well-drained location, make a 
shallow excavation, about 6 inches deep, line it with 
straw, hay, leaves, or similar material, and place the 
beets in a conical pile on the lining. Make the bottom 
of the pile about the same size as but not larger than the 
bottom of the excavation. Cover the beets with the 
same material as that used for lining the bottom of 
the pit, and carry it up several inches above the apex 
of the pile of vegetables, having it extend through the 
dirt covering. This serves as a ventilating flue, and 
it should be covered with a piece of tin or a short 
board as a protection from rain. The dirt covering 
should be 2 or 3 inches thick when the vegetables are 
stored, and it should be increased as severely-cold 
weather approaches, until it is a foot or more in thick- 
ness. In finishing the pit, the dirt should be firmed with 
the back of the shovel in order to make it as nearly 
waterproof as possible. 

The shallow trench around the base of the pit should 
have an outlet for carrying off the water. Supple- 
ment the dirt covering with manure, straw, corn fodder, 
or other protecting material. Use several smaU pits 
instead of one large one, as vegetables keep better 
in small pits and the entire contents may be removed 
when the pit is opened. 

Late Cabbages 

Heads of late cabbage may be cut and stored in 
conical pits in the same manner as beets. Another 



HOME STORAGE OF VEGETABLES, ETC. 359 

common and very satisfactory method is to pull the 
plants, roots and all, and place them in a long pit 
with the heads down. A few heads may be removed 
from time to time without disturbing the remainder 
of the pit. As slight freezing does not injure the cab- 
bage, the covering of the pit need not be as thick as for 
other vegetables. 

Another good method of storing cabbage is as fol- 
lows: The plants are pulled, roots and all, and set 
side by side, with the roots down, in a shallow trench, 
the length of which corresponds to the width of the bed. 
The bed may be any width up to 8 or 10 feet and as 
long as necessary to hold the number of cabbages to be 
stored. Cover the roots with earth. Around the bed 
erect a frame of rails, boards, or poles, or consisting of 
a row of stakes driven into the ground, so that an inclo- 
sure about 2 feet in height is formed. Bank the outside 
of this frame with dirt, and place poles across the top, 
covering them with straw, hay, or corn fodder. Make 
provision for removing portions of the stored product 
from one end of the pit. This type of storage is inex- 
pensive and gives good results. When the heads are 
cut, leave the roots in position, and in the spring these 
roots will sprout and supply the family with an abun- 
dance of greens. A large percentage of the cabbage 
sprouts found on the market are produced in this 
way. 

Heads of cabbage may be laid in rows on shelves 
in an outdoor storage cellar, but not in a storage room in 
the basement of a dwelling, as the odor is likely to 
penetrate through the house. 

For information regarding the storage of cabbage 
on a large scale, see Fanners' Bulletin 433, entitled 
" Cabbage." 



960 ADVICE TO THE HOUSEWIFE. 

Carrots 

Carrots may be stored in a storage room in the base- 
ment, in outdoor storage cellars, or in banks or pits, 
. and are handled in the same way as beets. It is advis- 
able to place a small quantity in the storage room in 
the basement or in the storage cellar, and the remainder 
in banks or pits. They are not injured by slight 
freezing; hence need not be covered as deeply as 

potatoes. 

Late Celery 

Celery may be stored for a time in the position where 
grown, by placing enough earth around the base of the 
plants to hold them in good form. Allow them to 
remain in this condition until just before severe freez- 
ing occurs; then bank the earth up to the very tops of 
the plants, almost covering them, and as the weather 
becomes colder cover the ridge with coarse manure, 
straw, or corn fodder, held in place by means of stakes 
or boards. The celery may be removed as needed, 
but this method is open to the objection that it is hard 
to get the celery out when the ground is frozen. 

Another method of storing celery is to excavate a 
pit 10 to 12 inches wide to a depth of about 24 inches 
and of any desired length; thoroughly loosen the soil 
in the bottom, or shovel in loose topsoil to form a bed 
in which to set the roots of the celery; and pack this 
trench with fully grown plants, placing the roots close 
together with considerable soil adhering to them. 
Water the celery as it is placed in the trench and allow 
the trench to remain open long enough for the tops 
to become dry. Unless the soil is very dry at the time 
of storing, or extended warm weather should follow, it 
will not be necessary to apply more water. Place 
. a 12-inch board on edge along one side of the trench. 



•^"1 



HOME STORAGE OF VEGETABLES, ETC. 361 

and bank it with the surplus earth; cover the trench 
with a roof of boards^ straw on poles, or cornstalks 
from which the tops have been removed, placing 
the stalks across the pit with one end resting on the 
board and the other on the ground; spread over this a 
light covering of straw or other material which will 
pack closely, and as the weather becomes colder in- 
crease the covering to keep out the frost. Celery 
stored in this manner will keep until late in the winter. 
This method, because of its simplicity, is recommended 
for the farmer and smaU grower. 

The imused pit of a permanent hotbed may be utilized 
as a storage place for celery, by removing the surplus 
earth and substituting a covering of boards for the 
sash. Store the celery in the same manner as in the 
trench, and cover the bed with any material which 
will keep out frost. 

Celery may be stored on the floor of a storage room 
in the basement of a dwelUng or in an outdoor stor- 
age cellar. Take up the plants just before freezing 
occurs, with considerable earth adhering, and set them 
on the floor with the roots packed together as closely 
as possible. If moderately moist, the celery will keep 
well imder the conditions found in most storage cellars. 
Celery should not be stored in the same cellar as tur- 
nips or cabbage, as it will absorb the odor of these 
vegetables, ruining its flavor. 

For further information regarding the cultivation 
and storage of celery, see Farmers' Bulletin 282, en- 
titled "Celery." 

Onions 

To keep well, onions must be mature and thoroughly 
dry. Put them in ventilated barrels, baskets, crates, 



862 ADVICE TO THE HOUSEWIFE 

or loosely woYen bags, as good yentilation is essential 
to the keeping of onions. A dry, well-ventilated place, 
such as an attic, furnishes a good storage space for 
onions, as slight freezing does not injure them, provided 
they are not handled while frosen. 

For fiu*ther information regarding the storage of 
onions, see Farmers' Bulletin 354, entitled '' Onion 
Culture." 

Ptrsnips 

' Parsnips may be allowed to remain in the ground 
and dug as needed, as freezing does not injure them. 
However, as it is a difficult matter to dig them when ; 
the ground is frozen, it is advisable to store a small 1 
quantity in the storage room in the basement of the 
dwelling, or in the outdoor storage cellar, for use during 
the period when the ground is frozen. Parsnips may 
be stored in the same manner as beets and carrots. 

Potatoes, Irish 

The Irish potato is the most important vegetable in 
the northern portions of the United States and is stored 
in large quantities for winter use. It may be kept in 
the storage room in the basement, in outdoor storage 
cellars, and in banks or pits. When stored in cellars, 
the potatoes may be put into barrels, boxes, baskets, 
crates, bins, or on the floor, but must be protected from 
the light. When stored in banks or pits they are 
handled in the same way as beets, carrots, etc. Pota- 
toes must be protected from freezing, and before 
winter sets in, the pit must be covered with manure, 
straw, or other material in addition to several inches 
of earth. It is a good plan to place the major portion 
of the crop in banks or pits, and a small quantity in 



HOME STORAGE OF VEGETABLES, ETC. 363 

the storage room in the basement or in the outdoor 
storage cellar, for immediate use. 

For more detailed information on the storage of pota* 
toes, read Farmers' Bulletin 847, entitled '' Potato 
Storage and Storage Houses.'^ 

Potatoes, Sweet 

Sweet potatoes should be mature when dug, and 
should be left exposed for a few hoiUB to dry off the 
surface moisture before being placed in storage. They 
should be handled carefully at all times, as they are 
bruised easily. This crop may be kept in pits or banks 
or in outdoor storage cellars, but a warm, dry place 
is preferable. When stored in pits or banks, sweet 
potatoes are handled in much the same way as beets or 
other root crops. When kept in a specially constructed 
storage house, either in bulk or in crates, the pota- 
toes should be cured for about 10 days or 2 weeks at 
a temperature of 75® to 80® F. After the curing 
period the temperatiu*e should be reduced gradually to 
about 55® F. and maintained at that point, or as near 
it as practicable, for the remainder of the storage 
period. When well matiu*ed before digging, carefully 
handled, well cured, and held at a imiform temperature 
of about 55® F., sweet potatoes may be kept throughout 
the winter and spring. When only a few bushels of 
sweet potatoes are to be stored, they may be placed in 
the basement near the fiu*nace, on a shelf near the 
kitchen stove, near the chimney on the second floor, 
or even in the attic. 

For more detailed information on the storage of 
sweet potatoes, read Farmers' Bulletin 548, entitled 
" Storing and Marketing Sweet Potatoes." 



364 ADVICE TO THE HOUSEWIFE 

Pumpkins and Squashes 

Pumpkins and squashes may be kept for winter use 
in the storage room in the basement or in dry^ weU- 
ventilated cellars, but a dry, aboveground, frostproof 
place is best. Put them in rows on shelves so that they 
are not in contact with each other. If the temperature 
is maintained at about 40^ F., late-maturing varieties 
of these vegetables will keep until late in the winter. 

Salsify 

Salsify may be stored in the same way as beets, 
carrots, and parsnips. 

Late Turnips 

Turnips will withstand hard frost, but alternate 
freezing and thawing injures them. Gather, top, 
and store the roots in banks or pits, or in an outdoor 
storage cellar. Do not place them in the storage 
room in the basement of the dwelling, as they give off 
odors that penetrate throughout the house. 

■ 

Storage of Apples 

Apples may be kept in the storage room in the base- 
ment of the dwelling, in outdoor storage cellars, and 
in banks or pits. Conditions suitable for the keeping 
of potatoes answer fairly well for apples. Under 
some conditions it will be an advantage to store part 
of the crop in the cellar, and the late-keeping varie- 
ties suitable for spring use in outdoor banks or pits. 

For further discussion of the storage of apples, see 
Farmers' Bulletin 852, entitled " Management of 
Common Storage Houses for Apples in the Pacific 
Northwest."
