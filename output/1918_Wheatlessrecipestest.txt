Tested in the Experimental Kitchen of the Food Administration [Con- 
servation Division] and the Department of Agriculture 



WASHINGTON, APRIL, 1918 



BAKING POWDER LOAF BREADS 

(Using no Wheat.) 

AH measurements are level. — In the following recipes the weights given are accu- 
rate. The measurements are approximate; that is, they are given in the nearest 
fraction of a cup which a housewife ordinarily uses. It is convenient to remember 
in measuring unusual fractions that two level tablespoons are one-eighth cup. 



Mix the melted fat, liquid, sirup, and egg. Combine the liquid and well mixed 
dry ingredients. Bake as a loaf in a moderately hot oven (205° C. or 400° F.) for one 
hour or until thoroughly baked. 

Nuts, raisins, or dates may be added, making the breads more nutritious and very 
palatable.

CORN FLOUR AND BUCKWHEAT BREAD. 



50 Per Cent Corn Flour.

1 cup liquid. 

2 to 4 tablespoons fat. 
4 tablespoons sirup. 

2 eggs. 



1 cup liquid. 

2 to 4 tablespoons fat. 
4 tablespoons sirup. 

2 es-es.

1\ cups (5 ounces) corn flour. 
1 cup (5 ounces) buckwheat. 



BARLEY AND OAT BREAD. 

50 Per Cent Barley Flour. 

50 Per Cent Ground Rolled Oats. 



6 teaspoons baking powder. 

1 teaspoon salt. 

1-J- cups (5 ounces) barley flour. 

1 J cups (5 ounces) ground rolled oats. 



COMBINATION MUFFINS. 
(Using no Wheat.) 

METHOD OP MIXING. 

Add to the cup of milk the melted fat, sirup, and slightly beaten egg; sift the salt, 
baking powder, and flour together. Use a coarse sieve so that no part of the flour 
is wasted. Combine the two mixtures, stirring lightly without beating. Bake in a 
hot oven (437° F. or 225° C.) for 20 to 30 minutes, depending upon the size of the 
muffins. 

These recipes make 24 small muffins (3 of which make a 2-ounce serving) or 8 very 
large muffins. 

The ground rolled oats are the same as rolled oats ground in a food chopper. When 
using oats, mix them with the other sifted dry ingredients. 

When corn meal is used, mix — do not sift — the ingredients. . 

Suggestions: The wheat substitute recipes given below show that a wide variety 
of combinations is possible even when limited to the use of a few substitutes. 

All of the combinations are good. In nearly all cases a con b'nation of substitutes 
makes a better product than the use of only one substitute. 

Muffins containing oats have a particularly pleasant flavor. 

Other substitutes used with buckwheat will modify the color and improve the 
flavor of the product. The use of molasses will also do this.

WHEATLESS RECIPES. 
BISCUIT. 

(Using no wheat.) 



Sift dry materials together. Work in fat well. Combine liquid and dry materials, 
handling lightly. If oil or pat \ inch thick and cut as biscuits. Bake in a hot oven. 

Use a coarse sifter or mix instead of sifting if the flours are coarse, so that none is 
wasted. 

Biscuits made of the substitutes are less like the normal wheat flour product, par- 
ticularly in texture, than are the muffins, loaf breads, and cakes. 
If one-fourth more liquid is used, a drop biscuit having better texture is the result.

WHEATLESS RECIPES. 



CAKES. 

(Cakes made with wheat flour substitutes containing no wheat flour.) 
SPONGE CAKES, SPICE CAKES, AND CHOCOLATE CAKES. 

BARLEY SPONGE CAKE. 



1J cups barley flour (3£ ounces). 
1 cup sugar (7 ounces). 
i7 ounces). 



1 tablespoon lemon juice. 
| teaspoon salt. 



CORN (FLOUR) SPONGE CAKE. 



| cup corn flour (3-.V ounces). 
1 cup sugar (7 ounces). 
4 egg- (7 ounces). 



2 tablespoons lemon juice. 
I teaspoon salt. 



h cup oat flour (2f ounces). 
J cup corn flour (1 ounce). 
1 cup sugar (7 ounces). 



OAT SPONGE CAKE. 



4 eggs (7 ounces). 

] tablespoon lemon juice. 

£ teaspoon salt. 



J cup rice flour (3^- ounces). 
1 cup sugar (7 ounces). 
4 ec<rs (7 ounces). 



RICE SPONGE CAKE. 



1 cup sugar ( / oui 
4 eggs (7 ounces). 



2 tablespoons lemon juice. 
£ teaspoon salt. 



METHODS OF MIXING SPONGE CAKES. 



Separate whites and yolks. Beat the yolks until thick and light lemon color. 
Beat sugar into the stiffened yolks and add the lemon juice. Fold in alternately the 
stiffly beaten whites and flour. Bake in an ungreased pan for 35 to 40 minutes. 'Start 
in a moderate oven (365° F. or 185° C), and when about half done raise the tempera- 
ture to that of a hot oven (400° F. or 205° C). 

RESULTS OF SPONGE CAKES. 

These cakes are all very nice and light, texture and color good. Barley has charac- 
teristic flavor. Corn cake is especially tender and all are good textured. The extra 
lemon juice used with rice and corn seems necessary to improve the flavor.
