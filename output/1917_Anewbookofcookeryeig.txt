" The art of cookery, when not allied with a degenerate 
taste or with gluttony, is one of the criteria of a people's 
civilization^' 

" We grow like what we eat ; 
Mad food depresses, good food exults us like an 
inspiration." 



PREFACE 

T^ TTTH the advancement of the art of cookery, 
▼ » it has become impossible to compress within 
the limits of a single volume the wealth of material 
which is at hand. It is now seventeen years since 
The Boston Cooking-School Cook Book was first 
pubHshed. Since that time it has been frequently 
revised and a large number of new recipes added, 
first in the form of an appendix and addenda, later 
incorporated in logical order throughout the volume. 
But the results of the labors and experiments of 
the last seven years have, I believe, justified the 
publication of an entirely new work. It will be 
understood that this new work is in no sense a sub- 
stitute for my earlier one, but rather a sequel. 
It is, let me repeat, a comprehensive survey of the 
progress of the last few years' and contains recipes 
economical and simple as well as expensive and elab- 
orate, covering the whole range of cookery. 

My earnest hope is that the book will fulfil a 
real and vital need. I cannot send it forth without 
an expression of sincere appreciation for the kindly 
aid of enthusiastic pupils and devoted teachers.

A New Book of Cookery 

CHAPTER I 
HOW TO MEASURE AND COMBINE INGREDIENTS 

T I ^HERE is nothing which has done so much to 
-■■ place cookery on an improved basis as the almost 
universal introduction of accurate methods in 
measuring. A generation or two ago each household 
had its favorite cups and spoons of varying sizes 
which helped as guides in measuring. It was in these 
days that one often heard the statement, " Cooks are 
born, not made." Good judgment coupled with 
experience taught some to measure by sight, which 
was a step towards good results, but the vast ma- 
jority needed definite guides. Thus arose the neces- 
sity of uniform measuring cups and spoons which 
are an essential in every kitchen. 

Measuring cups (holding one-half pint), divided 
into quarters or thirds, are made of tin, graniteware, 
or glass and may be bought of any dealer in kitchen 
furnishings or at large department stores. Measur- 
ing spoons come in two sizes, the smaller of which is 
called a teaspoon, the larger a tablespoon. Mixing 
spoons, which are somewhat larger than tablespoons, 
should not be confounded with them. A case knife, 
which is used for levelling as well as dividing ingre- 



2 A NEW BOOK OF COOKERY 

dients, is also necessary to make measuring as 
accurate as is possible. 

All ingredients are measured level. 

A cupful is measured level. 

A tablespoonful is measured level. 

A teaspoonful is measured level. 

TO MEASURE DRY INGREDIENTS 

I. By cupfuls. 

Put in the ingredient to be measured by spoon- 
fuls or from a scoop, round slightly and level with a 
case knife for a cupful. For fractions of cupfuls 
fill in like manner to correct division line indicated 
in cup. Never shake the cup while filling. 

II. By teaspoonfuls or tablespoonfuls. 

Dip spoon in ingredient, fill, lift, and level with a 
case knife having the sharp edge of knife towards 
tip of spoon. Divide with a case knife lengthwise 
of spoon for a half spoonful. Divide halves cross- 
wise for quarters, and quarters crosswise for eighths. 
Less than one-eighth teaspoonful is called a few 
grains. 

TO MEASURE BUTTER, LARD, AND OTHER 
SOLID FATS 

I. By cupfuls. 

Pack solidly into cup and level with a case knife for 
a cupful. For fractions of cupfuls pack in like man- 
ner to correct division line indicated in cup.

HOW TO MEASURE INGREDIENTS 3 

II. By teaspoonfuls or tablespoonfuls. 

Pack solidly into spoon and level with a case knife. 
Divide with a case knife lengthwise of spoon for a 
half spoonful. Divide halves crosswise for quarters, 
and quarters crosswise for eighths. 

TO MEASURE LIQUIDS 

I. By cwpfuls. 

Pour liquid to be measured into cup and fill to very 
top for cupfuls. A cupful of liquid is all that the cup 
will hold and cannot be easily moved from one place 
to another without overflowing. For fractions 
of cupfuls fill in like manner to correct division line 
indicated in cup. 

II. By teaspoonfuls or tablespoonfuls. 

Dip spoon in liquid, fill and lift, taking up all the 
spoon will hold. When dry ingredients, liquids, 
and fats are all called for in the same recipe, measure 
in the order given, thereby using but one cup. 

HOW TO COMBINE INGREDIENTS 

Next to measuring comes care in combining, — 
a fact not always recognized by the inexperienced. 
Three ways are considered, — stirring, beating, 
and cutting and folding. 

To stir, mix by using circular motion, widening 
the circles until all is blended. Stirring is the motion 
ordinarily employed in all cookery, alone or in com- 
bination with beating. 



4 A NEW BOOK OF COOKERY 

To heat, turn ingredient or ingredients over and 
over, continually bringing the under part to the sur- 
face, thus allowing the utensil used for beating to be 
constantly brought in contact with bottom of the 
dish and throughout the mixture. 

To cut and fold, introduce one ingredient into an- 
other ingredient or mixture by two motions : with a 
spoon, a repeated vertical downward motion, known 
as cutting, and a turning over and over of mixture, 
allowing bowl of spoon each time to come in contact 
with bottom of dish, is called folding. These re- 
peated motions are alternated until thorough blend- 
ing is accomplished. 

By stirring, ingredients are mixed; hy heating, 
a large amount of air is inclosed; hy cutting and 
folding, air already introduced is prevented from 
escaping.

CAKE 343 

AniUTersary Cake 

Bake Grandmother's Pound Cake mixture in a 
buttered and floured round pan about seven inches 
in diameter. Remove from pan, cover with Con- 
fectioners' Frosting and decorate as shown in illus- 
tration or as one's fancy dictates. 

Foliage is best made of citron thinly sliced. The 
dark-green outside makes attractive leaves, though 
all may be used to advantage. The little candies for 
the flowers may sometimes be procm-ed at small 
shops, though the greatest variety can be bought of 
a dealer in confectioners' supplies; also the little 
silver-like dragees, which are so ornamental. The 
flowers are made on a basis of angelica, cut with a 
pen-knife into thin shavings, worked with the hands 
into small balls, then flattened into lozenge shapes, 
which make a sticky foundation on which the candies 
may be placed; candied rose leaves and violets 
may also be used. The cake in the illustration is 
decorated with daisies and chrysanthemums, golden- 
rod and forget-me-nots. 

The little disks were made of angelica, shaped in 
half-spheres, dipped in white of egg, and then in the 
dragees, and the conventional decorations were cut 
from thin slices of citron.

heavy brown paper (buttered side up) and fasten 
securely with a string. Steam and bake. Take 
from pan, remove paper, and let stand until cold. 
Wrap in cheese-cloth, wrung out of brandy, and 
store in a cool dry place from one to three months, 
occasionally sprinkling with brandy. Work one- 
third pound almond paste with white of one egg 
until smooth and add one-fourth cup fine granulated 
sugar. Spread bottom and sides of cake with mix- 
ture, put in oven and bake until paste is browned. 
This prevents frosting from becoming discolored. 
Cool and spread with a layer of Ornamental Frost- 
ing (see p. 353) and let stand until frosting is set. 

Ornament by forcing frosting through a pastry 
bag and tubes or cones made of paper which comes 
for this purpose and dragees. The doves shown in 
illustration are shaped on paper, dried and then 
placed on cake, being held in place by a small quan- 
tity of soft frosting.

Have you ever made Ivory Soap Paste? 

HERE are many . purposes for which it is unequaled and it is 
the most economical and convenient way to use Ivory Soap for 
general cleaning and laundry work. 

With Ivory Soap Paste you can clean leather and other materials which . should not be 
touched by soap suds. And it is much more effective than bar sc/ap for such things as furni- 
ture, marble and porcelain bathroom fixtures, metal ware, woodwork, gilt frames and rues. 

The advantages of using the paste where the cake might answer the purpose are: The paste 
makes rich thick suds that cleanse thoroughly. It makes suds quickly, saving time. The 
suds can be made with lukewarm as well as hot water where heat would injure the article to 
be cleaned. And the paste goes farther than bar soap. 

You will find the recipe for making Ivory Soap paste on the inside of the 
wrapper and also in the booklet^" Unusual Uses of Ivory Soap**. This 
booklet contains over 100 tested recipes for the safe cleaning of just the 
things that ordinarily cause the moat trouble. You may have a copy post- 
paid by return mail if you will send your name and address to The Procter ifc 
Gamble Co.. Dept. BC, Cincinnati, O.
