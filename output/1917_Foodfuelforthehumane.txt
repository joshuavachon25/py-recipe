FOOD 

Section I — Kinds of Food 

The body needs fuel, just as an engine needs fuel. 

An engine must have the right kind and the right 
amount of fuel, or it can not work well. And the human 
body also must have the right kind and amount of food 
or it can not work well. 

The human body is doing some work all the time, even 
in sleep, in sickness, and when resting. Heart, muscles 
and lungs are always "on the job." 

An engine has to be built and repaired, to be stoked, 
to be oiled and regulated. It is the same with the human 
body : We need 

A. FUEL FOOD 

B. BUILDING or REPAIR FOOD 

C. REGULATING FOOD 

A. Fuel Foods 

A worker at a desk or at a machine where he does no 
hard labor requires only about half the fuel that is nec- 
essary for a very hard-working man, a woodsawyer for 
example. A farmer needs about one-third more fuel 
than the average desk-worker. The average woman tak- 
ing little exercise needs about one-third less fuel than 
the average man who has more muscular tissue and is 



FOOD— FUEL FOR THE HUMAN ENGINE 



more active. Gmfdrec rxed a lot of fuel as they burn 
it quickly. A girl fourteen to seventeen years of age 
will need as much or more than a full-grown woman, 
and a boy of the same age more than a full-grown busi- 
ness man. So people vary in their fuel needs just as 
different types of automobiles vary in the amount of 
gasoline they need. 

The following list shows the main fuel foods. These 
are the great foundation foods of the diet, the foods that 
supply energy for muscular work. Mental work requires 
so little extra fuel that it is not necessary to consider it 
specially. 

There are three groups of fuel foods. 

Here they are in order of cost per calory, i.e., those 
giving most energy for the money heading the list. 



1. Starchy Foods 


2. Sugars 


3. Fats 


Cornmeal 


Sugar 


Drippings

Milk 


Spaghetti 




Bacon 


Cornstarch

Dried lima beans 




Cream 


Split peas, yellow 






Dried navy beans 






Bread 






Potatoes 






Bananas 







FOOD 7 

About 85 per cent, of the fuel (calories, see Section 2) 
should come from this group, using starchy foods in 
largest amounts, fats next and sugars least. 

Fats, starchy foods and sugars are almost pure fuel, 
like coal, while cereal foods also contain some building 
and regulating material. 

B. Building and Repair Foods 

The body is continually rebuilding worn parts, 
and needs several kinds of food for this purpose. In 
general, building foods fall into two classes, called "Pro- 
teins" and "Mineral Salts." 

1. Protein Food or "Body Bricks." Proteins may be 
compared to building bricks and are represented in the 
diet by lean meat of all sorts (including fish, shell food 
and fowl), milk, cheese, eggs, dried peas and beans, len- 
tils and nuts. 

There is also a fair amount of protein in cereals 
and bread (about 10 per cent.), which are both building 
and fuel foods. Eggs and flesh foods need to be limited 
in quantity because too much of them may make 
trouble for the human machine, leaving in the body, 
when burned (digested), wastes that may be likened to 
"clinkers" in the furnace. 

Most foods contain some protein, but those here 
mentioned are richest in protein, and hence are termed 
building or repair foods. 

Protein foods for building and repair in order of their 
cost, those giving most building and repair value for 
the money heading the list. 



8 FOOD— FUEL FOR THE HUMAN ENGINE 

Beans (dried white) Peanuts 

Dried Peas Macaroni 

Oatmeal Mutton, Leg 

Cornmeal Beef, Lean rump 

Beans, dried lima Milk (9c. a quart) 

Bread Beef, Lean round 

Bread, whole wheat Lamb, Leg 

Bread, Graham Eggs (24c. a dozen) 

Salt cod Halibut 

Milk, skimmed (6c. a Porterhouse steak 

quart) Eggs (36c. a dozen) 

Cheese (American) Almonds, shelled 

The very high protein or repair foods (meat, fish, 
eggs, and fowl) should be eaten once a day. The rest 
of the repair material needed will be found in sufficient 
quantity in the balance of the diet. Muscular labor, 
which increases the need for fuel (calories) does not 
materially increase the need for bricks* or proteins. It 
is a mistake to think that eating meat gives special 
strength for work. Starchy foods, fat and sugar, are 
the great sources of working force. To burn meat for 
fuel is like burning mahogany or rosewood for kindling 
wood, or burning wood that is full of bolts and nails, 
or covered with mortar. 

2. Mineral salts. The second kind of building ma- 
terial includes a variety of minerals which help to make 
bones, blood and other body parts. They are found 
chiefly in milk, cereal foods (when made from whole 
grains), fruits and vegetables. Of these minerals, lime, 
iron and phosphorus are especially needed to keep the 



FOOD 9 

body in healthy condition. In a diet that daily includes 
milk, green vegetables, fruit, and cereals made from 
whole grains (oatmeal, flaked wheat, wheatena, etc.) 
there is little danger of mineral starvation. Where the 
diet is very limited, with white flour, fats and sugar 
forming the chief foods, there is such danger. A pint 
of milk a day is the best insurance against lime and 
phosphorus lack. Cereals, fruits and green vegetables 
will furnish iron, and may be supplemented by eggs 
(especially yolks) and meat for this purpose. 

Regulating Foods 

1. Mineral salts. These serve two purposes in the 
body. They are building foods, as stated above, and 
also help to keep the body machinery running properly. 

2. Water. Water is one of the most important of 
regulating foods. Most people drink too little. A glass 
in the morning on arising, one before each meal, and 
another on going to bed, or, a glass at each meal, and 
one between meals, are good rules. Water at meals is 
beneficial except for persons who are too fat. They 
should avoid much water at meals and drink some be- 
tween meals. 

3. Ballast or bulk. A diet which contains no vegetable 
fiber is insufficient expect for babies. This fiber is found 
in graham or whole wheat bread, leaves and skins of 
plants and skins of fruit. Examples are: Vegetables — 
Lettuce, parsnips, carrots, turnips, celery, oyster plant, 
cabbage, Brussels sprouts, tomatoes, salsify, Spanish 



10 FOOD—FUEL FOR THE HUMAN ENGINE 

onions, spinach. Fruit — apples (baked or raw), pears, 
currants, raspberries, cranberries, prunes, dates, figs. 
This ballast or bulk counteracts constipation and gives 
adequate work to teeth, jaws, stomach and bowels. These 
organs will degenerate if allowed to "loaf." 

4. Hard foods. The bulky foods just mentioned assist 
in inducing proper chewing of foods, but proper chewing 
and vigorous use of the teeth and jaws is further secured 
by including in the diet hard foods such as crusts, hard 
crackers, toast, zweiback, fibrous vegetables and fruits, 
like celery and nuts. Chewing hard foods means more 
health and less dentist's bills. 

5. Accessories or Vitamins. There are minute sub* 
stances (vatamins and lipoids) present in very small quan- 
tities in a number of foods and apparently absolutely neces- 
sary to health, but not found in all kinds of food material. 
This is one more reason for variety in the diet. Milk, eggs, 
whole wheat, corn, oatmeal, potatoes and oranges are 
some of the foods known to contain them. The skins or 
hulls of cereals are also good for this reason, and fresh 
meat, fresh peas and beans. Cooking reduces the amount 
of vitamins in most foods. Hence, as a matter of 
safety, orange juice should be given to children when 
pasteurized milk is the chief food. Adults would do well 
to eat some raw food and fresh fruit daily. It seems 
necessary to include the leaves of plants (green vege- 
tables) when the seeds of plants (cereal, grains, flour) 
are used as food if the diet is to be complete and well 
balanced. 



FOOD II 

Section II — Feeding the Human Furnace 

Suppose we have all these kinds of food in the pantry 
and the coal to cook them. Are we safe? 

By no means. 

We may not serve these foods in the right propor- 
tion ; for example : Too much or too little fuel food, too 
little regulating food, or too much building or repair 
food. Perhaps the food may be eaten in the wrong 
way or under unfavorable conditions. 

Let us suppose that we have the right kind of food, 
properly cooked. How are we to get it into the human 
furnace so that we shall secure the full value of it without 
clinkers or without undue waste or injury to the engine 
and the machinery? 

You may say "Just swallow it." Many do this and 
suffer injury. They put food into the stomach as you 
would pack a trunk, or fill a pail. Many foods (bread 
cereals, cake, potatoes, and the like) are partly digested 
in the mouth, and all foods are prepared in the mouth 
for reception into the stomach. Many foods 
(meat, fish, eggs, chicken, parts of cereals, bread 
and other foods) are partly digested in the stomach 
and prepared for further digestion in the bowels. From 
the bowels the various classes of foods are conveyed 
where they are needed for work (fuel), for building or 
repair, and for regulating the blood and organs. Mouth, 
stomach and bowels must do team work if your body 
is to be properly nourished. 

THEREFORE: You must chew your food thor- 
oughly until it naturally slides down the gullet. Don't 



12 FOOD— FUEL FOR THE HUMAN ENGINE 

count your chews or think of your chews, but 
"TASTE" your food thoroughly. You will be sur- 
prized at the extra flavor and enjoyment and you will 
not eat so much. Eating keeps you alive. It is worth 
doing well. 

Be cheerful. Do not worry about your food, or any- 
thing else. Bring no grouch to the dinner table. Eat 
regularly, even though not hungry. If not hungry, eat 
little. As the hour for meals approaches, the thought 
of food makes the juice in the mouth flow. Your mouth 
waters. As you chew your food, and taste it thor- 
oughly, the juice of the stomach flows and good diges- 
tion is assured. Your stomach stops working when 
you are angry, worried or unduly excited. A little rest 
before and after meals is good. 

Let mealtime be a time of good cheer. It is no time 
to discuss troubles. 

Don't unload all the worries of the day at the dinner 
table. Talk them over when the body and mind are 
rested and digestion has well started, and you will find 
your way out of trouble much more easily. 

The story of diet and good feeding is very simple. 
Approach it as you would any other simple story. Do 
not think that because it concerns the body it is neces- 
sarily mysterious, a complex scientific matter that only 
experts can understand. Read the story of the diet 
squad and feed the family in an understanding way 
instead of by a hit-or-miss method that a farmer would 
scorn to use in feeding hogs or horses.

SUMMARY 

Is it necessary to know how many calories you are get- 
ting each day, or how many ounces of protein ? By no 
means. 

The following rules will make it possible for you to 
feed yourself and your family without weighing your 
food or counting your calories. 

Weigh yourself twice a month. If you are above the 
average weight you need less fuel. If you are very light 
in weight and losing weight, you need more fuel. 

Try to have some bulky food, some raw food, some 
whole cereal, some fruit and some milk in your diet each 
day. 

Eat high protein foods (meat, fish, fowl, eggs only 
once a day in moderate amount. Have one or two meat- 
less days a week. 

Section III — Advice for Special Types of People 

You who are overweight remember that you are car- 
rying a burden that may break down your health. You 
should eat less of fats, starchy foods, and sugars, and 
you should avoid alcoholic drinks. Eat more fruit and 
vegetables, especially cabbage, lettuce, celery, spinach, 
string beans, cucumbers, carrots, tomatoes, turnips and 
sea kale. Exercise daily. 

You who are pale and thin, and losing weight, eat 
freely of all the foods in the menus and watch your 
weight and your color. Do deep breathing and setting- 
up exercises. Try to get more fresh fruit, vegetables 
and egg yolks if possible. 



14 



FOOD— FUEL FOR THE HUMAN ENGINE 



You who are constipated — Eat freely of whole 
cereals, bran-bread, bran-biscuits, lemon juice, and orange 
juice, cabbage, and other bulky vegetables. Strictly avoid 
mineral water, pills, laxatives. Use mineral oil if neces- 
sary, one or two ounces at night. Exercise, use water be- 
tween meals freely, and have regular times for bowel 
movement. If such natural methods are not sufficient 
consult a doctor. 

You who work at desks — Eat lightly of the starches, 
fats and sugars, and try to get plenty of fruit, green 
vegetables and milk. 

You who are doing heavy work — Eat freely. Watch 
your weight. Eat enough to keep your weight at the 
average for age thirty. Do not put on great layers of 
flesh. Fat is not good for a prizefighter ; it is not good 
for you. All men should be "in training" all the time ; 
always "fit"; good muscles; no pads of useless, bur- 
densome fat. Cut down on the bread and butter, 
sugar, puddings, and cereals if you find yourself climb- 
ing up the scale. Potatoes do not matter. They are 
75 per cent, water but valuable food, and you are not 
likely to eat enough of them to count heavily. 

You who are moderately active, not at hard labor 
but still moving about and not at a desk or machine 
all the time, eat moderately and include some fresh 
fruit and green vegetables in your diet. 

You who think this is all nonsense — go to the census 
records, and you will find that one-half of the people 
died before sixty years of age, many of them because 
they did not know how to feed their bodies.

Lightweight is not a disadvantage if one is other- 
wise in good health, especially after age 30. 

Overweight is always a disadvantage and should be 
avoided, especially by those approaching middle life. 
Keep your weight about the average figure for age 30, 
and do not let it creep up as you become older. 

The death-rate among those 50 to 80 lbs. overweight 
at middle life, is nearly double that of those slightly 
underweight at that age. Some allowance must be 
made for type, a heavy-framed individual carrying 
naturally more weight than one slender and light- 
framed.

16 FOOD— FUEL FOR THE HUMAN ENGINE 

OVERWEIGHT AND THE DEATH-RATE 

The fact that the man of average weight is, after age 
forty, actually overweight and that the average individ- 
ual at that age is above the best weight is shown by 
life insurance experience. For example, a man of five 
feet seven inches to five feet ten inches in height, age 
forty-five to forty-nine, ten pounds underweight, would 
have a 4 per cent, lower mortality than the man of 
exactly average weight for that age and height. 

Overweights at that age and height show the follow- 
ing extra mortality as compared to those ten pounds 
under the average weight :

This shows that the burden of extra mortality 
borne by the heavy-weight regularly increases with 
gain in weight. At the same age and height fifty 
pounds underweight shows a death-rate equal to the 
actual death-rate among insured lives generally and 
only 6 per cent, in excess of the death-rate among 
those of average weight. Thirty-five pounds under-

those of average weight.

It must be remembered that these figures are taken 
from life insurance sources- where the individuals have 
been subjected to careful medical examination. This 
shows that no matter how careful the medical examina- 
tion, it has been impossible to select a favorable class of 
mature overweights while it has been possible to select 
a relatively favorable class of mature underweights. It 
should also be remembered that these figures relate to 
underweight and overweight entirely apart from other 
adverse factors. That is, these groups presented no other 
departure from the normal than their variation in weight. 

The following is a simple dietary for an overweight 
who has no serious organic disease : 



18 FOOD— FUEL FOR THE HUMAN ENGINE 

Breakfast : Apple, small orange* or y 2 grapefruit ; one or 
two eggs; thin toast, dry or very lightly buttered, 
coffee, with hot milk instead of cream ; not more than 
one lump sugar. 

Luncheon: Vegetable soup (no cream soups) ; rye bread, 
bran bread or bran biscuit, or Graham rolls — thinly 
buttered (one small pat only) ; lettuce and cheese 
salad, or lettuce and tomato, or fruit salad; French 
dressing. 

Dinner: Moderate helping of any roast of lean meat or 
non-fat poultry or fish ; baked or boiled potato ; any 
bulky vegetable (as lettuce, Swiss chard, parsnips, 
carrots, turnips, celery, oyster plant, cabbage, Brus- 
sels sprouts, tomatoes, salsify, Spanish onions, spin- 
ach) ; coffee,; fruit dessert — grapefruit cocktail, 
oranges, or stewed fruits. 

Beware of alcohol, especially beer; also candy between 
meals, and pastry. Pie, French pastry and sweet desserts 
often furnish as many calories as the balance of the meal 
{pie, 300 to 400). 

A cup of bouillon and a cracker may be taken at 1 1 a.m. ; 
tea, with lemon and a little sugar at 5 p.m., and a glass 
of skimmed milk on retiring, if the need of food is felt. 

The more rapid digestion and absorption of such a 
dietary, owing to the small amount of fat, may account 
for the feeling of "goneness" that some people complain 
of when following it; hence, the value of forenoon and 
afternoon "snacks." 

Such a diet can be held down to 15,000 calories or less 
and thus force the average individual to contribute 1,000 



FOOD 19 

calories daily from his own fat. A fairly liberal indul- 
gence in such a diet will keep the calories below 1,800 and 
with even a moderate amount of exercise some weight 
will gradually be lost each day. 

Avoid starvation diet and fasting, except for diseased 
conditions, such as diabetes, when such measures should 
be taken under medical supervision. A starvation diet 
robs the tissues of building and repair material. It is not 
such material that should be reduced, but the fatty tissues. 

Section IV — Feeding the Children 

It is especially important at the present time to 
guard our children against insufficient nourishment. 
The trend toward simple diet and household economies 
must not go to the extreme of restricting the diet of 
growing boys and girls. The tissues of the ichild are 
undergoing rapid changes and there is a high expendi- 
ture of energy, hence the fuel requirement of the child 
is greater in proportion to weight than that of the 
adult. 

The average adult beyond thirty or thirty-five re- 
quires food restriction and will benefit by it, but the 
growing child should be allowed to eat pretty freely, 
simply guiding the consumption of food along proper 
lines. 

The following table prepared from various sources 
by the New York Association for Improving the Con- 
dition of the Poor shows the food requirement of 
children :

From 16 to 17 2,700-3,400 2,250-2,550 

Note that the food requirement of a boy of sixteen 
may exceed by one-third that of an ordinary sedentary 
business man, which is about 2,500 calories. Children 
need plenty of fuel food, cereals, bread and butter, 
milk, .cheese, eggs in moderation, but not a large 
amount of meat, certainly not more than once daily. 
The type of child must be considered, but on the whole 
the child's demands should be met as regards quantity 
and care taken that the diet does not become "finicky" 
or too narrow. 

Fruit and green vegetables and a quart of milk 
daily should be insisted upon, and it is seldom that any 
undue gain in weight will be noticed. Such tendencies 
do not usually need watching until after thirty.

THE "ROOKIE" DIET SQUAD 

Section I— How and Why the "Rookies" Were Fed 

These twelve young men were volunteers from the 
Training School of the New York City Police Depart- 
ment who pledged themselves to eat nothing during 
the three-weeks' period of the test except the food 
served in the temporary diet kitchen established by the 
Life Extension Institute in one of the City Buildings 
at 49 Lafayette Street.

THE "ROOKIE" DIET SQUAD 23 

The average blood pressure at the start was 129 ; at 
the close, 124, which is exactly normal for the age. 
The average height was 5' 9". 

They were, therefore, about 15 lbs. above the aver- 
age weight of 154 lbs., the standard usually adopted in 
dietetic .studies as the weight of the average man, and 
their food requirement was accordingly proportion- 
ately greater, and was estimated as 3,500 * calories 
per man per day. This, of course, is an average, as 
the requirements were between 3,000 and 3,800 calories 
according to the weight and physique. 

At the close of the experiment the group had gained 
29 lbs. in weight. Altho moderate gains in weight 
are not uncommon when the diet is changed, unless it 
is markedly insufficient, the gain of 29 lbs. in these 
young men may be taken as good evidence that they 
maintained their physical condition on the food eaten, 
while still continuing their gymnasium work, which 
occupied about two and one-half hours daily, the rest 
of the day being passed chiefly in the class-room. In 
fact, their strenuous exercise — Boxing, wrestling jiu- 

* The calory is a unit of heat or energy measurement, just as an 
inch is a unit of length measurement, or a pound a unit of weight, 
and represents the amount of heat required to raise one pound of 
water 4 degrees Fahrenheit. 

During rest there is required about % to % of a calory per hour 
per pound of body weight (assuming that a person is well propor- 
tioned and not fat). During exercise the requirement varies from 
1 to 3 calories per hour per pound of body weight, according to the 
activity. The heavier the work the larger the number of calories 
required until the amount needed per day per man reaches 5,000 to 
6,000 in those working all day at very hard muscular labor. This 
has been determined by actual experiment with people engaged at 
their work in a respiration calorimeter or specially devised room in 
which their heat consumption can be measured.

jitsu, etc. — was increased during the last week of the 
test. 

At the close of the experiment the men* were com- 
pletely re-examined and their condition was found to 
be improved, and there was no evidence of any ill 
effects from" the change in their diet. 

In spite of the cheapness of the diet, which was kept 
within the limit of 25 cents for the estimated food re- 
quirement (3,500 calories), the men were benefited by 
the change from the more irregular and less well- 
balanced diet that most of them had been following, in 
which meat and eggs figured very largely. 

It is true that in spite of certain precautions some 
of the men, although already somewhat overweight, 
exceeded the food requirement and gained weight, but 
that does not alter the fact that the maintenance diet 
was kept within the cost of 25 cents per man a day. 

A working man of average weight (154 lbs.) and a 
fuel requirement of 3,000 calories could live on this 
diet at a cost of about 21 cents per day. 

Only one meat meal a day was served in the diet 
kitchen and on several days no meat was served. The 
men entered seriously into the spirit of the experiment 
and showed intelligent cooperation. They exprest 
themselves as desirous of continuing the general 
dietetic habits formed. 

As Commissioner Woods has so clearly stated, the 
test was not undertaken with a view to prove that 25 
cents a day is the proper amount to spend, but in 
order to show that it is possible for a man to be healthy 
and active on a small sum if wisely spent. 



THE "ROOKIE" DIET SQUAD 25 

It was also desired to ascertain the actual relation- 
ship of present market prices to foods absolutely re- 
quired to nourish the average person. The result of 
the experiment is a clear demonstration of the fact 
that one must have some knowledge of food value, 
far more knowledge than the average housewife pos- 
sesses, in order to secure the necessary foods in the 
right combination to nourish an average man. 

Millions of people Have no more than that to spend 
for food and it is of extreme importance that the sim- 
ple knowledge necessary to guide them safely should 
be carried to them. Others who are spending far more 
than that are not living well, and may be actually 
under-nourished, while others are over-nourished. To 
convey clear knowledge and instruction on these mat- 
ters vital to the health and progress of the nation was 
the central purpose of the experiment. 

Requirements of the Diet Squad 

The fuel requirements of these men ranged from 
3,000 to 3,800 calories per day, some of them being 
considerably over average weight, and all doing active 
muscular work. Over-eating was prevented as far as 
possible by serving half portions at the beginning of 
the meal, and the rest in a second serving which was 
usually requested. The meals were well-balanced and 
contained an adequate, amount of protein (about 10 per 
cent, of the calories) and sufficient mineral salts and 
food accessories. 

With more money to spend the diet could have been 
brought closer to the ideal by using more fresh fruit 



26 FOOD— FUEL FOR THE HUMAN ENGINE 

and green vegetables, such as Brussels sprouts, cab- 
bage, spinach and lettuce, to give variety, attractive- 
ness, and flavor to the meals, as well as insure an 
abundance of the accessory food elements and of bal- 
last or fibrous matter to prevent constipation and 
maintain intestinal activity. As a matter of fact, the 
menus probably contained more ballast than the men 
had been accustomed to in view of the whole cereals 
used so freely (oatmeal and graham bread), and the 
peas, beans, carrots, turnips, and stewed dried fruits. 
The men had been in the habit of eating freely of meat, 
which has no ballast. Some of them were relieved of 
constipation by the diet. Others showed improved 
blood pressure, probably due to reduction of meat. 
Remember, that with more money to spend, milk, 
vegetables, fruit and eggs should be bought and not 
meat or sweets. 

Lightweight people would benefit by the general 
character of the diet, adding milk, if possible, eggs and 
plenty of butter or butter substitutes. Those over- 
weight would benefit by eating less of the starchy 
and sugary foods, cutting down cereals, bread and 
butter ; omitting sugar, and using more fruit and coarse 
fibered vegetables ; omitting puddings and substituting 
fruit desserts for them; cutting down on butter. 

The diet could also be lowered in cost by eliminating 
tea and coffee, which are not necessary, and may be 
questioned from the standpoint of health and hygiene. 
They were admitted to the dietary in order not to 
make too radical a change in the men's habits and im- 
pair the practical value of the experiment. Any money 



THE "ROOKIE" DIET SQUAD 27 

so saved should be spent for milk, fruit or vegetables. 
These dietaries are not appropriate, as already stated, 
for young children, who should have a large amount 
of milk, at least one quart daily, and more eggs, fruit 
and green vegetables, if possible, although not more 
meat. 

The Scientific Control of the Test 

The thanks of the public and of the Institute are due 
to Police Commissioner Arthur Woods, for his public- 
spirited interest and cooperation in making the test 
a success; to Prof. Mary Swartz Rose, of Teach- 
ers College, Columbia .University, and her able as- 
sistants, Miss Mary G. McCormick and Miss Marian 
F. Walker, who admirably covered the technical work 
involved in the test, and in the preparation of this 
booklet. The test was under the general supervision 
of the Medical Director of the Institute, Dr. Fisk, in 
consultation with Prof. Irving Fisher, and other mem- 
bers of the Hygiene Reference Board. 

A technical paper will be issued later giving the 
complete scientific data for use of students and teach- 
ers. 

Section II— Menus Served to the "Rookie" Diet Squad 
How to Use the Menus 

The menus herein given are not suitable, as they 
stand, for all classes of people. 

They form a wholesome diet, however, for the average 
active individual. For sedentary people they should be

modified and taken in small quantities. This can be done 
either by spending less or decreasing the amount of fuel 
food used and including more fruit and green vege- 
tables. 

More eggs and milk are needed for children, and if 
possible, more fruit and green vegetables, but for them 
the fuel food must be kept high. The special menus for 
children are given for one week, as an example. 

Tea and coffee were included as concessions to 
former habits of those who volunteered to take the diet 
experiment, but are not advised as regular indulgences.

HOME ECONOMIES 

Section I — Heat and Cold 

Two things greatly needed in the home are heat and 
cold, and both are to some extent expensive. The ex- 
pense of both heat and cold, that is, coal and ice, can 
be reduced materially by simple devices. 

The Fireless Cooker 

Many have been deterred from using the fireless 
cooker because of the initial expense of the investment, 
moderate as it is. But homemade fireless cookers can 
be constructed at a trivial expenditure. The Depart- 
ment of Agriculture has issued circulars describing 
the device (Farmer's Bulletin 771), but it may briefly 
be summed up as an ordinary galvanized iron pail 
placed inside of another iron pail which rests on a 
soapstone or other heating device, surrounded in a 
wooden box by about four inches of packing, waste- 
paper, newspaper, hay, or other nonconducting ma- 
terial. Smaller pails or utensils, double-boiler, etc., 
can be placed inside the larger pail if a small quantity

of food is to be heated. A cushion or excelsior pad 
should be placed over the cover of the pail and under 
the lid of the box. 

The fireless cooker is especially serviceable in cook-

ing cereals. There is absolutely no advantage in buying 
package cereals. Whole bulk cereals should be bought 
and thoroughly cooked. For example, oatmeal, should 
be cooked in a double-boiler for six hours or directly 
over the fire for two hours. By the use of a fireless 
cooker oatmeal can thus be properly cooked overnight. 
Meats may be partially roasted in the oven and 
finished in the cooker. This improves the flavor and

texture of the cheaper cuts. Other foods best adapted 
to the cooker are soup, vegetables, dried fruits, steamed 
bread and puddings. Foods cooked together in the 
cooker must, of course, require the same amount of 
cooking, as it can not be opened without loss of heat. 

The Iceless Refrigerator 

A refrigerator, without the use of ice, can be con- 
structed by enveloping a screened set of shelves in a

and kept moistened by wicks of the same material 
placed in a pan of water on top of the box, moisture 
from the pan being allowed to drip on the sides of the 
box and keep the enveloping flannel moistened. The 



FOOD ECONOMIES 71 

evaporation of this moisture will in fairly dry climate 
maintain a temperature of 50 degrees in the ice-box and 
make the use of ice unnecessary, or help to preserve ice 
that may be used. Keep in a shady place, where the air 
circulates freely. 

Section II — Choosing Foods 

Certain types of foods that may become scarce and 
are greatly needed by our Allies are flour, cereals and 
grains, etc. While these are the cheapest foods for 
energy and, when the income is limited, should form 
the main basis of the diet, the average individual should 
endeavor to secure as much nutriment as possible from 
green vegetables and fruit and limit his use of bread 
and cereals, because of the better keeping qualities of 
grains and flours. 

The best way to preserve vegetables and fruit is to 
eat them. Those that can not be immediately consumed 
for family use may be canned, or dried by the new 
dehydrating processes. (Write for Home Canning In- 
struction, 21, U. S. Dept. of Agriculture. Instruction 
for Dehydrating Vegetables, Geo. E. Farrell Dept. of 
Agriculture, or National Emergency Food Garden Com- 
mission, 1410 H Street, N. W., Washington, D. C.) 

It should always be remembered, however, that fruit 
and green vegetables are low in fuel value and your 



72 



FOOD— FUEL FOR THE HUMAN ENGINE 



body weight should be watched so that you may be 
sure that a sufficient amount of food is secured to main- 
tain the weight at the most favorable point, which is 
about the average weight at age thirty. 

Those in moderate circumstances or well-to-do 
should secure as much nutriment from perishable food 
as possible. 

One of the most important elements in the diet is 
milk, especially for cooking purposes. Good observers 
Jiave noted that the absence of milk in the diet is very 
keenly felt. Food lacks a satisfying flavor if milk is 
eliminated from the kitchen. Milk could be used more 
effectively than is now the case, if people would bear 
in mind the uses of skimmed milk, which is more 
economical and more satisfactory for certain purposes 
than whole milk. There is advantage in securing the 
cream from whole milk which may be needed for the 
table instead of buying it separately. Use the skimmed 
milk that remains for cooking vegetables or other 
special cooking purposes. 

By cooking vegetables in skimmed milk and serving 
them in the liquor you not only secure all the vegetable 
juices and the valuable food elements in the vegetables, 
their bulk, their fiber, their minerals and accessories, 
but also the protein or building food in the skimmed 
milk which supplements the lack of protein in the 



FOOD ECONOMIES 73 

vegetables. There is a certain prejudice against skim- 
med milk, which should be removed. It is true that it 
is not a complete food for children. It has many uses, 
however, which should not be disregarded, especially 
in supplying protein or building and repair food. 

Do not waste even half a cupful of milk. Have a 
receptacle for odd lots of milk and use it in cooking 
or for souring and cheese-making. Cottage cheese has 
quite a high value in protein or tissue-building food 
and is much cheaper than meat, for which it may be 
substituted in the diet. 

Butter should never be used in cooking and it might 
well be omitted from the table and butter substitutes 
used which are wholesome and nutritious foods, such 
as Oleomargarine, Nutmargarine, or nut butter made 
of cocoanut oil and peanut oil, churned up with a cer- 
tain amount of milk. These cost about one-third less 
than butter. Do not confuse peanut butter with these 
butter substitutes. Peanut butter is miscalled. It is 
not a true butter, but simply mashed peanuts and is 
very high in protein or building material as well as fat. 
It is a healthful and nourishing food, but should be 
used as such and not simply as a fat. For example, 
peanut-butter sandwiches may take the place of meat 
sandwiches. To use peanut butter as a butter in the 
same meal where meat, peas or beans or other high 



74 FOOD— FUEL FOR THE HUMAN ENGINE 

protein food is used overloads the meal with protein and 
if used at each meal in place of butter, there would sure- 
ly be an excess of protein. 

Fish and Poultry 

The value of fish and poultry as substitutes for meat 
should not be forgotten. The sea is always with us 
and its limitless supply of fish. The fish crop is not as 
variable as the wheat crop and not subject to such 
changes as the live-stock market. We need to keep all 
the milch cows possible and to avoid the killing of young 
live stock so far as possible. We can lessen the call 
on live stock by turning to fish and to some extent 
to poultry. 

Remember that one high-protein meal a day is all 
that we need. That is, one meal at which fish, meat, 
poultry or eggs are eaten, and that we can do without 
all of these foods, if necessary, using cheese, peas, and 
beans, or nuts, as substitutes. A meatless day a week, 
on which day the main feature of the principal meal 
is a dish of creamed macaroni and cheese, will do 
nobody any harm. England abandoned the meatless 
day a week because it resulted in an excessive call on 
bread and butter and flour products, but it should be 
possible to establish it here without such risk. A wheat- 
less day a week would act as a safeguard and is urged by 
Mr. Hoover. 



FOOD ECONOMIES 75 

Saving Wheat 

In order to save wheat, the most needed food for 
our Allies, as much use as possible should be made of 
cornmeal, barley and rice. It is important to secure 
whole cornmeal if possible, especially if it is to be 
mixed with patent white flour in bread-making. Secure 
whole wheat flour if possible and mix with it 10 per 
cent, of barley flour or cornmeal. Use whole cornmeal 
for Johnny-cake and eat it as a war-bread. You can 
grind your own cornmeal at home with a coffee-grinder, 
or in small mills which can be had for $2.50 upward. 

It is not likely that rice will be used by anybody so 
continuously or exclusively as to result in faulty nutri- 
tion due to its lack of accessory food elements, but if 
used very much as a cereal or substitute for grain and 
potatoes, there is need for fruit and green vegetables 
or fresh milk, fresh peas, beans, eggs, other whole 
cereals or fresh meat. 

When the diet is very simple and narrow look out 
for food deficiencies! Use* complete unsterilized foods, 
whole cereals, and a certain amount of raw food every 
day.
