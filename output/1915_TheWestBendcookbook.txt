PREFACE. 



RECIPES, like friends, must be tested before their worth 
is proved, and since "the proof of the pudding is the 
eating," the compilers of this little volume take pleasure in 
assuring their readers that the toothsome dishes herein 
described will bear that test. The descendants of the noble 
pioneer women of our state are worthy successors to their 
mothers and grandmothers in the art of domestic cookery, and 
it is to their generous co-operation that we are indebted for 
the choice recipes contained within these pages. German, 
American and French have given liberally of their store so 
that our West Bend Cook Book will be found to embrace a 
great variety. We do not claim that this little work is com- 
prehensive in detail, for much has been omitted which is to 
be found in the ordinary cook book, but we have aimed to 
gather together some of the choicest recipes of our German- 
American and French-American cousins whose untiring 
efforts have helped in such great degree to make our beautiful 
Wisconsin the prosperous state it is to-day. With this explan- 
ation we beg that our readers will be 

"To our faults a little blind. 
And to our virtues very kind.'' 

— M. B. W. 



INTRODUCTION. 



IF I were asked the greatest need of the American house- 
wife of to-day^ I should answer without hesitation, "A 
wiser and more complete training for service in the home." 
This training should be given not only to the class employed 
as assistants, but to the mistress herself. 

The feeblest judgment admits the necessity of training 
for every profession, for every trade, for every department of 
labor. No one pretends to question it; time and money are 
given and given freely to secure it. But in one department, 
and that the most elemental and important in its need, we 
seem to take it for granted that little or no preparation is 
required. The result is, the young married woman too often 
steps into her home to preside over its destinies ignorant of 
almost everything that can build its foundation deep and 
secure. She may know every other form of mathematics save 
that which will enable her to use wisely her husband's income. 
It is unnecessary to touch upon more than one point of 
this important subject. I therefore select the room in the 
home on which beyond all others its comfort and well-being 
must depend — the kitchen. Here the food is to be prepared 
and on the right preparation depend the health and the pros- 
perity of the family. I say health, because every particle of 
improperly prepared food is more or less indigestible and 
must sooner or later make its grim and relentless demand 



upon the system. I say prosperity, because the most generous 
incorae may be squandered in waste ; for alas ! it may be said 
in passing, no department knows more of cruel waste than 
the American kitchen of the present hour. 

While America has the finest food products in the world, 
these products are unquestionably the most abused in prepara- 
tion. This is one of the reasons why two hundred millions 
of dollars find their way annually to the pockets of merchants 
and hotel keepers in foreign cities. The traveler must be dull 
indeed if he does not bring from his experience a desire to 
improve these conditions in his own land. 

The first step toward this should be the establishment of 
a department of cooking in every young woman's school in 
this country. This essential art, with its essential text-book, 
should be mastered by every woman. We should surround 
such instruction with every appliance and every well-appointed 
equipment that science can bestow. When this is done we 
shall find that no investment is more secure in its reward. 

On such investment depends the prevalence of successful 
and well ordered homes, and on the successful and well 
ordered home depend not only the well-being, but the higher 
life of a people; the truest spiritual uplift will come only 
when the people know that 

"Not soul helps body 
More than body helps soul."

Bread. 



"Here is bread, which strengthens man's heart and therefore 
called the staflf of life." 

WHEAT BREAD. 

About nine o'clock in the morning put a cake of Yeast- 
Poam to soak in warm water, enough to cover it ; when it has 
dissolved stir in enough flour to make a batter. At noon, pour 
boiling potato water over a cup of flour, stir well, add two 
mashed potatoes and when cool stir in the yeast. The sponge 
may be set early in the morning or in the evening. For four 
loaves of bread take one quart of warm water and flour 
enough to make a batter that will drop from the spoon; add 
the sponge. When light, put in one tablespoon of sugar, 
one of salt, one large spoonful of lard, melted, and add flour 
enough to make a dough. Knead smooth, set to rise, and 
when light put into pans. When light enough to bake the 
dough will not retain the pressure of the finger. Bake one 
hour. Mrs. P. W. Hams. 



WEST BEND COOK BOOK. 



WHEAT BKEAD. 

Save the water in which potatoes have been boiled at noon 
and pour boiling hot over three or four medium sized potatoes 
which have been boiled and put through a ricer. Add flour 
to make a medium batter. When this sponge is lukewarm 
stir into it one-half cake Yeast Foam, which has been dis- 
solved in half a cup of warm water and let stand until the 
next morning. Do not keep in too warm a place or it will 
become too light and perhaps sour. In the morning take 
about two quarts of flour, heaping tablespoon of lard, table- 
spoon of sugar, heaping teaspoon of salt and a pint of boiling 
milk poured over the flour. Let stand until cool and then 
break in an egg; mix with the spoon, then knead stiff, let 
rise and knead again. Let rise the second time, knead and 
put into pans which it half fills. When light enough to reach 
the top of the pans bake nearly an hour. The above amount 
makes three good-sized loaves. 

—Mrs. W. E. Wolfrum. 

BKEAD. 

At night dissolve one cake Yeast Foam in one-half cup 
warm water. Mash fine three boiled potatoes and pour over 
them one pint of the water in which they were boiled; while 
hot add flour enough to make a moderately stiff batter. When

lukewarm add the dissolved yeast cake and let stand over 
night. In the morning add three pints warm water, two 
teaspoons salt and as much sifted flour as can be beaten in 
with a spoon. Let rise and when light add one and one-half 
tablespoons each of lard and sugar. Knead stiff and let rise 
again, then mould into five loaves, let rise, and bake forty- 
five minutes in moderate o^en. Milk may be used instead of 
water, but should first be scalded and added when lukewarm. 

— Mrs. David Fletcher. 



FRENCH BREAD. 

Wash three medium-sized potatoes, steam without re- 
moving the skins, mash thoroughly (skins and all) with 
half pint of flour; then add half pint of lukewarm water, 
and half ounce of salt. When well mixed let stand in a 
place where the temperature is about 78 degrees Fahrenheit 
for one hour; then add half pint of good yeast and let stand 
in warm place for about nine hours. It may require a little 
more or less than nine hours, but the time may be known in 
this way — the compound will, after awhile, gradually and 
slowly foam for some time and then begin to fall. As soon 
as it begins to fall, mix about a cup of lukewarm water with 
it and strain through a sieve; mix what is strained with two 
pounds of flour and sufficient tepid water to make an ordi- 



10 WEST BEND COOK BOOK. 

nary dough. Knead thoroughly^ let stand in a warm place 
until it cracks on the top, which will probably be about an 
hour; then put six pounds of flour in the bread pan and 
make a hole in the center, place in this some warm water and 
the cracked dough with two even tablespoons of salt. Knead 
well with water enough to make an ordinary dough. The 
more the dough is kneaded, the lighter the bread ; then shape 
the loaves, let rise, and bake for about an hour in a quick 
oven. To shape loaves of French bread, divide the dough as 
soon as kneaded into as many parts as loaves required. Knead 
each part so as to form a ball, then by rolling and pulling 
give it an elongated, sausagelike shape. When the dough is 
thus lengthened take a small rolling pin or a round stick, 
place it on top of the dough lengthwise, press on it and roll 
a little to and fro, so as to make a furrow in the middle. 
Have a cloth well dusted with flour, and place the loaves 
upon it with the furrowed side under ; let rise as for ordinary 
bread, and place in baking pans with furrows on upper side. 
Dust the furrows well with flour to prevent them from clos- 
ing in baking and rub the rest of the loaf with a cloth dipped 
in milk, which gives the shine seen on French bread. The 
pans used for baking should be shallow and broad enough to 
hold the loaf without crowding so there may be as much crust 
as possible. Half of the above recipe will make four medium- 
sized loaves of bread. — Mrs. C. A. Weil. 



BREAD 11 



BREAD. 

Two quarts flour, one quart lukewarm water or milk, one 
cake yeast, little salt and sugar. Work all together one-half 
hour, put in greased dish, let rise three hours. Mould in two 
loaves, let stand one and one-half hours. Bake one hour. 

— Mrs. C. Muellenbach. 

HOP YEAST. 

Put a handful of hops in a bag, boil in two quarts of 
water with three good-sized potatoes. When the potatoes are 
cooked, mash fine, add hop water, half a cup sugar, two table- 
spoons salt and one of ginger. When cool add one teacup 
good yeast, put in a jar and keep in cool place. 

POTATO YEAST. 

Boil twelve medium-sized potatoes until tender and then 
put potatoes and water through a sieve. Mix one pint flour 
smooth with water, then turn into one quart boiling water 
and cook until it is like thin gravy; while hot add three- 
fourths cup each sugar and salt, and the strained potato 
water. When lukewarm add four yeast cakes dissolved in 
water. Use one quart of this yeast to make four loaves of 
bread. — Mrs. G. W. Jones.

STOCK FOR CLEAR SOUP. 

Two pounds of shin of beef, one onion^ one carrot, one 
turnip, half teaspoon peppercorns, three pints of water, one 
bunch of sweet herbs, and small piece of white part of celery. 
Cut the meat into small pieces, put into a saucepan and pour 
water over it. Let come to a boil, then skim carefully, add 
a saltspoon of salt, and after a few minutes skim the stock 
again. Let it simmer slowly for an hour. Cut the vegetables 
in pieces and add them with the herbs and peppercorns to 
the stock; then let all simmer together four hours longer. 
Strain the stock, setting it aside till cold. When wanted for 
use, remove every particle of fat, put the stock into the sauce- 
pan with two ounces of fresh meat, a small piece of carrot, 
the same of turnip, celery, and onion, and a small bunch of 
herbs. Let them simmer for a short time. This gives a 
fresher taste to the soup. Strain as before. For vermicelli, 
rice, sago, and macaroni soups it is sufficient to strain the 
stock through a clean cloth, but for clear soup it must be 
cleared as well as strained. — Mrs. F. Lauer. 

TO CLEAR SOUP STOCK. 

Place the stock in a saucepan over a brisk fire. When 
boiling, add the white of an egg to each quart of stock, pro- 
ceeding as follows: Beat the whites of the eggs well in a

gradually into the pan, then beat the whole hard and long. 
Allow it to boil up once, and immediately remove and strain 
through a thin flannel cloth. Rice, sago, pearled barley, ver- 
micelli and macaroni are desirable additions to meat soups; 
the first three are used in the proportion of one-half teacup 
to three quarts of soup; wash and soak. Rice requires one- 
half hour boiling in the soup. Sago cooks in fifteen minutes. 
Barley should be soaked over night, boiled alone in a little 
water till tender and added to the soup just before serving. 
Vermicelli and macaroni, broken and washed thoroughly, 
should be boiled in soup one-half hour. Rolled oatmeal is a 
good substitute for rice.

Salads. 



"Some cold salad is before thee set,

CKEAM DRESSING FOR SALAD. 

3 eggs (beaten), 1 teaspoon salt, 

6 tablespoons cream, 1 teaspoon mustard, 

3 tablespoons melted J teaspoon pepper, 

butter, 1 teacup vinegar. 

Beat ingredients thoroughly, heat, and stir constantly 
until thickened; when cool, mix with salad. 

— Mrs. Chas. A. Silberzahn.

^ teaspoon mustard, 1 white of egg, 

1 teaspoon sugar. Little salt and red pep- 

^ pint olive oil, per. 

Put 3^olks in cold soup plate; add mustard, salt, pepper

at a time, until as thick as butter ; while beating add vinegar, 
little at a time. A little Worcestershire sauce improves it.

with lettuce leaves, and serve on lettuce leaves. 

— Mrs. C. A. Adams. 

EXCELLENT SALAD DRESSING.

beaten yolks of five eggs; take from the stove as soon as it 
thickens. While hot add a piece of butter, size of a small egg, 
and one teaspoon of a mixture composed of five teaspoons salt, 
one heaping teaspoon mustard, one level teaspoon cayenne. 
When cold, add one-half pint of cream, whipped stiff, and 
juice of half a lemon. This is most excellent for salmon salad 
composed of equal quantities of canned salmon and celery. 

— Mrs. N. B. Lawson. 

MAYONNAISE DRESSING. 

2 egg yolks, 1 lemon (juice). 

i pint olive oil, 

Beat yolks thoroughly with egg beater, add lemon juice, 
then gradually add the oil (about half a teaspoon at a time) 
and beat thoroughly until all oil is used. This recipe makes 
about one pint of dressing. — Mrs. A. P. Chapman. 



SALADS. 65 

MAYONNAISE DEESSING. 

2 egg yolks, 1 teaspoon dry mustard, 

2 saltspoons salt, ^ pint olive oil, 

1 saltspoon pepper or 3 tablespoons cider vine- 

pinch cayenne, gar. 

To prevent curdling beat with wooden spoon the yolks, 
salt, pepper, and mustard together before adding the oil, 
which must be stirred in gradually a few drops at a time, 
taking care to blend each portion with the egg before adding 
more, stirring constantly until a thick paste is formed and 
the mixture has a glossy instead of a velvety appearance ; then 
add a few drops of vinegar, stirring all the time, until it is 
the consistency of thick cream ; stir in more oil in drops until 
mayonnaise is stiff again, when a few drops of vinegar should 
be beaten in. So continue alternating until all oil is used, 
adding vinegar rather cautiously at last, so that when the 
mayonnaise is finished it will be stiff enough to remain on 
top of the salad. The dressing should be stirred one way to 
prevent curdling. Add a few drops of lemon juice with the 
vinegar. The oily flavor is entirely lost in combination with 
the raw egg. Fifteen or twenty minutes are required for put- 
ting the ingredients together. Care must be taken not to 
add too much oil at first or the mayonnaise will curdle. When 
this happens, beat the yolks of one or two eggs on another 



66 WEST BEND COOK BOOK. 

plate, add to them the curdled mayonnaise by degrees, and 
finish by adding more oil and vinegar, or lemon juice. The 
danger of curdling is less if the addition of vinegar is begun 
when only a little oil has been used. After all ingredients are 
thoroughly mixed the addition of a cup of whipped cream 
enriches the dressing. This sauce keeps well if bottled and 
corked with a glass stopper, and it may be made at any time 
in advance when yolks are left over from baking. In sum- 
mer, place oil and eggs in cold place half an hour before 
making. The well beaten white of an egg may be added to 
the dressing just before using. Butter may be used instead 
of oil in any mayonnaise dressing by first creaming it, and 
adding slowly a well beaten egg. This makes a nice dressing 
for fish. —Mrs. H. D. B. Dustin.

SAUERKEAUT. 
In October, slice good firm cabbage heads, after the 
coarse outer leaves and large fibers have been removed; put a 
layer of cabbage about six inches thick in a jar, sprinkle with 
a handful of salt, pound down with a wooden potato masher, 
and so continue until the jar is nearly filled; cover with cab- 
bage leaves and a cloth; then put in a board cover, with a 
stone on the top to keep the cabbage under the brine; when 
the kraut begins to ferment put it in a cool place, where it 
will not freeze. Will be ready to cook in four or five weeks. 
Sauerkraut may be served cold from the jar or may be cooked 
slowly about two hours in salt pork fat. A better way to cook 
kraut is to squeeze it from the brine and cook slowly about 
four hours with a piece of smoked ham or corned beef as 
preferred; kraut may also be served with a dressing made of 
one tablespoon of lard and one of flour browned together over 
the fire and mixed thoroughly with about one quart of the

string. Dip the rolls into remainder of the egg and put into 
a stew pan, packing them lightly to keep the shape. Add the 
stock or water, cover the pan and let olives simmer for about 
an hour. When cooked, take from the pan; mix the flour 
with a little cold water or stock, stir it with a quarter teaspoon 
of browning into the gravy, boil two or three minutes, then 
add the Worcester sauce. Eemove the strings, arrange the 
olives on a dish and pour gravy round them. Veal seasoning 
can be used to fill them, if preferred, or an onion, chopped 
fine, can be added to the seasoning given above.

BROILED BEEFSTEAK. 

All steak should be cut at least three-quarters of an inch 
thick^ and should never be pounded^ as it affords ready escape 
of all the juices. Heat the broiler well before putting on the 
steak; turn frequently, being careful not to burn. When the 
meat is cooked, place it on a heated platter, season with salt 
and pepper, and place a lump of butter on top; turn the 
steak and repeat this process, so as to have both sides seasoned. 

— Mrs. A. Husting. 

BROWNED BEEF (Pot Roast). 
Heat a tablespoon of butter in a kettle, put in about 
three pounds of beef chuck, which has been seasoned on both 
sides with salt and pepper ; add clove and tiny piece of onion ; 
cover closely so the meat may cook in its own juice, t which 
should be added a very little water to keep from burning. 
Ttirn occasionally, and when tender — in about four hours — 
take out meat and make a gravy by stirring a tablespoon of 
flour in the drippings, adding hot water to make of proper 
consistency. The onion and clove may be omitted, if pre- 
ferred. Mrs. Chas. A. Silberzahn. — 

CORNED BEEF. (Pressed.) 

Put the meat in cold water, skim carefully while simmer- 
ing slowly five or six hours; then remove the bones, pick the 
meat to pieces, mix in the fat so it will be marbled, pack in a 
granite pan, press with a heavy weight and serve cold in thin 
slices. — Mrs. Micks. 



132 WEST BEND COOK BOOK. 

FILLED PORK. 

6 lbs. shoulder pork, 1 small onion, 

1 cup bread crumbs, Pepper and salt. 

Toast the coffee cup of bread crumbs, cut the onion in 
small squares, season with pepper and salt and mix thor- 
oughly for the dressing. Cut deep incisions in the pork 
with a sharp knife and fill them with the dressing; if any 
remains spread it over the top of the pork and roast in the 
oven. Very nice. — Mrs. William Alton. 



MOCK DUCK. 

Take round steak and spread over it a dressing as for 
chicken or turkey; roll and tie securely. Bake about half 
an hour with scraps of bacon, or beef fat. 

— Mrs. William A. Pors. 



POT ROAST OF STEAK. 

Cut a round of beefsteak into pieces not too large. Cook 
slowly in a kettle containing a little water for three hours; 
then let the water boil out, add butter and brown nicely. 
Very fine. — Mrs. Wm. Crump. 



MEATS. 133 



EOAST BEEF. 

Put a three or four-pound roast in a dry pan with no 
seasoning of any kind; set pan on a brick in a smoking hot 
oven; as soon as the roast is well seared over, open the oven 
doors and decrease the heat to medium as soon as possible, 
then close the doors and cook very slowly until done. Beef 
roasted in this way is excellent, as it retains all its juices and 
flavor. Keep stock on hand for gravy, as there will be none 
in the pan. Seasoning extracts the juices, so season after it is 
served. — Mrs. Knox. 

ROULADEN. 
Take round beefsteak, press flat, season with salt and 
pepper, cut into three inch squares, spread a thin slice of ham 
(fat and lean) over each square, and sliced onions over the 
ham; roll and tie firmly with a string. Place a medium- 
sized kettle over a moderate fire and melt in it a good-sized 
piece of butter; roll the rouladen in this, pack closely to- 
gether, cover well, and during the first ten minutes of sim- 
mering turn them; then pour on gradually enough boiling 
water for gravy; boil slowly forty-five minutes then add a 
little flour made smooth in a large tablespoon of sour cream ; 
cook fifteen minutes longer, then remove the strings, place 
the rouladen in a serving dish and pour the gravy over. 

— Clara L. Kuechenmeister.

OLD FASHIONED BOILED DINNER. 

Early in the morning put a four-pound piece of corned 
beef in a large kettle of cold water ; simmer slowly ; about ten 
o'clock put in a one pound piece of salt pork, a few small 
beets with unbroken skin, and a couple of large carrots; at 
eleven o'clock put in turnips cut in three or four pieces, par- 
snips and some good sized peeled potatoes; add salt and a 
pinch of red pepper. Serve the vegetables in separate dishes. 
A nice dessert with this dinner is boiled Indian pudding. 

— Mrs. Micks. 

SPICED BEEF. 

Season raw chopped steak with salt, pepper and spices to 
taste; add two eggs, half a pint of bread crumbs, five table- 
spoons cream and a small piece of butter; mix and make into 
a roll with enough flour to bind it together, put in a pan with 
a little butter and bake. Slice when cold. 

— Mrs. R. S. Lynch. 

TO BOIL CORNED BEEF. 

Put the beef in enough cold water to cover, let gradually 
come to a boil, and cook slowly until tender, skimming the 
grease from the top as it boils. May be much improved by 
boiling potatoes, turnips and cabbage with it. Allow about 
twenty minutes to each pound of meat. 

— Rose Kuehlthau. 



MEATS. 135 



TO ROAST BEEF. 

Select a good rib roast and wipe with a damp cloth in- 
stead of washing. Put a dripping pan on the stove until it 
gets smoking hot. Put in the beef without seasoning or 
dressing of any kind, let it sear on both sides, then rub with 
salt, sprinkle with a little pepper and add just enough boiling 
water to keep it from burning. Place in a good hot oven to 
roast, allowing fifteen minutes to a pound and fifteen minutes 
for the pan. Replenish the water as it cooks away. 

—Mrs. C. A. Weil. 

FILLET, A LA JARDINIERE. 
Remove the skin and fat from a good-sized fillet of beef, 
lard with strips of bacon on both sides. Have a roasting pan 
ready in which has been browned a large piece of butter; 
brown the fillet on both sides, then gradually add one cup 
sour cream, and, if necessary, a little boiling water; baste 
often. Roast one hour. Serve on a large platter, garnished 
with different vegetables — peas, caulifiower, small potatoes? 
fried whole, and mushrooms — each vegetable formed in fields. 

FRICADELLE. 
i pound beef, -| cup cold water, 

i pound veal, 3 eggs, 

■J pound pork, Pepper and salt to taste. 

1 cup bread crumbs. 



136 WEST BEND COOK BOOK. 

Chop the meat very fine, mix with the other ingredients, 
form into a loaf and roast two hours in plenty of butter. 
Slices of bacon on top improve the meat wonderfully. After 
the loaf is browned on top (it must not be turned) pour in 
a half or a whole cup of boiling water to prevent burning. 

— Mrs. William A. Pors. 

MEAT LOAF OR HOCK. 
1 pound beefsteak, and 2 beaten eggs, 
1 pound pork, chopped | small loaf bread crumbs, 

fine together. 
Season to taste with sage, salt and pepper. Mix into 
loaf and bake thirty minutes. — Mrs. Lane. 

MEAT LOAF. 

Take one-third pound each of beef, pork and veal, 
chopped together by the butcher. Add two eggs, pepper, salt, 
little nutmeg, one small onion, a little chopped parsley, and 
baker's roll, soaked in hot water and milk. Make into a loaf 
and bake one-half hour. — Mrs. A. Husting. 

MEAT PORCUPINE. 

Chop lean cooked veal, chicken or lamb fine; add one- 
fourth its quantity of cracker or bread crumbs, and a little 
chopped bacon; season highly with salt, pepper and 



MEAT3. 137 



lemon juice; moisten with beaten egg and stock or water 
enough to shape it. Mould into an oval loaf, insert strips of 
fat baron, put in shallow, well-greased pan and bake till 
brown. The bacon will baste the meat sufficiently. 

—Mrs. Emil C. Pors. 

MEAT SHAPE (English). 

f pound cooked meat, 1 teaspoon minced parsley, 

3 ounces cooked rice, J teaspoon pepper, 

1 onion, i teaspoon salt. 

3 tablespoons gravy, 
Mince the meat very fine; peel, scald and mince the 
onion, mix it with the meat, rice, parsley, pepper and salt. 
Bind the mixture with the gravy, and turn it into a buttered 
basin or moulded shape and steam for an hour. Thicken 
some stock with butter and flour, add a teaspoon of Worcester 
sauce. Turn out the shape and pour gravy, which should 
be a good brown color, around it. This is an economical way 
of using the remnants of cold meat, vegetables or pieces of 
bread. Cold carrot or any other vegetable chopped fine, may 
be mixed with the meat and improves the flavor. Pieces of 
bread, soaked a few minutes in a little stock or milk, beaten 
so that no lumps remain, or cold potatoes, mashed smoothly, 
may be used instead of rice. An egg makes the dish richer. 

—Mrs. C. A. Weil.

ROAST LEG OF LAMB (Sour). 

Eemove all skin and fat, place in a deep dish and 
sprinkle a little salt over, taking care not to use much, as it 
will toughen the meat ; then add several small onions, or one 
large one, cut in slices, a scant tablespoon of whole pepper, 
three or four cloves, one bay leaf and several juniper berries ; 
cover with vinegar, which if very strong, should tie diluted 
with water. Leave in vinegar from two to four days; when 
ready to use draw narrow strips of bacon through the meat, 
pepper and salt slightly, place in a hot dripping pan, in which 
has been melted a piece of butter, the size of an eggy pour in 
a cup of boiling water, cover and put in a moderately hot 
oven, basting occasionally. In about two hours the roast 
should be done and a rich brown in color. If not sour enough 
add some' of the spiced vinegar. A little sour cream may be 
used to thicken gravy, or flour and water if preferred. A 
slice of lemon and a little sugar improves the gravy. While 
in the vinegar the miCat should be turned over every day. 
Beef roast (sour) may be prepared the same way. 

— Eose Kuehlthan. 



ESCALLOPED MEAT OF ANY KIND. 

Chop cooked meat fine, moisten with gravy, or if you 
have none, use water with butter, pepper and salt. Place in

this way to make a palatable dish. 

— Mrs. E. S. Lynch. 

POT EOAST OF VEAL. 

Brown one-half cup butter in a kettle, then put in five 
pounds lean veal, and brown it well on all sides, being careful 
not to bum it. Add a large cup of thick sour cream; turn 
the meat until the cream is thoroughly browned, then add 
salt, one bay leaf, little pepper, and water enough to boil 
about two hours. Let the water almost boil out, then remove 
the meat; add water and flour to thicken the gravy, and 
strain. Very nice. — Mrs. Frances E. Ott. 

PRESSED VEAL. 

Boil two or three pounds of veal until tender; season 
with salt, pepper and butter; let cook a little longer, then take

VEAL POT EOAST. 

Put a piece of butter, the size of a walnut, and three or 
four pounds of veal into a smoking hot iron kettle. Keep 
turning the meat until all sides are well seared, then sprinkle 
a tablespoon of flour over it, season with salt and pepper, and 
add a little hot water. Watch it carefully, as the flour has a 
tendency to make it scorch, and replenish the water as it 
boils down. Cook slowly about two hours. Twenty minutes 
before serving put in some peeled potatoes; when they are 
done place the meat on a platter and the potatoes around it; 
pour the thick brown gravy over the whole. Or, instead of 
the potatoes, add dumplings made of one cup flour, one heap- 
ing teaspoon baking powder, one-quarter teaspoon salt and 
milk to malce a stiff batter. Drop in kettle a tablespoonf ul 
at a time and boil, closely covered, for twenty minutes. 

—Mrs. C. A. Weil.

water and a little sprinkle of flour. Cover closely and let 
simmer slowly. — Mrs. Chas. A. Silberzahn. 



MEATS. 143 



CALF'S LIVER AND BACON. 

Slice the liver a quarter of an inch thick, pour hot water 
over it and let remain a few minutes to clear from blood; 
dry with a cloth. Cut about a pound of bacon into as many 
thin slices as there are of liver. Fry the bacon to a nice crisp 
and keep hot; then fry the liver in the same pan, having sea- 
soned it with pepper and salt, and dredged it in a little flour. 
Serve with a slice of bacon on each slice of liver. 

— Mrs. Victor Husting. 

CALF'S HEAD CHEESE. 

Boil a calf's head in water enough to cover, until the 
meat leaves the bones; put in wooden bowl, chop fine, season 
with a teaspoon of salt and a teaspoon of pepper. Lay a 
cloth in colander, put meat into it, fold the cloth closely 
over it, cover with a plate and put a weight on it. Slice 
when cold. — Rosa Kuelthau. 

SAUR BRATEN. 

Cover a rump of beef with vinegar and let it stand over 
night. In the morning take half the vinegar and as much 
water, add a few peppercorns, cloves, bay leaves, one onion, 
a little allspice, half cup raisins, and half cup sweet almonds. 
Let beef stew in this liquid until tender, then take it out and 
slice. Add to the gravy one tablespoon brown sugar, and two 
tablespoons flour browned in a piece of butter and stirred 
very smooth. If that does not thicken gravy enough add two

SOUE FLEISCH. 
Brown one tablespoon of flour in one tablespoon of lard ; 
add a pinch of sugar, an onion cut fine and pepper and salt to 
taste. When the onion is cooked soft, add a tablespoon of cold 
water, then pour in slowly enough hot water to make a 
smooth gravy. Season with spices, cloves, allspice, nutmeg 
and vinegar to suit taste. Any cold beef or tongue, thinly 
sliced, can be used in this gravy. — Grandma Pick. 

SWEET AND SOUE TONGUE (French). 

Boil a tongue in salt water until tender; then peel, cut 
in slices, and cook about half an hour in the following gravy ; 
To one large tablespoon of .flour and one of butter well 
browned together, add a good sized onion, about a pint of 
boiling water, three tablespoons vinegar, a few cloves, one bay 
leaf, half a teaspoon ginger, sugar to taste, a few raisins 
and two or three slices of lemon. — Mrs. Schlesinger Weil.

from day before roast or stew, season with chopped celery or 
parsley, salt and pepper; v/hile this stews gently for ten min- 
utes, toast and butter enough bread to cover a hot platter; 
spread a large spoonful of the stew on each piece of the toast 
and serve at once. 

CROQUETTES. 

To one pint of minced cold meat, add one teacup of 
bread crumbs, one beaten egg, salt and pepper; make into 
little pats and fry brown in drippings or butter. 

BREAKFAST BACON. 

Cover the bottom of a pudding dish an inch deep with 
well seasoned cold meat and enough stock or gravy to moisten 
well. Cover the meat with an equal quantity of mashed 
potatoes; put bits of butter over the top and bake a light 
brown in a quick oven. — Mrs. J. H. Williamson. 

TO USE SMALL PIECES OF COLD HAM. 

Chop the ham fine, add a few bread crumbs, a little milk 
and season with mustard, if desired; mix thoroughly; line 
gem irons with it, patting it in firmly; break an egg in each 
ring and bake quickly until the eggs whiten on the top. 

— Mrs. Tippett.

J ounce butter, 4 pint stock or water, 

i teaspoon salt, 1 onion, 

J teaspoon pepper, 3 cloves 

Cut meat into slices, trimming off the outside brown edge 
and any gristle. Peel and slice the onion; melt the butter 
in a stew pan; fry the slices of onion a light brown, stir in 
the flour, add the stock or water. Let the sauce boil a few 
minutes then add the cloves, pepper and salt, lay in the 
slices of cold meat, put on the back of stove where it can sim- 
mer very gently, but not boil, or the meat will be hard. If the 
sauce is too thick, add a little more stock or water before 
putting in the meat. Let it simmer ten or fifteen minutes; 
serve with sippets of toasted bread or a wall of mashed pota- 
toes. If the sauce is not brown enough, add a little brown 
flour or a teaspoon of mushroom catsup.

bread crumbs covering both sides of meat. Put about an 



MEATS. 147 



ounce of butter or very good dripping into a pan; let it get 
hot and fry the meat a light brown. Make a sauce of butter 
and flour, as directed for hashed meat No. 1, add the lemon 
juice after sauce is taken from the fire ; arrange the meat on a 
serving dish and pour sauce around it. This dish can be 
varied by laying the slices of meat on a bed of vegetables, 
such as peas, mashed potatoes, French or haricot beans. 

—Mrs. C. A. Weil. 

FRENCH STEW. 

Put a tablespoon each of butter and flour in a kettle, 
cook until brown, add a small minced onion and three pounds 
of veal, ut in small pieces. Cover with a quart of water, add

a little at a time, and cook until tender. The gravy must 
be a rich brown. Serve with dumplings. 

— Mrs. A. B. Liebermann. 



148 WEST BEND COOK BOOK. 

CROQUETTES. 

To make appetizing croquettes from the remnants of 
meat, poultry, etc., it is necessary to use the same discrimi- 
nation that is requisite in making good soup — that is, care 
must be taken that one seasoning has not undue prominence 
over another — all being so finely blended that they shall seem 
as one to the palate. Take any pieces of cold meat, add egg 
cooked in any way, if it be on hand, and mince fine. Into 
three cups of meat thus minced, chop two level teaspoons of 
sage and a piece of onion, the size of a small nutmt •. Next 
add half cup cracker or bread crumbs, for the above mount 
of meat, a well beaten egg, one cup or less of good grav\ salt 
and pepper to taste. The gravy may be omitted by substitu- 
ting a piece of butter the size of a walnut, one tablespoon flour 
and enough hot water to make the croquettes moist. Roll a 
heaping tablespoon of the mixture in the hands to a flat cake 
and fry in butter in a frying pan ; or it may be moulded into 
round or cone-shaped croquettes and fried in deep fat, like 
doughnuts. These croquettes are very nice made small and 
served on a platter of scrambled eggs, garnished with parsley. 

—Mrs. C. A. Weil.

BAKED SWEETBREADS. 

Put three sweetbreads into warm water to draw out the 
blood. Let them remain little more than an hour, then put 
into boiling water and let simmer ten minutes to make firm. 
Drain, brush over with beaten egg, roll in bread crumbs, dip 
in egg again, sprinkle with fresh crumbs, pour a little melted 
butter over them, put into a moderate oven and bake for about 
three-quarters of an hour. Place sweetbreads on toast, and 
pour a good, brown gravy around but not over them. They 
may be prepared in the same manner and fried instead of 
baked. 

STEWED SWEETBREADS.

FRICASSEED RABBIT. 

Cut the rabbit in pieces, put into a stew pan and season 
with salt, cayenne pepper and a little chopped parsley; pour 
in a pint of hot water (or veal stock if you have it), and 
stew slowly until tender ; when about half done, add some bits 
of butter, rolled in flour and just before taking from the 
stove add half a cup of thick cream with a dash of nutmeg. 
Stir well, but do not boil after the cream is in or it will 
curdle. ' — Rose Kuehlthau. 

LUNG SAUSAGE. 

Use recipe for filling for poultry or veal's breast, given in 
book, omitting the apple and using calf lungs. Fill casing, 
not too stiff, and boil ten minutes. Very nice to have on 
hand ; will keep a week. Prepare the sausage for the table by 
frying in butter. — Mrs C. A. Silberzahn. 

PANNHAUSE OR PENNSYLVANIA SCRAPPLE. 

Clean a hog's head well; cut into four or five pieces and 
soak in cold water over night to remove blood. Boil until the 
meat falls from the bones; use three gallons of water for a 
whole head and keep that amount until meat is done. Let 
stand until cool, then take off the fat that rises and put away 
to use in frying the pannhause. Put the meat over the firt- 



MEATS. 151 



again; when warm, remove all bones and cut the meat into 
small pieces, without chopping. Then put meat and liquid 
over the fire, and when boiling stir in equal parts of Indian 
meal and buckwheat flour until the consistency of ordinary 
mush, or until the spoon will stand erect in it. Season well 
with salt and pepper and pour into pans to cool. The next 
day it can be placed on boards to keep until wanted for use. 
When wanted, slice and fry brown on both sides and it is 
ready for tlie table. — Mrs. E. S. Lynch. 

SOUP MEAT. 

Pick the meat in pieces, add a small bowl of the broth, 
season well, press with a heavy weight and serve in thin 
slices. Another nice way is to slice an onion fine, mix with 
the meat, put through the chopper, season with butter, 
pepper and salt; add cracker crumbs, form into balls and 
fry in butter. 

BAKED HAM. 

Get the best in the market, not too salt, cut the outside 
and shank off. Mix flour enough in one quart of cold water 
to make a stiff dough. Poll the dough out, lay the ham in 
it and pinch together like a turnover. Bake a thirteen pound 
ham four hours in a moderate oven. Leave the cap on until 
cold. —Mrs. W. R. Lyle.

of sugar. Stir together until a nice brown, then take from 
the fire and add one-fourth cup vinegar, and water, a little 
at a time, until it has consistency of gravy. If any meat 
gravy is left over add it and season the whole with a little 
allspice, cloves^ pepper, salt and a bay leaf. Put in a few 
raisins, and lastly, the slices of cold meat. Let boil up thor- 
oughly and serve hot. The browned sugar may harden when 
liquid is poured in, but it will soon dissolve.

leaves the bones readily, then thicken the water in which the 
chicken was boiled with flour and season with butter and 
salt. Fill a deep dish with alternate layers of toasted bread 
crumbs, shredded chicken and slices of hot boiled potatoes, 
having crumbs on top; moisten well with gravy and bake

168 WEST BEND COOK BOOK. 

ferrecl, sew up with cord, sprinkle outside with salt and pep- 
per, lay in a pan, breast down, cover with slices of fat salt 
pork and hake slowly four hours. Serve with cranberry sauce 
or currant jelly. Another nice way when turkey is prepared 
for the oven is to cover with a thick paste of flour and water 
iufetead of the pork, and baste often with the drippings; the 
bottom of the pan must be kept well covered with water. 
Cook the neck, liver, gizzard and heart until tender, chop 
and add to the gravy. Any fowl may be roasted the same 
way, but in roasting goose put it in the oven in a dripping 
pan on a rack, and when it begins to fry, prick thoroughly 
with a meat fork several different times to extract the surplus 
fat. Eemove the goose when dry (in about an hour), dredge 
with flour and salt, put bits of butter over the top and bake 
three hours longer. Another very nice way to cook a fowl 
is to boil it slowly in a kettle with very little water, or steam 
in a steamer an hour before putting it in the oven to roast.

CREAM CANDIES.

out stirring until it begins to thread; take from stove and 
let stand until it begins to thicken, then stir until white and 
too stiff to handle with a spoon. Add one teaspoon of vanilla 
while stirring, then knead like dough until cool. (To pre- 
vent the outside from crusting while moulding, cover with a 
napkin wrung out of cold water.) This is the foundation or 
fondant. Varieties : 

1. Remove the stones from dates; fill with the fondant, 
press sides together and roll in granulated sugar. 

2. On little balls (moulded by rolling in the hands) 
press an almond, the half of a walnut or pecan. 

3. Knead into a part of the fondant as much shredded 
cocoanut as desired, then mould and roll in cocoanut. 



378 WEST BEND COOK BOOK. 

4. Chop together dates and figs. Take part of the 
fondant and flatten on a plate (dusted with powdered sugar) 
until about six inches in length and three inches in width. 
Then mould enough of the chopped fruit to make a roll of 
the same length and the thickness of a pencil. Place on the 
strip of fondant, turn the edges together and roll until round 
and smooth. Then cut with a knife into pieces one-half an 
inch in width. 

5. By mixing equal quantities of the fondant and 
chopped fruit little fruit balls may be made. 

6. By pouring a few drops of water on one-half tea- 
spoon red sugar, or on a few little red peppermint drops, and 
mixing a very little of this with the fondant, it may be tinted 
pink; also, by working in grated Baker's sweet chocolate a 
pretty brown may be obtained. 

7. Take three portions of the fondant, color one brown 
and one pink, flatten the white portion on a plate, dusted 
with powdered sugar; on this place the pink an.d then the 
brown. Cut into squares, 

8. For making chocolate drops, let the balls made of 
the plain or pink fondant stand over night. Then stick a 
toothpick or hatpin into each and dip into sweet chocolate 
until thoroughly coated. The grated chocolate is melted by 
placing it over a steaming teakettle. — Anna Gossel.

Fruit Canning, Etc. 



'Trifles make perfection, and perfection is no trifle." 



TO PEESERVE BERRIES WHOLE. 

Fruit should not be too ripe. Pick over as soon as gath- 
ered ; wash, if absolutely necessary, and put in glass jars, until 
each is two-thirds full. Put into a porcelain kettle one cup 
water and one pound of sugar, for every two pounds of fruit, 
and let come slowly to a boil. Pour this syrup into the jars 
over the berries, filling them to the brim; then set the jars in 
a pot of cold water on the stove and let the water boil and the 
fruit become scalding hot; then lift them out and seal per- 
fectly tight. 

TO CAN FRUIT.

well with the water in which they were boiled, and seal. The 
jar should stand in hot water while filling.

Helps to Young Housekeepers. 



"Live and Learn." 



Good yeast, good flour, good judgment and watchful care 
are essentials in bread making. Good flour is cream white, 
holds together in a mass when squeezed by the hand and 
retains the impression of the fingers. Learn to make good 
homemade yeast. Keep the sponge near the stove, where it 
will keep warm. Bread is "light enough" when it has doubled 
its bulk, and is ready for the oven when the loaves will not 
retain the dent of the finger. Bread should bake an hour; 
rolls and biscuits should bake quickly; baking powder and 
cream tartar biscuits should be made quickly as possible and 
baked in a hot oven. Pans, especially for gems, should be 
greased and heated before putting in the dough or batter. 
Flour should always be sifted before using, and in winter 
should be wai-med. When fresh bread is made, a part of the 
dough may be set aside in a cold place and rolls made the 
next day. In winter, kept cold, yet not in danger of freezing, 
bread dough may be kept a week. Stale bread may be used 
in griddle cakes, omelets, dressings, scalloped dishes, toma- 



416 WEST BEND COOK BOOK. 



toes, etc.; it may be dried in the oven, rolled fine and kept 
in a paper bag, or in a glass jar, for future use. 

In adding eggs to custards, soups, sauces, etc., remember 
to add a few spoonfuls of the boiling liquid to the eggs before 
stirring them into the mixture. If this is done carefully, the 
eggs will not curdle as they have an annoying habit of doing 
when stirred directly into a hot mixture. 

To separate fat from soups and gravy, thoroughly wet a 
clean white cloth in very cold water; pour soup or gravy 
through it; every particle of fat will remain in the cloth. 
Butter will blend better with soups if it is browned a little 
before adding. 

To clarify beef drippings, place the drippings in a basin 
slice into it a raw potato, let boil long enough for slices to 
brown, then cool, drain from the sediment and put in a cool 
place. When mixed with an equal quantity of butter it an- 
swers the same purpose as clear butter for frying and basting 
any meats, save game anid poultry. 

A piece of charcoal, tied in a muslin cloth, and put in 
the water in which cabbage, cauliflower, onions or ham is boil- 
ing will remove the unpleasant odor. Pepper pods answer 
the same purpose. A piece of bread tied in a cloth and boiled 
with strong vegetables will make them much milder. 

In making soups put the meat over in cold water. Fresh 
fish, game, or meats of any kind, are improved by being salted 



HELPS TO YOUNG HOUSEKEEPERS. 417 

over night. Soups and stews should be cooked slowly; the 
more gently meat boils the more tender it will become; a 
tough piece of meat can be made tender by cooking for sev- 
eral hours in water at a simmering heat. Roast meats should 
be put into a smoking hot oven; after the surface is seared 
over, the heat should be diminished and the roast cooked 
slowly until done. 

Chicken or turkey oil is very nice to use in place of salad 
oil or butter, in making salad dressings. 

Fowls, especially water fowls, after removing the 
feathers, and singeing, should be thoroughly washed with soap 
and water, after which they should be well rinsed. Another 
very good way to cleanse chickens, turkeys, etc., is to rub 
them thoroughly with dry oatmeal. In summer, dressed 
poultry, should have a piece of charcoal placed inside to be 
removed before cooking. 

Milk is curdled by salt, so do not add to milk dishes 
until they are nearly cooked. 

In filling salt shakers, add a little cornstarch to the salt 
and there will be a saving of time and temper. 

Wash egg shells when they come from the market, and 
then they may be used for clearing coffee, soup, etc. 

To chop suet, break into small bits, sprinkle with flour 
and chop in a cool place. 

87 



418 WEST BEND COOK BOOK. 



To clean currants, put in a colander, sprinkle well with 
flour, rub until grit, flour, etc., have passed through the 
strainer. Place in a pan of water and wash until water is 
stand ten minutes, when seeds are easily removed. 

To blanch almonds, remove shells, pour over boiling 
water and let stand until the dark skin rubs off easily; then 
put in cold water, rub off the skins and dry between towels. 

To remove the skins easily from peaches, plums or toma- 
toes, dip them in boiling water a minute or two. 

In mixing cake, where other methods are not given in 
this work by contributors, it would be well to observe the fol- 
lowing directions: Beat the butter and sugar to a cream; 
add the beaten yolks, spices or flavorings, milk or water, flour, 
into which the baking powder has been sifted, and lastly, the 
beaten whites. When fruit is used it should be dredged with 
flour and added last. Cakes, made with butter, should be 
beaten long and vigorously after adding the flour, that they 
may be smooth and fine grained. Sponge cakes should not be 
beaten after adding the flour, but require much beating be- 
fore. All cakes, except those containmg yeast, should be 
baked as soon as possible after they are mixed. Cakes with 
fruit in should be mixed stiffer with flour than those without 
fruit. Cakes with molasses in will bum more quickly than 
others. Baking powder should be sifted into the flour, and 
soda dissolved in sour milk or in hot water. In making sour 



HELPS TO YOUNG HOUSEKEEPERS. 419 

milk biscuits, doughnuts or cakes, in addition to the soda 
required to sweeten the sour milk use a little baking powder 
in the flour. Thin cakes should bake from fifteen to twenty 
minutes, thicker cakes from thirty to forty minutes, very 
thick loaves about an hour, and large fruit cakes two to three 
hours. To prevent cake or pie from burning, place a pan of 
cold water on the upper gTate within the oven. A cake will 
never be tough if a level tablespoon of cornstarch is sifted 
into the flour. 

Doughnuts will not take up the lard if one level teaspoon 
of ginger is sifted into the flour. 

What is left of a steamed pudding can be steamed over 
just enough to heat it through, and will be quite as nice as 
when first served. 

Tea and coffee, made hot before water is added, are more 
fragrant and stronger. 

To keep lemons fresh, put them in a jar and cover witli 
water; in summer change the water twice a week. 

In canning fruits see that the covers and rubbers are in 
perfect form. 

Keep pieces of charcoal in the refrigerator, change them 
often. • .

Diet for the 5ick, 



BY DR. J. H. WEHLE. 



In serving a meal to an invalid, one cannot be too fastid- 
ious: too large a portion, a suspicion of grease on the broth, 
will often spoil the appetite. The linen, glass, dishes, etc., 
should be the best in the house; a tiny flower laid on the 
folded napkin will do much to render the meal pleasant. 

CALVES' FEET BKOTH. 

2 calves' feet, 1 egg, 

2 quarts water, Salt, 

2 tablespoons milk, Pepper. 

Boil the feet to shreds and strain liquor. Add egg and 
milk; give one boil up and serve hot with toast. 

EGGS. 

Boiled. Dip a heavy coffee cup in boiling water (by run- 
ning a string through the handle) and heat for five minutes ; 
then break an egg into it and cover cup. The heat of the 
cup will cook the egg sufficiently ; season to taste. 



424 WEST BEND COOK BOOK. 

EGG LEMONADE. 

4 lemons (juice of four, 6 ounces loaf sugar, 

rind of two) , IJ pints boiling water. 

4 eggs,

pour the boiling water over. Let cool and strain, then add 
lemon juice and beaten eggs. 

JUNKET. 

Take one-half pint of milk (lukewarm — 100 degrees F.), 
sweeten with sugar, if necessary; add one teaspoon of Fair- 
child's essence of pepsin. Stir and divide into small cups or 
glasses and set aside until it jellies. It may be placed in ice 
before serving. This may be flavored with vanilla, nutmeg 
or cinnamon. If digestion is feeble, use liquid whey instead 
of the curd. 

EGG JUNKET. 
Two eggs beaten to a froth and sweetened with four 
teaspoons of sugar, may previously be added to milk; heat 
lukewarm ; add essence of pepsin and proceed as above. 

COCOA JUNKET. 

Scald a teaspoon of cocoa and two of sugar with two 
tablespoons of boiling water. Eub to a paste, add one-half 
pint of milk and heat mixture lukewarm. Add essence of 
pepsin and proceed as above, 



DIET FOR THE SICK. 425 



COFFEE JUNKET. 

Dissolve two teaspoons of sugar in two tablespoons of 
strong coffee and proceed as above. 

STRAWBERRY, VANILLA AND BITTER ALMOND 
JUNKET. 

Add one-half teaspoon extract of vanilla or bitter almond 
extract to above. Strawberry : One tablespoon of strawberry 
syrup to above.

Take a strong bottle (like champagne bottle) with a long 
neck and fill to lower end of neck with fresh, lukewarm milk ; 
add two tablespoons of sugar and shake; then one-sixth of a 
cake of Fleishman^s compressed yeast and cork. Wire or tie 
securely, as the Koumyss may pop. Set the bottle in tem- 
perature of 100 degrees F., for 8 or 10 hours; then place in 
cellar or on ice and use as needed. (Use champagne tap, or 
open carefully.) 

MILK. 

As milk is disagreeable to many it may be flavored by 
boiling a stick of cinnamon in it; if it is not easily digested, 
lime water or a little bi-carbonate of soda may be added. 



426 WEST BEND COOK BOOK. 

PEPTONIZED MILK. 

Take a quart Mason jar and pour into it a teacup of 
lukewarm water. Dissolve in this one of Fairchild's pepton- 
izing tubes. Add one pint of fresh milk and shake. Place 
the jar for ten minutes in water so hot that the hand can be 
held in it for one minute (say 115 F.). Now bring it to a 
boil at once, or put on ice. If directions are not carefully 
followed the mixture will become bitter. 

SAVOURY CUSTAED. 

Add yolks of two eggs to a cupful of beef tea; season 
with salt and pepper. Butter a cup, pour the mixture into 
it and let it stand in a pan of boiling water until the custard

gether, and stir into the farina, add nutmeg. Put into mod- 
erate oven and bake one-half hour. 

PANOPEPTON PREPARATIONS. 

Panopepton is a pre-digested wheat starch and beef prep- 
aration, and a good substitute for milk, where milk and other 
foods are disagreeable to patients.

Miscellaneous. 



"They have gathered the scraps." 



AN EXCELLENT SUBSTITUTE FOR BUTTEE. 

Take six pounds of suet from the breast of beef (kidney 
suet ^\dll not do), and three pounds best butter. Cook each 
slowly for several hours. Eemove the scum from the butter 
as it forms, and when done pour off from the sediment at the 
bottom, then turn the suet and butter together while hot and 
pour into a stone jar. Will keep sweet for months, and can 
be used with perfect satisfaction in place of butter, either in 
baking or cooking. 

TO KEEP BUTTEE. (German Method.) 

Put twenty pounds in a preserving kettle on the back of 
the stove to avoid all risk of burning, cook slowly seven or 
eight hours, stirring often. When done will be a pale yellow 
with brown sediment at bottom. Pour off the clear butter 
into stone jars, and set it in a cool place. Gives a fine flavor 
to meats and keeps six months or more. 



430 WEST BEND COOK BOOK. 



BAKING POWDER. 

Eight ounces bicarb, soda, six ounces tartaric acid, two- 
thirds quart of flour. Sift at least twenty times (forty will 
be better), and do not throw away the pieces left in the sieve, 
but mash them and sift again. Must be kept in cool, dry 
place. Use like any other baking powder. 

— Mrs. R. S. Lynch. 

BRINE FOR MEAT. 

7 pounds common salt, 2 teaspoons saltpeter, 
1 pound brown sugar, 5 gallons water. 

1 pint molasses. 
Let come to a boil, skim, and when cold pour over the 
meat. If dried beef is wanted leave in brine two weeks, then 
hang up several days to drain and smoke four days. 

— Mrs. F. Althaus. 

BRINE FOR 100 POUNDS OF MEAT.

RECIPE FOB HAMS. 

Pack the hams in a barrel as closely as possible, putting 
on a little salt. For 100 pounds of meat take five pounds of 
brown sugar, one-quarter pound of saltpeter, and as much 
rock salt as will dissolve in five pails of water. Put in a 
boiler and let it come to a boil; skim well, while boiling hot 
pour over the hams and cover tight. Leave in the pickle six 
weeks, then drain and smoke. — Mrs. Sarah Sheldon. 

SWEET PICKLE FOR BEEF AND PORK. 

2 gallons water, 2 pints salt, 

1 pint sugar, 1 ounce saltpeter. 

Let water, sugar and salt come to a boil, then skim and 
remove from the fire; while cooling add the saltpeter. Rub 
the beef with dry salt, let stand on its side to drain over 
night; in the morning pack tight in a jar, pour the brine over 
and in two v/eeks it will be ready to use. In cooking this 
pickled or corned beef, change the water at least twice and 
boil very slow not less than four hours. Add one cup soda to 
this brine and it makes fine pickle for pork. Leave the hams 
in the brine from four to six weeks, then remove and smoke. 

— Mrs. Anna Corr.

Fill a gallon jar with dandelion blossoms and pour over 
them one gallon of boiling water; let stand three days, then 
drain and add three pounds of sugar to the water, heat until 
the sugar is dissolved ; when cool add three oranges and one 
lemon sliced, and one dissolved 3'east-cake; let stand three 
weeks, then strain and bottle. This is an excellent spring 
tonic. — Mrs. E. Steinke. 

EXCELLENT EEMEDY FOR SORE THROAT. 

Cut a slice of fat salt pork, let stand a minute or two 
in hot vinegar, sprinkle with black pepper, and apply to the 
throat as hot as possible. When relieved and the pork is re- 
moved, bandage the throat with soft flannel. 



434 WEST BEND COOK BOOK. 

GARGLE FOE SORE THROAT. (Excellent.) 

1 ounce tincture of iron, 1 ounce glycerine. 
Dilute with water, when used. Do not touch the teeth 
with this preparation as it is very injurious to the enamel. 

LINIMENT FOR RHEUMATISM. 

To one pint cider vinegar add all the saltpeter it will
